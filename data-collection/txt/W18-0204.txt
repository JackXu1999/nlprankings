Abstract

The research presented in this paper aims to generate online content and help
to revitalize the digital functions of some Finno-Ugric (FU) minority languages.
The practical objective of the research was to create bilingual dictionaries for six
FU minority languages (Udmurt, Komi-Permyak, Komi-Zyrian, Meadow Mari,
Hill Mari and Northern Saami) paired with four major languages which are im-
portant for these communities (English, Finnish, Hungarian, Russian) and to de-
ploy the enriched lexical material on the web in the framework of the collabo-
rative dictionary project Wiktionary. We give an overview of the workflow in
whichWiktionary entries were fully automatically generated from automatically
created and manually validated translation units. We also give a thorough eval-
uation, whose results show that we would multiply the number of Wiktionary
entries in the aforementioned FU minority languages.

Tiivistelmä

Tutkimuksen tavoitteena on tuottaa digitaalista sisältöä usealle suomalais-
ugrilaiselle vähemmistökielelle, ja edistää niiden kielten elvytystä, eli pelastaa
niiden uhanalaisia kieliä häviämiseltä. Tutkimuksen käytännöllisenä tavoittee-
na oli luoda kaksikielisiä sanakirjoja kuudelle suomalais-ugrilaiselle vähemmis-
tökielelle (nimittäin udmurtille, komipermjakille, komisyrjäänille, niittymarille,
vuorimarille ja pohjoissaamelle), yhdistettynä neljään, näille yhteisöille tärkeisiin
kieliin (englanti, suomi, unkari ja venäjä). Automaattisesti luodut, sitten käsin
tarkastetut, ja morfologisien ja ääntämistietojen kanssa vahvistetut käännökset
ladattiin Wikisanakirjaan. Artikkelissa pyrittiin esittelemään koko prosessi tar-
kasti, minkä aikana Wiktionary-artikkelit luotiin kokonaan automaattisesti. Tut-
kimuksessa esittelemme myös, miten onnistuisimme moninkertaistamaanWikti-
sanakirjassa jo olemassa olevien edellä mainittujen suomalais-ugrilaisten vähem-
mistökielien sanojen lukumäärää.

1 Introduction
The research presented in this paper is part of a project whose general objective is to
provide linguistically based support for several small Finno-Ugric (FU) digital commu-
nities to generate online content and help to revitalize the digital functions of some FU
minority languages. The practical objective of the project is to create bilingual dictio-
naries for six FUminority languages (Udmurt, Komi-Permyak, Komi-Zyrian, Meadow
Mari, Hill Mari and Northern Saami) paired with four major languages which are im-
portant for these communities (English, Finnish, Hungarian, Russian) and to deploy
the enriched lexical material on the web in the framework of the collaborative dictio-
nary project Wiktionary.

Even for widely used languages, freely available professional online multilingual
lexical data are scarce; exceptions being BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) and
open wordnets in a variety of languages, such as Multilingual Central Repository
(Atserias et al., 2004) and MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002). Smaller communities are
often left to their own devices, which can manifest in their affinity towards mastering
other languages to be able to translate or localize information that is unavailable in
their native language.

In the current global economic and information space, we interact via new types
of media, applications of which are e.g. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and
other Wikimedia-related initiatives. Social media, powered by Web 2.0 technology
– which actively involves language technology –, are becoming extremely popular,
not only in the Western world where they typically originate from, but also among
virtually any speech communities with internet connection. The new concepts that
are brought to the smaller language communities – such as speakers of FU minor-
ity languages – are likely impact everyday lives to a bigger extent than in the case
of larger speech communities, shifting new segments of native language use towards
“globalized” language use. It is an empirical question to what extent, and which di-
mensions of the language of these speech communities – having been heavily affected
by neighboring or dominating language contacts already – will be pervaded (or even
corrupted) by the usage of new media.

Wiktionary¹ is a collaborative multilingual dictionary project, a sister project of
Wikipedia, available under the same license (CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GNU Free Documen-
tation License). It aims to describe all words of all languages. It has editions in sev-

eral languages using definitions and descriptions in the given language. Entries that
are being maintained by a large active digital community are typically fully-fledged,
whereas entries in the language domain of a small community can be very sparse, or
missing. This situation can be improved by applying language technology methods
and automatically creating Wiktionary entries. Using the Wiktionary infrastructure,
lexical entries across FU and widely used language versions of Wiktionary can be
interlinked. This will enable user communities to access rich, networked lexical ma-
terial.

The aforementioned FU languages are under-resourced, hence we could not col-
lect enough data for building parallel and comparable corpora, on which the standard
dictionary building methods are based. Therefore, conducting experiments with al-
ternative methods was needed. We made experiments with several lexicon building
methods utilizing crowd-sourced language resources, such as Wikipedia and Wik-
tionary (see Section 2). Completely automatic generation of clean bilingual resources
is not possible according to the state of the art, but it is possible to create certain
lexical resources, termed proto-dictionaries, that can support lexicographic and NLP
work. Proto-dictionaries contain candidate translation pairs produced by bilingual
dictionary building methods.

Once the proto-dictionaries were prepared, they were merged for each language
pair and repeated lines were filtered out. These files were then the object of manual
validation by native speakers and linguist experts of the languages. These validated
dictionaries containing translation units were the input of generating newWiktionary
entries which were created fully automatically. As the last step of the project, we
upload the entries to Wiktionary.

The rest of the article is as follows. In Section 2, the workflow of generating the
translation units is shortly presented. Section 3 gives an overview of the process
how the Wiktionary entries are generated from the previously created translation
units. In Section 4, the steps of uploading the newly created entries are described. We
conducted a thorough evaluation of the coverage for proto-dictionaries created by us,
which is described in Section 5. The article ends with some conclusions and plans for
future work in Section 6.

2 Generating the Translation Units
For the creation of the proto-dictionaries, we applied several lexicon building meth-
ods utilizing Wikipedia and Wiktionary. For more details on the dictionary creating
methods we used, see Benyeda et al. (2016) and Simon and Mittelholcz (2017) – here
we only provide a short description.

Wikipedia is not only the largest publicly available database of comparable doc-
uments, but it also can be used for bilingual lexicon extraction in several ways. Fol-
lowing Erdmann et al. (2009), we created bilingual dictionaries from Wikipedia title
pairs using the interwiki links.

Besides Wikipedia, Wiktionary is also considered as a crowd-sourced language
resource which can serve as a source of bilingual dictionary extraction. Although
Wiktionary is primarily for human audience, the extraction of underlying data can be
automated to a certain degree. Following Ács et al. (2013) and Ács (2014), we applied
the Wikt2dict tool² in two modes. First, we parsed the English, Finnish, Russian
and Hungarian editions of Wiktionary and extracted translations from the so-called

²https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict

42

translation tables for the small FU languages we deal with. Second, the collection of
translation pairs were expanded with a triangulation method, which is based on the
assumption that two expressions are likely to be translations, if they are translations
of the same word in a third language.

Besides the proto-dictionaries created by us, the large merged files for the North-
ern Saami–{English, Finnish, Hungarian} language pairs also contain proto-dictionaries
which were not created by us but were downloaded from the Opus corpus (Tiede-
mann, 2009). These dictionaries contain word pairs from the automatic word align-
ment created with GIZA++ and the Moses toolkit.

Once the proto-dictionaries were prepared, they were merged for each language
pair and repeated lines were filtered out. These raw dictionary files were then the
object of manual validation by native speakers and linguist experts of the languages.
The instructions for the validators were as follows. The source and the target word
must be a valid word in the language concerned, they must be dictionary forms, and
they must be translations of each other. If the source word is not a valid source lan-
guage word, the word pair is treated as wrong. If the source word is a valid word
but not a dictionary form, the correct dictionary form should be manually added. If
the target word is a good translation of the source word but is not a dictionary form,
similarly to the former case, the correct dictionary form should be added. If the target
word is not a good translation, a new translation should be given.

The validated dictionaries, however, were not fully clean and ready-to-use, thus
several checking and correcting steps were required. As a sanity check, we checked
whether the dictionary contains a source and a target word, whether any cells contain
suspicious characters, etc. As a consistency check, cases when the target word was
providedwith a dictionary form aswell as a new translation and caseswhen the source
word was treated as wrong but a new translation were added for the target word
were filtered out. A cross-language consistency check was also done, in which we
checked whether source words were treated consistently in all languages. At the end
of this workflow, we got the validated dictionaries containing the translation units,
which served then as the input of the evaluation and the newly generatedWiktionary
entries.

3 Generating the Wiktionary Entries
The manually validated word pairs were used as the source material of newly cre-
ated potential Wiktionary entries, which contain several obligatory elements. These
elements containing morphological and phonetical information were generated fully
automatically. For example, in the case of the Northern Saami–English language pair,
the Northern Saami word would be an entry in the English Wiktionary: the title of
the entry would be the Northern Saami word, while its English definition would be
its English translation equivalent.

Each language edition of Wiktionary has its own rules that describe how to create
new entries. These determine the structure of the entries and the pieces of information
which must be included in each entry. From these descriptions of the fourWiktionary
editions into which our entries were uploaded, a generalized description was created
that contains the word itself, its language, its POS tag, and its translation equivalent.
The only information missing from that list is the POS tag, which could be gathered
from morphological analyzers available for these languages. Additional information
can also be added to the entries, such as etymology or phonetic (IPA) transcription,



43

however, these are not compulsory elements. IPA transcription is also included in
our entries, since these FU languages have freely available tools that provide phonetic
transcription and we wanted to enrich the Wiktionary entries with as many pieces of
linguistic information as possible applying only automatic tools.

3.1 Providing POS Tags

New Wiktionary entries cannot be created without applying templates, which are
provided for several word categories including POS classes. Therefore, providing the
correct POS tag of a word is essential for generating aWiktionary entry for that word.
POS tags can be gathered from the output of morphological analyzers available for
the languages we deal with. However, these are only words without context, thus the
standard morphosyntactic disambiguation techniques based on contextual informa-
tion cannot be used. Therefore, we had to find alternative ways for disambiguation,
see Section 3.2.

There are available morphological analyzers for all languages we deal with that
we could use to get POS tags for the words. We used the morphological analyzers of
Giellatekno³ for all of the source languages and for Finnish and Russian of the tar-
get languages. For Hungarian, we used the emMorph morphological analyzer (Novák
et al., 2016), which is also based on the Helsinki Finite-State Technology⁴ infrastruc-
ture just like the Giellatekno analyzers. For English, we used the hunmorph toolkit
(Trón et al., 2005) with English-specific aff and dic files created from English lex-
icon and grammar files of morphdb, an open source morphological database (Trón
et al., 2006). Since we work with different kinds of morphological analyzers provid-
ing different output formats, a kind of normalization of tags was needed. Having the
normalized tagset, there is no difference in the format of analyses, so that the tags can
be used in further steps without having different notations for the same POS tag.

Due to the fact that morphological analyzers only give analysis for single words,
multi-word expressions (MWEs) had to be handled differently. In these cases, the last
element of the MWE was split, and the MWE was temporarily substituted by its last
word. The hypothesis behind this solution is that FU languages are typically head-
final languages, thus the head follows its complements, i.e. the head is at the end of
the phrase. Therefore, if we get the POS tag of the last element of the phrase, we
will know the POS tag of the whole phrase. However, English and Russian are said
to be strongly head-initial languages, moreover, even the FU phrase is not always
head-final, thus the last element of a MWE in our dictionaries is not always the head.
Handling of this phenomenon is described in Section 3.2.

Some validators inserted the particle ‘to’ before the English translation of verbs.
This particle was removed from the input of the morphological analyzer but was kept
as a background info and was used in the disambiguating step. The English analyzer
gives back many possible analyses for a single word, since most of the English words
can be a noun and a verb at the same time. There are cases when the disambiguation
is difficult or almost impossible without this extra information. In the English Wik-
tionary, the ‘to’ particle must be included in the definition before each English verb,
therefore they are later pasted back before the verb.

The output of this process contains five columns that consist of the source word,
its possible POS tags, the target word, its possible POS tags and a column that contains
information about the ‘to’ particle.

3.2 Disambiguating the POS Tags

Disambiguating the POS tags happens in circles. First, we only consider the morpho-
logical information of the given word. The second step of the POS disambiguation is
a horizontal comparison, when the POS tags of a source word and the POS tags of the
corresponding target word are compared, and we get the disambiguated POS tag from
this comparison. The third step is a vertical comparison, in which the sets of POS tags
added to a word acting as a source word in more translation units are compared.

3.2.1 Considering the Morphological Information

Not only the POS tag of the output of the morphological analyzers are utilized, but
we keep the lemma, and information on the case and the number. When a word has
more than one analysis, a decision has to be made, and these pieces of morphological
information can help in this process.

A kind of filtering is possible based on the assumption that the lemma and the
input word are the same. Since only dictionary forms were sent to the analyzers,
those tags that are the analysis of a non-dictionary form are rejected. For example, in
Hungarian, the dictionary form is the nominative singular form in the case of nouns
and adjectives and the present 3rd person singular indefinite form in the case of verbs.
For example, if the input word is várat, the possible analyses are vár[/N] + at[Acc],
and vár[/V] + at[_Caus/V] + [Prs.NDef.3Sg], thus the POS tag can only be V
(verb), since the other one is an accusative word form, not a dictionary form.

However, there are cases when none of the lemmas is equal to the input word. In
the case of MWEs, the lemma is only the last element of the input word, and there-
fore they must match at the end of the string. If none of the analyses matches the
conditions, the set of possible POS tags is left empty.

A filtering happens at the end of this stage, because there are cases when a word
gets more than one POS tag, and yet, it can contain redundant information. We keep
the POS tags that are the most precise ones, e.g. if the set of POS tags contains both N
and Prop (proper noun), then N is removed from the set.

3.2.2 Horizontal Comparison

In this step, the disambiguation of POS tags happen based on the comparison of the
POS tag set of the source word and that of the target word. A translation pair has two
sets of possible POS tags, and assuming that the words participating in a translation
pair belong to the same POS, these tags can be reduced in number.

However, it is not correct in all cases. Not all source words has a one-word trans-
lation in the target language, and in such cases, the validator gave aMWE that seemed
to be the most correct translation of the source word. Since MWEs may not have the
head at the end of the phrase, they do not belong to the same POS as the original
word.

Within the horizontal comparison, we investigate the intersection of the POS tag
set of the source word and that of the target word. The following cases come from
this comparison.

When the intersection of the two sets does not contain any POS tags, a decision
has to be made in order to get some results for those translation units as well. Once,
if the analyzer did not provide any output for the source word, it is the target word
that determines the POS tag of the translation. Second, if the set of POS tags of the
target word is empty, the source word is the one that determines. In those cases, when



45

neither of the words has a possible tag, the translation candidate has to be removed,
because no correct POS tag can be provided.

Another possible difficulty is that a single POS tag cannot be determined because
of the fact that English and Hungarian phrases were split up by the last space, and
although in Hungarian the head of a phrase is likely to be at the end, in English it
is only so in some noun phrases. If the target word is a MWE, the target language
is English, and the possible POS tags do not contain the N tag, these candidates are
removed from the list of possible Wiktionary entries.

If the intersection of the two sets contains only one element, it is treated as the cor-
rect POS tag for that translation pair. If a correct POS tag is found, the result is saved
into a list with the source word, because it may be used in the vertical comparison.

When the translation pair has more than one POS tag in common, the number of
common tags is tried to be reduced by some rules. One of them is based on that the
verbs of the FU languages have a particular ending (e.g. Northern Saami verbs end
with ‘-t’), so if the source word has this verb ending, and the V tag is found among the
common tags, then the source word is possibly a verb and is marked as that.

The number of the common POS tags can also be reduced for verbs, if the fifth
column in the input contained the word ‘TO’. It means that the validator inserted an
extra ‘to’ before the English target word. Since it is a manually added information, it
is assumed to be a reliable information about the POS of the word.

3.2.3 Vertical Comparison

When the sets of the POS tags of the source word and that of the target word have
only one POS tag in common, the result is saved in a list with the source word, and
it can be used for disambiguation. This is based on the observation that if a source
word occurs in more than one translation unit, its corresponding target words are
synonyms in most of the cases. Therefore, we assumed that the source word has the
same POS tag in all of the translation units. When two sets have more than one POS
tag in common, it is checked whether the source word has a former meaning with
only one possible tag.

There are, however, cases when each translation unit with the same source word
has multiple POS tags. In this case, the aforementioned method cannot be used, but
those can still be disambiguated, if their sets are compared. For example, the Komi-
Permyak word ань has three different equivalents in English: female, mother, and
woman. These words have different sets of POS tags, namely female is marked as a
N and as an A (adjective), while mother and woman have the tags N and V. The inter-
section of these three sets is undoubtedly N. A specific case of this is when the source
word and the target word also have more POS tags, and all of them are correct. For
example, the Meadow Mari word нарынче (‘yellow’) is an adjective and a noun, just
like in English. In these cases, both tags are kept.

This process outputs three columns: the source word, the target word, and the
correct POS tag. If a translation unit has more than one POS tag, the first two columns
are repeated, thus it is treated as a new translation unit.

3.3 Adding IPA Transcription

The next step was to gather phonetic transcription to enrich the content of Wik-
tionary entries. We used theMariWeb Project’s automatic transcription tool (Bradley,
2017) for generating IPA transcription for Hill Mari, Meadow Mari, Komi-Permyak,



46

Komi-Zyrian, and Udmurt. For Northern Saami, we used an FST compiled from the
text2ipa source files of the Giellatekno infrastructure⁵.

All of the source FU languages has a transcription tool available, so every source
word was sent to the tool and the result was saved so that it could be used when
generating entries. The only problem occurred when the string contained digits and
when proper nouns were sent to the transcription tool. Since the pronunciation of
proper nouns might differ from the phonetics of the language, IPA transcription was
not added to entries having only a proper noun as POS tag or entries having a digit
in the source word.

3.4 Putting the Bits Together

Having all pieces of information, the next step is putting them together thus generat-
ing the final entries to be uploaded to Wiktionary in the last step. Although different
editions of Wiktionary have different rules determining the structure of the articles, it
was possible to create a template that covers all four editions to which the generated
entries would be uploaded. (Consider that the languages called as target languages so
far are now the languages of the Wiktionary editions to which the entries containing
source words are to be uploaded.)

Before generating actual entries, it must be checked whether the word already
exists in Wiktionary, and some further modifications concerning the existing data
also had to be made. First, those words that already exist in the given edition of
Wiktionary are filtered out: entries for those words which are in the last Wiktionary
dump are not generated. Second, if a source word has more than one translation,
the translation units can have the same POS tag, and in this case, they must be listed
under the same POS header. If the translation unit has more than one POS tag, the
translation must be repeated under each POS header in the entry.

After having extracted the words to be uploaded and having the list of translations
for each POS tag, entries can be created. Each entry has a headword which is the
source word. When uploading to Wiktionary, Pywikibot (see Section 4) will create
a page that has the same name as this headword. Each entry contains one or more
POS headers, and one or more translations under each header. If a source word is an
existing word in more languages, then these two (or more) entries have to be merged
and listed under the same headword. At the end of this step, an output file is created
which meets the requirements of the input file of Pywikibot.

4 Uploading the Entries
Uploading multiple entries to Wiktionary can be automated. MediaWiki has a bot
called Pywikibot⁶, that can automate work on MediaWiki sites such as Wiktionary
or Wikipedia. This library has a script called pagefromfile⁷, which allows to create
pages on Wiktionary (or other MediaWiki sites) from text files. That script reads the
file and recognizes the template that can be configured, and it will create Wiktionary
entries according to these. Each page must be separated by some characters, and each
headword is used to define the name of the page. We run it with the option --safe,

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/pagefromfile.py


47

which means that if a certain page already exists, the bot will not upload or refresh
the existing page but skips it.

Fully automated uploading of large amounts of newly created Wiktionary entries
is however not supported in the Wiktionary community. We have to ask the admin-
istrators of each Wiktionary edition to allow us to upload our entries. Unfortunately,
we did not get the permission from all Wiktionary editions, therefore, now we can
only provide numbers based on the last downloaded Wiktionary dumps, see Table 1.

5 Evaluation
Themanual validation and correction of the automatically generated proto-dictionaries
has a twofold aim. First, the performance of dictionary creating methods can be com-
pared. For more details on the results, see Simon and Mittelholcz (2017). Second, we
get the number of word pairs which can be used for upload to the Wiktionary. In this
section, we provide a thorough evaluation of generating Wiktionary entries.

Measuring of the coverage of a dictionary is far from trivial. It can be measured
by comparing it to a word list of a corpus, or to a frequency list generated from a
corpus. Or, it can be measured by comparing the number of its entries to that of
another – ideally hand-crafted – dictionary. Since our newly created word pairs are
to be transformed intoWiktionary articles, for this purpose, here we usedWiktionary,
which is not an expert-built lexicon but manually edited by thousands of contributors.

Table 1 contains the figures for this evaluation. We use ISO 639-3 language codes
for the individual languages: koi: Komi-Permyak, kpv: Komi-Zyrian, mhr: Meadow
Mari, mrj: Hill Mari, sme: Northern Saami, udm: Udmurt; eng: English, fin: Finnish,
hun: Hungarian, rus: Russian. However, several Wiktionary editors do not differ-
entiate between individual languages but use macrolanguage codes (chm for Mari
languages, kom for Komi languages), therefore we had to merge the dictionaries for
the two Mari and for the two Komi languages.

The first column of the table (‘all’) shows the total number of word pairs gathered
with all methods for the language pair. As can be seen, hundreds or thousands of
translation candidates were generated for each language pair. However, not all of
these word pairs are correct translation candidates, therefore we needed to extract
the useful word pairs from the merged dictionary for each language pair. The second
column (‘useful’) shows the number of useful word pairs which comprise all word
pairs except of the ones in which the source word is not a valid word, since correct
dictionary forms and translation equivalents were manually added by human valida-
tors.

As mentioned above, our Wiktionary articles are generated fully automatically.
The POS tag of an entry is a compulsory element of an article, which is gathered
from the output of morphological analyzers through several disambiguating steps, as
detailed in Section 3.1 and 3.2. The number of the useful word pairs drops in line with
the increase of source language words for which we could not provide a POS tag.
Before uploading new entries, it must be checked whether an entry with the same
word already exists in Wiktionary. If yes, it also decreases the number of uploadable
word pairs. Column ‘remain’ contains the decreased number of the word pairs ready
to upload. We have also got the number of the source language words already existing
in the target language Wiktionary (‘wikt’), along with the number of the words being
in both lists (‘comm’). These numbers come from the Wiktionary dumps⁸ and are

⁸Wiktionary dumps used in the evaluation: eng: 06-Nov-2017, fin: 05-Nov-2017, rus: 07-Nov-2017, hun:



48

“theoretical” numbers in the sense that they are not the numbers of actually uploaded
entries, which can only be known after uploading.

From the columns ‘wikt’ and ‘comm’, the number of brand new entries (‘new’)
created by us can be easily counted, along with a kind of coverage (‘cover’), which
is a ratio of the number of common words to the number of words already being in
Wiktionary, thus it is the degree of overlap with Wiktionary. Consider that the cov-
erage for each language pair drops as the size of the relevant Wiktionary grows. The
last column (‘improv’) contains the ratio of the number of the newWiktionary entries
to one of the already existing ones which shows the improvement in the amount of
Wiktionary entries of the given source language in the given target language edition
of Wiktionary.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
Wiktionary is not only used for extracting data from it, but wewant to give our results
back to the community, thus translation pairs enriched with obligatory pieces of lin-
guistic information are to uploaded as new entries into Wiktionary. Before uploading
new entries, it is needed to be checked whether an entry with the same word already
exists in Wiktionary. From this, the number of brand new entries created by us can
be easily counted, along with a kind of coverage and improvement in the number of
Wiktionary entries. As can be seen from the results, the latter is very impressive,
thus, with our dictionaries, we would multiply the number of Wiktionary entries in
the aforementioned FU minority languages. Since automatic uploading of entries is

not supported by theWiktionary community, we have to ask for permission to upload
our newly created entries into Wiktionary.

We provide freely available professional online multilingual lexical data for digi-
tal communities of some FU minority languages with Wiktionary entries. However,
lexical data can be provided in several other ways. We plan to make them available in
standard data formats (e.g. tsv, XML) which are easy to apply in further lexicographic
or NLP subtasks. We also want to convert our data into the data format following the
conventions of linguistic linked open data and provide them via our web site or via
the repositories of dictionary families such as Giellatekno and Apertium.
