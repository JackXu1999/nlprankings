Abstract

In this paper, we investigate how topic dy-
namics during the course of an interaction
correlate with the power differences be-
tween its participants. We perform this
study on the US presidential debates and
show that a candidate’s power, modeled
after their poll scores, affects how often
he/she attempts to shift topics and whether
he/she succeeds. We ensure the validity
of topic shifts by confirming, through a
simple but effective method, that the turns
that shift topics provide substantive topi-
cal content to the interaction. A paper de-
scribing this work is published in the ACL
2014 Joint Workshop on Social Dynamics
and Personal Attributes in Social Media.
