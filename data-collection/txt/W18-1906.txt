Training, feedback and 
productivity measurement 
with NMT and Adaptive MT

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 13



Why?

• Why MT — does it make sense for everybody?
• And if so, why do companies choose to train MT engines over existing 

generic ones?

• Why do we need to measure productivity and collect other data and 
does it impact our processes?

Industry Challenges

• Many MT providers
• Lack of integrated benchmarks 
• Little usable feedback to project participants
• Small organizations (LSPs and End-Users) left behind

• Generally no in-house expertise
• Training engines takes time and data, and is expensive!

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 15



• Various technologies each with their own advantages and flaws
• RBMT
• SMT
• NMT
• Adaptive MT

• Some MT providers add the option to 
train or customize engines

• CAT Tools do a low level integration 
of many of these MT engines of don’t 
support them at all

Many MT Providers – Decisions, 
decisions...

How do we choose?

• Most process participants simply default to the easiest option in their 
CAT tools

• Other rely on the opinion or preferences of their post-editors – but 
how reliable is that when for example NMT’s fluency can distort an 
evaluation?

• Pricing is important!

Lack of Integrated Scoring

• Multiple MT scoring systems
• BLEU
• METEOR
• LEPOR

• These scores are not available in CAT tools.
• Scores for engine trained on an unknown corpus can be 

unreliable and scores for generic engines vary with time.

Or Benchmarks!

• Quality evaluation approaches used for human translation 
cannot be used for quality evaluation of the machine translation.

• Do we create new rating systems (MQM comes to mind)
• How do we make them available to participants?

• What other metrics could assist project participants?
• Effort/Productivity/Prices
• QA reports

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 19



Solutions

• Integration of benchmark in the CAT tool interface
• Display standard scores
• And possible custom scores
• Add pricing calculations to the mix!

• Calculate and display PEMT productivity numbers:
• For each MT engine integrated in 

the CAT tool
• For individual translators on various 

MT engines
• Produce after-action reports

The Adaptive MT Conundrum

• Standard scoring system cannot score the adaptiveness of the 
engine.

• Productivity metrics can still be produced but should vary more 
than with other engine types.

• Can we devise a new metrics
• Adaptive Factor?
• Other methods

Feedback – Project Managers

How useful could the access to these metrics be for 
project managers?

• Select the best potential MT engine for each language pair/topic
at the best price

• Use productivity and QA reports to assist in task assignment
• More accurate costs analysis around MT and PEMT
• Better deadline predictions

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 22



Feedback – Translators

How about for the translators?
• Lower reluctance to use MT when presented with updated

productivity numbers

• A new evaluation of the per word pricing
• In the context of a marketplace, more information for the potential 

buyers or higher ranking for the translator

• Improve training using reviewed “after action” reports and
productivity benchmarks

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 23



Next Steps

Additional process automation – not only can project be 
created automatically but:

• The best possible MT resources can be allocated automatically
by the system.

• Translators can be assigned to the tasks without human interaction
to match deadline and cost requirements.

• Real-time productivity numbers can be used to re-allocate
translation resources as needed

Small Organization Access

• Generally no in-house experience
• Training performant engines takes data,

time and expenses

• Not practical for temporary needs

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 25



Solutions

Utilize the marketplace model:

• Trained MT engine marketplace
• Real-time scores and productivity benchmarks
• Data source information

• Training data marketplace – already in place
• PEMT vendors marketplace – partially in place

• Real-time productivity benchmarks
• QA reports and feedback
