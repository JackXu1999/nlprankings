ABSTRACT 

This paper presents the disambiguation of preposition in English to the corresponding post 
positions in Malayalam while translating text from English to Malayalam. Preposition in 
English will be replaced with post position in Indian Languages during translation. The 
polysemous nature of prepositions in English increases the difficulty in determining its exact 
meaning/function. This makes the task of mapping a preposition in English to an Indian 
language difficult, particularly for machine translation. Research or works on one to one 
mapping of English prepositions to Malayalam postpositions are not done for Malayalam. In 
this paper we illustrate the patterns of preposition mapping from English to Malayalam and 
present context disambiguation rules for determining the right mapping of different prepositions 
in English to postposition in Malayalam.

1. INTRODUCTION 
It has been observed that almost all postpositions in Malayalam function as case endings. 
Postpositions in Malayalam occur after the nominal. They perform similar to inflectional 
markers. But unlike inflectional markers, postpositions in Malayalam are free forms. Being 
invariants, they can stand alone or alongside another free or bound morpheme. Postpositions (PP) 
in Malayalam [1], [2], [3] are certain forms, which occur immediately after nouns and establish 
some grammatical relations between the nouns and the verbs of the sentences. In English, the 
semantic distribution of a single preposition will be varying in different context due to the 
influence of nouns and main verbs that follow. When an English preposition is translated into 
Malayalam, the following transformation takes place:  
(preposition) (object) � � (object) [(inflection)][(postpositional-word)].  

I played with Ram. � � ŋa:n ra:manre ku:te kaliccu (��� �����	 
��� 
���)  

In the example given above the object is modified with a suffix and postposition after it. It is not 
necessary that both suffix and the postpositional equivalent word occur simultaneously. They 
may occur independently or together. It will depend on the type of object and verb.  

The factors that determine the generation of appropriate postposition in Malayalam for a 
preposition in English is discussed in detail in this paper. 

The correspondence between English prepositions and Malayalam postpositions (inflections and 
postpositional words) is not direct. The reference object plays a major role in determining the 
correct preposition sense. Reference object will decide whether the preposition is used in a 
spatial sense or other sense. A noun phrase (NP) denoting a place gives rise to a spatial 
postposition. Similarly, an object referring to a time entity produces a temporal expression.  

For instance, a preposition with can have multiple mapping patterns in Malayalam, as shown 
below. 

Example (1) 

a.  [with = kont(�
���)] 

I wrote with the pen. 

ŋa:n pe:na kont1  eYuwi. 

��� ��� �
��� ����� 

(I) (pen)      (PP)          (Write PST) 

b.  [with = kute(����)] 

Radha went with Gopi. 

ra:dha  go:piyute  kute  pOyi. 

��� 
������� ���� 
��� 

(Radha)  (Gopi)                 (PP)     (go PAST) 

c.  [with = pakkal/vaSaM(���/���)] 

                                                 
1 One of the reviewer mentioned that ‘kontu’ is an instrumental case and not postposition, but in 
the paper “An Introduction to postposition in Malayalam for POS tagging” by Dr. S 
Radhakrishnan Nair mentioned that it is a postposition.

Sita has no money with her. 

si:wayute  pakkal/vaSaM  panamilla. 

������� ���/� ! �"��#$. 

(sita)               (PP)                      (money NEG) 

d.  [with = Ayi] 

 A bus collided with a car. 

  bass  ka:ruma:yi  kuttiyiticcu. 

�� ������	
 ���
	

�� 

 (bus)     (car PP)                (collide PAST) 

e.  [with = nZe(��	)] 

What is the problem with you? 

ninre praSnaM  entha:N ? 

����	 %�&�! �'�(? 

(you PP)     (problem)   (what QP)         

From the above said examples we notice that the preposition with in English can be mapped in 
Malayalam in multiple ways. This is one of the challenging tasks in machine translation. The 
different functions of the prepositions need to be disambiguated for their correct mapping in 
machine translation. In example (1) above, the mapping patterns between English preposition 
and Malayalam postpositions can be resolved by taking into consideration semantic type of the 
main verb and that of the nominal elements in the sentence. In (1a) we can see that ‘write’ is a 
verb that requires an instrument to carry out the action. So the agent is given the post position 
‘kont’. Similarly for (1b) the verb ‘went’ is a directed motion verb. Here this will map with the 
post position ‘kute’. In (1c), ‘have’ is a contain verb. We can map this with the PP 
‘vaSaM/pakkal’. In (1d) ‘collide’ is a correspond verb, this can be mapped with the PP ‘a:yi’. 
Here we pointed out the disambiguation of the preposition ‘with’ in English with the 
corresponding postposition equivalent in Malayalam in the translation context. This will be 
applicable to all Indian languages. The first step in disambiguation is identifying the class of 
verbs and the semantics of noun phrase (NP) coming as a subject and/object. Then map the 
preposition accordingly. A similar approach can be followed to other polysemic prepositions 
also.  

In section 4 we present some common patterns of mapping of prepositions from English to 
Malayalam with respect to selected prepositions. In section 5 we present the major strategies that 
can be used to handle different preposition mapping patterns that we present in section 4.  

2. RELATED WORKS ON POSTPOSITIONS 
There is not much works has been taken up for the disambiguation of postpositions in Malayalam 
in the computational aspect. Lilaatilakam of 14th century A.D is considered as the earliest work 
which describes Malayalam grammar. Gundert does not use the term ‘postpositions’ but 
identifies some ‘Noun Particles which are used with case suffixes. Caldwell has described 
various aspects of case system in Malayalam. Every postposition in his opinion affixed with a 
case will express a new case relation. The number of cases in Malayalam therefore depends upon 
the requirements of the speaker and the different shades of meaning he wishes to express. He

also points out that postpositions are in reality separate words and they retain traces of their 
original character as auxiliary nouns. Rev. George Mathan includes postpositions in 
taddhitaavyaya (derived connectives) ie, particles derived from nouns or verbs. Among the 150 
taddhitaavyayas which he listed, only a few are seemed to be postpositions. Raja Raja Varma 
defines postpositions (gati) as a particle which modifies cases. He differentiated between case 
affixes and postpositions and uses the term ‘misravibhakti’ (mixed case) to indicate cases with 
postpositions. He also observes that the postpositions are not originally particles (nipaata) but 
particles derived from nouns or verbs (avyayas). Seshagiriprabhu describes the case system of 
Malayalam elaborately. He defines postpositions as certain words added to the case affixes to 
indicate special meaning and he lists eighty postpositions and classified them on the basis of the 
case affixes. 
Similar work has been done for English-Hindi language pair as part of AnglaBharati Machine 
Translation system development by RMK Sinha et al. In that work the authors clearly mentioned 
the different prepositions in English and their effect on the target language as postpositions. The 
paper mainly focused on the language Hindi. For the language like Malayalam, an agglutinative 
language, some more factors must be taken in to consideration. 

3. AN OVERVIEW OF THE ENGLISH MALAYALAM MACHINE 
TRANSLATION SYSTEM(ANGLAMT)  

AnglaMT is a rule based machine translation system based on AnglaBharti technology 
developed by IIT Kanpur. It takes the English input sentences and passes through the 
preprocessor module for handling different formats like date, time, acronyms, abbreviations, etc. 
After preprocessing input text, the system will take all the syntactic and semantic information 
from the lexical database and processed further in the Morphological analyzer module. There 
after it goes through the rule base module. In rule base module, based on the information fetched 
from the morphological analyzer, the sentence gets parsed and generates an interlingua 
representation. It is generally known as PLIL (Pseudo Lingua for Indian Languages). PLIL will 
have the word order as that of target language. Here English is having subject-verb-object (SVO) 
pattern where as Malayalam is having the subject-Object-Verb (SOV) pattern. PLIL contain the 
root words of the source and target language along with their syntactic and semantic information. 
This PLIL is going to the text generator as input and text generator is adding the necessary 
suffixes and other target language dependant words. Depending on the complexity and multiple 
meaning for a word the system will generate alternate translations. This can be post edited 
manually as per the user requirement. 

4. FEATURES OF POSTPOSITIONS 
Postpositions in a Malayalam indicate case relations. It can be separated from noun phrases by 
coordinate conjunctions. They can be followed by case affixes. Normally they are disyllabic or 
polysyllabic and cannot take auxiliary verbs. Postpositions cannot be separated from noun 
phrases by morphemes other than coordinate conjunction. They cannot replace the present 
participial –e by temporal um + po:l. They are not having the grammatical inflection that is they 
are indeclinable. Prepositions will not be head of an endocentric construction and cannot be 
modified by adjectives. They occur only after nouns. They will be deleted in relativization. They 
cannot occur in the initial position of a sentence and cannot occur immediately after another 
postposition. They will be an immediate constituent of noun phrases. 

5. MAPPING PATTERNS OF COMMONLY USED PREPOSITIONS 
Consider some of the very commonly used prepositions to inorder to show the patterns of their 
mapping in Malayalam.

to: The preposition to in English can be mapped by different postpositions in Malayalam. The 
examples are listed in (2) to (6). 
(2) [to = e:kk] 
 The procession goes to Kottayam. 
  Ja:tha ko:ttayathile:kk po:kunnu. 
 ��� ������

6. RULES FOR DISAMBIGUATION OF MULTIPLE PATTERNS OF 
PREPOSITIONS 

In this section we propose rules for the disambiguation of the above said (section 2) examples 
having multiple mappings of prepositions. The examples clearly show the difficulty in mapping 
English prepositions to Malayalam postpositions in machine translation. The two major factors 
that determine the meaning of a preposition are the semantic type of the main verb and that of the 
nominal elements that occur with the prepositions. The syntactic and semantic information are 
extracted from the bilingual lexical database in the system. The dictionary contains more than 
50000 entries. The structure of the dictionary entry is as given below: 

1. abdication 
2. 46 noun 
3. ~G abdication 
4. [activity] 
5. pariwyAgaM:2 
6. *** 

First line is the English root word, second line contains the POS category and its inflection 
information as a category number, third line is the English meaning, fourth line is the semantic 
information, fifth line is the Malayalam root word and its paradigm number that represents the 
inflection of a noun based on its case and number. 

97



We present some of the sample rules that are used to disambiguate prepositions. We use the 
semantic category of verb and noun to disambiguate the multiple patterns of the prepositions. 
 
Disambiguation of to: As mentioned in section 2, the preposition to have different mappings in 
Malayalam. Rules for generating the correct mappings are illustrated below for the examples 
presented in section 2.  

 a. to-NP (place) = NP- e:kk (2) 

 b. to-NP(human) = NP-o:t (3) 

 c. verb(motion) to-NP = NP- atuthe:kk  (4) 

 d. verb(mental) to-NP = NP-e (5) 

 e.to-NP(activity/concept) = NP-kk (6) 

In a similar manner, rules for disambiguation of from, at, in, through, for, by, of and on are given 
below:  

 f. from-NP = NP-ninn  (7) 

 g. from-NP(place/time) = NP-muthal (8) 

 h. at-NP(human) = NP-ne:rkk (9) 

 i. at-NP(place) = NP-il (10)-(11) 

 j. in-NP(time) = NP-il (12) 

 k. in-NP(currency) = NP-a:yi (13) 

 l. in-NP(natural) = NP-ath (14)  

 m. through-NP(place) = NP-kuti (15) 

 n. through-NP(thing) = NP-ute (16) 

 o. for-NP(human) = NP-ve:nti (17) 

 p. for-NP(time) = NP-e:kk (18) 

 q. NP1-by-NP2 (time) = NP2-o:te (19) 

 r. NP1 (place)-by-NP2 (place) = NP2-vaYi (20) 

 s. by-NP(quantitative) = NP-kaNakkin (21) 

 t. of-NP(human_group) = NP-il (22) 

 u. of-NP(concept) = NP-ulla (23) 

 v. verb(resultive) of NP(illness) = NP-a:l(24) 

 w. on-NP(concept/activity/thing) = NP-il (25) 

 x. on-NP(topic) = NP-parri (26) 

The disambiguation methods discussed above are based on information about the type of verb 
and the noun in the relevant structure. In the above explained disambiguation rules, we can see 
that the case markers (genitive, dative, sociative, locative, instrumental, accusative and 
nominative) are handled appropriately based on the context. A sample example on how the above 
constraints can be formulated is illustrated in a tabular form (Table 1).

7. RESULTS 
All the examples illustrated above are taken from the output generated by the machine translation 
system developed by us. The performance of the system evaluated with a set of about 3000 
sentences. The sentences are selected randomly from the corpus collected in the tourism and 
health domain from different articles and from the internet. The sentences are translated using the 
MT system developed and then evaluated using the five point scale manually. The ranking points 
are described below: 

0 - No output provided by the engine concerned. 

1 - The translated output is not comprehensible. 

2 - Comprehensible after accessing the English text. 

3 - Comprehensible with difficulty. 

4 - The text is comprehensible.

Depending on the complexity of the sentence the output may contain all the possible alternate 
translations. This may vary from one sentence to hundreds of sentences. If the sentence is not 
grammatically correct and is extremely complex in nature, then the possibility of getting its 
translation is less. We have considered the first five translations for the evaluation. The 
evaluation done based on the methodology developed by C-DAC Pune. Fig. 4 below shows the 
sample output of the MAT system. 

Figure 4. Sample output of the MAT system 

The system will give more than 70% accuracy for the simple sentences and about 50-55% 
accuracy for the complex sentences.  The accuracy of the system customized for Malayalam is at 
par with the system that is originally designed for Indo-Aryan language family. 

Conclusions 

In this paper we have examined the contexts for the multiple meanings of the prepositions in 
English and their mapping patterns in Malayalam. On the basis of the semantic category of 
preceding and following nouns of the preposition and the category of verb, we have made an 
attempt to disambiguate the multiple meanings of selected prepositions. The work is 
implemented in the English Malayalam Machine Aided Translation system using AnglaBharati 
Technology developed by IIT Kanpur.  

However, it is difficult to find out the translation equivalence for some of the prepositions in 
English, when we try to do the translation process especially for machine translation. For 
comprehensive rule we need further finer semantic categorization of verbs and nouns.
