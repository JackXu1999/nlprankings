Abstract

This paper reports preliminary experiments aiming at verifying the conjecture that semantic com-
positionality is a general process irrespective of the underlying modality. In particular, we model
compositionality of an attribute with an object in the visual modality as done in the case of an ad-
jective with a noun in the linguistic modality. Our experiments show that the concept topologies
in the two modalities share similarities, results that strengthen our conjecture.

1 Language and Vision

Recently, fields like computational linguistics and computer vision have converged to a common way of
capturing and representing the linguistic and visual information of atomic concepts, through vector space
models. At the same time, advances in computational semantics have lead to effective and linguistically
inspired approaches of extending such methods from single concepts to arbitrary linguistic units (e.g.
phrases), through means of vector-based semantic composition (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).

Compositionality is not to be considered only an important component from a linguistic perspective,
but also from a cognitive perspective and there has been efforts to validate it as a general cognitive
process. However, in computer vision so far compositionality has received limited attention. Thus, in
this work, we study the phenomenon of visual compositionality and we complement limited previous
literature that has focused on event compositionality (Stöttinger et al., 2012) or general image struc-
ture (Socher et al., 2011), by studying models of attribute-object semantic composition.

In a nutshell, our work consists of learning vector representations of attribute-object (e.g., “red car”,
“cute dog” etc.) and objects (e.g., “car”, “dog”, “truck”, “cat” etc.) and by using those compute the
representation of new objects having similar attributes (“red truck”, “cute cat” etc.). This question has
both theoretical and applied impact. The possibility of developing a visual compositional model of
attribute-object, on the one hand, could shed light on the acquisition of such ability in humans; how we
learn attribute representation and compose them with different objects is still an open question within the
cognitive science community (Mintz and Gleitman, 2002). On the other hand, computer vision systems
could become generative and be able to recognize unseen attribute-object combinations, a component
especially useful for object recognition and image retrieval.

2 Visual Compositional Model

As our source of inspiration regarding the type of compositionality, we use the Lexical Functional model
(LF) (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010), under which adjectives, in linguistic compositionality, are repre-
sented as linear functions (i.e., matrix of weights). Concretely, each adjective function fWadj is induced
from corpus-observed vectors of adjective-noun phrases wi ∈ Wphrase and noun wj ∈ Wnoun, e.g.,
〈(wred car, wcar), (wred flag, wflag), . . .〉, by solving the least-squares regression problem:

arg min
fWadj∈Rd×d

||Wphrase − fWadjWnoun||

In this work, we propose to import the LF method in the visual modality, aiming at develop-
ing a Visual Compositional Model. Similarly to the case of linguistic compositionality, each at-
tribute function fVattr is induced from image-harvested vector representations of attribute-object vi ∈
Vphrase and object vj ∈ Vobject, e.g. for training the function fVred the following data can be used
〈(vred car, vcar), (vred flag, vflag), . . .〉.

3 Experiments

The visual representations of attribute-objects and objects are created with the PHOW-color fea-
tures (Bosch et al., 2007) and SIFT color-agnostic features (Lowe, 2004) respectively. The linguistic
representations for the adjective-noun Wphrase and noun Wnoun are built with the word2vec toolkit1

using a corpus of 3 billion tokens.2 Both visual and linguistic representations consist of 300 dimensions.
In this work, we focus on attributes related to 10 colors (Russakovsky and Fei-Fei, 2012) for a

total number of 9699 images depicting 202 unique objects/nouns and 886 unique phrases (attribute-
object/adjective-noun). Our experiments are conducted with aggregated attribute-object representations
obtained by summing the visual vectors extracted from images representing the same attribute-object,
The same pipeline is followed for the objects to obtain aggregated object vectors.

This work aims at comparing the behavior of the semantically-driven compositionality process across
the two modalities. For this reason, we report results on the intersection of Vphrase and Wphrase, a
process that results in 266 attribute-object/adjective-noun items. Furthermore, although the training data
for the two modalities are different, the size of the training data is identical, i.e., the fVattr is trained using
the remaining 620 attribute-object items, whereas for the fWadj , we randomly sample 620 adjective-noun
items from the language space.

3.1 Analysis of Language and Visual Semantic Spaces

This experiment aims at assessing the degree to which language and vision share commonalities. To this
end, we compute the cosine similarities between all possible combination of objects (resp., nouns) and
perform a correlation analysis of the similarity of the corresponding pairs in the two lists resulting in 0.45
Spearman correlation – e.g., we correlate the similarity between vcat and vdog with that between wcat and
wdog. For instance, “goat” and “sheep” are highly similar in both spaces, whereas “whale” and “bird”
are similar only linguistically, whereas “blackboard” and “chair” are similar only visually. The same
experiment is performed between all possible combinations of attribute-object/adjective-noun items, e.g.
we correlate the similarity between vwhite cat and vblack dog with that between wwhite cat and wblack dog,
resulting in 0.33 Spearman correlation (see Table 1).

Overall, our results suggest that the topologies of the semantic spaces are similar in the two modalities.
Furthermore, since this phenomenon is also apparent in the cases of attribute-object and adjective-noun
pairs, this alludes to the possibility of transferring approaches of semantic compositionality from the
linguistic to the visual modality.

High Visual Low Visual
High Linguistic goat-sheep, jaguar- lion baboon-transporter, bird-whale

black bag - brown bag, brown bear - yellow dog blue grass - blue van, gray whale - white deer
Low Linguistic ball-horse, blackboard-chair baboon-sofa, backboard-panda

red strawberry - white ball, white bear - yellow dog black bag - green bridge, green table - yellow stick

3.2 Semantically-driven composition for attribute-object representations

The findings of the previous experiment suggest a high correlation between the visual attribute-attribute
representations and the corpus-harvested adjective-noun representations. An interesting question that
arises is whether we could approximate such visual representations of complex visual units, similarly to

how is done in Computational Linguistics for approximating the text-based representations of adjective-
noun phrases. Thus, this experiment is designed in order to assess the validity of the semantically-driven
compositionality approach in the visual domain. Results are reported in Table 2. Since we expect that
the quality of the aggregated vectors depends on the numbers of available images, we report results for
subsets of the original data set that differ on the number of images per phrase.

By means of the LF composition method sketched in Section 2, we obtain the compositional represen-
tations of attribute-object (V compphrase) and adjective-noun (W

comp
phrase) items. We then perform the correlation

analyses between the similarities obtained in the composed visual space V compphrase with: 1) the equiva-
lent image-harvested representations Vphrase, 2) the equivalent corpus-derived linguistic representations
Wphrase, 3) the equivalent compositionally-derived linguistic representations W

comp
phrase.

Overall, the correlation between V compspace and Vspace suggests that the visual compositionality of
attribute-object can account, to some extend, for the visual semantics of the respective image, and it
further improves with the number of images we consider for obtaining the aggregated vectors of the vi-
sual phrases. Finally, as expected, the correlations between V compspace although lower than the ones reported
in Section 3.1, i.e., 0.22 vs 0.32, are still non negligible.

all phrases > 10 images > 20 images > 30 images
V compphrase - Vphrase 0.24 0.40 0.53 0.58

V compphrase - Wphrase 0.10 0.22 0.19 0.23
V compphrase - W

comp
phrase 0.04 0.05 0.18 0.10

4 Conclusions

In this work, we have experimented with semantically-driven compositionality of attributes with objects
in the visual modality, by adopting an out-of-the-box composition method from the computational se-
mantics literature. Our preliminary results have shown that the visual representations of attribute-objects
when obtained compositionally reflect properties similar not only to the ones found in representations
harvested automatically from images, but also from those extracted from text corpora. These results
show that semantic compositionality might be a general process irrespective of the underlying modality.
We have just scratched the surface on this topic and in the future we plan to experiment with a larger
variety of attributes and use and design alternative visual compositional models.
