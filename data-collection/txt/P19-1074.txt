Abstract

Multiple entities in a document generally ex-
hibit complex inter-sentence relations, and
cannot be well handled by existing relation
extraction (RE) methods that typically fo-
cus on extracting intra-sentence relations for
single entity pairs. In order to accelerate
the research on document-level RE, we in-
troduce DocRED, a new dataset constructed
from Wikipedia and Wikidata with three fea-
tures: (1) DocRED annotates both named en-
tities and relations, and is the largest human-
annotated dataset for document-level RE from
plain text; (2) DocRED requires reading mul-
tiple sentences in a document to extract en-
tities and infer their relations by synthesiz-
ing all information of the document; (3) along
with the human-annotated data, we also of-
fer large-scale distantly supervised data, which
enables DocRED to be adopted for both su-
pervised and weakly supervised scenarios. In
order to verify the challenges of document-
level RE, we implement recent state-of-the-art
methods for RE and conduct a thorough eval-
uation of these methods on DocRED. Empir-
ical results show that DocRED is challeng-
ing for existing RE methods, which indicates
that document-level RE remains an open prob-
lem and requires further efforts. Based on the
detailed analysis on the experiments, we dis-
cuss multiple promising directions for future
research. We make DocRED and the code
for our baselines publicly available at https:

1 Introduction

The task of relation extraction (RE) is to iden-
tify relational facts between entities from plain
text, which plays an important role in large-scale
knowledge graph construction. Most existing RE

[1] Kungliga Hovkapellet (The Royal Court Orchestra) is a
Swedish orchestra, originally part of the Royal Court in Sweden's
capital Stockholm. [2] The orchestra originally consisted of both
musicians and singers. [3] It had only male members until 1727,
when Sophia Schröder and Judith Fischer were employed as
vocalists; in the 1850s, the harpist Marie Pauline Åhman became
the first female instrumentalist. [4] From 1731, public concerts
were performed at Riddarhuset in Stockholm. [5] Since 1773,
when the Royal Swedish Opera was founded by Gustav III of
Sweden, the Kungliga Hovkapellet has been part of the opera's
company.

work focuses on sentence-level RE, i.e., extract-
ing relational facts from a single sentence. In
recent years, various neural models have been
explored to encode relational patterns of entities
for sentence-level RE, and achieve state-of-the-
art performance (Socher et al., 2012; Zeng et al.,
2014, 2015; dos Santos et al., 2015; Xiao and Liu,
2016; Cai et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Wu et al.,
2017; Qin et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018a).

Despite these successful efforts, sentence-level
RE suffers from an inevitable restriction in prac-
tice: a large number of relational facts are ex-
pressed in multiple sentences. Taking Figure 1
as an example, multiple entities are mentioned in
the document and exhibit complex interactions. In

order to identify the relational fact (Riddarhuset,
country, Sweden), one has to first identify the
fact that Riddarhuset is located in Stockholm from
Sentence 4, then identify the facts Stockholm is
the capital of Sweden and Sweden is a country
from Sentence 1, and finally infer from these facts
that the sovereign state of Riddarhuset is Swe-
den. The process requires reading and reason-
ing over multiple sentences in a document, which
is intuitively beyond the reach of sentence-level
RE methods. According to the statistics on our
human-annotated corpus sampled from Wikipedia
documents, at least 40.7% relational facts can only
be extracted from multiple sentences, which is not
negligible. Swampillai and Stevenson (2010) and
Verga et al. (2018) have also reported similar ob-
servations. Therefore, it is necessary to move RE
forward from sentence level to document level.

The research on document-level RE requires
a large-scale annotated dataset for both training
and evaluation. Currently, there are only a few
datasets for document-level RE. Quirk and Poon
(2017) and Peng et al. (2017) build two dis-
tantly supervised datasets without human anno-
tation, which may make the evaluation less re-
liable. BC5CDR (Li et al., 2016) is a human-
annotated document-level RE dataset consisting
of 1, 500 PubMed documents, which is in the
specific domain of biomedicine considering only
the “chemical-induced disease” relation, making
it unsuitable for developing general-purpose meth-
ods for document-level RE. Levy et al. (2017) ex-
tract relational facts from documents by answering
questions using reading comprehension methods,
where the questions are converted from entity-
relation pairs. As the dataset proposed in this
work is tailored to the specific approach, it is
also unsuitable for other potential approaches for
document-level RE. In summary, existing datasets
for document-level RE either only have a small
number of manually-annotated relations and en-
tities, or exhibit noisy annotations from distant
supervision, or serve specific domains or ap-
proaches. In order to accelerate the research on
document-level RE, we urgently need a large-
scale, manually-annotated, and general-purpose
document-level RE dataset.

In this paper, we present DocRED, a large-scale
human-annotated document-level RE dataset con-
structed from Wikipedia and Wikidata (Erxleben
et al., 2014; Vrandečić and Krötzsch, 2014). Do-

cRED is constructed with the following three
features: (1) DocRED contains 132, 375 enti-
ties and 56, 354 relational facts annotated on
5, 053 Wikipedia documents, making it the largest
human-annotated document-level RE dataset. (2)
As at least 40.7% of the relational facts in Do-
cRED can only be extracted from multiple sen-
tences, DocRED requires reading multiple sen-
tences in a document to recognize entities and in-
ferring their relations by synthesizing all informa-
tion of the document. This distinguishes DocRED
from those sentence-level RE datasets. (3) We
also provide large-scale distantly supervised data
to support weakly supervised RE research.

To assess the challenges of DocRED, we imple-
ment recent state-of-the-art RE methods and con-
duct thorough experiments on DocRED under var-
ious settings. Experimental results show that the
performance of existing methods declines signifi-
cantly on DocRED, indicating the task document-
level RE is more challenging than sentence-level
RE and remains an open problem. Furthermore,
detailed analysis on the results also reveals multi-
ple promising directions worth pursuing.

2 Data Collection

Our ultimate goal is to construct a dataset for
document-level RE from plain text, which re-
quires necessary information including named en-
tity mentions, entity coreferences, and relations of
all entity pairs in the document. To facilitate more
RE settings, we also provide supporting evidence
information for relation instances. In the follow-
ing sections, we first introduce the collection pro-
cess of the human-annotated data, and then de-
scribe the process of creating the large-scale dis-
tantly supervised data.

2.1 Human-Annotated Data Collection

Our human-annotated data is collected in four
stages: (1) Generating distantly supervised anno-
tation for Wikipedia documents. (2) Annotating
all named entity mentions in the documents and
coreference information. (3) Linking named entity
mentions to Wikidata items. (4) Labeling relations
and corresponding supporting evidence.

Following ACE annotation process (Dodding-
ton et al., 2004), both Stage 2 and 4 require
three iterative passes over the data: (1) Generat-
ing named entity using named entity recognition
(NER) models, or relation recommendations us-



766

ing distant supervision and RE models. (2) Man-
ually correcting and supplementing recommenda-
tions. (3) Reviewing and further modifying the an-
notation results from the second pass for better ac-
curacy and consistency. To ensure the annotators
are well trained, a principled training procedure is
adopted and the annotators are required to pass test
tasks before annotating the dataset. And only care-
fully selected experienced annotators are qualified
for the third pass annotation.

To provide a strong alignment between text and
KBs, our dataset is constructed from the complete
English Wikipedia document collection and Wiki-
data 1, which is a large-scale KB tightly integrated
with Wikipedia. We use the introductory sections
from Wikipedia documents as the corpus, as they
are usually high-quality and contain most of the
key information.

Stage 1: Distantly Supervised Annotation Gen-
eration. To select documents for human annota-
tion, we align Wikipedia documents with Wikidata
under the distant supervision assumption (Mintz
et al., 2009). Specifically, we first perform named
entity recognition using spaCy2. Then these
named entity mentions are linked to Wikidata
items, where named entity mentions with identi-
cal KB IDs are merged. Finally, relations between
each merged named entity pair in the document are
labeled by querying Wikidata. Documents con-
taining fewer than 128 words are discarded. To en-
courage reasoning, we further discard documents
containing fewer than 4 entities or fewer than 4 re-
lation instances, resulting in 107, 050 documents
with distantly supervised labels, where we ran-
domly select 5, 053 documents and the most fre-
quent 96 relations for human annotation.

Stage 2: Named Entity and Coreference An-
notation. Extracting relations from document re-
quires first recognizing named entity mentions and
identifying mentions referring to the same enti-
ties within the document. To provide high-quality
named entity mentions and coreference informa-
tion, we ask human annotators first to review, cor-
rect and supplement the named entity mention
recommendations generated in Stage 1, and then
merge those different mentions referring to the
same entities, which provides extra coreference in-
formation. The resulting intermediate corpus con-

1We use the 2018-5-24 dump of English Wikipedia and
2018-3-20 dump of Wikidata.

tains a variety of named entity types including
person, location, organization, time, number and
names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong
to the aforementioned types.

Stage 3: Entity Linking. In this stage, we link
each named entity mention to multiple Wikidata
items to provide relation recommendations from
distant supervision for the next stage. To be spe-
cific, each named entity mention is associated with
a Wikidata item candidate set 3 consisting of all
Wikidata items whose names or aliases literally
match it. We further extend the candidate set using
Wikidata items hyperlinked to the named entity
mention by the document authors, and recommen-
dations from an entity linking toolkit TagMe (Fer-
ragina and Scaiella, 2010). Specially, numbers and
time are semantically matched.

Stage 4: Relation and Supporting Evidence
Collection. The annotation of relation and sup-
porting evidence is based on the named entity
mentions and coreference information in Stage 2,
and faces two main challenges. The first challenge
comes from the large number of potential entity
pairs in the document. On the one hand, given
the quadratic number of potential entity pairs with
regard to entity number (19.5 entities on aver-
age) in a document, exhaustively labeling relations
between each entity pair would lead to intensive
workload. On the other hand, most entity pairs in
a document do not contain relations. The second
challenge lies in the large number of fine-grained
relation types in our dataset. Thus it is not feasible
for annotators to label relations from scratch.

We address the problem by providing human
annotators with recommendations from RE mod-
els, and distant supervision based on entity link-
ing (Stage 3). On average, we recommend 19.9
relation instances per document from entity link-
ing, and 7.8 from RE models for supplement. We
ask the annotators to review the recommendations,
remove the incorrect relation instances and sup-
plement omitted ones. We also ask the annotators
to further select all sentences that support the re-
served relation instances as supporting evidence.
Relations reserved must be reflected in the doc-
ument, without relying on external world knowl-
edge. Finally 57.2% relation instances from entity
linking and 48.2% from RE models are reserved.

3To avoid losing relation recommendations due to predic-
tion errors in entity linking, we include multiple linking re-
sults from different approaches in the candidate set.

2.2 Distantly Supervised Data Collection

In addition to the human-annotated data, we also
collect large-scale distantly supervised data to pro-
mote weakly supervised RE scenarios. We remove
the 5, 053 human-annotated documents from the
106, 926 documents, and use the rest 101, 873
documents as the corpus of distantly supervised
data. To ensure that the distantly supervised data
and human-annotated data share the same en-
tity distribution, named entity mentions are re-
identified using Bidirectional Encoder Represen-
tations from Transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al.,
2019) that is fine-tuned on the human-annotated
data collected in Sec. 2.1 and achieves 90.5% F1
score. We link each named entity mention to one
Wikidata item by a heuristic-based method, which
jointly considers the frequency of a target Wiki-
data item and its relevance to the current docu-
ment. Then we merge the named entity mentions
with identical KB IDs. Finally, relations between
each merged entity pair are labeled via distant su-
pervision.

3 Data Analysis

In this section, we analyze various aspects of Do-
cRED to provide a deeper understanding of the
dataset and the task of document-level RE.

Data Size. Table 1 shows statistics of DocRED
and some representative RE datasets, including
sentence-level RE datasets SemEval-2010 Task
8 (Hendrickx et al., 2010), ACE 2003-2004 (Dod-
dington et al., 2004), TACRED (Zhang et al.,
2017), FewRel (Han et al., 2018b) and document-
level RE dataset BC5CDR (Li et al., 2016). We
find that DocRED is larger than existing datasets
in many aspects, including the number of docu-
ments, words, sentences, entities, especially in as-
pects of relation types, relation instances and re-
lational facts. We hope the large-scale DocRED
dataset could drive relation extraction from sen-

tence level forward to document level.
Named Entity Types. DocRED covers a variety
of entity types, including person (18.5%), location
(30.9%), organization (14.4%), time (15.8%) and
number (5.1%). It also covers a diverse set of mis-
cellaneous entity names (15.2%) not belonging to
the aforementioned types, such as events, artistic
works and laws. Each entity is annotated with 1.34
mentions on average.
Relation Types. Our dataset includes 96 frequent
relation types from Wikidata. A notable property
of our dataset is that the relation types cover a
broad range of categories, including relations rele-
vant to science (33.3%), art (11.5%), time (8.3%),
personal life (4.2%), etc., which means the rela-
tional facts are not constrained in any specific do-
main. In addition, the relation types are organized
in a well-defined hierarchy and taxonomy, which
could provide rich information for document-level
RE systems.
Reasoning Types. We randomly sampled 300
documents from dev and test set, which contain
3, 820 relation instances, and manually analyze
the reasoning types required to extract these rela-
tions. Table 2 shows statistics of major reasoning
types in our dataset. From the statistics on rea-
soning types, we have the following observations:
(1) Most of the relation instances (61.1%) require
reasoning to be identified, and only 38.9% rela-
tion instances can be extracted via simple pattern
recognition, which indicates that reasoning is es-
sential for document-level RE. (2) In relation in-
stances with reasoning, a majority (26.6%) require
logical reasoning, where the relations between two
entities in question are indirectly established by a
bridge entity. Logical reasoning requires RE sys-
tems to be capable of modeling interactions be-
tween multiple entities. (3) A notable number of
relation instances (17.6%) need coreference rea-
soning, where coreference resolution must be per-
formed first to identify target entities in a rich con-

text. (4) A similar proportion of relation instances
(16.6%) has to be identified based on common-
sense reasoning, where readers need to combine
relational facts from the document with common-
sense to complete the relation identification. In
summary, DocRED requires rich reasoning skills
for synthesizing all information of the document.

Inter-Sentence Relation Instances. We find that
each relation instance is associated with 1.6 sup-
porting sentences on average, where 46.4% rela-
tion instances are associated with more than one
supporting sentence. Moreover, detailed analy-
sis reveals that 40.7% relational facts can only be
extracted from multiple sentences, indicating that
DocRED is a good benchmark for document-level
RE. We can also conclude that the abilities of read-
ing, synthesizing and reasoning over multiple sen-
tence are essential for document-level RE.

4 Benchmark Settings

We design two benchmark settings for super-
vised and weakly supervised scenarios respec-
tively. For both settings, RE systems are evalu-
ated on the high-quality human-annotated dataset,
which provides more reliable evaluation results for
document-level RE systems. The statistics of data
used for the two settings are shown in Table 3.

Supervised Setting. In this setting, only human-
annotated data is used, which are randomly split

Setting # Doc. # Rel. # Inst. # Fact

settings (Sec. 4): supervised setting (S) and weakly su-
pervised setting (W).

into training, development and test sets. The
supervised setting brings up two challenges for
document-level RE systems as follows:

The first challenge comes from the rich reason-
ing skills required for performing document-level
RE. As shown in Sec. 3, about 61.1% relation in-
stances depend on complex reasoning skills other
than pattern recognition to be extracted, which
requires RE systems to step beyond recognizing
simple patterns in a single sentence, and reason
over global and complex information in a docu-
ment.

The second challenge lies in the high compu-
tational cost of modeling long documents and the
massive amount of potential entity pairs in a doc-
ument, which is quadratic with regard to entity
number (19.5 entities on average) in a document.
As a result, RE systems that model context in-
formation with algorithms of quadratic or even
higher computational complexity such as (Sorokin



769

and Gurevych, 2017; Christopoulou et al., 2018)
are not efficient enough for document-level RE.
Thus the efficiency of context-aware RE systems
needs to be further improved to be applicable in
document-level RE.

Weakly Supervised Setting. This setting is iden-
tical to the supervised setting except that the train-
ing set is replaced with the distantly supervised
data (Sec. 2.2). In addition to the aforemen-
tioned two challenges, the inevitable wrong la-
beling problem accompanied with distantly su-
pervised data is a major challenge for RE mod-
els under weakly supervised setting. Many ef-
forts have been devoted to alleviating the wrong
labeling problem in sentence-level RE (Riedel
et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu
et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2016). However, noise
in document-level distantly supervised data is sig-
nificantly more than its counterpart in sentence-
level. For example, for the recommended relation
instances whose head and tail entities co-occur in
the same sentence (i.e. intra-sentence relation in-
stance) in Stage 4 of human-annotated data col-
lection (Sec. 2.1), 41.4% are labeled as incorrect,
while 61.8% inter-sentence relation instances are
labeled as incorrect, indicating the wrong label-
ing problem is more challenging for weakly super-
vised document-level RE. Therefore, we believe
offering distantly supervised data in DocRED will
accelerate the development of distantly supervised
methods for document-level RE. Moreover, it is
also possible to jointly leverage distantly super-
vised data and human-annotated data to further
improve the performance of RE systems.

5 Experiments

To assess the challenges of DocRED, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate state-of-
the-art RE systems on the dataset. Specifically, we
conduct experiments under both supervised and
weakly supervised benchmark settings. We also
assess human performance and analyze the perfor-
mance for different supporting evidence types. In
addition, we conduct ablation study to investigate
the contribution of different features. Through de-
tailed analysis, we discuss several future direc-
tions for document-level RE.

Models. We adapt four state-of-the-art RE mod-
els to document-level RE scenario, including
a CNN (Zeng et al., 2014) based model, an
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) based

model, a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) (Cai
et al., 2016) based model and the Context-Aware
model (Sorokin and Gurevych, 2017) originally
designed for leveraging contextual relations to im-
prove intra-sentence RE. The first three models
differ only at the encoder used for encoding the
document and will be explained in detail in the rest
of this section. We refer the readers to the original
paper for the details of the Context-Aware model
for space limitation.

The CNN/LSTM/BiLSTM based models first
encode a document D = {wi}ni=1 consisting of n
words into a hidden state vector sequence {hi}ni=1
with CNN/LSTM/BiLSTM as encoder, then com-
pute the representations for entities, and finally
predict relations for each entity pair.

For each word, the features fed to the encoder
is the concatenation of its GloVe word embed-
ding (Pennington et al., 2014), entity type em-
bedding and coreference embedding. The entity
type embedding is obtained by mapping the entity
type (e.g., PER, LOC, ORG) assigned to the word
into a vector using an embedding matrix. The
entity type is assigned by human for the human-
annotated data, and by a fine-tuned BERT model
for the distantly supervised data. Named entity
mentions corresponding to the same entity are as-
signed with the same entity id, which is deter-
mined by the order of its first appearance in the
document. And the entity ids are mapped into vec-
tors as the coreference embeddings.

For each named entity mention mk ranging
from the s-th word to the t-th word, we define its
representation as mk = 1t−s+1

∑t
j=s hj . And the

representation of an entity ei with K mentions is
computed as the average of the representations of
these mentions: ei = 1K

∑
k mk.

We treat relation prediction as a multi-label
classification problem. Specially, for each entity
pair (ei, ej), we first concatenate the entity repre-
sentations with relative distance embeddings, and
then use a bilinear function to compute the proba-
bility for each relation type:

êi = [ei;E(dij)], êj = [ej ;E(dji)] (1)

P (r|ei, ej) = sigmoid(êTi Wrêj + br) (2)

where [·; ·] denotes concatenation, dij and dji are
the relative distances of the first mentions of the
two entities in the document, E is an embedding
matrix, r is a relation type, and Wr, br are relation
type dependent trainable parameters.

Evaluation Metrics. Two widely used metrics F1
and AUC are used in our experiments. However,
some relational facts present in both the training
and dev/test sets, thus a model may memorize their
relations during training and achieve a better per-
formance on the dev/test set in an undesirable way,
introducing evaluation bias. However, the over-
lap in relational facts between the training and
dev/test sets is inevitable, since many common re-
lational facts are likely to be shared in different
documents. Therefore, we also report the F1 and
AUC scores excluding those relational facts shared
by the training and dev/test sets, denoted as Ign F1
and Ign AUC, respectively.

Model Performance. Table 4 shows the experi-
mental results under the supervised and weakly su-
pervised settings, from which we have the follow-
ing observations: (1) Models trained with human-
annotated data generally outperform their counter-
parts trained on distantly supervised data. This is
because although large-scale distantly supervised
data can be easily obtained via distant supervi-
sion, the wrong-labeling problem may harm the
performance of RE systems, which makes weakly
supervised setting a more difficult scenario. (2)
An interesting exception is that LSTM, BiLSTM
and Context-Aware trained on distantly supervised
data achieve comparable F1 scores as those trained
on human-annotated data but significantly lower
scores on the other metrics, indicating that the
overlap entity pairs between training and dev/test
sets indeed cause evaluation biases. Therefore, re-
porting Ign F1 and Ign AUC is necessary. (3) Mod-
els leveraging rich contextual information gener-
ally achieve better performances. LSTM and BiL-
STM outperform CNN, indicating the effective-
ness of modeling long-dependency semantics in

document-level RE. Context-Aware achieves com-
petitive performance, however, it cannot signifi-
cantly outperform other neural models. It indi-
cates that it is beneficial to consider the associa-
tion of multiple relations in document-level RE,
whereas the current models are not capable of uti-
lizing inter-relation information well.

Human Performance. To assess human per-
formance on the task of document-level RE on
DocRED, we randomly sample 100 documents
from the test set and ask additional crowd-workers
to identify relation instances and supporting evi-
dence. Relation instances identified in the same
way as Sec. 2.1 are recommended to the crowd-
workers to assist them. The original annotation
results collected in Sec. 2.1 are used as ground
truth. We also propose another subtask of jointly
identifying relation instances and supporting ev-
idence, and also design a pipeline model. Ta-
ble 5 shows the performance of RE model and
human. Humans achieve competitive results on
both the document-level RE task (RE) and the
jointly identifying relation and supporting evi-
dence task (RE+Sup), indicating both the ceiling
performance on DocRED and the inter-annotator
agreement are relatively high. In addition, the
overall performance of RE models is significantly
lower than human performance, which indicates
document-level RE is a challenging task, and sug-
gests ample opportunity for improvement.

Performance v.s. Supporting Evidence Types.
Document-level RE requires synthesizing infor-
mation from multiple supporting sentences. To
investigate the difficulty of synthesizing informa-
tion from different types of supporting evidence,
we devide the 12, 332 relation instances in devel-
opment set into three disjoint subsets: (1) 6, 115
relation instances with only one supporting sen-
tence (denoted as single); (2) 1, 062 relation in-
stances with multiple supporting sentences and
the entity pair co-occur in at least one support-
ing sentence (denoted as mix); (3) 4, 668 rela-
tion instances with multiple supporting sentences
and the entity pair do not co-occur in any sup-
porting sentence, which means they can only be
extracted from multiple supporting sentences (de-
noted as multiple). It should be noted that when a
model predicts a wrong relation, we do not know
which sentences have been used as supporting ev-
idence, thus the predicted relation instance cannot
be classified into the aforementioned subsets and
computing precision is infeasible. Therefore, we
only report recall of the RE model for each sub-
set, which is 51.1% for single, 49.4% for mix,
and 46.6% for multiple. This indicates that while
multiple supporting sentences in mix may provide
complementary information, it is challenging to
effectively synthesize the rich global information.
Moreover, the poor performance on multiple sug-
gests that RE models still struggle in extracting
inter-sentence relations.

Feature Ablations. We conduct feature abla-
tion studies on the BiLSTM model to investigate
the contribution of different features in document-
level RE, including entity types, coreference infor-
mation, and the relative distance between entities
(Eq. 1). Table 6 shows that the aforementioned
features all have a contribution to the performance.
Specifically, entity types contribute most due to
their constraint on viable relation types. Coref-
erence information and the relative distance be-
tween entities are also important for synthesizing
information from multiple named entity mentions.
This indicates that it is important for RE systems
to leverage rich information at document level.

Supporting Evidence Prediction. We propose a
new task to predict the supporting evidence for re-
lation instances. On the one hand, jointly predict-
ing the evidence provides better explainability. On
the other hand, identifying supporting evidence
and reasoning relational facts from text are nat-

urally dual tasks with potential mutual enhance-
ment. We design two supporting evidence predic-
tion methods: (1) Heuristic predictor. We imple-
ment a simple heuristic-based model that consid-
ers all sentences containing the head or tail entity
as supporting evidence. (2) Neural predictor. We
also design a neural supporting evidence predic-
tor. Given an entity pair and a predicted relation,
sentences are first transformed into input represen-
tations by the concatenation of word embeddings
and position embeddings, and then fed into a BiL-
STM encoder for contextual representations. In-
spired by Yang et al. (2018), we concatenate the
output of the BiLSTM at the first and last posi-
tions with a trainable relation embedding to obtain
a sentence’s representation, which is used to pre-
dict whether the sentence is adopted as support-
ing evidence for the given relation instance. As
Table 7 shows, the neural predictor significantly
outperforms heuristic-based baseline in predicting
supporting evidence, which indicates the potential
of RE models in joint relation and supporting evi-
dence prediction.

Discussion. We can conclude from the above
experimental results and analysis that document-
level RE is more challenging than sentence-level
RE and intensive efforts are needed to close the
gap between the performance of RE models and
human. We believe the following research direc-
tions are worth following: (1) Exploring mod-
els explicitly considering reasoning; (2) Designing
more expressive model architectures for collecting
and synthesizing inter-sentence information; (3)
Leveraging distantly supervised data to improve
the performance of document-level RE.

6 Related Work

A variety of datasets have been constructed for
RE in recent years, which have greatly promoted
the development of RE systems. Hendrickx et al.
(2010), Doddington et al. (2004) and Walker et al.
(2006) build human-annotated RE datasets with
relatively limited relation types and instances.
Riedel et al. (2010) automatically construct RE
dataset by aligning plain text to KB via distant
supervision, which suffers from wrong labeling
problem. Zhang et al. (2017) and Han et al.
(2018b) further combine external recommenda-
tions with human annotation to build large-scale
high-quality datasets. However, these RE datasets
limit relations to single sentences.

As documents provide richer information than
sentences, moving research from sentence level
to document level is a popular trend for many
areas, including document-level event extrac-
tion (Walker et al., 2006; Mitamura et al., 2015,
2017), fact extraction and verification (Thorne
et al., 2018), reading comprehension (Nguyen
et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2017),
sentiment classification (Pang and Lee, 2004; Pret-
tenhofer and Stein, 2010), summarization (Nalla-
pati et al., 2016) and machine translation (Zhang
et al., 2018). Recently, some document-level RE
datasets have also been constructed. However,
these datasets are either constructed via distant
supervision (Quirk and Poon, 2017; Peng et al.,
2017) with inevitable wrong labeling problem, or
limited in specific domain (Li et al., 2016; Peng
et al., 2017). In contrast, DocRED is constructed
by crowd-workers with rich information, and is
not limited in any specific domain, which makes
it suitable to train and evaluate general-purpose
document-level RE systems.

7 Conclusion

To promote RE systems from sentence level to
document level, we present DocRED, a large-scale
document-level RE dataset that features the data
size, the requirement for reading and reasoning
over multiple sentences, and the distantly super-
vised data offered for facilitating the development
of weakly supervised document-level RE. Exper-
iments show that human performance is signifi-
cantly higher than RE baseline models, which sug-
gests ample opportunity for future improvement.

A.1 Experimental Details

In this section, we provide more details of our ex-
periments. To fairly compare the results of dif-
ferent models, we optimized all baselines using
Adam, with learning rate of 0.001, β1 = 0.9, β1 =
0.999. The other experimental hyper-parameters
used in our experiments are shown in Table 8. Ad-
ditionally, due to the document-level distance be-
tween entities, distances are first divided into sev-
eral bins {1, 2, .., 2k}, where each bin is associated
with a trainable distance embedding.

Batch size 40
CNN hidden size 200
CNN window size 3
CNN dropout rate 0.5
LSTM hidden size 128
LSTM dropout rate 0.2
Word embedding dimension 100
Entity type embedding dimension 20
Coreference embedding dimension 20
Distance embedding dimension 20

A.2 Types of Named Entities

In this paper, we adapt the existing types of named
entities used in Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der (2003) to better serve DocRED. These types
include “Person (PER)”, “Organization (ORG)”,
“Location (LOC)”, “Time (TIME)”, “Number
(NUM)”, and “other types (MISC)”. The types of
named entities in DocRED and their covered con-
tents are shown in Table 9.

Types Content

PER People, including fictional

ORG Companies, universities, institutions, politi-cal or religious groups, etc.
Geographically defined locations, including
mountains, waters, etc.

LOC
