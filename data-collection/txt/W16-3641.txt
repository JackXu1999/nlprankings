Abstract

One of the key ways of making dia-
logue agents more attractive as conver-
sation partners is characterization, as it
makes the agents more friendly, human-
like, and entertaining. To build such char-
acters, utterances suitable for the charac-
ters are usually manually prepared. How-
ever, it is expensive to do this for a large
number of utterances. To reduce this
cost, we are developing a natural language
generator that can express the linguistic
styles of particular characters. To this
end, we analyze the linguistic peculiarities
of Japanese fictional characters (such as
those in cartoons or comics and mascots),
which have strong characteristics. The
contributions of this study are that we (i)
present comprehensive categories of lin-
guistic peculiarities of Japanese fictional
characters that cover around 90% of such
characters’ linguistic peculiarities and (ii)
reveal the impact of each category on char-
acterizing dialogue system utterances.

1 Introduction

One of the key ways of making dialogue agents
more attractive as conversation partners is char-
acterization, as it makes the agents more friendly,
human-like, and entertaining. Especially in Japan,
fictional characters (such as those in cartoons or
comics and mascots) are very popular. Therefore,
vividly characterized dialogue agents are strongly
desired by customers.

To characterize agents, utterances suitable for
them are usually manually prepared. However, it

poration.

phone East Corporation.

is expensive to do this for a large number of utter-
ances. To reduce this cost, we have previously pro-
posed a couple of methods for automatically con-
verting functional expressions into those that are
suitable for given personal attributes such as gen-
der, age, and area of residence (Miyazaki et al.,
2015) and closeness with a conversation partner
(Miyazaki et al., 2016). However, when it comes
to expressing the linguistic styles of individual fic-
tional characters whose characteristics should be
vividly expressed, these methods, which can con-
vert only function words, i.e., which cannot con-
vert content words such as nouns, adjectives, and
verbs, do not have sufficient expressive power. As
the first step in developing a natural language gen-
erator that can express the linguistic styles of fic-
tional characters, in this work, we analyze the lin-
guistic peculiarities of fictional characters such as
those in cartoons or comics and mascots, which
have strong characteristics.

The contributions of this study are that we (i)
present comprehensive categories of the linguistic
peculiarities of Japanese fictional characters that
cover around 90% of the fictional characters’ lin-
guistic peculiarities and (ii) reveal the impact of
each category on characterizing dialogue system
utterances.

Note that although we use the term ‘utterance’,
this study does not involve acoustic speech signals.
We use this term to refer to a certain meaningful
fragment of colloquial written language.

2 Related work

In the field of text-to-speech systems, there have
been various studies on voice conversion that mod-
ifies a speaker’s individuality (Yun and Ladner,
2013). However, in the field of text generation,
there are not so many studies related to the char-
acterization of dialogue agent utterances.

319



In the field of text generation, there is a method
that transforms individual characteristics in dia-
logue agent utterances using a method based on
statistical machine translation (Mizukami et al.,
2015). Other methods convert functional expres-
sions into those that are suitable for a speaker’s
gender, age, and area of residence (Miyazaki et al.,
2015) and closeness with a conversation partner
(Miyazaki et al., 2016). However, these methods
handle only function words or have difficulty in
altering other expressions. In this respect, we con-
sider these methods to be insufficient to express
a particular character’s linguistic style, especially
when focusing on fictional characters whose indi-
vidualities should be vividly expressed.

There have also been several studies on natu-
ral language generation that can adapt to speak-
ers’ personalities. In particular, a language gener-
ator called PERSONAGE that can control param-
eters related to speakers’ Big Five personalities
(Mairesse and Walker, 2007) has been proposed.
There is also a method for automatically adjust-
ing the language generation parameters of PER-
SONAGE by using movie scripts (Walker et al.,
2011) and a method for automatically adjusting
the parameters so that they suit the characters or
stories of role playing games (Reed et al., 2011).
However, although there is some aspect of linguis-
tic style that is essential to expressing a particular
character’s style, PERSONAGE does not have any
existing parameter that can manifest that linguistic
reflex (Walker et al., 2011).

In the present work, we focus on the languages
of fictional characters such as those in cartoons or
comics and mascots. By analyzing the languages
of such characters, we reveal what kind of linguis-
tic peculiarities are needed to express a particular
character’s linguistic style.

3 Categories of linguistic peculiarities of
fictional characters

After consulting linguistic literature and the Twit-
ter postings of 19 fictional character bots, we have
identified 13 categories of linguistic peculiarities
by which the linguistic styles of most Japanese
fictional characters can be characterized. The 13
categories, listed in Table 1, are made from the
perspective of lexical choice, modality, syntax,
phonology and pronunciation, surface options, or
extra expressions just for characterization. In the
rest of this section, each category of linguistic pe-

culiarities is explained in detail.

3.1 Lexical choice

We consider that lexical choice, which refers to
choosing words to represent intended meanings,
reflects the supposed speakers’ gender, region-
specific characteristics, personality, and so on. In
terms of lexical choice, we utilize the following
two categories.

P1: Personal pronouns
It is said that personal pronouns are one of the
most important components of Japanese role lan-
guage, which is character language based on
social and cultural stereotypes (Kinsui, 2003).
Japanese has “multiple self-referencing terms such
as watashi ‘I,’ watakushi ‘I-polite,’ boku ‘I-male
self-reference,’ ore ‘I-blunt male self-reference,’
and so on” (Maynard, 1997). Accordingly, if a
character uses ore in his utterance, its reader can
easily tell the character is male, the utterance is
probably uttered in a casual (less formal) situa-
tion, and his personality might be rather blunt and
rough. As well as the first person pronoun, there
are various terms for referencing second person.

P2: Dialectical or distinctive wordings
We assume that using dialectical wordings in char-
acters’ utterances not only reinforces the region-
specific characteristics of the characters but also
makes the characters more friendly and less for-
mal. It is also said that “regional dialect is a sig-
nificant factor in judging personality from voice”
(Markel et al., 1967).

In addition to dialects, the languages of
Japanese fictional characters often involve
character-specific coined words. The words are,

320



so to speak, ‘character dialect.’ For example, for
the character of a bear (kuma in Japanese), we
observed that the word ohakuma is used instead
of ohayoo ‘good morning.’

3.2 Modality

We consider that modality, which refers to a
speaker’s attitude toward a proposition, reflects
the supposed speakers’ friendliness or closeness
to their listeners, personality, and so on. As for
modality, we have the following two categories.

P3: Honorifics
We consider that honorifics have a significant
effect on describing speakers’ friendliness or
closeness to their listeners and on the speak-
ers’ social status. Depending on the social,
psychological, and emotional closeness between
a speaker and a listener, and whether the sit-
uation is formal or casual, Japanese has five
main choices of honorific verb forms: plain-
informal (kuru ‘come’), plain-formal (kimasu
‘come’), respectful-informal (irassharu ‘come’),
respectful-formal (irasshaimasu ‘come’), and
humble-formal (mairimasu) (Maynard, 1997).

Although English does not have such honorific
verb forms, it does have linguistic variations cor-
responding to the honorifics; for example, it is said
that “Americans use a variety of expressions to
convey different degrees of formality, politeness,
and candor” (Maynard, 1997).

P4: Sentence-end expressions
Sentence-end expressions are a key component
of Japanese character language, as are personal
pronouns (Kinsui, 2003). For example, there
are sentence-end expressions that are dominantly
used by female characters. We also consider that
sentence-end expressions are closely related to
speakers’ personalities, since the expressions con-
tain elements that convey speakers’ attitudes.

We define a sentence-end expression as a se-
quence of function words that occurs at the end
of a sentence. Japanese sentence-end expressions
contain interactional particles (Maynard, 1997),
which express speaker judgment and attitude to-
ward the message and the listener. For example,
ne (an English counterpart would be ‘isn’t it?’) oc-
curs at the end of utterances. In addition, Japanese
sentence-end expressions contain auxiliary verbs
(e.g., mitai ‘like’ and souda ‘it seems’), which ex-
press speaker attitudes.

Some of the expressions that fall into this cate-
gory have their counterparts in the parameters of
PERSONAGE (Mairesse and Walker, 2007). In
particular, interactional particles such as ne might
be able to be controlled by the TAG QUESTION
INSERTION parameter, and auxiliary verbs such
as mitai and souda might be able to be controlled
by the DOWNTONER HEDGES parameter.

3.3 Syntax

We consider that syntax, which refers to sentence
structures, reflects the supposed speakers’ person-
ality and maturity. With regard to syntax, we have
just one category.

P5: Syntactic complexity

Syntactic complexity is considered to be reflective
of introverts, and it is also handled in PERSON-
AGE (Mairesse and Walker, 2007). In addition,
we assume that syntactic complexity reflects the
maturity of the supposed speakers. For example,
the utterances of a character that is supposed to be
a child would include more simple sentences than
complex ones.

3.4 Phonology and pronunciation

We consider that phonology and pronunciation re-
flects the supposed speakers’ age, gender, person-
ality, and so on. As for phonology and pronunci-
ation, we have three categories. What we want to
handle are pronunciations reflected in written ex-
pressions.

P6: Relaxed pronunciations

Both English and Japanese have relaxed pronun-
ciations, that is, pronunciation variants that are
not normative and are usually easier and effortless
ways of pronunciation. These relaxed pronunci-
ations can often be observed as spelling variants.
For example, in English, ‘ya,’ ‘kinda’, and ‘hafta’
can be used instead of ‘you,’ ‘kind of’, and ‘have
to’, respectively. In Japanese, vowel alternation
often occurs in adjectives; for example, alteration
from ai to ee, as in itai to itee ‘painful’. Accord-
ing to our observation, relaxed pronunciations are
seen more often in the utterances of youngsters
than older people and more often in males than
females. We consider that relaxed pronunciations
lend a blunt and rough impression to characters’
utterances.

321



P7: Disfluency
In the utterances of some fictional characters,
word fragments are often used for representing
disfluent language production by the supposed
speakers. For example, ha, hai ‘Yes’ and bo, boku-
wa ga, gakusei-desu ‘I am a student,’ which are
probably done for adding hesitant characteristics
to the characters. It is also said that “including
disfluencies in speech leads to lower perceived
conscientiousness and openness” (Wester et al.,
2015).

P8: Arbitrary phoneme replacements
In addition to relaxed pronunciation, it is often
observed that arbitrary phonemes are replaced by
other arbitrary phonemes, especially in character
languages. For example, every consonant ‘n’ can
be replaced by ‘ny’ (e.g., nyaze nyakunyo instead
of naze nakuno ‘Why do you cry?’). This phe-
nomenon does not occur in actual human’s utter-
ances unless the speaker is kidding. We consider
that arbitrary phoneme replacements are utilized
to give a funny impression to characters’ utter-
ances and to differentiate the linguistic styles of
characters.

3.5 Surface options

Since we are handling written utterances, there are
some options of how an utterance is presented as
a sequence of letters and symbols. We consider
that surface options are utilized as an easy way
of characterizing utterances and differentiating the
linguistic styles of characters.

P9: Word segmentation
In normative Japanese texts, unlike English texts,
words are not segmented by spaces—rather, they
are written adjacently to each other. However, in
characters’ utterances, it is sometimes observed
that words or phrases are segmented by spaces
or commas. When Japanese texts are read aloud,
spaces and commas are often acknowledged with
slight pauses, so we think that inserting extra
spaces or commas between words has the effect
of giving a slow and faltering impression to the
characters’ utterances.

P10: Letter type
In the Japanese writing system, there are three
types of letters—logographic kanji (adopted Chi-
nese characters), syllabic hiragana, and syllabic
katakana—and a combination of these three types

is typically used in a sentence. Those who know a
lot of rare kanji letters are often regarded as being
well educated. In contrast, using too many syl-
labic hiragana letters in a text gives the text a very
childish impression.

P11: Symbols
Symbols such as exclamation marks and emoti-
cons are often used in Japanese texts, in the same
manner as in English. We assume that symbols
are commonly used as an easy way of expressing
speakers’ emotional states.

3.6 Extras

There are extra expressions that contribute to nei-
ther propositional meaning nor communicative
function but still strongly contribute to character-
ization. We prepare the following two categories
for such expressions.

P12: Character interjections
Some of the extra expressions occur independently
or isolated from other words, as interjections do.
We call such expressions ‘character interjections’
in this study. Onomatopoeias, which describe sup-
posed speakers’ characteristics, are often used as
such expressions. For example, for the character
of a sheep, mofumofu ‘soft and fluffy’ is used as a
character interjection.

P13: Character sentence-end particles
There are expressions called kyara-joshi ‘charac-
ter particles’ (Sadanobu, 2015), which typically
occur at the end of sentences. The difference be-
tween character interjections and character parti-
cles is mainly their occurrence position. Accord-
ing to our observation, the word forms of the char-
acter particles are something like shortened ver-
sions of character interjections, which are often
within two or three moras (e.g., mofu as for the
character of a sheep).

4 Eval 1: Coverage of categories of
linguistic peculiarities

We conducted an evaluation to assess how well
our categories account for the linguistic peculiar-
ities of Japanese fictional characters. The evalu-
ation process is shown in Figure 1. First, we (1)
collected characters’ utterances. Then, we (2) an-
notated linguistic expressions that are peculiar to
the characters, and finally, we (3) counted how

many expressions fall into each of our categories
and how many do not fit into any category.

4.1 Collecting characters’ utterances
As utterances of fictional characters, we collected
the following two kinds of text.

Twitter postings We collected Twitter postings
of character bots. We chose bots that are au-
thorized by their copyright holders, as we as-
sume these are characterized by professional
writers.

Dialogue system utterances We utilize dialogue
system utterances that are written by profes-
sional writers we hired. The writers are asked
to create utterances that are highly probable
for given characters to utter as responses to
given questions. Contents and linguistic ex-
pressions of the utterances are carefully char-
acterized by the writers in accordance with
pre-defined character profiles that we created.

The characters we chose (C1–20) are shown
in Table 2. These 20 characters are bal-
anced with respect to humanity (human/non-
human), animateness (animate/inanimate), gender
(male/female/neuter), and maturity (adult/child or
adolescent) so that we can find general and ex-
haustive linguistic peculiarities of various charac-
ters.

Table 2: Characters we used and their attributes.
‘NA’ indicates that the value of the attribute is not
specified in a character’s profile. As for gender,
‘neuter’ refers to a character’s gender being speci-
fied as neutral between male and female.

We utilized 11 fictional characters from Twitter
bots (C4 and C11–20) and six fictional characters
from dialogue system characters (C5–10). The
reason we use dialogue system utterances along
with Twitter postings is that we intend to analyze
utterances that are originally designed for a dia-
logue system. In addition to these 17 fictional
characters, we also used three non-fictional (actual
human) characters for comparison (C1–3). C1 and
C3 are Twitter bots that post Japanese celebrities’
remarks from their TV shows or writings and C2 is
the official Twitter account of a Japanese celebrity.
Note that we did not use these characters in creat-
ing the categories in Section 3; that is, these char-
acters have been prepared for evaluation purposes.

We collected 100 utterances from each charac-
ter for a total of 2000 utterances. The average
number of words per utterance of the characters
from Twitter (C1–4 and C11–20) and the dialogue
system characters (C5–10) are 25.5 and 13.3, re-
spectively. Examples of characters’ utterances are
given in Table 3.

4.2 Annotating linguistic peculiarities

Each of the characters’ utterances was annotated
with linguistic peculiarities by annotators (not the
authors) who are native speakers of Japanese.

Step 1: Marking expressions peculiar to
characters

For each of the 2000 utterances, we asked two an-
notators (a primary annotator and a secondary an-
notator) to mark linguistic expressions that they
felt were peculiar to a character. The two anno-
tators worked separately, i.e., without discussing
or showing their work to each other. This process
was performed by two of the four annotators (A1–
4) shown in Table 4. These annotators correspond
to annotators A and B in Figure 1.

To analyze the ‘linguistic’ peculiarities of fic-
tional characters, we asked the annotators to mark
peculiar surface expressions and constructions
(i.e., to concentrate on ‘how to say it’) without
taking into account the meaning or content (i.e.,
to ignore ‘what to say’) of the utterances.

Step 2: Classifying peculiar expressions into
categories
For each expression marked in step 1, we asked
another annotator (not one of the authors) to clas-
sify the expression into one of 14 categories, i.e.,
to tag the category labels to the expressions. These
14 categories include the 13 categories shown in
Table 1 plus ‘others’ for expressions that cannot
be classified into any of the 13. The annotator
corresponds to annotator C or D in Figure 1. In
the example shown in Figure 1, annotator C deals
with the expressions marked by annotator A and
annotator D deals with the expressions marked by
annotator B. When classifying the expressions, an-
notators C and D are allowed to discuss and show
their work to each other. Examples of the tagged
utterances are given below.� �

<character id=“C7” annotator=“A2”>
<u id=“1”>パソコンがなければ通用し<honorific>
ません </honorific>。</u>
(You cannot do anything without a personal computer.)
<u id=“2”><pronoun> わたくし </pronoun> は子
どもたちのお世話も得意 <honorific>でございます
</honorific>。</u>
(I am good at taking care of children.)
・・・
</character>� �

Step 3: Extracting expressions that are agreed
to be peculiar
The utterances that are marked as having pecu-
liar expressions by the two annotators in Step 1
are compared. If the text spans of the expressions
marked by the two annotators overlap, such text
spans are regarded as the expressions agreed to be
peculiar and are extracted.

To evaluate the agreement of the expressions
marked by the two annotators, we use three mea-
sures: recall, precision, and F-measure. Here, we
regard the task of marking expressions performed
by two annotators as the secondary annotator’s
task of extracting the expressions marked by the
primary annotator. The three measures are calcu-
lated by

recall =
B

P
, precision =

B

S
,

F-measure =
2 · precision · recall
precision + recall

where B represents the number of expressions
marked by both the primary and secondary annota-
tors, P represents the total number of expressions

marked by the primary annotator, and S represents
the total number of expressions marked by the sec-
ondary annotator.

The number of expressions that are marked by
both annotators and the values of the three agree-
ment measures are listed in Table 5. In total,
4,994 expressions were agreed to be peculiar by
two annotators. The average values of recall, pre-
cision, and F-measure were 0.72, 0.74, and 0.73,
respectively—sufficient for the annotators’ per-
ception of characters’ linguistic peculiarities to be
considered as moderately in agreement and for the
extracted expressions to be reliable as characters’
linguistic peculiarities.

4.3 Counting numbers of peculiar
expressions in each category

We counted the number of category labels tagged
to the expressions that were agreed to be peculiar
in Step 3. We used 4,729 expressions that two an-
notators tagged with the same category (not all of
the 4,994 expressions that were agreed to be pe-
culiar). Then, we calculated the proportion of the
expressions classified into each category.

4.4 Results
The results are shown in Table 6. The propor-
tion of expressions that cannot be classified into
any of our categories was just around 12%. In
other words, around 88% of the linguistic pecu-
liarities of Japanese characters are covered by our

13 categories. When considering fictional charac-
ters (C4–20) only, around 90% of linguistic pe-
culiarities are covered by our categories. How-
ever, the proportions of expressions classified into
P5 (syntactic complexity), P6 (relaxed pronunci-
ation), P7 (disfluency), P9 (word segmentation),
and P10 (letter type) were less than 1%, which
suggests these categories might not be as impor-
tant as other categories, or might not be used as ef-
fectively as other categories. The importance (ef-
fectiveness in characterization) of each category
will be discussed later in Section 5.

In Figure 2, the proportions of expressions clas-
sified into each category are shown separately by
characters’ attributes. The proportion of ‘others’
for non-fictional (actual) human characters is the
largest among other characters. The proportion
of ‘others’ is gradually lowered as fictionality is
intensified, that is, as the characters become fic-
tional, non-human, and inanimate. We think this
result suggests that our 13 categories describe the
linguistic peculiarities of fictional characters bet-
ter than those of non-fictional humans. Actually,
P8 (arbitrary phoneme replacements) should not
occur so frequently in non-fictional humans’ ut-
terances because P8 is primarily for fictional char-
acters (see details in Section 3). This came about
because the annotators often confused expressions
that should be classified into P6 (relaxed pronun-
ciation) with those that should be classified into
P8. The expressions classified into these two cate-
gories need to be further investigated.

appropriateness among ten annotators.

5 Eval 2: Relations between categories
and character appropriateness

The second evaluation is for revealing the charac-
terizing effects of each category.

5.1 Preparation: Assessing character
appropriateness of utterances

For each of the 2000 utterances collected in Sec-
tion 4.1, we asked ten annotators (A5–14, listed
in Table 4) to assess the appropriateness of the
utterances as those uttered by particular charac-
ters. The assessment was done on a five-point
scale from 1 (very inappropriate; seeming like a
different character’s utterance) to 5 (very appro-
priate; expressing the character’s typical linguistic
characteristics).

5.2 Evaluation method

To evaluate the relationships between the cate-
gories of linguistic peculiarities and linguistic ap-
propriateness for the given characters, we calcu-
lated the correlation ratio (η) between the exis-
tence of a category and the average score of char-
acter appropriateness among ten annotators. We
consider that a high correlation ratio between the
existence of a category and the score of character
appropriateness tells us how effectively the cate-
gory invokes humans’ perceptions of the linguistic

style of a particular character. We use correlation
ratio because it can be applied to calculate correla-
tion between categorical data (nominal scale) and
interval scale, i.e., the categories of linguistic pe-
culiarities and the average score of character ap-
propriateness in this case. To be precise, the score
of character appropriateness in a five-point scale is
not an interval scale but an ordinal scale. However,
we treat the five-point scale as an interval scale for
convenience.

5.3 Results

The correlation ratios between the existence of the
categories and the average scores of character ap-
propriateness among ten annotators are shown in
Table 7. The correlation ratios are shown by char-
acter and the top three η values of each character
are written in bold.

When considering all characters, category P2
(dialectical or distinctive wordings) showed the
best correlation ratio, P13 (character sentence-end
particles) was the second, and P1 (personal pro-
nouns) was the third. As for P2, since it ranked in
the top three categories for 11 of 20 characters, we
consider that using dialectical or distinctive word-
ings is the most general and effective way of char-
acterizing utterances.

In addition to these top three categories across

326



all characters, we consider that P4 (sentence-end
expressions) is an important characteristic of hu-
man characters because it ranked in the top three
categories for seven of ten human characters. Al-
though P4 did not show as high a correlation ratio
as the other categories as a whole, we consider that
it has a strong effect on characterizing utterances,
especially for human characters.

As for non-human characters, P11 (symbols)
showed a comparatively high correlation ratio in
addition to the categories mentioned above. We
suppose that symbols such as exclamation marks
and emoticons are used as an easy and effective
way of characterizing utterances, especially when
handling non-human characters.

Overall, we found that most of our 13 categories
of characters’ linguistic peculiarities contribute to
character appropriateness to some extent. In other
words, most of the categories had some effect on
characterizing the utterances of Japanese fictional
characters.

Note that there are possibilities that the score of
character appropriateness is affected by other fac-
tors than the existence of a category—such as the
capability of a character creator’s use of linguis-
tic expressions that belong to our proposed cate-
gories, or a particular annotator’s like or dislike of
a particular category of linguistic expressions. To
reduce such possibilities as much as we can, we
used various characters and utilized various anno-
tators, which are listed in Tables 2 and 4 respec-
tively, and refrained from making conclusions of
this evaluation by only looking at the result of a
single character or a single annotator.

6 Conclusion and future work

With the aim of developing a natural language
generator that can express a particular character’s
linguistic style, we analyzed the linguistic pecu-
liarities of Japanese fictional characters. Our con-
tributions are as follows:

• We presented comprehensive categories of the
linguistic peculiarities of Japanese fictional
characters.

• We revealed the relationships between our pro-
posed categories of linguistic peculiarities
and the linguistic appropriateness for the
characters.

These contributions are supported by the exper-
imental results, which show that our proposed cat-

egories cover around 90% of the linguistic pecu-
liarities of 17 Japanese fictional characters (around
88% when we include actual human characters)
and that the character appropriateness scores and
the existence of our categories of linguistic pecu-
liarities are correlated to some extent.

As future work, we intend to develop a natu-
ral language generator that can express the lin-
guistic styles of particular characters on the basis
of the 13 categories presented in this paper. To
this end, we are first going to build a system that
has 13 kinds of modules to convert linguistic ex-
pressions, such as a module to convert utterances
without honorifics into those with honorifics (cor-
responds to category P3), a module to convert ut-
terances without relaxed pronunciations into those
with relaxed pronunciations (corresponds to cate-
gory P6), and so on, and that can combine arbi-
trary kinds of modules to express various linguis-
tic styles. After we build such a generator, we will
evaluate its performance in the characterization of
dialogue system utterances.
