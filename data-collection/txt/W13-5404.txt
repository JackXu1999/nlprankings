Abstract 

The work presented here depicts experiments 
toward the automatic classification of com-
plex-type nominals using distributional infor-
mation. We conducted two experiments: clas-
sifying complex-type nominals as members of 
multiple individual lexical classes, and build-
ing a dedicated classifier for complex-type 
nominals, distinguishing them from simple 
types. We discuss the promising results ob-
tained, with a focus on asymmetries observed 
and on lines to be explored in the future. 

1 Introduction 

In this article we evaluate the possibility to au-
tomatically identify dot-type nominals using dis-
tributional information extracted from corpus 
data. This work has a two-fold motivation. First, 
to contribute to a more accurate modeling of the 
lexicon, by providing a method towards a cost-
effective inclusion of dot-type information in 
Language Resources (LRs), which will thus mir-
ror a complex, systematic and productive linguis-
tic phenomenon. Second, to make this type of 
semantic information available in LRs to provide 
useful and often crucial information to Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) applications.  

Differing from simple-type nouns, complex 
types are composed of more than one constituent 
sense that can be recovered both individually and 
simultaneously in context, as illustrated below. 

(1) a. The church discussed its role in society at the 
gathering. (ORGANIZATION) 
b. The choir rehearses on Saturdays at the 
church. (LOCATION) 
c. There is a collection organized (ORGANIZA-
TION) by the church on Mulberry Street (LOCA-
TION) this Sunday.  

In this example the noun church, in (1a) de-
notes an ORGANIZATION, in (1b) a LOCATION and 

in (1c) the context requires the same single oc-
currence of the noun to denote both an ORGANI-
ZATION and a LOCATION. The complexity of dot-
object selectional behavior in context, as illu-
strated in (1), makes it difficult to apply to com-
plex types the standard notion of word sense, as 
used in automatic text processing tasks. Tradi-
tional word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tems, for instance, might be able to correctly 
identify the senses in both (1a) and (1b), howev-
er in (1c) a decision for a single sense would 
have to be made, despite the fact that both senses 
are simultaneously activated by the context.  

Having rich information available on complex 
types not only can reduce the search space in 
disambiguation tasks, and thus the number of 
decisions needed, but can also provide grounds 
to opt for the non-disambiguation of instances 
when relevant, for example in co-predication 
contexts like (1c). Moreover, knowledge of the 
entire sense potential of a given word is some-
times required for specific tasks (see for instance 
Rumshisky et al. (2007) and Lenci et al. (2010)).  

Thus, information on the sense composition 
of complex types can be crucial in NLP, as it 
allows for the reduction of the amount of lexical 
semantic processing (Buitelaar, 2000) in tasks 
such as Information Retrieval, semantic role an-
notation, high-quality Machine Translation and 
Summarization, as well as Question Answering.  

In this paper we evaluate the possibility to 
employ information from actual language use as 
encoded in corpus data to acquire information on 
the sense composition of complex types. In line 
with approaches that explore corpus-based defi-
nitions of fine-grained distinctions that emerge as 
abstractions over the combinatorial patterns of 
lexical items (Ježek and Lenci, 2007), we use a 
classification approach based strictly on distribu-
tional evidence available in a corpus to automati-
cally identify complex types. 



As most approaches in lexical semantic clas-
sification do not distinguish among related 
senses of the same word, considering it either as 
part of a class or not (Hindle, 1990; Bullinaria, 
2008; Bel et al., 2012), our goal is to outline a 
strategy which automatically accounts for those 
nouns that belong to multiple classes, specifical-
ly to pinpoint complex-type nouns using distribu-
tional evidence. In this context we discuss an 
experiment involving two complex types in Eng-
lish: LOCATION•ORGANIZATION (LOC•ORG) and 
EVENT•INFORMATION (EVT•INF). Our hypothesis 
is that complex-type nouns demonstrate charac-
teristic and indicative lexico-syntactic traits of 
more than one class, which allow us to use lex-
ico-syntactic patterns over corpus data to auto-
matically identify nouns for which there is distri-
butional evidence of their membership to more 
than one class.  

In the following, we review the motivation 
and theoretical background of this work (Section 
2); discuss data preparation (Section 3); present 
two classification experiments, discuss the results 
obtained (Section 4), and conclude with promis-
ing directions for future research (Section 5).  

2 Motivation and theoretical back-

ground 

2.1 Complex types 

Dot objects, or nouns with complex types, are 
composed by more than one constituent type, 
each representative of a distinct sense, between 
which holds a regular and predictable relation. 
As thoroughly discussed in the literature (Puste-
jovsky, 1995; 2005), there is strong linguistic 
motivation for considering the existence of such 
objects. First, the knowledge we have of con-
cepts associated with books and doors, for in-
stance, is not characterizable as a conjunction of 
simple types. Second, the notion of complex 
types captures a type of inherent logical polyse-
my, occurring in regular, predictable patterns, i.e. 
systematically recurrent, namely cross-
linguistically.  

Building on arguments that show traditional 
sense-enumerating lexicons are not only uneco-
nomical, but also present instances of systematic 
phenomena as arbitrary and idiosyncratic features 
of single words, which do not account for the pro-
ductive nature of their potential underlying regu-
larities (Pethrö, 2000), and thus render unfeasible 
the task of listing all possible meanings of a word 
(Kilgariff, 1992), the Generative Lexicon Theory 
(GL) (Pustejovsky, 1995) explores and formalizes 

the shifts of meaning of these objects in context. 
This represents an important step towards imple-
menting systems that can assign meaning to words 
dynamically depending on the context in which 
they occur (Cooper, 2005).  

Here we assume Pustejovsky’s (1995) defini-
tion of dot types as a Cartesian product of types 
with a particularly restricted interpretation. This 
means that the product τ1×τ2, of types τ1 and τ2, 
each denoting sets, alone does not adequately 
determine the semantics of the dot object. The 
relation R, which structures the component types, 
must also be seen as part of the definition of the 
semantics of the lexical conceptual paradigm of 
the complex type. Thus, for the dot object τ1•τ2 to 
be well-formed, there must be a relation R that 
structures the elements τ1 and τ2, a concept that is 
formalized in GL (Pustejovsky, 1995: 149) as: 

 
This formalization accounts for one of the 

properties that makes complex types unique and 
distinguishes them, for instance, from cases of 
homonymy1: the possibility for their distinctive 
senses to be active at the same time (Puste-
jovsky, 1995: 223), illustrated in (1c). The levels 
of representation and generative mechanisms in 
GL predict a noun like church, represented be-
low, occurs not only in contexts typical of class 
x: ORG (see (1a)) and of class y: LOC (see (1b)), 
but also in contexts which activate the relation 
R1(x,y), i.e. contexts where both ORG and LOC 
senses are simultaneously activated (see (1c)).  

 
These properties distinguish dot objects from 

simple types, unified types or standard generali-
zation on types (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995: 141 and 
ff.). Moreover, the possibility to have word 

                                                 
1  Utt and Padó (2011) consider the importance of this 
distinction, proposing an automatic polysemy classifier. 
Boleda et al. (2012) also put forth an approach for pre-
dicting regular sense alternations in corpus data. Howev-
er, both methods are based on external rich language 
resources, which besides only being available for a very 
restricted set of languages, do not necessarily mirror 
language use, as noted in the latter work.

senses that semantically compose these words 
either individually or simultaneously activated, 
depending on the selectional environment, 
presents a challenge to NLP systems that deal 
with identifying word senses in context. In fact, 
these follow a one-word, one-sense approach, 
designed to identify a single sense in each deci-
sion. Thus, as argued in Section 1, including in-
formation on the semantics of dot objects in LRs 
can contribute to an overall improvement in per-
formance of NLP systems. 

2.2 Exploring the Distributional Hypothesis 

to identify complex-type nouns 

Considering the above characterization of dot 
types, we assume them to be members of more 
than one lexical class, more precisely members 
of each class corresponding to the senses they are 
composed of. As members of more than one 
class, complex types are expected to occur in 
indicatory contexts of more than one individual 
class. With this in mind, we evaluate the possi-
bility to automatically identify complex types 
using a cue-based classification methodology.  

Based on the Distributional Hypothesis (Har-
ris, 1954), cue-based lexical semantic classifica-
tion (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001) builds on the 
assumption that lexical semantic classes are emer-
gent properties of a number of words that recur-
rently co-occur in a number of particular contexts. 
Thereby, as proposed by Bybee and Hopper 
(2001) and Bybee (2010), we understand lexical 
semantic classes as generalizations that come 
about when there is a systematic co-distribution 
for a number of words in a number of contexts. 
Different contexts where a number of words tend 
to occur thus become linguistic cues of a particu-
lar semantic property that a set of words has in 
common. Using these cues to gather indicatory 
distributional information provides evidence that 
discriminates members of a class from other lexi-
cal items. 

We hypothesize that the classification of a 
noun as a member of the different individual 
classes that correspond to the senses that com-
pose a complex type indicate its potential to be-
long to a given dot type. Parting from the cue-
based nominal lexical semantic classification 
work reported in Bel et al. (2012), we apply this 
methodology to complex-type nominals. This 
allows us to analyze the distributional behavior 
of nouns belonging to more than one class and to 
which extent binary classifiers can accurately 
deal with such items.  

As members of more than one class, we expect 
complex-type nouns to disperse their occurrences 
between indicatory contexts of different classes. 
Thereby, one of our goals consists in evaluating to 
which extent this can be problematic to binary 
classifiers. Specifically, we will verify whether 
the available distributional information indicatory 
of each individual class is strong enough for an 
automatic cue-based classification for this type of 
noun to work.  

3 Data preparation 

The sense composition of complex types dis-
cussed in previous sections forms the basis of our 
hypothesis in which we claim that these nomin-
als should exhibit linguistic behavior characteris-
tic of each simple-type class that makes up their 
sense composition. To verify this hypothesis and 
thus provide empirical evidence of multiple class 
membership for complex-type nouns, we imple-
mented the cue-based lexical semantic classifica-
tion experiment described below. 

3.1 Classes considered 

In line with the argument presented above, we 
focus on two complex types representative of the 
general characteristics of dot objects (Pustejovsky, 
1995; 2005; Rumshisky et al., 2007; Melloni and 
Ježek, 2009; Copestake and Herbelot, 2012): 

ORGANIZATION⋅⋅⋅⋅LOCATION (λx•y �R  [α 
(ORG(x)•LOC(y)∧R(x,y)]): “the church prays during 
mass” vs. “the church is a large building”  

EVENT⋅⋅⋅⋅INFORMATION (λx•y �R  [α (EVT(x) 
•INF(y)∧R(x,y)]): “the interview lasted for two 
hours” vs. “the interview was interesting”  

3.2 Description of the gold standard 

In their nominal classification experiments, 
Bel et al. (2012) used gold standards created by 
extracting nouns from WordNet (Miller et al., 
1990) which contained a sense corresponding to 
each of the lexical classes they studied. As our 
aim in this work is to automatically identify which 
nouns are complex-type nominals, we needed 
gold standards composed of nouns with the poten-
tial to be systematically interpreted in more than 
one sense to evaluate the results obtained in our 
experiments. As this information is usually not 
included in LRs, and specifically in Wordnet (see 
Boleda et al., 2012), we resorted to human annota-
tion to create the gold standards.  

Three experts, either native or highly profi-
cient English speakers, annotated each noun 
from the original Bel et al. (2012) lists for their 



potential to contain another known sense. The 
annotators were given the automatically ex-
tracted list of nouns from each class and were 
asked to annotate whether those nouns could 
have a specific sense, different from the one en-
coded in the original gold standard.  

Being simply provided with the original gold 
standard lists and a general definition of a target 
sense, annotators were asked to mark with yes or 
no whether they thought each individual noun in 
the list could be interpreted as a member of the 
target class, besides potentially having any other 
sense. With this annotated information, we used 
a voting scheme to build the gold standard, in-
cluding in it the nouns considered to be members 
of more than one class by at least two annotators.  

3.2.1 Asymmetry of sense components  

Previous work has reported asymmetries re-
garding the prominence of senses that compose 
complex types (see, for example, Rumshisky et 
al. (2007) and Ježek and Melloni (2011)), as one 
sense is more generally used or constitutes a pre-
ferred interpretation2. Confirming this observa-
tion, evidence from psycholinguistic studies 
(Frisson and Pickering, 2001) demonstrated that 
although more than one sense interpretation is 
available for a given word, the vast majority of 
speakers tend to consistently choose one inter-
pretation over the other.  

Several authors established relations between 
this type of asymmetry and complex types, par-
ticularly with regard to the nature of the relations 
holding between their sense components. An im-
portant part of the work developed on this matter 
has focused on classes whose sense components 
are ontologically related, in particular on the 
PROCESS•RESULT complex-type.  

Ježek and Melloni (2011) characterize the 
properties of the polysemy involved in this case 
arguing it arises from the fact that a RESULT ob-
ject type is temporally and causally dependant on 
a PROCESS type as an event is the pre-condition 
for the (coming into) existence of the object (RE-
SULT). Thus, PROCESS readings can be consi-
dered more prominent as they are also reflected 
when the RESULT sense is active while the re-
verse does not hold true. The EVT•INF complex 
type, can be considered a sub-case of the former. 
Formalized in (4), the aforementioned unique 

                                                 
2 As often discussed in the literature (e.g. Bybee, 2010), 
these two aspects are not independent from each other: fre-
quency of use tends to impact preferred interpretations. This 
is nonetheless a debate outside the scope of this work. 

properties of this dot type are represented in the 
AGENTIVE role. 

 
Just as is the case for PROCESS•RESULT nomin-

als, we expect the prominence of senses for this 
complex type to be asymmetric. The data obtained 
in our annotation task are consistent with this ex-
pectation (see Table 1), as 90 of the 149 INFOR-
MATION nouns in Bel et al.’s (2012) gold standard 
are considered to also have an EVENT sense, whe-
reas only 9 of the 273 EVENT nouns are annotated 
as also having an INFORMATION sense. Moreover, 
these human annotation results constitute a source 
of quantitative information providing evidence 
that support the existence of asymmetries of 
prominence of the different sense components of 
complex types.

Table 1. Distribution of dot types per lexical class 

Regarding the LOC•ORG complex type, there 
is neither an ontological relation between its 
meaning components nor such a clear asymmetry 
in the prominence of its sense components. Yet, 
differences observed can be attributed to rela-
tions generally holding between objects in the 
world. For instance, an ORGANIZATION, as a 
more abstract concept, is typically associated to a 
physical reality, namely the LOCATION which 
hosts this abstract object and makes it “perceiva-
ble”. Reversely, LOCATION, as a physical point in 
space, is often independent of any other reality. 
Thus, in the lexicon, we observe words primarily 
denoting an ORGANIZATION that also refer to the 
LOCATION that hosts it, whereas the reverse is 
observed only in considerably stricter conditions, 
as illustrated by congress and schoolyard in (5). 

(5) a. The congress (ORG) decided to vote the new 
rule into power after the recess. 
b. The new rule was voted to power in the 
congress (ORG or LOC). 
c. #The schoolyard decided to vote the new 
law into power after the recess. 
d. The new rule was voted to power in the 
schoolyard (LOC).

Asymmetry in the prominence of complex-type 
sense components is thus related to the nature of 
the systematic relation holding between them, 
which is different for each complex-type paradigm. 
Moreover, the ratio of nouns in each individual 
class annotated as having more than one potential 
sense, makes apparent the representativity of this 
phenomenon for each class (see Table 1). This pro-
vides crucial insight when analyzing our results, 
particularly to evaluate whether the asymmetries 
reported in this section have an overall impact in 
the automatic identification of complex types.  

4 Experiments  

In our experiments, we considered English 
nouns from the LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, IN-
FORMATION, and EVENT classes. We used a part of 
the UkWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) consisting 
of 60 million PoS-tagged tokens. To gather distri-
butional evidence, we employed lexico-syntactic 
patterns indicatory of each individual class includ-
ing prepositions, selectional preferences, grammat-
ical functions and morphological information (see 
Bel et al. (2012) for a detailed description of pat-
terns used). Each pattern was translated into a reg-
ular expression used over the corpus to identify 
occurrences of nouns in marked contexts. The rela-
tive frequency of occurrence of each noun in each 
cue was stored in an n-dimensional vector, where n 
is the total number of cues used for each class. To 
classify, we used a Logistic Model Trees (LMT) 
(Landwehr et al., 2005) Decision Tree classifier in 
the WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005) implementa-
tion. 

As detailed in Section 3.2, our gold standards 
are derived from the lists used by Bel et al. 
(2012) to reflect the phenomenon of multiple 
class membership of complex types. As there is a 
larger ratio of simple types in language, which is 
mirrored in our gold standards (see Table 2), a 
baseline based on the majority class would not 
allow us to assess the quality of the results de-
picted here. Thereby, to evaluate our results, we 
compare them against the performance of state-
of-the-art classifiers for simple types, reported in 
Bel et al. (2012). 

4.1 Complex types as members of individu-

al simple-type classes 

As mentioned earlier, the basic hypothesis for 
our experiments is that complex-type nominals, 
as members of more than one lexical class (see 
Section 2 for more details), demonstrate charac-
teristic lexico-syntactic traits of multiple classes, 
and thus occur in indicatory contexts of the dif-

ferent classes that correspond to their sense com-
ponents. However, as members of more than one 
class, the distributional behavior of complex-type 
nouns is expected to be more disperse, as occur-
rences are divided between indicative contexts of 
different classes. Given this, the experiment re-
ported in this section aims to provide evidence as 
to whether this distributional information, though 
disperse, is strong enough to allow for an auto-
matic identification of the different sense com-
ponents of complex types in a classification task. 

To accomplish this, we used the binary clas-
sifiers described in Bel et al. (2012), which were 
developed to automatically classify nouns into 
previously known lexical semantic classes, not 
taking into consideration polysemy. Based on 
word occurrences in specific contexts in a cor-
pus, these classifiers simply consider a given 
noun either as a member of a class or not.  

In the experiment reported in this section, we 
used a binary classifier for each sense component 
(organization, location, event and informational 
object) of the complex types considered. We 
started by verifying the binary classifiers capaci-
ty to identify complex-type nouns as members of 
the class corresponding to their most prominent 
sense, indicated in bold in Table 2.

ly classified as mem-
bers of the class (%)

ORG•LOC as LOC 89.47 0.25 
EVT•INFO as INFO 71.11 0.43 
EVT•INFO as EVT 77.78 0.03 

Table 2. Complex types correctly identified as mem-

bers of the class corresponding to their prominent sense 

The results reported in Table 2 make apparent 
that dot-type nominals provide enough distribu-
tional evidence indicatory of their most promi-
nent sense so that their automatic classification 
as members of the class it corresponds to is poss-
ible. The results obtained are actually in line with 
the performance of the same classifiers with 
simple-type nominals reported by Bel et al. 
(2012), where a 66.21% and a 73.05% accuracy 
are obtained respectively for the LOCATION and the 
EVENT nouns classifiers.  

With this in mind, we proceeded to verify 
whether this is also observed when considering 
less prominent sense components by performing a 
cross-classification of the nouns in our study using 
the binary classifiers mentioned above, essentially 
emulating the human annotation task described in 
Section 3.2. More precisely, we used trained bi-



nary classifiers for each class to classify the hu-
man-annotated lists of nouns, i.e. each classifier 
trained for simple-type classification of nouns of 
semantic type τ1 was provided with a list of nouns 
with τ2 as their prominent sense. 

To illustrate this, a noun like church, defined 
as a LOCATION (τ1) in Bel et al.’s (2012) gold 
standards, was checked for its occurrence in lex-
ico-syntactic patterns indicatory of ORGANIZA-
TION (τ2) nouns, i.e. whether it shows distribu-
tional evidence indicatory of another class. Our 
claim is that having τ1 nouns that occur in con-
texts indicatory of τ2 allowing them to be classi-
fied as members of τ2 provides evidence toward 
our hypothesis: given the sense composition of 
complex types, they should be considered mem-
bers of more than one lexical semantic class, a 
fact that automatic classifiers should account for. 

Table 3 presents the results of precision and 
recall of the cross-classification of complex-type 
nouns as members of the class corresponding to 
non-prominent sense components, in bold.  

 Precision Recall Ratio  
ORG•LOC as LOC 77.78 15.21 0.06 
ORG•LOC as ORG 57.14 21.05 0.06 
EVT•INFO as EVT 64.44 32.22 0.19 
EVT•INFO as INFO 6.67 66.67 0.03 

Table 3. Results of cross-classification (in %)  

With our cross-classification, we replicate the 
annotation task automatically (see Section 3.2). 
The results in Table 3 allow us to make three 
main observations. First, the performance of 
cross-classification is in line with that of the 
classifiers used when dealing with simple-type 
nominals and when classifying complex types as 
members of the class corresponding to its most 
prominent sense component3. This indicates that 
complex types do occur in contexts typical of the 
different classes corresponding to their sense 
components, i.e. they belong to more than one 
class and behave as such.  

The second aspect made apparent from the re-
sults in Table 3 is the overall low recall. These 
results are consistent with the work of Rum-
shisky et al. (2007) and the discussion in Section 
3.2.1, specifically the asymmetries in terms of 
prominence of the different meaning components 
of complex types. This is reflected in the fre-
quency of occurrences in contexts indicatory of a 
given class, which represents the information 
provided to our classifiers.  
                                                 
3 The low precision reported for EVT•INFO as INFO is not 
independent of the reduced amount of nouns (9) of this type 
in the gold standard (see Table 1). 

The noun church, for instance, occurred in 
contexts typical of LOCATION nouns with a rela-
tive frequency of 0.015 and of 0.030 in contexts 
typical of ORGANIZATION nouns. This is also the 
case of the noun jurisdiction, which occurred 
with a relative frequency of 0.039 in contexts 
typical of ORGANIZATION nouns and just 0.014 in 
contexts typical of LOCATION nouns. This pro-
vides evidence that more distributional informa-
tion is available toward one sense over another, 
which is bound to affect classification results, 
particularly when the asymmetry is large.  

Thus, the representation of senses in distribu-
tional data has an impact on our classification 
results, being responsible, in particular, for insuf-
ficient distributional evidence towards class 
membership for an important part of nouns in our 
list, which explains the low recall observed.  

Thirdly, although the absolute numbers are 
lower due to the aforementioned recall, the ratio of 
complex types per class shows similar tendencies 
to the human annotation results. In fact, the ratios 
of complex types for the ORGANIZATION and LO-
CATION classes are balanced, along the lines of the 
human annotation results (see Table 1), whereas a 
big asymmetry is observed for the INFORMATION 
and EVENT classes, again mirroring the human 
annotation results (see Section 3.2.1).  

Given our objective to verify whether com-
plex-type nominals provide distributional evi-
dence concurrent with more than one semantic 
class, our cross-classification experiment shows 
that the distributional information available gen-
erally indicates that complex types demonstrate a 
distributional behavior typical of members of 
more than one class, though the information 
available is not enough to correctly classify a 
part of the nouns studied, as indicated by the low 
recall observed in Table 3.  

However, in this experiment we only consider 
a part of the distributional data for each complex 
type at a time. Having demonstrated that com-
plex types show distributional behavior typical of 
members of more than one class and being clear 
that more information has to be considered for 
classifiers to achieve a better performance, we 
propose to include indicatory contexts of each of 
the classes composing the complex type in the 
same classifier, this way accounting for its full 
sense potential in the classification task. 

4.2 Distinguishing complex types from sim-

ple-type nouns 

The experiments described in Section 4.1 
show that complex-type distributional evidence 



is indicatory of class membership to more than 
one class, but also that individually this informa-
tion is often not sufficient for automatic systems 
to perform accurately and robustly. Thus, we put 
forth a new experiment to classify complex types 
built upon these observations. Our cross-
classification experiments considered distribu-
tional information available for each word in 
contexts indicative of each class corresponding 
to one of its senses individually. In this section 
we depict an experiment where we combine con-
textual cues indicatory of each individual class 
that corresponds to the different sense compo-
nents of a complex type to train a classifier.  

The goal of this experiment is to automatical-
ly distinguish complex types from simple types 
by training a dedicated classifier. This approach 
combines the distributional information characte-
ristic of each individual sense component of the 
complex type in a single classifier, providing it 
with more information at a time, which we ex-
pect to raise both precision and recall. Along this 
line, we collected distributional evidence of 
nouns by simultaneously using the cues for each 
class corresponding to the different sense com-
ponents of the complex types considered in this 
work. We provided this information to the clas-
sifier as well as the human annotated gold stan-
dard for training. As in the previous experiment, 
we used LMTs (Landwehr et al., 2005), this time 
in a 10 fold cross-validation setting. Table 4 
presents the results of the classification of 
ORG•LOC and EVT•INF complex types. 

 Accuracy Precision Recall F-Measure 
ORG•LOC 67.68% 0.62 0.67 0.62 
EVT•INFO 78.75%  0.72 0.78 0.72 

Table 4. Results of complex-type classifiers 

The results above demonstrate that by com-
bining cues indicatory of different individual se-
mantic classes and thus providing distributional 
evidence of the entire sense potential of a com-
plex-type to the classifier we are able to automat-
ically classify complex types, distinguishing 
them from simple-type nominals. As in the pre-
vious experiment, in order to be distinguished 
from simple-type nominals, complex types must 
demonstrate sufficient distributional evidence in 
contexts indicatory of classes corresponding to 
their different sense components.  

By combining the distributional information 
indicatory of two classes and providing it simul-
taneously to the classifier, we improve the results 
previously obtained and attain accuracy in line 
with state-of-the-art simple-type classifiers (see 

Bel et al.’s (2012) results regarding nominal lexical 
semantic classification in English). Moreover, this 
approach overcomes the main issue in the results 
depicted in Section 4.1, which was low recall.  

A final observation on the results attained re-
gards the difference of more than 10% of accura-
cy between the classifiers for both complex types 
considered. Previously discussed work by Ježek 
and Melloni (2011) (see Section 3.2.1) help us 
identify possible causes for these contrasts, such 
as an ontological dependence between compo-
nent types of dot types like EVT•INF, whose oc-
currences have both sense components of the dot 
object generally simultaneously present. Howev-
er, the same is not true for complex types such as 
ORG•LOC nouns, which results in a more disperse 
distributional behavior between indicatory con-
texts of each sense component of the dot object, 
constituting a challenge for classifiers, which 
naturally impacts performance.  

5 Final Remarks 

The classifiers developed in this work consid-
er contexts indicatory of each nominal class that 
corresponds to a sense component of a complex-
type. As shown, our classifiers are able to auto-
matically identify nouns that display characteris-
tic properties of different simple types, namely 
LOCATION and ORGANIZATION, and EVENT and 
INFORMATION. By achieving this, we demon-
strate the validity of our hypothesis that dot-
object nouns simultaneously display distribution-
al characteristics of the different classes that cor-
respond to their sense components.  

Although, we obtain results in line with state-
of-the-art performance of simple-type classifiers 
by combining contextual information for the dif-
ferent sense components of complex types, we 
still do not capture those contexts where only 
dot-type nouns can occur (i.e. contexts that are 
unique to these nouns and clearly separate them 
from simple types and homonyms). Given the 
specific properties of EVT•INF nouns, the weight 
of this type of contexts can be hinted by the dif-
ferent performance of the classifiers developed, 
as discussed in the previous section.  

In future work we will evaluate to which extent 
using the contexts specific to complex types, i.e. 
contexts which “convoke” different sense compo-
nents simultaneously (see, for instance, Šimon and 
Huang (2009), Pustejovsky (2007) and Cruse 
(2000)), can result in a still more reliable classifier, 
with the potential to contribute to cost-effectively 
create more accurate LRs for NLP.
