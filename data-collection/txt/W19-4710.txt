Abstract

We aim to provide computational evidence for
the era of authorship of two important old Thai
texts: Traiphumikatha and Pumratchatham.
The era of authorship of these two books is
still an ongoing debate among Thai literature
scholars. Analysis of old Thai texts present
a challenge for standard natural language pro-
cessing techniques, due to the lack of cor-
pora necessary for building old Thai word and
syllable segmentation. We propose an accu-
rate and interpretable model to classify each
segment as one of the three eras of author-
ship (Sukhothai, Ayuddhya, or Rattanakosin)
without sophisticated linguistic preprocessing.
Contrary to previous hypotheses, our model
suggests that both books were written during
the Sukhothai era. Moreover, the second half
of the Pumratchtham is uncharacteristic of the
Sukhothai era, which may have confounded
literary scholars in the past. Further, our
model reveals that the most indicative linguis-
tic changes stem from unidirectional gram-
maticalized words and polyfunctional words,
which show up as most dominant features in
the model.

1 Introduction

The time periods of authorship for many of the old
Thai texts are still being disputed and debated, as
the identities of the authors are not always well es-
tablished. Previous approaches often require di-
achronic close reading of the text to identify the
key elements of style or specific linguistic changes
that characterize the writing of the era. Such anal-
ysis is limited to qualitative accounts drawn from
hand-selected textual evidence. In this work, we
build a model that infers the time period of au-
thorship for old Thai prose and reveals diachronic
linguistic changes while tolerating the natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) resources and corpora.

Computational approaches analyzing semantic
change in old Thai text face many critical chal-
lenges due to poverty of NLP resources. The field
lacks texts that could serve as representative ex-
amples from each era because solid historical ev-
idence can identify the time of writing for only a
few texts. Old Thai prose is especially rare. Con-
sequently, we do not have enough texts to re-train
syllable and word segmenters or fit classification
models. The currently available Thai syllable and
word segmentation algorithms do not performwell
on old Thai text, owing to dramatically different
orthography and vocabulary. Worse still, some
representative Thai texts are significantly damaged
inscriptions on stones, which impede sentence-
level or even word-level analysis. Thus, to analyze
old Thai prose, we cannot rely on automatic syl-
lable and word segmentation, nor on models that
require large amounts of data from the same era.

In this work, we propose an accurate and in-
terpretable classification model for analyzing the
time period of authorship from textual segments
of old Thai prose from Traiphumikatha (ไตรภูมิกถา)
andPumratchatham (ปูมราชธรรม), whose time of au-
thorship is still debated. Unlike most author attri-
bution models, our model scans through and op-
erates at the text segment level; hence the name
Maximum Entropy Searchlight model. The model
uses varying-length character n-grams as features
to classify textual segments into one of the eras.
We shrink the model coefficients to reveal the
character n-grams that are distinguishing linguis-
tic features of each era. The model spotlights spe-
cific text segments that are characteristic of the era
where the book was written and provides compu-
tational evidence of the era of authorship for the
books in question.

The main contribution of this work can be sum-
marized as follows:



82

• We propose an accurate and interpretable
model for identifying the era of authorship of
old Thai prose. The model classifies text seg-
ments with high accuracy, reveals some of the
linguistic changes from the Sukhothai to the
Ayuddhya era, and serves as a visualization
tool for further linguistic analysis.

• We are the first to provide statistical evidence
that Traiphumikatha and Pumratchatham
might be both written in the Sukhothai era,
contrary to previous hypotheses.

• As a more general principle, we conclude that
grammaticalized words and polyfunctional-
ized words are the strongest distinguishing in-
dicators of prose from the Sukhothai era.

2 Background and Related Work

In diachronic studies, Thai language eras are
roughly divided by historical timeline of state es-
tablishment: Sukhothai (1249-1438), Ayuddhya
(1350-1767), Thonburi (1767-1782), and Rat-
tanakosin (1767-present). Ayuddhya and Rat-
tanakosin eras are sometimes further divided into
'early,' 'mid,' and ‘late,' depending on the individ-
ual research purposes. Due to the gradually chang-
ing nature of languages, a language change can
be observed only when the language samples in
comparison are taken from quite distant eras. It
is widely believed that Traiphumikatha was writ-
ten in Sukhothai era although the oldest copy was
found in Thonburi era and the proof of era of au-
thorship was never rigorously established (Eawsri-
wong, 1982). Pumratchatham is believed to be
written during late Ayuddhya (1688-1767) as the
orthography and letter types appear on the first
page were usually found in late Ayuddhya books.
Our task can be seen as an author attribution

problem or style-change detection problem. These
models have utilized all levels of features: lexi-
cal, character, syntactic, discourse, and structural
(Stamatatos, 2009; Ferracane et al., 2017). Various
neural network architectures have been explored in
the context of this task (Shrestha et al., 2017). Yet,
our task differs in that each class has a mixture of
authors. We want to use feature-based models for
their interpretability, plus want the model to be ac-
curate at the level of small text segments.

เหตุโกษาปานไปฝรังเศส) (Ayuddhya era), and Histori-
cal Archive on Luang Udomsombat (จดหมายเหตุหลวง
อุดมสมบติั) (Rattakosin era). The stone inscriptions
vary in their quality, as some are broken stone frag-
ments and not full texts. The identity of the authors
of these inscriptions is either unknown or disputed.
Traiphumikatha and Pumratchatham are the two
texts whose time of authorship we want to investi-
gate. We use the manually cleaned version of the
texts used by literary scholars because different or-
thography could bias the models. The data sizes
and the class distribution are shown in Table 2.
Our goal is to create a three-way (Sukhothai vs

Ayuddhya vs Rattanakosin) classification model
that is accurate enough to give us statistical ev-
idence for time of authorship, and interpretable
enough to reveal linguistic changes that might re-
quire further analysis at the small segment level.
We proposeMaximumEntropy Searchlightmodel,
which is a multi-class logistic regression model (or
Maximum Entropy model) with bag of varying-
length character n-gram features and an L1 penalty
(Tibshirani, 1996). We formulate the task as text
segment classification, with each text divided into
non-overlapping contiguous character segments.
Numerals, indentation, and punctuations serve as
segment dividers, but we cap the segment length
to be at most 40 characters, which is right around
the median segment lengths.
The model scans through each substring of each

segment like a searchlight sweeping across the
text, hence the name of the model. The L1 penalty
acts as a feature selection mechanism to restrain
the model to keep only a handful of interpretable
features, while shrinking the rest to zero. Since our
model is saturatedwith both redundant and unhelp-
ful features, this penalty is suitable.
Should we use fixed-length n-grams or

varying-length n-grams? We run 10-fold cross-
validation to compute the accuracy rates of fixed-

the books to be able to classify the rest at high accuracy.

length n-gram models and varying-length n-gram
models (n ∈ [2, 6]). The varying-length n-gram
models outperform the best fixed-length models
although the L1 penalty shrinks the number of pa-
rameters of both types of models to be quite simi-
lar (Table 2). The best model only requires (non-
zero) 1190 parameters. Our results suggest that
varying-length n-gram features are more effective
than fixed-length n-gram features even when the
number of the parameters are comparable.
Is the model accurate enough to use for un-

known texts? We vary the amount of training data
from around 4% (454 segments) to 75% (9029 seg-
ments) and test the model on the test set, which
constitutes the remaining 25% of each book. The
final model uses varying-length character n-grams
with n ∈ [2, 6], without fitting the intercepts. The

Sukhothai 0.96 0.85 0.90
Ayuddhya 0.98 0.95 0.97
Rattanakosin 0.99 0.99 0.99
Macro average 0.98 0.93 0.95
Micro average 0.98 0.98 0.98

Table 3: Classification results based on the best cross-
validated model

accuracy of the model grows logarithmically with
the amount of training data, like a typical learn-
ing curve of a classifier (Figure 1). Strikingly, the
model requires only 40% (4815 segments) of the
text from each era to achieve 98% accuracy (Ta-
ble 3). This low training fraction suggests that
the style of writing varies substantially across eras,
because the model can capture most of the varia-
tion with substantially fewer samples than avail-
able. This result also suggests that we can readily
apply this model on texts whose era of authorship
is unknown.
Does themodel present interpretable results?

We examine the 30 most salient model coeffi-
cients (weights) for linguistic changes. For the
Sukhothai era, 15 of those features correspond
to known changes studied in Thai historical lin-
guistics. Examples include /lɛ́:w/ and /jù:/ (Sripr-
asit, 2003), /pen/ (Jaratjarungkiat, 2012), /thɯ̌ŋ/
and /thɤ̌ŋ/ (Rodphan, 2012), /mí/ and /bɔ̀mí/ (Jam-
pathip, 2014), and /ʔân/ /nân/ and /nán/ (Suwang-
phanich, 2017). This correspondence demon-
strates how our model can pinpoint specific words
for further linguistic analyses.

4 When were Traiphumikatha and
Pumratchatham written?

We classify each 40-character segment of the text
and gather the computational evidence for the era
of authorship. For each of the two books, we com-
pute the distribution of eras as classified by the
model, along with the total log-likelihood of each
era given the model. We also compute the distri-
bution of high-confidence classifications for each
era, where the score exceeds 0.9. 46% and 41%
of the segments from Traiphumikatha and Pum-
ratchatham, respectively, pass this 0.9 threshold
(Table 4). The model excludes the intercept terms,
to avoid biasing the classification.
Our model supports the hypothesis that Pum-

ratchatham was written in the Sukhothai era, con-
trary to what is popularly believed. 66.8% and
57% of the segments from Traiphumikatha and
Pumratchatham respectively are classified asmore
similar to the stone inscriptions from the Sukhothai
era. Many scholars have hypothesized that Trai-
phumikathamight be written in the Ayuddhya era.
Surprisingly, our model gives very little evidence
to support this hypothesis, as less than 5% of the
segments are classified as Ayuddhya.

sualizes potential style changes within the book
and spotlights the regions that deserve further in-
vestigation. We group 40-character text segments
into a blocks and visualize the majority class for
each block (Figure 2). It turns out that the non-
Sukhothai parts of Pumratchatham are clustered
towards the end of the book, while non-Sukhothai
parts are distributed more uniformly in Traiphu-
mikatha. The era of authorship of this book may
be more contested for this reason.

5 Grammaticalization and
Polyfunctionalization across Eras

Some of the most common features are words that
undergo the process of grammaticalization over
time such as /lɛ́:w/, /jù:/, and /pen/. Grammatical-
ization refers to the phenomenon where a lexical
item becomes a grammatical marker and develops
new grammatical functions (Hopper and Traugott,
2003). Grammaticalization is unidirectional in the
sense that grammatical forms and markers cannot
become lexical again. This implies that the linguis-
tic characteristics of a grammaticalized word are
different in each stage of changes. Thus, gram-
maticalized words can strongly characterize eras.
Polyfunctional words (words that can take mul-

tiple part of speech tags) form another group of
linguistic changes indicative of eras of authorship.
We found 6 words to be polyfunctional observable
in synchronic Thai grammar. These are /sǐ:a/, as
verb and completive aspect marker (Iwasaki et al.,
2005), /hɛ̀ŋ/ and /khâ:ŋ/, as noun and preposition,
/thâw/, as noun and adverb, /bâ:ŋ/, as pronoun and
adverb (Royal Institute dictionary B.E. 2554) and
/ʔɔ̀:k/, as verb and adverb (Wongsri, 2004). Poly-

functionality of a word can be seen as a synchronic
product of the unidirectional grammaticalization
process called `layering', which is the persistence
of older forms and meanings alongside newer ones
(Hopper and Traugott, 2003) . Our model reveals
this synchronic state of grammaticalization and
unidirectional linguistic changes that characterize
the differences across the eras.
In sum, 15 of 30 extracted words given by the

model can be best explained in a single theme of
unidirectionality of change, a tendency that forms
the backbone of grammaticalization (diachronic
change) and layering (synchronic resultant state of
the change). Thus, these words, along with gram-
maticalization perspective, can best validate the
Maximum Entropy Searchlight Model as a tool to
provide the statistical evidence for the era of au-
thorship.

6 Conclusion

We present the Maximum Entropy Searchlight
model, an accurate and interpretable model for
identifying the era of authorship of old Thai prose.
The model lends reliable computational evidence
for the era of authorship because it can classify the
era of the ground truth text collections at almost
perfect accuracy. In addition, the model can shed
light on each individual segment to discover spe-
cific linguistic changes that are important indica-
tors for each era. These attributes not only speed
up the process of qualitative linguistic analysis, but
also reveal an overarching theme of unidirectional
grammaticalization, characterizing the differences
across the eras.
