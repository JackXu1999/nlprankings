Abstract

Multiword expressions (MWEs) feature
prominently in the mental lexicon of native
speakers (Jackendoff, 1997) in all languages
and domains, from informal to technical
contexts (Biber et al., 1999) with about
four MWEs being produced per minute of
discourse (Glucksberg, 1989). MWEs come
in all shapes and forms, including idioms like
rock the boat (as cause problems or disturb a
situation) and compound nouns like monkey
business (as dishonest behaviour). Their
accurate detection and understanding may
often require more than knowledge about
individual words and how they can be com-
bined (Fillmore, 1979), as they may display
various degrees of idiosyncrasy, including
lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical (Sag
et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010), which
provide new challenges and opportunities for
language processing (Constant et al., 2017).
For instance, while for some combinations
the meaning can be inferred from their parts
like olive oil (oil made of olives) this is not
always the case, as in dark horse (meaning
an unknown candidate who unexpectedly
succeeds), and when processing a sentence
some of the challenges are to identify which
words form an expression (Ramisch, 2015),
and whether the expression is idiomatic
(Cordeiro et al., 2019). In this talk I will give
an overview of advances on the identification
and treatment of multiword expressions, in
particular concentrating on techniques for
identifying their degree of idiomaticity.
