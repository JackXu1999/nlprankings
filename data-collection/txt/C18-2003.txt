Abstract

We here introduce a substantially extended version of JESEME, an interactive website for visu-
ally exploring computationally derived time-variant information on word meanings and lexical
emotions assembled from five large diachronic text corpora. JESEME is designed for scholars in
the (digital) humanities as an alternative to consulting manually compiled, printed dictionaries
for such information (if available at all). This tool uniquely combines state-of-the-art distribu-
tional semantics with a nuanced model of human emotions, two information streams we deem
beneficial for a data-driven interpretation of texts in the humanities.

1 Introduction

Historical, manually compiled dictionaries are central to many kinds of studies in the humanities, since
they provide scholars with information about the lexical meaning of terms in former time periods. Yet,
this traditional approach is limited in many ways, coverage being perhaps the most pressing issue: Is a
dictionary for the specific time period a scholar is investigating really available and, if so, does it cover
all of the lexical items of interest?

Word embeddings have been proposed as a technical vehicle to increase lexical coverage (Kim et al.,
2014). However, they require locally installed software and time-consuming calculations, thus being ill-
suited for mostly non-technical users in the humanities. As an alternative, we here present an extended
version of JESEME, a user-friendly open source website1 for accessing embedding-derived diachronic
information on lexical meaning and emotion. The first release of JESEME (Hellrich and Hahn, 2017b)
mainly provided time-variant diachronic lexical semantic information. Its second version, the focus of
this paper, excels with the unique capability to additionally track the diachronic emotional connotation
of words in parallel with their lexical semantics. Such a functionality is widely considered beneficial for
the data-driven interpretation of literary text genres (Kim et al., 2017).

Measuring affective information on the lexical level is an active field of research in computational lin-
guistics (Liu, 2015). Yet, most contributions focus on contemporary language and are limited to shallow
representations of human emotions, mainly distinguishing between positive and negative feelings. Cur-
rent research in sentiment analysis either starts to include historical trends in word polarity (Hamilton
et al., 2016a) or incorporates more nuanced models of emotions, such as Valence-Arousal-Dominance
(Buechel and Hahn, 2018). This contribution integrates both lines of work in a unique way based on our
prior research activities (Buechel et al., 2016; Buechel et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, only
few systems share similarities with JESEME. Alternative websites for tracking diachronic word meaning
yet offer far less diverse collections of corpora compared to JESEME and neither of them incorporates
emotion values attached to lexical entries. For example, Arendt and Volkova (2017) provide only short
term trends in word similarity in two social media corpora in their ESTEEM system.2 The system3 by

The DIACHRONIC EXPLORER4 which uses sparse vector representations instead of word embeddings to
calculate lexical similarity is limited to the Spanish Google Books corpus (Gamallo et al., 2018).

2 Architecture and Website

Figure 2: JESEME in operation I: Meaning change of “heart” rel-
ative to reference words since the 1830s in the COHA.

JESEME uses five diachronic cor-
pora: the Google Books N-Gram
Corpus for German and its En-
glish fiction register (Michel et al.,
2011), the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA; Davies
(2012)), the Deutsches Textarchiv
[‘German Text Archive’] (Geyken,
2013) and the Royal Society Cor-
pus (Kermes et al., 2016). To en-
sure high embedding quality, these
corpora are divided into temporal
slices of similar size covering be-
tween 10 to 50 years each.

JESEME’s processing pipeline
is depicted in Figure 1. It starts
with orthographically normalizing
the corpus slices, i.e., lower casing
only for English and a historical
spelling-aware lemmatization for
German (Jurish, 2013). We then
use a modified version of HYPER-
WORDS5 to calculate slice-specific
embedding models with SVDPPMI (Levy et al., 2015). This algorithm was chosen for its superior re-
liability which is essential for interpreting local neighborhoods in embedding spaces as is done in the
remainder of this paper (Hellrich and Hahn, 2016; Hellrich and Hahn, 2017a). Apart from word vec-
tors, we also calculate word-based co-occurrence statistics, frequency information and emotion values
for each slice (see Section 3). All this information is stored in a relational database. Compared to Hell-
rich and Hahn (2017b), our current version also reduces the database size from approximately 120GB to
40GB. This is achieved by storing word vectors instead of pre-computed similarity scores. Unlike the
previous version, semantic similarity between most words will be computed on the fly. Only the most

similar ones for each word (automatically picked as references) are cached for fast retrieval.
JESEME’s website prompts a search form for selecting the word under scrutiny as well as one of

the five corpora we supply. Its result page then provides graphs depicting the development of semantic
similarity to automatically chosen reference words over time as an indicator for semantic change, as well
as information on diachronic affective meaning (see Figure 2). These two main sources of information are
complemented with information on word co-occurrence and relative frequency, thus providing scholars
with additional information to increase interpretability and rule out measurement artifacts. Users may
also add further reference words to the analysis on demand. Besides this graphical interface JESEME
also offers a REST API.6

3 Representing and Computing Emotions

We represent emotions following the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) scheme (Bradley and Lang,
1994), one of the major models of emotion in psychology (for an illustration, see Figure 3). The VAD
model describes affective states relative to three dimensions, namely, Valence (degree of displeasure vs.
pleasure), Arousal (degree of calmness vs. excitement) and Dominance (degree of perceived control in a
social situation).

Figure 3: Affective space spanned by the Valence-Arousal-
Dominance (VAD) model, together with the position of six basic
emotion categories. Adapted from Buechel and Hahn (2016).

We used a modified version of
the emotion induction algorithm
by Turney and Littman (2003)
based on evidence that it outper-
forms alternative methods for his-
torical emotion lexicon creation
(Buechel et al., 2017; Hellrich et
al., 2018). In this work, each
word’s predicted emotion value
ê(w) is calculated by averaging
the emotion values e(s) for each
member s of a seed set S, with
sim(w, s), the similarity between
w and s, serving as a weight:

ê(w) :=

∑
s∈S sim(w, s)× e(s)∑

s∈S sim(w, s)

For the emotion scores stored in
JESEME, we used the emotion lex-
icons by Warriner et al. (2013) and
Schmidtke et al. (2014) as seed sets for English and German corpora, respectively. Word emotions were
induced independently for each temporal corpus slice, using the respective embedding model to retrieve
similarity scores. Hence, the similarity between the seed words and the target word reflects word usage at
a given language stage, thereby infusing historical emotion information into the resulting emotion ratings
(Buechel et al., 2017).

4 Examples

The new insights provided by diachronic emotion models can be demonstrated by re-visiting the example
of “heart” we used in Hellrich and Hahn (2017b) as shown in Figure 2. This lexeme is often used
metaphorically or metonymically despite the fact that the heart’s anatomical function was already known
for a long time. Results for our novel emotion tracking functionality match a move from metaphorical
to anatomical usage we previously observed in the genre-balanced COHA. Around 1900, the similarity
of “heart” to words such as “stroke” increases, while Dominance and Valence ratings drop sharply in

tandem (see Figure 2; y-axis values are centered and scaled). This simultaneous drop seems plausible,
since we can “change our heart” in a metaphorical sense, yet have little control over our anatomical
heart. Also, with its increasing anatomical usage, “heart” becomes less positive, since we are under
mortal threat by cardiovascular diseases such as a “stroke”.

Figure 4: JESEME in operation II: Meaning of “woman” since the
1830s in the COHA.

Changes in emotion can also be
traced for items with a more con-
stant meaning, e.g., for “woman”
as shown in Figure 4. Here sim-
ilarity scores for the most sim-
ilar words—“man” and “girl”—
remain rather static. Yet, emo-
tion values are highly dynamic and
seem to match turning points in
women’s rights movement, e.g.,
women’s suffrage in the US is con-
nected with an increase in all VAD
dimensions for the 1920s.

5 Conclusion

We introduced a substantially ex-
tended version of JESEME, an in-
teractive website for tracking di-
achronic changes in word meaning
and, as a novel and unique feature,
word emotion. To the best of our
knowledge, no other system com-
bines these two traits. JESEME al-
lows users with a limited techni-
cal background to interactively ex-
plore semantic evolution based on
five large diachronic corpora for two languages, German and English. We believe that JESEME will be
most useful for diachronic linguists and scholars within the digital humanities. We see two major appli-
cations: First, it can be used to generate hypotheses by querying words of interest to get a first impression
of their semantic evolution. Second, scholars can first shape a hypothesis using traditional means and
then query JESEME for testing its plausibility based on diachronic statistical evidence.
