Abstract

Previous research shows that eye-tracking data
contains information about the lexical and syn-
tactic properties of text, which can be used to
improve natural language processing models.
In this work, we leverage eye movement fea-
tures from three corpora with recorded gaze
information to augment a state-of-the-art neu-
ral model for named entity recognition (NER)
with gaze embeddings. These corpora were
manually annotated with named entity labels.
Moreover, we show how gaze features, gen-
eralized on word type level, eliminate the need
for recorded eye-tracking data at test time. The
gaze-augmented models for NER using token-
level and type-level features outperform the
baselines. We present the benefits of eye-
tracking features by evaluating the NER mod-
els on both individual datasets as well as in
cross-domain settings.

1 Introduction

The field of natural language processing includes
studies of tasks of different granularity and depths
of semantics: from lower level tasks such as
tokenization and part-of-speech tagging up to
higher level tasks of information extraction such
as named entity recognition, relation extraction,
and semantic role labeling (Collobert et al., 2011).
As NLP systems become increasingly prevalent
in society, how to take advantage of information
passively collected from human readers, e.g. eye
movement signals, is becoming more interesting
to researchers. Previous research in this area has
shown promising results: Eye-tracking data has
been used to improve tasks such as part-of-speech
tagging (Barrett et al., 2016), sentiment analysis
(Mishra et al., 2017), prediction of multiword ex-
pressions (Rohanian et al., 2017), and word em-
bedding evaluation (Søgaard, 2016).

However, most of these studies focus on either
relatively lower-level tasks (e.g. part-of-speech
tagging and multiword expressions) or relatively

global properties in the text (e.g. sentiment analy-
sis). In this paper, we test a hypothesis on a differ-
ent level: Can eye movement signals also help im-
prove higher-level semantic tasks such as extract-
ing information from text?

The answer to this question is not obvious. On
one hand, the quality improvement attributed to
eye movement signals on lower-level tasks implies
that such signals do contain linguistic information.
On the other hand, it is not clear whether these sig-
nals can also provide significant improvement for
tasks dealing with higher-level semantics. More-
over, even if eye movement patterns contain sig-
nals related to higher-level tasks, as implied by
a recent psycholinguistic study (Tokunaga et al.,
2017), noisy as these signals are, it is not straight-
forward whether they would help, if not hurt, the
quality of the models.

In this paper, we provide the first study of the
impact of gaze features to automatic named entity
recognition from text. We test the hypothesis that
eye-tracking data is beneficial for entity recogni-
tion in a state-of-the-art neural named entity tag-
ger augmented with embedding layers of gaze fea-
tures. Our contributions in the current work can be
summarized as follows:

1. First, we manually annotate three eye-
tracking corpora with named entity labels to
train a neural NER system with gaze features.
This collection of corpora facilitates future
research in related topics. The annotations
are publicly available.

2. Beyond that, we present a neural architecture
for NER, which in addition to textual infor-
mation, incorporates embedding layers to en-
code eye movement information.

3. Finally, we show how gaze features gener-
alized to word types eliminate the need for
recorded eye-tracking data at test time. This

makes the use of eye-tracking data in NLP
applications more feasible since recorded
eye-tracking data for each token in context
is not required anymore at prediction time.
Moreover, type-aggregated features appear to
be particularly useful for cross-domain sys-
tems.

Our hypotheses are evaluated not only on the
available eye-tracking corpora, but also on an ex-
ternal benchmark dataset, for which gaze informa-
tion does not exist.

2 Related Work

The benefits of eye movement data for machine
learning have been assessed in various domains,
including NLP and computer vision. Eye-trackers
provide millisecond-accurate records on where
humans look when they are reading, and they are
becoming cheaper and more easily available by
the day (San Agustin et al., 2009; Sewell and Ko-
mogortsev, 2010). Although eye-tracking data is
still being recorded in controlled experiment en-
vironments, this will likely change in the near fu-
ture. Recent approaches have shown substantial
improvements in recording gaze data while read-
ing by using cameras of mobile devices (Gómez-
Poveda and Gaudioso, 2016; Papoutsaki et al.,
2016). Hence, eye-tracking data will probably be
more accessible and available in much larger vol-
umes in due time, which will facilitate the creation
of sizable datasets enormously.

Tokunaga et al. (2017) recently analyzed eye-
tracking signals during the annotation of named
entities to find effective features for NER. Their
work proves that humans take into account a
broad context to identify named entities, includ-
ing predicate-argument structure. This further
strengthens our intuition to use eye movement in-
formation to improve existing NER systems. And
going even a step further, it opens the possibil-
ity for real-time entity annotation based on the
reader’s eye movements.

The benefit of eye movement data is backed up
by extensive psycholinguistic studies. For exam-
ple, when humans read a text they do not focus on
every single word. The number of fixations and
the fixation duration on a word depends on a num-
ber of linguistic factors (Clifton et al., 2007; Dem-
berg and Keller, 2008). First, readers are more
likely to fixate on open-class words that are not

predictable from context (Rayner, 1998). Read-
ing patterns are a reliable indicator of syntacti-
cal categories (Barrett and Søgaard, 2015a). Sec-
ond, word frequency and word familiarity influ-
ence how long readers look at a word. The fre-
quency effect was first noted by Rayner (1977)
and has been reported in various studies since, e.g.
Just and Carpenter (1980) and Cop et al. (2017).
Moreover, although two words may have the same
frequency value, they may differ in familiarity (es-
pecially for infrequent words). Effects of word fa-
miliarity on fixation time have also been demon-
strated in a number of recent studies (Juhasz and
Rayner, 2003; Williams and Morris, 2004). Addi-
tionally, the positive effect of fixation information
in various NLP tasks has recently been shown by
Barrett et al. (2018), where an attention mecha-
nism is trained on fixation duration.

State-of-the-art NER Non-linear neural net-
works with distributed word representations as in-
put have become increasingly successful for any
sequence labeling task in NLP (Huang et al.,
2015; Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Ma and Hovy,
2016). The same applies to named entity recog-
nition: State-of-the-art systems are combinations
of neural networks such as LSTMs or CNNs and
conditional random fields (CRFs) (Strauss et al.,
2016). Lample et al. (2016) developed such a
neural architecture for NER, which we employ in
this work and enhance with eye movement fea-
tures. Their model successfully combines word-
level and character-level embeddings, which we
augment with embedding layers for eye-tracking
features.

3 Eye-tracking corpora

For our experiments, we resort to three eye-
tracking data resources: the Dundee corpus
(Kennedy et al., 2003), the GECO corpus (Cop
et al., 2017) and the ZuCo corpus (Hollenstein
et al., 2018). For the purpose of information ex-
traction, it is important that the readers process
longer fragments of text, i.e. complete sentences
instead of single words, which is the case in all
three datasets.

Table 1 shows an overview of the domain and
size of these datasets. In total, they comprise
142,441 tokens with gaze information. Table 1
also shows the differences in mean fixation times
between the datasets (i.e. fixation duration (the av-
erage duration of a single fixation on a word in

ration of all fixations on a word)).

Dundee Corpus The gaze data of the Dundee
corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003) was recorded with
a Dr. Bouis Oculometer Eyetracker. The English
section of this corpus comprises 58,598 tokens in
2,367 sentences. It contains eye movement infor-
mation of ten native English speakers as they read
the same 20 newspaper articles from The Indepen-
dent. The text was presented to the readers on a
screen five lines at a time. This data has been
widely used in psycholinguistic research to ana-
lyze the reading behavior of subjects while read-
ing sentences in context under relatively naturalis-
tic conditions.

GECO Corpus The Ghent Eye-Tracking Cor-
pus (Cop et al., 2017) is a more recent dataset,
which was created for the analysis of eye move-
ments of monolingual and bilingual subjects dur-
ing reading. The data was recorded with an Eye-
Link 1000 system. The text was presented one
paragraph at a time. The subjects read the entire
novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha
Christie (1920) containing 68,606 tokens in 5,424
sentences. We use only the monolingual data
recorded from the 14 native English speakers for
this work to maintain consistency across corpora.

ZuCo Corpus The Zurich Cognitive Language
Processing Corpus (Hollenstein et al., 2018) is
a combined eye-tracking and EEG dataset. The
gaze data was also recorded with an EyeLink 1000
system. The full corpus contains 1,100 English
sentences read by 12 adult native speakers. The
sentences were presented at the same position on
the screen one at a time. For the present work,
we only use the eye movement data of the first
two reading tasks of this corpus (700 sentences,
15,237 tokens), since these tasks encouraged
natural reading. The reading material included
sentences from movie reviews from the Stanford
Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013) and the
Wikipedia dataset by Culotta et al. (2006).

For the purposes of this work, all datasets
were manually annotated with named entity
labels for three categories: PERSON, OR-
GANIZATION and LOCATION. The annota-
tions are available at https://github.com/
DS3Lab/ner-at-first-sight.

The datasets were annotated by two NLP ex-
perts. The IOB tagging scheme was used for
the labeling. We followed the ACE Annotation
Guidelines (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2005).
All conflicts in labelling were resolved by ad-
judication between both annotators. An inter-

annotator reliability analysis on 10,000 tokens
(511 sentences) sampled from all three datasets
yielded an agreement of 83.5% on the entity labels
(κ = 0.68).

Table 2 shows the number of annotated entities
in each dataset. The distribution of entities be-
tween the corpora is highly unbalanced: Dundee
and ZuCo, the datasets containing more hetero-
geneous texts and thus, have a higher ratio of
unique entity occurrences, versus GECO, a homo-
geneous corpus consisting of a single novel, where
the named entities are very repetitive.

4 Eye-tracking features

The gaze data of all three corpora was recorded
for multiple readers by conducting experiments in
a controlled environment using specialized equip-
ment. It is important to consider that, while we
extract the same features for all corpora, there are
certainly practical aspects that differ across the
datasets. The following factors are expected to in-
fluence reading: experiment procedures; text pre-
sentation; recording hardware, software and qual-
ity; sampling rates; initial calibration and filtering,
as well as human factors such as head movements
and lack of attention. Therefore, separate normal-
ization for each dataset should better preserve the

signal within each corpus and for the same reason
the type-aggregation was computed on the normal-
ized feature values. This is especially relevant for
the type-aggregated features and the cross-corpus
experiments described below.

In order to add gaze information to the neu-
ral network, we have selected as many features
as available from those present in all three cor-
pora. Previous research shows benefits in com-
bining multiple eye-tracking features of different
stages of the human reading process (Barrett et al.,
2016; Tokunaga et al., 2017).

The features extracted follow closely on Bar-
rett et al. (2016). As described above, psycho-
linguistic research has shown how fixation dura-
tion and probability differ between word classes
and syntactic comprehension processes. Thus, the
features focus on representing these nuances as
broadly as possible, covering the complete reading
time of a word at different stages. Table 3 shows
the eye movement features incorporated into the
experiments. We split the 17 features into 4 dis-
tinct groups (analogous to Barrett et al. (2016)),
which define the different stages of the reading
process:

1. BASIC eye-tracking features capture charac-
teristics on word-level, e.g. the number of all



5

fixations on a word or the probability that a
word will be fixated (namely, the number of
subjects who fixated the word divided by the
total number of subjects).

2. EARLY gaze measures capture lexical access
and early syntactic processing and are based
on the first time a word is fixated.

3. LATE measures reflect the late syntactic pro-
cessing and general disambiguation. These
features are significant for words which were
fixated more than once.

4. CONTEXT features capture the gaze mea-
sures of the surrounding tokens. These
features consider the fixation probability
and duration up to two tokens to the left
and right of the current token. Additionally,
regressions starting at the current word are
also considered to be meaningful for the
syntactic processing of full sentences.

The eye movement measurements were aver-
aged over all native-speaking readers of each
dataset to obtain more robust estimates. The small
size of eye-tracking datasets often limits the po-
tential for training data-intensive algorithms and
causes overfitting in benchmark evaluation (Xu
et al., 2015). It also leads to sparse samples of gaze
measurements. Hence, given the limited num-
ber of observations available, we normalize the
data by splitting the feature values into quantiles
to avoid sparsity issues. The best results were
achieved with 24 bins. This normalization is con-
ducted separately for each corpus.

Moreover, special care had to be taken regard-
ing tokenization, since the recorded eye-tracking
data considers only whitespace separation. For ex-
ample, the string John’s would constitute a sin-
gle token for eye-tracking feature extraction, but
would be split into John and ’s for NER, with the
former token holding the label PERSON and the
latter no label at all. Our strategy to address this
issue was to assign the same values of the gaze
features of the originating token to split tokens.

4.1 Type aggregation
Barrett and Søgaard (2015b) showed that type-
level aggregation of gaze features results in larger
improvements for part-of-speech tagging. Follow-
ing their line of work, we also conducted exper-

iments with type aggregation for NER. This im-
plies that the eye-tracking feature values were av-
eraged for each word type over all occurrences in
the training data. For instance, the sum of the fea-
tures of all n occurrences of the token “island” are
averaged over the number of occurrences n. As
a result, for each corpus as well as for the ag-
gregated corpora, a lexicon of lower-cased word
types with their averaged eye-tracking feature val-
ues was compiled. Thus, as input for the network,
either the type-level aggregates for each individ-
ual corpus can be used or the values from the com-
bined lexicon, which increases the number of word
types with known gaze feature values.

The goal of type aggregation is twofold. First,
it eliminates the requirement of eye-tracking fea-
tures when applying the models at test time, since
the larger the lexicon, the more tokens in the
unseen data receive type-aggregated eye-tracking
feature values. For those tokens not in the lexi-
con, we assign a placeholder for unknown feature
values. Second, type-aggregated features can be
used on any dataset and show that improvements
can be achieved with aggregated gaze data without
requiring large quantities of recorded data.

5 Model

The experiments in this work were executed us-
ing an enhanced version of the system presented
by Lample et al. (2016). This hybrid approach
is based on bidirectional LSTMs and conditional
random fields and relies mainly on two sources of
information: character-level and word-level repre-
sentations.

For the experiments, the originally proposed
values for all parameters were maintained. Specif-
ically, the bidirectional LSTMs for character-
based embeddings are trained on the corpus at
hand with dimensions set to 25. The lookup ta-
ble tor the word embeddings was initialized with
the pre-trained GloVe vectors of 100 dimensions
(Pennington et al., 2014). The model uses a sin-
gle layer for the forward and backward LSTMs.
All models were trained with a dropout rate at 0.5.
Moreover, all digits were replaced with zeros.

The original model1 was modified to include the
gaze features as additional embedding layers to
the network. The character-level representation,
i.e. the output of a bidirectional LSTM, is con-
catenated with the word-level representation from

a word lookup table. In the augmented model with
eye-tracking information, the embedding for each
discrete gaze feature is also concatenated to the
input. The dimension of the gaze feature embed-
dings is equal to the number of quantiles. This ar-
chitecture is shown in Figure 1. Word length and
word frequency are known to correlate and interact
with gaze features (Tomanek et al., 2010), which
is why we selected a base model that allows us to
combine the eye-tracking features with word- and
character-level information.

6 Results

Our main finding is that our models enhanced with
gaze features consistently outperform the base-
line. As our baseline, we trained and evaluated the
original models with the neural architecture and
parameters proposed by Lample et al. (2016) on
the GECO, Dundee, and ZuCo corpora and com-
pared it to the models that were enriched with eye-
tracking measures. The best improvements on F1-
score over the baseline models are significant un-
der one-sided t-tests (p<0.05).

All models were trained with 10-fold cross val-
idation (80% training set, 10% development set,
10% test set) and early stopping was performed
after 20 epochs of no improvement on the devel-
opment set to reduce training time.

First, the performance on the individual datasets
is tested, together with the performance of one
combined dataset consisting of all three corpora
(consisting of 142,441 tokens). In addition, we

evaluate the effects of the type-aggregated features
using individual type lexicons for each datasets,
and combining the three type lexicons of each cor-
pus. Finally, we experiment with cross-corpus sce-
narios to evaluate the potential of eye-tracking fea-
tures in NER for domain adaptation. Both settings
were also tested on an external corpus without
eye-tracking features, namely the CoNLL-2003
dataset (Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

6.1 Individual dataset evaluation
First, we analyzed how augmenting the named en-
tity recognition system with eye-tracking features
affects the results on the individual datasets. Ta-
ble 4 shows the improvements achieved by adding
all 17 gaze features to the neural architecture, and
training models on all three corpora, and on the
combined dataset containing all sentences from
the Dundee, GECO and ZuCo corpora. Notice-
ably, adding token-level gaze features improves
the results on all datasets individually and com-
bined, even on the GECO corpus, which yields a
high baseline due to the homogeneity of the con-
tained named entities (see Table 2).

Furthermore, Table 4 also presents the results
of the NER models making use of the type-
aggregated features instead of token-level gaze
features. There are two different experiments for
these type-level features: Using the features of the
word types occurring in the corpus only, or us-
ing the aggregated features of all word types in
the three corpora (as describe above). As can be
seen, the performance of the different gaze fea-

ture levels varies between datasets, but both the
original token-level features as well as the indi-
vidual and combined type-level features achieve
improvements over the baselines of all datasets.

To sum up, the largest improvement with eye-
tracking features is achieved when combining all
corpora into one larger dataset, where an addi-
tional 4% is gained in F1-score by using type-
aggregated features. Evidently, a larger mixed-
domain dataset benefits from the type aggrega-
tion, while the original token-level gaze features
achieve the best results on the individual datasets.
Moreover, the additional gain when training on all
datasets is due to the higher signal-to-noise ratio of
type-aggregated features from multiple datasets.

Evaluation on CoNLL-2003 Going on step fur-
ther, we evaluate the type-aggregated gaze fea-
tures on an external corpus with no eye move-
ment information available. The CoNLL-2003
corpus (Sang and De Meulder, 2003) has been

widely used as a benchmark dataset for NER in
different shared tasks. The English part of this
corpus consists of Reuters news stories and con-
tains 302,811 tokens in 22,137 sentences. We use
this dataset as an additional corpus without gaze
information. Only the type-aggregated features
(based on the combined eye-tracking corpora) are
added to each word. Merely 76% of the tokens
in the CoNLL-2003 corpus also appear in the eye-
tracking corpora described above and thus receive
type-aggregated feature values. The rest of the to-
kens without aggregated gaze information avail-
able receive a placeholder for the unknown feature
values.

Note that to avoid overfitting we do not train
on the official train/test split of the CoNLL-2003
dataset, but perform 10-fold cross validation. Ap-
plying the same experiment setting, we train the
augmented NER model with gaze features on the
CoNLL-2003 data and compare it to a baseline
model without any eye-tracking features. We
achieve a minor, but nonetheless significant im-
provement (shown in Table 5), which strongly
supports the generalizability effect of the type-
aggregated features on unseen data.

6.2 Cross-dataset evaluation
In a second evaluation scenario, we test the poten-
tial of eye-tracking features for NER across cor-
pora. The goal is to leverage eye-tracking features
for domain adaptation. To show the robustness of
our approach across domains, we train the models
with token-level and type-level features on 100%
of corpus A and a development set of 20% of cor-
pus B and test on the remaining 80% of the corpus
B, alternating only the development and the test
set for each fold.

Table 6 shows the results of this cross-corpus
evaluation. The impact of the eye-tracking fea-
tures varies between the different combinations of
datasets. However, the inclusion of eye-tracking
features improves the results for all combinations,
except for the models trained on the ZuCo corpus

is due to the combination of the small training data
size of the ZuCo corpus and the homogeneity of
the named entities in the GECO corpus.

Evaluation on CoNLL-2003 Analogous to the
individual dataset evaluation, we also test the po-
tential of eye-tracking features in a cross-dataset
scenario on an external benchmark dataset. Again,
we use the CoNLL-2003 corpus for this purpose.
We train a model on the Dundee, GECO and ZuCo
corpora using type-aggregated eye-tracking fea-
tures and test this model on the ConLL-2003 data.
Table 7 shows that compared to a baseline without
gaze features, the results improve by 3% F1-score.
These results underpin our hypothesis of the pos-
sibility of generalizing eye-tracking features on
word type level, such that no recorded gaze data
is required at test time.

7 Discussion

The models evaluated in the previous section show
that eye-tracking data contain valuable semantic
information that can be leveraged effectively by
NER systems. While the individual datasets are

gaze datasets combined.

still limited in size, the largest improvement is ob-
served in the models making use of all the avail-
able data.

At a closer look, the model leveraging gaze data
yield a considerably higher increase in recall when
comparing to the baselines. In addition, a class-
wise analysis shows that the entity type benefiting
the most from the gaze features over all models
is ORGANIZATION, which is the most difficult
class to predict. Figure 2 illustrates this with the
results per class of the models trained on all three
gaze corpora jointly.

In the individual dataset evaluation setting, the
combined type-level feature aggregation from all
datasets does not yield the best results, since each
sentence in these corpora already has accurate eye-
tracking features on toke-level. Thus, it is under-

standable that in this scenario the original gaze
features and the gaze features aggregated only
on the individual datasets result in better mod-
els. However, when evaluating the NER models in
a cross-corpus scenario, the type-aggregated fea-
tures lead to significant improvements.

Type aggregation evidently reduces the fine-
grained nuances contained in eye-tracking infor-
mation and eliminates the possibility of disam-
biguation between homographic tokens. Never-
theless, this type of disambiguation is not crucial
for named entities, which mainly consist of proper
nouns and the same entities tend to appear in the
same context. Especially noteworthy is the gain
in the models tested on the CoNLL-2003 bench-
mark corpus, which shows that aggregated eye-
tracking features from other datasets can be ap-
plied to any unseen sentence and show improve-
ments, even though more than 20% of the tokens
have unknown gaze feature values. While the high
number of unknown values is certainly a limitation
of our approach, it shows at once the possibility of
not requiring original gaze features at prediction
time. Thus, the trained NER models can be ap-
plied robustly on unseen data.

8 Conclusion

We presented the first study of augmenting a NER
system with eye-tracking information. Our results
highlight the benefits of leveraging cognitive cues
such as eye movements to improve entity recogni-
tion models. The manually annotated named en-
tity labels for the three eye-tracking corpora are
freely available. We augmented a neural NER ar-
chitecture with gaze features. Experiments were
performed using a wide range of features relevant
to the human reading process and the results show
significant improvements over the baseline for all
corpora individually.

In addition, the type-aggregated gaze features
are effective in cross-domain settings, even on an
external benchmark corpus. The results of these
type-aggregated features are a step towards lever-
aging eye-tracking data for information extrac-
tion at training time, without requiring real-time
recorded eye-tracking data at prediction time.
