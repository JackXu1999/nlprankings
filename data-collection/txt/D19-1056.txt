Abstract

We propose a Cross-lingual Encoder-Decoder
model that simultaneously translates and gen-
erates sentences with Semantic Role Labeling
annotations in a resource-poor target language.
Unlike annotation projection techniques, our
model does not need parallel data during in-
ference time. Our approach can be applied
in monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual
settings and is able to produce dependency-
based and span-based SRL annotations. We
benchmark the labeling performance of our
model in different monolingual and multilin-
gual settings using well-known SRL datasets.
We then train our model in a cross-lingual set-
ting to generate new SRL labeled data. Finally,
we measure the effectiveness of our method by
using the generated data to augment the train-
ing basis for resource-poor languages and per-
form manual evaluation to show that it pro-
duces high-quality sentences and assigns accu-
rate semantic role annotations. Our proposed
architecture offers a flexible method for lever-
aging SRL data in multiple languages.

1 Introduction

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) extracts semantic
predicate-argument structure from sentences. This
has proven to be useful in Neural Machine Trans-
lation (NMT) (Marcheggiani et al., 2018), Multi-
document-summarization (Khan et al., 2015),
AMR parsing (Wang et al., 2015) and Read-
ing Comprehension (Mihaylov and Frank, 2019).
SRL consists of three steps: i) predicate detection,
ii) argument identification and iii) role classifica-
tion. In this work we focus on PropBank SRL
(Palmer et al., 2005), which has proven its validity
across languages (van der Plas et al., 2010). While
former SRL systems rely on syntactic features
(Punyakanok et al., 2008; Täckström et al., 2015),
recent neural approaches learn to model both ar-
gument detection and role classification given a

predicate (Marcheggiani et al., 2017; He et al.,
2017), and even jointly predict predicates inside
sentences (He et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2018). While
these approaches alleviate the need for pipeline
models, they require sufficient amounts of training
data to perform adequately. To date, such models
have been tested primarily for English, which of-
fers a considerable amount of high-quality train-
ing data compared to other languages. The lack
of sufficiently large SRL datasets makes it hard to
straightforwardly apply the same architectures to
other languages and calls for methods to augment
the training data in lower-resource languages.

There is significant prior work on SRL data aug-
mentation (Hartmann et al., 2017), annotation pro-
jection for monolingual (Fürstenau and Lapata,
2012; Hartmann et al., 2016), and cross-lingual
SRL (Padó and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al.,
2011; Akbik et al., 2015, 2016). A drawback of
cross-lingual projection is that even at prediction
time it requires parallel sentences, a semantic role
labeler on the source side, as well as syntactic
information for both language sides. Thus, it is
desirable to design an architecture that can make
use of existing annotations in more than one lan-

guage and that learns to translate input sentences
to another language while transferring semantic
role annotations from the source to the target.

Techniques for low-resource Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) show the positive impact
on target predictions by adding more than one
language during training, such as Multi-source
NMT (Zoph and Knight, 2016) and Multilingual
NMT (Johnson et al., 2017; Firat et al., 2016a),
whereas Mulcaire et al. (2018) show the advan-
tages of training a single polyglot SRL system that
improves over monolingual baselines in lower-
resource settings. In this work, we propose a gen-
eral Encoder-Decoder (Enc-Dec) architecture for
SRL (see Figure 1). We extend our previous Enc-
Dec approach for SRL (Daza and Frank, 2018) to a
cross-lingual model that translates sentences from
a source language to a (lower-resource) target lan-
guage, and during decoding jointly labels it with
SRL annotations.1

Our contributions are as follows:

• We propose the first cross-lingual multilin-
gual Enc-Dec model for PropBank SRL.
• We show that our cross-lingual model can

generate new labeled sentences in a target
language without the need of explicit syntac-
tic or semantic annotations at inference time.
• Cross-lingual evaluation against a labeled

gold standard achieves good performance,
comparable to monolingual SRL results.
• Augmenting the training set of a lower-

resource language with sentences generated
by the cross-lingual model achieves im-
proved F1 scores on the benchmark dataset.
• Our universal Enc-Dec model lends itself to

monolingual, multilingual and crosslingual
SRL and yields competitive performance.

2 An Extensible Model for SRL

2.1 One Model to Treat Them All
We define the SRL task as a sequence transduc-
tion problem: given an input sequence of tokens
X = x1, ..., xi, the system is tasked to generate
a sequence Y = y1, ..., yj consisting of words in-
terleaved with SRL annotations. Defining the task
in this fashion allows X and Y to be of different
lengths and therefore target sequences may also

architecture to multilingual and cross-lingual SRL.

contain word tokens of different languages if de-
sired. This means that we could train an Enc-Dec
model that learns not only to label a sentence, but
to jointly translate it while applying SRL annota-
tions directly to the target language. Moreover,
following conceptually the multilingual Enc-Dec
model proposed by Johnson et al. (2017), we can
train a single model that allows for joint training
with multiple language pairs while sharing param-
eters among them. We apply a similar joint multi-
lingual learning method to produce structured out-
put sequences in the form of translations enriched
with SRL annotations on the (lower-resource) tar-
get language (cf. Figure 3). We will apply this
universal structure-inducing Enc-Dec model to the
Semantic Role Labeling task, and show that it can
be deployed in three different settings:

i) monolingual: encode a sentence in a given
language and learn to decode a labeled sequence
by reproducing the source words and inserting the
appropriate structure-indicating labels in the out-
put (cf. Figure 2). A copying mechanism (Gu
et al., 2016) allows this model to reproduce the in-
put sentence as faithfully as possible.

ii) one-to-one multilingual: train a single, joint
model to generate n different structure-enriched
target languages given inputs in the same lan-
guage. For example: Labeled English (EN-SRL)
given an EN sentence or Labeled German (DE-
SRL) given a DE sentence. This multilingual
model still relies on copying to relate each labeled
output sentence to its corresponding input coun-
terpart. However, unlike (i), it has the advantage
of sharing parameters among languages.

iii) cross-lingual: generate outputs in n differ-
ent target languages given inputs in m different
source languages, for example: Labeled German
(DE-SRL) and Labeled French (FR-SRL) given an
EN sentence (see Figure 3). In this setting, we
do not restrict the model to copy words from the

source sentence but train it to translate them.
In Section 2.2 we describe how the basic Enc-

Dec model for SRL is constructed and in Section
2.3 we describe the additional components that al-
low us to generalize this architecture to the one-to-
one multilingual and cross-lingual scenarios.

2.2 Encoder-Decoder Architecture

We reimplement and extend the Enc-Dec model
with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and copying
(Gu et al., 2016) mechanisms for SRL proposed by
Daza and Frank (2018). This model encodes the
source sentence and decodes the input sequence
of words (in the same language) interleaved with
SRL labels.

Data Representation. Similar to other prior
work (Liu et al., 2018) and our own (Daza and
Frank, 2018), we linearize the SRL structure in
order to process it as a sequence of symbols suit-
able for the Enc-Dec architecture. We restrict our-
selves to argument identification and labeling of
one predicate at a time. We feed the gold pred-
icate in training and inference, and process each
sentence as many times as it has predicates. An
opening bracket (# indicates the start of a labeled-
argument region; a closing labeled bracket, e.g.
A0), indicates the ending and the tag of the labeled
region (see Figure 2).

Vocabulary. We define a shared vocabulary
consisting of all source and target words V =
{v1, ..., vN} ∪ {UNK} and the SRL labels L =
{l1, ..., lM}. In addition, we employ a per-instance
extension set X = {x1..., xTx} containing all
words from the source sequence. Our final vocab-
ulary is V ∪ L ∪ X .

Encoder. In our prior work (Daza and Frank,
2018) we used a 2-layer BiLSTM as encoder. In
this paper, we adopt the Deep BiLSTM Encoder
from He et al. (2017) which has been shown to
work well for SRL models. Again following He
et al. (2017), we define the encoder input vector
xi as the concatenation of a word embedding wi
and a binary predicate-feature embedding pi indi-
cating at each time-step whether the current word
is a predicate or not 2. The encoder outputs a se-
ries of hidden states h1, ..., hTx representing each
token. We refer to this series of states as H.

Attention. To improve the access to the source
sentence representation, we include the attention

pared to the reported results in Daza and Frank (2018).

mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015),
which computes a context vector at each time step
t based on H and the current decoder state.

Decoder. We use a single-layer Decoder with
LSTM cells (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)
and a copying mechanism. It emits an output to-
ken yt from a learned score ψg over the vocabulary
at each time step t given its state st, the previous
output token yt−1, and the attention context vector
ct. In addition, a copying score ψc is calculated.
The decoder learns from these scores when to gen-
erate a new token and when to copy from the en-
coded hidden states H. Formally we compute the
scores as:

ψg(yt = vi) =Wo[st; ct], vi � V ∪ L
ψc(yt = xj) = σ(h

T
j Wc)st, xj � X

(1)

where Wo�RN×2ds and Wc�Rdh×ds are learn-
able parameters and st, ct are the current de-
coder state and context vector, respectively. These
scores are used to compute two distributions: one
for the likelihood of copying (c) yt and another for
the likelihood of generating (g) yt. Formally:

p(yt|st, yt−1, ct,H) = p(yt,g|st, yt−1, ct)+
p(yt, c|st, yt−1,H) (2)

The two distributions are then normalized by
a final softmax layer from which we compute a
joint likelihood of yt and choose the token with
the highest score within this joint likelihood.

2.3 Multilingual Extensions
We generalize the monolingual Enc-Dec model for
SRL to a multilingual SRL system by adding two
main components:

Translation Token. Like Johnson et al. (2017),
we prefix the source sequence with a special token
that indicates the expected language of the target
sequence. If the source is in EN and the target is a
German sentence with SRL labels, the source sen-
tence will be preceded by the token <2DE-SRL>.

Language Indicator Embeddings. We want
the model to profit from the common role label
inventory used across languages, yet at the same
time there are subtle differences in role labeling
and how roles are linguistically marked in the dif-
ferent languages3. Hence, we define N different
language indicators (e.g., FR, DE) and represent

3e.g. the role A2 (Beneficiary) can be PP in EN and FR,
but dative NP in DE (DativeNP)

each of them with a randomly initialized language
indicator vector that we tune during training. The
model can use these language indicator embed-
ding vectors to leverage language-specific proper-
ties when generating SRL annotations. Also, by
using these embeddings in the decoder, we can
help it to stay consistent regarding the language
it generates4.

Thus, in all multilingual settings, at each time
step t we feed the Encoder with a concatenation
of the previous encoder state ht−1, the word em-
bedding wt of the current token, the embedded
predicate indicator pt and the language indicator
embedding lt. The Encoder state update is defined
as:

ht = LSTM([ht−1;wt; pt; lt]) (3)

Likewise, on the Decoder side we concatenate
the representations for both word tokens and la-
bel tokens with the language indicator vector to
produce tokens in a specific language. For SRL-
labeled output sentences the indicator token for the
language embedding is DE-SRL, FR-SRL, ... de-
pending on the target language. Formally, at each
time step the decoder updates its state by taking
into account the previous decoder state st−1, the
previous generated token5 yt−1, the language in-

4Johnson et al. (2017) only use a translation token, but our
training data is significantly smaller than theirs.

5During training we use teacher forcing, feeding the gold
target token instead of the previously generated token

dicator embedding lt−1 and the attention context
vector ct:

st = LSTM([st−1; yt−1; lt−1; ct]) (4)

3 Data

3.1 SRL Monolingual Datasets
Two labeling schemes have been established
for PropBank SRL: span-based and dependency-
based. In the former, arguments are characterized
as word-spans. This scheme was introduced in the
CoNLL-05 Shared-task (Carreras and Màrquez,
2005) and is available only for English. In the
dependency-based SRL format, only the syntactic
heads of arguments are labeled. This format was
defined in the CoNLL-09 Shared task (Hajič et al.,
2009), which includes SRL labeled data for seven
languages.6

We will use span-based and dependency-based
data for English to benchmark the monolingual
system. For the multilingual experiments, we
use the dependency-based annotations, given that
there is labeled data available in different lan-
guages on this format. Specifically, we use the
English and German portions of CoNLL-09 and
the automatically annotated French SRL corpus
of van der Plas et al. (2011) for training and the
human-labeled sentences from van der Plas et al.
(2010) for testing. Both corpora contain a similar

6Note that CoNLL-09 is not a parallel corpus. All data
was annotated independently and later ported to CoNLL.

on the size of the datasets see Table 1.

3.2 Datasets for Cross-lingual SRL

We use the dependency-based labeled German
and French SRL corpus from Akbik et al. (2015)
which was produced via annotation projection.
These sentences are already pre-filtered to ensure
that the predicate sense of the source predicate is
preserved in the target sentence. Since the role la-
bels are projected from automatically PropBank-
parsed English sentences, all languages share the
same label set. The underlying corpus for this
dataset is composed of Machine Translation (MT)
parallel corpora: Europarl (Koehn, 2005) for EN-
DE (about 63K sents), and UN (Ziemski et al.,
2016) for EN-FR (about 40K sents).

Since we only had access to the labeled sen-
tences (target-side), we constructed our parallel
training pairs EN to FR-SRL and EN to DE-SRL by
finding the original source English counterparts.
We use Flair (Akbik et al., 2018) to predict Prop-
Bank frames on the English source sentences and
find the alignment to the labeled predicate on the
target side using fast-align (Dyer et al., 2013).

In addition to the parallel SRL-labeled data, we
choose a subset of 100K parallel (non-labeled)
sentences for each language pair from the men-
tioned MT datasets (Europarl and UN corpora) to

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 General Settings

We use the AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018) Enc-
Dec model as a basis for our implementation. Our
model is trained to minimize the negative log-
likelihood of the next token. Hyperparameters and
model sizes are provided in Supplement A.1. We
use pre-trained word embeddings (fine-tuned dur-
ing training) for the 3 languages: GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) for EN and the pre-trained
vectors from Grave et al. (2018) for FR and DE.
We also train versions with contextual word repre-
sentations: pre-trained English 1024-dimensional
ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and multilingual 768-
dimensional BERT-small (Devlin et al., 2019) rep-
resentations.

4.2 Monolingual Experiments and Results

We train three separate monolingual versions for
EN, DE and FR. We first benchmark our system
against a wide variety of English models (span-
and dependency-based) that perform the role clas-
sification task with gold predicates to show that
our labeling performance is competitive with the
existent SOTA neural models for English. This is
shown in Table 3. The performance of DE and
FR is shown in Table 4 where we compare all
monolingual systems for the three languages (top
half), against the one-to-one multilingual versions
(bottom half). Results for EN show that the Enc-
Dec architecture is competitive with the GloVe-
based models (although still 4 F1 points below
SOTA in most cases), however it benefits more
from ELMo, achieving SOTA results for span-
based and dependency-based SRL.

4.3 Multilingual Experiments and Results

We train a single multilingual model with the con-
catenation of the training data for the three lan-
guages EN, DE and FR that we previously used on
the monolingual experiments. We use a common
vocabulary for the three languages and keep all to-
kens that occur more than 5 times in the combined
dataset. We train the model with batches contain-
ing instances randomly chosen from the individual
languages (this means that each batch might con-
tain examples from different language pairs).

respectively.

Multilingual training yields improvement on the
three languages studied in this paper when com-
pared to our monolingual baselines, particularly
for German, which shows more than 6 points
(F1) of improvement. In addition, we compare
with the polyglot SRL system of Mulcaire et al.
(2018) (which also leverages data from multiple
languages during training), obtaining better re-
sults for English using GloVe. We then show that
adding contextual representations to our model re-
sults in bigger improvements across the board.

4.4 Cross-Lingual Experiments and Results

Training. After validating the robustness of our
architecture when handling different languages at
the same time, we now train a cross-lingual SRL
version. This setting differs from the previous two

because the model needs to learn two tasks: be-
sides generating appropriate SRL labels, it needs
to translate from source into a target language. To
do so, we train a single model using the concate-
nation of the parallel datasets listed in Table 2 and
described in Section 3.2. We further include Ma-
chine Translation (MT) data to reinforce the trans-
lation knowledge of the model, so that it can gen-
erate fluent (labeled) target sentences. As in the
multilingual experiments, we train the model with
alternating batches of instances randomly chosen
from the individual language pairs. Note that the
amount of MT data that we can add is restricted:
the labeled multilingual data is relatively small
and labeling performance suffers when the MT
data gets too dominant.

Evaluating Cross-lingual SRL. As in classical
MT, evaluation is difficult, since the system out-
puts will approximate a target reference but will
never be guaranteed to match it. Hence in this
setting we do not have a proper gold standard to
evaluate the labeled outputs, since we are generat-
ing labeled target sentences from scratch. Similar
to MT research, we apply BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002) to measure the closeness of the out-
puts against our Dev Set.

The upper part of Table 5 compares the scores
of two versions of the Enc-Dec model trained on
the cross-lingual data from Table 2 systems, one
using GloVe embeddings and the second using
BERT, respectively. To better distinguish trans-
lation vs. labeling quality, we compute BLEU
scores for the system outputs against labeled ref-
erence sentences in three different ways: on words
only, labels only, and on full labeled sequences
(both word and label outputs). We see that the pre-
diction of words is similar in the two languages,
but labeling is more difficult for DE than for FR
for both systems. Also we observe that adding
multilingual BERT is very helpful to obtain even
more fluent and correct labeled outputs (according
to BLEU) resulting in ca. +9 points in German
and +5 in French on the full sequences. This is
very important given that we have a small training
set compared to classic NMT scenarios.

The bottom part of Table 5 shows the scores
when restricting the evaluation to sentences with
score ≥ 10. We observed that this threshold8 is
a good trade-off in both the amount of kept sen-
tences (above the threshold) and average BLEU

8We tried with thresholds of 5, 10, 20 and 30.

score increase (presumably sentence quality). By
keeping only the filtered subset of sentences we
get an improvement on average of approx. 10
BLEU points on the full sequences (F-Seq), and
almost double the score for labels only. This holds
for GloVe and BERT versions on both languages.

Output Filtering and Data Generation. We
use our cross-lingual model as a labeled data gen-
erator by applying it on EN sentences from Eu-
roparl (100K) and UN corpora (100K)9 and let
the model predict DE-SRL and FR-SRL as target
languages. This results in unseen German and
French labeled sentences. Since we cannot guar-
antee that the generated sentences preserve the
source predicate meaning, we filter all outputs by
keeping only those that come close to the origi-
nal sentence meaning. We approximate this by
back-translating the generated outputs (stripping
the labels and keeping only the words) using the
pre-trained DE-EN model from OpenNMT (Klein
et al., 2017).

We compare the back-translations to the sen-
tences that we originally presented to the sys-
tem and, using the previously described filtering
heuristic, we keep only those whose BLEU score
is equal or greater than 10. The logic behind this
is that if the back-translation is close enough to
the source, the generated sentence preserves a fair
amount of the original sentence meaning10. With
this strategy, after applying the BLEU filter, we
end up with a parallel dataset of 44K generated
sentences for (EN, DE-SRL) and 32K for (EN, FR-
SRL). In the next section we show more detailed
evaluation measures of the system outputs, focus-
ing on the filtered dataset that we just described.

9Note that these are taken from a different subset than the
parallel sentences used during training.

10BLEU score is used as a naive approach to avoid exces-
sively noisy data but we could also develop, for example, a se-
mantic similarity metric to also keep sentences that are close
enough to the original predicate sense meaning.

4.5 Cross-Lingual Detailed Evaluation

We are aware that BLEU score gives only a rough
estimate of the actual quality of the outputs, there-
fore we propose to measure the performance of
our system in two more detailed evaluation set-
tings: (i) a small-scale human evaluation where
we evaluate the assigned SRL labels against 226
sentences that were manually judged and anno-
tated to give an estimation of the quality of the
generated data, (ii) an extrinsic evaluation using
labeled sentences generated by our system to aug-
ment the training set for a resource-poor language.
We conduct the extrinsic evaluation on German
and French and the manual evaluation only on the
German data, which proved to be the more chal-
lenging language compared to French.

4.5.1 Human Evaluation
To provide an in-depth quality assessment of the
generated sentences, we create a small-scale gold
standard consisting of 226 sentences. To select a
representative sample from our newly generated
labeled sentences,11 we analyze the distribution of
labels in the data and apply stratified sampling to
cover as many predicates as possible and as many
role label variants as possible. We judge these sen-
tences on the quality of the generated language
and annotate them with PropBank roles.

SRL Gold Standard. As we are lacking trained
PropBank annotators, we mimic the question-
based role annotation method of He et al. (2015),
who constructed QA pairs in order to label the
predicate-argument structure of verbs. The anno-
tation involves several subtasks: The first is to gen-
erate questions targeting a specific verb in a sen-
tence and to mark as answers a subset of words
from the same sentence. The next subtask is to
choose the head word of each selected subset and
to assign a PropBank label to this head accord-
ing to a table that correlates WH-phrases with the
most likely label.12

We ask two linguistically trained annotators to
perform the whole task independently and com-
pute Krippendorff’s Alpha (Krippendorff, 1980)
on the role labels, which results in an inter-
annotator agreement score of 82.83. We resolved
conflicting annotations through discussion among

11i.e., the generated sentences for which we measured a
BLEU score ≥ 10 against the source using back-translation.

12We provide this correlation table and the full annotation
guidelines in appendix A.2 in the Supplement.

the annotators. The resulting gold standard con-
tains 737 annotated roles. Notably, the most
prominent roles (as in the CoNLL datasets) are A0
and A1 which are normally related to the agent and
the patient in sentences, but the annotated data also
includes modifier roles such as temporal, modal,
discourse markers, among others13.

Translation Quality. We ask two different an-
notators to score each output sentence (they see
only the words, not the labels) on a scale of 1-5
for Quality (1: ‘is completely ungrammatical’; 5:
‘is perfectly grammatical’) and for Naturalness (1:
‘The sentence is not what a native speaker would
write’; 5: ‘The sentence could have been written
by a native speaker’). We obtain a high average
score of 4.4 for Quality and 4.2 for Naturalness.

SRL Performance on Gold Standard. We use
our human-annotated sentences to measure the au-
tomatic labeling performance of our cross-lingual
SRL model which we call XL-BERT). We obtain
73.21 F1 score (73.33 precision, 73.1 recall). We
also measure the performance of the ZAP label
projection system of Akbik and Vollgraf (2018) on
this data (we only consider arguments of the pred-
icates that were annotated). ZAP obtains a low F1
score of 56.03 (42.65 precision, 81.7 recall). Thus,
XL-BERT shows much better, and more precise
results compared to this baseline and achieves
overall very acceptable and stable labeling quality.
This shows that the joint translation-labeling task
is successful. ZAP, by contrast, shows more unsta-
ble results, which might be due to word alignment
noise. Although we train on such data, our model
can also loose some of this noise, given that the
same model is trained to produce more than one
labeled language, namely FR-SRL and DE-SRL.

4.5.2 Extrinsic Task: Data Augmentation
Finally, we augment the training sets of our two
resource-poor languages DE and FR, in portions
of 10K until we cover the complete generated data.
We compare the increase in F1 score when training
models with different amounts of additional data.
We also add a comparison of the improvement
achieved when adding the same amount of sen-
tences produced by the labeled projection method
of Akbik et al. (2015). We see in Table 6 that
adding our German data shows improvement in
F1 score, despite the fact that the CoNLL-09 la-

13The label distribution is given in the Supplement, A.3.

DE [Mono] (Original) 39K 61.9
DE [Mono] + LabelProj 83K 62.37
DE [Mono] + OurGen10K 49K 62.4

FR [Mono] + OurGen10K 83K 70.33
FR [Mono] + OurGen20K 93K 70.52
FR [Mono] + OurGenALL 105K 70.39

Table 6: We retrain the monolingual systems DE, FR
using the original training sets (BL: Original) shown
in Table 1 and inject our generated data in different
sizes. We also compare to the stronger baseline La-
belProj where we add data created by label projection
(Akbik et al., 2015).

bel scheme has arguments not seen in our train-
ing data (namely A5-A9). Presumably we see this
improvement because the frequency of the major
roles is more prominent. In the case of French, we
don’t see significant improvement, however also
here the addition of projected data shows a similar
trend.

5 Related Work

Encoder-Decoder Models. A wide range of
NMT models are based on the Encoder-Decoder
approach (Sutskever et al., 2014) with atten-
tion mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong
et al., 2015). More recent architectures (Zoph
and Knight, 2016; Firat et al., 2016a) show that
training with multiple languages performs better
than one-to-one NMT. Multilingual models have
also been trained to perform Zero-shot translation
(Johnson et al., 2017; Firat et al., 2016b). The
Enc-Dec approach has been tested in many tasks
that can be formulated as a sequence transduc-
tion problem: syntactic parsing (Vinyals et al.,
2015), AMR and Semantic Parsing (Konstas et al.,
2017; Dong and Lapata, 2016) and SRL (Daza and
Frank, 2018). The most similar approach to ours
is Zhang et al. (2017), who propose a cross-lingual
Enc-Dec that produces OpenIE-annotated English
given a Chinese sentence. However, their setup
is easier than ours since they have a reliable la-
beler on the target side, facilitating the generation
of more training data unlike us who are interested
in labeling the resource-poor language.



611

Cross-lingual Annotation Projection. A com-
mon approach to address the lack of annotations is
projecting labels from English to a lower-resource
language of interest. This has shown good results
in the transfer of semantic information to target
languages. Kozhevnikov and Titov (2013) propose
an unsupervised method to transfer SRL labels to
another language by training on the source side
and using shared feature representations for pre-
dicting on the target side. Padó and Lapata (2009)
project FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) SRL la-
bels by searching for the best alignment in source
and target constituent trees, defining label transfer
as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph.
van der Plas et al. (2011) use intersective word
alignments between English and French with ad-
ditional filtering heuristics to determine whether
a PropBank label should be transferred and then
use this to train a joint syntactic-semantic parser
for both languages. Akbik et al. (2015) proposes
a higher-confidence projection by first creating a
system with high precision and low recall and then
using a bootstrap approach to augment the labeled
data.

Separately, Minard et al. (2016) generated a
multilingual event and time parallel corpus includ-
ing SRL annotations. Their corpus was manually
annotated on the English side and automatically
projected to Italian, Spanish, and Dutch based on
the manual alignment of the annotated elements.
Unfortunately, the authors do not report the per-
formance of the SRL task, making it difficult for
us to use their data for benchmarking.

Semantic Role Labeling. Span-based SRL
only exists on English data (Zhou and Xu, 2015;
He et al., 2018; Strubell et al., 2018; Ouchi et al.,
2018). Dependency-based SRL models such as
(Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017; Cai et al., 2018;
Li et al., 2019) are the state-of-the-art for En-
glish. For French, we compare against van der
Plas et al. (2014) since we did not find more recent
work for that language. Roth and Lapata (2016)
show a model based on dependency path embed-
dings that achieved SOTA in English and German.
The Polyglot SRL model of Mulcaire et al. (2018)
shows some improvement over monolingual base-
lines when aggregating all multilingual data avail-
able from CoNLL-09, while more refined integra-
tion did not show further improvement. Their sys-
tem does not perform better than our multilingual
models for English and German.

6 Conclusions

We presented the first cross-lingual SRL system
that translates a sentence and concurrently labels
it with PropBank roles. The proposed Enc-Dec
architecture is flexible: as a monolingual system
the model achieves SOTA for English PropBank
role labeling, the multilingual SRL system shows
that joining multiple languages improves SRL per-
formance over the monolingual baselines, and a
cross-lingual system can be used to generate SRL-
labeled data for lower-resource languages. Eval-
uation of the cross-lingual system shows that the
quality-filtered sentences are highly grammatical
and natural, and that the generated PropBank la-
bels can be more precise than label projection. Us-
ing our labeled data beats a label projection base-
line when using it to augment the training set of a
lower-resource language.

An advantage of our proposed model is that it
does not need parallel data at inference time. Our
current model can possibly be further improved by
adding more automatically generated data in the
data augmentation scenario, or by targeted selec-
tion in an active learning setting. Current limi-
tations of the system may be alleviated by pre-
training the model to acquire better translation
knowledge from larger training data, and by de-
veloping more refined filtering methods.

In future work we also aim to make the system
more flexible, by extending it to few-shot or zero-
shot learning, to alleviate the need for an initial
big annotated set, and thus to be able to generate
SRL data for truly resource-poor languages. Fur-
ther challenges for this novel architecture are to
extend it to joint predicate and role labeling for
more than one predicate at a time.
