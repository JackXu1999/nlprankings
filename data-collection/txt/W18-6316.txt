Abstract

Both research and commercial machine trans-
lation have so far neglected the importance
of properly handling the spelling, lexical and
grammar divergences occurring among lan-
guage varieties. Notable cases are standard
national varieties such as Brazilian and Euro-
pean Portuguese, and Canadian and European
French, which popular online machine transla-
tion services are not keeping distinct. We show
that an evident side effect of modeling such va-
rieties as unique classes is the generation of
inconsistent translations. In this work, we in-
vestigate the problem of training neural ma-
chine translation from English to specific pairs
of language varieties, assuming both labeled
and unlabeled parallel texts, and low-resource
conditions. We report experiments from En-
glish to two pairs of dialects, European-
Brazilian Portuguese and European-Canadian
French, and two pairs of standardized vari-
eties, Croatian-Serbian and Indonesian-Malay.
We show significant BLEU score improve-
ments over baseline systems when translation
into similar languages is learned as a multilin-
gual task with shared representations.

1 Introduction

The field of machine translation (MT) is making
amazing progress, thanks to the advent of neural
models and deep learning. While just few years
ago research in MT was struggling to achieve use-
ful translations for the most requested and high-
resourced languages, the level of translation qual-
ity reached today has raised the demand and in-
terest for less-resourced languages and the so-
lution of more subtle and interesting translation
tasks (Bentivogli et al., 2018). If the goal of
machine translation is to help worldwide com-
munication, then the time has come to also cope
with dialects or more generally language vari-

eties1. Remarkably, up to now, even standard na-
tional language varieties, such as Brazilian and
European Portuguese, or Canadian and European
French, which are used by relatively large pop-
ulations have been quite neglected both by re-
search and industry. Prominent online commer-
cial MT services, such as Google Translate and
Bing, are currently not offering any variety of Por-
tuguese and French. Even worse, systems offering
such languages tend to produce inconsistent out-
puts, like mixing lexical items from different Por-
tuguese (see for instance the translations shown in
Table 1). Clearly, in the perspective of delivering
high-quality MT to professional post-editors and
final users, this problem urges to be fixed.

While machine translation from many to one
varieties is intuitively simpler to approach2, it is
the opposite direction that presents the most rel-
evant problems. First, languages varieties such
as dialects might significantly overlap thus mak-
ing differences among their texts quite subtle (e.g.,
particular grammatical constructs or lexical diver-
gences like the ones reported in the example). Sec-
ond, parallel data are not always labeled at the
level of language variety, making it hard to de-
velop specific NMT engines. Finally, training data
might be very unbalanced among different vari-
eties, due to the population sizes of their respec-
tive speakers or for other reasons. This clearly
makes it harder to model the lower-resourced va-
rieties (Koehn and Knowles, 2017).

In this work we present our initial effort to
systematically investigate ways to approach NMT
from English into four pairs of language varieties:

1In sociolinguistics, a variety is a specific form of lan-
guage, that may include dialects, registers, styles, and other
forms of language, as well as a standard language. See Ward-
haugh (2006) for a more comprehensive introduction.

2We will focus on this problem in future work and disre-
gard possible varieties in the source side, such as American
and British English, in this work.

varieties, we assume to have both parallel text la-
beled with the corresponding couple member, and
parallel text without such information. Moreover,
the considered target pairs, while all being mu-
tually intelligible, present different levels of lin-
guistic similarity and also different proportions of
available training data. For our tasks we rely on
the WIT3 TED Talks collection4, used for the In-
ternational Workshop of Spoken Language Trans-
lation, and OpenSubtitles2018, a corpus of subti-
tles available from the OPUS collection5.

After presenting related work (Section 2) on
NLP and MT of dialects and related languages,
we introduce (in Section 3) baseline NMT sys-
tems, either language/dialect specific or generic,
and multilingual NMT systems, either trained with
fully supervised (or labeled) data or with partially
supervised data. In Section 4, we introduce our
datasets, NMT set-ups based on the Transformer
architecture, and then present the results for each
evaluated system. We conclude the paper with a
discussion and conclusion in Sections 5 and 6.

2.1 Machine Translation of Varieties
Most of the works on translation between and
from/to written language varieties involve rule-
based transformations, e.g., for European and
Brazilian Portuguese (Marujo et al., 2011), In-
donesian and Malay (Tan et al., 2012), Turkish
and Crimean Tatar (Altintas and Çiçekli, 2002); or
phrase-based statistical MT (SMT) systems, e.g.,
for Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian (Popović

3According to Wikipedia, Brazilian Portuguese is a di-
alect of European Portuguese, Canadian French is a dialect
of European French, Serbian and Croatian are standardized
registers of Serbo-Croatian, and Indonesian is a standardized
register of Malay.

et al., 2016), Hindi and Urdu (Durrani et al., 2010),
or Arabic dialects (Harrat et al., 2017). Notably,
Pourdamghani and Knight (2017) build an unsu-
pervised deciphering model to translate between
closely related languages without parallel data.
Salloum et al. (2014) handle mixed Arabic dialect
input in MT by using a sentence-level classifier
to select the most suitable model from an ensem-
ble of multiple SMT systems. In NMT, however,
there have been fewer studies addressing language
varieties. It is reported that an RNN model out-
performs SMT when translating from Catalan to
Spanish (Costa-jussà, 2017) and from European
to Brazilian Portuguese (Costa-Jussà et al., 2018).
Hassan et al. (2017) propose a technique to aug-
ment training data for under-resourced dialects via
projecting word embeddings from a resource-rich
related language, thus enabling training of dialect-
specific NMT systems. The authors generate spo-
ken Levantine-English data from larger Arabic-
English corpora and report improvement in BLEU
scores compared to a low-resourced NMT model.

2.2 Dialect Identification

A large body of research in dialect identifica-
tion stems from the DSL shared tasks (Zampieri
et al., 2014, 2015; Malmasi et al., 2016; Zampieri
et al., 2017). Currently, the best-performing meth-
ods include linear machine learning algorithms
such as SVM, naı̈ve Bayes, or logistic regression,
which use character and word n-grams as features
and are usually combined into ensembles (Jauhi-
ainen et al., 2018). Tiedemann and Ljubeši (2012)
present the idea of leveraging parallel corpora for
language identification: content comparability al-
lows capturing subtle linguistic differences be-
tween dialects while avoiding content-related bi-
ases. The problem of ambiguous sentences, i.e.,
those for which it is impossible to decide upon the
dialect tag, has been demonstrated for Portuguese
by Goutte et al. (2016) through inspection of dis-
agreement between human annotators.

2.3 Multilingual NMT

In a one-to-many multilingual translation scenario,
Dong et al. (2015) proposed a multi-task learn-
ing approach that utilizes a single encoder for
source languages and separate attention mecha-
nisms and decoders for every target language. Lu-
ong et al. (2015) used distinct encoder and decoder
networks for modeling language pairs in a many-
to-many setting. Firat et al. (2016) introduced a
way to share the attention mechanism across mul-
tiple languages. A simplified and efficient mul-
tilingual NMT approach is proposed by Johnson
et al. (2016) and Ha et al. (2016) by prepend-
ing language tokens to the input string. This ap-
proach has greatly simplified multi-lingual NMT,
by eliminating the need of having separate en-
coder/decoder networks and attention mechanism
for every new language pair. In this work we fol-
low a similar strategy, by incorporating an artifi-
cial token as a unique variety flag.

3 NMT into Language Varieties

Our assumption is to translate from language E
(English) into each of two varieties A and B. We
assume to have parallel training data DE→A and
DE→B for each variety as well as unlabeled data
DE→A∪B . For the sake of experimentation we
consider three application scenarios in which a
fixed amount of parallel training data E-A and E-
B is partitioned in different ways:

• Supervised: all sentence pairs are respec-
tively put in DE→A and DE→B , leaving
DE→A∪B empty;

• Unsupervised: all sentence pairs are jointly
put in DE→A∪B , leaving DE→A and DE→B
empty;

• Semi-supervised: two-third of E-A and E-B
are, respectively, put in DE→A and DE→B ,
and the remaining sentence pairs are put in
DE→A∪B .

Supervised and Unsupervised Baselines. For
each translation direction we compare three base-
line NMT systems. The first system is an un-
supervised generic (Gen) system trained on the
union of the language varieties training data. No-
tice that Gen makes no distinction between A
and B and uses all data in an unsupervised way.
The second is a supervised variety-specific system

(Spec) trained on the corresponding language va-
riety training set. The third system (Ada) is ob-
tained by adapting the Gen system to a specific va-
riety.6 Adaptation is carried out by simply restart-
ing the training process from the generic model us-
ing all the available variety specific training data.
Supervised Multilingual NMT. We build on the
idea of multilingual NMT (Mul), where one single
NMT system is trained on the union ofDE→A and
DE→B . Each source sentence both at training and
inference time is prepended with the correspond-
ing target language variety label (A or B). Notice
that the multilingual architecture leverages the tar-
get forcing symbol both as input to the encoder to
build its states, and as initial input to the decoder
to trigger the first target word.
Semi-Supervised Multilingual NMT. We con-
sider here multilingual NMT models that make
also use of unlabeled data DE→A∪B . The first
model we propose, named M-U, uses the available
data DE→A, DE→B and DE→A∪B as they are, by
not specifying any label at training time for entries
from DE→A∪B . The second model, named M-C2,
works similarly to Mul, but relying on a language
variety identification module (trained on the target
data of DE→A and DE→B) that maps each unla-
beled data point either toA orB. The third model,
named M-C3, can be seen as an enhancement of
M-U, as the unlabeled data is automatically classi-
fied into one of three classes: A, B, or A∪B. For
the third class, like with M-U, no label is applied
on the source sentence.

4 Experimental Set-up

4.1 Dataset and Preprocessing
The experimental setting consists of eight target
varieties and English as source. We use pub-
licly available datasets from the WIT3 TED cor-
pus (Cettolo et al., 2012). The summary of the
partitioned training, dev, and test sets are given in
Table 2, where Tr. 2/3 is the labeled portion of the
training set used to train the semi-supervised mod-
els, while the other 1/3 are either held out as un-
labeled (M-U) or classified automatically (M-C2,
M-C3). In the preprocessing stages, we tokenize
the corpora and remove lines longer than 70 to-
kens. The Serbian corpus written in Cyrillic is
transliterated into Latin script with CyrTranslit7.
In addition, to also run a large-data experiment,

we expand the English−European/Brazilian Por-
tuguese data with the corresponding OpenSubti-
tles2018 datasets from the OPUS corpus. Table 2
summarizes the augmented training data, while
keeping the same dev and test sets.

4.2 Experimental Settings

We trained all systems using the Transformer
model8 (Vaswani et al., 2018). We use the Adam
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an ini-
tial learning rate of 0.2 and a dropout also set to
0.2. A shared source and target vocabulary of size
16k is generated via sub-word segmentation (Wu
et al., 2016). The choice for the vocabulary size
follows the recommendations in Denkowski and
Neubig (2017) regarding training of NMT systems
on TED Talks data. Overall we use a uniform set-
ting for all our models, with a 512 embedding di-
mension and hidden units, and 6 layers of self-
attention encoder-decoder network. The training
batch size is of 6144 sub-word tokens and the max
length after segmentation is set to 70. Follow-
ing Vaswani et al. (2017) and for a fair compari-
son, experiments are run for 100k training steps,
i.e., in the low-resource settings all models are ob-
served to converge within these steps. Adapta-
tion experiments are run to convergence, which re-
quires roughly half of the steps (i.e., 50k) required
to train the generic low-resource model. On the
other hand, large-data systems are trained for up
to 800k steps, which also showed to be a conver-
gence point. For the final evaluation we take the
best performing checkpoint on the dev set. All
models are trained using Tesla V100-pcie-16gb on
a single GPU.

4.3 Language Variety Identification
To automatically identify the language variety of
unlabeled target sentences, we train a fastText
model (Joulin et al., 2017), a simple yet efficient
linear bag of words classifier. We use both word-
and character-level n-grams as features. In the
low-resource condition, we train the classifier on
the 2/3 portion of the labeled training data. For
the large-data experiment, instead, we used a rel-
atively smaller and independent corpus consisting
of 3.3 million pt-BR−pt-EU parallel sentences ex-
tracted from OpenSubtitles2018 after filtering out
identical sentences pairs and sentences occurring
(in any of the two varieties) in the NMT train-
ing data. Additionally, low-resource training sen-
tences (fr-CA and ms) are randomly oversampled
to mitigate class imbalance.

For each pair of varieties, we train five base
classifiers differing in random initialization. In the
M-C2 experiments, prediction is determined based
on soft fusion voting, i.e., the final label is the
argmax of the sum of class probabilities. Due to
class skewness in the evaluation set, we report bi-
nary classification performance in terms of ROC
AUC (Fawcett, 2006) instead of accuracy in Ta-
ble 3. For M-C3 models, we handle ambiguous
examples using the majority voting scheme: in or-
der for a label to be assigned, its softmax probabil-
ity should be strictly higher than fifty percents ac-
cording to the majority of the base classifiers, oth-
erwise no tag is applied. On average, this resulted
in <1% of unlabeled sentences for the small data
condition, and about 2% of unlabeled sentences
for the large data condition.

5 Results and Discussion

We run experiments with all the systems intro-
duced in Section 3, on four pairs of languages va-
rieties. Results are reported in Table 4 for the low-
resource setting and in Table 5 for the large data
setting.

models on all considered directions. Remarkably,
the Mul model also outperforms the adapted Ada
model on the available translation directions. The
unsupervised generic model Gen, that mixes to-
gether all the available data, as expected tends to
perform better than the supervised specific mod-
els of the less resourced varieties. Particularly,
this improvement is observed for Malay (ms) and
Canadian French (fr-CA), which respectively rep-
resent the 3.3% and 10% of the overall training
data used by their corresponding (Gen) systems.

On the contrary, a degradation is observed for Eu-
ropean Portuguese (pt-Eu) and Serbian (sr), which
represent 42% and 45% of their respective train-
ing sets. Even though very low-resourced varieties
can benefit from the mix, it is also evident that the
Gen model can easily get biased because of the
imbalance between the datasets.

In the semi-supervised scenario, we report re-
sults with three multilingual systems that integrate
the 1/3 of unlabeled data to the training corpus
in three different ways: (i) without labels (M-U),
(ii) with automatic labels forcing one of two pos-
sible classes (M-C2), (iii) with automatic labels of
one of the two options or no label in case of low
confidence of the classifier (M-C3).

Results show that on average automatic tag-
ging of the unlabeled data is better than leaving
them unlabeled, although M-U still remains a bet-
ter choice than using specialized and generic sys-
tems. The best between M-C2 and M-C3 performs
on average from very close to better than the best
supervised method.

If we look at the single language variety, the
obtained figures are not showing a coherent pic-
ture. In particular, in the Croatian-Serbian and
Indonesian-Malay pairs the best resourced lan-
guage seems to benefit more from keeping the
data unlabeled (M-U). Interestingly, even the worst
semi-supervised model performs very close or
even better than the best supervised model, which
suggests the importance of taking advantage of all
available data even if they are not labeled.

Focusing on the statistically significant im-
provements, the best supervised (Mul) is better
than the unsupervised (Gen), whereas the best
semi-supervised (M-C2 or M-C3) is either com-
parable or better than the best supervised.

5.2 High-resource setting

Unlike what observed in the low-resource setting,
where Mul outperforms Spec in the supervised
scenario, in the large data condition, variety spe-
cific models apparently seem the best choice. No-
tice, however, that the supervised multilingual sys-
tem Mul provides just a slightly lower level of
performance with a simpler architecture (one net-
work in place of two). The unsupervised generic
model Gen, trained with the mix of the two va-
rieties datasets, performs significantly worse than
the other two supervised approaches, this is par-
ticularly visible for the pt-EU direction. Very

likely, in addition to the ambiguities that arise
from naively mixing the data of the two different
dialects, there is also a bias effect towards pt-BR
which is due to the very unbalanced proportions of
data between the two dialects (almost 1:2).

Hence, in the considered high-resource setting,
the Spec and Mul models result as best possi-
ble solutions against which comparing our semi-
supervised approaches.

In the semi-supervised scenario, the obtained
results confirm that our approach of automatically
classifying the unlabeled data DE→A∪B improves
over using the data as they are (M-U). Neverthe-
less, M-U still confirms to perform better than the
fully unlabeled Gen model. In both translation di-
rections, M-C2 and M-C3 get quite close to the
performance of the supervised Spec model. In
particular, M-C3 shows to outperform the M-C2
model, and even outperforms on average the su-
pervised Mul model. In other words, the semi-
supervised model leveraging three-class automatic
labels (of DE→A∪B) seems to perform better than
the supervised model with two dialect labels. Be-
sides the comparable BLEU scores, the supervised
(Spec and Mul) perform in statistically insignifi-
cant way against the best semi-supervised (M-C3),
although outperforming the unsupervised (Gen)
model.

This result raises the question if relabeling all
the training data can be a better option than using a
combination of manual and automatic labels. This
issue is investigated in the next subsection.

Unsupervised Multilingual Models

As discussed in Section 4.3, the language classifier
for the large-data condition is trained on dialect-
to-dialect parallel data that does not overlap with
the NMT training data. This condition permits

hence to investigate a fully unsupervised training
condition. In particular, we assume that all the
available training data is unlabeled and create au-
tomatic language labels for all 47.2M sentences
of pt-BR and 25.5M sentences of pt-EU (see Ta-
ble 2). In a similar way as in Table 5, we keep the
experimental setting of M-C2 and M-C3 models.

Table 6 reports the results of the multilingual
models trained under the above described unsu-
pervised condition. In comparison with the semi-
supervised condition, both M-C2 and M-C3 show
a slight performance improvement. In particular,
the three-label M-C3 performs on average slightly
better than the two-label M-C2 model. Actually,
the little difference is justified by the fact that the
classifier used the “third” label only for 6% of the
data. Remarkably, despite the relatively low per-
formance of the classifier, average score of the best
unsupervised model M-C2 is almost on par with
the supervised model Mul.

5.3 Translation Examples
Finally, in Table 7, we show an additional trans-
lation example produced by our semi-supervised
multilingual models (both under low and high re-
source conditions) translating into the Portuguese
varieties. For comparison we also include out-
put from Google Translate which offers only a
generic English-Portuguese direction. In partic-
ular, the examples contain the word refrigerator
that has specific dialect variants. All our variety-
specific systems show to generate consistent trans-
lations of this term, while Google Translate prefers
to use the Brazilian translation variants for these
sentences.

6 Conclusions

We presented initial work on neural machine
translation from English into dialects and related
languages. We discussed both situations where
parallel data is supplied or not supplied with tar-
get language/dialect labels. We introduced and
compared different neural MT models that can be

Table 7: English to Portuguese translation generated by Google Translate (as of 20th July, 2018) and translations
into Brazilian and European Portuguese generated by our semi-supervised multilingual (M-C2 and M-C3 L) and
supervised Spec models. For the underlined English terms both their Brazilian and European translation variants
are shown.

trained under unsupervised, supervised, and semi-
supervised training data regimes. We reported ex-
perimental results on the translation from English
to four pairs of language varieties with systems
trained under low-resource conditions. We show
that in the supervised regime, best performance is
achieved by training a multilingual NMT system.
For the semi-supervised regime, we compared dif-
ferent automatic labeling strategies that permit to
train multilingual neural MT systems with perfor-
mance comparable to the best supervised NMT
system. Our findings were also confirmed by large
scale experiments performed on English to Brazil-
ian and European Portuguese. In this scenario,
we have also shown that multilingual NMT fully
trained on automatic labels can perform very sim-
ilarly to its supervised version.

In future work, we plan to extend our approach
to language varieties in the source side, as well
as investigate the possibility of applying transfer-
learning (Zoph et al., 2016; Nguyen and Chiang,
2017) for language varieties by expanding our
Ada adaptation approach.
