Abstract

In this paper we present an analysis of
locative alternation phenomena in Russian
and English within a frame-based LTAG
syntax-semantics interface. The combina-
tion of a syntactic theory with an extended
domain of locality and frames provides a
powerful mechanism for argument linking.
Furthermore, the concept of tree families
and unanchored trees in LTAG allows for a
decomposition of meaning into lexical and
constructional components.

1 Introduction

There is a number of formalisms that capture the
idea that the meaning of a verb-based construction
depends both on the lexical meaning of the verb
and on the construction in which the verb is used
(Goldberg, 1995; Van Valin and LaPolla, 1997).
The question is how exactly the meaning compo-
nents are distributed and how they combine.

In (Kallmeyer and Osswald, 2012a) a combi-
nation of Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars
(Joshi and Schabes, 1997) and Frame Semantics
is introduced. Since LTAG displays an extended
domain of locality and, related to this, elementary
trees contain slots for all arguments of their lex-
ical anchor, LTAG is particularly well-suited for
combining it with a frame-based compositional
semantics. When coupling an elementary tree
with a semantic frame, as proposed in (Kallmeyer
and Osswald, 2012a), syntactic arguments can be
directly linked to their counterpart in the seman-
tics. Semantic composition is then modeled by
unification which is a result of performing adjunc-
tions and substitutions. Figure 1 provides a sim-
ple illustration of syntactic and semantic compo-
sition.

Linguistic generalizations in LTAG are cap-
tured a) by the distinction between lexical an-
chor and unanchored elementary tree, b) by the
concept of tree families (representing subcatego-
rization frames) and c) by the factorization in the
metagrammar. Parallel to this syntactic factor-
ization, a factorization of meaning is possible as
well. The resulting framework is very flexible
with respect to the decomposition and composi-
tion of lexical and constructional units on the syn-
tax and semantics level.

In the following, we present an analysis of loca-
tive alternation that benefits from the flexibility
of this framework. The structure of the paper is
as follows. The next section presents the English
and Russian data we are dealing with in this pa-
per. Then, in section 3, we briefly introduce the
framework of frame semantics in LTAG that we
are using. Section 4 proposes an analysis of the
locative alternation in English and Russian within
this framework. In section 5, we further decom-
pose the meaning of some Russian verbs, analyz-
ing the semantics of certain prefixes that change
the verb meaning such that a locative alternation
becomes possible. Finally, section 6 concludes.

2 The Data

(1) - (4) show basic examples of locative alterna-
tion in English and Russian. As there is no stan-
dard name for this constructions in the literature,
let us call the first variant ((1), (3)) prepositional
phrase construction, or PPC, and the second vari-
ant ((2), (4)) - instrumental case construction, or
ICC, for convenience of referring to them.

PPCs are traditionally analyzed as having a
change of location meaning and ICCs as having a
change of state meaning (Kageyama, 1997; Levin
and Rappaport Hovav, 1998; Goldberg, 1995).
An analysis for (1) and (2) following (Kageyama,
1997) is provided in (5). It demonstrates that there
is a difference between the two constructions, but
only the difference in the perspective is shown.

(5) a. X CAUSE [BECOME [hay
BE ON truck]]

b. X CAUSE [BECOME [truck z
BE [WITH [hay BE ON z]]]]

(6) a. [[x ACT] CAUSE [y
BECOME Ploc z] [LOAD]MANNER]

b. [[x ACT] CAUSE [z BECOME
[]STATE WITH-RESPECT-TO y]
[LOAD]MANNER]

The analysis proposed in (Levin and Rappaport
Hovav, 1998), which can be found under (6), pro-
vides more detailed information about the differ-
ence between PPCs and ICCs. (6-a) tells us that
the hay changes its location as a result of the load-
ing event, while (6-b) describes that the result is a
change in the state of the wagon. One can notice
that in (5) there is no explicit reference to the verb
itself and the only component that is taken from
the verb meaning is that the result of the loading
is that the THEME is on the LOCATION in the end.

The question that arises if one looks carefully
at what the sentences in (1) - (4) mean is whether

it is really the case that there is no change of state
in PPC examples? In fact, any loading activity
leads to both a change of location of the content
and some change of state of the container (if it is
specified), just different components of the effect
become more salient. As there is actually only
one action, we propose the following formaliza-
tion: the verb describes a change of location and
the result state depends on the end amount of PA-
TIENT at the GOAL. If this amount is equal to
the capacity of the container, we get the change
of state effect. If it is equal to the total amount
of content, we have a holistic change of location
effect.

Although at first Russian examples look sim-
ilar to the English ones, there are a number of
differences. While (4) has the same meaning as
(2), (3) means that all the hay was loaded. On the
other hand, if we consider imperfective examples
(7) and (8), we find no holistic effect in either ICC
and PPC case. Verbs gruzit’ ’to load’ and mazat’
’to spread’, ’to cover’ (examples (9) and (10)) are
the only non-prefixed verbs that allow locative al-
ternation in written language1. Other verbs allow
only one construction in their non-prefixed variant
(see (11) and (12)) and both constructions, when
a prefix za- is added (see (13) and (14)). A prefix
na- makes the verb perfective but does not change
the set of constructions it can participate in, like
in (15) and (16).

The aim of this work is to provide an analysis
that correctly models the following: a) holistic ef-
fects for English ICC constructions, b) holistic ef-
fects for Russian PPC and ICC constructions with
perfective verb, and c) no holistic effect in other
cases. We also aim at providing an explanation
of why some verbs allow locative alternation and
some do not and how the addition of a prefix to
a Russian verb changes the set of constructions it
can participate in.

3 LTAG and Frame Semantics

Following (Kallmeyer and Osswald, 2012a), we
adopt a syntax-semantics interface that links a sin-
gle semantic representation (in our case, a se-
mantic frame) to an entire elementary tree and
that models semantic composition by unifications
triggered by substitution and adjunction. In this
we partly follow (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003;
Kallmeyer and Romero, 2008), except that our fo-
cus is on event semantics and the decomposition
of lexical meaning and we therefore use frames.

Formally, frames are taken to be typed feature
structures. Each elementary tree is linked to a fea-
ture structure and unification is triggerd via the
feature unifications in the syntax. For this pur-
pose, some of the nodes in the elementary trees
have semantic features such as I (for inidividual)
and E (for event). Their unifications cause equa-
tions between metavariables. As a result, the cor-
responding semantic feature structures are uni-
fied as well. A simplified example was given in
Fig. 1 where the substitutions trigger unifications
between 1 and 3 and between 2 and 4 , which
leads to an insertion of the corresponding argu-
ment frames into the frame of loves.

Figure 2: Path modification

An example taken from (Kallmeyer and Oss-
wald, 2012a) involving an adjunction is given in
Fig. 2 where the path of a walking activity is fur-
ther restricted by an along ... PP modifier. The
frames express that the AT-REGION of the NP em-
bedded under the PP (for instance the brook in
John walked along the brook) contains the RE-
GION of the path. This containment is expressed
as an additional relation between feature values.

Note that the feature structures used for seman-
tics are more complex than the syntactic feature
structures used in LTAG. However, this complex-
ity is limited to the semantic part, the complexity
of syntactic parsing remains unchanged.

As detailed in (Kallmeyer and Osswald,
2012a), LTAG’s decomposition of elementary
trees into a) unanchored trees and lexical anchor
and b) tree fragments of unanchored trees in the
metagrammar can be paired with a correspond-
ing decomposition of meaning, in particular into
contributions of constructions and of lexical ele-
ments. In this paper, we will exploit this for a dis-
tinction of the meaning contributions of ICC and
PPC constructions and of their lexical anchors.

4 Locative Alternation: The Analysis

In this section, we will examine the possible unan-
chored trees involved in our examples of loca-
tive alternations, relating the elementary tree tem-
plates to the semantics of the construction. Fur-
thermore, we will detail the semantics contributed
by lexical anchors and we will show how syntactic
composition triggers semantic frame unification.

In the case of the PPC in English, the seman-
tics of the whole phrase can be compositionaly

derived from the semantics of the verb and its ar-
guments, while in the case of the ICC there is a
part of the meaning, that comes from the construc-
tion itself. The goal now is to provide the meaning
of the ICC and of the verbs allowing locative al-
ternation such that in combination they form the
desired frame representation of the semantics of a
sentence.

4.1 Feature Geometry

Following ideas in (Osswald and Van Valin, Jr.,
2012) where one can find a discussion of the rep-
resentation of events and results using Fillmores
Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) we introduce
attributes of initial and result states and a scale
which is determined by its type, maximum and
minumum value. The change of state is either a
decrease or an increase of a value on an ordered
scale (a discussion of an analysis of scalar change
can be found in (Kennedy and Levin, 2008)). The
type of change of state determines the way the
change happens. For example, change of loca-
tion requires a patient and a goal and the patient
is then moved to the goal according to the scale
(for example, covered area or amount). Inside the
scale attribute the maximum value (feature MAX)
is specified, the minimum value is assumed to be
0. Some of the verbs specify a concrete initial or
result state (INIT and RESULT respectively), but
load does not have any initial or result state spec-
ified within its semantics, so it just determines the
scale with its maximum. Summarizing the ideas,
one obtains the following for our analysis of loca-
tive alternation:
• change of location and change of state are just

different interpretations of the result state of
the scalar change of location;

• a scalar change of location is described by

• the value of SCALE is of type scale with pos-
sible subtypes such as volume, or area, which
can also have subtypes such as capacity and
amount for volume or coverage for area.

4.2 The Construction

So far, we were looking only at examples where
both container and content are realized. However,
the constructions that are being discussed can also
be used when only the direct object of the verb is
present; in this case, they will have the same dif-
ference in semantics. Therefore, for the PPC and
ICC construction, we obtain the unanchored ele-
mentary trees shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.2 In the
ICC trees, the second NPINSTR stands for both
NP in instrumental case in Russian and PP with

other trees (for extraction and passivization, for instance) are
of course in the tree family as well.

Let us present our analysis by going through
the decomposition of the verbal trees for (1) - (4).

Figures 6 and 7 show the frames for the unan-
chored trees for the ICC in English and Russian
respectively. The frame for the PPC is common
for both languages and represented in Fig. 8. In all
three frames, the scalar change of location is em-
bedded under the EFFECT attribute of the causa-
tion event that describes the meaning of the verbal
construction. The ICC frame in Fig. 6 expresses
that in the initial state there is nothing at the GOAL
and in the result state the amount of PATIENT at
the GOAL is equal to the maximum value speci-
fied in the SCALE inside the GOAL. This gives us
the meaning that if the GOAL is a container and
thus has a capacity scale, it’s result state will be
full. As already mentioned, in Russian this is not
necessarily so. Therefore, in Fig. 7, the effect of
the causation is less specified. The part which is

structure is actually needed. In this respect, our trees are
slightly simplified for the sake of this paper.

4.3 Semantic Frame Composition

Let us first go through the full composition of (2).
Fig. 9 gives the lexical semantics of load. When

ing the tree in Fig. 10, the frames from Fig. 6 and

Figure 12: Frames for wagon and hay

We assume that frames for nouns such as
wagon or hay come with a SCALE attribute that
can be for instance of type capacity as for wagon
or amount as in the case of hay, see Fig. 12. When
substituting the wagon into the direct object posi-
tion, because of the linking I features, the value
3 of the GOAL feature in the frame in Fig. 11 is
unified with the wagon frame. As a result, the
maximal value on the capacity scale of the wagon
provides the value of the result state, yielding the
frame in 13. At the next step, hay is substituted
into the instrumental object slot in the tree (see
Fig. 14), causing a unification of its frame with the
value 2 of PATIENT. The resulting frame (Fig. 15)
represents that in the result state the amount of
hay in the wagon is equal to the maximal capacity
of the wagon, in other words the wagon is full. As
we have seen, the construction determines which
scale is relevant for the result state; in an ICC con-
struction it is the scale of the goal, i.e., the capac-
ity of the wagon.

In contrast to this, in the PPC construction, the
scale of the PATIENT is the relevant scale for the
scalar change of location. In the case of hay, the

ever, as expressed in the PPC frame, the RESULT
value is not necessarily equal to the MAX value of
the relevant scale. Consequently, no holistic effect
arises in this case.

5 Morphological Decomposition

Let us now turn to the Russian examples (11) -
(16). There are two questions we aim to answer:
• How does holistic meaning arise?
• Why does adding the prefix za- make some

verbs eligible for both ICC and PPC?
The idea is that most verbs, for example sypat’

’to pour, but for non-liquids’, have a restriction
on the type of their relevant scale (see frame in
Fig. 16), which does not allow them to com-
bine with nouns that do not have an appropri-
ate scale type, like banka ’can’ whose frame is

Figure 15: Resulting frame for the ICC and load

shown in Fig. 17. Note that, in contrast to the
previous section, we now allow multivalued (i.e.,
set-valued) scale values for cases where several
scales are possible. Can for instance has both a
surface (area) that can be covered and a volume
(capacity) that can be filled. When unifying with
such a multivalued attribute, unification with one
of the values must be successfull. When adding
the noun in direct object position, the SCALE in-
side the change of location must unify with the
SCALE of the noun. In the case of sypat’ the uni-
fication fails since the type amount cannot unify
with any of the two scale types of can.

What happens when a prefix is added? First,
the perfective meaning is added (the part of the
meaning that comes together with the ICC in En-
glish), see frames for both na- (Fig. 19) and za-
(Fig. 18). Second, if the prefix za- is added, the
scale restriction is removed (20). If the prefix na-
is added, the restriction remains. As a prelim-
inary analysis of this, let us introduce attributes
that can overwrite something instead of unifying
with it. This operation is allowed only on the mor-
phological level and thus does not affect the com-
positionality of semantic derivation. The under-

lined SCALE attribute in the frame for za- prefix
(Fig. 18) replaces the SCALE attribute in the verb
frame and we obtain the resulting frame in 20 for
the verb zasypat’ ’to cover’, ’to fill’.4

This analysis is in line with ideas from (Filip,
2000; Filip, 2003), where the meaning of Slavic
prefixes is discussed. Both prefixes presented here
derive a perfective verb from an imperfective one,
but with different meanings: while zasypat’ is a
quantized verb, nasypat’ (as well as sypat’) is a
cummulative one and this leads to the restrictions
on the direct object type (which is here expressed
via the type of scales).

After the morphological step is computed, only
standard unification is used. However, now the
verb can participate in both the PPC and ICC con-
structions because it is now unifiable (after com-
bination with the construction frames) with ob-
jects of container type (like can), as well as with
objects of a content type (like hay or sugar).

4A more detailed investigation of the morphology-
semantcs interface is planned for future research.

As mentioned above, at the moment we assume
multiple values for the SCALE attribute of objects
like banka ’can’. An alternative solution might
be to store the object frame in the lexicon with
characteristic attributes of this object, such as a
CAPACITY attribute with a value of maximum ca-
pacity of the object, and then allow for such at-
tributes to be transformed in the SCALE attribute.
We leave this issue for future research.

Let us illustrate the multivalue approach that
we currently assume by performing the substitu-
tion of the noun banka ’can’, Fig. 17 into the tree
for the verb gruzit’ ’to load’ in the ICC. There
are two different scale types inside the object of
can available for the unification while substituting
can in a direct object position in the ICC, capac-
ity and area. As there is no restriction on the type
of the scale inside the verb, both unifications are
possibe and lead to different interpretations of ex-
ample (14): in case the capacity scale is selected,
the result state of the can is full (Fig. 21) and in
case the area scale is selected, the can is covered
(Fig. 22).

6 Conclusion

In this paper we present an analysis of locative
alternation phenomena in Russian and English
using the combination of an LTAG and Frame
Semantics. This analysis uses LTAG’s mecha-
nism of separation between unanchored elemen-
tary trees and lexical anchors to separate the con-
tribution of the lexical meaning from the contri-
bution of construction and follows the ideas ex-
pressed in (Kallmeyer and Osswald, 2012b). An
advantage of combining LTAG with Frame Se-
mantics is that LTAG’s extended domain of lo-
cality allows direct linking of thematic roles of
the arguments with corresponding syntactic slots.
From the other side, Frame Semantics allows a
reach meaning factorization, as is illustrated in the
provided analysis of locative alternation.

Additionally, some ideas for morphological de-
composition are presented, which is especially
useful for languages with a rich morphology, such
as Russian.
