Abstract 

This paper presents ongoing research aiming 

at the automated extraction of knowledge-rich 

contexts (KRCs) from a Russian language 

corpus. The notion of KRCs was introduced 

by Meyer (2001) and refers to a term’s co-text 

(Sebeok, 1986) as a reservoir of potentially 

important information about a concept. From a 

terminological point of view, it seems that 

KRCs contain exactly the kind of information 

that should be included into a terminology 

database. Accordingly, the question how 

KRCs can be automatically acquired has been 

widely studied in recent years. However, many 

languages including Russian still lack 

thorough study. This paper presents 

preliminary experimental results obtained on a 

specialized corpus in the automotive domain. 

1 Shifting paradigms in terminology: 
dealing with contexts 

Terminology studies today are marked by a 

notable shift of paradigms. The increasing use of 

corpora has not left the discipline untouched and 

triggered research mainly in the field of 

terminology extraction (cf. Ahmad and Rogers, 

2001). Work on context extraction is a rather 

recent development, but the idea that a term’s co-

text yields not only linguistic, but also semantic 

information and corpora can be used for 

conceptual analysis is now widely accepted. 

Accordingly, Dubuc and Lauriston (1997) 

describe defining and explanatory contexts for 

terminology, Pearson (1998) provides a detailed 

study of defining contexts in English and 

ISO 12620: 2009 (ISO 2009) describes context 

types similar to those put forward by Dubuc and 

Lauriston. However, actual implementations of 

KRC extraction are still rare and many major 

languages have not been studied yet. Moreover, 

important theoretical and methodological issues 

remain unresolved. These include questions 

concerning the epistemological status of 

automatically extracted information and the 

notion of “concept” in a corpus-based setting. 

Aussenac-Gilles et al. (2000), for example, 

define the concept as a “normalized meaning”, 

i. e. the result of corpus-based processes rather 

than stable, text-independent notions. It still 

needs to be shown how these developments 

relate to practical terminology work. 

Our research aims at tackling these issues by 

giving an evaluation of corpus-based techniques 

in context extraction as well as by contributing to 

their further development. In the following 

section, we outline main directions of research in 

KRC extraction. Section 3 presents preliminary 

experimental results. Section 4 summarizes the 

results obtained and outlines further work.  

2 Related work 

In KRCs, knowledge about a concept’s 

attributes or the relations it forms with other 

concepts is made explicit by means of cue words 

or other linguistic patterns (Meyer, 2001, 

Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003). These can be 

referred to as Knowledge Patterns or KPs 

(Barrière, 2004). The following approaches to 

context extraction can be differentiated: 

 pattern-based approaches: The use of 
linguistic patterns for context extraction 

was suggested by Hearst (1992) and 

consists in defining lexico-syntactic 

patterns that indicate a semantic 

relationship. Studies in this tradition are 

Pearson (1998), Meyer (2001), Barrière 

(2004), Malaisé et al. (2005), Aussenac-

Gilles and Jacques (2006), Sierra et al. 

(2008), and others.

NODALIDA 2011 Conference Proceedings, pp. 311–314



 bootstrapping of semantic relations: This 
method starts from pre-defined patterns or 

seed relations and derives new relation 

instances for an iterative process of pattern 

generalisation. Examples are, again, 

Hearst (1992), Brin (1998), Condamines 

and Rebeyrolle (2001), Agichtein and 

Gravano (2000), Alfonseca et al. (2006), 

Xu (2007), and Auger and Barrière (2008). 

Various approaches that combine linguistic 

information with machine learning have been 

developed (Maedche, Staab, 2000; Buitelaar et 

al. 2004). A particularly interesting approach is 

presented by Mustafaraj et al. (2006) who map 

semantic information on frame-semantic 

representations and use machine learning for 

automated role annotation. 

3 KRCs in Russian: method outline 

Although frame-semantic (Fillmore, 1985) 

methods seem to be linguistically sounder than 

patterns which give the impression of being ad 

hoc constructions, they exhibit serious 

drawbacks. Frame representations are not readily 

available for many languages. In multilingual 

and multidisciplinary terminology, therefore, the 

use of robust patterns that can be easily adapted 

to new domains and languages seems to be more 

feasible. 

In our study, a list of tentative patterns was 

created by analysing relevant contexts in 

specialized texts. A specialized corpus was built 

using the BABOUK crawler (TTC, 2010). The 

Russian automotive corpus spans roughly 

350 000 words in plain text. On this corpus, a 

series of extraction experiments was carried out. 

A Perl script was used to extract sentences 

containing previously defined patterns. Pattern 

occurrences were counted and relevant 

occurrences measured against overall 

occurrences. This method was proposed by 

Barrière (2004) similarly to traditional precision 

metrics.  

In a first experimental cycle, extraction was 

based on simple keyword search. Precision for 

all KPs was between 0,40 and 0,60. For a second 

cycle, 159 target terms were selected from the 

corpus and combined with refined patterns. 

Regular expressions were used for extraction in 

order to retrieve inflected forms. Consequently, 

the detected KPs should be regarded as semantic 

paradigms rather than lexical units. The final list 

of regular expressions contains 5212 items and is 

based on 22 KPs with the term in pre- and 11 

KPs with the term in postposition. Table 1 

visualizes keywords used for KP definition:

Table 1: Keywords of tentative knowledge 

patterns 

 

Before the second extraction cycle, stop 

sentences were filtered out from the corpus, i. e.: 

 incomplete sentences 

 questions 

 sentences beginning with stop words such 
as determiners and pronouns  

These measures are essential for excluding 

sentences with anaphoric reference or single-case 

information which are responsible for a big share 

of noise in KRC extraction (cf. Meyer, 2001), 

but also for dealing with the particularities of 

internet text and unwanted pattern occurrences. 

By these measures, precision could be improved 

for some of our patterns. Sentences a) and b) are 

extracted example sentences: 

 

a) Šassi avtomobilȃ sostoit iz transmissii i 
hodovoj časti i mehanizmov upravleniȃ.

transmission, the frame and control 

equipment. 

 

b) Sistema ohlaždeniȃ služit dlȃ otvoda 
izlišnego tepla ot detalej dvigatelȃ, 

nagrevaûŝihsȃ pri ego rabote. 

 

The cooling system serves to remove 

excess heat from those parts of the motor 

which heat up during exploitation. 

 

The results in the extraction experiments are 

still too variable to be considered final. 

Moreover, relevance decisions are not always 

straightforward. Questionable cases are 

erroneous sentences and associative contexts 

(cf. ISO, 2009). Another yet open problem is the 

extraction of lists containing classifications 

following introductory sentences on KPs such as 

Različaût, without which the KRC is worthless. 

In other cases, the extracted sentence is a KRC, 

but relates not to the target term, but to a closely 

related term. This is due to the absence of 

syntactic information, because of which KPs can 

be located at any position in the sentence, e. g. 

within dependency relations. In the experiment 

reported here these cases have, however, been 

evaluated as relevant KRCs. Table 2 presents 

Russian KPs that by now can be considered 

reliable:

sluzhit 0,80-0,92

načen

Različaût 1,00 

Table 2: Reliable KPs 

 

Other patterns such as predstavlȃet soboj 

have stable results as well, but their occurrences 

in the studied corpus are too few to allow for 

final precision estimates. 

4 Interpretation of results and future 
work 

The outlined results shed light on two 

important shortcomings of pattern-based KRC 

extraction. The first one is data sparseness. 

Reliability estimations require large corpora that 

provide many pattern occurrences. This problem 

calls for a search strategy that uses the web as a 

corpus, otherwise dealing with very large local 

corpora and long lists of regular expressions will 

become intractable. There also is some hope that 

the problem of data quality mentioned in the 

previous section can be overcome by more data. 

The second aspect is precision. It is clear that 

the KRCs described so far have an accidental 

element. The use of syntactic information in 

pattern creation may alleviate these shortcomings 

and provide a sound basis for the automated 

semantic analysis of extracted sentences by using 

semantic situation templates (Xu, 2007).  

However, the advantage of the work described 

in this paper consists in its using light-weight 

methods. Acceptable results can be achieved for 

at least some of the tested patterns by means of a 

hand full of simple commands and tasks. In our 

view, this advantage of pattern-based approaches 

should not be given up easily. Our further work 

will therefore  be directed at overcoming the 

difficulties mentioned. Moreover, bootstrapping 

methods will be tested by using reliable patterns 

established so far as seeds in order to identify 

more KPs. The developed method will be 

evaluated by means of an extraction task in a 

new domain and transferred to new languages 

such as German and Latvian.
