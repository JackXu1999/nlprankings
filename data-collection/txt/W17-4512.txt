Abstract

We investigate the problem of reader-
aware multi-document summarization
(RA-MDS) and introduce a new dataset
for this problem. To tackle RA-MDS,
we extend a variational auto-encodes
(VAEs) based MDS framework by jointly
considering news documents and reader
comments. To conduct evaluation for
summarization performance, we prepare
a new dataset. We describe the methods
for data collection, aspect annotation, and
summary writing as well as scrutinizing
by experts. Experimental results show
that reader comments can improve the
summarization performance, which also
demonstrates the usefulness of the pro-
posed dataset. The annotated dataset for
RA-MDS is available online1.

1 Introduction

The goal of multi-document summarization
(MDS) is to automatically generate a brief, well-
organized summary for a topic which describes
an event with a set of documents from different
sources. (Goldstein et al., 2000; Erkan and Radev,
2004; Wan et al., 2007; Nenkova and McKeown,
2012; Min et al., 2012; Bing et al., 2015; Li et al.,
2017). In the typical setting of MDS, the input is a
set of news documents about the same topic. The
output summary is a piece of short text document
containing several sentences, generated only based
on the input original documents.

With the development of social media and mo-
bile equipments, more and more user generated

content is available. Figure 1 is a snapshot of
reader comments under the news report “The most
important announcements from Google’s big de-
velopers’ conference”2. The content of the orig-
inal news report talks about some new products
based on AI techniques. The news report gener-
ally conveys an enthusiastic tone. However, while
some readers share similar enthusiasms, some oth-
ers express their worries about new products and
technologies and these comments can also reflect
their interests which may not be very salient in
the original news reports. Unfortunately, existing
MDS approaches cannot handle this issue. We
investigate this problem known as reader-aware
multi-document summarization (RA-MDS). Un-
der the RA-MDS setting, one should jointly con-
sider news documents and reader comments when
generating the summaries.

One challenge of the RA-MDS problem is how
to conduct salience estimation by jointly consider-
ing the focus of news reports and the reader in-
terests revealed by comments. Meanwhile, the
model should be insensitive to the availability of
diverse aspects of reader comments. Another chal-
lenge is that reader comments are very noisy, not
fully grammatical and often expressed in infor-

mal expressions. Some previous works explore
the effect of comments or social contexts in single
document summarization such as blog summariza-
tion (Hu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2011). However,
the problem setting of RA-MDS is more challeng-
ing because the considered comments are about an
event which is described by multiple documents
spanning a time period. Another challenge is that
reader comments are very diverse and noisy. Re-
cently, Li et al. (2015) employed a sparse coding
based framework for RA-MDS jointly considering
news documents and reader comments via an un-
supervised data reconstruction strategy. However,
they only used the bag-of-words method to repre-
sent texts, which cannot capture the complex rela-
tionship between documents and comments.

Recently, Li et al. (2017) proposed a sentence
salience estimation framework known as VAE-
Sum based on a neural generative model called
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma and
Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014). During
our investigation, we find that the Gaussian based
VAEs have a strong ability to capture the salience
information and filter the noise from texts. Intu-
itively, if we feed both the news sentences and the
comment sentences into the VAEs, commonly ex-
isted latent aspect information from both of them
will be enhanced and become salient. Inspired by
this consideration, to address the sentence salience
estimation problem for RA-MDS by jointly con-
sidering news documents and reader comments,
we extend the VAESum framework by training the
news sentence latent model and the comment sen-
tence latent model simultaneously by sharing the
neural parameters. After estimating the sentence
salience, we employ a phrase based compressive
unified optimization framework to generate a final
summary.

There is a lack of high-quality dataset suitable
for RA-MDS. Existing datasets from DUC3 and
TAC4 are not appropriate. Therefore, we intro-
duce a new dataset for RA-MDS. We employed
some experts to conduct the tasks of data collec-
tion, aspect annotation, and summary writing as
well as scrutinizing. To our best knowledge, this
is the first dataset for RA-MDS.

Our contributions are as follows: (1) We inves-
tigate the RA-MDS problem and introduce a new
dataset for the problem of RA-MDS. To our best

4http://tac.nist.gov/

knowledge, it is the first dataset for RA-MDS. (2)
To tackle the RA-MDS, we extend a VAEs-based
MDS framework by jointly considering news doc-
uments and reader comments. (3) Experimen-
tal results show that reader comments can im-
prove the summarization performance, which also
demonstrates the usefulness of the dataset.

2 Framework

2.1 Overview

As shown in Figure 2, our reader-aware news sen-
tence salience framework has three main compo-
nents: (1) latent semantic modeling; (2) comment
weight estimation; (3) joint reconstruction. Con-
sider a dataset Xd and Xc consisting of nd news
sentences and nc comment sentences respectively
from all the documents in a topic (event), repre-
sented by bag-of-words vectors. Our proposed
news sentence salience estimation framework is
extended from VAESum (Li et al., 2017), which
can jointly consider news documents and reader
comments. One extension is that, in order to ab-
sorb more useful information and filter the noisy
data from comments, we design a weight estima-
tion mechanism which can assign a real value ρi
for a comment sentence xic. The comment weight
ρ ∈ Rnc is integrated into the VAEs based sen-
tence modeling and data reconstruction compo-
nent to handle comments.

2.2 Reader-Aware Salience Estimation

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and
Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) is a genera-
tive model based on neural networks which can be
used to conduct latent semantic modeling. Li et al.
(2017) employ VAEs to map the news sentences
into a latent semantic space, which is helpful in
improving the MDS performance. Similarly, we
also employ VAEs to conduct the semantic mod-
eling for news sentences and comment sentences.
Assume that both the prior and posterior of the la-
tent variables are Gaussian, i.e., pθ(z) = N (0, I)
and qφ(z|x) = N (z; µ,σ2I), where µ and σ de-
note the variational mean and standard deviation
respectively, which can be calculated with a multi-
layer perceptron (MLP). VAEs can be divided into
two phases, namely, encoding (inference), and de-
coding (generation). All the operations are de-

picted as follows:

henc = relu(Wxhx+ bxh)
µ = Whµhenc + bhµ
log(σ2) = Whσhenc + bhσ
ε ∼ N (0, I), z = µ+ σ ⊗ ε
hdec = relu(Wzhz + bzh)
x′ = sigmoid(Whxhdec + bhx)

(1)

Based on the reparameterization trick in Equa-
tion 1, we can get the analytical representation of
the variational lower bound L(θ, ϕ; x):

log p(x|z) =
|V |∑
i=1

xi log x

i + (1− xi) · log(1− x′i)

−DKL[qϕ(z|x)‖pθ(z)]= 12
K∑
i=1

(1 + log(σ2i )− µ2i − σ2i )

where x denotes a general sentence, and it can be
a news sentence xd or a comment sentnece xc.

By feeding both the news documents and the
reader comments into VAEs, we equip the model
a ability of capturing the information from them
jointly. However, there is a large amount of noisy
information hidden in the comments. Hence we
design a weighted combination mechanism for
fusing news and comments in the VAEs. Precisely,
we split the variational lower bound L(θ, ϕ; x)

into two parts and fuse them using the comment
weight ρ:

L(θ, ϕ; x) = L(θ, ϕ; xd) + ρ× L(θ, ϕ; xc) (2)
The calculation of ρ will be discussed later.

The news sentence salience estimation is con-
ducted by an unsupervised data reconstruction
framework. Assume that Sz = {s1z, s2z, · · · , smz }
are m latent aspect vectors used for recon-
structing all the latent semantic vectors Z =
{z1, z2, · · · , zn}. Thereafter, the variational-
decoding progress of VAEs can map the latent as-
pect vector Sz to Sh, and then produce m new as-
pect term vectors Sx:

sh = relu(Wzhsz + bzh)
sx = sigmoid(Whxsh + bhx)

(3)

VAESum (Li et al., 2017) employs an alignment
mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al.,
2015) to recall the lost detailed information from
the input sentence. Inspired this idea, we design a
jointly weighted alignment mechanism by consid-
ering the news sentence and the comment sentence
simultaneously. For each decoder hidden state sih,
we align it with each news encoder hidden state hjd

93



by an alignment vector ad ∈ Rnd . We also align it
with each comments encoder hidden state hjc by an
alignment vector ac ∈ Rnc . In order to filter the
noisy information from the comments, we again
employ the comment weight ρ to adjust the align-
ment vector of comments:

ãc = ac × ρ (4)

The news-based context vector cid and the
comment-based context vector cic can be obtained
by linearly blending the input hidden states respec-
tively. Then the output hidden state can be updated
based on the context vectors:

s̃ih = tanh(W
h
dhc

i
d +W

h
chc

i
c +W

a
hhs

i
h) (5)

Then we can generate the updated output aspect
vectors based on s̃ih. We add a similar alignment
mechanism into the output layer.

Sz , Sh, and Sx can be used to reconstruct the
space to which they belong respectively. In or-
der to capture the information from comments, we
design a joint reconstruction approach here. Let
Ad ∈ Rnd×m be the reconstruction coefficient
matrix for news sentences, and Ac ∈ Rnc×m be
the reconstruction coefficient matrix for comment
sentences. The optimization objective contains
three reconstruction terms, jointly considering the
latent semantic reconstruction and the term vector
space reconstruction for news and comments re-
spectively:

LA = (‖Zd −AdSz‖22 + ‖Hd −AdSh‖22
+ ‖Xd −AdSx‖22) + ρ× (‖Zc −AcSz‖22
+ ‖Hc −AcSh‖22 + ‖Xc −AcSx‖22)

(6)

This objective is integrated with the variational
lower bound of VAEs L(θ, ϕ; x) and optimized in
a multi-task learning fashion. Then the new opti-
mization objective is:

J = min
Θ

(−L(θ, ϕ;x)+LA) (7)

where Θ is a set of all the parameters related to this
task. We define the magnitude of each row of Ad
as the salience scores for the corresponding news
sentences.

We should note that the most important variable
in our framework is the comment weight vector
ρ, which appears in all the three components of
our framework. The basic idea for calculating ρ
is that if the comment sentence is more similar to

the news content, then it contains less noisy infor-
mation. For all the news sentences Xd and all the
comment sentences Xc, calculate the relation ma-
trix R ∈ Rnd×nc by:

R = Xd ×XTc (8)

Then we add an average pooling layer to get the
coefficient value for each comment sentence:

r =
1
nc

nc∑
i=1

R[i, :] (9)

Finally, we add a sigmoid function to adjust the
coefficient value to (0, 1):

ρ = sigmoid(r) (10)

Because we have different representations from
different vector space for the sentences, therefore
we can calculate the comment weight in different
semantic vector space. Here we use two spaces,
namely, latent semantic space obtained by VAEs,
and the original bag-of-words vector space. Then
we can merge the weights by a parameter λp:

ρ = λp × ρz + (1− λp)× ρx (11)

where ρz and ρx are the comment weight calcu-
lated from latent semantic space and term vector
space. Actually, we can regard ρ as some gates to
control the proportion of each comment sentence
absorbed by the framework.

2.3 Summary Construction
In order to produce reader-aware summaries, in-
spired by the phrase-based model in Bing et al.
(2015) and Li et al. (2015), we refine this model to
consider the news sentences salience information
obtained by our framework. Based on the parsed
constituency tree for each input sentence, we ex-
tract the noun-phrases (NPs) and verb-phrases
(VPs). The overall objective function of this opti-
mization formulation for selecting salient NPs and
VPs is formulated as an integer linear program-
ming (ILP) problem:

max{
∑
i

αiSi −
∑
i<j

αij(Si + Sj)Rij}, (12)

where αi is the selection indicator for the phrase
Pi, Si is the salience scores of Pi, αij and Rij is
co-occurrence indicator and the similarity a pair
of phrases (Pi, Pj) respectively. The similarity is

94



calculated with the Jaccard Index based method.
In order to obtain coherent summaries with good
readability, we add some constraints into the ILP
framework. For details, please refer to Wood-
send and Lapata (2012), Bing et al. (2015), and
Li et al. (2015). The objective function and con-
straints are linear. Therefore the optimization can
be solved by existing ILP solvers such as simplex
algorithms (Dantzig and Thapa, 2006). In the im-
plementation, we use a package called lp solve5.

3 Data Description

In this section, we describe the preparation process
of the dataset. Then we provide some properties
and statistics.

3.1 Background

The definition of the terminology related to the
dataset is given as follows.6

Topic: A topic refers to an event and it is com-
posed of a set of news documents from different
sources.
Document: A news article describing some as-
pects of the topic. The set of documents in the
same topic typically span a period, say a few days.
Category: Each topic belongs to a category.
There are 6 predefined categories: (1) Acci-
dents and Natural Disasters, (2) Attacks (Crimi-
nal/Terrorist), (3) New Technology, (4) Health and
Safety, (5) Endangered Resources, and (6) Inves-
tigations and Trials (Criminal/Legal/Other).
Aspect: Each category has a set of prede-
fined aspects. Each aspect describes one im-
portant element of an event. For example, for
the category “Accidents and Natural Disasters”,
the aspects are “WHAT”, “WHEN”, “WHERE”,
“WHY”, “WHO AFFECTED”, “DAMAGES”,
and “COUNTERMEASURES”.
Aspect facet: An aspect facet refers to the actual
content of a particular aspect for a particular topic.
Take the topic “Malaysia Airlines Disappearance”
as an example, facets for the aspect “WHAT”
include “missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370”,
“two passengers used passports stolen in Thailand
from an Austrian and an Italian.” etc. Facets
for the aspect “WHEN” are “ Saturday morning”,

5http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/
6In fact, for the core terminology, namely, topic,

document, category, and aspect, we follow the
MDS task in TAC (https://tac.nist.gov/
/2011/Summarization/Guided-Summ.2011.
guidelines.html).

“about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur”,
etc.
Comment: A piece of text written by a reader con-
veying his or her altitude, emotion, or any thought
on a particular news document.

3.2 Data Collection

The first step is to select topics. The selected top-
ics should be in one of the above categories. We
make use of several ways to find topics. The first
way is to search the category name using Google
News. The second way is to follow the related tags
on Twitter. One more useful method is to scan the
list of event archives on the Web, such as earth-
quakes happened in 2017 7.

For some news websites, in addition to provide
news articles, they offer a platform to allow read-
ers to enter comments. Regarding the collection of
news documents, for a particular topic, one con-
sideration is that reader comments can be easily
found. Another consideration is that all the news
documents under a topic must be collected from
different websites as far as possible. Similar to the
methods used in DUC and TAC, we also capture
and store the content using XML format.

Each topic is assigned to 4 experts, who are ma-
jor in journalism, to conduct the summary writing.
The task of summary writing is divided into two
phases, namely, aspect facet identification, and
summary generation. For the aspect facet identi-
fication, the experts read and digested all the news
documents and reader comments under the topic.
Then for each aspect, the experts extracted the re-
lated facets from the news document. The sum-
maries were generated based on the annotated as-
pect facets. When selecting facets, one consider-
ation is those facets that are popular in both news
documents and reader comments have higher pri-
ority. Next, the facets that are popular in news
documents have the next priority. The generated
summary should cover as many aspects as possi-
ble, and should be well-organized using complete
sentences with a length restriction of 100 words.

After finishing the summary writing procedure,
we employed another expert for scrutinizing the
summaries. Each summary is checked from five
linguistic quality perspectives: grammaticality,
non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, and co-
herence. Finally, all the model summaries are
stored in XML files.

3.3 Data Properties

The dataset contains 45 topics from those 6 pre-
defined categories. Some examples of topics
are “Malaysia Airlines Disappearance”, “Flappy
Bird”, “Bitcoin Mt. Gox”, etc. All the topics and
categories are listed in Appendix A. Each topic
contains 10 news documents and 4 model sum-
maries. The length limit of the model summary
is 100 words (slitted by space). On average, each
topic contains 215 pieces of comments and 940
comment sentences. Each news document con-
tains an average of 27 sentences, and each sen-
tence contains an average of 25 words. 85%
of non-stop model summary terms (entities, uni-
grams, bigrams) appeared in the news documents,
and 51% of that appeared in the reader comments.
The dataset contains 19k annotated aspect facets.

4 Experimental Setup

4.1 Dataset and Metrics

The properties of our own dataset are depicted in
Section 3.3. We use ROUGE score as our evalua-
tion metric (Lin, 2004) with standard options8. F-
measures of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-
SU4 are reported.

4.2 Comparative Methods

To evaluate the performance of our dataset and the
proposed framework RAVAESum for RA-MDS,
we compare our model with the following meth-
ods:

• RA-Sparse (Li et al., 2015): It is a frame-
work to tackle the RA-MDS problem. A
sparse-coding-based method is used to cal-
culate the salience of the news sentences
by jointly considering news documents and
reader comments.

• Lead (Wasson, 1998) : It ranks the news sen-
tences chronologically and extracts the lead-
ing sentences one by one until the length
limit.

• Centroid (Radev et al., 2000): It summa-
rizes clusters of news articles automatically
grouped by a topic detection system, and then
it uses information from the centroids of the
clusters to select sentences.

A -p 0.5 -t 0

• LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) and
TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004):
Both methods are graph-based unsupervised
framework for sentence salience estimation
based on PageRank algorithm.

• Concept (Bing et al., 2015): It generates ab-
stractive summaries using phrase-based opti-
mization framework with concept weight as
salience estimation. The concept set con-
tains unigrams, bigrams, and entities. The
weighted term-frequency is used as the con-
cept weight.

We can see that only the method RA-Sparse can
handle RA-MDS. All the other methods are only
for traditional MDS without comments.

4.3 Experimental Settings

The input news sentences and comment sentences
are represented as BoWs vectors with dimension
|V |. The dictionary V is created using unigrams,
bigrams and named entity terms. nd and nc are
the number of news sentences and comment sen-
tences respectively. For the number of latent as-
pects used in data reconstruction, we let m = 5.
For the neural network framework, we set the hid-
den size dh = 500 and the latent size K = 100.
For the parameter λp used in comment weight, we
let λp = 0.2. Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is
used for gradient based optimization with a learn-
ing rate 0.001. Our neural network based frame-
work is implemented using Theano (Bastien et al.,
2012) on a single GPU9.

5 Results and Discussions

5.1 Results on Our Dataset

The results of our framework as well as the base-
line methods are depicted in Table 1. It is obvi-
ous that our framework RAVAESum is the best
among all the comparison methods. Specifically, it
is better than RA-Sparse significantly (p < 0.05),
which demonstrates that VAEs based latent se-
mantic modeling and joint semantic space recon-
struction can improve the MDS performance con-
siderably. Both RAVAESum and RA-Sparse are
better than the methods without considering reader
comments.

5.2 Further Investigation of Our Framework

To further investigate the effectiveness of our
proposed RAVAESum framework, we adjust
our framework by removing the comments re-
lated components. Then the model settings of
RAVAESum-noC are similar to VAESum (Li
et al., 2017). The evaluation results are shown
in Table 2, which illustrate that our framework
with reader comments RAVAESum is better than
RAVAESum-noC significantly(p < 0.05).

Moreover, as mentioned in VAESum (Li et al.,
2017), the output aspect vectors contain the word
salience information. Then we select the top-10
terms for event “Sony Virtual Reality PS4”, and
“‘Bitcoin Mt. Gox Offlile”’ for model RAVAE-
Sum (+C) and RAVAESum-noC (-C) respectively,
and the results are shown in Table 3. It is obvi-
ous that the rank of the top salience terms are dif-
ferent. We check from the news documents and
reader comments and find that some terms are en-
hanced by the reader comments successfully. For
example, for the topic “Sony Virtual Reality PS4”,
many readers talked about the product of “Ocu-
lus”, hence the word “oculus” is assigned a high
salience by our model.

5.3 Case Study

Based on the news and comments of the topic
“Sony Virtual Reality PS4”, we generate two
summaries with our model considering com-
ments (RAVAESum) and ignoring comments

9Tesla K80, 1 Kepler GK210 is used, 2496 Cuda cores,

(RAVAESum-noC) respectively. The summaries
and ROUGE evaluation are given in Table 4. All
the ROUGE values of our model considering com-
ments are better than those ignoring comments
with large gaps. The sentences in italic bold of
the two summaries are different. By reviewing the
comments of this topic, we find that many read-
ers talked about “Oculus”, the other product with
virtual reality techniques. This issue is well iden-
tified by our model and select the sentence “Mr.
Yoshida said that Sony was inspired and encour-
aged to do its own virtual reality project after the
enthusiastic response to the efforts of Oculus VR
and Valve, another game company working on the
technology.”.

6 Conclusions

We investigate the problem of reader-aware multi-
document summarization (RA-MDS) and intro-
duce a new dataset. To tackle the RA-MDS, we
extend a variational auto-encodes (VAEs) based
MDS framework by jointly considering news doc-
uments and reader comments. The methods
for data collection, aspect annotation, and sum-
mary writing and scrutinizing by experts are de-
scribed. Experimental results show that reader
comments can improve the summarization perfor-
mance, which demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed dataset.
