Abstract

We investigate from the competence stand-
point two recent models of lexical semantics,
algebraic conceptual representations and con-
tinuous vector models.

Characterizing what it means for a speaker to be
competent in lexical semantics remains perhaps the
most significant stumbling block in reconciling the
two main threads of semantics, Chomsky’s cogni-
tivism and Montague’s formalism. As Partee (1979)
already notes (see also Partee 2013), linguists as-
sume that people know their language and that their
brain is finite, while Montague assumed that words
are characterized by intensions, formal objects that
require an infinite amount of information to specify.

In this paper we investigate two recent models of
lexical semantics that rely exclusively on finite in-
formation objects: algebraic conceptual representa-
tions (ACR) (Wierzbicka, 1985; Kornai, 2010; Gor-
don et al., 2011), and continuous vector space (CVS)
models which assign to each word a point in finite-
dimensional Euclidean space (Bengio et al., 2003;
Turian et al., 2010; Pennington et al., 2014). After a
brief introduction to the philosophical background
of these and similar models, we address the hard
questions of competence, starting with learnability
in Section 2; the ability of finite networks or vectors
to replicate traditional notions of lexical relatedness
such as synonymy, antonymy, ambiguity, polysemy,
etc. in Section 3; the interface to compositional se-
mantics in Section 4; and language-specificity and

universality in Section 5. Our survey of the litera-
ture is far from exhaustive: both ACR and CVS have
deep roots, with significant precursors going back at
least to Quillian (1968) and Osgood et al. (1975) re-
spectively, but we put the emphasis on the compu-
tational experiments we ran (source code and lexica
available at github.com/kornai/4lang).

1 Background

In the eyes of many, Quine (1951) has demolished
the traditional analytic/synthetic distinction, relegat-
ing nearly all pre-Fregean accounts of word mean-
ing from Aristotle to Locke to the dustbin of his-
tory. The opposing view, articulated clearly in Grice
and Strawson (1956), is based on the empirical ob-
servation that people make the call rather uniformly
over novel examples, an argument whose import is
evident from the (at the time, still nascent) cogni-
tive perspective. Today, we may agree with Putnam
(1976):

‘Bachelor’ may be synonymous with ‘un-
married man’ but that cuts no philosophic
ice. ‘Chair’ may be synonymous with
‘moveable seat for one with back’ but that
bakes no philosophic bread and washes no
philosophic windows. It is the belief that
there are synonymies and analyticities of a
deeper nature - synonymies and analytici-
ties that cannot be discovered by the lex-
icographer or the linguist but only by the
philosopher - that is incorrect.

Fortunately, one philosopher’s trash may just turn
out to be another linguist’s treasure. What Putnam
has demonstrated is that “a speaker can, by all rea-
sonable standards, be in command of a word like
water without being able to command the intension
that would represent the word in possible worlds se-
mantics” (Partee, 1979). Computational systems of
Knowledge Representation, starting with the Teach-
able Word Comprehender of Quillian (1968), and
culminating in the Deep Lexical Semantics of Hobbs
(2008), carried on this tradition of analyzing word
meaning in terms of ‘essential’ or ‘analytic’ compo-
nents.

A particularly important step in this direction
is the emergence of modern, computationally ori-
ented lexicographic work beginning with Collins-
COBUILD (Sinclair, 1987), the Longman Dictio-
nary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Bogu-
raev and Briscoe, 1989), WordNet (Miller, 1995),
FrameNet (Fillmore and Atkins, 1998), and Verb-
Net (Kipper et al., 2000). Both the network- and
the vector-based approach build on these efforts, but
through very different routes.

Traditional network theories of Knowledge Rep-
resentation tend to concentrate on nominal features
such as the IS A links (called hypernyms in Word-
Net) and treat the representation of verbs somewhat
haphazardly. The first systems with a well-defined
model of predication are the Conceptual Depen-
dency model of Schank (1972), the Natural Syntax
Metalanguage (NSM) of Wierzbicka (1985), and a
more elaborate deep lexical semantics system that is
still under construction by Hobbs and his coworkers
(Hobbs, 2008; Gordon et al., 2011). What we call al-
gebraic conceptual representation (ACR) is any such
theory encoded with colored directed edges between
the basic conceptual units. The algebraic approach
provides a better fit with functional programming
than the more declarative, automata-theoretic ap-
proach (Huet and Razet, 2008), and makes it possi-
ble to encode verbal subcategorization (case frame)
information that is at the heart of FrameNet and
VerbNet in addition to the standardly used nominal
features (Kornai, 2010).

Continuous vector space (CVS) is also not a sin-
gle model but a rich family of models, generally
based on what Baroni (2013) calls the distributional
hypothesis, that semantically similar items have sim-

ilar distribution. This idea, going back at least to
Firth (1957) is not at all trivial to defend, and not just
because defining ‘semantically similar’ is a chal-
lenging task: as we shall see, there are significant de-
sign choices involved in defining similarity of vec-
tors as well. To the extent CVS representations are
primarily used in artificial neural net models, it may
be helpful to consider the state of a network being
described by the vector whose nth coordinate gives
the activation level of the nth neuron. Under this
conception, the meaning of a word is simply the ac-
tivation pattern of the brain when the word is pro-
duced or perceived. Such vectors have very large
(1010) dimension so dimension reduction is called
for, but direct correlation between brain activation
patterns and the distribution of words has actually
been detected (Mitchell et al., 2008).

2 Learnability

The key distinguishing feature between ‘explana-
tory’ or competence models and ‘descriptive’ or per-
formance models is that the former, but not the latter,
come complete with a learning algorithm (Chomsky,
1965). Although there is a wealth of data on chil-
dren’s acquisition of lexical entries (McKeown and
Curtis, 1987), neither cognitive nor formal seman-
tics have come close to formulating a robust theory
of acquisition, and for intensions, infinite informa-
tion objects encoding the meaning in the formal the-
ory, it is not at all clear whether such a learning al-
gorithm is even possible.

2.1 The basic vocabulary

The idea that there is a small set of conceptual prim-
itives for building semantic representations has a
long history both in linguistics and AI as well as in
language teaching. The more theory-oriented sys-
tems, such as Conceptual Dependency and NSM as-
sume only a few dozen primitives, but have a disqui-
eting tendency to add new elements as time goes by
(Andrews, 2015). In contrast, the systems intended
for teaching and communication, such as Basic En-
glish (Ogden, 1944) start with at least a thousand
primitives, and assume that these need to be further
supplemented by technical terms from various do-
mains. Since the obvious learning algorithm based
on any such reductive system is one where the primi-

166



tives are assumed universal (and possibly innate, see
Section 5), and the rest is learned by reduction to the
primitives, we performed a series of ‘ceiling’ exper-
iments aiming at a determination of how big the uni-
versal/innate component of the lexicon must be. A
trivial lower bound is given by the current size of the
NSM inventory, 65 (Andrews, 2015), but as long as
we don’t have the complete lexicon of at least one
language defined in NSM terms the reductivity of
the system remains in doubt.

For English, a Germanic language, the first prov-
ably reductive system is the Longman Defining Vo-
cabulary (LDV), some 2,200 items, which provide
a sufficient basis for defining all entries in LDOCE
(using English syntax in the definitions). Our work
started with a superset of the LDV that was obtained
by adding the most frequent words according to
the Google unigram count (Brants and Franz, 2006)
and the BNC, as well as the most frequent words
from a Slavic, a Finnougric, and a Romance lan-
guage (Polish, Hungarian, and Latin), and Whitney
(1885) to form the 4lang conceptual dictionary,
with the long-term design goal of eventually provid-
ing reductive definitions for the vocabularies of all
Old World languages. Ács et al. (2013) describes
how bindings in other languages can be created au-
tomatically and compares the reductive method to
the familiar term- and document-frequency based
searches for core vocabulary.

This superset of LDV, called ‘4lang’ in Table 1
below, can be considered a directed graph whose
nodes are the disambiguated concepts (with expo-
nents in four languages) and whose edges run from
each definiendum to every concept that appears in its
definition. Such a graph can have many cycles. Our
main interest is with selecting a defining set which
has the property that each word, including those that
appear in the definitions, can be defined in terms of
members of this set. Every word that is a true prim-
itive (has no definition, e.g. the basic terms of the
Schank and NSM systems) must be included in the
defining set, and to these we must add at least one
vertex from every directed cycle. Thus, the prob-
lem of finding a defining set is equivalent to find-
ing a feedback vertex set, (FVS) a problem already
proven NP-complete in Karp (1972). Since we can-
not run an exhaustive search, we use a heuristic al-
gorithm which searches for a defining set by gradu-

ally eliminating low-frequency nodes whose outgo-
ing arcs lead to not yet eliminated nodes, and make
no claim that the results in Table 1 are optimal, just
that they are typical of the reduction that can be ob-
tained by modest computation. We defer discussion
of the last line to Section 4, but note that the first line
already implies that a defining set of 1,008 concepts
will cover all senses of the high frequency items in
the major Western branches of IE, and to cover the
first (primary) sense of each word in LDOCE 361
words suffice.

Table 1: Properties of four different dictionaries

While a feedback vertex set is guaranteed to ex-
ist for any digraph (if all else fails, the entire set of
vertices will do), it is not guaranteed that there ex-
ists one that is considerably smaller than the entire
graph. (For random digraphs in general see Dutta
and Subramanian 2010, for highly symmetrical lat-
tices see Zhou 2013 ms.) In random digraphs under
relatively mild conditions on the proportion of edges
relative to nodes, Łuczak and Seierstad (2009) show
that a strong component essentially the size of the
entire graph will exist. Fortunately, digraphs built
on definitions are not at all behaving in a random
fashion, the strongly connected components are rel-
atively small, as Table 1 makes evident. For ex-
ample, in the English Wiktionary, 369,281 defini-
tions can be reduced to a core set of 2,504 defin-
ing words, and in CED we can find a defining set of
6,490 words, even though these dictionaries, unlike
LDOCE, were not built using an explicit defining
set. Since LDOCE pioneered the idea of actively
limiting the defining vocabulary, it is no great sur-
prise that it has a small feedback vertex set, though
everyday users of the LDV may be somewhat sur-

167



prised that less than half (1,061 items) of the full
defining set (over 2,200 items) are needed.

We also experimented with an early (pre-
COBUILD) version of the Collins English Dictio-
nary (CED), as this is more representative of the tra-
ditional type of dictionaries which didn’t rely on a
defining vocabulary. In 154,061 definitions, 65,891
words are used, but only 15,464 of these are not
headwords in LDOCE. These words appear in less
than 10% of Collins definitions, meaning that using
LDOCE as an intermediary the LDV is already suffi-
cient for defining over 90% of the CED word senses.
An example of a CED defining word missing not just
from LDV but the entire LDOCE would be aigrette
‘a long plume worn on hats or as a headdress, esp.
one of long egret feathers’.

This number could be improved to about 93%
by detail parsing of the CED definitions. For ex-
ample, aigrette actually appears as crossreference
in the definition of egret, and deleting the cross-
reference would not alter the sense of egret being
defined. The remaining cases would require bet-
ter morphological parsing of latinate terms than we
currently have access to: for now, many definitions
cannot be automatically simplified because the sys-
tem is unaware that e.g. nitrobacterium is the singu-
lar of nitrobacteria. Manually spot-checking 2% of
the remaining CED words used in definitions found
over 75% latinate technical terms, but no instances
of undefinable non-technical senses that would re-
quire extending the LDV. This is not that every sense
of every nontechnical word of English is listed in
LDOCE, but inspecting even more comprehensive
dictionaries such as the Concise Oxford Dictionary
or Webster’s 3rd makes it clear that their definitions
use largely words which are themselves covered by
LDOCE. Thus, if we see a definition such as naph-
tha ‘kinds of inflammable oil got by dry distillation
of organic substances as coal, shale, or petroleum’
we can be nearly certain that words like inflammable
which are not part of the LDV will nevertheless be
definable in terms of it, in this case as ‘materials or
substances that will start to burn very easily’.
The reduction itself is not a trivial task, in that a sim-
plified definition of naphtha such as ‘kinds of oils
that will start to burn very easily and are produced by
dry distillation . . . ’ can eliminate inflammable only
if we notice that the ‘oil’ in the definition of naph-

Figure 1: Original definition of naphtha

Figure 2: Reduced definition of naphtha

tha is the ‘material or substance’ in the definition of
inflammable. Similarly, we have to understand that
‘got’ was used in the sense obtained or produced,
that dry distillation is a single concept ‘the heating
of solid materials to produce gaseous products’ that
is not built compositionally from dry and distilla-
tion in spite of being written as two separate words,
and so forth. Automated detection and resolution
of these and similar issues remain challenging NLP
tasks, but from a competence perspective it is suffi-
cient to note that manual substitution is performed
effortlessly and near-uniformly by native speakers.

2.2 Learnability in CVS semantics
The reductive theory of vocabulary acquisition is a
highly idealized one, for surely children don’t learn
the meaning of sharp by their parents telling them
it means ‘having a thin cutting edge or point’. Yet
it is clear that computers that lack a sensory sys-
tem that would deliver intense signals upon encoun-

168



tering sharp objects can nevertheless acquire some-
thing of the meaning by pure deduction (assuming
also that they are programmed to know that cutting
one’s body will CAUSE PAIN) and further, the domi-
nant portion of the vocabulary is not connected to di-
rect sensory signals but is learned from context (see
Chapter 6 of McKeown and Curtis 1987).

This brings us to CVS semantics, where learning
theory is idealized in a very different way, by assum-
ing that the learner has access to very large corpora,
gigaword and beyond. We must agree with Miller
and Chomsky (1963) that in real life a child exposed
to a word every second would require over 30 years
to hear gigaword amounts, but we take this to be a
reflection of the weak inferencing ability of current
statistical models, for there is nothing in the argu-
ment that says that models that are more efficient in
extracting regularities can’t learn these from orders
of magnitude less data, especially as children are
known to acquire words based on a single exposure.
For now, such one shot learning remains something
of an ideal, in that CVS systems prune infrequent
words (Collobert et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013a;
Luong et al., 2013), but it is clear that both CVS
and ACR have the beginnings of a feasible theory of
learning, while the classical theory of meaning pos-
tulates offers nothing of the sort, not even for the
handful of lexical items (tense and aspect markers
in particular, see Dowty 1979) where the underlying
logic has the resources to express these.

3 Lexical relatedness

Ordinary dictionary definitions can be mined to re-
cover the conceptual entailments that are at the heart
of lexical semantic competence. Whatever naphtha
is, knowing that it is inflammable is sufficient for
knowing that it will start to burn easily. It is a major
NLP challenge to make this deduction (Dagan et al.
2006), but ACR can store the information trivially
and make the inference by spreading activation.

We implemented one variant of the ACR theory of
word meaning by a network of Eilenberg machines
(Eilenberg, 1974) corresponding to elements of the
reduced vocabulary. Eilenberg machines are a sim-
ple generalization of the better known finite state au-
tomata (FSA) and transducers (FSTs) that have be-
come standard since Koskenniemi (1983) in describ-

ing the rule-governed aspects of the lexicon, mor-
photactics and morphophonology (Huet and Razet,
2008; Kornai, 2010). The methods we use for defin-
ing word senses (concepts) are long familiar from
Knowledge Representation. We assume the reader is
familiar with the knowledge representation literature
(for a summary, see Brachman and Levesque 2004),
and describe only those parts of the system that dif-
fer from the mainstream assumptions. In particular,
we collapse attribution, unary predication, and IS A
links in a single link type ‘0’ (as in Figs. 1-2 above)
and have only two other kinds of links to distinguish
the arguments of transitive verbs, ‘1’ corresponding
to subject/agent; and ‘2’ to object/patient. The treat-
ment of other link types, be they construed as gram-
matical functions or as deep cases or even thematic
slots, is deferred to Section 4.

By creating graphs for all LDOCE headwords
based on dependency parses of their definitions (the
‘literal’ network of Table 1) using the unlexicalized
version of the Stanford Dependency Parser (Klein
and Manning, 2003), we obtained measures of lex-
ical relatedness by defining various similarity met-
rics over pairs of such graphs. The intuition under-
lying all these metrics is that two words are seman-
tically similar if their definitions overlap in (i) the
concepts present in their definitions (e.g. the def-
inition of both train and car will make reference
to the concept vehicle) and (ii) the binary relations
they take part in (e.g. both street and park are IN
town). While such a measure of semantic similar-
ity builds more on manual labor (already performed
by the lexicographers) than those gained from state-
of-the-art CVS systems, recently the results from
the ‘literal’ network have been used in a competi-
tive system for measuring semantic textual similar-
ity (Recski and Ács, 2015). In Section 4 we dis-
cuss the ‘formal’ network of Table 1 built directly
on the concept formulae. By spectral dimension re-
duction of the incidence matrix of this network we
can create an embedding that yields results on world
similarity tasks comparable to those obtained from
corpus-based embeddings (Makrai et al., 2013).

CVS models can be explicitly tested on their abil-
ity to recover synonymy by searching for the near-
est word in the sample (Mikolov et al., 2013b);
antonymy by reversing the sign of the vector (Zweig,
2014); and in general for all kinds of analogical

169



statements such as king is to queen as man is to
woman by vector addition and subtraction (Mikolov
et al., 2013c); not to speak of cross-language
paraphrase/translation (Schwenk et al., 2012), long
viewed a key intermediary step toward explaining
competence in a foreign language.

Currently, CVS systems are clearly in the lead on
such tasks, and it is not clear what, if anything, can
be salvaged from the truth-conditional approach to
these matters. At the same time, the CVS approach
to quantifiers is not mature, and ACR theories sup-
port generics only. These may look like backward
steps, but keep in mind that our goal in compe-
tence modeling is to characterize everyday knowl-
edge, shared by all competent speakers of the lan-
guage, while quantifier and modal scope ambiguities
are something that ordinary speakers begin to appre-
ciate only after considerable schooling in these mat-
ters, with significant differences between the naive
(preschool) and the learned adult systems (É. Kiss
et al., 2013). On the traditional account, only sub-
sumption (IS A or ‘0’) links can be easily recovered
from the meaning postulates, the cognitively central
similarity (as opposed to exact synonymy) relations
receive no treatment whatsoever, since similarity of
meaning postulates is undefined.

4 Lexical lookup

The interaction with compositional semantics is a
key issue for any competence theory of lexical se-
mantics. In the classical formal system, this is han-
dled by a mechanism of lexical lookup that substi-
tutes the meaning postulates at the terminal nodes of
the derivation tree, at the price of introducing some
lexical redundancy rule that creates the intensional
meaning of each word, including the evidently non-
intensional ones, based on the meaning postulates
that encode the extensional meaning. (Ch. 19.2 of
Jacobson (2014) sketches an alternative treatment,
which keeps intensionality for the intended set of
cases.) While there are considerable technical diffi-
culties of formula manipulation involved, this is re-
ally one area where the classical theory shines as a
competence theory – we cannot even imagine to cre-
ate a learning algorithm that would cover the mean-
ing of infinitely many complex expressions unless
we had some means of combining the meanings of

the lexical entries.
CVS semantics offers several ways of combining

lexical entries, the simplest being simply adding the
vectors together (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), but
the use of linear transformations (Lazaridou et al.,
2013) and tensor products (Smolensky, 1990) has
also been contemplated. Currently, an approach that
combines the vectors of the parts to form the vec-
tor of the whole by recurrent neural nets appears to
work best (Socher et al., 2013), but this is still an
area of intense research and it would be premature
to declare this method the winner. Here we concen-
trate on ACR, investigating the issue of the inventory
of graph edge colors on the same core vocabulary as
discussed above. The key technical problem is to
bring the variety of links between verbs and their
arguments under control: as Woods (1975) already
notes, the naive ACR theories are characterized by a
profusion of link types (graph edge colors).

We created a version of ACR that is limited to
three link types. Both the usual network represen-
tations (digraphs, as in Figs. 1 and 2 above) and
a more algebraic model composed of extended fi-
nite state automata (Eilenberg machines) are pro-
duced by parsing formulas defined by a formal
grammar summarized in Figure 3. For ease of read-
ing, in unary predication (e.g. mouse 0−→ rodent)
we permit both prefix and suffix order, but with
different kinds of parens mouse[rodent] and
rodent(mouse); and we use infix notation (cow
MAKE milk) for transitives (cow 1←− MAKE 2−→
milk, link types ‘1’ and ‘2’).

The right column of Figure 3 shows the digraph
obtained from parsing the formula on the right hand
hand side of the grammar rules. There are no ‘3’
or higher links, as ditransitives like x give y to z are
decomposed at the semantic level into unary and bi-
nary atoms, in this case CAUSE and HAVE, ‘x cause
(z have y)’, see Kornai (2012) for further details. A
digraph representing the whole lexicon was built in
two steps: first, every clause in definitions was man-
ually translated to a formula (which in turns is au-
tomatically translated into a digraph), then the di-
graphs were connected by unifying nodes that have
the same label and no outgoing edges.

The amount of manual labor involved was con-
siderably lessened by the method of Section 3 that

Figure 3: The syntax of the definitions

finds the feedback vertex set, in that once such a
set is given, the rest could be built automatically.
This gives us a means of investigating the prevalence
of what would become different deep cases (colors,
link types) in other KR systems. Deep cases are dis-
tinguishers that mediate between the purely seman-
tic (theta) link types and the surface case/adposition
system. We have kept our system of deep cases
rather standard, both in the sense of representing a
common core among the many proposals starting
with Gruber (1965) and Fillmore (1968) and in the
sense of aiming at universality, a subject we defer to
the next section. The names and frequency of use in
the core vocabulary are given in Table 2. The results
are indicative of a primary (agent/patient, what we
denote ‘1’/‘2’), a secondary (DAT/REL/POSS), and
a tertiary (locative) layer in deep cases – how these
are mapped on language-specific (surface) cases will
be discussed in Section 5.

20 TO target of action

Table 2: Deep cases

To avoid problems with multiple word senses
and with constructional meaning (as in dry dis-
tillation or dry martini) we defined each entry in
this formal language (keeping different word senses
such as light/739 ‘the opposite of dark’ and
light/1381 ‘the opposite of heavy’ distinct by
disambiguation indexes) and built a graph directly
on the resulting conceptual network rather than the
original LDOCE definitions. The feedback ver-
tex set algorithm uroboros.py determined that
a core set of 129 concepts are sufficient to define
the others in the entire concept dictionary, and thus
for the entire LDOCE or similar dictionaries such as
CED or Webster’s 3rd. This upper bound is so close
to the NSM lower bound of 65 that a blow-by-blow
comparison would be justified.

5 Universality

The final issue one needs to investigate in assess-
ing the potential of any purported competence the-
ory is that of universality versus language particu-
larity. For CVS theories, this is rather easy: we have
one system of representation, finite dimensional vec-
tor spaces, which admits no typological variation,
let alone language-specific mechanisms – one size
fits all. As linguists, we see considerable variation
among the surface, and possibly even among the
deeper aspects of case linking (Smith, 1996), but as
computational modelers we lack, as of yet, a better
understanding of what corresponds to such mecha-
nisms within CVS semantics.

ACR systems are considerably more transparent
in this regard, and the kind of questions that we
would want to pose as linguists have direct re-
flexes in the formal system. Many of the original
theories of conceptual representation were English-
particular, sometimes to the point of being as naive
as the medieval theories of universal language (Eco,
1995). The most notable exception is NSM, clearly
developed with the native languages of Australia in
mind, and often exercised on Russian, Polish, and
other IE examples as well. Here we follow the spirit
of GFRG (Ranta, 2011) in assuming a common ab-
stract syntax for all languages. For case grammar
this requires some abstraction, for example English
NPs must also get case marked (an idea also present
in the ‘Case Theory’ of Government-Binding and re-
lated theories of transformational grammar). The
main difference between English and the overtly
case-marking languages such as Russian or Latin is
that in English we compute the cases from preposi-
tions and word order (position relative to the verb)
rather than from overt morphological marking as
standard. This way, the lexical entries can be kept
highly abstract, and for the most part, universal.
Thus the verb go will have a source and a goal.
For every language there is a langspec compo-
nent of the lexicon which stores e.g. for English the
information that source is expressed by the preposi-
tion from and destination by to. For Hungarian the
langspec file stores the information that source
can be linked by delative, elative, and ablative; goal
by illative, sublative, or terminative. Once this
kind of language-specific variation is factored out,

the go entry becomes before AT src, after
AT goal. The same technique is used to encode
both lexical entries and constructions in the sense
of Berkeley Construction Grammar (CxG, see Gold-
berg 1995).

Whether two constructions (in the same language
or two different languages) have to be coded by dif-
ferent deep cases is measured very badly, if at all,
by the standard test suits used e.g. in paraphrase de-
tection or question answering, and we would need
to invest serious effort in building new test suites.
For example, the system sketched above uses the
same deep case, REL, for linking objects that are
surface marked by quirky case and for arguments
of predicate nominals. Another example is the da-
tive/experiencer/beneficent family. Whether the ex-
periencer cases familiar from Korean and elsewhere
can be subsumed under the standard dative role (Fill-
more, 1968) is an open question, but one that can
at least be formulated in ACR. Currently we dis-
tinguish the dative DAT from possessive marking
POSS, generally not considered a true case but quite
prevalent in this function language after language:
consider English (the) root of a tree, or Polish ko-
rzen drzewa. This is in contrast to the less fre-
quent cases like (an excellent) occasion for mar-
tyrdom marked by obliques (here the preposition
for). What these nouns (occasion, condition, rea-
son, need) have in common is that the related word
is goal of the definiendum in some sense. In these
cases we use TO rather than POSS, a decision with
interesting ramifications elsewhere in the system,
but currently below the sensitivity of the standard
test sets.

6 Conclusion

It is not particularly surprising that both CVS and
ACR, originally designed as performance theories,
fare considerably better in the performance realm
than Montagovian semantics, especially as detailed
intensional lexica have never been crafted, and
Dowty (1979) remains, to this day, the path not taken
in formal semantics. It is only on the subdomain
of the logic puzzles involving Booleans and quan-
tification that Montagovian solutions showed any
promise, and these, with the exception of elemen-
tary negation, do not even appear in more down to

172



earth evaluation sets such as (Weston et al., 2015).
The surprising conclusion of our work is that stan-
dard Montagovian semantics also falls short in the
competence realm, where the formal theory has long
been promoted as offering psychological reality.

We have compared CVS and ACR theories of lex-
ical semantics to the classical approach based on
meaning postulates by the usual criteria for compe-
tence theories. In Section 2 we have seen that both
ACR and CVS are better in terms of learnability than
the standard formal theory, and it is worth noting that
the number of ACR primitives, 129 in the version
implemented here, is less than the dimensions of
the best performing CVS embeddings, 150-300 af-
ter data compression by PCA or similar methods. In
Section 3 we have seen that lexical relatedness tasks
also favor ACR and CVS over the meaning postulate
approach (for a critical overview of meaning postu-
lates in model-theoretic semantics see Zimmermann
1999), and in Section 4 we have seen that composi-
tionality poses no problems for ACR. How compo-
sitional semantics is handled in CVS semantics re-
mains to be seen, but the problem is not a dearth of
plausible mechanisms, but rather an overabundance
of these.

Acknowledgments

The 4lang conceptual dictionary is the work of
many people over the years. The name is no longer
quite justified, in that natural language bindings, au-
tomatically generated and thus not entirely free of
errors and omissions, now exist for 50 languages
(Ács et al., 2013), many of them outside the Indoeu-
ropean and Finnougric families originally targeted.
More important, formal definitions of the concepts
that rely on less than a dozen theoretical primitives
(including the three link types) and only 129 core
concepts, are now available for all the concepts. So
far, only the theoretical underpinnings of this formal
system have been fully described in English (Kornai,
2010; Kornai, 2012), with many details presented
only in Hungarian (Kornai and Makrai, 2013), but
the formal definitions, and the parser that can build
both graphs and Eilenberg machines from these,
are now available as part of the kornai/4lang
github repository. These formal definitions were
written primarily by Makrai, with notable contribu-

tions by Recski and Nemeskey.
The system has been used as an experimental plat-

form for a variety of purposes, including quantita-
tive analysis of deep cases by Makrai, who devel-
oped the current version of the deep case system
with Nemeskey (Makrai, 2015); for defining lexi-
cal relatedness (Makrai et al., 2013; Recski and Ács,
2015); and in this paper, for finding the definitional
core, the feedback vertex set.

Ács wrote the first version of the feedback ver-
tex set finder which was adapted to our data by
Ács and Pajkossy, who also took part in the com-
putational experiments, including preprocessing the
data, adapting the vertex set finder, and running
the experiments. Recski created the pipeline in
the http://github/kornai/4lang reposi-
tory that builds formal definitions from English dic-
tionary entries. Kornai advised and wrote the paper.

We are grateful to Attila Zséder (HAS Linguistics
Institute) for writing the original parser for the for-
mal language of definitions and to András Gyárfás
(HAS Rényi Institute) for help with feedback vertex
sets. Work supported by OTKA grant #82333.
