Abstract

factuality is

Event
information about
whether events mentioned in natural lan-
guage correspond to either actual events
that have occurred in the real world or
events that are of uncertain interpreta-
tion. Factuality analysis is useful for infor-
mation extraction and textual entailment
recognition, among others, but sufﬁcient
performance has not yet been achieved by
the machine learning-based approach. It is
now important to take a closer look at the
linguistics phenomena involved in factual-
ity analysis and identify the technical re-
search issues more precisely. In this paper,
we discuss issues regarding lexical knowl-
edge through error analysis of a Japanese
factuality analyzer based on lexical knowl-
edge and compositionality.

1 Introduction

Event factuality is information about whether
events mentioned in natural language correspond
to either actual events that have occurred in the
real world or events that are of uncertain interpre-
tation.

(We :::::::

For example, we can interpret that the event “de”
(leave) in (1a) is factual in the real world, the
event “kaet” (go home) in (1b) is possibly fac-
tual because of the modal auxiliary “-ta-no-daro-
u” (may have -ed), and the event “hassei-suru”

(occurrence) in (1c) is counterfactual because of
the implicative predicate “fusei-da” (prevented).

Factuality analysis is useful for a broad range
of NLP applications such as information extrac-
tion, question answering, and textual entailment
recognition. Prior work on factuality analysis has
made considerable efforts for designing and cre-
ating corpora manually annotated with factuality-
related information (Saur´ı and Pustejovsky, 2009;
Matsuyoshi et al., 2010; Tanaka et al., 2013,
etc.) and several empirical studies on those re-
sources are reported revealing the difﬁculties of
the task (Inui et al., 2008; Matsuyoshi et al., 2010;
Morante and Blanco, 2012; Saur´ı and Pustejovsky,
2012). For Japanese, Matsuyoshi et al. (2010) re-
port that their factuality classes are highly skewed
and the minority classes are very difﬁcult for their
machine learning-based models to precisely iden-
tify. The minority classes include uncertain state-
ments as in example (1b) and counterfactual state-
ments as in (1c). Such “marked” statements are far
less frequent than unmarked statements (i.e. cer-
tain factual statements) and thus are not as easy
to collect as unmarked statements. While the
label distribution is reported to be less skewed
in English (Szarvas et al., 2008), still uncertain
and counterfactual statements constitute minority
classes. In addition, uncertain and counterfactual
statements exhibit a very broad variety of linguis-
tic devices for expressing uncertainty and nega-
tion. For those reasons, the whole task is not as
easy as it appears and simple strategies based on
supervised machine learning do not work well.

Given this background, rather than putting ev-
erything simply into a machine learning algorithm,
it is now important to take a closer look at the lin-
guistics phenomena involved in factuality analy-
sis and identify the technical research issues more
precisely. One promising way for it is to make
use of existing lexical resources and divide the
whole issues into those related to lexical knowl-
edge and the rest. We take this approach in this

588

paper because (i) the factuality status is primar-
ily expresses by lexical devices such as auxiliaries
(e.g. “-ta-no-darou” (may have -ed)) and factual
and counterfactual predicates (e.g. “fusegu” (pre-
vent)), and (ii) there are existing Japanese lexicons
of such factuality-related expressions (factuality
markers, henceforth) available with a reasonably
broad coverage. As a platform for computing fac-
tuality with factuality markers, we adopt Saur´ı and
Pustejovsky’s rule-based model for English factu-
ality analysis (Saur´ı and Pustejovsky, 2012) and
adapt it to the Japanese language. Saur´ı and Puste-
jovsky’s model is suitable as it assumes the avail-
ability of a factuality lexicon and uses it to identify
the factuality status of each subordinate event in a
compositional manner from the factuality status of
its superordinate event. For lexical resources, we
use the dictionary of Japanese functional expres-
sions (Matsuyoshi et al., 2007) and the dictionary
of Japanese clue expressions for extended modal-
ity (Eguchi et al., 2010). This paper presents a
ﬁrst comprehensive investigation in Japanese fac-
tuality analysis, which is based on these sufﬁcient
lexicons.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes related work. In Section 3, we construct
a Japanese factuality analyzer based on composi-
tional approach by Saur´ı and Pustejovsky (2012).
In Section 4, we discuss issues regarding lexical
knowledge through error analysis by applying our
analyzer with Japanese text. Based on the analy-
sis in Section 4, Section 5 discusses lexicon-based
scope detection. Section 6 concludes this paper.

2 Related work
Previous work for an annotation schema of fac-
tuality and other associated information includes
FactBank (Saur´ı and Pustejovsky, 2009), Japanese
corpus with extended modality (Matsuyoshi et al.,
2010), and so on. Saur´ı and Pustejovsky annotate
event mentions with its source, epistemic modal-
ity (certainty) and polarity for representing the
event factuality. Additionally, their FactBank is
extended with pragmatically informed factuality
judgments by de Marneffe et al. (2012). Mat-
suyoshi et al. mark up an event mention with seven
components (source, time, conditional, primary
modality type, actuality, evaluation, and focus).
Our factuality corresponds to actuality. Tanaka et
al. (2013) annotate the sense and usage of ambigu-
ous expressions related to factuality.

For automatically analyzing factuality in text,
there are approaches based on machine learning.

Inui et al. (2008) have proposed a method of an-
alyzing modality and polarity of event mentions
in Japanese text with an approach based on con-
ditional random ﬁeld. However, it is very difﬁ-
cult that their machine learning-based models pre-
cisely identify the minority classes.

There are also approaches based on rules. Mac-
Cartney and Manning (2009) have proposed a
model of natural logic, which has focused on se-
mantic containment and monotonicity. They also
infers implicatives and factives based on implica-
tion signatures (Nairn et al., 2006) composition-
ally. But certainty is not considered in their ap-
proach. Saur´ı and Pustejovsky (2012) have pro-
posed a rule-based method using information that
can inﬂuence the factuality of events such as po-
larity particles, modality markers, and epistemic
predicates.
In their algorithm, factuality values
of the event, consisting of certainty and polarity,
are determined by the upper factuality values and
rules, one by one, from the top of the dependency
tree. Their model is suitable as it assumes the
availability of a factuality lexicon and uses it to
identify the factuality status of each subordinate
event in a compositional manner from the factual-
ity status of its superordinate event. So we adopt
their model and adapt it to the Japanese language
to discuss issues regarding lexical knowledge.

3 Japanese factuality analyzer
To discuss the problems about lexical knowledge,
we construct a Japanese factuality analyzer based
on the lexicon-based compositional approach pro-
posed by Saur´ı and Pustejovsky (2012). Their
analyzer is suitable for analyzing issues because
it
is based on the availability of a factuality-
related simple lexicon and analogous lexicons for
Japanese are also available. When we input a re-
sult of syntactic parsing to our factuality analyzer,
it outputs the factuality of each event.

3.1 Factuality values
Saur´ı and Pustejovsky characterized a degree of
event factuality as a pair of certainty (what is cer-
tain vs what is only possible) and polarity (posi-
tive vs negative). They divided the certainty axis
into the values certain (CT), probable (PR), pos-
sible (PS) and underspeciﬁed (U), and the polarity
axis into positive (+), negative (−) and underspec-
iﬁed (u). For example, an event “de” (leave) in
(1a) is labeled with CT+. This means that it is
certain that the event happened or will happen ac-
cording to the author of the text. In the same way,

an event “kaet” (go home) in (1b) is labeled with
PR+ and “hassei-suru” (occurrence) in (1c) is la-
beled with CT−. We use Saur´ı and Pustejovsky’s
factuality values; however, we make some changes
to compensate for Japanese sentences.

The ﬁrst is the distinction between PR and PS.
In English, event factuality can be interpreted by
speciﬁc expressions. For instance, PR is inter-
preted by probable and PS is interpreted by pos-
sible. However, in Japanese, it is not so straight-
forward to distinguish between PR and PS due to
a diverse variety of modality expressions. Further-
more, PR and PS are minority classes. We there-
fore combine PR and PS into PR in order to focus
on the distinction between certain and uncertain.
The second is underspeciﬁed values. Saur´ı and
Pustejovsky used two underspeciﬁed values: the
partially underspeciﬁed CTu and the fully under-
speciﬁed Uu. For simpliﬁcation, we do not distin-
guish two underspeciﬁed values. Instead we use U
as the underspeciﬁed value.

Furthermore, in the present study, we start with
focusing only on event factuality attributed to the
author of the text. Analyzing factuality for other
discourse participants is left for our future work.

We use Saur´ı and Pustejovsky’s factuality val-
ues except for these changes.
In other words,
we divide the certainty axis into the values cer-
tain (CT), probable (PR) and underspeciﬁed (U),
and we also divide the polarity axis into posi-
tive (+) and negative (−). Table 1 shows factuality
values by a combination of certainty and polarity.

3.2 Lexical knowledge
In Saur´ı and Pustejovsky’s model, the factuality is
analyzed based on lexical knowledge, expressions
(called factuality markers) that can inﬂuence the
event factuality. For example, polarity particles of
negation, such as the adverb not, switch the orig-
inal polarity of its context, and particles of cer-
tainty, such as the auxiliary may, change the origi-
nal certainty of its context. Saur´ı and Pustejovsky
consider not only particles but also predicates. For
instance, in the case of the expression know that,
it presupposes that the event in that-clause is fac-

tual. Therefore, the predicate know is a factuality
marker which changes the factuality of the event
in that-clause into CT+.

Similarly, in Japanese, some expressions cor-
respond to English factuality markers. We use
the dictionary of Japanese functional expres-
sions (Matsuyoshi et al., 2007) and the dictionary
of Japanese clue expressions for extended modal-
ity (Eguchi et al., 2010) as factuality markers.

The dictionary of Japanese functional expres-
sions is semantically categorized and contains a lot
of functional expressions using a hierarchy with
nine abstraction levels such as sense and grammat-
ical function. This dictionary includes 341 direc-
tion words (16,711 expressions). We can use some
categories as factuality markers. Table 2 shows ex-
ample entries of this dictionary and corresponding
effects on factuality. For instance, expressions cat-
egorized as speculation, such as “-daro-u” (may)
seen in (1b), change the original certainty of its
context. We use 5,345 expressions selected ac-
cording to categories as factuality markers.

The dictionary of Japanese clue expressions for
extended modality contains how predicates inﬂu-
ence extended modality of surrounding events.
This dictionary includes 8,122 predicates se-
lected from Bunrui Goihyo (National Institute for
Japanese Language and Linguistics, 2004). These
predicates also relate to the factuality. Therefore,
we can use these predicates as factuality markers.
Table 3 shows example entries of this dictionary
and corresponding factuality. For example, the
predicate “fusei-da” (prevented), seen in (1c), is
regarded as the factuality marker that switches the
polarity of the preceding event “hassei-suru” (oc-
currence).

3.3 Algorithm
The factuality analyzer determines an event factu-
ality by propagating a pair of certainty and polar-
ity along a dependency tree from the root of the
sentence. The algorithm can reﬂect dependency
between events by the propagation of the factual-
ity. The algorithm determines the factuality of an
event based on following components:

Predicates

The factuality is updated by predicates of its
context.

Functional Expressions

The factuality is updated by functional ex-
pressions attached to the event.

Propagated Factuality

The factuality is determined based on the
original factuality of the preceding event.

Figure 1 shows the analysis process when our
algorithm is applied to (2). The input is the de-
pendency tree of the sentence (2) (the left side of
Figure 1) and the output is the factuality of each
event (the right side of Figure 1).
(2) 彼が出場を断念したことを相手は知らない。

kare-ga shutsujou-wo dannen-shi-ta-koto-wo aite-wa
shira-nai.
(The opponent does not know that he had abandoned
the participation.)

First of all, the factuality at the top level is set to
CT+ as initial value (by the na¨ıve assumption), and

the factuality is propagated along a dependency
tree from the root of the sentence. The process
at each phrase consists of 3 steps.

As a ﬁrst step, the analyzer updates the contex-
tual factuality if the functional expression is found
in the dictionary of Japanese functional expres-
sions. For the ﬁrst phrase “shira-nai” (does not
know) in this example, the contextual factuality is
updated to CT− by the negation “-nai” (not). As a
second step, the factuality value is assigned to ev-
ery found event. The factuality value CT− is as-
signed to the event “shira” (know) in the example.
As a third step, the analyzer updates if the predi-
cate is found in the dictionary of Japanese clue ex-
pressions for extended modality. In the example,
the contextual factuality is updated to CT+ by the
factive predicate “shira” (know).
In referring to
dictionaries in ﬁrst and third steps, we adopt sim-
ple longest match for the surface. The third step
needs to be performed after the second step due
to the double nature of predicates, which are both
event-denoting expressions and, at the same time,
factuality markers.

Similarly, for the phrase “dannen-shi-ta” (had
abandoned), the algorithm outputs CT+ as the fac-
tuality of the event “dannen-shi” (abondon), be-
cause of Propagated Factuality CT− (the factual-
ity of the preceding event “shira” (know)), Pred-
icates “shira” (know) (CT− → CT+) and Func-
tional Expressions (empty for this case). The ana-
lyzer iterates the propagation and updates the con-

4 Findings from empirical evaluation
4.1 Data and experimental setup
We apply our algorithm to 6,404 sentences on the
Yahoo! Japan Q&A section for the Japanese cor-
pus with extended modality (Matsuyoshi et al.,
2010). These sentences are included in the Bal-
anced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese
(BCCWJ)1, and each event mention is labeled with
extended modality (source, time, conditional, pri-
mary modality type, actuality, evaluation, and fo-
cus). Actuality denotes the degree of certainty and
corresponds to our factuality. Table 2 shows the
correspondence of actuality to our factuality.

In this experiment, we apply our algorithm
to 11,395 event mentions, where source is “wr”
(writer of the sentence). These event mentions are
also selected by part-of-speech, such as verb and
adjective. For the identiﬁcation of the event men-
tion, we give the gold data to the analyzer because
we discuss only about lexical knowledge.

If the analyzer makes an error in regards to the
factuality of an event, then this error will have an
inﬂuence on the factuality of the next event, be-
cause the analyzer propagates the updated factual-
ity to the next event. Our intent for this experiment
is not to analyze this kind of error. Therefore, we
use the gold label as Propagated Factuality in or-
der to prevent the error propagation.

tional expressions at matrix clauses. At subordi-
nate clauses, on the other hand, we expect com-
plex issues involving multiple components. We
therefore analyze both the issues at matrix clauses
and the issues at subordinate clauses, respectively.
Table 5 shows accuracy and Tables 6-9 show
each confusion matrices for the certainty axis and
the polarity axis for each case. These tables show
that minority classes PR and U are difﬁcult on the
certainty axis. On the polarity axis, we obtain rel-
atively high accuracy. Comparing matrix clauses
to subordinate clauses, accuracy at subordinate
clauses, which is based on some components, is
lower than the accuracy at matrix clauses, which
is based only on functional expressions. For each
minority label (PR and U on the certainty axis, and
− on the polarity axis), subordinate clauses have
lower precision relative to matrix clauses. One
reason for this is that we do not consider the scope
of negation and speculation.

matrix clauses, the issue regarding functional ex-
pressions is found for 106 errors when analyz-
ing 108 errors, and the rest of errors are due to
an adverb and the parsing error. At subordinate
clauses, we analyze 1,041 errors. Issues regard-
ing the functional expressions (428 errors), pred-
icates (38 errors), and the scope (656 errors) are
found. Some errors are due to multiple issues. In
the following paragraphs, we describe these issues
in detail.

4.2.1 Functional expressions
Out of the 106 errors for functional expressions,
53 false-positive errors regarding U were most
common. Almost all of these errors are due to se-
mantic ambiguity for functional expressions.

(3) 知らないのも不思議ではないです。

shira-nai-no-mo fushigi-de-wa-nai-desu.
(It is no wonder that he doesn’t know.)
(Gold: CT−, System output: U)

(3) is an example for semantic ambiguity of the
functional expressions. Our analyzer refers to
dictionaries by simple longest match. Therefore,
the factuality of the event “fushigi” (wonder) is
wrongly assigned as U because “-de-wa” is rec-
ognized as a recommendation (how about). In this
context, the expression “-de-wa” is a part of inﬂec-
tion. So it has no special meaning.

As seen above, semantic ambiguity for func-
tional expressions
is a critical problem for
Japanese factuality analysis. But disambiguation
of Japanese functional expressions is not simple.
Some previous work is engaged on this task, such
as Tanaka et al. (2013). They construct MCN cor-
pus for the disambiguation of expressions related
to factuality. It is important to import this line of
prior work to our analyzer.

Coverage for the dictionary of Japanese func-
tional expressions also becomes a problem. How-
ever, the number of problems contains only 4 er-
rors. We ﬁnd that coverage for the dictionary of
Japanese functional expressions is sufﬁcient.

4.2.2 Predicates
At subordinate clauses, 38 errors arise which are
caused by predicate issues. 34 of the 38 errors are
due to insufﬁcient coverage for predicates and the
other 4 errors are due to semantic ambiguity for
predicates.

(4) 正しいことを確認してください。

tadashii koto-wo kakunin-shi-te-kudasai.
(Please check that it is correct.)
(Gold: CT+, System output: U)

(4) is an example of insufﬁcient coverage for pred-
icates. In (4), our algorithm assigns U as the fac-
tuality of the event “tadashii” (correct) because U
(the factuality of the event “kakunin-shi” (check),
which is inﬂuenced by the request expression “ku-
dasai” (please)) is propagated without any update.
However, the predicate “kakunin-shi” (check) pre-
supposes that the preceding context is factual, so
it should be assigned CT+ as the factuality of the
event “tadashii” (correct). This incorrect assign-
ment occurs because that predicate does not exist
in the dictionary of Japanese clue expressions for
extended modality.

Out of 1,041 errors at subordinate clauses, 417
events are that predicates in the dictionary of
Japanese clue expressions for extended modality
are used. Only 4 errors, however, are due to se-
mantic ambiguity for predicates. We therefore ﬁnd
that semantic ambiguity for predicates poses little
problem. Furthermore, we focus on correct events
by predicates. Out of the 1,128 correct instances
in the area analyzed by the corpus, 351 are correct
by predicates in the dictionary. In contrast to this,
only 34 errors are due to insufﬁcient coverage for
predicates. For this reason, we ﬁnd that insufﬁ-
cient coverage for predicates is a small issue.

4.2.3 Scope
In Section 3, we described that our analyzer de-
termines the event factuality based on three com-
ponents: Predicates, Functional Expressions, and
Propagated Factuality. However, we ﬁnd that it

593

is crucial to determine boundaries whether the an-
alyzer should propagate the factuality.
In other
words, it should resolve the scope of negation and
speculation though the actual analyzer regards all
embedded contexts as the scope. The errors due
to the scope, in fact, are the majority of errors at
subordinate clauses (656/1,041).

(Gold: CT+, System output: CT−)

Our algorithm wrongly assigns − as the polar-
ity of the event “deru” (leave) in (5). This is
because − (the polarity of the event “kikitore”
(hear), which is inﬂuenced by the negation “-n”
(cannot)) is propagated with no update. The nega-
tion “-n” (cannot) denies only the event “kikitore”
(hear) but not the event “deru” (leave). As exem-
pliﬁed, the issue regarding the scope of negation
and speculation is very crucial.
Of the 233 events where the analyzer outputs
− as the polarity and the gold Propagated Factu-
ality is −, 28 events are correct for the polarity,
whereas 112 events are errors due to the scope. As
shown, there are many cases where the analyzer
should not propagate due to scope, and there are
also many cases where the analyzer should prop-
agate as −. We ﬁnd that resolving the scope is a
signiﬁcant, but difﬁcult challenge.

Next, we focus on the conjunction particles,
such as “-to” in (5), as the key to detect scope in
practice. Out of 656 errors due to the scope, the
conjunction particle “-to” follows 126 events, “-
ga” follows 78 events, “-te” follows 70 events, and
so on. Therefore, when we detect scope in prac-
tice, we assume to use conjunctive particles as the
key to determine propagation boundaries. In the
next section, we investigate scope detection based
on such expressions.
5 Lexicon-based scope detection
In the previous section, we found that detecting a
scope is very crucial.
In this section, we inves-
tigate the limitation of the lexical knowledge for
a scope and identify the technical research issues
more precisely through experiments for rule-based
scope detection.

5.1 Related work for scope detection
In recent years,
the detection of negation
and speculation scopes is intensively being re-
search for English (Szarvas et al., 2008; Apos-
tolova et al., 2011),
such as Shared Task

in CoNLL-2010 (Farkas et al., 2010) and
*SEM 2012 (Morante and Blanco, 2012). For
example,
the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al.,
2008) is annotated with negation and modality ex-
pressions with their scope, and it is extensively
used for resolution of the scope. However, stud-
ies for the detection for scope are insufﬁcient for
Japanese. Detection of scope in Japanese is a sig-
niﬁcant challenge, and will be highly beneﬁcial for
Japanese factuality analysis.

5.2 Knowledge-based scope detection
We take a rule-based scope detection approach to
block propagating a contextual factuality. Before
the ﬁrst step on each phrase as described in Sec-
tion 3, this approach blocks the propagation when
the speciﬁc expressions are found in the event.
The approach then assigns the contextual factual-
ity as initial value CT+ and restarts the propaga-
tion. When such expressions are not found, the
propagation is not blocked.

We used the terms shown in Table 11 to de-
tect such expressions. When one of the terms ap-
pears at the end of an event, the event blocks the
propagation. The terms are categorized by Mi-
nami (1974) according to the intensities of the
constructing subordinate clauses: A is high, C is
low and B is intermediate. These intensities would
be used as a tendency of blocking the propagation.
However, because there are some ambiguities such
as “〜て” (-te) which belongs to all categories, we
used all terms to detect scope and block the prop-
agation.

In
the previous experiments as described in Sec-
tion 4, in order to avoid the propagation error, we
used gold contextual factuality. However, in our
experiment, we focus on the propagation, so we
do not use gold contextual factuality.

Table 12 shows that F1-score increases 19.2%
(0.112) by adding lexical knowledge. Focusing on
each labels, our approach had no negative effect
except recall of U. This means that our approach
based on lexical knowledge works well, especially
for minor labels. However, some errors still re-
main.

5.4 Remaining issues
We identify the remaining issues through the er-
ror analysis of the result. We focus on the

events which have a propagated factuality; in other
words, it is not the last event of the sentence. In
addition, the events whose propagated factuality
is CT+ are also excluded from the analysis target,
because when a CT+ is propagated to an event,
even if the event blocks or doesn’t block the CT+,
the propagated factuality to the ﬁrst step is CT+.

There are 1,739 events which satisfy the above
conditions and we apply the block rule to 925 of
them (i.e. some terms in Table 11 are found in the
events). Table 13 shows the changes in the number
of correct and incorrect results by adding the lex-
ical knowledge. When using the block rule, 553
out of 925 incorrect events become correct. On
the other hand, 100 of the correct events became
incorrect. This suggests some ambiguities of ex-
pressions caused too much blocking.

For example, “〜て” (-te) in (6a) causes blocking
but in (6b) should not cause blocking.

Focusing on the coverage of the lexical knowl-
edge, as described in Section 4, there are 656 er-
rors due to the error of scope detection. 402 of
them do not have CT+ as the propagated factuality
and all of them should block the factuality prop-
agation. However, only 229 of 402 blocked the
propagation. This shows that the coverage of the
lexical knowledge is still limited.

For example, “〜では” (-de-wa) in (7) is not cov-

6 Conclusion

We described Japanese factuality analysis, which
is useful for information extraction and textual en-
tailment recognition, among others. We discussed
issues regarding lexical knowledge through error
analysis by using a Japanese factuality analyzer
based on lexical knowledge and compositional-
ity. As a result, coverage of existing lexical re-
sources is sufﬁcient but issues regarding the se-
mantic ambiguity of functional expressions and is-
sues regarding scope were found.
In particular,
it was revealed that the problem regarding scope
is most signiﬁcant. We therefore performed an
additional experiment with lexical knowledge for
scope and discussed its helpfulness. However, the
issue regarding scope includes the issue by pro-
found meaning and context. Therefore, we con-
sider that this issue is high-priority challenge.

In the future, we will address these challenges
toward a high-performance Japanese factuality an-
alyzer with other lexical knowledge and linguistic
phenomena. Furthermore, we aim to construct a
Japanese modality analyzer through the extension
of the framework for factuality.
