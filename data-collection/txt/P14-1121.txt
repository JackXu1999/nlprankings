Abstract

The main work in bilingual lexicon ex-
traction from comparable corpora is based
on the implicit hypothesis that corpora are
balanced. However, the historical context-
based projection method dedicated to this
task is relatively insensitive to the sizes
of each part of the comparable corpus.
Within this context, we have carried out
a study on the influence of unbalanced
specialized comparable corpora on the
quality of bilingual terminology extraction
through different experiments. Moreover,
we have introduced a regression model
that boosts the observations of word co-
occurrences used in the context-based pro-
jection method. Our results show that the
use of unbalanced specialized comparable
corpora induces a significant gain in the
quality of extracted lexicons.

1 Introduction

The bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilin-
gual corpora was initially addressed by using par-
allel corpora (i.e. a corpus that contains source
texts and their translation). However, despite
good results in the compilation of bilingual lex-
icons, parallel corpora are scarce resources, es-
pecially for technical domains and for language
pairs not involving English. For these reasons,
research in bilingual lexicon extraction has fo-
cused on another kind of bilingual corpora com-
prised of texts sharing common features such as
domain, genre, sampling period, etc. without hav-
ing a source text/target text relationship (McEnery
and Xiao, 2007). These corpora, well known now
as comparable corpora, have also initially been
introduced as non-parallel corpora (Fung, 1995;
Rapp, 1995), and non-aligned corpora (Tanaka
and Iwasaki, 1996). According to Fung and Che-

ung (2004), who range bilingual corpora from par-
allel corpora to quasi-comparable corpora going
through comparable corpora, there is a continuum
from parallel to comparable corpora (i.e. a kind of
filiation).

The bilingual lexicon extraction task from com-
parable corpora inherits this filiation. For instance,
the historical context-based projection method
(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995), known as the standard
approach, dedicated to this task seems implicitly
to lead to work with balanced comparable corpora
in the same way as for parallel corpora (i.e. each
part of the corpus is composed of the same amount
of data).

In this paper we want to show that the assump-
tion that comparable corpora should be balanced
for bilingual lexicon extraction task is unfounded.
Moreover, this assumption is prejudicial for spe-
cialized comparable corpora, especially when in-
volving the English language for which many doc-
uments are available due the prevailing position
of this language as a standard for international
scientific publications. Within this context, our
main contribution consists in a re-reading of the
standard approach putting emphasis on the un-
founded assumption of the balance of the spe-
cialized comparable corpora. In specialized do-
mains, the comparable corpora are traditionally of
small size (around 1 million words) in comparison
with comparable corpus-based general language
(up to 100 million words). Consequently, the ob-
servations of word co-occurrences which is the ba-
sis of the standard approach are unreliable. To
make them more reliable, our second contribution
is to contrast different regression models in order
to boost the observations of word co-occurrences.
This strategy allows to improve the quality of ex-
tracted bilingual lexicons from comparable cor-
pora.

2 Bilingual Lexicon Extraction

In this section, we first describe the standard ap-
proach that deals with the task of bilingual lexi-
con extraction from comparable corpora. We then
present an extension of this approach based on re-
gression models. Finally, we discuss works related
to this study.

2.1 Standard Approach
The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction
from comparable corpora is based on lexical con-
text analysis and relies on the simple observation
that a word and its translation tend to appear in
the same lexical contexts. The basis of this obser-
vation consists in the identification of “first-order
affinities” for each source and target language:
“First-order affinities describe what other words
are likely to be found in the immediate vicinity
of a given word” (Grefenstette, 1994, p. 279).
These affinities can be represented by context vec-
tors, and each vector element represents a word
which occurs within the window of the word to
be translated (e.g. a seven-word window approxi-
mates syntactic dependencies). In order to empha-
size significant words in the context vector and to
reduce word-frequency effects, the context vectors
are normalized according to an association mea-
sure. Then, the translation is obtained by compar-
ing the source context vector to each translation
candidate vector after having translated each ele-
ment of the source vector with a general dictio-
nary.

The implementation of the standard approach
can be carried out by applying the following
three steps (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum,
2002; Déjean et al., 2002; Morin et al., 2007;
Laroche and Langlais, 2010, among others):

Computing context vectors We collect all the
words in the context of each word i and count
their occurrence frequency in a window of
n words around i. For each word i of the
source and the target languages, we obtain
a context vector vi which gathers the set of
co-occurrence words j associated with the
number of times that j and i occur together
cooc(i, j). In order to identify specific words
in the lexical context and to reduce word-
frequency effects, we normalize context vec-
tors using an association score such as Mu-
tual Information, Log-likelihood, or the dis-
counted log-odds (LO) (Evert, 2005) (see

equation 1 and Table 1 where N = a + b +
c + d).

Transferring context vectors Using a bilingual
dictionary, we translate the elements of the
source context vector. If the bilingual dictio-
nary provides several translations for an ele-
ment, we consider all of them but weight the
different translations according to their fre-
quency in the target language.

Finding candidate translations For a word to be
translated, we compute the similarity be-
tween the translated context vector and all
target vectors through vector distance mea-
sures such as Jaccard or Cosine (see equa-
tion 2 where associj stands for “association
score”, vk is the transferred context vector of
the word k to translate, and vl is the con-
text vector of the word l in the target lan-
guage). Finally, the candidate translations of
a word are the target words ranked following
the similarity score.

j ¬j
i a = cooc(i, j) b = cooc(i,¬j)
¬i c = cooc(¬i, j) d = cooc(¬i,¬j)

Table 1: Contingency table

LO(i, j) = log
(a + 12)× (d + 12)
(b + 12)× (c + 12)

This approach is sensitive to the choice of pa-
rameters such as the size of the context, the choice
of the association and similarity measures. The
most complete study about the influence of these
parameters on the quality of word alignment has
been carried out by Laroche and Langlais (2010).

The standard approach is used by most re-
searchers so far (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1998; Pe-
ters and Picchi, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and
Zweigenbaum, 2002; Déjean et al., 2002; Gaussier
et al., 2004; Morin et al., 2007; Laroche and
Langlais, 2010; Prochasson and Fung, 2011;

Table 2: Characteristics of the comparable corpora used for bilingual lexicon extraction

Bouamor et al., 2013, among others) with the im-
plicit hypothesis that comparable corpora are bal-
anced. As McEnery and Xiao (2007, p. 21) ob-
serve, a specialized comparable corpus is built
as balanced by analogy with a parallel corpus:
“Therefore, in relation to parallel corpora, it is
more likely for comparable corpora to be designed
as general balanced corpora.”. For instance, Ta-
ble 2 describes the comparable corpora used in the
main work dedicated to bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion for which the ratio between the size of the
source and the target texts is comprised between
1 and 1.8.

In fact, the assumption that words which have
the same meaning in different languages should
have the same lexical context distributions does
not involve working with balanced comparable
corpora. To our knowledge, no attention1 has
been paid to the problem of using unbalanced
comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion. Since the context vectors are computed from
each part of the comparable corpus rather than
through the parts of the comparable corpora, the
standard approach is relatively insensitive to dif-
ferences in corpus sizes. The only precaution for
using the standard approach with unbalanced cor-
pora is to normalize the association measure (for
instance, this can be done by dividing each entry
of a given context vector by the sum of its associ-
ation scores).

2.2 Prediction Model

Since comparable corpora are usually small in spe-
cialized domains (see Table 2), the discrimina-

1We only found mention of this aspect in Diab and Finch
(2000, p. 1501) “In principle, we do not have to have the
same size corpora in order for the approach to work”.

tive power of context vectors (i.e. the observa-
tions of word co-occurrences) is reduced. One
way to deal with this problem is to re-estimate
co-occurrence counts by a prediction function
(Hazem and Morin, 2013). This consists in as-
signing to each observed co-occurrence count of
a small comparable corpora, a new value learned
beforehand from a large training corpus.

In order to make co-occurrence counts more
discriminant and in the same way as Hazem
and Morin (2013), one strategy consists in ad-
dressing this problem through regression: given
training corpora of small and large size (abun-
dant in the general domain), we predict word co-
occurrence counts in order to make them more
reliable. We then apply the resulting regression
function to each word co-occurrence count as a
pre-processing step of the standard approach. Our
work differs from Hazem and Morin (2013) in two
ways. First, while they experienced the linear re-
gression model, we propose to contrast different
regression models. Second, we apply regression
to unbalanced comparable corpora and study the
impact of prediction when applied to the source
texts, the target texts and both source and target
texts of the used comparable corpora.

We use regression analysis to describe the rela-
tionship between word co-occurrence counts in a
large corpus (the response variable) and word co-
occurrence counts in a small corpus (the predictor
variable). As most regression models have already
been described in great detail (Christensen, 1997;
Agresti, 2007), the derivation of most models is
only briefly introduced in this work.

As we can not claim that the prediction of word
co-occurrence counts is a linear problem, we con-
sider in addition to the simple linear regression

1286



model (Lin), a generalized linear model which is
the logistic regression model (Logit) and non lin-
ear regression models such as polynomial regres-
sion model (Polyn) of order n. Given an input
vector x ∈ Rm, where x1,...,xm represent fea-
tures, we find a prediction ŷ ∈ Rm for the co-
occurrence count of a couple of words y ∈ R us-
ing one of the regression models presented below:

ŷLin = β0 + β1x (3)

ŷLogit =
1

1 + exp(−(β0 + β1x)) (4)

ŷPolyn = β0 + β1x + β2x2 + ... + βnxn (5)

where βi are the parameters to estimate.
Let us denote by f the regression function and

by cooc(wi, wj) the co-occurrence count of the
words wi and wj . The resulting predicted value of
cooc(wi, wj), noted ˆcooc(wi, wj) is given by the
following equation:

ˆcooc(wi, wj) = f(cooc(wi, wj)) (6)

2.3 Related Work
In the past few years, several contributions have
been proposed to improve each step of the stan-
dard approach.

Prochasson et al. (2009) enhance the represen-
tativeness of the context vector by strengthening
the context words that happen to be transliterated
words and scientific compound words in the target
language. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) also sug-
gest that context vectors should be based on the
most important contextually relevant words (in-
domain terms), and thus propose a method for fil-
tering the noise of the context vectors. In another
way, Rubino and Linarès (2011) improve the con-
text words based on the hypothesis that a word and
its candidate translations share thematic similari-
ties. Yu and Tsujii (2009) and Otero (2007) pro-
pose, for their part, to replace the window-based
method by a syntax-based method in order to im-
prove the representation of the lexical context.

To improve the transfer context vectors step,
and increase the number of elements of translated
context vectors, Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2003)
and Morin and Prochasson (2011) combine a stan-
dard general language dictionary with a special-
ized dictionary, whereas Déjean et al. (2002) use

the hierarchical properties of a specialized the-
saurus. Koehn and Knight (2002) automatically
induce the initial seed bilingual dictionary by us-
ing identical spelling features such as cognates
and similar contexts. As regards the problem of
words ambiguities, Bouamor et al. (2013) carried
out word sense disambiguation process only in
the target language whereas Gaussier et al. (2004)
solve the problem through the source and target
languages by using approaches based on CCA
(Canonical Correlation Analysis) and multilingual
PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis).

The rank of candidate translations can be im-
proved by integrating different heuristics. For in-
stance, Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) introduce
a heuristic based on word distribution symme-
try. From the ranked list of candidate translations,
the standard approach is applied in the reverse
direction to find the source counterparts of the
first target candidate translations. And then only
the target candidate translations that had the ini-
tial source word among the first reverse candidate
translations are kept. Laroche and Langlais (2010)
suggest a heuristic based on the graphic similarity
between source and target terms. Here, candidate
translations which are cognates of the word to be
translated are ranked first among the list of trans-
lation candidates.

3 Linguistic Resources

In this section, we outline the different textual re-
sources used for our experiments: the comparable
corpora, the bilingual dictionary and the terminol-
ogy reference lists.

3.1 Specialized Comparable Corpora

For our experiments, we used two specialized
French/English comparable corpora:

Breast cancer corpus This comparable corpus is
composed of documents collected from the
Elsevier website2. The documents were taken
from the medical domain within the sub-
domain of “breast cancer”. We have auto-
matically selected the documents published
between 2001 and 2008 where the title or the
keywords contain the term cancer du sein in
French and breast cancer in English. We col-
lected 130 French documents (about 530,000
words) and 1,640 English documents (about

2http://www.elsevier.com

1287



7.4 million words). We split the English doc-
uments into 14 parts each containing about
530,000 words.

Diabetes corpus The documents making up the
French part of the comparable corpus have
been craweled from the web using three
keywords: diabète (diabetes), alimentation
(food), and obésité (obesity). After a man-
ual selection, we only kept the documents
which were relative to the medical domain.
As a result, 65 French documents were ex-
tracted (about 257,000 words). The English
part has been extracted from the medical
website PubMed3 using the keywords: dia-
betes, nutrition and feeding. We only kept
the free fulltext available documents. As a re-
sult, 2,339 English documents were extracted
(about 3,5 million words). We also split the
English documents into 14 parts each con-
taining about 250,000 words.

The French and English documents were then
normalised through the following linguistic pre-
processing steps: tokenisation, part-of-speech tag-
ging, and lemmatisation. These steps were car-
ried out using the TTC TermSuite4 that applies
the same method to several languages including
French and English. Finally, the function words
were removed and the words occurring less than
twice in the French part and in each English part
were discarded. Table 3 shows the number of dis-
tinct words (# words) after these steps. It also
indicates the comparability degree in percentage
(comp.) between the French part and each English
part of each comparable corpus. The comparabil-
ity measure (Li and Gaussier, 2010) is based on
the expectation of finding the translation for each
word in the corpus and gives a good idea about
how two corpora are comparable. We can notice
that all the comparable corpora have a high degree
of comparability with a better comparability of the
breast cancer corpora as opposed to the diabetes
corpora. In the remainder of this article, [breast
cancer corpus i] for instance stands for the breast
cancer comparable corpus composed of the unique
French part and the English part i (i ∈ [1, 14]).
3.2 Bilingual Dictionary

tains only a few terms related to the medical do-
main.

3.3 Terminology Reference Lists
To evaluate the quality of terminology extrac-
tion, we built a bilingual terminology reference
list for each comparable corpus. We selected
all French/English single words from the UMLS6

meta-thesaurus. We kept only i) the French sin-
gle words which occur more than four times in the
French part and ii) the English single words which
occur more than four times in each English part
i7. As a result of filtering, 169 French/English
single words were extracted for the breast can-
cer corpus and 244 French/English single words
were extracted for the diabetes corpus. It should
be noted that the evaluation of terminology ex-
traction using specialized comparable corpora of-

7The threshold sets to four is required to build a bilin-

gual terminology reference list composed of about a hundred
words. This value is very low to obtain representative context
vectors. For instance, Prochasson and Fung (2011) showed
that the standard approach is not relevant for infrequent words
(since the context vectors are very unrepresentative i.e. poor
in information).

4 Experiments and Results

In this section, we present experiments to evaluate
the influence of comparable corpus size and pre-
diction models on the quality of bilingual termi-
nology extraction.

We present the results obtained for the terms be-
longing to the reference list for English to French
direction measured in terms of the Mean Average

lows:

where |Ref | is the number of terms of the refer-
ence list and ri the rank of the correct candidate
translation i.

4.1 Standard Approach Evaluation
In order to evaluate the influence of corpus size on
the bilingual terminology extraction task, two ex-
periments have been carried out using the standard
approach. We first performed an experiment using
each comparable corpus independently of the oth-
ers (we refer to these corpora as balanced corpora).
We then conducted a second experiment where we
varied the size of the English part of the compara-
ble corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for
the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps,
and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the di-
abetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to
these corpora as unbalanced corpora). In the ex-
periments reported here, the size of the context
window w was set to 3 (i.e. a seven-word window

that approximates syntactic dependencies), the re-
tained association and similarity measures were
the discounted log-odds and the Cosine (see Sec-
tion 2.1). The results shown were those that give
the best performance for the comparable corpora
used individually.

Table 4 shows the results of the standard ap-
proach on the balanced and the unbalanced breast
cancer and diabetes comparable corpora. Each
column corresponds to the English part i (i ∈
[1, 14]) of a given comparable corpus. The first
line presents the results for each individual com-
parable corpus and the second line presents the re-
sults for the cumulative comparable corpus. For
instance, the column 3 indicates the MAP obtained
by using a comparable corpus that is composed i)
only of [breast cancer corpus 3] (MAP of 21.0%),
and ii) of [breast cancer corpus 1, 2 and 3] (MAP
of 34.7%).

As a preliminary remark, we can notice that the
results differ noticeably according to the compa-
rable corpus used individually (MAP variation be-
tween 21.0% and 29.6% for the breast cancer cor-
pora and between 10.5% and 16.5% for the dia-
betes corpora). We can also note that the MAP
of all the unbalanced comparable corpora is al-
ways higher than any individual comparable cor-
pus. Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as
provided by the balanced [breast cancer corpus 1],
we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the un-
balanced [breast cancer corpus 12] (the variation
observed for some unbalanced corpora such as
[diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14] can be explained
by the fact that adding more data in the source
language increases the error rate of the translation
phase of the standard approach, which leads to the
introduction of additional noise in the translated
context vectors).

4.2 Prediction Evaluation
The aim of this experiment is two-fold: first, we
want to evaluate the usefulness of predicting word
co-occurrence counts and second, we want to find
out whether it is more appropriate to apply predic-
tion to the source side, the target side or both sides
of the bilingual comparable corpora.

4.2.1 Regression Models Comparison
We contrast the prediction models presented in
Section 2.2 to findout which is the most appropri-
ate model to use as a pre-processing step of the
standard approach. We chose the balanced corpora
where the standard approach has shown the best
results in the previous experiment, namely [breast
cancer corpus 12] and [diabetes corpus 7].

Table 6 shows a comparison between the
standard approach without prediction noted No
prediction and the standard approach with pre-
diction models. We contrast the simple linear re-
gression model (Lin) with the second and the third
order polynomial regressions (Poly2 and Poly3)
and the logistic regression model (Logit). We

can notice that except for the Logit model, all the
regression models outperform the baseline (No
prediction). Also, as we can see, the results
obtained with the linear and polynomial regres-
sions are very close. This suggests that both linear
and polynomial regressions are suitable as a pre-
processing step of the standard approach, while
the logistic regression seems to be inappropriate
according to the results shown in Table 6.

That said, the gain of regression models is not
significant. This may be due to the regression pa-
rameters that have been learned from a training
corpus of the general domain. Another reason that
could explain these results is the prediction pro-
cess. We applied the same regression function
to all co-occurrence counts while learning mod-
els for low and high frequencies should have been
more appropriate. In the light of the above results,
we believe that prediction can be beneficial to our
task.

4.2.2 Source versus Target Prediction

Table 5 shows a comparison between the standard
approach without prediction noted No prediction
and the standard approach based on the predic-
tion of the source side noted Sourcepred, the tar-
get side noted Targetpred and both sides noted
Sourcepred+Targetpred. If prediction can not re-
place a large amount of data, it aims at increasing
co-occurrence counts as if large amounts of data
were at our disposal. In this case, applying pre-
diction to the source side may simulate a config-
uration of using unbalanced comparable corpora
where the source side is n times bigger than the
target side. Predicting the target side only, may

Figure 1: Results (MAP %) of the standard approach using the best configurations of the prediction
models (Lin for Balanced + Prediction and Poly2 for Unbalanced + Prediction) on the breast
cancer and the diabetes corpora

leads us to the opposite configuration where the
target side is n times bigger than the source side.
Finally, predicting both sides may simulate a large
comparable corpora on both sides. In this experi-
ment, we chose to use the linear regression model
(Lin) for the prediction part. That said, the other
regression models have shown the same behavior
as Lin.

We can see that the best results are obtained by
the Sourcepred approach for both comparable cor-
pora. We can also notice that predicting the tar-
get side and both sides of the comparable corpora
degrades the results. It is not surprising that pre-
dicting the target side only leads to lower results,
since it is well known that a better characterization
of a word to translate (given from the source side)
leads to better results. We can deduce from Ta-
ble 5 that source prediction is the most appropriate
configuration to improve the quality of extracted
lexicons. This configuration which simulates the
use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that
using prediction with unbalanced comparable cor-
pora should also increase the performance of the
standard approach. This assumption is evaluated
in the next Subsection.

4.3 Predicting Unbalanced Corpora

In this last experiment we contrast the standard
approach applied to the balanced and unbalanced
corpora noted Balanced and Unbalanced with
the standard approach combined with the predic-
tion model noted Balanced + Prediction and

Unbalanced + Prediction.
Figure 1(a) illustrates the results of the exper-

iments conducted on the breast cancer corpus.
We can see that the Unbalanced approach sig-
nificantly outperforms the baseline (Balanced).
The big difference between the Balanced and
the Unbalanced approaches would indicate that
the latter is optimal. We can also notice that the
prediction model applied to the balanced corpus
(Balanced + Prediction) slightly outperforms
the baseline while the Unbalanced+Prediction
approach significantly outperforms the three other
approaches (moreover the variation observed with
the Unbalanced approach are lower than the
Unbalanced + Prediction approach). Overall,
the prediction increases the performance of the
standard approach especially for unbalanced cor-
pora.

The results of the experiments conducted on
the diabetes corpus are shown in Figure 1(b). As
for the previous experiment, we can see that the
Unbalanced approach significantly outperforms
the Balanced approach. This confirms the unbal-
anced hypothesis and would motivate the use of
unbalanced corpora when they are available. We
can also notice that the Balanced + Prediction
approach slightly outperforms the baseline while
the Unbalanced+Prediction approach gives the
best results. Here also, the prediction increases the
performance of the standard approach especially
for unbalanced corpora. It is clear that in addi-
tion to the benefit of using unbalanced comparable

1291



corpora, prediction shows a positive impact on the
performance of the standard approach.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have studied how an unbalanced
specialized comparable corpus could influence the
quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction. This as-
pect represents a significant interest when working
with specialized comparable corpora for which the
quantity of the data collected may differ depend-
ing on the languages involved, especially when in-
volving the English language as many scientific
documents are available. More precisely, our dif-
ferent experiments show that using an unbalanced
specialized comparable corpus always improves
the quality of word translations. Thus, the MAP
goes up from 29.6% (best result on the balanced
corpora) to 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced
corpora) in the breast cancer domain, and from
16.5% to 26.0% in the diabetes domain. Addition-
ally, these results can be improved by using a pre-
diction model of the word co-occurrence counts.
Here, the MAP goes up from 42.3% (best result
on the unbalanced corpora) to 46.9% (best result
on the unbalanced corpora with prediction) in the
breast cancer domain, and from 26.0% to 29.8%
in the diabetes domain. We hope that this study
will pave the way for using specialized unbalanced
comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion.
