Abstract

Chinese and Spanish have different mor-
phology structures, which poses a big
challenge for translating between this pair
of languages. In this paper, we analyze
several strategies to better generalize from
the Chinese non-morphology-based lan-
guage to the Spanish rich morphology-
based language. Strategies use a first-step
of Spanish morphology-based simplifica-
tions and a second-step of fullform gen-
eration. The latter can be done using a
translation system or classification meth-
ods. Finally, both steps are combined ei-
ther by concatenation in cascade or inte-
gration using a factored-based style. On-
going experiments (based on the United
Nations corpus) and their results are de-
scribed.

1 Introduction

The structure of Chinese and Spanish differs at
most linguistic levels, e.g. morphology, syntax
and semantics. In this paper, we are focusing
on reducing the gap between both languages at
the level of morphology. On the one hand, Chi-
nese is an isolating language, which means hav-
ing a low morpheme per word ratio. On the other
hand, Spanish is a fusional language, which means
having a tendency to overlay many morphemes.
The challenge when translating between Chinese
and Spanish is bigger in the direction from Chi-
nese to Spanish, given that the same Chinese word
can generate multiple Spanish words. For exam-
ple, the Chinese word fàn (in transcribed Pinyin)
can be translated by comer, como, comı́, comeré1

which correspond to several tense flexions of the
same verb and also by comes, comiste, comerás2,

1to eat, I eat, I ate, I will eat
2you eat, you ate, you will eat

all of which also correspond to several person flex-
ions of the same verb. This poses a challenge
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) because
translations are learnt by co-ocurrence of words in
both languages. When a word has multiple transla-
tions, it generates sparsity in the translation model.

In this study, we experiment with different
strategies to add morphology knowledge in a stan-
dard phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al.,
2003) for the Chinese-to-Spanish translation di-
rection. However, the presented techniques could
be used for other pairs involving isolating and fu-
sional languages. The rest of the paper is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 reports a brief
overview of the related work both in using mor-
phology knowledge in SMT and in translating
from Chinese-to-Spanish. Section 3 explains the
theoretical framework of phrase-based SMT at a
high level and the details of each strategy to intro-
duce morphology in the mentioned system. Sec-
tion 4 describes the experiments and first results
obtained for each theoretical strategy presented.
Finally, Section 5 concludes this ongoing research
and outlines the future research directions.

2 Related Work

There are numerous studies which deal with mor-
phology in the field of SMT. Without aiming at
completeness, we cite works that:

• Preprocess the data to make the structure of
both languages more similar by means of en-
riching (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Ueffing
and Ney, 2003) or segmentation techniques in
agglutinative (S.Virpioja et al., 2007) or fu-
sional languages (Costa-jussà, 2015a)

• Modify models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007)
• Post-process the data (Toutanova et al., 2008;

Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011; Formiga et al.,
2013).

The research work in this area is being very ac-
tive, e.g. PhD proposals using strategies based on
deep learning (Gutierrez-Vasques, 2015).

Previous works on the Chinese-Spanish lan-
guage pair focus on compiling corpus and us-
ing pivot stategies (Costa-jussà et al., 2012) and
on building a Rule-Based Machine Translation
(RBMT) system (Costa-jussà and Centelles, In
Press 2015). A high-level description of the state-
of-the-art of the translation on this language pair
is detailed in (Costa-jussà, 2015b).

Our work mixes several strategies but basically
it goes in the direction of (Formiga et al., 2013)
that focuses on solving the challenge of mor-
phology as a post-processing classification prob-
lem. The idea is to translate from Chinese to a
morphology-based simplified Spanish and, then,
re-generate the morphology by means of classi-
fication algorithms. The competitive advantage
from this strategy is the rise of algorithms based
on deep learning techniques that can achieve high
success rates, e.g. (Collobert et al., 2011).

3 Theoretical Framework

The phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al.,
2003) is trained on a parallel corpus at the level of
sentences. It learns co-ocurrences and each token
in the training set is considered as a different one
no matter if it is morphologically related. There-
fore, in the extreme case where the word canto3

is in the training set and the inflection of the same
verb canté4 is not, the latter is going to be consid-
ered an out-of-vocabulary word.

Strategy 1. One well-known strategy to face this
challenge is to add a part-of-speech (POS) lan-
guage model which evaluates the probability of the
POS-sequences instead of the word sequences.

Strategy 2. This second strategy consists on do-
ing a cascade of systems: first, translate from
source to morphology-based simplified target; sec-
ond, translate from this simplified target to full-
form target as shown in Figure 3.

One straightforward simplification in morphol-
ogy can be adopting lemmas as shown in Table 1.

Strategy 3. This third strategy is based on
factored-based translation (Koehn and Hoang,
2007), which uses linguistic information of words,

3I sing
4I sang

e.g. lemmas and POS. The idea is that the trans-
lation model based on words is used if the trans-
lation of the word is available, and if not, lemmas
and POS are used in combination with a model to
generate the final word. Figure 3 shows a typical
representation of this factored strategy.

Figure 2: Illustration of the factored strategy.

Strategy 4. This fourth strategy is based on pre-
vious work like (Formiga et al., 2013), where the
idea is to do a first translation from source to
a morphology-based simplified target and then,
use a classifier to go from this simplified target
to the fullform target. See the schema of this
classification-based strategy in 3.

The main challenges in the last strategy are:

1. Explore different simplifications of the target
language in order to use the one with a higher
trade-off between the highest oracle and the
lowest classification complexity.

2. Explore several classification algorithms.

strategy.

In this paper, we study the first challenge of ex-
ploring different simplifications. However, we do
not face the classification challenge, which is left
to further work. It would be interesting to use deep
learning knowledge which is leading to large im-
provements in natural language processing (Col-
lobert et al., 2011).

4 Ongoing Experiments

In this section we show experiments and results
with the four strategies proposed in the previous
section.

As discussed in the literature, there are not
many parallel corpora available for Chinese-
Spanish (Costa-jussà et al., 2012). In this work,
we use the data set from the United Nations
(Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009). The training cor-
pus contains about 60,000 sentences (and around
2 million words) and the development and test cor-
pus contain 1,000 sentences each one. The base-

line system is standard phrase-based SMT trained
with Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), with the default
parameters.

Table 2 shows results for the strategies 1, 2 and
3 in terms of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). From
the BLEU scores, we see that strategy 1 gives
slight improvements, but strategies 2 and 3 do not.

Strategy System BLEU
Baseline 32.29

1 +LMpos 32.54
2 Cascade 31.80

Zh2Eslemmas 36.40
Eslemmas2Es 71.79

3 +Generation 32.11

Table 2: BLEU scores for Zh2Es translation task
and different morphology strategies.

Table 3 shows several oracles for strategy 4
with different morphology-based simplifications
of Spanish. Best oracles are for lemmas. Then, we
explore other simplifications, including lemmatiz-
ing only: nouns (N), verbs (V), determiners (D),
posesives (P) or adjectives (A). Non of these alter-
natives approach the best oracle from lemmatizing
all words.

However, the interesting results are obtained
when simplifying by number (num) and/or gen-
der (gen). When simplifying number or gender,
note that we use the information of lemmas and
tags. When generalizing number, note that instead
of using the information of singular (S) or plural
(P) in the POS tag with the respective S or P, we
use the generic N. Therefore, we generalize the in-
formation of number. Similarly when generalizing
gender or both (numgen).

Oracles get closer to the lemmas simplification
when only simplifying both number and gender in
Spanish. This finding is relevant in the sense that
it simplifies the classification task in the further
work that we are considering.

Table 3: Oracles for different generalizations. In
bold, the most interesting finding.

Table 1 shows examples of all simplifications
presented in previous Table 3. Note that simpli-
fications in number and gender use lemmas plus
POS tags to omit just the corresponding informa-
tion that will need to be recovered in the classifi-
cation stage.

5 Conclusions and Further Work

This paper presents an ongoing work on enhacing
a standard phrase-based SMT system by dealing
with morphology. We have reported several strate-
gies including adding POS language modeling, ex-
perimenting with cascade systems and factored-
based translation models. Only the first one re-
ported improvements over the baseline. An addi-
tional strategy consists of studying different Span-
ish simplifications and then, generating the full-
form with classification techniques. Experiments
show that simplification only in gender and num-
ber almost achieves improvements as good as the
simplification on lemmas. This is an interesting
result that reduces the level of complexity for the
classification task. As further work, we will use
classification techniques based on deep learning.
