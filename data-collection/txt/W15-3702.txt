Abstract

We present a quantitative study of the An-
nals of the Joseon Dynasty, the daily writ-
ten records of the five hundred years of a
monarchy in Korea. We first introduce the
corpus, which is a series of books describ-
ing the historical facts during the Joseon
dynasty. We then define three categories of
the monarchial ruling styles based on the
written records and compare the twenty-
five kings in the monarchy. Finally, we in-
vestigate how kings show different ruling
styles for various topics within the corpus.
Through this study, we introduce a very
unique corpus of monarchial records that
span an entire monarchy of five hundred
years and illustrate how text mining can
be applied to answer important historical
questions.

1 Introduction

Historical documents are usually studied qualita-
tively by researchers focusing on a close read-
ing of a small number of documents. However,
for a large corpus of historical texts, qualitative
methods have limitations, thus quantitative ap-
proaches have been introduced recently (Moretti,
2005; Jockers, 2013). There is also research in ap-
plying text mining and natural language process-
ing methods to identify patterns in a corpus of
large and longitudinal documents (Mimno, 2012).
In this paper, we introduce a unique corpus of his-
torical documents from the written records that
span almost five hundred years from the fourteenth
century up to the late nineteenth century within
the Korean peninsula. We apply text mining to this
corpus to show the power of a computational ap-
proach in answering historical questions.

We first introduce The Annals of the Joseon
Dynasty (Chunchugwan, 1863). Joseon is the last

monarchial nation in the Korean Peninsula from
its founding in 1392 up to 1910. The Annals of the
Joseon Dynasty are a series of books of historical
facts, recorded almost daily during the Joseon dy-
nasty. Whenever a king abdicated the throne, the
Chunchugwan (office for annals compilation) up-
dated the Annals for that king from all related offi-
cial and unofficial documents. The Annals contain
political, economic, social and cultural topics dur-
ing the corresponding time periods.

To illustrate the application of a text mining ap-
proach, we analyze each king’s ruling style from
the Annals of the Joseon dynasty. Being a monar-
chial system, almost all decisions within the gov-
ernment are confirmed by the king, where the king
can make the decision on his own, or after dis-
cussing it with the government officials. We iden-
tify the patterns of each king’s decision making
and compare the patterns among the kings. The re-
sults show interesting patterns of the kings’ ruling
styles, including the tendency to make arbitrary
decisions of the kings who were later dethroned
because of tyranny. Additionally, we apply a topic
model to the corpus and analyze the kings’ ruling
style for each topic.

2 The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty

In this section, we describe the details of The An-
nals of the Joseon Dynasty (from here referred to
as the AJD) (Chunchugwan, 1863) and our pro-
cess for building a corpus of the AJD. In its en-
tirety, the AJD consists of records from twenty-
seven kings over 519 years. However, the last two
kings’ (Gojong, Sunjong) books are usually ex-
cluded from research by historians because many
facts are distorted. We follow that convention and
use the books of the first twenty-five kings. These
records, in their original Chinese text and in the
Korean translations, are available publicly through

scription of the original Chinese text, the Korean
translation, and the scanned images from the origi-
nal books. Figure 1 shows an example article3. For
this paper, we analyze the Korean translated text
(Figure 1b), though we refer to the Chinese ver-
sion to understand the meaning of some words that
are not currently used in the modern Korean lan-
guage. Each Korean article has a title (marked T
in the figure) that is created by the translators, the
body text (A, B, C, F and K in the figure) and the
meta information (M) including the source, page,
and tags of the article.

3 King’s Ruling Style

Joseon was a monarchy, but a king could not make
all decisions by himself. Instead, Joseon adopted a
government system that most of the public issues
are discussed with the government officials (Park,
1983; Kim, 2008) before the king made the deci-
sions, which are all recorded in the AJD. Hence,
by analyzing the decision making process in the
AJD, we can understand each king’s ruling style.

3.1 Categorizing ruling style

In Joseon dynasty, the king was the final decision
maker. Even when the government officials dis-
cussed the public issues, a king’s approval was
needed. We can categorize each king’s decision
making process into three types. First, a king can
order directly without discussion, which we call
Arbitrary Decision (AD). Second, a king can dis-
cuss an issue with the officials and then direct his

order, which we call Discussion and Order (DO).
Third, a king can discuss an issue with the officials
and then decide to follow the officials’ suggestion,
which we call Discussion and Follow (DF). The
difference between DO and DF is that in DO, the
king acts aggressively with his own opinion.

From these observations, we ask two research
questions: 1) Can we identify and categorize kings
with different ruling styles? 2) Do kings’ ruling
styles differ depending on the topic?

3.2 Method

To understand each king’s ruling style, we first
identify relevant articles that contain the king’s
decision making because many of the articles
describe non-governmental affairs, such as the
weather, or simple status reports. These relevant
articles contain direct quotations of the words of
the king or the government official. The origi-
nal texts do not contain any quotation marks, but
translators added them to distinguish explicit quo-
tations, which we can use to identify these relevant
articles. Its size is 126K, 36% over all articles.

Each article contains who said what for an is-
sue, and king’s final actions are written mostly in
the last part of the article. For example, the under-
lined last sentence in Figure 1b says that the king
followed the official’s suggestion. Hence, to iden-
tify king’s action for each issue, we focus on the

last sentence in each article.
First, we identify that the setence subject is the

king, because some issues are dealt by others.
For example, Sunjo, Heonjong and Cheoljong’s
mother or grandmother ruled as regent, so her de-
cisions are recorded in the AJD. To identify the
part of speech in Korean, we used HanNanum
(Choi et al., 2012). And, we investigate the verbs
that indicating decisions including order, follow,
approval and reject. We use sixty verbs that de-
scribe king’s decision specifically, and table 2
shows example words. Finally, we classify these
decisions into three types: 1) the king orders with-
out discussions with the officials, and we label
them as AD, 2) the king orders, approves, or re-
jects verbs in which their original Chinese char-
acters show active decision making by the king,
and we label them as DO, and 3) the king follows
or discusses verbs which show passive submission
by the king, and we label them as DF.

To identify topics, we use a Bayesian topic
model, LDA (Blei et al., 2003). We implement
it using Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004), set 300 topics, and optimized hyper-
parameters after 100 iterations (Asuncion et al.,
2009). We remove stopwords and words with doc-
ument frequency of 30 or smaller.

3.3 Results and Discussions

We investigate the difference of ruling style be-
tween kings. We run multinomial test (Read and
Cressie, 1988) between king’s ruling style distri-
butions. Result shows that almost all kings are
different significant from others (p < 0.001). It
means that each king has his own ruling style.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of each cate-
gory of ruling style. Overall, many kings do not
act arbitrary. They discuss about many of the na-
tional affairs with officials. But, Taejo who is the

Table 3: Example of different topics (p < 0.01)
from overall ruling style distribution

founder of the Joseon dynasty shows high value of
AD. And Yeonsangun and Gwanghaegun who are
evaluated as a tyrant also show high value of it. So
we can imagine that tyrants tend to act arbitrarily.

We also identified those kings whose ruling
style differed most from other kings. We use
JS divergence which is the symmetric measure
of the difference between two probability distri-
butions. We compute JS divergence with each
king pair’s ruling style distributions. Result shows
that Heonjong (0.1220) and Yeonsangun (0.0998)
have highest distance value. It means their rul-
ing style are quite different from other kings.
Because Heonjong’s grandmother governed the
Joseon each year, so his actions are quite few. But,
unlike Yeonsangun, Gwanghaegun (0.0454) who
is known as a tyrant has similar value mean dis-
tance from other kings (0.0434). It means his rul-
ing style is quite similar to other kings, and this re-
sult supports previous results in Korean historical
study (Kye, 2008) that re-evaluate his reputation.

We investigate the difference of king’s ruling
style based on the topic. We run multinomial test
(Read and Cressie, 1988) between king’s overall
ruling style distribution and specific distribution
given a topic. Results show that some ruling styles
given a topic are different significant from overall
(p < 0.01). It means that the king’s ruling style
when the topic is given is different from his usual
style. Table 3 shows examples of topic. Figure 3

shows four kings’ overall ruling style and specific
one given a topic. Comparing with the leftmost
bars which is overall ruling style of the king, each
ruling style given a topic is different from it. And,
we can see that kings show similar/different rul-
ing style for a topic. For example, kings tend to
discuss and order (DO) to officials for retirement
and remission topics. And, Sejong the Great and
Gwanghaegun discuss and follow (DF) officials’
words for agricultural topic. But, for grants topic,
Yeonsangun and Gwanghaegun act more arbitrar-
ily (AD) than overall ruling style, and Sejong the
Great follows more official’s opinions (DF).

4 Conclusion and Future Work

We introduced long and large historical docu-
ments, The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. It con-
tains lots of topics such as political, economic, so-
cial and cultural over 500 years. We looked at the
ruling style of kings in Joseon dynasty and its dif-
ference by topics by computational methods.

This is ongoing work, and we are looking to find
more hidden structures in the AJD. Currently, his-
torians evaluate the king’s reputations (Park, 2004;
Lee, 2010). This evaluation is done by many as-
pects, but one of the important feature is king’s
ruling style (Kim, 2008). So we are looking to
improve methods for analyzing ruling style more
specifically. For example, we will look at the re-
lationship with officials, especially who can make
the king follows his opinion. This approach can be
used to measure king’s leadership.
