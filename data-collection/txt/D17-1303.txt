Abstract

In this paper we propose a model to
learn multimodal multilingual representa-
tions for matching images and sentences
in different languages, with the aim of
advancing multilingual versions of image
search and image understanding. Our
model learns a common representation for
images and their descriptions in two dif-
ferent languages (which need not be paral-
lel) by considering the image as a pivot be-
tween two languages. We introduce a new
pairwise ranking loss function which can
handle both symmetric and asymmetric
similarity between the two modalities. We
evaluate our models on image-description
ranking for German and English, and on
semantic textual similarity of image de-
scriptions in English. In both cases we
achieve state-of-the-art performance.

1 Introduction

In recent years there has been a significant amount
of research in language and vision tasks which
require the joint modeling of texts and images.
Examples include text-based image retrieval, im-
age description and visual question answering.
An increasing number of large image descrip-
tion datasets has become available (Hodosh et al.,
2013; Young et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2014) and
various systems have been proposed to handle the
image description task as a generation problem
(Bernardi et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2015; Vinyals
et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2015). There has also
been a great deal of work on sentence-based im-
age search or cross-modal retrieval where the ob-
jective is to learn a joint space for images and text
(Hodosh et al., 2013; Frome et al., 2013; Karpathy

et al., 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Socher et al., 2014;
Donahue et al., 2015).

Previous work on image description generation
or learning a joint space for images and text has
mostly focused on English due to the availabil-
ity of English datasets. Recently there have been
attempts to create image descriptions and mod-
els for other languages (Funaki and Nakayama,
2015; Elliott et al., 2016; Rajendran et al., 2016;
Miyazaki and Shimizu, 2016; Specia et al., 2016;
Li et al., 2016; Hitschler et al., 2016; Yoshikawa
et al., 2017).

Most work on learning a joint space for images
and their descriptions is based on Canonical Cor-
relation Analysis (CCA) or neural variants of CCA
over representations of image and its descriptions
(Hodosh et al., 2013; Andrew et al., 2013; Yan
and Mikolajczyk, 2015; Gong et al., 2014; Chan-
dar et al., 2016). Besides CCA, a few others learn
a visual-semantic or multimodal embedding space
of image descriptions and representations by opti-
mizing a ranking cost function (Kiros et al., 2015;
Socher et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Vendrov et al.,
2016) or by aligning image regions (objects) and
segments of the description (Karpathy et al., 2014;
Plummer et al., 2015) in a common space. Re-
cently Lin and Parikh (2016) have leveraged visual
question answering models to encode images and
descriptions into the same space.

However, all of this work is targeted at mono-
lingual descriptions, i.e., mapping images and de-
scriptions in a single language onto a joint em-
bedding space. The idea of pivoting or bridging
is not new and language pivoting is well explored
for machine translation (Wu and Wang, 2007; Firat
et al., 2016) and to learn multilingual multimodal
representations (Rajendran et al., 2016; Calixto
et al., 2017). Rajendran et al. (2016) propose a

Joint space

model to learn common representations between
M views and assume there is parallel data avail-
able between a pivot view and the remaining M−1
views. Their multimodal experiments are based on
English as the pivot and use large parallel corpora
available between languages to learn their repre-
sentations.

Related to our work Calixto et al. (2017) pro-
posed a model for creating multilingual multi-
modal embeddings. Our work is different from
theirs in that we choose the image as the pivot and
use a different similarity function. We also pro-
pose a single model for learning representations
of images and multiple languages, whereas their
model is language-specific.

In this paper, we learn multimodal representa-
tions in multiple languages, i.e., our model yields
a joint space for images and text in multiple lan-
guages using the image as a pivot between lan-
guages. We propose a new objective function in
a multitask learning setting and jointly optimize
the mappings between images and text in two dif-
ferent languages.

2 Dataset

We experiment with the Multi30k dataset, a mul-
tilingual extension of Flickr30k corpus (Young
et al., 2014) consisting of English and German
image descriptions (Elliott et al., 2016). The
Multi30K dataset has 29k, 1k and 1k images in
the train, validation and test splits respectively, and
contains two types of multilingual annotations: (i)
a corpus of one English description per image and
its translation into German; and (ii) a corpus of
five independently collected English and German
descriptions per image. We use the independently
collected English and German descriptions to train
our models. Note that these descriptions are not

translations of each other, i.e., they are not paral-
lel, although they describe the same image.

3 Problem Formulation

Given an image i and its descriptions c1 and c2
in two different languages our aim is to learn a
model which maps i, c1 and c2 onto same com-
mon space RN (where N is the dimensionality of
the embedding space) such that the image and its
gold-standard descriptions in both languages are
mapped close to each other (as shown in Figure 1).
Our model consists of the embedding functions fi
and fc to encode images and descriptions and a
scoring function S to compute the similarity be-
tween a description–image pair.

In the following we describe two models: (i) the
PIVOT model that uses the image as pivot between
the description in both the languages; (ii) the PAR-
ALLEL model that further forces the image de-
scriptions in both languages to be closer to each
other in the joint space. We build two variants
of PIVOT and PARALLEL with different similarity
functions S to learn the joint space.

3.1 Multilingual Multimodal Representation
Models

In both PIVOT and PARALLEL we use a deep
convolutional neural network architecture (CNN)
to represent the image i denoted by fi(i) = Wi ·
CNN(i) where Wi is a learned weight matrix and
CNN(i) is the image vector representation. For
each language we define a recurrent neural net-
work encoder fc(ck) = GRU(ck) with gated recur-
rent units (GRU) activations to encode the descrip-
tion ck.

In PIVOT, we use monolingual corpora from
multiple languages of sentences aligned with im-
ages to learn the joint space. The intuition of this
model is that an image is a universal represen-
tation across all languages, and if we constrain
a sentence representation to be closer to image,
sentences in different languages may also come
closer. Accordingly we design a loss function as
follows:

losspivot = ∑
k

[
∑

(ck ,i)

(
∑
c′k

max{0,α−S(ck, i)+S(c′k, i)}

+∑
i′

max{0,α−S(ck, i)+S(ck, i′)}
)]

(1)

where k stands for each language. This loss
function encourages the similarity S(ck, i) between
gold-standard description ck and image i to be
greater than any other irrelevant description c′k by
a margin α. A similar loss function is useful for
learning multimodal embeddings in a single lan-
guage (Kiros et al., 2015). For each minibatch, we
obtain invalid descriptions by selecting descrip-
tions of other images except the current image of
interest and vice-versa.

In PARALLEL, in addition to making an im-
age similar to a description, we make multiple
descriptions of the same image in different lan-
guages similar to each other, based on the assump-
tion that these descriptions, although not parallel,
share some commonalities. Accordingly we en-
hance the previous loss function with an additional
term:

losspara = losspivot + ∑
(c1,c2)

(
∑
c′1

max{0,α−S(c1,c2)

+S(c′1,c2)}+∑
c′2

max{0,α−S(c1,c2)+S(c1,c′2)}
) (2)

Note that we are iterating over all pairs of descrip-
tions (c1,c2), and maximizing the similarity be-
tween descriptions of the same image and at the
same time minimizing the similarity between de-
scriptions of different images.

We learn models using two similarity functions:
symmetric and asymmetric. For the former we use
cosine similarity and for the latter we use the met-
ric of Vendrov et al. (2016) which is useful for
learning embeddings that maintain an order, e.g.,
dog and cat are more closer to pet than animal
while being distinct. Such ordering is shown to
be useful in building effective multimodal space
of images and texts. An analogy in our setting
would be two descriptions of an image are closer
to the image while at the same time preserving the
identity of each (which is useful when sentences
describe two different aspects of the image). The
similarity metric is defined as:

S(a,b) =−||max(0,b−a)||2 (3)

where a and b are embeddings of image and de-
scription.

We call the symmetric similarity variants of
our models as PIVOT-SYM and PARALLEL-SYM,
and the asymmetric variants PIVOT-ASYM and
PARALLEL-ASYM.

4 Experiments and Results

We test our model on the tasks of image-
description ranking and semantic textual similar-
ity. We work with each language separately. Since
we learn embeddings for images and languages in
the same semantic space, our hope is that the train-
ing data for each modality or language acts com-
plementary data for the another modality or lan-
guage, and thus helps us learn better embeddings.

Experiment Setup We sampled minibatches of
size 64 images and their descriptions, and drew
all negative samples from the minibatch. We
trained using the Adam optimizer with learning
rate 0.001, and early stopping on the validation
set. Following Vendrov et al. (2016) we set the
dimensionality of the embedding space and the
GRU hidden layer N to 1024 for both English and
German. We set the dimensionality of the learned
word embeddings to 300 for both languages, and
the margin α to 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, to learn
asymmetric and symmetric similarity-based em-
beddings.1 We keep all hyperparameters constant
across all models. We used the L2 norm to miti-
gate over-fitting (Kiros et al., 2015). We tokenize
and truecase both English and German descrip-
tions using the Moses Decoder scripts.2

To extract image features, we used a convolu-
tional neural network model trained on 1.2M im-
ages of 1000 class ILSVRC 2012 object classifi-
cation dataset, a subset of ImageNet (Russakovsky
et al., 2015). Specifically, we used VGG 19-layer
CNN architecture and extracted the activations of
the penultimate fully connected layer to obtain
features for all images in the dataset (Simonyan
and Zisserman, 2015). We use average features
from 10 crops of the re-scaled images.3

Baselines As baselines we use monolingual
models, i.e., models trained on each language sep-
arately. Specifically, we use Visual Semantic Em-
beddings (VSE) of Kiros et al. (2015) and Order
Embeddings (OE) of Vendrov et al. (2016). We

4.1 Image-Description Ranking Results

To evaluate the multimodal multilingual embed-
dings, we report results on an image-description
ranking task. Given a query in the form of a de-
scription or an image, the task its to retrieve all im-
ages or descriptions sorted based on the relevance.
We use the standard ranking evaluation metrics of
recall at position k (R@K, where higher is bet-
ter) and median rank (Mr, where lower is better)
to evaluate our models. We report results for both
English and German descriptions. Note that we
have one single model for both languages.

In Tables 1 and 2 we present the ranking re-
sults of the baseline models of Kiros et al. (2015)
and Vendrov et al. (2016) and our proposed PIVOT
and PARALLEL models. We do not compare
our image-description ranking results with Calixto
et al. (2017) since they report results on half of val-
idation set of Multi30k whereas our results are on
the publicly available test set of Multi30k. For En-
glish, PIVOT with asymmetric similarity is either
competitive or better than monolingual models

and symmetric similarity, especially in the R@10
category it obtains state-of-the-art. For German,
both PIVOT and PARALLEL with the asymmetric
scoring function outperform monolingual models
and symmetric similarity. We also observe that
the German ranking experiments benefit the most
from the multilingual signal. A reason for this
could be that the German description corpus has
many singleton words (more than 50% of the vo-
cabulary) and English description mapping might
have helped in learning better semantic embed-
dings. These results suggest that the multilingual
signal could be used to learn better multimodal
embeddings, irrespective of the language. Our re-
sults also show that the asymmetric scoring func-
tion can help learn better embeddings. In Table 3
we present a few examples where PIVOT-ASYM
and PARALLEL-ASYM models performed better
on both the languages compared to baseline order
embedding model even using descriptions of very
different lengths as queries.

4.2 Semantic Textual Similarity Results

In the semantic textual similarity task (STS), we
use the textual embeddings from our model to
compute the similarity between a pair of sen-

tences (image descriptions in this case). We eval-
uate on video task from STS-2012 and image
tasks from STS-2014, STS-2015 (Agirre et al.
2012, Agirre et al. 2014, Agirre et al. 2015).
The video descriptions in the STS-2012 task are
from the MSR video description corpus (Chen and
Dolan, 2011) and the image descriptions in STS-
2014 and 2015 are from UIUC PASCAL dataset
(Rashtchian et al., 2010).

In Table 4, we present the Pearson correla-
tion coefficients of our model predicted scores
with the gold-standard similarity scores provided
as part of the STS image/video description tasks.
We compare with the best reported scores for the
STS shared tasks, achieved by MLMME (Cal-
ixto et al., 2017), paraphrastic sentence embed-
dings (Wieting et al., 2017), visual semantic em-
beddings (Kiros et al., 2015), and order embed-
dings (Vendrov et al., 2016). The shared task base-
line is computed based on word overlap and is
high for both the 2014 and the 2015 dataset, indi-
cating that there is substantial lexical overlap be-
tween the STS image description datasets. Our
models outperform both the baseline system and
the best system submitted to the shared task. For
the 2012 video paraphrase corpus, our multilin-
gual methods performed better than the monolin-
gual methods showing that similarity across para-
phrases can be learned using multilingual sig-
nals. Similarly, Wieting et al. (2017) have re-
ported to learn better paraphrastic sentence em-
beddings with multilingual signals. Overall, we
observe that models learned using the asymmet-
ric scoring function outperform the state-of-the-
art on these datasets, suggesting that multilingual

sharing is beneficial. Although the task has noth-
ing to do German, because our models can make
use of datasets from different languages, we were
able to train on significantly larger training dataset
of approximately 145k descriptions. Calixto et al.
(2017) also train on a larger dataset like ours, but
could not exploit this to their advantage. In Table 5
we present the example sentences with the highest
and lowest difference between gold-standard and
predicted semantic textual similarity scores using
our best performing PARALLEL-ASYM model.

5 Conclusions

We proposed a new model that jointly learns mul-
tilingual multimodal representations using the im-
age as a pivot between languages. We introduced
new objective functions that can exploit similari-
ties between images and descriptions across lan-
guages. We obtained state-of-the-art results on
two tasks: image-description ranking and seman-
tic textual similarity. Our results suggest that
exploiting multilingual and multimodal resources
can help in learning better semantic representa-
tions.
