Abstract

Computational linguistic approaches to sign languages could benefit from investigating how com-
plexity influences structure. We investigate whether morphological complexity has an effect on
the order of Verb (V) and Object (O) in Swedish Sign Language (SSL), on the basis of elicited
data from five Deaf signers. We find a significant difference in the distribution of the order-
ings OV vs. VO, based on an analysis of morphological weight. While morphologically heavy
verbs exhibit a general preference for OV, humanness seems to affect the ordering in the opposite
direction, with [+human] Objects pushing towards a preference for VO.

1 Introduction

Word order is one of the most well-documented grammatical features of the (spoken) languages of the
world. One specific case regarding word order is the order of a Verb V and its (direct) Object O in a
simple transitive clause. In a sample of 1,519 languages of the world, 46.9% (n = 713) of the languages
have a dominant OV order, whereas 46.4% (n = 705) have a dominant VO order (Dryer, 2013).1

For signed languages, the two observed dominant word orders are SOV and SVO, for which the lat-
ter has been generalised as a grammatical order in most sign languages. However, a number of factors
are said to affect the ordering of O and V, for instance that morphologically complex verbs (e.g., those
exhibiting morphological reduplication, handshape or directional object agreement, or coinciding with
non-manual marking) prefer a verb-final position, hence occurring after its object. One reason for this
ordering preference has been suggested to relate directly to the interaction between the verb and its ob-
ject, since some complexity features involve types of “agreement” with the object. Thus, the idea is that
the object needs to be introduced before verb agreement with the object is available on the verb (Napoli
and Sutton-Spence, 2014). This relates directly to findings from spoken languages, for which it has been
noted that the ordering of verb and controller NP affects the agreement realisation, such that verbs pre-
ceding their controller NP do not always agree with the controller (Corbett, 2006). Furthermore, among
spoken languages, word order also interacts with the presence or absence of morphological marking.
For instance, SOV languages generally differentiate Subject and Object on the basis of morphological
marking (e.g., case), while SVO languages differentiate these argument roles by word order alone (i.e.,
by linear distance between the arguments) (Sinnemäki, 2010). In a study looking at young, emerging
sign languages, it was argued that humanness as an animacy feature accounts for word order preferences,
in that SOV is preferred unless both S and O are [+human], in which case SVO is preferred (Meir et al.,
in press).

For Swedish Sign Language (SSL), the dominant word order has been identified as SVO (Bergman and
Wallin, 1985), which has also been corroborated by a small-scale corpus study more recently (Börstell
et al., 2016). Although different types of morphological complexity (e.g., reduplication and agreement)
have been suggested to influence word order in SSL (Bergman and Wallin, 1985; Bergman and Dahl,

Handshape Whether an Object classifier was present in the verb’s handshape (Emmorey, 2003).
Directionality Whether an Object location was present in the verb’s movement (Padden, 1988).
Reduplication Whether the verb was reduplicated (Bergman and Dahl, 1994).
Non-manual Whether a non-manual morpheme accompanied the verb (Crasborn, 2006).

1994), no study has explicitly addressed this issue. Thus, the aim of this study is to use statistical boot-
strapping methods to establish whether morphological complexity affects the order of Object and Verb
in SSL. By doing so, we seek to tease apart the different factors influencing word order patterns in SSL,
and incorporate the notion of morphological complexity more explicitly as a property of signed language
grammar, particularly with regard to the interaction between morphology and syntax. Uncovering the
intricacies of this interaction can also be helpful for developing sign language technology, and can serve
as a starting point when annotating sign language corpora. Information about the effect of complexity
can be used to inform machine learning systems, e.g., by including this information as features, or by
predicting a verb’s complexity as an auxiliary task in a neural network (see, e.g., Plank et al. (2016) and
Bjerva et al. (2016)).

2 Data and Methodology

2.1 Data and Annotations

The data consisted of video recorded descriptions of 17 transitive events (see Table 2) by five Deaf signers
of SSL (4 male; aged 18–44), all using SSL as their first language. The signers were individually recorded
describing the stimuli events to another signer, who was instructed to correctly identify the described
event from three different options. Descriptions were annotated in the ELAN software (Wittenburg et
al., 2006). In total, 145 individual transitive verbs were annotated for the categories in Table 1.

Handshape and Directionality involve morphological complexity dependent on the Object: Object
classifier handshapes are selected on the basis of the Object’s physical properties; Directionality involves
the incorporation of referential locations in signing space, such that the verb moves between – or agrees
with – locations established for various discourse referents (here, the Object(s)). Both of these categories
entail the verb form being altered according to its Object, in a sense making the verb form dependent on
physical and spatial properties of the Object. This has been suggested to influence the order of O and V,
such that an Object-dependent Verb follows its Object, i.e., OV (Napoli and Sutton-Spence, 2014).

The latter two categories also involve morphological complexity, but rather independent from the
Object: Reduplication involves phonological repetition, for signed language often associated with aspec-
tual and/or pluractional morphology (Fischer and Janis, 1990; Bergman and Dahl, 1994); Non-manual
concerns the addition of non-manual markers (e.g., facial expression, or so-called oral adverbs2) accom-
panying a verb. These are associated with both phonological and morphological weight, and are also
found to be associated with a post-Object position (Napoli and Sutton-Spence, 2014).

Each individual verb in the data set was coded for these four categories by one of the authors of this
paper. If a verb occurred with two objects (i.e., a direct and an indirect object), the verb token was
counted as two items: once for each object. The annotations were binary features (yes vs. no), but for
the Object-dependent categories (i.e., Handshape and Directionality) also matched to the relevant object.
That is, the Handshape value yes would only be assigned for the object indexed by the handshape. Each
item in the data set was also annotated for whether its Object was human or inanimate.3 Thus, we
could differentiate the four complexity features’ effect on word order on the basis of the animacy of the
Object in question.

Each Object was also annotated as Overt or Elliptical: that is, if the Object occurred within the same
clause as its Verb, it was coded as Overt; if the Object was present in an adjoining clause, it was coded

as Elliptical.4 For the latter, the order of V and O was determined by linear order on the utterance level.

2.2 Statistical Analysis

In order to avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the distribution of the variable we investigate
(verb complexity), we chose to use a non-parametric bootstrapping test (Efron and Tibshirani, 1990;
Efron and Tibshirani, 1994). Instead of fitting the parameters of a distribution specified a priori to our
data, we repeatedly resample from our original sample (the data) to estimate the amount of variation and
thus the significance of our results. For a high-level introduction to this statistical method, we refer the
reader to Calmettes et al. (2012).

In the data set used in this paper, we compare annotations of 145 verbs. We calculate the complexity
of each verb as being the number of features present, divided by the maximum number of features (see
Table 1). We then use bootstrap resampling to estimate the populations as divided into two groups,
comparing the complexity between OV and VO items.5 We subdivide our data into groups depending
on whether or not the argument is overt, and if so whether or not this argument is [+human] or
[+inanimate]. Additionally, we investigate whether the Object in question is direct (DO) or indirect
(IO). This leads to a total of 12 possible comparisons between the OV and VO orders.

3 Results and Analysis

Running a bootstrap resampling test with resampling, using 10,000 iterations estimating the mean of the
populations, yields differences at the p-levels reported in Table 3, with p < 0.05 indicating that the mean
complexity of OV is significantly higher than that of VO.

4Cases of covert, implicit (i.e., semantic) Objects were excluded from the data set.
5We use the implementation found at http://gcalmettes.github.io/bootstrap-tools/.

IOBJ inanimate is not plotted as the condition contains no data.

We see a division here on the basis of animacy. For all tokens (DO + IO), we see that the mean
complexity in OV is significantly higher than that of VO across conditions. For the DO tokens, the same
is true for all conditions but the overt-human. For the IO tokens, there is no significant difference
between OV and VO based on complexity. Instead, an important aspect here is that the IO row contains
several n/a cells. This is due to that fact that for the IO tokens (of which all are [+human]), the
distribution of VO vs. OV is so skewed that practically all items fall into the former category, making
statistical testing impossible (see Figure 1).6 This should be taken as an indication that humanness is,
in fact, associated with the VO order to a high degree, which corroborates the findings by Meir et al. (in
press). Thus, while morphologically complex verbs prefer the OV order, humanness pushes towards VO.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

We have shown that morphological complexity is a relevant factor when investigating word order patterns
in SSL. From a computational perspective, this suggests that machine learning approaches to SSL could
benefit from using morphological complexity and animacy as features. As claimed for other sign lan-
guages (Napoli and Sutton-Spence, 2014), the incorporation of Object features (Handshape classifiers
and Directionality) together with other morphological features (Reduplication and Non-manual mark-
ing) influence the ordering of V and O in SSL. Furthermore, animacy features of the Object also affect
the ordering of V and O, such that [+human] Objects push towards the order VO. As argued by, e.g.,
Meir et al. (in press), this would be explained by disambiguation strategies in reversible sentences, ob-
servable in several emerging sign languages. That is, for sentences in which both S and O are possible
Agents, the roles are disambiguated by separating S from O by putting V in between the two. In the case
of non-reversible sentences, this strategy is not needed, and other preferences may play a larger role.
For general linguistic theory, this relates to the notion of Differential Object Marking (Bossong, 1985;
Aissen, 2003), and the preference of explicitly marking Objects that are high in the prominence hierarchy
(e.g., animacy).
