Abstract

The Irish National  Morphology Database is  a  human-verified,  Official  Standard-compliant 
dataset containing the inflected forms and other morpho-syntactic properties of Irish nouns, 
adjectives, verbs and prepositions. It is being developed by Foras na Gaeilge as part of the 
New English-Irish Dictionary project. This paper introduces this dataset and its accompanying 
software library Gramadán.

1 Introduction

The Irish National Morphology Database is a side product of the New English-Irish Dictionary project  
at Foras na Gaeilge. During work on the dictionary, a requirement arose to include rich morphological  
information on the target (Irish) side of the dictionary. It has been decided to build a separate morpho-
logical dataset that translations in the dictionary would link to. The result can be viewed at http://fo-
cloir.ie/ where clicking a grammatical label next to a translation opens a window listing the inflec-
ted forms and other morphological properties of the word. The same data can also be viewed separ -
ately at http://breis.focloir.ie/en/gram/.

2 Database design

The Irish National Morphology Database has been compiled semi-automatically from several sources  
available to Foras na Gaeilge, including a machine-readable version of Foclóir Póca and grammatical 
data extracted from WinGléacht and focal.ie. All data resulting from this process have been proof-read 
and corrected by editors working on the New English-Irish Dictionary project. Therefore, we describe 
the database as a high-accuracy dataset: it does not come with a known margin of error and it is meant  
to have normative force. The language data complies with the Official Standard for Irish (An Caigh-
deán Oifigiúil 2012).

At time of writing, the database contains 6,736 nouns, 983 adjectives, 1,239 verbs and 16 preposi-
tions. New entries are being added continuously.

Each entry has a unique identifier consisting of the lemma followed by a grammatical label, such as  
bainis_fem2. In cases where the grammatical label is not sufficient to distinguish between homonyms,  
the identifier contains a “disambiguator”, such as glúin_fem2_cos (the noun glúin ‘knee’ with plural 
glúine) versus glúin_fem2_aois (the noun glúin ‘generation’ with plural glúnta). The disambiguators 
(cos  ‘leg’, aois ‘age’) are purely mnemotechnic: no attempt is being made to expose the semantics of 
the lemmas, only that two different lemmas exist with two different sets of inflected forms.

The database structure allows for variation everywhere. Every inflected form (for example, every 
combination of case and number) is in essence a list of variants which can contain zero, one or more

forms, each with its own grammatical properties. Thus we can accommodate cases when the Offical  
Standard allows for variation, such as the two genitives of talamh ‘land’ (masculine talaimh and fem-
inine  talún). On the other hand, an empty list of variants implies the form does not exist (or is not 
known), for example when a noun has no plural.

The entries are encoded in XML. Every entry comes in two shapes: a minimal format which con-
tains the smallest necessary set of forms and properties, and an expanded format intended for present-
ation to humans. For example, in the case of nouns, the minimal entries contain only one form for each 
number and case (e.g. bainis ‘wedding’ in singular nominative) while, in the expanded entry, these are 
“expanded” to include definitiveness (bainis ‘a wedding’,  an bhainis ‘the wedding’). The expanded 
entries are then transformed with XSL into HTML and displayed to human users. The minimal entries 
are intended as a machine-readable resource that can be re-used for other purposes in language techno-
logy, such as for building spellcheckers or for query expansion in fulltext search.

Minimal entries are converted into expanded entries using Gramadán, a custom-built software lib-
rary written in C#. Gramadán provides functions for performing grammatical operations such as initial 
mutations,  constructing  noun  phrases  from nouns  and  adjectives,  constructing  verb  phrases  from 
verbs, and so on. The process of converting a minimal entry into an expanded entry is in essence an 
exercise in natural language generation (where syntactic structures are serialized into strings),  and 
Gramadán is in essence a software library for natural language generation in Irish.

2.1 Nouns

Listing 1 shows a typical noun entry (abhainn ‘river’)1 in minimal format, Listing 2 shows the same 
entry in expanded format. Notice that each form (sgNom being singular nominative,  sgGen singular 
genitive and so on) consists of a string (the default attribute) with form-specific properties: singular 
forms have gender while plural forms do not, the plural genitive has strength (a property which signals 
whether the form is weak or strong). Notice that we have decided to treat gender as a property of a  
word form, not a property of the whole lemma. This makes it possible to deal with cases like talamh 
‘land’ which has two singular genitives, one masculine and one feminine.

2.2 Adjectives

Listing 3 shows a typical adjective entry (bán ‘white’)2 in minimal format, Listing 4 shows the same 
entry in expanded format. The forms of an adjective are less evenly distributed than those of a noun:  
there is one singular nominative, two singular genitives (for agreement with masculine and feminine 
nouns) and only one plural form for all cases (the singular nominative is used for agreement with 
weak-plural genitive nouns). This is sufficient information for Gramadán to generate the forms needed 
for agreement with all kinds of nouns in all numbers and cases, as can be seen in the expanded format. 
The minimal format also contains a graded form which is used by Gramadán to generate comparatives 
and superlatives in the past and present.

2.3 Verbs

Listing 5 shows an extract from a typical verb entry (bagair ‘threaten’)3 in minimal format, Listing 6 
shows a corresponding extract from the same entry in expanded format. Verbs are more complicated  
than nouns and adjectives in the sense that they contain many more forms. In the Irish National Mor -
phology Database, a verb has forms for up to six tenses (past, past continuous, present, present con-
tinuous, future, conditional) and two moods (imperative, subjunctive). Note that we treat the condi-
tional as a tense because it has the properties of a tense, even though grammar books traditionally cat -
egorize it as a mood.

The difference between a tense and a mood is that a tense can generate forms that are either declar -
ative or interrogative, while a mood can only generate declarative forms (bagair! ‘threaten!’,  ná ba-
gair! ‘don’t threaten!’).  Consequently, every tense form in the minimal format is labelled as being 
either dependent or independent, while mood forms have no such distinction. The dependent and in-
dependent forms are identical for many verbs, but different for some irregular ones (e.g. déan ‘make’

in the past tense: independent rinne, dependent dearna). The independent forms generate positive de-
clarative forms (rinne mé ‘I made’), the dependent forms generate all others (ní dhearna mé ‘I didn’t 
make’, an ndearna mé? ‘did I make?’, nach ndearna mé? ‘didn’t I make?’)

Additionally, every tense and mood form is assigned to a person, which in our analysis is a confla-
tion of person, number and other features: there is a “base” person from which analytic forms are gen-
erated (rinne ‘made’ → rinne muid ‘we made’), there are singular/plural first/second/third persons for 
synthetic forms (rinneamar ‘we made’), and there is an “autonomous” person for passive forms of the 
verb (rinneadh ‘was made’).

A typical verb has, in its minimal format, about 60 individual forms. This is the set from which  
Gramadán can generate a verb phrase in any tense or mood, person, number, polarity (positive or neg-
ative) and shape (declarative or interrogative). Unlike other parts of speech where the rules for gener-
ating an expanded entry from a minimal one are completely regular, the verbal component in  Gra-
madán has some hard-coded exceptions for a small number of irregular verbs. Also, the verb bí ‘be’ is 
quite exceptional as it is the only verb that has both a present tense ( tá ‘is’) and a continuous present 
tense (bíonn ‘habitually is’); other verbs only have a continuous present tense (their non-continuous 
present tense is built analytically from the verbal noun). Finally, the Irish National Morphology Data -
base does not include the copula is, as we do not think it is as a verb.

3 More about Gramadán

The tool used for processing data in the Irish National Morphology Database,  Gramadán, deserves 
separate mention. Besides converting entries from minimal to expanded format, Gramadán has addi-
tional features both below and above the level of words.

Below the level of words, for nouns and adjectives that have not been included in the Irish National  
Morphology Database yet, Gramadán is able to derive their forms and properties from knowing which 
inflection class they belong to. Unlike the traditional inflection classes found in Irish dictionaries,  
Gramadán  uses a radically different  system,  inspired by Carnie (2008), where singular and plural 
classes are separate.

Above the level of words, Gramadán can be used as a realisation engine in an NLG (natural lan-
guage generation) setting. Gramadán is able to use data from the Irish National Morphology Database 
to construct noun phrases, prepositional phrases and rudimentary clauses while respecting the rules of  
gender and number agreement, initial mutations, case inflections and so on. This aspect of Gramadán 
is in development and the goal is, eventually, to cover all the basic syntactical phenomena of Irish in-
cluding the construction of clauses containing the copula and the construction of  numbered  noun 
phrases (noun phrases with cardinal and ordinal numerals).

While many of Gramadán’s features are used for processing the Irish National Morphology Data-
base, it is an independent software tool which has potential applications beyond it.

4 Future plans

The Irish National Morphology Database is work in progress and will continue to be developed by 
Foras na Gaeilge along with other outputs from the New English-Irish Dictionary project. Once the 
database structure has been finalized and detailed documentation has been produced, the whole dataset 
(along with its accompanying tool,  Gramadán) will  be released under an open-source licence and 
made available for download on the Internet. In the longer term, we plan to develop the natural lan-
guage generation aspect of  Gramadán  and to use it as a basis for assistive language technology, as 
well as to inform applied research into Irish morphosyntax.
