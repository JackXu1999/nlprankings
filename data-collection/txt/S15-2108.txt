Abstract

We describe a Twitter sentiment analysis sys-
tem developed by combining a rule-based
classifier with supervised learning. We sub-
mitted our results for the message-level sub-
task in SemEval 2015 Task 10, and achieved
a F1-score of 57.06%. The rule-based classi-
fier is based on rules that are dependent on the
occurrences of emoticons and opinion words
in tweets. Whereas, the Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) is trained on semantic, depen-
dency, and sentiment lexicon based features.
The tweets are classified as positive, negative
or unknown by the rule-based classifier, and as
positive, negative or neutral by the SVM. The
results we obtained show that rules can help
refine the SVM’s predictions.

1 Introduction

Our opinions and the opinions of others play a
very important role in our decision-making process
and even influence our behaviour. In recent times,
an increasing number of people have taken to ex-
pressing their opinions on a wide variety of topics
on microblogging websites such as Twitter. Be-
ing able to analyse this data and extract opinions
about a number of topics, can help us make informed
choices and predictions regarding those topics. Due
to this, sentiment analysis of tweets is gaining im-
portance across a number of domains such as e-
commerce (Wang and Cardie, 2014), politics (Tu-
masjan et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2012; Wang et

F-score, which is the evaluation metric for this task.

al., 2012), health and psychology (Cambria et al.,
2010; Harman, ; Harman, ), multimodality (Poria et
al., 2015), crowd validation (Cambria et al., 2010),
and even intelligence and surveillance (Jansen et al.,
2009).

SemEval 2015 Task 10 (Rosenthal et al., 2015)
is an international shared-task competition that aims
to promote research in sentiment analysis of tweets
by providing annotated tweets for training, devel-
opment and testing. We created a sentiment anal-
ysis system to participate in the message-level task
of this competition. The objective of the system is
to label the sentiment of each tweet as “positive”,
“negative” or “neutral”.

In this paper, we describe our sentiment analysis
system, which is a combined classifier created by in-
tegrating a rule-based classification layer with a sup-
port vector machine.

2 System Description

Our Sentiment Analysis System consists of two clas-
sifiers – (i) Rule-based and (ii) Supervised, inte-
grated together. This section describes both these
classifiers and how we combine them.

During pre-processing, all the @<username>
references are changes to @USER and all the URLs
are changed to http://URL.com. Then, we use the
CMU Twitter Tokeniser and POS Tagger (Gim-
pel et al., 2011) to tokenise the tweets and give
a parts-of-speech tag to each token. We use the
POS tags to remove all emoticons from the pre-
processed tweets. Pre-processed tweets with emoti-
cons are given as input to the rule-based classi-
fier, whereas the support vector machine takes pre-

647



processed tweets without emoticons as an input.

2.1 Supervised Learning
For the supervised classifier, we cast the sentiment
analysis problem as a multi-class classification prob-
lem, where each tweet has to be labeled as “pos-
itive”, “negative” or “neutral”. We train a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) on the tweets provided for training. For all
our experiments, we use a linear kernel and L1-
regularisation. The C parameter is chosen by cross-
validation. As mentioned above, emoticons have al-
ready been removed from tweets given as input to
the SVM.

Each tweet is represented as a feature vector, con-
taining the following features:

• Word N-grams: Frequencies of contiguous
sequences of 1, 2 or 3 tokens. The TF-IDF
weighting scheme is applied.

• Character N-grams: Frequencies of contigu-
ous sequences of 1, 2 or 3 characters inside
each word’s boundary. The TF-IDF weighting
scheme is applied.

• POS Tags: Using CMU Twitter Tagger (Gim-
pel et al., 2011) output, for each tweet we com-
pute – (i) countAdj (number of adjectives), (ii)
countAdv (number of adverbs), (iii) countNoun
(number of nouns, proper nouns, and proper
nouns+possessives), (iv) countVerb (number of
verbs), and (v) countIntj (number of interjec-
tions). The sum of these five counts, gives us
the totalPos. The POS features are: [ countAdjtotalPos ,
countAdv
totalPos ,

countNoun
totalPos ,

countV erb
totalPos ,

countIntj
totalPos ].

• @USER: A boolean feature that is set to 1 if
the tweet contains a @<username> reference.

• Hashtag: A boolean feature that is set to 1 if
the tweet contains a hashtag.

• URL: A boolean feature that is set to 1 if the
tweet contains a URL.

• Discourse: A boolean feature that is set to 1 if
the tweet contains a “discourse marker”. Ex-
amples of discourse markers would be a “RT”
followed by a username to indicate that the

tweet is a re-tweet, news article headline fol-
lowed by “...” followed by a URL to the news
article, etc. Basically, this feature indicates
whether or not the tweet is a part of a discourse.

• Sentiment140 Lexicon: The Sentiment140
Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013) contains un-
igrams and bigrams along with their polarity
scores in the range of −5.00 to +5.00. Con-
sidering all uni/bi-grams with polarity less than
−1.0 to be negative and with polarity greater
than +1.0 to be positive, we count the number
of negative (negativesCount) and the number
of positive (positivesCount) uni/bi-gram occur-
rences in every tweet. For each tweet,

– the polarityMeasure is based on the pos-
itivesCount and negativesCount, and cal-
culated using Algorithm 1.

– the maximum polarity value (maxPolari-
tyValue) is the most positive or most nega-
tive polarity value of all polar uni/bi-gram
occurrences in the tweet.

Both these features are normalised to values be-
tween −1 and +1.

Algorithm 1 Calculating polarityMeasure based on
positivesCount and negativesCount

if positivesCount > negativesCount then
if negativesCount ! = 0 then

polarityMeasure = positivesCount
negativesCount

else
polarityMeasure = positivesCount

end if
else if negativesCount > positivesCount then

if positivesCount ! = 0 then
polarityMeasure = −1× negativesCount

positivesCount

else
polarityMeasure = −1× negativesCount

end if
end if

• Bing Liu Lexicon: The Bing Liu lexicon (Liu
et al., 2005) is a list of positive and nega-
tive words. We count the number of posi-
tive (positivesCount) and negative words (neg-
ativesCount) in each tweet, and calculate po-
larityMeasure using Algorithm 1. The polari-
tyMeasure is appended to the feature vector.

• NRC Emotion Lexicon: The NRC Emotion
Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2013) con-
tains a list of positive and negative words. The
polarityMeasure is calculated using the method
used for the Bing Liu Lexicon.

• NRC Hashtag Lexicon: The NRC Hashtag
Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013) contains un-
igrams and bigrams along with their polarity
scores in the range of −5.00 to +5.00. Using
the method used for the Sentiment140 Lexicon,
we calculate polarityMeasure and maxPolarity-
Value, and append them to the feature vector.

• SentiWordNet: SentiWordNet (Esuli and Se-
bastiani, 2006) assigns to each synset of Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 2010) 3 scores: positivity, neg-
ativity, objectivity. A word whose positivity
score is greater than negativity and objectiv-
ity is positive, while a word whose negativity
score is greater than positivity and objectivity
is negative. For each tweet, we calculate po-
larityMeasure and maxPolarityValue using the
method used for the Bing Liu Lexicon.

• SenticNet: SenticNet (Cambria et al., 2014)
contains polarity scores of single and multi-
word phrases. We count the number of positive
and negative words/phrases in each tweet, and
calculate polarityMeasure using the method
used for the Sentiment140 Lexicon.

• Negation: The Stanford Dependency
Parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) is used
to find negation in tweets. Negation is not a
feature on its own. Rather, it affects the word
n-grams and the lexicons related features. The
negated word is appended with a “ NEG” in
all n-grams, while the polarity of all negated
words is inverted in the lexicon features.

2.2 Rule-based Classifier
For the rule-based classifier, we cast the problem
as a multi-class classification problem, where each
tweet is to be labeled as “positive”, “negative”
or “unknown”. This is an unsupervised classifier,
which applies the following rules for predictions:

• Emoticon-related Rules: If a tweet contains
only positive emoticons and no negative emoti-

cons, it is classified as positive. If a tweet con-
tains only negative emoticons and no positive
emoticons, it is classified as negative. If a tweet
contains no emoticons, we apply the sentiment
lexicon-related rules. The following emoticons
are considered to be positive: :) , (: , ;) ,
:-) , (-: , :D , :-D , :P , :-P . While, the
following emoticons are considered to be neg-
ative: :( , ): , ;( , :-( , )-: , D: ,
D-: , :’( , :’-( , )’: , )-’: .

• Sentiment Lexicon-related Rules: The Bing
Liu lexicon, the NRC Emotion lexicon, and
SentiWordNet are used as resources for posi-
tive and negative opinion words. If a tweet con-
tains more than two positive words, and no
negation or negative words from either of the
lexicons, it is classified as positive. If a tweet
contains more than two negative words, and
no negation or positive words from either of the
lexicons, it is classified as negative. If none of
the above rules apply, the tweet is classified as
unknown.

2.3 Combining the Classifiers

After developing the rule-based classifier and train-
ing the SVM, we combine the them to refine the
SVM’s predictions. Since, our goal is to maximise
positive and negative precision and recall, we use
the rule-based classifier to correct or verify the “neu-
tral” SVM predictions. So, for every tweet labeled
as neutral by the SVM, we consider the predictions
of the rule-based layer as the final labels.

3 Experiments and Results

We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on
9418 tweets allowed to be used for training pur-
poses. The results we submitted to SemEval
2015 were yielded by using all SVM features and
emoticon-related rules. The sentiment lexicon-
related rules were implemented later, and thus could
not be used for the official submission. Table 2
shows the official test results for SemEval 2015.

Table 1 reports the results of a feature abla-
tion study carried out by testing the SVM classi-
fier on 3204 development tweets (from SemEval
2013) not included in the training data. These are
cross-validation results obtained using the hold-out
method.This study helps us understand the impor-
tance of different features. From the table, we can
see that the word and character n-grams features are
the most useful, followed by negation and then the
rest. All sentiment lexicon related features appear to
have similar importance, but we get the best F-score
when we append them all to the feature vector.

Features Fpn Classification Rate (%)
All Features 66.2 71.5
All Features and Rules 66.7 72.3

Table 3: Comparison between the results obtained using
SVM alone, and using SVM with a rule-based layer.

Since, using all the previously described features
gives the best SVM predictions, we add the rule-

based classification layer to a SVM trained on all
features. Table 3 compares the results obtained us-
ing the SVM alone with the results obtained using
SVM along with all the rules (emoticon and lexicon-
based) specified in section 2.2. We observe that the
F-score further increases by around half a unit and
the classification rate2 increases by around 0.8.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we described a sentiment analysis sys-
tem developed by combining a SVM with a rule-
based classification layer. Even though we do not
get the best scores, we find that a rule-based clas-
sification layer can indeed refine the SVM’s predic-
tions. We also devise creative twitter-specific, nega-
tion and lexicon-related features for the SVM, and
demonstrate how they improve the sentiment analy-
sis system. In future, we aim to use enriched senti-
ment and emotion lists like the ones used by (Poria et
al., 2012). We would also like to experiment with re-
fining the SVM’s predictions using more rules based
on complex semantics.
