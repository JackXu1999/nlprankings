Abstract

Selectional Preference (SP) is a commonly ob-
served language phenomenon and proved to
be useful in many natural language processing
tasks. To provide a better evaluation method
for SP models, we introduce SP-10K, a large-
scale evaluation set that provides human rat-
ings for the plausibility of 10,000 SP pairs
over five SP relations, covering 2,500 most fre-
quent verbs, nouns, and adjectives in Ameri-
can English. Three representative SP acquisi-
tion methods based on pseudo-disambiguation
are evaluated with SP-10K. To demonstrate
the importance of our dataset, we investi-
gate the relationship between SP-10K and the
commonsense knowledge in ConceptNet5 and
show the potential of using SP to represent
the commonsense knowledge. We also use the
Winograd Schema Challenge to prove that the
proposed new SP relations are essential for the
hard pronoun coreference resolution problem.

1 Introduction

Selectional Preference (SP) is a common phe-
nomenon in human language that has been shown
to be related to semantics (Wilks, 1975). Here by
SP we mean that, given a word and a dependency
relation, human beings have preferences for which
words are likely to be connected. For instance,
when seeing the verb ‘sing’, it is highly plausi-
ble that its object is ‘a song’, and when seeing the
noun ‘air’, it is highly plausible that its modifier is
‘fresh’.

SP has been shown to be useful over a variety
of tasks including sense disambiguation (Resnik,
1997), semantic role classification (Zapirain et al.,
2013), coreference clustering (Hobbs, 1978; Inoue
et al., 2016; Heinzerling et al., 2017), and ma-
chine translation (Tang et al., 2016). Given the
importance of SP, the automatic acquisition of SP
has become a well-known research subject in the

NLP community. However, current SP acquisition
models are limited based on existing evaluation
methods. We discuss two broadly used evalua-
tion methods, human-labeled evaluation sets and
the pseudo-disambiguation task.

First, the most straightforward way to evalu-
ate SP models is by asking human annotators.
McRae et al. (1998), Keller and Lapata (2003),
and Padó et al. (2006) proposed human-labeled
SP evaluation sets containing hundreds of SP pairs
(numbers are shown in Table 1). However, these
datasets are too small to cover the diversity of the
SP task adequately. Moreover, they only consid-
ered one-hop relations, such as ‘verb-object’ and
‘modifier-noun’ pairs. Aside from these relations,
we believe that higher-order dependency relations
may also reflect meaningful commonsense knowl-
edge. Consider the following two examples of
hard pronoun resolution problems from the Wino-
grad Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011):

• (A) The fish ate the worm. It was hungry.

• (B) The fish ate the worm. It was tasty.

In (A), we can resolve ‘it’ to ‘the fish’ because it
is more plausible that the subject of the verb ‘eat’
is hungry. On the other hand, for (B), we can re-
solve ‘it’ to ‘the worm’ because it is more likely
that the object of the verb ‘eat’ is tasty. The above
examples reflect the preferences between two two-
hop dependency relations: ‘verb-object-modifier’



723

and ‘verb-subject-modifier’, which have not been
investigated in previous works.

Second, pseudo-disambiguation has been a pop-
ular alternative evaluation method for the SP ac-
quisition task (Ritter et al., 2010; de Cruys, 2014).
This way of SP acquisition trains a model based
on pairs from a training corpus as positive exam-
ples and randomly generates fake pairs as negative
examples, and then evaluates the model based on
its ability on a test corpus by constructing posi-
tive and negative examples in the same way. How-
ever, the pseudo-disambiguation task only evalu-
ates how well a model fits the data, which could
be biased. The problem is that changing the cor-
pus of training and testing may result in different
conclusions. Thus, it is less robust than collecting
SP pairs by asking expert annotators as (McRae
et al., 1998), (Keller and Lapata, 2003), and (Padó
et al., 2006), or even asking many ordinary people
to vote for a commonsense agreement.

The problems of these methods motivate the
creation of a large-scale human-labeled SP eval-
uation set based on crowdsourcing, which can be
used as the ground truth for the SP acquisition
task.

In this paper, we present SP-10K, which is un-
precedented in both size and the number of SP
relations. It contains 10,000 selectional triplets
consisting of 2,500 frequent verbs, nouns, and
adjectives in American English. Besides com-
monly used one-hop SP relations (‘dobj’, ‘nsubj’,
and ‘amod’), we introduce two novel two-hop SP
relations (‘dobj amod’ and ‘nsubj amod’). We
first evaluate three representative SP acquisition
methods using SP-10K and compare the capac-
ity of the state-of-the-art pseudo-disambiguation
approaches. We then show the relationship be-
tween SP-10K and commonsense knowledge us-
ing ConceptNet5 (Speer and Havasi, 2012) to
demonstrate the potential of using SP to rep-
resent commonsense knowledge. Finally, we
use a subset of the Winograd Schema Chal-
lenge (Levesque et al., 2011) to prove that the
proposed two-hop SP relations are essential for
the hard pronoun coreference resolution. SP-
10K is available at: https://github.com/
HKUST-KnowComp/SP-10K.

2 Design of SP-10K

As discussed in (Hill et al., 2015), a high-quality
evaluation resource should be: (1) clearly defined;

(2) representative; and (3) consistent and reliable.
First, similar to existing human-labeled SP eval-

uation sets (McRae et al., 1998; Keller and Lapata,
2003; Padó et al., 2006), SP-10K uses the plausi-
bility of selectional pairs as the annotation. Hence,
SP-10K is clearly defined. Second, compared to
these existing evaluation sets, as shown in Table 1,
SP-10K covers a larger number of relations and
SP pairs, making it a more representative evalua-
tion set. Finally, as discussed in Section 3.4, the
annotation of SP-10K is consistent and reliable.

2.1 Selectional Relations

Traditionally, the study of SP has focused on three
selectional relations: verb-subject, verb-object,
and noun-adjective. As demonstrated in Section 1,
some verbs have a preference for the properties
of their subjects and objects. For example, it is
plausible to say that the subject of ‘eat’ is hun-
gry and the object of ‘eat’ is tasty, but not the
other way round. To capture such preferences,
we propose two novel two-hop dependency rela-
tions, ‘dobj amod’ and ‘nsubj amod’. Examples
of these relations are presented in Table 2. In to-
tal, SP-10K contains five SP relations.

Following previous approaches (McRae et al.,
1998; Padó et al., 2006), for the ‘dobj’ and ‘nsubj’
relations, we take a verb as the head and a noun
as the dependent. Similarly, for ‘dobj amod’ and
‘nsubj amod’ relations, we take a verb as the head
and an adjective as the dependent. Moreover, for
the ‘amod’ relation, we take a noun as the head
and an adjective as the dependent.

2.2 Candidate SP Pairs

The selected vocabulary consists of 2,500 verbs,
nouns, and adjectives from the 5,000 most fre-
quent words1 in the Corpus of Contemporary
American English.

For each SP relation, we provide two types of
SP pairs for our annotators to label: frequent pairs
and random pairs. For each selectional relation,
we first select the 500 most frequent heads. We
then match each head with its two most frequently-
paired dependents, as well as two randomly se-
lected dependents from our vocabulary. As such,
we retrieve 2,000 pairs for each relation. Alto-
gether, we retrieve 10,000 pairs for five selectional
relations. These pairs are composed of 500 verbs,

1,343 nouns, and 657 adjectives. Examples of
sampled pairs are presented in Table 2.

3 Annotation of SP Pairs

We employ the Amazon Mechanical Turk plat-
form (MTurk) for our annotations.2

3.1 Survey Design

Following the SimLex-999 annotation guide-
lines (Hill et al., 2015), we invite at least 11 anno-
tators to score each SP pair. We divide our 10,000
pairs into 100 surveys. Each survey contains 103
questions, three of which are checkpoint questions
selected from the examples to control the labeling
quality. Within a survey, all the questions are de-
rived from the same selectional relation to improve
the efficiency of survey completion.

Each survey consists of three parts. We begin
by explaining the task to the annotators, including
how to deal with the special case like multi-word
expressions. Then, we present three examples to
help the annotators better understand the task. Fi-
nally, we ask questions using the following tem-
plates (VERB, ADJ, and NOUN are place holders
and will be replaced with the corresponding heads
and dependents in the actual surveys.):

• dobj: How suitable do you think it is if we use
NOUN as the object of the verb VERB?

• nsubj: How suitable do you think it is if we use
NOUN as the subject of the verb VERB?

2According to (Peer et al., 2017), Amazon MTurk
(https://www.mturk.com/) has the largest worker population
and highest annotation quality compared to other crowd-
sourcing services.

Figure 1: Average annotation time per 100 questions.
‘m’ indicates minutes and ‘s’ indicates seconds.

• amod: How suitable do you think it is if we use
ADJ to describe the noun NOUN?

• dobj amod: How suitable do you think it is if
we use ADJ to describe the object of the verb
VERB?

• nsubj amod: How suitable do you think it is if
we use ADJ to describe the subject of the verb
VERB?

For each question, the annotator is asked to se-
lect one of the following options: Perfectly match
(5), Make sense (4), Normal (3), Seems weird (2),
It’s not applicable at all (1). We randomize the or-
der of frequent and random pairs to prevent anno-
tators from simply memorizing the question order.

3.2 Participants and Annotation

We require that our annotators are ‘Master Work-
ers’, indicating reliable annotation records3, and
that our annotators are either native English speak-
ers or currently live and/or work in English-
speaking locales. Based on these criteria, we
identified 125 valid annotators. These annota-
tors produced 130,575 ratings for a total cost
of USD1,182.80. We support the multiple par-
ticipation of annotators by ensuring that subse-
quent surveys are generated with their previously-
unanswered questions.

From our annotation statistics, we notice that
different selectional relations take different time
to annotate. As shown in Figure 1, the annota-
tors spent the least time on the ‘amod’ relation,
suggesting that the modifying relation is relatively
easy to understand and judge. Another interesting
finding is that the annotators spend more time on
relations involving subjects than those involving
objects, which is consistent with the observation
proposed by (Jackendoff, 1992) that verbs have
clearer preferences for objects than subjects.

for nsubj amod.

3.3 Post-processing
We excluded ratings from annotators who (1) pro-
vided incorrect answers to any of the checkpoint
questions or (2) demonstrated suspicious annota-
tion patterns (e.g., marking all pairs as ‘normal’).
After excluding based on this criteria, we obtained
100,532 valid annotations with an overall accep-
tance rate of 77%. We calculate the plausibility
for each SP pair by taking the average rating for
the pair over all (at least 10) valid annotations,
then linearly scaling this average from the 1-5 to
0-10 interval. This approach is similar to the post-
processing in (Hill et al., 2015). We present a sam-
ple of SP pairs in Table 3. Some of the pairs are
interesting. For example, for the dobj amod rela-
tion, annotators agree that lifting a heavy object is
a usually used expression, while earning a rubber
object is rare.

3.4 Inner-Annotator Agreement
Following standard practices from previous
datasets WSIM-203 (Reisinger and Mooney,
2010) and Simlex-999 (Hill et al., 2015), we
employ Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA), which

computes the average correlation of an annotator
with the average of all the other annotators,
to evaluate the overall annotation quality. As
presented in Table 4, the overall IAA of SP-10K is
ρ = 0.75, which is comparable to existing datasets
WSIM-203 (0.65) and Simlex-999 (0.78).

Unsurprisingly, the IAA is not uniform across
different SP relations. As shown in Table 4, com-
plicated two-hop SP relations are more challeng-
ing and achieve relatively lower correlations than
the simpler one-hop relations. This experimen-
tal result shows that two-hop relations are more
difficult than one-hop SP relations. We also no-
tice that the agreements among annotators for SP
relations involving the subjects of verbs are rela-
tively low. The above observations are consistent
with our earlier discussion on annotation time, and
further support the claim that verbs have stronger
preferences for their objects than their subjects.

4 Evaluation of SP Acquisition Methods

To show the performance of existing SP acquisi-
tion methods and demonstrate the effect of dif-
ferent training corpora, we evaluate representative
SP acquisition methods on SP-10K with following
training corpora:

(1) Wiki: Wikipedia is the largest free knowl-
edge dataset. For this experiment, we select the
English version of Wikipedia4 and filter out pages

containing fewer than 100 tokens and fewer than
five hyperlinks. After filtering, our dataset con-
tains over three million Wikipedia pages.

(2) Yelp: Yelp is a social media platform where
users can write reviews for businesses, e.g., restau-
rants, hotels, etc. The latest release of the Yelp
dataset5 contains over five million reviews.

(3) New York Times (NYT): The NYT (Sand-
haus and Evan, 2008) dataset contains over 1.8
million news articles from the NYT throughout 20
years (1987 - 2007).

We parsed these raw corpora using the Stanford
dependency parser (Schuster and Manning, 2016).
Detailed statistics are shown in Table 5.

4.1 Methods
We now introduce SP acquisition methods.

Posterior Probability (PP): Resnik (1997)
proposes PP as a means of acquiring SP knowl-
edge from raw corpora. Given a head h, a relation
r, and a dependent d, PP uses the following prob-
ability to predict the plausibility:

Pr(d|h) =
Cr(h, d)

Cr(h)
, (1)

where Cr(h) and Cr(h, d) mean how many times
p and the head-dependent pair (h, d) appear in the
relation r respectively.

Distributional Similarity (DS): Erk et al.
(2010) describes a method that uses corpus-driven
DS metrics for the induction of SP. Given a head
h, a relation r, and a dependent d, DS uses the
following equation to predict the plausibility:

S(h, r, d) =
∑

d′∈Or,h

w(d, d′)

Zr,h
· s(d, d′), (2)

where Or,h is the set of dependents that have been
attested with head p and relation r, w(d, d′) is the
weight function, and Zr,h is the normalization fac-
tor. We use the frequency of a pair of (h, d′) as

5https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

the weighting function and the cosine similarity of
their GloVe embedding (Pennington et al., 2014)
as the similarity function s(d, d′), given the rela-
tive popularity of these embeddings.

Neural Network (NN): de Cruys (2014) pro-
poses a NN-based method for the SP acquisition
task. The main framework is a two-layer fully-
connected NN. For each SP pair (h, d), the frame-
work uses the concatenation of embeddings [vh,
vd] as the input to the NN, where vh, vd are ran-
domly initialized word embeddings for words h
and d respectively. The ranking-loss (Collobert
and Weston, 2008) is used as the training objec-
tive, where positive examples consist of all the
SP pairs in the corpus and negative examples are
randomly generated. During the training process,
both model parameters and embeddings are jointly
updated. We use the original paper’s experimental
setting to conduct our experiment.

4.2 Results and Analysis

We report the average Spearman ρ in Table 6 as
our performance measure. We have following in-
teresting observations.

(1) Choice of training corpus can influence the
SP acquisition models. For the same method, the
general corpora, i.e., Wiki and NYT, outperform
the domain specific corpus, i.e., Yelp. Yelp per-
forms best on the ‘dobj’ relation and comparably
on the ‘dobj amod’ relation, which indicates the
language use on Yelp may better reflect the plau-
sibility of objects rather than of subjects.

(2) As reported by (de Cruys, 2014), the NN-
based method performs very well on the pseudo-
disambiguation task. However, this method
has limited effectiveness on our dataset, which
shows that pseudo-disambiguation cannot effec-
tively represent ground truth SP. This further
demonstrates the value of SP-10K as an evaluation
set of SP acquisition.

(3) The overall performance of existing meth-
ods is quite lackluster, suggesting that these mod-
els insufficiently address the SP acquisition task.
We hope that the release of our dataset will mo-
tivate efforts at deriving knowledge from SP and
exploring the SP acquisition task.

5 SP and Commonsense Knowledge

In this section, we quantitatively analyze the re-
lationship between SP and commonsense knowl-
edge. Currently, the largest commonsense knowl-

edge dataset is the Open Mind Common Sense
(OMCS) from the ConceptNet 5 (Speer and
Havasi, 2012) knowledge base. The OMCS con-
tains 600k crowdsourced commonsense triplets
such as (food, UsedFor, eat) and (wind, Capa-
bleOf, blow to east). All of the relations in OMCS
are human-defined. In comparison, SP only re-
lies on naturally occurring dependency relations,
which can be accurately identified using existing
parsing tools (Schuster and Manning, 2016).

We aim to demonstrate how SP related to com-
monsense knowledge. Building relationships be-
tween SP and human-defined relations has two ad-
vantages: (1) We may be able to directly acquire
commonsense knowledge through SP acquisition
techniques. (2) We may be able solve common-
sense reasoning tasks from the perspective of SP,
as illustrated through the two Winograd examples
in Section 1. These advantages motivate explor-
ing the potential of using SP to represent common-
sense knowledge.

5.1 SP Pairs and OMCS Triplets

We hypothesize that the plausibility of an SP pair
relates to how closely the pair aligns with hu-
man commonsense knowledge. As such, the more
plausible pairs in SP-10K should be more likely to
be covered by the OMCS dataset.

Using plausibility as our criterion, we split the
10,000 SP pairs into five groups: Perfect (8-10),
Good (6-8), Normal (4-6), Unusual (2-4), and Im-
possible (0-2). As OMCS triplets contain phrases
and SP pairs only contain words, we use two meth-
ods to match SP pairs with OMCS triplets. (1)
Exact Match: we identify triplets in OMCS where

Group #Pairs #Exact Match #Partial Match
(Percentage) (Percentage)

Perfect 755 85 (11.26%) 287 (38.01%)
Good 2,600 67 (2.58%) 885 (34.04%)

Normal 2,809 20 (0.71%) 504 (17.94%)
Unusual 2,396 6 (0.25%) 187 (7.80%)

Impossible 1,440 5 (0.35%) 82 (5.69%)

Table 7: Matching statistics of SP pairs by plausibility.

the two dependents are exactly the same as the two
words in an SP pair. (2) Partial Match: we iden-
tify triplets in OMCS where the two dependents
contain the two words in an SP pair. We count SP
pairs that fulfill either of these matching methods
as covered by OMCS. Note that exact matches are
not double-counted as partial matches.

As shown in Table 7, almost 50% of SP pairs in
the perfect group are covered by OMCS. In con-
trast, only about 6% of SP pairs from the impossi-
ble group are covered. More plausible selectional
preference pairs are more likely to be covered by
OMCS, which supports our hypothesis of more
plausible SP pairs being more closely aligned with
human commonsense knowledge.

5.2 SP and Human-defined Relations

To show the connection between SP relations and
human-defined relations, we visualize all match-
ing (SP pair, OMCS triplet) tuples in Figure 2. A
darker color indicates a greater number of matched
tuples, which in turn suggests a stronger connec-
tion between the two relations.

We observe some clear and reasonable matches
such as (‘dobj’, ‘UsedFor’), (‘nsubj’, ‘Capa-
bleOf’), and (‘amod’, ‘HasProperty’), which

demonstrates that some simple human-defined
relations like ‘UsedFor’, ‘CapableOf’, and
‘HasProperty’ are related to corresponding SP
relations. We also notice that the five SP relations
in SP-10K seldom match some OMCS relations
such as ‘HasA’ and ‘HasSubevent’, which indi-
cates a need for additional SP relations or even the
combination of different SP relations. We leave it
for our future work.

5.3 Case Study

We present a selection of covered pairs from the
perfect and impossible groups in Table 8. For the
perfect group, we find that human-defined com-
monsense triplets often have neatly corresponding
SP pairs. On the other hand, for the impossible
group, SP pairs are covered by OMCS either be-
cause of incidental overlap with a non-keyword,
e.g., ‘child’ in ‘child wagon’, or because of the
low quality of some OMCS triplets. This further
illustrates that OMCS still has room for improve-
ment and that SP may provide an effective way to
improve commonsense knowledge.

6 Importance of Multi-hop SP

As introduced in Section 1, one novel contribu-
tion of this paper is the two-hop Selectional Pref-
erence relations: ‘nsubj amod’ and ‘dobj amod’.
To demonstrate their effectiveness, we select
a subset6 of the Winograd Schema Challenge
dataset (Levesque et al., 2011), which leverages
the two-hop selectional preference knowledge to
solve. In total, we have 72 questions out of overall
285 questions. The selected Winograd question is
defined as follows: Given one sentence s contain-
ing two candidates (n1, n2) and one pronoun p,
which is described with one adjective a, we need
to find which candidate is the pronoun referring to.
One example is as follows:

• Jim yelled at Kevin because he was so upset.

We need to correctly finds out he refers to Jim

16, 19, 20, 35, 36, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 51, 52, 71, 72, 73,

rather than Kevin. These tasks are quite chal-
lenging as both the Stanford coreNLP coreference
system and the current state-of-the-art end-to-end
coreference model (Lee et al., 2018) cannot solve
them. To solve that problem from the perspective
of selectional preference (SP), we first parse the
sentence and get the dependency relations related
to the two candidates. If they appear as the subject
or the object of the verb h, we will then check the
SP score of the head-dependent pair (h, d) on rela-
tions ‘nsubj amod’ and ‘dobj amod’ respectively.
After that, we compare the SP score of two can-
didates and select the higher one as the prediction
result. If they have the same SP score, we will
make no prediction.

We show the result of collected human-labeled
data in ‘SP-10K’ and the best-performed model,
Posterior Probability (PP), trained with Wikipedia
corpus in Table 9. From the result, we can see
that ‘SP-10K’ can solve that problem with very
high precision. But as we only label 4,000 multi-
hop pairs, the overall coverage is limited. On the
other hand, automatic SP acquisition method PP
can cover more questions, but the precision also
drops due to the noise of the collected SP knowl-
edge. The experimental result shows that if we can
automatically build a good multi-hop SP model,
we could make some steps towards solving the
hard pronoun coreference task, which is viewed
a vital task of natural language understanding.

7 Related Work

As one important language phenomenon, SP is
considered related to the Semantics Fit (McRae
et al., 1998) and has been proved helpful in
a series of downstream tasks including ma-
chine translation (Tang et al., 2016), sense dis-
ambiguation (Resnik, 1997), coreference resolu-
tion (Hobbs, 1978; Inoue et al., 2016; Zhang and

Song, 2018), and semantic role classification (Za-
pirain et al., 2013).

Several algorithms attempt to acquire SP auto-
matically from raw corpora (Resnik, 1997; Rooth
et al., 1999; Erk et al., 2010; Santus et al., 2017).
However, (Mechura, 2008) reveals that creating a
high-quality SP model is difficult due to the nois-
iness and ambiguity of raw corpora. Several ap-
proaches attempt to address this issue by applying
state-of-the-art word embeddings and neural net-
works to the automatic acquisition of SP (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014; de Cruys, 2014). Despite
these efforts, the quality of learned SP models re-
mains questionable due to the shortcomings of ex-
isting SP acquisition evaluation methods.

Currently, the most popular evaluation
method for SP acquisition is the pseudo-
disambiguation (Ritter et al., 2010; de Cruys,
2014). However, pseudo-disambiguation can
be easily influenced by the aforementioned
noisiness of evaluation corpora and cannot
represent ground truth SP. Experiments in this
paper prove that the model performs well on the
pseudo-disambiguation task may not correlate
well with the human-labeled ground truth. As for
the ground truth, there are three human-labeled
ground truth SP evaluation sets (McRae et al.,
1998; Keller and Lapata, 2003; Padó et al., 2006).
These evaluation sets score SP pairs based on their
plausibility as determined by human evaluators.
However, these datasets are of small sizes. Com-
pared to current evaluation methods, SP-10K is
a human-annotated large-scale evaluation set and
contains 10,000 SP pairs over five SP relations.

8 Conclusion

In this work, we present SP-10K, a large-scale
human-labeled evaluation set for selectional pref-
erence. Compared with other evaluation methods,
SP-10K has much larger coverage and can better
represent ground truth SP. Two novel two-hop SP
relations ‘dobj amod’ and ‘nsubj amod’ are also
introduced. We evaluate three representative SP
acquisition methods with our dataset. After that,
we demonstrate the potential of using SP to repre-
sent commonsense knowledge, which can be ben-
eficial for the acquisition and application of com-
monsense knowledge. In the end, we demonstrate
the importance of the two-hop relations with a sub-
set of the Winograd Schema Challenge.
