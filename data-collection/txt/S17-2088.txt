Abstract

This paper describes the fifth year of
the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task.
SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a
rerun of the subtasks of SemEval-2016
Task 4, which include identifying the over-
all sentiment of the tweet, sentiment to-
wards a topic with classification on a two-
point and on a five-point ordinal scale, and
quantification of the distribution of sen-
timent towards a topic across a number
of tweets: again on a two-point and on
a five-point ordinal scale. Compared to
2016, we made two changes: (i) we in-
troduced a new language, Arabic, for all
subtasks, and (ii) we made available in-
formation from the profiles of the Twitter
users who posted the target tweets. The
task continues to be very popular, with a
total of 48 teams participating this year.

1 Introduction

The identification of sentiment in text is an im-
portant field of study, with social media plat-
forms such as Twitter garnering the interest of re-
searchers in language processing as well as in po-
litical and social sciences. The task usually in-
volves detecting whether a piece of text expresses
a POSITIVE, a NEGATIVE, or a NEUTRAL senti-
ment; the sentiment can be general or about a spe-
cific topic, e.g., a person, a product, or an event.

The Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task has been
run yearly at SemEval since 2013 (Nakov et al.,
2013; Rosenthal et al., 2014; Nakov et al., 2016b),
with the 2015 task introducing sentiment towards
a topic (Rosenthal et al., 2015) and the 2016 task
introducing tweet quantification and five-point or-
dinal classification (Nakov et al., 2016a).

SemEval is the International Workshop on Seman-
tic Evaluation, formerly SensEval. It is an on-
going series of evaluations of computational se-
mantic analysis systems, organized under the um-
brella of SIGLEX, the Special Interest Group on
the Lexicon of the Association for Computational
Linguistics. Other related tasks at SemEval have
explored sentiment analysis of product review and
their aspects (Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015, 2016),
sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twit-
ter (Ghosh et al., 2015), implicit event polarity
(Russo et al., 2015), detecting stance in tweets
(Mohammad et al., 2016a), out-of-context senti-
ment intensity of words and phrases (Kiritchenko
et al., 2016), and emotion detection (Strapparava
and Mihalcea, 2007). Some of these tasks fea-
tured languages other than English, such as Arabic
(Pontiki et al., 2016; Mohammad et al., 2016a);
however, they did not target tweets, nor did they
focus on sentiment towards a topic.

This year, we performed a re-run of the subtasks
in SemEval-2016 Task 4, which, in addition to the
overall sentiment of a tweet, featured classifica-
tion, ordinal regression, and quantification with
respect to a topic. Furthermore, we introduced a
new language, Arabic. Finally, we made avail-
able to the participants demographic information
about the users who posted the tweets, which we
extracted from the respective public profiles.

Ordinal Classification As last year, SemEval-
2017 Task 4 includes sentiment analysis on a five-
point scale {HIGHLYPOSITIVE, POSITIVE, NEU-
TRAL, NEGATIVE, HIGHLYNEGATIVE}, which is
in line with product ratings occurring in the corpo-
rate world, e.g., Amazon, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.
In machine learning terms, moving from a categor-
ical two-point scale to an ordered five-point scale
means moving from binary to ordinal classifica-
tion (aka ordinal regression).

Tweet Quantification SemEval-2017 Task 4 in-
cludes tweet quantification tasks along with tweet
classification tasks, also on 2-point and 5-point
scales. While the tweet classification task is con-
cerned with whether a specific tweet expresses a
given sentiment towards a topic, the tweet quan-
tification task looks at estimating the distribu-
tion of tweets about a given topic across the
different sentiment classes. Most (if not all)
tweet sentiment classification studies within polit-
ical science (Borge-Holthoefer et al., 2015; Kaya
et al., 2013; Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers,
2012), economics (Bollen et al., 2011; O’Connor
et al., 2010), social science (Dodds et al., 2011),
and market research (Burton and Soboleva, 2011;
Qureshi et al., 2013), study Twitter with an inter-
est in aggregate statistics about sentiment and are
not interested in the sentiment expressed in indi-
vidual tweets. We should also note that quantifica-
tion is not a mere byproduct of classification, as it
can be addressed using different approaches and it
also needs different evaluation measures (Forman,
2008; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2015).

Analysis in Arabic This year, we added a new
language, Arabic, in order to encourage partici-
pants to experiment with multilingual and cross-
lingual approaches for sentiment analysis. Our ob-
jective was to expand the Twitter sentiment anal-
ysis resources available to the research commu-
nity, not only for general multilingual sentiment
analysis, but also for multilingual sentiment anal-
ysis towards a topic, which is still a largely un-
explored research direction for many languages
and in particular for morphologically complex lan-
guages such as Arabic.

Arabic has become an emergent language for
sentiment analysis, especially as more resources
and tools for it have recently become available. It
is also both interesting and challenging due to its
rich morphology and abundance of dialectal use in
Twitter. Early Arabic studies focused on sentiment
analysis in newswire (Abdul-Mageed and Diab,
2011; Elarnaoty et al., 2012), but recently there
has been a lot more work on social media, espe-
cially Twitter (Mourad and Darwish, 2013; Abdul-
Mageed et al., 2014; Refaee and Rieser, 2014;
Salameh et al., 2015), where the challenges of sen-
timent analysis are compounded by the presence
of multiple dialects and orthographical variants,
which are frequently used in conjunction with the
formal written language.

Some work studied the utility of machine trans-
lation for sentiment analysis of Arabic texts
(Salameh et al., 2015; Mohammad et al., 2016b;
Refaee and Rieser, 2015), identification of senti-
ment holders (Elarnaoty et al., 2012), and senti-
ment targets (Al-Smadi et al., 2015; Farra et al.,
2015; Farra and McKeown, 2017). We believe
that the development of a standard Arabic Twit-
ter dataset for sentiment, and particularly with re-
spect to topics, will encourage further research in
this regard.

User Information Demographic information in
Twitter has been studied and analyzed using net-
work analysis and natural language processing
(NLP) techniques (Mislove et al., 2011; Nguyen
et al., 2013; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2016). Re-
cent work has shown that user information and in-
formation from the network can help sentiment
analysis in other corpora (Hovy, 2015) and in
Twitter (Volkova et al., 2013; Yang and Eisenstein,
2015). Thus, this year we encouraged participants
to use information from the public profiles of Twit-
ter users such as demographics (e.g., age, location)
as well as information from the rest of the social
network (e.g., sentiment of the tweets of friends),
with the goal of analyzing the impact of this infor-
mation on improving sentiment analysis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents in more detail the five subtasks
of SemEval-2017 Task 4. Section 3 describes the
English and the Arabic datasets and how we cre-
ated them. Section 4 introduces and motivates the
evaluation measures for each subtask. Section 5
presents the results of the evaluation and discusses
the techniques and the tools that the participants
used. Finally, Section 6 concludes and points to
some possible directions for future work.

2 Task Definition

SemEval-2017 Task 4 consists of five subtasks,
each offered for both Arabic and English:

1. Subtask A: Given a tweet, decide whether
it expresses POSITIVE, NEGATIVE or NEU-
TRAL sentiment.

2. Subtask B: Given a tweet and a topic, clas-
sify the sentiment conveyed towards that
topic on a two-point scale: POSITIVE vs.
NEGATIVE.

503



3. Subtask C: Given a tweet and a topic,
classify the sentiment conveyed in the
tweet towards that topic on a five-point
scale: STRONGLYPOSITIVE, WEAKLYPOS-
ITIVE, NEUTRAL, WEAKLYNEGATIVE, and
STRONGLYNEGATIVE.

4. Subtask D: Given a set of tweets about
a topic, estimate the distribution of tweets
across the POSITIVE and NEGATIVE classes.

5. Subtask E: Given a set of tweets about a
topic, estimate the distribution of tweets
across the five classes: STRONGLYPOS-
ITIVE, WEAKLYPOSITIVE, NEUTRAL,
WEAKLYNEGATIVE, and STRONGLYNEG-
ATIVE.

Languages: English and Arabic

Table 1: Summary of the subtasks.

Each subtask is run for both English and Arabic.
Subtask A has been run in all previous editions of
the task and continues to be the most popular one
(see section 5.) Subtasks B-E have all been run at
SemEval-2016 Task 4 (Nakov et al., 2016a), with
variants running in 2015 (Rosenthal et al., 2015).
Table 1 shows a summary of the subtasks.

3 Datasets

Our datasets consist of tweets annotated for sen-
timent on a 2-point, 3-point, and 5-point scales.
We made available to participants all the data from
previous years (Nakov et al., 2016a) for the En-
glish training sets, and we collected new training
data for Arabic, as well as new test sets for both
English and Arabic. The annotation scheme re-
mained the same as last year (Nakov et al., 2016a),
with the key new contribution being to apply the
task and instructions to Arabic as well as provid-
ing a script to download basic user information.
All annotations were performed on CrowdFlower.
Note that we release all our datasets to the research
community to be used freely beyond SemEval.

3.1 Tweet Collection

We chose English and Arabic topics based on pop-
ular current events that were trending on Twit-
ter, both internationally and in specific Arabic-
speaking countries, using local and global Twitter
trends.1 The topics included a range of named en-
tities (e.g., Donald Trump, iPhone), geopolitical
entities (e.g., Aleppo, Palestine), and other entities
(e.g., Syrian refugees, Dakota Access Pipeline,
Western media, gun control, and vegetarianism).
We then used the Twitter API to download tweets,
along with corresponding user information, con-
taining mentions of these topics in the specified
language. We intentionally chose to use some
overlapping topics between the two languages in
order to encourage cross-language approaches.

We automatically filtered the tweets for dupli-
cates and we removed those for which the bag-of-
words cosine similarity exceeded 0.6. We then re-
tained only the topics for which at least 100 tweets
remained. The training tweets for Arabic were
collected over the period of September-November
2016 and all test tweets were collected over the
period of December 2016-January 2017.

For both English and Arabic, the topics for the
test dataset were different from those in the train-
ing and in the development datasets.

3.2 Annotation using CrowdFlower

We used CrowdFlower to annotate the new train-
ing and testing tweets. The annotators were asked
to indicate the overall polarity of the tweet (on a
five-point scale) as well as the polarity of the tweet
towards the given target topic (again, on a five-
point scale), as described in (Nakov et al., 2016a).
We also provided additional examples, some of
which are shown in Tables 2 and 3. In particu-
lar, we stressed that topic-level positive or negative
sentiment needed to express an opinion about the
topic itself rather than about a positive or a nega-
tive event occurring in the context of the topic (see
for example, the third row of Table 3).

Each tweet was annotated by at least five peo-
ple, and we created many hidden tests for qual-
ity control, which we used to reject annotations
by contributors who missed a large number of the
hidden tests. We also created pilot runs, which
helped us adjust the annotation instructions until
we found, based on manual inspection, the quality
of the annotated tweets to be satisfactory.

Table 3: Some Arabic example annotations that we provided to the annotators.

For Arabic, the contributors tended to annotate
somewhat conservatively, and thus a very small
number of HIGHLYPOSITIVE and HIGHLYNEG-
ATIVE annotations were consolidated, despite us
having provided examples of such annotations.

3.3 Consolidating the Annotations
As the annotations are on a five-point scale, where
the expected agreement is lower, we used a two-
step procedure. If three out of the five annotators
agreed on a label, we accepted the label. Oth-
erwise, we first mapped the categorical labels to
the integer values −2, −1, 0, 1, 2. Then we
calculated the average, and finally we mapped
that average to the closest integer value. In or-
der to counter-balance the tendency of the aver-
age to stay away from the extreme values −2 and
2, and also to prefer 0, we did not use round-
ing at ±0.5 and ±1.5, but at ±0.4 and ±1.4 in-
stead. Finally, note that the values −2, −1, 0, 1,
2 are to be interpreted as STRONGLYNEGATIVE,
WEAKLYNEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, WEAKLYPOSI-
TIVE, and STRONGLYPOSITIVE, respectively.

3.4 Data Statistics
The English training and development data this
year consisted of the data from all previous edi-
tions of this task (Nakov et al., 2013; Rosenthal
et al., 2014, 2015; Nakov et al., 2016b). Unlike in
previous years, we did not set aside data to assess
progress compared to prior years. Therefore, we
allowed all data to be used for training and devel-
opment.

For evaluation, we used the newly-created data de-
scribed in the previous subsection. Tables 4 and 5
show the statistics for the English and Arabic data.
For English, we only show the aggregate statis-
tics for the training data; the breakdown from prior
years can be found in (Nakov et al., 2016a). Note
that the same tweets were annotated for multiple
subtasks, so there is overlap between the tweets
across the tasks. Duplicates may have occurred
where the same tweet was extracted for multiple
topics.

As Arabic is a new language this year, we cre-
ated for it a default train-development split of
the Arabic data for the participants to use if they
wished to do so.

3.5 Data Distribution

As in previous years, we provided the participants
with a script2 to download the training tweets
given IDs. In addition, this year we also included
in the script the option to download basic user in-
formation for the author of each tweet: user id,
follower count, status count, description, friend
count, location, language, name, and time zone.
To ensure a fair evaluation, the test set was pro-
vided via download and included the tweets as
well as the basic user information provided by the
download script. The training and the test data is
available for downloaded on our task page.3

4 Evaluation Measures

This section describes the evaluation measures for
our five subtasks. Note that for Subtasks B to E,
the datasets are each subdivided into a number of
topics, and the subtask needs to be carried out in-
dependently for each topic. As a result, each of
the evaluation measures will be “macroaveraged”
across the topics, i.e., we compute the measure in-
dividually for each topic, and we then average the
results across the topics.

4.1 Subtask A: Overall Sentiment of a Tweet
Our primary measure is AvgRec, or average re-
call, which is recall averaged across the POSITIVE
(P), NEGATIVE (N), and NEUTRAL (U) classes.
This measure has desirable theoretical properties
(Sebastiani, 2015), and is also the one we use as
primarily for Subtask B. It is computed as follows:

AvgRec =
1
3
(RP +RN +RU ) (1)

where RP , RN and RU refer to recall with re-
spect to the POSITIVE, the NEGATIVE, and the
NEUTRAL class, respectively. See (Nakov et al.,
2016a) for more detail.

AvgRec ranges in [0, 1], where a value of 1 is
achieved only by the perfect classifier (i.e., the
classifier that correctly classifies all items), a value
of 0 is achieved only by the perverse classifier

(the classifier that misclassifies all items), while
0.3333 is both (i) the value for a trivial classifier
(i.e., one that assigns all tweets to the same class
– be it POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL), and
(ii) the expected value of a random classifier.

The advantage of AvgRec over “standard” accu-
racy is that it is more robust to class imbalance.
The accuracy of the majority-class classifier is the
relative frequency (aka “prevalence”) of the ma-
jority class, that may be much higher than 0.5 if
the test set is imbalanced. Standard F1 is also sen-
sitive to class imbalance for the same reason. An-
other advantage of AvgRec over F1 is that AvgRec
is invariant with respect to switching POSITIVE
with NEGATIVE, while F1 is not. See (Sebastiani,
2015) for more detail on AvgRec.

We further use two secondary measures: accu-
racy and FPN1 . The latter was the primary evalu-
ation measure for Subtask A in previous editions
of the task. It is macro-average F1, calculated over
the POSITIVE and the NEGATIVE classes (note the
exclusion of NEUTRAL). This year, we demoted
FPN1 to a secondary evaluation measure. It is cal-
culated as follows:

FPN1 =
1
2
(FP1 + F

N
1 ) (2)

where FP1 and F
N
1 refer to F1 with respect to the

POSITIVE and the NEGATIVE class, respectively.

506



4.2 Subtask B: Topic-Based Classification on
a 2-point Scale

As in 2016, our primary evaluation measure for
subtask B is average recall, or AvgRec (note that
there are only two classes for this subtask):

AvgRec =
1
2
(RP +RN ) (3)

We further use accuracy and F1 as secondary
measures for subtask B. Finally, as subtask B is
topic-based, we computed each metric individu-
ally for each topic, and we then averaged the result
across the topics to yield the final score.

4.3 Subtask C: Topic-based Classification on
a 5-point Scale

Subtask C is an ordinal classification (also known
as ordinal regression) task, in which each tweet
must be classified into exactly one of the classes
in C={HIGHLYPOSITIVE, POSITIVE, NEUTRAL,
NEGATIVE, HIGHLYNEGATIVE}, represented in
our dataset by numbers in {+2,+1,0,−1,−2},
with a total order defined on C.

We adopt an evaluation measure that takes the
order of the five classes into account. For instance,
misclassifying a HIGHLYNEGATIVE example as
HIGHLYPOSITIVE is a bigger mistake than mis-
classifying it as NEGATIVE or as NEUTRAL.

As in SemEval-2016 Task 4, we use macro-
average mean absolute error (MAEM ) as the
main ordinal classification measure:

MAEM (h, Te) =
1
|C|

|C|∑
j=1

1
|Tej |

∑
xi∈Tej

|h(xi)−yi|

where yi denotes the true label of item xi, h(xi)
is its predicted label, Tej denotes the set of test
documents whose true class is cj , |h(xi)− yi| de-
notes the “distance” between classes h(xi) and yi
(e.g., the distance between HIGHLYPOSITIVE and
NEGATIVE is 3), and the “M” superscript indicates
“macroaveraging”.

The advantage of MAEM over “standard”
mean absolute error, which is defined as

MAEµ(h, Te) =
1
|Te|

∑
xi∈Te

|h(xi)− yi| (4)

is that it is robust to class imbalance (which
is useful, given the imbalanced nature of our
dataset). On perfectly balanced datasets MAEM

and MAEµ are equivalent.

MAEM is an extension of macro-average recall
for ordinal regression; yet, it is a measure of er-
ror, and thus lower values are better. We also use
MAEµ as a secondary measure, in order to pro-
vide better consistency with Subtasks A and B.
These measures are computed for each topic, and
the results are then averaged across all topics to
yield the final score. See (Baccianella et al., 2009)
for more detail about MAEM and MAEµ.

4.4 Subtask D: Tweet Quantification on a
2-point Scale

Subtask D assumes a binary quantification setup,
in which each tweet is classified as POSITIVE
or NEGATIVE, and the distribution across classes
must be estimated. The difference with binary
classification is that errors of different polarity
(e.g., a false positive and a false negative for
the same class) can compensate for each other in
quantification. Quantification is thus a more le-
nient task than classification, since a perfect classi-
fier is also a perfect quantifier, but a perfect quan-
tifier is not necessarily a perfect classifier.

For evaluating binary quantification, we keep
the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) measure
used in 2016 along with additive smoothing
(Nakov et al., 2016a; Forman, 2005). KLD was
proposed as a quantification measure in (Forman,
2005), and is defined as follows:

KLD(p̂, p, C) =
∑
cj∈C

p(cj) loge
p(cj)
p̂(cj)

(5)

KLD is a measure of the error made in estimat-
ing a true distribution p over a set C of classes by
means of a predicted distribution p̂. LikeMAEM ,
KLD is a measure of error, which means that
lower values are better. KLD ranges between 0
(best) and +∞ (worst).

Note that the upper bound of KLD is not finite
since Equation 5 has predicted prevalences, and
not true prevalences, at the denominator: that is,
by making a predicted prevalence p̂(cj) infinitely
small we can makeKLD infinitely large. To solve
this problem, in computingKLD we smooth both
p(cj) and p̂(cj) via additive smoothing, i.e.,

ps(cj) =
p(cj) + �

(
∑
cj∈C

p(cj)) + � · |C|

=
p(cj) + �
1 + � · |C|

(6)

507



where ps(cj) denotes the smoothed version of
p(cj) and the denominator is just a normalizer
(same for the p̂s(cj)’s); the quantity � = 12·|Te| is
used as a smoothing factor, where Te denotes the
test dataset.

The smoothed versions of p(cj) and p̂(cj) are
used in place of their original versions in Equation
5; as a result, KLD is always defined and still
returns a value of 0 when p and p̂ coincide.

Like MAEM , KLD is a measure of error,
which means that lower values are better. We
further use two secondary error-based evaluation
measures: absolute error (AE), and relative abso-
lute error (RAE).

Again, the measures are computed individually
for each topic, and the results are averaged across
the topics to yield the final score.

4.5 Subtask E: Tweet Quantification on a
5-point Scale

Subtask E is an ordinal quantification task. As in
binary quantification, the goal is to compute the
distribution across classes, this time assuming a
quantification setup.

Here each tweet belongs exactly to one
of the classes in C={HIGHLYPOSITIVE, POS-
ITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE, HIGHLYNEGA-
TIVE}, where there is a total order on C. As in
binary quantification, the task is to compute an es-
timate p̂(cj) of the relative frequency p(cj) in the
test tweets of all the classes cj ∈ C.

The measure we adopt for ordinal quantifi-
cation is the Earth Mover’s Distance (Rubner
et al., 2000), also known as the Vasers̆teı̆n met-
ric (Rüschendorf, 2001), a measure well-known in
the field of computer vision. EMD is currently
the only known measure for ordinal quantifica-
tion. It is defined for the general case in which
a distance d(c′, c′′) is defined for each c′, c′′ ∈ C.
When there is a total order on the classes in C and
d(ci, ci+1) = 1 for all i ∈ {1, ..., (C − 1)}, the
Earth Mover’s Distance is defined as

EMD(p̂, p) =
|C|−1∑
j=1

|
j∑
i=1

p̂(ci)−
j∑
i=1

p(ci)| (7)

and can be computed in |C| steps from the esti-
mated and true class prevalences.

Like KLD, EMD is a measure of error, so
lower values are better; EMD ranges between 0
(best) and |C| − 1 (worst). See (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2010) for more detail on EMD.

As before, EMD is computed individually for
each topic, and the results are then averaged across
all topics to yield the final score. For more detail

paper (Nakov et al., 2016a).

5 Participants and Results

A total of 48 teams participated in SemEval-2017
Task 4 this year. As in previous years, the most
popular subtask this year was Subtask A, with 38
teams participating in the English subtask A, and 8
teams participating in the Arabic subtask A. Over-
all, there were 46 teams who participated in some
English subtask and 9 teams that participated in
some Arabic subtask. There were 28 teams that
participated in a subtask other than subtask A.
Moreover, two teams (OMAM and ELiRF-UPV)
participated in all English and in all Arabic sub-
tasks. There were 9 teams that participated in the
topic versions of the subtasks but not in subtask A,
reflecting a growing interest among researchers in
developing systems for topic-specific analysis.

5.1 Common Resources and Methods

In terms of methods, the use of deep learning
stands out in particular, and we also see an in-
crease over the last year. There were at least 20
teams who used deep learning and neural network
methods such as CNN and LSTM networks. Su-
pervised SVM and Liblinear were also very popu-
lar, with several participants combining SVM with
neural network methods or SVM with dense word
embedding features. Other teams used classifiers
such as Maximum Entropy, Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, Naı̈ve Bayes classifier, and Con-
ditional Random Fields.

Common software used included Python (with
the sklearn and numpy libraries), Java, Tensor-
flow, Weka, NLTK, Keras, Theano, and Stanford
CoreNLP. The most common external datasets
used were sentiment140 as a lexicon, pre-trained
word2vec embeddings. Many teams further gath-
ered additional tweets using the Twitter API that
were not annotated for sentiment. These were used
for distant supervision, lexicon building, and word
vector training.

In the following subsections, we present the re-
sults and the ranking for each subtask, and we
highlight the best-performing systems for each
subtask.

5.2 Results for Subtask A: Overall Sentiment
in a Tweet

Tables 6 and 7 show the results for Subtask A in
English and Arabic, respectively, where the teams
are ranked by macro-average recall.

For English the best ranking teams were
BB twtr and DataStories, both achieving a macro-
average recall of 0.681. Both top teams used deep
learning; BB twtr used an ensemble of LSTMs
and CNNs with multiple convolution operations,
while DataStories used deep LSTM networks with
an attention mechanism.

Both teams participated in all English subtasks
and were also ranked in first (BB twtr) and sec-
ond (DataStories) place for subtasks B-D; BB twtr
was also ranked first for subtask E.

The top 5 teams for English were very closely
scored. The following four best-ranked teams all
used deep learning or deep learning ensembles.
Three of the top-10 scoring teams (INGEOTEC,
SiTAKA, and UCSC-NLP) used SVM classifiers
instead, with various surface, lexical, semantic,
and dense word embedding features. The use
of ensembles clearly stood out, with five of the
top-10 scoring systems (BB twtr, LIA, NNEMBs,
Tweester, and INGEOTEC) using ensembles, hy-
brid, stacking or some kind of mix of learning
methods. All teams beat the baseline on macro-
average recall; however, a few teams did not beat
the harsher average F-measure and accuracy base-
lines.

For Arabic the best-ranked team was
NileTMRG, and it achieved a score of 0.583.
They used a Naı̈ve Bayes classifier with a
combination of lexical and sentiment features;
they further augmented the training dataset to
about 13K examples using external tweets. The
SiTAKA team was ranked second with a score of
0.55. Their system used a feature-rich SVM with
lexical features and embedding representations.
Except for EliRF-UPV, who used multi-layer
neural networks (CRNNs), the remaining teams
used SVM and Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers, genetic
algorithms, or conditional random fields (CRFs).
All teams managed to beat all baselines for all
metrics.

The difference in the absolute scores for the two
languages is probably partially due to the differ-
ence in the amount of training data available for
Arabic, which was much smaller compared En-
glish, even when external datasets were taken into
account. The results also reflect the linguistic
complexity of Arabic as it is used in social me-
dia, which is characterized by the abundant use of
dialectal forms and spelling variants. Overall, par-
ticipants preferred to focus on developing Arabic-
specific systems (varying in the extent to which
they applied Arabic-specific preprocessing) rather
than trying to leverage cross-language models that
would enable them to use English data to augment
their Arabic models.

5.3 Results for Subtasks B and C:
Topic-Based Classification

The results of Subtasks B and C are shown in Ta-
bles 8–11. We can see that the system scores for
subtask B are higher than those for subtask A, with
the best team achieving 0.882 accuracy for English
(compared to 0.681 for subtask A) and 0.768 for
Arabic (compared to 0.583 for subtask A). How-
ever, this is primarily due to the fact there are two
classes for subtask B, while there are three classes
for subtask A.

ing topic annotations and a context-aware atten-
tion mechanism.

funSentiment, ranked 6th and 9th for subtasks B
and C, respectively, modeled the sentiment to-
wards the topic using the left and the right context
around a topic mention in the tweet. WarwickDCS,
ranked 8th, used simple tweet-level classification,
while ignoring the topic. Overall, almost all teams
managed to outperform the majority class baseline
for subtask B, but only two teams outperformed
the NEUTRAL class baseline for subtask C.

For Arabic four teams participated in Subtask B
and two teams in Subtask C. NileTMRG was once
again ranked first for Subtask B, with a system
based on ensembles of topic-specific and topic-
agnostic models. For subtask C, OMAM also used
combinations of such models applied in succes-
sion. All teams easily outperformed the baselines
for Subtask B, but only the OMAM team managed
to do so for Subtask C.

5.4 Results for Subtasks D and E: Tweet
Quantification

Tables 12–15 show the results for the tweet quan-
tification subtasks. The bottom of the tables report
the result of a baseline system, B1, that assigns
a prevalence of 1 to the majority class (which is
the POSITIVE class for subtask D, and the WEAK-
LYPOSITIVE/NEUTRAL class for subtask E, En-
glish/Arabic) and 0 to the other class(es).

We further show the results for a smarter “max-
imum likelihood” baseline, which assigns to each
test topic the distribution of the training tweets
(the union of TRAIN, DEV, DEVTEST) across
the classes. This is the “smartest” among the
trivial policies that attempt to maximize KLD.
For this baseline, for English we use for train-
ing either (i) the 2016 data only, or (ii) data from
both 2015 and 2016; we also experiment with
(i) micro-averaging and (ii) macro-averaging over
the topics. It turns out that macro-averaging over
2015+2016 data is the strongest baseline in terms
of KLD. For Arabic, we use the train-2017 data,
and micro-averaging works better there.

There were 15 participating teams competing in
Subtask D: 15 for English and 3 for Arabic (these
3 teams all participated in English). As in the
other subtasks, BB twtr was ranked first in En-
glish. They achieved an improvement of .50 points
absolute in KLD over the best baseline, and a .01
improvement over the next best team, DataStories.
For Arabic, the best team was NileTMRG With im-
provement of .17 over the best baseline and of .08
over the next best team, OMAM. All but the last
two teams in English and the last team for Arabic
outperformed all baselines.

In Subtask E, there were 12 participating teams,
with OMAM and EliRF-UPV competing for both
English and Arabic. Once again, BB twtr was the
best for English, improving over the best baseline
by .31 EMD points absolute. Interestingly, this is
the first subtask where DataStories was not the
second-ranked team. BB twtr outperformed the
second-best team, TwiSe, by .02 points. For En-
glish, all but the last two teams outperformed the
baselines. However, for Arabic, none of the two
participating teams could do so.

5.5 User Information

This year, we encouraged teams to explore using
in their models information about the user who
wrote the tweet, which can be extracted from the
public user profiles of the respective Twitter users.
Participants could also try features about follow-
ing relations and the structure of the social net-
work in general, as well as could make use of other
tweets by the target user when analyzing one par-
ticular tweet. Four teams tried that: SINAI, ECNU,
TakeLab, and OMAM. OMAM and TakeLab did
not find any improvements, and ultimately decided
not to use any user information. ECNU used pro-
file information such as favorited, favorite count,
retweeted, and retweet count. They ended up 15th
in Subtask A. SINAI used the last 200 tweets from
the person’s timeline. They ranked 12th in Subtask
B. They generated a user model from the timeline
of a given target user. They built a general SVM
model on word2vec embeddings. Then, for each
user in the test set, they downloaded the last 200
tweets published by the user and classified their
sentiment using that SVM classifier. If the clas-
sified user tweets achieved an accuracy above a
threshold (0.7), the user model was applied on the
authored tweets from the test set. If not, the gen-
eral SVM model was used.

It is difficult to judge whether and by how much
user information could help the best approaches
as they did not try to use such information. How-
ever, we believe that building and using a Twit-
ter user profile is a promising research direction,
and that participants should learn how to make this
work in the future. Thus, we would like to en-
courage more teams to try to explore using this
information. We would also like to provide more
user information such as age and gender, which we
can predict automatically (Rosenthal and McKe-
own, 2016), when it is not directly available from
the user profile. Another promising direction is to
make use of “conversations” in Twitter, i.e., take
into account the replies to tweets in Twitter. For
example, previous work (Vanzo et al., 2014) has
shown that it is beneficial to model the polarity de-
tection problem as a sequential classification task
over streams of tweets, where the stream is a “con-
versation” on Twitter containing tweets, replies to
these tweets, replies to these replies, etc.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

Sentiment Analysis in Twitter continues to be a
very popular task, attracting 48 teams this year.
The task provides immense value to the senti-
ment community by providing a large accessible
benchmark dataset containing over 70,000 tweets
across two languages for researchers to evaluate
and compare their method to the state of the art.
This year, we introduced a new language for the
first time and also encouraged the use of user in-
formation. These additions drew new participants
and ideas to the task. The Arabic tasks drew nine
participants and four teams took advantage of user
information. Although a respectable amount of
participants for its inaugural year, further explo-
ration into both of these areas would be useful in
the future, such as collecting more training data for
Arabic and encouraging the use of cross-lingual
training data. In the future, we would like to in-
clude exploring additional languages, providing
further user information, and other related tasks
such as irony and emotion detection. Finally, deep
learning continues to be popular and employed by
the state of the art approaches. We expect this
trend to continue in sentiment analysis research,
but also look forward to new innovative ideas that
are discovered.
