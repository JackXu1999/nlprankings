Abstract 

Summarization involves finding the most im-
portant information in a text in order to convey 
the meaning of the document. In this paper, I 
present a method for using topic information to 
influence which content is selected for a sum-
mary. Texts are divided into topics using rhe-
torical information that creates a partition of a 
text into a sequence of non-overlapping topics. 
To investigate the effect of this topic structure, 
I compare the output of summarizing an entire 
text without topics to summarizing individual 
topics and combining them into a complete 
summary. The results show that the use of these 
rhetorical topics improves summarization per-
formance compared to a summarization system 
that incorporates no topic information, demon-
strating the utility of topic structure and rhetor-
ical information for automatic summarization. 

1   Introduction 

Summarization is the task of creating a shortened 
version of an input document that retains the im-
portant information from the original text but in a 
more concise form. The goal of summarization is to 
convey the main concepts of the original document 
so that a summary user can understand what the 
document is about without reading the entire text. 
With large amounts of text available online, it has 
become increasingly necessary to find ways to al-
low people to quickly and easily find the infor-
mation they need. Summarization is useful for this 
task because it condenses information into a shorter 
form that can be read instead of a longer text if it 
provides all the information a user needs or it can be 

read in order to determine whether the original text 
contains information relevant to the user’s needs, al-
lowing the user to decide which texts would be most 
useful. In order for summaries to achieve this goal, 
they must convey the important concepts from the 
text without including unnecessary information. 
Most summarization systems perform extractive 
summarization, which involves creating a summary 
by extracting complete sentences from the original 
document (Yih et al., 2007; Conroy et al., 2006; 
Wong et al., 2008; Christensen et al., 2013). The 
current research is also focused on extractive sum-
marization.  

Different representations of texts and text struc-
ture make different assumptions about how texts 
convey information and how summarization is per-
formed. Much work on summarization does not as-
sume anything about the structure of text. The work 
in this paper aims to demonstrate that attention to 
the linguistic structure of a text is useful in perform-
ing summarization. The type of linguistic structure 
and textual organization explored in this work is the 
notion of topic. In linguistics, there are different no-
tions of what it means to be a topic (Lambrecht, 
1996; Gundel, 1988; Blei, 2012; Griffiths et al., 
2005; Van Dijk, 1977; Van Kuppevelt, 1995; Asher, 
2004). Intuitively, texts are organized into topics or 
groups of sentences that are more related to each 
other than they are to sentences in other groups. A 
summary should include coverage of all these top-
ics. One crucial factor that motivates grouping texts 
into topics for summarization has to do with sum-
mary length. A summary is a condensed form of the 
original text. One of the challenges of summariza-
tion is determining how to convey the same infor-
mation as the original text in a more limited space.

In order to convey the same information, there 
should be an emphasis on covering the text by in-
cluding some amount of information about all of the 
important ideas and by limiting redundancy and in-
depth coverage of a particular topic in favor of 
wider coverage of all topics. 

In order to see how useful topics are for summa-
rization, topic information was incorporated into a 
summarization system. To compare the effects of 
using topics versus not using topics, summarization 
was either performed at the level of the whole text 
or at the level of individual topics. Specifically, the 
process for incorporating topics into summarization 
included the following steps: divide a text into top-
ics, summarize the text of each topic, and concate-
nate the summaries of each topic to create a sum-
mary for the whole text. With this method, topics 
are treated as independent pieces of text that con-
tribute to the overall meaning of the text, and each 
topic will be represented in the final summary. This 
agrees with the intuition that texts can be divided 
into topics and a good summary should contain cov-
erage of all topics that appear in the original text. 
This is a straightforward way to see how topics af-
fect summarization.  

Section 2 describes how texts are separated into 
topics using rhetorical information. Section 3 de-
scribes the techniques used for summarizing texts. 
Section 4 presents the methods and results of the ex-
periments that were performed. Section 5 summa-
rizes the findings and contributions of this work. 

2   RST Topics 

2.1   Rhetorical Structure Theory 
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is a framework 
for describing the organization of a text and what a 
text conveys by identifying hierarchical structures 
in text (Mann and Thompson, 1988). Pieces of text 
relate to each other in different ways in order to ac-
complish the writer’s purpose with some pieces 
more central than others. Beginning with the clause 
level, relations can hold between successively 
larger spans of text forming a hierarchical structure 
of how all spans of the text are related to each 
other. One intuition behind RST is that the text 
structure itself conveys information beyond the in-
formation explicitly asserted by clauses in the text. 
Relations connect two non-overlapping pieces of 
text, and their combination conveys information 

beyond that of the individual clauses, such as the 
relational proposition that the information from 
one clause is evidence for the information in the 
other clause.  Relation types include enablement, 
circumstance, background, justification, and evi-
dence, among others. An important part of RST re-
lations is the distinction between nuclei and satel-
lites. The nucleus of a relation is one of the spans 
of text connected by the relation that is more es-
sential to the purpose of the writer and is compre-
hensible on its own without the satellite. The satel-
lite is the element that generally cannot appear on 
its own but provides some type of supporting infor-
mation for the nucleus. The satellite of the relation 
provides information that will increase the belief in 
the nucleus of the relation, and the effect is that the 
reader has an increased belief in the information 
given in the nucleus. In this example of an evi-
dence relation from Mann and Thompson the in-
formation in the satellite about the program pro-
ducing the correct calculation provides evidence 
for the nucleus which states that the program 
works. 

Nucleus: The program as published for calendar 
year 1980 really works. 
Satellite: In only a few minutes, I entered all the 
figures from my 1980 tax return and got a result 
which agreed with my hand calculations to the 
penny. 

The evidence relation and relations in general cap-
ture information about how different pieces of the 
text connect to each other and work together to 
achieve the writer’s purpose. 

Past work has considered whether rhetorical in-
formation is useful for summarization (Marcu, 
2000; Chengcheng, 2010; Cardoso et al., 2015; 
Goyal and Eisenstein, 2016). Marcu (2000) ex-
plores how to use RST structures by combining the 
hierarchical structure of RST with the nucleus/sat-
ellite distinction to create an ordering of the units in 
the text based on importance and salience. Louis et 
al. (2010) explore the usefulness of different fea-
tures, including discourse features, for selecting 
content in extractive summarization. Among the 
discourse-based features, there are some that score 
text units based on how high in the discourse tree 
they are promoted, and others that penalize satellite 
units relative to nucleus units. Chen et al. (2015) 
combine topic information and rhetorical structure 
into a single model, recognizing the importance of 
both of these types of knowledge for understanding 

126



  
  
  

 

the structure of a document. Specifically, their goal 
is to model a document’s intent structure by assum-
ing that documents contain two types of words: 
topic words and rhetorical words. In the current 
work, rhetorical information is used as part of deter-
mining the division of texts into sections corre-
sponding to topics. 

2.2   Proposal for using RST Topics 
As rhetorical and structural information has been 

shown to be useful for tasks such as summarization, 
there is motivation for combining this information 
with the idea of topics. Additionally, instead of us-
ing it directly to determine which sentences to 
choose for a summary, I use this information at a 
different point in the process. I propose using RST 
to inform the division of texts into topics. RST rela-
tions capture how parts of a text connect to each 
other to accomplish the writer’s purpose. They 
therefore provide useful information about which 
sentences in a text are most closely related to each 
other in a more structural sense than comparing the 
words they contain. Grouping sentences according 
to how they are related in a rhetorical structure pro-
vides a way to divide texts into topics. Specifically, 
topic relations that indicate a change in topic pro-
vide a natural grouping of sentences.  

A few RST relation types are related to topics and 
topic changes within the text. These types are topic 
shift and topic drift. Topic shift is a relation that 
connects large sections of text when there is an ab-
rupt change between topics. On the other hand, topic 
drift is a relation that connects large sections of text 
when the change between topics is smooth rather 
than abrupt, and there is still some similarity be-
tween topics. These topic relations provide a way to 
partition texts into topics. Specifically, these rela-
tions can be used as dividing points, with the sec-
tions of text connected by these relations considered 
distinct topics. In this paper, I explore a notion of 
topic based on this type of structural information 
and the utility of these topics for summarization. 

3   Summarization System 

In order to test how the use of topic structure affects 
summarization, I explored the impact of topics on 
the performance of previously proposed algorithms 
for extractive summarization that are implemented 
                                                                                                                
1 https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy 

in the Sumy Python library.1 Specifically, several 
common summarizers including LexRank (Erkan 
and Radev, 2004), TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 
2004), and SumBasic (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 
2005) were used. These summarization methods de-
pend on word frequency and co-occurrence rather 
than using any substantial information about text 
structure. 

Given these summarizers, the following process 
for summarization was used. First, the complete text 
was summarized by one of these summarizers. 
Texts were then divided into topics according to the 
topics in the RST annotation of the texts. Then each 
topic was summarized, and the outputs were com-
bined to create a summary of the whole text. In each 
case, a value of 20% was used for the summariza-
tion, meaning the summarizer would return 20% of 
the original text, where length is measured in sen-
tences. For example, for a text containing 10 sen-
tences, the summarizer would return 2 as the sum-
mary. The value of 20% was used when summariz-
ing the entire text or when summarizing an individ-
ual topic. Ideally, this will result in similar length 
summaries whether or not topics are used, because 
taking 20% of several smaller sections and combin-
ing them should be the same as taking 20% of the 
entire text. In addition to 20%, three other values of 
the summarization percentage were tested: 10%, 
30%, and 40%. 

4   Experiments 

Experiments were conducted to see how topic struc-
ture influences summarization performance. Three 
conditions were tested. The first condition did not 
incorporate topic structure. Entire texts were sum-
marized using the summarizers described in the pre-
vious section. The second condition used RST top-
ics. Texts were divided into topics as described 
above. Each of the topics was summarized, and the 
outputs were combined to create a summary of the 
entire text. The third condition used random topics. 
Using the topic sizes from the RST topics, texts 
were randomly divided into topics of the same size. 
This condition provided a control to see whether 
topic divisions informed by RST information re-
sulted in better summaries than random divisions or 
whether simply dividing a text into smaller sections 
improves performance.

4.1   Data 
The data for these topic summarization experi-
ments comes from the RST Discourse Treebank 
(Carlson et al., 2002). This corpus contains 385 
Wall Street Journal articles that have been anno-
tated with RST structure. Dividing a text into RST 
topics depends on the presence of topic relations in 
the annotated text, specifically topic-shift or topic-
drift relations. Not all texts in the corpus include 
topic relations in their annotations. Therefore, 
these experiments were limited to texts that do 
contain topic relations. In the corpus, there are 71 
documents with topics.  

Another feature of the RST Discourse Treebank 
is the presence of summaries for some documents. 
Gold-standard summaries are crucial for evaluating 
the output of a summarization system. For 150 doc-
uments in the corpus, there are 2 manually-created 
extractive summaries. Two analysts created these 
extracts by selecting a number of Elementary Dis-
course Units (EDUs) based on the square root of the 
total number of EDUs in the text. EDUs are the 
building blocks of RST structure. They are the low-
est level units that are arguments of RST relations. 
EDUs are typically clauses. 

Since gold-standard summaries are required to 
evaluate system-produced summaries, these experi-
ments were performed on texts that have corre-
sponding summaries. Of the 71 documents in the 
corpus that have topics, 51 documents also have ex-
tractive summaries. These 51 documents are the 
core dataset for the topic summarization experi-
ments. 

4.2   Division into Topics 
Texts are divided into topics using RST topic rela-
tions. In the most straightforward case, all units in 
the text are explicitly designated as part of a topic. 
This case can be seen in Figure 1. The first line in-
dicates that the text contains 31 units, as the Root 
spans the entire text. The next line shows that units 
1-13 are part of a topic-drift relation. Skipping down 
to the other argument of this relation on the last line 
shows that the other element of the topic relation in-
cludes the rest of the text, units 14-31. In this nota-
tion, these text spans are arguments of the same re-
lation because when combined they form a continu-
ous sequence with the second argument starting di-
rectly after the first, and visually the two arguments 
occur at the same indent level. Therefore, this text 

can easily be divided into two topics. The first topic 
begins with the first unit of the text and continues to 
unit 13, and the second topic begins at unit 14 and 
continues to the end of the text. 

 
( Root (span 1 31) 
  ( Nucleus (span 1 13) (rel2par Topic-Drift) 
    ( Nucleus (span 1 8) (rel2par span)  
  . 
  . 
  ( Nucleus (span 14 31) (rel2par Topic-Drift) 

Figure 1: RST annotation with all units in explicit topics 
 
However, in other texts, not all units within a text 
are necessarily included as part of an explicit topic 
relation. In these cases, in order to divide a text into 
topics the topic relations were used as dividing 
points. Each occurrence of a topic relation signaled 
the beginning of a new topic. Anything before that 
point is grouped together as a topic, and anything 
after a topic relation is grouped as a topic. In that 
way, all units in a text are included as part of a topic. 
This topic division can be seen in Figure 2. The first 
line shows that the text contains 88 units. In contrast 
to the previous example, the first relation is not a 
topic relation. The first explicit topic relation begins 
with unit 7 and ends with unit 38. The other argu-
ment of that relation begins with unit 39 and contin-
ues to unit 53. No explicit topic relations include ei-
ther the beginning or the end of the text. Using the 
topic relations as dividing points, all units can be 
placed into a topic. Units 1-6 become a topic, span-
ning from the beginning of the text to the first topic 
relation, and units 54-88 become a topic, spanning 
from the end of a topic relation to the end of the text. 

This division method creates a partition of the 
text into a sequence of non-overlapping topics. Us-
ing this method means that topics contain adjacent 
units. Each unit in the text is contained in exactly 
one topic. Pseudocode for the topic division process 
is shown in Figure 3.

4.3   Evaluation 
Summary evaluation is a difficult task. There can 
be more than one good summary of a text, and 
when people are instructed to create summaries, 
they do not necessarily contain the same sentences. 
Since there is no single correct answer for what a 
summary should contain, evaluation typically in-
volves comparing a system-produced summary to a 
manually-created reference summary. Summary 
quality is based on some measure of similarity or 
overlap with a reference summary. 

ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a measure to evaluate per-
formance on the task of automatic summarization. 
ROUGE is a standard measure used in the field of 
summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Lin and 
Hovy, 2003; Xie et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2008; 
Nallapati et al., 2016; Chopra et al., 2016). Recall-
Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation in-
volves comparing a summary produced by a sum-
marization system to reference or gold-standard 
summaries created by humans. Specifically, 
ROUGE-N measures n-gram (unigram, bigram, 
etc.) recall between a system summary and a refer-
ence summary. Recall refers to how many of the ref-
erence n-grams were included in the system sum-
mary. The equation for ROUGE-N is presented be-
low. 
 
 !"#$%&'()*(,-./0)23'&	  0∈66∈{89:	  6;&}

!"#$%(,-./0)23'&0∈66∈{89:	  6;&}
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  (1) 

 
In this equation, 𝑛 refers to the size of the n-gram, 
such as unigram (1) or bigram (2). An n-gram itself 
is represented by 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚$, and 
𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡/.%FG(𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚$) refers to the number of 
times that the n-gram 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚$	  appears in the system 
summary. Therefore, the numerator is the number 
of matching n-grams, and the denominator is the 
total number of n-grams in the reference summar-
ies. 

One downside of ROUGE is that it is entirely re-
call-based. In general, a summary will be rewarded 
for including more n-grams without being penalized 
for containing n-grams that do not appear in the ref-
erence summary. In the extreme case, a summary 
that is the same length as the original text being 
summarized could achieve perfect recall even 
though such a summary would clearly not be con-
sidered a good summary, since the goal of summa-
rization is to produce a shortened version of the in-
put. In order to avoid this problem, summary length 
must be controlled. Specifically, since ROUGE-N is 
a word-based evaluation measure, the summary 
length in terms of word count must be controlled so 
that system-produced summaries are similar in 
length to the reference summaries.  

Unit overlap is another evaluation measure for 
summarization (Steinberger and Ježek, 2012). It 
finds the similarity between two texts by looking at 

129



  
  
  

 

the number of words they have in common com-
pared to the number of non-overlapping words they 
contain. 

 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡	  𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝 𝑋, 𝑌 = 	   Q∩S
Q T S U Q∩S

  (2) 

𝑋 and 𝑌 are the words in the documents being 
compared. In contrast to ROUGE, unit overlap pe-
nalizes an evaluated text for containing words that 
do not appear in the gold-standard text. A sum-
mary will not be rewarded simply for being longer.  

The final evaluation measure used is cosine sim-
ilarity (Steinberger and Ježek, 2012). It is a measure 
of similarity between documents using vectors of 
word frequency. Similar to unit overlap, cosine sim-
ilarity takes document length into account and pre-
vents texts from being rewarded for being longer. 

To evaluate the summaries, each system-pro-
duced summary is evaluated against each of the two 
corresponding gold-standard summaries. Scores are  
calculated for each document, and the scores from 
all documents in the corpus are averaged to produce 
an overall value for each measure. 

4.4   Results and Discussion 
Table 1 shows the results of using three different 
summarizers to summarize texts with and without 
topics. These are the results when a summarization 
percentage of 20% was used. Each pair of columns 
shows the result of a different summarizer. The 
first column in each pair shows the results without 
using topics, and the second shows the results of 
using RST topics. The highest value for each 
measure is in bold. Looking at the results shows 
several interesting effects. For each measure, the 
highest value is achieved when using topics. The 
highest ROUGE values are found with TextRank, 
and the highest values for unit overlap and cosine 
similarity are found with LexRank. In these cases, 
using topics results in improvements in perfor-
mance of around 5%. While different summarizers 
perform slightly better on different measures, in 
this paper I am interested in the fact that regardless 
of evaluation measure or summarizer, the inclusion 
of topics improves performance.

120 billion yen (U.S. $857 million) in its current fiscal 
year, up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year, 
Yutaka Kume, president, said. Mr. Kume made the 
earnings projection for fiscal 1990, ending next March 
31, in an interview with U.S. automotive writers at-
tending the Tokyo Motor Show. The executive said 
that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest 
because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its deal-

change fluctuations.]Topic 1 
[During the next decade, Mr. Kume said, Nissan plans 
to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to ac-
count for a majority of sales outside Japan. Last year, 
Mr. Kume said, Nissan exported slightly over one mil-
lion vehicles, and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at 
its factories in North America, Europe and Australia. 
But by 1992, he added, Nissan will build one million 
vehicles a year outside Japan, or sufficient to equal ex-
ports. "By the end of the 1990s," he said, "we want to 
be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every 
vehicle that we export from Japan." That will involve 
a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing ca-
pacity, he acknowledged, but didn't provide specific 
details.]Topic 2

Figure 6: Example text and summaries 
 
Figures 4 and 5 show how the values of ROUGE-

1 and unit overlap change as different summariza-
tion percentages are used. In general, values of the 
evaluation measures increase as the percentage in-
creases. However, the increases depend on which 
measure is considered. ROUGE values increase by 
the largest margin and with the most consistency. 
On the other hand, there are smaller increases for 
the other measures. ROUGE has such large and con-
sistent increases because it is recall-based, so longer 
summaries will always perform better. This issue 
will be discussed further below. The results show 

that topics create more of an improvement in perfor-
mance when the percentage is lower and the sum-
maries are smaller, suggesting that topics do provide 
useful information for summarization, and that in-
formation is the most useful when space is the most 
limited.  

Figure 6 provides an example text along with the 
summaries produced when no topics are used and 
when RST topics are used. When no topic structure 
is used, all sentences in the summary come from one 
topic, showing how topic structure is needed to en-
sure coverage of all ideas in the text. 

An important factor to consider when comparing 
the results of performing summarization with and 
without topics is summary length. It is possible that 
summarizing at the topic level could result in sum-
maries of different lengths from the summaries pro-
duced by summarizing the entire text. Differences 
in length could affect these evaluation measures, 
particularly ROUGE, which is recall-based and 
therefore benefits from including more words by in-
creasing the chances of having more words in com-
mon with the gold-standard. 

One way of dealing with this potential problem is 
to compare RST topics with random topics. Using 
the topic sizes from the RST topics, texts were ran-
domly divided into topics of the same size. While 
the RST topics always contain adjacent sentences, 
the random topics are not constrained in this way. If 
the topics were contiguous, they could not be both 
random and equal in size to the RST topics. There-
fore, the random topics are equal in size but do not 
follow the same adjacency restrictions as the RST 
topics. Since the random topics are the same size as 
the RST topics, length should not have an effect. 
The model was run 25 times with random topics. 
Figure 7 provides a visual illustration of the results. 
The bars in the graph represent the mean values. The 
error bars show two standard deviations below and 
above the mean. The points represent the values 
when using RST topics. Comparing the mean values 
to the values with RST topics, the RST values are 
higher than the random topics for all measures. 
Looking at the RST values compared to the means 
+ 2 standard deviations, the RST values are greater 
than or very similar to the random values, indicating 
that the RST values are significantly different from 
random.

Another way to explore the effects of length is to 
consider whether the use of topics has an effect on 
performance separate from any effect of summary 
length. Table 3 shows the results of a linear regres-
sion exploring the effects of different factors on 
ROUGE and unit overlap to see whether length dif-
ferences are having an effect. The factors consid-
ered were word count in the summary and RST Top-
ics/Random Topics/No Topics. These are the results 
when using LexRank as the summarizer. The results 
for the other summarizers are similar.2 As shown in 
the table, word count and RST topics had a signifi-
cant effect on ROUGE, while random topics had no 
significant effect. The significance of RST topics 
shows that using RST topics improves performance 
compared to not using topics as well as compared to 
using random topics. As discussed above, ROUGE 
is affected by differences in word count, and these 
results show that word count was a significant factor 
in predicting ROUGE scores. However, the unit

overlap scores are not affected in the same way, and 
the linear regression confirms that for unit overlap 
the only significant factor is the use of RST topics.  

These results demonstrate the positive impact 
that the use of topics has on summarization perfor-
mance. Specifically, dividing texts into topics using 
topic relations from RST results in summaries that 
are more similar to manually-created gold-standard 
summaries than summarizing texts without the in-
clusion of topic structure. 

Given the improved summarization performance 
seen when using topics based on RST, it is worth 
considering whether other notions of topic, particu-
larly common topic modeling methods, are useful 
for this task. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was 
tested as another way to divide texts into topics, us-
ing an implementation from Gensim topic modeling 
software (Rehurek and Sojka 2010). An important 
part of LSA is the number of dimensions that are 
used when reducing the semantic space. Given the 
size of the training data and common values sug-
gested in previous research, three values were tested 
for the number of dimensions: 50, 100, and 200. To 
divide a text into topics, the number of topics, 𝑛, to 
choose was taken from the RST annotation. Then 
this number was used as 𝑘 in a k-means clustering 
algorithm. Clustering was performed over the sen-
tence vectors that represent a document’s sentences 
in the LSA semantic space. These vectors contain 
values for how related a document is to each of the 
dimensions in the model. Clustering divides the sen-
tences of a text into 𝑘 topics based on similarity of 
the sentence vectors. Clustering was performed us-
ing scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The results 
are presented in Table 3, which shows the mean of 
each evaluation measure over 10 runs of the model, 
using LexRank as the summarizer, with 100 dimen-
sions in the LSA model. The values when not using 
topics and when using RST topics are repeated in 
the table for comparison.

The results are similar when using different num-
bers of dimensions as well as the other summarizers. 
Looking across all summarizers and numbers of di-
mensions, RST topics perform better than LSA top-
ics. The difference in performance is evident for all 
evaluation measures. In general, LSA topics per-
form similarly to using no topics at all. Overall, the 
types of topics found by using LSA are not very use-
ful for a summarization system that uses topics. The 
results suggest that while LSA has been success-
fully used to classify documents and find documents 
related to a query (Deerwester et al., 1990; Zeli-
kovitz and Hirsh, 2001), LSA is not sufficient to dis-
tinguish between different topics of a single docu-
ment and does not find topics that improve summa-
rization. 

5   Conclusion 

By performing summarization at the level of the en-
tire text and at the level of individual topics, I inves-
tigated the influence of topic information on sum-
marization performance. I explored a notion of topic 
that uses information about a text’s rhetorical struc-
ture in the form of RST relations. The direct com-
parison of summarization when using topics versus 
not using topics showed that topic information im-
proves performance. Improvements were found 
with several evaluation measures, including 
ROUGE and unit overlap. Performance also im-
proved regardless of which summarizer was used. 

The strong performance of the model when using 
topics has several interesting implications that high-
light the contributions of this work. First, the results 
demonstrate the usefulness of topic structure. Con-
ceptualizing texts as composed of a number of top-
ics not only improves human processing of texts but 
also increases the quality of summaries produced by 
automatic systems. In this work, topics were incor-
porated in a straightforward way, by summarizing a 
text’s topics and combining them to create a com-
plete summary. The results showed that this simple 
method for including topic information improves 
performance compared to not using any topics. 

Another important finding of this work is the util-
ity of a notion of topic based on rhetorical infor-
mation. The topics were based on RST relations that 
connect pieces of a text when the topic has changed 
between the sections. Using these relations to signal 
boundaries between topics proved to be a reasona-
ble method to automatically separate a text into its 
component topics, and specifically a method that is 
useful for finding topics relevant for summarization. 
The improvements in performance seen with this 
notion of topic also demonstrate another way that 
rhetorical information such as RST can be used as 
part of the summarization process. 

These results demonstrate the benefits of using 
one notion of topic for summarization and motivate 
further investigation into the use of topic structure, 
including comparisons with other methods for di-
viding a text into topics. This work also motivates 
the consideration of other ways to use rhetorical in-
formation for summarization. An area for future 
work is to explore how to automatically find RST-
type topics without requiring a full RST annotation.
