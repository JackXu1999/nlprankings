Abstract 

Vernacular regions such as central Ohio 

are popularly used in everyday language; 

but their vague and indeterministic bound-

aries affect the clarity of communicating 

them over the geographic space. This pa-

per introduced a context-based natural 

language processing approach to retrieve 

geographic entities. Geographic entities 

extracted from news articles were used as 

location-based behavioral samples to map 

out the vague region of central Ohio. Par-

ticularly, part of speech tagging and parse 

tree generation were employed to filter out 

candidate entities from English sentences. 

Propositional logic of context (PLC) was 

introduced and adapted to build the con-

textual model for deciding the member-

ship of named entities. Results were auto-

matically generated and visualized in GIS 

using both symbol and density mapping. 

Final maps were consistent with our intu-

ition and common sense knowledge of the 

vague region.  

1 Introduction 

Central Ohio is commonly used vernacular term 

to refer to an approximate area around the city of 

Columbus in Ohio. Although it may be effortless 

for humans to tell the relative location of this re-

gion, it remains challenging for computers to au-

tomatically locate this region by harvesting and 

analyzing online data such as news articles. Com-

puters that are capable of automatically delineat-

ing such vague regions may be of potential use to 

social science researchers for understanding other 

concepts that may not be as obvious such as cul-

tural regions, the Muslim world.  

     In the study of vague regions, previous studies 

introduced a behavioral method to map out down-

town Santa Barbara based on human survey data 

(Montello, Goodchild, Gottsegen, & Fohl, 2003). 

Their approach collected hand-drawn point-based 

locations and plotted them on the map of the city. 

Such data collection process may be very costly 

compared to computer-based automated ap-

proach. By comparison, natural language pro-

cessing (NLP) techniques such as part of speech 

tagging and parse tree generation provide power-

ful linguistic analysis tools that can help quickly 

retrieve data from a large number of corpus data 

(Jurafsky, Martin, Kehler, Vander Linden, & 

Ward, 2000). However, these NLP techniques 

have yet been widely used to extract geographic 

entities for visualizing vague regions like central 

Ohio.    

     On the other hand, linguistic contexts of named 

entities are important for deciding its relevancy to 

the underlying vague regions. For instance, for a 

place to be part of central Ohio, it must be in the 

context of Ohio as a precondition. Propositional 

logic of context (PLC) is a logic model in the field 

of artificial intelligence for formalizing contexts 

into propositional calculus (BuvaE & Mason, 

1993). Based on PLC, an arbitrary predicate cal-

culus can be evaluated according to selected con-

texts. 

In this paper, central Ohio is chosen as the ex-

perimental area to experiment the context-based 

natural language approach for visualizing vague 

regions. News articles are used and analyzed on 

three contextual levels: document, paragraph and 

sentence. Results are visualized in GIS. 

1.1 News data 

News articles are extracted from LexisNexis, a 

comprehensive database of both national and lo-

cal news (Smith, Ellenberg, Bell, & Rubin, 2008). 

All articles are retrieved based on caseless key-

word match for relevancy. The only keyword used 

is central Ohio and only news articles that contain 

this exact phrase are retrieved. As a result, 3281 

different articles are collected which cover central 

Ohio news from the year 1990 to the year 2013.

1.2 Geonames database 

Geonames database contains names and locations 

of geographic entities. We create our geonames 

database two sources: the United States Geologi-

cal Survey's Geographic Names 

Information Server (USGS, 2013) and Census 

gazetteers (Census, 2013). Only place and feature 

names in Ohio used for analysis. Table 1 summa-

rizes compositions of entities in our Ohio 

geonames database.

2 Natural Language Processing 

Part of speech tagging and parse tree generation 

are used to automatically extract geographic 

named entities from news articles in this paper. 

Part of speech (POS) tagging is the process of de-

ciding the functions of words such as nouns or 

verbs. Parse tree generation is based on POS tag-

ging results. It aims to generate hierarchical rep-

resentations of sentences for semantic understand-

ing (Jurafsky et al., 2000). Noun phrases in the 

parse tree are often useful indicators to named en-

tities in geolinguistic analysis (Chen et al., 2013).  

2.1 Part of speech tagging 

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns a POS tag 

to each token in a sentence. A token can be either 

a word or a punctuation. The single best POS tag 

assigned to a token depends on the function of the 

word, the tag set, and POS tagging algorithm 

(Jurafsky et al., 2000). Contemporary POS tag-

gers can reach an average accuracy of above 97% 

on tokens (Manning, 2011).  

The part of speech tagger we use is Stanford 

NLP tagger with english-caseless-left3words-

distsim tagger model. This tagger model is trained 

with WSJ sections 0-18 and extra parser training 

data using the left3words architecture. It includes 

word shape and distributional similarity features 

for training the tagger (Gimpel et al., 2010). The 

results are represented using Penn Treebank tags 

and the average parsing accuracy is above 97% on 

sentences in news. Box 1 is the tagged sentence 

from one article with POS tags appended after the 

slash in uppercase letters. For a complete list, one 

may refer to Penn Treebank tag sets.

2.2 Parsing 

Stanford parsers are used to produce the parse tree 

from which noun phrases, named entity candi-

dates, can be extracted (De Marneffe, 

MacCartney, & Manning, 2006) . Fig.1 shows the 

result of parsing the tagged sentence in Box 1. It 

is observed that only noun phrases (NP) at the 

lowest level of the tree are useful for extracting 

named entities. Noun phrases at other levels con-

tain auxiliary structures such as prepositions often 

do not suggest named entities.  

 In Fig.1, NPs in dashed rectangles are candi-

date entities that do not match any records in our 

Ohio database. When looking up the database for 

a match, determinants like the are skipped as well 

as entity type terms like city and county. To find 

the location of a matched entity, a SQL query is 

used to return the latitude and longitude pair.

3 Geographic Information Retrieval 

3.1 Propositional logic of context (PLC) 

As previously discussed, candidate named entities 

are primarily noun phrases extracted at the root 

level of a parse tree. However, not all such entities 

should be considered as part of central Ohio. To 

determine the membership, we may define fol-

lowing logic heuristics: if (1) the name of an entity 

is in the same text segment as the phrase central 

Ohio and (2) the entity is an Ohio place, then the 

entity is of greater likelihood of being a central 

Ohio place than otherwise. Here, Ohio and central 

9



Ohio are linguistic contexts for discriminating 

central Ohio entities. 

     To formalize the contexts of analysis, we intro-

duce propositional logic of context (PLC) (BuvaE 

& Mason, 1993). Here, we only adapt its basic 

form as it already suffice the needs of our analysis. 

For detailed information of PLC, one may read the 

original paper from BuvaE (BuvaE & Mason, 

1993). The minimum PLC definition is below: 

x:   subject 

p:   preposition about the subject 

c:   context 

c1c2:  logic AND, intersection of two contexts 

c1c2:  logic OR, union of two contexts 

ist(c, p): the proposition p is true in context c.  

3.2 PLC-based matching and counting 

Based on the PLC definition, we count the men-

tions of named entities in all news articles.      

Here, we define the following PLC notations for 

our analysis:  

p: the preposition that x is a central Ohio city 

c1: the context of Ohio 

c2: the context of central Ohio 

c3: the context of not-central Ohio 

     Ohio context is defined according to records in 

geonames database. If an entity name is in the da-

tabase, it is said to be in the Ohio context. Central 

Ohio context is defined as the text segment con-

taining both the entity name and the phrase central 

Ohio. Not-central Ohio context is defined as the 

text segment with the following terms in it: 

north(ern) Ohio, northeast(ern) Ohio, east(ern) 

Ohio, southeast(ern) Ohio, south(ern) Ohio, 

southwest(ern) Ohio, west(ern) Ohio, and north-

west(ern) Ohio. Based on our observation, these 

eight azimuth phrases are found to be good indi-

cators of places that are obviously not in central 

Ohio.  

Accordingly, three types of entity counts are 

also developed.  

(1) Positive count (E): the total number of occur-
rences of the name of an entity E in the context 

c1c2.  

(2) Neutral count (E): the total number of occur-
rences of the name of an entity E in the context 

c1c2c3.  

(3) Negative count (E): the total number of occur-
rences of the name of an entity E in the context 

c1c3.  

3.3 Count and normalization 

We calculate the membership of an entity to the 

concept central Ohio using following counting 

and normalization rules. We define three variables 

to count entity occurrences in different contexts:  

C𝑝𝑜𝑠 : positive count of the entity E. 

C𝑛𝑒𝑔 : negative count of the entity E.  

C𝑛𝑒𝑢 : neutral count of the entity E. 
IF ist(c1c2, p), C𝑝𝑜𝑠++. 

IF ist(c1c3, p), C𝑛𝑒𝑔++. 

IF ist(c1c2c3, p), C𝑛𝑒𝑢++. 
Based on observations, big cities like Colum-

bus are mentioned more frequently than other 

smaller places in term of both C𝑝𝑜𝑠 and C𝑛𝑒𝑔. As 

it is the difference between C𝑝𝑜𝑠 and C𝑛𝑒𝑔that de-

termines the sign of the membership, we decide to 

use C𝑛𝑒𝑢  as the normalization denominator for 
calculating the membership.  

Membership r of a place is calculated using 

Equation 1. It is a real value between -1 and 1. All 

places are classified by the sign of the member-

ship as either central Ohio or not-central Ohio 

place with the magnitude of the value being the 

strength of the membership. 1 means definitely a 

central Ohio place and -1 means definitely not a 

central Ohio place. 

𝑟 = {
  (C𝑝𝑜𝑠 − C𝑛𝑒𝑔) C𝑛𝑒𝑢⁄    , if C𝑛𝑒𝑢 > 0

0                                        , 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
  𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 1 

    As C𝑛𝑒𝑢 is in the denominator, it must not be 
zero. Given observations, entities with C𝑛𝑒𝑢 being 
zero are primarily entities with less than 3 total 

mentions. These entities take up 3.9% of all ex-

tracted entities. Therefore, we decide to exclude 

them from analysis as they are of a small percent-

age and are not expected to affect the overall re-

sults.  

4 Results and discussions 

Geographic entities are extracted from all 3281 

news articles and their membership values are 

mapped using the geographic information system 

(GIS) software ArcGIS which are popular in so-

cial science geographic research. 

4.1 Graduated symbol maps 

Graduated symbol map is a type of map that uses 

symbols of different sizes to represent geographic 

entities (Thrall, 1999). The symbol we choose is 

circle. The radius of the circle is decided by the 

attribute value associated with each entity. The 

map is configured as follows: 

(1) The size of each point is proportioned to the 
membership of the underlying named entity 

with size 4 and 24 representing the minimum 

and maximum membership respectively.  

(2) Symbols are classified into 10 classes based on 
equal interval classification method.  

10



There is one exception of using the member-

ship for making the graduated symbol map. On 

the article level, all entity counts are added to 

C𝑝𝑜𝑠, and therefore there are no negative or neu-
tral counts. To make a map on the article level, we 

only use the positive count as the surrogate to the 

membership value. 

     Graduated symbol maps on three analytical 

levels are shown in Fig. 2. Results on the sentence 

level and paragraph levels conforms better to our 

intuition and common sense knowledge than on 

the article level. This is because results on the ar-

ticle level do not consider the contexts of c1 and c2 
discussed in section 4.2. Results from the sentence 

and paragraph levels are very similar with the 

membership on the paragraph level being slightly 

more visually significant.

4.2 Kernel density map  

Results produced by graduated symbol maps are 

not continuous.  Kernel density mapping is a GIS 

mapping technique that generates a continuous 

surface based on the locations of the entities and 

their attribute values (Elgammal, Duraiswami, 

Harwood, & Davis, 2002). To create kernel den-

sity maps, a search radius need be defined. All 

data points within this radius will be used to inter-

polate a density area using a quadratic kernel 

function described in Silverman (p. 76, equation 

4.5) (Silverman, 1986).  

The kernel density tool in ArcGIS is used to 

create the density map. In ArcGIS, the search ra-

dius is defined as a percentage of the area’s mini-

mum extent width. We experiment on choosing 

1/10, 1/5, 1/20 of the area’s minimum extent 

width as the radius to generate the surface and find 

1/10 of the width most appropriate to generate a 

balanced looking map.  

     A kernel density map of central Ohio visual-

izes its estimated central location and extending 

trend over the space of Ohio. Fig. 3 is a kernel 

density result based on the paragraph level. It 

shows that the concept of central Ohio generated 

through automated approach conforms to our 

common sense knowledge of the assumptive loca-

tion of the vague region.

5 Conclusions 

Vague geographic regions are important part of 

the entire geographic space; however they are dif-

ficult to be located and delineated on a map. Geo-

graphic questions like Where is central Ohio? re-

mains a challenge to computers because comput-

ers are not automatically given the knowledge of 

either central or Ohio as humans do.  

This paper introduced a context-based ap-

proach to extract geographic entities from news 

articles. Propositional logic of context was 

adapted to contextualize the reasoning process. 

Three types of context have been defined: Ohio, 

central Ohio, not-central Ohio, which corre-

sponded to Ohio places, central Ohio places and 

not-central Ohio places, respectively.  

Analysis was conducted on three contextual 

levels: article, paragraph and sentence. Visuali-

zation results showed that context was of signifi-

cant importance to deciding the membership of a 

place to central Ohio. Without defining the con-

text (e.g. results on the article level in Fig. 2), vis-

ualization results were largely incorrect compared 

with common sense knowledge. 

     Natural language processing (NLP) techniques 

such as part of speech tagging and parse tree gen-

eration were shown to be effective for extracting 

geographic information. Noun phrases could 

serve as good candidates to place names. For fu-

ture research, we suggest studies on experiment-

ing with different regional concepts using pro-

posed approach. It may also be useful to experi-

ment with methods that can quickly generate sam-

ples other than the tree parsing method used in this 

paper. Despite the possibility of generating more 

coarse results, noisier method may be more scala-

ble for building practical applications with scaled 

live data.
