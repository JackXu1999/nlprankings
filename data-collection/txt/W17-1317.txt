Abstract

The success of machine learning for au-
tomatic speech processing has raised the
need for large scale datasets. However,
collecting such data is often a challenging
task as it implies significant investment in-
volving time and money cost. In this pa-
per, we devise a recipe for building large-
scale Speech Corpora by harnessing Web
resources namely YouTube, other Social
Media, Online Radio and TV. We illustrate
our methodology by building KALAM’DZ,
An Arabic Spoken corpus dedicated to Al-
gerian dialectal varieties. The preliminary
version of our dataset covers all major Al-
gerian dialects. In addition, we make sure
that this material takes into account nu-
merous aspects that foster its richness. In
fact, we have targeted various speech top-
ics. Some automatic and manual anno-
tations are provided. They gather use-
ful information related to the speakers and
sub-dialect information at the utterance
level. Our corpus encompasses the 8 ma-
jor Algerian Arabic sub-dialects with 4881
speakers and more than 104.4 hours seg-
mented in utterances of at least 6 s.

1 Introduction

Speech datasets and corpora are crucial for both
developing and evaluating Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) systems. Moreover, such corpora
have to be large to achieve NLP communities ex-
pectations. In fact, the notion of "More data is
better data" was born with the success of modeling
based on machine learning and statistical methods.

The applications that use speech corpora can
be grouped into four major categories: speech
recognition, speech synthesis, speaker recogni-

tion/verification and spoken language systems.
The need for such systems becomes inevitable.
These systems include real life wingspan appli-
cations such as speech searching engines and re-
cently Conversational Agents, conversation is be-
coming a key mode of human-computer interac-
tion.

The crucial points to be taken into consideration
when designing and developing relevant speech
corpus are numerous. The necessity that a cor-
pus takes the within-language variability (Li et al.,
2013). We can mention some of them: The corpus
size and scope, richness of speech topics and con-
tent, number of speakers, gender, regional dialects,
recording environment and materials. We have at-
tempted to cover a maximum of these considera-
tions. We will underline each considered point in
what follows.

For many languages, the state of the art of
designing and developing speech corpora has
achieved a mature situation. On the other extreme,
there are few corpora for Arabic (Mansour, 2013).
In spite that geographically, Arabic is one of the
most widespread languages of the world (Behn-
stedt and Woidich, 2013). It is spoken by more
than 420 million people in 60 countries of the
world (Lewis et al., 2015). Actually, it has two
major variants: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA),
and Dialectal Arabic. MSA is the official language
of all Arab countries. It is used in administrations,
schools, official radios, and press. However, DA
is the language of informal daily communication.
Recently, it became also the medium of commu-
nication on the Web, in chat rooms, social media
etc. This fact, amplifies the need for language re-
sources and language related NLP systems for di-
alects.

For some dialects, especially Egyptian and Lev-
antine, there are some investigations in terms of
building corpora and designing NLP tools. While,

very few attempts have considered Algerian Ara-
bic dialect. Which, make us affirm that the Al-
gerian dialect and its varieties are considered as
under-resourced language. In this paper, we tend
to fill this gap by giving a complete recipe to
build a large-size speech corpus. This recipe
can be adopted for any under-resourced language.
It eases the challenging task of building large
datasets by means of traditional direct recording.
Which is known as time and cost consuming. Our
idea relies on Web resources, an essential mile-
stone of our era. In fact, the Web 2.0, becomes
a global platform for information access and shar-
ing that allows collecting any type of data at scales
hardly conceivable in near past.

The proposed recipe is to build a speech cor-
pus for Algerian Arabic dialect varieties. For this
preliminary version, the corpus is annotated for
mainly supporting research in dialect and speaker
identification.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we review some related work
that have built DA corpora. In Section 3 we give a
brief overview of Algerian sub-dialects features.
Section 4 is dedicated to describe the complete
proposed recipe of building a Web-based speech
dataset. In Section 5, we show how this recipe
is narrated to construct a speech corpus for Alge-
rian dialectal varieties. The resulted corpus is de-
scribed in Section 6. We enumerate its potential
uses in Section 7

2 Related Work

In this section, we restricted our corpora review
to speech corpora dealing with Arabic dialects.
We classify them according to two criteria: col-
lecting method and Intra/Inter country dialect col-
lection context. They can be classified into five
categories according to the collecting method. In-
deed, it can be done by recording broadcast, spon-
taneous telephone conversations, telephone re-
sponses of questionnaires, direct recording and
Web-based resourcing. The second criterion dis-
tinguishes the origin of targeted dialects in ei-
ther Intra-country/region or Inter-country, which
means that the targeted dialects are from the same
country/region or dialects from different countries.
This criterion is chosen because it is harder to per-
form fine collection of Arabic dialects belonging
to close geographical areas that share many his-
toric, social and cultural aspects.

In contrast of relative abundance of speech cor-
pora for Modern Standard Arabic, very few at-
tempts have considered building Arabic speech
corpora for dialects. Table 1 reports some fea-
tures of the studied DA corpora. The first set of
corpora has exploited the limited solution of tele-
phony conversation recording. In fact, as far as
we know, development of the pioneer DA cor-
pus began in the middle of the nineties and it is
CALLFRIEND Egyptian (Canavan and Zipperlen,
1996). Another part of OrienTel project, cited
below, has been dedicated to collect speech cor-
pora for Arabic dialects of Egypt, Jordan, Mo-
rocco, Tunisia, and United Arab Emirates coun-
tries. In these corpora, the same telephone re-
sponse to questionnaire method is used. These
corpora are available via the ELRA catalogue 1.

The DARPA Babylon Levantine 2 Arabic speech
corpus gathers four Levantine dialects spoken by
speakers from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Pales-
tine (Makhoul et al., 2005).

Appen company has collected three Arabic di-
alects corpora by means of spontaneous telephone
conversations method. These corpora 3 uttered by
speakers from Gulf, Iraqi and Levantine. With
a more guided telephone conversation recording
protocol, Fisher Levantine Arabic corpus is avail-
able via LDC catalogue 4. The speakers are se-
lected from Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Lebanon,
Syria and other Levantine countries.

TuDiCoI (Graja et al., 2010) is a spontaneous
dialogue speech corpus dedicated to Tunisian di-
alect, which contains recorded dialogues between
staff and clients in the railway of Sfax town,
Tunisia.

Concerning corpora that gather MSA and Ara-
bic dialects, we have studied some of them.
SAAVB corpus is dedicated to speakers from all
the cities of Saudi Arabia country using telephone
response of questionnaire method (Alghamdi et
al., 2008). The main characteristic of this corpus
is that, before recording, a preliminary choice of
speakers and environment are performed. The se-
lection aims to control speaker age and gender and
telephone type.

corpus, which gathers MSA and three Arabic

dialects are from Gulf, Egypt and Levantine.
The speech data is collected by direct recording
method.

KSU Rich Arabic corpus encompasses speakers
by different ethnic groups, Arabs and non-Arabs
(Africa and Asia). Concerning Arab speakers in
this corpus, they are selected from nine Arab coun-
tries: Saudi, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Alge-
ria, Sudan, Lebanon and Palestine. This corpus is
rich in many aspects. Among them, the richness of
the recording text. In addition, different recording
sessions, environments and systems are taken into
account (Alsulaiman et al., 2013).

Al Jazeera multi-dialectal speech corpus, a
larger scale, based on Broadcast News of
Al Jazeera (Wray and Ali, 2015). Its annotation
is performed by crowd sourcing technology. It
encompasses the four major Arabic dialectal cat-
egories.

In an intra country context, there are two cor-

pora dedicated to Algerian Arabic dialect vari-
eties: AMCASC (Djellab et al., 2016) and ALG-
DARIDJAH (Bougrine et al., 2016). AMCASC cor-
pus, based on telephone conversations collecting
method, is a large corpus that takes three regional
dialectal varieties. While ALG-DARIDJAH cor-
pus is a parallel corpus that encompasses Algerian
Arabic sub-dialects. It is based on direct recording
method. Thus, many considerations are controlled
while building this corpus. Compared to AMCASC
corpus, the size of ALG-DARIDJAH corpus is re-
stricted.

According to our study of these major Arabic
dialects corpora, we underline some points. First,
these corpora are mainly fee-based and the free
ones are extremely rare. Second, almost exist-
ing corpora are dedicated to inter-country dialects.
Third, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
Web-based speech dataset/corpus that deals with
Arabic speech data neither for MSA nor for di-
alects. While for other languages, there are some
investigations. We can cite the large recent col-

140



lection Kalaka-3 (Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2016).
This is a speech database specifically designed for
Spoken Language Recognition. The dataset pro-
vides TV broadcast speech for training, and audio
data extracted from YouTube videos for testing. It
deals with European languages.

3 Algerian Dialects: Brief Overview

Algeria is a large country, administratively divided
into 48 departments. Its first official language is
Modern Standard Arabic. However, Algerian di-
alects are widely the predominant means of com-
munication. In Figure 1, we depict the main Alge-
rian dialect varieties. In this work, we focus on
Algerian Arabic sub-dialects as they are spoken
by 75% to 80% of the population. The Algerian
dialect is known as Daridjah to its speakers.

Algerian Arabic dialects resulted from two Ara-
bization processes due to the expansion of Islam
in the 7th and 11th centuries, which lead to the ap-
propriation of the Arabic language by the Berber
population.

According to both Arabization processes, di-
alectologists (Palva, 2006), (Pereira, 2011) show
that Algerian Arabic dialects can be divided into
two major groups: Pre-Hilālı̄ and Bedouin di-
alects. Both dialects are different by many linguis-
tic features (Marçais, 1986) (Caubet, 2000).

Firstly, Pre-Hilālı̄ dialect is called a sedentary
dialect. It is spoken in areas that are affected by the
expansion of Islam in the 7th century. At this time,
the partially affected cities are: Tlemcen, Con-
stantine and their rural surroundings. The other
cities have preserved their mother tongue language
(Berber).

Secondly, Bedouin dialect is spoken in areas
which are influenced by the Arab immigration in
the 11th century (Palva, 2006) (Pereira, 2011).
Marçais (1986) has divided Bedouin dialect into
four distinct dialects: i) Sulaymite dialect which
is connected with Tunisian Bedouin dialects, ii)
Ma’qilian dialect which is connected with Moroc-
can Bedouin dialects, iii) Hilālı̄ dialect contains
three nomadic sub-dialects. Hilālı̄-Saharan that
covers the totality of the Sahara of Algeria, the
Hilālı̄-Tellian dialect which its speakers occupy a
large part of the Tell of Algeria, and the High-
plains of Constantine, which covers the north of
Hodna region to Seybouse river. iv) Completely-
bedouin dialect that covers Algiers’ Blanks, and
some of its near sea coast cities. Regarding to

some linguistic differences, we have divided this
last dialect into two sub-dialects, namely Algiers-
Blanks and Sahel-Tell.

Arabic Algerian dialects present complex lin-
guistic features and many linguistic phenomena
can be observed. Indeed, there is many borrowed
words due to the deep colonization. In fact, Ara-
bic Algerian dialects are affected by other lan-
guages such as Turkish, French, Italian, and Span-
ish (Leclerc, 30 avril 2012). In addition, code
switching is omnipresent especially from French.

Versteegh et al. (2006) used four consonants
(the dentals fricative /t, d, d. / and a voiceless uvu-
lar stop /q/ ) to discriminate the two major groups:
Pre-Hilālı̄ and Bedouin dialect. In fact, he shows
that Pre-Hilālı̄ dialect are characterized by: /q/
is pronounced /k/ and the loss of inter-dentals
and pass into the dentals /t, d, d. /. For Alge-
rian Bedouin dialect, the four discriminative con-
sonants are characterized by: /q/ is pronounced
/g/ and the inter-dentals are fairly preserved. For
more details on Algerian linguistic features refer
to (Embarki, 2008) (Versteegh et al., 2006) (Har-
rat et al., 2016).

4 Methodology

In this section, we first describe, in general way,
the complete recipe to collect and annotate a Web-
based spoken dataset for an under-resourced lan-
guage/dialect. Then, we illustrate this recipe to
build our Algerian Arabic dialectal speech corpus
mainly dedicated to dialect and speaker identifica-
tion.

Global View of the Recipe

The recipe described in the following can be easily
tailored according to potential uses of the corpus
and on the specificities of the targeted language
resources and its spoken community.

1. Inventorying Potential Web sources: First,
we have to identify sources that are the
most targeted by the communities of the lan-
guages/dialects in concerns. Indeed, depend-
ing on their culture and preferences, some
communities show preference for dealing
with some Web media over others. For exam-
ple, Algerian people are less used to use In-
stagram or Snapchat compared with Middle
Est and Gulf ones. Moreover, each country
has its own most used communication media.
For instance, some societies (Arabs ones) are
more productive on TVs and Radios, com-
pared with west communities that are more
present and productive on social media.

2. Extraction Process: In order to avoid crawl-
ing useless data, this steps is achieved by
three stages

(a) Preliminary Validation Lists: For each
chosen Web source, we define the main
keywords that can help automatically
search video/audio lists. When such
lists are established, a first cleaning is
performed keeping only the potential
suitable data. Sizing such lists depends
on the sought scale.

(b) Providing the collection script: For each
resource, we fix and implement the suit-
able way to collect data automatically.
Open Source tools are the most suit-
able. In fact, downloading a speech
from a streaming or from YouTube or
even from online Tv needs different
scripts. The same fact has to be taken
into account concerning their related

metadata 5 which are very useful for an-
notation.

(c) Downloading: This is a time consum-
ing task. Thus, it is important to con-
sider many facts such as preparing stor-
age and downloading the related meta-
data, . . .

(d) Cleaning: Now, the videos/audios are
locally available, a first scan is per-
formed in order to keep the most appro-
priate data to the corpus concerns. This
can be achieved by establishing a strat-
egy depending on the corpus future use.

3. Annotation and Pre-processing: For a tar-
geted NLP task, pre-processing the col-
lected speech/video can include segmenta-
tion, White noise removing. . . . Some annota-
tions can simply be provided from the related
metadata of the Web-source when they exist.
However, this task makes use of other anno-
tation techniques like crowdsourcing where
crowd are called to identify the targeted di-
alect/speaker or/and perform translations.

The method can be generalized to other lan-
guages/dialects without linguistic and cultural
knowledge of the regional language or dialect by
using video/audio search query based on the area
(location) of targeted dialect/language. Then use
the power of crowdsourcing to annotate corpus.

5 Corpus Building

For the context of the Algerian dialects, in order to
build a speech corpus that is mainly dedicated to
dialect/speaker identification using machine learn-
ing techniques, we have chosen several resources.

5.1 Web Sources Inventory

The main aim is to allow the richness of the cor-
pus. In fact, it is well known that modeling a spo-
ken language needs a set of speech data counting
the within-language/intersession variability, such
as speaker, content, recording device, communi-
cation channel, and background noise (Li et al.,
2013). It is desirable to have sufficient data that
include the intended intersession effects.

Table 2 reports the main Web sources that feed
our corpus. Let us observe that there are several

5YouTube video Metadata such as published_date, dura-
tion, description, category. . .

speech Topics which allows capturing more lin-
guistics varieties. In fact, this inventory contains
"Local radio channels" resources. Fortunately,
each Algerian province has at least one local ra-
dio (a governmental one). It deals with local com-
munity concerns and exhibits main local events.
Some of their reports often use their own local di-
alect. It is the same case for amateur radios. Both,
these radio channels and Tvs are Web-streamed
live.

In addition, we have chosen some Algerian TVs
for which most programs are addressed to large
community. So, they use dialects. Finally, we
have targeted some YouTube resources such as Al-
gerian PodCasts, Algerian Tags, and channels of
Algerian YouTubers.

5.2 Extraction Process

Now having these Web sources, and as they are nu-
merous, we process in two steps in order to acquire
video/audio speech data. First, we drawn up lists
by crawling information mainly meta data about
existing data related to potential videos/audios that
potentially contain Algerian dialect speech. The
deployed procedure relies on mainly two different
scripts according to the Web resource type.

In order to collect speech data from local radio
channels, we refer back manually to the programs
of radio to select report and emission lists that are
susceptible to contain dialectal speech.

For data from YouTube, the lists are fed by us-
ing YouTube search engine through its Data API 6.

6YouTube Data API, https://developers.
google.com/YouTube/v3/

In addition, the extraction of related metadata are
performed using Python package BeautifulSoup
V 4 dedicated to Web crawling (Nair, 2014).

In order to draw up search queries, we have used
three lists. The first one Dep, contains the names
of the 48 Algerian provinces, spelled in MSA, di-
alect and French. While the second list Cat con-
tains the selected YouTube categories. Among the
actual YouTube categories, we have targeted: Peo-
ple & Blogs, Education, Entertainment, How-to &
Style, News & Politics, Non-profits & Activism cat-
egories, and Humor. The third list Comm_Word
contains a set of common Algerian dialect word
(called White Algerian terms) that are used by all
Algerians. These chosen set is reported in Ta-
ble 3. Then, we iterate searching using a search
query model that has four keywords. The first and
the second ones are from Dep and Cat lists re-
spectively. The remaining two keywords are se-
lected arbitrary from Comm_Word. This query
formulation can guarantee that speakers are from
the fixed province and the content topics are varied
thanks to YouTube topic classification.

Concerning Algerian TVs source, the search
queries are drawn up using mainly two keywords.
The first one is the name the channel and the sec-
ond word refers to the report name. In fact, a prior
list is filled manually with emission and report
names that uses dialects. Easily, videos from Al-
gerian YouTubers/Podcasts channels are searched
using the name of the corresponding author.

Table 3: Common Algerian terms used as Keywords

For all YouTube search queries, we selected the
first 100 videos (when available). When lists are
drawn up, we start the cleaning process that dis-
cards the irrelevant video entries. In fact, we re-
move all list entries whose duration is less than
5s. The videos whose topic shows that it doesn’t
deal with dialects are also discarded. This is done
by analyzing manually the video title then its de-
scription and keywords.

In addition, to be in compliance with YouTube
Terms of Services, first, we take into account the
existence of any Creative Commons license asso-

143



ciated to the video.
The whole cleaning process leads us to keep

1182 Audios/videos among 4 000 retrieved ones.
Video’s length varies between 6s and 1 hour. The
cleaning task was carried out by the authors of this
paper.

Now, the download process is launched using
the resulting cleaned lists. Concerning the data
from radio channels, we script a planned recording
of the reports from the stream of the radio. Here
also the recording amount depends on the desired
scale.

Concerning the data from Radios, we deploy, in
the download script, mainly the VLC Media Player
tool 7 with the cron Linux command. In order
to download videos from YouTube, we have de-
ployed YouTube-dl 8 a command-line program.

5.3 Preprocessing and Annotation

A collection of Web speech data is not immedi-
ately suitable for exploration in the same way a
traditional corpus is. It needs more cleaning and
preprocessing. Let us recall, that our illustrative
corpus will serve for dialect/speaker identification
using machine learning techniques. For that pur-
pose, for each downloaded video, we have applied
the following processing:

1. Audio extraction: FFmpeg 9 tool is used
to extract the audio layer. In addition, the
SoX 10 tool, a sound processing program, is
applied to get single-channel 16 kHz WAV
audio files.

2. Non-speech segments removal: such as music
or white noise by running a VAD (Voice Ac-
tivation Detection) tool to remove as many as
possible.

3. Speaker Diarization: is performed to de-
termine who speaks when, and to assign
for each utterance a speaker ID. It is
achieved using VoiceID Python library based
on the LIUM Speaker Diarization frame-
work (Meignier and Merlin, 2010). The out-
put from VoiceID segmentation is a set of au-
dio files with information about speaker ID,
and utterance duration.

Table 4: Corpus Global Statistics.

For this preliminary version, most manual anno-
tations are made thanks to authors themselves with
the help of 8 volunteers. These In Lab annotations
concern assigning for each utterance the spoken
dialect, validation of speaker gender (previously
detected automatically by VoiceID). During these
manual annotations, we check that utterances deal
with dialect. Otherwise, they are discarded.

6 Corpus Main Features

First of all, we note that this preliminary version
of our corpus is collected and annotated in less
than two months, and the building is still an ongo-
ing process. A sample of our corpus is available
online 11. KALAM’DZ covers most major Ara-
bic sub-dialects of Algeria. Table 4 reports some
global statistics of the resulted corpus. Clean
Speech Ratio row gives the ratio of Speeches that
have good sound quality. The remaning portion of
speeches present some noise background mainly
music or they are recorded in outdoor. However,
they can be used to build dialect models in order
to represent the within-language variability.

More details on KALAM’DZ corpus are re-
ported in Table 5. Let us observe that some di-
alects are more represented. This is due to people
distribution and Web culture. For instance, Algiers
and Oran are metropolitan cities. So their produc-
tivity on the Web is more abundant.

In order to facilitate the deployment of
KALAM’DZ corpus, we have adopted the same
packaging method as TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic
Continuous Speech Corpus (Garofolo et al.,
1993).

7 Potential Uses

KALAM’DZ built corpus can be considered as the
first of its kind in term a rich speech corpus for
Algerian Arabic dialects using Web resources. It
can be useful for many purposes both for NLP and
computational linguistic communities. In fact, it

can be used for building models for both speaker
and dialect identification systems for the Algerian
dialects. For linguistic and sociolinguistics com-
munities, it can serve as base for capturing dialects

All videos related to extracted audio data are
also available. This can be deployed to build an-
other corpus version to serve any image/video pro-
cessing based applications.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we have devised a recipe in or-
der to facilitate building large-scale Speech cor-
pus which harnesses Web resources. In fact, the
used methodology makes building a Web-based
corpus that shows the within-language variability.
In addition, we have narrated this procedure for
building KALAM’DZ a speech corpus dedicated
to the whole Algerian Arabic sub-dialects. We
have been ensured that this material takes into ac-
count numerous speech aspects that foster its rich-
ness and provides a representation of linguistic va-
rieties. In fact, we have targeted various speech
topics. Some automatic and manual annotations
are provided. They gather useful information re-
lated to the speakers and sub-dialect information at
the utterance level. This preliminary KALAM’DZ
version encompasses the 8 major Algerian Ara-
bic sub-dialects with 4881 speakers and more than
104.4 hours.

Mainly developed to be used in dialect identifi-
cation, KALAM’DZ can serve as a testbed support-
ing evaluation of wide spectrum of NLP systems.

In future work, we will extend the corpus by
collecting Algerian sub-dialects uttered by Berber
native speakers. As the corpus building is still
an ongoing work, its evaluation is left to a future
work. In fact, we plan to evaluate the corpus on
dialects identification in intra-country context.
