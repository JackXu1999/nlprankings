Abstract

In this paper1 we present an extension of MC-
TAGs with Local Shared Derivation (Seddah,
2008) which can handle non local elliptic co-
ordinations. Based on a model for control
verbs that makes use of so-called ghost trees,
we show how this extension leads to an analy-
sis of argument cluster coordinations that pro-
vides an adequate derivation graph. This is
made possible by an original interpretation of
the MCTAG derivation tree mixing the views
of Kallmeyer (2005) and Weir (1988).

1 Introduction

Elliptic coordinate structures are a challenge for
most constituent-based syntactic theories. To model
such complex phenomena, many works have argued
in favor of factorized syntactic structures (Maxwell
and Manning, 1996), while others have argued for
distributive structures that include a certain amount
of non-lexically realized elements (Beavers and Sag,
2004). Of course, the boundary between those two
approaches is not sharp since one can decide to first
build a factorized syntactic analysis and then con-
struct a more distributive structure (e.g., logical or
functional).

So far, the Combinatorial Categorial Grammar
(CCG) framework (Steedman, 2001) is considered
as one of the most elegant theories in accounting
for coordination. Indeed, the CCG syntactic layer,
which is closely tied to an syntax-semantic interface
handled in a lexicalized way, permits the coordina-
tion of nonstandard constituents that cause a non-
trivial challenge for other frameworks. On the other

ments. All remaining errors would be ours.

hand, some phenomena such as coordination of un-
like categories are still a challenge for theories based
on strict atomic category coordination.

In the broader context of ellipsis resolution, Dal-
rymple et al. (1991) propose to consider elided ele-
ments as free logical variables resolved using Higher
Order Unification as the solving operation. Inspired
by this approach and assuming that non-constituent
coordination can be analyzed with ellipsis (Beavers
and Sag, 2004),2 we consider elliptic coordination as
involving parallel structures where all non lexically
realized syntactic elements must be represented in
a derivation structure. This path was also followed
by Seddah (2008) who proposed to use the ability
of Multi Component TAGs (MCTAGs) (Weir, 1988)
to model such a parallelism by including conjunct
trees in a same tree set. This simple proposal allows
for a straightforward analysis of gapping construc-
tions. The coverage of this account is then extended
by introducing links called local shared derivations
which, by allowing derivations to be shared across
trees of a same set, permit to handle various elliptic
coordinate structures in an efficient way. This work
showed that, assuming the use of regular operators
to handle n-ary coordinations, a broad range of co-
ordinate structures could be processed using a Tree-
Local MCTAG-based formalism named Tree Local
MCTAG with Local Shared Derivations. Neverthe-
less, being tied to the domain of locality of a tree set,
the very nature of this mechanism forbids the shar-
ing of derivations between different tree sets, thus
preventing it from analyzing non-local elliptic coor-
dinations.

In this paper, we introduce an extension of this
model that can handle non-local elliptic coordi-
nation — close to unbounded ellipsis (Milward,
1994) —, which can be found in structures involving

control verbs and elliptic coordinations.
We also show how our model can cope with argu-
ment cluster coordination and why an interpretation
of the derivation tree mixing David Weir’s (1988)
original view of MCTAG derivation tree, where each
MC set is interpreted as a unique node, and the
one introduced by Laura Kallmeyer (2005), where
the derivations are the ones from the underlying
TAG grammar, is required to yield a derivation tree
as close as possible to a proper predicate-argument
structure.

2 Standard elliptic coordinate structures

An MCTAG account of many coordinate structures
involving ellipsis has been proposed by Seddah
(2008). The core idea is to use the extended MC-
TAG’s domain of locality to enforce a somewhat
strict parallelism between coordinate structures.

For example, gapping, as in (1) can be modeled,
without any specific operation, by including in a
same MC-Set two trees that are identical except for
one thing: one is fully lexicalized whereas the other
one is anchored by an empty element.

(1) Jean aimei Marie et Paul εi Virginie
John lovesi Mary and Paul εi Virginia

Calling this second lexically unrealized tree a
ghost tree, the missing anchor can be retrieved sim-
ply because the tree it anchors is in the same MC-Set
as its ghost tree. In other words, the label of the MC-
Set includes the anchor of its fully lexicalized tree.
The application of this model to (1) is shown in Fig-
ure 1.
Note that this account only requires the expressiv-
ity of Tree-Local MCTAGs and that unlike other
approaches for gapping in the LTAG framework

(Sarkar and Joshi, 1996; Seddah and Sagot, 2006;
Lichte and Kallmeyer, 2010), this proposal for gap-
ping does not require any special device or modifi-
cation of the formalism itself.

In order to model derivations that involve the eli-
sion of one syntactic verbal argument as in right
node raising cases (RNR) or right subject elision co-
ordinations, the formalism is extended with oriented
links, called local shared derivation (local SD), be-
tween mandatory derivation site nodes: whenever a
derivation is not realized on a given node and assum-
ing that a local SD has been defined between this
node and one possible antecedent, a derivation be-
tween those nodes is inserted in the derivation struc-
ture.3

Furthermore, if the constraint of having identical
tree schema in a tree set (one being fully lexical-
ized and the other anchored by an empty element)
is relaxed, one gets the possibility to give more flex-
ibility to the structure parallelism enforced by this
model of gapping. This is what is needed to handle
coordination of unlike categories and zeugma con-
structions (Seddah, 2008).
In the same spirit, by viewing the anchoring pro-
cess as a regular derivation4, and hence allowing lo-
cal SDs to occur on anchoring derivations as well,
one can get a very flexible model allowing for trees,
sharing the same tree schema but with different an-
chors, to be coordinated. Thus, RNRs are simply
analyzed in this framework by having two identi-
cal tree schema anchored by two different verbs and
with one local shared derivation occurring from the
N1 node of the right conjunct tree to the N1 of its

local shared one.

3 MCTAG with Local Shared Derivations

Following Kallmeyer (2005), we define an MCTAG
as a tuple GMCTAG = 〈I, A,N, T, S〉, where I
(resp. A) is the set of initial (resp. auxiliary) trees,
N (resp. T ) the set of nonterminal (resp. terminal)
labels and S the set of elementary MC-Sets. A MC-
TAG with Local Shared Derivations (MCTAG-LSD)
G whose underlying MCTAG is GMCTAG is defined
as G = 〈I, A,N, T, S, L〉, where L is the set of ori-
ented links between two leaf nodes of two trees in a
same MC-Set in S.

MCTAG-LSD derivations extend derivations of
the underlying MCTAG by allowing for local shared
derivations, that we shall now define.

Let Γ = {γ0, . . . , γn} be an MC-Set in S. Let
LΓ be the set of (oriented) links in Γ, i.e. pairs of the
form 〈NL, NR〉 where NL and NR are nodes in two
different trees in Γ. Let us suppose that:

• a tree γ′ is substituted on a node NL in a tree γi

• there exists a node NR in another tree γj ∈ Γ
such that 〈NL, NR〉 is in LΓ

Then, a local shared derivation can be created as fol-
lows:

• a substitution link between γ′ and γj is added in
the derivation structure; thus, γ′ has at least two
ancestors (γi and γj) in the derivation structure,
which becomes a DAG instead of a tree;

• an initial tree anchored by an empty element is
substituted on the node NR.5

Note that this also applies for mandatory adjunc-
tions, besides substitutions.

Any MCTAG derivation is a valid MCTAG-LSD
derivation. However, local shared derivations al-
low for performing additional derivation operations.

5Another possibility would be to merge NR with NL, as for
example in (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996). However, this leads to
derived DAGs instead of trees.

Therefore, the language generated by G strictly con-
tains the language generated by GMCTAG. How-
ever, these additional derivations can be simulated
in a pure MCTAG fashion, as follows. For a given
MCTAG-LSD MC-Set that contains a unique local
shared derivation link, we can generate two MC-
TAG MC-Sets, one that would enforce the substi-
tution by lexicalized trees at both ends of the link,
and one that would enforce the substitution of a lex-
icalized tree at the starting node of the link and the
substitution of a ghost tree at the other end of the
link. This mechanism can be generalized to MC-
Sets with more than one local shared derivation.
This skteches the proof that the set of languages gen-
erated by MCTAG-LSDs is the same as that gener-
ated by MCTAGs. Therefore, MCTAG-LSDs and
MCTAGs have the same weak generative capacity.
Moreover, these considerations still hold while re-
stricting GMCTAG to be TL-MCTAG. Therefore,
TL-MCTAG-LSDs and TL-MCTAGs have the same
weak generative power.
In order to cope with very large grammar size, the
use of regular operators to factorize out TAG trees
has been proposed by (Villemonte de La Clergerie,
2005), and has lead to a drastic reduction of the num-
ber of trees in the grammar. The resulting formalism
is called factorized TAGs and was adapted by Sed-
dah (2008) to the MCTAG-LSD framework in order
to handle n-ary coordinations. The idea is to factor-
ize MCTAG-LSD sets that have the same underly-
ing MCTAG set (i.e. they are identical if links are
ignored). Indeed, all such MC sets can be merged
into one unique tree set associated with the union of
all corresponding link sets. However, as with factor-
ized TAGs, we need to add to the resulting tree set
a list of constraints, R, on the construction of local
shared derivations. The result is an extended for-
malism, called factorized MCTAG-LSD, which does
not extend the expressive power of MCTAG-LSD
but allows for more compact descriptions. Our re-
sulting coordination scheme is shown on Figures 3
and Figure 4.

4 The case for Unbounded Ellipsis

The problem with this model is its heavy depen-
dence on the domain of locality of a tree set. In fact,
if creating a link between two derivation site nodes
inside the same tree set is straightforward, things
become complicated if the derivations that must be
shared involve two nodes from different tree sets.
For example, in cases involving a control verb and
right-subject ellipsis such as in (3), the subject is
shared among the three verbs, although the control
verb elementary tree (see Figure 6) cannot be in the
same tree set as the others.6

4.1 Control Verb and MCTAG

Regarding the control verb phenomenon, an LTAG
analysis was proposed by Seddah and Gaiffe (2005)7

involving a complex parsing device, the so-called
argumental fusion, and a lexicon based information
structure, the control canvas, stating which argu-
ment is controlled by the verb (e.g. subject for to

tially proposed by Abeillé (1998).

hope and object for to forbid). The idea there was
to view control verbs as capable of transferring their
controlled argument to the trees in which they ad-
join by the means of partial derivations, allowing for
the creation of a pseudo-derivation between the ar-
gument of the control verb tree (i.e. Control Tree)
and the embedded verb. This pseudo-derivation
accounts for the fact that a syntactic argument of
the embedded verb is not realized whereas its mor-
phological features are actually transfered from the
Control Tree substitution node through percolation
of its feature structure,8 thus making the underly-
ing unrealized derivation explicit.9 Figure 6 gives
an overview of the process leading to a derivation
graph.

Note that similarly to the initial LTAG implemen-
tation discussed above, where the argumental fusion
could only occur on the node of a tree where the con-
trol tree was to adjoin, it is necessary to restrict the
substitution of the control verb MC set’s single node
in the same way. In other words, to avoid overgen-
eration, in the case of chain of controls ( e.g., John
hopes to forbid Mary to sleep), the derivations of a
control verb MC set’s trees must be tree local.10

4.2 Control Verb and Coordination

Until now, we have assumed that only initial trees
anchored by verbs could be described in an MC-Set
together with their ghost trees. Therefore, there is no
way to create derivation links between different MC-
Sets for providing an elegant analysis of (3) while re-

tion.

maining in TL-MCTAG-LSD. Nevertheless, nothing
prevents us from allowing nominal trees to be char-
acterized in the same way. This allows a (lexically)
anchored tree to substitute into a tree of a given MC-
Set while one of its ghost trees substitutes into an-
other tree from a different tree set. Thus, it becomes
possible to substitute a tree anchored by Jean into
the tree anchored by dormir, while its unrealized
counterpart will substitute into the argument node
of the control verb, therefore allowing the derivation
tree displayed in Figure 5a. As one tree is derived
into one MC-Set and its ghost tree into another, this
analysis falls beyond TL-MCTAG, and benefits from
the larger expressivity of NL-MCTAGs.
It shall be noted that having an unrestricted poten-
tial number of unrealized ghost trees inside a nomi-
nal MC-Set means that a substitution of such a ghost
tree can occur in lieu of a shared derivation, thus al-
lowing coindexations of derivation nodes instead of
sharing (cf. Figure 5b).
This potential source of ambiguity could be circum-
vented by stating precedence rules between shared
derivations and ghost derivations (i.e. derivation of
ghost trees). Nevertheless, such an ambiguity is pre-
cisely what is needed to provide an analysis of argu-
ment cluster coordination in our framework, as we
shall now demonstrate.

5 Argument cluster coordination

Assuming an ellipsis analysis for argument cluster
coordination (ACC; (Beavers and Sag, 2004)), sen-
tences such as (4) can be simply analyzed as a case
of gapping plus a right subject elision in our frame-
work. This requires an MC-Set α-donner which in-
cludes a tree anchored by donner/give and its ghost
tree, as depicted in Figure 8.

(4) Jeani donnej une fleur à Marie et εi εj une
bague à Paul
John gives Mary a flower and Paul, a ring

However, let us assume an analysis involving a right
subject elision and a gapping of the main verb. Then,
using the extension of our framework that we de-
fined for handling unbounded ellipsis (section 4), the
subject of εj can be obtained in two different ways:
(i) via a local shared derivation as sketched in the
previous sections (no ghost tree is needed in the MC-
Set α-Jean, which contains one unique tree); or (ii)
as a ghost tree that belongs to the MC-Set α-Jean.

Note that if we follow Weir’s (1988) original defi-
nition of MCTAG derivation, both ways to obtain the
subject lead to the same derivation structure. Our
own model implies that derivation steps with LSD
or involving ghost trees will lead to different struc-
tures. This comes from the fact that our model is
based on Kallmeyer’s per-tree interpretation of MC-
TAG derivation.

More precisely, Weir’s definition of MCTAG
derivation always implies a sharing, whereas
Kallmeyer’s own definition leads to two different,
possibly co-indexed, nodes. These two possible in-
terpretations of derivation can handle the difference
between (i) an elided anchor that refers to the same
individual or event as the anchor of the lexicalized
tree in the same MC-Set (as Jean in (4)) and (ii) an
elided anchor that refers to another (co-indexed) in-
stance of the same class of individuals, or events, (as
fleur/flower in (5)).

(5)

Jeani donnej une fleurk bleue à Marie et
Johni givesj a blue flowerk to Mary and

εi εj une εk rouge à Paul
εi εj a red (one)k to Paul

Therefore, what we need is a mechanism that can
determine whether a given MC-Set denotes a unique

event or individual, the latter corresponding to the
sharing case or a list of events or individuals that are
instances of the same class of events or individuals.
Such a mechanism requires more than just syntactic
information, typically it needs to rely on an adequate
type system.

Let us consider again example (5). Whatever
the interpretation of the derivation operations, the
derivation runs as follows. Nominal MC-sets α-fleur
and α-Jean include ghost trees, whereas the auxil-
iary trees β-bleu and β-rouge have no ghost trees.11

The auxiliary tree in β-bleu adjoins to the non-ghost
tree in α-fleur while the one in β-rouge adjoins to
the ghost tree in α-fleur. The determiners are treated
in the same way. Next, the tree based on the non-
ghost tree in α-fleur substitutes in the non-ghost tree
in α-donner, whereas the other tree substitutes in the
ghost tree in α-donner.12 The gapping and right sub-
ject elision are then handled as in Section 2.

Now, let us suppose that we associate the MC-
Set α-Jean with a type <e> and the MC-Set α-
fleur with type <e, t>. Let us postulate that
we use Kallmeyer’s per-tree interpretation for MC-
Sets with type <e, t> and Weir’s interpretation for
MC-Sets with type <e>, the resulting derivation
structure would be exactly the expected predicate-
argument structure as shown in Figure 9b and will
only require the expressive power of Set Local MC-
TAGs.

To show how such a structure could be gener-
ated, we assumed a rather naive syntax-semantics
interface where all elements of a nominal MC-set
have the same scope, regardless of their semantic
types. That is, as pointed out by an anonymous re-
viewer, if an NP is right-node-raised, or undergoes
a right-subject elision,13 we can have an NP with
type <e, t> that leads to a wide scope reading which
would imply a single node in the derivation tree. In
fact, should we want to distinguish between narrow

11Allowing unlimited adjunction of ghost auxiliary trees
would lead to many spurious ambiguities, whereas having
modal verbs or adverbs together with their ghost trees in a MC
set would certainly be a step toward an elegant treatment of
elided modifiers.

12To avoid spurious ambiguities when ghost trees are substi-
tuted, Local Shared Derivations could be used to check that the
right ghost tree has been derived wrt to its antecedent.

εi is likely to win the lottery.

and wide scope readings, we would need a richer
model that could infer scope information from all
trees of a MC-set. It would be very interesting to
see how a model à la Kallmeyer and Joshi (2003)
could be integrated in our framework. In fact, the
idea of adding another type of node carrying scope
information through the derivation structure seems
natural considering the nature of our proposal.

6 Discussion

If syntactic and semantic structures were tied by a
strict isomorphism, the TAG derivation tree, with
its strict encoding of subcategorized arguments,
could have been considered as a proper predicate-
argument structure. Unfortunately, due to a lack of
expressive power, most of the complicated cases of
mismatch between syntax and semantics cannot be
formalized without breaking the elegance of TAGs’
main property, namely that dealing with elementary
trees means dealing with partial dependency struc-
tures. Over the last fifteen years, solving this prob-
lem has mobilized many teams, and, as noted by
(Nesson and Shieber, 2006), led to the emergence of
two schools. One focusing on giving more expres-
sive power to the formalism in order to ease either
a tight integration between the logical and the syn-
tactic layers (Kallmeyer and Joshi, 1999; Gardent
and Kallmeyer, 2003) or a capacity to handle, for
instance, free word order languages (Lichte, 2007).
The other school focuses either on keeping the syn-
tactic TAG backbone as pure as possible, by design-
ing a new derivation operation to handle coordina-
tion (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996) or on carefully de-
signing a syntax-semantic interface built upon TAG
derivations (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber and
Nesson, 2007). Our proposal stands in between as
we acknowledge that pure TAGs are not powerful

enough to carry on simple analysis of complex phe-
nomena while bringing the derivation tree closer to
a predicate-argument structure. Recent proposals
in the synchronous TAG framework share the same
concern. In fact, Shieber and Nesson (2007) use
Vector MCTAG (Rambow, 1994), for its ability to
underspecify dominance relations and provide the
synchronized logical layer with a derivation struc-
ture suitable for the analysis of control verbs. How-
ever, as we have shown, our solution for control re-
quires a generalization of the mechanism designed
for handling elliptic coordination that needs the ex-
pressive power of Non Local MCTAGs and tight in-
tegration of our proposal with a syntax-semantic in-
terface. This raises two open questions: What gen-
erative power do we really need to build appropriate
derivation structures? More importantly, where do
we want syntax to stop?

7 Conclusion

We have shown how to extend an MCTAG account
of coordination with a simple mechanism added on
top of its extended domain of locality and which en-
ables the handling of more complex constructions
involving control verbs and elliptic coordinations.
We have also shown how argument cluster coor-
dinations could be treated in our framework with-
out any special treatment besides the inclusion of a
small type inference system if one wants to provide a
proper dependency structure. Our work also shows
that our treatment of such coordinate constructions
needs the expressive power of Non Local MCTAGs
to cope with unbounded ellipsis and Set Local MC-
TAGs for ACC.
