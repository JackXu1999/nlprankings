Abstract 

In this paper, we present a survey covering the last 20 years of machine translation work in 
the Philippines.  We detail the various approaches used and innovations applied.  We also 
discuss the various mechanisms and support that keep the MT community thriving, as well 
as the challenges ahead. 

1. Introduction 

The Philippines is a country in Southeast Asia with 7,107 islands, and 187 languages – broken 
down as follows: 175 are indigenous, 8 are non-indigenous, and 4 are already extinct1.  The 
official languages are: (1) Filipino, which was based on Tagalog and has 45 million L2 users2; 
and (2) English.  Because the country is a gold mine for language data, there is already a 
thriving Natural Language Processing (NLP) community as evidenced by the existence of the 
following: the Computing Society of the Philippines – Special Interest Group on Natural 
Language Processing (CSP SIG-NLP)3; various institutions and research laboratories working 
on NLP4,5; venues to share ideas and knowledge like the National NLP Research Symposium 
(NNLPRS)6; and hosting of international conferences such as the 31st Pacific Asia Conference 
on Language, Information and Computation or PACLIC 31 (2017)7. 

One work (Raga, 2016) looked at the progress of NLP research in the country by 
reviewing 12 editions of NNLPRS.  Our work differs in that we are focused on machine 
translation and we also looked at other venues.  With NNLPRS as starting point, we branched 
out to cover the references the authors cited, other conference proceedings, journal issues, and 
works by members of CSP SIG-NLP.  We took note of the approaches used, data size, and 
innovations applied. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we present the evolution of 
machine translation in the Philippines by presenting the various approaches used over time; in 
section 3, we discuss the different innovations applied from data collection to evaluation; we 
tackle the challenges in section 4; and we conclude our work in section 5.

2. Approaches 

Machine translation started in the late ‘90s covering the two official languages (Roxas et al., 
1999): Filipino/Tagalog and English.  It later on included other Philippines languages8 such as 
Cebuano (Yara, 2007), Kankanaey (Ananayo et al., 2011), Maranao (Dimalen et al., 2009), 
Hiligaynon (Macabante et al., 2017), Ilocano (Miguel and Dy, 2008; Bautista et al., 2015; 
Lazaro et al., 2017), and Bicol (Fernandez et al., 2018).  Applications of machine translation 
since then can be grouped into three: (1) in tourism (Lazaro et al., 2017); (2) in translating 
informational materials such as books for mother tongue-based – multilingual education or 
MTB-MLE (Oco et al., 2016); and (3) in humanitarian technologies, for example to assist 
policy makers make sense of community input (Octaviano et al., 2018).  We’ve seen that 
early works only tackled declarative and imperative statements but the advent of statistical 
machine translation (Nocon et al., 2014) paved the way to also include interrogative 
statements.  We have observed that all serious research undertaking has been supported in part 
by government funding.  It started with transfer-based approaches and succeeding projects 
have seen rule-based, corpus-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches.  In the 
succeeding text, we discuss these projects and the approaches used, and direction. 

2.1. Transfer-based approaches 

Machine translation in the Philippines traces its early roots to transfer-based approaches.  One 
such project is IsaWika! (Roxas et al., 1999), an English-Tagalog machine translator for 
declarative and imperative sentences, that used an augmented transition network and a dic-
tionary size of less than 10,000 entries.  The project’s second phase started in 1998 and was 
funded by the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Advanced 
Science and Technology Research and Development (DOST-PCASTRD).  This was 
immediately followed by a project (Borra, 1999) which explored lexical functional grammar 
or LFG as the grammar formalism.  The f-structure and c-structures also showed promise in 
identifying translation errors.  LFG would be a staple in machine translation projects with 
XLE parser (Frank et al., 1998) as the core.  One project (Borra et al., 2007) used a transfer 
dictionary with 2,000 parallel word pairs while another project (Cada et al., 2012) used a 
bootstrapping technique to develop a larger parallel corpus from earlier works.  Recent 
developments include the use of a natural language generator called Linguist’s Assistant 
(Allman et al., 2014) to translate religious text9.  It is being used to build lexicons and gram-
mars in Filipino, Ayta Mag-indi, and Botolan languages, and can be used towards developing 
materials for mother tongue-based – multilingual education or MTB-MLE (Oco et al., 2016), 
a form of education where children’s mother tongue are used as the primary mode of teaching 
until primary school.  In all transfer-based projects, we have noticed that the corpus size is 
limited and vocabulary is only within the scope of available resources. 

2.2. Corpus-based 

Seeing the limitations of manually creating rules in a transfer-based approach, various corpora 
were soon utilized.  After IsaWika!, DOST-PCASTRD funded a hybrid English-Filipino 
machine translation system from 2005 to 2008 (Roxas, 2006; Roxas et al., 2008).  It combined 
both transfer-based and corpus-based approaches. 

                                                      
8Both Kankanaey and Maranao are considered indigenous languages 
9A version of Linguist’s Assistant called “The Bible Translator’s Assistant” is being used to translate 
books of the Bible to low-resource Philippine languages.  Website:

The transfer-based approach used an LFG formalism while the corpus-based 
approaches extracted patterns (Alcantara et al., 2006) from a large document and stored them 
in templates (Go et al., 2007).  The project used a parallel corpus with 207,000 Filipino words 
and a dictionary with 4,000 words.  For hybrid systems, the challenge is integrating results 
from multiple machine translators.  One solution is to develop a module that can provide 
translation scores. 

2.3. Statistical 

The Network-based ASEAN Languages Translation Public Service or ASEANMT saw the 
introduction of statistical approaches.  It aims to “build a practical network-based service on 
ASEAN languages text translation in the tourism domain. ASEAN languages resources and 
knowledge of the translation technology are availably shared among ASEAN member states 
and other countries”10.  It is supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
Committee on Science and Technology (ASEAN COST).  The Center for Language 
Technologies at De La Salle University represented the country in this project with funding 
from the Commission on Higher Education for the counterpart system (Ilao et al., 2015; 
Nocon et al., 2014).  Moses engine11 was used with covering 20,000 sentence pairs on the 
tourism domain and at least 100,000 thousand sentence pairs derived from Wikipedia articles 
and manually translated.  A demo version is available online12. 

2.4. Directions 

We see the direction of machine translation to be heading towards deep learning because of 
the availability of approaches to automatically build parallel corpora.  One work (Tacorda et 
al., 2017), also supported by government funding13, utilized RNN with 100,000 pairs of sen-
tences and integrated byte pair encoding (BPE) to reduce out-of-vocabulary errors (OOVs).  
BPE works by segmenting a token into identifiable sequences.  This allowed for tokens not 
present in the training data to be recognized if its root and affixes have been identified 
through BPE.  The danger is with false positives: character sequences part of the root can be 
identified falsely as an affix. 

Aside from deep learning, recent trends in machine translation focused on its applica-
tion in humanitarian technologies.  As example, one project (Octaviano et al., 2018) is in-
volved in eParticipation, specifically in cross-lingual topic modeling – translating community 
responses and generating topic models through LDA – to make sense of community inputs.  
Qualitative evaluation showed cross-lingual topic modeling generated more coherent topic 
models.  Another work (Fernandez et al., 2018) aims at assisting non-linguists in translating 
questions for survey use. 

3. Innovations 

Aside from BPE, other innovations to reduce OOVs include the use of domain adaptation 
techniques (Lazaro et al., 2017) by filtering the training data, and allowing users to provide 
correction through feedback (Ang et al., 2015).  Other projects addressed OOVs by increasing 
the training data through automatic means.  One work (Dimalen and Roxas), crawled the web

and automatically identified the language through a trigram ranking approach.  Odds-ratio 
was applied since closely related languages yield to lower recall rates.  Other researchers have 
attempted to find bilingual pairs of terms (Lat et al., 2006) and sentences (Tabaranza et al., 
2016) in comparable corpora.  There are also attempts to gamify manual translation (Ilao et 
al., 2016) in role-playing games: if the user wants to earn more credit points, he/she can trans-
late phrases and there’s an automatic scoring mechanism that rewards the user after a given 
time frame.  There are also those (Octaviano et al., 2018) that apply spell checking and lan-
guage identification as pre-processing step to clean the data.  To assist translators, one work 
(Oco and Borra, 2011) utilized Transifex in localizing labels and instructions.  Another al-
lowed linguists to provide semantic representations (Allman et al., 2014). 

As for evaluation, the ASEAN MT asked manual annotators to evaluate machine 
translation output and provide a rating from 1 to 5, with the highest having semantic equiva-
lence with the manually translated one.  Another (Allman et al., 2014) asked students to read 
manually translated and automatically translated materials and an assessment task was given.  
Those who were given the automatically translated material as reference scored higher than 
those who were given manually translated materials. 

4. Challenges 

Aside from free-word order, there are other challenges that make translation work in the Phil-
ippines interesting: 

 Verbs have both tense and focus (Ramos and Cena, 1990). 

 Affixes can be divided into prefix, infix, suffix, circumfixation, and there is 
also affix reduplication (Schachter and Otanes, 1972). 

 Plurality exists in pronouns, modifiers, and verbs (Ramos, 1971; Cubar and 
Cubar, 1994; Kroeger, 1993). 

 

5. Conclusion 

We have surveyed projects covering the last 20 years of machine translation work in the coun-
try.  We have observed that funding and support from the government combined with venues 
that allow the flow and sharing of knowledge enabled researchers to advance the growth of 
the field.  The lack of available resources provided researchers problems to work on and for 
innovations to surface.  Through various means, we noted that researchers are able to be con-
stantly updated on recent trends.  Most of the works we presented in this paper focused only 
on text and it highlights that there are still room for speech to speech translation.
