Abstract

Over the span of human existence our brains have evolved into sophis-

ticated multimodal social signal processing machines. We are experts

at detecting and decoding information from a variety of sources and

interpreting this information in a social context. The human face is

one of the most important social channels that plays a key role in the

human communication chain. Today, with computer animated characters

becoming ubiquitous in games and media, and social robots starting to

bring human-like social interaction capabilities into the physical world, it

is possible to build applications that leverage the unique human capability

for social communication new ways to assist our lives and support us in a

variety of domains.

This talk will cover a series of experiments attempting to quantise

the effect of several traits of computer generated characters/robots such as

visual speech movements, non-verbal signals, physical embodiment and

manual signing. It is shown that a number of human functions ranging

from low-level speech perception to learning can benefit from the presence

of such characters when compared to unimodal (e.g. audio-only) settings.

Two examples are given of applications where these effects are exploited

in order to provide support for people with special needs – a virtual

lipreading support application for hard of hearing and a signing avatar

game for children with communicative disorders.
