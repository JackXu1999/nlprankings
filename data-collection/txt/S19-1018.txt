Abstract

To model conditionals in a way that reflects
their acceptability, we must include some
means of making judgements about whether
antecedent and consequent are meaningfully
related or not. Enthymemes are non-logical ar-
guments which do not hold up by themselves,
but are acceptable through their relation to a
topos, an already-known general principle or
pattern for reasoning. This paper uses en-
thymemes and topoi as a way to model the
world-knowledge behind these judgements. In
doing so, it provides a reformalisation (in
TTR) of enthymemes and topoi as networks
rather than functions, and information state
update rules for conditionals.

1 Introduction

The content of the antecedent and consequent of
a conditional, not just their truth or falsity, makes
a difference to whether we find the conditional ac-
ceptable or not, generally rejecting those that seem
disconnected (Douven, 2008). If we are to model
conditionals in a way that reflects their acceptabil-
ity, we must include some means of making those
judgements. Enthymemes are non-logical argu-
ments which do not hold up by themselves, but
are acceptable through their relation to a topos,
an already-known general principle or pattern for
reasoning. Arguments and justifications in inter-
action tend to be underpinned by general princi-
ples and rules of thumb, rather than being truly
‘logical’. For models of dialogue to be adequate
then, these non-logical arguments need to be han-
dled – namely, as proposed by Breitholtz (2014a),
through incorporating enthymemes and topoi into
the dialogue model. Apart from the evidence from
their own acceptability conditions, which corre-
late strongly with judgements of high conditional
probability, conditional structures are also asso-
ciated with ‘that kind of thinking’, being used

as plain-language explanations of particular topoi
(e.g. “if something is a bird, then it flies” in Bre-
itholtz, 2014b), or used as materials on reasoning
in any number of experiments (e.g. Pijnacker et al.,
2009). If we are going to explicitly recognise the
use of such ‘rule’ type objects in discourse, then
conditionals are one place where they show up, at
least sometimes.

This paper has two aims. First, to propose a for-
malisation of enthymemes and topoi that is geared
towards relating them to more complex rule-based
world knowledge, including a distinction between
knowledge about causality, non-causality, and am-
biguity about causality. Second, to account for the
acceptability (or not) of conditionals by proposing
an enthymeme-like structure as associated with
if -conditionals, such that topoi can enhance their
content and are used in judging whether a given
conditional is acceptable or not. The acceptabil-
ity of conditionals is linked to perceived rela-
tionships between the antecedent and consequent
cases: with enthymemes and topoi, whose pres-
ence in the model is independently justified, we
can incorporate this non-arbitrarily into the dia-
logue state.

The rest of this section will provide some back-
ground. Section 2 is focused on enthymemes,
topoi, and specification of the alternative formal-
ism, while Section 3 uses this in a proposal of
update rules associated with conditionals. Lastly,
Section 4 provides a conclusion. This paper draws
on work on enthymemes and topoi elsewhere in
Breitholtz (2014a,b) etc., and will likewise use
Type Theory with Records (Cooper, 2012, here-
after referred to by the acronym TTR) for formal-
isation.

1.1 Enthymemes and Topoi

Enthymemes are incomplete non-logical argu-
ments that get treated as complete ones. They are



169

incomplete in that to be accepted, they must be
identified as a specific instance of a more general
pattern that is already in the agent’s resources – a
topos. Topoi encode world knowledge that comes
as a ‘rule of thumb’, such as characteristics typical
of groups, and a speaker may hold contradictory
topoi as equally valid in different scenarios, with
no clash experienced unless both are used at the
same time. Speakers make enthymemetic argu-
ments by linking what on the surface might techni-
cally be non-sequiturs, but are easily identified as
an argument using accepted principles. For exam-
ple, a speaker might say “Let’s go left here, it’s a
shortcut”. This argument invokes the assumption
that shorter routes are better, and that therefore the
left turn being a shortcut is a good reason to take it
– but they might equally say “it’s longer”, invok-
ing an assumption that a longer route is preferable.

Topoi have been proposed to be a resource
available to speakers, and consequently a means
to address non-monotonic reasoning (Breitholtz,
2014b), the treatment of non-logical rules as ex-
pressing necessity, and contradictory claims being
equally assertable, as in the route-taking example
above (Breitholtz, 2014a).

To these ends, they have been formalised in
TTR for use in dialogue (Breitholtz and Cooper,
2011), as functions from records to record types,
as in this example (Breitholtz, 2014a):

(1) a. Topos:

λr : [x : Ind
cbird : bird(x)

]([cfly : fly(r.x)])

b. Enthymeme:

λr : [x = Tweety : Ind
cbird : bird(x)

]([cfly : fly(Tweety)])

Both are of type Rec → RecType, and the fields of
the specified record types match, but fields of the
enthymeme have been restricted to specific values.
A function to a record type does not by itself in-
dicate what happens once we have access to that
type. For these functions to be useful, they are ad-
ditionally governed by a theory of action, which
will license various actions that can be performed
with the type, e.g. judging that the original situa-
tion is additionally of that type, judging that there
exists some situation of the type described, or cre-
ating something of that type (Cooper, in prep).

1.2 Conditionals
The assumption that conditionals express a propo-
sition is fundamental to most linguistic work on

the topic, both that which follows the commonly
accepted restrictor theory of conditional semantics
based on the work of Lewis (1975), Kratzer (1986)
and Heim (1982), and that which does not (e.g.
Gillies (2010)).

By conditionals being ‘propositional’, we mean
that adding an if -clause to some indicative clause
does not fundamentally change the kind of seman-
tic object it is: for indicative clause “I’m going
home”, just as the conjunction ”I’m going home
and I’m watching a film” still expresses a proposi-
tion, so does “If this doesn’t get interesting soon,
I’m going home”.

As mentioned at the beginning, the acceptabil-
ity of conditionals correlates strongly with their
conditional probability: the more likely the con-
sequent is in the antecedent-case, the more ac-
ceptable the conditional tends to be be. Stalnaker
(1970) proposed that the probability of a condi-
tional and the conditional probability of the con-
sequent on the antecedent are one and the same, in
what is usually referred to as the Equation. That
is, the overall probability P (if this doesn’t get in-
teresting then I’m going home) is the same as the
conditional probability P (I’m going home∣This
doesn’t get interesting). A subsequent proof by
Lewis (1976) found that there is no single proposi-
tion based on the antecedent and consequent such
that its probability will consistently match the con-
ditional probability. Therefore one could have a
propositional theory of conditionals, or validate
the Equation – but not both.

However, conditional probability seems so im-
portant to the meaning of conditionals that in
the view of some non-linguists, (e.g. Edgington,
1995; Bennett, 2003) conditionals should properly
be considered be probabilistic, directly expressing
the conditional probability of the consequent on
the antecedent, P(cons∣ant). Subsequent empir-
ical work overwhelmingly supports the intuition
behind the original Equation, and shows that con-
ditional probability does indeed tend to correlate
with acceptability (e.g. Evans et al., 2003; Oaks-
ford and Chater, 2003). Conditional probability
thus needs to be taken seriously, whether one be-
lieves it is the core content of a conditional or
not: indeed, figuring out how propositional the-
ories can accommodate its relationship to accept-
ability is an important issue (e.g. Douven and Ver-
brugge, 2013). Conditional probability is also not
the only factor in acceptability: it is further moder-



170

ated by whether there appears to be a connection
between antecedent and consequent (Skovgaard-
Olsen et al., 2016). To make these judgements, we
need to know about the relationships between the
antecedent and consequent states.

As a note, this paper remains technically ag-
nostic about whether the propositional or proba-
bilistic analysis is correct: your mileage may vary
on whether the update rules in Section 3 should
also add a proposition associated with if p, q to
the agent’s knowledge base, were they to be more
comprehensively specified. The underlying ac-
ceptability issue, and the potential use of topoi in
the metrics underlying those acceptability judge-
ments, means that this does not impact on the core
of the proposals here.

1.3 TTR: a brief overview
Since it will be used later, this section provides a
very brief introduction to TTR.

A central idea in TTR is the judgement of ob-
jects as being of some type. If a is judged to be of
type T , this is written as a ∶ T . Several of these
judgements, or requirements for judgements, can
be collected in structured objects as records and
record types. In a record type, fields consist of
a label and type, while fields in a record consist
of a label and a value. For a record r to be of a
record type RT, it must have fields with the labels
specified in RT, and the values in those fields in r
must be the types specified by the equivalently la-
belled fields in RT. For example, the records in (2)
and (3) are both of the record type (4), provided
that x is of type T1. The type of a field need not
be stand-alone either: it may also be constructed
from a predicate and arguments, like the field d in
(5).

(2) [a = x]

(3) ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

a = x
b = y
c = z

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

(4) [a ∶ T1]
(5)

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

a ∶ T1
d ∶ p(a)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

(6) ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

a ∶ T1
b ∶ T2

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
(7) ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

a ∶ T1
c ∶ T3

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

There also exist sub- and super-type relations
between types. One record type is a subtype of
another if it is a more specified version of it. This
means that it has at least the same fields as the su-
pertype, whose types are the same type or subtypes
of the equivalent fields in the supertype. For ex-
ample, (6) and (7) are different types, but are both
subtypes of the more general (4). A record of type

(6) is not necessarily of type (7), but will be of
type (4). Depending on whether x ∶ T1, y ∶ T2 and
z ∶ T3, the record in (3) will be of all three types.

2 Enthymemes, Topoi and Other
Knowledge

Given that their presence in an agent’s resources
has already been motivated, topoi are a natural
way to account for the required knowledge about
some ‘dependence’ between antecedent and con-
sequent. Enthymemes and topoi are snippets of
reasoning, rather than complex networks, but they
should also be related explicitly to other rule-like
world knowledge, which includes the possibility
of multiple relationships between more than two
cases, and knowledge of explicitly causal rela-
tions. If we are going to use topoi to express the
kind of knowledge that also forms such networks
(i.e. informative about causality or related proba-
bilities), then they should be in the same form as
that knowledge: the alternative, to keep rule-like
topoi apart from knowledge about rule-based(ish)
systems, is counter-intuitive.

Bayesian networks (a combination of directed
acyclic graphs and probability distributions) are
a common way to encode causal relations. They
have two components, the first of which is a di-
rected acyclic graph, with the various variables as
nodes, and directed edges describing any direct
relationships. Graphs and networks are a useful
way to describe relationships, and express a more
complex set of relationships than a linear chain of
functions. The graph structure is in accordance
with constraints about what direct parenthood in
the graph can mean – that the parent is part of the
minimal set of preceding nodes whose value de-
termines the probability distribution of the child.

The second component to a Bayesian Network
is a set of probability functions for determining the
values of variables given the values of their par-
ents – their conditional probabilities. Associated
probabilities are also a natural means of modelling
learning, by adjusting the confidence in a given
rule on the basis of evidence and experience, al-
low us to make explicit the level of confidence in
a judgement beyond a binary. For unreliable rules,
a high (but below 1) probability can be used to ex-
press that they are likely to be correct in a given
case, but not certain.

2.1 Graphical Topoi

The proposal is as follows. Topoi and enthymemes
are of the same type as any other ‘relational’
knowledge, by which I mean knowledge about
causal and correlational relations. This knowledge
can be encoded as a graph: topoi and enthymemes
as usually discussed are minimal examples, con-
taining only two nodes. The direction(s) of the
links between connected nodes, along with addi-
tional constraints, indicate either causal or non-
causal relations via directed or bi-directed links re-
spectively.

Where there is a bi-directional link somewhere
in a path between two nodes, their relationship is
confirmed as non-causal. Where there is an ab-
sence of any path between two nodes, the rela-
tionship may be treated as potential independence,
while where there are links in one direction only,
the relationship may be treated as potential causal-
ity. However, neither the potential independence
or causality is locked in: there should be a dis-
tinction between merely lacking information, and
having confirmation about an absence. Certainty
about independence or causality is expressed via
constraints explicitly preventing the creation of
any path that would violate them.

The choice of bi-directed rather than undirected
edges to express non-causality is motivated by a
desire for the difference in belief from potentially
causal to non-causal to be something that changes
easily (i.e. with the addition of information, not
replacement of one thing with another of a differ-
ent type), and for creation of a ‘casual’ (not a typo)
middle-ground, where only one direction is of rel-
evance and there is no strong commitment either
way. It can be treated as potentially causal, being
the only direction of interest, but whether this is
the whole story between the two is not specified.

All this is meant to allow for a more complex
set of relationships than expressed in your average
topos which, as stated earlier, is a minimal case
with just two nodes. The original example can be
thought of as follows, graphs with only two nodes:

(8) a. Topos:

[x : Ind
cbird : bird(x)

]1 [cfly : fly(1.x)]2
0.95

b. Enthymeme:

[x = Tweety : Ind
cbird : bird(Tweety)

]1 [cfly : fly(Tweety)]2
0.95

Once x is filled (as ‘Tweety’), this should be re-
flected in any other nodes where the same variable
appears. The confidence rating of 0.95 has been
somewhat arbitrarily set here for topoi to imply
high confidence without certainty. Generally, the
confidence rating associated with a link in a known
network should be subject to change on the ba-
sis of experience, increasing or decreasing as their
predictions are borne out or subverted. Topoi as
‘rules of thumb’ are particularly robust to contra-
dictory evidence, with the same agent in different
contexts accepting and using topoi that lead to op-
posite conclusions: see, for example, notions op-
posites attract vs. birds of a feather flock together.
Integration of ordinary learning with the potential
for entrenched ‘against all evidence’ beliefs is a
larger topic that is not addressed here, but will be
necessary in future work.

Enthymemes are distinguished from other ar-
guments by the fact they don’t hold up by them-
selves, but are instead accepted on the basis of
identification with a topos – this doesn’t include
arguments that are accepted despite being un-
supported. However, the terms enthymeme and
topos will continue to be used here: this is
partly for convenience, but also because once the
context indicates that an enthymemetic argument
is being made (such as a recognisable sugges-
tion+motivation pattern like “Let’s go left here, it’s
a shortcut”), an unsupported ‘enthymeme’, once
accepted, can be used to establish a potential new
topos (Breitholtz, 2015).

2.2 Graphical Topoi in TTR
This subsection provides a treatment in TTR of
the above proposal. The variable at each node
is a RecType, representing a situation, with the
probability of a RecType being across whether it
is true or false (for type T, whether ∃a ∶ T). Let
RecTypei be a RecType associated with an index,
and ProbInfo be a constraint on some probability.
The supertype of enthymemes and topoi, rather
than a function Rec→RecType, is the type Net-
work:

(9) Network =def
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

nodes :{RecTypei}

links :{⟨RecTypei, RecTypei⟩}

probs :{ProbInfo}
cindex : ∀⟨x′j , yp⟩, ∈ links, x′j ⊑r xi ∈ nodes, i = j,

∀⟨zq, x′′k⟩ ∈ links, x′′k ⊑r xi ∈ nodes, i = k.
clinks : ∀⟨x′i, y′p⟩ ∈ links, ∃xi, yp ∈ nodes, x′i ⊑r xi, y′p ⊑r yp

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦



172

The nodes field is the set of nodes in the graph,
while the links field is the set of directed edges
between them, each ‘link’ being an ordered pair.
Let ⊑r indicate a subtype relation where subtyp-
ing is through restriction of one or more fields i.e.
not through the specification of extra fields. The
first constraint cindex enforces co-indexing, that
if subtypes of a node are included in members
of links, they all share the same index. The sec-
ond constraint clinks specifies that any members of
links are between (potentially restricted subtypes
of) members of nodes. For ease of reading and
the sake of space, the constraints will not be re-
peated in further examples. In a link ⟨xi, xj⟩, the
specification of member xi may use j to indicate
some r ∶ xj , and vice versa, e.g. where a is some
field in xi and b is some field in xj , in xi we can
specify that a = j.b.

Causality, non-causal correlation and indepen-
dence are interpreted on the basis of the mem-
bers of links. Where a path is a sequence of in-
dices ⟨1, . . . , k⟩ such that for each i, i + 1 there
is ⟨xi, xi+1⟩ ∈ links, the node indexed i is a pre-
decessor of the node indexed j (shorthand: pre-
decessor(i, j, links)) if there is a path from i to j,
given the contents of links. In this way the set links
can be checked for evidence that two nodes are in
a non-causal relation (if there is a bi-directional
predecessor relation somewhere in a path between
the two, e.g. if ⟨xi, xj⟩, ⟨xj , xi⟩ ∈ links), are poten-
tially independent (there is no predecessor relation
at all between the two), or in a potentially causal
relation (one is a predecessor of the other, but not
the other way around). We can distinguish direct
and indirect causality by whether a minimal path
with a direct link ⟨xi, xj⟩ is possible or not. As a
rule, when we talk about causality, we will mean
direct causality.

For n ∶ Network containing nodes xi and xj , in-
dependence and causality can be expressed in up-
dated n′ as follows, where a.b indicates the merge
of two records, a record containing all fields from
both, and a . b indicates their asymmetric merge
(see Cooper and Ginzburg, 2015), where in event
of a field appearing in both records, the field from
b is the one found in the merge, effectively over-
writing the field of a.

(10) Independence of i and j:
n′ = n.

An Enth is defined as a Network containing a node
that has at least one field restricted to a specific
object, removing its generality. A Topos is a Net-
work in which no fields are restricted to a specific
object.

An enthymeme e may be identified with a topos
t if its nodes and links have equivalents in t, that
is if for every node xi ∈ e.nodes,∃yp ∈ t.nodes
such that xi ⊑ yp and for any links ⟨x′i, x′j⟩ ∈
e.links,∃⟨y′p, y′q⟩ ∈ t.links such that x′i ⊑ y′p and
x′j ⊑ y′q. This may be by a clear match for the topos
fields, but may also include the types of fields in
the enthymeme as subtypes of fields in the topos1.

3 Conditionals and Reasoning

Having reformalised topoi and enthymemes as an
object intended for more general correlational and
causal knowledge, i.e. like a Bayesian network2

we turn back to conditionals.
1as in the example “Give a coin to the porter, he carried

the bags all the way here” from (Breitholtz, 2014b), where
carrying someone else’s bags is recognised as a subtype of
work, and the enthymemetic argument is on the basis of a
topos like work should be rewarded

2though not strictly: the graph of a Bayesian network
should be acyclic, while these do allow for cycles



173

Firstly, and as mentioned at the beginning, ex-
pressing this kind of relational knowledge is (both
intuitively and according to empirical evidence)
strongly associated with conditionals, and exis-
tence of a dependence relation and high condi-
tional probability usually determine their accept-
ability. Van Rooij and Schulz (2019) suggest a
way to combine these two features into a single
measure, the relative difference the state of the
parent in a relation makes to the likelihood of
the child. Pleasingly, with some independence
assumptions this measure works not only for the
‘causal’ direction typically expressed by condi-
tionals (if there’s fire, there’s smoke), but for the
reverse as expressed by evidential conditionals (if
there’s smoke, there’s fire). However, for it to
do so, the direction of the relationship still has to
be recognised even when the ‘usual’ roles of an-
tecedent as parent and consequent as child have
flipped. This kind of structural knowledge is
topoic.

Secondly, and while it feels almost trivial to
point out, we use conditionals to tell each other
new things, e.g. the speaker explaining their expe-
riences with “if you done anything wrong well you
get, you get the cane and anything else” (BNC,
H5G 78). When we are informed of something
through the use of a conditional, we don’t nec-
essarily know beforehand that they lie in such a
relation: otherwise they would only be useful to
draw attention to connections we haven’t made,
not to tell each other things that are entirely new.
Indeed, Skovgaard-Olsen et al. (2016) found evi-
dence that when faced with a conditional, people
assume that there is a positive connection between
antecedent and consequent unless they have rea-
son to believe otherwise. It is not so much that an
acceptable conditional has to be backed up by pre-
existing knowledge about the relation between the
antecedent and consequent cases, but at the very
least it should not clash with any.

Breitholtz (2014a) mentions how an en-
thymemetic argument can be recognised on the
basis of the current conversational game/expected
rules (with the specific example of knowledge that
a suggestion may be followed by the speaker pro-
viding a motivation), or by an explicit lexical cue.
With the above in mind, I will suggest that use of
an if -conditional is one such linguistic cue.

3.1 Enthymemetic Conditionals

The overall suggestion is as follows. If -
conditionals are associated with the making of
enthymeme-like arguments. Note that I say
“enthymeme-like arguments”, not “enthymemetic
arguments”. Enthymemes depend on identifica-
tion with a previously-known topos, while condi-
tionals can be used to teach new relations, rather
than just make statements that rely on existing
knowledge to make sense. Although they are
structured like the characterisation of enthymemes
and topoi above, they are not all strictly speak-
ing ‘enthymemetic’. The content of a conditional
can be checked against the topoi in the agent’s re-
sources. Given a match with a topos, an enhanced
version can be added to the agent’s knowledge.

Even without a guiding topos, conditionals al-
low us to express or learn information via an as-
sumption that there is a positive connection be-
tween antecedent and consequent – provided we
do not already know that the two are independent,
or that the consequent shouldn’t follow from the
antecedent. If no supporting topos is found, a
more minimal version can be added without the
benefit of any extra details a topos might have pro-
vided.

The direction of antecedent as parent is ‘default’
in the sense that it should be preferred if distinct
topoi in both directions are available, and is the di-
rection assumed in case neither a supporting topos
nor a conflicting one is found. The topoi in an
agent’s resources may conflict with each other, and
by necessity one of them was learned first: despite
this, a conditional does not lead to formation of an
acceptable enthymeme when such a clashing topos
is already present. If there only exists a potential
match for the nodes in a topos that specifies there
is definitely no link, or is a conflicting link, then
the conditional should be rejected.

The processes of comparing a potential enthye-
meme with a topos and of updating structured
knowledge on the basis of a conditional can be
thought of algorithmically as follows:

(15) Match between an enthymeme and topos:
Search known topoi for topos with a node
matching the first enthymeme node
If none: no match, false.
If found: check topos for nodes matching each
further node in enthymeme.
If any failure: resume searching topoi.



174

If found: check each edge in enthymeme has
an equivalent in topos.
If any failure: resume searching topoi.
If found: check any constraints in enthymeme
have an equivalent in topos.
If found: match, true.
If any failure: resume searching topoi.

(16) Enhancing an enthymeme with a topos:
Make new copy of topos.
For each node in topos with an equivalent in
enthymeme, add any further specification.
For any node in topos with no equivalent node
in enthymeme, but with elements also found
in a node that was further specified, update ac-
cordingly.

(17) Updating with a conditional:
Check for conflicting topos.
If found, reject.
If not found, check for topos matching

The following subsections describe dialogue
state update rules associated with conditionals,
characterised in TTR.

3.2 Enthymemetic Conditionals in TTR
To begin with, the type of an information state is
minimally given as (22), broadly following the de-
cisions for the place of enthymemes and topoi in
Breitholtz (2014a) etc.

(22) InfoState =def
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

priv : [Topoi :{Topos}]

shrd :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

enths :{Enth}

Topoi :{Topos}
Moves : list(LocProp)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

(23) Update rule =def
[pre : InfoState
effects : Infostate

]

The information state has two parts: the agent’s
private resources, and their representation of the
shared context. The private resources include a set
of general topoi which they can use as resources.
A public Topoi field tracks which topoi have been
introduced onto the dialogue gameboard. The gen-
eral form for update rules is given in (23): pre de-
scribes the preconditions for states to which the
rule can be applied, and effects the changes.

Next we will add a few useful functions on the
basis of some of the content of Section 2.1: a
means to describe whether there is a successful
match between an enthymeme and a topos, and
a means to reference the result of an enthymeme
that has been enriched by the content of a topos.

(24) enthMatch(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Bool,
true iff all of the following hold

(i) All e’s nodes are subtypes of t’s nodes:
∀xi ∈ e.nodes,∃yp ∈ t.nodes
such that xi ⊑ yp,

(ii) All e’s links are subtypes of t’s links:
∀⟨x′i, x′j⟩ ∈ e.links,∃⟨y′p, y′q⟩ ∈ t.links
such that x′i ⊑ y′p and x′j ⊑ y′q,

(iii) For any constraints on links in e, the
same constraints hold for equivalent
links in t:
∀cindij ∈ e, ∃cindpq ∈ t or cindqp ∈ t,
xi ∈ e.nodes, yp ∈ t.nodes, xi ⊑ yp and
xj ∈ e.nodes, yq ∈ t.nodes, xj ⊑ yq.
Likewise for all ccauseij ∈ e, there is an
equivalent ccausepq ∈ t.

(25) enhanceEnth(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Enth,
e′ such that e′ is an asymmetric merge of t
and e,



175

where the sets in nodes, links and probs
undergo asymmetric union such that for
any nodes xi ∈ e.nodes, yp ∈ t.nodes,
xi ⊑ yp, the corresponding node zu ∈
e′.nodes = yp . xi.
Likewise for any subtypes x′i and y

′
p, x

′
i ⊑

y′p in members of e.links, t.links, e.probs
and t.probs.
That is, the asymmetric aspect of the
merge is at the level of the indexed nodes,
not the fields containing them.

The update rules for each case are given in the
subsections below. There are three rules given:
where there is a supporting topos in the ‘default’
direction, where there is not but there is a support-
ing topos in the reverse direction, and where there
is neither support nor a clash.

3.2.1 Recognising a supporting topos
First are the update rules for when the agent has
a topos linking the two parts of the conditional:
The update in case of a supporting topos in the
ant→cons direction is given in (26):

(26) default direction, ant→cons:
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

pre :
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

priv :
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

Topoi :{Topos}
t : Topos
cmember : t ∈ Topoi
cdef : enthMatch(x ∶X , t)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
shrd : [Moves[0] = Assert(if(a, b)) : LocProp]

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
effects :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

shrd :
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

enths = pre.shrd.enths

∪ enhanceEnth(x ∶X , t) :{Enth}

Topoi = pre.shrd.Topoi ∪ pre.priv.t :{Topos}

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
where X is the type
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

nodes ={a.sit-type1, b.sit-type2}: RecTypei

links ={⟨a.sit-type1, b.sit-type2⟩}: ⟨RecTypei, RecTypei⟩

probs ={P(b.sit-type2∣ r : a.sit-type1) = 0.95}: ProbInfo

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

This rule may be applied following assertion of a
conditional, where an agent knows a topos t that
matches an enthymeme based on the content of the
conditional, with a link from antecedent to con-
sequent. In this case, the agent may add such an
enthymeme enhanced with the topos to their enths,
and add the underlying topos to the set of currently
active topoi in the conversation.

Where such an option does not exist, a topos
with only a link from consequent to antecedent
can be used, as described in (27). The enthymeme
added to enths in this case will contain a link only
in the ant←cons direction.
(27) alternative direction, ant←cons:
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

pre :
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

shrd : [Moves[0] = Assert(if(a, b)) : LocProp]

priv :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

Topoi :{Topos}
t : Topos
cmember : t ∈ Topoi
cno-def : ∄t′, t′ ∈ Topoi∧ enthMatch(x ∶X , t′)
calt : enthMatch(y ∶ Y , t)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
effects :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

shrd :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

enths = pre.shrd.enths

∪ enhanceEnth(y ∶ Y , t) :{Enth}

Topoi = pre.shrd.Topoi ∪ pre.priv.t :{Topos}

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
where X is as defined in (26), and Y is the type
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

nodes ={a.sit-type1, b.sit-type2}: RecTypei

links ={⟨b.sit-type2, a.sit-type1⟩}:{⟨RecTypei,RecTypei⟩}

probs ={P(a.sit-type1∣ r : b.sit-type2) = 0.95}:{ProbInfo}

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

Relative to (26), the update rule for this case has
a constraint in its preconditions that there are no
topoi with a link in the ant→cons direction, and
the enthymeme is instead enhanced by a topos that
does support the alternative order.

3.2.2 New information
The last rule describes the case where the agent’s
known topoi have neither evidence about a link be-
tween the antecedent or consequent, the definite
absence of one, or a conflicting one. In this case,
an ‘enthymeme’ with a link in the ant→cons di-
rection may be added to enths solely on the ba-
sis of the conditional content. No additional topos
is added to the list of active topoi – the process
for generalising an acceptable enthymeme to a re-
usable topos is not addressed here.

The shorthand for presence of a clashing topos
is given in (28) as enthClash. An enthymeme
clashes with a topos where the equivalent parent
nodes lead to mutually exclusive child nodes, i.e.
child nodes where a true type cannot be formed
from their meet.

(28) enthClash(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Bool,
true iff
∃xi, yj ∈ e.nodes, pi, qj ∈ b.nodes, xi ⊑ pi,
∃⟨x′i, y′j⟩ ∈ e.links, x′i ⊑ xi, y′j ⊑ yj ,



176

∃⟨p′i, q′j⟩ ∈ t.links, p′i ⊑ pi, q′j ⊑ qj ,
and ¬T, where T = y′j . q′j

(29) neither support nor opposing knowledge:
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

pre :
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

shrd : [Moves[0] = Assert(if(a, b)) : LocProp]

priv :

⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

Topoi :{Topos}
cno-clash : ∄t, t ∈ Topoi∧ enthClash(x : X , t)
cno-def : ∄t, t ∈ Topoi∧ enthMatch(x : X , t)
cno-alt : ∄t, t ∈ Topoi∧ enthMatch(y : Y , t)
cno-ind : ∄t, t ∈ Topoi∧ enthMatch(z ∶ Z, t)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
effects : [shrd : [enths = pre.shrd.enths ∪ x ∶X]]

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
where X , Y are as in (26), (27), and Z is the type
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

nodes ={a.sit-type1, b.sit-type2}: RecTypei

links = ∅ :{⟨RecTypei,RecTypei⟩}

probs = ∅ :{ProbInfo}
cind12 : ¬predecessor(1,2, links)

∧¬predecessor(2,1, links)

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦

Relative to the previous two update rules, the
preconditions in this rule specify that there is no
known topos that supports an enthymeme with a
link between the antecedent and consequent in ei-
ther direction, which has an explicit constraint en-
forcing independence between the two, or which
otherwise clashes with the possible conditional en-
thymeme.

4 Conclusion

The acceptability of a conditional is often deter-
mined by the conditional probability of the con-
sequent on the antecedent, and recognition of
some meaningful link between the two. However,
both intuitively and according to experimental ev-
idence, positive acceptability judgements can still
be made without fore-knowledge of such a con-
nection. This paper presented two proposals on
the basis that the knowledge enabling these judge-
ments is topoic, integrating these factors into the
representation of the dialogue state and agent re-
sources. First, a formalisation of enthymemes and
topoi as graphs was presented, on the grounds that
they should be in the same form as other knowl-
edge about causal and correlational relationships.
Second, update rules for conditionals using topoi
and enthymemes were presented, drawing on topoi
to recognise the presence and direction of a ‘mean-
ingful’ connection between antecedent and conse-
quent, and making an assumption of one in the ab-
sence of any evidence.

There are several avenues for further work.
Most work focuses on declarative conditionals, the
most common form by far. However, conditional
clauses are also used to form conditionalised ques-
tions and directives. The proposals here should be
related to these forms, whether because to an ex-
tent they apply in those cases too, or because this
topoic association is exclusive to declarative con-
ditionals. This paper has also said nothing about
more standard propositional aspects of condition-
als. The proposals here about structural knowl-
edge associated with conditionals should be inte-
grated with this more standard fare.
