Following an upsurge in mobile device usage and improvements in speech recognition

performance, multiple virtual personal assistant systems have emerged, and have been widely

adopted by users. While these assistants proved to be beneficial, their usage has been limited

to certain scenarios and domains, with underlying language understanding models that have

been finely tuned by their builders.

Simultaneously, there have been several recent advancements in semantic web knowledge

graphs especially used for basic question answering, efforts for integrating statistical in-

formation on these graphs, graph-based generic semantic representations and parsers, all

providing opportunities for open domain spoken language understanding.

In this talk, I plan to summarize recent work in these areas, focusing on their connection, as

a promise for wide coverage spoken language understanding in conversational systems, while

at the same time investigating what is still lacking for natural human-machine interactions

and related challenges.
