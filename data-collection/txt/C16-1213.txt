Abstract

We have released plWordNet 3.0, a very large wordnet for Polish. In addition to what is expected
in wordnets – richly interrelated synsets – it contains sentiment and emotion annotations, a
large set of multi-word expressions, and a mapping onto WordNet 3.1. Part of the release is
enWordNet 1.0, a substantially enlarged copy of WordNet 3.1, with material added to allow for
a more complete mapping. The paper discusses the design principles of plWordNet, its content,
its statistical portrait, a comparison with similar resources, and a partial list of applications.

1 Introduction

WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), developed at Princeton University and available on an open licence since the
early 1990s, has proven useful in thousands of applications to English texts. It is not flawless, but it
strikes a most reasonable balance between the formalisation of the descriptions of lexical meaning and
the wide coverage required for practical applications. Wordnets for other languages have been built upon
the WordNet blueprint, but almost none of them come close to WordNet’s size and coverage. That limits
their influence on language technology for those languages. It is therefore unclear whether the success
of the “WordNet phenomenon” is not somehow restricted to English. It must also be noted that most
of those wordnets have been translated, one way or another, from Princeton WordNet, mainly in order
to reduce the workload and cost. This construction method does not quite take into consideration the
peculiarities of the given language’s lexical semantic systems, inasmuch as the lexical material and the
network of relations strongly depend on the solutions specific to English.

The goal of the plWordNet team was to build a wordnet which provides a faithful and comprehensive
description of the system of Polish lexical semantics. That is to say, its structure should represent
accurately the lexico-semantic relations between lexical meanings in Polish, and be motivated only by
observations derived from Polish language data. We were determined to avoid any form of translation
from wordnets for other language, and even any kind of structure transfer. That was meant to keep
our wordnet’s structure free from the idiosyncrasies of the lexical systems of other languages. We also
aimed to have a resource with good coverage with respect to lemmas, word senses and instances of
lexico-semantic relations, so that the resulting language resource could be a strong basis for practical
applications with a high chance of retrieving semantic knowledge. Finally, we assumed that our wordnet
should be developed in close correspondence to language data collected from very large corpora, so that
it could become a robust, faithful description of Polish usage.

We have been fortunate in the past 10 years to have almost continual funding at a level that allowed
us to reach our goals without compromising these fundamental assumptions. It was a rare chance to
carry out a long-term plan of building a very large wordnet without worrying too much about cost.1 The
main purpose of this paper is to present plWordNet, to square its final state with the assumptions, and
to compare it with several other lexical resources. We will also refer to hundreds of plWordNet’s known
applications and thus try and show that the effort was worth the price.

2 plWordNet in brief

2.1 The plWordNet model

Wordnets have become standard lexical-semantics resources in NLP, and have found thousands of appli-
cations. A wordnet is now considered a basic language resource, expected to be available for any language.

1There were three major releases. The development was carried out by researchers (linguists and computational
linguists), wordnet editors (supporting linguists) and programmers (developing and maintaining tools to support
linguists’ work), at the approximate cost of 40 person-years.

2259



The plWordNet project, arising from a wish to fill a gap in language technology for Polish, and clearly
inspired by WordNet, aimed to produce a faithful description of the system of Polish lexical semantics.

It must be noted that several fundamental definitions in the WordNet paradigm, e.g., those of a
synset, near synonymy or lexicalised concepts, were not clear enough to be used operationally (Fellbaum,
1998; Vossen, 2002), and to achieve good consistency among wordnet editors – see a longer discussion in
(Piasecki et al., 2009). We decided against the transfer method (Vossen, 2002), so as to avoid influencing
plWordNet’s structure with some properties alien to the Polish lexical system. We also could not adopt
the merge method, because no dictionaries or other lexical resources on open licenses were available.2
We proposed a corpus-based wordnet development process instead: a large text corpus is a primary data
source, and language tools and systems help wordnet editors explore the corpus.3

The corpus has been the main knowledge source for all phases of the development, from the systematic
extraction of lemmas for inclusion in plWordNet to the automated acquisition of lexico-semantic relations
for presentation to the editors. Dictionaries and encyclopaedias complement language competence of the
editors, all of them trained linguists, and in all linguistic matters editors have the last word. Detailed
instructions ensure a high degree of consistency of those decisions.

Corpora contain words, with senses discernible by context. Groups of synonyms are not a natural
phenomenon in texts. We decided to make the lexical unit (LU) the basic building block in plWordNet,
rather than the synset as in WordNet (Piasecki et al., 2009). We defined the LU in a rather technical
way as a triple: a lemma, its part of speech and its sense indicator. We assumed that one LU belongs
to exactly one synset. The synset, however, has been defined indirectly – and operationally – as a group
of LUs which share lexico-semantic constitutive relations and constitutive features (Maziarz et al., 2013).
Examples of the former are hyponymy, hypernymy, meronymy and holonymy; of the latter, stylistic
register, aspect, and semantic classes for adjectives and verbs. With this definition of the synset, a
relation between two synsets in plWordNet can be treated as a shorthand for the fact that LUs from the
two groups share links by certain relation, e.g., hypernymy.

Each relation has been given a clear definition meant to allow wordnet editors to make consistent
decisions. There also are linguistic substitution tests, with slots to be occupied by two LUs possibly
in this relation. The tests, which support wordnet editors’ decisions very effectively, are automatically
filled and presented in a wordnet editing system called WordnetLoom (Piasecki et al., 2013). We adhere
intentionally to the minimal commitment principle: lexico-semantic relations are grounded in the Polish
linguistic tradition and language data in very large corpora; plWordNet’s structure is derived from the
relations in a way which depends on no particular theory of meaning.

Table 1: Multilayered semantic description in plWordNet: the statistics.

The relations are the backbone of a wordnet: they jointly describe a word’s meaning; definitions and
usage example come next. plWordNet has over 40 different relation types (100 when counting subtypes).
many of them link LUs from different parts of speech. In addition to relations, plWordNet describes
meaning in several ways. Table 1 presents the statistics of these descriptions.

• Semantic domains (Princeton WordNet calls them lexicographer files) are broad lexical fields of a
given LU. They are quite general (e.g., animals, artifacts, place).
• Stylistic labels describe the lexical register of a given LU. There are 11 registers in plWordNet: non-

standard, obsolete, regional, terminological, argot/slang, literary, official, vulgar, coarse, colloquial,
general; words in some registers (e.g., vulgar and coarse) can co-exist in a synset, but normally
distinct registers mean distinct synsets. The register thus affects the network of lexical relations.

2Unrestricted availability was an essential point for us in view of what we wanted plWordNet’s licence to be.
3The corpus grew in size from the initial ≈260 million words during the work on plWordNet 1.0, through ≈1.8
billion tokens for plWordNet 2.3, to ≈4.0 billion for plWordNet 3.0.

• Glosses are short definitions, a very important element of plWordNet. They help the user to
understand the network, and plWordNet editors to work with high effectiveness.
• Usage examples are sentences which illustrate a particular lexical meaning. They are exemplars

for sense usage and also real corpus evidence. Usage examples in plWordNet are due to the liguists’
intuition, or taken from corpora in the public domain or published on a Creative Commons Licence.
• Links to Wikipedia are added to those LUs whose meaning is an exact equivalent of a Wikipedia

entry.
• Semantic verb classes, part of plWordNet’s structure, generalise the Vendler classes for typical

Polish verb usage. They influence the network’s shape, since only verbs of the same class may be
linked with hyponymy.4

• Sentiment and emotion annotation marks word meanings as discussed below.

Sentiment analysis or the construction of a sentiment lexicon, perhaps based on plWordNet, has been a
frequently stated intended use of plWordNet once it became publicly available.5 We met this expectation
in a pilot project, in which about 30,000 noun and adjective LUs were annotated with basic emotions
(Plutchik, 1980), fundamental human values and sentiment polarity, illustrated by usage examples (Zaśko-
Zielińska et al., 2015). LUs rather than synsets were annotated, because LUs from the same synset can
differ with respect to sentiment polarity.6 Annotation covers the sentiment polarity of a sense on a 5-level
scale, and basic emotions.) and LUs are the object of linguistic tests or are included in usage examples.
The annotation was performed by a group separate from the plWordNet editors, so it also served as a
form of verification of the plWordNet content.

The newest release of plWordNet, version 3.0, complements the preceding versions. After version 2.3,
the work concentrated on a modified system of relations for adjectives (Maziarz et al., 2012) and on the
expansion of the adjective sub-database; the construction of the adverb subnetwork,7 supported by a
semi-automated method based on adjective-adverb derivational relations (Maziarz et al., 2016); and a
major increase of the number of lexicalised multi-word expressions (Dziob and Wendelberger, 2016).

3 Comparative analysis

3.1 The lexical net

A wordnet is a lexical net, so it can be evaluated with statistical measures suitable for graphs (Lewis,
2009). We consider graph size, network volume, average graph density, corpus coverage, clustering
coefficient, distance measure and connectivity. A wordnet of good quality ought to have a large, dense
network, covering contemporary corpora well, and showing traits of “small-worldness”.

Network volume and density. Table 2 shows the number of synsets, lemmas and LUs in three
manually and independently constructed wordnets: Princeton WordNet, plWordNet and GermaNet,
together with enWordNet, our extension of PrincetonWordNet. We can say that plWordNet is comparable
in size to Princeton WordNet (and the 5% larger enWordNet), and almost twice as large as GermaNet.
Table 3 shows that the volumes of the two resources are also comparable. plWordNet has 208K LU relation
instances and 324K synset relation instances; the WordNet counts are 91K and 195K, respectively. Taking
into account that in WordNet the average synset size is higher than the average synset size in plWordNet
(Table 2) one may want to calculate an average relation density per LU. This measure approximates an

4For example, zgubić2 and stracić1 ‘to lose’ (HAPPPENINGS) or wybudować1 ‘buildPERF’ and zrobić2 ’doPERF’
(PERFECTIVE ACTIONS).

5An independent attempt has been made (Haniewicz et al., 2013; Haniewicz et al., 2014).
6For instance, pies2 ‘Canis lupus familiaris’ is unmarked, while pies3 ‘cop (policeman)’ is negatively marked.
7Adverbs are usually neglected in wordnet: there are none in GermaNet, and less than 3% of all lexical units
in WordNet are adverbs. Their proper relational description is not easy, as witnessed by WordNet’s low synset
relation density of 0.03 (Table 1).

WordNet and 785K for plWordNet, see row “all relation types” in the table.8

Corpus coverage. Figure 1, right, shows how well plWordNet 3.0’s vocabulary covers PLWNC.
plWordNet was developed on three corpora, the ICS PAS corpus (Przepiórkowski, 2004) (plWordNet 1.0,
250M tokens), plWordNet Corpus 7.0 (plWordNet 2.0 and 3.0, 1.8G tokens) and plWordNet Corpus 10.0
(plWordNet 3.0, 4.2G tokens). Note that the coverage of PLWNC 10.0 is lower than that of version 7.0.
The chart also proves that plWordNet creators favoured more frequent lemmas over less frequent. Figure
2, left, presents the coverage of three versions of plWordNet (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0). The consecutive versions
of plWordNet housed more and more low-frequenct lemmas. Now, words with frequencies lower than
f = 10 account for merely 10% of plWordNet 3.0 (Figure 2, right).

Small world. Similarly to Princeton WordNet, plWordNet shows a small-world behaviour: short
average path length and high clustering coefficient (Sigman and Cecchi, 2001).9 In Figure 3 we plot
the statistics for three versions of plWordNet (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), Princeton WordNet and a conglomerate,
an effect of mapping from plWordNet 3.0 to WordNet 3.1 (WN-plWN3). For a classical random graph
of plWordNet’s size, a global clustering coefficient is close to 〈k〉N = 2.5 × 10−5, where 〈k〉 is an average
number of neighbours of a vertex (see ρ values in Table 3, we put here 〈k〉 = 3), and N is the number of
graph vertices (in this case synsets, see Table 2). The average path length for the random graph is very
similar to the obtained values (see see Figure 3): ln(N)ln(〈k〉) ≈ 11 (Omidi and Masoudi-Nejad, 2009).

For sure, plWordNet is denser now in terms of the clustering coefficient and the shorter path lengths
than in the past (it is indeed a smaller world now). As compared to WordNet, plWordNet versions 2.0
and 3.0 have shorter average path length and higher clustering coefficient.
8This approximation was calculated thus: we choose synset relations within the same POS and multiply the
number of relation instances by a square of the average synset size for a particular POS (synset relations are
shorthand for relations between LUs from two synsets). If a synset relation holds between different POSs, we
multiply the number of synset relations by the average synset sizes of the two distinct POSs.

9We calculate the classic global clustering coefficient (Opsahl, 2013).

plWN2, plWN3: = plWordNet 1.0, 2.0, 3.0; PWN: WordNet 3.1, WN-plWN: mapping between plWordNet3.0
and WordNet 3.1. Clustering coefficients were calculated for the whole graphs. Average path lengths were obtained
by randomly picking a pair of 2×500 synsets (without replacement) and seeking a way through the graph between
the pairs; if a way could be found, the shortest path was chosen, and then the set of resulting calculations was
averaged. The procedure was repeated 10 times for each graph. The connectivity was calculated simultaneously:
it is a ratio of felicitously found paths.

Connectivity measures how often a path can be established between two synsets randomly chosen in a
graph. For all wordnet versions, the statistic is high (>85%) or very high (>95%), with plWordNet 1.0
last in ranking and two other versions of plWordNet with the two highest ranks.

The mapping results, described in the next section, were very surprising. The merged networks of
Polish and English lexical units gave impressive values of clustering coefficient (3 times larger than for
plWordNet 3.0) and shortest path lengths. The conglomerate has small-world behaviour more than its
separate parts. It seems that linking independently built resources creates a new quality.

3.2 Comparison by mapping

As noted, plWordNet has been developed independently fromWordNet, without any transfer of structures
between the two resources, thus avoiding any bias towards WordNet. Even so, the alignment of plWordNet
and WordNet was needed for a variety of (bilingual and multilingual) applications and research tasks. We
have designed a strategy of mapping plWordNet to WordNet (Rudnicka et al., 2012). The key element

Table 4: Interlingual relation counts

of the strategy was a comparison of the two relation structures in order to find the corresponding nodes
of synset graph structures and link them via one of eight interlingual relations (hierarchically ordered by
varying strength and specificity). The mapping was done manually, in the WordNetLoom editor (Piasecki
et al., 2013), bottom-up (leaves first), from plWordNet to WordNet. As a result, almost all plWordNet
noun synsets are mapped in version 3.0, about 34 of adjective synsets and about

1
4 of adverb synsets.

The linguists’ work was supported by an automatic prompt system which suggested interlingual links
using a rule-based part-of-speech-sensitive algorithm, and a cascade dictionary (Kędzia et al., 2013;
Rudnicka et al., 2015a). The final decisions, however, were made by linguists and the cost of the mapping
process was comparable to that of editing plWordNet. That has turned out to be money well spent, for
two reasons. The two interlinked, independently created wordnets provide a remarkable opportunity to
run a comparative analysis; and the mapping process required a careful analysis of plWordNet’s structure,
so it was a kind of evaluation procedure.

Indeed, the mapping process enabled a comparative analysis and an evaluation of the lexical coverage
and the construction methods of the two wordnets. The linguists discovered many gaps in the lexical
coverage between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet, as well as numerous differences in the number,
type and structure of synset and LU relations – all due to the different construction methods (Rudnicka
et al., 2015b). These facts account for the final mapping results, with interlingual hyponymy counts
doubling interlingual synonymy counts. This is illustrated in Table 4.

The results are striking. Interlingual synonymy was most highly favoured by the mapping procedure,
yet its counts are much lower than those of interlingual hyponymy across all mapped categories. This
is caused by the strict restrictions on the application of I-Synonymy. It could only be assigned given
strong correspondence of the meanings and relation structures between plWordNet and WordNet synsets.
Superficially, noun synset relation structures seem largely to correspond, with hyponymy forming the
backbone of a relation network. However, on a closer look, various contrasts come to the fore.

First, plWordNet and WordNet differ in synset granularity, which affects relation structures. In general,
plWordNet synsets are smaller and tend to include fewer lexical units than WordNet synsets. In plWord-
Net there are always distinct synsets for feminine, masculine and neuter forms, singular and plural, mass
and count, diminutive, augmentative and stylistically marked forms. While mapping, we found many
instances of mixed WordNet synsets grouping together marked and unmarked forms of such pairs. More-
over, the concept of hyponymy in plWordNet and in WordNet is different. plWordNet always understands
hyponymy narrowly, as “and hyponymy”: the hyponyms have to have all properties of their hypernym(s).
That leads to many cases of multiple hyponymy, but it is always of the “and” type. WordNet also allows
a more relaxed “or hyponymy”, which lets hyponyms have some properties of their hypernym(s). We
have also found places (both in plWordNet and in WordNet) where the same conceptual dependency was
encoded variously by meronymy or by hyponymy.

Adjective and adverb relation structures diverge even more between plWordNet and WordNet than
noun relations structures (Rudnicka et al., 2015a). In plWordNet, the adjective synset relation structure
is a vertical, hyponymy-based network, partly similar to that for nouns. WordNet employs a completely
different, horizontal dumbbell model, based on a rather vague “Similar to” relation. That has made
designing an adjective mapping procedure a real challenge. We had to take into account the lexical unit
relation network which displays more similarity to establish interlingual correspondence links between
plWordNet andWordNet synsets. Since adverbs have been systematically derived from adjectives, we have
also capitalised on the results of adjective mapping in designing the mapping procedure for adverbs. The
relevant interlingual adjective relation links were copied to adverbs and presented in the form of automatic
prompts to linguists. They verified them and introduced manual interlingual adverb links. That process

also allowed for critical evaluation (sometimes followed by correction) of interlingual adjective links.
Having finished their work on mapping synsets from selected wordnet graphs (usually domain-

restricted), bilingual linguists reported potential errors in plWordNet to the team responsible for the
Polish side, who analysed and, if needed, corrected them. Despite meticulous quality control, it is in-
evitable that isolated errors – typos, flawed links, synsets too general or too specific – persist in plWordNet
3.0. Such errors will be rooted out when a reporting system for users has been implemented.

The mapping went in the usual “national wordnet to WordNet” direction. We were well-aware of
substantial lexical, grammatical and cultural differences between English and Polish as well as different
development processes of the two wordnets. Even so, we did not expect differences in the mapping
coverage between the wordnets as large as those illustrated in Table 5.

The reasons for the discrepancies in the mapping coverage of nouns and adjectives have been already
discussed. The mapping of adverbs has only started, while verbs have not been mapped yet.

In short, the results of mapping have shown large differences between plWordNet andWordNet in lexical
content, coverage and relation structure. Differences in lexical content are due to lexico-grammatical
differences between English and Polish and the existence of many lexical and cultural gaps between
the two languages. Differences in lexical coverage are due to different construction methods of the two
wordnets: merge method for WordNet and corpus-based method for plWordNet, as well as in the time
span of their construction: mid 1990-ties to 2006 for WordNet 3.0 and 2005-2016 for plWordNet 3.0.

The differences in relation structure are due to different theoretical solutions assumed in the con-
struction of two wordnets: lower vs higher synset granularity, "and" vs "or" hyponymy, and the use of
hyponymy and meronymy to code the same conceptual distinctions. The effects of those differences are
the prevalence of I-hyponymy over I-synonymy and the large part of WordNet not mapped yet, due to
one-directional, plWordNet to WordNet mapping direction.

An I-hyponymy-based bilingual resource is clearly less valuable than one based on I-synonymy (due
to the lower specificity of links). So, we have sought remedies. One idea was to exploit the existing
I-hyponymy links to extend WordNet’s coverage. The result was the construction of enWordNet 1.0, an
extended version of WordNet. The lemmas of plWordNet leaf synsets linked by I-hyponymy to WordNet
synsets were automatically translated by a large cascade dictionary. The obtained list of translations
was then filtered by WordNet lemmas. Next, the results of this filtering were divided into lemmas for
which the cascade dictionary found: (1) equivalents whose lemmas were not present in WordNet; (2) no
equivalents; (3) equivalents whose lemmas were already present in WordNet.

Linguists started with the first group, carefully verifying the suggestions with corpora and all available
resources; then they moved to the second group, trying to find equivalents on their own (in all available
resources); lastly, they investigated the third group, verifying the existing mapping relations. Moreover,
whenever linguists started work with a particular WordNet “nest”, they were encouraged to look for
its possible extensions on their own (not limiting themselves to cascade dictionary suggestions). The
effect of that work is a substantially enlarged version of WordNet, with lexical material – some 10,000
lemmas – added in many places where a link from the Polish side would have been inaccurate. The
result, enWordNet 1.0,10 is also part of this release, which ought to encourage comparative studies and
cross-lingual research.

4 Applications of plWordNet

Language resources are developed for applications: the higher the uptake, the better the perceived
quality. plWordNet is a pivotal element of a system of language and knowledge resources; plWordNet’s
wide coverage helps a lot. The system has several layers, with plWordNet in the middle:

• top- and medium-level ontology SUMO with plWordNet semi-automatically mapped onto it (Kędzia
and Piasecki, 2014),

• NELexion2, a very large lexicon of Polish Proper Names (PNs), ≈1.5 million, manually linked at the
level of fine-grained semantic PN classes (Marcińczuk, 2016),
• a lexicon of≈60,000 multiword expressions with syntactic structures described, linked to plWordNet’s

LUs by lemmas (Maziarz et al., 2015; Dziob et al., 2016),
• a syntactic-semantic lexicon of Polish valency frames (≈15,000 lemmas described) linked to plWord-

Net at the LU level and semantic restrictions of frame arguments (Kotsyba, 2014; Hajnicz, 2014).

The system is a very large network, linking knowledge elements to lexical meaning and descriptions
of local syntactic-semantic structures. Given the mapping to WordNet, the system can be an anchor to
a global Linked Data network,11 a powerful cloud of heterogenous data webs. Manually crafted lexical-
semantic resources could serve as a skeleton for the cloud, notably with plWordNet’s comprehensive
coverage. Lexical item descriptions therein would be the means of anchoring webs to text clouds.

plWordNet has become an important reference for research on the development of wordnets; (Fišer and
Sagot, 2015) is the latest of numerous citations.

plWordNet’s open license enables frequent use as a monolingual and bilingual dictionary: Web-based
(http://plwordnet.pwr.edu.pl) via an Android application, and via WordnetLoom (Piasecki et al.,
2013) (http://ws.clarin-pl.eu/public/WordnetLoom-Viewer.zip) a wordnet editor which offers ad-
vanced visual, graph-based browsing. plWordNet has also been included in a very large and popular
Polish multilingual dictionary Lingo (http://ling.pl). Access to plWordNet as a dictionary amounts
to tens of thousand of visits a month.

In addition to monolingual resources, plWordNet is part of multilingual resources, e.g., WordTies
(Pedersen et al., 2012), Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster, 2013) and multimodal resources,
e.g., the classification of gestures based on the verb categorisation in plWordNet (Lis and Navarretta,
2014). plWordNet was referred to in the resource for textual entailment (Przepiórkowski, 2015) and
utilised for ontology mapping and linking ontology to lexicon (Jastrząb et al., 2016).

Assorted applications of plWordNet include language correction, relation extraction (Mykowiecka and
Marciniak, 2014), text indexing (Kaleta, 2014), Text Mining (Maciołek and Dobrowolski, 2013), text
classification (Wróbel et al., 2016; Mirończuk and Protasiewicz, 2016), Open Domain Question Answering
(Przybyła, 2013), and use as a quasi-ontology in document structure recognition (Kamola et al., 2015).

Registered users of plWordNet declare its applications. Here is a selection of such declaration: education
(at different levels) including Polish language teaching, building dictionaries, extraction of synonyms and
semantically related words, detection of loanwords, cross-linguistic study on phonesthemes, classification
of metaphorical expressions, corpus studies, grammar development, comparative and contrastive studies,
language recognition, parsing disambiguation, semantic analysis of text, document similarity measures,
semantic indexing of documents, semantic information retrieval, recommendation systems, construction of
chatbots and dialogue systems, plagiarism detection, translation evaluation, data visualisation, research
on complex networks and ontologies. An exceptional case is the practical use of plWordNet during the
medical treatment of aphasia.

5 Always more to do
The release of plWordNet 3.0 is a caesura, but language resources never really reach a stable state.
The wordnet is an NLP-friendly description of the Polish lexical system on a scale unheard of even in
previously published large unilingual dictionaries.

And yet, each element of the system could stand improvement. For example, while many derivational
relations (typical of strongly inflected languages such as Polish) have been introduced, there remains
a motherlode of relations signalled by verbal prefixes, a highly productive operation similar to what
phrasal verbs contribute to English. Relation density in plWordNet is quite satisfactory, but there can be
semi-automatic methods of improving it further. Stylistic registers as a constitutive feature can lead the
the natural introduction of sub-databases of specialised vocabulary for a variety of domains, interlinked
across registers. Multi-word expressions and proper names need more work. Emotion annotations have
to be extended onto the whole network.

Last but not least, user feedback in matters small (typos, omissions) and large (new functionalities,
support for new kinds of applications) ought to be implemented.
