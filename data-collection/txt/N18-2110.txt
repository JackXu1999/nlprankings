Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible
and progressive brain disease that can be
stopped or slowed down with medical treat-
ment. Language changes serve as a sign that
a patient’s cognitive functions have been im-
pacted, potentially leading to early diagno-
sis. In this work, we use NLP techniques to
classify and analyze the linguistic characteris-
tics of AD patients using the DementiaBank
dataset. We apply three neural models based
on CNNs, LSTM-RNNs, and their combina-
tion, to distinguish between language samples
from AD and control patients. We achieve
a new independent benchmark accuracy for
the AD classification task. More importantly,
we next interpret what these neural models
have learned about the linguistic characteris-
tics of AD patients, via analysis based on acti-
vation clustering and first-derivative saliency
techniques. We then perform novel auto-
matic pattern discovery inside activation clus-
ters, and consolidate AD patients’ distinctive
grammar patterns. Additionally, we show that
first derivative saliency can not only rediscover
previous language patterns of AD patients, but
also shed light on the limitations of neural
models. Lastly, we also include analysis of
gender-separated AD data.

1 Introduction

Alzheimer’s dementia is the most common form
of dementia, caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
AD cannot be cured or reversed (Glenner, 1990).
However, medication can be used to slow or halt
degeneration especially when detected at an early
stage. Current diagnoses often involve lengthy
medical evaluations. One of the early symp-
toms of AD, cognitive impairment—which can
be evidenced by issues with word-finding, im-
paired reasoning or judgment, and changes in lan-
guage (McKhann et al., 1984)—is motivating lin-

guists and computer scientists to help quickly di-
agnose people afflicted by this disease.

This task is challenging because it requires di-
verse linguistic and world knowledge. For exam-
ple, the sentence “Well...there’s a mother stand-
ing there uh uh washing the dishes and the sink
is overspilling...overflowing” is AD-positive. To
distinguish this from a control sample, one needs
to know that the word “overspill” is not com-
mon in American English (Davies, 2009), and
the speaker is correcting themselves by saying
“overspilling...overflowing”, which hints on signs
of confusion and memory loss (Duke et al.,
2002). Moreover, different grammar patterns
emerge based on the scenario at hand. In ad-
dition, the characteristics of AD-affected speech
vary between stages of disease progression (König
et al., 2015), making it harder for feature-based ap-
proaches to adapt.

Motivated by the shortcomings of manual
feature-engineering for such a diverse and com-
plex task, we first present three end-to-end neu-
ral models to address it. The first two are the
widely adopted CNN and LSTM-RNN models,
and the third is a stronger joint CNN-LSTM ar-
chitecture. Our best-performing model requires
only minimal feature engineering (namely auto-
matic, commonly-used POS tags that are already
present in the dataset) and establishes a new inde-
pendent benchmark that outperforms previous AD
classification scores.

More importantly, we next present interpreta-
tion results to explain what AD-relevant linguis-
tic features these neural models are learning, via
two visualization techniques: Activation Cluster-
ing (Girshick et al., 2014) and First Derivative
Saliency (Simonyan et al., 2013), plus our novel
approach of automatically discovering grammati-
cal patterns common in different activation clus-
ters. Furthermore, we split our dataset by gen-

der and analyze the performance of our model on
each subsample of the data to illustrate that the
features we find are not gender-specific. These
methods not only help rediscover AD linguistic
features that have been found by previous works—
including short answers, bursts of speech, re-
peated requests for clarification, and starting with
interjections—but also lead to new insights in AD
characteristics via our automatic speech pattern
extraction method. These findings could poten-
tially help improve the accuracy and speed of med-
ical diagnoses.

2 Related Works

Language-based Alzheimer’s Detection: Previ-
ous works using language to detect AD relied
mainly on hand-crafted features from transcripts
(Orimaye et al., 2017, 2015), occasionally us-
ing acoustic data (König et al., 2015; Rudzicz
et al., 2014). The challenge with feature-based
approaches is that they rely heavily on the re-
searchers’ linguistics and medical expertise, and
are also hard to generalize to other progression
stages and disease types, which may correspond
to different linguistic features. Hand-picked fea-
tures may also become outdated as language and
culture evolves. Moreover, some features may be
too nuanced for humans to detect, especially at
early stages of AD. In order to address these is-
sues, Orimaye et al. (2016) adopted a deep neu-
ral network language model. However, a neural
approach is usually a black-box and it is hard to
interpret its reasoning for the final classification
decisions. To make our approaches more inter-
pretable while harvesting the benefits of neural ap-
proaches, we present three accurate neural models
and include multiple visualization techniques to il-
lustrate both their effectiveness and limitations.
CNN-LSTM on NL Classification: CNN and
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) have
both been leveraged extensively for extracting fea-
tures in natural language. Our best performing
model CNN-LSTM is closely related to C-LSTM
by Zhou et al. (2015), where an LSTM is laid on

top of a CNN model. This model has been shown
to perform better at sentiment classification than
either of its integral parts alone.
Visualization Techniques for Neural Models:
There have been various visualization techniques
proposed for neural networks in both Computer
Vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan et al.,
2013; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014; Samek et al., 2017;
Mahendran and Vedaldi, 2015) and NLP (Li et al.,
2015; Kádár et al., 2017). In this work, we adopt
two visualization techniques: Activation Clus-
tering (Girshick et al., 2014) following the po-
liteness interpretation work of Aubakirova and
Bansal (2016), which leads to insight on sentence-
level patterns, and First Derivative Saliency (Si-
monyan et al., 2013) following Li et al. (2015) and
Aubakirova and Bansal (2016), which provides in-
sight to the importance of each word in deciding
the final classification label.

3 Classification Models

CNN: For each sentence, we apply an embed-
ding and a convolutional layer, followed by a max-
pooling layer (Collobert et al., 2011). The convo-
lution features are obtained by applying filters of
varying window sizes to each window of words.
The result is then passed to a softmax layer that
outputs probabilities over two classes.
LSTM-RNN: CNNs are not specialized for cap-
turing long-range sequential correlations (Pascanu
et al., 2013a). We thus also experimented with an
LSTM-RNN model, which consists of an embed-
ding layer followed by an LSTM layer. The final
state, containing information from the entire sen-
tence, is fed to a fully-connected layer followed by
a softmax layer to obtain the output probabilities.
CNN-LSTM: Observing that both models achieve
results comparable to previous best performing ap-
proach, and considering that they each have their
own complementary strengths, we experimented
with a combined architecture, laying an LSTM
layer on top of CNN (See Figure 1). This CNN
layer is identical to the vanilla CNN before the
max-pooling layer, and the LSTM layer is identi-
cal to the vanilla LSTM-RNN after the embedding
layer. More details are provided in the appendix.

Dataset This study utilizes Dementia-
Bank (Boller and Becker, 2005), the largest
publicly available dataset of transcripts and

audio recordings of AD (and control) patient
interviews.1 Patients were asked to perform
various tasks; for example, in the “Boston Cookie
Theft” description task, patients were shown an
image and asked to describe what they see (See
Figure 2). Other tasks include the ‘Recall Test’
in which patients were asked to recall attributes
of a story they had been told previously. Each
transcript in DementiaBank comes with auto-
matic morphosyntactic analysis, such as standard
part-of-speech tagging, description of tense, and
repetition markers.2 Note that these features
are generic, automatically-extracted linguistic
properties and are not AD-specific. We broke each
transcript into individual utterances to use as data
samples. Note that we also removed utterances
that did not have accompanying POS tags. This
balancing reduced the amount of data but ensured
fair comparison between models with tagged and
untagged setups.

Training Details Our CNN model was a 2-D
convolutional neural network. Filter sizes of [3,
4, 5] were used. Our LSTM-RNN had 2 layers.
The CNN-LSTM model had filter sizes [3, 4, 5,
6] and 1 LSTM hidden layer. For each model, all
hyperparameters were tuned using the dev set.

See appendix for dataset and training details.

5 Results

With untagged data, our CNN, LSTM and CNN-
LSTM models achieved an accuracy of 82.8%,
83.7% and 84.9%, respectively. When fed with
the given POS-tagged data, our best-performing
CNN-LSTM model achieved 91.1% in accuracy,
setting a new benchmark accuracy for this task

Model Details Accuracy

LSTM Non-Tagged Utterances 83.7
CNN-RNN Non-Tagged Utterances 84.9
CNN-RNN POS-tagged Utterances 91.1

Table 1: Accuracy results of models. Note that we
downsampled the data to remove utterances that did not
have accompanying POS tags, so as to allow fair com-
parison between the tagged and untagged models.

(see Table 1 for more details).3 Compared to other
related works, Orimaye et al. (2015, 2017) used
AUC instead of accuracy, and König et al. (2015)
did not use DementiaBank data. Rudzicz et al.
(2014) achieved an accuracy of 67.0% on the De-
mentiaBank dataset using audio features as well
as transcripts. Orimaye et al. (2016) achieved an
accuracy of 87.5% but only used 36 transcripts.
Their test set is thus different from ours, lead-
ing to very little data and high variance. To the
best of our knowledge, Orimaye et al. (2016) used
the original transcripts, which include POS tags.
Hence, most previous works on this topic are not
directly comparable to our work, but we aim to
establish a new independent, strong neural bench-
mark and then more importantly focus on visual-
ization and interpretability of neural models.

Based on error analysis of the POS-based
CNN/RNN model’s classification result, we found
that almost all AD-positive results are classified
correctly as AD-positive. However, there is more
error in classifying non-AD samples, which could
be due to the fact that DementiaBank includes pa-
tients with probable and possible AD, each ex-
hibiting various degrees of symptoms. Patients
who are AD-positive may still have partially un-
affected speech (similar to non-AD control pa-
tients’ speech). However, because all utterances
from AD-positive interviews are tagged as AD-
positive, these seemingly unaffected utterances are
still tagged AD-positive. To further understand the
errors of our model, 10% of the wrongly classified
non-AD examples were randomly selected and an-
alyzed. Of this smaller sample, 36.3% were short
utterances such as “okay”, “alright”, “oh my”,
etc. These forms of speech are utterances that are
present in both classes, but more commonly found
in AD-positive cases. The remaining 63.7% were
examples of speech that could be classified either
way without surrounding context, such as “she’s

3We also tried using a bidirectional RNN, which gave
84.7%, 86.2% and 91.1% accuracies for our LSTM-RNN,
CNN-RNN, and CNN-RNN-tagged models, respectively.

future work could incorporate context from sur-
rounding samples in each interview to help distin-
guish between temporarily unaffected speech pat-
terns in AD-positive patients and the continually
unaffected speech of non-AD control patients.

6 Analysis and Visualization

We first present gender analysis of our results
and then present interpretation of the linguistic
cues our CNN-LSTM model identified via two vi-
sualization strategies: activation clustering (Gir-
shick et al., 2014) and first-derivative saliency heat
maps (Simonyan et al., 2013).

6.1 Gender Differences

Many previous works have debated on the differ-
ence in language for male versus female patients
with Alzheimer’s (Bayles et al., 1999; McPher-
son et al., 1999; Buckwalter et al., 1996; Ripich
et al., 1995; Hebert et al., 2000; Heun and Kock-
ler, 2002). In agreement with some of these pre-
vious works, we found that the sets of the top ten
most common POS-tags for both AD-positive men
and women are the same, i.e., we did not detect a
significant difference in the language complexity
or syntax of male and female patients with AD in
our dataset. Moreover, our best performing model
achieved 86.6% classification accuracy on solely
the male data and 86.2% accuracy on solely the
female data, demonstrating that it found no sta-
tistically significant difference between the AD-
positive language of men versus women.4

6.2 Activation Clusters

Activation clustering (Girshick et al., 2014) treats
the activation values of n neurons per input as
coordinates in an n-dimensional space. K-means
clustering is then performed to group together in-
puts that maximally activate similar neurons.

4Statistical insignificance calculated using the bootstrap
test (Noreen, 1989; Efron and Tibshirani, 1994). We split our
dataset based on gender and down-sampled the female data
subset such that it had the same data-size and non-AD to AD
data-ratio as the male data subset.

POS Frequency POS Frequency

n 0.20 n 0.15
det 0.14 det 0.13
adj 0.05 presp 0.07
adv 0.04 part 0.05

Table 3: Top POS tags in AD cluster and non-AD
cluster for Cookie task.

6.2.1 Rediscovering Existing Strategies
Our activation clusters corroborated previous stud-
ies, forming clusters around known linguistic
characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (Watson,
1999; Rudzicz et al., 2014).
Short Answers and Bursts of Speech Clusters
formed around short answers, which have been
split up by natural pauses in speech. {‘okay’,
‘and’, ‘yes’, ‘oh !’, ‘yes’, ‘fine’}
Repeated Requests for Clarification Another
cluster formed around clarification questions and
confusion about the task, specifically in the past
tense. {‘Did I say facts ?’, ‘Did I get any ?’, ‘Did
I say elephant ?’}
Starting with Interjections Many clusters con-
tain utterances that start with interjections such as
“oh”, “well”, “so”, and “right”. {‘Well I gotta see
it’, ‘Oh I just see a lot of uh...’, ‘So all the words
that you can...’}
6.2.2 Automatic Cluster Pattern Analysis
Next, we extend activation clustering to perform
novel automatic pattern discovery inside different
clusters, as opposed to manually looking for pat-
terns as in Aubakirova and Bansal (2016). Finding
the most common POS tags in each cluster allows
us to better understand which grammatical struc-
tures are favored. No two clusters had exactly the
same most-common POS tags, but many clusters
shared similar top POS-tags on the same task.

Control Clusters An example unaffected
speech cluster for the Cookie task has the fol-
lowing as the most common POS tags: [(‘n’,
.15), (‘det’, .13), (‘presp’, .07), (‘part’, .05)].5

This pattern follows other clusters of unaffected
speech, with nouns, determiners, and participles
always found in the most-used POS tags. To
illustrate this, two other control clusters found
for the Cookie task have very similar top POS
tags and frequencies: [(‘n’, .13), (‘det’, .13),

5POS tags used in this paper: v=verb, n=noun,
pro=pronoun, adv=adverb, det=determiner, aux=auxiliary
verb, prep=preposition, co=interjection, part=participle,
presp=present participle. The frequencies of each POS tag
are scaled based on the total number of tags in each cluster.

(‘part’, .09), (‘presp’, .09)] and [(‘n’, .15), (‘det’,
.13), (‘part’, .10), (‘presp’, .10)] (see Table 2 for
side-by-side comparison of these clusters). For
the same task, non-AD clusters contain the same
top four POS tags.

AD Clusters For the Recall task, one cluster of
AD patients’ speech shows that the most common
POS tags are [(‘n’, .15), (‘co’, .15), (‘v’, .06),
(‘pro’, .06)]. Across samples from the Recall task,
AD-marked clusters contained frequent interjec-
tions and verbs. On the other hand, in regards to
the Cookie task, the most common POS tags for
the AD cluster found are [(‘n’, .20), (‘det’, .14),
(‘adj’, .05), (‘adv’, .04)], i.e., more adjectives and
adverbs. Hence, between different tasks such as
Cookie and Recall, the most commonly used POS
tags for AD clusters are distinct.

Moreover, qualitative analysis shows dissimi-
larities in the most common POS tags between the
Cookie task’s AD and non-AD cluster(s). Table 3
shows the comparison between representative AD
and non-AD clusters for the Cookie task. The AD-
positive cluster has only 2 most-used POS tags in
common with the non-AD cluster. In fact, none of
the 3 non-AD clusters found in Table 2 have adjec-
tives or adverbs in their most-used POS tags list,
unlike the AD cluster in Table 3.

6.3 First Derivative Saliency Heat Maps

Saliency heat maps (Simonyan et al., 2013) illus-
trate which words in an input had the biggest im-
pact on the classification of the whole sentence.
This is done by taking the gradient of the final
scores w.r.t. the word embeddings of the inputs.

Heat Map Analysis The filler words “uh” and
“um” are emphasized in Figure 3 (left), show-
ing that they have a lot of influence on classifi-
cation. The initial “and” is highlighted as well,
corroborating the results of the activation clusters
in that starting with a coordinating conjunction is a
trait of Alzheimer’s speech. However, in Figure 3
(middle), the “uh” filler word is not highlighted,
showing that most control patients do not use filler

words as heavily as Alzheimer’s patients. Instead,
words that give structure to a sentence have the
biggest impact on classification, such as definite
articles and determiners (e.g., “the” and “that”).
Figure 3 (middle) shows that the most highlighted
words are “the”, “that” and “is”.

Visualizing Limitations Furthermore, by visu-
alizing an incorrectly classified example, we can
learn about the limitations of our neural network.
Figure 3 (right) illustrates a map of an incorrectly
predicted sample. The model misclassified it due
to the length of the utterance (activation clustering
showed that AD patients tend to have short bursts
of speech, see Section 6.2.1) and the heavy use
of determiners. However, the repeated “um”s and
starting with a coordinating conjunction strongly
indicated AD, which confused our model. From
Figure 3, the repeated use of filler words (i.e.
“uh”) had the second most influence on classifi-
cation. In future work, with more context data and
advanced neural methods, our model’s next steps
will be to learn how to better classify samples that
strongly exhibit both AD and control features.

7 Conclusion
We applied three models to the AD classification
task, and our CNN-LSTM model achieves a new
benchmark accuracy in classifying AD using neu-
ral models. We illustrate with two visualization
techniques how these models capture unique lin-
guistic features present in AD patients. We also
discussed gender analysis. Potential future work
includes using more conversational context and
implementing multi-class classification to differ-
entiate among stages of AD. We also plan to apply
this generalizable model to other similar neurolog-
ical diseases, such as Diffuse Lewy Body disease
and Huntington’s disease (Heindel et al., 1989).

A Supplementary Materials

A.1 Training Details
All models had a vocabulary size of 2396, and
used an Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014)
with a learning rate of 1e−4. All gradient norms
were clipped to 2.0 (Pascanu et al., 2013b; Graves,
2013). For each model, the hyperparameters were
tuned using the development set.

CNN We used a 2-D CNN. Filter sizes of [3, 4,
5] were used with 128 filters per filter size. Batch
size was set to 128, and a dropout (Srivastava et al.,
2014) of 0.80 was applied.

LSTM Our LSTM had 2 layers with 128 hidden
units. Batch size was 32, and a dropout of 0.70
was used.

CNN-LSTM Our CNN-LSTM model consisted
of an LSTM on top of a CNN. The CNN had 100
filters per filter size of [3, 4, 5, 6]. Embedding
dimensions of 300 were used. An LSTM with
300 hidden units was used. Both dropout on the
CNN and recurrent dropout (Gal and Ghahramani,
2016) on the LSTM used a dropout rate of 0.65.

A.2 Dataset Details
Each transcript in DementiaBank comes with au-
tomatic morphosyntactic analysis, such as stan-
dard part-of-speech tagging, description of tense,
and markers for repetitions. This automatic tag-
ging is identical to that done on other datasets,
such as the CHILDES TalkBank, and is thus not
specific to DementiaBank. This dataset features
transcripts of 104 different control patients, and
208 different diagnosed dementia patients. There
is a total of 1017 Alzheimer’s transcripts and
243 control transcripts. Each of these transcripts
were then broken down by sentences and inter-
ruptions by the interviewer. We used each ut-
terance by the patient as a data sample. Within
the 14362 utterance samples, 11458 come from
transcripts of Alzheimer’s-diagnosed interviewees
and 2904 from those of control patients. There-
fore, a majority-baseline classifier that always
guesses AD-positive will achieve an accuracy of
79.8% in our dataset. Each utterance has a POS-
tagged counterpart in the dataset. A 80/10/10
train/dev/test split was used for each setting.
