Abstract

We introduce the Hierarchical Ideal Point
Topic Model, which provides a rich picture
of policy issues, framing, and voting behav-
ior using a joint model of votes, bill text,
and the language that legislators use when
debating bills. We use this model to look at
the relationship between Tea Party Repub-
licans and “establishment” Republicans in
the U.S. House of Representatives during
the 112th Congress.

1 Capturing Political Polarization
Ideal-point models are one of the most widely

used tools in contemporary political science re-
search (Poole and Rosenthal, 2007). These models
estimate political preferences for legislators, known
as their ideal points, from binary data such as leg-
islative votes. Popular formulations analyze legis-
lators’ votes and place them on a one-dimensional
scale, most often interpreted as an ideological spec-
trum from liberal to conservative.

Moving beyond a single dimension is attractive,
however, since people may lean differently based
on policy issues; for example, the conservative
movement in the U.S. includes fiscal conservatives
who are relatively liberal on social issues, and vice
versa. In multi-dimensional ideal point models,
therefore, the ideal point of each legislator is no
longer characterized by a single number, but by a
multi-dimensional vector. With that move comes a
new challenge, though: the additional dimensions
are often difficult to interpret. To mitigate this
problem, recent research has introduced methods
that estimate multi-dimensional ideal points using
both voting data and the texts of the bills being
voted on, e.g., using topic models and associating
each dimension of the ideal point space with a topic.
The words most strongly associated with the topic
can sometimes provide a readable description of its
corresponding dimension.

In this paper, we develop this idea further by
introducing HIPTM, the Hierarchical Ideal Point
Topic Model, to estimate multi-dimensional ideal
points for legislators in the U.S. Congress. HIPTM
differs from previous models in three ways. First,
HIPTM uses not only votes and associated bill text,
but also the language of the legislators themselves;
this allows predictions of ideal points from politi-
cians’ writing alone. Second, HIPTM improves
the interpretability of ideal-point dimensions by
incorporating data from the Congressional Bills
Project (Adler and Wilkerson, 2015), in which bills
are labeled with major topics from the Policy Agen-
das Project Topic Codebook.1 And third, HIPTM
discovers a hierarchy of topics, allowing us to ana-
lyze both agenda issues and issue-specific frames
that legislators use on the congressional floor, fol-
lowing Nguyen et al. (2013) in modeling framing
as second-level agenda setting (McCombs, 2005).

Using this new model, we focus on Republican
legislators during the 112th U.S. Congress, from
January 2011 until January 2013. This is a par-
ticularly interesting session of Congress for politi-
cal scientists, because of the rise of the Tea Party,
a decentralized political movement with populist,
libertarian, and conservative elements. Although
united with “establishment” Republicans against
Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, lead-
ing to massive Democratic defeats, the Tea Party
was—and still is—wrestling with establishment
Republicans for control of the Republican party.

The Tea Party is a new and complex phe-
nomenon for political scientists; as Carmines and
D’Amico (2015) observe: “Conventional views of
ideology as a single-dimensional, left-right spec-
trum experience great difficulty in understanding
or explaining the Tea Party.” Our model identifies
legislators who have low (or high) levels of “Tea
Partiness” but are (or are not) members of the Tea
Party Caucus, and providing insights into the na-

ture of polarization within the Republican party.
HIPTM also makes it possible to investigate a num-
ber of questions of interest to political scientists.
For example, are there Republicans who identify
themselves as members of the Tea Party, but whose
votes and language betray a lack of enthusiasm for
Tea Party issues? How well can we predict from
someone’s language alone whether they are likely
to associate themselves with the Tea Party? Our
computational modeling approach to “Tea Parti-
ness”, distinct from self-declared Tea Party Caucus
membership, may have particular value in under-
standing Republican party politics going forward
because, despite the continued influence of the Tea
Party, the official Tea Party Caucus in the House
of Representatives is largely inactive and its future
uncertain (Fuller, 2015).

2 Polarization across Dimensions
Ideal point models describe probabilistic rela-

tionships between observed responses (votes) on
a set of items (bills) by a set of responders (legis-
lators) who are characterized by continuous latent
traits (Fox, 2010). A popular formulation posits an
ideal point ua for each lawmaker a, a polarity xb,
and popularity yb for each bill b, all being values
in (−∞,+∞) (Martin and Quinn, 2002; Bafumi
et al., 2005; Gerrish and Blei, 2011). Lawmaker a
votes “Yes” on bill b with probability

p(va,b = Yes |ua, xb, yb) = Φ(uaxb + yb) (1)
where Φ(α) = exp(α)/(1 + exp(α)) is the logis-
tic (or inverse-logit) function.2 Intuitively, most
lawmakers vote “Yes” on bills with high popularity
yb and “No” on bills with low yb. When a bill’s
popularity is lower, the outcome of the vote va,b
depends more on the interaction between the law-
maker’s ideal point ua and the bill’s polarity xb.

Multi-dimensional ideal point models replace
scalars ua and xb with K-dimensional vectors ua
and xb (Heckman and Jr., 1997; Jackman, 2001;
Clinton et al., 2004). Unfortunately, as Lauderdale
and Clark (2014) observe, the binary data used for
these models are “insufficiently informative to sup-
port analyses beyond one or two dimensions”, and
the additional dimensions are difficult to interpret.
To address this lack of interpretability, recent work
has proposed multi-dimensional ideal point models
to jointly capture both binary votes and the associ-

the cumulative distribution function of a Gaussian distribu-
tion (Martin and Quinn, 2002).

3 Hierarchical Ideal Point Topic Model
Bringing topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2009)

into ideal-point modeling provides an interpretable,
text-based foundation for political scientists to un-
derstand why the models make the predictions they
do. However, both the topic—what is discussed—
and the framing—how it is discussed—also reveal
political preferences. We therefore introduce frame-
specific ideal points, using a hierarchy of topics to
model issues and their issue-specific frames. Al-
though the definition of “frame” is itself a moving
target in political science (Entman, 1993), we adopt
the theoretically motivated but pragmatic approach
of Nguyen et al. (2013): just as agenda-issues map
naturally to topics in probabilistic topic models
(e.g., Grimmer (2010)), the frames as second-level
agenda-setting (McCombs, 2005) map to second-
level topics in a hierarchical topic model.

Our model’s inputs are votes {va,b}, each the
response of legislator a ∈ [1, A] to bill b ∈ [1, B].
Two types of text supplement the votes: floor
speeches (documents) {wd} from legislator ad, and
the text w′b of bill b. While congressional debates
are typically about one piece of legislation, we
make no assumptions about the mapping between
wd and w′b. In principle this allows wd to be any
text by legislator ad (e.g., not just floor speeches
about this bill, but blogs, social media, press re-
leases) and—unlike Gerrish and Blei (2011)—this
permits us to make predictions about individuals
even without vote data for them. Figure 1 shows
the plate notation diagram of HIPTM, which has the
following generative process:

1. For each issue k ∈ [1,K]
(a) Draw k’s associated topic φk ∼ Dir(β, φ?k)
(b) Draw issue-specific distribution over frames

ψk ∼ GEM(λ0)
(c) For each frame j ∈ [1,∞) (specific to issue k)

i. Draw j’s associated topic φk,j ∼ Dir(β, φk)
ii. Draw j’s regression weight ηk,j ∼ N (0, γ)

2. For each document d ∈ [1, D] by legislator ad
(a) Draw topic (i.e., issue) distribution θd ∼ Dir(α)
(b) For each issue k ∈ [1,K], draw frame distribu-

tion ψd,k ∼ DP(λ, ψk)
(c) For each token n ∈ [1, Nd]

i. Draw an issue zd,n ∼ Mult(θd)
ii. Draw a frame td,n ∼ Mult(ψd,zd,n)

iii. Draw word wd,n ∼ Mult(φzd,n,td,n)
3. For each legislator a ∈ [1, A] on each issue k ∈ [1,K]

(a) Draw issue-specific ideal point ua,k ∼
N (∑Jkj=1 ψ̂a,k,jηk,j , ρ) weighting ηk,j by how
much the legislator talks about that frame

Topic Hierarchy. With the goal of analyzing
agendas and frames in mind, our topic hierarchy
has two levels: (1) issue nodes and (2) frame nodes.
(Look ahead to Figure 6 for an illustration.) More
specifically, there are K issue nodes, each with a
topic φk drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with
concentration parameter β and a prior mean vector
φ?k, i.e., φk ∼ Dir(β, φ?k). In this hierarchical struc-
ture, first-level nodes map to agenda issues, which
we treat as non-polarized, and second-level nodes
map to issue-specific frames, which we assume
polarize on the issue-specific dimension.3

To improve topic interpretability, issue nodes
have an informed prior from the Congressional
Bills Project {φ?k} (Table 1).4 The frame topic φk,j

3Nguyen et al. (2013) allow first-level nodes to polarize
but find first-level nodes are typically neutral.

4The Congressional Bills Project provides a large collec-
tion of labeled congressional bill text. We compute {φ?k} as

at each frame node is a Dirichlet draw centered at
the corresponding (parent) issue node. While the
number of issues is fixed a priori, the number of
second-level frames is unbounded. We also asso-
ciate each second-level frame node with an ideal
point ηk,j ∼ N (0, γ). This resembles how su-
pervised topic models (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007;
Nguyen et al., 2015) discover polarized topics’ as-
sociated response variables.

Generating Text from Legislators. One of our
model’s goal is to study how legislators frame pol-
icy agenda issues. To achieve that, we analyze
congressional speeches (documents) {wd}, each
of which is delivered by a legislator ad. To gen-
erate each token wd,n of a speech d, legislator ad
will (1) first choose an issue zd,n ∈ [1,K] from a
document-specific multinomial θd, then (2) choose
a frame td,n from the set of infinitely many possi-
ble frames of the given issue zd,n using the frame
proportion ψd,k drawn from a Dirichlet process,
and finally (3) choose a word type from the cho-
sen frame’s topic φzd,n,td,n . In other words, our
model generates speeches using a mixture of K
HDPs (Teh et al., 2006).5

Generating Bill Text. The bill text provides in-
formation about the policy agenda issues that each
bill addresses. We use LDA to model the bill text
{w′b}. Each bill b is a mixture ϑb over K is-
sues, which is drawn from a symmetric Dirich-
let prior, i.e., ϑb ∼ Dir(α). Each token w′b,m
in bill b is generated by first choosing a topic
z′b,m ∼ Mult(ϑb), and then choosing a word type
w′b,m ∼ Mult(φz′b,m), as in LDA.
Generating Roll Call Votes. Following recent
work on multi-dimensional ideal points (Laud-
erdale and Clark, 2014; Sim et al., 2015), we define
the probability of legislator a voting “Yes” on bill
b as p(va,b = Yes |ua, xb, yb, ϑ̂b) =

Φ

(
xb

K∑
k=1

ϑ̂b,kua,k + yb

)
(2)

where ϑ̂b is the empirical distribution of bill b over
the K issues and is defined as ϑ̂b,k =

Mb,k
Mb,· . Here,

Mb,k is the number of times in which tokens in b

the empirical word distribution from all bills labeled with k.
K = 19, corresponding to 19 major topic headings in the
Policy Agendas Project Topic Codebook.

5If we abandoned the labeled data from the Congressional
Bills Project to obtain the prior means φ?k, it would be rela-
tively straightforward to extend to a fully nonparametric model
with unbounded K (Ahmed et al., 2013; Paisley et al., 2014).

1440



are assigned to issue k and Mb,· is the marginal
count, i.e., the number of tokens in bill b.

The ideal point of legislator a specifically on is-
sue k is ua,k and comes from a normal distribution

N (ψ̂Ta,kηk, ρ) ≡ N
 Jk∑
j=1

ψ̂a,k,jηk,j , ρ

 (3)
where Jk is the number of frames for topic k, which
is unbounded. The mean of the Normal distribution
is a linear combination of the ideal points {ηk,j} of
all issue k’s frames, weighted by how much time
legislator a spends on each frame when talking
about issue k, i.e., ψa,k,j =

Na,k,j
Na,k,· . Here, Na,k,j

is the number of tokens authored by a that are
assigned to frame j of issue k, and Na,k,· is the
marginal count. When Na,k,· = 0, which means
that legislator a does not talk about issue k, we
back off to an uninformed zero mean.

Equation 3 resembles how supervised topic mod-
els (SLDA) link topics with a response, in that the
response—the issue-specific ideal point ua,k—is
latent. It is similar to how Gerrish and Blei (2011)
use the bill text to regress on the bill’s latent polar-
ity xb and popularity yb. In this paper, we only use
text from congressional speeches for regression, as
these can capture how legislators frame specific top-
ics. Incorporating the bill text into the regression is
an interesting direction for future work.

4 Inference
Given observed data of (1) votes {va,b} by A

legislators on B bills, (2) speeches {wd} from leg-
islators, and (3) bill text {w′b}, we estimate the
latent variables using stochastic EM. In each itera-
tion, we perform the following steps: (1) sampling
issue assignments {z′b,m} for bill text tokens, (2)
sampling the issue assignments {zd,n} and frame
assignments {td,n} for speech tokens, (3) sampling
the topics at first-level issue nodes {φk}, (4) sam-
pling the distribution over frames {ψk} for all is-
sues, (5) optimizing frames’ regression parameters
{ηk,j} using L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), and
(6) updating legislators’ ideal points {ua,k} and
bills’ polarity {xb} and popularity {yb} using gra-
dient ascent.

Sampling Issue Assignments for Bill Tokens
The probability of assigning a token w′b,m in the
bill text to an issue k is

p(z′b,m = k | rest) ∝
M−b,mb,k + α

M−b,mb,· +Kα
· φ̂k,w′b,m (4)

where Mb,k denotes the number of tokens in bill
text b assigned to issue k. The current estimated
probability of word type v given issue k is φ̂k,v
(Equation 7). Marginal counts are denoted by · and
the superscript −b,m excludes the assignment for
token w′b,m from the corresponding count.

Sampling Frame Assignments in Speeches To
sample the assignments for tokens in the speeches,
we first sample an issue using

p(zd,n = k | rest) ∝
N−d,nd,k + α

N−d,nd,· +Kα
· φ̂k,wd,n (5)

where Nd,k similarly denotes the number of times
that tokens in d are assigned to issue k. Given the
sampled issue k, we sample the frame as
p(td,n = j | zd,n = k, ad = a, rest) ∝
N (ua,k;µa,k,j , ρ) ·

N−d,nd,k,j

)

N (ua,k;µa,k,jnew , ρ) · λ

· ψ̂k,jnew ,
(6)

where µa,k,j = (
∑Jk

j′=1 ηk,j′N
−d,n
d,k,j′ + ηk,j)/Nd,k,·

for an existing frame j, and for a newly
created frame jnew, we have µa,k,jnew =
(
∑Jk

j′=1 ηk,j′N
−d,n
d,k,j′+ηk,jnew)/Nd,k,·, where ηk,jnew

is drawn from the Gaussian prior N (0, γ). Here,
the estimated global probability of choosing a
frame j of issue k is ψ̂k,j .

Sampling Issue Topics In the generative process
of HIPTM, the topic φk of issue k (1) generates
tokens in the bill text and (2) provides the Dirichlet
priors of the issue’s frames. Rather than collapsing
multinomials and factorizing (Hu and Boyd-Graber,
2012), we follow Ahmed et al. (2013) and sample

φ̂k ∼ Dir(mk + ñk + βφ?k) (7)
wheremk ≡ (Mk,1,Mk,2, · · · ,Mk,V ) is the token
count vector from the bill text assigned to each
issue. The vector ñk ≡ (Ñk,1, Ñk,2, · · · , Ñk,V )
denotes the token counts propagated from words
assigned to topics that are associated with frames of
issue k, approximated using minimal or maximal
path assumptions (Cowans, 2006; Wallach, 2008).

Sampling Frame Proportions Following the di-
rect assignment method described in Teh et al.
(2006), we sample the global frame proportion as
ψ̂k ≡ (ψ̂k,1, ψ̂k,2, · · · , ψ̂k,jnew)
∼ Dir(N̂·,k,1, N̂·,k,2, · · · , N̂·,k,Jk , λ0) (8)

where N̂·,k,j =
∑D

d=1 N̂d,k,j and N̂d,k,j can be
sampled effectively using the Antoniak distribu-
tion (Antoniak, 1974).

Updating Ideal Points, Polarity and Popularity

each legislator a and the polarity xb and popularity

using gradient ascent.

5 Data Collection
What makes a Tea Partier? To address that ques-

tion, we use key votes identified by Freedom Works
as the most important votes on issues of economic
freedom. Led by former House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-TX), Freedom Works is a con-
servative non-profit organization which promotes
“Lower Taxes, Less Government, More Freedom”.6

Karpowitz et al. (2011) report that Freedom Works
endorsements are more effective than other Tea
Party organizations at getting out votes for Repub-
lican candidates in the 2010 midterms.

For the 112th Congress, Freedom Works selected
60 key votes, 40 in 2011 and 20 in 2012. We are
interested in ideal points with respect to the Tea
Party movement, i.e., on the anti-pro Tea Party
dimension: whether a legislator agrees with Free-
dom Works on a bill. More specifically, we assign
va,b to be 1 if legislator a agrees with Freedom
Works on bill b, and 0 otherwise. In addition to
the votes, we obtained the bill text with labels from
the Congressional Bills Project7 and the congres-
sional speeches from GovTrack.8 In total, we have
240 Republicans, 60 who self-identify with the Tea
Party Caucus, and 13,856 votes.

6 Predicting Tea Party Membership
To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of

HIPTM in capturing “Tea Partiness”, we predict Tea
Party Caucus membership of legislators given their
votes and text. This examines (1) how effective
the baseline features extracted from the votes and
text are in predicting the Caucus membership, and
(2) how much prediction improves using features
extracted from HIPTM. For baselines, we consider

simple feature sets where each legislator is repre-
sented by their speeches as either (1) a TF-IDF
vector (Salton, 1968), (2) a normalized TF-IDF
vector, or (3) a binary vector containing their votes.

Our dataset for binary prediction comprises a set
of 60 Republican representatives who self-identify
as Tea Party Caucus members and 180 who do
not. These are divided using 5-fold cross-validation
with stratified sampling, which preserves the ratio
of the two classes in both the training and test sets.
We report performance using AUC-ROC (Lusted,
1971) using SVMlight (Joachims, 1999).9 After pre-
processing, our vocabulary contains 5,349 unique
word types.

Membership from Votes and Text. First, given
the votes and text of all the legislators, we run
HIPTM for 1,000 iterations with a burn-in period of
500 iterations. After burning in, we keep the sam-
pled state of the model after every fifty iterations.
The feature values are obtained by averaging over
the ten stored models as suggested in Nguyen et al.
(2014). Each legislator a is represented by a vector
concatenating:

• K-dimensional ideal point vector estimated
from both votes and text ua,k
• K-dimensional vector, estimating the ideal
point using only text ηTk ψ̂a,k
• B probabilities estimating a’s votes on B bills
Φ(xb

Figure 2 shows AUC-ROC results for our feature
sets. VOTE-based features clearly outperform text-
based features like TF and TF-IDF. Combining
VOTE with either TF or TF-IDF does not improve
the prediction performance much (i.e., VOTE-TF
and VOTE-TF-IDF). Features extracted from our

9We use the default settings of SVMlight, except that we
set the cost-factor equal to the ratio between the number of
negative examples (i.e., number of non-Tea Party Caucus
members) and the number of positive examples (i.e., number
of Tea Party Caucus members).

model, HIPTM, also outperform TF and TF-IDF
significantly, but only slightly better than VOTE.
However, HIPTM and VOTE together significantly
outperform VOTE alone.

Membership Prediction from Text Only. The
results in Figure 2 require both votes and legisla-
tors’ language. This is limiting, since it permits
predictions of “Tea Partiness” only for people with
an established congressional voting record. A po-
tentially more interesting and practical task is pre-
diction based on language alone.

Thus, we first run our inference algorithm on
the training data, which includes both votes and
text. After training, using multiple models, we
sample the issue and frame assignments for each
token of the text authored by test lawmakers.
Since the votes are not available, HIPTM’s ex-
tracted features here only consist of (1) the K-
dimensional vector ηTk ψ̂a,k estimating legislators’
ideal point using text alone, and (2) the B proba-
bilities Φ(xb

∑K
k=1 ϑ̂b,kua,k + yb) estimating the

votes.
Figure 3 compares this approach with the two

baselines capable of using text alone, TF and TF-
IDF. Since HIPTM can no longer access the votes
in the test data, its performance drops significantly
compared with VOTE. However, it still quite
strongly outperforms the two text-based baselines,
showing that jointly modeling the voting behavior
improves the text-based elements of the model.

7 How the Tea Party Votes
In this section, we examine legislators’ ideal

points. We first expose Tea Party-specific ideal
points by examining one-dimensional ideal points
and then move on to the issue-specific ideal points
that HIPTM enables.

7.1 One-dimensional Ideal Points
First, as a baseline, we estimate the one-

dimensional ideal points of the legislators in our

points, estimated as a baseline in Section 7.1, for members and

resentatives in the 112th U.S. House. The median of members’
ideal points is significantly higher than that of non-members’.

dataset.10 Figure 4 shows the box plots of esti-
mated Tea Party ideal points for both members and
non-members.11 The Tea Party ideal points cor-
relate with DW-NOMINATE (ρ = 0.91), and the
median ideal point of Tea Party Caucus members
is higher than non-members. This confirms that
Tea Partiers are more conservative than other Re-
publicans (Williamson et al., 2011; Karpowitz et
al., 2011; Gervais and Morris, 2012; Gervais and
Morris, 2014).

Divergences involving these ideal points help
demonstrate the face validity of our approach. For
example, the model gives Jeff Flake (R-AZ) the sec-
ond highest ideal point; he only disagrees with Free-
dom Works position on one of 60 Freedom Works
key votes, but he is not a member of the Tea Party
Caucus. Another example is Justin Amash (R-MI),
who founded and is the Chairman of the Liberty
Caucus. Its members are conservative and liber-
tarian Republicans, and Amash has agreed with
Freedom Works on every single key vote selected
by Freedom Works since 2011.

Conversely, some self-identified Tea Partiers of-
ten disagree with Freedom Works and thus have
relatively low ideal points. For example, Rodney
Alexander (R-LA) only agrees with Freedom Works
48% of the time, and was a Democrat before 2004.
Alexander and Ander Crenshaw (R-FL, 50% agree-
ment) are categorized as “Green Tea” by Gervais
and Morris (2014), i.e. Republican legislators who
are “associated with the Tea Party on their own
initiative” but lack support from Tea Party organi-
zations.

10We use gradient ascent to optimize the likelihood of votes
whose probabilities are defined in Equation 1. We also put a
Gaussian priorN (0, σ) on ua, xb, and yb.

11Estimated ideal point signs might be flipped, as uaxb =
(−ua)(−xb), which makes no difference in Equation 1. To
ensure that higher ideal points are “pro-Tea Party”, we first
sort the legislators according to the fraction of votes for which
they agree with Freedom Works and initialize the ideal points
of the top and bottom five legislators with +3σ and -3σ, where
σ is the variance of ua’s Gaussian prior.

Figure 5: Box plots of ideal points dimensions, each corresponding to a major topic in the Policy Agendas Topics Codebook
estimated by our model. On most issues the ideal point distributions over the two Republican groups (member vs. non-member
of the Tea Party Caucus) overlap. The most polarized issues are Government Operations and Macroeconomics, which align well
with the agenda of the Tea Party movement supporting small government and lower taxes.

7.2 Multi-dimensional Ideal Points
While it is interesting to compare holistic mea-

sures of Tea Partiness, it doesn’t reveal how leg-
islators conform or deviate from what defines a
mainstream Tea Partier. In this section, HIPTM
reveals how issue-specific ideal points of the two
groups of Republican representatives differ.

Figure 5 shows estimated ideal points for each
policy agenda issue, sorted by the difference be-
tween the median of the two groups’ ideal points.
On most issues, the ideal point distributions of the
two Republican groups are nigh identical.

On several issues, though, the ideal point distri-
butions of the two groups of legislators diverge.
In the remainder of this section, we consider
the Government Operation, Macroeconomics, and
Transportation topics, and look at why HIPTM esti-
mates these issues as the most polarized.

Government operations Tea Partiers differ
from their Republican colleagues on reducing gov-
ernment spending on the Economic Development
Administration, the Energy Efficiency and Renew-
able Energy Program and Fossil Fuel Research and
Development. More specifically, for example, on
the key vote to eliminate the Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Program, nearly 80% (41 out
of 53) of Tea Partiers vote “Yea” (with Freedom
Works) but only 43% of non-Tea Partiers agree.

Macroeconomics Our model estimates
Macroeconomics policies as being the sec-
ond most polarizing topic for House Republicans,
which is consistent with the emphasis that the Tea
Party places on issues like a balanced budget and
reduced federal spending. Indeed, we see that
Tea Party Republicans have distinct preferences
on these types of issues as compared to more

mainstream Republican legislators. An illustration
of this polarization can be seen in the intra-party
fight over the budget. Roll call vote 275 in 2011
and roll call vote 149 in 2012 both would have
replaced Paul Ryan’s budget (the “establishment”
Republican budget) with the Republican Study
Committee’s (RSC) “Back to Basics” budget that
would cut spending more aggressively and balance
the budget in a decade. In 2011, non-Tea Party
Republicans were evenly split in their budget
preferences, but three quarters of the Tea Party
Caucus supported it, which illustrates the differ-
ence between the two factions of the Republican
party. Similarly, in 2012, more than 80% of Tea
Partiers voted for the the RSC budget, but fewer
than half of non-Tea Party Republicans did. Other
polarizing votes in the Macroeconomics topic
include votes to raise the debt ceiling and to avert
the “fiscal cliff”. In these cases, support for these
votes was 25 percentage points higher among Tea
Partiers than non-Tea Party Republicans, which
again illustrates their distinct policy preferences.

Transportation Transportation is the third most
polarized issue estimated by our model, with two
key votes focusing on federal spending on trans-
portation that illustrate some polarization, but also
some shared preferences among Republicans. Con-
sistent with the Tea Party’s emphasis on reducing
government spending, Tea Party Republicans voted
differently from their non-Tea Party colleagues on
these issues. The first key vote, roll call vote 378 in
2012, caps highway spending at the amount taken
in by the gas tax. More than half of Tea Party Cau-
cus members (32 out of 55) voted in favor, while
non-members voted against it by a greater than 2:1
margin (122 of 172). Conversely, the second key
vote (roll call vote 451 in 2012) authorizes fed-

eral highway spending at a level that far exceeds
its revenue from the gas tax, which was opposed
by Freedom Works. This measure was broadly
popular with Republicans regardless of Tea Party
affiliation and a majority of both Tea Partiers and
non-Tea Partiers opposed it.

8 How the Tea Party Talks
Looking at HIPTM’s induced topic hierarchy, us-

ing labeled data to create informative priors pro-
duces highly interpretable topics at the agenda-
issue level; e.g., see the first-level nodes in Figure 6,
which capture key issue-level debates. For exam-
ple, one major event during the 112th Congress was
the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, which dominates dis-
cussions in Macroeconomics. Similarly, Defense
is dominated by withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq.

Turning to framing, recall that second-level
nodes of the hierarchy capture issue-specific frames
of parent issues, each one associated with a frame-
specific ideal point. To analyze intra-Republican
polarization, we first compute, for each issue k, the
span of ideal points the frames associated with k,
i.e., the difference between the maximum and the
minimum ideal points for frames under that issue.12

We then consider several issues with a large span,
i.e. whose frames are highly polarized.

Macroeconomics. The HIPTM subtree for
Macroeconomics, in Figure 6 (top), foregrounds

12The frame proportions Dirichlet process ψk creates many
frames with one or two observations (Miller and Harrison,
2013). We ignore those with posterior probability ψk,j < 0.1.

Republican polarization related to budget issues.
The most Tea Party oriented frame node, M3,
focuses on criticizing government overspending,
a recurring Tea Party theme.13 In contrast,
Frame M1, least oriented toward the Tea Party,
focuses on the downsides of a government
shutdown, highlighting establishment Republican
concerns about being held responsible for the
political and economic consequences.

Health. Healthcare was a central issue during
the 112th Congress, particularly the Affordable
Care Act (Obamacare). Although all Republicans
voted to repeal Obamacare, Figure 6 (bottom) high-
lights intra-party differences in framing the issue.
Frame H1 leans strongest toward the establishment
Republican end of the spectrum, and frames op-
position in terms of the implementation of health
care exchanges and the mandatory costs of the pro-
gram. In contrast, H3 captures the more strident
Tea Party framing of Obamacare as an unconstitu-
tional government takeover. More neutral from
an intra-party perspective, Frame H2 emphasizes
Medicare, Medicaid, and the role of health care
professionals within these systems.14

Labor, Employment and Immigration. The
discussion of this issue illustrates how HIPTM some-
times captures frames that are distinct from Tea
Partiness, per se. For example, it discovered a
strongly Tea Party oriented frame that focused on
“union, south carolina, nlrb, boeing”. On inspec-
tion, this frame reflects a controversy in which the
National Labor Relations Board accused airline
manufacturer Boeing of violating Federal labor law
by transferring production to a non-union facility
in South Carolina “for discriminatory reasons”,15

and surfaces mainly in speeches by four legislators
from South Carolina, three of whom are from the
Tea Party Caucus. This second-level topic illus-
trates a limitation of HIPTM; it does not formally
distinguish frames from other kinds of subtopics.
We observe that modeling polarization on other
kinds of sub-issues is nonetheless valuable: here
it highlights a geographic locus of conflict involv-

13E.g., Scott Garrett (R-NJ): “We will not compromise on
our principles; our principles of defending the Constitution
and defending Americans and making sure that our posterity
does not have this excessive debt on it.”

14This does not mean that discussions using this frame
lacked combative or partisan elements. For example, Glenn
Thompson (R-PA) argues that “on the Democratic side, they’re
just willing to pull the plug and let [Medicare] die”.

are Tea Party Caucus members. This may provide
insight into how geography shapes Tea Party mem-
bership (Gervais and Morris, 2012).

9 Latent and Visible Disagreement

Our analyses suggest a novel framework for un-
derstanding the political and policymaking impli-
cations of the Tea Party in the 112th Congress, il-
lustrated in Table 2. Each issue can be character-
ized by two features: (1) the degree to which ideal
points among Republican legislators are polarized,
and (2) the degree to which the frames used are po-
larized. From these two assessments, we can orga-
nize all policy issues into four categories that have
meaningful implications for congressional politics
and policy outcomes. At upper left we will find
issues where HIPTM indicates low intra-party po-
larization between Tea Party and non-Tea Party,
and all Republicans tend to frame the issue in sim-
ilar ways; e.g., Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and
Civil Liberties. In such cases, we expect cooper-
ation among Republicans regardless of Tea Party
status, therefore a greater likelihood of bill pas-
sage in a majority-Republican House. In stark con-
trast, issues at lower right involve polarized ideal
points and polarized framing, e.g., the budget cri-
sis, where many establishment Republicans balked
at a government shutdown but hard-line Tea Party
legislators did not. These issues pose the greatest
challenge to Republican party leaders.

Between these extremes are the issues in which
either Republicans’ ideal points or their policy
frames are polarized. Our model suggests that on
issues at upper right, with similar framing, the Tea
Party and establishment Republicans will appear
to be in sync, and therefore it may seem to voters
that legislative progress is likely, but the under-
lying issue polarization will make it hard to find
policy common ground, potentially increasing pub-
lic frustration. Last, at lower left are issues where

Republicans generally share similar ideal points
and vote similarly, but frame the issue in distinct
ways, e.g., Obamacare. Here legislative success
may come despite the appearance that Republican
factions are talking past each other, because the
distribution of their ideal points on the policy is
actually quite similar. Put differently, Republicans
share policy goals on issues in this quadrant even
if they frame those preferences differently, and this
underlying agreement on the ideal point may al-
low Republicans to reach consensus even when the
political rhetoric suggests otherwise.

10 Conclusion

We introduce HIPTM, which integrates hierarchi-
cal topic modeling with multi-dimensional ideal
points to jointly model voting behavior, the text
content of bills, and the language used by legisla-
tors. HIPTM is more effective than previous meth-
ods on the task of predicting membership in the
Tea Party Caucus. This improvement is especially
consequential as the formal organization of the Tea
Party Caucus is now defunct in the House, yet Tea
Party legislators remain both numerous and influen-
tial in Congress. In addition, unlike previous ideal-
point methods, HIPTM makes it possible to make
predictions for members of Congress who have not
yet established a voting record. More intriguingly,
this also suggests the possibility of assessing the
“Tea Partiness” of candidates (or, anyone else, e.g.,
media outlets) based on language.

It is political conventional wisdom that the in-
flux of Tea Party legislators in the 112th Congress
complicated the task of governance and policymak-
ing for Republican leaders. By looking at issue-
level ideal points and issue-specific framing using
our model, we begin to address the complexity
of this relationship, finding the model successful
both in establishing face validity and in suggesting
novel insights into the dynamics of a Republican
Congress. In future work, we plan to pursue the
new framework suggested by our analyses, inves-
tigating the interaction of issue polarization and
framing-based polarization. With the help of these
new tools, we aim to both understand and predict
substantive policy areas in which the Tea Party is
likely to be most successful working with the Re-
publican party, and, conversely, to flag ahead of
time policy areas in which we can expect to see
legislative gridlock and grandstanding.
