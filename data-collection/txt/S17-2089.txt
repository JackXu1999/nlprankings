Abstract

This paper discusses the “Fine-Grained
Sentiment Analysis on Financial Mi-
croblogs and News” task as part of
SemEval-2017, specifically under the
“Detecting sentiment, humour, and truth”
theme. This task contains two tracks, where
the first one concerns Microblog messages
and the second one covers News Statements
and Headlines. The main goal behind both
tracks was to predict the sentiment score for
each of the mentioned companies/stocks.
The sentiment scores for each text instance
adopted floating point values in the range
of -1 (very negative/bearish) to 1 (very
positive/bullish), with 0 designating neutral
sentiment. This task attracted a total of 32
participants, with 25 participating in Track
1 and 29 in Track 2.

1 Overview

Our task is focused on Sentiment Analysis in the
domain of financial microblogs and news. Domain-
specific Sentiment Analysis has received much at-
tention within the NLP community, motivated by
the highly domain-dependent language used to ex-
press sentiment (Liu, 2012). Domain-specificity
impacts all levels of analysis. On the lexical level,
which is crucial in sentiment analysis, Liu (2012)
notes that positive words in one domain can be
negative in another, and vice versa. For instance,
Loughran and McDonald (2011a) show that many
words which are considered negative in general-
purpose polarity lexicon have a neutral meaning in
the financial domain (e.g. “liability”). This makes it
difficult to transport sentiment classifiers across do-
mains and underlines the need for domain-specific
tools.

The financial domain is a high-impact use case
for Sentiment Analysis because it has been shown

that sentiments and opinions can affect market dy-
namics (Goonatilake and Herath, 2007; de Kauter
et al., 2015). Sentiments are in some cases de-
rived from news which discuss macroeconomic fac-
tors, company-specific, or political information as
all of these can be market-relevant (Sinha, 2014).
Good news tends to lift markets and increase opti-
mism (de Kauter et al., 2015; Schuster, 2003). Ev-
idence has been found that both quantitative mea-
sures (e.g. the quantity of news, market fluctu-
ation) and qualitative indicators, (e.g. linguistic
style and tone) affect investors’ behaviour (Tet-
lock et al., 2008; Loughran and McDonald, 2011a;
Takala et al., 2014). (Bollen et al., 2011) showed
that changes in public mood reflect value shifts in
the Dow Jones Industrial Index three to four days
later.

Given the link between sentiment and market dy-
namics, the analysis of public sentiment becomes
a powerful method to predict the market reaction.
However, the accuracy of machine learning-based
sentiment analysis approaches rarely exceeds sev-
enty percent (Takala et al., 2014; Eagle Alpha,
2016). Research effort is required to overcome and
address complex linguistic issues, such as sarcasm,
irony and poorly-structured and/or colloquial lan-
guage (Eagle Alpha, 2016). In addition, text that is
short in length (such as microblog messages) can be
quite opinionated, dense in information, dependent
on the modelling of economic context and challeng-
ing to parse, due to the different vocabularies used
(Sinha, 2014). Our task is motivated by the interest
of this field and the great potential for improvement.
It aims at assessing the overall market sentiment as
well as sentiment about specific stocks and thus to
make use of their predictive power.

More specifically, the aim of organising this task
and creating this test collection was to achieve the
following goals:

1. Developing state-of-the-art on classification

519



methods for sentiment analysis in the domain
of financial short texts.

2. Incentivising the creation of new lexical re-
sources for the financial domain.

3. Understanding how state-of-the-art sentiment
analysis performs on a domain-specific /
highly technical corpus.

4. Improving the understanding of linguistic phe-
nomena and the creation of semantic models
for the financial domain.

The domain of finance has unique linguistic and
semantic features, whose interpretation depends on
the formulation of semantic models which reflect
the economic and mathematical tools used by the
experts to assess financial information. More-
over, the accurate interpretation of financial text re-
quires the orchestration of large volumes of com-
mon sense and domain-specific financial/economic
knowledge. Additionally, as much of the finan-
cial discourse is mediated by terms which demand
precise definitions, many times associated with
the quantification of economic phenomena, the se-
mantic interpretation processes in the financial do-
main require fine-grained semantic interpretation
approaches.

From a linguistic standpoint, topics of interest in
this task include (but are not limited to):

• Low-level linguistic analysis tools for the fi-
nancial domain (e.g. tokenization, part-of-
speech tagging, parsing)

• Sentiment classification on financial texts;

• Understanding of linguistic phenomena asso-
ciated with financial tweets;

• New semantic models for finance;

• Construction and application of distributional
semantic models on finance;

• Sentiment compositionality;

• Machine learning approaches for sentiment
classification;

• Lexical resources for the financial domain;

2 Data

2.1 Tracks
The test collection consists of two tracks:

1. Microblog Messages derived from two
sources:

(a) StockTwits Messages: Consists of mi-
croblog messages focusing on stock mar-
ket events and assessments from investors
and traders, exchanged via the Stock-
Twits microblogging platform1. Typical
stocktwits consist of references to com-
pany stock symbols (so-called cashtags
- a stock symbol preceded by “$”, e.g.
“$AAPL” for the company Apple Inc.),
a short supporting text or references to
a link or pictures (typically containing
charts showing stock values analysis).

(b) Twitter Messages: Some stock market
discussion also takes place on the Twitter
platform2. In order to extend and diver-
sify our data sources, we extract Twitter
posts containing company stock symbols
(cashtags).

2. News Statements & Headlines Sentences
have been taken from news headlines as well
as news text. The textual content was crawled
from different sources on the Internet, such as
Yahoo Finance3. The Enterprise identification
for this track was based on company names
and abbreviations, as cashtags are not typically
used in news statements and headlines.

2.2 Corpus Creation
The corpus of statements was created by conduct-
ing random sampling and an initial filtering pro-
cess over a pool of StockTwits messages, tweets and
RSS News feeds.

While the random sampling ensured an unbiased
set of statements, the filtering mechanism aimed at
removing messages from the set microblog mes-
sages which are spam. The filtering mechanism was
based on a manual curation of the set of microblog
users which are classified as spammers. The goal
of data sampling is to come up with a most repre-
sentative and manageable amount of data for man-
ual annotation. The first step in our case is to ap-

1http://stocktwits.com/
2https://twitter.com
3http://finance.yahoo.com/

520



ply a stratified random sampling by objects δ per
the smallest time unit level θ we determine (in our
case it is stock’s messages per day) to ensure that
all different objects are adequately represented in
the sample with respect to their distribution in the
population. Then, the random samples of a time-
unit level θi are pooled into a time-unit level θi+1
and randomly sampled.

The purpose of re-sampling at different time-unit
levels is to make the resulted random sample more
random, more balanced and more representative of
the entire time-span of our data. A general negative
sentiment in a certain sub-sample will be counter-
balanced by the other sub-samples.

StockTwits data have been provided by Stock-
Twits in a batch export and refer to the period from
October 2011 to June 2015. The original pool be-
fore sampling contains 27 million StockTwits, from
which 1847 messages were sampled. Twitter data
was collected between March 11th and 18th 2016
using the official Streaming APIs. Sampling was
also applied to this data and resulted in a sample of
1591 messages.

The News Statements and Headlines have been
collected from a pool of 20.000 RSS feeds in the
period between August and November 2015 (e.g.
AP News, Reuters, Handelsblatt, Bloomberg and
Forbes). A final set of about 1780 News Statements
and Headlines has been produced.

2.3 Annotation
To create the Gold Standard, the final sample has
been annotated by 3 independent financial expert
annotators using a Web platform developed for that
purpose and according to the annotations guidelines
we defined. A fourth domain expert consolidated
the ratings to create the final data set. The total
time the experts spend on annotating and consoli-
dating the data set is 120 hours (30 hours per ex-
pert). The costs of annotation and consolidation
have been covered by ICT-15-2014 Grant: 645425
(SSIX project).

Each statement (instance) is annotated with the
following information:

• Cashtag (subtask1) / Company (subtask2):
A stock company symbol (for microblogs) or
reference to a company (for news/headlines) to
which a sentiment score is assigned.

• Sentiment Score: A sentiment between -
1 (very negative/bearish) and 1 (very posi-
tive/bullish), with 0 representing neutral/no

sentiment is assigned to each cashtag or com-
pany. The sentiment is assigned from the point
of view of an investor and the sentiment anno-
tation is carried out by domain experts. Textual
data containing information implying a posi-
tive prospective trend for a company or stock,
the markets, or the economy, in general, con-
stitutes a positive sentiment, whereas infor-
mation revealing negative trends constitutes a
negative sentiment since it may impact compa-
nies, markets or the economy negatively.

• Span (subtask 1): extract of a text string in
which sentiment is expressed.

• Message (subtask 1) / Title (subtask2): Text
string in which sentiment is expressed.

• Source (subtask 1): Either ”twitter” or ”stock-
twits” dependent on the origin of the text mes-
sage.

Examples of annotated microblog messages and
news headlines are provided in Section 2.6 below.

The quality of the annotations was assessed fol-
lowing a similar methodology as proposed in Takala
et al. (2014), where inter-annotator agreements
measures for continuous data is calculated for the
sentiment classifications. Spearman’s Rank Corre-
lation on sentiment scores was calculated for each
pair of annotators, then averaged across annotator
pairs. This yielded the following results: 0.54 for
news headlines (three annotators, three pairs) and
0.69 for microblogs (four annotators, six pairs).

2.4 Gold Standard

After annotating and consolidating the data, the
gold standard for subtask 1 consists of 2510 Twit-
ter and StockTwit messages. The gold standard for
subtask 2 contains 1647 Headlines and News State-
ments.

2.5 Task Formulation

Participating systems needed to fulfil the following
task: given a text instance (microblog message in
Track 1, news statement or headline in Track 2; cp.
Section 2.1), predicting the sentiment score for each
of the companies/stocks mentioned. Sentiment val-
ues needed to be floating point values within the
range of -1 (very negative/bearish) to 1 (very pos-
itive/bullish), with 0 designating neutral sentiment.

2.6 Examples
Below we present annotated example statements,
two for microblogs and one for news. Please note
that sentiment score agreement as per Section 2.3
is not given as annotations for these examples were
provided by a single expert. Also, the string covered
by the ’span’ is given for ease of reading.

2.7 Assessment Infrastructure & Baselines
Two classification baselines were provided:

• Random selection: Consists of a random
number generated within the sentiment range.

• SentiWordNet-based average and maxi-
mum functions: Consist of the maximum and
averaging of all the sentiment words using a
simple SentiWordNet-based lookup.

For the Microblogs test set, SentiWordNet
lexicon-based look-up (average) achieved an aver-
age score of 0.3021, while the same look-up method
using the max/min score achieved 0.2428. The ran-
dom baseline achieved 0.0148.

For the Financial Headlines test set, a SentiWord-
Net lexicon-based look-up classifier, which aver-
ages all the sentiment scores of individual lem-
matised words, achieved a score of 0.290, while
the same look-up method using a max/min score
achieved 0.2184. The random baseline achieved
0.1064.

3 Pilot Task

A pilot dataset consisting of financial social data
was collected from two on-line social networking
services, specifically Twitter and StockTwits, as
part of a pilot study carried out within the SSIX: So-
cial Sentiment analysis financial IndeXes4 project
as part of the European Horizon 2020 Research and
Innovation programme (Davis et al., 2016). A do-
main expert experienced in trading annotated 100
tweets and 100 StockTwits messages selected ran-
domly. He annotated the messages for sentiment
following the guideline of assuming the point of
view of an investor in the given stock(s) (see Sec-
tion 2.3 above).

The results from the pilot study provided valu-
able insights with regards to the distribution of sen-
timent and the need for improved filtering (Figures
3 and 2). These insights proved to be valuable when
building the data set for this task, enabling us to pro-
vide a higher-quality data collection.

The results (Figure 1) showed a relatively even
distribution of positive and negative sentiment, with
slight differences between the StockTwits and Twit-
ter sources as regards the intensity of the sentiment
.

StockTwits and Twitter

and irrelevant messages on Twitter.

Figure 3

and irrelevant messages on StockTwits.

The pilot study also pointed to the need to im-
prove the filtering phase as 25% - 36% of Twitter
and StockTwits messages, respectively, have been
deemed irrelevant (i.e. spam and/or not providing
any relevant financial sentiment) by the annotator
(figure 3 and 2). As a consequence, filtering rules
have been added to the filtering phase and the data
for the gold standard proposed in this task under-

523



went additionally manual post-filtering by a domain
expert prior to sentiment annotation. This is ensur-
ing that only relevant messages are included in the
data set.

4 Evaluation

The Evaluation of the participating systems was
based on cosine similarity, in a spirit similar to
Ghosh et al. (2015). As the sentiment scores to be
predicted by systems lie on a continuous scale be-
tween -1 and 1 (cp. Section 2.5), cosine enables
us to compare the proximity between gold standard
and predicted results (conceptualized as vectors),
while not requiring exact correspondence between
the gold and predicted score for a given instance.
An instance is a message or headline which can in-
clude several entities (companies or cashtags). Co-
sine similarity is calculated according to equation
(1), where G is the vector of gold standard scores
and P is the vector of corresponding scores pre-
dicted by the system:

cosine(G,P ) =

n∑
i=1

Gi × Pi√
n∑

i=1
G2i ×

√
n∑

i=1
P 2i

(1)

In order to reward systems which attempt to an-
swer all problems in the gold standard, the final
score is obtained by weighting the cosine similar-
ity from (1) with the ratio of answered problems
(scored instances), given in (2) in line with Ghosh
et al. (2015).

cos weight =
|P |
|G| (2)

The equation for the final score is the product of the
cosine similarity (1) and the weight (2), given in (3).

final score = cos weight× cosine(G,P ) (3)

5 Results and Participants

Task 5 attracted a total of 32 participants: 25 teams
participated in Track 1 and 29 in Track 2, of which
22 teams addressed both tracks. The analysis and
results for each track are discussed in more detail in
the sub-sections below. Given that 19 out of the 32
participants submitted a paper with their approach
and findings, we opted to include the system analy-
sis and ranking of results of only the submitted par-
ticipants.

Analysis of the systems consisted of the follow-
ing criteria: pre-processing methods, techniques
used, external sources, data sets and/or lexica used,
tools utilised, why the adopted approach was cho-
sen and if it is (i) multilingual/cross-lingual and/or
(ii) domain dependent/independent, any issues en-
countered and how they were tackled and poten-
tially solved.

5.1 Track 1 - Microblog Messages

Figure 4 shows the results of the 25 participants
in Track 1. Results of all participants were
ranked (first column) according to the evaluation
metric (last column) described in the Section 4
- Evaluation. The second column specifies the
team’s/participant’s name. Please note that the anal-
ysis of systems discussed in this sub-section in-
cludes only the participants highlighted in yellow
since only these submitted a paper with their ap-
proach and findings.

5.1.1 Pre-processing
In terms of pre-processing, all 14 participants
adopted some methods in order to clean the mi-
croblog messages before further processing. The
most common methods used were: removal of
special characters and/or punctuations, removal of
URLs and user mentions (‘@username’) and/or
substitution of certain expressions by specific words
(e.g., replace ‘full urls’ with ‘url’ and ‘company
names’ with ‘company’), stop word removal, to-
kenisation, lemmatisation and lowercase conver-
sion. Some participants also performed Named En-
tity Recognition (NER), emoticon removal, Part-of-
Speech (POS) tagging, stemming and URL resolu-
tion, besides other specific tasks, such as concate-
nation of spans to form a unified string (Nasim,
2017). NLTK5 was the tool mostly used (Seyed-
itabari et al., 2017; Deborah et al., 2017; Kumar
et al., 2017; Symeonidis et al., 2017; Jiang et al.,
2017) for pre-processing tasks, such as lemmatisa-
tion, stemming and lowercase conversion.

5.1.2 Techniques
All the techniques used by each system of the 14
participants are shown in Figure 5. Each system
was analysed and in-turn categorised under one of
the following techniques: Hybrid, Machine Learn-
ing (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Lexicon-based
(Lex).

It is clear that most techniques were of a Hybrid
nature with the Machine Learning and Lexicon-
based approach being the most popular choice, fol-
lowed by Machine Learning-based approaches. Au-
thors of some systems experimented with multiple
approaches to find the one that fared best in the
competition. In fact, Cabanski et al. (2017) im-
plemented two-hybrid techniques (as noted above),
where the Hybrid (DL, Lex) approach produced
their best result for this track. On the other hand,
Kumar et al. (2017) implemented two Hybrid (ML,
Lex) systems, one adopting Support Vector Ma-
chine and Logistic Regression and the other adopt-
ing SVR.

The Hybrid (ML, Lex) technique by Jiang et al.
(2017) ranked first for this track, whereas the Hy-
brid (DL, Lex) technique by Ghosal et al. (2017)
ranked second. The system placing third (Deborah
et al., 2017) adopted a ML technique.

The Machine Learning-based techniques made
use of the following algorithms:

• Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - adopted by

Li (2017); Symeonidis et al. (2017); Saleiro
et al. (2017)

• Random Forests - adopted by Seyeditabari
et al. (2017); Symeonidis et al. (2017); Jiang
et al. (2017); Saleiro et al. (2017)

• Support Vector Machine (SVM) - adopted by
Seyeditabari et al. (2017); Cabanski et al.

• Logistic Regression (LoR) - adopted by Seyed-
itabari et al. (2017); Kumar et al. (2017)

• Naive Bayes (NB) - adopted by Seyeditabari
et al. (2017)

• Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process (MKGP) -
adopted by Deborah et al. (2017)

• XGBoost Regressor (XGB) - adopted by
Nasim (2017); Jiang et al. (2017)

• Boosted Decision Tree Regression (BDTR) -
adopted by Symeonidis et al. (2017)

• AdaBoost Regressor (ABR) - adopted by Jiang
et al. (2017)

• Bagging Regressor (BR) - adopted by Jiang
et al. (2017)

• Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) - adopted
by Jiang et al. (2017)

• Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Oper-
ator (LASSO) - adopted by Jiang et al. (2017)

The most common ML techniques used overall
–by 4 participants– were RF, SVM and SVR. The
SVR was part of the ensemble regression model
used by the system that ranked first for this track
(Jiang et al., 2017). The RF classifier was ulti-
mately used by Seyeditabari et al. (2017), since it
is the best performer in terms of tweets classifica-
tion. Regarding the ANN computational approach,
both Li (2017) and Symeonidis et al. (2017) use a
regression method, whereas Saleiro et al. (2017) use
a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

The Deep Learning-based techniques made use
of the following algorithms:

• Harvard’s General Inquirer Lexicon13 -
adopted by Jiang et al. (2017); Ghosal et al.
(2017)

• IMDB (Zhu et al., 2013) - adopted by Jiang
et al. (2017)

• AFINN14 - adopted by Jiang et al. (2017)
• Corpus of Business News (Pivovarova et al.,

2013) - adopted by Pivovarova et al. (2017)

The following three lexica listed are the ones
mostly used overall: (i) the Loughran and McDon-
ald Sentiment Word (rank 2), (ii) Opinion Lexicon
(rank 1, 2) and (iii) MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon
(rank 1, 2). An interesting observation is that the
systems that ranked first (Jiang et al., 2017) and
second (Ghosal et al., 2017) in this track utilised
all three lexicons (ranked system using the particu-
lar lexicon represented next to each name), whereby
lexica (ii) and (iii) were used by both.

Seyeditabari et al. (2017) extended Loughran
and McDonald’s word list of positive and negative
words with 10,000 financial reports containing a
summary of the company’s performances in order
to add features to the training dataset In Cabanski
et al. (2017), the authors, besides using the senti-
ment lexica identified above, also built and used a
custom Financial Sentiment Lexicon.

5.2 Track 2 - News Statements and Headlines
Figure 6 shows the results of the 29 participants in
Track 2. Results of all participants were ranked
(first column) according to the evaluation metric
(last column) described in Section 4 - Evaluation.
The second column specifies the team/participant
name. Please note that the analysis of systems dis-
cussed in this sub-section includes only the partic-
ipants highlighted in yellow, which are the partic-
ipants who submitted a paper with their approach
and findings.

5.2.1 Pre-processing
In terms of pre-processing – same as for Track 1
– all 17 participants adopted some methods in or-
der to clean the news statements and headlines be-
fore further processing. The most common meth-
ods used were: removal of numbers, special char-
acters and/or punctuations, removal of URLs and
user mentions and/or substitution of certain expres-
sions with tags (e.g. replace ‘company name’ with

Figure 6: Track 2 Results

‘〈company〉’ and ‘numbers’ with ‘〈number〉’), stop
word removal, tokenisation, lemmatisation, lower-
case conversion and NER on certain entities (e.g.,
Organisation and Person). Some participants also
performed dependency parsing, POS tagging, stem-
ming and URL resolution, besides other specific
tasks, such as filtering out all named entities and
keeping only “general” tokens given that they are
generally the ones carrying the sentiment (Rotim
et al., 2017). Same as track 1, NLTK was the tool
mostly used (Ghosal et al., 2017; Deborah et al.,
2017; Kumar et al., 2017; Symeonidis et al., 2017;
Jiang et al., 2017) for pre-processing, whereas Stan-
ford CoreNLP15 was used for performing NER,
sentence breaking and parsing. (Nasim, 2017; Ro-
tim et al., 2017; Schouten et al., 2017; Chen et al.,
2017; Jiang et al., 2017)

5.2.2 Techniques
Figure 7 shows all the techniques used by each sys-
tem of the 17 participants. Each system has been
analysed and categorised under one of the follow-
ing techniques: Hybrid, Machine Learning (ML),
Deep Learning (DL), Lexicon (Lex) and Ontology
(Ont).

Similar to track 1, the Machine Learning and a
Machine Learning/Lexicon-based Hybrid approach
were the ones mostly used (six participants). How-
ever, the techniques were more balanced in this
track, with six participants adopting a Machine
Learning-based approach. It is worth noting that
one of the systems used a Machine Learning and
Ontology-based Hybrid approach, which technique
is unique in both tracks. In this system,Schouten
et al. (2017) used the SVR algorithm with ontol-
ogy features (including features derived from ontol-
ogy reasoning), which ontology was self-designed
by the authors. Multiple techniques were used by
some authors in order to find the best one to use
in this competition within their system. Moore and
Rayson (2017) experimented with an ML and DL
algorithm respectively, with the latter performing
better. On the other hand, Cabanski et al. (2017)
implemented two-hybrid techniques, where the Hy-
brid (DL, Lex) approach produced their best result
for this track , same as for track 1.

The systems that ranked first (Mansar et al.,
2017) and second (Kar et al., 2017) both adopted a
Hybrid (DL, Lex) technique, whereas an ML tech-
nique was used by the system in rank three.

The Machine Learning-based techniques made
use of the following algorithms:

• Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - adopted by
Symeonidis et al. (2017)

• Random Forests - adopted by Symeonidis et al.
(2017); Jiang et al. (2017); Saleiro et al. (2017)

• Support Vector Machine (SVM) - adopted by
Kumar et al. (2017); Saleiro et al. (2017)

• Support Vector Regression (SVR) - adopted by
Rotim et al. (2017); Schouten et al. (2017);
Moore and Rayson (2017); John and Vech-
tomova (2017); Zini et al. (2017); Cabanski
et al. (2017); Kumar et al. (2017); Chen et al.
(2017); Jiang et al. (2017)

Vechtomova (2017); Symeonidis et al. (2017)

• Logistic Regression (LoR) - adopted by Kumar
et al. (2017)

• Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process (MKGP) -
adopted by Deborah et al. (2017)

• XGBoost Regressor (XGB) - adopted by
Nasim (2017); John and Vechtomova (2017);
Jiang et al. (2017)

• Boosted Decision Tree Regression (BDTR) -
adopted by Symeonidis et al. (2017)

• AdaBoost Regressor (ABR) - adopted by Jiang
et al. (2017)

• Bagging Regressor (BR) - adopted by Jiang
et al. (2017)

• Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) - adopted
by Jiang et al. (2017)

• Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Oper-
ator (LASSO) - adopted by Jiang et al. (2017)

As can be seen above, the most common ML
technique used within the systems was SVR by
9 participants. This was used by the system that
ranked third for this track (Rotim et al., 2017).

The Deep Learning-based techniques made use
of the following algorithms:

• Convolution Neural Network (CNN) - adopted
by Mansar et al. (2017); Pivovarova et al.
(2017); Ghosal et al. (2017); Kar et al. (2017)

• Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) : Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - adopted by
Ghosal et al. (2017); Cabanski et al. (2017)

• RNN : Bidirectional Long Short-Term Mem-
ory (BLSTM) - adopted by Moore and Rayson
(2017)

• Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU)
- adopted by Kar et al. (2017)

The CNN algorithm was the most popular
amongst all Deep Learning-based techniques, with
both systems ranking first (Mansar et al., 2017) and
second (Kar et al., 2017) using it.

Lexicon-based methods made use of the follow-
ing known sentiment lexica:

• Loughran and McDonald Sentiment Word
Lists - adopted by Nasim (2017); Ghosal et al.
(2017); Kumar et al. (2017); Saleiro et al.
(2017)

In total, four lexica listed above are the ones
mostly used (all by 4 participants each): (i) the
Loughran and McDonald Sentiment Word, (ii) Sen-
tiWordNet, (iii) Opinion Lexicon and (iv) Harvard’s
General Inquirer Lexicon. Unlike the case in track
1, none of the participants ranked first till third used
one of these four lexica.

Some authors constructed their own lexica from
external sources, such as Moore and Rayson (2017)
(rank four) who manually downloaded 189,206 fi-
nancial articles which contain 161,877,425 tokens
from Factiva17 (articles come from sources such as
Financial Times that relate to United States compa-
nies only).

5.2.3 Tools used in both tracks
Several tools were used within the participants’ sys-
tems, with the following (Figure 8) being the most
popular:

Scikit-learn is a Machine Learning kit (in Python)
that offers simple efficient tools (e.g., classification
and regression algorithms) for data mining and data
analysis. This is the tool mostly used by the par-
ticipants of our task (42% in total) to compute their
results. Similarly, Weka –a collection of machine
learning algorithms for data mining tasks– was used
by 2 participants. The Keras Deep Learning library
was used by 2 participants, whereas TensorFlow –
an open source software library for numerical com-
putation using data flow graph– was also used by 3
participants (work in Pivovarova et al. (2017) built
their implementation on top of it).

GloVe, an unsupervised learning algorithm for
obtaining vector representations of words, was used
by 6 participants for word embeddings. Word2vec
–an efficient implementation of the continuous bag-
of-words and skip-gram architectures for comput-
ing vector representations of words– was also used
for the same purpose by 4 participants.

5.3 General assessment of the task

The approaches proposed by the participating sys-
tems explored a combination of machine learning
methods using lexical features, sentiment lexical re-
sources (both generic and specific to finance) and
pre-trained word embedding models. Novel fea-
tures specific to the task included the creation of
a domain-specific ontology (Schouten et al., 2017),
a stocktwits-based embedding model and distance
supervision model (Li, 2017) and domain-specific
lexica (Moore and Rayson, 2017). Moreover, due
to the emphasis of the task on the sentiment clas-
sification on a continuous scale, many approaches
targeted regression-based models.

With the exception of Cabanski et al. (2017),
few approaches explicitly tackled the problem of
compositionality (Sales et al., 2016), valency shift-
ing (Malo et al., 2014a), and clausal disembedding
(Niklaus et al., 2016), a fact that is reflected by the
lack of submissions which explored syntactic fea-
tures.

With regard to language transportability, most ap-
proaches have a medium level of transportability,
being dependent on the translation of the sentiment
lexica, but not depending on syntactic parser.

Important specific aspects proposed by the task
remained unexplored or poorly explored, including:

(i) the use of quantitative background knowledge
(e.g. stock price, financial report data), (ii) the use
of the annotated text spans.

6 Alternative Evaluation Metric

Based on the evaluation metric as stated in Section
4, another evaluation metric has been developed
during the competition. The intention to propose
a modified way of evaluation was based on the fact
that the cosine similarity (1) is treating all predicted
scores with the same weight. This approach is not
exploiting all information given in the data set, in
specific it is not taking the link between entities and
instances into consideration.

6.1 First Modification

Therefore, we proposed an approach which is us-
ing multiple vectors (one per instance) instead of
only two. These instance vectors are containing one
score per corresponding entity. Cosine similarity
scores are calculated for each instance and added up
to then divide the sum of all similarity scores by the
number of submitted instance predictions in order
to retrieve an average cosine similarity score.

While considering this modified evaluation met-
ric a drawback, dividing the predictions on one hand
into a regression problem but on the other hand into
a classification problem, was noticed. The cosine
similarity (1) for vectors with a length of 1 is result-
ing in either +1 or -1. However, the cosine similarity
for vectors with a length greater than 1 is resulting
in a floating point value. Thus, another modifica-
tion of the initial evaluation formula has been con-
ducted.

6.2 Second Modification

The second modification of the initial evaluation
metric is also using one vector per instance con-
taining one score per corresponding entity. Those
instance vectors are populated into either a gold
standard (GS) or predicted system (PS) vector. As
both vectors are populated according to matching
instances and entities, both vectors should be the
same length. In contrast to the first modification
(6.1), the second modification is using two different
methods of evaluating the given scores dependent
on the length of a vector. For each instance vector
in GS/PS which has a length of 1, the absolute dis-
tance between both scores (4) is added to the total
similarity score (6).

s similarity(G,P ) = 1− |G0 − P0| (4)

Figure 8: Tools used by systems in both tracks

For each instance vector with a length greater than
1, the cosine similarity is ”length times” added to
the total similarity score (5).

m similarity(G,P ) = |P | × cosine(G,P ) (5)

total similarity(GS,PS) =
|PS|∑
i=1

{
|PSi| = 1 s similarity(GSi, PSi)
|PSi| > 1 m similarity(GSi, PSi)

(6)

Once the similarity scores are calculated for each
instance vector and added to the total similarity, the
final score is calculated by dividing the total simi-
larity score by the number of predicted entities to
then multiply the quotient with a weight which con-
sists of the quotient of all predicted entities divided
by all possible entity predictions (7). In contrast to
the cosine weight as stated in (2), this weight is cal-
culated on an entity level.

final score(GS,PS) =
|PS|∑
i=1
|PSi|

|GS|∑
i=1
|GSi|

× total similarity(GS,PS)|PS|∑
i=1
|PSi|

(7)

Similarity scores produced using this alternative
evaluation metric can be found in the appendix A.

6.3 Pros and Cons
On one hand, the evaluation metric as stated in 6.2
differentiating between vectors according to their
lengths avoids the regression/classification problem

as described in 6.1. In addition, it is considering
the link between instances and entities in the final
score.

On the other hand, one disadvantage of this is
approach is the linearity / non-linearity of the two
sub-methods used ((4), (5)). One could argue that
both sub-methods are not equally impacting the to-
tal score. Balancing would be one approach to re-
ducing discrepancy but also be subjectively influ-
enced.

7 Related Initiatives

A number of projects have addressed questions per-
taining to Sentiment Analysis and Finance. The
FIRST (2010-2013) FP7 European project 28 pro-
vides sentiment extraction and analysis of market
participants from social media networks in near
real-time, for detecting and predicting financial
market events, such as insights about financial mar-
ket movements and financial market abuse. The de-
veloped tool consists of a decision support model
based on Web sentiment as found within textual
data extracted from Twitter or blogs, for the finan-
cial domain.

The TrendMiner (2011-2014) FP7 European
project 29, presents an innovative and portable open-
source real-time method for cross-lingual min-
ing and summarisation of large-scale social media
streams, such as weblogs, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
One high profile case study was a financial deci-
sion support (with analysts, traders, regulators and
economists).

StockWatcher (Micu et al., 2008) provides a cus-
tomised, aggregated view of news categorised by
different topics, where it performs sentiment anal-
ysis - positive, negative or neutral effect - on par-
ticular news messages about a particular company.
This tool enables the extraction of relevant news
items from RSS feeds concerning the NASDAQ-
100 listed companies. The sentiment of the news
messages directly affects a company’s respective
stock price.

Mirowski et al. (Mirowski et al., 2010) present
an algorithm for topic modelling, text classification
and retrieval from time-stamped documents. This
algorithm has been applied to predict the stock mar-
ket volatility using financial news from Bloomberg.
The volatility considered is estimated from daily
stock prices of a particular company.

Several data sets have been created which are
relevant in the context of our current endeavour.
(Sanders, 2011) provide the Sanders Twitter Sen-
timent corpus, consisting of 5513 tweets about four
topics/companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twit-
ter). One annotator manually assigned a positive,
negative, neutral or irrelevant annotation to each
tweet, depending on the sentiment expressed to-
wards the given topic (company). This can refer
to any aspect of the company, e.g. the service at
the Apple store or the features of the iPhone in the
case of Apple Inc. The current proposal will in-
stead focus on a much larger range of companies
and evaluate them specifically with respect to their
stock market value. Furthermore, sentiment scor-
ing will be more fine-grained as it will consist of
floating-point numbers in the range of -1 (very neg-
ative/bearish) and 1 (very positive/bullish), with 0
representing neutral sentiment.

(Malo et al., 2014b) present the Financial Phrase
Bank, a resource containing around 5000 sen-
tences from English-language news about compa-
nies listed on the Helsinki stock exchange. Annota-
tions at the level of syntactic phrases assigned one
of three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neu-
tral), based on the expected influence on the stock
price. Each phrase was scored by between five and
eight annotators. In our proposed task, the senti-
ment was also assigned with a view to the stock
price or market development. However, our annota-
tion is more fine-grained, ranging on a scale from -1
to 1. Furthermore, we annotate at the target (stock
or company entity) rather than the phrase-level.

Over the years, many shared tasks in SemEval
have focused on Sentiment Analysis, exploring var-

ious angles within the field. A series of tasks
have concentrated on Sentiment Analysis in Twit-
ter (Nakov et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2014;
Rosenthal and Stoyanov, 2015). They have covered
tasks such as Polarity Disambiguation, document-
and topic-level Polarity Classification, and topic-
based Sentiment Aggregation. These tasks targeted
open domains, with topics being determined us-
ing Named Entity Recognition (e.g. celebrities,
places, sports clubs). The sentiment was assigned
on two-point (positive, negative), three-point (posi-
tive, negative, neutral) or five-point (strongly pos-
itive, weakly positive, neutral, weakly negative,
strongly negative) scales. In contrast, our proposed
task aims to detect fine-grained sentiment, a scoring
company- and stock-level sentiment on a floating
point scale between -1 and 1. Furthermore, the data
in our proposed task focuses only on the financial
domain and its particular semantic challenges.

Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis has also
emerged in recent editions of SemEval (Pontiki
et al., 2014, 2015). Depending on the subtask,
entities and their aspects are provided to the
participants or need to be identified. Sentiment
for entity-aspect pairs is scored according to four
categories: positive, negative, neutral and conflict.
In terms of data, while the 2014 task focused on
isolated sentences from customer reviews, the 2015
edition dealt with full reviews. Again, our proposed
task differs in the assignment of fine-grained
sentiment, in the short nature of the text instances
and in terms of the domain.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a new task on fine-grained sentiment
analysis for the financial domain, where a senti-
ment in range (-1, 1) is assigned to entities. In
our two subtasks, we focussed on two distinct data
sources: financial microblogs (Twitter and Stock-
Twits), where the target entities are company stock
symbols (“cashtags”), and financial news headlines,
where sentiment needs to be assigned to companies.

Deep Learning (word embeddings) and more tra-
ditional Machine Learning techniques account for
the majority of contributions. Many participants
made use of sentiment lexica, both finance-specific
(e.g. the word lists from (Loughran and McDon-
ald, 2011b)) and general domain (e.g. (Hu and Liu,
2004; Wilson et al., 2009)), as well as custom lexica
created in the context of this task. A review of the
results obtained by participants shows that three of
the systems that performed best (top three in each

532



track) adopted a Hybrid (Deep Learning, Lexicon)
technique, while the other three used a Machine
Learning-based approach.

For a future edition of this task, we will focus on
enhancing the evaluation metric in the light of the
discussion in Section 6. It would be interesting to
add subtasks with different sources, perhaps broad-
ening the scope to include longer texts, such as full
news articles from financial newspapers, or Face-
book posts.
