Abstract

The identification of light verb construc-
tions (LVC) is an important task for sev-
eral applications. Previous studies focused
on some limited set of light verb construc-
tions. Here, we address the full coverage
of LVCs. We investigate the performance
of different candidate extraction methods
on two English full-coverage LVC anno-
tated corpora, where we found that less se-
vere candidate extraction methods should
be applied. Then we follow a machine
learning approach that makes use of an ex-
tended and rich feature set to select LVCs
among extracted candidates.

1 Introduction

A multiword expression (MWE) is a lexical unit
that consists of more than one orthographical
word, i.e. a lexical unit that contains spaces and
displays lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic
and/or statistical idiosyncrasy (Sag et al., 2002;
Calzolari et al., 2002). Light verb constructions
(LVCs) (e.g. to take a decision, to take sg into
consideration) form a subtype of MWEs, namely,
they consist of a nominal and a verbal compo-
nent where the verb functions as the syntactic head
(the whole construction fulfills the role of a verb
in the clause), but the semantic head is the noun
(i.e. the noun is used in one of its original senses).
The verbal component (also called a light verb)
usually loses its original sense to some extent.1

The meaning of LVCs can only partially be com-
puted on the basis of the meanings of their parts
and the way they are related to each other (semi-
compositionality). Thus, the result of translating
their parts literally can hardly be considered as

1Light verbs may also be defined as semantically empty
support verbs, which share their arguments with a noun (see
the NomBank project (Meyers et al., 2004)), that is, the term
support verb is a hypernym of light verb.

the proper translation of the original expression.
Moreover, the same syntactic pattern may belong
to a LVC (e.g. make a mistake), a literal verb +
noun combination (e.g. make a cake) or an idiom
(e.g. make a meal (of something)), which suggests
that their identification cannot be based on solely
syntactic patterns. Since the syntactic and the se-
mantic head of the construction are not the same,
they require special treatment when parsing. On
the other hand, the same construction may func-
tion as an LVC in certain contexts while it is just
a productive construction in other ones, compare
He gave her a ring made of gold (non-LVC) and
He gave her a ring because he wanted to hear her
voice (LVC).

In several natural language processing (NLP)
applications like information extraction and re-
trieval, terminology extraction and machine trans-
lation, it is important to identify LVCs in con-
text. For example, in machine translation we must
know that LVCs form one semantic unit, hence
their parts should not be translated separately. For
this, LVCs should be identified first in the text to
be translated.

As we shall show in Section 2, there has been
a considerable amount of previous work on LVC
detection, but some authors seek to capture just
verb–object pairs, while others just verbs with
prepositional complements. Actually, many of
them exploited only constructions formed with a
limited set of light verbs and identified or ex-
tracted just a specific type of LVCs. However,
we cannot see any benefit that any NLP appli-
cation could get from these limitations and here,
we focus on the full-coverage identification of
LVCs. We train and evaluate statistical models
on the Wiki50 (Vincze et al., 2011) and Szeged-
ParalellFX (SZPFX) (Vincze, 2012) corpora that
have recently been published with full-coverage
LVC annotation.

We employ a two-stage procedure. First,

we identify potential LVC candidates in running
texts – we empirically compare various candi-
date extraction methods –, then we use a machine
learning-based classifier that exploits a rich fea-
ture set to select LVCs from the candidates.

The main contributions of this paper can be
summarized as follows:

• We introduce and evaluate systems for iden-
tifying all LVCs and all individual LVC oc-
currences in a running text and we do not
restrict ourselves to certain specific types of
LVCs.

• We systematically compare and evaluate
different candidate extraction methods
(earlier published methods and new solutions
implemented by us).

• We defined and evaluated several new fea-
ture templates like semantic or morpholog-
ical features to select LVCs in context from
extracted candidates.

2 Related Work

Two approaches have been introduced for LVC
detection. In the first approach, LVC candidates
(usually verb-object pairs including one verb from
a well-defined set of 3-10 verbs) are extracted
from the corpora and these tokens – without con-
textual information – are then classified as LVCs
or not (Stevenson et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2006;
Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Van de Cruys and
Moirón, 2007; Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2011). As
a gold standard, lists collected from dictionaries or
other annotated corpora are used: if the extracted
candidate is classified as an LVC and can be found
on the list, it is a true positive, regardless of the
fact whether it was a genuine LVC in its context.

In the second approach, the goal is to detect in-
dividual LVC token instances in a running text,
taking contextual information into account (Diab
and Bhutada, 2009; Tu and Roth, 2011; Nagy T.
et al., 2011). While the first approach assumes
that a specific candidate in all of its occurrences
constitutes an LVC or not (i.e. there are no am-
biguous cases), the second one may account for
the fact that there are contexts where a given can-
didate functions as an LVC whereas in other con-
texts it does not, recall the example of give a ring
in Section 1.

The authors of Stevenson et al. (2004), Fazly
and Stevenson (2007), Van de Cruys and Moirón

(2007) and Gurrutxaga and Alegria (2011) built
LVC detection systems with statistical features.
Stevenson et al. (2004) focused on classifying
LVC candidates containing the verbs make and
take. Fazly and Stevenson (2007) used linguisti-
cally motivated statistical measures to distinguish
subtypes of verb + noun combinations. How-
ever, it is a challenging task to identify rare LVCs
in corpus data with statistical-based approaches,
since 87% of LVCs occur less than 3 times in the
two full-coverage LVC annotated corpora used for
evaluation (see Section 3).

A semantic-based method was described in
Van de Cruys and Moirón (2007) for identify-
ing verb-preposition-noun combinations in Dutch.
Their method relies on selectional preferences
for both the noun and the verb. Idiomatic and
light verb noun + verb combinations were ex-
tracted from Basque texts by employing statisti-
cal methods (Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2011). Diab
and Bhutada (2009) and Nagy T. et al. (2011)
employed ruled-based methods to detect LVCs,
which are usually based on (shallow) linguistic
information, while the domain specificity of the
problem was highlighted in Nagy T. et al. (2011).

Both statistical and linguistic information were
applied by the hybrid LVC systems (Tan et al.,
2006; Tu and Roth, 2011; Samardžić and Merlo,
2010), which resulted in better recall scores. En-
glish and German LVCs were analysed in paral-
lel corpora: the authors of Samardžić and Merlo
(2010) focus on their manual and automatic align-
ment. They found that linguistic features (e.g. the
degree of compositionality) and the frequency of
the construction both have an impact on the align-
ment of the constructions.

Tan et al. (2006) applied machine learning tech-
niques to extract LVCs. They combined statisti-
cal and linguistic features, and trained a random
forest classifier to separate LVC candidates. Tu
and Roth (2011) applied Support Vector Machines
to classify verb + noun object pairs on their bal-
anced dataset as candidates for true LVCs2 or not.
They compared the contextual and statistical fea-
tures and found that local contextual features per-
formed better on ambiguous examples.

2In theoretical linguistics, two types of LVCs are distin-
guished (Kearns, 2002). In true LVCs such as to have a laugh
we can find a noun that is a conversive of a verb (i.e. it can
be used as a verb without any morphological change), while
in vague action verbs such as to make an agreement there is a
noun derived from a verb (i.e. there is morphological change).

Some of the earlier studies aimed at identifying
or extracting only a restricted set of LVCs. Most
of them focus on verb-object pairs when identi-
fying LVCs (Stevenson et al., 2004; Tan et al.,
2006; Fazly and Stevenson, 2007; Cook et al.,
2007; Bannard, 2007; Tu and Roth, 2011), thus
they concentrate on structures like give a deci-
sion or take control. With languages other than
English, authors often select verb + prepositional
object pairs (instead of verb-object pairs) and cat-
egorise them as LVCs or not. See, e.g. Van de
Cruys and Moirón (2007) for Dutch LVC detec-
tion or Krenn (2008) for German LVC detection.
In other cases, only true LVCs were considered
(Stevenson et al., 2004; Tu and Roth, 2011). In
some other studies (Cook et al., 2007; Diab and
Bhutada, 2009) the authors just distinguished be-
tween the literal and idiomatic uses of verb + noun
combinations and LVCs were classified into these
two categories as well.

In contrast to previous works, we seek to iden-
tify all LVCs in running texts and do not re-
strict ourselves to certain types of LVCs. For
this reason, we experiment with different candi-
date extraction methods and we present a machine
learning-based approach to select LVCs among
candidates.

3 Datasets

In our experiments, three freely available corpora
were used. Two of them had fully-covered LVC
sets manually annotated by professional linguists.
The annotation guidelines did not contain any re-
strictions on the inner syntactic structure of the
construction and both true LVCs and vague ac-
tion verbs were annotated. The Wiki50 (Vincze et
al., 2011) contains 50 English Wikipedia articles
that were annotated for different types of MWEs
(including LVCs) and Named Entities. SZPFX
(Vincze, 2012) is an English–Hungarian parallel
corpus, in which LVCs are annotated in both lan-
guages. It contains texts taken from several do-
mains like fiction, language books and magazines.
Here, the English part of the corpus was used.

In order to compare the performance of our sys-
tem with others, we also used the dataset of Tu
and Roth (2011), which contains 2,162 sentences
taken from different parts of the British National
Corpus. They only focused on true LVCs in this
dataset, and only the verb-object pairs (1,039 posi-
tive and 1,123 negative examples) formed with the

verbs do, get, give, have, make, take were marked.
Statistical data on the three corpora are listed in
Table 1.

Tu&Roth 2,162 65,060 1,039 430

Table 1: Statistical data on LVCs in the Wiki50
and SZPFX corpora and the Tu&Roth dataset.

Despite the fact that English verb + preposi-
tional constructions were mostly neglected in pre-
vious research, both corpora contain several ex-
amples of such structures, e.g. take into consider-
ation or come into contact, the ratio of such LVC
lemmas being 11.8% and 9.6% in the Wiki50 and
SZPFX corpora, respectively. In addition to the
verb + object or verb + prepositional object con-
structions, there are several other syntactic con-
structions in which LVCs can occur due to their
syntactic flexibility. For instance, the nominal
component can become the subject in a passive
sentence (the photo has been taken), or it can be
extended by a relative clause (the photo that has
been taken). These cases are responsible for 7.6%
and 19.4% of the LVC occurrences in the Wiki50
and SZPFX corpora, respectively. These types
cannot be identified when only verb + object pairs
are used for LVC candidate selection.

Some researchers filtered LVC candidates by
selecting only certain verbs that may be part of
the construction, e.g. Tu and Roth (2011). As
the full-coverage annotated corpora were avail-
able, we were able to check what percentage of
LVCs could be covered with this selection. The
six verbs used by Tu and Roth (2011) are respon-
sible for about 49% and 63% of all LVCs in the
Wiki50 and the SZPFX corpora, respectively. Fur-
thermore, 62 different light verbs occurred in the
Wiki50 and 102 in the SZPFX corpora, respec-
tively. All this indicates that focusing on a reduced
set of light verbs will lead to the exclusion of a
considerable number of LVCs in free texts.

Some papers focus only on the identification of
true LVCs, neglecting vague action verbs (Steven-
son et al., 2004; Tu and Roth, 2011). However,
we cannot see any NLP application that can bene-
fit if such a distinction is made since vague action
verbs and true LVCs share those properties that are
relevant for natural language processing (e.g. they
must be treated as one complex predicate (Vincze,

331



2012)). We also argue that it is important to sep-
arate LVCs and idioms because LVCs are semi-
productive and semi-compositional – which may
be exploited in applications like machine transla-
tion or information extraction – in contrast to id-
ioms, which have neither feature. All in all, we
seek to identify all verbal LVCs (not including id-
ioms) in our study and do not restrict ourselves to
certain specific types of LVCs.

4 LVC Detection

Our goal is to identify each LVC occurrence in
running texts, i.e. to take input sentences such as
’We often have lunch in this restaurant’ and mark
each LVC in it. Our basic approach is to syntac-
tically parse each sentence and extract potential
LVCs with different candidate extraction methods.
Afterwards, a binary classification can be used to
automatically classify potential LVCs as LVCs or
not. For the automatic classification of candidate
LVCs, we implemented a machine learning ap-
proach, which is based on a rich feature set.

4.1 Candidate Extraction

As we had two full-coverage LVC annotated cor-
pora where each type and individual occurrence
of a LVC was marked in running texts, we were
able to examine the characteristics of LVCs in a
running text, and evaluate and compare the differ-
ent candidate extraction methods. When we ex-
amined the previously used methods, which just
treated the verb-object pairs as potential LVCs, it
was revealed that only 73.91% of annotated LVCs
on the Wiki50 and 70.61% on the SZPFX had a
verb-object syntactic relation. Table 2 shows the
distribution of dependency label types provided by
the Bohnet parser (Bohnet, 2010) for the Wiki50
and Stanford (Klein and Manning, 2003) and the
Bohnet parsers for the SZPFX corpora. In or-
der to compare the efficiency of the parsers, both
were applied using the same dependency represen-
tation. In this phase, we found that the Bohnet
parser was more successful on the SZPFX cor-
pora, i.e. it could cover more LVCs, hence we ap-
plied the Bohnet parser in our further experiments.

We define the extended syntax-based can-
didate extraction method, where besides the
verb-direct object dependency relation, the
verb-prepositional, verb-relative clause, noun-
participial modifier and verb-subject of a passive
construction syntactic relations were also investi-

gated among verbs and nouns. Here, 90.76% of
LVCs in the Wiki50 and 87.75% in the SZPFX
corpus could be identified with the extended
syntax-based candidate extraction method.

It should be added that some rare examples of
split LVCs where the nominal component is part
of the object, preceded by a quantifying expres-
sion like he gained much of his fame can hardly
be identified by syntax-based methods since there
is no direct link between the verb and the noun.
In other cases, the omission of LVCs from candi-
dates is due to the rare and atypical syntactic re-
lation between the noun and the verb (e.g. dep in
reach conform). Despite this, such cases are also
included in the training and evaluation datasets as
positive examples.

Our second candidate extractor is the
morphology-based candidate extraction
method (Nagy T. et al., 2011), which was also
applied for extracting potential LVCs. In this
case, a token sequence was treated as a potential
LVC if the POS-tag sequence matched one pattern
typical of LVCs (e.g. VERB-NOUN). Although
this method was less effective than the extended
syntax-based approach, when we merged the
extended syntax-based and morphology-based
methods, we were able to identify most of the
LVCs in the two corpora.

The authors of Stevenson et al. (2004) and Tu
and Roth (2011) filtered LVC candidates by se-
lecting only certain verbs that could be part of the
construction, so we checked what percentage of
LVCs could be covered with this selection when
we treated just the verb-object pairs as LVC candi-
dates. We found that even the least stringent selec-

332



tion covered only 41.88% of the LVCs in Wiki50
and 47.84% in SZPFX. Hence, we decided to drop
any such constraint.

Table 3 shows the results we obtained by apply-
ing the different candidate extraction methods on
the Wiki50 and SZPFX corpora.

4.2 Machine Learning Based Candidate
Classification

For the automatic classification of the candidate
LVCs we implemented a machine learning ap-
proach, which we will elaborate upon below. Our
method is based on a rich feature set with the fol-
lowing categories: statistical, lexical, morphologi-
cal, syntactic, orthographic and semantic.

Statistical features: Potential LVCs were col-
lected from 10,000 Wikipedia pages by the union
of the morphology-based candidate extraction and
the extended syntax-based candidate extraction
methods. The number of their occurrences was
used as a feature in case the candidate was one of
the syntactic phrases collected.

Lexical features: We exploit the fact that the
most common verbs are typically light verbs, so
we selected fifteen typical light verbs from the list
of the most frequent verbs taken from the corpora.
In this case, we investigated whether the lemma-
tised verbal component of the candidate was one
of these fifteen verbs. The lemma of the head
of the noun was also applied as a lexical fea-
ture. The nouns found in LVCs were collected
from the corpora, and for each corpus the noun
list got from the union of the other two corpora
was used. Moreover, we constructed lists of lem-
matised LVCs from the corpora and for each cor-
pus, the list got from the union of the other two
corpora was utilised. In the case of the Tu&Roth
dataset, the list got from Wiki50 and SZPFX was

filtered for the six light verbs and true LVCs they
contained.

Morphological features: The POS candidate
extraction method was used as a feature, so when
the POS-tag sequence in the text matched one typ-
ical ‘POS-pattern’ of LVCs, the candidate was
marked as true; otherwise as false. The ‘Verbal-
Stem’ binary feature focuses on the stem of the
noun. For LVCs, the nominal component is typi-
cally one that is derived from a verbal stem (make
a decision) or coincides with a verb (have a walk).
In this case, the phrases were marked as true if
the stem of the nominal component had a verbal
nature, i.e. it coincided with a stem of a verb. Do
and have are often light verbs, but these verbs may
occur as auxiliary verbs too. Hence we defined a
feature for the two verbs to denote whether or not
they were auxiliary verbs in a given sentence.

Syntactic features: The dependency label be-
tween the noun and the verb can also be exploited
in identifying LVCs. As we typically found in
the candidate extraction, the syntactic relation be-
tween the verb and the nominal component in
an LVC is dobj, pobj, rcmod, partmod or
nsubjpass – using the Bohnet parser (Bohnet,
2010), hence these relations were defined as fea-
tures. The determiner within all candidate LVCs
was also encoded as another syntactic feature.

Orthographic features: in the case of the ‘suf-
fix’ feature, it was checked whether the lemma of
the noun ended in a given character bi- or trigram.
It exploits the fact that many nominal components
in LVCs are derived from verbs. The ‘number of
words’ of the candidate LVC was also noted and
applied as a feature.

Semantic features: In this case we also ex-
ploited the fact that the nominal component is de-
rived from verbs. Activity or event semantic
senses were looked for among the hypernyms of
the noun in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).

We experimented with several learning algo-
rithms and our preliminary results showed that de-
cision trees performed the best. This is probably
due to the fact that our feature set consists of a few
compact – i.e. high-level – features. We trained
the J48 classifier of the WEKA package (Hall et
al., 2009), which implements the decision trees
algorithm C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) with the above-
mentioned feature set. We report results with Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) as well, to compare our methods with Tu &

Roth.
As the investigated corpora were not sufficiently

big for splitting them into training and test sets
of appropriate size, besides, the different annota-
tion principles ruled out the possibility of enlarg-
ing the training sets with another corpus, we eval-
uated our models in 10-fold cross validation man-
ner on the Wiki50, SZPFX and Tu&Roth datasets.
But, in the case of Wiki50 and SZPFX, where only
the positive LVCs were annotated, we employed
Fβ=1 scores interpreted on the positive class as an
evaluation metric. Moreover, we treated all po-
tential LVCs as negative which were extracted by
different extraction methods but were not marked
as positive in the gold standard. The resulting
datasets were not balanced and the number of neg-
ative examples basically depended on the candi-
date extraction method applied.

However, some positive elements in the corpora
were not covered in the candidate classification
step, since the candidate extraction methods ap-
plied could not detect all LVCs in the corpus data.
Hence, we treated the omitted LVCs as false neg-
atives in our evaluation.

5 Experiments and Results

As a baseline, we applied a context-free dictionary
matching method. First, we gathered the gold-
standard LVC lemmas from the two other corpora.
Then we marked candidates of the union of the ex-
tended syntax-based and morphology-based meth-
ods as LVC if the candidate light verb and one of
its syntactic dependents was found on the list.

Table 4 lists the results got on the Wiki50 and
SZPFX corpora by using the baseline dictionary
matching and our machine learning approach with
different machine learning algorithm and differ-
ent candidate extraction methods.The dictionary
matching approach got the highest precision on
SZPFX, namely 72.65%. Our machine learning-
based approach with different candidate extraction

methods demonstrated a consistent performance
(i.e. an F-score over 50) on the Wiki50 and SZPFX
corpora. It is also seen that our machine learning
approach with the union of the morphology- and
extended syntax-based candidate extraction meth-
ods is the most successful method in the case of
Wiki50 and SZPFX. On both corpora, it achieved
an F-score that was higher than that of the dictio-
nary matching approach (the difference being 10
and 19 percentage points in the case of Wiki50 and
SZPFX, respectively).

In order to compare the performance of our sys-
tem with others, we evaluated it on the Tu&Roth
dataset (Tu and Roth, 2011) too. Table 5 shows
the results got using dictionary matching, apply-
ing our machine learning-based approach with a
rich feature set, and the results published in Tu
and Roth (2011) on the Tu&Roth dataset. In this
case, the dictionary matching method performed
the worst and achieved an accuracy score of 61.25.
The results published in Tu and Roth (2011) are
good on the positive class with an F-score of 75.36
but the worst with an F-score of 56.41 on the neg-
ative class. Therefore this approach achieved an
accuracy score that was 7.27 higher than that of
the dictionary matching method. Our approach
demonstrates a consistent performance (with an F-
score over 70) on the positive and negative classes.
It is also seen that our approach is the most suc-
cessful in the case of the Tu&Roth dataset: it
achieved an accuracy score of 72.51%, which is
3.99% higher that got by the Tu&Roth method (Tu
and Roth, 2011) (68.52%).

6 Discussion

The applied machine learning-based method ex-
tensively outperformed our dictionary matching
baseline model, which underlines the fact that our
approach can be suitably applied to LVC detec-
tion. As Table 4 shows, our presented method
proved to be the most robust as it could obtain
roughly the same recall, precision and F-score on
the Wiki50 and SZPFX corpora. Our system’s per-
formance primarily depends on the applied candi-
date extraction method. In the case of dictionary
matching, a higher recall score was primarily lim-
ited by the size of the dictionary, but this method
managed to achieve a fairly good precision score.

As Table 5 indicates, the dictionary matching
method was less effective on the Tu&Roth dataset.
Since the corpus was created by collecting sen-
tences that contain verb-object pairs with spe-
cific verbs, this dataset contains a lot of negative
and ambiguous examples besides annotated LVCs,
hence the distribution of LVCs in the Tu&Roth
dataset is not comparable to those in Wiki50 or
SZPFX. In this dataset, only one positive or nega-
tive example was annotated in each sentence, and
they examined just the verb-object pairs formed
with the six verbs as a potential LVC. However,
the corpus probably contains other LVCs which
were not annotated. For example, in the sentence
it have been held that a gift to a charity of shares
in a close company gave rise to a charge to capi-
tal transfer tax where the company had an inter-
est in possession in a trust, the phrase give rise
was listed as a negative example in the Tu&Roth
dataset, but have an interest, which is another
LVC, was not marked either positive or negative.
This is problematic if we would like to evalu-
ate our candidate extractor on this dataset since it
would identify this phrase, even if it is restricted
to verb-object pairs containing one of the six verbs
mentioned above, thus yielding false positives al-
ready in the candidate extraction phase.

Moreover, the results got with our machine
learning approach overperformed those reported
in Tu and Roth (2011). This may be attributed to
the inclusion of a rich feature set with new features
like semantic or morphological features that was
used in our system, which demonstrated a con-
sistent performance on the positive and negative
classes too.

To examine the effectiveness of each individual
feature of the machine learning based candidate

classification, we carried out an ablation analysis.
Table 6 shows the usefulness of each individual
feature type on the SZPFX corpus.

terms of precision, recall and F-score using the
SZPFX corpus.

For each feature type, we trained a J48 classi-
fier with all of the features except that one. We
then compared the performance to that got with
all the features. As our ablation analysis shows,
each type of feature contributed to the overall per-
formance. The most important feature is the list
of the most frequent light verbs. The most com-
mon verbs in a language are used very frequently
in different contexts, with several argument struc-
tures and this may lead to the bleaching (or at least
generalization) of its semantic content (Altmann,
2005). From this perspective, it is linguistically
plausible that the most frequent verbs in a lan-
guage largely coincide with the most typical light
verbs since light verbs lose their original meaning
to some extent (see e.g. Sanromán Vilas (2009)).

Besides the ablation analysis we also investi-
gated the decision tree model yielded by our ex-
periments. Similar to the results of our ablation
analysis we found that the lexical features were the
most powerful, the semantic, syntactic and ortho-
graphical features were also useful while statisti-
cal and morphological features were less effective
but were still exploited by the model.

Comparing the results on the three corpora, it
is salient that the F-score got from applying the
methods on the Tu&Roth dataset was consider-
ably better than those got on the other two corpora.
This can be explained if we recall that this dataset
applies a restricted definition of LVCs, works with
only verb-object pairs and, furthermore, it con-
tains constructions with only six light verbs. How-
ever, Wiki50 and SZPFX contain all LVCs, they
include verb + preposition + noun combinations as
well, and they are not restricted to six verbs. All
these characteristics demonstrate that identifying
LVCs in the latter two corpora is a more realistic

335



and challenging task than identifying them in the
artificial Tu&Roth dataset. For example, the very
frequent and important LVCs like make a decision,
which was one of the most frequent LVCs in the
two full-coverage LVC annotated corpora, are ig-
nored if we only focus on identifying true LVCs.
It could be detrimental when a higher level NLP
application exploits the LVC detector.

We also carried out a manual error analysis on
the data. We found that in the candidate extrac-
tion step, it is primarily POS-tagging or parsing
errors that result in the omission of certain LVC
candidates. In other cases, the dependency rela-
tion between the nominal and verbal component is
missing (recall the example of objects with quan-
tifiers) or it is an atypical one (e.g. dep) not in-
cluded in our list. The lower recall in the case
of SZPFX can be attributed to the fact that this
corpus contains more instances of nominal occur-
rences of LVCs (e.g. decision-making or record
holder) than Wiki50, which were annotated in
the corpora but our morphology-based and ex-
tended syntax-based methods were not specifically
trained for them since adding POS-patterns like
NOUN-NOUN or the corresponding syntactic rela-
tions would have resulted in the unnecessary in-
clusion of many nominal compounds.

As for the errors made during classification, it
seems that it was hard for the classifier to label
longer constructions properly. It was especially
true when the LVC occurred in a non-canonical
form, as in a relative clause (counterargument that
can be made). Constructions with atypical light
verbs (e.g. cast a glance) were also somewhat
more difficult to find. Nevertheless, some false
positives were due to annotation errors in the cor-
pora. A further source of errors was that some lit-
eral and productive structures like to give a book
(to someone) – which contains one of the most
typical light verbs and the noun is homonymous
with the verb book “to reserve” – are very diffi-
cult to distinguish from LVCs and were in turn
marked as LVCs. Moreover, the classification of
idioms with a syntactic or morphological struc-
ture similar to typical LVCs – to have a crush
on someone “to be fond of someone”, which con-
sists of a typical light verb and a deverbal noun –
was also not straightforward. In other cases, verb-
particle combinations followed by a noun were la-
beled as LVCs such as make up his mind or give in
his notice. Since Wiki50 contains annotated ex-

amples for both types of MWEs, the classifica-
tion of verb + particle/preposition + noun com-
binations as verb-particle combinations, LVCs or
simple verb + prepositional phrase combinations
could be a possible direction for future work.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced a system that enables
the full coverage identification of English LVCs
in running texts. Our method detected a broader
range of LVCs than previous studies which fo-
cused only on certain subtypes of LVCs. We
solved the problem in a two-step approach. In the
first step, we extracted potential LVCs from a run-
ning text and we applied a machine learning-based
approach that made use of a rich feature set to
classify extracted syntactic phrases in the second
step. Moreover, we investigated the performance
of different candidate extraction methods in the
first step on the two available full-coverage LVC
annotated corpora, and we found that owing to the
overly strict candidate extraction methods applied,
the majority of the LVCs were overlooked. Our
results show that a full-coverage identification of
LVCs is challenging, but our approach can achieve
promising results. The tool can be used in prepro-
cessing steps for e.g. information extraction ap-
plications or machine translation systems, where
it is necessary to locate lexical items that require
special treatment.

In the future, we would like to improve our sys-
tem by conducting a detailed analysis of the ef-
fect of the features included. Later, we also plan
to investigate how our LVC identification system
helps higher level NLP applications. Moreover,
we would like to adapt our system to identify other
types of MWE and experiment with LVC detection
in other languages as well.
