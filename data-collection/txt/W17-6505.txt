Abstract

In this paper we present a cross-genre
study on word order variation in Ital-
ian based on automatically dependency–
parsed corpora. A comparative analysis
focused on dependency direction and de-
pendency distance for major constituents
in the sentence is carried out in order to as-
sess the influence of both textual genre and
linguistic complexity on the distribution of
phenonemena of syntactic markedeness.

1 Introduction

It is almost impossible to classify languages ac-
cording to a unique, universally valid, metric of
complexity. However, scholars agree on a set of
properties that, at different levels of linguistic de-
scription, can be viewed as “universal” parame-
ters of complexity across languages (McWorther,
2001; Ferguson, 1982). At syntactic level, this is
the case e.g. of word order freedom, i.e. the prop-
erty for which the order of elements in a sentence
can vary while conveying the same meaning. Ac-
cording to different perspectives, free–word order
languages are considered as more complex than
fixed–order languages.

In linguistic and psycholinguistic literature,
several explanations have been given to account
for word order freedom. Information structure the-
ory assumes that the order of words in the sentence
is determined by semantic and discourse prag-
matic forces (Diessel, 2005); conversely, for per-
formance–related accounts unmarked structures
are generally preferred by the speaker because of
efficiency pressures and information structure be-
comes relevant only if two or more alternative
orders are equally difficult to process (Hawkins,
1994; Gibson, 1998; Gibson, 2000).

Also from a Natural Language Processing
(NLP) perspective, it is acknowledged that pars-

ing free–word order languages is more challeng-
ing than parsing fixed–order languages in many re-
spects. Based on a comparative analysis of Latin
and Ancient Greek treebanks, the study of Gu-
lordava and Merlo (2015) e.g. demonstrated that
word order freedom, defined as the distance be-
tween the actual dependency length of a sentence
and its optimal dependency, is a source of com-
plexity which can be inferred both from lower
parsing performance and from a trend toward
more fixed word orders over time. Comparing the
accuracy of dependency parsing on dative alterna-
tions in English, German and Russian, Dakota et
al. (2015) showed that the larger the number of
possible alternative orders to parse the more train-
ing data is needed. The effect of data sparness
on the automatic analysis of free word order lan-
guage was also assessed in the study of Alicante et
al. (2012) aimed at comparing the performance of
constituency and dependency parsing on an Italian
treebank.

In this paper we want to focus the attention on
word order variation from a less–investigated per-
spective, aimed at assessing the influence of tex-
tual genre and linguistic complexity on the preser-
vation of the basic (or unmarked) position of ma-
jor constituents in the sentence, i.e. subject, ob-
ject, adjective, adverb and subordinate clause. To
this end, we carried out a corpus-based study for
Italian – a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language
– comparing the distribution of head–initial and
head–final syntactic pairs across different textual
genres and different language varieties, i.e. a
“complex” one and a “simple” one for each genre,
defined according to the expected target reader.

Differently from more traditional studies on
word order variation in Italian e.g. (Fiorentino,
2009), this work relied on corpora automatically
parsed up to the level of syntactic dependency an-
notation; this allowed us to carry out a broad com-
parative analysis of fine–grained features related

to word order variation according to genre and
linguistic complexity, such us the average linear
distance between the dependent and its head and
the average depth of the syntactic tree of the de-
pendent element, both in the canonical and non–
canonical position.

2 Related Works

Syntactically annotated corpora have been pro-
moted by several scholars as a valuable resource in
the study of word order variation and related prop-
erties, especially from the perspective of language
typology.

By relying on dependency direction as a typo-
logical index, Liu (2010) quantified the distribu-
tion of right- and left-branching constructions in
20 languages. Not only this study supported tra-
ditional typological classes with large quantitative
data, but also provided evidence that a dominant
order exists for languages left unspecified with re-
spect to some grammatical relations (e.g. verb-
object) in well-established classifications (Haspel-
math et al., 2005). A similar methodology has
been applied by (Liu, 2010), who conducted a
comparative study based on 15 treebanks demon-
strating that dependency direction is a reliable in-
dex to explain both the syntactic drift from Latin
to Romance languages and to classify Romance
languages as a distinct sub–group from other lan-
guages. In Futrell et al. (2015) a large cross–
linguistic analysis was carried out using depen-
dency treebanks for more than 30 languages; the
comparative study allowed the authors to confirm
the correlation between high order freedom and
overt case–marking.

Word order variation is generally investigated
together with the effect it has on dependency dis-
tance, i.e. the distance between words and their
parents, typically measured in terms of interven-
ing words. With this respect, data from depen-
dency annotated corpora highlight that, when two
or more alternative orders are possible, languages
tend to prefer the order that reduces the distance
between the head and its dependent (Gildea and
Temperley, 2010; Futrell et al., 2015); this also
holds when the examined span affects only few
words, such as in the nominal domain (Gulor-
dava et al., 2015). Such findings are thus pro-
posed as a further demonstration that dependency
length minimisation, whose effect has been widely
documented in sentence processing (e.g. (Gibson,

1998; Gibson, 2000)), is a universal principle of
human language.

In this paper, we want to investigate whether
and to what extent word order phenomena in Ital-
ian are also influenced by textual genre. Simi-
larly to the recent work by Liu (2017) for the En-
glish language, we focus on the two main syntac-
tic parameters which, in a syntactic dependency
paradigm, allow quantifying the effects of word
order variation, i.e. dependency direction and de-
pendency distance. The novelty of our study is
that we introduce a further dimension of compar-
ison, i.e. the level of complexity within genre,
which was defined in according to the intended tar-
get reader; this was meant to assess whether some
genre–specific stylistic features exist and how they
affect word order properties independently from
the level of complexity used in text.

In what follows, we first illustrate the corpora
used in our study (Section 3) and the typology of
syntactic patterns on which we focused to investi-
gate word order variation (Section 3.1). In Section
4 we discuss the main findings of the comparative
analyses carried out according to genre and lin-
guistic complexity.

3 Data

As shown in Table 1, four genres were considered
in this study: Journalism, Educational writing,
Scientific prose and Narrative. For each genre, we
collected two corpora, representative of a “com-
plex” and a “simple” language variety for that
genre, which were defined according to the ex-
pected readership.

The journalistic corpus is sub–divided into a
corpus of general newspaper articles, La Repub-
blica (Rep), which is made of all articles pub-
lished between 2000 and 2005 and a corpus of
easy–to–read articles published in Due Parole, a
monthly magazine written by linguists expert in
text simplification using a controlled language for
an audience of adults with a rudimentary literacy
level or mild intellectual disabilities (Piemontese,
1996). The Educational corpus is articulated into
two collections targeting high school (AduEdu) vs
primary school (ChiEdu) students. For scientific
prose, the “complex” variety is represented by a
corpus of ∼470,000 tokens of scientific literature
covering various topics, e.g. climate change, lin-
guistics, while the “simple” variety is represented
by a corpus of Wikipedia articles of ∼200,000 to-

rative texts, we relied on the resource described
in Brunato et al. (2015), which was specifically
developed for the study of automatic text simpli-
fication in Italian. The resource is made up of
two sub–corpora, Terence and Teacher, represen-
tative of two different simplification strategies, the
“structural” and the “intuitive” one respectively.
Both Terence and Teacher contain two versions of
the same text aligned at sentence-level, namely the
authentic version of text and its manually simpli-
fied version targeting specific categories of read-
ers. In particular, Terence comprises 32 short nov-
els and their simplified version addressing hearing
and deaf children, aged between 7–11, affected
by text comprehension difficulties. Teacher is
composed by 24 pairs of original–simplified texts,
where the simplification was mostly carried out by
a teacher for L2 students. To allow comparing the
effect of linguistic complexity within this genre,
we created a unique corpus of “complex” narrative
texts (TT orig) containing only the authentic texts
of both Terence and Teacher and a unique corpus
of “simple” narrative texts (TT simpl), containing
only the simplified versions.

3.1 Automatic Linguistic Analysis and
Linguistic Features

All corpora selected for this study were automat-
ically tagged by the part–of–speech tagger de-
scribed in Dell’Orletta (2009) and dependency–
parsed by the DeSR parser (Attardi et al., 2009)
using Support Vector Machine as learning algo-
rithm. DeSR is trained on the ISST–TANL tree-
bank, which mainly includes articles from news-
papers and periodical, and it achieves a perfor-
mance of 83.38% and 87.71% in terms of LAS and
UAS when tested on matching training data. How-

ever, it is well-known that the accuracy of parsers
decreases when tested against texts of a differ-
ent typology from those used in training (Gildea,
2001). Thus we can assume that the performance
of DeSR will probably be worse in the analysis of
texts representative of e.g. narrative and scientific
writing. Despite this fact, we expect that the dis-
tributions of errors will be almost similar, at least
when parsing texts of the same domain and lan-
guage variety, thus allowing us to carry out a reli-
able internal comparison with respect to the exam-
ined syntactic patterns. In addition, the effect of
genre variation on the performance of a general–
purpose parser is likely to be less strong since all
genres here considered contain standard texts, i.e.
texts linguistically similar to the ones used in train-
ing.

4 Data Analysis

Based on the output of the multi–level linguistic
annotation, all corpora were searched for relevant
syntactic features, i.e. features related to the or-
der and linear distance between the “dependent”
element and its “head” in a syntactic dependency
representation.

Specifically, we focused on the following ele-
ments: subject, object, adjective, adverb and sub-
ordinate clause. For each of them we calculated
i) the percentage distribution in the canonical and
non–canonical position (i.e. the position syntacti-
cally and/or pragmatically marked), according to
the predominant SVO order in Italian, and, for
each position, ii) the linear distance (in terms of
number of tokens) between the element and the
relative head.1

1For what concerns the subordinate clause, the linear dis-
tance is calculated as the average number of tokens between
the POS of the root of the subordinate clause sub-tree and the
verb of the main clause.

(Subj-pre) and postverbal subjects (Subj-post), prenominal (Adj-pre) and postnominal adjectives (Adj-
post) and preverbal (Adv-pre) and postverbal adverbs (Adv-post) across corpora.

We also conducted a more in–depth study on
subordination examining the following features:
iii) the average length (in tokens) of the whole
subordinate clause and iv) the average depth of
the subordinate clause, calculated in terms of the
longest path from the root of the subordinate sub–
tree to some leaf.

Figure 2: Percentage distribution of prever-
bal (Sub–pre) and postverbal subordinate clauses
(Sub–post) across corpora.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 compare the percentage
distribution of all the examined orders across the
corpora. Let’s analyse first the elements which, in
all corpora, tend to occur more in their canonical
position, i.e. the subject and the object.

With respect to the object, we observe that sci-
entific texts adhere the most to the canonical order,
independently from the complexity of text (Scien-
tArt: post–verbal object: 95.14%; WikiArt: post–

verbal object: 96.46%, p<0.05 2).; on the con-
trary, in narrative and especially in educational
texts, the distribution of the unmarked object posi-
tion decreases (AduEdu: 90%; ChiEdu: 89.33%,
p<0.05). Interestingly, with the only exception
of educational texts where the distribution of pre–
verbal objects is almost similar in the two vari-
eties (i.e. 9.99% vs 10.67%), all other genres show
the expected positive correlation between canoni-
cal order and linguistic complexity; this is partic-
ularly evident in the journalistic genre, which re-
ports a statistically significant difference (p<.001)
of more than six percentage points with respect to
the distribution of preverbal objects (Rep: 8.54%;
2Par: 2.57%).

If scientific texts have a more rigid verb–object
structure, they allow longer dependencies when
the object follows the verb compared to all other
genres (see the first two columns of Table 2). Such
a finding is not influenced by the level of linguistic
complexity within genre, since both the complex
and the simple variety obtain almost equal values
(∼ 2.70).

As in the case of the object, also with respect to
the subject, the expected correlation between the
canonical SV order and the use of a simple lan-
guage variety is particularly evident in the jour-
nalistic genre: indeed, texts belonging to Due Pa-
role tend to preserve this order in almost 90% of
cases, that is almost 7% more than their “com-

plex” counterpart (Rep: 82,20%; 2Par: 89,82%;
p<0.01). On the contrary, both in narrative and ed-
ucational texts, post–verbal subjects occur slightly
more in the “simple” than in the “complex” vari-
ety, although the difference is statistically signifi-
cant only for educational texts (AduEdu: 16.25%;
ChiEdu: 17.61%; p<0.05).

For what concerns the narrative genre, it is
worth noticing that the complex variety here ex-
amined is actually simpler than the complex vari-
ety of all the other genres; this is because the origi-
nal texts of both Terence and Teacher are primarily
written for a young readership. However, this find-
ing should be more properly investigated in other
corpora of the same genre because it might sug-
gest that some marked constructions, such as post–
verbal subjects, are genre–specific features allow-
ing the writer to preserve the thematic progression
in adjacent sentences and improve text cohesion.
In this sense, such features are also maintained in
the simplification process.

For what concerns educational materials, this is
a heterogeneous genre comprising texts belonging
in principle to different genres, ranging e.g. from
fiction to scientific writing or reportage, thus mak-
ing it difficult to detect the effect of language com-
plexity.

Differently from the subject and the object, the
order of adjectives within the nominal phrase is
less rigid in Italian. Generally speaking, although
the unmarked position of the adjective is post–
nominal, it changes according to the semantic
properties that the adjective carries with respect to
the noun (Cinque, 2010). The relatively free or-
dering of adjective is confirmed by the empirical
data obtained in this study, although the preferred

position changes according to genres. Specifically,
all but narrative genre prefer post–nominal adjec-
tives, which is also the order that yields on average
longer dependencies from the nominal head (see
columns 6 and 7 in Table 2). When the internal
distinction is taken into account, a stronger effect
is reported by the journalistic genre, which shows
a high statistically significant difference of almost
15% percentage points with respect to the distri-
bution of post–nominal adjective (Rep: 61.31%;
2Par: 75.82%; p<0.001).

Like the adjective, also the adverb has some de-
gree of freedom in Italian since the unmarked po-
sition following the verb is quite flexible and in-

29



fluenced by the semantic class of the adverb (Bon-
vino et al., 2008). The analysis across corpora
shows that the predominant position is always pre–
verbal; interestingly, this order is never affected by
the level of complexity within each genre.

For what concerns the subordinate clause, all
genres exhibit a sharp tendency to place the sub-
ordinate clause after the main clause: in a SVO
language like Italian, this is the ordering that al-
lows the parser to recognize the constituents do-
mains more rapidly and efficiently, as predicted
by performance–based theories (Hawkins, 1994).
According to this parameter, narrative texts appear
as the easiest ones, since the post–verbal position
of the subordinate clause reaches almost 90% both
in the complex and the simple variety. On the
other hand, educational texts deviate more from
this order, showing a higher distribution of subor-
dinate clauses preceding the main clause (AduEdu:
17.38%; ChiEdu: 18.89%). As expected, the
greater complexity derived from placing the sub-
ordinate clause before the main clause affects the
internal structure of the subordinate clause at dif-
ferent levels (Table 3): pre–verbal subordinate
clauses tend to be structurally simpler both in
terms of length (i.e. they are much shorter than
post–verbal ones) and depth (i.e. pre–verbal sub-
ordinate clauses have a less–embedded structure).

5 Conclusion

We have presented a study based on
automatically–dependency parsed corpora aimed
at quantifying the influence of textual genre and
linguistic complexity on the order of constituents
in Italian. On the first side, we showed that the
journalistic and scientific genre tend to preserve
the basic order of constituents, differently from
narrative and educational texts which exhibit
a higher distribution of marked orders. On
the second side, the expected correspondence
between the use of a simple language and the
preservation of more canonical word orders has
been shown to be genre–dependent: it was mainly
verified within the journalistic genre, whereas
narrative and educational texts tend to preserve
the non–canonical order of some constituents (e.g.
post–verbal subject) also in the relative “simple”
variety.

Current developments of this work go in several
directions: one is to conduct a thorough analysis of
the impact of errors derived by automatic linguis-

tic annotation on the distribution of the examined
linguistic parameters; another is to collect corpora
distinct for genre and level of linguistic complex-
ity in other languages in order to assess whether
the effect of these variables on word order varia-
tion is also language–dependent.
