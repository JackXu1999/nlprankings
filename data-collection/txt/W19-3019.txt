Abstract

This paper describes IDLab’s text classifica-
tion systems submitted to Task A as part of
the CLPsych 2019 shared task. The aim of
this shared task was to develop automated sys-
tems that predict the degree of suicide risk of
people based on their posts on Reddit.1 Bag-
of-words features, emotion features and post-
level predictions are used to derive user-level
predictions. Linear models and ensembles of
these models are used to predict final scores.
We find that predicting fine-grained risk lev-
els is much more difficult than flagging po-
tentially at-risk users. Furthermore, we do not
find clear added value from building richer en-
sembles compared to simple baselines, given
the available training data and the nature of the
prediction task.

1 Introduction

The goal of the CLPysch 2019 shared task is to
predict the degree of suicide risk based on online
postings of users. This shared task is motivated by
the long-term lack of progress in predicting sui-
cide risk. McHugh et al. (2019), after reviewing
more than 70 studies, argues that suicidality can-
not be predicted effectively using traditional stan-
dard procedures, e.g., questions of clinicians about
suicidal thoughts: the authors claim that a large
fraction of patients (i.e., 80%) who committed sui-
cide, did not admit contemplating suicide when
asked by a general practitioner. Another study by
Franklin et al. (2017) also concludes that predic-
tion of suicide risks has not improved over the last
50 years and suggests that machine learning learn-
ing methods can contribute towards solving that
challenge.

Typically, there are long periods of time be-
tween clinical encounters of patients. During these
periods, some patients are engaged in frequent use
of social media. Coppersmith et al. (2017) states

that such usage of social media can be exploited
to build binary risk classifiers. However, when
such systems are deployed, the number of people
flagged as “at risk” will exceed clinical capacity
for intervention. This in turn motivates the design
of more fine-grained prediction models, predict-
ing various risk levels, as proposed for the current
shared task.

Our system uses a combination of (i) bag-of–
word features, (ii) emotion labels, and (iii) infor-
mation derived from post-level risk features (see
Section 3.1 for more details). Using these features,
we apply linear models to predict the scores. We
explore different combinations to evaluate the per-
formance of the different models.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the data and the shared
task. Section 3 presents the details of the imple-
mented system and the features. Section 4 shows
the experimental results obtained from the test
data. To compare our results to other participants
in the shared task, we refer the reader to Zirikly
et al. (2019). To conclude, we summarize our find-
ings and present future directions in Section 5.

2 Data and Task A

The dataset used in the shared task is sampled
from the University of Maryland Reddit Suici-
dality Dataset (Shing et al., 2018). It is con-
structed using data from Reddit, an online site for
anonymous discussion on a wide variety of topics.
Specifically, the UMD dataset was extracted from
the 2015 Full Reddit Submission Corpus2,using
postings in the r/SuicideWatch subreddit (hence-
forth simply SuicideWatch or SW) to identify
anonymous users who might represent positive in-
stances of suicidality and including a compara-
ble number of non-SuicideWatch controls. The
dataset is annotated at user level, using a four-

point scale indicating the likelihood of a user to
commit suicide: (a) no risk, (b) low risk, (c) mod-
erate risk, and (d) severe risk. The corpus includes
posts from 21,518 users and is subdivided into
993 labelled users and 20,525 unlabelled users.
Out of the 993 labeled users, 496 have at least
posted once on the SuicideWatch subreddit. The
remaining 497 users are control users (i.e., they
have not posted in SuicideWatch or any mental
health related subreddits). The data is provided
in a comma-separated values file that includes the
post titles, content, timestamps, and anonymized
unique user ids. The goal of shared Task A is
to predict users’ suicide risk into one of the four
classes (i.e., (a)-(d)) given the fact that he/she has
posted on SuicideWatch.

3 Systems Description

This section provides an overview of features ex-
tracted from posts, followed by a short system de-
scription of our submitted runs.

3.1 Features

TF-IDF features: We used the TF-IDF weighting
scheme as text representation. The TF-IDF feature
vectors of n-grams were generated for our dataset.
We experimented with n-grams for n ranging from
1 to 5. In our preliminary investigations, we ex-
plored various kinds of features, such as character
level n-grams, or textual statistical features (such
as the total number of posts), but these did not lead
to increased performance metrics.
Emotion features: We hypothesize that individ-
uals contemplating suicide will tend to express
emotions with negative sentiment, more than in-
dividuals without suicidal thoughts. Therefore,
we use a pre-trained model called DeepMoji3 that
predicts emotions from text (Felbo et al., 2017).
For an individual post of a user, a 64-dimensional
emotion feature vector is generated by the model,
with each dimension corresponding to the proba-
bility for one out of 64 different emojis. We take
the element-wise maximum, average and standard
deviation of this vector as features to represent a
user’s emotions.
Suicide risk features: We reason that post-level
binary risk estimates can help in making the user-
level risk level prediction. To achieve this, we
semi-manually annotated 605 posts from the un-
labelled dataset as follows. First, we trained a TF-

3https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji

IDF based logistic regression classifier to predict
the four class labels (a)–(d), using labelled data for
496 users. We adopt that classifier to assign four
probabilities, one for each class (a)–(d), to each
post in the unlabelled dataset. We take a random
sub-sample of the automatically labelled posts, or-
der it in terms of no-risk probability, and manually
label posts taken in turn from the top and bottom
of the ordered list. We thus obtain a balanced set
of 605 annotated posts (302 ‘risk’, 303 ‘no-risk’),
spending a total annotation time of 5 hours. Sub-
sequently, a TF-IDF based logistic regression bi-
nary classifier was trained on these manually an-
notated posts. Finally, the post-level binary pre-
dictions were then aggregated into user-level sui-
cide risk features by taking the maximum, mean,
and standard deviation of the predicted post-level
scores. The motivation behind this annotation ex-
periment was to investigate the effectiveness of a
cheap additional annotation effort in boosting the
final model’s prediction accuracy. By ‘cheap’ an-
notation effort, we refer to annotations on the post-
level as opposed to user-level, binary as opposed
to 4-label, and directly balanced as opposed to a
larger random sample to obtain the same amount
of at-risk posts.

3.2 Models
Three different systems were explored for our sub-
mission to the shared task. A logistic regression
classifier and two ensemble-based classifiers.

1. Baseline classifier: a logistic regression clas-
sifier (Pedregosa et al., 2011) is trained based
on TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word features.

2. Ensemble without Risk classifier: this en-
semble combines the scores from the baseline
logistic regression classifier, a linear SVM
classifier and the emotion classifier. The lin-
ear SVM, included in scikit-learn (Pedregosa
et al., 2011) is trained on the TF-IDF repre-
sentations. This ensemble uses an additional
logistic regression classifier (at the next level)
to predict the final classes.

3. Ensemble (all): this model combines the
scores from all classifiers as illustrated in
Fig. 1. This ensemble uses a second level
Logistic Regression classifier similar to the
previous ensemble.

With this system choice, we are able to mea-
sure the impact of combining linear classifiers

4 Experimental Results

In this section, we present the final test results of
the three submitted systems on the official test set.
The test set consists of a total of 189 posts from
125 different users. The official evaluation metric
used in the shared task is the macro F1 score on all
four classes. Table 1 depicts the official models’
performance on the test data. Our baseline clas-
sifier outperforms the ensemble models. This can
be explained by (i) bias in the training/test split
during development, (ii) the small number of an-
notated training instances, or (iii) the partly sub-
jective nature of the task, and in particular the dis-
tinction between fine-grained levels such as ‘low
risk’ and ‘moderate risk’. Note that, however, our
most advanced model did perform best for the sim-
pler task of detecting potentially at-risk (‘flagged’)
users. Further research is required to investigate
these potential issues.

Models Precision Recall F1

Baseline 0.444 0.457 0.445
Ensemble w/o Risk 0.428 0.402 0.407
Ensemble (all) 0.445 0.419 0.426

Table 1: Official results

In addition, two more metrics were used. The
first metric is the F1 score for flagged versus non-
flagged users. The flagged vs. non-flagged F1 is
relevant for a use case in which the goal is to
distinguish users that can be safely ignored (cat-

egory (a), no risk) from those that require atten-
tion (i.e., categories (b), (c), (d)), such as when
human moderators need to investigate the risk fur-
ther. Table 2 shows the performance of the models
in binary classification of flagged and non-flagged
users, whereby the ensemble with sentiment fea-
tures (‘Ensemble w/o Risk) outperforms the lin-
ear baseline, but the overall ensemble with binary
post-level risk predictions performs slightly bet-
ter still. Given the much higher scores, the task
of flagging potentially at-risk users appears much
simpler than making fine-grained risk-level pre-
dictions.

Models Precision Recall F1

Baseline 0.904 0.806 0.852
Ensemble w/o Risk 0.848 0.903 0.875
Ensemble (all) 0.850 0.914 0.881

Table 2: Flagged vs Non-flagged

The second metric is the urgent versus non-
urgent F1 score that measures distinction between
users who are at a severe risk of suicide (category
(c) and (d)) and other users. Table 3 shows the
models’ performance for classifying users into ur-
gent and non-urgent classes. The overall higher
scores in Table 3 indicate that the binary classifica-
tion of urgent from non urgent users is fairly sim-
pler task when compared to the fine-grained risk
level classification.

Models Precision Recall F1

Baseline 0.833 0.750 0.789
Ensemble w/o Risk 0.795 0.725 0.758
Ensemble (all) 0.792 0.762 0.777

5 Conclusion and Future work

In this paper, we described the Ghent University-
IDLab submission to the CLPysch 2019 shared
Task A. We found that the baseline classifier based
on logistic regression outperformed the ensemble
of classifiers. Specifically, our baseline model ob-
tained a macro F1-score of 0.445 on the shared
task. Our system also achieves a macro F1-score
of 0.881 and 0.789 on flagging non-risk users and
distinguishing urgent from non-urgent users, re-
spectively. The more advanced models (i.e., en-
sembles) did not bring any added value in the fine-
grained user level risk prediction. This can be due
to the limited number of training examples in the
provided dataset, bias in train/test splits during de-
velopment and the subjective nature of the task.

As next steps, we plan on investigating alterna-
tive ways of splitting train from test data such as
stratified cross-validation (i.e., to avoid different
distributions of the target variable in the train/test
splits). We also want to explore more sophisti-
cated ways of ensembling and stacking techniques
while also taking into account the time stamp
meta-data of posts.
