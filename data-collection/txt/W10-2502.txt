Abstract

Synchronous tree insertion grammars
(STIG) are formal models for syntax-
based machine translation. We formal-
ize a decoder for probabilistic STIG; the
decoder transforms every source-language
string into a target-language tree and cal-
culates the probability of this transforma-
tion.

1 Introduction

Tree adjoining grammars (TAG) were invented in
(Joshi et al. 1975) in order to better character-
ize the string sets of natural languages1. One of
TAG’s important features is the ability to introduce
two related syntactic units in a single rule, then
push those two units arbitrarily far apart in sub-
sequent derivation steps. For machine translation
(MT) between two natural languages, each being
generated by a TAG, the derivations of the two
TAG may be synchronized (Abeille et al., 1990;
Shieber and Shabes, 1990) in the spirit of syntax-
directed transductions (Lewis and Stearns, 1968);
this results in synchronous TAG (STAG). Recently,
in (Nesson et al., 2005, 2006) probabilistic syn-
chronous tree insertion grammars (pSTIG) were
discussed as model of MT; a tree insertion gram-
mar is a particular TAG in which the parsing prob-
lem is solvable in cubic-time (Schabes and Wa-
ters, 1994). In (DeNeefe, 2009; DeNeefe and
Knight 2009) a decoder for pSTIG has been pro-
posed which transforms source-language strings
into (modifications of) derivation trees of the
pSTIG. Nowadays, large-scale linguistic STAG
rule bases are available.

In an independent tradition, the automata-
theoretic investigation of the translation of trees

led to the rich theory of tree transducers (Gécseg
and Steinby, 1984, 1997). Roughly speaking, a
tree transducer is a finite term rewriting system. If
each rewrite rule carries a probablity or, in gen-
eral, a weight from some semiring, then they are
weighted tree transducers (Maletti, 2006, 2006a;
Fülöp and Vogler, 2009). Such weighted tree
transducers have also been used for the specifi-
cation of MT of natural languages (Yamada and
Knight, 2001; Knight and Graehl, 2005; Graehl et
al., 2008; Knight and May 2009).

Martin and Vere (1970) and Schreiber (1975)
established the first connections between the two
traditions; also Shieber (2004, 2006) and Maletti
(2008, 2010) investigated their relationship.

The problem addressed in this paper is the
decoding of source-language strings into target-
language trees where the transformation is de-
scribed by a pSTIG. Currently, this decoding re-
quires two steps: first, every source string is
translated into a derivation tree of the underly-
ing pSTIG (DeNeefe, 2009; DeNeefe and Knight
2009), and second, the derivation tree is trans-
formed into the target tree using an embedded tree
transducer (Shieber, 2006). We propose a trans-
ducer model, called a bottom-up tree adjoining
transducer, which performs this decoding in a sin-
gle step and, simultaneously, computes the prob-
abilities of its derivations. As a basis of our ap-
proach, we present a formal definition of pSTIG.

2 Preliminaries

For two sets Σ and A, we let UΣ(A) be the set of
all (unranked) trees over Σ in which also elements
of A may label leaves. We abbreviate UΣ(∅) by
UΣ. We denote the set of positions, leaves, and
non-leaves of ξ ∈ UΣ by pos(ξ) ⊆ N∗, lv(ξ), and
nlv(ξ), resp., where ε denotes the root of ξ and
w.i denotes the ith child of position w; nlv(ξ) =
pos(ξ) \ lv(ξ). For a position w ∈ pos(ξ), the la-
bel of ξ at w (resp., subtree of ξ at w) is denoted

10



by ξ(w) (resp., ξ|w). If additionally ζ ∈ UΣ(A),
then ξ[ζ]w denotes the tree which is obtained from
ξ by replacing its subtree at w by ζ. For every
∆ ⊆ Σ ∪A, the set pos∆(ξ) is the set of all those
positions w ∈ pos(ξ) such that ξ(w) ∈ ∆. Simi-
larly, we can define lv∆(ξ) and nlv∆(ξ). The yield
of ξ is the sequence yield(ξ) ∈ (Σ ∪ A)∗ of sym-
bols that label the leaves from left to right.

If we associate with σ ∈ Σ a rank k ∈ N, then
we require that in every tree ξ ∈ UΣ(A) every σ-
labeled position has exactly k children.

3 Probabilistic STAG and STIG

First we will define probabilistic STAG, and sec-
ond, as a special case, probabilistic STIG.

Let N and T be two disjoint sets of, resp., non-
terminals and terminals. A substitution rule r is a
tuple (ζs, ζt, V,W, P radj) where
• ζs, ζt ∈ UN (T ) (source and target tree) and
|lvN (ζs)| = |lvN (ζt)|,

• V ⊆ lvN (ζs)×lvN (ζt) (substitution sites), V
is a one-to-one relation, and |V | = |lvN (ζs)|,

• W ⊆ nlvN (ζs)×nlvN (ζt) (potential adjoin-
ing sites), and

• P radj : W → [0, 1] (adjoining probability).
An auxiliary rule r is a tuple (ζs, ζt, V,W, ∗, P radj)
where ζs, ζt,W , and P radj are defined as above and
• V is defined as above except that |V | =
|lvN (ζs)| − 1 and

• ∗ = (∗s, ∗t) ∈ lvN (ζs)× lvN (ζt) and neither
∗s nor ∗t occurs in any element of V ; more-
over, ζs(ε) = ζs(∗s) and ζt(ε) = ζt(∗t), and
∗s 6= ε 6= ∗t; the node ∗s (and ∗t) is called
the foot-node of ζs (resp., ζt).

An (elementary) rule is either a substitution rule
or an auxiliary rule. The root-category of a rule r
is the tuple (ζs(ε), ζt(ε)), denoted by rc(r).

A probabilistic synchronous tree ad-
joining grammar (pSTAG) is a tuple
G = (N,T, (Ss, St),S,A, P ) such that N
and T are two disjoint sets (resp., of nonterminals
and terminals), (Ss, St) ∈ N×N (start nontermi-
nal), S and A are finite sets of, resp., substitution
rules and auxiliary rules, and P : S ∪ A → [0, 1]
such that for every (A,B) ∈ N ×N ,

∑

r∈S
rc(r)=(A,B)

P (r) = 1 and
∑

r∈A
rc(r)=(A,B)

P (r) = 1

assuming that in each case the number of sum-
mands is not zero. In the following, let G always
denote an arbitrary pSTAG.

Figure 1: The running example pSTAG G.

In Fig. 1 we show the rules of our running ex-
ample pSTAG, where the capital Roman letters are
the nonterminals and the small Greek letters are
the terminals. The substitution site (in rule r1) is
indicated by ↓, and the potential adjoining sites are
denoted2 by a, b, c, d, and e. For instance, in for-
mal notation the rules r1 and r2 are written as fol-
lows:

r1 = (Ss(α, A, A(α)), St(B(β), B, β), {↓}, {a}, P
r1
adj)

where ↓ = (2, 2) and a = (3, 1), and

r2 = (A(A, γ), B(B(δ), B), ∅, {b, c}, ∗, P
r2
adj)

where b = (ε, ε), c = (ε, 1), and ∗ = (1, 2).
In the derivation relation of G we will distin-

guish four types of steps:
1. substitution of a rule at a substitution site

(substitution),
2. deciding to turn a potential adjoining site into

an activated adjoining site (activation),
3. deciding to drop a potential adjoining site,

i.e., not to adjoin, (non-adjoining) and
4. adjoining of a rule at an activated adjoining

site (adjoining).
In the sentential forms (defined below) we will
maintain for every adjoining site w a two-valued
flag g(w) indicating whether w is a potential
(g(w) = p) or an activated site (g(w) = a).

The set of sentential forms ofG is the set SF(G)
of all tuples κ = (ξs, ξt, V,W, g) with

2Their placement (as left or right index) does not play a
role yet, but will later when we introduce pSTIG.

• ξs, ξt ∈ UN (T ),
• V ⊆ lvN (ξs)× lvN (ξt) is a one-to-one rela-

tion, |V | = |lvN (ξs)| = |lvN (ξt)|,
• W ⊆ nlvN (ξs)× nlvN (ξt), and
• g : W → {p, a}.

The only initial sentential form is κin =
(Ss, St, {(ε, ε)}, ∅, ∅). A sentential form κ is final
if it has the form (ξs, ξt, ∅, ∅, ∅). Let κ ∈ SF(G).
A derivation (of κ) is a sequence d of the form
κ0u1κ1 . . . unκn with κ0 = κin and n ≥ 0,
κi−1

ui⇒ κi for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n (and κn = κ). We

12



denote κn also by last(d), and the set of all deriva-
tions of κ (resp., derivations) by D(κ) (resp., D).
We call d ∈ D successful if last(d) is final.

The tree transformation computed by G is
the relation τG ⊆ UN (T ) × UN (T ) with
(ξs, ξt) ∈ τG iff there is a successful derivation
of (ξs, ξt, ∅, ∅, ∅).

Our definition of the probability of a deriva-
tion is based on the following observation.4 Let
d ∈ D(κ) for some κ = (ξs, ξt, V,W, g). Then,
for every w ∈ W , the rule which created w and
the corresponding local position in that rule can
be retrieved from d. Let us denote this rule by
r(d, κ, w) and the local position by l(d, κ, w).

Now let d be the derivation κ0u1κ1 . . . unκn.
Then the probability of d is defined by

P (d) =
∏

1≤i≤n

Pd(κi−1
ui⇒ κi)

where
1. (substitution) Pd(κi−1

and w′ are defined as in the activation case
4. (adjoining)
Pd(κi−1

w,r
=⇒ κi) = P (r).

In order to describe the generative model of
G, we impose a deterministic strategy sel on the
derivation relation in order to obtain, for every
sentential form, a probability distribution among
the follow-up sentential forms. A deterministic
derivation strategy is a mapping sel : SF(G) →
(N∗ × N∗) ∪ {⊥} such that for every κ =
(ξs, ξt, V,W, g) ∈ SF(G), we have that sel(κ) ∈
V ∪W if V ∪W 6= ∅, and sel(κ) = ⊥ otherwise.
In other words, sel chooses the next site to operate
on. Then we define⇒sel in the same way as⇒ but
in each of the cases we require that w = sel(κ1).
Moreover, for every derivation d ∈ D, we denote
by next(d) the set of all derivations of the form
duκ where last(d)

u
⇒sel κ.

The generative model of G comprises all the
generative stories of G. A generative story is a
tree t ∈ UD; the root of t is labeled by κin. Let
w ∈ pos(t) and t(w) = d. Then either w is a
leaf, because we have stopped the generative story

4We note that a different definition occurs in (Nesson et
al., 2005, 2006).

at w, or w has |next(d)| children, each one repre-
sents exactly one possible decision about how to
extend d by a single derivation step (where their
order does not matter). Then, for every generative
story t, we have that

∑

w∈lv(t)

P (t(w)) = 1 .

We note that (D,next, µ) can be considered as
a discrete Markov chain (cf., e.g. (Baier et al.,
2009)) where the initial probability distribution
µ : D → [0, 1] maps d = κin to 1, and all the
other derivations to 0.

A probabilistic synchronous tree insertion
grammar (pSTIG) G is a pSTAG except that
for every rule r = (ζs, ζt, V,W, P radj) or r =
(ζs, ζt, V,W, ∗, P

r
adj) we have that

• if r ∈ A, then |lv(ζs)| ≥ 2 and |lv(ζt)| ≥ 2,
• for ∗ = (∗s, ∗t) we have that ∗s is either the

rightmost leaf of ζs or its leftmost one; then
we call r, resp., L-auxiliary in the source and
R-auxiliary in the source; similarly, we re-
strict ∗t; the source-spine of r (target-spine
of r) is the set of prefixes of ∗s (resp., of ∗t)

• W ⊆ nlvN (ζs)×{L,R}×nlvN (ζt)×{L,R}
where the new components are the direction-
type of the potential adjoining site, and

• for every (ws, δs, wt, δt) ∈ W , if ws lies on
the source-spine of r and r is L-auxiliary (R-
auxiliary) in the source, then δs = L (resp.,
δs = R), and corresponding restrictions hold
for the target component.

According to the four possibilities for the foot-
node ∗ we call r LL-, LR-, RL-, or RR-auxiliary.
The restriction for the probability distribution P of
G is modified such that for every (A,B) ∈ N×N
and x, y ∈ {L,R}:

∑

r∈A, rc(r)=(A,B)
r is xy−auxiliary

P (r) = 1 .

In the derivation relation of the pSTIG G we
will have to make sure that the direction-type of
the chosen adjoining site w matches with the type
of auxiliarity of the auxiliary rule. Again we as-
sume that the data structure SF(G) is enriched
such that for every potential adjoining site w of
κ ∈ SF(G) we know its direction-type dir(w).

We define the derivation relation of the pSTIG
G to be the binary relation⇒I ⊆ SF(G)×SF(G)
such that we have κ1 ⇒I κ2 iff (i) κ1 ⇒ κ2 and

13



(ii) if adjoining takes place atw, then the used aux-
iliary rule must be dir(w)-auxiliary. Since ⇒I is
a subset of ⇒, the concepts of derivation, success-
ful derivation, and tree transformation are defined
also for a pSTIG.

In fact, our running example pSTAG in Fig. 1 is
a pSTIG, where r2 and r3 are RL-auxiliary and
every potential adjoining site has direction-type
RL; the derivation shown in Fig. 2 is a pSTIG-
derivation.

4 Bottom-up tree adjoining transducer

Here we introduce the concept of a bottom-up tree
adjoining transducer (BUTAT) which will be used
to formalize a decoder for a pSTIG.

A BUTAT is a finite-state machine which trans-
lates strings into trees. The left-hand side of each
rule is a string over terminal symbols and state-
variable combinations. A variable is either a sub-
stitution variable or an adjoining variable; a substi-
tution variable (resp., adjoining variable) can have
an output tree (resp., output tree with foot node) as
value. Intuitively, each variable value is a transla-
tion of the string that has been reduced to the cor-
responding state. The right-hand side of a rule has
the form q(ζ) where q is a state and ζ is an output
tree (with or without foot-node); ζ may contain the
variables from the left-hand side of the rule. Each
rule has a probability p ∈ [0, 1].

In fact, BUTAT can be viewed as the string-
to-tree version of bottom-up tree transducers (En-
gelfriet, 1975; Gecseg and Steinby, 1984,1997) in
which, in addition to substitution, adjoining is al-
lowed.

Formally, we let X = {x1, x2, . . .} and F =
{f1, f2, . . .} be the sets of substitution variables
and adjoining variables, resp. Each substitu-
tion variable (resp., adjoining variable) has rank
0 (resp., 1). Thus when used in a tree, substitu-
tion variables are leaves, while adjoining variables
have a single child.

A bottom-up tree adjoining transducer (BU-
TAT) is a tuple M = (Q,Γ,∆, Qf , R) where
• Q is a finite set (of states),
• Γ is an alphabet (of input symbols), assuming

that Q ∩ Γ = ∅,
• ∆ is an alphabet (of output symbols),
• Qf ⊆ Q (set of final states), and
• R is a finite set of rules of the form

γ0 q1(z1) γ1 . . . qk(zk) γk
p
→ q(ζ) (†)

where p ∈ [0, 1] (probability of (†)), k ≥ 0,
γ0, γ1, . . . , γk ∈ Γ

∗, q, q1, . . . , qk ∈ Q,
z1, . . . , zk ∈ X ∪ F , and ζ ∈ RHS(k)
where RHS(k) is the set of all trees over
∆ ∪ {z1, . . . , zk} ∪ {∗} in which the nullary
∗ occurs at most once.

The set of intermediate results of M is the set
IR(M) = {ι | ι ∈ U∆({∗}), |pos{∗}(ι)| ≤ 1}
and the set of sentential forms of M is the set
SF(M) = (Γ ∪ {q(ι) | q ∈ Q, ι ∈ IR(M)})∗.
The derivation relation induced by M is the bi-
nary relation ⇒ ⊆ SF(M) × SF(M) such that
for every ξ1, ξ2 ∈ SF(M) we define ξ1 ⇒ ξ2 iff
there are ξ, ξ′ ∈ SF(M), there is a rule of the form
(†) in R, and there are ζ1, . . . , ζk ∈ IR(M) such
that:
• for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k: if zi ∈ X , then ζi does

not contain ∗; if zi ∈ F , then ζi contains ∗
exactly once,

• ξ1 = ξ γ0 q1(ζ1) γ1 . . . qk(ζk) γk ξ
′, and

• ξ2 = ξ q(θ(ζ)) ξ
′

where θ is a function that replaces variables
in a right-hand side with their values (subtrees)
from the left-hand side of the rule. Formally,
θ : RHS(k) → IR(M) is defined as follows:

(i) for every ξ = δ(ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ RHS(k), δ ∈
∆, we have θ(ξ) = δ(θ(ξ1), . . . , θ(ξn)),

(ii) (substitution) for every zi ∈ X , we have
θ(zi) = ζi,

(iii) (adjoining) for every zi ∈ F and ξ ∈
RHS(k), we have θ(zi(ξ)) = ζi[θ(ξ)]v
where v is the uniquely determined position
of ∗ in ζi, and

(iv) θ(∗) = ∗.
Clearly, the probablity of a rule carries over to
derivation steps that employ this rule. Since, as
usual, a derivation d is a sequence of derivation
steps, we let the probability of d be the product of
the probabilities of its steps.

The string-to-tree transformation computed by
M is the set τM of all tuples (γ, ξ) ∈ Γ∗×U∆ such
that there is a derivation of the form γ ⇒∗ q(ξ) for
some q ∈ Qf .

5 Decoder for pSTIG

Now we construct the decoder dec(G) for a pSTIG
G that transforms source strings directly into tar-
get trees and simultaneously computes the proba-
bility of the corresponding derivation of G. This
decoder is formalized as a BUTAT.

Since dec(G) is a string-to-tree transducer, we

14



have to transform the source tree ζs of a rule r
into a left-hand side ρ of a dec(G)-rule. This is
done similarly to (DeNeefe and Knight, 2009) by
traversing ζs via recursive descent using a map-
ping ϕ (see an example after Theorem 1); this
creates appropriate state-variable combinations for
all substitution sites and potential adjoining sites
of r. In particular, the source component of the
direction-type of a potential adjoining site deter-
mines the position of the corresponding combina-
tion in ρ. If there are several potential adjoining
sites with the same source component, then we
create a ρ for every permutation of these sites. The
right-hand side of a dec(G)-rule is obtained by
traversing the target tree ζt via recursive descent
using a mapping ψρ and, whenever a nonterminal
with a potential adjoining site w is met, a new po-
sition labeled by fw is inserted.5 If there is more
than one potential adjoining site, then the set of
all those sites is ordered as in the left-hand side ρ
from top to bottom.

Apart from these main rules we will employ
rules which implement the decision of whether or
not to turn a potential adjoining site w into an ac-
tivated adjoining site. Rules for the first purpose
just pass the already computed output tree through
from left to right, whereas rules for the second pur-
pose create for an empty left-hand side the output
tree ∗.

We will use the state behavior of dec(G) in or-
der to check that (i) the nonterminals of a substi-
tution or potential adjoining site match the root-
category of the used rule, (ii) the direction-type
of an adjoining site matches the auxiliarity of the
chosen auxiliary rule, and (iii) the decisions of
whether or not to adjoin for each rule r of G are
kept separate.

Whereas each pair (ξs, ξt) in the translation of
G is computed in a top-down way, starting at the
initial sentential form and substituting and adjoin-
ing to the present sentential form, dec(G) builds
ξt in a bottom-up way. This change of direction is
legitimate, because adjoining is associative (Vijay-
Shanker and Weir, 1994), i.e., it leads to the same
result whether we first adjoin r2 to r1, and then
align r3 to the resulting tree, or first adjoin r3 to
r2, and then adjoin the resulting tree to r1.

In Fig. 3 we show some rules of the decoder
of our running example pSTIG and in Fig. 4 the

are not elements of N. However, by applying a bijective re-
naming, we can always obtain rules of the form (†).

derivation of this decoder which correponds to the
derivation in Fig. 2.

Theorem 1. Let G be a pSTIG over N and T .
Then there is a BUTAT dec(G) such that for ev-
ery (ξs, ξt) ∈ UN (T ) × UN (T ) and p ∈ [0, 1] the
following two statements are equivalent:

1. there is a successful derivation of
(ξs, ξt, ∅, ∅, ∅) by G with probability p,

2. there is a derivation from yield(ξs) to
[Ss, St](ξt) by dec(G) with probability p.

PROOF. Let G = (N,T, [Ss, St],S,A, P ) be a
pSTIG. We will construct the BUTAT dec(G) =
(Q,T,N ∪T, {[Ss, St]}, R) as follows (where the
mappings ϕ and ψρ will be defined below):
• Q = [N ×N ] ∪ [N ×{L,R}×N ×{L,R}]
∪{[r, w] | r ∈ A, w is an adjoining site of r},

• R is the smallest set R′ of rules such
that for every r ∈ S ∪ A of the form
(ζs, ζt, V,W, P

r
adj) or (ζs, ζt, V,W, ∗, P

r
adj):

– for every ρ ∈ ϕ(ε), if r ∈ S, then the
main rule

ρ
P (r)
→ [ζs(ε), ζt(ε)]

(

ψρ(ε)
)

is in R′, and if r ∈ A and r is δsδt-
auxiliary, then the main rule

ρ
P (r)
→ [ζs(ε), δs, ζt(ε), δt]

(

ψρ(ε)
)

is in R′, and
– for every w = (ws, δs, wt, δt) ∈ W the

rules

qw
(

fw
) P radj(w)

(

fw(∗)
)

with qw = [ζ(ws), δs, ζt(wt), δt] for ac-
tivation at w, and the rule

−→ [r, w](∗)

for non-adjoining at w are in R′.
We define the mapping

ϕ : pos(ζs) → P((T ∪Q(X ∪ F ))
∗)

with Q(X ∪ F ) = {q(z) | q ∈ Q, z ∈ X ∪ F}
inductively on its argument as follows. Let w ∈
pos(ζs) and let w have n children.
(a) Let ζs(w) ∈ T . Then ϕ(w) = {ζs(w)}.

15



(b) (substitution site) Let ζs(w) ∈ N and let
w′ ∈ pos(ζt) such that (w,w′) ∈ V . Then

ϕ(w) = {[ζs(w), ζt(w
′)]

(

x(w,w′)
)

}.

(c) (adjoining site) Let ζs(w) ∈ N and let there
be an adjoining site in W with w as first
component. Then, we define ϕ(w) to be the
smallest set such that for every permutation
(u1, . . . , ul) (resp., (v1, . . . , vm)) of all the L-
adjoining (resp., R-adjoining) sites inW with
w as first component, the set6

J ◦ ϕ(w.1) ◦ . . . ◦ ϕ(w.n) ◦K

is a subset of ϕ(w), where J = {u′1 . . . u
′
l}

and K = {v′m . . . v
′
1} and

u′i = [r, ui]
(

fui
)

and v′j = [r, vj ]
(

fvj
)

for 1 ≤ i ≤ l and 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
(d) Let ζs(w) ∈ N , w 6= ∗, and let w be neither

the first component of a substitution site in V
nor the first component of an adjoining site in
W . Then

ϕ(w) = ϕ(w.1) ◦ . . . ◦ ϕ(w.n) .

(e) Let w = ∗. Then we define ϕ(w) = {ε}.
For every ρ ∈ ϕ(ε), we define the mapping

ψρ : pos(ζt) → UN∪F∪X(T ∪ {∗})

inductively on its argument as follows. Let
w ∈ pos(ζt) and let w have n children.
(a) Let ζt(w) ∈ T . Then ψρ(w) = ζt(w).
(b) (substitution site) Let ζt(w) ∈ N and let

w′ ∈ pos(ζs) such that (w′, w) ∈ V . Then
ψρ(w) = x(w′,w).

(c) (adjoining site) Let ζt(w) ∈ N and let there
be an adjoining site in W with w as third
component. Then let {u1, . . . , ul} ⊆ W be
the set of all potential adjoining sites with w
as third component, and we define

ψρ(w) = fu1(. . . ful(ζ) . . .)

where ζ = ζt(w)(ψρ(w.1), . . . , ψρ(w.n))
and the ui’s occur in ψρ(w) (from the root
towards the leaves) in exactly the same order
as they occur in ρ (from left to right).

(d) Let ζt(w) ∈ N , w 6= ∗, and let w be neither
the second component of a substitution site
in V nor the third component of an adjoining
site in W . Then

ψρ(w) = ζt(w)(ψρ(w.1), . . . , ψρ(w.n)).

6using the usual concatenation ◦ of formal languages

(e) Let w = ∗. Then ψρ(w) = ∗.
With dec(G) constructed as shown, for each
derivation of G there is a corresponding deriva-
tion of dec(G), with the same probability, and vice
versa. The derivations proceed in opposite direc-
tions. Each sentential form in one has an equiv-
alent sentential form in the other, and each step
of the derivations correspond. There is no space
to present the full proof, but let us give a slightly
more precise idea about the formal relationship be-
tween the derivations of G and dec(G).

In the usual way we can associate a deriva-
tion tree dt with every successful derivation d of
G. Assume that last(d) = (ξs, ξt, ∅, ∅, ∅), and
let Es and Et be the embedded tree transducers
(Shieber, 2006) associated with, respectively, the
source component and the target component of
G. Then it was shown in (Shieber, 2006) that
τEs(d

t) = ξs and τEt(d
t) = ξt where τE de-

notes the tree-to-tree transduction computed by an
embedded tree transducer E. Roughly speaking,
Es and Et reproduce the derivations of, respec-
tively, the source component and the target com-
ponent of G that are prescribed by dt. Thus, for
κ = (ξ′s, ξ

′
t, V,W, g), if κin ⇒

∗
G κ and κ is a prefix

of d, then there is exactly one subtree dt[(w,w′)]
of dt associated with every (w,w′) ∈ V ∪ W ,
which prescribes how to continue at (w,w′) with
the reproduction of d. Having this in mind, we ob-
tain the sentential form of the dec(G)-derivation
which corresponds to κ by applying a modifica-
tion of ϕ to κ where the modification amounts to
replacing x(w,w′) and f(w,w′) by τEt(d

t[(w,w′)]);
note that τEt(d

t[(w,w′)]) might contain ∗. �

As illustration of the construction in Theorem 1
let us apply the mappings ϕ and ψρ to rule r2 of
Fig. 1, i.e., to r2 = (ζs, ζt, ∅, {b, c}, ∗, P

r2
adj)

with ζs = A(A, γ), ζt = B(B(δ), B),
b = (ε,R, ε,L), c = (ε,R, 1,L), and ∗ = (1, 2).

Let us calculate ϕ(ε) on ζs. Due to (c),

ϕ(ε) = J ◦ ϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(2) ◦K.

Since there are no L-adjoinings at ε, we have that
J = {ε}. Since there are the R-adjoinings b and c
at ε, we have the two permutations (b, c) and (c, b).
(v1, v2) = (b, c): K = {[r2, c](fc)[r2, b](fb)}
(v1, v2) = (c, b): K = {[r2, b](fb)[r2, c](fc)}

Due to (e) and (a), we have that ϕ(1) = {ε} and
ϕ(2) = {γ}, resp. Thus, ϕ(ε) is the set:

{γ [r2, c](fc) [r2, b](fb), γ [r2, b](fb) [r2, c](fc)}.

Now let ρ = γ [r2, b](fb) [r2, c](fc). Let us cal-

(c)
= fb(B(ψρ(1), ψρ(2)))
