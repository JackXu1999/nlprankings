Abstract

This paper presents an analysis of bound vari-
able pronouns in English using Synchronous
Tree Adjoining Grammar. Bound variables
are represented as multi-component sets, com-
posing in delayed tree-local derivations. We
propose that the observed anti-locality restric-
tion on English bound variables can be for-
malised in terms of a constraint on the de-
lay in the composition of the bound variable
multi-component set. While most cases are
captured in a derivation making use of two si-
multaneous delays, maintaining weak equiva-
lence with flexible composition, our analysis
is open to derivations with an unlimited num-
ber of simultaneous delays.

1 Introduction

The English pronouns in (1a) and (1b) do not have
the same function as referential pronouns. Instead,
they function as bound variables, their references de-
termined by the c-commanding antecedent. The re-
lationship between the antecedent (binder) and the
bound variable is difficult to capture in standard
TAG, as the dependency between them is necessarily
non-local. The predicate in (1a) intervenes between
the variable and its binder, and this dependency is
even further stretched in (1b) where two predicates
intervene.

(1) a. Every girli loves heri father.

b. Every girli knows that shei is smart.

To capture these cases, a TAG variant is needed
which will allow for this type of non-local deriva-
tion without excessively increasing generative ca-
pacity. In this paper, we show that Delayed Tree-
Local Multi-Component (MC) TAG, demonstrated

by Chiang and Scheffler (2008) to be weakly equiv-
alent to standard TAG, permits exactly this kind of
non-local derivation. We show that 2-delayed tree-
local derivation is sufficient to handle core cases
such as in (1), though a generalization to k-delayed
tree-local derivation is needed to handle compli-
cated cases where a bound variable is embedded in
a DP that has another bound variable. Our anal-
ysis of bound variable anaphora in English also
makes use of Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (STAG) as formulated by Shieber (1994), aug-
mented with syntactic feature agreement (Vijay-
Shanker and Joshi, 1988). In Section 2, we show
our analysis of the core cases such as (1a) and (1b).
We then show, in Sections 3 and 4, how semantic
and syntactic well-formedness constraints work to-
gether to rule out certain ungrammatical cases, and
argue for the necessity of an anti-locality constraint
based on the size of delays. In Section 5, we briefly
discuss the cases that require generalization to k-
delayed tree-local derivation.

2 The Analysis of Core Cases

Elementary trees for (1a) are presented in Figure 1.
In the semantic trees, nodes are labelled as (T)erms,
(R)elations, and (F)ormulae. Indices are included
on substitution sites not only as a mark of syntactic
movement, but also to identify substitution sites in
derivation trees.

is an MC set. (α′every girl) is a variable which
substitutes into an argument position in (α′loves).
(β′every girl) is an auxiliary tree which adjoins at
the root of (α′loves), taking advantage of the mul-
tiple links (indicated by boxed numerals) between
the syntax and semantics trees. A syntactic argu-
ment position links to two positions in the seman-
tics: one for the argument variable, and another at
the predicate’s root where scope is calculated. In
this way, isomorphism of the derivations is main-
tained despite one syntactic tree corresponding to an
MC set in the semantics. (β′every girl) presents a
generalised quantifier (GQ) analysis (Barwise and
Cooper, 1981), as implemented for STAG in Han
et al. (2008). The trees for father of are similar, im-
plementing a GQ analysis for possession. Follow-
ing Shieber and Schabes (1990) and Kallmeyer and
Joshi (2003), we leave unspecified the order of ad-
joining for the scope portions of the GQs at the root
of (α′loves). The possessor is the bound variable
her, an MC tree set in both syntax and semantics.
(αher) is a DP, which substitutes into (αfather of).
There is a defective auxiliary tree (βher) which ad-
joins at the root of (αevery girl); syntactic agree-

ment is captured in the union of φ features at this
adjoining site. The semantic side follows the same
derivation: (α′her) substitutes into the linked argu-
ment position in (β′father of), and (β′her) adjoins
into (β′every girl), between the GQ and the binder,
λxg. (β′her) contains a condensed representation of
the binder index evaluation rule presented in Büring
(2005), using one function to show both steps of al-
tering the assignment function on the relation cre-
ated by the binder portion of (β′every girl), and
then re-binding the remaining variable inside. This
derivation is licit under the definition of 2-Delayed
Tree-Local MC-TAG, in that there are no more than
two simultaneous delays. Delays are defined as sets
of derivation tree nodes along the shortest path be-
tween members of an MC set, excluding the lowest
node dominating both members of the MC set. As
shown in (2), there are three delays in the seman-
tic derivation, but no one node in the derivation tree
participates in more than two delays.

(2) Delay for every girl:
{α′every girl, β′every girl}
Delay for father of:

{α′father of, β′father of}
Delay for her:
{α′her, β′her, β′father of, β′every girl }

In the syntactic derivation, only one delay is present:

(3) Delay for her:
{αher, βher, αfather of, αevery girl }

While this delay is not identical to the semantic
one, it is set-isomorphic in that both delays for her
contain members of the father of and every girl sets.
The difference is that on the syntax side, composi-
tion of (βher) is with (αevery girl) while (β′her) is
composed with (β′every girl), which has no equiva-
lent in the syntax.

The final derived trees are shown in Figure 3. Re-
calling the ambiguous ordering of adjoining at the
root of (α′loves), we only show the derived seman-
tic tree for the ordering where (β′father of) adjoins
before (β′every girl); though the alternate order is
available, it results in the x4 variable remaining un-
bound, and we assume this is blocked by a constraint
against unbound variables. Semantic composition
on the tree in (γ1a) yields the formula in (4), show-
ing the binding relationship between every girl and
her.

(4) ∀x[girl(x)][THEy[father(y) ∧
Rel(y,x)][loves(x,y)]]

A similar derivation is possible for the example in
(1b), with additional trees shown in Figure 4. Fol-
lowing the derivation in Figure 5, we arrive at the
derived trees in Figure 6. Again, the derivation has
no more than two simultaneous delays. The final se-
mantic form is shown in (5), and the expected vari-
able binding comes through the derivation.〈 δ1b: αsmart

3 Blocking Spurious Derivations

There are some derivations which our analysis must
block, shown in (6). For the case of (6a), the
standard explanation is that the variable is not
c-commanded by its quantifier. Making use of
previously-presented elementary trees, the deriva-
tion of (6a) is shown in Figure 7.

(6) a. * Shei thinks that every girli is smart.

b. * Every girli loves heri
c. Every girli loves herselfi

Figure 7: Derivation trees for *Shei knows that every girli
is smart.

Note that there is nothing about the derivation it-
self which blocks (6a): the same delays are observed
as in (1b). However, performing semantic composi-
tion on the derived semantic tree in Figure 8 yields
(7), which leaves the x variable unbound, similar to
the blocked derivation for (1a).

(7) thinks(x,∀x[girl(x)][smart(x)])
The situation in (6b) is more complex. This exam-

ple can be derived using familiar elementary trees,
with derivation trees shown in Figure 9. The derived
trees in Figure 10 result in the semantic form given
in (8); all variables are bound, and the intended read-
ing comes out, yet the example is ungrammatical.

For this, we propose a constraint on the deriva-

tion itself, based on the delays. Nesson and Shieber
(2009) propose that locality on MC sets can be mea-
sured in terms of the size of a delay. For all the
previous examples, the cardinality of a delay for a

bound variable was at least four. For (6b), the de-
lay is smaller, with a cardinality of only three. We
thus propose a constraint on derivations containing
bound variable trees in English: the cardinality of
the delay of an MC set for a bound variable must
be at least four, imposing a minimum distance be-
tween the variable and its antecedent. The grammat-
ical equivalent of (6b), using a reflexive in (6c), can
be captured with the analyses of either Frank (2008)
or Storoshenko et al. (2008).

4 Capturing Crossover

In the literature on bound variable anaphora, a
widely-known constraint is that against crossover,
coming in two flavours, weak and strong. For
both cases, the analysis is that an antecedent in a
derived position binds a variable it did not orig-
inally c-command. Looking at the examples in
(9), crossover will result after quantifier raising. In
strong crossover, the variable c-commands the quan-
tifier’s base position, shown in (9a), but in weak
crossover, the (9b) case, this is not so.

(9) a. * Shei loves every girli
b. * Heri father loves every girli

(9a), derived according to Figure 11, is semanti-
cally identical to (6b) after all composition has been
completed on the derived trees in Figure 12. The
same constraint on the delay will rule out this exam-
ple, as the cardinality of the delay of the MC set for

the bound variable is again just three. Furthermore,
Condition C, implemented for STAG, would rule out
such an example.

However, the same constraints will not account
for (9b). Recalling the discussion of (1a), there
are two possible derivations where there are two
GQs, one of which leaves the variable contributed
by (α′her) unbound. However, a perfectly legitimate
derivation is possible, shown in Figure 13. This ex-
ample cannot be blocked on the basis of the delay
size constraint, as the delay of the MC set for the
bound variable has a cardinality of four. Semantic
composition from the derived trees in Figure 14 re-
sults in the semantic form in (10) with the variable
bound, and the intended meaning intact.

(10) ∀x[girl(x)][THEy[father(y) ∧
Rel(y, x)][loves(y, x)]]

To block this, we impose one final constraint on
the syntax of the bound variable, a c-command con-
straint between the elementary trees of the bound
variable MC set: in the derived syntactic tree, the
defective DP* elementary tree must c-command the
argument DP tree. In (9b), (βher) is adjoined at
the root of (αevery girl), while (αher) substitutes
at a higher position in (αloves); the necessary c-
command relation does not hold, ruling out this sen-
tence. The same constraint will also rule out (9a),
and it will likewise rule out (6a), both of which vio-
lated other constraints as well.

5 Complicated Cases

The examples presented in this paper so far have all
been restricted to 2-delayed tree-local derivations.
There are however examples which, if treated un-
der our present analysis, will require more than 2 si-
multaneous delays in the derivation. These are cases
where more than one bound variable is embedded in
a DP, as in (11).1

(11) a. Every girli showed a boyj some picture
of himj by heri.

1Thanks to a TAG+10 reviewer for pointing this out to us
and providing us with these examples.

b. Every girli told a boyj that some
professork liked a picture of himj that
shei gave himk.

For instance, as can be seen from the se-
mantic derivation tree of (11a) in Figure 15,
(α′some picture of) occurs in 3 delays, those of
some picture of, him and by her. And in (11b), it
occurs in 4 delays, those of some picture of, himj ,
she, and himk . So, as the number of bound vari-
ables embedded in a DP increases, so does the num-
ber of simultaneous delays in the derivation. As em-
bedding is in principle unbounded, we cannot put a
formal bound on the number of simultaneous delays
required to handle bound variables, though Tatjana
Scheffler (p.c.) points out that the number of ele-
mentary trees will ultimately limit the number of de-
lays in a given derivation—it’s not the case that any
one derivation will have an unbounded number of
delays. Still, we speculate that as the number of si-
multaneous delays increases, so does the processing
load in deriving the sentence. Speakers encountering
a 4-delay example such as (11b) may have difficulty
in reaching the desired interpretation.2

2Chiang and Scheffler (2008) has shown that 2-delayed tree-
local MC-TAG is weakly equivalent to MC-TAG with flexible
composition. The existence of such examples as in (11) which
require even further simultaneous delays can be argued to show
that delayed tree local derivations are preferable to derivations
using flexible composition in that they permit such sentences to
be formed.

6 Conclusion and Implications

In this paper, we have presented an analysis of bound
variable anaphora for English in STAG. This analy-
sis presents the bound variable as an MC set in the
syntax and the semantics, and crucially makes use of
delayed tree-locality in the derivation. We have pro-
posed three different constraints on the derivations:
a syntactic constraint which was necessary to rule
out weak crossover, a semantic constraint against
derivations with unbound variables, and a derivation
constraint which enforces a degree of anti-locality,
to account for the case where a reflexive must be
used. While some derivations violate multiple con-
straints, each constraint is vital in ruling out at least
one ungrammatical example. The syntactic and se-
mantic constraints are quite standard in the litera-
ture on bound variables, and are relatively uncontro-
versial. In future work, we hope to explore possi-
ble parametric variation in the delay constraint, ac-
counting for languages where bound variables are
either more strictly local, or more flexible in their
use than in English. Our analysis has not touched
on co-referential, rather than bound, uses of English
pronouns. These we assume to be captured under
an STAG implementation of Condition B, possibly
along the lines of the LTAG binding theory proposed

in Champollion (2008). Finally, acknowledging
that our present analysis requires a c-command con-
straint between the variable and its antecedent, we
leave for future work English cases such as Some-
one from every cityi is proud of itsi history, in which
a pronoun with a bound variable interpretation is not
c-commanded by its antecedent.
