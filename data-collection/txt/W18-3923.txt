Abstract 

With the goal of discovering differences between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, we partici-
pated as Team Taurus in the Dutch-Flemish Subtitles task of VarDial2018. We used a rather 
simple marker-based method, but with a wide range of features, including lexical, lexico-syn-
tactic and syntactic ones, and achieved a second position in the ranking. Inspection of highly 
distinguishing features did point towards differences between the two language varieties, but 
because of the nature of the experimental data, we have to treat our observations as very tenta-
tive and in need of further investigation. 

1 Introduction 

The main area where the Dutch Language is spoken is in The Netherlands and the Northern part of 
Belgium (Flanders). Although there are quite strong dialects in regions in both countries, the standard 
version of Dutch is shared. In fact, there is a joint Dutch Language Union that promotes and supports 
standard Dutch. Still, many native speakers have the feeling that there are subtle differences between 
the Northern and the Southern variety of standard Dutch, and that these differences are not limited to 
just pronunciation. We would like to verify whether this intuition is correct, by investigating (qualita-
tively and quantitatively) the language use in corpus material that is meant to represent standard Dutch 
(and not, e.g., the language used on social media as that tends to contain high levels of dialect in various 
regions) and that is balanced in all factors apart from the language variety. However, such a corpus is 
hard to come by. The Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk et al., 2000) contains both varieties, but the con-
tent is necessarily biased by location. The same can be said about SoNaR (Stevin Dutch Reference Cor-
pus; Oostdijk et al., 2013). We were therefore pleased to find that one of the tasks of VarDial 2018 
(Zampieri et al., 2018), namely Discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles (DFS), appeared 
to provide exactly what we were looking for: a corpus of subtitles of international movies and tv shows, 
produced by the Dutch and Belgian branches of Broadcast Text International (BTI Studios) and decided 
to participate, as Team Taurus. 

As can be deduced from the introduction above, our main goal is not the highest possible recognition 
score; rather, we want to establish if the two varieties differ from each other and if so, in what respect. 
Of course, a score higher than chance is required to show that indeed there are differences between the 
varieties, but mostly we are interested in which features are apparently used in distinguishing between 
Northern and Southern Dutch. This means that we are limited in our choice of recognition methods. For 
example Support Vector Machines, although very strong in recognition quality, are not suited for our 
purpose as the transformation of the feature space makes evaluation per feature impossible. Instead, we 
chose a very simple marker-based method, which allows us to see directly how much each feature con-
tributes. As for recognition features, our main interest lies in syntax, even for text classification already 
more than two decades (Baayen et al., 1996). Still, we chose as wide a range as we could extract in the 
time allotted to this project, ranging from character n-grams to syntactic rewrites.

In the sections below we will first describe some related work (Section 2) and then the experimental 
data and our preprocessing (Section 3). Next we describe our features in more detail (Section 4). Then 
we proceed with the recognition method and the recognition quality (Section 5). Our investigation on 
variety-distinguishing features in this paper will be restricted to token unigrams (Section 6) and syntactic 
features (Section 7). We conclude with a more general discussion of the results (Section 8).  

2 Related Work 

Existing work that is related to this paper can belong to several classes. Seeing the volume that this paper 
is published in, the most obvious class is also the one that needs least discussion: dialect recognition in 
general. Overviews of the field can be found in the VarDial reports (Zampieri et al., 2017; Zampieri et 
al., 2018). The field is dominated by text classification methods using knowledge-poor features, namely 
character n-grams and word n-grams. Differences are generally present in the choice of machine learning 
method and tuning approaches. Van der Lee and van den Bosch (2017) deserve a special mention, on 
various grounds. They compare Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, using the SUBTIEL corpus from 
which the VarDial2018-DFS data has also been extracted. Furthermore, they explore a wide range of 
machine learning methods, as well as features based on POS-tagging (which they call ‘syntactic fea-
tures’, whereas we reserve this term for features based on full syntactic analysis). 

An entirely different field is that of linguistic studies into language variation, within which we now 
want to focus on differences between the Belgian and Netherlandic varieties of Standard Dutch (ignoring 
the many regional and local dialects that exist). Although many people seem to think that the two vari-
eties are virtually identical in word use, and merely differ in pronunciation, native speakers do “feel” 
differences even in written texts. These intuitions also made their way into NLP, e.g. Despres et al. 
(2009) decided for their speech recognition of broadcast news not only to make specific acoustic models 
for the Dutch and Flemish datasets, but also separate lexicons and language models. Specific data for a 
more targeted study into lexical differences was provided by Keuleers et al. (2015). They conducted a 
large crowd-sourcing experiment, in which test subjects had to indicate for Dutch words and 
pseudowords whether or not they recognized the presented forms as Dutch words. On the basis of the 
collected data, they could study the influence of factors like age, education level and proficiency in other 
languages on vocabulary size. However, they also compiled a table which reports for each word which 
percentage of participants in Belgium and the Netherlands recognized the word, something they called 
prevalence. They pose that prevalence is complementary to corpus-based word frequency counts for the 
prediction of word occurrence. For more rare words, prevalence should be better, as these words will 
likely be absent, or show very low counts, in corpora. They prove their point by using both prevalence 
and frequency data (from SUBTLEX-NL; Keuleers et al, 2010) to predict reaction times from a lexical 
decision task.  For the words for which both measures are present, prevalence and frequency have only 
a correlation of 0.35, showing they are really different. Log frequency predicted 36% of the variance in 
the reaction times, prevalence 33%, and jointly they predicted 51%. Whereas their analyses were con-
ducted on the full set of measurements, the prevalence table contains separate values for Belgian and 
Netherlandic Dutch, which we will use below. 

Studies investigating syntactic differences between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch generally focus 
on specific constructions. The differences that are observed seldom concern constructions that are 
unique to either language variety. Mostly constructions are found to occur in both varieties with a pref-
erence for one construction over another, often under specific conditions and in specific contexts. This 
requires intricate analyses to bring to light the complexes of syntactic and semantic/pragmatic factors 
that can explain the subtle differences in the way the constructions are used. Examples are the studies 
by Grondelaers and Speelman (2007) on presentative sentences, Boogaart (2007) on conditional clauses 
with moest(en) and mocht(en), Barbiers and Bennis (2010) on constituent ordering in the clause-final 
verb group and Gyselinck and Colleman (2016) on the intensifying use of the fake reflexive resultative 
construction.  

3 Experimental Data 

The data for the DFS shared task of VarDial2018 (Zampieri et al., 2018) originate from the SUBTIEL 
Corpus (van der Lee, 2017; van der Lee and van den Bosch, 2017). They consist of Dutch subtitles for 
movies and tv shows, produced by the Dutch and the Belgian branch of the company Broadcast Text 



201

International (BTI Studios). For the shared task, the subtitles have been marked as either Belgian or 
Netherlandic Dutch depending on the market for which they were prepared. This is likely, but not guar-
anteed, to correspond to subtitling in the corresponding branch by a native speaker of the corresponding 
variety. 

Sequences  of subtitles comprising a number of full subtitles and containing about 30-35 words were 
selected randomly from the whole data set to be used as task items. 150,000 training items and 250 
development items for each variety were provided beforehand, and 20,000 test items a few days before 
the submission deadline. As we did not use a tuning step in our training, we merged the development 
data with the training data. The training and test data were both selected completely randomly from the 
full data set. There was no overlap in items, but it was possible that there were test items belonging to 
the same movies or tv shows as training items. As we will see below, this had a substantial influence on 
the nature of the task.   

When inspecting the data, we found several artefacts of earlier preprocessing steps. Most notably, all 
characters with diacritics were removed (e.g. één (“a”) became n), or alternatively the diacritic was 
removed but also a space was inserted (e.g. ruïne (“ruin”) became ru ine). Furthermore, periods in num-
bers had spaces inserted next to them (e.g. 20.000 (“20,000”) became 20. 000). Also apostrophes in 
words like z’n (zijn, “his”) were removed; apparently, some correction had already been applied, but this 
also produced non-existing forms like zeen.  

Now, these artefacts would not be a problem for character or token n-gram recognition. However, we 
were planning to use POS tagging and syntactic parsing, for which these artefacts would most certainly 
lead to errors. We therefore decided to include a preprocessing step in which we tried to correct most of 
these artefacts. For the diacritics, it would have been easiest to compare to a Dutch word list in which 
diacritics were included, but we did not manage to acquire such a resource quickly enough. Instead, we 
inspected derived word counts and the text itself manually, and build a list of about 270 regular expres-
sion substitutes, such as  
s/\([Gg]e\) dealiseerde /\1idealiseerde /g 
s/i re /iere /g 
s/\([0-9]\)\([,.]\)  *\([0-9]\)/\1\2\3/g 

As we spent only limited time on this, we missed cases, even (in retrospect) obvious ones like financi 
ele (financiële, “financial”), leading to non-words like ele in the observations below. 

4 Recognition Features 

As stated above, our main goal was to find differences between the Northern and Southern varieties of 
standard Dutch, both lexical and syntactic. To be able to extract features needed for this goal, we ana-
lysed the text with a combination of Frog (van den Bosch et al., 2007) and Alpino (Bouma et al., 2001). 
However, we also took the recognition task seriously, and included more traditional character and token 
n-gram features (Stamatatos, 2009). In the actual recognition we only used features with odds higher or 
equal to 2 in favour of either variety (see Section 5). 

The character and token n-gram features (below called lexical features) were extracted from the orig-
inal (but cleaned up) data. Hash characters (#) were inserted before and after each sentence for the ex-
traction of begin/end n-grams. For character n-grams, n ranged from 1 to 5, for token n-grams from 1 to 
3. Table 1 shows some examples and statistics for the lexical features.

Token 3-gram T3_WWW_de_dingen_des 264,367 107,595 

Table 1: Lexical features

The next level of features are those which can be extracted after POS tagging (below called tagging 
features). Frog yields an annotation with the tagset created for the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk et 
al., 2000). An example is shown in Figure 1. We used the POS tags by themselves, but also in broader 
POS groups, retaining only the first attribute, leading to groups like WW(inf) and N(soort). Also, apart 
from the POS tags, the tagging process provides us with lemmas, or rather stems as e.g. for was (“was”), 
we find the first person singular ben (“am”). From this annotation we derived unigrams, bigrams and 
trigrams. In each of the positions of the n-grams, we put one of the following: the word (W), the lemma 
(L), the full POS tag (P), or the POS group (G). As an example, T3_GLP_LID(bep)_ 
ding_LID(bep,gen,evmo) is the trigram built with a POS group, a lemma and a POS, that corre-
sponds to the example de dingen des (“the things of”) in Table 1. Table 2 shows some examples and 
statistics for the tagging features. Here the pure word combinations are excluded as they have been 
counted as lexical features.  

The final group of features (below called syntactic features) have been derived from the syntactic 
parse produced by Frog and Alpino. However, since the dependency structure is less amenable to vari-
ation studies than a constituency structure, we first transformed the trees. We started with the ‘surfacing’ 
procedure developed by Erwin Komen (2015), and followed it up with a few more transformations, 
especially around the verb phrase. Furthermore, the analyses were lexicalized by percolating the head 
words upwards. As an example the parse of the sentence in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2. From the trees 
we derived two types of features. We built a kind of syntactic n-grams by taking subtrees such as a 
functional constituent (F) realized by syntactic category (C) containing a functional constituent realized 
by syntactic category (e.g. SFCFC_mod_WHREL_obj1_TW, a modifier realized by a wh-relative 
clause (WHREL) containing a direct object (obj1) realized by a cardinal numeral (TW); or SCFF-
CCL_NP_hd_N(ding)_mod_NP(leven), a noun phrase (NP) containing both a head (hd) realized 
by a noun (N) with lemma ding and a modifier (mod) realized by a noun phrase (NP) with a head leven, 
which corresponds to the example de dingen des levens (“the things of life”) which we already saw 
above. The second type of feature are the full rewrites at all positions in the tree, e.g. 
SRFC_WHQ_whd_VNW_hd_WWlex_obj1_TW_<NOFUN>_. (a wh- question realized by a interrog-
ative pronoun, a verb, and a direct object realized by a cardinal numeral, ending with a sentence closing

5 Recognition System and Results 

Our choice of recognition system as well was influenced by our goal of finding differences between the 
two language varieties. After successful recognition, we wanted to be able to identify which features 
contributed to the success. For this experiment, we chose a very simple algorithm. We counted the oc-
currences of each feature in the Netherlandic and Belgian training items and compared the two counts 
to derive odds. For example, the word bigram Komaan_, (“Come on ,”) was found 209 times in the 
Belgian items and 4 times in the Netherlandic items, leading to odds of 52.25 in favour of Belgian Dutch. 

If a feature was not seen in one of the varieties, its count was set to 1 for the calculation of odds, e.g. 
the name Sami was found 275 times in the Belgian items and never in the Netherlandic items, leading 
to odds of 275. For the actual recognition, we only used features that had odds higher than or equal to 2 
in either direction. In the numerical representations below, odds in favour of Netherlandic are shown as 
negative and in favour of Belgian as positive.  

In the test phase, all features present in an item were taken and their odds contributed directly to the 
item score. In the simplest version, all odds were simply added, after which a positive total indicated 

<NOFUN>:SMAIN(krijg) ->      [ mod auxv su mod obj1 mod lexv <NOFUN> ] 
      mod:PP(voor|vandaag) ->      [ hd obj1 ]

Belgian and a negative total Netherlandic. Based on experience in other projects, we expected an in-
crease in recognition quality when taking several feature classes and then combining the results. For 
such an approach, we split the features split into 15 classes. The lexical features C1, C2, C3, C4, 
C5, T1_W, T2_WW and T3_WWW each formed their own class. N-grams built purely from POS tags 
formed  classes T1_tag, T2_tag and T3_tag. N-grams built with other component mixes formed 
classes T2_mix and T3_mix. Syntactic features were split into Spure and Slexical, depending 
on whether they contained references to lexical items. The odds addition was done per feature class, 
leading to a vote for Belgian or Netherlandic, or no vote if no features of the class were present. The 15 
votes were combined without weighting and the variety with most votes was selected as final result. If 
the varieties had an equal number of votes, Belgian was selected, a heuristic based on some experiments 
within the training data.  

The results of various settings are shown in Table 4. Looking at the processing needed for specific 
features, and taking the overall groups lexical features, tagging features and syntactic features, we see 
that all three groups perform worse than the simple odds addition of all features together. Voting with 
all features, however, outperforms the simple addition. Syntactic features by themselves perform quite 
poorly, and would have ended up at rank 5 in the shared task; lexical and tagging features by themselves 
at rank 3. However,  their combination and the addition of the syntactic features pushes the result sig-
nificantly higher, to rank 2, demonstrating the value of both system combination (widely accepted) and  
syntactic information (not widely accepted). Still, despite access to more informative features, we must 
admit defeat to team Tübingen-Oslo (Çöltekin et al., 2018), who reach a score of 0.6600 using an SVM 
classifier based on character and word n-grams. This we attribute to our choice of recognition method, 
which as already mentioned was based on explanatory power more than recognition power.

6 Distinction Power of Individual Tokens 

Seeing that the Southern and Northern varieties of Dutch can apparently be distinguished to some de-
gree, we would like to know which features contribute to this distinction, in other words what the actual 
differences between the varieties are. In this section, we focus on individual tokens. Not only is this a 
stated focus of the VarDial workshop, but we can also compare the results with our intuitions. The ob-
servations for tokens can later on help in the examination of syntactic features (Section 7). 

Table 5 shows the most useful features for the test set (here correlated features are ignored) and Figure 
3 visually represents the usefulness of all features applied for the test set.1 In both we see that it is

sents the frequency in the training data (on a log scale). The colour represents whether the bias was 
the same in the test data (green) or not (red). Finally, the size represents how useful the feature 
proved in judging the test set (calculated as  (#correct – 3*#incorrect) * odds ).

certainly not only differences in language variety that we are measuring. First of all, we see many proper 
names, with as most striking example Sami, not the Finnish people, but a character from the soap series 
Days of our Lives. She occurs 289 times in the training set and 21 times in the test set, always on the 
Belgian side. On the Netherlandic side, we find the tv show MasterChef, complemented by the word 
gerecht (“dish”). Other words might also be linked to specific content: a remarkable number of police-
connected words, such as melding (“report”), bekeuring (“traffic ticket”) and bestuurder (“driver”) occur 
on the Netherlandic side. Next we have a cluster of all-capital words, such as MUZIEK (“MUSIC”). 
These appear to be descriptions of background noises. They occur mostly on the Netherlandic side, with 
a few exceptions, e.g. ACHTERGRONDMUZIEK (“BACKGROUND MUSIC”) on the Belgian side. 
This too is not related to language variety but more likely to the nature of subtitling in the two branches 
of BTI. The same might be true for the exclamation mark, which together with the semicolon are the 
only C1 features with odds greater than 2 (13.19 and 18.00).  

Figure 4: DFS bias compared to prevalence (Keuleers at al., 2015) for words present in both data 
sets. The horizontal position represents prevalence (z-scores) and the vertical positions 
odds in the DFS training data (log scale). The colour again indicates whether the two 
measurements agree on assigning the corresponding language variety. 

 



207

Still, we also observe words which do seem linked to a specific language variety. Interjections like 
komaan (“come on”) and Oke (“Right”) also intuitively belong to Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, re-
spectively. The same can be said for da’s (“that’s”; Belgian, but probably extending into the South of 
The Netherlands), ie (“he”; Netherlandic) and plots (“suddenly”; Belgian). For the other visible words, 
we do not have clear intuitions. Most of them we will therefore check against another resource in the 
next paragraph. Before that, we want to mention the capitalized Mijn (“my”), which might have a sty-
listic rather than a lexical cause. 

As mentioned in Section 2, Keuleers et al. (2015) provided prevalence measurements for (about 
54,000) Dutch words (downloadable through http://crr.ugent.be/archives/1796). Figure 4 shows the re-
lation between the difference in prevalence in Belgium and The Netherlands (using the irt z-scores also 
preferred by Keuleers et al.; for an explanation, see there) and the odds from our own training data. We 
include all lemmas which a) occur in the prevalence table and b) have odds higher than 2 in our meas-
urements. The visual impression that the two resources agree more often than they disagree is correct: 
they agree 3,717 times (2,628 Netherlandic and 1,089 Belgian) while they disagree 2,060 times. Still, 
they disagree often enough to conclude that, if we accept prevalence as a good indicator of language 
variety bias, the DFS data is inadequate for proper identification of that bias. Furthermore, even high 
odds do not guarantee proper attribution. On the other hand, highly prevalent words do appear to be 
recognized also with the DFS data. Although we did not measure the exact same thing (difference versus 
sum), these observations are consistent with the findings by Keuleers et al. (2015) about the comple-
mentary nature of prevalence and corpus-based frequency counts. 

7 Distinction Power of Syntactic Features 

Our special interest in this experiment lay in syntactic differences between Northern and Southern 
Dutch. Ideally any different uses of syntax would be found by way of highly distinguishing syntactic 
features. However, our observations for the lexical features made us less optimistic. Trying at least to 
avoid syntactic features that were shadows of lexical ones, we filtered the set of syntactic features that 
we would examine: we used only rewrite features appearing in test items where the lexical features led 
to a wrong attribution but the tagging and syntactic features attributed correctly, and from the resulting 
feature list we then removed all syntactic features that were correlated to any lexical features. Upon 
manual inspection of the selected features we found various syntactic constructions that at least in these 
data point to Belgian or Netherlandic authorship. They give us a first handle as regards the potential 
syntactic differences that exist between the two varieties. Further research is needed to establish whether 
these are not just an artefact of the data. Below we present and discuss some of the constructions that 
were identified.  

The use of constructions with anticipatory het were found to be associated with Belgian authorship. 
An example is En het is vanwege jou dat ze deze sessies hebben georganiseerd. (“And it is because of 
you that they have organised these sessions.”). What is striking in the instances that we come across is 
that in all of them the subject complement (here: vanwege jou) is an adverb (wel, niet, dus) or, as in the 
example, a prepositional phrase.  

Coordinations in which dus (“so”) appears in the function of coordinator joining main clauses were 
associated with Netherlandic authorship. An example is er gebeurde niks dus is ze dood. (“nothing hap-
pened so now she is dead.”). All cases share the same structure where a cause, circumstance or reason 
is given in the first conjoin of the coordination and the second conjoin introduced by dus relates the 
consequence(s), result, or the thing(s) that happened next.  

As an apparent feature of Netherlandic Dutch we found that the final conjoin in a coordination is a 
word or phrase equivalent to etcetera. For Dutch we came across enzovoort, et cetera, but also noem 
maar op, as in for example hij weet wel alles over de vissen in de zee over bomen en planten, noem maar 
op. (“he knows everything about the fish in the sea about trees and plants, and what have you”).  

Then there are adverbial clauses in sentence-initial position in monotransitive declarative sentences. 
In standard Dutch in regular declarative sentences with unmarked word order, the subject precedes the 
verb operator. However, when an adverbial occurs sentence-initially, subject and verb operator are in-
verted. For Netherlandic Dutch the occurrence of monotransitive sentences with sentence-initial adver-
bial clauses was found to be a distinctive feature. These initial adverbial clauses included both condi-
tional clauses (typically introduced by als (“if”) as well as temporal adverbial clauses (for example

introduced by nadat (“after”), terwijl (‘while”), or toen (“when”), as in Toen we gingen dansen speelden 
ze dit liedje. (“When we went dancing they played this song.”).  

Another feature associated with Netherlandic Dutch was the use of wh-clauses as direct object. For 
example, U weet dus wat er in zit. (“You know what is in there.”).   

Finally, one more feature typically associated with Belgian Dutch was the use of an imperative clause 
followed by a form of address as for example in Geef hier dat geld, vuile hufter. (“Hand over that money, 
you bastard.”).  

8 Conclusion 

We built a recognition system to distinguish between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch subtitles, as pro-
vided for the DFS shared task at VarDial2018. We used a wide range of features, spanning from character 
n-grams to syntactic rewrites. As our primary goal was to identify features which differed between the 
two language varieties, we used a simple marker-based recognition method, with which we could meas-
ure directly how informative each feature was for the test data. 

As for the participation in the shared task, we can judge our results to be positive. Achieving the 
second place in the ranking shows that even a simple marker-based method can hold its own in a com-
petition which we expected to be dominated by more intricate machine learning methods. We can only 
assume that our wide range of knowledge-inspired features, including fully syntactic ones, made up for 
the weaker method. 

However, as for identifying differences between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, we have to view 
our current results as merely a first step. We did manage to identify some features that appear to be 
biased towards either Belgian or Netherlandic Dutch, but it is as yet unclear if this is because of the 
language variety of the source text. There were too many interfering factors to be sure, such as topic (the 
movie or show the subtitles were from), differing genres (subtitling conventions in the local branches of 
BTI), and processing difficulties (not quite optimally appropriate software, run on not quite clean text). 
Still, we did manage to identify some potential syntactic differences between Belgian and Netherlandic 
Dutch, our main goal, while taking precautions to avoid interference from these factors. As a result, we 
do have a basis for research on further data, in which we can try to confirm our findings.
