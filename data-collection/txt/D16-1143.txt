Abstract

In this paper, we improve microblog users’
demographic prediction by fully utilizing their
video related behaviors. First, we collect the
describing words of currently popular videos,
including video names, actor names and video
keywords, from video websites. Secondly,
we search these describing words in users’
microblogs, and build the direct relationships
between users and the appeared words. After
that, to make the sparse relationship denser,
we propose a Bayesian method to calculate
the probability of connections between users
and other video describing words. Last-
ly, we build two models to predict users’
demographics with the obtained direct and
indirect relationships. Based on a large real-
world dataset, experiment results show that
our method can significantly improve these
words’ demographic predictive ability.

1 Introduction

Recent studies have indicated that users’ demo-
graphics can be predicted from their linguistic
characteristics. A typical practice is cutting the text
into a bag of words and training a linear classifier.
Although this practice can achieve an acceptable
result in simple tasks such as predicting gender and
age, it loses some important information about the
text structure and does not fully use the relationship
between words.

Nowadays, people spend a lot of time on videos
and social media which provide them with access
to post views and comments. Weibo is one of the
biggest microblogging platforms in China. More

than one third of the “Weibo Trends”1 are about
videos. Generally, people with different demograph-
ic attributes usually have different tastes for videos
(Abisheva et al., 2014). For example, in China
people who watch English drama tend to be well-
educated. Here is a question: if the video related
information in users’ weibo messages can be fully
used, will the users’ demographic prediction be
improved?

One challenge is that many users do not directly
mention the video names in their weibo messages.
Instead, they make comments on the actors or
the plots. If a person likes “Big Bang Theory”,
he may post “Will the Big Bang Theory last into
the next century?” where the sitcom’s name is
mentioned directly, or “Sheldon is so cool, I love
him!” which talks about an actor of the sitcom.
Both posts indicate the user is interested in “Big
Bang Theory”. When involving the demographic
prediction, however, the traditional “bag of words
based” model cannot extract the above information
effectively. Some previous works use topic models
such as LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) or LDA
(Blei et al., 2003) to detect the relations among
users’ words. Usually, they suffer from the short
length of weibo messages and the number of topics.
In addition, the lifespan of most popular video
programs is not very long, which renders traditional
topic models inefficient.

Fortunately, there exist some third-party video
websites, such as youtube.com and youku.com, from
which we can get the most popular videos. For each
video, there is usually a homepage with a actor list

1http://d.weibo.com/100803

1359



and also a comments section, and we can calculate
the video’s Top TF-IDF words (keywords) based on
these comments. Here we define the video name,
actor name and keyword to be three different kinds
of “video describing words”. The relationships
among these words can be used to better understand
weibo users’ video related behaviors. This approach
can be applied to other kinds of words, such as
describing words on books and music. This paper
focuses on the video as an example.

After obtaining the video describing words, we
build three matrices to represent the direct and
indirect relationships between weibo users and these
words. They are User-Video Matrix, User-Actor
Matrix and User-Keyword Matrix, respectively. At
beginning, these three matrices are sparse because
they only represent the direct relationships, which
means that only when the words appear in user’s
weibos, the corresponding position will be set. After
that, we propose a “hidden layer” to detect the
indirect relationships, making them denser.

With these indirect relationships, we can improve
users’ demographic predictions, including gender,
age, education background, and marital status. This
paper makes the followings three contributions:

1. By construct three matrices, we detect the
direct and indirect relationships between weibo
users and video describing words.

2. Two models are proposed to predict users’
demographics by using both direct and indirect
relationships.

3. Experiment results prove that our efforts can
significantly improve the predictive accuracy,
compared with the existing research.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the dataset and demographics.
Section 3 introduces how to make full use of video
related behaviors. Section 4 presents experimental
results. Finally, we review related work in Section
5, and draw conclusions in Section 6.

2 Dataset and Demographics

2.1 Dataset
We collected 2,970,642 microblog users from Weibo
(http://weibo.com), the largest microblog service

in China, as our dataset. To avoid spam users
(sometimes called robot users), we only collected
verified users and users followed by verified user.
Weibo conducts manual verifications to make sure
the verified users provide real and authentic profile
information. Table 1 presents four target demo-
graphic attributes and the completion rates (ratio of
effective users). All data is either through Open API
or publicly available. No private data is used in the
experiment.

We also collected 847 popular video programs
from YISQ (4 popular video websites in China:
youku, iqiyi, sohu, qq). These videos mainly fall into
three types: movie, tv play, and variety shows. We
downloaded these videos’ Homepages and extracted
their actors and TOP20 TF-IDF words. The statistics
are shown in Table 2.

2.2 Ground Truth
One problem of our dataset is it contains celebrities,
while our model mainly targets ordinary weibo
users. We implement a filter to exclude celebrities
based on their large numbers of followers (>50000
as default), making the ground truth more represen-
tative. Besides, users with less than 100 messages
are discarded. At last, we obtain 742,323 accounts
with both their demographics and messages.

2.3 Demographics
As Table 1 shows, the demographic attributes con-
cerned in this paper include gender, age, education
background, and marital status:

Gender (Binary): the gender prediction is a
typical binary classification task: male, female.

Age (4-Class): because there is only a handful
of(<1%) user older than 45, we classify users into
the following four age groups: Teenage (<18),
Youngster (18-24), Young (25-34), Mid-age (>34).

Education Background (Binary): we categorize
users’ education background into two groups: uni-
versity, non-university.

Marital Status (Binary): marital status is also
simplified to a binary classification task: single,
non-single.

3 Our Model

In this section, we introduce the framework, which
contains four steps.

Attribute Completion Rate Categories
Gender 95.019% Male, Female

Age 18.604% Teenage (<18), Youngster (18-24), Young (25-34), Mid-age(>34)
Education BG 17.443% University, Non-University
Marital Status 2.203% Single, Non-Single

TV 197 515 1302

Total 847 1422 4094
Table 2: Statics of video relevant information (There is an
overlap between the three collections of actors and keywords.)

The first step generates the “Video describing
words” and represents user as two vectors (Vv, Vo).
Vv consists of user’s “video describing words” and
Vo consists of user’s “other words”. At first, Vv only
contains user’s direct relationships.

Vv: video describing words (direct)
Vo: other words
Va: Vv + Vo

The second step detects the indirect relationships
between users and videos. For example, if a user
mentioned “Robert Downey Jr”, we believe he has
an indirect relationships with “Iron Man” movie. By
doing so, we add user’s indirect relationships into his
Vv, getting a denser vector V ′v .

V ′v : video describing words (direct+indirect)
V ′a: V

′
v + Vo

The third step proposes two models respectively
to evaluate whether those indirect relationships,
discovered in second step, can be used to develop
a more accurate prediction model.

The fourth step represents weibo user with the
combination of V ′v and Vo, and use the combination
to train a linear SVM to evaluate whether this effort
can make the prediction better.

3.1 Discover Indirect Relationships
If a user mentioned a video’s name directly, we
believe there is a direct relationship between them.
The rests are unobvious relationships. In this part,

we calculate whether these unobvious relationships
can be transformed into indirect ones.

3.1.1 User-Video Matrix

Firstly, we detect whether a user directly men-
tioned a video program in his weibo messages.
There are two scenarios: the first is this user posts
a message containing the video’s name directly, and
the other is this user reposts a message containing
the video’s name. In this paper, we believe these two
scenarios both indicate there is a direct relationship
between the user and the video, and do not make a
distinction between them. Till now, we construct a
Direct User-Video Matrix (DUVM) to denote all the
direct relationships between users and videos.

Step 1: We know each video program vn contains
some actors anj and keywords wni. We can
calculate P (vn), P (anj |vn) and P (wni|vn) in Step
1. P (vn) represents the probability that a person
has watched the nth video. P (wni|vn) represents
the probability that a person, who has watched the
nth video, mention the nith keyword. P (anj |vn) is
the probability that a person, who has watched the
nth video, mention the njth actor.

P (vn) = num (users watched the nth video) /
num (users)

P (wni|vn) = num (users watched the nth video
and mentioned the nith keyword) / num (users
watched the nth video)

P (anj |vn) = num (users watched the nth video
and mentioned the njth actor) / num (users watched
the nth video)

Step 2: In step 2, If a user doesn’t mention a
video’s name directly, but mentions the video’s relat-
ed actors (Ak) and keywords (Wm), we can update
his unobvious user-video relationships according to
a Bayesian framework.

1361



Figure 1: (1) At first, identify the describing words from users microblogs, which builds the direct relationships between users and
these words. (2) By construct three matrices, we detect the indirect relationships between weibo users and video describing words.

(3)Two models are proposed to predict users demographics by using both direct and indirect relationships.

P (vn|Wm, Ak) =
P (Wm, Ak|vn) ∗ P (vn)

P (Wm, Ak)

=

∏
wni∈Wm P (wni|vn) ∗

∏
anj∈Ak P (anj |vn) ∗ P (vn)

P (Wm, Ak)
(1)

Through Step 2, we can discover some new
indirect relationships and update UVM. Go back to
Step 1 and iterate until converges, we can get the
Final UVM at last.

3.1.2 User-Actor Matrix
Every video program has several actors, and the

relationships between weibo users and actors may
contribute to the demographic prediction either. So
we build the UAM, where each row represents a
weibo user and each column represents an actor.

There are two case that the element of UAM will
be set to true: (1) the user ‘i’ directly mentioned
actor ‘j’ in his weibo messages (including post and
repost); (2) the user ‘i’ has watched video ‘v’, and
actor ‘j’ participate in video ‘v’. The second case
needs UVM’s help. We suppose these two cases
affect the value equally in this paper.

3.1.3 User-Keyword Matrix
We can find several keywords to describe each

video from their Homepages. For instance, we

get “Paul Walker”, “fight”, and “car” to describe
“Furious 7”.

Each row of UKM represents a weibo user and
each column represents a keyword of a certain video.
(1) If we find a user has watched the “Furious 7”, no
matter direct or indirect relationship, we can set the
columns of user’s “Furious 7” keywords to true. (2)
The value can be set to true either if the user directly
mentioned these keywords.

3.2 Two Indirect Relationship Based Models

In this part, two models are proposed to predict user-
s’ demographics by using both direct and indirect
relationships.

3.2.1 Discriminant Model (Dis-Model)
Given three matrices, the intuitive way to predict

users’ demographics is using Collaborative Filter-
ing. However, finding the similar users directly
based on the vector similarity is not a good idea,
because a substantial part of users have ever watched
no more than 10 videos. Matrix Factorization has
been proven useful to address data sparsity, for
the reduced orthogonal dimensions are less noisy
than the original data and can capture the latent
associations between users and videos. In our
Dis-Model, we utilize the factorization machines
(Rendle, 2010) to deal with UVM, UAM, and
UKM, reducing the length of user’s dimensionality
from videos’ number (actors’ number, keywords’

number) to a smaller value K. Every weibo user can
be represented by the combination of these three K-
length vectors.

Over the last several decades, many kinds of
discriminant classifier have been created. For
our four tasks, we compared Logistic Regression
(LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient
Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT). Figure 2 illustrates
their performance, where GBDT performs the best
in all K values. When K increases from 5 to 20, all
classifiers’ results are all getting better and tend to
be stable when K is bigger than 20. So we choose
GBDT as our default base classifier and K=20 as
default value.

3.2.2 Generative Model (Gen-Model)
We start with introducing an important concept:

video demographic tendency, which means to what
extent a video belongs to a specified demographic
group. For example, if 90% audiences of a movie are
males, we define its demographic tendency on male
as 90%. The actor tendency and keyword tendency
can be calculated in the same way.

In the Gen-Model, (1) we firstly calculate each
video’s (actor, keyword) demographic tendency ac-
cording to its audiences (known demographics).
(2) Based on the demographic tendency of videos
(actors, keywords), we predict user’s (unknown)
demographics via a Bayesian method. (3) At last,
we propose a smooth step to adjust the result.

(1) Calculate video demographic tendency
At first, we calculate every video demographic

tendency as Equation 2:

p(c|vj) =
∑n

i=1(rij ∗ ui(c))∑n
i=1 rij

(2)

P (c|vj) represents the jth video’s demographic
tendency on c, where c is the demographic attribute.
rij will be set to 1 if the ith user has watched the
jth video, otherwise set to 0. ui(c) is a boolean,
representing whether the ith user has the attribute c.

(2) Calculate user demographic attribute
In this step, we predict users’ demographics

according to the demographic tendency of the videos
they has watched. Suppose user’s viewing habits
are independent, we can calculate the probability of
P (c|ui) as Equation 3:

P (c|ui) ∝ P (c|{V })
∝ P ({V }|c) ∗ P (c)
∝

∏

vj∈{V }
P (vj |c) ∗ P (c)

=

∏
vj∈{V } P (c|vj) ∗ P (vj)

P (c)
∗ P (c)

∝
∏

vj∈{V }
P (c|vj)

(3)

{V } represents the collection of videos watched
by ui. P (c|vj) is the jth video’s demographic
tendency on c, as the previous part described.

(3) Smooth the result
Based on the fact that people in same demograph-

ic group may have similar behaviors, we deploy a
smooth component to adjust the value of P (c|vj)
and P (c|ui) according to their top n neighbors. As
mentioned above, we use factorization machines
to transform the user and video vectors into low-
dimensional (K=20) ones. The distance is cal-
culated by Euclidean Distance. The video, actor,
and word have the same treating process, so we
introduce the video as representative.

Smooth the Video’s Demographic Tendency: Base
on video vj’s top n neighbors, we can calcu-
late its neighbors’ average demographic tendency
P (c|nbr(vj)), where P (c|vnbj) is vj’s nbjth neigh-
bor’s demographic tendency.

1363



p(c|nbr(vj)) =
∑n

j=1 P (c|vnbj)
n

(4)

Therefore, we can smooth vj’s demographic
tendency by:

P (c|vj) = α ∗ P (c|vj) + (1− α) ∗ P (c|nbr(vj)) (5)

α is the parameter to control the top n neighbors’
influence. In this paper, we compared ten values of
α and chose 0.7 as default. With the same process,
n is set to 10 as default.

Smooth the User’s Demographic Result: The user
side smooth procedure is similar to the video side,
except user’s P (c|nbr(ui)) is affected by three kinds
of neighbors (unbvi, unbai, unbwi).

p(c|nbr(ui)) =
∑n

i=1 P (c|unbvi)
3n

+

∑n
i=1 P (c|unbai)

3n

+

∑n
i=1 P (c|unbwi)

3n
(6)

Just like video’s smooth process, we adjust ui’s
demographic attributes by:

P (c|ui) = α ∗ P (c|ui) + (1− α) ∗ P (c|nbr(ui)) (7)

The smooth component is deployed as an iterative
procedure, and keeps running until each P (c|ui)
became stable.

Two Baselines: To validate whether those indi-
rect relationships can improve the predictions, we
build two baseline models: Dis-Baseline and Gen-
Baseline. While our two models use the V ′v as input,
these two baseline models use the raw Vv. These two
baseline models adopt the same architecture with
our proposed two models. The only difference is the
input data.

3.3 Fusion Model
As described above, we discovered the indirect
relationships between users and video describing
words, and demonstrated this effort can leading a
better result than directly train the classifier.

Figure 3: Tendency of User-Video relationship number.

But pre-existing models commonly utilize all the
words in user’s weibo messages. So we need to find
out whether our hard-earned improvement would be
submerged by those “Non video describing words”.
We train a Fusion Model using all the words in
weibo messages and indirect relationships together,
and compare it with a baseline model, who only use
all the words (without indirect relationships).

Fusion Baseline: Many pre-existing methods
(Burger et al., 2011; Tu et al., 2015) chose linear
model as their text classifier, for linear model is
suitable for text categorization tasks. We choose
L1-regularized linear SVM as our Fusion Model
and Fusion-Baseline’s classifier. The only difference
between them is the input data (V ′v + Vo vs Vv + Vo).

4 Experiment Results

We conducted a 10-fold cross validation to demon-
strate our framework’s effectiveness, where 8 parts
for training, 1 parts for validation and 1 parts for
testing by default. The performance of presented
methods were evaluated using the Precision, Recall
and Macro-F1 measures. Binary classification tasks
were also measured by Area Under the ROC Curve
(AUC).

4.1 Indirect Relationships Evaluation

In our dataset, each user directly mention 2.6 video
programs on average and only 0.7% has more than
10 direct relationships. As shown in Figure 3, more
and more indirect relationships arise along with the
iterations. User’s relationship number (direct +
indirect) stabilized at 5.7 on average and 13% of
them is bigger than 10.

To answer whether these indirect relationships

can make the prediction better, we compared our two
models (Dis-Model & Gen-Model) with two base-
line models. We also compared their performance
on different user groups categorized by user-video
relationship number.

Gender: As Table 3 shows, our two models
both have a significant improvement compared to
the baseline models. The Gen-Model achieve the
best performance (AUC 0.825) in terms of all the
measurement. As Figure 4(a) shows, with the
number growth, our two models’ AUC scores are
both getting better. Surprisingly, when the number
is bigger than 10, the Gen-Model even get a similar
performance of the model using all of the user’s
words.

Age: In the age task, our two models both
outperformed the baseline models significantly, and
the generative model performs better (F1 0.654) too.
We analyzed the result and found the “youngster”
and “young” share the similar watching habits in
Weibo. It’s hard to pick out a 23 years old user from
the 28 years old group. As Figure 4(b) shows, our
two models’ F1 scores are both getting better along
with the growth of user-video relationship number.

Education Background: Not surprisingly, our
two models obviously outperform the result over
two baseline models. This result indicates that

people in different education background has visible
different tastes on video programs.

Marital Status: Table 3 presents the results of
marital status. We notice that the performance of
our two model is still reasonable, but is worse than
gender and education tasks. In addition to that this
task is more difficulty, another reason is when a user
gets married, he might not update the information in
his online profile.

Remark: Experiment results show that our
method can significantly improve these words’
demographic predictive ability by more than 15%
on average. 10 videos is good enough to portray a
weibo user, and can achieve reasonable results in
these 4 inference tasks. The video related behavior
is efficient on predicting gender and education, for
people on these two tasks have visible different
inclinations. Inferring age and marital status is not
easy, but our two models still achieve reasonable
improvements. In general, our two models both
get significantly better results than baselines. The
Gen-Model is a better choice by contrast.

4.2 Fusion Model Evaluation

After we obtained the potential predictive ability
of indirect relationships, we also need to find out
whether it can help pre-existing model perform

better. We compare the Fusion Baseline (Vv+Vo)
with our Fusion Model (V ′v+Vo). As Figure 5 shows,
Fusion Model’s performance is better than Fusion
Baseline’s in all four tasks. The improvement is
about 2-3% on average. As above mentioned, our
approach can be applied to other kinds of words,
such as describing words on books and music. So
there is some room for improvement.

5 Related work

In this section, we briefly review the research works
related to our work.

Many researches (Kumar and Tomkins, 2010;
Goel et al., 2012) found users belong to different
demographic groups behave differently. (Hu et
al., 2007; Murray and Durrell, 2000; Goel et
al., 2012; Kosinski et al., 2012) showed that age,
gender, education level, and even personality can
be predicted from people’s webpage browsing logs.
(Kosinski et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2013;
Youyou et al., 2015) showed computers’ judgments
of people’s personalities based on their Facebook
Likes are more accurate and valid than judgments
made by their close acquaintances. (Malmi and
Weber, 2016) showed users’ demographics also can

be predicted based on theirs apps. Apart from the
browsing behaviors, there also exist some works
based on user’s linguistic characteristics. (Schler
et al., 2006) analyzed tens of thousands of blogs
and indicated significant differences in writing style
and word usage between different gender and age
groups. The similar result also showed in (Luyckx

There are some works (Bi et al., 2013; Weber
and Jaimes, 2011; Weber and Castillo, 2010) on
predicting search engine user’s demographics based
on their search queries. (Hovy, 2015) investigated
the influence of user’s demographics on better
understanding their online reviews. (Otterbacher,
2010) used logistic regression model to infer users
gender based on the content of movie reviews.

Many researches focused on the twitter users.
In the Author Profiling task at PAN 2015 (Rangel
et al., 2015), participants approached the task of
identifying age, gender and personality traits from
Twitter. (Nguyen et al., 2013) explored users’ age
prediction task based on their tweets, achieving
better performance than humans. (Burger et al.,
2011) studied the gender predictive ability of twitter
linguistic characteristics, reached 92% accuracy.
(Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011) proposed a GB-
DT model to predict users’ age, gender, political
orientation and ethnicity by leveraging their observ-
able information. (Culotta et al., 2015) predicted
the demographics of Twitter users based on whom
they follow, and (Zhong et al., 2015) predicted the
microblog user’s demographic attributes only by
their chick-ins. In (Li et al., 2014), job and education
attributes are extracted by combining a rule based
approach with a probabilistic system. There are
also some works based on users’ social relationships

6 Conclusion

Our motivation on writing this paper is user’s
video related behavior is usually under-utilized on
demographic prediction tasks. With the help of
third-party video sites, we detect the direct and
calculate the indirect relationships between users
and video describing words, and demonstrate this
effort can improve the accuracy of users’ demo-
graphic predictions. To our knowledge, this is the
first work which explores demographic prediction
by fully using users’ video describing words. This
framework has good scalability and can be applied
on other concrete features, such as user’s book
reading behaviors and music listening behaviors.
