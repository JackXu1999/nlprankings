Keynote: Language Adaptation

As we all know, more and more of life is now manifested online,
and many of the digital traces that are left by human activity are in-
creasingly recorded in natural-language format. This availability offers
us the opportunity to glean user-modeling information from individual
users’ linguistic behaviors. This talk will discuss the particular phe-
nomenon of individual language adaptation, both in the short term
and in the longer term. We’ll look at connections between how people
adapt their language to particular conversational partners or groups,
on the one hand, and on the other hand, those people’s relative power
relationships, quality of relationship with the conversational partner,
and propensity to remain a part of the group.
