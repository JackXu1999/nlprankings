 Abstract 

We introduce our approach to apply ma-
chine translation to psychology, especial-
ly to translate English adjectives in a 
psychological personality questionnaire. 
We first extend seed English personality 
adjectives with a word2vec model trained 
with web sentences, and then feed the 
acquired words to a phrase-based ma-
chine translation model. We use Moses 
trained with bilingual corpora that consist 
of TED subtitles, movie’ subtitles and 
Wikipedia. We collect Japanese transla-
tions whose translation probabilities are 
higher than .01 and filter them based on 
human evaluations. This resulted in 507 
Japanese personality descriptors. We 
conducted a web-survey (N=17,751) and 
finalized a personality questionnaire. Sta-
tistical analyses supported the five-factor 
structure, reliability and criterion-validity 
of the newly developed questionnaire. 
This shows the potential applicability of 
machine translation to psychology. We 
discuss further issues related to machine 
translation application to psychology. 

1 Introduction 
This study introduces an example of the 
application of machine translation (MT) to 
psychology for academic research purposes. 
Translation is a critical part in psychological 
studies using questionnaires. Developing 
psychologically equivalent questionnaires across 
languages and cultures involves careful 
consideration and requires good knowledge of

both the source and target languages and 
familiarity in psychological theories and 
concepts. The construction process requires 
conceptual equivalence as well as semantic 
equivalence (Herdman et al., 1998). Considering 
a typical phrase in an English questionnaire, “he 
is open to experiences,” for example, it is not 
difficult to understand with a proficiency in 
English, but it is a difficult task to translate this 
description of personality in simple and 
intuitively understandable words (semantic 
equivalence), because “open” in Japanese is not 
used with abstract words. In addition, the 
translated items must reflect similar 
psychological concepts among Japanese 
respondents (conceptual equivalence).  

The lists of English personality adjectives are 
generally difficult to translate because of their 
semantic ambiguities. For example, a typical per-
sonality adjective, “complex,” has four mean-
ings in the online Cambridge English dictionary1 : 
Having a lot of different but related parts, being 
difficult to understand because of relatedness of 
parts, building, and bad feeling. In addition, mul-
tiple translations are listed in the Weblio English-
Japanese dictionary2 for each meaning. In the 
Japanese version of the Ten Item Personality In-
ventory (TIPI-J; Oshio et al., 2012), 
“complex” is translated as “変わった考えを
持つ”/having unique ideas. It is difficult to judge 
to what extent the translation reflects on “com-
plex.” Furthermore, “変わった” has nuances of 
odd and strange in Japanese.  

Therefore, it is often difficult to find adequate 
words that satisfy both conceptual and semantic 
equivalence. To resolve the issue, we use word 
embeddings and phrase-based statistical machine 
translation to translate English personality adjec-
tives into Japanese. We regard a bag of personali-

ty related words as covering the concepts. The 
translated results should reflect the equivalent 
concepts and semantics. 

2 Related Work 
2.1 Big-Five 
Big-Five is one of the most widely used 
frameworks to understand human universal 
personality (e.g., McCrae and Costa, 1997). It 
assumes that human individual differences in 
personality are describable in five broad traits; 
Extraversion (extraverted, sociable, and 
talkative), Agreeableness (cooperative, agreeable, 
and warm), Conscientiousness (self-disciplined, 
well-prepared, and self-motivated), Neuroticism 
(anxious and emotional), and Openness-to-
Experiences (analytic, creative, and curious)3. 

The framework comes from the lexical ap-
proach. Researchers collected adjectives that de-
scribe human personality from dictionaries, re-
peated human evaluations and identified the five-
factor structure (e.g., Goldberg, 1992; Norman, 
1963). 

2.2 Translation of Big-Five Questionnaires 
into Japanese 

For Japanese, two previous studies were devoted 
to obtaining adequate translations of personality 
adjectives. Wada (1996) listed all the translations 
of the 300 English personality-like adjectives in 
Adjective Checklist (Gough and Heilbrun, 1983), 
referring to an English-Japanese dictionary. She 
constructed the Big Five Scale (BFS) with 60 
items evaluated by university students. Another 
study was conducted by Oshio et al. (2012). 
They translated the Ten Item Personality 
Inventory and evaluated the items five times by 
means of respondent surveys (TIPI, Gosling et al., 
2003). They also asked the original authors if the 
backward translation appropriately reflected the 
five original personality concepts. The final 
Japanese version of the TIPI (TIPI-J) used 
relatively long and explanatory phrases as 
translations of simple English adjectives.  

2.3 Automatic Translation of Personality 
Adjectives 

Ueda et al. (2016) introduced an approach to 
acquire the Japanese translations of English 
personality adjectives. They used 20 personality 

                                                
3 In the following sections, Extraversion is abbreviated as 
EX, Agreeableness as AG, Conscientiousness as CO, Neu-
roticism as NE, and Openness-to-Experiences as OP. 

adjectives derived from TIPI (Gosling et al., 
2003) and acquired words related to these 
adjectives, using a word2vec model trained with 
50 million web-sentences. Having personality 
adjectives in a bilingual corpus, they searched for 
bilingual corpora and combined the three 
bilingual corpora, 0.2 million TED subtitles, 1.2 
million movie subtitles, and 0.4 million 
Wikipedia sentences.  Iwai et al. (2017) selected 
109 candidates from the list by Ueda et al. (2016) 
and conducted a web-survey with 500 young and 
500 older adults. They identified the five-factor 
structure in both young and older samples. 
Although they planned to use four words per trait, 
they found only three words for EX and AG, and 
two words for CO. The numbers were 
unsatisfactory to construct a personality 
questionnaire. In this study, we improve the 
procedure to acquire the translation candidates 
and finalize the 20-item personality questionnaire. 

3 Automatic Translation of Personality 
Adjectives 

In this section, we introduce our method to 
translate psychological questionnaires.  

3.1 Preparation for Bilingual Corpus 
As a previous study (Ueda et al., 2016), to limit 
the scope to daily life contexts, we combine the 
bilingual corpora of TED talks, movie subtitles, 
and Wikipedia. The size is, however, slightly 
larger than Ueda et al. (2016), 2.1 million sen-
tences, 0.3 million sentences more; TED4 (0.2 
million sentences), movie subtitles5 (1.5 million 
sentences), and Wikipedia (0.4 million sentences, 
Chu et al., 2016). 

3.2 Acquisition of Words Similar to Person-
ality Adjectives. 

In addition to TIPI (Gosling et al., 2013), we 
prepare the personality adjectives derived from 
Goldberg (1992) (Table 1). We feed the English 
personality adjectives to the word2vec6  model 
trained with 50 million English web-sentences. 
The adjectives are, however, abstract and poly-
semous, and not necessarily limited to describe 
personality. We, thus, combine from two to four 
words to generate the averaged vectors within the 
same trait, in addition to feeding one adjective to

the model and list the related words when cosine 
similarities are higher than .2. In the case of re-
lated words with multiple factors, each word is 
associated with the trait that has the highest simi-
larity. “Arrogant”, for example, is similar to both 
AG minus and CO minus.  In this case, the simi-
larity to AG minus is higher (.783) than CO mi-
nus (.354), as such, we associate “arrogant” with 
AG minus. 

As a result, we acquired a total of 200 unique 
candidate words in total. The list includes the 
words that are not in either Goldberg (1992) or 
Gosling et al. (2003), such as courageous, playful, 
and thoughtful. 

3.3 Automatic Translation 
Referring to Ueda et al. (2016), we also use the 
phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-
tem, Moses7.  Table 1 indicates examples of 
translation results. Using the bilingual corpora in 
section 3.1, we developed a phrase table and ex-
tracted 728 unique translations of the personality 
adjectives-related words in the table with more 
than a .01 translation probability.  

Filtering: We filter translations and merge 
variant expressions by using a Japanese mor-
pheme analyzer JUMAN++8 and a Japanese de-
pendency and case structure analyzer KNP9. For 
filtering, we refer to parts of speech and infor-
mation in JUMAN++ dictionaries and collect the 
translations under the conditions of content 
words, either adjectives, verbs or nouns and are 
not humans, because conjunctions and dummy 
nouns are also in the table. Furthermore, this 
procedure makes it possible to merge expression 
varieties such as 落ち着く and 落ち着いている 
into 落ち着く. The procedures result in 631 
translations.  

Human evaluations: In spite of filtering, the 
automatic filtering fails to exclude translations 
unrelated to personality. Such translation errors 
include mainly those presumingly caused by 
alignment errors. The errors, for example, are  綿
花/cotton as the translation of  “indifferent,” 耳/ 
ear for “stubborn,”  and 訪米/visit to the United 
States for “anxious”. As a result, we regard 507 
translations as personality descriptors (80.3 %).  

Comparisons with previous studies: Merg-
ing the 109 personality descriptors in Iwai et al. 
(2017) and the above 507 ones results in a total

of 559 unique personality descriptors. A total of 
52 personality descriptors are unique in Iwai et al. 
(2017) and 450 are unique in the current list 
while 57 personality descriptors are in common. 
Newly-acquired translations include 積極/ “ac-
tive” and 陽気だ/ “cheerful” while おとなしい/ 
“silent” and 内向的だ/ “introverted,” for exam-
ple, do not appear at this time.  

The personality descriptor rate is similar to the 
previous study by Iwai et al. (2017) (81.0%). 
However, we acquire more varieties of personali-
ty descriptors that were not enough in the previ-
ous studies.  

4 Development and Evaluations of a 
Japanese Personality Questionnaire 

To select the twenty-items, we conducted a web-
survey and statistical analysis to identify the five-
factor structure, calculate reliability, and examine 
validity. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a 
statistical approach to extract common factors 
across measured variables based on correlation 
coefficients (Fabrigar et al., 1999). In 
constructing a psychological questionnaire, it is 
important to evaluate reliability and validity. 
Reliability indicates how responses are reliably 
produced. Internal consistency assumes that a 
person tends to similarly answer items within the 
same trait, which Cronbach’s α indicates 
(Cronbach, 1951). Furthermore, a psychological 
questionnaire must measure the targeted concepts, 
which is named as validity. One method to assess 
validity is criterion-validity. Criterion-validity 
investigates correlations between the latent 
variables in the newly constructed questionnaire 
and the corresponding latent variables in a 
“criterion” questionnaire. The correlations are 
expected to be high between similar latent 
variables and low between unrelated latent 
variables. We use TIPI-J (Oshio et al., 2012) for 
this validity evaluation. 

4.1 Web-Survey 
Participants: We conducted a web-survey on 

registrants of the Human Information Database 
by NTT Data Institute of Management Consult-
ing, Inc in October 2016 (N=17,751, Fe-
male=11,037, Mean=49.8 years old, SD=13.4).    

Tested Items: To conduct a web-survey, two 
psychologists (the first and the third authors) se-
lected and modified the translations into ques-
tionnaire-item formats. We had limited resources 
and only 51 items were testable. In addition to 
the 18 items from Iwai et al. (2017), we, thus, 

Proceedings of MT Summit XVII, volume 2 Dublin, Aug. 19-23, 2019 | p. 26



reviewed the list carefully and selected 33 items 
acquired from the list in Section 3.3. We basical-
ly attempted to choose words that are not in Iwai 
et al. (2017) and from EX plus (e.g., 陽気だ/ 
“cheerful” and 積極/ “active”), AG minus (e.g., 
横柄だ/ “arrogant” and 傲慢だ/ “arrogant”), 
CO plus (e.g., 公正だ/ “fair” and 正直だ/ “hon-
est”), NE minus (e.g., 安らかだ/ “peaceful” and 
のんきだ/ “carefree”), and OP minus (e.g., 単純
だ/ “simplistic” and 浅い/ “unsophisticated”).  

OP minus translations are especially difficult. 
The OP minus adjectives mainly consist of the 
adjectives with an “un” prefix. As a result, we 
have a very limited number of candidate words 
in OP minus. “浅い,”an example of translation 
of “unsophistication,” literally means shallow, is 
modified into 興味が浅い/ “have an shallow 
interest.” 

Participants completed the 51 items, using a 
seven-point scale from 1= strongly disagree to 7 
=strongly agree.  

Ten Item Personality Inventory-Japanese 
(TIPI-J): Participants also completed another 
Big-Five questionnaire, TIPI-J (Gosling et al., 
2003; Oshio et al., 2012) using a seven-point 
scale (EX: M= 7.4, SD=2.3, α10=.49; AG: M= 9.5, 
SD=2.0, α=.37; CO: M= 8.2, SD= 2.2, α=.51; NE: 
M= 7.9, SD=2.1, α=.46; OP M= 8.0, SD=2.1,  
α=.39).  

4.2 Results 
Selection of twenty-items: We repeated the 

exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using a maxi-
mum likelihood with robust standard errors 
method with a geomin rotation11 to select the 
twenty items (four items for each factor). Based 
on the first EFA with the 51 items, we eliminated 
the 9 items that loaded highly on multiple factors. 
Next, we conducted the second EFA with the 41 
items, reviewed the loading matrix, and selected 
four items for each trait based on the following 
standards: An item (1) which loading was over 
|.50| and (2) the secondary loading did not ex-
ceed |.35|. In the cases that a trait failed to ac-
quire four items in reference on the standards, we 
selected the items by loading. Selecting AG 
items, however, was not straightforward.  Alt-
hough “安らか/peaceful” indicated high load 
ing in AG, the word caused confusion because it 
is often used to describe facial expressions or

mood, rather than personality. “ 協 力 的
/cooperative”seemed more acceptable among 
the other candidates in terms of semantics. We, 
thus, conducted the two patterns of EFA using 
the 20 items. The model fit indices were slightly 
better in the “安らか/peaceful” version but 
had very small differences (CFI12 = .978 vs. .972, 
TLI13=.958 vs. 947, RMSEA14=.029 vs. .033)15 
and the factor loading patterns were similar. We, 
thus, decided to finalize the 20-items including 
“協力的.” Table 2 indicates the twenty-words 
in the items. We name the questionnaire as Trait 
Descriptors Personality Inventory (TDPI).  

Descriptive Statistics and Reliability: We 
calculated descriptive statistics for each trait and 
internal consistency (EX: M= 15.9, SD=4.2,

TLI > .900, RMSEA < .05 (Marsh et al., 2009).

α=.82;AG: M= 17.8, SD=2.0, α=.78;CO: M= 
17.9,  SD= 4.2, α=.79;NE: M= 15.9, SD=4.2, 
α=.66;OP M= 17.8, SD=3.4, α=.74). Cronbach’s 
αs were substantial. The means of correlation 
coefficients between the traits were quite low 
(the mean r=.22), which indicates that each trait 
was differentiated from other traits.  

Criterion-validity. We calculated correlation 
coefficients of trait scores in TDPI with those in 
TIPI-J (Figure 1). The means of correlation coef-
ficients between the same traits were high (r =.58 
~.68). On the other hand, the means of not-
corresponding correlation coefficients were low 
(r=.25). The results indicate that the two ques-
tionnaires measure similar psychological factors 
and differentiate the similar factors from the fac-
tors that are hypothesized as different ones. 

5 Discussion 
The results of the web-survey show applicability 
of MT to psychological studies, i.e., using MT to 
extracting candidate entries. However, we find 
three issues which need to be considered.  

5.1 Limited Resources 
The translation probability has a limited role in 
the procedure.  Overall, translation probabilities 
are relatively low. Only 138 of 631 translations 
indicate more than a .1 translation probability. 
Furthermore, most of the errors are alignment 
errors. Such errors imply that the bilingual cor-
pus does not include enough translations of per-
sonality descriptors. The present study focuses 
on personality. However, there are many psycho-
logical questionnaires with English adjectives 
such as values (Schwartz et al., 2003) and inter-
personal relationships (Fletcher et al., 2003). We 
expect that such contextual matters and not 
enough resources are the shared issue for those 
who are interested in using MT in practical usage.  

5.2 Replicability and Stability 
While this study indicates applicability to 
questionnaire development in psychology, it 
entails the issue of replicability and stability due 
to choices of a mono-lingual corpus for word 
embeddings. Our study uses the same size corpus 
for word embeddings as Iwai et al. (2017) did. 
However, 47.2 % of the translations are not 
replicated in the current study. Out of the final 20 
items, the 5 items are in the previous study, the 7 
items only from this study, and 8 items are in 
common.  

Inconsistent replicability is not due to transla-
tion. Our procedure is phrase-based and we use 
the extended bilingual corpus of Iwai et al. 
(2017).  Even if we ignore translation probabili-
ties and review all the results, many of them are 
not in the list. This indicates that different per-
sonality adjectives-related words were fed into 
Moses, because all the phrases in English are 
aligned to the particular phrases in Japanese. 
However, the translations peculiar in the previ-
ous studies are also good as personality de-
scriptors and some of them remain as the final 
items.  

As the current study suggests, it is better to 
acquire substantial candidates with limited re-
sources as in Section 5.1 and it is better to repeat 
the procedures.  

5.3 Expert Knowledge 
The two previous issues are all solved by using 
the psychologists’ expert knowledge. The 
previous studies (Iwai et al., 2017; Ueda et al., 
2016) and this study demonstrate that word 
embeddings and MT allow researchers to collect 
personality-related English words and Japanese 
translation candidates and such candidates are 
tolerable to use as psychological items with 
expert knowledge. On the other hand, it is still 
just at the beginning of the step to implement MT 
into psychological studies. It is highly 
appreciated that the manual parts are reduced and 
replaced with technical improvements in NLP 
and MT.  

6 Conclusions 
MT allowed us to collect candidates of Japanese 
personality descriptors. We manage to construct 
a new personality questionnaire that consists of 
only MT-extracted words. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the only personality measure-
ment developed using Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) techniques such as word embed-
dings and phrase-based statistical MT. The ques-
tionnaire is practically usable in psychological 
studies. The study provides evidence to extend 
applicability of MT to another research field. On 
the other hand, the expert knowledge is critical, 
at least, in the target language and culture, to de-
sign a questionnaire and items. Such experts’ 
efforts are expected to be reduced with more ad-
equate parallel corpora and further examination 
to justify word embeddings.
