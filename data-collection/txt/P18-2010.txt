Abstract

We use dependency triples automatically
extracted from a Web-scale corpus to per-
form unsupervised semantic frame induc-
tion. We cast the frame induction problem
as a triclustering problem that is a gen-
eralization of clustering for triadic data.
Our replicable benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed graph-based approach,
Triframes, shows state-of-the art results on
this task on a FrameNet-derived dataset
and performing on par with competitive
methods on a verb class clustering task.

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen much work on Frame Se-
mantics (Fillmore, 1982), enabled by the availabil-
ity of a large set of frame definitions, as well as
a manually annotated text corpus provided by the
FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998). FrameNet
data enabled the development of wide-coverage
frame parsers using supervised learning (Gildea
and Jurafsky, 2002; Erk and Padó, 2006; Das et al.,
2014, inter alia), as well as its application to a
wide range of tasks, ranging from answer extrac-
tion in Question Answering (Shen and Lapata,
2007) and Textual Entailment (Burchardt et al.,
2009; Ben Aharon et al., 2010).

However, frame-semantic resources are ar-
guably expensive and time-consuming to build due
to difficulties in defining the frames, their gran-
ularity and domain, as well as the complexity of
the construction and annotation tasks requiring
expertise in the underlying knowledge. Conse-
quently, such resources exist only for a few lan-
guages (Boas, 2009) and even English is lack-
ing domain-specific frame-based resources. Pos-
sible inroads are cross-lingual semantic annota-
tion transfer (Padó and Lapata, 2009; Hartmann

et al., 2016) or linking FrameNet to other lexical-
semantic or ontological resources (Narayanan
et al., 2003; Tonelli and Pighin, 2009; Laparra and
Rigau, 2010; Gurevych et al., 2012, inter alia).
But while the arguably simpler task of PropBank-
based Semantic Role Labeling has been success-
fully addressed by unsupervised approaches (Lang
and Lapata, 2010; Titov and Klementiev, 2011),
fully unsupervised frame-based semantic annota-
tion exhibits far more challenges, starting with the
preliminary step of automatically inducing a set of
semantic frame definitions that would drive a sub-
sequent text annotation. In this work, we aim at
overcoming these issues by automatizing the pro-
cess of FrameNet construction through unsuper-
vised frame induction techniques.

Triclustering. In this work, we cast the frame
induction problem as a triclustering task (Zhao
and Zaki, 2005; Ignatov et al., 2015), namely
a generalization of standard clustering and bi-
clustering (Cheng and Church, 2000), aiming at
simultaneously clustering objects along three di-
mensions (cf. Table 1). First, using tricluster-
ing allows to avoid sequential nature of frame in-
duction approaches, e.g. (Kawahara et al., 2014),
where two independent clusterings are needed.
Second, benchmarking frame induction as triclus-
tering against other methods on dependency triples
allows to abstract away the evaluation of the frame
induction algorithm from other factors, e.g., the in-
put corpus or pre-processing steps, thus allowing
a fair comparison of different induction models.



56

The contributions of this paper are three-fold:
(1) we are the first to apply triclustering algo-
rithms for unsupervised frame induction, (2) we
propose a new approach to triclustering, achiev-
ing state-of-the-art performance on the frame in-
duction task, (3) we propose a new method for the
evaluation of frame induction enabling straight-
forward comparison of approaches. In this paper,
we focus on the simplest setup with subject-verb-
object (SVO) triples and two roles, but our evalu-
ation framework can be extended to more roles.

In contrast to the recent approaches like the one
by Jauhar and Hovy (2017), our approach induces
semantic frames without any supervision, yet cap-
turing only two core roles: the subject and the
object of a frame triggered by verbal predicates.
Note that it is not generally correct to expect that
the SVO triples obtained by a dependency parser
are necessarily the core arguments of a predicate.
Such roles can be implicit, i.e., unexpressed in a
given context (Schenk and Chiarcos, 2016). Keep-
ing this limitation in mind, we assume that the
triples obtained from a Web-scale corpus cover
most core arguments sufficiently.

Related Work. LDA-Frames (Materna, 2012,
2013) is an approach to inducing semantic frames
using LDA (Blei et al., 2003) for generat-
ing semantic frames and their respective frame-
specific semantic roles at the same time. The
authors evaluated their approach against the
CPA corpus (Hanks and Pustejovsky, 2005).
ProFinder (Cheung et al., 2013) is another gen-
erative approach that also models both frames
and roles as latent topics. The evaluation was
performed on the in-domain information extrac-
tion task MUC-4 (Sundheim, 1992) and on the
text summarization task TAC-2010.1 Modi et al.
(2012) build on top of an unsupervised semantic
role labeling model (Titov and Klementiev, 2012).
The raw text of sentences from the FrameNet data
is used for training. The FrameNet gold annota-
tions are then used to evaluate the labeling of the
obtained frames and roles, effectively clustering
instances known during induction. Kawahara et al.
(2014) harvest a huge collection of verbal predi-
cates along with their argument instances and then
apply the Chinese Restaurant Process clustering
algorithm to group predicates with similar argu-
ments. The approach was evaluated on the verb

cluster dataset of Korhonen et al. (2003).
A major issue with unsupervised frame induc-

tion task is that these and some other related ap-
proaches, e.g., (O’Connor, 2013), were all evalu-
ated in completely different incomparable settings,
and used different input corpora. In this paper, we
propose a methodology to resolve this issue.

2 The Triframes Algorithm

Our approach to frame induction relies on graph
clustering. We focused on a simple setup us-
ing two roles and the SVO triples, arguing that
it still can be useful, as frame roles are primarily
expressed by subjects and objects, giving rise to
semantic structures extracted in an unsupervised
way with high coverage.

Input Data. As the input data, we use SVO
triples extracted by a dependency parser. Ac-
cording to our statistics on the dependency-parsed
FrameNet corpus of over 150 thousand sen-
tences (Bauer et al., 2012), the SUBJ and OBJ
relationships are the two most common shortest
paths between frame evoking elements (FEEs) and
their roles, accounting for 13.5 % of instances of
a heavy-tail distribution of over 11 thousand dif-
ferent paths that occur three times or more in the
FrameNet data. While this might seem a simpli-
fication that does not cover prepositional phrases
and frames filling the roles of other frames in a
nested fashion, we argue that the overall frame
inventory can be induced on the basis of this re-
stricted set of constructions, leaving other paths
and more complex instances for further work.

The Method. Our method constructs embed-
dings for SVO triples to reduce the frame induc-
tion problem to a simpler graph clustering prob-
lem. Given the vocabulary V , a d-dimensional
word embedding model v ∈ V → ~v ∈ Rd, and
a set of SVO triples T ⊆ V 3 extracted from a syn-
tactically analyzed corpus, we construct the triple
similarity graph G. Clustering of G yields sets of
triples corresponding to the instances of the se-
mantic frames, thereby clustering frame-evoking
predicates and roles simultaneously.

We obtain dense representations of the triples T
by concatenating the word vectors corresponding
to the elements of each triple by transforming a
triple t = (s, p, o) ∈ T into the (3d)-dimensional
vector ~t = ~s ⊕ ~p ⊕ ~o. Subsequently, we use the
triple embeddings to generate the undirected graph

Algorithm 1 Triframes frame induction
Input: an embedding model v ∈ V → ~v ∈ Rd,

a set of SVO triples T ⊆ V 3,
the number of nearest neighbors k ∈ N,
a graph clustering algorithm CLUSTER.

Output: a set of triframes F .
1: S ← {t→ ~t ∈ R3d : t ∈ T}
2: E ← {(t, t′) ∈ T 2 : t′ ∈ NNSk (~t), t 6= t′}
3: F ← ∅
4: for all C ∈ CLUSTER(T,E) do
5: fs ← {s ∈ V : (s, v, o) ∈ C}
6: fv ← {v ∈ V : (s, v, o) ∈ C}
7: fo ← {o ∈ V : (s, v, o) ∈ C}
8: F ← F ∪ {(fs, fv, fo)}
9: return F

G = (T,E) by constructing the edge set E ⊆ T 2.
For that, we compute k ∈ N nearest neighbors
of each triple vector ~t ∈ R3d and establish co-
sine similarity-weighted edges between the corre-
sponding triples.

Then, we assume that the triples representing
similar contexts appear in similar roles, which
is explicitly encoded by the concatenation of the
corresponding vectors of the words constituting
the triple. We use graph clustering of G to
retrieve communities of similar triples forming
frame clusters; a clustering algorithm is a function
CLUSTER : (T,E) → C such that T =

⋃
C∈CC.

Finally, for each cluster C ∈ C, we aggregate
the subjects, the verbs, and the objects of the con-
tained triples into separate sets. As the result, each
cluster is transformed into a triframe, which is a
triple that is composed of the subjects fs ⊆ V , the
verbs fv ⊆ V , and the objects fo ⊆ V .

Our frame induction approach outputs a set of
triframes F as presented in Algorithm 1. The
hyper-parameters of the algorithm are the number
of nearest neighbors for establishing edges (k) and
the graph clustering algorithm CLUSTER. During
the concatenation of the vectors for words forming
triples, the (|T | × 3d)-dimensional vector space S
is created. Thus, given the triple t ∈ T , we denote
the k nearest neighbors extraction procedure of its
concatenated embedding from S as NNSk (~t) ⊆ T .
We used k = 10 nearest neighbors per triple.

To cluster the nearest neighbor graph of SVO
triples G, we use the WATSET fuzzy graph cluster-
ing algorithm (Ustalov et al., 2017). It treats the
vertices T of the input graph G as the SVO triples,
induces their senses, and constructs an intermedi-

ate sense-aware representation that is clustered us-
ing the Chinese Whispers (CW) hard clustering al-
gorithm (Biemann, 2006). We chose WATSET due
to its performance on the related synset induction
task, its fuzzy nature, and the ability to find the
number of frames automatically.

3 Evaluation

Input Corpus. In our evaluation, we use triple
frequencies from the DepCC dataset (Panchenko
et al., 2018) , which is a dependency-parsed ver-
sion of the Common Crawl corpus, and the stan-
dard 300-dimensional word embeddings model
trained on the Google News corpus (Mikolov
et al., 2013). All evaluated algorithms are exe-
cuted on the same set of triples, eliminating varia-
tions due to different corpora or pre-processing.

Datasets. We cast the complex multi-stage
frame induction task as a straightforward triple
clustering task. We constructed a gold stan-
dard set of triclusters, each corresponding to
a FrameNet frame, similarly to the one illus-
trated in Table 1. To construct the evaluation
dataset, we extracted frame annotations from the
over 150 thousand sentences from the FrameNet
1.7 (Baker et al., 1998). Each sentence contains
data about the frame, FEE, and its arguments,
which were used to generate triples in the form
(wordi : role1,wordj : FEE,wordk : role2), where
wordi/j/k correspond to the roles and FEE in the
sentence. We omitted roles expressed by multi-
ple words as we use dependency parses, where one
node represents a single word only.

For the sentences where more than two roles
are present, all possible triples were generated.
Sentences with less than two roles were omit-
ted. Finally, for each frame, we selected only two
roles, which are most frequently co-occurring in
the FrameNet annotated texts. This has left us with
about 100 thousand instances for the evaluation.
For the evaluation purposes, we operate on the in-
tersection of triples from DepCC and FrameNet.
Experimenting on the full set of DepCC triples is
only possible for several methods that scale well
(WATSET, CW, k-means), but is prohibitively ex-
pensive for other methods (LDA-Frames, NOAC).

In addition to the frame induction evaluation,
where subjects, objects, and verbs are evaluated
together, we also used a dataset of polysemous
verb classes introduced in (Korhonen et al., 2003)
and employed by Kawahara et al. (2014). Statis-

Table 2: Statistics of the evaluation datasets.

tics of both datasets are summarized in Table 2.
Note that the polysemous verb dataset is rather
small, whereas the FrameNet triples set is fairly
large, enabling reliable comparisons.

Evaluation Measures. Following the approach
for verb class evaluation by Kawahara et al.
(2014), we employ normalized modified purity
(nmPU) and normalized inverse purity (niPU)
as the clustering quality measures. Given the
set of the obtained clusters K and the set of
the gold clusters G, normalized modified purity
quantifies the clustering precision as the average
of the weighted overlap δKi(Ki ∩ Gj) between
each cluster Ki ∈ K and the gold cluster
Gj ∈ G that maximizes the overlap with Ki:
nmPU = 1

N

∑|K|
i s.t. |Ki|>1 max1≤j≤|G| δKi(Ki ∩Gj),

where the weighted overlap is the sum of
the weights civ for each word v in i-th clus-
ter: δKi(Ki ∩Gj) =

∑
v∈Ki∩Gj civ. Note that

nmPU counts all the singleton clusters as
wrong. Similarly, normalized inverse purity
(collocation) quantifies the clustering recall:
niPU = 1

N

∑|G|
j=1 max1≤i≤|K| δGj (Ki ∩Gj). nmPU

and niPU are combined together as the harmonic
mean to yield the overall clustering F-score (F1),
which we use to rank the approaches.

Our framework can be extended to evaluation
of more than two roles by generating more roles
per frame. Currently, given a set of gold triples
generated from the FrameNet, each triple ele-
ment has a role, e.g., “Victim”, “Predator”, and
“FEE”. We use fuzzy clustering evaluation mea-
sure which operates not on triples, but instead
on a set of tuples. Consider for instance a gold
triple (Freddy : Predator, kidnap : FEE, kid : Victim). It
will be converted to three pairs (Freddy,Predator),
(kidnap,FEE), (kid,Victim). Each cluster in both K
andG is transformed into a union of all constituent
typed pairs. The quality measures are finally cal-
culated between these two sets of tuples, K, and
G. Note that one can easily pull in more than two
core roles by adding to this gold standard set of tu-
ples other roles of the frame, e.g., (forest, Location).
In our experiments, we focused on two main roles
as our contribution is related to the application of
triclustering methods. However, if more advanced

methods of clustering are used, yielding clusters of
arbitrary modality (n-clustering), one could also
use our evaluation schema.

Baselines. We compare our method to several
available state-of-the-art baselines applicable to
our dataset of triples.

LDA-Frames by Materna (2012, 2013) is a
frame induction method based on topic model-
ing. We ran 500 iterations of the model with
the default parameters. Higher-Order Skip-Gram
(HOSG) by Cotterell et al. (2017) generalizes the
Skip-Gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) by ex-
tending it from word-context co-occurrence ma-
trices to tensors factorized with a polyadic decom-
position. In our case, this tensor consisted of SVO
triple counts. We trained three vector arrays (for
subjects, verbs and objects) on the 108,073 SVO
triples from the FrameNet corpus, using the im-
plementation by the authors. Training was per-
formed with 5 negative samples, 300-dimensional
vectors, and 10 epochs. We constructed an em-
bedding of a triple by concatenating embeddings
for subjects, verbs, and objects, and clustered them
using k-means with the number of clusters set to
10,000 (this value provided the best performance).
NOAC (Egurnov et al., 2017) is an extension of
the Object Attribute Condition (OAC) tricluster-
ing algorithm (Ignatov et al., 2015) to numeri-
cally weighted triples. This incremental algorithm
searches for dense regions in triadic data. A mini-
mum density of 0.25 led to the best results. In the
Triadic baselines, independent word embeddings
of subject, object, and verb are concatenated and
then clustered using a hard clustering algorithm:
k-means, spectral clustering, or CW.

We tested various hyper-parameters of each of
these algorithms and report the best results overall
per clustering algorithm. Two trivial baselines are
Singletons that creates a single cluster per instance
and Whole that creates one cluster for all elements.

4 Results

We perform two experiments to evaluate our ap-
proach: (1) a frame induction experiment on the
FrameNet annotated corpus by Bauer et al. (2012);
(2) the polysemous verb clustering experiment on
the dataset by Korhonen et al. (2003). The first
is based on the newly introduced frame induction
evaluation schema (cf. Section 3). The second
one evaluates the quality of verb clusters only on
a standard dataset from prior work.

Frame Induction Experiment. In Table 3 and
Figure 1, the results of the experiment are pre-
sented. Triframes based on WATSET clustering
outperformed the other methods on both Verb F1
and overall Frame F1. The HOSG-based cluster-
ing proved to be the most competitive baseline,
yielding decent scores according to all four mea-
sures. The NOAC approach captured the frame
grouping of slot fillers well but failed to establish
good verb clusters. Note that NOAC and HOSG
use only the graph of syntactic triples and do not
rely on pre-trained word embeddings. This sug-
gests a high complementarity of signals based on
distributional similarity and global structure of the
triple graph. Finally, the simpler Triadic baselines
relying on hard clustering algorithms showed low
performance, similar to that of LDA-Frames, jus-
tifying the more elaborate WATSET method.

While triples are intuitively less ambiguous than
words, still some frequent and generic triples like
(she,make, it) can act as hubs in the graph, mak-
ing it difficult to split it into semantically plausible
clusters. The poor results of the Chinese Whispers
hard clustering algorithm illustrate this. Since the
hubs are ambiguous, i.e., can belong to multiple
clusters, the use of the WATSET fuzzy clustering
algorithm that splits the hubs by disambiguating
them leads to the best results (see Table 3).

identified on the first dataset. The LDA-Frames
yielded the best results with our approach per-
forming comparably in terms of the F1-score. We
attribute the low performance of the Triframes
method based on CW clustering to its hard parti-
tioning output, whereas the evaluation dataset con-
tains fuzzy clusters. Different rankings also sug-
gest that frame induction cannot simply be treated
as a verb clustering and requires a separate task.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the first application
of triclustering for unsupervised frame induction.
We designed a dataset based on the FrameNet
and SVO triples to enable fair corpus-independent
evaluations of frame induction algorithms. We
tested several triclustering methods as the base-
lines and proposed a new graph-based tricluster-
ing algorithm that yields state-of-the-art results. A
promising direction for future work is using the in-
duced frames in applications, such as Information
Extraction and Question Answering.

tracted frames are available in the supplementary
