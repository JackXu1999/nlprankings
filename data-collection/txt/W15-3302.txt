Abstract

This paper presents the creation and the
initial stage development of a broad-
coverage Indonesian Resource Grammar
(INDRA) within the framework of Head
Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
(Pollard and Sag, 1994) and Minimal Re-
cursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et
al., 2005). At the present stage, INDRA
focuses on verbal constructions and sub-
categorization since they are fundamental
for argument and event structure. Verbs
in INDRA were semi-automatically ac-
quired from the English Resource Gram-
mar (ERG) (Flickinger, 2000) via Wordnet
Bahasa (Nurril Hirfana Mohamed Noor et
al., 2011; Bond et al., 2014). In the future,
INDRA will be used in the development
process of machine translation. A prelim-
inary evaluation of INDRA on the MRS
test-suite shows promising coverage.

1 Introduction to Indonesian

Indonesian (ISO 639-3: ind) is a Western Malayo-
Polynesian language of the Austronesian language
family. Within this subgroup, it belongs to the
Malayic branch with Standard Malay in Malaysia
and other Malay varieties (Lewis, 2009). It is spo-
ken mainly in the Republic of Indonesia as the
sole official and national language and as the com-
mon language for hundreds of ethnic groups living
there (Alwi et al., 2014, pp. 1-2). In Indonesia it
is spoken by around 22.8 million people as their
first language and by more than 140 million peo-
ple as their second language. The lexical similarity
is over 80% with Standard Malay (Lewis, 2009).

Morphologically, Indonesian is a mildly agglu-
tinative language, compared to Finnish or Turk-
ish where the morpheme-per-word ratio is higher
(Larasati et al., 2011). It has a rich affixation sys-

tem, including a variety of prefixes, suffixes, cir-
cumfixes, and reduplication. Most of the affixes
are derivational. Two important inflectional affixes
are the prefix meN- which marks active voice and
di- which denotes passive voice (Sneddon et al.,
2010, pp. 29, 72).

Indonesian has a strong tendency to be head-
initial (Sneddon et al., 2010, pp. 26-28). In a noun
phrase with an adjective, a demonstrative or a rel-
ative clause, the head noun precedes the adjective,
the demonstrative or the relative clause. There is
no agreement in Indonesian. In general, grammat-
ical relations are only distinguished in terms of
word order. As is often the case with Austronesian
languages of Indonesia, Indonesian has a basic
word order of SVO with a nominative-accusative
alignment pattern. Argument alternations are trig-
gered by passive and applicative constructions.

2 Background

This section introduces the background theory, as
well as an overview of the Deep Linguistic Pro-
cessing with HPSG Initiative (DELPH-IN) and the
tools to build and develop INDRA.

2.1 Frameworks

INDRA uses the theoretical framework of HPSG
(Pollard and Sag, 1994). HPSG is mono-
stratal, handling orthography, syntax, semantics
and pragmatics in a single structure (sign), mod-
eled through typed feature structures. HPSG is
unification- and constraint-based. The words and
phrases are combined according to constraints of
the lexical entries based on the type hierarchy.
INDRA uses MRS (Copestake et al., 2005) as
its semantic framework because it is adaptable
for HPSG typed-feature structure and suitable for
parsing and generation. The semantic structures in
MRS are underspecified for scope and thus suit-
able for representing ambiguous scoping.

There is no previous work done on Indone-
sian HPSG but much has been done using Lexi-
cal Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bres-
nan, 1982), e.g. Arka and Manning (2008) on ac-
tive and passive voice and Arka (2000) on con-
trol constructions. In addition, Arka (2012) and
Mistica (2013) have worked on the computational
grammar ”IndoGram” which is a part of the Par-
Gram (Sulger et al., 2013).1 However, it is not
open-source or very broad in its coverage. Fur-
ther, it does not produce MRS, so cannot be easily
incorporated into our machine translation system.
Thus, there is a need to build and develop a broad-
coverage open-source HPSG of Indonesian.

2.2 DELPH-IN

The DELPH-IN consortium (Deep Linguistic
Processing with HPSG Initiative, http://www.
delph-in.net) is a research collaboration be-
tween linguists and computer scientists which
builds and develops open source grammar, tools
for grammar development and applications using
HPSG and MRS. More than fifteen grammars have
been created and developed within DELPH-IN,
e.g. English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copes-
take and Flickinger, 2000) and Japanese grammar
Jacy (Siegel and Bender, 2002). DELPH-IN gram-
mars define typed feature structures using Type
Description Language (TDL) (Copestake, 2002).

We make extensive use of several open-source
tools for grammar development provided by
DELPH-IN: Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB)
(Copestake, 2002), a grammar and lexicon de-
velopment environment for typed feature struc-
ture grammars; The LinGO Grammar Matrix
(Bender et al., 2010), a web-based question-
naire for writing new DELPH-IN grammars, pro-
viding a wide range of phenomena and ba-
sic files to make the grammars compatible with
DELPH-IN parsers and generators; Answer Con-
straint Engine (ACE) (http://sweaglesw.org/
linguistics/ace/), an efficient processor for
DELPH-IN grammars; ITSDB or [incr tsdb()]
(Oepen and Flickinger, 1998), a tool for testing,
profiling the performance of the grammar and tree-
banking; Full Forest Treebanker (FFTB) (http:
//moin.delph-in.net/FftbTop), a treebanking
tool for DELPH-IN grammars, allowing the selec-
tion of an arbitrary tree from the “full forest” with-
out enumerating all analyses in the parsing stage;

1http://iness.uib.no/iness/xle-web

and LOGON (Oepen et al., 2007), a collection of
software, grammars, and other linguistic resources
for transfer-based machine translation.

3 INDRA

This section describes some preliminary work as
well as the methodology.

3.1 Methodology

The methodology used in INDRA follows Bender
et al. (2008). We model our analysis in HPSG and
implement it by editing some TDL files after an-
alyzing a phenomenon based on reference gram-
mars and other linguistic literatures. Afterwards,
we compile the grammar and test it by parsing
sample sentences or test-suites. The grammar is
debugged and developed further if some gaps or
problems are found according to the parse results.
Afterwards, the sample sentences in test-suites
will be parsed again and treebanked. This pro-
cess goes repetitively. If problems are not found
or the debugging process has finished with a good
result, the grammar will be updated in GitHub
(https://github.com/davidmoeljadi/INDRA).

3.2 Grammar Development

INDRA was created firstly by filling in
the required sections of the online page
of LinGO Grammar Matrix questionnaire
which covers basic grammar phenomena
such as word order, tense-aspect-mode, co-
ordination, morphology, subcategorization
of nouns and verbs (http://www.delph-
in.net/matrix/customize/matrix.cgi). IN-
DRA subcategorizes nouns into three groups:
common noun, pronoun and proper name. Com-
mon nouns are subcategorized into inanimate,
non-human and human based on three main
classifiers in Indonesian: the classifier buah (lit.
fruit) for inanimate nouns, ekor (lit. tail) for
non-human animate nouns and orang (lit. person)
for human nouns (Sneddon et al., 2010, p. 139;
Alwi et al., 2014, p. 288).

Verbs are subcategorized into three groups:
intransitive which has one argument, transitive
which has two arguments and optional transitive
which has one obligatory subject argument and
one optional object argument as in Adi makan
(nasi) “Adi eats (rice)”. The verb subcategoriza-
tion here follows Alwi et al. (2014, pp. 95-98).
Besides the number of arguments, the possibil-

10



ity of passivization with morphological inflection
plays an important role in distinguishing intran-
sitives from transitives in Indonesian. Examples
[1] and [2a] show intransitive and transitive
sentences respectively.

(1) Adi tidur.
Adi sleep

“Adi sleeps.”

(2) a. Adi mengejar Budi.
Adi ACT-chase Budi

“Adi chases Budi.”

b. Budi dikejar Adi.
Budi PASS-chase Adi

“Budi is chased by Adi.”

c. Budi saya kejar.
Budi 1SG chase

“Budi is chased by me.”

In Example (2a), the verb mengejar is formed
from an active prefix meN- and the base kejar (the
initial sound k undergoes nasalization; see Section
4.2). The active prefix meN- is changed to a pas-
sive prefix di- in passive type one (Sneddon et al.,
2010, pp. 256-257) in Example (2b) and without
affix in passive type two (Sneddon et al., 2010, pp.
257-258) in Example (2c). Sneddon et al. (2010,
pp. 256-257) states that in passive type one, the ac-
tor is third person or a noun, while in passive two,
the agent is a pronoun or pronoun substitute and it
comes before the unprefixed verb.

The more detailed verb subcategorization into
other groups such as ditransitive will be mentioned
in the next subsection. The lexical items for each
noun and verb subcategory were added and the af-
fixes to support the active-passive voice were in-
cluded. However, the Matrix does not handle mor-
phology as in the nasalization process of meN- and
thus has to be manually added (see Section 4.2).

3.3 Lexical Acquisition
The lexicon is important in the robustness of the
grammar. Since inputting words or lexical entries
manually into the grammar is labor intensive and
time consuming, doing lexical acquisition semi-
automatically is vital. In order to do this, we
need good lexical resources. We attempted to ex-
tract Indonesian verbs from Wordnet Bahasa (Nur-
ril Hirfana Mohamed Noor et al., 2011; Bond et

al., 2014) and group them based on syntactic types
in the ERG, such as intransitive, transitive, and di-
transitive, using Python 3.4 and Natural Language
Toolkit (NLTK) (Bird et al., 2009). The group-
ing of verbs (verb frames) in Wordnet (Fellbaum,
1998) is employed to be the bridge between the
English and Indonesian grammar.

Each verb synset in Wordnet (also Wordnet Ba-
hasa) contains a list of sentence frames specified
by the lexicographer illustrating the types of sim-
ple sentences in which the verbs in the synset can
be used (Fellbaum, 1998). There are 35 verbal
sentence frames in Wordnet, some of them are
shown as follows with their frame numbers:

(3) 1 Something ----s
8 Somebody ----s something
21 Somebody ----s something PP

Frame 1 is a typical intransitive verbal sentence
frame, as in the book fell; frame 8 is a typical
(mono)transitive verbal sentence frame, as in he
chases his friend; and frame 21 is a typical di-
transitive verbal sentence frame, as in she put a
book on a table. A verb may have more than one
synset and each synset may have more than one
verb frame, e.g. the verb eat has six synsets with
each synset having different verb frames. Three of
the six synsets, together with their definition and
verb frames, are presented in Table 1. These verb
frames can be employed as a bridge between the
verb types (also verb lexical items) in ERG and
those in INDRA.

Synset Definition Verb frame
01168468-v Take in solid food 8 Somebody ----s

something
01166351-v Eat a meal, take a

meal
2 Somebody ----s

01157517-v Use up (resources
or materials)

11 Something ----s
something
8 Somebody ----s
something

Table 1: Three of six synsets of the verb “eat” and
their verb frames in Wordnet

Out of 354 verb types in ERG, the top eleven
most frequently used types in the corpus were cho-
sen, excluding the specific English verb types such
as be-type verbs (e.g. is, be and was), have-type
verbs, verbs with prepositions (e.g. depend on, re-
fer to and look after) and modals (e.g. would, may
and need). The chosen eleven verb types are given
in Table 2. The third, fifth and eighth type (v -
unacc le, v - le and v pp unacc le all written in

11



bold in Table 2) are regarded as the same type, i.e.
intransitive verb type, in INDRA.

Table 2: The ten most frequently used ERG verb
types in the corpus

The first type contains verbs expressing move-
ment or direction with optional PP complements,
as in B crept into the room. The verbs in the second
type are subject control verbs, as in B intended to
win. The third type consists of unaccusative verbs
without complements as in The plate gleamed.
The fourth type contains verbs having two argu-
ments (monotransitive) although they have a po-
tential to be ditransitive as in B took the book. The
fifth type contains intransitive (unergative) verbs
as in B arose. The verbs in the sixth type have
obligatory NP and PP complements as in B com-
pared C with D. The verbs in the seventh type are
verbs with optional PP complements and obliga-
tory subordinate clauses as in B said to C that D
won. Unaccusative verbs with optional PP com-
plements as in The seed grew into a tree belong
to the eighth type. Ditransitive verbs with oblig-
atory NPs and PPs with state result as in B put
C on D belong to the ninth type. The tenth type
consists of verbs with optional complementizers
as in B hoped (that) C won and the eleventh type
consists of verbs with obligatory NP complements
which cannot be passivized as in B remains C.

Based on the syntactic information of each verb
type mentioned above, the corresponding verb
frames in Wordnet were manually chosen. For
example, the first type contains intransitive verbs
with optional PP; thus, the verb frames should
be Sb ----s and Sb ----s PP. The intransitive
verbs without complements should correspond to
the verb frames Sth ----s or Sb ----s, regard-
less of whether the subject is a thing or a person.
Table 3 shows the eleven verb types in ERG and
their corresponding Wordnet verb frames.

First, we checked for each verb in each verb

Table 3: The eleven most frequently used ERG
verb types in the corpus and their corresponding
Wordnet verb frames (sb = somebody, sth = some-
thing, & = AND, || = OR

type in Table 2 whether it is in Wordnet or not.
If it could be found in Wordnet, the next step was
to check whether the verb includes the verb frames
mentioned in Table 3 or not. This step had to be
done in order to find out the right synset since
a verb can have many synsets but different verb
frames as shown in Table 1. After the right synset
was found, the corresponding Indonesian lemmas
or translations were checked. One synset may
have more than one Indonesian lemma or may not
have Indonesian lemmas at all.

The next important step is to check one by
one the Indonesian lemmas belonging to the same
synset and verb frames whether each can be
grouped in the same verb type or not. This man-
ual step has to be done because grouping verbs
in a particular language into types is a language-
specific work. Arka (2000) states that languages
vary with respect to their lexical stock of “syn-
onymous” verbs that may have different argument
structures, e.g. the verb know can be both intransi-
tive and transitive in Indonesian tahu and ketahui
respectively, transitive only with an obligatory NP
in Balinese2 tawang, and transitive with optional
NP in English know. Lastly, after the Indonesian
verbs were extracted and grouped into their cor-

2Balinese (ISO 639-3: ban) is a Western Malayo-
Polynesian language of the Austronesian language family. It
belongs to the Malayo-Sumbawan branch. It is mainly spo-
ken in the island of Bali in the Republic of Indonesia as a
regional language (Lewis, 2009).

responding verb types, a new lexicon file for IN-
DRA was made, in which the verbs are alphabeti-
cally sorted. The result is, in total, 939 Indonesian
verbs were extracted and grouped into nine verb
types as presented in Table 4. One verb may be-
long to more than one verb type.

This lexical acquisition is useful to extract lex-
ical items (semi-)automatically through linguistic
resources such as Wordnet Bahasa. The generated
lexicon can be used to improve the grammar’s cov-
erage. We plan to further extract more verbs as
well as other parts-of-speech such as nouns, ad-
jectives and adverbs.

4 Analyzing Indonesian Phenomena

After creating INDRA via the Grammar Ma-
trix customization system, some additions and
changes were done to the TDL files. Pronouns,
proper names and adjectives which were formerly
added via the Grammar Matrix customization sys-
tem, were subsequently constrained so that they
cannot parse phrases such as *saya kaya “rich I”.
In addition, besides the new verb types which had
been acquired from ERG, more verb rules such as
control and raising were manually added. In total,
there are 49 lexical types/categories in the lexicon.

The next subsections discuss some phenomena,
e.g. decomposing words and morphology, ana-
lyzed and implemented in INDRA.

4.1 Decomposed Words

Following Seah and Bond (2014) who state that
pronouns can be analyzed componentially, some
words such as sini “here” can be mapped to mul-
tiple predicates, e.g. sini “here” can be thought of
as tempat ini ”this place”. The way to model this
is by defining type hierarchies for the head (e.g.
tempat “place”) and the demonstrative (e.g. ini

generic n rel

entity n rel time n rel place n rel

Figure 1: Type hierarchy for heads

quant rel

demon q rel

proximal q rel distal q rel

medial q rel remote q rel

...

Figure 2: Type hierarchy for demonstratives

“this”). Figure 1 and 2 show the type hierarchy
for heads and demonstratives respectively.

Indonesian has two demonstratives: ini “this”
and itu “that” but three locative pronouns: sini
“here (near speaker)”, situ “there (not far off)” and
sana “there (far off)” (Sneddon et al., 2010, pp.
133, 195). These can be modeled using the type
hierarchy for demonstratives. The demonstrative
itu “that” has the predicate distal q rel; the loca-
tive pronouns situ and sana has the predicate me-
dial q rel and remote q rel respectively, which are
the daughters of the predicate distal q rel. Figure
3 shows the implementation in TDL.

Figure 4 shows the MRS representation of the
decomposed word situ “there” which is preceded
by a preposition di “at”. The ARG0 in the se-
mantic head daughter di “at” is equated with the
INDEX which has the value e2. The value of
the ARG2 (x4) is coindexed with the ARG0 of
place n rel and medial q rel. The medial q rel in-
troduces RSTR which is related to the top handle
of the quantifier’s restriction (h7) and linked to the
LBL of place n rel (h7=qh5).

Decomposing words is important to get more
refined semantics. We will expand this to other
heads and demonstratives such as kini “at present”
which can be decomposed into time n rel and

situ := n+det-lex &

[STEM < "situ" >,

SYNSEM.LKEYS [ KEYREL.PRED "place_n_rel",

ALTKEYREL.PRED "medial_q_rel"]].

4.2 Morphology
As mentioned in Section 3.2, a number of nasal-
ization (sound changes) or morphology process
occur when meN- combines with bases. Table 5
shows us that a number of sound changes occur
when meN- combines with a base. A base loses
its initial consonant if the consonant is one of the
following voiceless consonants: p, t, s and k. It
retains its initial consonant otherwise. The sound
changes of every possible combination of conso-
nant clusters in Alwi et al. (2014, pp. 67-68) was
manually examined using an online Indonsian dic-
tionary (KBBI Daring) (Alwi et al., 2008). In ad-
dition, when the base consists of only one syllable,
meN- becomes menge- with no sound changes in
the base. Every possible combination of one sylla-
ble word with meN- which forms a transitive verb
in KBBI Daring was listed up. There were 44 one
syllable words in total. All 24 possible consonant
clusters and 44 one syllable words were added to
the inflectional rules in INDRA.

Moreover, besides the consonant clusters and
one syllable words, a manual extension was also
done for the exceptions. The sound p is usually
lost when combined with meN- but it is retained
when it is a derivational prefix per- as in pert-
inggi (from per- and tinggi “high”). At the present
stage, all transitive bases with per- are being listed
up and will be added in INDRA. There are also
bases such as punyai “have” and syairkan “com-
pose a poem” (Sneddon et al., 2010, pp. 16-17)
which do not undergo the common sound changes.

At the present stage, this morphology process

S

Adi

VP

V

Budi

Figure 5: Parse tree of Adi mengejar Budi “Adi
chases Budi”

applies to all transitive verbs in INDRA with a
constraint stating that objects are obligatory. Other
verb types such as ditransitives, control and rais-
ing which can be passivized will be further in-
cluded in the inflectional rules. At present, IN-
DRA can parse the example (2a) as shown in Fig-
ure 5. The MRS representation is exactly the same
as the MRS representation for transitive sentences
(see Figure 6). The value of ARG0 of the semantic
head daughter kejar v rel is an event (e2) which
is equated with the INDEX. The value of ARG0 of
named rel “adi” (x3) and named rel “budi” (x9)
refer to the value of the ARG1 and ARG2 feature
of the semantic head daughter respectively.

We intend to cover all the exceptions in the in-
flectional rules, particularly dealing with words
having per- and to expand the rules to other verb
types such as ditransitives. Passive type one and
type two rules also need to be analyzed and imple-
mented. As Sneddon et al. (2010, pp. 256, 263-
264) pointed out, passive constructions in Indone-
sian are far more frequent than in English; an In-
donesian passive is often naturally translated into
English by an active construction. Thus, dealing
with passive constructions will increase the gram-
mar coverage. We anticipate that translating In-
donesian passive constructions into English will
be a challenge for machine translation.

5 Associated Resources

In order to make INDRA more robust, the fol-
lowing resources have been set up: Indonesian
POS Tagger (Rashel et al., 2014) with ACE’s
YY-mode for unknown word handling (http:
//moin.delph-in.net/ZhongYYMode) which can
parse sentences with unknown words and transfer
grammar for machine translation. At present, IN-
DRA can translate some simple sentences such as
the ones in example (1) and (2a) using the inen
(Indonesian-English) transfer grammar.

6 Evaluation

A test-suite designed to show various semantic
phenomena for Indonesian (MRS test-suite) was
created based on the original set of 107 sentences
in English. The [incr tsdb()] tool (Oepen and
Flickinger, 1998) is employed for grammar testing
and profiling. Out of 172 sentences, INDRA can
parse 55 of them (overall coverage 32%). We got
this 32% coverage after the lexical acquisition de-
scribed in Section 3.3. Table 6 shows the coverage
before and after lexical acquisition.

As of 18 June 2015, INDRA contains 1,235
lexical items, 939 of which are verbs extracted
from ERG via Wordnet Bahasa; 6 lexical rules; 20
grammar rules; 135 features and 1,596 types. In
addition to the phenomena in the Grammar Matrix
customization system, INDRA also covers proper
names, definiteness, possessive enclitics, adverbs,
control and raising, decomposed words and mor-
phology. Phenomena which are planned to be cov-

ered in the next two years are relative clauses,
numbers, quantifiers, classifiers, copula construc-
tions, passives, topic-comment constructions, par-
ticles, interrogatives and imperatives. We estimate
that 15% of the MRS test-suite would be covered
once passives and relative clauses were added.

suite before and after lexical acquisition

7 Summary and Future Work

The lexical acquisition has proved that by acquir-
ing more lexical items, the grammar’s coverage
can be improved. We plan to do more lexical ac-
quisition for verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs
in the future. At the same time, lexical types,
rules and constraints for new lexical items will be
added. Our plan in the next two years is to cover
at least 60% of Indonesian text in the Nanyang
Technological University — Multilingual Corpus
(NTU-MC) (Tan and Bond, 2012). The latest ver-
sion of INDRA is regularly backed up in GitHub.
