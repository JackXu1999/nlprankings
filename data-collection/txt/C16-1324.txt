Abstract

Many argumentative texts, and news editorials in particular, follow a specific strategy to persuade
their readers of some opinion or attitude. This includes decisions such as when to tell an anecdote
or where to support an assumption with statistics, which is reflected by the composition of differ-
ent types of argumentative discourse units in a text. While several argument mining corpora have
recently been published, they do not allow the study of argumentation strategies due to incom-
plete or coarse-grained unit annotations. This paper presents a novel corpus with 300 editorials
from three diverse news portals that provides the basis for mining argumentation strategies. Each
unit in all editorials has been assigned one of six types by three annotators with a high Fleiss’ κ
agreement of 0.56. We investigate various challenges of the annotation process and we conduct a
first corpus analysis. Our results reveal different strategies across the news portals, exemplifying
the benefit of studying editorials—a so far underresourced text genre in argument mining.

1 Introduction
News editorials define a genre of written argumentative discourse whose main goal is persuasiveness. In a
news editorial, an author states and defends a thesis that conveys his or her stance on a controversial topic
usually related to the public interest. Editorials do not only aim to persuade readers of some opinion, but
they often also propagate particular ideologies or recommend certain attitudes to the community, e.g.,
a specific action towards an upcoming event (van Dijk, 1992). To achieve persuasion, a news editorial
follows a particular argumentation strategy that the author expects to be most suitable for the target
audience, i.e., the author composes a series of claims, assumptions, and different types of evidence while
using argumentative language and structure (van Dijk, 1995). This does not only cover the resort to
quantitative features of text (e.g., related to lexical style, cohesion, or rhetorical structure), but it also
refers to the roles, positions, flows, and relations of specific argumentative discourse units.

The study of news editorials is beneficial for several tasks, such as the creation of persuasive writing
strategies for writing assistance systems and qualitative media content analysis. At the same time, the
rapid expansion of online news portals increases the need for algorithms that can analyze an editorial’s
discourse automatically. The needed analyses include argumentation mining and evidence detection,
both of which are studied in computational argumentation, an emergent area of computational linguistics.
While several text corpora for such analyses have recently been published for different domains and
genres, a respective resource with news editorials is missing to this day. Moreover, existing corpora stick
to coarse-grained and/or incomplete annotations of the units of an argumentative discourse (see Section 2
for details), which renders the mining of an author’s argumentation strategy impossible.

In this paper, we present a novel corpus with 300 news editorials evenly selected from three diverse
online news portals: Al Jazeera, Fox News, and The Guardian. The aim of the corpus is to study (1) the
mining and classification of fine-grained types of argumentative discourse units and (2) the analysis of
argumentation strategies pursued in editorials to achieve persuasion. To this end, each editorial contains
manual type annotations of all units that capture the role that a unit plays in the argumentative discourse,

Editorial. I have a very distinct memory from my first day of college: My family's minivan slowly pulling into my dormitory's parking
lot, through a crowd of first-year students flanked by helicopter parents and, in retrospect, probably hungover orientation week advisers. 
I remember thinking "Hurry up! I'm ready to start my real life."

I had no idea what I was really rushing towards.

As the only daughter of Nigerian immigrants with a tenuous-at-best toehold on the middle class, college was billed as the only path to 
financial security. "No one can ever take away your education," my father would say repeatedly. While that may be true, two degrees 
later someone could take away my access to decent housing because of my shit credit, thanks to the nearly $60,000 in student loans I've
essentially defaulted on since graduating from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.

It seems a college education is part of the American dream that's easy to buy (or borrow) into, but hard to pay off.

With tuition soaring, and the middle class shrinking along with their incomes, many students and their families are left holding 
incredibly expensive bags. In 2013, 69% of graduating seniors at public and private nonprofit colleges took out student loans to pay for 
college, and "about one-fifth of new graduates' debt was in private loans," according to the Project on Student Debt. Even public 
schools - long considered a more affordable option - are less accessible: public colleges increasingly rely on tuition dollars as state 
funding continues to fall (25% and 23%, respectively, in 2012, compared to 17% and 23% in 2003). The country's cumulative student 
loan debt ($1.1tn) has surpassed car loans ($875bn) and credit card debt ($659bn). Though college graduates make more than their 
peers who only graduated from high school, for many, monthly student loans leach into that extra $17,500 in salary.

Yet the party line that college education is the middle class' only hope for upward mobility persists - it will even be the message of
President Obama's last stop on his "SOTU Spoiler" tour in Knoxville, Tennessee.

"In today's economy," Dan Pfeiffer, the president's senior advisor, wrote on Medium, "access to a college education is the surest ticket 
to the middle class -- and the President's proposals will help more young people punch that ticket."

As someone who punched that ticket twice, I'm still waiting for my express bus to the middle class. The modest income I make as an 
entrepreneur with a day job is whittled away each month thanks to loan payments (plus interest) to various financial intuitions that 
feel more like bounty hunters than supporters of middle-class aspirants.

With that $60,000 in student loans hanging over me, I'm still waiting to start the "real" life I'd always imagined for myself. It's just that 
now I want one with its possibilities a little less hampered by student debt.

Title. An education was my path to financial security. Then I got my student loan bill.

Types of units

300 editorials in the corpus has been manually assigned one of six types, four of which are shown here.

such as assumption or statistics. The corpus consists of 14, 313 units of six different types, each annotated
by three professional annotators from the crowdsourcing platform upwork.com. Figure 1 shows the type
annotations of one editorial in the corpus. The editorial has been taken from The Guardian.

Based on the results of the annotation process, we analyze the agreement between annotators in order
to scrutinize the major cases of disagreement as well as to designate the complex issues that humans
face in classifying types of argumentative discourse units in editorials. Considering the number and
complexity of the types, the obtained inter-annotator agreement of 0.56 in terms of Fleiss’ κ can be seen
as high. In a first brief statistical analysis of the corpus, we investigate differences in the type distribution
between the three portals, which indicate divergent argumentation strategies.

To conclude, the contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) We propose the first annotation scheme
for mining argumentation strategies that captures the type of each unit of an argumentative text. Unlike
previous schemes, it relies on a complete annotation of the text on a fine-grained level. (2) We introduce
a novel corpus with 300 news editorials which are manually annotated according to the scheme. Despite
the resort to a so far under-resourced text type, the corpus contains a considerably larger number of unit
annotations than comparable existing corpora. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of the inter-
annotator agreement and of the reliability of the resulting annotations. The corpus is freely available in
order to foster research on computational argumentation.1 (3) We present insightful findings that indicate
the potential of our corpus for analyzing the argumentation strategies of news editorials. As far as we
know, our corpus is the first which allows studying such strategies in monological opinionated text.

2 Related Work
Many recent publications in the area of computational argumentation are concerned with the construction
of annotated resources, which is as a fundamental step towards building automatic systems that analyze
the argumentative structure of texts. Unlike most previous corpora, the annotations of our corpus provide
a classification of argumentative units based on their content. In the most simple case, other works dis-
tinguish only argumentative discourse units from other text, as we do in (Al-Khatib et al., 2016). Some

1Webis-Editorials-16 corpus, http://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/corpora/

3434



corpora contain unit annotations based on the role units take in arguments, e.g., premise or conclusion
(Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Habernal and Gurevych, 2015). Such annotations represent the general argu-
mentative structure, but they do not encode the means an author uses to persuade the readers.

Previous corpora that contain content-based unit annotations are not suitable for analyzing argumen-
tation strategies due to their annotation method or to the genre of the contained texts. Similar to our
corpus, the CE corpus of Wikipedia articles (Aharoni et al., 2014; Rinott et al., 2015) also considers
types of evidence (anecdotes, statistics, and testimony). However, evidence is annotated only where it
relates to a set of given topics, so no complete annotation of the article’s discourse is provided. Park and
Cardie (2014) use annotations to distinguish verifiable from non-verifiable evidence, which is not related
to argumentation strategies. The corpus of Habernal and Gurevych (2016) includes logos and pathos
annotations. While this would be appropriate for studying argumentation strategies, the corpus consists
of short forum discussions, which follow no strategic plan.

Several corpora serve to study relations between the argumentative discourse units in a text (Boltužić
and Šnajder, 2014; Ghosh et al., 2014; Peldszus and Stede, 2015; Stab and Gurevych, 2014), e.g., whether
a unit supports or attacks another unit or the thesis of the text. Some patterns of such relations would
certainly be relevant for an analysis of argumentation strategies, like the rebuttal of a common ground that
seems to counter the author’s stance. However, similar to the low number of attack relations in persuasive
essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2014), we found few insightful patterns of this kind in editorials.

While we focus on the argumentation strategy of an entire text, the 60 schemes of Walton et al. (2008)
can be seen as representing the strategy of single arguments, although at a much finer granularity. Anno-
tating a complete argumentative text according to all these schemes is very difficult. The only available
resource with scheme annotations we are aware of, the Araucaria corpus (Reed and Rowe, 2004), con-
tains annotations of single arguments but not of whole texts.

The construction of the corpus introduced in this paper has already been sketched in (Kiesel et al.,
2015). Due to the pure form of argumentation found in news editorials, we discuss suitability of the
corpus as a resource for shared tasks on argument mining there. Most existing work on news editorials
in computational linguistics studies sentiment and opinions (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wilson and
Wiebe, 2003; Bal, 2009). A first conceptual study of the relation between the opinions in a news editorial
and its argumentative structure is described in (Bal and Saint-Dizier, 2009). Besides, to our knowledge,
the only work in this regard is the very recent work of Chow (2016) on Chinese editorials. Unfortunately,
the annotation of this corpus is restricted to the argumentativeness of paragraphs as a whole, which makes
the corpus unsuitable for analyzing argumentation strategies.

3 Model
We now introduce the model (in terms of annotation scheme) that we propose for analyzing the argu-
mentation strategy of a news editorial. The model is focused on the sequential structure of argumentative
discourse, which benefits a reliable statistical recognition of strategy patterns. To this end, we separate an
editorial into argumentative discourse units of six different types where each type represents a particular
role in the discourse. While our model is in line with related work on evidence types (Rinott et al., 2015),
we assign a type to each unit in order to capture an editorial’s overall argumentation strategy.

In particular, we see argumentative discourse units as the smallest elements of the argumentative dis-
course of an editorial. They represent the propositions stated by the editorial’s author to discuss, directly
or indirectly, his or her thesis. In general, propositions affirm or deny that certain entities have certain at-
tributes. An entity may be an object (e.g., milk), a being (e.g., Obama or we), or an abstract concept (e.g.,
learning to cooperate). Technically, we define a unit based on the notion of propositions as follows:

Argumentative Discourse Unit: An argumentative discourse unit is the minimum text span
that completely covers one or more propositions. It always includes a subject (or a placeholder,
such as “which”) and a verb, and it needs to include an object if grammatically required. It
spans at most one sentence.

The units of a news editorial play different roles in the editorial’s argumentative discourse. E.g., some

3435



represent knowledge or beliefs of the author or other people, and some serve as evidence in favor or
against the truth of other units. We assume each unit to refer to exactly one of six types:

1. Common Ground: The unit states common knowledge, a self-evident fact, an accepted truth, or
similar. It refers to general issues, not to specific events. Even if not known in advance, it will be
accepted without proof or further support by all or nearly all possible readers.

Example: “History warns us what happens when empires refuse to teach known values that
strengthen societies and help protect them from enemies intent on their destruction.”

2. Assumption: The unit states an assumption, conclusion, judgment, or opinion of the author, a
general observation, possibly false fact, or similar. To make readers accept it, it is, or it would need
to be supported by other units.

Example: “For too long young people have relied on adults who have done too little to stop the
violation of the rights of the children for whom they were responsible.”

3. Testimony: The unit gives evidence by stating or quoting that a proposition was made by some
expert, authority, witness, group, organization, or similar.

Example: “According to The Yazidi Fraternal Organization (YFO), thousands of young Yazidi
women and children are being used by ISIL as sex slaves.”

4. Statistics: The unit gives evidence by stating or quoting the results or conclusions of quantitative re-
search, studies, empirical data analyses, or similar. A reference may but needs not always be given.

Example: “Of the total of 779 men and boys that have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since
2002, only nine have been convicted of any crime.”

5. Anecdote: The unit gives evidence by stating personal experience of the author, an anecdote, a
concrete example, an instance, a specific event, or similar.

Example: “In 1973, it deployed 18,000 troops with 300 tanks to save Damascus during the ’October
War’.”

6. Other: The unit does not or hardly adds to the argumentative discourse or it does not match any of
the above classes.

Example: “Happy New Year!”

Our hypothesis is that these six types suffice to capture the main structural characteristics of argumen-
tation strategies in news editorials. At the same time, they define an annotation scheme for a fine-grained
mining of argumentative discourse units. This scheme represents the basis for the corpus we constructed.

4 Corpus Construction
This section describes the construction and annotation process of the news editorial corpus based on the
proposed model (Section 3). The purpose of the corpus is to study different argumentation strategies in
news editorials in terms of the argumentative discourse units they use.

4.1 Data Acquisition and Preparation
Before the annotation, the editorials are selected from three diverse news portals and decomposed into
clause-like segments in order to ease the annotation process to achieve scale.

Selection of Argumentative News Editorials The corpus consists of editorials from aljazeera.com,
foxnews.com, and theguardian.com. This selection of news portals cover diverse cultures and styles. They
are internationally well-known and have separate editorial sections. We randomly selected 100 editorials
from each portal that (1) are published within the same short time interval (December 2014 and January
2015) to facilitate a topical overlap, (2) sparked at least a small discussion (had at least 5 comments), and
(3) contain at least 250 words (to filter out texts that just pose a question instead of arguing).

Pre-Segmentation of Argumentative Discourse Units To allow for an annotation at larger scale,
we automatically segmented the editorials before the annotation but then allowed annotators to merge
adjacent segments to discard incorrect unit boundaries. In this setup, the annotators do not have to
choose the exact unit boundaries, which simplifies the annotation process while making the evaluation of
the annotator-agreement more intuitive. A similar manual approach was used by Park and Cardie (2014).

In detail, the applied segmentation algorithm, which we will make publicly available, starts a new
segment at the beginning or end of every clause not preceded by a relative pronoun. Clauses were
identified using a state-of-the-art dependency parser (Manning et al., 2014) and the clause tags from
the Penn Treebank Guidelines (Bies et al., 1995). The heuristic behind the segmentation was chosen
based on a careful analysis of news editorials as well as of the persuasive essays corpus from (Stab and
Gurevych, 2014), since essays resemble editorials in the way they compose argumentative discourse
units. An evaluation of the segmentation algorithm on that corpus yielded very satisfying results: The
algorithm segmented the 90 essays into 5132 segments. Only nine of these segments should have been
split further, as they overlapped with several ground-truth units from the essay corpus. On the other
hand, the segmentation was somewhat too fine-grained, namely, the 1552 ground-truth units were split
into 3637 segments. In our setup, however, the annotators then perform the necessary segment merges.
Table 1 shows statistics about the size of the corpus and its three sub-corpora after segmentation.

4.2 Annotation Process
Given the 300 selected news editorials, an annotation process was performed in order to identify all
argumentative discourse units in each newspaper editorial, including an assignment of one of the six
types from Section 3 to each unit. The main steps of this process are summarized in the following.

Task Definition First, each editorial had to be read as whole in order to understand the main topic and
to follow the stance of the editorial’s author.

As the annotation task, one out of eight classes had to be chosen for each segment of each editorial (see
pre-segmentation above): (1–6) Any of the six types of argumentative discourse units of our model from
Section 3, (7) no unit, when the segment does not belong to a unit, and (8) continued, when the segment
needs to be merged with subsequent segments in order to obtain a unit. In case (8), the class assigned to
the last segment determines the class of the merged unit.

The annotation guidelines given to the annotators contained the type definitions from Section 3 and a
few clear and controversial examples for each type. In addition, we pointed out that the correct classifi-
cation of a segment may require looking at surrounding segments. Also, no distinction should be made
between true and false propositions (e.g., a wrong testimony should still be classified as testimony).

Table 2: Inter-annotator agreement in the main annotation process, quantified in terms of Fleiss’ κ.

Pilot Annotation Study A pilot study was conducted on nine editorials to evaluate the guidelines and
to select the annotators. For this, three editorials were chosen from each portal. They are not part of the
corpus, but were acquired and segmented in the same fashion.

We decided to conduct the annotation process via the professional crowdsourcing platform up-
work.com in order both to increase scalability and to obtain independent annotators. The list of candidate
annotators comprised ten freelancers. All of them were native English speakers, had at least a bachelor’s
degree, and had already knowledge about argumentation theories from their education.

Seven annotators completed all nine editorials, taking around 30 minutes per editorial on average. The
Fleiss’ κ agreement score for all seven annotators was a moderate 0.433 (J. Richard Landis, 1977). As
we observed remarkable drops in the agreement caused by either of three specific annotators, we decided
to exclude those annotators and keep the remaining four for the main annotation study.

An error analysis of the annotation of the four annotators revealed insightful hard cases. For instance,
the annotators had difficulties to distinguish between common ground and anecdote for units discussing
a specific event that is well-known universally. Also, there was notable disagreement between common
ground and assumption. This was expected, though, since the distinction of these two types appears more
subjective than for other type combinations. Nevertheless, the agreement between the four annotators
for all types was substantial with κ = 0.606. Therefore, we decided not to modify our scheme, but only
to clarify the type definitions and to add some additional examples that clarify these hard cases.

Main Annotation Process The 300 corpus editorials were evenly distributed among the four annota-
tors. Each annotator got 225 editorials to annotate, 75 from each news portal. Accordingly, each editorial
was annotated by three annotators.

4.3 Annotation Results
We analyzed the results of the annotation process in order to examine (1) the reliability of the corpus and
(2) the major disagreements in units and types between the annotators. Our main findings are as follows:

Inter-Annotator Agreement In terms of Fleiss’ κ, the overall agreement is 0.56. As broken down in
Table 2, however, the types common ground and other have only a slight agreement, while the annotators
achieved fair agreement for no unit and anecdote as well as moderate or substantial agreement for the
remaining four types. Moreover, for 94.4% of all segments at least two of three annotators agree on one
type, suggesting that a resort to majority agreement is very adequate. Considering that the annotators had
to decide among eight different classes for every segment, such agreement seems high in overall terms.
Therefore, we conclude that the annotations of the corpus can be seen as reliable.

Disagreement Analysis To analyze the disagreement between the annotators, we created the confusion
probability matrix (CPM, Cinková et al. (2012)) for all classes shown in Table 3. Each matrix cell shows
the probability of choosing the column’s class, given that another annotator chose row’s class. Table 3
reveals the five class-pairs where annotators are most confused between:

1. Disagreement between other and assumption (0.324). An explanation may be that the annotators
interpreted the intention of the author of a respective editorial differently in some segments.

An example unit that led to confusion is “I just don’t get it” after another unit “the rave reviews for
the first episode make me feel like a teetotaller at a lock-in”. The first unit could be interpreted as
an implicit assumption about the reviews in the second unit, say, that the review is corrupt or hard to
understand. However, it could also simply be seen as an interjection not belonging to any argument.

2. Disagreement between common ground and assumption (0.562). Although we revised our guide-
lines to resolve the ambiguity of these types, their distinction still seems to be hard in practice.

Table 3: Probability confusion matrix for all pairs of annotated types of argumentative discourse units.

For example, the unit “To see a movie legally you must leave your house, queue up, ask someone
for a ticket and then sit down in the company of others” can be viewed as common ground if
the annotator believes that most people agree with this statement, meaning there is no need for
justification. In contrast, it is viewed as an assumption if people are assumed to disagree to some
extent, e.g., because a DVD can be bought and watched legally at home.

3. Disagreement between common ground and anecdote (0.163). Confusion between these types oc-
curred in cases where there was a distinct fact that the editorial’s author uses to support his stance.

For example, Iraq’s Sunnis were the leading force within the Iraqi army since its foundation on
January 6, 1921. This declaration was used to support the author’s claim that the Sunnis respect
their army and see it as a national institution of unrivaled prestige.

4. Disagreement between other and no unit (0.310). Without clear reason, these classes seem to have
been used interchangeably sometimes.

5. Disagreement between no unit and continued (0.377). The main reason for such disagreement was
that the annotators dealt with discourse markers and connectives inconsistently.

E.g., in case of the subsequent segments (1) “According to the administration” and (2) “the film by
Nakoula Basseley Nakoulahad sparked spontaneous riots to defend Muhammad’s honor”, the first
was partly seen as no unit, although our guideline specified to consider such segments as one unit.

Post-Processing of the Annotations For the final version of the corpus, the corpus segments were con-
solidated using the majority vote for each segment: If at least two workers agreed on the class of a seg-
ment, the segment was classified accordingly. Else, one of this paper’s authors selected one of three
suggested classes. Based on the disagreement analysis and a manual inspection of the annotations, we
found a few general misclassifications that could be fixed semi-automatically. While overruling some de-
cisions of the annotators, we thereby achieve a more consistent annotation, which is crucial for learning
based on the corpus. In particular, we conducted the following post-processing steps:

• A considerable number of segments was annotated as no unit, although it should have been merged
with the next segment. We reviewed several instances of this problem, such as conditional state-
ments (e.g., of the form “if A then B”) or relations that are not argumentative but temporal or spatial
(e.g., of the form “when A then B”). Where necessary, we then merged the respective segments.

• According to our definitions, only non-rhetorical questions should be labeled as no unit. However,
many rhetorical questions were also classified as no unit, even though they had, in our view, a
clear argumentative function: most times implicitly conveying claims, recommendations, or similar.
Following our definitions, we reclassified them as assumption.

• Second person voice segments were often classified as no unit, possibly due to the unintended inter-
pretation that a unit requires an explicit subject. Nearly all of them are appeals, recommendations,
or similar. As above, we thus reclassified them as assumption.

In addition to the corrections above, we excluded periods, commas, or similar punctuation at the end of
segments and put them in separate no unit segments. This is important to prevent unit type classifiers
from misleadingly learning to identify particular types based on these characters.

Table 4 presents some statistics of the final corpus, obtained after post-processing. We observe that the
most frequent type of argumentative discourse unit is assumption covering almost 68.4% of all units. The
anecdote type represents about 18.2%, surpassing the testimony (7.6%), statistics (2.9%), and common
ground (1.7%). Other, finally, only refers to a very low percentage of units (1.2%). On one hand, this
supports the hypothesis that editorials are a rich source for argumentation. On the other hand, it serves
as strong evidence that the six proposed types of units cover most units found in editorials.

5 Argumentation Strategies
Aside from the general use of our corpus for the development and evaluation of approaches to argumen-
tation mining, the corpus serves to investigate how authors argue in news editorials in order to persuade
the readers. We do not actually analyze such argumentation strategies here. Rather, we present some
basic findings that indicate the potential of our corpus for analysis in this regard.

In particular, Table 5 shows detailed statistics about the types of argumentative discourse units in the
corpus. Overall, we see that the length of news editorials is quite stable across the three news portals,
with a mean between 48.76 (The Guardian) and 52.34 units (Fox News). Some very short (minimum 14
units) and very long editorials (maximum 132 units) exist, though.

Regarding the distribution of the types, some general tendencies as well as some insightful differences
can be observed. Generally, more than two third of an editorial usually comprises assumptions. This is
not surprising, as the type assumption covers both claims and any other propositions that may require
justification. While The Guardian has the highest proportion of assumptions (71.7%), it represents the
median for most other types. Fox News more strongly relies on common ground, with more than one
unit of that type on average. Even more clearly, 8.7% of all units in Fox News editorials is testimony
evidence, about twice as many on average as in The Guardian (4.55 vs. 2.53). In contrast, Al Jazeera
seems to put more emphasis on anecdote. At least, it spreads anecdotes across more units (21.0% of all).
Interestingly, all three portals behave very similar in their resort to statistics at the same time.

Altogether, these numbers suggest that our corpus is worthy of being analyzed regarding argumenta-
tion strategies. While we leave such analyses to future research, we expect that especially the sequence
of types of argumentative discourse units in an editorial can be decisive. Similar findings have been re-
ported for the impact of discourse functions on the quality of essays (Persing et al., 2010), the inference
of intentions from rhetorical moves (Teufel, 2014), and the generality of sentiment flows across review
domains (Wachsmuth et al., 2015). Possibly, an adequate granularity (editorial level vs. paragraph level)
and abstraction (all types vs. majority in paragraphs vs. ...) may have to be found for editorials, though,
because the high average number of units allows for significant variance in respective sequences.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
Although news editorials are considered as one of the purest forms of argumentative text, so far few works
exist in computational linguistics that study them. In this paper, we have presented the development of
an annotated corpus for the mining of an editorial’s argumentative discourse and the analysis of its
argumentation strategy. We expect that such an analysis will contribute to the computational assessment
of the quality and persuasiveness of monological argumentation. In recent work, we have analyzed the
argumentative structure of persuasive essays in order to assess their argumentation quality (Wachsmuth

et al., 2016). While we focused on the logos means of persuasion there, argumentation strategies actually
bring together logos, pathos, and ethos (Aristotle, 2007).

Our corpus is based on a fine-grained model (in terms of an annotation scheme) that we propose for
capturing the different types of argumentative discourse units found in news editorials and in similar
argumentative texts. We have detailed the annotation process and we have presented empirical evidence
for typical characteristics of editorials and their variance across news portals. While not being considered
in the model, we point out that units sometimes may have different types, e.g., they may represent
both testimonial and statistical evidence. To create a clear classification setting, we decided to assign
exactly one type to each unit, though, and to give the annototators guidelines about what type to prefer
in what context. Partly, they are already encoded in the presented type definitions. Aside from that, we
observed rather low agreement for the infrequent type common ground. Still, the resulting annotations
may be valuable for research questions related to argumentation quality or persuasiveness. For instance,
some authors use specific terms such as “in fact” or “for sure” before assumptions to let them appear as
common ground. Our corpus helps to detect such cases.

In general, there is room to extend our corpus in future work. Most evidently, a deeper analysis of the
argumentative discourse of news editorials will need to consider the relations between units that make up
arguments. Among others, the relations will also reveal what are the main claims of an editorial. Unlike
related text genres such as persuasive essays, however, editorials usually have no clear hierarchical argu-
mentative structure, partly due to a frequent resort to enthymemes. This makes a consistent annotation of
relations very challenging. We thus decided to focus on the types of units in the given form of the corpus,
thereby ending up with a reliable corpus of reasonable size that we will make freely available. Recently,
the need for according benchmark corpora was discussed in the emerging community of computational
argumentation in order to allow for shared tasks and similar (Gurevych et al., 2016).
