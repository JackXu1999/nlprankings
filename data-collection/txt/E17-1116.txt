Abstract

Political surveys have indicated a relation-
ship between a sense of Scottish identity
and voting decisions in the 2014 Scot-
tish Independence Referendum. Identity
is often reflected in language use, suggest-
ing the intuitive hypothesis that individ-
uals who support Scottish independence
are more likely to use distinctively Scot-
tish words than those who oppose it. In
the first large-scale study of sociolinguistic
variation on social media in the UK, we
identify distinctively Scottish terms in a
data-driven way, and find that these terms
are indeed used at a higher rate by users of
pro-independence hashtags than by users
of anti-independence hashtags. However,
we also find that in general people are less
likely to use distinctively Scottish words
in tweets with referendum-related hashtags
than in their general Twitter activity. We
attribute this difference to style-shifting rel-
ative to audience, aligning with previous
work showing that Twitter users tend to
use fewer local variants when addressing a
broader audience.

1 Introduction

A central idea from sociolinguistics is that people’s
social identity is reflected in their use of language,
and that people modulate their use of language in
order to present particular identities in different
situations. The recent availability of social media
data has raised interest in confirming and extending
these results using large scale datasets. For exam-
ple, Twitter data has been used to examine patterns

of regional variation in general US English (Doyle,
2014; Huang et al., 2015), African American En-
glish (Jones, 2015), and global Spanish (Gonçalves
and Sánchez, 2014), and to study variation asso-
ciated with factors such as race/ethnicity (Jones,
2015; Blodgett et al., 2016; Jørgensen et al., 2015)
and gender (Bamman et al., 2014). These studies
have shown that tweets mirror spoken language in
many ways, such as displaying dialect variation not
only in the use of distinct lexical items, but also in
the use of non-standard spellings to indicate non-
standard pronunciation—in fact, these spellings
even reflect the phonological processes found in
spoken language (Eisenstein, 2015). There is also
evidence that, as in spoken language, individuals
may shift their style of language in response to the
audience. In particular, studies have found that
when the expected audience of a tweet is larger,
Americans use fewer non-standard and local words
(Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015) and Dutch
bilingual speakers of a minority language are more
likely to use Dutch rather than their other language
(Nguyen et al., 2015). A small-scale case study
of a single Scottish Twitter user also provides pre-
liminary evidence that users may modulate their
production of regional variants according to the
topic of the tweet (Tatman, 2015).

Here we present the first large-scale sociolinguis-
tic study of British tweets, and the first to examine
the relationship between sociolinguistic variation
and political views using social media data. We use
a large corpus of tweets to examine the relationship
between users’ linguistic choices and their views
about the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.
The referendum (on whether Scotland should leave
the UK) generated considerable political discus-
sion and an unprecedented turnout of 84.6% of the

1239



electorate, with the ‘No’ (anti-independence) side
taking 55.3% of the vote. The 2013 Scottish Social
Attitudes Survey (ScotCen, 2013) showed a clear
correlation between national identity and voting
intentions (53% of those who identified as ‘Scot-
tish not British’ said they intended to vote ‘Yes’ to
independence, vs. just 5% of those who identified
as ‘British not Scottish’), and there was much dis-
cussion in the popular press about the relationship
between a sense of Scottish identity and support
for Scottish sovereignty.

Although this recent discussion was not centered
on language, there is a long history of scholarly
discourse connecting the use of the Scots language1

and sociolinguistic and political identity (Grant,
1931; Mcafee, 1985; Corbett et al., 2003). If this
connection still holds today, then we might expect
to find that those on the ‘Yes’ side of the debate use
more identifiably Scottish language than those on
the ‘No’ side. We might also expect to find some
modulation of Scottish language use depending on
whether users are discussing the referendum or not.

To examine these questions, we used a data-
driven approach to identify linguistic terms that are
used more in Scotland than in the rest of the UK.
The identified terms include uniquely Scots words
that are attested in Scots literature dating back to
the 1600s and earlier, contemporary regional col-
loquialisms, spelling variants of Standard English
words which reflect Scottish pronunciations, and
acronyms used as shorthand for distinctive Scot-
tish phrases. From these, we selected variables
for which users can produce either a Standard En-
glish or Scottish variant (e.g., DO vs. DAE). We
then classified users as pro- or anti-independence
based on the referendum-related hashtags they used
and asked whether these two groups use Scottish
variants at different rates. We found that the pro-
independence group did use Scottish variants sig-
nificantly more than the anti-independence group,
although the overall rate of Scottish variants is very
low amongst all users.

Next, we compared the use of Scottish variants
in tweets containing referendum-related hashtags
to their use in other tweets. If users are aiming
to project their Scottish identity as part of politi-

1Historically, Scots has been considered a different lan-
guage than English (see §2), though with many cognates and
overlapping vocabulary. Most native Scottish people today
speak some variety of Scottish English, which retains a few
uniquely Scots words but is mainly distinguished from other
varieties of English by its pronunciation.

cal discourse, then we might expect greater use of
Scottish variants in referendum tweets than in non-
referendum tweets. However, previous studies have
suggested that non-standard and local variants are
used less frequently in tweets containing hashtags,
which typically have a larger audience than other
tweets (Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015). This
effect would predict the opposite result—a lower
use of Scottish variants in tweets with referendum
hashtags—and indeed this is the result we found.
So it appears that although pro-independence users
do make greater use of Scottish variants overall,
they do not increase their Scottish usage when en-
gaging in broad-audience political discourse.

To summarize, the contributions of our paper are:
(1) The first large-scale study of dialect variation on
twitter in the UK. We show that in addition to using
Scots in speech and some literary genres such as po-
etry, people are using Scots in informal public writ-
ing. The data-driven approach enables us to iden-
tify Scotland-specific lexical items without relying
on pre-conceived notions of which variables to look
for (cf. Tatman, 2015), and reveals that in addition
to using attested Scots vocabulary, Twitter users
appear to be creatively adapting to the medium
with their use of acronyms for distinctly Scottish
turns of phrase. (2) The first study connecting soci-
olinguistic variables to political stance using social
media data, showing that pro-independence users
have a higher rate of Scottish usage. (3) Further
evidence of Pavalanathan and Eisenstein’s (2015)
claim that Twitter users modulate their language
according to the audience, with local variants being
less likely in tweets directed to larger audiences.

2 Context

‘Scots’ refers to the group of dialects historically
spoken in the Lowlands of Scotland. While Scots
has Anglo-Scandinavian origins in common with
English, by the 16th century its pronunciation, vo-
cabulary, and literary norms had considerably di-
verged from those of English, and Scots had be-
come established as the prestige language in Scot-
land (Kay, 1988).2 However, following the Union
of Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scot-
land acceded to the thrones of England and Ireland,

2Previously, Gaelic had been the dominant spoken and
literary language in Scotland. Note that while in medieval
times non-Gaelic speakers referred to the Gaels as ‘Scots’,
what we now refer to as ‘Scots’ is the Anglo-Scandinavian
language which spread at the expense of Scottish Gaelic (a
Celtic language) in the 15th & 16th centuries.

1240



he and his court began to adopt English norms
in their writing. After the Union of Parliaments in
1707, English firmly replaced Scots as the language
of serious or elevated discourse in Scotland (Grant,
1931). While some people still use distinctive el-
ements of Scots in their speech, until recently the
average Scottish person’s exposure to written Scots
would have been largely confined to a select few
literary domains such as poetry and comic narrative
(Corbett et al., 2003). However, social media has
given rise to a new genre of casual, communicative
writing that is potentially visible to large and di-
verse audiences, providing both a platform and an
impetus to express one’s identity through the use of
written language. Below, we provide three example
tweets (each from a different user) which contain
orthographic representations of Scots vocabulary
and/or Scottish English pronunciation. Standard
English variants of Scottish terms are provided in
italics.

just remember there’s always good biscuits in

3 Data

Our data was drawn from the Sample endpoint
of Twitter’s Streaming API (a.k.a. the ‘Spritzer’),
which provides a random 1% sample of all public
tweets in near real-time. We started with all tweets
streamed from the Spritzer between 1st September
2013 and 30th September 2014. These dates cover
a year of activity leading up to the referendum, as
well as the day the vote took place (18 September
2014), and immediate reactions. We used a lan-
guage classifier (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) to filter
out non-English tweets, yielding an initial dataset
of 629,431,509 tweets.3 Because we are interested

3One might be concerned that an automatic language filter
could remove some of the heavily Scottish tweets. However,

in the linguistic choices that individuals make in
various contexts, we took steps to remove tweets
which were not originally authored by the individ-
ual who posted them. Retweets (tweets which are
verbatim copies of other tweets) were identified by
a case-insensitive search for the token ‘RT’, and
discarded. Quote tweets (tweets which contain ver-
batim copies of other tweets, but are augmented
with original comments) were dealt with by dis-
carding any text between double quotation marks,
but retaining the remainder of the tweet.

From this initial dataset we extracted three over-
lapping subsets:

The Geotagged-UK (GU) dataset contains all
tweets geotagged to a location in the United King-
dom (1,654,204 tweets by 446,923 distinct users).

The Geotagged-Scotland (GS) dataset con-
tains all tweets geotagged to a location in Scotland
(166,992 tweets by 40,861 distinct users).

The Indyref Tweets (IT) dataset consists of
tweets containing hashtags relating to the 2014
Scottish Independence Referendum.

To construct the IT dataset, we first created a
list of relevant hashtags, starting with the following
five seed hashtags: #IndyRef, #VoteYes, #VoteNo,
#YesScotland, #BetterTogether.4 For each of these
five seeds, we extracted from our initial filtered
dataset a list of all tweets by any user who used
the seed hashtag. We identified the 100 most fre-
quent hashtags in each of these five lists of tweets,
and manually discarded all hashtags which were
unrelated to the referendum, as well as those which
were highly ambiguous (e.g., #Indy, which some-
times refers to the referendum, but also commonly
refers to a genre of music). The resulting list of
referendum-related hashtags is given in Table 1.

Next, we extracted all tweets from our initial
dataset which contain at least one of the hashtags
on this list, yielding 77,708 tweets by 26,019 dis-
tinct users. We then applied a heuristic to filter
out tweets produced by bots and spammers: for

even tweets such as example (3) in §2 are assigned a very
high probability of being English by the filter. Perhaps other
tweets with many Scottish terms were filtered out, in which
case we will underestimate the probability that users choose
Scottish variants. However this issue should not cause us to
find differences in use between different groups where there
are none.

4‘Yes Scotland’ and ‘Better Together’ are the names of
the principal organisations representing the Yes and No vote
campaigns, respectively.

1241



each user in the IT dataset for whom we had at
least 5 tweets in the initial dataset, we computed
the proportion of their tweets that contain URLs,
and discarded users for whom this proportion was
in the 90th percentile. This step filtered out 11,443
tweets by 1389 users.

Note that seven of the hashtags in Table 1
(#voteyes, #bettertogether, #nothanks, #voteno,
#yes2014, #letsstaytogether, and #yesvote) are oc-
casionally used in contexts unrelated to the Scottish
Independence Referendum (e.g. #bettertogether
can also refer to interpersonal relationships). How-
ever, they are distinctive enough that if a user has
also used hashtags which are unambiguously re-
lated to the referendum, then it seems reasonable
to assume that their usage of these potentially-
ambiguous hashtags relates to the referendum too.
Therefore, in order for a tweet containing one of
these seven hashtags to be retained in the Indyref
dataset, we required that its author had also used at
least one other hashtag from Table 1. This criterion
filtered out a further 6601 tweets by 6041 distinct
users, such that the final IT dataset contains 59,664
tweets by 18,589 distinct users.

4 Identifying distinctively Scottish
vocabulary on Twitter

We wish to identify terms that are more likely to be
used by Twitter users in Scotland than in the rest
of the UK. We follow the method of Pavalanathan
and Eisenstein (2015), who used the Sparse Addi-
tive Generative Model of Text (SAGE) framework
(Eisenstein et al., 2011) to identify tweet terms asso-
ciated with metropolitan areas in the United States.
SAGE models deviations in the log-frequencies of
terms in a corpus of interest (here, the GS dataset)
with respect to their log-frequencies in some “back-
ground” corpus (here, the GU dataset). The esti-
mated deviations are regularized to avoid overstat-
ing the importance of deviations in the frequencies
of rare words. Here, we use a publicly available
implementation of SAGE5 to obtain log-frequency
deviation estimates for all terms which occur at
least fifty times in the GU dataset, excluding hash-
tags, mentions, URLs, and stopwords. The terms
with the highest estimates are those which are most
distinctive to tweets geo-located in Scotland.

4.1 Scotland-specific terms

Unsurprisingly, many of the Scotland-specific
terms are proper nouns which are topically associ-
ated with Scotland, such as Scottish placenames,
political figures, and sports personalities. There are
also several common nouns (e.g. ‘devolution’, ‘bag-
pipes’) and verbs (e.g. ‘canvass’, ‘invade’) which
are strongly associated with the political or cul-
tural climate in Scotland. These terms occur with
greater relative frequency in the GS dataset simply
because their referents are discussed with greater
relative frequency; not because they are distinct
from the terms that people in the rest of the UK
use to index those referents. However, there are
also many terms with high log-frequency devia-
tions that are linguistically distinctive. To isolate
such terms, we began with the 400 terms with the
highest estimated deviations, and then manually fil-
tered this list, discarding Standard English words,
proper nouns, numerals, and non-standard terms
which had clear topical associations (e.g. ‘devo’:
an abbreviation for ‘devolution’; ‘hh’: an acronym
for ‘Hail Hail’, a football chant used by supporters
of Celtic F.C.). The remaining 113 distinctively
Scottish terms are listed in Table 2.

Almost three fourths of these terms are at-
tested in the Scottish National Dictionary (SND)
(Grant and Murison, 1931) or its online sup-
plement (Scottish Language Dictionaries, 2004),
which catalogue words that are distinctive to Scots
(i.e. those which are not used, or are used dif-
ferently, in Standard English), covering the pe-
riod from the 1700s up to the present day. Many
are also attested in the Dictionary of the Older
Scottish Tongue (Aitken et al., 1990), which cat-
alogues the entire vocabulary of Scots from the
1100s to the late 1600s. Of the attested Scots
words, some are unique to Scots, e.g. BAIRNS
(‘sons/daughters’), GREETIN (‘weeping’); some are
cognates with English words that have fallen out
of common usage, e.g. CRABBIT (‘crabbed’; ‘ill-
tempered’), FEART (‘feared’; ‘frightened/timid’);
some are cognates with English words but have a
wider range of senses, e.g. HUNNERS is cognate
with‘hundreds’, but used more generally to mean
‘lots’ as in “love you hunners”, “there was hun-
ners to do”; and many differ only in form from
their English cognates, e.g. AFF (‘off’) and BAW
(‘ball’).

Of the 29 terms that are not attested in SND, 9
are spelling variants or derived forms of attested

Scots words, e.g. CANA, CANNY, and CANI are
alternative spellings of the attested CANNAE, and
WANTY is a contracted form of ‘want to’, analo-
gous to the attested GONNAE and GONY. A further
5 are orthographic representations of distinctively
Scottish pronunciations, e.g. ANO (‘I know’), HING
(‘thing’); and 2 are acronyms for distinctively Scot-
tish turns of phrase: GTF (‘Get Tae Fuck’ ) and
MWI (‘Mad Wae It’). The final 13 could be de-
scribed as contemporary Scottish slang, and in-
clude abbreviations: BEVY (‘beverage’)6, DEFOS
(‘definitely’); drug-related lexis: WHITEY, ECCIES;
profanities: BOABY, FANNYS; and everyday af-
fective and descriptive words: DYNO (‘amazing’),
ROASTER (‘idiot’).

4.2 Lexical variables
Our goal is to measure the rate at which people
index their Scottishness (either consciously or sub-
consciously) through the use of distinctively Scot-
tish words, and to find out whether this rate varies
across different groups of users (Yes hashtag users
vs. No hashtag users), or across different contexts
(tweets which contain referendum-related hashtags
vs. tweets that don’t).

Were we to directly compare the frequencies of
our Scottish terms across different sets of tweets, it
would be difficult to untangle differences in the rate
at which users are indexing the referents of those
terms from differences in the rate at which they
are indexing their Scottishness. For example, if
people use the term MASEL (‘myself’) with a lower
frequency in one context than in another, this could
be because they are modulating their use of distinc-
tively Scottish terms in response to the context, but
it could also be because they are modulating the

6While‘bevy’ is also used colloquially for ‘beverage’ in
other parts of the UK, in Scotland it is more frequent and can
additionally be used as a mass noun (“I had so much bevy I
couldn’t even carry it”), and as a verb (“I’d bevy with him
every weekend”).

rate at which they talk about themselves. To avoid
this confound, we instead compare the conditional
probabilities with which Scottish terms are used,
given that their referents are being indexed at all.

We therefore consider only those Scottish terms
for which we can identify semantically equivalent
Standard English variants. We require that each
variant of a given variable indexes the same set of
senses and can occur in the same set of contexts,
so for example we do not include YOUS as a vari-
ant of YOU, since while Scottish YI and Standard
English YOU can index both the singular and plu-
ral second person pronouns, YOUS is only used
for the plural. We also did not include variants of
YES and NO since their use could be influenced by
campaign slogans (e.g., the hashtags #VoteAye and
#JustSayNaw). Our variables are listed in Table 3.

5 Study 1: Scotland-specific vocabulary
usage on either side of the debate

Do tweeters who use Yes hashtags use Scottish
variants at a higher rate than tweeters who use No
hashtags, either when using these hashtags, or in
general?

5.1 Method
We assign users in the IT dataset to two groups, Yes
and No, based on the quantity nu,yesnu,yes+nu,no , where
nu,yes is the number of tweets in which user u has
used at least one of the Yes hashtags and none of the
No hashtags in Table 1; and nu,no is the number of
tweets in which u has used at least one No hashtag
and none of the Yes hashtags. The Yes group con-
sists of all users for whom this quantity is greater
than or equal to 0.75, while the No group consists
of all users for whom it is less than or equal to 0.25.
Users for whom the value lies between 0.25 and
0.75 (as well as those for whom our dataset does
not contain any tweets with Yes or No hashtags),
are not assigned to either group. The Yes group

contains 4,513 users, while the No group contains
1,356 users, which is consistent with the general
perception at the time that the Yes campaign was
much more vocal than the No campaign. To test our
hypothesis that the probability of choosing Scot-
tish variants is, on average, greater for users in the
Yes group than for users in the No group, we esti-
mate the difference between the two groups in the
average probability of choosing Scottish variants,
and conduct a permutation test to approximate the
distribution of this difference under the null hypoth-
esis. We first test whether the Yes group are more
likely than the No group to use Scottish variants
in tweets which contain hashtags that indicate a
stance on the referendum. Subsequently, we test
whether the Yes group are more likely than the No
group to use Scottish variants in general across all
of their tweets.

5.1.1 Test statistic
Let Ug be the set of all users in group g ∈ {yes, no}
who have used at least one of the variables in
Table 3. For a given user u ∈ Ug, let V be
the set of all variables that u has used in at least
one tweet. We estimate the probability of user u
choosing a Scottish variant of variable v ∈ V as
p̂u,v =

nu,vscot
nu,v

, where nu,vscot is the token count
of Scottish variants of v in user u’s tweets, and
nu,v is the token count of all variants of v in user
u’s tweets. Averaging across variables, we obtain
p̂u = 1V

∑
v∈V p̂u,v. We then average across users

to obtain the group mean, p̂g = 1U
∑

u∈Ug p̂u. Our
test statistic is the difference between the two group
means, d = p̂yes − p̂no.
5.1.2 Permutation test
We randomly shuffle users between the two groups
(maintaining each group’s original number of
users), and re-compute the value of d using
these permuted groups. We repeat this procedure
100,000 times in order to approximate the distri-

bution of differences in group means that would
be observable were the difference independent of
the assignment of users to groups. The proportion
of permuted differences which are greater than or
equal to the observed difference between the origi-
nal group means provides an approximate p-value.

5.2 Results

For a tweet to be included in the analysis, it must
contain at least one of the variables in Table 3.
Hence not all users contribute data to the test statis-
tic, as some have not used any of the variables
in their tweets. The number of tweets and users
included in each analysis are shown in Table 4.

The results for the first analysis are shown in the
left column of Table 5. The difference between the
two groups in their average probability of choosing
Scottish variants in tweets that contain polarised
referendum hashtags is statistically significant (p <
0.002). Results for the second analysis are shown
in the right column of Table 5. Once again, the
difference between the two groups is statistically
significant (p < 0.001).

5.3 Discussion

The results show that the Yes group do use Scottish
variants at a significantly higher rate than the No
group, both when using Yes or No hashtags, and
in general. The stronger significance level for the
‘All tweets’ dataset is partly due to its larger size
(see Table 4), which enables better estimates of the

usage rates. While the rates are very low overall,
the relative differences are large: the Yes group rate
is more than three times the No group rate when we
include only tweets with Yes or No hashtags, and
approximately twice as big when we include all
tweets. The higher rates in the ‘All Tweets’ dataset
suggest that both groups of users chose Scottish
variants less often when discussing the referendum
than in their other tweets. However, the test we
used does not provide a significance value for the
difference in usage rates across the two datasets. To
establish whether users do modulate their usage of
Scottish variants when discussing the referendum,
we will need a more careful paired design.

6 Study 2: Effects of topic and audience
on Scotland-specific vocabulary usage

Do tweeters choose Scottish variants at a different
rate when using referendum-related hashtags than
in their other tweets?

6.1 Method

We need a statistic that corrects for the fact that
some variables might have higher rates of Scottish
variants than others. For example if users tend to
produce Scottish variants of variable v1 at a higher
rate than for v2, and use v1 more in tweets that
don’t contain referendum-related hashtags, then it
could appear that users are suppressing their Scot-
tish usage in referendum-related tweets when in
fact this is a lexical effect.

Let U be the set of all users who have used at
least one of the variables in Table 3 in both a tweet
that contains a referendum-related hashtag (i.e. a
tweet that belongs to the IT dataset, referred to
hereafter as an Indyref tweet) and in a tweet that
does not contain a referendum-related hashtag (re-
ferred to hereafter as a Control tweet). For a given
user u ∈ U , let V be the set of all variables that
u has used in at least one Indyref tweet, and in at
least one Control tweet. Let p̂I,v for user u be the

estimated probability that u chooses a Scottish vari-
ant of variable v ∈ V , conditioned on the fact that
she is using variable v in an Indyref tweet. Anal-
ogously, let p̂C,v be the estimated probability that
u chooses a Scottish variant of variable v, condi-
tioned on the fact that she is using variable v in a
Control tweet. The difference in user u’s proba-
bility of choosing a Scottish variant of variable v
in an Indyref tweet and in a Control tweet is then
dv = p̂I,v − p̂C,v. Averaging across all variables,
we define du = 1V

∑
v∈V dv.

The null hypothesis is that on average, users are
no more or less likely to choose Scottish variants
in Indyref tweets than in Control tweets. There-
fore, under the null hypothesis, the mean value of
du across all users, d̄u = 1U

∑
u∈U du, would be

zero. We perform a one-sample t-test to determine
whether d̄u is significantly different than zero.

We use this method to conduct two separate anal-
yses. In the first analysis, our pool of Control
tweets is the set of all tweets from the original fil-
tered dataset that do not contain any of the hashtags
in Table 1. In the second analysis, we limit our pool
of Control tweets to those which do not contain any
of the hashtags from Table 1, but do contain at least
one other hashtag. This second analysis is designed
to test whether the recent finding that US Twitter
users are less likely to use regionally-specific words
in tweets which contain hashtags (Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein, 2015) applies to Scottish users as well.

6.2 Results
The number of tweets and users that were included
in each analysis are shown in Table 6.

Results for the first analysis are shown in the left
column of Table 7. The difference is statistically
significant (p < 0.01), indicating that on average,
individuals are less likely to choose Scottish vari-
ants when using referendum-related hashtags than
in their other tweets. Results for the second analy-
sis are shown in the right column of Table 7. In this
case, the difference is not statistically significant.

6.3 Discussion
In light of (a) the apparent relationship between
national identity and constitutional preference, (b)
the history of Scots as the prestige language of
a previously-independent Scotland, supplanted by
English in large part due to the birth of the United
Kingdom, and (c) the results of Study 1, which
indicate that pro-independence users choose Scot-
tish variants at a significantly higher rate than anti-

independence users—it may at first appear surpris-
ing that people are less likely to choose Scottish
variants in tweets containing referendum-related
hashtags than in their other tweets.

It is conceivable that Yes users increase their
rate of Scottish variants in Indyref tweets whilst
No users decrease it, such that their effects can-
cel out; but since Yes users are more prolific in
the IT dataset, if anything we would expect this
imbalance to make the effect even more positive.
The fact that we see a significant negative effect
in spite of the greater number of Yes tweets means
we can be reasonably confident that even if Yes
users aren’t significantly reducing their usage of
Scottish variants in Indyref tweets, they certainly
aren’t increasing it.

It is also worth noting that we did not exhaus-
tively identify every hashtag that has been used in
relation to the referendum, so inevitably there will
be some tweets with referendum-related hashtags
in the Control set (such as example tweet (3) in §2),
and there may also be some non-referendum tweets
in the Indyref set. However, if anything this would
dilute any differences between the two lists, yet we
still find an effect.

The fact that this effect does not reach signif-
icance when we remove Control tweets without
hashtags suggests that the primary reason users are
reducing their rate of Scottish variants in Indyref
tweets is not because of the topic under discussion,
but because the use of hashtags broadens the po-
tential audience. This explanation accords with
Pavalanathan and Eisenstein’s (2015) finding that

amongst Twitter users in the US, non-standard and
regional variants are less likely to be used in tweets
that target larger audiences. Of course, it is possible
that topic has an effect as well, but the present study
does not provide evidence for that conclusion.

7 Conclusion

We presented the first large-scale study of distinc-
tively Scottish language use on social media, show-
ing that this use includes a mixture of traditional
Scots vocabulary, newer Scottish slang, and alter-
native spellings that reflect Scottish pronunciation.
We also studied how users’ language might reflect
their political views and discourse. We showed that
Yes users use Scottish variants at a higher rate than
No users, whether discussing the independence ref-
erendum or not. But overall, users tend to decrease
their use of Scottish variants when discussing the
referendum. This result suggests that although Yes
users generally express a stronger Scottish linguis-
tic identity than No users, they are not choosing to
express this identity strongly in political discourse
aimed at a broad audience. Due to the very low
rates of Scottish variants overall, our data set is too
small to study differences between individual vari-
ables or even conclusively say whether there may
be effects of both topic and audience size on the use
of Scottish language. However, we hope to be able
to answer these questions in future by collecting a
more complete set of data for the particular users
studied here.
