Abstract

Peer reviewing is a central component
in the scientific publishing process. We
present the first public dataset of scien-
tific peer reviews available for research pur-
poses (PeerRead v1),1 providing an oppor-
tunity to study this important artifact. The
dataset consists of 14.7K paper drafts and
the corresponding accept/reject decisions
in top-tier venues including ACL, NIPS
and ICLR. The dataset also includes 10.7K
textual peer reviews written by experts for
a subset of the papers. We describe the data
collection process and report interesting ob-
served phenomena in the peer reviews. We
also propose two novel NLP tasks based
on this dataset and provide simple base-
line models. In the first task, we show that
simple models can predict whether a paper
is accepted with up to 21% error reduc-
tion compared to the majority baseline. In
the second task, we predict the numerical
scores of review aspects and show that sim-
ple models can outperform the mean base-
line for aspects with high variance such as
‘originality’ and ‘impact’.

1 Introduction

Prestigious scientific venues use peer reviewing to
decide which papers to include in their journals or
proceedings. While this process seems essential
to scientific publication, it is often a subject of de-
bate. Recognizing the important consequences of
peer reviewing, several researchers studied various
aspects of the process, including consistency, bias,
author response and general review quality (e.g.,
Greaves et al., 2006; Ragone et al., 2011; De Silva
and Vance, 2017). For example, the organizers of

1https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead

the NIPS 2014 conference assigned 10% of confer-
ence submissions to two different sets of reviewers
to measure the consistency of the peer reviewing
process, and observed that the two committees dis-
agreed on the accept/reject decision for more than a
quarter of the papers (Langford and Guzdial, 2015).

Despite these efforts, quantitative studies of peer
reviews had been limited, for the most part, to the
few individuals who had access to peer reviews of
a given venue (e.g., journal editors and program
chairs). The goal of this paper is to lower the barrier
to studying peer reviews for the scientific commu-
nity by introducing the first public dataset of peer
reviews for research purposes: PeerRead.

We use three strategies to construct the dataset:
(i) We collaborate with conference chairs and con-
ference management systems to allow authors and
reviewers to opt-in their paper drafts and peer re-
views, respectively. (ii) We crawl publicly available
peer reviews and annotate textual reviews with nu-
merical scores for aspects such as ‘clarity’ and ‘im-
pact’. (iii) We crawl arXiv submissions which co-
incide with important conference submission dates
and check whether a similar paper appears in pro-
ceedings of these conferences at a later date. In
total, the dataset consists of 14.7K paper drafts and
the corresponding accept/reject decisions, includ-
ing a subset of 3K papers for which we have 10.7K
textual reviews written by experts. We plan to
make periodic releases of PeerRead, adding more
sections for new venues every year. We provide
more details on data collection in §2.

The PeerRead dataset can be used in a variety of
ways. A quantitative analysis of the peer reviews
can provide insights to help better understand (and
potentially improve) various nuances of the review
process. For example, in §3, we analyze correla-
tions between the overall recommendation score
and individual aspect scores (e.g., clarity, impact
and originality) and quantify how reviews recom-

mending an oral presentation differ from those rec-
ommending a poster. Other examples might in-
clude aligning review scores with authors to reveal
gender or nationality biases. From a pedagogical
perspective, the PeerRead dataset also provides in-
experienced authors and first-time reviewers with
diverse examples of peer reviews.

As an NLP resource, peer reviews raise interest-
ing challenges, both from the realm of sentiment
analysis—predicting various properties of the re-
viewed paper, e.g., clarity and novelty, as well as
that of text generation—given a paper, automati-
cally generate its review. Such NLP tasks, when
solved with sufficiently high quality, might help
reviewers, area chairs and program chairs in the
reviewing process, e.g., by lowering the number of
reviewers needed for some paper submission.

In §4, we introduce two new NLP tasks based on
this dataset: (i) predicting whether a given paper
would be accepted to some venue, and (ii) pre-
dicting the numerical score of certain aspects of
a paper. Our results show that we can predict the
accept/reject decisions with 6–21% error reduction
compared to the majority reject-all baseline, in four
different sections of PeerRead. Since the baseline
models we use are fairly simple, there is plenty of
room to develop stronger models to make better
predictions.

2 Peer-Review Dataset (PeerRead)

Here we describe the collection and compilation of
PeerRead, our scientific peer-review dataset. For
an overview of the dataset, see Table 1.

2.1 Review Collection
Reviews in PeerRead belong to one of the two
categories:

Opted-in reviews. We coordinated with the
Softconf conference management system and the
conference chairs for CoNLL 20162 and ACL
20173 conferences to allow authors and review-
ers to opt-in their drafts and reviews, respectively,
to be included in this dataset. A submission is in-
cluded only if (i) the corresponding author opts-in
the paper draft, and (ii) at least one of the review-
ers opts-in their anonymous reviews. This resulted
in 39 reviews for 22 CoNLL 2016 submissions,
and 275 reviews for 137 ACL 2017 submissions.
Reviews include both text and aspect scores (e.g.,
calrity) on a scale of 1–5.

Peer reviews on the web. In 2013, the NIPS
conference4 began attaching all accepted papers
with their anonymous textual review comments, as
well as a confidence level on a scale of 1–3. We
collected all accepted papers and their reviews for
NIPS 2013–2017, a total of 9,152 reviews for 2,420
papers.

Another source of reviews is the OpenReview
platform:5 a conference management system which
promotes open access and open peer reviewing.
Reviews include text, as well as numerical rec-
ommendations between 1–10 and confidence level
between 1–5. We collected all submissions to the
ICLR 2017 conference,6 a total of 1,304 official,
anonymous reviews for 427 papers (177 accepted
and 255 rejected).7

2.2 arXiv Submissions
arXiv8 is a popular platform for pre-publishing re-
search in various scientific fields including physics,
computer science and biology. While arXiv does
not contain reviews, we automatically label a sub-
set of arXiv submissions in the years 2007–2017
(inclusive)9 as accepted or probably-rejected, with

Language Learning; http://www.conll.org/2016

tational Linguistics; http://acl2017.org/

6The 5th International Conference on Learning Represen-

tations; https://iclr.cc/archive/www/2017.html

by adding a comment, but we only use the official reviews of
reviewers assigned to review that paper.

of each paper (accepted or rejected) in the dataset.

respect to a group of top-tier NLP, ML and AI
venues: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, TACL,
NIPS, ICML, ICLR and AAAI.

Accepted papers. In order to assign ‘accepted’
labels, we use the dataset provided by Sutton and
Gong (2017) who matched arXiv submissions to
their bibliographic entries in the DBLP directory10

by comparing titles and author names using Jac-
card’s distance. To improve our coverage, we also
add an arXiv submission if its title matches an ac-
cepted paper in one of our target venues with a
relative Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966)
of < 0.1. This results in a total of 2,891 accepted
papers.

Probably-rejected papers. We use the follow-
ing criteria to assign a ‘probably-rejected’ label for
an arXiv submission:
• The paper wasn’t accepted to any of the target

venues.11

• The paper was submitted to one of the arXiv
categories cs.cl, cs.lg or cs.ai.12

• The paper wasn’t cross-listed in any non-cs cat-
egories.
• The submission date13 was within one month of

the submission deadlines of our target venues
(before or after).
• The submission date coincides with at least one

of the arXiv papers accepted for one of the target
venues.
This process results in 8,887 ‘probably-rejected’

papers.
Data quality. We did a simple sanity check

in order to estimate the number of papers that we
labeled as ‘probably-rejected’, but were in fact ac-
cepted to one of the target venues. Some authors
add comments to their arXiv submissions to indi-
cate the publication venue. We identified arXiv
papers with a comment which matches the term
“accept” along with any of our target venues (e.g.,
“nips”), but not the term “workshop”. We found
364 papers which matched these criteria, 352 out
of which were labeled as ‘accepted’. Manual in-
spection of the remaining 12 papers showed that
one of the papers was indeed a false negative (i.e.,
labeled as ‘probably-rejected’ but accepted to one
of the target venues) due to a significant change in

11Note that some of the ‘probably-rejected’ papers may be

published at workshops or other venues.

tion of the computer science categories in arXiv.

sion date of the first version.

the paper title. The remaining 11 papers were not
accepted to any of the target venues (e.g., “accepted
at WMT@ACL 2014”).

2.3 Organization and Preprocessing

We organize v1.0 of the PeerRead dataset in five
sections: CoNLL 2016, ACL 2017, ICLR 2017,
NIPS 2013–2017 and arXiv 2007–2017.14 Since
the data collection varies across sections, differ-
ent sections may have different license agreements.
The papers in each section are further split into
standard training, development and test sets with
0.9:0.05:0.05 ratios. In addition to the PDF file of
each paper, we also extract its textual content using
the Science Parse library.15 We represent each
of the splits as a json-encoded text file with a list
of paper objects, each of which consists of paper
details, accept/reject/probably-reject decision, and
a list of reviews.

2.4 Aspect Score Annotations

In many publication venues, reviewers assign nu-
meric aspect scores (e.g., clarity, originality, sub-
stance) as part of the peer review. Aspect scores
could be viewed as a structured summary of the
strengths and weaknesses of a paper. While aspect
scores assigned by reviewers are included in the
opted-in sections in PeerRead, they are missing
from the remaining reviews. In order to increase
the utility of the dataset, we annotated 1.3K reviews
with aspect scores, based on the corresponding re-
view text. Annotations were done by two of the
authors. In this subsection, we describe the annota-
tion process in detail.

Feasibility study. As a first step, we verified
the feasibility of the annotation task by annotating
nine reviews for which aspect scores are available.
The annotators were able to infer about half of the
aspect scores from the corresponding review text
(the other half was not discussed in the review text).
This is expected since reviewer comments often
focus on the key strengths or weaknesses of the
paper and are not meant to be a comprehensive as-
sessment of each aspect. On average, the absolute
difference between our annotated scores and the
gold scores originally provided by reviewers is 0.51
(on a 1–5 scale, considering only those cases where
the aspect was discussed in the review text).

14We plan to periodicly release new versions of PeerRead.

1649



Data preprocessing. We used the official re-
views in the ICLR 2017 section of the dataset
for this annotation task. We excluded unofficial
comments contributed by arbitrary members of
the community, comments made by the authors
in response to other comments, as well as “meta-
reviews” which state the final decision on a paper
submission. The remaining 1,304 official reviews
are all written by anonymous reviewers assigned
by the program committee to review a particular
submission. We randomly reordered the reviews
before annotation so that the annotator judgments
based on one review are less affected by other re-
views of the same paper.

Annotation guidelines. We annotated seven
aspects for each review: appropriateness, clar-
ity, originality, soundness/correctness, meaning-
ful comparison, substance, and impact. For each
aspect, we provided our annotators with the in-
structions given to ACL 2016 reviewers for this
aspect.16 Our annotators’ task was to read the de-
tailed review text (346 words on average) and select
a score between 1–5 (inclusive, integers only) for
each aspect.17 When review comments do not ad-
dress a specific aspect, we do not select any score
for that aspect, and instead use a special “not dis-
cussed” value.

Data quality. In order to assess annotation
consistency, the same annotators re-annotated a
random sample consisting of 30 reviews. On aver-
age, 77% of the annotations were consistent (i.e.,
the re-annotation was exactly the same as the origi-
nal annotation, or was off by 1 point) and 2% were
inconsistent (i.e., the re-annotation was off by 2
points or more). In the remaining 21%, the as-
pect was marked as “not discussed” in one anno-
tation but not in the other. We note that different
aspects are discussed in the textual reviews at differ-
ent rates. For example, about 49% of the reviews
discussed the ‘originality’ aspect, while only 5%
discussed ‘appropriateness’.

3 Data-Driven Analysis of Peer Reviews

In this section, we showcase the potential of using
PeerRead for data-driven analysis of peer reviews.

Overall recommendation vs. aspect scores.
A critical part of each review is the overall rec-
ommendation score, a numeric value which best

16Instructions are provided in Appendix B.
17Importantly, our annotators only considered the review

text, and did not have access to the papers.

characterizes a reviewer’s judgment of whether the
draft should be accepted for publication in this
venue. While aspect scores (e.g., clarity, novelty,
impact) help explain a reviewer’s assessment of the
submission, it is not necessarily clear which aspects
reviewers appreciate the most about a submission
when considering their overall recommendation.

To address this question, we measure pair-wise
correlations between the overall recommendation
and various aspect scores in the ACL 2017 section
of PeerRead and report the results in Table 2.

Aspect ρ

Substance 0.59
Clarity 0.42

Appropriateness 0.30
Impact 0.16

Meaningful comparison 0.15
Originality 0.08

Soundness/Correctness 0.01

Table 2: Pearson’s correlation coefficient ρ be-
tween the overall recommendation and various as-
pect scores in the ACL 2017 section of PeerRead.

The aspects which correlate most strongly with
the final recommendation are substance (which con-
cerns the amount of work rather than its quality)
and clarity. In contrast, soundness/correctness and
originality are least correlated with the final rec-
ommendation. These observations raise interesting
questions about what we collectively care about
the most as a research community when evaluating
paper submissions.

Oral vs. poster. In most NLP conferences, ac-
cepted submissions may be selected for an oral pre-
sentation or a poster presentation. The presentation
format decision of accepted papers is based on rec-
ommendation by the reviewers. In the official blog
of ACL 2017,18 the program chairs recommend
that reviewers and area chairs make this decision
based on the expected size of interested audience
and whether the ideas can be grasped without back-
and-forth discussion. However, it remains unclear
what criteria are used by reviewers to make this
decision.

To address this question, we compute the mean
aspect score in reviews which recommend an oral
vs. poster presentation in the ACL 2017 section of

PeerRead, and report the results in Table 3. No-
tably, the average ‘overall recommendation’ score
in reviews recommending an oral presentation is
0.9 higher than in reviews recommending a poster
presentation, suggesting that reviewers tend to rec-
ommend oral presentation for submissions which
are holistically stronger.

Presentation format Oral Poster ∆ stdev

Recommendation 3.83 2.92 0.90 0.89
Substance 3.91 3.29 0.62 0.84

Clarity 4.19 3.72 0.47 0.90

Originality 3.91 3.88 0.02 0.87

Soundness/Correctness 3.93 4.18 -0.25 0.91

Table 3: Mean review scores for each presenta-
tion format (oral vs. poster). Raw scores range
between 1–5. For reference, the last column shows
the sample standard deviation based on all reviews.

ACL 2017 vs. ICLR 2017. Table 4 reports
the sample mean and standard deviation of various
measurements based on reviews in the ACL 2017
and the ICLR 2017 sections of PeerRead. Most
of the mean scores are similar in both sections,
with a few notable exceptions. The comments in
ACL 2017 reviews tend to be about 50% longer
than those in the ICLR 2017 reviews. Since re-
view length is often thought of as a measure of its
quality, this raises interesting questions about the
quality of reviews in ICLR vs. ACL conferences.
We note, however, that ACL 2017 reviews were
explicitly opted-in while the ICLR 2017 reviews
include all official reviews, which is likely to re-
sult in a positive bias in review quality of the ACL
reviews included in this study.

Another interesting observation is that the mean
appropriateness score is lower in ICLR 2017 com-
pared to ACL 2017. While this might indicate
that ICLR 2017 attracted more irrelevant submis-
sions, this is probably an artifact of our annotation
process: reviewers probably only address appro-
priateness explicitly in their review if the paper is
inappropriate, which leads to a strong negative bias
against this category in our ICLR dataset.

4 NLP Tasks

Aside from quantitatively analyzing peer reviews,
PeerRead can also be used to define interesting

measurements on reviews in the ACL 2017 and
ICLR 2017 sections of PeerRead. Note that ACL
aspects were written by the reviewers themselves,
while ICLR aspects were predicted by our annota-
tors based on the review.

NLP tasks. In this section, we introduce two novel
tasks based on the PeerRead dataset. In the first
task, given a paper draft, we predict whether the
paper will be accepted to a set of target conferences.
In the second task, given a textual review, we pre-
dict the aspect scores for the paper such as novelty,
substance and meaningful comparison.19

Both these tasks are not only challenging from
an NLP perspective, but also have potential appli-
cations. For example, models for predicting the
accept/reject decisions of a paper draft might be
used in recommendation systems for arXiv submis-
sions. Also, a model trained to predict the aspect
scores given review comments using thousands of
training examples might result in better-calibrated
scores.

4.1 Paper Acceptance Classification

Paper acceptance classification is a binary classifi-
cation task: given a paper draft, predict whether the
paper will be accepted or rejected for a predefined
set of venues.

Models. We train a binary classifier to estimate
the probability of accept vs. reject given a paper,
i.e., P(accept=True | paper). We experiment
with different types of classifiers: logistic regres-
sion, SVM with linear or RBF kernels, Random
Forest, Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Multi-
layer Perceptron, AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. We
use hand-engineered features, instead of neural
models, because they are easier to interpret.

19We also experiment with conditioning on the paper itself
to make this prediction.

Table 5: Test accuracies (%) for acceptance classi-

We use 22 coarse features, e.g., length of the
title and whether jargon terms such as ‘deep’ and
‘neural’ appear in the abstract, as well as sparse
and dense lexical features. The full feature set is
detailed in Appendix A.

Experimental setup. We experiment with the
ICLR 2017 and the arXiv sections of the PeerRead
dataset. We train separate models for each of the
arXiv category: cs.cl, cs.lg, and cs.ai. We
use python’s sklearn’s implementation of all mod-
els (Pedregosa et al., 2011).20 We consider various
regularization parameters for SVM and logistic re-
gression (see Appendix A.1 for a detailed descrip-
tion of all hyperparameters). We use the standard
test split and tune our hyperparameters using 5-fold
cross validation on the training set.

Results. Table 5 shows our test accuracies
for the paper acceptance task. Our best model
outperforms the majority classifier in all cases, with
up to 22% error reduction. Since our models lack
the sophistication to assess the quality of the work
discussed in the given paper, this might indicate
that some of the features we define are correlated
with strong papers, or bias reviewers’ judgments.

We run an ablation study for this task for the
ICLR and arXiv sections. We train only one model
for all three categories in arXiv to simplify our
analysis. Table 6 shows the absolute degradation in
test accuracy of the best performing model when
we remove one of the features. The table shows
that some features have a large contribution on
the classification decision: adding an appendix, a
large number of theorems or equations, the average
length of the text preceding a citation, the number
of papers cited by this paper that were published in
the five years before the submission of this paper,
whether the abstract contains a phrase “state of the
art” for ICLR or “neural” for arXiv, and length of
title.21

X, num_uniq_words: number of unique words,
num_refmentions: number of reference mentions,
and #recent_refs: number of cited papers published
in the last five years.

4.2 Review Aspect Score Prediction
The second task is a multi-class regression task
to predict scores for seven review aspects: ‘im-
pact’, ‘substance’, ‘appropriateness’, ‘comparison’,
‘soundness’, ‘originality’ and ‘clarity’. For this
task, we use the two sections of PeerRead which
include aspect scores: ACL 2017 and ICLR 2017.22

Models. We use a regression model which
predicts a floating-point score for each aspect of
interest given a sequence of tokens. We train three
variants of the model to condition on (i) the paper
text only, (ii) the review text only, or (iii) both paper
and review text.

We use three neural architectures: convolutional
neural networks (CNN, Zhang et al., 2015), re-
current neural networks (LSTM, Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997), and deep averaging networks
(DAN, Iyyer et al., 2015). In all three architectures,
we use a linear output layer to make the final pre-
diction. The loss function is the mean squared error
between predicted and gold scores. We compare
against a baseline which always predicts the mean
score of an aspect, computed on the training set.23

Experimental setup. We train all models on
the standard training set for 100 iterations, and

22The CoNLL 2016 section also includes aspect scores but
is too small for training.

23This baseline is guaranteed to obtain mean square errors
less than or equal to the majority baseline.

select the best performing model on the standard
development set. We use a single 100 dimension
layer LSTM and CNN, and a single output layer of
100 dimensions for all models. We use GloVe 840B
embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) as input word
representations, without tuning, and keep the 35K
most frequent words and replace the rest with an
UNK vector. The CNN model uses 128 filters and 5
kernels. We use an RMSProp optimizer (Tieleman
and Hinton, 2012) with 0.001 learning rate, 0.9
decay rate, 5.0 gradient clipping, and a batch size
of 32. Since scientific papers tend to be long, we
only take the first 1000 and 200 tokens of each
paper and review, respectively, and concatenate the
two prefixes when the model conditions on both
the paper and review text.24

Results. Figure 1 shows the test set root mean
square error (RMSE) on the aspect prediction task
(lower is better). For each section (ACL 2017 and
ICLR 2017), and for each aspect, we report the
results of four systems: ‘Mean’ (baseline), ‘Paper’,
‘Review’ and ‘Paper;Review’ (i.e., which informa-
tion the model conditions on). For each variant, the
model which performs best on the development set
is selected.

We note that aspects with higher RMSE scores
for the ‘Mean’ baseline indicate higher variance
among the review scores for this aspect, so we fo-
cus our discussion on these aspects. In the ACL
2017 section, the two aspects with the highest vari-
ance are ‘originality’ and ‘clarity’. In the ICLR
2017 section, the two aspects with the highest vari-
ance are ‘appropriateness’ and ‘meaningful com-
parison’. Surprisingly, the ‘Paper;Review’ model
outperforms the ‘Mean’ baseline in all four aspects,
and the ‘Review’ model outperforms the ‘Mean’

tential uses of PeerRead, rather than develop the best model to
address this task, which explains the simplicity of the models
we use.

baseline in three out of four. On average, all models
slightly improve over the ‘Mean’ baseline.

5 Related Work

Several efforts have recently been made to collect
peer reviews. Publons25 consolidates peer reviews
data to build public reviewer profiles for partici-
pating reviewers. Crossref maintains the database
of DOIs for its 4000+ publisher members. They
recently launched a service to add peer reviews as
part of metadata for the scientific articles.26 Sur-
prisingly, however, most of the reviews are not
made publicly available. In contrast, we collected
and organized PeerRead such that it is easy for
other researchers to use it for research purposes,
replicate experiments and make a fair comparison
to previous results.

There have been several efforts to analyze the
peer review process (e.g., Bonaccorsi et al., 2018;
Rennie, 2016). Editors of the British Journal of
Psychiatry found differences in courtesy between
signed and unsigned reviews (Walsh et al., 2000).
Ragone et al. (2011) and Birukou et al. (2011) an-
alyzed ten CS conferences and found low corre-
lation between review scores and the impact of
papers in terms of future number of citations. Fang
et al. (2016) presented similar observations for NIH
grant application reviews and their productivity.
Langford and Guzdial (2015) pointed to inconsis-
tencies in the peer review process.

Several recent venues had single vs. double blind
review experiments, which pointed to single-blind
reviews leading to increased biases towards male
authors (Roberts and Verhoef, 2016) and famous in-
stitutions (Tomkins et al., 2017). Further, Le Goues
et al. (2017) showed that reviewers are unable to

successfully guess the identity of the author in a
double-blind review. Recently, there have been
several initiatives by program chairs in major NLP
conferences to study various aspects of the review
process, mostly author response and general re-
view quality.27 In this work, we provide a large
scale dataset that would enable the wider scientific
community to further study the properties of peer
review, and potentially come up with enhancements
to current peer review model.

Finally, the peer review process is meant to judge
the quality of research work being disseminated
to the larger research community. With the ever-
growing rates of articles being submitted to top-
tier conferences in Computer Science and pre-print
repositories (Sutton and Gong, 2017), there is a
need to expedite the peer review process. Bal-
achandran (2013) proposed a method for automatic
analysis of conference submissions to recommend
relevant reviewers. Also related to our acceptance
predicting task are (Tsur and Rappoport, 2009)
and Ashok et al. (2013), both of which focuses
on predicting book reviews. Various automatic
tools like Grammerly28 can assist reviewers in dis-
covering grammar and spelling errors. Tools like
Citeomatic29 (Bhagavatula et al., 2018) are espe-
cially useful in finding relevant articles not cited
in the manuscript. We believe that the NLP tasks
presented in this paper, predicting the acceptance
of a paper and the aspect scores of a review, can
potentially serve as useful tools for writing a paper,
reviewing it, and deciding about its acceptance.

6 Conclusion

We introduced PeerRead, the first publicly avail-
able peer review dataset for research purposes, con-
taining 14.7K papers and 10.7K reviews. We ana-
lyzed the dataset, showing interesting trends such
as a high correlation between overall recommenda-
tion and recommending an oral presentation. We
defined two novel tasks based on PeerRead: (i) pre-
dicting the acceptance of a paper based on textual
features and (ii) predicting the score of each aspect
in a review based on the paper and review contents.
Our experiments show that certain properties of a

paper, such as having an appendix, are correlated
with higher acceptance rate. Our primary goal is
to motivate other researchers to explore these tasks
and develop better models that outperform the ones
used in this work. More importantly, we hope that
other researchers will identify novel opportunities
which we have not explored to analyze the peer
reviews in this dataset. As a concrete example, it
would be interesting to study if the accept/reject
decisions reflect author demographic biases (e.g.,
nationality).

Appendices

A Acceptance Classification Features

Table 7 shows the features used by our acceptance
classification model. Figure 2 shows the coeffi-
cients of all our features as learned by our best
classifier on both datasets.

A.1 Hyperparameters
This section describes the hyperparameters used
in our acceptance classification experiment. Un-
less stated otherwise, we used the sklearn default
hyperparameters. For decision tree and random
forest, we used maximum depth=5. For the latter,
we also used max_features=1. For MLP, we used
α = 1. For k-nearest neighbors, we used k = 3. For
logistic regression, we considered both l1 and l2
penalty.

2 ​ ​=​ ​Leaning ​ ​against:​ ​I'd ​ ​rather​ ​not​ ​see ​ ​it​ ​in ​ ​the ​ ​conference.  
1 ​ ​=​ ​Poor:​ ​I'd ​ ​fight​ ​to ​ ​have ​ ​it​ ​rejected. 
 
REVIEWER​ ​CONFIDENCE​ ​(1-5) 
5 ​ ​=​ ​Positive ​ ​that​ ​my​ ​evaluation ​ ​is​ ​correct.​ ​I​ ​read ​ ​the ​ ​paper​ ​very​ ​carefully​ ​and ​ ​am​ ​familiar​ ​with 
related ​ ​work.  
4 ​ ​=​ ​Quite ​ ​sure.​ ​I​ ​tried ​ ​to ​ ​check​ ​the ​ ​important​ ​points​ ​carefully.​ ​It's​ ​unlikely,​ ​though ​ ​conceivable, 
that​ ​I​ ​missed ​ ​something ​ ​that​ ​should ​ ​affect​ ​my​ ​ratings.  
3 ​ ​=​ ​Pretty​ ​sure,​ ​but​ ​there's​ ​a ​ ​chance ​ ​I​ ​missed ​ ​something.​ ​Although ​ ​I​ ​have ​ ​a ​ ​good ​ ​feel ​ ​for​ ​this 
area ​ ​in ​ ​general,​ ​I​ ​did ​ ​not​ ​carefully​ ​check​ ​the ​ ​paper's​ ​details,​ ​e.g.,​ ​the ​ ​math,​ ​experimental ​ ​design, 
or​ ​novelty.  
2 ​ ​=​ ​Willing ​ ​to ​ ​defend ​ ​my​ ​evaluation,​ ​but​ ​it​ ​is​ ​fairly​ ​likely​ ​that​ ​I​ ​missed ​ ​some ​ ​details,​ ​didn't 
understand ​ ​some ​ ​central ​ ​points,​ ​or​ ​can't​ ​be ​ ​sure ​ ​about​ ​the ​ ​novelty​ ​of​ ​the ​ ​work.  
1 ​ ​=​ ​Not​ ​my​ ​area,​ ​or​ ​paper​ ​is​ ​very​ ​hard ​ ​to ​ ​understand.​ ​My​ ​evaluation ​ ​is​ ​just​ ​an ​ ​educated ​ ​guess.
