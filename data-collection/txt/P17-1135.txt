Abstract

The state-of-the-art named entity recog-
nition (NER) systems are supervised ma-
chine learning models that require large
amounts of manually annotated data to
achieve high accuracy. However, anno-
tating NER data by human is expensive
and time-consuming, and can be quite dif-
ficult for a new language. In this pa-
per, we present two weakly supervised ap-
proaches for cross-lingual NER with no
human annotation in a target language.
The first approach is to create automati-
cally labeled NER data for a target lan-
guage via annotation projection on compa-
rable corpora, where we develop a heuris-
tic scheme that effectively selects good-
quality projection-labeled data from noisy
data. The second approach is to project
distributed representations of words (word
embeddings) from a target language to
a source language, so that the source-
language NER system can be applied to
the target language without re-training.
We also design two co-decoding schemes
that effectively combine the outputs of
the two projection-based approaches. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed
approaches on both in-house and open
NER data for several target languages.
The results show that the combined sys-
tems outperform three other weakly super-
vised approaches on the CoNLL data.

1 Introduction

Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamen-
tal information extraction task that automatically
detects named entities in text and classifies them
into pre-defined entity types such as PERSON,
ORGANIZATION, GPE (GeoPolitical Entities),

EVENT, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, etc. NER
provides essential inputs for many information ex-
traction applications, including relation extraction,
entity linking, question answering and text min-
ing. Building fast and accurate NER systems is
a crucial step towards enabling large-scale auto-
mated information extraction and knowledge dis-
covery on the huge volumes of electronic docu-
ments existing today.

The state-of-the-art NER systems are super-
vised machine learning models (Nadeau and
Sekine, 2007), including maximum entropy
Markov models (MEMMs) (McCallum et al.,
2000), conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty
et al., 2001) and neural networks (Collobert et al.,
2011; Lample et al., 2016). To achieve high ac-
curacy, a NER system needs to be trained with
a large amount of manually annotated data, and
is often supplied with language-specific resources
(e.g., gazetteers, word clusters, etc.). Annotating
NER data by human is rather expensive and time-
consuming, and can be quite difficult for a new
language. This creates a big challenge in building
NER systems of multiple languages for supporting
multilingual information extraction applications.

The difficulty of acquiring supervised annota-
tion raises the following question: given a well-
trained NER system in a source language (e.g.,
English), how can one go about extending it to
a new language with decent performance and no
human annotation in the target language? There
are mainly two types of approaches for building
weakly supervised cross-lingual NER systems.

The first type of approaches create weakly la-
beled NER training data in a target language. One
way to create weakly labeled data is through an-
notation projection on aligned parallel corpora or
translations between a source language and a tar-
get language, e.g., (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Zitouni
and Florian, 2008; Ehrmann et al., 2011). An-
other way is to utilize the text and structure of

Wikipedia to generate weakly labeled multilingual
training annotations, e.g., (Richman and Schone,
2008; Nothman et al., 2013; Al-Rfou et al., 2015).

The second type of approaches are based on di-
rect model transfer, e.g., (Täckström et al., 2012;
Tsai et al., 2016). The basic idea is to train a single
NER system in the source language with language
independent features, so the system can be applied
to other languages using those universal features.

In this paper, we make the following contri-
butions to weakly supervised cross-lingual NER
with no human annotation in the target languages.
First, for the annotation projection approach, we
develop a heuristic, language-independent data se-
lection scheme that seeks to select good-quality
projection-labeled NER data from comparable
corpora. Experimental results show that the data
selection scheme can significantly improve the ac-
curacy of the target-language NER system when
the alignment quality is low and the projection-
labeled data are noisy.

Second, we propose a new approach for direct
NER model transfer based on representation pro-
jection. It projects word representations in vector
space (word embeddings) from a target language
to a source language, to create a universal repre-
sentation of the words in different languages. Un-
der this approach, the NER system trained for the
source language can be directly applied to the tar-
get language without the need for re-training.

Finally, we design two co-decoding schemes
that combine the outputs (views) of the two
projection-based systems to produce an output that
is more accurate than the outputs of individual sys-
tems. We evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed approaches on both in-house and open NER
data sets for a number of target languages. The re-
sults show that the combined systems outperform
the state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER approaches
proposed in Täckström et al. (2012), Nothman
et al. (2013) and Tsai et al. (2016) on the CoNLL
NER test data (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong
Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

We organize the paper as follows. In Section
2 we introduce three NER models that are used
in the paper. In Section 3 we present an anno-
tation projection approach with effective data se-
lection. In Section 4 we propose a representation
projection approach for direct NER model trans-
fer. In Section 5 we describe two co-decoding
schemes that effectively combine the outputs of

two projection-based approaches. In Section 6
we evaluate the performance of the proposed ap-
proaches. We describe related work in Section 7
and conclude the paper in Section 8.

2 NER Models

The NER task can be formulated as a sequence
labeling problem: given a sequence of words
x1, ..., xn, we want to infer the NER tag li for each
word xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this section we introduce
three NER models that are used in the paper.

2.1 CRFs and MEMMs
Conditional random fields (CRFs) are a class of
discriminative probabilistic graphical models that
provide powerful tools for labeling sequential data
(Lafferty et al., 2001). CRFs learn a conditional
probability model pλ(l|x) from a set of labeled
training data, where x = (x1, ...,xn) is a random
sequence of input words, l = (l1, ..., ln) is the se-
quence of label variables (NER tags) for x, and l
has certain Markov properties conditioned on x.
Specifically, a general-order CRF with order o as-
sumes that label variable li is dependent on a fixed
number o of previous label variables li−1, ..., li−o,
with the following conditional distribution:

pλ(l|x) =
e
∑n

i=1

∑K
k=1 λkfk(li,li−1,...,li−o,x)

Zλ(x)
(1)

where fk’s are feature functions, λk’s are weights
of the feature functions (parameters to learn), and
Zλ(x) is a normalization constant. When o = 1,
we have a first-order CRF which is also known as
a linear-chain CRF.

Given a set of labeled training data D =
(x(j), l(j))j=1,...,N , we seek to find an optimal set
of parameters λ∗ that maximize the conditional
log-likelihood of the data:

λ∗ = arg max
λ

N∑

j=1

log pλ(l
(j)|x(j)) (2)

Once we obtain λ∗, we can use the trained model
pλ∗(l|x) to decode the most likely label sequence
l∗ for any new input sequence of words x (via the
Viterbi algorithm for example):

l∗ = arg max
l
pλ∗(l|x) (3)

A related conditional probability model, called
maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM) (Mc-
Callum et al., 2000), assumes that l is a Markov

chain conditioned on x:

pλ(l|x) =
n∏

i=1

pλ(li|li−1, ..., li−o,x)

=
n∏

i=1

e
∑K

k=1 λkfk(li,li−1,...,li−o,x)

Zλ(li−1, ..., li−o,x)
(4)

The main difference between CRFs and
MEMMs is that CRFs normalize the conditional
distribution over the whole sequence as in (1),
while MEMMs normalize the conditional distribu-
tion per token as in (4). As a result, CRFs can bet-
ter handle the label bias problem (Lafferty et al.,
2001). This benefit, however, comes at a price.
The training time of order-o CRFs grows exponen-
tially (O(Mo+1)) with the number of output labels
M , which is typically slow even for moderate-size
training data ifM is large. In contrast, the training
time of order-o MEMMs is linear (O(M)) with
respect to M independent of o, so it can handle
larger training data with higher order of depen-
dency. We have implemented both a linear-chain
CRF model and a general-order MEMM model.

2.2 Neural Networks

With the increasing popularity of distributed (vec-
tor) representations of words, neural network
models have recently been applied to tackle many
NLP tasks including NER (Collobert et al., 2011;
Lample et al., 2016).

We have implemented a feedforward neural net-
work model which maximizes the log-likelihood
of the training data similar to that of (Collobert
et al., 2011). We adopt a locally normalized model
(the conditional distribution is normalized per to-
ken as in MEMMs) and introduce context depen-
dency by conditioning on the previously assigned
tags. We use a target word and its surrounding
context as features. We do not use other common
features such as gazetteers or character-level rep-
resentations as such features might not be readily
available or might not transfer to other languages.

We have deployed two neural network architec-
tures. The first one (called NN1) uses the word
embedding of a word as the input. The sec-
ond one (called NN2) adds a smoothing proto-
type layer that computes the cosine similarity be-
tween a word embedding and a fixed set of proto-
type vectors (learned during training) and returns
a weighted average of these prototype vectors as
the input. In our experiments we find that with the

models: left-NN1, right-NN2.

smoothing layer, NN2 tends to have a more bal-
anced precision and recall than NN1. Both net-
works have one hidden layer, with sigmoid and
softmax activation functions on the hidden and
output layers respectively. The two neural network
models are depicted in Figure 1.

3 Annotation Projection Approach

The existing annotation projection approaches re-
quire parallel corpora or translations between
a source language and a target language with
alignment information. In this paper, we de-
velop a heuristic, language-independent data se-
lection scheme that seeks to select good-quality
projection-labeled data from noisy comparable
corpora. We use English as the source language.

Suppose we have comparable1 sentence
pairs (X,Y) between English and a target lan-
guage, where X includes N English sentences
x(1), ...,x(N), Y includes N target-language
sentences y(1), ...,y(N), and y(j) is aligned to
x(j) via an alignment model, 1 ≤ j ≤ N . We use
a sentence pair (x,y) as an example to illustrate
how the annotation projection procedure works,
where x = (x1, x2, ..., xs) is an English sentence,
and y = (y1, y2, ..., yt) is a target-language
sentence that is aligned to x.

Annotation Projection Procedure

1. Apply the English NER system on the En-
glish sentence x to generate the NER tags
l = (l1, l2, ..., ls) for x.

2. Project the NER tags to the target-language
sentence y using the alignment informa-
tion. Specifically, if a sequence of English
words (xi, ..., xi+p) is aligned to a sequence
of target-language words (yj , ..., yj+q), and
(xi, ..., xi+p) is recognized (by the English
NER system) as an entity with NER tag l,

1Ideally, the sentences would be translations of each other,
but we only require possibly parallel sentences.

1472



then (yj , ..., yj+q) is labeled with l2.
Let l′ = (l′1, l

′
2, ..., l

′
t) be the projected NER

tags for the target-language sentence y.

We can apply the annotation projection proce-
dure on all the sentence pairs (X,Y), to generate
projected NER tags L′ for the target-language sen-
tences Y. (Y, L′) are automatically labeled NER
data with no human annotation in the target lan-
guage. One can use those projection-labeled data
to train an NER system in the target language. The
quality of such weakly labeled NER data, and con-
sequently the accuracy of the target-language NER
system, depend on both 1) the accuracy of the En-
glish NER system, and 2) the alignment accuracy
of the sentence pairs.

Since we don’t require actual translations, but
only comparable data, the downside is that if some
of the data are not actually parallel and if we use
all for weakly supervised learning, the accuracy
of the target-language NER system might be ad-
versely affected. We are therefore motivated to
design effective data selection schemes that can
select good-quality projection-labeled data from
noisy data, to improve the accuracy of the anno-
tation projection approach for cross-lingual NER.

3.1 Data Selection Scheme
We first design a metric to measure the annotation
quality of a projection-labeled sentence in the tar-
get language. We construct a frequency table T
which includes all the entities in the projection-
labeled target-language sentences. For each entity
e, T also includes the projected NER tags for e
and the relative frequency (empirical probability)
P̂ (l|e) that entity e is labeled with tag l. Table 1
shows a snapshot of the frequency table where the
target language is Portuguese.

We use P̂ (l|e) to measure the reliability of la-
beling entity e with tag l in the target language.
The intuition is that if an entity e is labeled by a
tag l with higher frequency than other tags in the
projection-labeled data, it is more likely that the
annotation is correct. For example, if the joint ac-
curacy of the source NER system and alignment
system is greater than 0.5, then the correct tag of
a random entity will have a higher relative fre-
quency than other tags in a large enough sample.

Based on the frequency scores, we calculate
the quality score of a projection-labeled target-

2If the IOB (Inside, Outside, Beginning) tagging format is
used, then (yj , yj+1, ..., yj+q) is labeled with (B-l, I-l,...,I-l).

tados Unidos is GPE which has the highest relative

language sentence y by averaging the frequency
scores of the projected entities in the sentence:

q(y) =
Σe∈yP̂ (l′(e)|e)

n(y)
(5)

where l′(e) is the projected NER tag for e, and
n(y) is the total number of entities in sentence y.

We use q(y) to measure the annotation quality
of sentence y, and n(y) to measure the amount
of annotation information contained in sentence y.
We design a heuristic data selection scheme which
selects projection-labeled sentences in the target
language that satisfy the following condition:

q(y) ≥ q; n(y) ≥ n (6)

where q is a quality score threshold and n is an
entity number threshold. We can tune the two pa-
rameters to make tradeoffs among the annotation
quality of the selected sentences, the annotation
information contained in the selected sentences,
and the total number of sentence selected.

One way to select the threshold parameters q
and n is via a development set - either a small
set of human-annotated data or a sample of the
projection-labeled data. We select the threshold
parameters via coordinate search using the devel-
opment set: we first fix n = 3 and search the best q̂
in [0, 0.9] with a step size of 0.1; we then fix q = q̂
and select the best n̂ in [1, 5] with a step size of 1.

3.2 Accuracy Improvements
We evaluate the effectiveness of the data selection
scheme via experiments on 4 target languages:
Japanese, Korean, German and Portuguese. We
use comparable corpora between English and each
target language (ranging from 2M to 6M tokens)
with alignment information. For each target lan-
guage, we also have a set of manually anno-
tated NER data (ranging from 30K to 45K tokens)

1473



Language (q, n) Training Size F1 Score

(0.7, 4) 1.3M 53.4
Korean (0, 0) 4.5M 25.0

pervised NER systems trained without data se-

which are served as the test data for evaluating the
target-language NER system.

The source (English) NER system is a linear-
chain CRF model which achieves an accuracy of
88.9 F1 score on an independent NER test set.
The alignment systems between English and the
target languages are maximum entropy models
(Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005), with an accu-
racy of 69.4/62.0/76.1/88.0 F1 score on indepen-
dent Japanese/Korean/German/Portuguese align-
ment test sets.

For each target language, we randomly select
5% of the projection-labeled data as the develop-
ment set and the remaining 95% as the training
set. We compare an NER system trained with all
the projection-labeled training data with no data
selection (i.e., (q, n) = (0, 0)) and an NER sys-
tem trained with projection-labeled data selected
by the data selection scheme where the develop-
ment set is used to select the threshold parame-
ters q and n via coordinate search. Both NER sys-
tems are 2nd-order MEMM models3 which use the
same template of features.

The results are shown in Table 2. For differ-
ent target languages, we use the same source (En-
glish) NER system for annotation projection, so
the differences in the accuracy improvements are
mainly due to the alignment quality of the com-
parable corpora between English and different tar-
get languages. When the alignment quality is low
(e.g., as for Japanese and Korean) and hence the
projection-labeled NER data are quite noisy, the
proposed data selection scheme is very effective
in selecting good-quality projection-labeled data
and the improvement is big: +12.2 F1 score for

with a few million words, since our NER system has over
50 entity types, and the training time of CRFs grows at least
quadratically in the number of entity types.

Japanese and +13.7 F1 score for Korean. Us-
ing a stratified shuffling test (Noreen, 1989), for
a significance level of 0.05, data-selection is sta-
tistically significantly better than no-selection for
Japanese, Korean and Portuguese.

4 Representation Projection Approach

In this paper, we propose a new approach for di-
rect NER model transfer based on representation
projection. Under this approach, we train a single
English NER system that uses only word embed-
dings as input representations. We create mapping
functions which can map words in any language
into English and we simply use the English NER
system to decode. In particular, by mapping all
languages into English, we are using one univer-
sal NER system and we do not need to re-train the
system when a new language is added.

4.1 Monolingual Word Embeddings

We first build vector representations of words
(word embeddings) for a language using mono-
lingual data. We use a variant of the Con-
tinuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) word2vec model
(Mikolov et al., 2013a), which concatenates the
context words surrounding a target word instead
of adding them (similarly to (Ling et al., 2015)).
Additionally, we employ weights w = 1dist(x,xc)
that decay with the distance of a context word xc
to a target word x. Tests on word similarity bench-
marks show this variant leads to small improve-
ments over the standard CBOW model.

We train 300-dimensional word embeddings for
English. Following (Mikolov et al., 2013b), we
use larger dimensional embeddings for the target
languages, namely 800. We train word2vec for
1 epoch for English/Spanish and 5 epochs for the
rest of the languages for which we have less data.

4.2 Cross-Lingual Representation Projection

We learn cross-lingual word embedding map-
pings, similarly to (Mikolov et al., 2013b). For a
target language f , we first extract a small train-
ing dictionary from a phrase table that includes
word-to-word alignments between English and the
target language f . The dictionary contains En-
glish and target-language word pairs with weights:
(xi, yi, wi)i=1,...,n, where xi is an English word,
yi is a target-language word, and the weight wi =
P̂ (xi|yi) is the relative frequency of xi given yi as
extracted from the phrase table.

1474



Suppose we have monolingual word embed-
dings for English and the target language f . Let
ui ∈ Rd1 be the vector representation for English
word xi, vi ∈ Rd2 be the vector representation for
target-language word yi. We find a linear mapping
Mf→e by solving the following weighted least
squares problem where the dictionary is used as
the training data:

Mf→e = arg min
M

n∑

i=1

wi||ui −Mvi||2 (7)

In (7) we generalize the formulation in
(Mikolov et al., 2013b) by adding frequency
weights to the word pairs, so that more frequent
pairs are of higher importance. Using Mf→e, for
any new word in f with vector representation v,
we can project it into the English vector space as
the vector Mf→ev.

The training dictionary plays a key role in find-
ing an effective cross-lingual embedding mapping.
To control the size of the dictionary, we only
include word pairs with a minimum frequency
threshold. We set the threshold to obtain approx-
imately 5K to 6K unique word pairs for a target
language, as our experiments show that larger-size
dictionaries might harm the performance of repre-
sentation projection for direct NER model transfer.

4.3 Direct NER Model Transfer
The source (English) NER system is a neural net-
work model (with architecture NN1 or NN2) that
uses only word embedding features (embeddings
of a word and its surrounding context) in the En-
glish vector space. Model transfer is achieved sim-
ply by projecting the target language word embed-
dings into the English vector space and decoding
these using the English NER system.

More specifically, given the word embeddings
of a sequence of words in a target language f ,
(v1, ...,vt), we project them into the English vec-
tor space by applying the linear mapping Mf→e:
(Mf→ev1, ...,Mf→evt). The English NER sys-
tem is then applied on the projected input to pro-
duce NER tags. Words not in the target-language
vocabulary are projected into their English embed-
dings if they are found in the English vocabulary,
or into an NER-trained UNK vector otherwise.

5 Co-Decoding

Given two weakly supervised NER systems which
are trained with different data using different mod-

els (MEMM model for annotation projection and
neural network model for representation projec-
tion), we would like to design a co-decoding
scheme that can combine the outputs (views) of
the two systems to produce an output that is more
accurate than the outputs of individual systems.

Since both systems are statistical models and
can produce confidence scores (probabilities), a
natural co-decoding scheme is to compare the con-
fidence scores of the NER tags generated by the
two systems and select the tags with higher con-
fidences scores. However, confidence scores of
two weakly supervised systems may not be di-
rectly comparable, especially when comparing O
tags with non-O tags (i.e., entity tags). We con-
sider an exclude-O confidence-based co-decoding
scheme which we find to be more effective empir-
ically. It is similar to the pure confidence-based
scheme, with the only difference that it always
prefers a non-O tag of one system to an O tag
of the other system, regardless of their confidence
scores.

In our experiments we find that the annotation
projection system tends to have a high precision
and low recall, i.e., it detects fewer entities, but
for the detected entities the accuracy is high. The
representation projection system tends to have a
more balanced precision and recall. Based on this
observation, we develop the following rank-based
co-decoding scheme that gives higher priority to
the high-precision annotation projection system:

1. The combined output includes all the entities
detected by the annotation projection system.

2. It then adds all the entities detected by the
representation projection system that do not
conflict4 with entities detected by the annota-
tion projection system (to improve recall).

Note that an entity X detected by the rep-
resentation projection system does not conflict
with the annotation projection system if the an-
notation projection system produces O tags for
the entire span of X. For example, suppose the
output tag sequence of annotation projection is
(B-PER,O,O,O,O), of representation projection is
(B-ORG,I-ORG,O,B-LOC,I-LOC), then the com-
bined output under the rank-based scheme will be
(B-PER,O,O,B-LOC,I-LOC).

4Two entities detected by two different systems conflict
with each other if either 1) the two entities have different
spans but overlap with each other; or 2) the two entities have
the same span but with different NER tags.

6 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed approaches for cross-lingual NER, in-
cluding the 2 projection-based approaches and the
2 co-decoding schemes for combining them:
(1) The annotation projection (AP) approach with
heuristic data selection;
(2) The representation projection approach (with
two neural network architectures NN1 and NN2);
(3) The exclude-O confidence-based co-decoding
scheme;
(4) The rank-based co-decoding scheme.

6.1 NER Data Sets

We have used various NER data sets for evalu-
ation. The first group includes in-house human-
annotated newswire NER data for four languages:

Japanese, Korean, German and Portuguese, anno-
tated with over 50 entity types. The main motiva-
tion of deploying such a fine-grained entity type
set is to build cognitive question answering appli-
cations on top of the NER systems. The entity type
set has been engineered to cover many of the fre-
quent entity types that are targeted by naturally-
phrased questions. The sizes of the test data sets
are ranging from 30K to 45K tokens.

The second group includes open human-
annotated newswire NER data for Spanish, Dutch
and German from the CoNLL NER data sets
(Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003). The CoNLL data have 4 en-
tity types: PER (persons), ORG (organizations),
LOC (locations) and MISC (miscellaneous enti-
ties). The sizes of the development/test data sets
are ranging from 35K to 70K tokens. The devel-
opment data are used for tuning the parameters of
learning methods.

6.2 Evaluation for In-House NER Data

In Table 3, we show the results of different ap-
proaches for the in-house NER data. For annota-
tion projection, the source (English) NER system
is a linear-chain CRF model trained with 328K to-
kens of human-annotated English newswire data.
The target-language NER systems are 2nd-order
MEMM models trained with 1.3M, 1.5M, 2.6M
and 1.5M tokens of projection-labeled data for
Japanese, Korean, German and Portuguese, re-
spectively. The projection-labeled data are se-
lected using the heuristic data selection scheme
(see Table 2). For representation projection, the
source (English) NER systems are neural network
models with architectures NN1 and NN2 (see Fig-
ure 1), both trained with 328K tokens of human-
annotated English newswire data.

The results show that the annotation projection
(AP) approach has a relatively high precision and
low recall. For representation projection, neural
network model NN2 (with a smoothing layer) is
better than NN1, and NN2 tends to have a more
balanced precision and recall. The rank-based co-
decoding scheme is more effective for combining
the two projection-based approaches. In particu-
lar, the rank-based scheme that combines AP and
NN2 achieves the highest F1 score among all the
weakly supervised approaches for Korean, Ger-
man and Portuguese (second highest F1 score for
Japanese), and it improves over the best of the two

projection-based systems by 2.2 to 7.4 F1 score.
We also provide the performance of supervised

learning where the NER system is trained with
human-annotated data in the target language (with
size shown in the bracket). While the performance
of the weakly supervised systems is not as good as
supervised learning, it is important to build weakly
supervised systems with decent performance when
supervised annotation is unavailable. Even if su-
pervised annotation is feasible, the weakly super-
vised systems can be used to pre-annotate the data,
and we observed that pre-annotation can improve
the annotation speed by 40%-60%, which greatly
reduces the annotation cost.

6.3 Evaluation for CoNLL NER Data

For the CoNLL data, the source (English) NER
system for annotation projection is a linear-
chain CRF model trained with the CoNLL En-
glish training data (203K tokens), and the target-
language NER systems are 2nd-order MEMM
models trained with 1.3M, 7.0M and 1.2M to-
kens of projection-labeled data for Spanish, Dutch
and German, respectively. The projection-labeled
data are selected using the heuristic data selection
scheme, where the threshold parameters q and n
are determined via coordinate search based on the

CoNLL development sets. Compared with no data
selection, the data selection scheme improves the
annotation projection approach by 2.7/2.0/2.7 F1
score on the Spanish/Dutch/German development
data. In addition to standard NER features such
as n-gram word features, word type features, pre-
fix and suffix features, the target-language NER
systems also use the multilingual Wikipedia en-
tity type mappings developed in (Ni and Florian,
2016) to generate dictionary features and as de-
coding constraints, which improve the annotation
projection approach by 3.0/5.4/7.9 F1 score on the
Spanish/Dutch/German development data.

For representation projection, the source (En-
glish) NER systems are neural network models
(NN1 and NN2) trained with the CoNLL En-
glish training data. Compared with the stan-
dard CBOW word2vec model, the concatenated
variant improves the representation projection ap-
proach (NN1) by 8.9/11.4/6.8 F1 score on the
Spanish/Dutch/German development data, as well
as by 2.0 F1 score on English. In addition,
the frequency-weighted cross-lingual word em-
bedding projection (7) improves the representation
projection approach (NN1) by 2.2/6.3/3.7 F1 score
on the Spanish/Dutch/German development data,
compared with using uniform weights on the same
data. We do observe, however, that using uni-
form weights when keeping only the most frequent
translation of a word instead of all word pairs
above a threshold in the training dictionary, leads
to performance similar to that of the frequency-
weighted projection.

In Table 4 we show the results for the CoNLL
development data. For representation projection,
NN1 is better than NN2. Both the annotation pro-
jection approach and NN1 tend to have a high pre-
cision. In this case, the exclude-O confidence-
based co-decoding scheme that combines AP and
NN1 achieves the highest F1 score for Spanish and
Dutch (second highest F1 score for German), and
improves over the best of the two projection-based
systems by 1.5 to 3.4 F1 score.

In Table 5 we compare our top systems (confi-
dence or rank-based co-decoding of AP and NN1,
determined by the development data) with the best
results of the cross-lingual NER approaches pro-
posed in Täckström et al. (2012), Nothman et al.
(2013) and Tsai et al. (2016) on the CoNLL test
data. Our systems outperform the previous state-
of-the-art approaches, closing more of the gap to

7 Related Work

The traditional annotation projection approaches
(Yarowsky et al., 2001; Zitouni and Florian, 2008;
Ehrmann et al., 2011) project NER tags across
language pairs using parallel corpora or transla-
tions. Wang and Manning (2014) proposed a vari-
ant of annotation projection which projects expec-
tations of tags and uses them as constraints to train
a model based on generalized expectation crite-
ria. Annotation projection has also been applied
to several other cross-lingual NLP tasks, includ-
ing word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik,
2002), part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Yarowsky
et al., 2001) and dependency parsing (Rasooli and
Collins, 2015).

Wikipedia has been exploited to generate
weakly labeled multilingual NER training data.
The basic idea is to first categorize Wikipedia
pages into entity types, either based on manually
constructed rules that utilize the category informa-
tion of Wikipedia (Richman and Schone, 2008) or
Freebase attributes (Al-Rfou et al., 2015), or via a
classifier trained with manually labeled Wikipedia
pages (Nothman et al., 2013). Heuristic rules are
then developed in these works to automatically la-
bel the Wikipedia text with NER tags. Ni and
Florian (2016) built high-accuracy, high-coverage
multilingual Wikipedia entity type mappings us-
ing weakly labeled data and applied those map-
pings as decoding constrains or dictionary features

to improve multilingual NER systems.
For direct NER model transfer, Täckström et al.

(2012) built cross-lingual word clusters using
monolingual data in source/target languages and
aligned parallel data between source and target
languages. The cross-lingual word clusters were
then used to generate universal features. Tsai
et al. (2016) applied the cross-lingual wikifier
developed in (Tsai and Roth, 2016) and mul-
tilingual Wikipedia dump to generate language-
independent labels (FreeBase types and Wikipedia
categories) for n-grams in a document, and those
labels were used as universal features.

Different ways of obtaining cross-lingual em-
beddings have been proposed in the literature. One
approach builds monolingual representations sep-
arately and then brings them to the same space
typically using a seed dictionary (Mikolov et al.,
2013b; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014). Another line of
work builds inter-lingual representations simulta-
neously, often by generating mixed language cor-
pora using the supervision at hand (aligned sen-
tences, documents, etc.) (Vulić and Moens, 2015;
Gouws et al., 2015). We opt for the first solution in
this paper because of its flexibility: we can map all
languages to English rather than requiring separate
embeddings for each language pair. Additionally
we are able to easily add a new language without
any constraints on the type of data needed. Note
that although we do not specifically create inter-
lingual representations, by training mappings to
the common language, English, we are able to map
words in different languages to a common space.
Similar approaches for cross-lingual model trans-
fer have been applied to other NLP tasks such as
document classification (Klementiev et al., 2012),
dependency parsing (Guo et al., 2015) and POS
tagging (Gouws and Søgaard, 2015).

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we developed two weakly super-
vised approaches for cross-lingual NER based on
effective annotation and representation projection.
We also designed two co-decoding schemes that
combine the two projection-based systems in an
intelligent way. Experimental results show that
the combined systems outperform three state-of-
the-art cross-lingual NER approaches, providing
a strong baseline for building cross-lingual NER
systems with no human annotation in target lan-
guages.
