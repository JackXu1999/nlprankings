Abstract

Within the context of grammar engineer-
ing, modelling honorifics has been re-
garded as one of the components for im-
proving machine translation and anaphora
resolution. Using the HPSG and MRS
framework, this paper provides a compu-
tational model of honorifics. The present
study incorporates the honorific informa-
tion into the meaning representation sys-
tem via Individual Constraints with an eye
toward semantics-based processing.

1 Introduction

Honorific forms express the speaker’s social atti-
tude to others and also indicate the social ranks of
the participants in the discourse and the intimacy.
Because honorifics are crucial for using the lan-
guage in a socially correct way, they have been
studied in computational linguistics as well as the-
ories of grammar. Particularly, using the hon-
orific information improves anaphora resolution,
and helps machine translation systems provide
more natural-seeming output sentences (Mima et
al., 1997; Siegel, 2000; Nariyama et al., 2005).

This paper provides a way of modelling hon-
orifics within the formalism of grammar-based
language processing. Building upon Head-driven
Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag,
1994, HPSG) and Minimal Recursion Semantics
(Copestake et al., 2005, MRS), the present study
suggests using Individual CONStraints (hence-
forth, ICONS) for representing honorifics from the
perspective of multilingual processing.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2
presents some background knowledge of the cur-
rent study. Section 3 proposes using Individual
Constraints for modelling the honorific system.
Building upon the specification, Section 4 shows
how honorific expressions can be translated across

different honorific types of languages. Section 5
reports a small experiment to see if the current
model contributes to semantics-based processing.

2 Background

2.1 Forms of Expressing Honorifics
A cross-linguistic survey reveals that there are
three ways of expressing honorifics (Agha, 1994;
Ide, 2005): (i) pronouns, (ii) inflection, and (iii)
suppletives. Different languages use a different
range of honorific systems, but it appears that there
exists a hierarchy in the system of honorification,
as presented in Table 1. Note that some languages
(e.g. English) use no honorific forms.

Table 1: Honorification hierarchy
no forms < pronouns <inflection< suppletives
English, ...

Chinese, German, ...
Javanese, Hindi, ...

Japanese, Korean, ...

The most widespread linguistic phenomenon re-
garding honorific expressions can be found in the
taxonomy of personal pronouns. In many lan-
guages, personal pronouns (particularly, second
pronouns) are dualized, viz. ordinary (a.k.a. in-
formal) forms and honorific (a.k.a. formal) forms.
For example, Chinese employs two second per-
sonal pronouns: 你 nı̌ and您 nı́n. Both sentences
provided in (1) convey a meaning like “What is
your name?” in English.

(1) a. 你/您
nı̌/nı́n
2.SG

叫
jiào
be.called

什么
shénme
what

名字
mı́ngzi
name

？
?
PU

b. #你/您
nı̌/nı́n
2.SG

贵
guı̀
noble

姓
xı̀ng
last.name

？
?
PU [cmn]

(1a) is a plain way to ask someone’s name, in
which both pronouns can be felicitously used. In
contrast, (1b) is a way of asking in a courteous
manner, in which the use of你 nı̌ is inappropriate.

57



That is to say, the predicate in (1b) 贵姓 guı̀xı̀ng
is a marked expression in terms of honorification.

Some languages employ a more complicated
honorific system. In Japanese, Korean, Javanese,
Hindi, and some other languages, the inflectional
paradigm is conditioned by the honorific rela-
tions between dialogue participants (Siegel, 2000;
Ohtake and Yamamoto, 2001; Kim and Sells,
2007). For instance, in Japanese and Korean, if
the subject is in the honorific form, the predicate
is preferred to be in the honorific form, as exem-
plified in (2). Note that先生 sensei ‘teacher’ is an
honorific word, and the verbal form o+STEM+ni
naru is used to signify honor to the subject.

(2) 先生
sensei
teacher

は
wa
TOP

本
hon
book

を
o
ACC

お読み
o-yomi
HON-read

になり
ni nari
become

ました
mashi-ta
HON-PST

‘The teacher read a book.’ [jpn] (Dalrymple, 2001, p.
18)

Other elements can also be marked with respect
to honorification. When non-subjects (e.g. ob-
jects and obliques) are honored, the canonical ver-
bal form in Japanese is o+STEM+suru. When the
speaker wants to express an honor to the hearer in
Japanese, a verbal ending masu is used as shown
in the last word of (2). On the other hand, the
nominal inflectional system is also influenced by
honorifics, as exemplified in (3).

(3) a. お元気
o-genki
HON-good.health

です
desu
COP

か
ka
QUES

‘How are you (honored)?’

b. 私
watashi
1.SG

は
wa
TOP

元気
genki
good.health

です
desu
COP

‘I am fine.’ [jpn]

In (3a), the addressee is presumed to be an hon-
ored person, and thereby the prefix o- canonically
co-occurs with genki ‘good.health’. In contrast,
(3b) explains the speaker’s own status, and thereby
the honorific marker o- does not appear.

Some languages, such as Korean and Japanese,
make ample use of suppletive forms of honori-
fication. For example, Japanese has three verbs
for ‘eat’: 食べる taberu (neutral), 召し上がる
meshiagaru ‘(An honoree) eats’, and頂く itadaku
‘(An honorer) eats’. These suppletive forms can
often be used with the inflectional forms men-
tioned before; for example, お-召し上がり-に
なる o-meshiagari-ni naru ‘(Someone highly re-
spected) eats’ (Nariyama et al., 2005, p. 93-94).

Therefore, a single expression can involve all three
types of honorification, as shown in (4).

(4) 책을
chayk-ul
book-ACC

드리셨습니다.
tuli-si-ess-supni-ta
give(HON)-HON-PST-HON-DECL

‘(An honoree) gave a book (to another honoree).’
(The hearer is also an honoree.) [kor]

The verb in (4) contains three honorific forms for
the object, the subject, and the addressee. The lex-
eme 드리- tuli- is a suppletive counterpart of 주-
cwu- ‘give’. This verb implies the receiver is re-
spectable. The second one is the suffix -si-, which
indicates the subject is an honoree. The third one
is the ending suffix -supni-, which indicates that
the speaker expresses a respect to the hearer.

There are also nominal suppletive forms. The
different lexical items that denote the same refer-
ent sometimes indicate the relative degree of fa-
miliarity to the referent. For example, kinship
terms in Japanese vary depending on the relation-
ship between the speaker and the referent: When
talking about the speaker’s own grandfather with
others in a modest attitude,祖父 sofu is normally
used. When either denoting the other’s grandfa-
ther or calling the speaker’s grandfather friendly
and informally, お爺さん o-jii-san is normally
used. This contrast shows that o-jii-san lexically
involves an honorific information, whereas sofu is
neutral. On the other hand, because o-jii-san can
be used to denote both the other’s grandfather and
the speaker’s own grandfather, the honorific infor-
mation has to be flexibly represented so as to cover
the two potential relations.

In addition to the forms discussed hitherto,
some particular constructions, such as passives
and interrogatives, can serve to express honorifi-
cation. However, the meaning is just pragmati-
cally conveyed in this case. Such a construction
is not a necessary condition but a sufficient con-
dition for expressing honorifics. Not all passive
sentences in Japanese necessarily involve an hon-
orific relation. In contrast, if the o+STEM+ni naru
form in Japanese is used, then the subject is pre-
sumed to be an honoree. Since the current work is
exclusively concerned with honorific forms, these
constructions are out of the scope of this paper.

2.2 Motivations

Honorifics have often been regarded as agreement
phenomena just as the subject-predicate agree-
ment in many European languages (Boeckx, 2006;

58



Kim et al., 2006). However, there is an opposing
view to this (Choe, 2004; Bobaljik and Yatsushiro,
2006; Kim and Sells, 2007). One counterexample
is provided in (5).

(5) 김선생님이
Kim-sensayng-nim-i
Kim-teacher-HON-NOM

오(시)었다
o-(si)-ess-ta
come-(HON)-PST-DECL

‘Teacher Kim came.’ [kor] (Choe, 2004, p. 546)

The subject of (5) contains an honorific form 님
nim, but the predicate optionally takes the hon-
orific marker시 -si- though the verb with the hon-
orific marker sounds more natural. Along this line,
the current study does not constrain honorification
as a way of agreement.

There are also a couple of reasons for not fol-
lowing honorification-as-agreement. These rea-
sons make it necessary to model honorifics as flex-
ibly as possible.

First, honorification is a matter of tendency
rather than restriction. Notice that tendency and
restriction are not on a par with each other in gram-
mar engineering. Corpus data provide more than a
few cases in which a mismatch of honorific forms
happens, as exemplified in (5). Grammar engi-
neering systems must work robustly for even less
frequent items if the forms appear in naturally oc-
curring texts and unless they critically violate the
principle of human language.

Second, honorification is a matter of accept-
ability rather than grammaticality. Acceptabil-
ity is primarily concerned with appropriateness,
whereas grammaticality confirms the linguistic
rules mostly provided by linguists. Thus, accept-
ability distinguishes not grammatical and ungram-
matical sentences, but felicitous and infelicitous
ones. In a similar vein, Zaenen et al. (2004) argue
that animacy is mainly relevant to acceptability:
For instance, the choice between the Saxon gene-
tive and the of -genetive in English is sensitive to
animacy, but the difference has more to do with
felicity. The same goes for honorification. The
choice of honorific forms leads to a difference in
acceptability which forms a continuous spectrum.

3 Individual Constraints on Honorifics

Minimal Recursion Semantics is the formalism
employed to compute semantic compositionality
in the present work. In addition, the current work
employs ICONS (Individual CONStraints) in or-
der to incorporate discourse-related phenomena
into semantic representation of human language

sentences. The representation method used in the
present study (i.e. MRS+ICONS) has to do with
not only semantic information incrementally gath-
ered up to the parse tree, but also other compo-
nents required to be accessed in the process of
cross-lingual processing. MRS+ICONS enables
us to model several discourse-related items within
an intrasentential system (i.e. sentence-based pro-
cessing). Notice that there exist several discourse-
related items that can be at least partially resolved
without seeing adjacent sentences. This can be
conceptualized in the format of Dependency MRS
(Copestake, 2009), as exemplified in (6).

(6) a. John
x1

likes himself.
x2 [x1 eq x2]

b. John
x1

likes him.
x2 [x1 neq x2]

Himself in (6a) equals the subject John, while him
in (6b) does not. The notation in the bracket in
each example indicates the relationship between
two individuals: equal and non-equal. That is to
say, anaphora can be partially identified within an
intrasentential domain via such a binary relation.
There are some other phenomena that require con-
textual information in theory but can be partially
resolved in practice in a way similar to (6), and
honorification is one of them.

The current work represents honorifics as a bi-
nary relation between two individual elements. A
set of honorific information is stored into a bag of
constraints, and the value is only partially speci-
fied unless there is a clue to identify the honorific
relation within the intrasentential context.

3.1 Comparision to Previous Approaches
On the one hand, MRS+ICONS makes honori-
fication (basically a pragmatic information) vis-
ible in semantic representation with an eye to-
ward semantics-based language processing. In
the previous HPSG-based studies, honorifics are
treated as a typed feature structure under CTXT
(ConTeXT). This local structure includes C-
INDICES whose components are SPEAKER and
ADDRESSEE (Siegel, 2000; Kim et al., 2006). In
the LFG-based studies, honorification is regarded
as an F-structure, given that it is one of the reliable
tests to diagnose subjecthood (Dalrymple, 2001).
Outside the scope of grammar-based deep process-
ing, several studies make use of shallow process-
ing techniques, such as POS-based pattern match-
ing rules and regular expressions, for paraphras-

59



ing honorific expressions (Ohtake and Yamamoto,
2001, among others). In sum, no previous ap-
proach represents honorifics into a (near) logical
form. In the semantics-based processing, all com-
ponents that have a part in transfer and generation
must be accessed in semantic representation.

On the other hand, the current model provides
computational flexibility for handling honorifica-
tion. Many previous studies on honorification em-
ploy a syntactic and/or semantic feature [HON
bool] (Kim et al., 2006, among others). However,
this feature is sometimes misleading for computa-
tional processing of honorifics for three reasons.
First, there exist more than a few mismatches
between honorific forms in real texts written in
Korean and Japanese (i.e. no honorification-as-
agreement (Choe, 2004)). [HON bool] is too re-
strictive to analyze rather infelicitous but accept-
able honorific expressions (§2.2). For example,
the two types of second personal pronouns in Chi-
nese are interchangeable in many cases as pro-
vided in (1a), and the use of the informal pro-
noun你 nı̌ in (1b) merely results in infelicity (not
ungrammaticality). The current work deals with
honorifics grounded upon the premise “parsing ro-
bustly, generating strictly” (Bond et al., 2008). All
potential honorific forms can be parsed robustly
and flexibly, but the generation outputs are made
strictly and felicitously. Second, [HON bool] can-
not fully reflect the fact that honorifics are some-
times ambiguous and the specific meaning can be
incrementally resolved up to the parse tree (Kim
and Sells, 2007). For example, お爺さん o-jii-
san ‘elderly man’ in Japanese can be used either
informally or formally, and the choice between
them depends on syntactic configuration. The cur-
rent work makes use of a type hierarchy to con-
strain honorifics (see Figure 1), which manipulates
the potential ambiguity and identifies the mean-
ing throughout unification of structures. Third,
the Boolean feature is too crude to place different
types of constraints on subjects, objects, and ad-
dressee. For instance, the verb of (4) (in Korean)
includes three HON glosses, and they have differ-
ent honorific relations. MRS+ICONS represents
honorifics as a binary relation amongst individu-
als, such as speaker, hearer, and referents.

3.2 Fundamentals
MRS+ICONS is structured as shown in (7). The
value type is icons whose components are IARG1
and IARG2. Since ICONS stands for a binary re-

lation between two individuals, their value type is
individual (a supertype of event and ref-ind).

On the other hand, the HOOK structure, which
keeps track of the features that need to be
externally visible upon semantic composition,
has three additional attributes, viz. ICONS-KEY,
SPEAKER-KEY, and HEARER-KEY. These fea-
tures function like a pointer in the compositional
construction of the semantic structure. They are
required to mark the constituent analyzed as the
speaker or the hearer of an utterance and deliver
the information up to the parse tree. In particu-
lar, first and second personal pronouns specify this
value as their own index (§3.4).

CTXT (under local) includes C-INDICES just
as Jacy does (Siegel, 2000), but the names are dif-
ferent as presented in the following AVM. Note
that the counterpart of “speaker” must be “hearer”,
and that of “addressee” must be “addressor”. The
value type is ref-ind, because the speaker and the
hearer are also referential individuals.

The values of SPEAKER and HEARER re-
main underspecified until an utterance is estab-
lished. The typed feature structure of utterance
is presented in (9), in which SPEAKER-KEY
and HEARER-KEY under CONT (i.e. mrs) are
co-indexed with SPEAKER and HEARER un-
der CTXT. Unless the SPEKER-KEY and the
HEARER-KEY are assigned a specific value dur-
ing the construction of the parse tree, the values
are still left underspecified. If the value is not
specified until an utterance is built up, that means
that the speaker and the hearer cannot be identified
within the intrasentential domain.

The utterance rule syntactically forms a non-
branching root node, whose daughter is either
a saturated sentence or a fragment (sat-or-frag).
This pseudo phrase structure rule introduces two
elements into the ICONS list, as shown at the
bottom of (9). They are valued as addressor
(i.e. speaker) and addressee (i.e. hearer). These
ICONS elements play the key role to make dia-
logue participants visible in semantic representa-
tion. Their IARG1s are respectively co-indexed
with SPEAKER and HEARER (i.e. 1 and 2 ),
and the IARG2 are commonly co-indexed with the
semantic head’s INDEX of the utterance (i.e. 3 ).
The main reason why they have a relation to the
semantic head is that it is necessary to resolve the
speaker/hearer scope in quotations. For example,
(10) contains two different discourse frames, viz.
inner frame and outer frame.

(10) “You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.

The two different frames may have different
speakers and different hearers. For instance, the
speaker in the inner frame of (10) is Holmes, while
that in the outer frame is the narrator of the story.
In other words, (10) includes two different utter-
ances, and each introduces its own addressee and
addressor elements into the ICONS list (i.e. four
ICONS elements, in total).

3.3 Type Hierarchy

Going into the details, the type hierarchy of icons
for honorification is sketched out in Figure 1.

icons

dialogue ... rank

addressor addressee higher-or-int lower-or-int

higher int lower

Figure 1: Type hierarchy of icons

Regarding honorification, icons includes two im-
mediate subtypes: namely, dialogue and rank. The
former branches out into addressor and addressee,
and the latter includes two levels of subtypes.
Higher-or-int indicates that one individual is so-
cially higher than the other or intimate to the other.
Recall that お爺さん o-jii-san in Japanese can
be canonically used when the referent is higher
than the speaker (formal) or intimate to the speaker
(less formal). The word itself has the [ICONS-
KEY higher-or-int] feature, which can be further
constrained by the value that the predicate assigns
to the word. Honorification is normally relevant
to which is “higher” than which, but the linguis-
tic forms can sometimes be altered when talking
to someone in the lower position. For instance,
Korean employs six levels of imperative inflec-
tions conditioned by the relationship between the
speaker and the hearer. Lower-or-int and lower
work for this case. Finally, note that int inherits
from both higher-or-int and lower-or-int.

3.4 Specifications

First, pronouns are specified with respect to the
speaker and the hearer, as shown in (11).

The first personal pronoun has a co-index be-
tween its own INDEX and SPEAKER-KEY, and
the ICONS list is empty because it does not con-
tribute to honorification by itself. Likewise, the
second personal pronouns link their INDEX to
HEARER-KEY. If the pronoun is honorific, one
ICONS element is introduced. Otherwise (e.g.你
nı̌), the ICONS list is empty. The ICONS element
of the right AVM indicates that the hearer 1 is
higher than the speaker 2 .

Second, several inflectional rules introduce an
ICONS element as exemplified in (12) for the
subject-honorific form and the addressee-honorific
form in Japanese. The left AVM’s ICONS element
represents that the subject 1 is higher than the
speaker 3 . Likewise, the right AVM’s ICONS el-
ement specifies the relation between the hearer 2
and the speaker 1 .

Third, the suppletive forms themselves do not
introduce an ICONS element, but the ICONS-
KEY is specified in order to place a partial con-
strain on polarity. This pointer value functions
similarly to [HON bool], but operates more flex-
ibly (§3.1). They are instantiated in (13). Note
thatお休み oyasumi is a suppletive counterpart of
寝る neru ‘sleep’ in Japanese.

While the neutral forms provided in (13a) are un-
derspecified, the honorific forms in (13b) place a
constraint on ICONS-KEY. Notably,お爺さん o-
jii-san ‘elderly man’ in Japanese assigns higher-
or-int to the ICNOS-KEY covering the ambiguity.

3.5 Sample Representation
The example sentence is illustrated in (14). Note
that the nominative markerが ga and the two ver-
bal ending forms are semantically empty.

(14) お爺さん
o-jiisan
HON-elderly.man

が

ga
NOM

お休み

o-yasumi
HON-sleep

になり

ni nari
become

ます

masu
HON

‘The elderly man is sleeping.’ (to an honoree) [jpn]

Therefore, only underlined elements are left in the
semantic representation as shown in (15a). In ad-
dition, there are two invisible elements as pro-
vided in (15b), such as the speaker and the hearer.
Recall that MRS+ICONS includes these invisible
referential individuals into the semantics. These
four individuals have four relations as presented
in (15c), and they are added into the ICONS list.

(15) a. ojiisan
x1

oyasumi
e2

b. speaker: x3, hearer: x4

c. [x3 addressor e2] (utterance)
[x4 addressee e2] (utterance)

[x4 higher x3] (ます masu)
[x1 higher x3] (になる ni naru)

Each relation given in (15c) is in the format
as [α X β], which is read as “α has an X rela-
tion to β”. For instance, [x1 higher x3] means
that x1 (i.e. the subject) is higher than x3 (i.e. the
speaker). The first two relations are introduced
when the utterance is built up (see (9)). The last
two relations came from the verbal ending forms
(see (12)). The MRS representation for (14) is pro-
vided in (16), in which IARG1 and IARG2 respec-
tively correspond to α and β in the [α X β] format.

The traditional representation (16) can be con-
verted into a dependency graph for ease of expo-
sition. In (17), , and - tentatively stand for the

The solid line in (17) means that the relation is
specified in the RELS list. The dotted line stands
for the ICONS element. The relational value is
labelled on the arrow, and the direction of the ar-
row indicates which individual is co-indexed with
which IARG. For instance, the arrow from ojiisan
to , means the same as [x1 higher x3] presented
in (15c) and the last ICONS element of (16).

4 Translating Honorifics

With respect to translating honorific expressions
across languages, there are different types of trans-
lation strategies. Notice that paraphrasing is re-
garded as a specific type of translation (i.e. mono-
lingual translation) in the current study, given that
it is also carried out via the same procedure con-
sisting of parsing, (transfer), and generation.

62



First, if both the source language and the target
language have a complex honorific system (e.g.
Japanese→Japanese), all ICONS elements gath-
ered in the parsing stage persist in the transfer and
generation stage. The four sentences in Japanese
provided in (18) convey a meaning like “Did
you/someone sleep?” in English, but the prefer-
ence in the choice hinges on the social relation.
The felicity condition is presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Choice of (18a-d)
higher subject plain subject

higher hearer (18a) (18b)

(18) a. お休み

The monolingual translation (i.e. paraphrasing) is
carried out as follows: First, if a suppletive form
is used (e.g. oyasumi), the corresponding form
in the generation output should be the same be-
cause the suppletive form is more informative and
specific than the neutral form. If suppletives are
converted into neutrals, loss of information hap-
pens. Notice that the suppletive forms normally
have different PRED names as shown earlier in
(15-17). For this reason, (18a-b) and (18c-d) are
not interchangeable. Second, if there is an el-
ement in the ICONS list of the input MRS, the
element persists in the output MRS in order not
to lose a piece of information. In other words, a
completely underspecified output for each ICONS
element is not allowed in generation. For in-
stance, both (18a) and (18c) use oyasumi (supple-
tive), but (18a) cannot be paraphrased into (18c)
because (18a) has one more honorific relation in
the ICONS list (i.e. ni naru). The same goes for
(18b) and (18d): Since masu in (18b) makes the
sentence more informative than (18d), (18b) can-
not be paraphrased into (18d). Third, the opposite
direction is acceptable. Even if a constituent intro-
duces no ICONS element, the output can include
an honorific constituent. For instance, (18c) can
be paraphrased into (18a), and (18d) can be para-
phrased into (18b). Translating from a less infor-

mative form to a more informative form is plausi-
ble because there is no discarded information.

Second, if the source language has rich
honorifics, and the target language places an
honorific constraint on only pronouns (e.g.
Japanese→Chinese), the ICONS elements are se-
lectively transferred: The element not linked to
pronouns are filtered out. In the opposite direc-
tion, the underspecified ICONS element in the in-
put MRS can be resolved in the output as dis-
cussed above. For instance, the subject and the
hearer in (19) is the honorific second pronoun 您
nı́n in Chinese. (19) cannot be translated into (18c-
d) in which masu does not show up (see (12)). In
contrast, all sentences given in (18) can be trans-
lated into (19) without loss of information. Recall
that the current model analyzes the neutral form as
underspecified (not [HON −]).

(19) 您
nı́n
2.SG(HON)

睡
shuı̀
sleep

了
le
PERF

吗
ma
QUES

？
?
PU [cmn]

Third, if the source language employs rich hon-
orification and the target language has no hon-
orific form (e.g. English), the transfer system turns
off ICONS. For example, (18a-d) are commonly
translated into “Did you sleep?” in English. The
other direction (e.g. English→Japanese) raises no
problem because all underspecified elements are
restored on the target language’s side.

5 Experiment

In order to verify whether the current model works
for semantics-based processing, one experiment
was conducted with ACE (http://sweaglesw.
org/linguistics/ace). The HPSG used for this
experiment is the Jacy (Siegel and Bender, 2002).
The basic analysis for honorific expressions in
Japanese discussed in this paper was implemented.
The testset was the first 4,500 sentences in the
Tanaka corpus (Tanaka, 2001). Using these re-
sources, paraphrasing in Japanese (i.e. monolin-
gual translation) was carried out with the 5-best
option for parsing and 512MB memory capac-
ity. After paraphrasing was completed, the two
results (i.e. without or with ICONS) were com-
pared, as provided in Table 3. The comparison
was made with respect to (A) the average output
numbers, (B) the number of the items with end-to-
end-success, and (C) the number of the items with
exact-match-output out of (B).

Table 3: Evaluation
(A, #) (B, %) (C, %)

plain ICONS plain ICONS plain ICONS
132.67 280.98 50.38 45.40 59.64 67.89

Table 3 presents that the current model aids in pro-
ducing more precise outputs, as indicated in (C):
The translation accuracy grows by 8.25%. The
number of outputs (A) also grows because all po-
tential forms of expressing honorifics are gener-
ated without loss of information: All ambiguous
interpretations are generated as long as the in-
formation is provided in the semantic representa-
tion. The end-to-end-success rate (B) decreases,
but it is mainly due to the memory limitation,
not the model itself: If the size of generated out-
puts exceeds the given value of memory limitation
(512MB in the current experiment), all the out-
puts are ignored in comparison. If a bigger value
is chosen, this rate also increases though it takes
much longer time to yield the outputs.
