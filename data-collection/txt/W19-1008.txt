Abstract

To model conditionals in a way that reflects their acceptability, we must include some means
of making judgements about whether antecedent and consequent are meaningfully related or not.
Enthymemes are non-logical arguments which do not hold up by themselves, but are acceptable
through their relation to a topos, an already-known general principle or pattern for reasoning. This
paper uses enthymemes and topoi as a way to model the world-knowledge behind these judgements.
In doing so, it provides a reformalisation (in TTR) of enthymemes and topoi as networks rather than
functions, and information state update rules for conditionals.

1 Introduction

The content of the antecedent and consequent of a conditional, not just their truth or falsity, makes
a difference to whether we find the conditional acceptable or not, generally rejecting those that seem
disconnected (Douven, 2008). If we are to model conditionals in a way that reflects their acceptability, we
must include some means of making those judgements. Enthymemes are non-logical arguments which
are nevertheless treated as acceptable through their relation to a topos, a general principle or pattern
for reasoning. Apart from the evidence from their own acceptability conditions, which correlate strongly
with judgements of high conditional probability, conditional structures are also associated with ‘that kind
of thinking’, being used as plain-language explanations of particular topoi (e.g. “if something is a bird,
then it flies” in Breitholtz, 2014b), or used as materials on reasoning in any number of experiments
(e.g. Pijnacker et al., 2009). If we are going to explicitly recognise the use of such ‘rule’ type objects in
discourse, then conditionals are one place where they show up, at least sometimes.

This paper has two aims. First, to propose a formalisation of enthymemes and topoi that is geared
towards relating them to more complex rule-based world knowledge, including a distinction between
knowledge about causality, non-causality, and ambiguity about causality. Second, to account for the
acceptability (or not) of conditionals by proposing an enthymeme-like structure as associated with if -
conditionals, such that topoi can enhance their content and are used in judging whether a given condi-
tional is acceptable or not. The acceptability of conditionals is linked to perceived relationships between
the antecedent and consequent cases: with enthymemes and topoi, we can incorporate this non-arbitrarily
into the dialogue state.

The rest of this section will provide some background. Section 2 is focused on enthymemes, topoi,
and specification of the alternative formalism, while Section 3 uses this in a proposal of update rules
associated with conditionals. Lastly, Section 4 provides a conclusion. This paper draws on work on
enthymemes and topoi elsewhere in Breitholtz (2014a,b) etc, and will likewise use TTR (Cooper, 2012)
for formalisation.

1.1 Enthymemes and Topoi

Enthymemes are incomplete non-logical arguments that get treated as complete ones. They are ‘incom-
plete’ in that to be accepted, they must be identified as a specific instance of a more general pattern that
is already in the agent’s resources – a topos. Topoi encode world knowledge that comes as a ‘rule of



66

thumb’, such as characteristics typical of groups, and a speaker may hold contradictory topoi as equally
valid in different scenarios, with no clash experienced unless both are used at the same time. Speakers
make enthymemetic arguments by linking what on the surface might technically be non-sequiturs, but
are easily identified as an argument using accepted principles. For example, a speaker might say “Let’s
go left here, it’s a shortcut”. This argument invokes the assumption that shorter routes are better, and
that therefore the left turn being a shortcut is a good reason to take it – but they might equally say “it’s
longer”, invoking an assumption that a longer route is preferable.

Topoi have been proposed to be a resource available to speakers, and consequently a means to address
non-monotonic reasoning (Breitholtz, 2014b), the treatment of non-logical rules as expressing neces-
sity, and contradictory claims being equally assertable, as in the route-taking example above Breitholtz
(2014a).

To these ends, they have been formalised in TTR for use in dialogue (Breitholtz and Cooper, 2011),
as functions from records to record types, as in this example (Breitholtz, 2014a):

(1) a. Topos:

λr :
⎡
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎣

x : Ind
cbird : bird(x)

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎦

([cfly : fly(r.x)])

b. Enthymeme:

λr :
⎡
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎢
⎣

x = Tweety : Ind
cbird : bird(x)

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎦

([cfly : fly(Tweety)])

Both are of type Rec → RecType, and the fields of the specified record types match, but fields of
the enthymeme have been restricted to specific values. A function to a record type does not by itself
indicate what happens once we have access to that type, such as gaining a belief that some instance of
it exists (e.g. that there really some case where the bird flies). For these functions to be useful, they are
additionally governed by a theory of action, which will license various actions that can be performed
with the type, e.g. judging that the original situation is additionally of that type, judging that there exists
some situation of the type described, or creating something of that type (Cooper, in prep).

1.2 Conditionals

The assumption that conditionals express a proposition is fundamental to most linguistic work on the
topic, both that which follows the commonly accepted restrictor theory of conditional semantics based
on the work of Lewis (1975), Kratzer (1986) and Heim (1982), and that which does not (e.g. Gillies,
2010).

As mentioned at the beginning, the acceptability of conditionals correlates strongly with their con-
ditional probability, with Stalnaker (1970) proposing that the probability of a conditional and the condi-
tional probability of the consequent on the antecedent are one and the same, in what is usually referred
to as the Equation. A subsequent proof by Lewis (1976) found that there is no single proposition based
on the antecedent and consequent such that its probability will consistently match the conditional prob-
ability. Therefore one could have a propositional theory of conditionals, or validate the Equation – but
not both.

However, conditional probability seems so important to the meaning of conditionals that in the view
of some non-linguists, (e.g. Edgington, 1995; Bennett, 2003) conditionals should properly be consid-
ered be probabilistic, directly expressing the conditional probability of the consequent on the antecedent,
P(cons∣ant). Subsequent empirical work overwhelmingly supports the intuition behind the original Equa-
tion, and shows that conditional probability does indeed tend to correlate with acceptability (e.g. Evans
et al., 2003; Oaksford and Chater, 2003). Conditional probability thus needs to be taken seriously,
whether one believes it is the core content of a conditional or not: indeed, figuring out how propositional
theories can accommodate its relationship to acceptability is an important issue (e.g. Douven and Ver-
brugge, 2013). Conditional probability is also not the only factor in acceptability: it is further moderated
by whether there appears to be a connection between antecedent and consequent (Skovgaard-Olsen et al.,
2016). To make these judgements, we need to know about the relationships between the antecedent and
consequent states.

2 Enthymemes, Topoi and Other Knowledge

Given that their presence in an agent’s resources has already been motivated, topoi are a natural way
to account for the required knowledge about some ‘dependence’ between antecedent and consequent.
Enthymemes and topoi are snippets of reasoning, rather than complex networks, but they should also
be related explicitly to other rule-like world knowledge, which includes the possibility of multiple rela-
tionships between more than two cases, and knowledge of explicitly causal relations. If we are going
to use topoi to express the kind of knowledge that also forms such networks (i.e. informative about
causality or related probabilities in more complex systems), then they should be in the same form as that
knowledge. The alternative, to keep succinct rule-like topoi apart from larger rule-based(ish) systems, is
counter-intuitive.

Bayesian networks (a combination of directed acyclic graphs and probability distributions) are a
common way to encode causal relations. They have two components, the first of which is a directed
acyclic graph, with the various variables as nodes, and directed edges describing any direct relationships.
Graphs and networks are a useful way to describe relationships, and express a more complex set of
relationships than a linear chain of functions. The graph structure is in accordance with constraints about
what direct parenthood in the graph can mean – that the parent is part of the minimal set of preceding
nodes whose value determines the probability distribution of the child.

The second component to a Bayesian Network is a set of probability functions for determining the
values of variables given the values of their parents – their conditional probabilities. Associated prob-
abilities are also a natural means of modelling learning, by adjusting the confidence in a given rule on
the basis of evidence and experience, allow us to make explicit the level of confidence in a judgement
beyond a binary. For unreliable rules, a high (but below 1) probability can be used to express that they
are likely to be correct in a given case, but not certain.

2.1 Graphical Topoi

The proposal is as follows. Topoi and enthymemes are of the same type as any other ‘relational’ knowl-
edge, by which I mean knowledge about causal and correlational relations. This knowledge can be
encoded as a graph. The direction(s) of the links between connected nodes, along with additional con-
straints, indicate either causal or non-causal relations via directed or bi-directed links respectively. The
variable at each node is a RecType, representing a situation, with the probability of a RecType being
across whether it is true or false (for type T, whether ∃a ∶ T). Topoi and enthymemes as usually discussed
are minimal examples, containing only two nodes.

Let RecTypei be a RecType associated with an index, and ProbInfo be a constraint on some probabil-
ity. The supertype of enthymemes and topoi, rather than a function Rec→RecType, is the type Network:

Let ⊑r indicate a subtype relation where subtyping is through restriction of one or more fields i.e. not
through the specification of extra fields. The first constraint cindex enforces co-indexing, that if subtypes
of a node are included in links, they all share its index. The second constraint clinks specifies that any
members of links are between (potentially restricted subtypes of) members of nodes. For ease of reading
and the sake of space, the constraints will not be repeated in further examples. In a link ⟨xi, xj⟩, the
specification of member xi may use j to indicate some r ∶ xj , and vice versa, e.g. where a is some field
in xi and b is some field in xj , specifying that a = j.b.



68

Causality, non-causal correlation and independence are interpreted on the basis of the members of
links. Where a path is a sequence of indices ⟨1, . . . , k⟩ such that for each i, i+1 there is ⟨xi, xi+1⟩ ∈ links,
the node indexed i is a predecessor of the node indexed j (shorthand: predecessor(i, j, links)) if there is
a path from i to j, given the contents of links. Where there is a bi-directional link e.g. ⟨xi, xj⟩, ⟨xj , xi⟩ ∈
links, the relationship is non-causal. Where there is an absence of any path, the relationship may be
treated as potential independence. Where there is a link in one direction only, the relationship may be
treated as potentially causal. However, neither this potential independence or causality is locked in: there
is a distinction between merely lacking information, and having information about a confirmed absence.
Certainty about independence or causality is expressed via constraints preventing the addition of any
link that would violate them. For n ∶ Network containing nodes xi and xj , independence, causality and
non-causality can be expressed in updated n′ as follows, where a. b indicates the merge of two records,
a record containing all fields from both, and a . b indicates their asymmetric merge (see Cooper and
Ginzburg (2015)), where in event of a field appearing in both records, the field from b is the one found
in the merge, effectively overwriting the field of a.

(3) Independence of i and j:
n′ = n.[cindij : ¬predecessor(i, j, links) ∧¬predecessor(j, i, links)]

(4) Direct causality from i to j:
n′ = n.[ccauseij : ⟨i, j⟩ ∈ n.links ∧ ¬predecessor(j, i, links)]

(5) Non-causality between i and j, where ⟨xi, xj⟩ ∈ n.links:
n′ = n . [links = n.links ∪⟨xj , xi⟩ : {⟨RecTypei, RecTypei⟩}]

The choice of bi-directed rather than undirected edges to express non-causality is motivated by a desire
for the difference in belief from potentially causal to non-causal to be something that changes easily (i.e.
with the addition of information, not replacement of one thing with another of a different type), and for
creation of a ‘casual’ (not a typo) middle-ground, where only one direction is of relevance and there is
no strong commitment either way.

All this is meant to allow for a more complex set of relationships than expressed in your average
topos which, as stated earlier, is a minimal case with just two nodes. The original example can now be
rewritten as follows:

The confidence rating of 0.95 has been somewhat arbitrarily set here for topoi to imply high confidence
without certainty. Enthymemes are distinguished from other arguments by the fact they don’t hold up
by themselves, but are instead accepted on the basis of identification with a topos – this doesn’t include
arguments that are accepted despite being unsupported. However, the terms enthymeme and topoi will
continue to be used here: this is partly for convenience, but also because once the context indicates
that an enthymemetic argument is being made (such as a recognisable suggestion+motivation pattern),
an unsupported ‘enthymeme’, once accepted, can be used to establish a potential new topos (Breitholtz,
2015). An Enth is defined as a Network containing a node that has at least one field restricted to a specific
object, removing its generality. A Topos is a Network in which no fields are restricted to a specific object.

An enthymeme e may be identified with a topos t if its nodes and links have equivalents in t, that is if
for every node xi ∈ e.nodes,∃yp ∈ t.nodes such that xi ⊑ yp and for any links ⟨x′i, x′j⟩ ∈ e.links,∃⟨y′p, y′q⟩ ∈
t.links such that x′i ⊑ y′p and x′j ⊑ y′q. This may be by a clear match for the topos fields, but may also
include the types of fields in the enthymeme as subtypes of fields in the topos1.

3 Conditionals and Reasoning

Having reformalised topoi and enthymemes as an object intended for more general correlational and
causal knowledge, we turn back to conditionals.

Firstly, and as mentioned at the beginning, expressing this kind of relational knowledge is (both
intuitively and according to empirical evidence) strongly associated with conditionals, and existence
of a dependence relation and high conditional probability usually determine their acceptability. Van
Rooij and Schulz (2019) suggest a way to combine these two features into a single measure, the relative
difference the state of the parent in a relation makes to the likelihood of the child. Pleasingly, with some
independence assumptions this measure works not only for the ‘causal’ direction typically expressed by
conditionals (if there’s fire, there’s smoke), but for the reverse as expressed by evidential conditionals
(if there’s smoke, there’s fire). However, for it to do so, the direction of the relationship still has to be
recognised even when the ‘usual’ roles of antecedent as parent and consequent as child have flipped.
This kind of structural knowledge is topoic.

Secondly, and while it feels almost trivial to point out, we use conditionals to tell each other new
things. When we are informed of something through the use of a conditional, we don’t necessarily know
beforehand that they lie in such a relation: otherwise they would only be useful to draw attention to
connections we haven’t made, not to tell each other things that are entirely new. Indeed, Skovgaard-
Olsen et al. (2016) found evidence that when faced with a conditional, people assume that there is a
positive connection between antecedent and consequent unless they have reason to believe otherwise. It
is not so much that an acceptable conditional has to be backed up by pre-existing knowledge about the
relation between the antecedent and consequent cases, but at the very least it should not clash with any.

Breitholtz (2014a) mentions how an enthymemetic argument can be recognised on the basis of the
current conversational game/expected rules (with the specific example of knowledge that a suggestion
may be followed by the speaker providing a motivation), or by an explicit lexical cue. With the above in
mind, I will suggest that use of an if -conditional is one such linguistic cue.

3.1 Enthymemetic Conditionals

The overall suggestion is as follows. If -conditionals are associated with the making of enthymeme-like
arguments. Note that I say “enthymeme-like arguments”, not “enthymemetic arguments”. Enthymemes
depend on identification with a previously-known topos, while conditionals can be used to teach new
relations, rather than just make statements that rely on existing knowledge to make sense. Although they
are structured like the characterisation of enthymemes and topoi above, they are not all strictly speaking
‘enthymemetic’. The content of a conditional can be checked against the topoi in the agent’s resources.
Given a match with a topos, an enhanced version can be added to the agent’s knowledge if a link is found
between the two relevant nodes. If no supporting topos is found, a more minimal version can be added
without the benefit of any extra details a topos might have provided. If there only exists a match for the
nodes in a topos that specifies there is definitely no link between them, or that there is a conflicting link,
then the conditional should be rejected. The following subsections describe dialogue state update rules
associated with conditionals.

3.2 Use of a conditional
To begin with, the type of an information state is minimally given as (8), broadly following the decisions
for the place of enthymemes and topoi in Breitholtz (2014a) etc.

The information state has two parts: the agent’s private resources, and their representation of the
shared context. The private resources include propositions2 and specific relations about which they have
beliefs, and a set of general topoi which they can use as resources. Fields for beliefs about propositions
and for private beliefs about specific enthymemes have been omitted from the above as we will not need
to reference them, although propositions themselves will appear in example (14) later. A public Topoi
field tracks which topoi have been introduced onto the dialogue gameboard. The general form for update
rules is given in (10): pre describes the preconditions for states to which the rule can be applied, and
effects the changes.

Next we will add a few useful functions on the basis of some of the content of Section 2.1: a means
to describe whether there is a successful match between an enthymeme and a topos, and a means to
reference the result of an enthymeme that has been enriched by the content of a topos.

(11) enthMatch(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Bool, true iff all of the following hold

(i) All e’s nodes are subtypes of t’s nodes:
∀xi ∈ e.nodes,∃yp ∈ t.nodes such that xi ⊑ yp,

(ii) All e’s links are subtypes of t’s links:
∀⟨x′i, x′j⟩ ∈ e.links,∃⟨y′p, y′q⟩ ∈ t.links such that x′i ⊑ y′p and x′j ⊑ y′q,

(iii) For any constraints on links in e, the same constraints hold for the equivalent links in t:
∀cindij ∈ e, ∃cindpq ∈ t or cindqp ∈ t,
xi ∈ e.nodes, yp ∈ t.nodes, xi ⊑ yp and xj ∈ e.nodes, yq ∈ t.nodes, xj ⊑ yq.
Likewise for all ccauseij ∈ e, there is an equivalent ccausepq ∈ t.

(12) enhanceEnth(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Enth, e′ such that e′ is an asymmetric merge of t and e,
where the sets in nodes, links and probs undergo asymmetric union such that for any nodes
xi ∈ e.nodes, yp ∈ t.nodes, xi ⊑ yp, the corresponding node zu ∈ e′.nodes = yp . xi.
Likewise for any subtypes x′i and y

p, x

i ⊑ y′p in members of e.links, t.links, e.probs and t.probs.

The update rules for each case are given in the subsections below. These are rules for ‘specific’
conditionals, not those expressing general rules such as if there’s fire, there’s smoke. There should be an
equivalent to each rule below for a conditional that expresses a general topos, on the basis of whether any
fields in the conditional’s content are tied to a specific object. These should lead to an update of Topoi
only, not of enths. They are not included here, and the rules below don’t include explicit constraints
for steering the update into enths only where a check for a restricted field is successful. There are three
rules given: where there is a supporting topos in the ‘default’ direction, where there is not but there is a
supporting topos in the reverse direction, and where there is neither support nor a clash.

3.2.1 Recognising a supporting topos

First are the update rules for when the agent has a topos linking the two parts of the conditional: either
in the direction with the antecedent as the parent in the link, or in the opposite direction with consequent
as parent (though only if no topos with the default direction is known). The direction of antecedent as
parent is ‘default’ in the sense that it should be preferred if distinct topoi in both directions are available,
and is the direction assumed in case neither a supporting topos nor a conflicting one is found. The update
in case of a supporting topos in the antecedent-consequent direction is given in (13):

This rule may be applied following assertion of a conditional, where an agent knows a topos t that
matches an enthymeme based on the content of the conditional, with a link from antecedent to conse-
quent. In this case, the agent may add such an enthymeme enhanced with the topos to their enths, and
add the underlying topos to the set of currently active topoi in the conversation.

Where such an option does not exist, a topos with only a link from consequent to antecedent can be
used. The enthymeme added to enths in this case will contain a link only in the ant←cons direction. In
practice, this means that any topoi supporting a link from antecedent to consequent take precedence over
topoi which only reflect a link from consequent to antecedent. Relative to (13), the update rule for this
case has constraints in its preconditions that (i) there are no topoi with a link in the ant→cons direction,
but (ii) there is a known topos that supports an enthymeme in the alternative order. This topos is used to
enhance such an enthymeme in effects.

The following is a simplified example using this second ‘alternative order’ rule for evidential condi-
tionals. For space, members of links and probs are referenced by their index in nodes bolded.

3.2.2 New information

Even without a guiding topos, conditionals allow us to express or learn information via an assumption
that there is a positive connection between antecedent and consequent – provided we do not already know
that the two are independent, or that the consequent shouldn’t follow from the antecedent.

The last rule describes this case, where the agent’s known topoi have neither evidence about a link
between the antecedent or consequent, about the definite absence of one, or about a conflicting link. In
this case, an ‘enthymeme’ with a link in the ant→cons direction may be added to enths solely on the
basis of the conditional content. No additional topos is added to the list of active topoi – the process for
generalising an acceptable enthymeme to a re-usable topos is not addressed here.

Recall that the topoi in an agent’s resources may conflict with each other, and by necessity one of
them was learned first: despite this, a conditional does not lead to formation of an acceptable enthymeme
when such a clashing topos is already present. The shorthand for presence of a clashing topos is given
in (15) as enthClash. An enthymeme clashes with a topos where the equivalent parent nodes lead to
mutually exclusive child nodes, i.e. child nodes where a true type cannot be formed from their meet.

(15) enthClash(e : Enth, t : Topos) : Bool, true iff
∃xi, yj ∈ e.nodes, pi, qj ∈ b.nodes, xi ⊑ pi
∃⟨x′i, y′j⟩ ∈ e.links, x′i ⊑ xi, y′j ⊑ yj , ∃⟨p′i, q′j⟩ ∈ t.links, p′i ⊑ pi, q′j ⊑ qj ,
and ¬T, where T = y′j . q′j

Relative to the previous two update rules, the preconditions in this rule specify that priv.Topoi has no
topos supporting an enthymeme with a link between the antecedent and consequent in either direction,
or a link which clashes with the possible conditional enthymeme, and also does not contain a topos
supporting an enthymeme with an explicit constraint enforcing independence between the two.

4 Conclusion

The acceptability of a conditional is often determined by the conditional probability of the consequent on
the antecedent, and recognition of some meaningful link between the two. However, both intuitively and
according to experimental evidence, positive acceptability judgements can still be made without fore-
knowledge of such a connection. This paper presented two proposals on the basis that the knowledge
enabling these judgements is topoic, integrating these factors into the representation of the dialogue state
and agent resources. First, a formalisation of enthymemes and topoi as graphs was presented, on the
grounds that they should be in the same form as other knowledge about causal and correlational rela-
tionships. Second, update rules for conditionals using topoi and enthymemes were presented, drawing
on topoi to recognise the presence and direction of a ‘meaningful’ connection between antecedent and
consequent, and making an assumption of one in the absence of any evidence.

There are several avenues for further work. Most work focuses on declarative conditionals, the most
common form by far. However, conditional clauses are also used to form conditionalised questions and
directives. The proposals here should be related to these forms, whether because to an extent they apply
in those cases too, or because this topoic association is exclusive to declarative conditionals. This paper
has also said nothing about more standard propositional aspects of conditionals. The proposals here
about structural knowledge associated with conditionals should be integrated with this more standard
fare.
