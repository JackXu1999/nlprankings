Abstract

Emojis are small images that are commonly
included in social media text messages. The
combination of visual and textual content in
the same message builds up a modern way
of communication, that automatic systems are
not used to deal with. In this paper we extend
recent advances in emoji prediction by putting
forward a multimodal approach that is able to
predict emojis in Instagram posts. Instagram
posts are composed of pictures together with
texts which sometimes include emojis. We
show that these emojis can be predicted by us-
ing the text, but also using the picture. Our
main finding is that incorporating the two syn-
ergistic modalities, in a combined model, im-
proves accuracy in an emoji prediction task.
This result demonstrates that these two modal-
ities (text and images) encode different infor-
mation on the use of emojis and therefore can
complement each other.

1 Introduction

In the past few years the use of emojis in social
media has increased exponentially, changing the
way we communicate. The combination of visual
and textual content poses new challenges for infor-
mation systems which need not only to deal with
the semantics of text but also that of images. Re-
cent work (Barbieri et al., 2017) has shown that
textual information can be used to predict emo-
jis associated to text. In this paper we show that
in the current context of multimodal communica-
tion where texts and images are combined in social
networks, visual information should be combined
with texts in order to obtain more accurate emoji-
prediction models.

We explore the use of emojis in the social media
platform Instagram. We put forward a multimodal
approach to predict the emojis associated to an In-

stagram post, given its picture and text1. Our task
and experimental framework are similar to (Bar-
bieri et al., 2017), however, we use different data
(Instagram instead of Twitter) and, in addition, we
rely on images to improve the selection of the most
likely emojis to associate to a post. We show that
a multimodal approach (textual and visual content
of the posts) increases the emoji prediction accu-
racy compared to the one that only uses textual in-
formation. This suggests that textual and visual
content embed different but complementary fea-
tures of the use of emojis.

In general, an effective approach to predict the
emoji to be associated to a piece of content may
help to improve natural language processing tasks
(Novak et al., 2015), such as information retrieval,
generation of emoji-enriched social media con-
tent, suggestion of emojis when writing text mes-
sages or sharing pictures online. Given that emo-
jis may also mislead humans (Miller et al., 2017),
the automated prediction of emojis may help to
achieve better language understanding. As a con-
sequence, by modeling the semantics of emojis,
we can improve highly-subjective tasks like senti-
ment analysis, emotion recognition and irony de-
tection (Felbo et al., 2017).

2 Dataset and Task

Dataset: We gathered Instagram posts published
between July 2016 and October 2016, and geo-
localized in the United States of America. We con-
sidered only posts that contained a photo together
with the related user description of at least 4 words
and exactly one emoji.

Moreover, as done by Barbieri et al. (2017),
we considered only the posts which include one
and only one of the 20 most frequent emojis (the

the user who posted the picture.

most frequent emojis are shown in Table 3). Our
dataset is composed of 299,809 posts, each con-
taining a picture, the text associated to it and only
one emoji. In the experiments we also considered
the subsets of the 10 (238,646 posts) and 5 most
frequent emojis (184,044 posts) (similarly to the
approach followed by Barbieri et al. (2017)).

Task: We extend the experimental scheme of Bar-
bieri et al. (2017), by considering also visual infor-
mation when modeling posts. We cast the emoji
prediction problem as a classification task: given
an image or a text (or both inputs in the multi-
modal scenario) we select the most likely emoji
that could be added to (thus used to label) such
contents. The task for our machine learning mod-
els is, given the visual and textual content of a
post, to predict the single emoji that appears in the
input comment.

3 Models

We present and motivate the models that we use
to predict an emoji given an Instagram post com-
posed by a picture and the associated comment.

3.1 ResNets

Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) (He et al.,
2016) are Convolutional Neural Networks which
were competitive in several image classification
tasks (Russakovsky et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2014)
and showed to be one of the best CNN architec-
tures for image recognition. ResNet is a feed-
forward CNN that exploits “residual learning”, by
bypassing two or more convolution layers (like
similar previous approaches (Sermanet and Le-
Cun, 2011)). We use an implementation of the
original ResNet where the scale and aspect ratio
augmentation are from (Szegedy et al., 2015), the
photometric distortions from (Howard, 2013) and
weight decay is applied to all weights and biases
(instead of only weights of the convolution layers).
The network we used is composed of 101 layers
(ResNet-101), initialized with pretrained parame-
ters learned on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). We
use this model as a starting point to later finetune
it on our emoji classification task. Learning rate
was set to 0.0001 and we early stopped the train-
ing when there was not improving in the validation
set.

3.2 FastText

Fastext (Joulin et al., 2017) is a linear model for
text classification. We decided to employ FastText
as it has been shown that on specific classifica-
tion tasks, it can achieve competitive results, com-
parable to complex neural classifiers (RNNs and
CNNs), while being much faster. FastText repre-
sents a valid approach when dealing with social
media content classification, where huge amounts
of data needs to be processed and new and relevant
information is continuously generated. The Fast-
Text algorithm is similar to the CBOW algorithm
(Mikolov et al., 2013), where the middle word is
replaced by the label, in our case the emoji. Given
a set of N documents, the loss that the model at-
tempts to minimize is the negative log-likelihood
over the labels (in our case, the emojis):

loss = − 1
N

n=1∑

N

en log(softmax (BAxn))

where en is the emoji included in the n-th Insta-
gram post, represented as hot vector, and used as
label. A and B are affine transformations (weight
matrices), and xn is the unit vector of the bag of
features of the n-th document (comment). The bag
of features is the average of the input words, rep-
resented as vectors with a look-up table.

3.3 B-LSTM Baseline

Barbieri et al. (2017) propose a recurrent neural
network approach for the emoji prediction task.
We use this model as baseline, to verify whether
FastText achieves comparable performance. They
used a Bidirectional LSTM with character repre-
sentation of the words (Ling et al., 2015; Balles-
teros et al., 2015) to handle orthographic variants
(or even spelling errors) of the same word that oc-
cur in social media (e.g. cooooool vs cool).

4 Experiments and Evaluation

In order to study the relation between Instagram
posts and emojis, we performed two different ex-
periments. In the first experiment (Section 4.2)
we compare the FastText model with the state of
the art on emoji classification (B-LSTM) by Bar-
bieri et al. (2017). Our second experiment (Sec-
tion 4.3) evaluates the visual (ResNet) and textual
(FastText) models on the emoji prediction task.
Moreover, we evaluate a multimodal combination
of both models respectively based on visual and

textual inputs. Finally we discuss the contribution
of each modality to the prediction task.

We use 80% of our dataset (introduced in Sec-
tion 2) for training, 10% to tune our models, and
10% for testing (selecting the sets randomly).

4.1 Feature Extraction and Classifier
To model visual features we first finetune the
ResNet (process described in Section 3.1) on the
emoji prediction task, then extract the vectors from
the input of the last fully connected layer (before
the softmax). The textual embeddings are the bag
of features shown in Section 3.2 (the xn vectors),
extracted after training the FastText model on the
emoji prediction task.

With respect to the combination of textual and
visual modalities, we adopt a middle fusion ap-
proach (Kiela and Clark, 2015): we associate to
each Instagram post a multimodal embedding ob-
tained by concatenating the unimodal representa-
tions of the same post (i.e. the visual and textual
embeddings), previously learned. Then, we feed a
classifier2 with visual (ResNet), textual (FastText),
or multimodal feature embeddings, and test the ac-
curacy of the three systems.

4.2 B-LSTM / FastText Comparison
To compare the FastText model with the word and
character based B-LSTMs presented by Barbieri
et al. (2017), we consider the same three emoji
prediction tasks they proposed: top-5, top-10 and
top-20 emojis most frequently used in their Tweet
datasets. In this comparison we used the same
Twitter datasets. As we can see in Table 1 FastText
model is competitive, and it is also able to outper-
form the character based B-LSTM in one of the
emoji prediction tasks (top-20 emojis). This result
suggests that we can employ FastText to represent
Social Media short text (such as Twitter or Instra-
gram) with reasonable accuracy.

cision (P), Recall (R), F-measure (F1). Experimental
settings: majority baseline, weighted random, visual,
textual and multimodal systems. In the last line we
report the percentage improvement of the multimodal
over the textual system.

4.3 Multimodal Emoji Prediction

We present the results of the three emoji classifica-
tion tasks, using the visual, textual and multimodal
features (see Table 2).

The emoji prediction task seems difficult by just
using the image of the Instagram post (Visual),
even if it largely outperforms the majority base-
line3 and weighted random4. We achieve better
performances when we use feature embeddings
extracted from the text. The most interesting find-
ing is that when we use a multimodal combina-
tion of visual and textual features, we get a non-
negligible improvement. This suggests that these
two modalities embed different representations of
the posts, and when used in combination they are
synergistic. It is also interesting to note that the
more emojis to predict, the higher improvement
the multimodal system provides over the text only
system (3.28% for top-5 emojis, 7.31% for top-10
emojis, and 13.42 for the top-20 emojis task).

4.4 Qualitative Analysis

In Table 3 we show the results for each class in the
top-20 emojis task.

The emoji with highest F1 using the textual fea-
tures is the most frequent one (0.62) and the
US flag (0.52). The latter seems easy to pre-
dict since it appears in specific contexts: when the
word USA/America is used (or when American
cities are referred, like #NYC).

The hardest emojis to predict by the text only
system are the two gestures (0.12) and (0.13).
The first one is often selected when the gold stan-

predicted by wrongly selecting or .

Another relevant confusion scenario related to
emoji prediction has been spotted by Barbieri
et al. (2017): relying on Twitter textual data they
showed that the emoji was hard to predict as it
was used similarly to . Instead when we con-
sider Instagram data, the emoji is easier to pre-
dict (0.23), even if it is often confused with .

When we rely on visual contents (Instagram
picture), the emojis which are easily predicted are
the ones in which the associated photos are simi-
lar. For instance, most of the pictures associated to

is correctly predicted along with pictures related
to gym and fitness. The accuracy of is also high
since most posts including this emoji are related to
fitness (and the pictures are simply either selfies at
the gym, weight lifting images, or protein food).

Employing a multimodal approach improves
performance. This means that the two modali-
ties are somehow complementary, and adding vi-
sual information helps to solve potential ambigu-
ities that arise when relying only on textual con-
tent. In Figure 1 we report the confusion matrix
of the multimodal model. The emojis are plotted
from the most frequent to the least, and we can see
that the model tends to mispredict emojis selecting
more frequent emojis (the left part of the matrix is
brighter).

4.4.1 Saliency Maps
In order to show the parts of the image most rel-
evant for each class we analyze the global aver-
age pooling (Lin et al., 2013) on the convolutional

feature maps (Zhou et al., 2016). By visually ob-
serving the image heatmaps of the set of Insta-
gram post pictures we note that in most cases it
is quite difficult to determine a clear association
between the emoji used by the user and some par-
ticular portion of the image. Detecting the correct
emoji given an image is harder than a simple ob-
ject recognition task, as the emoji choice depends
on subjective emotions of the user who posted the
image. In Figure 2 we show the first four predic-
tions of the CNN for three pictures, and where the
network focuses (in red). We can see that in the
first example the network selects the smile with
sunglasses because of the legs in the bottom of
the image, the dog emoji is selected while fo-
cusing on the dog in the image, and the smiling
emoji while focusing on the person in the back,
who is lying on a hammock. In the second exam-
ple the network selects again the due to the wa-
ter and part of the kayak, the heart emoji focus-
ing on the city landscape, and the praying emoji

focusing on the sky. The same “praying” emoji
is also selected when focusing on the luxury car
in the third example, probably because the same
emoji is used to express desire, i.e. “please, I want
this awesome car”.

It is interesting to note that images can give con-
text to textual messages like in the following In-
stagram posts: (1)“Love my new home ” (asso-
ciated to a picture of a bright garden, outside) and
(2) “I can’t believe it’s the first day of school!!!

show the four most likely predicted emojis and their

#mommy ” (associated to picture of two boys
wearing two blue shirts). In both examples the tex-
tual system predicts . While the multimodal sys-
tem correctly predicts both of them: the blue color
in the picture associated to (2) helps to change the
color of the heart, and the sunny/bright picture of
the garden in (1) helps to correctly predict .

5 Related Work

Modeling the semantics of emojis, and their ap-
plications, is a relatively novel research problem
with direct applications in any social media task.
Since emojis do not have a clear grammar, it is not
clear their role in text messages. Emojis are con-
sidered function words or even affective markers
(Na’aman et al., 2017), that can potentially affect
the overall semantics of a message (Donato and
Paggio, 2017).

Emojis can encode different meanings, and they
can be interpreted differently. Emoji interpretation
has been explored user-wise (Miller et al., 2017),
location-wise, specifically in countries (Barbieri
et al., 2016b) and cities (Barbieri et al., 2016a),
and gender-wise (Chen et al., 2017) and time-wise
(Barbieri et al., 2018).

Emoji sematics and usage have been studied
with distributional semantics, with models trained
on Twitter data (Barbieri et al., 2016c), Twitter
data together with the official unicode description
(Eisner et al., 2016), or using text from a popu-
lar keyboard app Ai et al. (2017). In the same

context, Wijeratne et al. (2017a) propose a plat-
form for exploring emoji semantics. In order to
further study emoji semantics, two datasets with
pairwise emoji similarity, with human annotations,
have been proposed: EmoTwi50 (Barbieri et al.,
2016c) and EmoSim508 (Wijeratne et al., 2017b).
Emoji similarity has been also used for proposing
efficient keyboard emoji organization (Pohl et al.,
2017). Recently, Barbieri and Camacho-Collados
(2018) show that emoji modifiers (skin tones and
gender) can affect the semantics vector represen-
tation of emojis.

Emoji play an important role in the emotional
content of a message. Several sentiment lexicons
for emojis have been proposed (Novak et al., 2015;
Kimura and Katsurai, 2017; Rodrigues et al.,
2018) and also studies in the context of emotion
and emojis have been published recently (Wood
and Ruder, 2016; Hu et al., 2017).

During the last decade several studies have
shown how sentiment analysis improves when we
jointly leverage information coming from differ-
ent modalities (e.g. text, images, audio, video)
(Morency et al., 2011; Poria et al., 2015; Tran
and Cambria, 2018). In particular, when we deal
with Social Media posts, the presence of both tex-
tual and visual content has promoted a number of
investigations on sentiment or emotions (Baecchi
et al., 2016; You et al., 2016b,a; Yu et al., 2016;
Chen et al., 2015) or emojis (Cappallo et al., 2015,
2018).

6 Conclusions

In this work we explored the use of emojis in a
multimodal context (Instagram posts). We have
shown that using a synergistic approach, thus re-
lying on both textual and visual contents of social
media posts, we can outperform state of the art
unimodal approaches (based only on textual con-
tents). As future work, we plan to extend our mod-
els by considering the prediction of more than one
emoji per Social Media post and also considering
a bigger number of labels.
