Abstract 

A large amount of medication information resides in unstructured text in electronic medical records, 
which requires advanced techniques to be properly mined. In clinical notes, medication information 
follows certain semantic patterns (e.g., medication, dosage, frequency, mode, etc.). Some medication 
descriptions contain additional word(s) between medication attributes. Therefore, it is essential to 
understand the semantic patterns as well as the patterns of the context interspersed among them (i.e., 
context patterns) to effectively extract comprehensive medication information. In this paper we 
examined both semantic and context patterns and compared those found in Mayo Clinic and i2b2 
challenge data. We found that some variations exist between the institutions but the dominant 
patterns are common. 

 

1 Introduction 

Electronic medical records (EMRs) have grown rapidly, and a large amount of clinical data is stored in free-text 
format. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which can convert unstructured text to a structured format, 
have been successfully applied in various clinical applications including patient medical status extraction [1, 2], 
sentiment analysis [3], decision support [4, 5], genome-wide association studies [6, 7], and diagnosis code 
assignment [8, 9].  

Over the past decade, multiple clinical NLP systems have been developed and applied in the clinical domain, 
such as cTAKES [10], YTEX [11], MTERMS [12], HiTEXT [13], MedLEE [14]. Although clinical NLP systems 
have proven to be successful in many information extraction tasks, their performance often varies across 
institutions and sources of data [15, 16]. As some researchers have demonstrated, this may be due to the fact that 
clinical language is not homogeneous but instead consists of heterogeneous sublanguage characteristics [17-21].  

Medication information is one of the major data components in EMRs. Patient medication history is of great 
concern for future medical treatments and plays a vital role in enabling the secondary use of EMRs for clinical and 
translational research. Although some medication information can be extracted from the structured data, a 
substantial amount of it resides in an EMR’s unstructured text and requires advanced techniques, such as NLP, to 
extract. Since the medication information is described in various ways in the clinical notes, understanding the 
semantic patterns—i.e., description patterns of a medication name and attributes—and context patterns—i.e., 
context variations between the semantic patterns—is essential to effectively extract comprehensive medication 
information and develop a general and customizable medication extraction tool.  

In this paper, we investigated both the semantic and context patterns of medication descriptions in clinical notes 
from two different sources: Mayo Clinic and the 2009 i2b2 medication extraction challenge [22]. We provide 
various pattern statistics and compare them at both the section level and the institution level to better understand 
the usage of semantic and context variations. 

 

2 Background 

Early research on medication extraction focused on extracting the medication name itself [23, 24] and mapping 
it to a standardized nomenclature [25]. The 2009 i2b2 medication extraction challenge focused on extracting 
comprehensive medication information (i.e., medication name as well as the attributes such as dosage, mode, 



frequency, duration, and reason) from clinical discharge summaries [22]. In this challenge, most top-performing 
teams used rule-based systems developed based on the examination of medication description patterns [22]. 
Because many of these systems performed well on most attributes, we may assume that medication information in 
clinical notes follows some patterns.  

Some studies show that sublanguage-based clinical text processing systems, such as MedLEE [14], perform as 
accurately as medical experts on clinical concept extractions [13]. A sublanguage theory hypothesizes that the 
information content and structure from specific domains can be defined using a sublanguage grammar that 
specifies both domain-specific syntactic and semantic information [19, 26]. Aligned with sublanguage grammars, 
Xu et al. [27] performed a preliminary study on parsing medication sentences by assigning the probability to 
semantic-based grammar rules for medication detection. Their study showed promising results to disambiguate the 
complex sublanguage grammars of medication sentences. 

Patterson and Hurdle [28] experimentally demonstrated that different clinical domains use their own 
sublanguages in clinical narratives. They conducted clinical document clustering in 17 different clinical domains 
and showed that note types in a broad clinical scope form the same cluster, but note types in a narrow clinical 
extent form different clusters. This study suggests that the performance of a clinical NLP system may depend on 
the source of the clinical notes and that the semantic and context information of the target notes should be seriously 
considered in the tool development process.  

Previous studies support the idea that medication descriptions also exhibit sublanguage characteristics, and 
therefore an understanding of those characteristics in clinical notes within and across institutions is fundamental to 
properly extract medication information.  

 

3 Materials and Methods 

This study used annotated medication corpora from two sources: Mayo Clinic and the 2009 i2b2 medication 
extraction challenge data. The Mayo medication data consist of 159 clinical notes randomly selected from clinical 
notes. There are 659 manually annotated medication mentions with attributes. For i2b2 medication data, 253 
discharge summaries from Partners Healthcare were manually annotated by challenge teams and released to the 
community for research [29]. In the combined corpora there are 9,003 medication mentions along with attributes. 
The semantic types of medication mentions and their abbreviations for both data sets are described in Table 1 (i2b2 
annotations are excerpted from [29]). 

We investigated both semantic and context patterns of medication descriptions in various aspects. The Mayo 
clinical notes consist of multiple sections explicitly separated by section tags. The i2b2 medication annotations 
include format information where the medication information is described—i.e., list vs. narrative. We included 
pattern variations within an individual section as well as a list vs. narrative format. 

A. Semantic pattern parsing 

The medication description in clinical notes consists of a medication name and its attributes such as dosage, 
frequency, mode, etc. We refer to a sequence of such semantics tags (ignoring other text between them) as the 
medication semantic pattern. For example, 

 
                     Aspirin was reduced to 1 tablet po twice daily.  

               Mayo:     m                              do   fm   mo  fn      fu    
                         semantic pattern: m|do|fm|mo|fn|fu 
                     Aspirin was reduced to 1 tablet po twice daily. 

                i2b2:       m                                  do     mo        f            
                               semantic pattern: m|do|mo|f 

 
We investigated these patterns in each data set and also compared them across the data sets (Mayo vs. i2b2). 

Since the two corpora have different annotation guidelines, we mapped semantically equivalent Mayo annotations 
to i2b2 annotations in the following way (Mayo → i2b2): mo → mo; sn, su, do → do; fn, fu →f; fm → N/A. In 
order to simplify the expression of semantic patterns we assigned a short symbol to dominant patterns. Table 2 
contains those pairs and actual text examples.

B. Context pattern discovery 

We use the phrase medication context pattern to refer to the semantic pattern plus the text that occurs between 
the semantic tags. Any text that occurs before the first semantic tag or after the last semantic tag is excluded. For 
example,  

 
“The patient said that Aspirin was reduced to 1 tablet po twice daily then stopped it” 
Context pattern:  
   <m> was reduced to <do><mo><f> (i2b2)  
   <m> was reduced to <do><fm><mo><fn><fu> (Mayo)  

C. Large corpus analysis (Mayo) 

Mayo 159 clinical notes have a relatively lower number of medication descriptions (659 in Mayo vs. 9,003 in 
i2b2) and therefore it might cause sampling bias. To alleviate this issue we also examined 10,000 Mayo Clinic 
notes randomly selected from the Mayo patient cohort in the eMERGE study [30]. They were processed by the 
drug NER annotator in cTAKES [10] and their semantic patterns were parsed for comparison with i2b2. Drug NER 
uses rule-based pattern match implemented by finite state machine to parse medication and its attributes. These 
semantic patterns were not manually reviewed.  

 

4 Results 

A.Medication Semantic Patterns 

1) Mayo data 

In the Mayo corpus, there are a total of 89 unique semantic patterns, but 85% of the medication mentions occur 
in the 20 most frequent patterns; 70% of the medication mentions occur in the 5 most frequent patterns: m (322 
mentions), m|sn|su|fu (85), m|fu (19), m|sn|su|fn (17), m|sn|su|fn|fu (16). Medication alone is the most dominant 
pattern, comprising almost half of all the medication mentions. 

The Mayo clinical notes consist of multiple sections, and each section contains specific content. To further 
examine the content-based medication description, we analyzed each section separately and obtained section-
specific semantic patterns. These results appear in Table 3.

The other sections 14 1 m (14) 

              †number within ( ) denotes # medications of a given pattern. 

There are 14 sections that contain medications. Almost 90% of the medications appear in the four most 
dominant sections: Impression/Report/Plan, Current Medications, History of Present Illness, and Allergies. If we 
consider only patterns that occur five times or more throughout all sections, the Current Medication section is the 
most diverse with nine patterns. With the exception of the three most dominant sections, the other sections contain 
only one semantic pattern—m (medication)—that occurs five times or more. This pattern comprises all 39 
mentions in the Allergies section. 



2) i2b2 data 

A similar dominance of a few patterns exists in the i2b2 corpus. Figure 1 shows the medication semantic 
patterns and their counts that cover 95% of the medication mentions in the 253 discharge summaries. A cumulative 
percentage denotes what portion of the counts from the total medication mentions appears in the given series of 
patterns up until that point. The semantic pattern in the figure is described as a short symbol with the actual 
semantic pattern in parentheses. There are a total of 69 unique semantic patterns, but 95% of the medication 
mentions occur in the 13 most frequent patterns.  

 

3) Mayo vs. i2b2 

In order to properly compare Mayo semantic patterns with i2b2 semantic patterns, the Mayo medication 
semantic tags were mapped to i2b2 tags. The distribution of these semantic patterns is presented in Figure 2. After 
mapping, 85% of the medication mentions occur in four dominant patterns (m, m|do|f, m|do, m|do|mo|f), and 95% 
of them occur in 11 patterns.  

Each i2b2 annotation also contains format information, indicating whether the mention occurred in a list or 
narrative context. Our observations of Mayo data show that the Current Medication and Allergies sections have a 
list format for the medication description, while the other sections have a narrative format. To compare the pattern 
variations in different formats, we characterized Mayo’s Current Medication and Allergies sections as list and the 
others as narrative. As before, Mayo’s semantic tag set was mapped to that of i2b2. The comparisons for list and 
narrative formats are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. The y-axis denotes the percentage of 
medication mentions out of the total medication mentions for a given pattern. We show the top 95% most frequent 
medication semantic patterns.  

In list-formatted sections, Mayo data have five semantic patterns that cover 95% of the medication mentions 
while i2b2 data have nine (Figure 3). There are five semantic patterns that appear in both Mayo and i2b2. The most 
frequent pattern in the Mayo data is “m” while it is “m|do|mo|f” in the i2b2 data.  

In the narrative sections, Mayo data have 13 semantic patterns that cover 95% of the medication mentions while 
i2b2 data have 15 (Figure 4). There are 10 common semantic patterns that appear in both the Mayo and i2b2 data.  

To see the distribution of both Mayo and i2b2 semantic patterns in a larger data set, we also examined a large 
corpus of Mayo data. Ten thousand Mayo clinical notes were processed by the cTAKES drug NER module to 
annotate medication information, and we refer to the results as the Mayo 10K corpus. Note that these are system-
generated results and were not manually reviewed by human experts.

Figure 5 shows the i2b2, Mayo, and Mayo 10K medication semantic patterns and also includes trends of those 

patterns (moving average with period two). The Mayo medication annotations were also mapped to the i2b2 
annotations. In the top 95%, out of 15 semantic patterns, nine patterns appear in both Mayo and i2b2, four patterns 
appear only in i2b2 (m|mo, m|du, m|do|mo, du|m), and two patterns appear only in Mayo (f|m, m|mo|f). All data 
sets have the pattern of the medication name appearing alone as the most frequent pattern, but the second most 
frequent pattern in Mayo is “m|do|f.” In both Mayo 10K and i2b2, it is “m|do|mo|f,” and this shows the notable 
difference in trends. In Mayo 10K, there is a total of 311,004 medication mentions, and 95% of all the medication 
mentions appears in nine sections. After mapping the Mayo annotations to i2b2, 95% of all the medication 
mentions occur in eight semantic patterns. Intriguingly, the Mayo 10K’s three most dominant patterns (m, 
m|do|mo|f, m|do|f) exactly match with the three most dominant patterns of i2b2—they cover 80% and 77% of total 
medication mentions in Mayo 10K and i2b2 respectively. Comparing the trend to Mayo 159 notes, this larger 
Mayo corpus looks more similar to i2b2 semantic patterns.

I2B2

Mayo



We also compared the semantic patterns in list vs. narrative for both data sets. In the list sections, Mayo’s top 
three patterns (m|do|mo|f, m, m|do|f) also exactly matched the top three of i2b2, and covered 75% and 82% of the 
medication mentions in Mayo and i2b2, respectively. In the narrative sections, Mayo had only five patterns that 
covered 95% of the medication mentions, and all five patterns appeared in i2b2. Mayo’s top two (m, m|do|f), which 
covered 84% of the medication mentions, matched i2b2’s top two patterns. 

 

B. Medication Context Patterns  

Medications in clinical notes are sometimes mentioned with additional words inserted between medication 
attributes. Those words may provide clues to medication semantics, so we examined this text. 

1) Mayo data 

The Mayo data have a total of 659 medication mentions. Out of those, only 93 cases (14%) have one or more 
words between medication semantic attributes. Of those 93 cases, 82 are unique.
Since the individual words between the medication attributes are so varied, we did not notice a high frequency of 
exact context patterns. Therefore, we examined the semantic characteristics of the dominant partial context 
patterns. Table 4 shows statistics of dominant partial context patterns. When the medications are followed by verb 
forms, often the verbs are related to medication status changes—i.e., change of medication attributes. For example, 
<m> was increased to <sn>. The other minor patterns not in Table 4 are: <m> another medication <fu>|<fn>, x 
<du>|<do>, <m> at <do>, <m> from <sn>, <m> be given <fu>, <m> were|used for <fm>.

2) i2b2 data 

Since i2b2 medication annotations are more coarse-grained than Mayo, we were able to find a high frequency of 
exact context patterns. In i2b2, there are a total of 9,003 medication mentions, and only 390 of those (4%) contain 
word(s) between medication attributes. Out of those 390 cases, 231 are unique context patterns. Table 5 shows the 
major exact and partial context patterns. Approximately one third of the total exact patterns belong to the exact 
patterns in Table 5. Similar to the Mayo data, when the medications are followed by verb forms, many are related 
to medication status changes. For example, <m> was started…<du>, <m> was increased to <do>, <m> was 
reduced to <do>. Another medication mention also appears between medication semantics, for example, <m> and 
Lipitor <du>. The other minor patterns include <m> on <do>, <mo> with <m>.

5 Discussion 

Medication information was expressed in numerous ways in the clinical notes. We have investigated the 
medication description patterns in manually annotated data from 159 Mayo clinical notes and 253 i2b2 discharge 
summaries. Additionally, we have further compared these with a large medication corpus compiled by cTAKES 
drug NER from Mayo’s 10,000 clinical notes. 

Notes from Mayo and i2b2 share most of the common semantic patterns, but differences exist. Overall, the 
medication name alone is the most dominant pattern in both data sets. In Mayo, about 90% of the medication 
mentions occur in four sections, and all but the Allergies section contain a variety of semantic patterns. The 
Allergies and the other sections mostly contain the medication name alone.  

In lists, i2b2 has “m|do|mo|f” as the most frequent pattern, but in Mayo data it is the medication name. This 
might be because Mayo’s samples of 159 notes contain a relatively lower portion of Current Medication sections, 
which in fact, contain most of the medication information, as well as the most common list-format section. After 
mapping the Mayo annotations to the i2b2 annotations, the most frequent pattern in the Current Medication section 
is “m|do|f.” Based on these observations, we could conclude that the list-format medication descriptions tend to 
provide at least the minimum information necessary to guide the proper medication intake (i.e., medication with 
dosage, frequency and possibly mode information).  

In narratives, the pattern of the medication name alone is the most frequent in both data sets. Generally, 
narratives in clinical notes describe the physician’s impression, report, and plan, as well as the patient’s medical 
history, diagnosis, etc. In content of this nature, we may assume that physicians often simply mention medication 
names without further detailed attributes in clinical narratives as they are describing other conditions. The second 
dominant pattern in both data sets is “m|do|f”—21% and 5% out of the total medication mentions in Mayo and 
i2b2 respectively. In both data sets, the rest of the patterns cover a lower number of the medication mentions.  

After mapping the Mayo annotations to i2b2, it can be seen that 12% (N=11) of the semantic patterns cover 
95% of the medication mentions. In i2b2, 19% (N=13) of the semantic patterns cover 95% of the medication 
mentions. The i2b2 medication mentions are slightly more diverse than Mayo’s. Covering 95% of the entire 
medication mentions from both data sets are total 15 semantic patterns, nine of which are common in both.  

In both Mayo’s 159 notes and i2b2, the medication descriptions do not contain many words between the 
medication attributes—14% and 4% of medication mentions contain some words between them in Mayo and i2b2, 
respectively. One reason for the higher context pattern for the Mayo data is due to different annotations. For 
example, if we look at duration, Mayo does not contain prepositions (e.g., for a week → duration is “a week”) but 
i2b2 does (duration is “for a week”). Some prepositions like “of” are commonly used in combination with 
medication and dosage/duration (e.g. dosage or duration of medication). When a medication is followed by a verb, 
it can be related to a medication status change in many cases. Such medication status change descriptions often 
follow a pattern like: medication + status change verb + dosage or frequency.    

When we examined a large Mayo corpus of 10,000 clinical notes, those semantic patterns were even closer to 
i2b2. Although there is more similarity between the two, Mayo 10,000 clinical notes have not been reviewed 
manually and therefore this might make the results slightly less reliable. The trends of i2b2 and Mayo 10K in 
Figure 5 seem to be very similar. The top three semantic patterns, which cover the majority of the medication 
mentions, are exactly matched with i2b2’s. The portion of the list of medication descriptions is also closer to i2b2 
than Mayo 159 notes. In Mayo 10K, 49% of the medication mentions belong to the list format (34% in Mayo 159 
note); in i2b2, 56% belong to the list format. These observations imply that a medication extraction tool based on 
the semantic patterns in Mayo data may work reasonably well for i2b2 and vice versa.  

In our semantic pattern analysis, we considered only one medication mention at a time. For example, “Aspirin 
or Tylenol 1 tablet prn” generates two instances of the semantic pattern “m|do|f” instead of “m|m|do|f”. In the 
future, we will further compile and analyze these kinds of patterns.  

As shown in this study, the sublanguage of medication description in general can be well-characterized through 
semantic patterns. A medication extraction tool can utilize sublanguagei.e., instantiating a given medication 
template with a given medication and the corresponding attributes. The statistics of medication patterns obtained in 
this study can be used as a confidence measure to determine whether a given medication and nearby attributes are 
truly associated or not. If its description pattern belongs to one of the majority patterns, we have high confidence in 
considering it as a correct association.  

 



6 Conclusion 

The semantic patterns that are used to describe medications vary in clinical notes as a whole, and some 
variations also exist between institutions. However, dominant patterns do exist that account for most of the 
medication descriptions, and most of those patterns are common between Mayo and i2b2. Extra context between 
the medication attributes is not common in the medication descriptions, but it does occur in some particular 
patterns primarily associated with medication, including the dosage or duration “of” medication and a medication 
followed by a status change verb. Those semantic and context patterns could be utilized to properly parse 
medication and its attributes, as well as to correctly associate them.
