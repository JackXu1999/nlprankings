Abstract

In this paper we report on an ongoing multi-
institution effort to encode inferential patterns
associated with adjective modification in En-
glish. We focus here on a subset of in-
tensional adjectives typically referred to as
“non-subsective” predicates. This class in-
cludes adjectives such as alleged, supposed,
so-called, and related modally subordinating
predicates. We discuss the initial results
of corpus-based investigations to discriminate
the patterns of inference associated with these
adjectives. Based on these studies, we have
created an initial annotation specification that
we are using to create a corpus of adjective-
related inferences in English.

1 Introduction

One of the primary goals for linguistic annotation
projects is the explicit representation of the syntac-
tic and semantic information necessary for the cre-
ation of useful and meaningful inferential structures.
In this brief note, we report on a multi-institution
effort underway to identify and model the inferen-
tial patterns associated with three diverse classes of
adjectives in English. This research combines the
efforts of Princeton Univeristy (C. Fellbaum), Stan-
ford University (A. Zaenen and L. Karttunen), and
Brandeis University (the present author).

Adjectives can be divided into different classes,
depending on what dimensions of analysis are being
used. Classic semantic field analysis (cf. (Dixon,
1991; Lyons, 1977; Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995))
categorizes the attributes denoted by adjectives ac-
cording to a thematic organization, centered around

a human frame-of-reference, as lexically encoded in
the language, such the following classes:1 DIMEN-
SION, PHYSICAL PROPERTY, COLOR, EMOTIONS,
TEMPORAL SPATIAL VALUE, MANNER.

As intuitive as these classes might be for organiz-
ing aspects of the lexis of a language, they fail to
provide a coherent guide to the inferential patterns
associated with adjectival modification. An alterna-
tive approach is to adopt a conceptually conservative
but more formally descriptive and operational dis-
tinction, one which groups adjectives into inferential
classes. (Amoia and Gardent, 2006) and (Amoia et
al., 2008), following (Kamp, 1975) and (Kamp and
Partee, 1995), make just such a move, adopting a
four class distinction based on inferential properties
of the adjective, as illustrated below:

(1) In the construction, [A N], A can be classed as:
a. INTERSECTIVE: the object described is both
A and N.
b. SUBSECTIVE: the object described is A rel-
ative to the set of N, but not independent of N.
c. PRIVATIVE: the object described is not an
N, by virtue of A.
d. NON-SUBSECTIVE: there is epistemic un-
certainty whether the object is N.

These constructions constitute patterns that license
specific inferences associated with classes of adjec-
tives, and can be exploited in the context of text-
based inference systems, such as the RTE (Amoia
and Gardent, 2006). This classification, however, is
both too broadly defined to model the finer inferen-
tial distinctions within each class, and too narrow

1It should be noted that (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995) , how-
ever, also discuss inferential patterns for distinct classes.

to include the behavior of other adjective classes, in
particular, those taking clausal complements. For
these reasons, we have chosen to study three dif-
ferent classes of adjectives that require refinements
and additions to the inference patterns given above.
These classes are:

(2) a. Scalar adjectives: both dimensional (big,
small) and evaluative (happy, pretty)
scalars have been categorized as subsective
adjectives;

b. Adjectives with clausal complements: ad-
jectives such as annoying and nice, when
governing clausal complements, do not fit
nicely into any of the above classes;

c. Intensional adjectives: adjectives such as
alleged and supposed are non-subsective,
but in complex ways that are dependent on
the semantics of the nominal head.

Concerning the third adjective class, the intensional
adjectives, the effect of modifying the nominal head
is the introduction of epistemic uncertainty regard-
ing the description.

(3) T : The police arrested the alleged criminal.
H: A criminal was arrested.

Hence, this inference would be false. Now consider
the pair below:

(4) T : Archeologists discovered an alleged pale-
olithic stone tool.

H: A stone tool was discovered.
This inference is legitimate because the epistemic
scope of the adjective alleged is the adjective pa-
leolithic, and not the nominal head itself. In the
next section, we look at the behavior of the non-
subsective intensional adjectives in more detail, and
see that there is a more nuanced, but still systematic,
pattern at work.

2 Intensional Adjective Behavior

Recall that intersective adjectives such as carniver-
ous have the following behavior:

(5) ‖A N ‖ = ‖A‖ ∩ ‖N‖
Subsective adjectives, on the other hand, such as big,
can be modeled as follows:

(6) ‖A N‖ ⊆ ‖N‖

The intensional adjectives can be split into privatives
and non-subsective. Privatives, such as fake or pre-
tend, can be analyzed as follows:

(7) ‖A N‖ ∩ ‖N‖ = ∅
Intensional non-subsective adjectives introduce an
epistemic uncertainty for the elements within their
scope. Examples of this class include alleged, sup-
posed, and presumed, and they call into question
some predicative property of the nouns they modify.
Following (Kamp and Partee, 1995), no informative
inference is associated with this construction:

(8) a. [A N ] (alleged criminal)
b. 2 N

However, contrary to what is claimed in (Amoia and
Gardent, 2006), non-subsective adjectives do appear
to license specific inferences when examined in a
broader context than the [A N] construction usu-
ally studied. From preliminary corpus studies of this
class2, several distinct patterns of inference emerge.
While the typical resulting composition entails un-
certainty of whether the nominal head belongs to
the mentioned sortal, (9a) below, there are many
contexts where the epistemic scope is reduced to a
modification or additional attribution of the nominal
head, as shown in (9b).

(9) a. The alleged criminal fled the country.
b. Archeologists discovered an alleged pale-

olithic tool.
In Example (9a), the adjective alleged calls into
question the predicative property of ‘criminality’ of
the criminal. When a predicative property is called
into question by adjectives of this class, are there any
systematic inferences to be made about the seman-
tic field? E.g., is the semantic field still guaranteed
to be some hypernym of criminal? Even if the in-
dividual does not belong to the set of “criminals”, it
does still seem to belong to the set of “persons”. In
example (9b), contrastively, at least under one inter-
pretation, it is whether the tool is paleolithic or not
that is called into question: i.e., the object belongs to
the set of “tools” regardless if it is truly paleolithic
or not.3 This inference is schematically represented
below.

2The initial corpus has been collected from directed CQL
queries over two Sketch Engine corpora, Ententen12 and BNC.
Three sentence “snippets” have been compiled from this source.

3One reviewer has correctly pointed out that this inference
still appears too weak to capture the intended interpretation.

(10) Given the construction [Aint N ], where Aint
is alleged, ..., then:
a. [Aint N ] 2 N
b. [Aint A2 N ] 2 A2
c. [Aint A2 N ] � N

Such an inference pattern is subject to contextual
variables, many of which are not available to sen-
tential compositional mechanisms, but some con-
straints can be identified. For example, the closer
the head noun is to a sortal base level category, such
as bird, table, or tool, the more likely the inference
in (10b) will go through. Consider the examples be-
low:

(11) a. The store bought an alleged antique vase.
b. The researcher found an alleged Mozart
sonata.

These cases make it clear that the epistemic un-
certainty in (11) involves an additional aspect of
the NP, beyond the unassailable characteristics of
the entailed head. That is, the object is clearly a
vase (in (11a)) and demonstrably a sonata (in (10b)).
Such evidence, however, will not always be avail-
able within the composition of a sentence, but will
be derivable from context (if at all). We will refer
to the canonical inference in (10a) as the “Wide-
scope reading”, and the inferences in (10b-c) as the
“Narrow-scope reading”.

Another interesting distinction emerging in the
basic [A N] construction with intensional adjectives
is one based on the type of the nominal head. The
most common semantic types occuring in the cor-
pus are shown below, along with apparent scoping
behavior.

(12) a. EVENT NOMINAL: violation, misconduct,
murder, assault. The more specific nominal
descriptions carry greater inferential force for
the hypernym. That is, murder suggests infer-
ence of a death.
b. AGENTIVE NOUN: collaborator, perpetra-
tor, murderer, criminal. Epistemic scope is
over the entire sortal. The canonical form, “the
alleged criminal”.

Certainly more is intended than a mere hypernymic assertion,
including the associated presuppositions of the context variables
introducing the allegation and the epistemic uncertainty itself.
These are issues presently being explored.

c. UNDERGOER NOUN: victim. While not al-
ways the case, the scope is narrowed to a modi-
fication of the event: For example, “the alleged
victims of Whitey Bulger”.

Consider the sentences in (13), where alleged is
modifying an event nominal.
(13) a. He denies the alleged assault on the police.

b. The greatest number of alleged violations
occurred in California.
c. He’s been charged in connection with the al-
leged murder of John Smith, whose mutilated
body ...

The inferences associated with (13a-b) follow from
the template in (10a). For sentence (13c), however,
we need to infer that there was, in fact, a killing, al-
though it is uncertain whether it was a murder. This
requires the inference rule below, where the hyper-
nym of the event nominal is infererable from the
context.
(14) Given the construction [Aint N ], where N is

an event nominal, with certain feature, then:
a. [Aint N ] 2 N
� N ′ where N ⊆ N ′

We refer to this inference rule as the “Hypernym
reading”. Similar remarks hold for undergoer nom-
inals in some contexts, where the scope of the in-
tensional adjective can be lowered to a modification
of the event description. This is illustrated below, in
(15b).
(15) a. Testimony will be heard from the alleged

victim in court.
b. The families of two alleged victims of James
”Whitey” Bulger have received compensation.

Sentence (15a) behaves according to the canonical
template, while (15b) involves a narrower scope of
the epistemic uncertainty. That is, the inference
should be made that there are victims, but the cause
(or etiology) of this designation is uncertain. This
rule is formally related to that presented above in
(10), where the modification (argument specifica-
tion, in fact) is postnominal.
(16) Given the construction [Aint N XPmod],

where XPmod is a modification or argument,
then:
a. [Aint N XPmod] 2 N XPmod
c. [Aint N XPmod] � N

87



Summarizing the semantic behavior for this class,
we have identified at least three distinct structure-
to-inference mappings associated with intensional
(non-subsective) adjectives. These are:
(17) Structure-to-Inference Mappings:

a. Wide-scope reading:
[Aint N ] 2 N
b. Narrow-scope reading 1:
[Aint A2 N ] 2 A2, � N
c. Narrow-scope reading 2:
[Aint N XPmod] � N
d. Hypernym reading:
[Aint N ] � N ′ where N ⊆ N ′

3 Data Collection and Discussion

There are approximately 50 intensional (sub-
selective) adjectives that we have identified, from
which we have selected the most frequent 30 for our
investigation. Fewer than 10 of these are root adjec-
tives (superficial, putative), and most are particip-
ial adjectival derivations, such as alleged, supposed,
and believed. For each adjective, we have extracted
100 snippets from the corpus, where snippets are
three-sentence fragments from the text. This gives
us a corpus of 3,000 snippets for intensional adjec-
tives.

We are developing an initial classification of
1,000 of these adjectives based on the inferential
patterns discussed in the previous section; i.e., wide-
scope, narrow-scope, and hypernym readings. These
are the initial structure-to-inference templates which
will constitute the small gold standard. This annota-
tion is being performed by undergraduate linguistics
majors, with three annotations per snippet. That is,
we construct the examples that fit the identified test
patterns, as shown in (18) and (19) below. In these
examples, the inference in (18) is legitimate, while
that in (19) is false.

(18) Hypernym Reading:
(T): A teenage girl has been arrested over the
alleged murder of a mourner at a funeral in
London.
(H): A mourner died.

(19) Wide-Scope Reading:
(T): She was then tried and executed in 1952
by Stalin as an alleged spy.
(H): She was a spy.

We then will submit these stimuli to MTurkers with
the same guidelines as those given to the linguists,
and examine the differences in judgments. That
is, for those cases that do not accord with the pre-
assigned classification, we try to isolate the factors
contributing to when the judgment goes against the
expected inference. To this end, we perform a sta-
tistical analysis of the contexts of the adjective for
both the cases that are in accordance with the classi-
fication and the cases that are not.

The goal of this ongoing effort is to elucidate the
semantic properties and inferential patterns associ-
ated with adjectives in natural language. As we have
tried to make clear from this brief report, the seman-
tic behavior of adjectives in actual language use are
much more nuanced and subtle than previously doc-
umented. We hope to report on further results and
insights in the near future.4
