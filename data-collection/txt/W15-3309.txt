Abstract
In this paper, we describe the treatment
of extraction in HaG, an emerging compu-
tational grammar of Hausa, concentrating
on the intricate patterns of interaction be-
tween resumptive and gap strategies. We
shall argue with Tuller (1986) that Hausa
resumption (both overt and covert) opens
up the possibility for relativisation only to
escape well-attested extraction islands in
the language. As suggested by the mutual
compatibility of gaps and resumptives in
ATB extraction, however, we shall conclude
that both strategies must be regarded as un-
bounded dependencies (UDCs) to be mod-
elled via the feature in HPSG. We
shall discuss how the treatment of UDCs
has been generalised, in HaG, to permit
more than one simultaneous depen-
dency, and focus in particular on how the
distinction between true gaps and resump-
tive elements can be exploited to ad-
dress efficiency issues.

1 Resumptives and gaps in Hausa
extraction

Like many other languages, Hausa makes use of
extraction in a variety of constructions, including
relative clause formation, matrix and embedded
wh-questions, and focus fronting. Alongside gap
strategies, familiar from English, Hausa also em-
ploys resumption, marking the extraction site with
a pronominal.

The distribution of gaps and resumptives partly
overlap: while in some contexts only a resump-
tive strategy is possible, e.g. with possessors of

nouns (1), or with complements of non-locative
prepositions (2), extraction of core arguments (di-
rect/indirect objects) in general permits both strate-
gies, with a clear preference for zero expression in
the case of direct objects (Newman, 2000; Jaggar,
2001) for short extraction.

As stated by Crysmann (2012), the preference
for direct object gaps, however, is much reduced in
slightly more complex cases, involving, e.g. Across-
The-Board (ATB) extraction or long-distance rel-
ativisation (see the discussion below), making re-
sumption a natural, if not the only option. As shown
in (4), an overt resumptive is retained in the second
conjunct.

Example (4) further illustrates that extraction
from coordinate structures in Hausa appears to treat
resumptives on a par with gaps, as far as the ATB
constraint is concerned. Another important obser-
vation relates to the possibility of ATB extraction to
target different grammatical functions in both con-
junct, as illustrated in (5).

A central property of Hausa resumption is that
it permits long distance relativisation out of extrac-
tion islands: these include relative clauses, embed-
ded wh-clauses, subject clauses, and complement
clauses of non-bridge verbs (see Tuller (1986) for
the full set of data). We illustrate here on the ba-
sis of embedded relative clauses: as shown below,
relativisation of an indirect (6) or human direct ob-
ject (7) out of relatives is fine, provided there is a
resumptive in situ.

The grammar of extraction in Hausa heavily in-
teracts with argument drop: as discussed by Tuller
(1986), Hausa allows pro drop not only with sub-
jects, but also with non-human direct objects, which
receive a specific, i.e. non-generic interpretation
(Jaggar, 2001). Subject properties are identified by
agreement marking on the discrete TAM markers.

As discovered by Tuller (1986), the possibility
for relativisation to escape what are otherwise ex-
traction islands in the language extends from overt
resumptives to zero pronominals. I.e., she observes
that non-human direct objects, which can be freely
pro-dropped, do permit long relativisation out of is-
lands even without an overt resumptive, whereas di-
rect objects with human reference do so only if re-
alised overtly by a direct object pronominal affix.

The very same can be shown to hold for wh is-
lands: again, relativisation out of wh clauses is pos-
sible for subjects, and for non-human direct objects,
even without an overt resumptive.

The converse, however, is not true: wh phrases
never extract out of either relative or embedded wh
clauses, regardless of the presence of overt or covert
resumptives. Examples (14) and (15) illustrates this
for subjects and non-human direct objects, whereas
(17) provides evidence that resumption (here with
an oblique) does not improve acceptability.

To summarise the empirical data, relativisation in
Hausa is insensitive to extraction islands, provided
the presence of a resumptive pronoun at the extrac-
tion site. Other types of extraction, like wh or fo-
cus fronting, do not exhibit this property, regard-
less of the presence of resumptives. As suggested
by extraction from coordinate structures, however,
resumptives are fully compatible with gaps, as far
as the ATB constraint is concerned. We therefore
conclude that both processes should be considered
unbounded dependency constructions (UDCs), yet
the specific constraints on locality and on the use of
gaps vs. resumptives should be associated with prop-
erties of the elements at the top or the bottom of the
dependency: i.e. the difference between a single rel-
ative marker merely mediating coreference with the
antecedent noun vs. a full displaced constituent, as
well as the nature of the governing head at the ex-
traction site, i.e. verbs vs. prepositions.

1.1 Previous approaches
The first extensive formal study of Hausa extraction
and resumption certainly is Tuller’s (1986) doctoral
dissertation on the language. Using a GB frame-
work she suggests to account for the difference
between island-insensitive resumptive relativisation
and wh extraction bymeans of a distinction between
base-generation and binding of a pronominal for rel-
ativisation vs. Ā movement for wh-extraction. Re-
sumptives found in wh extraction as complements
of obliques or possessors of nouns, by contrast, are
treated as instances of phonetic trace (Koopman,
1984). The multitude of analytic devices (both base
generation and movement with phonetic trace) for
what appears to be a single phenomenon (resump-
tion) has been criticised in Crysmann (2012).
Within HPSG, one of the first studies are the

works of Nathan Vaillette on resumption in He-
brew (2001a) and Irish (2001b), proposing two
separate features for gap and resumptive extrac-
tions. This separation has been criticised re-
peatedly in the HPSG literature, including Tagh-
vaipour (2004; Taghvaipour (2005b; Taghvaipour
(2005a), (Alotaibi and Borsley, 2013), and (Crys-
mann, 2012), mainly based on the known compati-
bility of gaps and resumptives in ATB extraction.

More specifically, Crysmann (2012) argues, on
the basis of the Hausa data, for the compatibility
between the two types of extractions. He shows fur-
ther that no HPSG treatment available at the time
was capable to capture the differences with respect
to extraction islands. He suggests that both types
of unbounded dependencies should be regarded as

dependencies, distinguishing gap and resump-
tive dependencies in terms of the properties of the

elements. More precisely, he argues that gaps
require sharing of entire values, whereas shar-
ing of values is sufficient for resumptives (see
Borsley (2010; Alotaibi and Borsley (2013) for a
similar proposal). Since the description of resump-
tives subsumes that of gaps, the ATB facts are read-
ily explained. The differences in locality, however,
are due to constraints imposed at the retrieval site:
while wh and focus fronting require full sharing of
their values, relatives merely require index
sharing. If retrieval sites are transparent to indices,
but not to full local values, the empirical pattern can
be explained with a single mechanism.
A previous implementation of resumption in

HaG has treated these elements essentially like gaps,
including the restriction of to contain at most
one element at any time. In this paper, we shall ex-
plore how the empirically and theoretically more de-
sirable approach advanced in Crysmann (2012) can
be put to use in a computational grammar of the
language.

2 Implementation in LKB & friends
The implementation in HaG follows quite closely
the theoretical proposal made in Crysmann (2012).
Thus, both gap and resumptive dependencies are
represented on , HPSG’s feature for extrac-
tion, distinguishing them for the purposes of island
effects in terms of the elements rather than by virtue
of a distinct unbounded dependency.

2.1 The Grammar Matrix
The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002)
is a starter kit for the development of HPSG gram-
mars running on the LKB (Copestake, 2002), Pet
(Callmeier, 2000) and Ace (by Woodley Packard
(Crysmann and Packard, 2012)) platforms. Gram-
mars running on these platforms use a conjunctive
subset of TDL (Krieger, 1996) as their descrip-
tion language and Minimal Recursion Semantics
(Copestake et al., 2005) for meaning representation.
The Grammar Matrix not only makes for fast boot-
strapping of new grammars, it also ensures a high de-
gree of parallelism, owing to a carefully worked out
constraint set on meaning construction combined

67



with a type hierarchy of rule types, suitable for a
wider range of syntactic constructions.
The Matrix has been distilled to a great extent

from the LinGO ERG (Copestake and Flickinger,
2000). As for extraction, both the ERG and the
Matrix are highly faithful to the theory of un-
bounded dependencies advanced by Sag (1997) and
Ginzburg and Sag (2001): thus, passing of non-local
features (most notably ) proceeds in a head-
driven fashion, with heads amalgamating the -

values of their arguments.

In the ERG and the Matrix, amalgamation is bro-
ken down into four constraints depending on the ar-
ity of the argument structure list, one of which any
lexical head will inherit from. Owing to the absence
of sets (and set union) in the underlying formalism,
set-valued features are represented by means of dif-
ference lists (Clocksin and Mellish, 1981) instead,1
instead, as shown in the example for two-element
argument structure lists in (20).

Among the lexical amalgamation types, there is

already one definition in the Matrix specifically
aimed at resumptive pronouns, i.e. the possibility to
launch a non-local dependency that does not corre-
spond to an argument. However, this constraint will
only ever be suitable for free pronouns, not bound
ones, as we find in Hausa, since the type constraint
is defined on the level of the lexical entry. Further-
more, resumption is still treated as entirely identical
to gap-type extraction.
Besides thesemore technical issues, there is, how-

ever, a more fundamental difference between the
1Difference lists permit list concatenation by means of uni-

fication: essentially, such lists maintain a pointer ( ) to the
open end of the list. We shall use exclamation marks to distin-
guish these from ordinary lists, as is the convention in DELPH-
IN grammars (Copestake, 2002, cf.).

treatment of dependencies in the theoreti-
cal HPSG literature and its implementation in the
ERG and the Matrix: while Pollard and Sag (1994)
clearly argue that more than one element can be in

at the same time, the ERG and the Matrix
both limit the length of the list to at most
one, thereby ruling out the combination of strong
and weak UDCs witnessed in (21). The reason be-
hind this restriction is most certainly related to pro-
cessing efficiency.

(21) [A violin this well crafted]1 even [the most
difficult sonata]2 will be easy to play _2 on
_e1 ? (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 169)

While for English, cases ofmultiple simultaneous
dependencies can possibly be marginalised

without jeopardising overall coverage on natural lan-
guage data, this is certainly not the case in a variety
of other languages, including multiple wh-fronting
in Slavic, or long-distance relativisation in Hausa.
Thus, a more systematic solution is called for that
we shall develop in the following section.

2.2 Multiple SLASH dependencies
Since HaG is based on the Grammar Matrix, the
current general approach to extraction is already
head-driven, in accordance with the current consen-
sus amongst HPSG scholars. Since restrictions on
the size of are imposed on introduction and
retrieval, we can concentrate on these two critical
points in our discussion of extraction in HaG.

2.2.1 Launching
With the exception of adjunct extraction,2 gaps in
HaG are introduced by means of unary lexical rules
suppressing a valency corresponding to an argument
introduced into , essentially following Pollard
and Sag (1994), Sag (1997), Ginzburg and Sag
(2001), as well as common practice in the ERG and
theMatrix. In addition, a unary phrase structure rule
permits launching of adjunct extractions.
As for resumptives, the current implementation

maintains two sets of lexical rules, one for bound
pronominals and one for bound resumptives, as well
as two sets of lexical entries for pronominals and re-
sumptives. Making systematic use of the type hier-
archy of rules and lexical types, shared properties
of resumptive and non-resumptive uses, including
autosegmental morphophonological properties, are
abstracted out into common supertypes. Most cru-
cially, in the true pronominal case, a semantic rela-
tion is inserted into the MRS list and the

2See Levine (2003) for arguments to distinguish adjunct
and complement extraction in English along the syntax/lexicon
divide.

68



value is restricted to be empty, whereas in the re-
sumptive case, the list is empty, but con-
tains an element the referential index of which is
shared with that of the resumptive. Owing to the
absence of internal disjunction from the underlying
feature formalism (rules and lexical entries are in
disjunctive normal form), specification of separate
rules and entries for both uses turned out to be un-
avoidable.3 In order to keep the number of disjunc-
tive specifications to an absolute minimum, we have
therefore generalised the existing 3 sets of morpho-
logical rules for pronominal affixation (objective,
genitive, dative), capturing the difference in shape
by reference to the segmental make-up of the base,
rather than in terms of the syntactic category of the
base, enabling us to collapse all three sets into one.
This move was greatly facilitated by the fact that
nouns and verbs, as well as the applicative marker
wà independently undergo characteristic inflection
for the type of argument realisation of their first
complement (Crysmann, 2005), distinguishing inter
alia realisation by a pronominal affix: e.g., pronomi-
nal affixes from the genitive set are always preceded
by the gender differentiated linker -n/-r (cf. exam-
ple (1)), a segment that is crucially absent in final
positions of all verbs taking pronominal affixes from
the direct object set. To account for differences in
tonal specification (genitive set is low, whereas ob-
jective set alternates), we generalised our previous
treatment of “polar” tone with objective pronouns,
representing the tonal specification of the pronomi-
nal affix as a floating tone of the base. In fact,
Following Crysmann (2012), the main difference

between gap and resumptive values is that
the former require reentrancy with a full local value,
whereas the latter are underspecified in this respect:
minimally, they only require identity of . Elab-
orating on the hierarchy of synsem proposed in Sag
(1997), we have complemented the gap subtype of
synsem with a type for resumptives and abstracted
out shared minimal requirements into a common su-
per type.

Both rules perform a valence reduction, but do

so imposing constraints of different strength on the
locally suppressed complement. Since elements of
the valence list are reentrant with - , the
restriction towards will be picked up correctly
by amalgamation. For resumption, the gram-
mar distinguishes variants for null realisation (sub-
ject and non-human direct object) and pronominal
affixation.
On the basis of the distinction between full-local

and light-local values, we have furthermore defined
typed list constraints that permit to restrict what
kind of dependencies can be active simultaneously.
As we have seen above, only relativisation can es-
cape wh-islands in Hausa, provided the dependency
involves a resumptive. Furthermore, relative clause
formation, in contrast to wh-extraction and focus
fronting, does not permit pied-piping. Thus, mul-
tiple simultaneous dependencies can involve
at most one single gap type dependency at any node.
Most importantly, this state of affairs enables us to
ensure termination in the light of adjunct extraction
which involves true gaps: whenever a true gap is in-
serted into , the remainder of the list is
constrained to consist entirely of elements of type
light-local. Complement extraction lexical rules are
constrained in a similar fashion.

2.2.2 Retrieval
Given that values may contain multiple ele-
ments, retrieval at the top of the dependency marks
a more clear departure from common practice in the
Grammar Matrix: in essence, we need to search the

list for a suitable element to be bound off, and

69



pass on any light-local elements to be retrieved fur-
ther up the tree.
The grammar has exactly two constructions

where retrieval can take place, the first one being a
classical filler-head construction to be used for bind-
ing wh and focus-fronted fillers, both of which al-
low pied-piping. As for relatives, we follow Borsley
and assume that Hausa relative “pronouns” are ac-
tually (inflected) relative complementisers that take
the clause containing a gap or resumptive as its com-
plement. This assumption not only takes care of
the impossibility of pied-piping in relative clauses,
but it also captures nicely the similarity of the un-
inflected relative complementiser dà to its homony-
mous non-relative counterpart. What is common to
both constructions is that they define a non-empty
- value (cf. Pollard and Sag (1994)).4 In

filler-head structures, the dependency to be
retrieved is constrained to be of type full-local by
virtue of structure sharing with the filler’s
value, whereas no such constraint is imposed by the
relative complementiser which only requires a refer-
ential index.

Two unary retrieval rules then take care of bind-

ing the filler to an appropriate percolated ele-
ment and to pass on any elements of type light-local.

4All lexical entries other than the relative complementiser
require their entire - value to be empty (i.e. both -

. and - . ). Furthermore, we constrain the
type head-nexus-phrase (Sag, 1997) as well as standard unary
phrase structure rules to effect structure sharing of - be-
tween the mother and the (head) daughter. Similarly, elements
on - are equally restricted to have empty - features.
As a net effect, no other syntactic rule can interfere in the mid-
dle of retrieval.

While the bind-filler-rule performs the actual in-

stantiation and retrieval of the unbounded depen-
dency, the find-filler-rule merely iterates over the
original difference list and puts back one by
one the original elements, constrained to light-local.
In essence, these rules jointly ensure the island re-
striction towards non-resumptive dependen-
cies: since extraction out of relative and wh islands
is restricted to relativisation footed by a resump-
tive, the constraints on light-local for further per-
colation after the first retrieval of a element
accounts for the ungrammaticality of, e.g. (14) and
(15), while still permitting relativisation out of rela-
tives, as witnessed in (18).5

5One might wonder why we insist on full perusal of ( ),
even after a filler has been found, instead of merely constrain-
ing the remainder of the list using the aforementioned list types.
First, this recursion does not add any complexity factor beyond
the possibility of that introduced by considering alternative in-
stantiations for the filler. Second, recreating the list re-
cursively step by step from the unretrieved elements enables us
to get rid of any latent constraints on the open end of the list
regarding local type: once we have retrieved a full-local depen-
dency, we want to be able to add new gap dependencies further

2.2.3 ATB extraction
The underspecification approach to resumptives, i.e.
their compatibility with both light-local and full-
local, already ensures the compatibility between
true gaps and resumption in ATB extraction from
coordinated structures. Furthermore, given the am-
biguity of pronominals between resumptive and true
pronoun uses, identity requirements will only have
to hold for those pronominals that actually enter in
a non-local dependency.
To this end, we restrict coordinating construc-

tions to enforce identity of entire lists, as
shown in (30).

A complicating factor, however, comes in ow-

ing to the use of lists, instead of sets, imposed by
the underlying formalism. As detailed in Newman
(2000), ATB extraction may target different gram-
matical functions in both conjuncts. Since Hausa
also permits multiple relativisation from the same
clause (Tuller, 1986), we expect multiple ATB rela-
tivisation to be possible also with reversal of gram-
matical functions, as illustrated by the (constructed)
example in (31).

‘Here’s the man that you know the woman who he likes
but (who) hates him.’

In order to allow for this possibility, we com-
plement the standard coordination schema sketched
above with an alternative one that has the first ele-
ments of the right conjunct reversed.
For efficiency reasons, I am currently limiting

myself to permutation of the first two ele-
ments. This decision, however, is supported by
the observation that triple relativisation in itself is
already considered marked to some extent: see
Tuller’s question mark on the relevant example in
(18). While these data clearly contrast with the un-
acceptability of island violations, I seriously doubt
that their marked acceptability will improve when
combined with ATB extraction from non-parallel
up the tree, independently of whether this new element
will be prepended or appended to our current list.

conjuncts, thereby further increasing complexity.
Thus, until we have evidence to the contrary, I shall
refrain, for the time being, from full permutation of

lists greater than 2, assuming parallelism of
dependencies except for the first two elements.

3 Conclusion
We have argued in this paper that Hausa extrac-
tion militates for an extension of current practice
in HPSG grammar implementation to permit mul-
tiple simultaneous dependencies. Based on
the theoretical proposal by Crysmann (2012), we
have provided an implementation of the Hausa ex-
traction facts. In essence, we have generalised the
constraints on to permit multiple members at
any time, but have systematically exploited the dis-
tinction between light and full local values to con-
strain multiple extraction to involve at most on gap
simultaneously. This not only correctly captures the
island constraints in Hausa, but it also provides a
straightforward means to ensure efficiency, includ-
ing termination of adjunct extraction. Furthermore,
to keep disjunctive specifications of pronominal and
resumptive uses to a minimum, we have developed
a more generalised treatment of pronominal affixa-
tion in the language, collapsing morphological rules
for genitive accusative and dative pronominal af-
fixes. In future work, we shall explore how the
systematic ambiguity between resumptive and non-
resumptive uses of pronominals may be captured
without disjunctive specification at all, in order to
provide a complete answer to McCloskey’s (2002)
generalisation.
