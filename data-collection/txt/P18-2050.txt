Abstract

Every person speaks or writes their own
flavor of their native language, influenced
by a number of factors: the content they
tend to talk about, their gender, their
social status, or their geographical ori-
gin. When attempting to perform Ma-
chine Translation (MT), these variations
have a significant effect on how the sys-
tem should perform translation, but this
is not captured well by standard one-size-
fits-all models. In this paper, we propose a
simple and parameter-efficient adaptation
technique that only requires adapting the
bias of the output softmax to each partic-
ular user of the MT system, either directly
or through a factored approximation. Ex-
periments on TED talks in three languages
demonstrate improvements in translation
accuracy, and better reflection of speaker
traits in the target text.

1 Introduction

The production of language varies depending on
the speaker or author, be it to reflect personal
traits (e.g. job, gender, role, dialect) or the top-
ics that tend to be discussed (e.g. technology, law,
religion). Current Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) systems do not incorporate any explicit in-
formation about the speaker, and this forces the
model to learn these traits implicitly. This is a
difficult and indirect way to capture inter-personal
variations, and in some cases it is impossible with-
out external context (Table 1, Mirkin et al. (2015)).

Recent work has incorporated side information
about the author such as personality (Mirkin et al.,
2015), gender (Rabinovich et al., 2017) or polite-
ness (Sennrich et al., 2016a), but these methods
can only handle phenomena where there are ex-

plicit labels for the traits. Our work investigates
how we can efficiently model speaker-related vari-
ations to improve NMT models.

In particular, we are interested in improving our
NMT system given few training examples for any
particular speaker. We propose to approach this
task as a domain adaptation problem with an ex-
tremely large number of domains and little data for
each domain, a setting where we may expect tradi-
tional approaches to domain adaptation that adjust
all model parameters to be sub-optimal (§2). Our
proposed solution involves modeling the speaker-
specific variations as an additional bias vector in
the softmax layer, where we either learn this bias
directly, or through a factored model that treats
each user as a mixture of a few prototypical bias
vectors (§3).

We construct a new dataset of Speaker Anno-
tated TED talks (SATED, §4) to validate our ap-
proach. Adaptation experiments (§5) show that
explicitly incorporating speaker information into
the model improves translation quality and accu-
racy with respect to speaker traits.1

2 Problem Formulation and Baselines

In the rest of this paper, we refer to the person

etc. . . ) generically as the speaker. We denote as S
the set of all speakers.

The usual objective of NMT is to find parame-
ters θ of the conditional distribution p(y | x; θ) to
maximize the empirical likelihood. We argue that
personal variations in language warrant decom-
posing the empirical distribution into |S| speaker
specific domains Ds and learning a different set of
parameters θs for each. This setting exhibits spe-
cific traits that set it apart from common domain
adaptation settings:

1. The number of speakers is very large. Our
particular setting deals with |S| ≈ 1800 but
our approaches should be able to accommo-
date orders of magnitude more speakers.

2. There is very little data (even monolin-
gual, let alone bilingual or parallel) for each
speaker, compared to millions of sentences
usually used in NMT.

3. As a consequence of 1, we can assume that
many speakers share similar characteristics
such as gender, social status, and as such may
have similar associated domains.2

2.1 Baseline NMT model
All of our experiments are based on a standard
neural sequence to sequence model. We use one
layer LSTMs as the encoder and decoder and the
concat attention mechanism described in Luong
and Manning (2015). We share the parameters
in the embedding and softmax matrix of the de-
coder as proposed in Press and Wolf (2017). All
the layers have dimension 512 except for the atten-
tion layer (dimension 256). To make our baseline
competitive, we apply several regularization tech-
niques such as dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) in
the output layer and within the LSTM (using the
variant presented in Gal and Ghahramani, 2016).
We also drop words in the target sentence with
probability 0.1 according to Iyyer et al. (2015)
and implement label smoothing as proposed in
Szegedy et al. (2016) with coefficient 0.1. Ap-
pendix A provides a more thorough description of
the baseline model.

2.2 Baseline adaptation strategy
As mentioned in §2, our goal is to learn a sep-
arate conditional distribution p(y | x, s) and

2Note that the speakers are still unique, and many might
use very specific words (e.g. the name of their company or of
a specific medical procedure that they are an expert on).

parametrization θs to improve translation for
speaker s. The usual way of adapting from gen-
eral domain parameters θ to θs is to retrain the
full model on the domain specific data (Luong and
Manning, 2015). Naively applying this approach
in the context of personalizing a model for each
speaker however has two main drawbacks:

Parameter cost Maintaining a set of model pa-
rameters for each speaker is expensive. For ex-
ample, the model in §2.1 has ≈47M parameters
when the vocabulary size is 40k, as is the case in
our experiments in §5. Assuming each parame-
ter is stored as a 32bit float, every speaker-specific
model costs ≈188MB. In a production environ-
ment with thousands to billions of speakers, this
is impractical.

Overfitting Training each speaker model with
very little data is a challenge, necessitating care-
ful and heavy regularization (Miceli Barone et al.,
2017) and an early stopping procedure.

2.3 Domain Token
A more efficient domain adaptation technique is
the domain token idea used in Sennrich et al.
(2016a); Chu et al. (2017): introduce an additional
token marking the domain in the source and/or the
target sentence. In experiments, we add a token
indicating the speaker at the start of the target sen-
tence for each speaker. We refer to this method as
the spk token method in the following.

Note that in this case there is now only an em-
bedding vector (of dimension 512 in our experi-
ments) for each speaker. However, the resulting
domain embedding are non-trivial to interpret (i.e.
it is not clear what they tell us about the domain or
speaker itself).

3 Speaker-specific Vocabulary Bias

In NMT models, the final choice of which word
to use in the next step t of translation is generally
performed by the following softmax equation

pt = softmax(ET ot + bT ) (1)

where ot is predicted in a context-sensitive man-
ner by the NMT system and ET and bT are the
weight matrix and bias vector parameters respec-
tively. Importantly, bT governs the overall likeli-
hood that the NMT model will choose particular
vocabulary. In this section, we describe our pro-
posed methods for making this bias term speaker-

ent adaptation models for the softmax layer. From
top to bottom is the base softmax, the full bias

specific, which provides an efficient way to allow
for speaker-specific vocabulary choice.3

3.1 Full speaker bias
We first propose to learn speaker-specific param-
eters for the bias term in the output softmax only.
This means changing Eq. 1 to

pt = softmax(ET ot + bT + bs) (2)

for speaker s. This only requires learning and stor-
ing a vector equal to the size of the vocabulary,
which is a mere 0.09% of the parameters in the full
model in our experiments. In effect, this greatly
reducing the parameter cost and concerns of over-
fitting cited in §2.2. This model is also easy to
interpret as each coordinate of the bias vector cor-
responds to a log-probability on the target vocab-
ulary. We refer to this variant as full bias.

3.2 Factored speaker bias
The biases for a set of speakers S on a vocabulary
V can be represented as a matrix:

B ∈ R|S|×|V| (3)

where each row of B is one speaker bias bs. In
this formulation, the |S| rows are still linearly in-
dependent, meaning that B is high rank. In prac-
tical terms, this means that we cannot share infor-
mation among users about how their vocabulary

3Notably, while this limits the model to only handling
word choice and does not explicitly allow it to model syn-
tactic variations, favoring certain words over others can indi-
rectly favor certain phenomena (e.g. favoring passive speech
by increasing the probability of auxiliaries).

selection co-varies, which is likely sub-ideal given
that speakers share common characteristics.

Thus, we propose another parametrization of
the speaker bias, fact bias, where the B matrix
is factored according to:

B =SB̃

S ∈R|S|×r,
B̃ ∈Rr×|V|

(4)

where S is a matrix of speaker vectors of low di-
mension r and B̃ is a matrix of r speaker inde-
pendent biases. Here, the bias for each speaker
is a mixture of r “centroid” biases B̃ with r
speaker “weights”. This reduces the total number
of parameters allocated to speaker adaptation from
|S||V| to r(|S| + |V|). In our experiments, this
corresponds to using between 99.38 and 99.45%
fewer parameters than the full bias model de-
pending on the language pair, with r parameters
per speaker. In this work, we will use r = 10.

We provide a graphical summary of our pro-
posed approaches in figure 1.

4 Speaker Annotated TED Talks Dataset

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, we construct a new dataset,
Speaker Annotated TED (SATED) based on TED
talks,4 with three language pairs, English-French
(en-fr), English-German (en-de) and English-
Spanish (en-es) and speaker annotation.

The dataset consists of transcripts directly col-
lected from https://www.ted.com/talks, and
contains roughly 271K sentences in each language
distributed among 2324 talks. We pre-process the
data by removing sentences that don’t have any
translation or are longer than 60 words, lower-
casing, and tokenizing (using the Moses tokenizer
(Koehn et al., 2007)).

315

Some talks are partially or not translated in
some of the languages (in particular there are
fewer translations in German than in French or
Spanish), we therefore remove any talk with less
than 10 translated sentences in each language pair.

The data is then partitioned into training, vali-
dation and test sets. We split the corpus such that
the test and validation split each contain 2 sentence
pairs from each talk, thus ensuring that all talks are
present in every split. Each sentence pair is anno-
tated with the name of the talk and the speaker.
Table 2 lists statistics on the three language pairs.

5 Experiments

We run a set of experiments to validate the abil-
ity of our proposed approach to model speaker-
induced variations in translation.

5.1 Experimental setup

We test three models base (a baseline ignoring
speaker labels), full bias and fact bias. Dur-
ing training, we limit our vocabulary to the 40,000
most frequent words. Additionally, we discard any
word appearing less than 2 times. Any word that
doesn’t satisfy those conditions is replaced with an
UNK token.5

All our models are implemented with the DyNet
(Neubig et al., 2017) framework, and unless speci-
fied we use the default settings therein. We refer to
appendix B for a detailed explanation of the train-
ing process. We translate the test set using beam
search with beam size 5.

5.2 Does explicitly modeling speaker-related
variation improve translation quality?

Table 3 shows final test scores for each model with
statistical significance measured with paired boot-

5Recent NMT systems also commonly use sub-word
units (Sennrich et al., 2016b). This may influence on
the result, either negatively (less direct control over high-
frequency words) or positively (more capacity to adapt to
high-frequency words). We leave a careful examination of
these effects for future work.

Table 3: Test BLEU. Scores significantly (p <
0.05) better than the baseline are written in bold

strap resampling (Koehn, 2004). As shown in the
table, both proposed methods give significant im-
provements in BLEU score, with the biggest gains
in English to French (+0.99) and smaller gains in
German and Spanish (+0.74 and +0.40 respec-
tively). Reducing the number of parameters with
fact bias gives slightly better (en-fr) or worse
(en-de) BLEU score, but in those cases the results
are still significantly better than the baseline.

However, BLEU is not a perfect evaluation met-
ric. In particular, we are interested in evaluating
how much of the personal traits of each speaker
our models capture. To gain more insight into this
aspect of the MT results, we devise a simple ex-
periment. For every language pair, we train a clas-
sifier (continuous bag-of-n-grams; details in Ap-
pendix C) to predict the author of each sentence
on the target language part of the training set. We
then evaluate the classifier on the ground truth and
the outputs from our 3 models (base, full bias
and fact bias).

The results are reported in Figure 2. As can
be seen from the figure, it is easier to predict the
author of a sentence from the output of speaker-
specific models than from the baseline. This
demonstrates that explicitly incorporating infor-
mation about the author of a sentence allows for
better transfer of personal traits during transla-
tions, although the difference from the ground
truth demonstrates that this problem is still far
from solved. Appendix D shows qualitative ex-
amples of our model improving over the baseline.

5.3 Further experiments on the Europarl
corpus

One of the quirks of the TED talks is that the
speaker annotation correlates with the topic of
their talk to a high degree. Although the topics that
a speaker talks about can be considered as a man-
ifestation of speaker traits, we also perform a con-
trol experiment on a different dataset to verify that
our model is indeed learning more than just topical

information. Specifically, we train our models on
a speaker annotated version of the Europarl corpus
(Rabinovich et al., 2017), on the en-de language
pair6.

We use roughly the same training procedure
as the one described in §5.1, with a random
train/dev/test split since none is provided in the
original dataset. Note that in this case, the num-
ber of speakers is much lower (747) whereas the
total size of the dataset is bigger (≈300k).

We report the results in table 4. Although
the difference is less salient than in the case
of SATED, our factored bias model still per-
forms significantly better than the baseline (+0.83
BLEU). This suggests that even outside the con-
text of TED talks, our proposed method is capable
of improvements over a speaker-agnostic model.

Domain adaptation techniques for MT often rely
on data selection (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Li
et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017),
tuning (Luong and Manning, 2015; Miceli Barone
et al., 2017), or adding domain tags to NMT input
(Chu et al., 2017). There are also methods that
fine-tune parameters of the model on each sen-
tence in the test set (Li et al., 2016), and meth-
ods that adapt based on human post-edits (Turchi
et al., 2017), although these follow our baseline
adaptation strategy of tuning all parameters. There
are also partial update methods for transfer learn-
ing, albeit for the very different task of transfer
between language pairs (Zoph et al., 2016).

rule based MT systems. In the context of data-
driven systems, previous work has treated spe-
cific traits such as politeness or gender as a “do-
main” in domain adaptation models and applied
adaptation techniques such as adding a “polite-
ness tag” to moderate politeness (Sennrich et al.,
2016a), or doing data selection to create gender-
specific corpora for training (Rabinovich et al.,
2017). The aforementioned methods differ from
ours in that they require explicit signal (gender,
politeness. . . ) for which labeling (manual or au-
tomatic) is needed, and also handle a limited num-
ber of “domains” (≈ 2), where our method only
requires annotation of the speaker, and must scale
to a much larger number of “domains” (≈ 1, 800).

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have explained and motivated
the challenge of modeling the speaker explicitly
in NMT systems, then proposed two models to do
so in a parameter-efficient way. We cast this prob-
lem as an extreme form of domain adaptation and
showed that, even when adapting a small propor-
tion of parameters (the softmax bias, < 0.1% of
all parameters), allowed the model to better reflect
personal linguistic variations through translation.

We further showed that the number of parame-
ters specific to any person could be reduced to as
low as 10 while still retaining better scores than
a baseline for some language pairs, making it vi-
able in a real world application with potentially
millions of different users.
