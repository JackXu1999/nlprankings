Abstract

In this paper, we offer an overview of language technology tools and resources
(being) developed for an endangered minority language, Mansi. We pay special
attention to lexical resources and morphological analyzers. Online dictionaries,
morphological analyzers and a corpus are already available (or will be made avail-
able soon) for the language, which are described in the paper. Moreover, we also
briefly present our efforts to contribute to the field of Mansi language technol-
ogy. In several cases the weaknesses of existing resources or tools motivated us
to implement some new tools, which are also presented in the paper. All of the
tools and resources developed by us will be made freely available for the research
community and anyone interested.

1 Introduction
According to a UNESCO review (UNESCO 2003) 50-90% of the known languages on
Earth are likely to become extinct by the end of the century, thus any research on the
unobserved aspects of endangered languages requires no further justification. Be-
sides the importance of language documentation, the necessity of sociolinguistic or

anthropological linguistic research as well as creating tools for language users and
language learners is unquestionable.

The urbanization of indigenous people of Siberia has rarely been studied from a
linguistic, ethnographic or cultural anthropological viewpoint, which calls for imme-
diate reaction as excluding cities from fieldwork may often result in neglecting the
majority of the Siberian population. This is especially true for people belonging to
minorities in Russia: as for Obi-Ugric people, about a half of them cannot partici-
pate in linguistic and ethnographic studies [1]. Hence, sociolinguistic research of the
Mansi language, especially revitalization efforts and the usage of urban language is
of utmost importance.

In this paper, we aim at offering a landscape of language technology resources
and tools for an endangered minority language, Mansi. Mansi (former term: Vogul) is
an extremely endangered indigenous Uralic (more precisely Finno-Ugric, Ugric, Ob-
Ugric) language, in minority position, spoken in Western Siberia, especially on the
territory of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. Among the approximately 13,000
people who declared to be ethnic Mansi according to the data of the latest Russian
federal census in 2010 only 938 stated that they could speak theMansi language, which
shows drastic decrease compared with the 2002 census figures (2,746 speakers).

TheMansi have been traditionally living on hunting, fishing, to a lesser extent also
on reindeer breeding, they got acquainted with agriculture and urban lifestyle basi-
cally during the Soviet period. Urban lifestyle gained prominent importance in the last
decades, the proportion of Mansis living in large villages, towns and cities has been
constantly growing and by 2010 exceeded half of the Mansi population (57%). This
tendency together with the unsatisfactory access to Mansi education and the weak-
ening intergenerational transmission of the language makes the situation of Mansi
vulnerable. Besides their scientific and academic novelty, the vulnerability of Mansi
language also underlines the importance of creating computational tools for Mansi,
for the benefit of scholars and researchers as well as language learners and language
users.

The principles of Soviet linguistic policy according to which the Mansi literary
language has been designed kept changing from time to time. After using Latin tran-
scription for a short period, Mansi language planners had to switch to the Cyrillic
transcription in 1937. While until the 1950s the more general tendency was to create
new Mansi words to describe the formerly unknown phenomena, later on the usage
of Russian loanwords became more dominant. Since the 1990s the tendencies gov-
erning the planning of Mansi language use and language acquisition have become
multidimensional, important differences and interferences may be observed between
the different actors of language use, especially the leading specialists (mainly follow-
ing the Soviet academic policy) and the journalists (using and promoting the language

on a daily basis, with the largest active number of followers). During our work we
try to take every approach into consideration, when it is impossible to compromise
(e.g. questions related to orthography), we tend to follow the examples found in ma-
jority language use.

In this paper, we aim at summarizing the current situation ofMansi within compu-
tational linguistics: we give a summary of the existing tools and resources (with spe-
cial regard to lexical resources and morphological analyzers) and we will also briefly
present our efforts to contribute to the field.

2 Lexical resources

2.1 Online dictionaries for Mansi

There are only a handful of dictionaries available for Mansi. The vocabularies col-
lected by the early researchers of Mansi, Munkácsi’s and Kannisto’s (published as
late as [2] and [3]) serve as great contribution and unfailing source of data for re-
searchers. Nonetheless, they are inadequate for creating computational tools that
would be equally useful for researchers and Mansi language users as well, partly
because both dictionaries use especially detailed Latin-based script with plenty of
diacritics, and partly because both dictionaries incorporate materials of different di-
alects and subdialects that have become extinct since the days of Munkácsi’s and Kan-
nisto’s fieldworks. We are also aware of one small dictionary for Mansi (available at
http://glosbe.com/mns), though this resource is limited in size as it is based on
about 200 translated sentences, moreover, it applies Cyrillic and Latin transcriptions
inconsistently.

Thus, instead of starting from the larger dictionaries compiled by European re-
searchers, we decided to begin our work with the smaller, but more actively used
dictionaries published by Mansi researchers, that is the Mansi-Russian-Mansi dictio-
nary by Rombandeeva and Kuzakova (4,000 entries) [4] and the Russian-Mansi dic-
tionary by Rombandeeva (11,000 entries) [5]. These dictionaries use Cyrillic script,
contain most of the currently used Mansi vocabulary, and are often consulted by na-
tive Mansi or specialists working with the Mansi language and they are widely used
in Mansi education.

The process of dictionary building is the following: the automatic optical character
recognition is followed by manual correction and translation of the entries, and then
this database is turned into a searchable, digitized dictionary [6], as detailed below.

The beta version of the onlineMansi dictionary now contains approximately 20,000

58



entries¹. The Mansi forms were retrieved from the PDF versions of Rombandeeva’s
and Kuzakova’s [4], as well as Rombandeeva’s [5] dictionaries by means of optical
character recognition, then lexical entries from different sources were merged. It
was also noted which dictionary and which page they come from. Translations that
included several synonyms were added as separate items. The Mansi lexemes are
supplemented with the Russian translation given by the dictionaries, and Hungarian
(complete) and English (in progress) translations provided by linguists of the Finu-
gRevita research group, parts of speech and annotation of the sources, i.e. the dictio-
naries that are contained within. In addition, information about their morphological
paradigm is also encoded, as well as the argument structure of certain verbs.

The online Mansi dictionary being a key resource for creating a morphological
analyzer, the project also aims to make it available for public use as well, thus meeting
a long-felt need for a sufficient Mansi–English–Mansi and a suitable online Mansi
dictionary. After some technical refinements, our online Mansi dictionary will be
made available on the Giellatekno website (http://giellatekno.uit.no).

We also plan to collate our dictionary with the data on the Northern Mansi dialect
group of Munkácsi’s enormous Mansi–Hungarian dictionary [2] – by relying on its
simplified transcipt by Béla K’almán – and also expand it with the NorthernMansima-
terial of Balandin’s and Vakhrusheva’s Mansi–Russian dictionary [7], as well as with
dozens of the most necessary neologisms describing different features of contempo-
rary lifestyle (such as the urban environment, oil mining or judicial terms), created
and used first and foremost by the journalists of the Mansi newspaper Luima Seripos
(see below).

2.2 Mansi Wordnet

Recently, another lexical resource has been constructed for Mansi: [8] report on the
construction of a wordnet for Mansi. Special challenges were met during the build-
ing process, among which the most important ones are the low number of native
speakers, the lack of thesauri and the bear language. The bear is a prominently sa-
cred animal venerated by Mansi, thus triggering a detailed taboo language. Since the
bear is thought to understand the human speech, it is required to use taboo words
while speaking about the bear, the parts of its body, or any activity connected with
the bear (especially bear hunting) so that the bear would not understand it. Thus vo-
cabulary items belonging to the bear language had to be separately indicated in the
Mansi wordnet, which currently contains about 300 synsets and is under constant

¹Note that the number of the entries exceeds the sum of the entries of the individual ditionaries. This
is due to synonyms and different senses of Mansi words, which were grouped under the same head entry
in the Russian–Mansi dictionary, but are now counted separately.

development. As for the proportion of part-of-speech categories, nouns prevail over
verbs with 210 nouns (70%) and 90 verbs.

3 Mansi Morphological Analyzers
Mansi is a morphologically rich language, similar to other Uralic languages. Thus,
its automatic morphological processing requires a properly designed morphological
analyzer. For Mansi, there already exists a morphological analyzer [9] developed by
MorphoLogic Ltd.². However, this has several issues that are problematic concerning
contemporary Mansi language use. First, it employs Latin-based transcription used
by scholars but the Mansi orthography used by the speakers themselves is Cyrillic-
based. Second, its vocabulary is based on Munkácsi’s Mansi dictionary [2] and it was
optimized for the texts covered in Kálmán’s Chrestomathia Vogulica [10] andWogulis-
che Texte [11], mostly collected at the end of the 19th and the first half of the 20th
century. Hence, the contemporary lexicon and genres of the 20th and 21st centuries
are underrepresented. Third, it is not open-source.

For all the above mentioned reasons, we chose to create a new morphological an-
alyzer for Mansi from scratch. From among the many currently available finite-state
tools, the HFST standard was chosen in order that the analyzer could be integrated
into the framework which is used at the GiellaTekno website. This choice is thus mo-
tivated by the fact that in this way, the morphological analyzer can be integrated into
a large system dealing with minority languages with a common interface. The files
in the morphological analyzer can be grouped into two categories: stems and affixes.
Mansi words (stems) are given in a lexicon, together with morphological information
and their Russian translations, in addition, there are morphological rules that are re-
sponsible for analyzing and generating different inflectional forms of the individual
stems. Furthermore, stems and affixes are organized into different files on the basis
of their part-of-speech category, since nouns are conjugated differently than verbs,
and the whole system is easier to modify and to look through.

The dictionary mentioned in Section 2.1 serves as a basis for the lexicon integrated
into the morphological analyzer. Nevertheless, the original paper-based dictionaries
were published decades ago, which means that the lexicon cannot contain contem-
porary terms of vocabulary (e.g. those related to internet and social media). Thus, it
is constantly expanded by adding novel lexical items in a semi-automatic way: the
analyzer is regularly run on contemporary texts and if some of the words cannot get
a proper morphological analysis, their stem is added to the lexicon.

Another issue with stems is that multiword items were extremely frequent in the
dictionaries. For example, the учитель ’schoolteacher masc.’ could be translated as
ня̄врамыт ханисьтан хум built up of the element children-teaching man , and the
feminine counterpart учительница ’schoolteacher fem.’ as ня̄врамыт ханисьтан
нэ̄ from children-teaching woman. However, the HFST formalism could not support
multiword items and they needed to be reduced to their syntactic head, in this case,
хум and нэ.̄

As for themorphological rules, lexical entries ofMansi were grouped into different
morphological categories depending on the inflectional paradigm they belong to. For
this, we relied on the descriptions found in several Mansi grammars [12, 13], as well
as on the linguistic intuitions of native speakers of Mansi.

In order to classify the Mansi stems into inflectional paradigms, we analyzed the
words’ phonological structure. First, we listed all the possible syllables that can occur
at the beginning of the word, at the end of the word, or within words. This was an
important step in establishing inflectional paradigms as in the case of nouns, it is the
last (two) syllable(s) that determine the quality of affixes and linking vowels, whereas
in the case of verbs, it is the number of syllables and the quality of the last syllable.
Then, inflectional paradigms were created for each type separately in order to be able
to analyze and generate all inflectional forms of Mansi nouns and verbs. Right now,
the system includes 36 nominal and 27 verbal paradigms.

Here we offer a short sample of the nominal stems and inflectional paradigms for
illustrative purposes. The first column denotes the stem and its inflectional stem. The
second column contains the inflectional paradigm it belongs to, e.g. N_CVS_masnut__n
means that it is a nominal paradigm for nouns that end in a combination of a vowel
and a softening consonant, a typical example of which is masnut ‘cloth’.

миркол:миркол N_CVS_masnut__n ”сельсовет” ;
ще̄мья:ще̄мья N_VO_maa__n ”семья” ;
нэ̄пак:нэ̄пак N_CVH_luw__n ”книга” ;
ӯльпа:ӯльпа N_VO_maa__n ”кедр” ;

Based on the above information, the following morphological analyses are pro-
vided by the system for the word ще̄мьят “families” or “in family”:

ще̄мьят ще̄мья+N+Pl+Nom
ще̄мьят ще̄мья+N+Sg+Loc

Beside parts-of-speech that can be inflected, the morphological analyzer also in-
cludes words belonging to parts-of-speech that cannot be inflected. For instance, ad-
verbs, conjunctions and interjections are also adequately recognized by the system.

Our Mansi morphological analyzer will be made freely available soon within the
Giellatekno infrastructure.

4 Mansi corpora
In order to test our morphological tools, we have started to create a Mansi corpus,
which consists of the articles published in the Mansi newspaper Luima Seripos (Mansi
for “Northern dawn”). The online archive of Luima Seripos is available on the home-
page of the joint editorial board of Luima Seripos and regional Khanty newspaper
Khanty Yasang.³. The Mansi texts published in Luima Seripos cover various topics

³http://www.khanty-yasang.ru/luima-seripos/archive

62



such as traditional lifestyle, folklore and short biographies, as well as domains of ur-
ban life.

Currently, the corpus contains issues of Luima Seripos from 2013 (more precisely,
issues 1050-1131). The corpus consists of 520,000 tokens, converted into XML format.
Cyrillic characters with diacritics, i.e. those that denote vowel length were segmented
into two characters: the vowel itself and the macron, which enables a proper display
of the Unicode characters (the original website is sometimes inadequaly displayed on
certain machines or browsers). We have been constantly working on the extension of
the corpus and we are planning to add about 150,000 tokens to it.

The following metadata are also assigned to the texts of the corpus: number of
issue, date of publication, author of the article, title of the article, link to the article and
a unique identifier for each article within the corpus. Also, the XML file applies special
tags for named entities such as person names and locations as well as embedded texts
written in Russian.

As work in progress, we would like to mention that about 5,000 tokens of the
corpus are being manually annotated for part-of-speech tags and syntactic structures
so that later on we can test and evaluate our morphological analyzer and POS tagger
under development.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we offered an overview of language technology tools and resources (be-
ing) developed for Mansi. Online dictionaries, morphological analyzers and a corpus
are already available (or will be made available soon) for the language, however, there
is still room for improvement. In addition to the constant update and extension of the
above mentioned tools, we intend to create a small dependency treebank of Mansi in
harmony with the Universal Dependencies project [14], which may enhance the im-
plementation of a syntactic parser for Mansi. To reach the widest possible range of ac-
tive users we consider the opportunity of creating online games based on the already
existing computational tools. For the Mansi language users and language learners we
plan to produce online games activating the users knowledge on Mansi vocabulary.
We intend to make all of our resources and tools freely available to anyone interested.

The majority of the future Mansi audience of computational language tools, such
as children, teenagers and young adults were raised in multiethnic families and mul-
ticulticultural settlements, most of the cases in towns and cities. Only 0.72% of the
total population of the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug belongs to Mansi ethnic-
ity, this proportion occasionally may be higher in cities, as for example in the capital
of the Okrug, Khanty–Mansiysk (1.5%). This condition together with the weakening

intergenerational transmission of the language and the just gradually changing edu-
cational system make the situation of Mansi vulnerable. The young Mansi language
users and language learners are familiar with the newest technological developments,
in general they have internet access and use the social media as well, most of them
got acquainted with computational language teaching tools as well in alternative ed-
ucational institutions [15]. Thus, besides their scientific and academic novelty, the
creation of computational tools for the Mansi language is crucial for the benefit of the
language learners and language users as well.
