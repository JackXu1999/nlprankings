Abstract

Recent work in Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) has shown significant quality gains
from noised-beam decoding during back-
translation, a method to generate synthetic par-
allel data. We show that the main role of such
synthetic noise is not to diversify the source
side, as previously suggested, but simply to
indicate to the model that the given source is
synthetic. We propose a simpler alternative
to noising techniques, consisting of tagging
back-translated source sentences with an ex-
tra token. Our results on WMT outperform
noised back-translation in English-Romanian
and match performance on English-German,
re-defining state-of-the-art in the former.

1 Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made
considerable progress in recent years (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al.,
2017). Traditional NMT has relied solely on par-
allel sentence pairs for training data, which can
be an expensive and scarce resource. This moti-
vates the use of monolingual data, usually more
abundant (Lambert et al., 2011). Approaches
using monolingual data for machine translation
include language model fusion for both phrase-
based (Brants et al., 2007; Koehn, 2009) and
neural MT (Gülçehre et al., 2015, 2017), back-
translation (Sennrich et al., 2016; Poncelas et al.,
2018), unsupervised machine translation (Lample
et al., 2018a; Artetxe et al., 2018), dual learning
(Cheng et al., 2016; Di He and Ma, 2016; Xia
et al., 2017), and multi-task learning (Domhan and
Hieber, 2017).

We focus on back-translation (BT), which, de-
spite its simplicity, has thus far been the most
effective technique (Sennrich et al., 2017; Ha
et al., 2017; Garcı́a-Martı́nez et al., 2017). Back-
translation entails training an intermediate target-

to-source model on genuine bitext, and using this
model to translate a large monolingual corpus
from the target into the source language. This al-
lows training a source-to-target model on a mix-
ture of genuine parallel data and synthetic pairs
from back-translation.

We build upon Edunov et al. (2018) and Ima-
mura et al. (2018), who investigate BT at the
scale of hundreds of millions of sentences. Their
work studies different decoding/generation meth-
ods for back-translation: in addition to regular
beam search, they consider sampling and adding
noise to the one-best hypothesis produced by beam
search. They show that sampled BT and noised-
beam BT significantly outperform standard BT,
and attribute this success to increased source-side
diversity (sections 5.2 and 4.4).

Our work investigates noised-beam BT
(NoisedBT) and questions the role noise is play-
ing. Rather than increasing source diversity, our
work instead suggests that the performance gains
come simply from signaling to the model that the
source side is back-translated, allowing it to treat
the synthetic parallel data differently than the
natural bitext. We hypothesize that BT introduces
both helpful signal (strong target-language signal
and weak cross-lingual signal) and harmful signal
(amplifying the biases of machine translation).
Indicating to the model whether a given training
sentence is back-translated should allow the
model to separate the helpful and harmful signal.

To support this hypothesis, we first demon-
strate that the permutation and word-dropping
noise used by Edunov et al. (2018) do not im-
prove or significantly degrade NMT accuracy,
corroborating that noise might act as an indi-
cator that the source is back-translated, with-
out much loss in mutual information between
the source and target. We then train models
on WMT English-German (EnDe) without BT

noise, and instead explicitly tag the synthetic data
with a reserved token. We call this technique
“Tagged Back-Translation” (TaggedBT). These
models achieve equal to slightly higher perfor-
mance than the noised variants. We repeat
these experiments with WMT English-Romanian
(EnRo), where NoisedBT underperforms standard
BT and TaggedBT improves over both techniques.
We demonstrate that TaggedBT also allows for
effective iterative back-translation with EnRo, a
technique which saw quality losses when applied
with standard back-translation.

To further our understanding of TaggedBT, we
investigate the biases encoded in models by com-
paring the entropy of their attention matrices, and
look at the attention weight on the tag. We con-
clude by investigating the effects of the back-
translation tag at decoding time.

2 Related Work

This section describes prior work exploiting
target-side monolingual data and discusses related
work tagging NMT training data.

2.1 Leveraging Monolingual Data for NMT

Monolingual data can provide valuable informa-
tion to improve translation quality. Various meth-
ods for using target-side LMs have proven effec-
tive for NMT (He et al., 2016; Gülçehre et al.,
2017), but have tended to be less successful than
back-translation – for example, Gülçehre et al.
(2017) report under +0.5 BLEU over their base-
line on EnDe newstest14, whereas Edunov et al.
(2018) report over +4.0 BLEU on the same test
set. Furthermore, there is no straighforward way
to incorporate source-side monolingual data into a
neural system with a LM.

Back-translation was originally introduced for
phrase-based systems (Bertoldi and Federico,
2009; Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011), but flourished
in NMT after work by Sennrich et al. (2016). Sev-
eral approaches have looked into iterative forward-
and BT experiments (using source-side mono-
lingual data), including Cotterell and Kreutzer
(2018), Vu Cong Duy Hoang and Cohn (2018),
and Niu et al. (2018). Recently, iterative back-
translation in both directions has been devised has
a way to address unsupervised machine transla-
tion (Lample et al., 2018b; Artetxe et al., 2018).

Recent work has focused on the importance
of diversity and complexity in synthetic training

data. Fadaee and Monz (2018) find that BT ben-
efits difficult-to-translate words the most, and se-
lect from the back-translated corpus by oversam-
pling words with high prediction loss. Imamura
et al. (2018) argue that in order for BT to en-
hance the encoder, it must have a more diverse
source side, and sample several back-translated
source sentences for each monolingual target sen-
tence. Our work follows most closely Edunov
et al. (2018), who investigate alternative decoding
schemes for BT. Like Imamura et al. (2018), they
argue that BT through beam or greedy decoding
leads to an overly regular domain on the source
side, which poorly represents the diverse distribu-
tion of natural text.

Beyond the scope of this work, we briefly men-
tion alternative techniques leveraging monolin-
gual data, like forward translation (Ueffing et al.,
2007; Kim and Rush, 2016), or source copy-
ing (Currey et al., 2017).

2.2 Training Data Tagging for NMT

Tags have been used for various purposes in NMT.
Tags on the source sentence can indicate the target
language in multi-lingual models (Johnson et al.,
2016). Yamagishi et al. (2016) use tags in a sim-
ilar fashion to control the formality of a transla-
tion from English to Japanese. Kuczmarski and
Johnson (2018) use tags to control gender in trans-
lation. Most relevant to our work, Kobus et al.
(2016) use tags to mark source sentence domain
in a multi-domain setting.

3 Experimental Setup

This section presents our datasets, evaluation pro-
tocols and model architectures. It also describes
our back-translation procedure, as well as noising
and tagging strategies.

3.1 Data

We perform our experiments on WMT18 EnDe bi-
text, WMT16 EnRo bitext, and WMT15 EnFr bi-
text respectively. We use WMT Newscrawl for
monolingual data (2007-2017 for De, 2016 for
Ro, 2007-2013 for En, and 2007-2014 for Fr).
For bitext, we filter out empty sentences and sen-
tences longer than 250 subwords. We remove pairs
whose whitespace-tokenized length ratio is greater
than 2. This results in about 5.0M pairs for EnDe,
and 0.6M pairs for EnRo. We do not filter the EnFr
bitext, resulting in 41M sentence pairs.



55

For monolingual data, we deduplicate and filter
sentences with more than 70 tokens or 500 char-
acters. Furthermore, after back-translation, we re-
move any sentence pairs where the back-translated
source is longer than 75 tokens or 550 characters.
This results in 216.5M sentences for EnDe, 2.2M
for EnRo, 149.9M for RoEn, and 39M for EnFr.
For monolingual data, all tokens are defined by
whitespace tokenization, not wordpieces.

The DeEn model used to generate BT data has
28.6 SacreBLEU on newstest12, the RoEn model
used for BT has a test SacreBLEU of 31.9 (see Ta-
ble 4.b), and the FrEn model used to generate the
BT data has 39.2 SacreBLEU on newstest14.

3.2 Evaluation

We rely on BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) as
our evaluation metric.

While well established, any slight difference in
post-processing and BLEU computation can have a
dramatic impact on output values (Post, 2018). For
example, Lample and Conneau (2019) report 33.3
BLEU on EnRo using unsupervised NMT, which
at first seems comparable to our reported 33.4
SacreBLEU from iterative TaggedBT. However,
when we use their preprocessing scripts and eval-
uation protocol, our system achieves 39.2 BLEU
on the same data, which is close to 6 points higher
than the same model evaluated by SacreBLEU.

We therefore report strictly SacreBLEU1, using
the reference implementation from Post (2018),
which aims to standardize BLEU evaluation.

3.3 Architecture

We use the transformer-base and transformer-big
architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) implemented
in lingvo (Shen et al., 2019). Transformer-base
is used for the bitext noising experiments and the
EnRo experiments, whereas the transformer-big is
used for the EnDe tasks with BT. Both use a vo-
cabulary of 32k subword units. As an alterna-
tive to the checkpoint averaging used in Edunov
et al. (2018), we train with exponentially weighted
moving average (EMA) decay with weight decay
parameter α = 0.999 (Buduma and Locascio,
2017).

Transformer-base models are trained on 16
GPUs with synchronous gradient updates and per-
gpu-batch-size of 4,096 tokens, for an effective

1BLEU + case.mixed + lang.LANGUAGE PAIR + num-
refs.1 + smooth.exp + test.SET + tok.13a + version.1.2.15

batch size of 64k tokens/step. Training lasts 400k
steps, passing over 24B tokens. For the final EnDe
TaggedBT model, we train transformer-big simi-
larly but on 128 GPUs, for an effective batch size
of 512k tokens/step. A training run of 300M steps
therefore sees about 150B tokens. We pick check-
points with newstest2012 for EnDe and news-
dev2016 for EnRo.

3.4 Noising

We focused on noised beam BT, the most effec-
tive noising approach according to Edunov et al.
(2018). Before training, we noised the decoded
data (Lample et al., 2018a) by applying 10% word-
dropout, 10% word blanking, and a 3-constrained
permutation (a permutation such that no token
moves further than 3 tokens from its original
position). We refer to data generated this way
as NoisedBT. Additionally, we experiment using
only the 3-constrained permutation and no word
dropout/blanking, which we abbreviate as P3BT.

3.5 Tagging

We tag our BT training data by prepending a
reserved token to the input sequence, which is
then treated in the same way as any other to-
ken. We also experiment with both noising and
tagging together, which we call Tagged Noised
Back-Translation, or TaggedNoisedBT. This con-
sists simply of prepending the <BT> tag to each
noised training example.

An example training sentence for each of these
set-ups can be seen in Table 1. We do not tag
the bitext, and always train on a mix of back-
translated data and (untagged) bitext unless explic-
itly stated otherwise.

Noise type Example sentence
[no noise] Raise the child, love the child.
P3BT child Raise the, love child the.
NoisedBT Raise child love child, the.
TaggedBT <BT> Raise the child, love the child.
TaggedNoisedBT <BT> Raise, the child the love.

ined in this paper

4 Results

This section studies the impact of training data
noise on translation quality, and then presents our
results with TaggedBT on EnDe and EnRo.



56

4.1 Noising Parallel Bitext
We first show that noising EnDe bitext sources
does not seriously impact the translation quality
of the transformer-base baseline. For each sen-
tence pair in the corpus, we flip a coin and noise
the source sentence with probability p. We then
train a model from scratch on this partially noised
dataset. Table 2 shows results for various values
of p. Specifically, it presents the somewhat unex-
pected finding that even when noising 100% of the
source bitext (so the model has never seen well-
formed English), BLEU on well-formed test data
only drops by 2.5.

This result prompts the following line of rea-
soning about the role of noise in BT: (i) By itself,
noising does not add meaningful signal (or else
it would improve performance); (ii) It also does
not damage the signal much; (iii) In the context of
back-translation, the noise could therefore signal
whether a sentence were back-translated, without
significantly degrading performance.

4.2 Tagged Back-Translation for EnDe
We compare the results of training on a mix-
ture of bitext and a random sample of 24M back-
translated sentences in Table 3.a, for the various
set-ups of BT described in sections 3.4 and 3.5.
Like Edunov et al. (2018), we confirm that BT
improves over bitext alone, and noised BT im-
proves over standard BT by about the same mar-
gin. All methods of marking the source text as
back-translated (NoisedBT, P3BT, TaggedBT, and
TaggedNoisedBT) perform about equally, with
TaggedBT having the highest average BLEU by
a small margin. Tagging and noising together
(TaggedNoisedBT) does not improve over either
tagging or noising alone, supporting the conclu-
sion that tagging and noising are not orthogonal
signals but rather different means to the same end.

Table 3.b verifies our result at scale applying
TaggedBT on the full BT dataset (216.5M sen-
tences), upsampling the bitext so that each batch
contains an expected 20% of bitext. As in the

smaller scenario, TaggedBT matches or slightly
out-performs NoisedBT, with an advantage on
seven test-sets and a disadvantage on one. We
also compare our results to the best-performing
model from Edunov et al. (2018). Our model
is on par with or slightly superior to their re-
sult2, out-performing it on four test sets and under-
performing it on two, with the largest advantage on
Newstest2018 (+1.4 BLEU).

As a supplementary experiment, we consider
training only on BT data, with no bitext. We
compare this to training only on NoisedBT data.
If noising in fact increases the quality or diver-
sity of the data, one would expect the NoisedBT
data to yield higher performance than training on
unaltered BT data, when in fact it has about 1
BLEU lower performance (Table 3.a, “BT alone”
and “NoisedBT alone”).

We also compare NoisedBT versus Tagged-
NoisedBT in a set-up where the bitext itself is
noised. In this scenario, the noise can no longer
be used by the model as an implicit tag to dif-
ferentiate between bitext and synthetic BT data,
so we expect the TaggedNoisedBT variant to per-
form better than NoisedBT by a similar mar-
gin to NoisedBT’s improvement over BT in the
unnoised-bitext setting. The last sub-section of Ta-
ble 3.a confirms this.

4.3 Tagged Back-Translation for EnRo

We repeat these experiments for WMT EnRo (Ta-
ble 4). This is a much lower-resource task than
EnDe, and thus can benefit more from mono-
lingual data. In this case, NoisedBT is actu-
ally harmful, lagging standard BT by -0.6 BLEU.
TaggedBT closes this gap and passes standard BT
by +0.4 BLEU, for a total gain of +1.0 BLEU over
NoisedBT.

4.4 Tagged Back-Translation for EnFr

We performed a minimal set of experiments on
WMT EnFr, which are summarized in Table 5.
This is a much higher-resource language pair than
either EnRo or EnDe, but Edunov et al. (2018)
demonstrate that noised BT (using sampling) can
still help in this set-up. In this case, we see that BT
alone hurts performance compared to the strong
bitext baseline, but NoisedBT indeed surpasses the
bitext model. TaggedBT out-performs all other

methods, beating NoisedBT by an average of +0.3
BLEU over all test sets.

It is worth noting that our numbers are lower
than those reported by Edunov et al. (2018) on the
years they report (36.1, 43.8, and 40.9 on 2013,
2014, and 2015 respectively). We did not inves-
tigate this result. We suspect that this is an er-
ror/inoptimlaity in our set-up, as we did not op-
timize these models, and ran only one experiment
for each of the four set-ups. Alternately, sampling
could outperform noising in the large-data regime.

4.5 Iterative Tagged Back-Translation

We further investigate the effects of TaggedBT
by performing one round of iterative back-
translation (Cotterell and Kreutzer, 2018; Vu Cong
Duy Hoang and Cohn, 2018; Niu et al., 2018),
and find another difference between the different
varieties of BT: NoisedBT and TaggedBT allow
the model to bootstrap improvements from an im-
proved reverse model, whereas standard BT does
not. This is consistent with our argument that data
tagging allows the model to extract information
out of each data set more effectively.

For the purposes of this paper we call a
model trained with standard back-translation
an Iteration-1 BT model, where the back-
translations were generated by a model
trained only on bitext. We inductively de-
fine the Iteration-k BT model as that model
which is trained on BT data generated by an
Iteration-(k-1) BT model, for k > 1. Unless
otherwise specified, any BT model mentioned in
this paper is an Iteration-1 BT model.

We perform these experiments on the English-
Romanian dataset, which is smaller and thus better
suited for this computationally expensive process.
We used the (Iteration-1) TaggedBT model to gen-
erate the RoEn back-translated training data. Us-
ing this we trained a superior RoEn model, mix-
ing 80% BT data with 20% bitext. Using this
Iteration-2 RoEn model, we generated new EnRo
BT data, which we used to train the Iteration-3
EnRo models. SacreBLEU scores for all these
models are displayed in Table 4.

Table 5: Results on WMT15 EnFr, with bitext, BT, NoisedBT, and TaggedBT.

We find that the iteration-3 BT models im-
prove over their Iteration-1 counterparts only
for NoisedBT (+1.0 BLEU, dev+test avg) and
TaggedBT (+0.7 BLEU, dev+test avg), whereas
the Iteration-3 BT model shows no improve-
ment over its Iteration-1 counterpart (-0.1 BLEU,
dev+test avg). In other words, both techniques that
(explicitly or implicitly) tag synthetic data bene-
fit from iterative BT. We speculate that this sep-
aration of the synthetic and natural domains al-
lows the model to bootstrap more effectively from
the increasing quality of the back-translated data
while not being damaged by its quality issues,
whereas the simple BT model cannot make this
distinction, and is equally “confused” by the bi-
ases in higher or lower-quality BT data.

An identical experiment with EnDe did not see
either gains or losses in BLEU from iteration-
3 TaggedBT. This is likely because there is less
room to bootstrap with the larger-capacity model.
This said, we do not wish to read too deeply into
these results, as the effect size is not large, and nei-
ther is the number of experiments. A more thor-
ough suite of experiments is warranted before any
strong conclusions can be made on the implica-
tions of tagging on iterative BT.

5 Analysis

In an attempt to gain further insight into TaggedBT
as it compares with standard BT or NoisedBT, we
examine attention matrices in the presence of the
back translation tag and measure the impact of the
tag at decoding time.

5.1 Attention Entropy and Sink-Ratio

To understand how the model treats the tag and
what biases it learns from the data, we investigate
the entropy of the attention probability distribu-
tion, as well as the attention captured by the tag.

We examine decoder attention (at the top layer)
on the first source token. We define Attention Sink
Ratio for index j (ASRj) as the averaged attention
over the jth token, normalized by uniform atten-

tion, i.e.

ASRj(x, ŷ) =
1

|ŷ|

|ŷ|∑
i=1

αij
α̃

where αij is the attention value for target token i in
hypothesis ŷ over source token j and α̃ = 1|x| cor-
responds to uniform attention. We examine ASR
on text that has been noised and/or tagged (de-
pending on the model), to understand how BT sen-
tences are treated during training. For the tagged
variants, there is heavy attention on the tag when
it is present (Table 6), indicating that the model
relies on the information signalled by the tag.

Our second analysis probes word-for-word
translation bias through the average source-token
entropy of the attention probability model when
decoding natural text. Table 6 reports the average
length-normalized Shannon entropy:

H̃(x, ŷ) = − 1
|ŷ|

|ŷ|∑
i=1

1

log |x|

|x|∑
j=1

αij log(αij)

The entropy of the attention probabilities from the
model trained on BT data is the clear outlier. This
low entropy corresponds to a concentrated atten-
tion matrix, which we observed to be concentrated
on the diagonal (See Figure 1a and 1d). This could
indicate the presence of word-by-word translation,
a consequence of the harmful part of the signal
from back-translated data. The entropy on paral-
lel data from the NoisedBT model is much higher,
corresponding to more diffuse attention, which we
see in Figure 1b and 1e. In other words, the word-
for-word translation biases in BT data, that were
incorporated into the BT model, have been man-
ually undone by the noise, so the model’s under-
standing of how to decode parallel text is not cor-
rupted. We see that TaggedBT leads to a similarly
high entropy, indicating the model has learnt this
without needing to manually “break” the literal-
translation bias. As a sanity check, we see that the
entropy of the P3BT model’s attention is also high,
but is lower than that of the NoisedBT model, be-
cause P3 noise is less destructive. The one sur-

NoisedBT (row 2), and TaggedBT (row 3), for both EnDe (col 1) and EnRo (col 2). Note the heavy attention on
the tag (position 0 in row 3), and the diffuse attention map learned by the NoiseBT models. These are the models
from Table 3.a

prising entry on this table is probably the low en-
tropy of the TaggedNoisedBT. Our best explana-
tion is that TaggedNoisedBT puts disproportion-
ately high attention on the sentence-end token,
with 1.4x the ASR|x| that TaggedBT has, naturally
leading to lower entropy.

For ASR, data is treated as if it were BT (noised and/or
tagged, resp.), whereas for entropy the natural text is
used. Outliers discussed in the text are bolded.

5.2 Decoding with and without a tag

In this section we look at what happens when
we decode with a model on newstest data as if
it were back-translated. This means that for the
TaggedBT model we tag the true source, and for
the NoisedBT model, we noise the true source.
These “as-if-BT” decodings contrast with “stan-
dard decode”, or decoding with the true source.
An example sentence from newstest2015 is shown
in Table 8, decoded by both models both in the
standard fashion and in the “as-if-BT” fashion.
The BLEU scores of each decoding method are
presented in Table 7.

The noised decode – decoding newstest sen-
tences with the NoisedBT model after noising the
source – yields poor performance. This is unsur-
prising given the severity of the noise model used
(recall Table 1). The tagged decode, however,
yields only somewhat lower performance than the
standard decode on the same model (-2.9BLEU on
average). There are no clear reasons for this qual-

Table 8: Example decodes from newstest2015 for decoding in standard and “as-if-BT” varieties. Here, NoisedBT
and TaggedBT produce equivalent outputs with standard decoding; TaggedBT produces less natural output with
tagged input; and NoisedBT produces a low-quality output with noised input.

ity drop – the model correctly omits the tag in the
outputs, but simply produces slightly lower qual-
ity hypotheses. The only noticeable difference in
decoding outputs between the two systems is that
the tagged decoding produces about double the
quantity of English outputs (2.7% vs. 1.2%, over
newstest2010-newstest2017, using a language ID
classifier).

That the tagged-decode BLEU is still quite
reasonable tells us that the model has not sim-
ply learned to ignore the source sentence when
it encounters the input tag, suggesting that the
p(y|BT(x)) signal is still useful to the model, as
Sennrich et al. (2016) also demonstrated. The tag
might then be functioning as a domain tag, causing
the model to emulate the domain of the BT data –
including both the desirable target-side news do-
main and the MT biases inherent in BT data.

To poke at the intuition that the quality drop
comes in part from emulating the NMT biases in
the synthetic training data, we probe a particu-
lar shortcoming of NMT: copy rate. We quantify
the copy rate with the unigram overlap between
source and target as a percentage of tokens in the
target side, and compare those statistics to the bi-
text and the back-translated data (Table 9). We
notice that the increase in unigram overlap with
the tagged decode corresponds to the increased
copy rate for the back-translated data (reaching
the same value of 11%), supporting the hypothesis
that the tag helps the model separate the domain of
the parallel versus the back-translated data. Under
this lens, quality gains from TaggedBT/NoisedBT
could be re-framed as transfer learning from a

multi-task set-up, where one task is to translate
simpler “translationese” (Gellerstam, 1986; Fre-
itag et al., 2019) source text, and the other is to
translate true bitext.

Data src-tgt unigram overlap
TaggedBT (standard decode) 8.9%
TaggedBT (tagged decode) 10.7%
Bitext 5.9%
BT Data 11.4 %

data with decoding newstest as if it were bitext or BT
data. Model decodes are averaged over newstest2010-
newstest2017.

6 Negative Results

In addition to tagged back-translation, we tried
several tagging-related experiments that did not
work as well. We experimented with tagged
forward-translation (TaggedFT), and found that
the tag made no substantial difference, often lag-
ging behind untagged forward-translation (FT)
by a small margin (∼ 0.2 BLEU). For EnDe,
(Tagged)FT underperformed the bitext baseline;
for EnRo, (Tagged)FT performed about the same
as BT. Combining BT and FT had additive effects,
yielding results slightly higher than iteration-3
TaggedBT (Table 4), at 33.9 SacreBLEU on test;
but tagging did not help in this set-up. We fur-
thermore experimented with year-specific tags on
the BT data, using a different tag for each of
the ten years of newscrawl. The model trained
on these data performed identically to the nor-
mal TaggedBT model. Using this model we repli-



61

cated the “as-if-bt” experiments from Table 8 us-
ing year-specific tags, and although there was a
slight correlation between year tag and that year’s
dataset, the standard-decode still resulted in the
highest BLEU.

7 Conclusion

In this work we develop TaggedBT, a novel tech-
nique for using back-translation in the context of
NMT, which improves over the current state-of-
the-art method of Noised Back-Translation, while
also being simpler and more robust. We demon-
strate that while Noised Back-Translation and
standard Back-Translation are more or less effec-
tive depending on the task (low-resource, mid-
resource, iterative BT), TaggedBT performs well
on all tasks.

On WMT16 EnRo, TaggedBT improves on
vanilla BT by 0.4 BLEU. Our best BLEU score
of 33.4 BLEU, obtained using Iterative TaggedBT,
shows a gain of +3.5 BLEU over the highest previ-
ously published result on this test-set that we are
aware of. We furthermore match or out-perform
the highest published results we are aware of on
WMT EnDe that use only back-translation, with
higher or equal BLEU on five of seven test sets.

In addition, we conclude that noising in the con-
text of back-translation acts merely as an indicator
to the model that the source is back-translated, al-
lowing the model to treat it as a different domain
and separate the helpful signal from the harmful
signal. We support this hypothesis with experi-
mental results showing that heuristic noising tech-
niques like those discussed here, although they
produce text that may seem like a nigh unintelli-
gible mangling to humans, have a relatively small
impact on the cross-lingual signal. Our analysis
of attention and tagged decoding provides further
supporting evidence for these conclusions.

8 Future Work

A natural extension of this work is to investi-
gate a more fine-grained application of tags to
both natural and synthetic data, for both back-
translation and forward-translation, using quality
and domain tags as well as synth-data tags. Sim-
ilarly, tagging could be investigated as an alter-
native to data selection, as in van der Wees et al.
(2017); Axelrod et al. (2011), or curriculum learn-
ing approaches like fine-tuning on in-domain data
(Thompson et al., 2018; Hassan Sajjad and Nadir

Durrani and Fahim Dalvi and Yonatan Belinkov
and Stephan Vogel, 2017; Freitag and Al-Onaizan,
2016). Finally, the token-tagging method should
be contrasted with more sophisticated versions of
tagging, like concatenating a trainable domain em-
bedding with all token embeddings, as in Kobus
et al. (2016).
