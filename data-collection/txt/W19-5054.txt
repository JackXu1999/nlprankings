Abstract

Recent advances in distributed language mod-
eling have led to large performance increases
on a variety of natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. However, it is not well under-
stood how these methods may be augmented
by knowledge-based approaches. This pa-
per compares the performance and internal
representation of an Enhanced Sequential In-
ference Model (ESIM) between three experi-
mental conditions based on the representation
method: Bidirectional Encoder Representa-
tions from Transformers (BERT), Embeddings
of Semantic Predications (ESP), or Cui2Vec.
The methods were evaluated on the Medical
Natural Language Inference (MedNLI) sub-
task of the MEDIQA 2019 shared task. This
task relied heavily on semantic understanding
and thus served as a suitable evaluation set for
the comparison of these representation meth-
ods.

1 Introduction

This paper describes our approach to the Nat-
ural Language Inference (NLI) subtask of the
MEDIQA 2019 shared task (Ben Abacha et al.,
2019). As it is not yet clear the extent to
which knowledge-based embeddings may provide
task-specific improvement over recent advances
in contextual embeddings, we provide an anal-
ysis of the differences in performance between
these two methods. Additionally, it is not yet
clear from the literature the extent to which in-
formation stored in contextual embeddings over-
laps with that in knowledge-based embeddings for
which we provide a preliminary analysis of the at-
tention weights of models that use these two rep-
resentation methods as input. We compare BERT
fine-tuned to MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016) and
PubMed to Embeddings of Semantic Predications
(ESP) trained on SemMedDB and a baseline that

uses Cui2Vec embeddings trained on clinical and
biomedical text.

Two recent advances in the unsupervised mod-
eling of natural language, Embeddings of Lan-
guage Models (ELMo) (Peters et al., 2018)
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al., 2018), have
led to drastic improvements across a variety of
shared tasks. Both of these methods use transfer
learning, a method whereby a multi-layered lan-
guage model is first trained on a large unlabeled
corpus. The weights of the model are then frozen
and used as input to a task specific model (Peters
et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019).
This method is particularly well-suited for work
in the medical domain where datasets tend to be
relatively small due to the high cost of expert an-
notation.

However, whereas clinical free-text is difficult
to access and share in bulk due to privacy con-
cerns, the biomedical domain is characterized by
a significant amount of manually-curated struc-
tured knowledge bases. The BioPortal reposi-
tory currently hosts 773 different biomedical on-
tologies comprised of over 9.4 million classes.
SemMedDB is a triple store that consists of over
94 million predications extracted from PubMed
by SemRep, a semantic parser for biomedical text
(Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003; Kilicoglu et al.,
2012). These available resources make a strong
case for the evaluation of knowledge-based meth-
ods for the Medical Natural Language Inference
(MedNLI) task (Romanov and Shivade, 2018).

2 Related Work

In this section, we provide a brief overview of
methods for distributional and frame-based se-
mantic representation of natural language. For a
more detailed synthesis, we refer the reader to the



501

review of Vector Space Models (VSMs) by Turney
and Pantel (2010).

2.1 Distributional Semantics

The distributed representation of words has a
long history in computational linguistics, begin-
ning with latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deer-
wester et al., 1990; Hofmann, 1999; Kanerva et al.,
2000), maximum entropy methods (Berger et al.,
1996), and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei
et al., 2003). More recently, neural network meth-
ods have been applied to model natural language
(Bengio et al., 2003; Weston et al., 2008; Turian
et al., 2010). These methods have been broadly
applied as a method of improving supervised
model performance by learning word-level fea-
tures from large unlabeled datasets with more re-
cent work using either Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013; Pavlopoulos et al., 2014) or GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) embeddings. Recent work
has learned a continuous representation of Uni-
fied Medical Language System (UMLS) (Aron-
son, 2006) concepts by applying the Word2Vec
method to a large corpus of insurance claims, clin-
ical notes, and biomedical text where UMLS con-
cepts were replaced with their Concept Unique
Identifiers (CUIs) (Beam et al., 2018).

Models that incorporate sub-word information
are particularly useful in the medical domain
for representing medical terminology and out-of-
vocabulary terms common in clinical notes and
consumer health questions (Romanov and Shiv-
ade, 2018). Most approaches use a temporal con-
volution over a sliding window of characters and
have been shown to improve performance on a va-
riety of tasks (Kim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015;
Seo et al., 2016; Bojanowski et al., 2017).

Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo)
computes word representations using a bidirec-
tional language model that consist of a character-
level embedding layer followed by a deep bidirec-
tional long short-term memory (LSTM) network
(Peters et al., 2018). Bidirectional Encoder Rep-
resentations from Transformers (BERT) replaces
the each forward and backward LSTMs with a sin-
gle Transformer that simultaneously computes at-
tention in both the forward and backward direc-
tions and is regarded as the current state-of-the-
art method for language representation (Vaswani
et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018). This method ad-
ditionally substitutes two new unsupervised train-

ing objectives in place of the classical language
models, i.e., masked language modeling (MLM)
and next sentence prediction (NSP). In the case of
MLM, a percentage of the words in the corpus are
replaced by a [MASK] token. The task is then for
the system to predict the masked token. For NSP,
the task is given two sentences, s1 and s2, from
a document to determine whether s2 is the next
sentence following s1.

While ELMo has been shown to outperform
GloVe and Word2Vec on consumer health ques-
tion answering (Kearns and Thomas, 2018), BERT
has outperformed ELMo on various clinical tasks
(Si et al., 2019) and has been fine-tuned and ap-
plied to the biomedical literature and clinical notes
(Alsentzer et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Si et al.,
2019; Lee et al., 2019). BERT supports the trans-
fer of a pretrained general purpose language model
to a task-specific application through fine-tuning.
The next sentence prediction objective in the pre-
training process suggests this method would be in-
herently suitable for NLI. In addition, BERT uti-
lizes character-based and WordPiece tokenization
(Wu et al., 2016) to learn the morphological pat-
terns among inflections. The subword segmen-
tation such as ##nea in the word dyspnea makes
it capable to understand the context of an out-of-
vocabulary word making it a particularly suitable
representation for clinical text.

2.2 Frame-based Semantics

FrameNet is a database of sentence-level frame-
based semantics that proposes human understand-
ing of natural language is the result of frames
in which certain roles are expected to be filled
(Baker et al., 1998). For example, the predicate
“replace” has at least two such roles, the thing
being replaced and the new object. A sentence
such as “The table was replaced.” raises the ques-
tion “With what was the table replaced?”. Frame-
based semantics is a popular approach for seman-
tic role labeling (SRL) (Swayamdipta et al., 2018),
question answering (QA) (Shen and Lapata, 2007;
Roberts and Demner-fushman, 2016; He, 2015;
Michael et al., 2018), and dialog systems (Larsson
and Traum, 2000; Gupta et al., 2018).

Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) are an ap-
proach that seeks to represent semantic predi-
cations by applying binding operators that de-
fine a directional transformation between entities
(Levy and Gayler, 2008). Early approaches in-



502

cluded binary spatter code (BSC) for encoding
structured knowledge (Kanerva, 1996, 1997) and
Holographic Embeddings that used circular con-
volution as a binding operator to improve the
scalability of this approach to large knowledge
graphs (Plate, 1995). The resurgence of neu-
ral network methods has focused attention on ex-
tending these methods as there is a growing in-
terest in leveraging continuous representations of
structured knowledge to improve performance on
downstream applications.

Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) are one
approach that represents entities and their relation-
ships as continuous vectors that are learned using
TransE/R (Bordes and Weston, 2009), RESCAL
(Nickel et al., 2011), or Holographic Embeddings
(Plate, 1995; Nickel et al., 2015). Stanovsky et.
al (2017) showed that RESCAL embeddings pre-
trained on DbPedia improved performance on the
task of adverse drug reaction labeling over a clini-
cal Word2Vec model. RESCAL uses tensor prod-
ucts whose application to representation learning
dates back to Smolensky (1986; 1990) that used
the inner product and has recently been applied
to the bAbI dataset (Smolensky et al., 2016; We-
ston et al., 2016). Embeddings of Semantic Pred-
ications (ESP) are a neural-probabilistic repre-
sentational approach that uses VSA binding op-
erations to encode structured relationships (Co-
hen and Widdows, 2017). The Embeddings Aug-
mented by Random Permutations (EARP) used in
this paper are a modified ESP approach that ap-
plies random permutations to the entity vectors
during training and were shown to improve per-
formance on the Bigger Analogy Test Set by up to
8% against a fastText baseline (Cohen and Wid-
dows, 2018).

3 Methods

In this section, we provide details on the three rep-
resentation methods used in this study, i.e. BERT,
Cui2Vec, and ESP. We continue with a description
of the inference model used in each experiment
to predict the label for a given hypothesis/premise
pair.

3.1 Representation Layer

There are many publicly available biomedical
BERT embeddings which were initialized from
the original BERT Base models. BioBERT was
trained on PubMed Abstracts and PubMed Central

Full-text articles (Lee et al., 2019). In this study,
we applied ClinicalBERT that was initialized from
BioBERT and subsequently trained on all MIMIC-
III notes (Alsentzer et al., 2019).

For Cui2Vec, we used the publicly available im-
plementation from Beam et al. (2018) that was
trained on a corpus consisting of 20 million clin-
ical notes from a research hospital, 1.7 million
full-text articles from PubMed, and an insurance
claims database with 60 million members.

For ESP, we used a 500-dimensional model
trained over SemMedDB using the recent Em-
beddings Augmented by Random Permutations
(EARP) approach with a 10−7 sampling threshold
for predications and a 10−5 sampling threshold for
concepts excluding concepts that had a frequency
greater than 106 (Cohen and Widdows, 2018).

To apply Cui2Vec and ESP, we first pro-
cessed the MedNLI dataset (Romanov and Shiv-
ade, 2018) with MetaMap to normalize entities to
their concept unique identifier (CUI) in the UMLS
(Aronson, 2006). MetaMap takes text as input
and applies biomedical and clinical entity recog-
nition (ER), followed by word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) that links entities to their normalized
concept unique identifiers (CUIs). Entities that
mapped to a UMLS CUI were assigned a repre-
sentation in Cui2Vec and ESP. Other tokens were
assigned vector representations using fastText em-
beddings trained on MIMIC-III data (Bojanowski
et al., 2017; Romanov and Shivade, 2018).

3.2 Inference Model

For all experiments, we used the AllenNLP im-
plementation (Gardner et al., 2018) of the En-
hanced Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) archi-
tecture (Chen et al., 2017). This model encodes
the premise and hypothesis using a Bidirectional
LSTM (BiLSTM) where at each time step the hid-
den state of the LSTMs are concatenated to repre-
sent its context. Local inference between the two
sentences is then achieved by aligning the relevant
information between words in the premise and hy-
pothesis. This alignment based on soft attention
is implemented by the inner product between the
encoded premise and encoded hypothesis to pro-
duce an attention matrix (Figure 1 and 2). These
attention values are used to create a weighted rep-
resentation of both sentences. An enhanced rep-
resentation of the premise is created by concate-
nating the encoded premise, the weighted hypoth-



503

embedding. Premise: “He will be spending time with family and friends who are coming in from around the
country to see him.” Hypothesis: “his family and friends do not yet have plans to visit.”

esis, the encoded premise minus the weighted hy-
pothesis, and the element-wise multiplication of
the encoded premise and the weighted hypothesis.
The enhanced representation of the hypothesis is
created similarly. This operation is expected to
enhance the local inference information between
elements in each sentence. This representation is
then projected into the original dimension and fed
into a second BiLSTM inference layer in order to
capture inference composition sequentially. The
resulting vector is then summarized by max and
average pooling. These two pooled representa-
tions are concatenated and passed through a multi-
layered perceptron followed by a sigmoid function
to predict probabilities for each of the sentence la-
bels, i.e. entailment, contradiction, and neutral.

4 Results

The ESIM model achieved an accuracy of 81.2%,
65.2%, and 77.8% for the MedNLI task using
BERT, Cui2Vec, and ESP, respectively. Table 1
shows the number of correct predictions by each
embedding type. The BERT model has the highest

accuracy on predicting entailment and contradic-
tion labels, while the ESP model has the highest
accuracy on predicting neutral labels. However,
the difference is only significant in the case of en-
tailment.

To evaluate the ability to set a predictive thresh-
old for use in clinical applications, we sought to
measure the certainty with which the model made
its predictions. To achieve this goal, we used the
predicted probabilities of each embedding type on
their respective subset of correct predictions such
that. We found the predicted probability of ESP
to be much higher than the others as depicted in
Figure 3. ESP’s minimum predicted probability as
well as the variance of its distribution is the lowest
among all embedding types.

4.1 Error Analysis

To examine the relationship between embedding
prediction performance and hypothesis focus, we
first annotated the test set for:

• hypothesis focus (e.g. medications, proce-
dures, symptoms, etc.)

4.1.1 Focus

A total of eleven, non-mutually exclusive hypoth-
esis focus classes were arrived at by consensus
of the three authors after an initial blinded round
of annotation by two annotators. The remaining
data was annotated by one of these annotators. We
provide definitions of the classes and their overall
counts in Table 2. The classes are: State, Anatomy,
Disease, Process, Temporal, Medication, Clinical
Finding, Location, Lab/Imaging, Procedure, and
Examination.

We then performed Pearson’s chi-squared test
with Yates’ continuity correction on 2x2 contin-
gency tables for each embedding sentence pair
prediction (correct or incorrect) with each hy-

pothesis focus (presence or absence) using the
chisq.test function in R software and results re-
ported in Table 3.

The only significant relationships between hy-
pothesis focus and embedding accuracy were
found between BERT and Disease (p-value =
0.01) and Cui2Vec and Disease (p-value = 0.01)
through Pearson’s Chi-squared test with Yates’
continuity correction. Both embeddings achieved
higher accuracy on sentence pairs with a hy-
pothesis focus labeled Disease (BERT=90.4%;
Cui2Vec=76.6%) than without (BERT=78.5%;
Cui2Vec=61.7%).

4.1.2 Tense

Each hypothesis was annotated for tense into one
of three mutually exclusive classes: Past, Current,

Examination Physical examination or explicit use of the word exam(ination) 3 (0.7)

and Future. Test set hypotheses were predomi-
nantly Current (n=273; 67.4%) or Past (n=131;
32.3%) tense. Only one hypothesis (0.2%) was
Future tense. A subset (n=22; 7.9%) of the Cur-
rent tense hypotheses explicitly described patient
history (e.g. “The patient has a history of PE”).

terns from the attention heatmaps that differen-

Table 3: Results from chi-squared (with Yates’ continuity correction) test of correct(+) and incorrect(-) predictions
by embedding and hypothesis focus type.

The coverage of entities and their associations
was characteristic of BERT predictions (Figure 1).
BERT associated “spending time” with “plans”
in addition to the lexical overlap of the word “fam-
ily” which is attended by each experimental con-
dition in this example. All three embeddings iden-
tified the contradictory significance of the word
“not” in the hypothesis. However, BERT as-
sociated it with both spans “will be” and “are
coming” in the premise, which led to the cor-
rect prediction. Cui2Vec over-attended the lexical
match of the words “and”, “to” and “C0079382”,
which led to the wrong prediction.

The ESP model recognized hierarchical rela-
tionships between entities, e.g. “Advil” and
“NSAIDs” (Figure 2). In this example, the
ESP approach attends to the daily use of “ASA”
(acetyl-salicylic acid), i.e. aspirin, and the patient
denying the use of “other NSAIDs”. This pattern
was recognized multiple times in our analysis and
provides a strong example of how continuous rep-
resentations of biomedical ontologies may be used
to augment contextual representations.

6 Limitations

The results presented in this paper compare a sin-
gle model for each representation method fine-
tuned to the development set. However, it is
well known that the weights of the same model
may vary slightly between training runs. There-
fore, a more comprehensive approach would be to
present the average attention weights across mul-

tiple training runs and to examine the weights at
each attention layer of the models which we leave
for future work.

7 Conclusion

We have presented our analysis of representation
methods on the MedNLI task as evaluated during
the MEDIQA 2019 shared task. We found that
BERT embeddings fine-tuned using PubMed and
MIMIC-III outperformed both Cui2Vec and ESP
methods. However, we found that ESP had the
lowest variance and highest predictive certainty,
which may be useful in determining a minimum
threshold for clinical decision support systems.
Disease was the only hypothesis focus to show
a significant positive relationship with embedding
prediction accuracy. This association was present
for BERT and Cui2Vec embeddings - but not ESP.
Overall, contradiction was the easiest label to pre-
dict for all three embeddings, which may be the
result of an annotation artifact where contradic-
tion pairs had higher lexical overlap often differ-
entiated by explicit negation. However, overfit-
ting on the negation can lead to lower accuracy
on other entailment labels. Further, our prelimi-
nary results indicate that recognition of hierarchi-
cal relationships is characteristic of ESP suggest-
ing that they can be used to augment contextual
embeddings which, in turn, would contribute lexi-
cal coverage including sub-word information. We
propose combining these methods in future work.
