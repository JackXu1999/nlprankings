Abstract

Automatically estimating a user’s socio-
economic profile from their language use
in social media can significantly help so-
cial science research and various down-
stream applications ranging from business
to politics. The current paper presents the
first study where user cognitive structure
is used to build a predictive model of in-
come. In particular, we first develop a
classifier using a weakly supervised learn-
ing framework to automatically time-tag
tweets as past, present, or future. We
quantify a user’s overall temporal orienta-
tion based on their distribution of tweets,
and use it to build a predictive model of
income. Our analysis uncovers a corre-
lation between future temporal orientation
and income. Finally, we measure the pre-
dictive power of future temporal orienta-
tion on income by performing regression.

1 Introduction

User-generated content in social media such as
Twitter has enabled the study of author profiling
on an unprecedented scale. Author profiling in
social media aims at inferring various attributes
of the user from the text that they have written.
Most of the prior studies in this field have fo-
cused on age, gender prediction (Marquardt et al.,
2014; Sap et al., 2014), psychological well-being
(Dodds et al., 2011; Choudhury et al., 2013), and a
host of other behavioural, psychological and med-
ical phenomena (Kosinski et al., 2013). However,
there has been a lack of work looking at the socio-
economic characteristics of Twitter users. In this
paper, we focus on automatic estimation of Twit-
ter users’ income from their Twitter language. An
income predictor of social media users can be use-
ful for both social science research and a range of

downstream applications in banking, marketing,
and politics.

Previous social science studies on income
demonstrate that income of people is correlated
with various factors such as demographic fea-
ture (the congressional district in which the re-
spondent lived), educational categories, sex, age,
age squared, gender, race categories, marital sta-
tus categories, and height (Kahneman and Deaton,
2010). Other studies reveal that psychological
traits related to extroversion (e.g. larger social
networks) and conscientiousness (e.g. orderli-
ness) have a positive correlation with income,
while neurotic traits (e.g. anger, anxiety) are anti-
correlated (Roberts et al., 2007). Human temporal
orientation refers to individual differences in the
relative emphasis one places on the past, present,
or future (Zimbardo and Boyd, 2015). Past studies
have established consistent links between tempo-
ral orientation and most of the above-mentioned
income predictor factors such as age, sex, gender,
education, and psychological traits (Webley and
Nyhus, 2006; Adams and Nettle, 2009; Schwartz
et al., 2013; Zimbardo and Boyd, 2015). Accord-
ingly, this begs the question as to whether there is
any link between an individual’s temporal orien-
tation and their income level. Traditionally, tem-
poral orientation has been assessed by self-report
questionnaires. In this paper, we assess tempo-
ral orientation based on language use in Twitter.
Our method uses a tweet-level classifier of past,
present, and future, grouped over users to create
user-level assessments.

Our learning framework uses convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) (Goodfellow et al., 2016)
to infer tweet vector representations, and consid-
ers them as the feature to develop a classification
model that can automatically detect the time ori-
entation (oriented towards past, present, and fu-
ture) of tweets. The framework leverages weak
supervision signals provided by a list of manu-

659

ally selected eighty (80) high-precision seed terms
(and automatically extracted similar terms) repre-
senting past, present, and future to train the CNN.
For example, tweets exclusively containing past
(resp. present and future) seed terms were marked
with weak labels past (resp. present and future).
We used the tweet-level temporal classifier to au-
tomatically classify a large dataset consisting of
≈10 million tweets from 5,191 users mapped to
their income, using fine-grained user occupation
as a proxy. Finally, we tested whether individual
differences in past, present, and future orientation
are related to income. In particular, we frame the
income prediction task as regression using linear
as well as non-linear learning algorithms where
temporal orientation served as predictive features.
To the best of our knowledge, this represents the
first work to study a temporal orientation-based in-
come prediction using Twitter language.

In summary the proposed approach is different
from the previous works (Schwartz et al., 2015;
Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015; Park et al., 2017) in
several ways. Unlike Schwartz et al. (2015), we
used a weakly supervised approach. The genera-
tion of training data is semi-automatic in our case.
Rather than manually identifying features, tweet
vectors are fed to a CNN classifier. Furthermore
while Schwartz et al. (2015) studied temporal ori-
entation of facebook data in order to predict differ-
ent human correlates like conscientiousness, age,
and gender, our current work focuses on predict-
ing the income of a user using temporal orientation
of their tweets. In Preoţiuc-Pietro et al. (2015),
the authors predict user income based on different
demographic and psychological features of users.
However, the process of extracting these features
is computationally complex. The current study is
therefore, the first of its kind to explore the use of
temporal orientation of user-tweets to predict in-
come.

2 Related Work

Existing message-/sentence-level temporal clas-
sification methods generally fall into two cate-
gories: (1) rule-based methods, and (2) supervised
machine-learning methods. Rule-based methods
mainly rely on manually designed classification
rules for each temporal class (Nie et al., 2015).
Despite their effectiveness, this kind of method re-
quires substantial efforts in rule design. Most re-
search on machine learning-based sentence tem-

poral classification has revolved around feature
engineering for better classification performance.
Different kinds of features have been explored
such as bag-of-words, time expressions, part-of-
speech tags, and temporal class-specific lexicons
(Schwartz et al., 2015). Temporal class specific
lexicon creation and feature engineering also cost
a lot of human efforts. In addition, creation
of a large-scale training data set for supervised
machine-learning approaches is also very labori-
ous.

3 Methodology

In this section, we describe our proposed method-
ology to identify the underlying temporal orienta-
tion of tweets and a set of contrastive systems that
we used as baselines for comparative study.

3.1 Tweet Temporal Orientation Classifier

The task can be defined as given a tweet t and its
posting date d, predict its temporal class c ∈ {
past, present, or future} with reference to its is-
suing date.
Proposed Architecture: The proposed frame-
work has two main steps as: (i) training the model
parameters, and (ii) using the model to tag unseen
tweets. During training, we use the weakly la-
beled tweets to learn the parameters of the CNN
and temporal orientation classifier. For classifica-
tion, a linear Support Vector Machine (lSVM)1 is
used. In particular, we trained three binary clas-
sifiers (one per class)2 using one-vs.-rest, and la-
bel a tweet with the class that assigned the highest
score. In the second step, we pass tweets through
these two optimized components to detect their
temporal orientation.

with linear kernels (polynomial kernels yielded worse per-
formance).

The choice of CNN for feature extraction is mo-
tivated by:

• CNNs have been successfully used as feature
extractors in various computer vision tasks
and achieved better results compared to hand-
crafted features. Research has shown that
CNN feature maps can be used with SVM to
yield classification results that outperform the
original CNN (Athiwaratkun et al., 2015)

• Superior accuracies have also been achieved
by following a similar line of research in the
context of NLP tasks (Kim, 2014; Poria et al.,
2015).

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): The
task is challenging as tweets are short and noisy.
Moreover, English, like many languages, uses a
wide variety of ways to refer to the past, present,
and future. Unlike previous approaches which
mainly rely on hand-crafted rules and feature en-
gineering, we automatically extract features for
tweets to build our tweet-level Temporal Orienta-
tion Classifier. In particular, we use CNNs to auto-
matically extract tweet vectors as the features for
classification. Recently, CNNs have been shown
to be useful in many natural language process-
ing and information retrieval tasks by effectively
modeling natural language semantics (Collobert
et al., 2011). For our experiments, we trained a
simple CNN with one convolution layer followed
by one max pooling layer (Collobert et al., 2011;
Kim, 2014). In the CNN model, we use 3 filters
with window sizes of 5, 6 and 7 with 100 fea-
ture maps each. These window sizes will capture
5-gram, 6-gram, and 7-gram information in the
tweets. We employ dropout for regularization with
a dropout rate of 0.5 which is a reasonable default.
We also use rectified linear units and mini-batches
with size of 50. The parameters of the CNN were
fixed based on the performance of 3-fold cross-
validation. The tweet representations are trained
on top of pre-trained word vectors which are up-
dated during CNN training. We use the publicly
available word2vec3 vectors that are trained on
Google News corpus as well our own Word2vec
vectors4 trained during the labeled-data creation
phase. During the training phase, the parameters

3https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
4trained using gensim library available at

https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/intro.html

of the CNN model are learned by passing multi-
ple filters over word vectors and then applying the
max-over-time pooling operation to generate fea-
tures which are used in a fully connected softmax
layer. Finally, we use the cross-entropy loss func-
tion for learning the parameters of the model. Sim-
ilar to Kim (2014), we use dropout (Hinton et al.,
2012) to regularize the change of parameters by
randomly setting some weights to zero that pre-
vents overfitting.

3.2 Income Predictor Model
Similar to Preoţiuc-Pietro et al. (2015), we for-
mulate the income prediction task as regression
using user-level temporal orientation as features.
First, the tweet temporal orientation classifier is
used to label whether a tweet focuses on past,
present, or future. Afterwards, at user-level, we
produce three categories of temporal orientation
(three separate variables summing to one), defined
simply as the proportion of a user’s total tweets
(tweets(user)all) classified in the given temporal
category (c ∈ { past, present, or future}), as in (1):

orientationc(user) =
|tweetsc(user)|
|tweetsall(user)|

(1)

We use linear and non-linear methods. The lin-
ear method is logistic regression (LR) (Freed-
man, 2009) with Elastic Net regularisation. In or-
der to capture the non-linear relationship between
a user’s temporal orientation and their income,
we use Gaussian Processes (GP) (Rasmussen and
Nickisch, 2010) for regression. Given that our
dataset is very large and the number of features
is high, for GP inference we use the fully indepen-
dent training conditional approximation (Snelson
and Ghahramani, 2005) with 500 random induc-
ing points.

4 Data Sets

4.1 Training Data
Tweets are collected using the Twitter stream-
ing API.5 We downloaded English tweets during
the period 01.01.2015–31.01.2015, which gener-
ated about 40 million tweets. After collecting
the tweets, we filter past-, present-, and future-
oriented tweets using a manually selected high
precision list of 50 seed terms. These are terms

overview.

661



that capture temporal dimensions of tweets with
very few false positives, though the recall of these
terms is low. In order to increase the recall, and to
capture new terms that are good paradigms of past,
present, and future, we expand our initial seed
terms using a query expansion technique. We em-
ploy a continuous distributed vector representation
of words using the continuous Skip-gram model
(also known as Word2Vec) proposed by Mikolov
et al. (2013). The model is trained on the whole
collection of 40 million tweets with dimension and
window size set to 300 and 7, respectively.

Given the vector representations for the terms,
we calculate the similarity scores between pairs
of terms in our vocabulary using cosine similar-
ity. The top 10 similar terms for each seed term
are selected for the expansion of the initial seed
list. We again filter the whole collection of tweets
using the newly added seed terms. We finally
select 120,000 tweets equally distributed in past
(=40,000 tweets), present (=40,000), and future
(=40,000) temporal categories.6 Examples of fil-
tered tweets are as follows:

• Thank you so much for coming in for our
show yesterday. (seed=yesterday)

• @**** is currently out of the office working
his other job. (seed=currently)

• I promise you don’t have to be afraid.
(seed=promise)

Table 1 shows some examples of expanded
terms for some of the initial seed terms. There are
some unrelated keywords in the expanded seed list
due to the automatic process of keyword selection.

4.2 Test Set
In order to evaluate the tweet temporal orientation
classification model, 2035 tweets were manually
annotated by three human annotators in four dif-
ferent categories: past, present, future and doubt-
ful. Majority voting is applied to assign the fi-
nal output class to a given tweet. Tweets whose
temporal orientation was not resolved by majority
voting were deleted from the test set.7 The final
distribution of annotated tweets was: past=423,
present=1252, future=325, doubtful=35.

6Similar to Schwartz et al. (2015), we only considered
past, present and future categories.

7Note that we approached the authors of Schwartz et al.
(2015) to obtain their dataset but they did not share the data
because of copyright issues. This is the reason for generating
our own gold-standard test set.

4.3 Income data of Users

We used a dataset developed by Preoţiuc-Pietro
et al. (2015), which contains 5,191 Twitter users
along with their platform statistics and ≈10 mil-
lion historical tweets. The dataset is based on
mapping a Twitter user to a job title and using this
as a proxy for the mean income for that specific
occupation.

5 Experimental Results

Temporal Orientation Classification Results:
The performance of our tweet temporal orienta-
tion classifier is evaluated using the manually an-
notated test set. We compare our approach with
two baselines that are the most relevant for our re-
search: (i) Baseline1: a rule-based method (Nie
et al., 2015) and (ii) Baseline2: a supervised learn-
ing strategy with bag-of-words, time expressions,
part-of-speech tags, and temporal class-specific
lexicon features (Schwartz et al., 2015). Com-
parative evaluation results are presented in Table
2. The results show that our weakly supervised
framework outperforms rule-based and supervised
learning technique in terms of accuracy.

We examine the impact of the size of la-
beled training data on each method’s performance.
Baseline1 (rule-based approach) is not involved
since this does not depend on labeled training data.
We randomly select d% of the training data to train
the classifiers and test them on the test set, with d
ranging from 10 to 90. For each d, we generate
the training set 20 times and the averaged perfor-
mance is recorded. Accuracies of both approaches
over the test data are presented in Table 3. Re-
sults show that our proposed framework performs
consistently better than its counterpart. In particu-
lar, results show that with 30K training examples,
better results can be obtained by our approach than
relying on 120K training items for the state-of-the-
art supervised machine learning approach (Base-
line2).
Income Prediction Results: Similar to Preoţiuc-
Pietro et al. (2015), we measure the predictive
power of temporal orientation by performing re-
gression on the user income. Performance is
measured using 10-fold cross-validation: in each
round, 80% of the data is used to train the model,
10% is used to tune model parameters using grid
search and a different 10% is held out for test-
ing. The final results are computed over the ag-
gregate set of results of all 10 folds. Results us-

Table 4: Prediction of income using temporal ori-
entation features

correlation between a user’s future temporal ori-
entation and their income is the highest, i.e. peo-
ple with higher future temporal orientation tend to
have higher income levels. Results also demon-
strate that predictive models with future tempo-
ral orientation as a feature can predict income
with high accuracy compared to past and present
temporal orientation. Our findings are consistent

with previous research that suggests that future-
oriented thinking is linked to academic achieve-
ment, increased social involvement, lower dis-
tress, extroversion, and conscientiousness. These
factors are also positively correlated with income
(Kahana et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2007). Note
also that, the non-linear methods outperform the
linear methods by a wide margin, showing the im-
portance of modeling non-linear relationships in
our data.

6 Conclusions

We presented the first large-scale study aiming to
predict the income of Twitter users from their tem-
poral orientation. Temporal orientation of users
is assessed from their tweets. Our weakly super-
vised learning framework automatically time-tags
tweets according to its underlying temporal ori-
entation: past, present, or future. The associa-
tions we found between user-level future tempo-
ral orientation and income are novel in the con-
text of well-established temporal orientation cor-
relates. As future work, we are in the process of
improving the temporal orientation classification
accuracy by incorporating linguistic and sentiment
related features into the deep learning phase.
