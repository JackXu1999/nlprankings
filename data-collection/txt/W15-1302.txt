Abstract

In this paper, we present a corpus study in-
vestigating the use of the fillers äh (uh) and
ähm (uhm) in informal spoken German youth
language and in written text from social me-
dia. Our study shows that filled pauses oc-
cur in both corpora as markers of hesita-
tions, corrections, repetitions and unfinished
sentences, and that the form as well as the
type of the fillers are distributed similarly in
both registers. We present an analysis of
fillers in written microblogs, illustrating that
äh and ähm are used intentionally and can add
a subtext to the message that is understand-
able to both author and reader. We thus ar-
gue that filled pauses in user-generated con-
tent from social media are words with extra-
propositional meaning.

1 Introduction

In spoken communication, we can find a high num-
ber of utterences that are disfluent, i.e. that include
hesitations, repairs, repetitions etc. Shriberg (1994)
estimates the ratio of disfluent sentences in spon-
taneous human-human communication to be in the
range of 5-6%.

One particular type of disfluencies are filled
pauses (FP) like äh (uh) and ähm (uhm). FP are
a frequent phenomenon in human communication
and can have multiple functions. They can be put
at any position in an utterance and are used when a
speaker encounters planning and word-finding prob-
lems (Maclay and Osgood, 1959; Arnold et al.,
2003; Goffman, 1981; Levelt, 1983; Clark, 1996;

Barr, 2001; Clark and Fox Tree, 2002), or as strate-
gic devices, e.g. as floor-holders or turn-taking sig-
nals (Maclay and Osgood, 1959; Rochester, 1973;
Beattie, 1983). Filled pauses can function as
discourse-structuring devices, but they can also ex-
press extra-propositional aspects of meaning beyond
the propositional content of the utterance, e.g. as
markers of uncertainty or politeness (Fischer, 2000;
Barr, 2001; Arnold et al., 2003).

Examples (1)-(6) illustrate the use of FP to mark
repetitions (1), repairs (2), breaks (3) and hesitations
(4) (the last one often used to bridge word find-
ing problems). FPs can also express astonishment
(5), excitement or negative sentiment (6). Extra-
linguistic reasons also come into play, such as the
lack of concentration due to fatigue or distraction,
which might lead to a higher ratio of FP in the dis-
course.

(1) I will uh I will come tomorrow.
(2) I will leave on Sat uh on Sunday.
(3) I think I uh have you seen my wallet?
(4) I have met Sarah and Peter and uhm Lara.
(5) Sarah is Michael’s sister. Uh? Really?
(6) A: He cheated on her. B: Ugh! That’s bad!

The role of fillers in spoken language has been
discussed in the literature (for an overview, see Cor-
ley and Stewart (2008)). Despite this, work on pro-
cessing disfluencies in NLP has mostly considered
them as mere performance phenomena and focused
on disfluency detection to improve automatic pro-
cessing (Charniak and Johnson, 2001; Johnson and
Charniak, 2004; Qian and Liu, 2013; Rasooli and

12



Tetreault, 2013; Rasooli and Tetreault, 2014). Far
fewer studies have focused on the information that
disfluencies contribute to the overall meaning of the
utterance. An exception are Womack et al. (2012)
who consider disfluencies as extra-propositional in-
dicators of cognitive processing.

In this paper, we take a similar stand and present a
study that investigates the use of filled pauses in in-
formal spoken German youth language and in writ-
ten, but conceptually oral text from social media,
namely Twitter microblogs.1 We compare the use
of FP in computer-mediated communication (CMC)
to that in spoken language, and present quantitative
and qualitative results from a corpus study showing
similarities as well as differences between FP in both
the spoken and written register. Based on our find-
ings, we argue that filled pauses in CMC are words
with extra-propositional meaning.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives
an overview on the different properties of spoken
language and written microblogs. In section 3 we
present the data used in our study and describe the
annotation scheme. Section 4 reports our quantita-
tive results which we discuss in section 5. We com-
plement our results with a qualitative analysis in sec-
tion 6, and conclude in section 7.

2 Filled Pauses in Spoken and Written
Registers

Clark and Fox Tree (2002) propose that FP are words
with meaning, but so far there is no conclusive evi-
dence to prove this. While experimental results have
shown that disfluencies do affect the comprehension
process (Brennan and Schober, 2001; Arnold et al.,
2003), this is no proof that listeners have access to
the meaning of a FP during language comprehen-
sion but could also mean that FP are produced “un-
intentionally [...], but at predictable junctures, and
listeners are sensitive to these accidental patterns of
occurrence.” (Corley and Stewart, 2008), p.12.

To show that fillers are words in a linguistic sense,
i.e. lexical units that have a specific semantics that
is understandable to both speaker and hearer, one
would have to show that speakers are able to pro-
duce them intentionally and that recipients are able

1See the model of medial and conceptual orality and literacy
by Koch & Oesterreicher (1985).

to interpret the intended meaning of a filler.
Assuming that fillers are not linguistic words but

simply noise in the signal, caused by the high de-
mands on cognitive processing in spoken online
communication, we would not expect to find them
in medially written communication such as user-
generated content from social media, where the pro-
duction setting does not put the same time pressure
on the user as there is in oral face-to-face commu-
nication. However, a search for fillers on Twitter2

easily proves this wrong, yielding many examples
for the use of FP in medially written text (7).

(7) Oh uh.. I got into the evolve beta.. yet I have
no idea what this game is.. uhm..

Both, informal spoken dialogues and microblogs
can be described as conceptually oral, meaning that
both display a high degree of interactivity, signalled
by the use of backchannel signals and question tags,
and are highly informal with grammatical features
that deviate from the ones in the written standard va-
riety (e.g. violations of word order constraints, case
marking, etc.). Both registers show a high degree of
expressivity, e.g. interjections and exclamatives, and
make use of extra-linguistic features (spoken lan-
guage: gestures, mimics, voice modulation; micro-
text: emoticons, hashtags, use of uppercased words
for emphasis, and more).

Differences between the two registers concern the
spatio-temporal setting of the interaction. While
spoken language is synchronous and takes place
in a face-to-face setting, microblogging usually
involves a spatial distance between users and is
typically asynchronous, but also allows users to
have a quasi-synchronous conversation.3 Quasi-
synchronous here means that it is possible to com-
municate in real time where both (or all) communi-
cating partners are online at the same time, tweeting
and re-tweeting in quick succession, but without the
need for turn-taking devices as there is a strict first-
come-first-serve order for the transmission of the di-
alogue turns. As a result, microblogging does not
put the same time pressure on the user but permits
them to monitor and edit the text. This should rule
out the use of FP as markers of disfluencies such

account of quasi-synchronicity in online chatrooms.

as repairs, repetitions or word finding problems, and
also the use of FP as strategic devices to negotiate
who takes the next turn. Accordingly, we would not
expect to observe any fillers in written microblogs if
their only functions were the ones specified above.

However, regardless of the limited space for
tweets,4 microbloggers make use FP in microtext.
This suggests that FP do indeed serve an important
communicative function, with a semantics that must
be accessible to both the blogger and the recipient.

3 Annotation Experiment

This section describes the data and setup used in our
annotation experiment.

3.1 Data

The data we use in our study comes from two dif-
ferent sources. For spoken language, we use the
KiezDeutsch-Korpus (KiDKo) (Wiese et al., 2012),
a corpus of self-recordings of every-day conversa-
tions between adolescents from urban areas. All in-
formants are native speakers of German. The corpus
contains spontaneous, highly informal peer group
dialogues of adolescents from multiethnic Berlin-
Kreuzberg (around 266,000 tokens excluding punc-
tuation) and a supplementary corpus with adoles-
cent speakers from monoethnic Berlin-Hellersdorf
(around 111,000 tokens). On the normalisation layer
where punctuation is included, the token counts add
up to around 359,000 tokens (main corpus) and
149,000 tokens (supplementary corpus).

The first release of KiDKo (Rehbein et al., 2014)
includes the transcriptions (aligned with the audio
files), a normalisation layer, and a layer with part-
of-speech (POS) annotations as well as non-verbal
descriptions and the translation of Turkish code-
switching.

The data was transcribed using an adapted version
of the transcription inventory GAT 2 (Selting et al.,
1998), also called GAT minimal transcript, which
uses uppercased letters to encode the primary accent
and hyphens in round brackets to mark silent pauses
of varying length.

The microblogging data consists of German-
language Twitter messages from different regions

4The maximum length of a tweet is limited to 140
characters.

äh 646 35.8 6403 0.6
ähm 360 19.9 4182 0.4

numbers (white column) per 10,000 tokens).

of Germany, and includes 7,311,960 tweets with
105,074,399 tokens. For retrieving the tweets we
used the Twitter Search API5 which allows one to
specify the user’s location by giving a latitude and
a longitude pair as parameters for the search. Over
a time period of 6 months we collected tweets from
48 different locations.6 The corpus was automati-
cally augmented with a tokenisation layer and POS
tags.7

A string search in both corpora, looking for vari-
ants of äh and ähm (including upper- and lowercased
spelling variants with multiple ä, with and without
a h, and with one or more m) shows the following
distribution (Table 1). Filled pauses are far less fre-
quent in microblogs compared to spoken language,
but due to the large amount of data we can easily
extract more than 10,000 instances from the Twit-
ter corpus. Note that the tweets in our corpus come
from different registers like news, ads, public an-
nouncements, sports, and more, with only a small
portion of private communication. When constrain-
ing the corpus search to the subsample of private
tweets, we will most likely find a higher proportion
of FP in the social media data.

In summary, we observe a higher amount of FP in
spoken language than in Twitter microblogs. How-
ever, in both corpora variants of äh outnumber ähm
by roughly the same factor. This observation is com-
patible with the results of (Womack et al., 2012) who
report that around 60% of the FP in their corpus of
English diagnostic medical narratives are nasal filled
pauses (uhm, hm) and around 40% are non-nasal
(uh, er, ah).

where a tweet has been sent is not necessarily the residence or
place of birth of the tweet author.

3.2 Annotating Fillers in Spoken Language
and in Microtext

To be able to compare the use of fillers in spoken
language with the one in Twitter microtext, we ex-
tract samples from the two corpora including 500 ut-
terances/tweets with at least one use of äh and 500
tweets with at least one instance of ähm. At the time
of the investigation, the transcription of KiDKo was
not yet completed, and we only found 360 utterances
including an ähm in the finished transcripts.

For annotation, we used the BRAT rapid annota-
tion tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012). Our annotation
scheme is shown in Table 2. We distinguish be-
tween different categories of fillers, namely between
FP that mark repetitions, repairs, hesitations, or that
occur at the end of an unfinished utterance/tweet
(breaks). We also annotated variants of äh and ähm
which were used as question tags or interjections,
but do not consider them as part of the disfluency
markers we are interested in. The Unknown label
was used for instances which either do not belong
to the filler class and shouldn’t have been extracted,
such as example (8), or which couldn’t be disam-
biguated, usually due to missing context.

(8) Hääähähh !!!

Each filler is labelled with its category and posi-
tion. By position we mean the position of the filler
in the utterance or tweet. Here we distinguish be-
tween fillers which occur between (B) utterances/at
the beginning or end of tweets (example 9b) and
those which are integrated (I) in the utterance/tweet
(9a). The numbers in the first column of Table 2
correspond to examples (1)-(6).

3.3 Inter-Annotator Agreement

The data was divided into subsamples of 100 utter-
ances/tweets. Each sample was annotated by three
annotators. Table 3 shows the inter-annotator agree-
ment (Fleiss’ κ) on the KiDKo and Twitter samples.
We report agreement for all but three samples which
we used to train the annotators, refine the guidelines
and to discuss problems with the annotaton scheme.
As we had only 360 instances of ähm from KiDKo,
we divided them into three samples with 100 utter-
ances and a fourth sample with 60 utterances.

Table 3 shows that the annotation of fillers is not
an easy task. The disagreements in the annotations
concern both the category and the position of the FP.
In some cases the annotators agree on the label but
disagree on the position of the filler (10a). This can
be explained by the fact that spoken language (and
sometimes also tweets) does not come with sentence
boundaries, and it is often not clear where we should
segment the utterance. In example (10a) two anno-
tators interpreted the reparandum as part of the ut-
terance and thus assigned REPAIR-I, while the third
annotator analysed am Samstag (on Saturday) as a
new utterance, resulting in the label REPAIR-B.

More often, however, the disagreements concern
the category of the filler, as in (10b) where two an-
notators analysed the utterance as a repair while the
third annotator interpreted it as a break followed by
a new start. The results show that the annotation of
fillers in KiDKo seems to be much harder, with av-
erage κ scores around 0.1 lower than for the tweets.

4 Quantitative Results

Table 4 shows that the ranking for the different cat-
egories of äh and ähm is the same in both corpora
(11). Hesitations are the most frequent category
marked by äh and ähm, followed by repairs and
breaks. Repetitions are less frequent, especially in
the written microblogs, as are äh and ähm as ques-
tion tags and interjections.

Table 4: Frequencies of äh/ähm in KiDKo and in Twitter
(note: numbers don’t add up to 100% because of Un-
known cases).

However, we can also observe a substantial dif-
ference between the spoken and the written regis-
ter. In the latter one, the two most frequent cat-
egories, hesitations and repairs, make up for more
than 90% of all instances of äh and ähm, while in
spoken language these two categories only account
for 76-77% of all occurrences of the two fillers. A
possible explanation is that breaks and repetitions in
spoken language are either performance phenomena
or caused by discourse strategies (e.g. floor-holding)
which are both superfluous in asynchronous written
communication. This still leaves us with the ques-
tion why hesitations and repairs do occur in written
text at all. We will come back to this question in
section 6.

The next question we ask is whether the two
forms, äh and ähm, are used interchangeably or
whether the use of each form is correlated with
its function. As shown in Table 5, hesitations and
breaks are more often marked by ähm while äh oc-
curs more frequently as a marker of repairs and rep-
etitions. This observation holds for both the spoken
and the written register. 72.8% and 80.0% of all in-
stances of ähm occur in the context of a hesitation in
KiDKo and Twitter, while only 59.0% (KiDKo) and
65.8% (Twitter) of the non-nasal fillers äh are used
to mark a hesitation. A Fisher’s exact test shows that
for hesitations and repairs, the differences are statis-
tically significant with p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, while
for breaks and repetitions, the differences might be
due to chance.

Next we look at the syntactic position where those
fillers occur in the text. We would like to know how
often FP are integrated in the utterance and how of-
ten they occur between utterances.

Table 6: Position of äh and ähm in correlation to their
category.

Fox et al. (2010) present a cross-linguistic study
on self-repair in English, German and Hebrew, and
observe that self-corrections in English often include
the repetition of whole clauses, i.e. English speak-
ers “recycle” back to the subject pronouns (Fox et
al. 2010:2491). In their German data this pattern
was less frequent. Fox et al. (2010) conclude that
morpho-syntactic differences between the languages
have an influence on the self-repair practices in the
speakers.

Our findings are consistent with Fox et al. (2010)
in that we mostly observe the repetition of words,
not of clauses (Table 6). Nearly all fillers which
mark repetitions are integrated in the utterance or
tweet, only a few occur between utterances/tweets.
Fillers as markers of repairs are also mostly inte-
grated.

For hesitations, the most frequent category, we
get a more diverse picture. In our spoken language
data, äh and ähm are more often integrated in the
utterance, while for tweets FP as hesitation markers
mostly appear at the beginning or end of the tweet.

So far, our quantitative investigation showed some
striking similarities in the use of filled pauses in the
two corpora. In both registers, the ranking of the
different disfluency types marked by the FP were the
same. Furthermore, we showed that speakers/users
are sensitive to the surface form of a FP and prefer to
use äh in repairs and ähm in hesitations, regardless
of the medium they use for communication.

5 Discussion

In this section we will look at related work on FP
and try to put our findings into context. Previous
work on the difference between nasal and non-nasal
fillers (Barr, 2001; Clark and Fox Tree, 2002) has

described nasal fillers such as uhm, hm as indicators
of a high cognitive load, while their non-nasal vari-
ants indicate a lower cognitive load during speech
production. Clark and Fox Tree (2002) have pro-
posed the filler-as-word hypothesis, stating that FP
like uh and uhm are words in a linguistic sense with
the basic meaning that a minor (uh) or major (uhm)
delay in speaking is about to follow. This analysis is
based on a corpus study showing that silent pauses
following a nasal filler are longer than silent pauses
after a non-nasal filler. Beyond the basic meaning,
FP can have different implicatures, depending on the
context they are used in, such as indicating that the
speaker wants to keep the floor, is planning the next
(part of the) utterance, or wants to cede the floor. To
illustrate this, Clark and Fox Tree (2002) use good-
bye which has the basic meaning “express farewell”
but, when uttered while someone is approaching the
speaker, can have the implicature “Go away”.

We take the filler-as-word hypothesis of Clark and
Fox Tree (2002) as our starting point and see how
adequate it is to describe the use of FP in written mi-
croblogs (section 6). However, we try to avoid the
term implicature which seems problematic in this
context, as we are not dealing with implicatures built
on regular lexical meanings but rather with impli-
catures on top of non-propositional meaning. As a
side-effect, the implicatures based on filled pauses
are not cancellable.

The analysis of Clark and Fox Tree (2002) is not
uncontroversial (see, e.g., Womack et al. (2012) for
a short discussion on that matter). O’Connell and
Kowal (2005) criticise that the corpus study of Clark
and Fox Tree (2002) is based on pause length as per-
ceived by the annotators (instead of being analysed
by means of acoustic measurements).

Furthermore, it might be possible that the seman-
tics of FP to indicate the length of a following de-
lay only applies to English. Belz and Klapi (2013)
have measured pause lengths after nasal and non-
nasal fillers in German L1 and L2 dialogues from a
MAP task and could not find a similar correlation
between filler type and pause length.

In summary, it is not clear whether the different
findings are due to methodological issues, or might
be particular to certain languages and text types.
Shriberg (1994), p.130 suggests that for English,
models of disfluencies based on the ATIS corpus,

17



a corpus of task-oriented dialogues about air travel
planning, might not be able to predict the behaviour
of disfluencies in spoken language corpora with data
recorded in a less restricted setting.

The MAP task corpora used in Belz and
Klapi (2013), for example, includes dialogues where
one speaker instructs another speaker to reproduce
a route on a map. Due to the functional design, the
content of the dialogues is constrained to solving the
task at hand and thus the language is expected to dif-
fer from the one used in the London–Lund corpus
(Svartvik, 1990), a corpus of personal communica-
tion, that was used by Clark and Fox Tree (2002).

Fox Tree (2001) presents a perception experiment
showing that uh helps recognizing upcoming words,
while the nasal um doesn’t. In our study we found a
strong correlation between the category of the filler
and its form (nasal vs. non-nasal). Nasal fillers were
mostly used in the context of hesitations, which is
consistent with their ascribed basic function as indi-
cators of longer pauses (Clark and Fox Tree, 2002).
The tendency to use äh within repairs might be ex-
plained by Fox Tree (2001)’s findings that non-nasal
fillers help to recognise the next word. Thus, we
would expect a preference for non-nasal FP to be
used as an interregnum before the repair.

Other evidence comes from Brennan and
Schober (2001) who present experiments where
the subjects had to follow instructions and select
objects on a graphical display. They showed that
insertions of uh after a mid-word interruption in
the instruction helped the subjects to correctly
identify the target object, as compared to the same
instruction where the filler was replaced by a silent
pause. They conclude that fillers help to recover
from false information in repairs.8

So far, our findings are consistent with previous
work outlined above, but do not rule out other ex-
planations. A major argument against the analysis
of FP as linguistic words is that so far there is no
conclusive evidence that speakers do produce them
intentionally (Corley and Stewart, 2008).

Our corpus study provides this evidence by show-
ing that FP in CMC are produced deliberately and
intentionally. Furthermore, we observed a statis-

pairs to the one obtained by a nasal filler like um.

tically significant correlation between filler form
(nasal or non-nasal) and filler category, which also
points at äh and ähm being separate words with dis-
tinguishable meanings.

In the next section, we show that FP in CMC can
add a subtext to the original message that can be un-
derstood by the recipients, and that the information
they add goes beyond the contribution made by non-
verbal channels such as facial expressions or ges-
tures. We illustrate this, based on a qualitative anal-
ysis of our Twitter data.

6 Extra-propositional Meaning of FP in
Social Media Text

New text from social media provides us with a
good test case to investigate whether filled pauses
are words with (extra-propositional) meaning, as
the production of written text is to a far greater
extent subject to self-monitoring processes. This
means that we can confidently rule out that the use
of fillers in tweets is due to performance problems
caused by the time pressure of online communica-
tion. Another important point is that communica-
tion on Twitter is not synchronous but can be time-
delayed and works on a first-come-first-serve basis.
This is quite important, as it means that we can also
exclude the discourse-strategic functions of FP (e.g.
floor-holding and turn-taking) as possible explana-
tions for the use of fillers in user-generated micro-
text.

We conclude that there have to be other explana-
tions for the use of filled pauses as markers of hesi-
tations and repairs in microblogs. Consider the fol-
lowing examples (12)-(14).

(12) Mein

“I’m asking for uhm a friend.”

The fillers in the examples above add a new layer
of meaning to the tweet which results in an inter-
pretation different from the one we get without the
filler. While a simple “Congratulations!” as answer
to the message “I’m married now” would be inter-
preted as a polite phrase, the mere addition of the
filler implies that this tweet should not be taken at
face value and has a subtext along the lines “Actu-
ally, I really feel sorry for you”. The same is true for
(13) where the subtext can be read as “In fact, we’re
talking about some other bodyparts here”. In exam-
ple (14), the subtext added by the filler will most
probably be interpretated as “I’m really asking for
myself but won’t admit it”.9

In the next examples (15)-(17), also hesitations,
the filler is used to express the author’s uncertainty
about the proposition.

“@zinken uh.. around 98%”

Thus, the most general commonality between the
examples above is that the speaker does not make
a commitment concerning the truth content of the
message.

The following examples (18)-(21) show instances
of äh and ähm in repairs where the FP occur as in-
terregnum between reparandum and repair.10

I will leave you on Sat︸ ︷︷ ︸ uh︸ ︷︷ ︸ on Sunday︸ ︷︷ ︸
REPARANDUM INTERREGNUM REPAIR

9In fact, this adds an interesting meta-level to the utterance,
as by inserting the filler the author draws attention to the fact
that there is something she seemingly wants to hide.

10We follow the terminology of Shriberg (1994).

The tweet author enacts a slip of the tongue, either
by using homonymous or near-homonymous words
(Diskus (discus) – Discos (discos), hängst (hang) –
Hengst (stallion)) or by using analogies and conven-
tionalised expressions (off – on, resist – contradict).
The “mistake” was made with humorous intention
and is then corrected. The filler takes again the slot
of the interregnum and serves as a marker of the in-
tended pun.

In the next set of examples, (22)-(24), a taboo
word or word with a strong negative connotation
is reformulated into something more socially ac-
ceptable (minister of propaganda→ district mayor;
madness → spirit; tantalise → educate). Often,
this is done with a humorous intention, but also
to express negative sentiment (e.g. in (22) towards
Buschkowsky, or in (23) towards Apple).

These examples show that the use of äh and ähm
in tweets is intentional and highly edited. The two
forms are used to express the speaker’s uncertainty
about the propositional content of the message, or as
a signal that the speaker does not warrant the truth
of the message. Other functions include the use of
fillers as markers of humorous intentions and of neg-
ative sentiment (see Table 7). Note that the mean-
ings are not necessarily distinct but often overlap.

We thus argue that FP in user-generated content
from social media are linguistic words that are pro-
duced intentionally and have an extra-propositional
meaning that can be understood by the recipients.

UNCERTAINTY Speaker is uncertain about

the propositional content
TRUTH CONTENT Speaker does not warrant

HUMOR Marker of humorous intention
EVALUATION Marker of negative sentiment

7 Conclusions

The results from our corpus study show that fillers in
user-generated text from social media are linguistic
words that are produced intentionally and function
as carriers of extra-propositional meaning.

This finding has consequences for work on Senti-
ment Analysis and Opinion Mining in social media
text, as it shows that FP are used as a marker of irony
and humour in Twitter, and also indicate uncertainty

and negative sentiment. Thus, filled pauses might be
useful features for irony detection, sentiment analy-
sis, or to assess the strength of an opinion in online
debates.
