ABSTRACT 

This paper tackles the problem of polar vocabulary ambiguity. While some opinionated 
words keep their polarity in any context and/or across any domain (except for the 
ironic style that goes beyond the present article), some other have an ambiguous 
polarity which is highly dependent of the context or the domain: in this case, the 
opinion is generally carried by complex expressions (“patterns”) rather than single 
words. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an original hybrid method, based on 
syntactic information extraction and clustering techniques, to learn automatically such 
patterns and integrate them into an opinion detection system.  

TITLE AND ABSTRACT IN FRENCH 

Apprentissage de patrons polarisés pour la détection contextuelle 
d’opinions 
Cet article se penche sur le problème de l’ambiguïté du vocabulaire de polarité. Alors 
que certains mots conservent la même polarité dans n’importe quel contexte ou 
domaine (à l’exception du registre ironique qui va au-delà du présent article), d’autres 
ont une polarité ambiguë dépendante du contexte ou du domaine : dans ce cas l’opinion 
est portée par des expressions complexes (patrons) et non des mots isolés. Dans cet 
article, nous proposons et évaluons une méthode hybride originale, utilisant de 
l’information syntaxique et des techniques de « clusterisation », pour apprendre 
automatiquement de tels patrons et les intégrer à un système de détection d’opinions.

Introduction 

A fundamental task in opinion mining is classifying the polarity of a given text, 
sentence or feature/aspect level to find out whether it is positive, negative or neutral. 
Different methodologies using NLP and machine learning techniques are used for this 
purpose. The most fine grained analysis model is the feature based sentiment mining 
method. Feature based opinion mining aims at to determining the sentiments or 
opinions that are expressed on different features or aspects of entities (e.g. [Bloom et al. 
2007]).  

The context of this paper is the development of a feature-based opinion mining system, 
for French. One of the essential tasks in the course of this development is the 
acquisition of polar vocabulary, for which one encounters almost immediately the 
problem of polarity ambiguity. In the present paper, we try to address this particular 
problem: while some opinionated words keep their polarity in any context and/or 
across any domain (except for the ironic style that goes beyond the scope of the present 
article), some other have an ambiguous polarity and are highly dependent of the 
context or the domain. In this case, the opinion is generally carried by complex 
expressions rather than single words. Let’s illustrate this problem with some French 
examples:  

• An adjective like “hideux” (hideous) can be considered to have a negative 
polarity in any context and any domain; 

• An adjective like “merveilleux” (wonderful) can be considered to have a 
positive polarity in any context and any domain 

• On the contrary, an adjective like “frais” (fresh) in French might have different 
polarities depending on context and domain : 

o In the context “avoir le teint frais” (to have a healthy glow), “frais” 
has a positive connotation  

o In the context « un accueil plutôt frais » (a rather cool reception)… 
“frais” has a negative connotation 

o In the context un “poisson bien frais (a fresh fish) « frais » has a 
positive connotation  

• An adjective like “rapide » (rapid, fast) in French might also have different 
polarities depending on context and domain : 

o In the context “l’impression est rapide” (the printing is fast), “rapide” 
has a positive connotation  

o In the context “un résumé rapide” (a short summary), “rapide” is 
rather neutral. 

• Etc. 

When building an opinion detection system, it is necessary to be able to disambiguate 
these polar expressions and associate them the adequate polarity, i.e. positive or 
negative, according to the context. In this paper, we focus on the extraction of 
contextual patterns that carry a given polarity. In other terms, we try to automatically 
detect the polarity of a term according to the context, i.e. learn contextual polarity 
patterns, for ambiguous polar adjectives.

After a short review of the related work, we briefly describe our feature based opinion 
detection system, and then we present the methodology we propose to acquire 
opinionated patterns, which is based on syntactic information extraction combined with 
simple clustering techniques. We then show how we have integrated the learned 
patterns into our opinion detection system, and finally evaluate the benefits of this 
integration. 

Related Work 
In the literature about opinion mining, there is a considerable number of works aiming 
at associating polarity to single words. For example SentiWordnet (Baccianella at al. 
2010) is a resource aiming at associating polarity scores to WordNet synsets. Many 
works try to classify polar adjectives, like for example (Vegnaduzzo 2004) who 
proposes a distributional method to classify polarity adjective using a small seed of 
polar adjectives. For French, (Vernier and Monceaux 2010) present a learning method 
relying on the indexing of Web documents by a search engine and large number of 
linguistically motivated requests automatically sent. There is considerably less attempts 
to address the problem of associating polarities to larger expressions, and in particular 
pairs of words in a given syntactic relation, as we propose here. (Wilson et al. 2005), 
noticed that polar vocabulary have a “prior polarity” that can change according to the 
context (negation, diminishers such as “little”, “less”,etc). They learn such contexts by 
performing classification using various features and an annotated corpus. In the present 
paper, we focus on different kind of patterns (noun-adj) and also use a different 
methodology since we only use the marks given to reviews by users and data 
automatically annotated with our rule-based system to perform the clustering step. 
(Riloff et al. 2003) propose a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich 
extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions. High-precision classifiers 
label are used on un-annotated data to automatically create a large training set, which 
is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm. The learned patterns are then 
used to identify more subjective sentences. The bootstrapping process learns many 
subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision. While it as 
some similarities with the work proposed in this paper, is also quite different since they 
try to learn opinionated syntactic patterns while we try to learn opinionated pairs of 
words, contextually dependent in a given syntactic relation. They also make use of 
annotated data, while we only use the marks given to reviews by users and data 
automatically annotated with our rule-based system in order to perform the clustering 
step. 

Our Opinion Detection System 

The opinion detection system we build relies on a robust deep syntactic parser, c.f. (Ait-
Mokhtar et al. 2002), as a fundamental component, from which semantic relations of 
opinion are calculated. Having syntactic relations already extracted by a general 
dependency grammar, we use the robust parser by combining lexical information about 
word polarities, sub categorization information and syntactic dependencies to extract 
the semantic relations. The polarity lexicon has been built using existing resources and 
also by applying classification techniques over large corpora, while the semantic 
extraction rules are handcrafted, see (Brun 2011) for the complete description of these 

167



different components. At this step of development of the system for the French 
language, we have built generic rules for extracting opinion relations and a generic 
polar lexicon containing elements that can be considered as non ambiguous in terms of 
polarity. The work described in this paper aims at enriching this system with patterns 
that disambiguate ambiguous polar terms according to their context of appearance.  

Learning Opinionated Patterns 

As said in introduction, our goal is to try to automatically detect the polarity of a term 
according to the context, i.e. learn contextual polarity patterns, for ambiguous polar 
adjectives. We focus on NOUN-ADJ expressions, where the adjective is qualifying the 
noun and that can be mainly found in texts within two types of expressions, adjectives 
in modifier (1) or attribute (2) position:  

(1) « un accueil sympathique », … "a sympathetic reception”) 
(2) « la cuisine est inventive », le service est lent, … (« the cooking is inventive », 

« the service is slow ») 

To perform this task, we first collect a large corpus of customer reviews from the web, 
where such opinionated patterns can be found. We then use a robust syntactic parser to 
extract the candidate patterns, i.e. the modifier and attribute relationships presented 
above. We apply clustering techniques to group automatically the pattern according to 
their polarities. These different steps are detailed in the remaining of this section.  

Corpus Selection 
We have extracted a large corpus of online user’s reviews about restaurant in French, 
extracted from the web site (http://www.linternaute.com/restaurant/). The reviews in 
html format have been cleaned and converted into xml format. Here’s an example of 
such review, which contains a title (the name of the restaurant), and one or more user 
reviews containing the user rating of the restaurant and a free text comment: 

<review>  
<title> Brasserie André, restaurant gastronomique à Lille</title> 
<userreview> 
<rating>3</rating> 
<comment > Très bonne adresse, les salades sont copieuses, le coin retiré de la circulation, rapport qualité 
prix très correct. </comment> 
(Very good place, salads are substantial, the place is far from traffic, value for money quite correct.) 
</userreview > 
</review> 

The corpus we have collected contains 99364 user’s reviews about 15473 different 
restaurants, i.e. 260 082 sentences (3 337 678 words). The repartition of the reviews 
according to the rating given by the users is shown on table 1. We consider that reviews 
rated from 0 to 2 are negative and that reviews rated from 3 to 5 are positive.

TABLE 1 – Repartition of reviews according to user’s rating 

Pattern Extraction 
In order to extract the patterns we aim at classifying as positive or negative, we use the 
robust syntactic parser presented in section 2, which detects such relations (attribute 
modifier relations between noun and adjectives). Moreover, as this work aims at 
improving an opinion detection system, we also use the opinion detection component 
we have developed on top of this robust parser (see (anonymous_reference)). We filter 
out patterns that are already marked as positive and negative by the opinion detection 
system (because they contain single polar terms that are already encoded in the polar 
lexicon of the system) and keep only the patterns that do not carry any information 
about polarity. The parser outputs syntactic relations among which we select the noun-
adj modifiers and noun-adj attributes. We then count the number of occurrences of 
these relations within reviews rated 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Moreover, we use the existing 
opinion detection system presented previously in order to also count the number of 
time a given pattern co-occurs with positive opinions and with negative opinions, on 
the whole corpus of reviews. Some examples of the results are shown in table 2:  

         Review rating

TABLE 2 – Frequency counting for some example noun-adj patterns 

We end up with a list of 29543 different NOUN-ADJ patterns together with their 
number of occurrences per type of reviews as well as the number of co-occurring 
positive and negative opinions within the whole corpus.

Clustering 
In this step, we aim at clustering together the patterns to group them according to their 
polarity. We use the frequencies per type of review and the number of co-occurring 
positive and negative opinions previously extracted as features for clustering 
algorithms. We use the Weka software (Hall et al. 2009) that embeds a collection of 
machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks, among which clustering algorithms. 
We tested several algorithms and choose to use the Kmeans 1

ambiance,familial,2,1,5,43,155,88,719,48  (atmosphere,family)

 algorithm. We 
experimentally try several numbers of clusters as target for the algorithm, as we have a 
relatively large number of data to cluster (~30 000 patterns). We needed to have a 
trade-off between number of clusters and precision of the results: a too small number of 
clusters gives imprecise results, a too large number of clusters is difficult to evaluate 
and useless (for example starting from N=60 clusters, a lot of clusters contain only 1 
element, which is not interesting). We found this trade-off with a number of 50 clusters, 
that we reorder from the smallest to the largest, since the smallest clusters are the more 
accurate and contain the most frequent elements. Here is the content of the very first 
clusters (with the associated numerical features): 

Cluster1 (5 elements) :  

prix,élevé,41,77,45,57,62,15,541,321    (high,price) 
service,lent,33,107,92,95,80,13,707,399   (service,slow) 
attente,long,31,69,70,50,60,14,521,342   (wait,long) 
service,long,69,280,233,255,218,37,1637,1012  (service,long) 
accueil,froid,35,95,53,33,29,3,297,223   (reception,cool) 

Which is clearly a cluster of expressions with negative polarity; 

Cluster2 (9 elements) :

cuisine,traditionnel,5,12,28,161,427,169,1814,108 (cooking,traditional) 

Which is clearly a cluster of expressions with positive polarity; 

Cluster3 (10 elements): 

                                                   
1 There might be alternative clustering algorithms, we use this one because it was accurate and fast and gave.

Which is clearly a cluster of expressions with positive polarity; etc. 

We validated the first 14 clusters, by counting the number of elements of the cluster 
that have the polarity of the whole cluster. We stopped evaluating at this stage since 
the accuracy started to be low as well as the corpus frequencies of the elements of the 
clusters. Thanks to this validation, we end up with a list of 151 positive patterns and 
118 negative patterns, i.e. a total of 269 opinionated frequent NOUN-ADJ patterns.  

Integration within the Opinion Detection System 

At the end of the previous step, we have collected and validated clusters of patterns and 
associated them a positive or negative polarity. We then inject these results in our rule-
based opinion extractor by automatically converting these patterns into rules (in the 
dedicated format of our robust parser). For example a pattern like “service,lent”, which 
belongs to a negative cluster (cluster1 showed before), is automatically converted into 
the following rule: 

|#1[lemma:”lent”, negative=+| 
If ( ATTRIB(#2[lemme : « service »],#1) | ADJMOD(#2[lemme : « service »],#1)) 
 ~ 

This rule assigns the semantic feature « negative » to the adjective “lent”(#1) (“slow”), 
if and only if this adjective is in attribute or modifier relation with the noun 
“service”(#2), (“service”). Then, the opinion detection component that is applied 
afterward benefits from these polar rules to extract opinion relations accordingly.  

Using these rules, if the input sentence is: “Le service est lent.” (the service is slow), the 
system extracts a negative opinion relation : OPINION[negative](service,lent). While if 
the input sentence is: “La cuisson doit etre lente.” (the cooking should be slow), the 
system does not extract any opinion relation, because the association “cuisson, lente” is 
rather neutral. 

It is quite straightforward to convert automatically the clustered validated patterns into 
this kind of rules that then can be applied on top of the parser, and integrated into the 
opinion detection module. This specific parsing component contains 269 such rules. 

Evaluation 

In order to evaluate the impact of the learned opinionated rules on the overall 
performance of the opinion detection system, we compare the application of the system 
to review’s classification task, with and without including the new resource. The corpus 
we have collected can be considered as annotated in terms of classification, since the 
user gives an explicit mark: 0, 1, 2 = negative and 3, 4, 5 = positive. We use the 

171



relations of opinions extracted by our system to train a SVM binary classifier 
(SVMLight, Joachims 1999) in order to classify the reviews as positive or negative. The 
experimental setup 2

Test set 

 consists in 25000 reviews extracted randomly from the initial 
corpus to train the SVM classifier, 3500 reviews extracted randomly for validation and 
3500 reviews extracted randomly for testing. The SVM features are the relations of 
opinion on a given target concept and their values are the frequencies of these relations 
within a given review, e.g. OPINION-POSITIVE-on-SERVICE:2, OPINION-NEGATIVE-on-
CUISINE:1 , etc. Using this information, we evaluate the system ability to classify 
reviews according to an overall opinion, and we run exactly the same test with the 
same data, respectively with and without the integration of our new learned resource of 
opinionated patterns. The following table shows the results we obtain on the test set.

TABLE 3 – Results on review classification task 

Both results are in line with state of the art results, obtained for similar classification 
tasks, cf. (Pang et al. 2002) or (Paroubek et al. 2007), but the patterns, once encoded 
into our system, improve the classification task accuracy of about 3.3%, which is a 
quite satisfying result. 

Conclusion and Perspectives 
In this paper, we propose an original hybrid method to cope with the problem of 
ambiguous polar vocabulary, by automatically learning contextual patterns and encode 
them into an opinion detection system. The learning step consists in syntactic pattern 
clustering using frequencies extracted thanks to the ratings given by the user in review’s 
comments, and frequencies about co-occurring opinions extracted by an opinion 
detection system. This system is then enriched with the new learned patterns. The 
evaluation on the task of review classification provides encouraging results. We plan to 
pursue this work along three perspectives. This first one will be to investigate other 
types of syntactic patterns for example SUBJECT or OBJECT relations between verbs 
and nouns or MODIFIER relation between nouns and nouns, in order to enrich the 
opinion detection system new opinionated patterns. The second is to apply the 
methodology to opinion detection in English. The last perspective is to improve the 
clustering step by investigating methods to automatically detect the optimal number of 
cluster, as for example proposed in (Pham et al. 2005) or (Arthur 2007).  
                                                   
2 We constrained a 50% repartition of positive and negative reviews on the train, validation and test corpora.
