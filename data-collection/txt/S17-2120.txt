Abstract

We present, in this paper, our contri-
bution in SemEval2017 task 4 : ”Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter”, subtask A:
”Message Polarity Classification”, for En-
glish and Arabic languages. Our sys-
tem is based on a list of sentiment seed
words adapted for tweets. The senti-
ment relations between seed words and
other terms are captured by cosine simi-
larity between the word embedding repre-
sentations (word2vec). These seed words
are extracted from datasets of annotated
tweets available online. Our tests, us-
ing these seed words, show significant
improvement in results compared to the
use of Turney and Littman’s (2003) seed
words, on polarity classification of tweet
messages.

1 Introduction

Sentiment Analysis aims to obtain feelings ex-
pressed as positive, negative, neutral, or even ex-
pressed with different strength or intensity levels.
One of the well known extracting sentiment ap-
proaches is the lexicon-based approach. A senti-
ment lexicon is a list of words and phrases, such
as excellent, awful and not bad, each is being
assigned with a positive or negative score reflect-
ing its sentiment polarity. Therefore, sentiment
lexicon provides rich sentiment information and
forms the foundation of many sentiment analysis
systems (Liu, 2012).

Our system is based on one of the most sig-
nificant sentiment lexicon classification methods
introduced by Turney and Littman (2003). The
method is inspired by the semantic similarity mea-
suring and applied to the sentiment analysis field
as a sentiment similarity measuring. In a similar

method, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) worked
on detecting a word’s sentiment polarity by mea-
suring the difference between its sentiment simi-
larity with a positive seed word and a negative seed
word, respectively. This method achieves better
results with larger corpora, where there are more
chances to find the word (to be classified) near the
positive and negative seed words.

In SemEval2017 task 4, we’re working with
tweets which will lead to deal with slang words
and informal phrases. Therefore, the classic seed
words suggested by Turney and Littman (2003),
listed below in Table 1, will not be very suitable.
For example, the word Superior is rarely used in
the modern ”social media” English, and it is barely
found in tweets compared to other seed words.
In the tweets dataset of sentiment140 (Go et al.,
2009), the word Superior is used 42 times, but
the word Nice is used 23563 times. Thus, for the
English tweets polarity classification task, we use
the adapted for tweets seed words extracted in our
previous work (Htait et al., 2017). And for the
Arabic tweets polarity classification task, we ap-
ply the same method as in (Htait et al., 2017) to
extract Arabic seed words adapted for tweets, to
be used in our system.

positive negative
good, nice, bad, nasty,
excellent, positive, poor, negative
fortunate, correct, unfortunate, wrong,
superior. inferior.

ney and Littman (2003).

2 Related Work

The use of seed words was the base of many sen-
timent analysis experiments, some used the con-
cept with supervised or semi-supervised methods.

718



For example, Ju et al. (2012) worked on a semi-
supervised method for sentiment classification that
aims to train a classifier with a small number of
labeled data (called seed data). Some other exper-
iments used the concept with unsupervied meth-
ods which reduces the need of annotated training
data. For example Turney (2002; 2003), which
used statistical measures to calculate the similar-
ities between words and a list of 14 seed words
(Table 1), such as point wise mutual informa-
tion (PMI). But we should note that Turney’s seed
words were manually selected based on restaurant
reviews, which have different nature than tweets.
Also we find that Maas et al. (2011) used the con-
cept as ”bag of words” but with cosine similarity
measure on word embedding.

Our previous work (Htait et al., 2017) was on
sentiment intensity prediction of tweets segments
using SemEval2016 Task71 data. We extracted
new seed words as more adapted for tweets seed
words. We retrieved the most frequent words in
Sentiment140 (Go et al., 2009) and then manu-
ally filtered the list to eliminate the neutral words.
Our tests in (Htait et al., 2017) showed the effi-
ciency of the new seed words over Turney’s 14
seed words. Also, they showed that using cosine
similarity measure of word embedding represen-
tations (word2vec) yields better results than using
statistical measures like PMI to calculate the sim-
ilarities between words. Therefore, and based on
the above experiments, we decide to use for our
system cosine similarity measure of word embed-
ding representations, but also to use the adapted
for tweets seed words from (Htait et al., 2017).

Even though the Arabic language processing
faces more challenges than the English language,
since words can have transitional meanings
depending on position within a sentence and
the type of sentence (verbal or nominal) (Farra
et al., 2010), we can still find some interesting
experiments in lexical-based sentiment analysis:
El-Beltagy and Ali (2013) built a sentiment
lexicon based on a manually constructed seed
sentiment lexicon of 380 words. Using this
lexicon, with assigned sentiment intensity score
for each value, they were able to calculate the
sentiment orientation for a set of tweets in Arabic
language (Egyptian dialect). Another paper by
Eskander and Rambow (2015) presented a large
list of sentiment lexicon for Arabic language

1http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task7/

called SLSA where each value is associated with
a sentiment intensity score. The scores were
assigned due to a link created between the English
annotation of each Arabic entry to a synset from
SentiWordNet (Cambria et al., 2010). For our
system in Arabic language, we are following the
same method as the system in English language.
But since there is no previously created list of
adapted for tweets seed words, we create the list
following the same method in (Htait et al., 2017),
and then use it with cosine similarity measure of
word embedding representations.

3 Adapted seed words

3.1 English seed words

In (Htait et al., 2017), seed words were extracted
from Sentiment140 dataset (Go et al., 2009). For
the positive seeds, a list of the most frequent
words in Sentiment140 positive tweets is retrieved
and then manually filtered to eliminate the neutral
words, and the same is applied for negative seeds.
The list of English seed words adapted to tweets is
as shown in Table 2.

Positive Negative
love, like, good, win , ill, fucking, shit,
lol, hope, best, thanks, fuck, hate, bad, break,
funny, haha, god, amazing, sucks, cry, damn, sad,
fun,beautiful, nice, cute, stupid, dead, pain, sick,
cool, perfect, awesome, wtf, lost, worst, fail,
okay, special, hopefully, bored, scared, hurts,
glad, congrats, excellent, afraid, upset, broken,
dreams, sunshine, hehe, died, stuck, boring,
positive,fantastic, dance, horrible, negative,
correct, fabulous, superior, unfortunate, inferior,
fortunate, relaxing, unfortunately,poor,
happy,great, kind, laugh, need, suck, wrong,
haven, wonderful, yay, evil, missed, sore, alone,
enjoying, sweet, crap, hell, tired, nasty.

Table 2: The Tweets Adapted English seed words
(Htait et al., 2017).

3.2 Arabic seed words

The Arabic language’s experiences, in lexical-
based sentiment analysis, were mostly oriented to
sentiment lexicons than to seed words. Large lists
of sentiment lexicons were built and used for sen-
timent analysis. For our system, we create a list
of seed words following almost the same method
as in (Htait et al., 2017). We search for the most
common words in positive tweets and in nega-
tive tweets from two annotated corpora of Ara-

719



bic tweets (Arabic Sentiment Tweets Dataset2 and
Twitter data-set for Arabic Sentiment Analysis3).
Then, to filter the list and to eliminate the neu-
tral words, we use Mohammad et al.’s (2016) list.
That list contain 240 positive and negative words
of modern standard Arabic, therefore and due to
Arabic dialects variety, using that list to filter will
create a list of seed words in modern standard Ara-
bic but adapted for tweets, and it can be used in-
dependently of dialects. The list of Arabic seed
words adapted for tweets is as shown in Table 3.

4 System of Sentiment classification

Our System is based on sentiment similarity co-
sine measure with Word Embedding representa-
tions (word2vec). For the English language, we
use twitter word2vec model by Godin et al (Godin
et al., 2015), since best results were achieved us-
ing that model in sentiment intensity prediction
with the adapted seed words (Htait et al., 2017).
This model is a word2vec model trained on 400
millions tweets in English language and it has
word representations of dimensionality 400. For
the Arabic language, there is no twitter word2vec

2http://www.mohamedaly.info/datasets/astd
3https://archive.ics.uci.edu

model available online (to the best of our knowl-
edge). Therefore, we collect 42 millions tweets in
Arabic language from archived twitter streams4 to
create our twitter word2vec model.

In Figure 1, we have the work flow of our sys-
tem for tweets sentiment classification. First, each
tweet is cleaned by removing links, user names,
stop words, numeric tokens and characters except
the common emoticons: ”:-)”, ”:-(”, ”:)”, ”:(”,
”:’(”. Also, words with repetitive characters are
replaced by the corrected ones (e.g. coooool by
cool). After that, the tweet is segmented into to-
kens or words. The similarity between each word
with positive seed words and negative seed words
is calculated using gensim tool5 with the previ-
ously mentioned word2vec models for both lan-
guages English and Arabic.

Having the sentiment score of each word in a
tweet, we aggregate by sum to combine these val-
ues. The final score specify the tweet’s polarity.
After many tests on old SemEval data (task ”Mes-
sage Polarity Classification” of 2013 and 2014),
we found that the best scores achieved are by con-
sidering the following: if the score is higher than
1, the tweet is considered positive, else if the score
is lower than -2, the tweet is considered negative,
else it is considered neutral.

To test the efficiency of the adapted seed words
on tweets polarity classification, we apply our sys-
tem on SemEval data for the task : ”Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter” of years 20136 and 20147,
using Turney’s seed words (in Table1), and the
adapted seed words. The Table 4, along with the
results, shows clearly how the use of the adapted
for tweets seed words increase the results com-
pared to Turney’s seed words.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present our contribution in Se-
mEval2017 task4: Sentiment Analysis in Twit-
ter, subtask A: Message Polarity Classification,
for English and Arabic languages. Our sys-
tem is based on a list of sentiment seed words
adapted for tweets, used in sentiment similarity
cosine measure with word embedding representa-
tions (word2vec). Although the results are encour-
aging, further investigation is required concerning
the detection of negations (e.g. not) and intensi-
fiers(e.g. very) in the tweets, due to their big effect
on reversing the polarity of a tweet.
