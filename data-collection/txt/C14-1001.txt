Invited Speaker Abstract

This presentation will illustrate how program management and science can cooperate to increase our
understanding of human languages and algorithms for processing them. In this presentation, I will use
the IARPA Babel program as an example. The goal of the Babel Program is to rapidly develop speech
recognition capability for keyword search in new languages, working with speech recorded in a variety
of conditions and with limited amounts of transcription. The speech data is recorded in native countries
and contains variability in speaker demographics and recording conditions. The Program will ultimately
address a broad set of languages with a variety of phonotactic, phonological, tonal, morphological, and
syntactic characteristics. I will discuss the data resources collected to support the research, the challenges
that performers have faced when working with a variety of languages collected in realistic environments,
the lessons learned, and future directions.
