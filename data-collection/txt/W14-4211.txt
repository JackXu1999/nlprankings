Abstract

Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
systems are heavily dependent on the qual-
ity of parallel corpora used to train transla-
tion models. Translation quality between
certain Indian languages is often poor due
to the lack of training data of good qual-
ity. We used triangulation as a technique
to improve the quality of translations in
cases where the direct translation model
did not perform satisfactorily. Triangula-
tion uses a third language as a pivot be-
tween the source and target languages to
achieve an improved and more efficient
translation model in most cases. We also
combined multi-pivot models using linear
mixture and obtained significant improve-
ment in BLEU scores compared to the di-
rect source-target models.

1 Introduction

Current SMT systems rely heavily on large quan-
tities of training data in order to produce good
quality translations. In spite of several initiatives
taken by numerous organizations to generate par-
allel corpora for different language pairs, train-
ing data for many language pairs is either not
yet available or is insufficient for producing good
SMT systems. Indian Languages Corpora Initia-
tive (ILCI) (Choudhary and Jha, 2011) is currently
the only reliable source for multilingual parallel
corpora for Indian languages however the number
of parallel sentences is still not sufficient to create
high quality SMT systems.

This paper aims at improving SMT systems
trained on small parallel corpora using various re-
cently developed techniques in the field of SMTs.
Triangulation is a technique which has been found
to be very useful in improving the translations
when multilingual parallel corpora are present.

Triangulation is the process of using an interme-
diate language as a pivot to translate a source lan-
guage to a target language. We have used phrase
table triangulation instead of sentence based tri-
angulation as it gives better translations (Utiyama
and Isahara, 2007). As triangulation technique ex-
plores additional multi parallel data, it provides
us with separately estimated phrase-tables which
could be further smoothed using smoothing meth-
ods (Koehn et al. 2003). Our subsequent approach
will explore the various system combination tech-
niques through which these triangulated systems
can be utilized to improve the translations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We will first talk about the some of the related
works and then we will discuss the facts about the
data and also the scores obtained for the baseline
translation model. Section 3 covers the triangu-
lation approach and also discusses the possibility
of using combination approaches for combining
triangulated and direct models. Section 4 shows
results for the experiments described in previous
section and also describes some interesting obser-
vations from the results. Section 5 explains the
conclusions we reached based on our experiments.
We conclude the paper with a section about our fu-
ture work.

2 Related Works

There are various works on combining the tri-
angulated models obtained from different pivots
with the direct model resulting in increased con-
fidence score for translations and increased cov-
erage by (Razmara and Sarkar, 2013; Ghannay et
al., 2014; Cohn and Lapata, 2007). Among these
techniques we explored two of the them. The first
one is the technique based on the confusion ma-
trix (dynamic) (Ghannay et al., 2014) and the other
one is based on mixing the models as explored
by (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). The paper also dis-
cusses the better choice of combination technique

85



among these two when we have limitations on
training data which in our case was small and re-
stricted to a small domain (Health & Tourism).

As suggested in (Razmara and Sarkar, 2013),
we have shown that there is an increase in phrase
coverage when combining the different systems.
Conversely we can say that out of vocabulary
words (OOV) always decrease in the combined
systems.

3 Baseline Translation Model

In our experiment, the baseline translation model
used was the direct system between the source and
target languages which was trained on the same
amount of data as the triangulated models. The
parallel corpora for 4 Indian languages namely
Hindi (hn), Marathi (mt), Gujarati (gj) and Bangla
(bn) was taken from Indian Languages Corpora
Initiative (ILCI) (Choudhary and Jha, 2011) . The
parallel corpus used in our experiments belonged
to two domains - health and tourism and the train-
ing set consisted of 28000 sentences. The develop-
ment and evaluation set contained 500 sentences
each. We used MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007) to
train the baseline Phrase-based SMT system for all
the language pairs on the above mentioned paral-
lel corpus as training, development and evaluation
data. Trigram language models were trained using
SRILM (Stolcke and others, 2002). Table 1 below
shows the BLEU score for all the trained pairs.

4 Triangulation: Methodology and
Experiment

We first define the term triangulation in our con-
text. Each source phrase s is first translated to an
intermediate (pivot) language i, and then to a tar-
get language t. This two stage translation process
is termed as triangulation.

Our basic approach involved making triangu-
lated models by triangulating through different
pivots and then interpolating triangulated models
with the direct source-target model to make our
combined model.

In line with various previous works, we will
be using multiple translation models to overcome
the problems faced due to data sparseness and in-
crease translational coverage. Rather than using
sentence translation (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007)
from source to pivot and then pivot to target, a
phrase based translation model is built.

Hence the main focus of our approach is on
phrases rather than on sentences. Instead of using
combination techniques on the output of several
translation systems, we constructed a combined
phrase table to be used by the decoder thus avoid-
ing the additional inefficiencies observed while
merging the output of various translation systems.
Our method focuses on exploiting the availability
of multi-parallel data, albeit small in size, to im-
prove the phrase coverage and quality of our SMT
system.

Our approach can be divided into different steps
which are presented in the following sections.

4.1 Phrase-table triangulation

Our emphasis is on building an enhanced phrase
table that incorporates the translation phrase tables
of different models. This combined phrase table
will be used by the decoder during translation.

Phrase table triangulation depends mainly on
phrase level combination of the two different
phrase based systems mainly source (src) - pivot
(pvt) and pivot (pvt) - target (tgt) using pivot lan-
guage as a basis for combination. Before stating
the mathematical approach for triangulation, we
present an example.

4.1.1 Basic methodology
Suppose we have a Bengali-Hindi phrase-table
(TBH) and a Hindi-Marathi phrase-table (THM).
From these tables, we have to construct a Bengali-
Marathi phrase-table (TBM). For that we need

Table 2: Comparison between triangulated systems in systems with full phrase table and the other having
top 40 phrase-table entries

to estimate four feature functions: phrase trans-
lation probabilities for both directions φ(b̄|m̄)
and φ(m̄|b̄), and lexical translation probabilities
for both directions lex(b̄|m̄) and lex(m̄|b̄) where
b̄ and m̄ are Bengali and Marathi phrases that
will appear in our triangulated Bengali-Marathi
phrase-table TBM.

φ(b̄|m̄) =
∑

h̄∈TBH∩THM
φ(b̄|h̄)φ(h̄|m̄) (1)

φ(m̄|b̄) =
∑

h̄∈TBH∩THM
φ(m̄|h̄)φ(h̄|b̄) (2)

lex(b̄|m̄) =
∑

h̄∈TBH∩THM
lex(b̄|h̄)lex(h̄|m̄) (3)

lex(m̄|b̄) =
∑

h̄∈TBH∩THM
lex(m̄|h̄)lex(h̄|b̄) (4)

In these equations a conditional independence
assumption has been made that source phrase b̄
and target phrase m̄ are independent given their
corresponding pivot phrase(s) h̄. Thus, we can
derive φ(b̄|m̄), φ(m̄|b̄), lex(b̄|m̄), lex(m̄|b̄) by as-
suming that these probabilities are mutually inde-
pendent given a Hindi phrase h̄.

The equation given requires that all phrases in
the Hindi-Marathi bitext must also be present in
the Bengali-Hindi bitext. Clearly there would be
many phrases not following the above require-
ment. For this paper we completely discarded the
missing phrases. One important point to note is
that although the problem of missing contextual
phrases is uncommon in multi-parallel corpora, as
it is in our case, it becomes more evident when the
bitexts are taken out from different sources.

In general, wider range of possible translations
are found for any source phrase through triangula-
tion. We found that in the direct model, a source
phrase is aligned to three phrases then there is
high possibility of it being aligned to three phrases
in intermediate language. The intermediate lan-
guage phrases are further aligned to three or more
phrases in target language. This results in increase
in number of translations of each source phrase.

4.1.2 Reducing the size of phrase-table

While triangulation is intuitively appealing, it suf-
fers from a few problems. First, the phrasal trans-
lation estimates are based on noisy automatic word
alignments. This leads to many errors and omis-
sions in the phrase-table. With a standard source-
target phrase-table these errors are only encoun-
tered once, however with triangulation they are en-
countered twice, and therefore the errors are com-
pounded. This leads to much noisier estimates
than in the source-target phrase-table. Secondly,
the increased exposure to noise means that trian-
gulation will omit a greater proportion of large or
rare phrases than the standard method. An align-
ment error in either of the source-intermediate bi-
text or intermediate-target bitext can prevent the
extraction of a source-target phrase pair.

As will be explained in the next section, the sec-
ond kind of problem can be ameliorated by using
the triangulated phrase-based table in conjunction
with the standard phrase based table referred to as
direct src-to-pvt phrase table in our case.

For the first kind of problem, not only the com-
pounding of errors leads to increased complex-
ity but also results in an absurdly large triangu-
lated phrase based table. To tackle the problem of
unwanted phrase-translation, we followed a novel
approach.

A general observation is that while triangulat-
ing between src-pvt and pvt-tgt systems, the re-
sultant src-tgt phrase table formed will be very
large since for a translation s̄ to ī in the src-to-
pvt table there may be many translations from
ī to t̄1, t̄2...t̄n. For example, the Bengali-Hindi
phrase-table(TBH) consisted of 846,106 transla-
tions and Hindi-Marathi phrase-table(THM) con-
sisted of 680,415 translations and after triangu-
lating these two tables our new Bengali-Marathi
triangulated table(TBM) consisted of 3,585,450
translations as shown in Table 2. Tuning with
such a large phrase-table is complex and time-
consuming. To reduce the complexity of the
phrase-table, we used only the top-40 transla-

87



tions (translation with 40 maximum values of
P (f̄ |ē) for every source phrase in our triangulated
phrase-table(TBM) which reduced the phrase table
to 1,086,528 translations.

We relied on P (f̄ |ē)(inverse phrase translation
probability) to choose 40 phrase translations for
each phrase, since in the direct model, MERT
training assigned the most weight to this param-
eter.

It is clearly evident from Table 2 that we have
got a massive reduction in the length of the phrase-
table after taking in our phrase table and still the
results have no significant difference in our output
models.

4.2 Combining different triangulated models
and the direct model

Combining Machine translation (MT) systems has
become an important part of Statistical MT in the
past few years. There have been several works by
(Rosti et al., 2007; Karakos et al., 2008; Leusch
and Ney, 2010);
We followed two approaches

1. A system combination based on confusion
network using open-source tool kit MANY
(Barrault, 2010), which can work dynami-
cally in combining the systems

2. Combine the models by linearly interpolating
them and then using MERT to tune the com-
bined system.

4.2.1 Combination based on confusion
matrix

MANY tool was used for this and initially it was
configured to work with TERp evaluation matrix,
but we modified it to work using METEOR-Hindi
(Gupta et al., 2010), as it has been shown by
(Kalyani et al., 2014), that METEOR evaluation
metric is closer to human evaluation for morpho-
logically rich Indian Languages.

4.2.2 Linearly Interpolated Models
We used two different approaches while merging
the different triangulated models and direct src-tgt
model and we observed that both produced com-
parable results in most cases. We implemented the
linear mixture approach, since linear mixtures of-
ten outperform log-linear ones (Cohn and Lapata,
2007). Note that in our combination approaches
the reordering tables were left intact.

1. Our first approach was to use linear interpola-
tion to combine all the three models (Bangla-
Hin-Marathi, Bangla-Guj-Marathi and di-
rect Bangla-Marathi models) with uniform
weights, i.e 0.3 each in our case.

2. In the next approach, the triangulated phrase
tables are combined first into a single trian-
gulated phrase-table using uniform weights.
The combined triangulated phrase-table and
direct src-tgt phrase table is then combined
using uniform weights. In other words, we
combined all the three systems, Ban-Mar,
Ban-Hin-Mar, and Ban-Guj-Mar with 0.5,
0.25 and 0.25 weights respectively. This
weight distribution reflects the intuition that
the direct model is less noisy than the trian-
gulated models.

In the experiments below, both weight settings
produced comparable results. Since we performed
triangulation only through two languages, we
could not determine which approach would per-
form better. An ideal approach will be to train the
weights for each system for each language pair
using standard tuning algorithms such as MERT
(Zaidan, 2009).

4.2.3 Choosing Combination Approach
In order to compare the approaches on our data,
we performed experiments on Hindi-Marathi pair
following both approaches discussed in Section
4.2.1 and 4.2.2. We also generated triangulated
models through Bengali and Gujarati as pivot lan-
guages.

Also, the approach presented in section 4.2.1
depends heavily on LM (Language Model).In or-
der to study the impact of size, we worked on
training Phrase-based SMT systems with subsets
of data in sets of 5000, 10000, 150000 sentences
and LM was trained for 28000 sentences for com-
paring these approaches. The combination results
were compared following the approach mentioned
in 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.

Table 3, shows that the approach discussed in
4.2.1 works better if there is more data for LM
but we suffer from the limitation that there is no
other in-domain data available for these languages.
From the Table, it can also be seen that combin-
ing systems with the approach explained in 4.2.2
can also give similar or better results if there is
scarcity of data for LM. Therefore we followed the

approach from Section 4.2.2 for our experiments
on other language pairs.

5 Observation and Resuslts

Table 4, shows the BLEU scores of triangulated
models when using the two languages out of the
4 Indian languages Hin, Guj, Mar, Ban as source
and target and the remaining two as the pivot lan-
guage. The first row mentions the BLEU score
of the direct src-tgt model for all the language
pairs. The second and third rows provide the tri-
angulated model scores through pivots which have
been listed. The fourth and fifth rows show the
BLEU scores for the combined models (triangu-
lated+direct) with the combination done using the
first and second approach respectively that have
been elucidated in the Section 4.2.2

As expected, both the combined models have
performed better than the direct models in all
cases.

Figure 1: Phrase-table coverage of the evaluation
set for all the language pairs

Figure 1, shows the phrase-table coverage of the

evaluation set for all the language pairs. Phrase-
table coverage is defined as the percentage of un-
igrams in the evaluation set for which translations
are present in the phrase-table. The first bar cor-
responds to the direct model for each language
pair, the second and third bars show the cover-
age for triangulated models through the 2 piv-
ots, while the fourth bar is the coverage for the
combined model (direct+triangulated). The graph
clearly shows that even though the phrase table
coverage may increase or decrease by triangula-
tion through a single pivot the combined model
(direct+triangulated) always gives a higher cover-
age than the direct model.

Moreover, there exists some triangulation mod-
els whose coverage and subsequent BLEU scores
for translation is found to be better than that of the
direct model. This is a particularly interesting ob-
servation as it increases the probability of obtain-
ing better or at least comparable translation mod-
els even when direct source-target parallel corpus
is absent.

6 Discussion

Dravidian languages are different from Indo-aryan
languages but they are closely related amongst
themselves. So we explored similar experiments
with Malayalam-Telugu pair of languages with
similar parallel data and with Hindi as pivot.

The hypothesis was that the direct model for
Malayalam-Telegu would have performed better
due to relatedness of the two languages. However
the results via Hindi were better as can be seen in
Table 5.

As Malayalam-Telegu are comparatively closer
than compared to Hindi, so the results via Hindi
should have been worse but it seems more like a
biased property of training data which considers
that all languages are closer to Hindi, as the trans-
lation data was created from Hindi.

7 Future Work

It becomes increasingly important for us to im-
prove these techniques for such languages having
rare corpora. The technique discussed in the paper
is although efficient but still have scope for im-
provements.

As we have seen from our two approaches of
combining the phrase tables and subsequent in-
terpolation with direct one, the best combination
among the two is also not fixed. If we can find the

then we can see improvement in translation. This
can be implemented by making the machine learn
from various iterations of combining and adjusting
the scores accordingly.(Nakov and Ng, 2012) have
indeed shown that results show significant devia-
tions associated with different weights assigned to
the tables.
