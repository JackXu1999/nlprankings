Abstract

This paper explores modern word embeddings
in the context of sound symbolism. Using ba-
sic properties of the representations space one
can construct semantic axes. A method is pro-
posed to measure if the presence of individual
sounds in a given word shifts its semantics of
that word along a specific axis. It is shown
that, in accordance with several experimental
and statistical results, word embeddings cap-
ture symbolism for certain sounds.

1 Introduction

Sound symbolism is a term used to describe a
hypothetical relation between sound and mean-
ing (Hinton et al., 2006). This idea recurrently
emerges in various cultures and languages dating
as far back as Plato’s Cratylus. Statements on
sound symbolism can also be found in Japanese
Buddhist monk Kukai’s work Sound, word, reality
(Kasulis, 1982). Upanishads contain a good deal
of material about sound symbolism, for example,
declaring that ”the mute consonants represent the
earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven”
(Max-Muller, 1879). Early in the twentieth cen-
tury, the rise of artistic symbolism and a gen-
eral interest in form, as developed in (Shklovsky,
1919) and (Kruchenykh, 1923) gave rise to sev-
eral artistic movements. (Sapir, 1929) made the
first systematic attempt to find empirical evidence
of sound symbolism.

To our knowledge, the issue of sound symbol-
ism has still not been studied from the represen-
tation learning perspective. This submission ad-
dresses the question of whether some aspects of
sound symbolism can be captured by the FastText
embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2016)1. We show

reason why other embeddings that to a certain extent support
semantic arithmetic can not be used for this task.

that the representations do seem to capture the
sound symbolism of the English language to the
extent that it is covered by the research literature.
We also discuss the potential usage of such repre-
sentations in the future, particularly for generative
tasks.

Despite the fact, that sound symbolism is a rel-
atively old theoretical notion, until the second
half of the twentieth century there were only a
few empirical results that would definitively prove
it’s existence in natural languages. More re-
cently, (Whissell, 1999) has shown that certain
sounds tend to be over-represented in songs or
poetry to address specific emotions, but also in
names (Whissell, 2006). (Shinohara and Kawa-
hara, 2010) have demonstrated that certain sounds
in the English language are associated with at-
tributes of size. (Wrembel, 2010) has addressed
the role of sound symbolism in language acqui-
sition. (Perniss et al., 2010) provide evidence
for non-arbitrary relationships at multiple levels
of language, from phonology to syntax. (Adel-
man et al., 2018) have shown that specific sounds
in English or Spanish are associated with higher
levels of valence or emotional sound symbolism.
Even more impressively, in a massive study across
nearly two-thirds of the world’s languages (Blasi
et al., 2016) managed to demonstrate that a con-
siderable proportion of 100 essential vocabulary
items carry strong associations with specific kinds
of human speech sounds, occurring persistently
across continents and linguistic lineages.

More importantly for this work, (Otis and Sagi,
2008) have introduced a corpus-based method that
can be used to test whether an association between
sound and meaning exists within a given corpus.
This result was partially reproduced in (Abramova



91

et al., 2013), who also showed that the seman-
tic content of at least some phonesthemes could
be identified automatically using WordNet. Fi-
nally, (Auracher et al., 2010) have demonstrated
the potential of sound symbolism for automatic
text analysis. Their study claims that, at least in
poetic language, the ratio of plosive versus nasal
sounds in a text predicts its emotional tone as read-
ers perceive. In other words, poems that have a rel-
atively high frequency of plosive sounds are more
likely to express a pleasant mood with high activa-
tion, whereas a relatively high frequency of nasal
sounds indicates an unpleasant mood with low ac-
tivation.

3 Sound symbolism in word
representations

Semantic arithmetic is one of the key features of
Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and other mod-
ern vector representations. This property allows us
to subtract a vector that corresponds to the word
’male’ from the vector that represents the word
’king’. We can then add vector that represents
’female’ to obtain a new vector in the proximity
of representation for the word ’queen.’ Using se-
mantic arithmetic one can naturally form certain
semantic axes in the space of representations. To
do this, we can list a pair of antonyms, say ’good’
and ’bad,’ and draw a line defined by these two
words. We can expect that, up to a certain level of
correspondence, the projections of other word rep-
resentations on this axis will correspond with their
semantic relation to one of the two attributes. To
make such semantic lines more robust, we defined
the opposing semantic points as an average of sev-
eral synonyms for each of the two words that were
forming a semantic axis. The full list of the axes
that were tested can be found in the Appendix. The
English phonetics of the words was retrieved from
a proprietary dictionary.

To test whether word embeddings capture cer-
tain elements of sound symbolism, we have car-
ried the following experiment:

• out of pretrained FastText word embeddings
10 000 most frequent words were filtered;

• the representations of the words were pro-
jected on every semantic axis;

• the obtained distribution of the projections
for the words that start with a given sound

tions for the words without it.

Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the results that
were obtained with p-values below 0.001 and 0.01
respectively. Figures 1 - 3 show examples of
the obtained distributions for different axes and
sounds.

4 Discussion

As we can see from Table 1 and Table 2, there
are several sounds which have a specific sym-
bolic aspect that is in line with some of the pre-
vious empiric results. There are also new sound-
semantic associations which have not been stud-
ied in the context of sound symbolism and could
potentially be interesting for further empirical in-
vestigations. Such cases have been flagged with
a question mark. The sound [I] is the only sound
which contradicts some of the previous findings.
It might be associated with something ugly, sad or

difficult according to our results, yet it is placed in
the category of mildly positive valence in (Adel-
man et al., 2018). It could also be associated with
something dark, which is in line with (Wrembel,
2010), but contradicts (Adelman et al., 2018). Fur-
ther examination is needed to give a definitive an-
swer as to the reason for this contradiction, but the
most probable explanations can be summed up as
follows: (Adelman et al., 2018) show that [I] is
associated with valence with a p-value above 0.1,
and the predictive power of phonemes for valence
in English is the lowest out of four languages stud-
ied in the paper. This probably means that the sig-
nal is too low to give a definitive answer about this
sound. What is more interesting is that the method
we used also points out several new sounds that
might have a symbolic component, but have not
been closely studied before. For example, [9] in
the context of difficulty, speed, activity and mood,
[m] in the contexts of femininity, roughness and
length, or [k] in context of safety.

5 Conclusion

This paper shows that word embeddings such as
Fasttext can capture sound symbolism along sev-
eral semantic axes. Applying the obtained sound
symbolism information to generative tasks, one
can expect to generate more expressive poetry in
line with the results of (Auracher et al., 2010).
This new approach combined with such generative
methods as (Potash et al., 2016), (Tikhonov and
Yamshchikov, 2018), (Vechtomova et al., 2018)
or (Wołk et al., 2019). The possibility of testing
specific associations between sounds and seman-
tics computationally without any behavioral labo-
ratory experiments or surveys might also signifi-
cantly facilitate further studies of semantic sym-
bolism. Additional research questions that nat-
urally arise from this result include cross-lingual
studies of sound symbolism captured by word em-
beddings and experimental research of the poten-
tial connections between sounds and semantics.
