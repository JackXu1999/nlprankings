Abstract

This paper describes the development of
the first syntactically-annotated corpus of
Welsh within the Universal Dependencies
(UD) project. We explain how the corpus
was prepared, and some Welsh-specific
constructions that require attention. The
treebank currently contains 10 756 tokens.
An 10-fold cross evaluation shows that
results of both, tagging and dependency
parsing, are similar to other treebanks of
comparable size, notably the other Celtic
language treebanks within the UD project.

1 Introduction

The Welsh Treebank is the third Celtic language
within the Universal Dependencies project (Nivre
et al., 2016), after Irish (Lynn and Foster, 2016)
and Breton (Tyers and Ravishankar, 2018). The
main goal of the Universal Dependencies tree-
banks is to have many different languages anno-
tated with identical guidelines and universally de-
fined set of universal POS tags and dependency
relations. These cross-linguistically consistent
grammatical annotations can be used, for instance,
for typological language comparison or develop-
ping and evaluating cross-linguistic tagging and
parsing tools.

The motivation was twofold: To have a Welsh
treebank annotated using the same guidelines as
many existing treebanks which permits language
comparison and to have a (start for a) treebank
which can be used to train dependency parsers.
Since the UD project already contains 146 tree-
banks for 83 languages and provides annotation

principles which have been used in typological
very different languages, we chose to develop the
Welsh treebank within the UD project. At the time
of writing 601 sentences with 10 756 tokens in to-
tal have been annotated and released with UD ver-
sion 2.4.

The paper is laid out as follows: in Section 2 we
give a short typological overview of Welsh. Sec-
tion 3 describes briefly prior work for Welsh in
computational linguistics and syntax as well as ex-
isting resources. In sections 4 and 5 we describe
the annotated corpus, the preprocessing steps and
present some particularities of Welsh and how we
annotate them. Section 6 explains the validation
process. We conclude with a short evaluation in
section 7 and some remarks on future work (sec-
tion 8).

2 Welsh

Welsh is a Celtic language of the Brythonic
branch1 of the Insular Celtic languages. There
are about 500 000 (Jones, 2012) native speakers
in Wales (United Kingdom). Apart from very
young children, all speakers are bilingual with En-
glish. There are also a few thousand Welsh speak-
ers in the province of Chubut, in Argentina, who
are the descendants of Welsh emigrants of the
1850s, who are now all bilingual with Spanish. A
short overview on the Welsh Grammar is given in
Thomas (1992) and Thorne (1992), more detailed
information can be found in Thorne (1993) and
King (2003).

Even though Welsh is a close cognate to Bre-
ton (and Cornish), it is different from a typologi-
cal point of view. Like Breton (and the Celtic lan-
guages of the Goidelic branch), it has initial conso-

nant mutations, inflected prepositions (ar “on”, ar-
naf i “on me”), genitive constructions with a single
determiner (tŷ’r frenhines, lit. “house the queen”:
“the house of the queen”) and impersonal verb
forms. However, unlike Breton, Welsh has a pre-
dominantly verb-subject-object (VSO) word order,
does not have composed tenses with an auxiliary
corresponding to “have” and uses extensively pe-
riphrastic verbal clauses to convey tense and aspect
(Heinecke, 1999). It has only verbnouns instead
of infinitives (direct objects become genitive mod-
ifiers or possessives). Like Irish but unlike Bre-
ton Welsh does not have a verb “to have” to con-
very possession. It uses a preposition “with” in-
stead: Mae dau fachgen gen i “I have two sons”,
lit. “There is two son(SG) with me”. Another fea-
ture of Welsh is the vigesimal number system (at
least in the formal registers of the language) and
non-contiguous numerals (tri phlentyn ar hugain
“23 children”, lit. “three child(SG) on twenty”).

3 Related Work

Welsh has been the object of research in compu-
tational linguistics, notably for speech recognition
and speech synthesis (Williams, 1999; Williams
et al., 2006; Williams and Jones, 2008), as
well as spell checking and machine translation.
An overview can be found in Heinecke (2005),
more detailed information about existing language
technology for Welsh is accessible at http://
techiaith.cymru. Research on Welsh syntax
within various frameworks is very rich: Awbery
(1976), Rouveret (1990), Sadler (1998), Sadler
(1999), Roberts (2004), Borsley et al. (2007),
Tallerman (2009), Borsley (2010) to cite a few.

The only available annotated corpus to our
knowledge is Cronfa Electroneg o Gymraeg (CEG)
(Ellis et al., 2001), which contains about one mil-
lion tokens, annotated with POS and lemmas. The
CEG corpus contains texts from novels and short
stories, religious texts and non-fictional texts in the
fields of education, science, business or leisure ac-
tivities. It also contains texts from newspapers and
magazines and some transcribed spoken Welsh.

Currently work is under way for the National
Corpus of Contemporary Welsh2. It is a very large
corpus which contains spoken and written Welsh.
currently the existing data is not annotated in syn-
tax (dependency or other). Members of the Cor-
CenCC project also work on WordNet Cymraeg,
2http://www.corcencc.org/

a Welsh version of WordNet. Further corpora (in-
cluding CEG) are available at University of Ban-
gor’s Canolfan Bedwyr 3.

Other important resources are the proceedings
of the Third Welsh Assembly4 and Eurfa, a
full form dictionary5 with about 10 000 lemmas
(210 578 forms). There is also the full form list for
Welsh of the Unimorph project6. Currently, how-
ever, this list contains only 183 lemmas (10 641
forms).

The Welsh treebank is comparable in size to the
Breton treebank (10 348 tokens, 888 sentences).
The Irish treebank is twice as big with 23 964 to-
kens (1 020 sentences). UD treebanks vary very
much in size. Currently the largest UD treebank
is the German-HDT with 3 055 010 tokens. The
smallest is Tagalog with just 292 words. Average
size for all treebanks is 150 827 tokens, median
size is 43 754 tokens.

4 Corpus

Like every language, Welsh has formal and in-
formal registers. All of those are written, which
makes it difficult to constitute a homogeneous cor-
pus. The differences are not only a question of
style, but are also of morphological and some-
times of syntactic nature. Usually for the writ-
ten language distinction is made between Liter-
ary Welsh (cf. grammars by Williams (1980) and
Thomas (1996)) and Colloquial Welsh (Uned Iaith
Genedlaethol (1978)) including an attempted new
standard, Cymraeg Byw “Living Welsh” (Educa-
tion Department, 1964; Davies, 1988)). Cymraeg
Byw, however, has fallen out of fashion since. For
the UD Welsh treebank, we chose sentences of
Colloquial written Welsh.

The sentences of the initial version of the tree-
bank have been taken from varying sources, like
the Welsh language Wikipedia, mainly from pages
on items about Wales, like on the Urdd Gobaith
Cymru, the Eisteddfodau or Welsh places, since it
is much more probable that native Welsh speakers
contributed to these pages. Other sources for indi-
vidual sentences were the Welsh Assembly corpus
mentioned above, Welsh Grammars (in order to
cover syntactic structures less frequently seen) or

web sites from Welsh institutions (Welsh Universi-
ties, Cymdeithas yr Iaith). Finally some sentences
origin from Welsh language media (Y Golwg, BBC
Cymru) and blogs. Even though a few of the sen-
tences from Wikipedia may look awkward or in-
correct to native speakers, these sentences are the
reality of written Welsh and are therefore included
in the treebank.

The different registers of Welsh mean, that theo-
retically “identical” forms may appear in diverging
surface representations: so the very formal yr yd-
wyf i “I am” (lit. “(affirmative) am I”) can take
the following (more or less contracted) forms in
written Welsh: rydwyf (i), rydwi, rydw (i), dwi.
In the treebank, we annotate these forms as multi-
token words. For layout reasons, we do not split
these forms in all examples in this paper. Where
it is the case, we mark multi-token words with a
box around the corresponding words. The same
applies for the negation particle ni(d) which is of-
ten contracted with the following form of bod, if
the latter has an initial vowel: nid oedd “(he) was
not” > doedd. Sometimes dialectal variants appear
in the Written language: oeddan vs oedden “(we)
were”. The corpus of the Welsh treebank retains
the original forms. However, we use standard lem-
mas (Thomas and Bevan, 1950 2002).

4.1 Preprocessing

In order to initiate and to speed up the annotation
process, we transformed the CEG corpus (forms,
lemmas and POS) into UD’s CoNLL-U format (cf.
figure 1) and replaced CEG’s part-of-speech tags
into UD UPOS. During this step we also corrected
annotation errors (notably non-ambiguous cases)
and added information about which consonant mu-
tation is present, if any. We then used the Eu-
rfa full-form dictionary to enrich the CoNLL-U
format with morpho-syntactic features. On this
UD compatible Welsh corpus, we trained the UD-
pipe tagger and lemmatizer (Straka and Straková,
2017) using word embeddings for Welsh trained
on the Welsh Wikipedia with FastText and pro-
vided by Bojanowski et al. (2017). With this model
we POS-tagged our corpus. A second script pre-
annotated some basic dependency relations (case-
and det relations).

In addition to the UD standard, we defined lan-
guage specific XPOS (table 1), a morphological
feature Mutation with three values to indicate
the consonant mutation, since they carry syntac-

tically relevant information, and some subtypes
for dependency relations, also frequently used in
other languages: acl:relcl (relative clauses) and
flat:name (flat structures for multi-word named
entities).

NOUN noun, verbnoun
PRON contr, dep, indp, intr, pron, refl, rel
PROPN org, person, place, propn, work

Table 1: Welsh specific XPOS

5 Dependencies

The POS-tagged corpus was then manually an-
notated7 and all layers were validated: lemmas,
UPOS, XPOS (see section 5), and dependency re-
lations using the annotation guidelines of Univer-
sal Dependencies. The annotation were made by a
single annotator.

The following subsections discuss some of the
particularities of the Welsh language, and how
these were annotated.

5.1 Nominal genitive construction

Similar to the other Celtic languages, but also
to genetically very different languages like Ara-
bic, nominal genitive constructions are juxtaposed
nounphrases. Only the last nounphrase can have a
determiner (article, possessive), which determines
the whole construction (fig. 2).

5.2 Periphrastic verbal construction
The verb can be seen as the central word in de-
pendency syntax. Since the Welsh verb has only
two tenses in the indicative mood (Future and Past,
both denoting perfective aspect), all other tense
and aspect forms are built using periphrastic con-
structions using one or more forms of the verb-
noun bod “to be”. Whereas inflected verbs (fig. 3)
are annotated in a straight forward way, the pe-
riphrastic forms need some attention.

obj
oblroot

“I saw him on Channel 4”

Figure 3: Inflected verb

As said before, Welsh has no infinitives, but
verbnouns, which mark objects differently com-
pared to inflected verbs. Whereas in English a di-
rect object is the same (I saw him; to see him),
in Welsh the inflected form uses a different pro-
noun series (called independent pronouns in Welsh
grammar tradition) than the verbnoun. Note that
Welsh does not distinguish between subject and
object pronouns, but between independent and de-
pendent pronouns. The former are used in sub-
ject and object position of inflected verbs, the lat-
ter for possessives and “object” relations on verb-
nouns, e.g. ei gar “his car” or mark the direct
object for verbnouns ei gweld literally “his see-
ing”, e.g. “to see him”. For this reason, verbnouns
have a different language specific XPOS (verbnoun
8+NM means that this word triggers soft mutation on the fol-
lowing word, NM- means that this word undergoes nasal mu-
tation. Similarly we use SM and AM for soft and aspirated
mutation, respectively. For more details on mutations, see
King (2003, pp. 14ff). Some mutations are triggered by syn-
tactic functions and not by a preceding word, e.g. temporal
and spatial adverbials or undefinite direct objects.
9Dependency relations in gray are irrelevant for the point
made in the example.

vs. noun) but the same UPOS (NOUN) as nouns.
Other treebanks in the UD project with verbnouns
do the same (notably Irish and, in some well de-
fined, cases Polish). The periphrastic construction
(fig. 4) employs at least one (inflected) form of bod
(here ydw) and a time or aspect marker (TAM) like
yn or wedi etc. The (independent) pronoun after
the verbnoun (VN) is facultative and repeats the
(dependent) pronoun before the verbnoun gweld
(here undergone soft mutated to weld).

(lit. “I am (impf) his seeing he”)

Figure 4: Periphrastic construction

The same annotation can be found in the Irish
treebank (fig. 5). In the Breton treebank, however,
the infinitive is the phrasal head (6) to which the
auxiliary verb is attached as an aux.

Figure 7: Nested periphrastic construction

If a periphrastic phrase is used as a subordinate,
even the head (bod) is a verbnoun and the subject is
marked using the dependent (possessive) pronoun
(fig. 8, next page).

In Welsh the main (semantic) time (past,
present, future) is nearly always expressed as a
form of bod. Relative time positions (before or
after) are marked using other TAM markers (ar,
am (posteriority, “about to”), wedi (anteriority, cf.
English Present/Past Perfect), hen (distant anteri-
ority), newydd (recent anteriority, cf. Heinecke
(1999, p. 271)). We have decided to use the in-
flected form of bod as the syntactic head and link
the subsequent verbnoun bod and finally the verb-
noun carrying the meaning with as xcomp to avoid
completely flat trees which do not show the inher-
ent structure of these phrases.

5.3 Subjects in subordinate phrases

Subordinate phrases very often do not have in-
flected verbs, but use TAM or prepositions to es-
tablish a relative time with respect to the main
phrase. In these cases the subject has a case de-
pendant (preposition i “to”, cf. fig. 9 next page,

10HM: Breton hard mutation

where the preposition is inflected and appears as
iddo).

5.4 Impersonal and cael-periphrastics

Like the other Celtic languages Welsh has imper-
sonal forms (which are often translated using pas-
sives). In this construction the demoted agent can
be expressed using the preposition gan “with”. As
in the Irish and Breton treebanks, the core argu-
ment of an Impersonal is marked obj (fig. 10). A
periphrastic construction is possible using the verb
cael “get” (fig. 11).

5.5 Nonverbal predicates

Like in most other languages, adjectives and nouns
can be head, if they are the predicate. In Welsh,
however, such adjectives and nouns need a special
predication marker yn11 (fig. 12 and 13).

11There are three forms yn in Welsh with tree different func-
tions: 1) predicative marker preceding nominal and adjectival
predicates, 2) imperfective marker (Isaac, 1994), which pre-
cedes a verbnoun (cf. fig. 4), and 3) preposition “in” which
triggers nasal mutation). The first two are shortened to ’n if
the preceding word terminates with a vowel.

The predication marker yn + adjective is also
used to have adverbs on verbnouns (fig. 14). In
subordinates, the copula bod becomes a verbnoun,
the subject is attached as possessive using a depen-
dent pronoun (fig. 15, next page).
12In Welsh dictionaries the predicative yn is tagged as an ad-
verb.

5.6 Inflected prepositions

All Celtic languages have contracted forms of
prepositions and following pronouns. In Welsh,
the pronoun can follow the contracted preposition,
so it is more adequate to speak of inflected prepo-
sitions instead (Morris-Jones (1913, p. 397), King
(2003, p. 268)). This requires a different annota-
tion, since the inflected prepositions (like gennyt
“with you” in fig. 16) incorporates the obl argu-
ment. The pronoun “you” is dropped.

Using empty nodes and enhanced dependencies,
the annotation of an inflected preposition without

pronoun (fig. 18). The current version of the Welsh
treebank is not yet annotated this way.

5.7 Compound numbers

The traditional Welsh numbering is based on a vi-
gesimal number system (20 = ugain, 30 = deg ar
hugain “ten on twenty”, 40 = deugain “two twen-
ties”, 60 = trigain “three twenties”). Notably for
compound numbers, the counted item comes be-
tween the units and the tens of the number, in both
cardinals (fig. 19, nouns are always in singular af-
ter a numeral) and ordinals (fig. 20).

Figure 20: Compound numbers (ordinals)

Breton and Irish use(d) a similar system. There
is one example in the Breton UD treebank (fig. 21),
which is annotated in a similar way apart from the
fact, that Breton uses coordination to join numbers
instead of a preposition, as Welsh does). Irish di-
alects traditionally have a similar structure, even
though none is attested in the UD treebank: dhá
bhád is ceithre fichid “82 boats” (lit. “two boat(sg)
and four twenty”).

6 Validation

After having all sentences annotated, a post-
validation script checked some semantic aspects
like the XPOS of inflected prepositions, TAM
markers, preverbal particles and consonant mu-
tations (adding the corresponding feature) and
looked for potential errors (e.g. a det with a VERB
head). This script also checked all forms of the
verb bod and completed morphological features.
For nouns and adjectives the script gives an alert if
it cannot determine number (on the base of regular
suffixes etc.). The final step is the validation script
provided by the UD project which finds formal er-
rors (e.g. dependants on words with a case or aux
relation).

Currently the Welsh treebank contains 601 sen-
tences with 10 756 tokens (including punctuation).
The average sentence length is 17,9 tokens (short-
est sentence: 4 tokens, longest sentence: 59 to-
kens, median length: 16 tokens). Since verbnouns
have the UPOS NOUN, 30.1% of all UPOS are
NOUN (table 2).

Table 2: relative frequency of (some) UPOS, XPOS

The relatively small number of tokens with
UPOS VERB is due to the fact that verbnouns have
the UPOS NOUN. This is relativized if we regard
the distribution of the XPOS: noun 21.3%, verbnoun
9.1% + verb 6.3% = 15.4% “verbs”.

by the UD guidelines are not used. These are
clf used for classifiers (absent in Welsh), orphan
(used to annotate ellipses), discourse (interjec-
tions) goeswith and reparandum used to correct
errors in spelling or tokenization (currently all sen-
tences in the treebank are correctly tokenised) and
dep, the default label, if no more specific relation
can be chosen).

7 Evaluation

Even though the treebank currently contains only
601 sentences, tests for tagging and dependency
parsing (table 6) show results comparable with
similar sized treebanks (Tyers and Ravishankar
(2018) report a LAS between 64.14% and 74.29%
for the Breton treebank, Zeman et al. (2018) men-
tion a LAS of 70.88 for Irish). We used Ud-
pipe (v2, single model for tagging and parsing).
Tests with Wikipedia embeddings (500 dimen-
sions) trained with fastText (Bojanowski et al.,
2017) did not improve the parsing. This might
be caused by the relatively small corpus on which
the embeddings have been trained (the Welsh
Wikipedia (April 2019) contains only 62MB of
compressed raw data (104 000 pages).

For the evaluation we split the 601 sentences
into training (80%), dev (10%) and test (10%) cor-
pora and performed a 10-fold cross evaluation. We
used the official CoNLL-2018 evaluation script14

to calculate all scores. Table 4 shows the results of
POS tagging and lemmatisation without and with
the Eurfa dictionary, and table 5 the results per
UPOS.

Table 4: results of POS tagging and lemmatisation (F-
measure

Nearly half of the word forms in the test corpus
are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with respect to the
training corpus. The dictionary provided roughly
half of the missing words. Thus a quarter of the
words in the test corpus remains OOV, which may
explain the unexpected low performance (UDpipe
switches off its guesser, if a dictionary is pro-
vided).

The results of dependency analysis are pre-
sented in table 6 using 3 of the standard metrics
for dependency parsing (Nivre and Fang, 2017),
Labelled Attachment Score (LAS, evaluates heads
and dependency labels) or Content Word LAS
(CLAS, as LAS, but only for dependency relations
of content words (excluding aux, cop, mark, det,
clf, case, cc).

We run four tests, a model trained solely on the
treebank, with dependencies parsed on the results
of the tagger, and dependencies parsed using gold
tags. The other two tests use the Eurfa dictionary
again. The better results of tagging with the full
form lexicon, also improves the dependency pars-
ing, if the parsing is done on predicted POS tags.
All three metrics increase accordingly.

8 Future Work

The most obvious work is to increase the number
of sentences annotated. The current 601 sentences
may be a start, but do not cover enough exam-
ples to train a robust dependency parser. Another
important problem is the absence of very formal

conll18/conll18_ud_eval.py

Welsh (as in the Bible (in its 1588 translation) and
some literary works) and of very informal written
Welsh (as is used by some Welsh bloggers). Since
Welsh is not one of the most widely learned lan-
guages, we plan adding glosses and translations to
the existing sentences.

With word embeddings becoming more impor-
tant, work on Welsh word embeddings is needed
too. We need to dig into cross-lingual approaches
too (e.g. with BERT, (Lample and Conneau, 2019)
or UDify (Kondratyuk, 2019)) and/or provide
much larger Welsh text corpora than Wikipedia to
train word embeddings.
