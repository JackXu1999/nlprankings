Abstract

Partee (1986) claimed without proof that
the function BE is the only homomor-
phism that makes the Partee triangle com-
mute. This paper shows that this claim is
incorrect unless “homomorphism” is un-
derstood as “complete homomorphism.” It
also shows that BE and A are the inverses
of each other on certain natural assump-
tions.

1 Introduction

In a famous and influential paper, Partee (1986)
discussed type-shifting operators for NP interpre-
tations, including lift, ident and BE:

lift = λxλP. P (x),

ident = λxλy. [y = x],

BE = λPλx.P(λy. [y = x]).

She pointed out that these operators satisfy the
equality BE ◦ lift = ident, so the following dia-
gram, now often referred to as the Partee triangle,
commutes.

Partee declared that BE is “natural” because of the
following two “facts.”

Fact 1. BE is a homomorphism from 〈〈e, t〉, t〉 to
〈e, t〉 viewed as Boolean structures, i.e.,

BE(P1 uP2) = BE(P1) u BE(P2),
BE(P1 tP2) = BE(P1) t BE(P2),

BE(¬P1) = ¬BE(P1).

Fact 2. BE is the unique homomorphism that
makes the diagram commute.

While Fact 1 is immediate, Fact 2 is not ob-
vious. Partee (1986) nevertheless did not give a
proof of Fact 2, but only a note saying, “Thanks to
Johan van Benthem for the fact, which he knows
how to prove but I don’t.” Meanwhile, van Ben-
them (1986) referred to Partee’s work and stated
Fact 2 on p. 68, but gave no proof either. Despite
this quite obscure exposition, because of the clas-
sic status of Partee’s and van Benthem’s work, I
suspect that many linguists take Fact 2 for granted
while unable to explain it. Not only is this unfortu-
nate, but it is actually as expected, because Fact 2
turns out to be not quite correct unless “homomor-
phism” is read as “complete homomorphism.” The
main purpose of this paper is to rectify this detri-
mental situation.

Van Benthem (1986) took the domain of entities
to be finite, writing, “Our general feeling is that
natural language requires the use of finite models
only” (p. 7). Fact 2 is indeed correct on this as-
sumption. However, natural language has pred-
icates like natural number whose extensions are
obviously infinite. Also, if we take the domain of
portions of matter in the sense of Link (1983) to be
a nonatomic join-semilattice, then the domain of
entities will surely be infinite, whether countable
or uncountable. It is a fact that a single sentence
of natural language, albeit only finitely long, can
talk about an infinite number of entities, as exem-
plified in (1).

(1) a. Every natural number is odd or even.
b. All water is wet. (Link, 1983)

Given this, it is linguistically unjustified to assume
the domain of entities to be finite. Since Partee
(1986) herself discussed Link (1983), she was cer-
tainly aware that the domain of entities might very

1



well be infinite, so it is unlikely that Partee fol-
lowed van Benthem about the size of the domain
of entities.

What difference does it make if the domain De
of entities is infinite, then? Fact 2 would be cor-
rect if “homomorphism” were read as “complete
homomorphism.” A complete Boolean homomor-
phism is a Boolean homomorphism that in addi-
tion preserves infinite joins and meets. It is clear
from the equalities given in Partee’s Fact 1 that
she did not mean complete homomorphism by the
word “homomorphism.” When De is finite, this
does not matter since in that case, D〈〈e,t〉,t〉 is also
finite, and consequently, every Boolean homo-
morphism from D〈〈e,t〉,t〉 is necessarily complete.
However, when De is infinite, so is D〈〈e,t〉,t〉,
and in that case, a Boolean homomorphism from
D〈〈e,t〉,t〉 can be incomplete, and “Fact” 2 turns out
to be false.

This paper essentially consists of extended
notes on Partee (1986). Section 2 shows that BE
is the unique complete homomorphism that makes
the Partee triangle commute and also that it is not
the unique homomorphism that does so if De is
infinite. Section 3 discusses why it is important
that BE is complete by examining its interaction
with A. Finally, Section 4 shows that A is special
among the many inverses of BE. The paper as-
sumes the reader’s basic familiarity with Boolean
algebras and does not provide definitions or ex-
planations of the technical terms that are used.
I would suggest Givant and Halmos (2009) as a
good general reference.

2 Uniqueness and Nonuniqueness Proofs

Since it is cumbersome to work with functions,
let’s adopt set talk. The operators lift, ident and
BE and the Partee triangle can be rendered as fol-
lows, where D = De is a nonempty set of entities
and ℘ denotes power set.1

lift = λx. {P ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ P},
ident = λx. {x},
BE = λP. {x ∈ D | {x} ∈P}.

1Here and below, λ’s are used merely to describe func-
tions; they are not meant to be symbols in a logical language
that are to be interpreted.

Theorem 1. BE is a complete homomorphism
from ℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D).

Proof. It suffices to show that BE preserves arbi-
trary unions and complements (denoted by c). If
{Pi}i∈I is an arbitrary family in ℘(℘(D)),

BE
(⋃

i∈I
Pi
)
=
{
x ∈ D

∣∣ {x} ∈
⋃

i∈I
Pi
}

=
⋃

i∈I
{x ∈ D | {x} ∈Pi}

=
⋃

i∈I
BE(Pi).

For all P ∈ ℘(℘(D)),

BE(Pc) = {x ∈ D | {x} ∈Pc}
= {x ∈ D | {x} /∈P}
= {x ∈ D | {x} ∈P}c

= BE(P)c.

Lemma 2. Let h be a homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D). The following conditions are
equivalent.

(i) h = BE.

(ii) For all x ∈ D and all P ∈ ℘(℘(D)), if
x ∈ h(P) then {x} ∈P .

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii). Obvious since x ∈ BE(P) iff
{x} ∈P .

(ii)⇒ (i). We show the contrapositive. Suppose
h 6= BE, so there exists some P ∈ ℘(℘(D)) such
that

h(P) 6= BE(P) = {x ∈ D | {x} ∈P}.

Then, either there is some a ∈ D such that a ∈
h(P) and {a} /∈ P or there is some a ∈ D such
that a /∈ h(P) and {a} ∈ P . In the latter case,
we have a ∈ h(P)c = h(Pc) and {a} /∈ Pc.
Thus, in either case, (ii) does not hold.

Lemma 3. Let h be a homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that h ◦ lift = ident. For
any nonsingleton set P ∈ ℘(D), h({P}) = ∅.

2



Proof. We first show that h({∅}) = ∅. As-
sume that there exists some a ∈ h({∅}). Since
∅ /∈ lift(a), we have {∅} ⊆ lift(a)c. Since h is a
homomorphism and hence preserves order,

h({∅}) ⊆ h(lift(a)c)
= h(lift(a))c

= (h ◦ lift)(a)c

= ident(a)c

= {a}c,

so a /∈ h({∅}), a contradiction.
Next, we show that h({P}) = ∅ if |P | ≥ 2.

Assume that for some P with |P | ≥ 2, there exists
some a ∈ h({P}). Since |P | ≥ 2, there is some
b ∈ P with b 6= a. Since P ∈ lift(b) and hence
{P} ⊆ lift(b), we have

h({P}) ⊆ h(lift(b))
= (h ◦ lift)(b)
= ident(b)

= {b}.

Since a ∈ h({P}), we obtain b = a, a contradic-
tion.

Theorem 4. BE is the unique complete homomor-
phism that makes the Partee triangle commute.

Proof. To see that BE makes the Partee triangle
commute, observe that for any a ∈ D,

BE(lift(a))

= {x ∈ D | {x} ∈ lift(a)}
= {x ∈ D | {x} ∈ {P ∈ ℘(D) | a ∈ P}}
= {x ∈ D | a ∈ {x}}
= {x ∈ D | x = a}
= {a}
= ident(a).

Now, let h be a complete homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that h ◦ lift = ident. We
show that h = BE. Let a ∈ D and P ∈ ℘(℘(D))
satisfy a ∈ h(P). By Lemma 2, it is sufficient
to show that {a} ∈ P . Since h is a complete

homomorphism,

⋃
P∈P ∩ lift(a)

h({P}) = h
(⋃

P∈P ∩ lift(a)
{P}

)

= h(P ∩ lift(a))
= h(P) ∩ h(lift(a))
= h(P) ∩ ident(a)
= h(P) ∩ {a}
= {a}.

It follows that for some P ∈P ∩ lift(a),

h({P}) = {a}.

By Lemma 3, P must be a singleton set. Since the
only singleton set contained in lift(a) is {a}, we
have {a} = P ∈P ∩ lift(a), so {a} ∈P .

Note that Theorem 4 immediately follows from
Keenan and Faltz’s (1985) Justification Theorem
(p. 92) as well. Individuals in Keenan and Faltz’s
theory can be identified with the elements of the
set {Ix | x ∈ D}, where Ix = lift(x). Given a
function f from the set of individuals into ℘(D)
such that f(Ix) = ident(x) for all x ∈ D, the Jus-
tification Theorem says that there exists a unique
complete homomorphism from ℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D)
that extends f .

When D is finite, a homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) is necessarily a complete ho-
momorphism, so by Theorem 4, BE is automat-
ically the unique homomorphism that makes the
Partee triangle commute. This is not the case,
however, when D is infinite. To consider such
cases, the following lemma plays an important
role of giving (unique) representations of homo-
morphisms that make the Partee triangle commute.

Lemma 5. Let h be a function from ℘(℘(D)) into
℘(D). The following conditions are equivalent.

(i) h is a homomorphism from ℘(℘(D)) to
℘(D) and h ◦ lift = ident.

(ii) There is a family {Ux}x∈D of subsets of
℘(℘(D)) such that each Ux is an ultrafilter
in the Boolean algebra ℘(lift(x)) satisfying
lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for all y 6= x, and

h = λP. {x ∈ D |P ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux}.

Proof. (i)⇒ (ii). Assume (i). For each x ∈ D, let

Ux = {P ∈ ℘(lift(x)) | x ∈ h(P)}.

3



To begin with, we show that Ux is an ultrafil-
ter in the Boolean algebra ℘(lift(x)). First, since
x ∈ {x} = ident(x) = h(lift(x)), the top ele-
ment lift(x) of ℘(lift(x)) belongs to Ux. Second,
if P,Q ∈ Ux, then x ∈ h(P) and x ∈ h(Q)
and hence x ∈ h(P) ∩ h(Q) = h(P ∩ Q),
so P ∩ Q ∈ Ux. Third, if P ∈ Ux and Q ∈
℘(lift(x)) satisfy P ⊆ Q, then x ∈ h(P) ⊆
h(Q), so Q ∈ Ux. This establishes that Ux is
a filter in ℘(lift(x)). To see that Ux is an ultra-
filter, suppose P ∈ ℘(lift(x)) and P /∈ Ux.
Since x ∈ h(lift(x)) = h(P ∪ (Pc ∩ lift(x))) =
h(P) ∪ h(Pc ∩ lift(x)) and x /∈ h(P), we have
x ∈ h(Pc ∩ lift(x)), so Pc ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux. Thus,
the complement of P in ℘(lift(x)) belongs to Ux.

Next, observe that if lift(x) ∩ lift(y) ∈ Ux, then
x ∈ h(lift(x) ∩ lift(y)) = h(lift(x)) ∩ h(lift(y)),
so x ∈ h(lift(y)) = ident(y) = {y} and therefore
x = y. It follows that lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for all
y 6= x. This establishes that the family {Ux}x∈D
has the desired properties.

Now, for all P ∈ ℘(℘(D)), we have
h(P ∩ lift(x)c) ⊆ h(lift(x)c)

= h(lift(x))c

= ident(x)c

= {x}c,
so x /∈ h(P ∩ lift(x)c). It follows that

x ∈ h(P)
iff x ∈ h((P ∩ lift(x)) ∪ (P ∩ lift(x)c))
iff x ∈ h(P ∩ lift(x)) ∪ h(P ∩ lift(x)c)
iff x ∈ h(P ∩ lift(x))
iff P ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux.

Thus h(P) = {x ∈ D |P ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux}.
(ii) ⇒ (i). Assume (ii). To show that h is a

homomorphism, it suffices to check that it pre-
serves finite union and complement. Being an ul-
trafilter, Ux is a prime filter. Therefore, for all
P,Q ∈ ℘(℘(D)),

x ∈ h(P ∪Q)
iff (P ∪Q) ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux
iff (P ∩ lift(x)) ∪ (Q ∩ lift(x)) ∈ Ux
iff P ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux or Q ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux
iff x ∈ h(P) or x ∈ h(Q)
iff x ∈ h(P) ∪ h(Q),

so h(P ∪ Q) = h(P) ∪ h(Q). Also, for all
P ∈ ℘(℘(D)), since P∩ lift(x) and Pc∩ lift(x)

are complements of each other in ℘(lift(x)) and
since Ux is an ultrafilter in ℘(lift(x)),

x ∈ h(Pc) iff Pc ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux
iff P ∩ lift(x) /∈ Ux
iff x /∈ h(P)
iff x ∈ h(P)c,

so h(Pc) = h(P)c.
It remains to show that h ◦ lift = ident. While

lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for every y 6= x, we have
lift(x) ∩ lift(x) = lift(x) ∈ Ux since an ul-
trafilter in ℘(lift(x)) contains the top element of
℘(lift(x)). Consequently,

h(lift(x)) = {y ∈ D | lift(x) ∩ lift(y) ∈ Uy}
= {x}
= ident(x).

Lemma 6. Let Ux be a principal ultrafilter in
℘(lift(x)). The following conditions are equiva-
lent.

(i) lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for all y 6= x.

(ii) Ux is generated by {{x}}.

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii). Assume (i). Since Ux is a
principal filter in ℘(lift(x)), there is some Q ∈
℘(lift(x)) that generates it, i.e.,

Ux = ↑Q = {P ∈ ℘(lift(x)) | Q ⊆P}.

We show that Q = {{x}}. For every y 6= x,
we have lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux, and because Ux
is an ultrafilter, this implies that its complement
lift(x) ∩ lift(y)c in ℘(lift(x)) belongs to Ux, so
Q ⊆ lift(x) ∩ lift(y)c. It follows that

Q ⊆
⋂

y 6=x
(lift(x) ∩ lift(y)c)

= lift(x) ∩
(⋂

y 6=x
lift(y)c

)

= {P ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ P}
∩
(⋂

y 6=x
{P ∈ ℘(D) | y ∈ P}c

)

= {P ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ P}
∩
(⋂

y 6=x
{P ∈ ℘(D) | y /∈ P}

)

= {P ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ P and y /∈ P for all y 6= x}
= {{x}}.

Since Ux = ↑Q is an ultrafilter, Q 6= ∅. Hence
Q = {{x}}.

4



(ii)⇒ (i). Assume Ux = ↑{{x}}, i.e.,

Ux = {P ∈ ℘(lift(x)) | {{x}} ⊆P}
= {P ∈ ℘(lift(x)) | {x} ∈P}.

Since

lift(x) ∩ lift(y)
= {P ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ P} ∩ {P ∈ ℘(D) | y ∈ P}
= {P ∈ ℘(D) | {x, y} ⊆ P},

if y 6= x, then {x} /∈ lift(x) ∩ lift(y), so lift(x) ∩
lift(y) /∈ Ux.
Lemma 7. Let D be infinite. For every x ∈
D, there exists a nonprincipal ultrafilter Ux in
℘(lift(x)) such that lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for all
y 6= x.
Proof. For x ∈ D, let Ex be the following subset
of ℘(lift(x)):

Ex = {{{x}}} ∪
{lift(x) ∩ lift(y) | y ∈ D and y 6= x}.

If F is a finite subset of Ex, then sinceD is infinite,
there is some y ∈ D such that lift(x)∩ lift(y) /∈ F,
so in particular {x, y} /∈ ⋃F and thus ⋃F can-
not equal lift(x), the top element of ℘(lift(x)).
Ex thus has the finite join property, so the ideal
Ix generated by Ex in ℘(lift(x)) is proper. By
the Boolean prime ideal theorem, Ix can be ex-
tended to a prime ideal, i.e., a maximal ideal Mx
in ℘(lift(x)).2 Let Ux be the dual ultrafilter of Mx
in ℘(lift(x)):

Ux = {Pc ∩ lift(x) |P ∈Mx}.

For all y 6= x, since lift(x) ∩ lift(y) ∈ Ex ⊆ Mx,
we have lift(x) ∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux. Since {{x}} ∈
Ex ⊆ Mx, we also have {{x}} /∈ Ux. Lemma 6
then implies that Ux is not a principal filter.

Theorem 8. IfD is infinite, there are uncountably
many homomorphisms h from ℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D)
such that h ◦ lift = ident.
Proof. Let D be infinite. By Lemma 5, a ho-
momorphism h from ℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that
h ◦ lift = ident is written

h = λP. {x ∈ D |P ∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux},
2 Thus Lemma 7 (and hence also Theorem 8) uses the

Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weaker form of the axiom of
choice.

where Ux is an ultrafilter in ℘(lift(x)) such that
lift(x)∩ lift(y) /∈ Ux for all y 6= x. By Lemmata 6
and 7, there are at least two such ultrafilters Ux for
each x ∈ D: a principal one and a nonprincipal
one. For each x, different choices for Ux clearly
give rise to different homomorphisms. It follows
that the cardinality of the set of homomorphisms
h such that h ◦ lift = ident is at least 2|D|.

Observe that since

{x} ∈P iff {{x}} ⊆P
iff {{x}} ⊆P ∩ lift(x)
iff P ∩ lift(x) ∈ ↑{{x}},

we can write

BE = λP. {x ∈ D | {x} ∈P}
= λP. {x ∈ D |P ∩ lift(x) ∈ ↑{{x}}}.

Thus, in Lemma 5’s representation of BE, each Ux
is a principal filter in ℘(lift(x)). This also explains
why BE has to be the unique homomorphism that
makes the Partee triangle commute when D is fi-
nite, because in that case, each ℘(lift(x)) is finite,
and every filter in a finite Boolean algebra is nec-
essarily principal.

Now supposeD is infinite. By Theorem 8, there
is a homomorphism h 6= BE that makes the Par-
tee triangle commute. By Theorem 4, we know
that h is not a complete homomorphism. It may
be illuminating to confirm this fact directly. The
observation in the previous paragraph implies that
in Lemma 5’s representation of h, there is some
a ∈ D such that Ua is a nonprincipal ultrafilter in
℘(lift(a)). We have {{a}}∩lift(a) = {{a}} /∈ Ua
because {{a}} ∈ Ua would imply Ua = ↑{{a}}
but Ua is nonprincipal. Also, for all x 6= a, we
have {{a}} ∩ lift(x) = ∅ /∈ Ux because an ultra-
filter does not contain the bottom element. Thus

h({{a}}) = {x ∈ D | {{a}}∩ lift(x) ∈ Ux} = ∅.
Since {{a}} is the only singleton set in lift(a), for
every P ∈ lift(a) such that P 6= {{a}}, we have
h({P}) = ∅ by Lemma 3. It follows that

⋃
P∈lift(a)

h({P}) =
⋃

P∈lift(a)
∅ = ∅.

On the other hand,

h
(⋃

P∈lift(a)
{P}

)
= h(lift(a)) = ident(a) = {a}.

Thus

h
(⋃

P∈lift(a)
{P}

)
6=
⋃

P∈lift(a)
h({P}).

So h does not generally preserve an infinite union.

3 Why do we need a complete
homomorphism?

Partee (1986) proposes that BE is a type-shifting
operator naturally employed in natural language
semantics on the grounds that it is a Boolean
homomorphism and it makes the Partee triangle
commute. As we have seen, however, when D is
infinite, there are infinitely many such homomor-
phisms. Couldn’t they then perhaps be employed
as type-shifting operators in place of BE? What
distinguishes BE from all the rest is the fact that
it is the only complete one. So the question boils
down to this: how should being a complete homo-
morphism matter?

To answer this question, let’s recall Partee’s
(1986) discussion of the functions THE and A
from D〈e,t〉 into D〈〈e,t〉,t〉, which in set talk can
be rendered as the following functions from ℘(D)
into ℘(℘(D)).

THE = λP. {Q ∈ ℘(D) | |P | = 1 and P ⊆ Q},
A = λP. {Q ∈ ℘(D) | P ∩Q 6= ∅}.

Partee argues that THE and A are “natural” since
they are inverses of BE in the sense that for all
P ∈ ℘(D),

BE(THE(P )) =

{
P if P is a singleton,
∅ otherwise,

BE(A(P )) = P.

One should then wonder whether analogous equal-
ities hold with other homomorphisms that make
the Partee triangle commute.

It is immediate that an analogous equality holds
with THE.

Theorem 9. Let h be a homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that h ◦ lift = ident. For
all P ∈ ℘(D),

h(THE(P )) =

{
P if P is a singleton,
∅ otherwise.

Proof. For any x ∈ D, THE({x}) = lift(x), so
h(THE({x})) = h(lift(x)) = ident(x) = {x}. If
P ∈ ℘(D) is not a singleton, then THE(P ) = ∅,
so h(THE(P )) = h(∅) = ∅.

With A, by contrast, an analogous equal-
ity does not generally hold, and this is where
(in)completeness becomes crucial.

Theorem 10. Let h be a homomorphism from
℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that h ◦ lift = ident. For
all P ∈ ℘(D),

h(A(P )) ⊇ P.

In particular, if P is finite,

h(A(P )) = P.

Proof. Let P ∈ ℘(D). We have

A(P ) = {Q ∈ ℘(D) | P ∩Q 6= ∅}
=
⋃

x∈P
{Q ∈ ℘(D) | x ∈ Q}

=
⋃

x∈P
lift(x).

Thus, for every x ∈ P , lift(x) ⊆ A(P ) and hence
{x} = ident(x) = h(lift(x)) ⊆ h(A(P )). Thus

P =
⋃

x∈P
{x} ⊆ h(A(P )).

If P is finite, then the homomorphism properties
of h ensure that

h(A(P )) = h
(⋃

x∈P
lift(x)

)

=
⋃

x∈P
h(lift(x))

=
⋃

x∈P
ident(x)

=
⋃

x∈P
{x}

= P.

Theorem 10 suggests that homomorphisms
other than BE are undesirable as a type-shifting
operator to replace BE, even if they make the Par-
tee triangle commute. To see this point, imagine
that some such homomorphism h 6= BE were ac-
tually employed as a type-shifter.

First, consider the following example.

(2) André is a girl.

Following Partee (1986), let’s assume that the verb
be is semantically vacuous and a type-shifter is in-
serted to convert a quantifier into a predicate. (2)
would then be analyzed as

(3) André ∈ h(Ja girlK) = h(A(JgirlK)).

Now suppose JgirlK is finite, as would be the case,
say JgirlK = {Mari,Meiko,Hana}. Then by The-
orem 10,

h(A(JgirlK)) = JgirlK = {Mari,Meiko,Hana},
so (3) is equivalent to

6



(4) André ∈ {Mari,Meiko,Hana},

or what amounts to the same thing,

(5) André = Mari or
André = Meiko or
André = Hana.

These are indeed the desired truth conditions for
(2), so no problem arises in this case.

Now consider the examples in (6).

(6) a. π is a natural number.
b. This is some water.

These would be analyzed as in (7), assuming that
this denotes an entity and that JsomeK = JaK = A.

(7) a. π ∈ h(A(Jnatural numberK))
b. JthisK ∈ h(A(JwaterK)).

In contrast to the previous case, Jnatural numberK
and JwaterK ought to be infinite sets. According to
Theorem 10, what we can know is then only that

h(A(Jnatural numberK)) ⊇ Jnatural numberK ,
h(A(JwaterK)) ⊇ JwaterK .

What these inequalities imply is that even though
π /∈ Jnatural numberK, (7-a) might hold and hence
(6-a) come out true, and similarly, even if JthisK /∈
JwaterK, (7-b) might hold and so (6-b) come out
true. Such states of affairs would be clearly unde-
sirable. This suggests that h should not be used as
a type-shifter in natural language semantics.

The above argument does not show, however,
that undesirable states of affairs necessarily ensue,
as the inequality h(A(P )) ⊇ P in Theorem 10 is
not necessarily a proper inclusion. Then, even in a
case where D is infinite, might there perhaps be a
homomorphism h 6= BE such that h(A(P )) = P
for all P ∈ ℘(D)? The following theorem tells
us that this possibility never obtains. Note that it
also characterizes BE without directly mentioning
completeness or the property of making the Partee
triangle commute.

Theorem 11. BE is the unique homomorphism h
from ℘(℘(D)) to ℘(D) such that h◦A is the iden-
tity map on ℘(D).

Proof. Since BE is a complete homomorphism,
by substituting BE for h in the last set of equal-
ities in the proof of Theorem 10, we can see that
BE(A(P )) = P for all P ∈ ℘(D).

To show the uniqueness, assume to the contrary
that there is a homomorphism h 6= BE such that
h ◦ A is the identity map. By Lemma 2, for some
a ∈ D and some P ∈ ℘(℘(D)), we have a ∈
h(P) and {a} /∈P . Since
A(D\{a}) = {Q ∈ ℘(D) | (D\{a}) ∩Q 6= ∅}

= {Q ∈ ℘(D) | Q\{a} 6= ∅}
= {Q ∈ ℘(D) | Q 6= {a},∅}
= ℘(D)\{{a},∅}

and since {a} /∈P , we have
P ⊆ ℘(D)\{{a}} = A(D\{a}) ∪ {∅}.

Since h ◦ A is the identity map, it follows that
h(P) ⊆ h(A(D\{a}) ∪ {∅})

= h(A(D\{a})) ∪ h({∅})
= (D\{a}) ∪ h({∅})
= (D\{a}) ∪∅ (by Lemma 3)
= D\{a}.

This contradicts a ∈ h(P).
It follows from Theorems 10 and 11 that if

h 6= BE is a homomorphism from ℘(℘(D)) to
℘(D) and h ◦ lift = ident, then there exists some
infinite set P ∈ ℘(D) such that h(A(P )) ) P .
Indeed, we can find a concrete example. Since
h 6= BE, in Lemma 5’s representation, there is
some a ∈ D such that Ua is a nonprincipal ultra-
filter in ℘(lift(a)). We have {{a}} /∈ Ua since Ua
is nonprincipal. Since

A(D\{a}) ∩ lift(a) = (℘(D)\{{a},∅}) ∩ lift(a)
= {{a}}c ∩ lift(a)

is the complement of {{a}} in ℘(lift(a)) and since
Ua is an ultrafilter in ℘(lift(a)), we have

A(D\{a}) ∩ lift(a) ∈ Ua.
According to Lemma 5, this implies that

a ∈ h(A(D\{a})).
Combining with Theorem 10, we conclude that

h(A(D\{a})) = D ) D\{a}.
The discussion in this section is just another ex-

ample demonstrating the significance of the no-
tion of completeness of the Boolean structures and
homomorphisms between them that are employed
in natural language semantics, which was exten-
sively argued for by Keenan and Faltz (1985).

4 Inverses of BE

Having discussed the naturalness of BE, Partee
(1986) asks what possible determiners δ are in-
verses of BE, i.e., BE(δ(P )) = P for all P ∈
℘(D). It is immediate that a necessary and suffi-
cient condition for δ to be an inverse of BE is that

(8) for all P ∈ ℘(D),
{x ∈ D | {x} ∈ δ(P )} = P ,

so there exist many inverses of BE. A is one but
so is Jexactly oneK. Partee suggests that “nice”
formal properties such as being increasing (in
both arguments) and being symmetric might dis-
tinguish A from the others. Contrary to her claim,
though, symmetry fails to distinguish A from
Jexactly oneK, as both of these are symmetric. On
the other hand, the property of being increasing
certainly distinguishes A from Jexactly oneK since
A is increasing and Jexactly oneK is not. Still,
there are many inverses of BE other than A that are
increasing, as the reader can easily check. Then,
how might formal properties single A out?

At this point, we shall recall Keenan and Stavi’s
(1986) view that all possible determiners are ex-
pressible as Boolean combinations of “basic” de-
terminers, which are all increasing and weakly
conservative.3 These two properties are defined
as follows, where δ is an arbitrary function from
℘(D) into ℘(℘(D)).

(9) δ is increasing
⇔ for all P,Q1, Q2 ∈ ℘(D), ifQ1 ∈ δ(P )
and Q1 ⊆ Q2, then Q2 ∈ δ(P ).

(10) δ is weakly conservative
⇔ for all P,Q ∈ ℘(D), ifQ ∈ δ(P ) then
P ∩Q ∈ δ(P ).

Keenan and Stavi (1986) proved that the functions
obtained as Boolean combinations of basic deter-
miners are exactly those functions from ℘(D) into
℘(℘(D)) that are conservative:

(11) δ is conservative
⇔ for all P,Q ∈ ℘(D), Q ∈ δ(P ) iff
P ∩Q ∈ δ(P ).

Keenan and Stavi proposed that this accounts for
3 In Keenan and Stavi’s (1986) theory, the determiner no,

which is not increasing, is not a basic determiner. Keenan and
Stavi suggest that increasingness may be a universal prop-
erty of monomorphemic determiners, if negative determiners
like no are analyzed as bimorphemic, consisting of a negative
morpheme N- and a stem.

the apparent fact that all determiners are conserva-
tive.4 Now, if we restrict our attention to inverses
of BE that are increasing and weakly conservative,
it turns out that there remain only two.

Lemma 12. Let δ be an increasing, weakly con-
servative function from ℘(D) into ℘(℘(D)) such
that BE ◦ δ is the identity map on ℘(D). Then
either

(i) δ = A or

(ii) δ(P ) =

{
A(P ) if P 6= D,
℘(D) if P = D.

Proof. Let P ∈ ℘(D) and x ∈ P . By (8), {x} ∈
δ(P ). Since δ is increasing, for every Q ∈ ℘(D)
such that {x} ⊆ Q, we have Q ∈ δ(P ), so
lift(x) ⊆ δ(P ). Hence

(12) A(P ) =
⋃

x∈P
lift(x) ⊆ δ(P ).

We now show that δ(P ) = A(P ) if P 6= D.
Suppose δ(P ) 6= A(P ). (12) implies δ(P ) 6⊆
A(P ), so there exists some Q ∈ δ(P ) such that
Q /∈ A(P ), which means P ∩ Q = ∅ by the def-
inition of A. Since δ is weakly conservative and
Q ∈ δ(P ), we have ∅ = P ∩ Q ∈ δ(P ). Be-
cause δ is increasing, for every x ∈ D, we have
{x} ∈ δ(P ) since ∅ ∈ δ(P ) and ∅ ⊆ {x}. (8)
then implies P = D.

Finally, observe that by (12),

δ(D) ⊇ A(D)
= {Q ∈ ℘(D) | D ∩Q 6= ∅}
= {Q ∈ ℘(D) | Q 6= ∅}
= ℘(D)/{∅},

so either δ(D) = A(D) = ℘(D)/{∅} or δ(D) =
℘(D). It follows that either (i) or (ii) holds.

How can we distinguish A from the other in-
creasing, weakly conservative inverse of BE de-
scribed in Case (ii) of the above lemma? One pos-
sibility might be to note that while A(D) is a sieve,
δ(D) in Case (ii) is not a sieve, in the sense of Bar-
wise and Cooper (1981):

(13) P ∈ ℘(℘(D)) is a sieve
⇔P 6= ℘(D) and P 6= ∅.

4 Conservativity coincides with Barwise and Cooper’s
(1981) ‘lives-on-its-argument’ property, which Barwise and
Cooper propose to be a universal property of determiners.

A non-sieve is either true of every predicate or
false of every predicate, and therefore would be
pointless to use in normal conversation. Van Ben-
them (1986) suggests that a determiner δ is gener-
ally expected to be such that δ(P ) is a sieve for all
P 6= ∅ (Variety, p. 9).

Another, presumably more appealing way is to
invoke the notion of logicality, for which I refer to
Westerståhl (1985). So far, we have fixed a model,
whose domain of entities is D, and have not
strictly distinguished linguistic expressions and
their model-theoretic interpretations. We should
now get rigorous about this distinction because
logicality is a property of an object language sym-
bol, and not of its interpretation in a particular
model. Henceforth, let’s take BE and A to be ob-
ject language symbols such that for every model
M = 〈D, J KM〉,

JBEKM = λP. {x ∈ D | {x} ∈P},
JAKM = λP. {Q ∈ ℘(D) | P ∩Q 6= ∅}.

Now according to Westerståhl (1985), an object
language symbol is logical if and only if it has
the two properties called constancy and topic-
neutrality.5 It turns out that constancy alone is suf-
ficient to single A out. Here is the relevant defini-
tion (Westerståhl, 1985, p. 393, with slight adap-
tation).

(14) A determiner δ is constant
⇔ for all models M1 = 〈D1, J KM1〉
and M2 = 〈D2, J KM2〉, if D1 ⊆ D2,
then for all P,Q ⊆ D1, we have
Q ∈ JδKM1 (P ) iff Q ∈ JδKM2 (P ).

A can now be characterized as in the theorem be-
low. So long as we assume all determiners to be
conservative, this theorem tells us that A is the
only increasing, logical determiner that is an in-
verse of BE.

Theorem 13. A is the unique increasing, weakly
conservative, constant inverse of BE.6

Proof. What this theorem asserts precisely is that

5 Constancy corresponds to (invariance for) Extension (of
the context) in van Benthem’s (1986) terminology. Topic-
neutrality is a generalized notion of permutation invariance
(cf. Keenan and Stavi, 1986; van Benthem, 1986).

6 Being both conservative and constant is equivalent to
being conservative* in Westerståhl’s (1985) terminology. So
we could alternatively say that A is the unique increasing and
conservative* inverse of BE.

(i) A is constant and for every model M =
〈D, J KM〉, JAKM is increasing and weakly
conservative and JBEKM ◦ JAKM is the iden-
tity map on ℘(D),

and that

(ii) if δ is constant and for every model M =
〈D, J KM〉, JδKM is increasing and weakly
conservative and JBEKM ◦ JδKM is the iden-
tity map on ℘(D), then for every modelM,
JδKM = JAKM.

Showing (i) is straightforward. Here, let’s
just verify the constancy of A. Let M1 =
〈D1, J KM1〉 and M2 = 〈D2, J KM2〉 be models
such that D1 ⊆ D2. For all P,Q ⊆ D1,

Q ∈ JAKM1 (P )
iff Q ∈ {R ∈ ℘(D1) | P ∩R 6= ∅}
iff Q ∈ {R ∈ ℘(D2) | P ∩R 6= ∅}
iff Q ∈ JAKM2 (P ).

Thus A is constant.
To show (ii), assume for a contradiction that δ

has the described properties but there exists some
model M1 = 〈D1, J KM1〉 such that JδKM1 6=
JAKM1 . By Lemma 12, JδKM1 (D1) = ℘(D1), so
in particular,

∅ ∈ JδKM1 (D1).

Now let M2 = 〈D2, J KM2〉 be a model with
D2 ) D1. By Lemma 12, JδKM2 (D1) =
JAKM2 (D1) = {Q ∈ ℘(D2) | D1 ∩ Q 6= ∅},
so

∅ /∈ JδKM2 (D1).
This contradicts the constancy of δ.

5 Conclusion

Given that the domain of entities of a model for
natural language semantics should generally be in-
finite, BE is characterized not as the unique homo-
morphism that makes the Partee triangle commute
(Theorem 8), but as the unique complete homo-
morphism that makes it commute (Theorem 4). In
light of Keenan and Faltz (1985), who have shown
the importance of considering complete (rather
than plain) homomorphisms in natural language
semantics, this is a welcome result. BE can al-
ternatively be characterized as the unique homo-
morphism that is an inverse of A (Theorem 11),

while A can be characterized as the unique in-
creasing, (weakly) conservative, constant/logical
inverse of BE (Theorem 13). From this viewpoint,
the naturalness of BE and that of A complement
each other. On the other hand, despite Partee’s
(1986) conjecture that A and THE are the most
“natural” determiners, it is not clear whether THE
may be mathematically viewed as equally natu-
ral as A is. I hope that this paper has elucidated
some finer mathematical points of the Partee trian-
gle that have gone unnoticed and will help rid the
linguistic community of any misunderstandings or
confusion regarding Partee’s (1986) Fact 2. Par-
tee’s statement in Fact 2 was not precise, but after
all, the results of this paper reinforce her intuition
that BE is nice and natural.
