Abstract

The aim of the demo is threefold. First, it introduces the current version of the annotation tool
for discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0. Second, it presents the dis-
course relations in the treebank themselves, including new additions in comparison with the
previous release. And third, it shows how to search in the treebank, with focus on the discourse
relations. 

1 Introduction
The Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 (Bejček et al., 2013) is the newest version of the Prague Depen-
dency Treebank series, succeeding versions 1.0 (PDT 1.0; Hajič et al., 2001), 2.0 (PDT 2.0; Hajič et
al., 2006), 2.5 (PDT 2.5; Bejček et al., 2012) and Prague Discourse Treebank 1.0 (PDiT 1.0; Poláková
et al., 2012, 2013). It is a corpus of Czech, consisting of almost 50 thousand sentences annotated
mostly manually on three layers of language description: morphological, analytical (surface syntactic
structure), and tectogrammatical (deep syntactic structure). On top of the tectogrammatical layer, ex -
plicitly marked discourse relations, both inter- and intra-sentential ones, have been annotated. The dis-
course annotation first appeared in PDiT 1.0, and it was corrected and updated for the newest release
of the Prague Dependency Treebank, PDT 3.0.

In Section 2, we present the annotation tool for discourse relations in PDT 3.0. In Section 3, we
briefly introduce principles of discourse annotation in PDT 3.0. Section 4 is dedicated to searching in
PDT 3.0, focusing on searching for discourse relations.

2 The Annotation Tool
The primary format of PDT since version 2.0 is called PML (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/jazz/PML/). It is an
abstract XML based format designed for annotation of linguistic corpora, especially treebanks. Data in
the  PML format  can be  browsed and edited in  TrEd,  a  fully  customizable  tree  editor  (Pajas  and
Štěpánek, 2008). TrEd is written in Perl and can be easily customized to a desired purpose by exten -
sions that are included into the system as modules. The TrEd extension for discourse annotation in
PDT was first described in Mírovský et al. (2010). Here we summarize the main features of the tool,
including additions that have been made since the previous version. Also the data format of discourse
relations in PDT 3.0 has undergone several changes.

The data format and the tool for annotation of discourse in PDT allow for:
• Creation of a link between arguments of a relation; the link is depicted with a thick orange ar-
row between nodes representing the arguments (see Figure 2 below).
• Exact specification of the extent of the arguments of the relation; it takes advantage of the tree
structure of the tectogrammatical layer and specifies the range of an argument as a set of (sub)trees;
in unclear cases the argument can be defined as an under-specified sequence of trees starting (or
newly also ending) at a given point in the data. In rare cases, an arbitrary set of individual nodes
can be specified as an argument as well.

• Assigning a connective to the relation; the connective can be defined as a list of tectogrammati -
cal nodes and, if needed, also by nodes from the lower (analytical) layer. Newly also extended con-
nectives can be assigned to the relation, which is an addition required by the on-going annotation of
so called AltLexes (alternative lexicalizations of connectives).
• Setting additional information to the relation (a type, a source, a comment etc.); newly also a
flag for the AltLex can be indicated and also a flag for negation of a discourse type.
• Assigning other discourse related information to nodes at the tectogrammatical layer; article
headings, table or figure captions and metatext can be indicated at the root node of the respective
phrase.

3 Discourse Relations in PDT 3.0

Annotation of discourse relations in PDT 3.0 is inspired by the PDTB lexical approach of connective
identification (Prasad et al., 2008) but it also takes advantage of the Prague tradition of dependency
linguistics (see e.g. Sgall et al., 1986). While in PDTB approach, a list of possible discourse connec -
tives was created and according to it, contexts for annotators were prepared, we only defined a connec-
tive theoretically and left annotators to go through the whole text and identify all such constructions
with a connective function.  In the first  and second release of discourse annotation (PDiT 1.0 and
PDT 3.0), only discourse relations indicated by overly present (explicit) discourse connectives, i.e. ex-
pressions like but, however, as a result, even though etc. have been annotated. Every discourse connec-
tive is thought of as a discourse-level predicate that takes two discourse units as its arguments. Only
discourse relations connecting clausal arguments (with a predicate verb) have been annotated. The
Prague discourse annotation also includes marking of list structures (as a separate type of discourse
structure) and marking of smaller text phenomena like article headings, figure captions, metatext etc.

The annotation proceeded first manually for cases where the tectogrammatical layer did not allow
for identifying a discourse relation automatically. Afterwards, using the information (mostly) from the
tectogrammatical layer, we were able to identify and mark almost 10 thousand out of more than 12
thousand intra-sentential relations automatically – arguments (verbal phrases), types of relations and
the connectives were identified using tree structures of the sentences, tectogrammatical functors (types
of dependency or coordination), and morphological tags (details in Jínová et al., 2012).

The Prague discourse label set was inspired by the Penn sense tag hierarchy (Prasad et al., 2008)
and by the tectogrammatical functors (Mikulová et al., 2005). The four main semantic classes, Tempo-
ral, Contingency, Contrast (Comparison) and Expansion are identical to those in PDTB but the hierar-
chy itself is only two-level (see Poláková et al., 2013). The third level is captured by the direction of
the discourse arrow. Within the four classes, the types of relations partly differ from the Penn senses
and go closer to Prague tectogrammatical functors and/or are a matter of language-specific distinc -
tions. The annotators, unlike in the Penn approach, were not allowed to only assign the major class,
they always had to decide for a specific relation within one of the classes.

PDT 3.0 brings an update of the discourse annotation released in PDiT 1.0. It has been enriched
with several newly annotated (or not yet released) discourse-related phenomena, namely genre specifi -
cation of the corpus texts (see Poláková et al., 2014), annotation of some type of rhematizers (or fo-
culizing particles) as discourse connectives, and annotation of second relations (discourse relations
with more than one semantic type). Also a new attribute discourse_special for several special roles of
phrases has been introduced.

We newly annotated foculizing particles in structures with conjunction, to see how these particles
cooperate with other types of connectives in discourse. Second relations were annotated in the data al-
ready before the PDiT 1.0 release but only in the annotator's comment, which did not become a part of
the official release. In PDT 3.0, each second relation has been captured as an additional full-fledged
relation with its own type and connective. It means that the arguments in question are connected with
two arrows representing two discourse relations.

The newly introduced attribute  discourse_special  captures three special roles of the phrase repre-
sented by a node and its subtree; the possible values are: “heading” (article headings; replaces attribute
is_heading  from PDiT 1.0), “metatext” (text not belonging to the original newspaper text, produced
during the creation of the corpus), and “caption” (for captions of pictures, graphs etc.).1

1 Metatext and caption were also annotated already before the PDiT 1.0 release in the annotator's comment (but not published there).

4 Searching in PDT 3.0

For searching in PDT, a client-server based system called PML-TQ has been developed (PML-Tree
Query; Pajas and Štěpánek, 2009). It belongs to the most powerful systems for searching in treebanks.
The server part is implemented either as a relational database or as a system in a command-line ver -
sion of TrEd (btred). The client part uses either the tree editor TrEd along with a PML-TQ extension or
a web browser. The web browser client has however some limitations, so (in the demo) we focus on
TrEd with the PML-TQ extension.

Queries in PML-TQ can be created both in a textual form and (in the TrEd client) in a graphical en-
vironment. The query language allows to define properties of tree nodes and relations among them, in-
side or between sentences and also across the layers of annotation. Negation on the tree structure and
Boolean expressions over the relations can be used. Results of the corpus search can be viewed along
with the context or processed with output filters to produce statistical tables. A detailed documentation
can be found at  http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/doc/pmltq_doc.html, in the demo we will offer an introduc-
tion to the principal parts of the language along with a set of illustrative examples, from the basic
queries to more complex ones, respecting requests from the audience.

The following example shows how to search for a discourse relation. The query defines two tec-
togrammatical nodes (t-nodes) connected with a special “member” node that represents a discourse re-
lation between the two nodes. The required type of the discourse relation can be specified at the mem -
ber node, in this example it is set to “reason”. The query also specifies that the start and target nodes of
the relation are not from the same tree, i.e. it looks for an inter-sentential discourse relation of the se -
mantic type “reason”.

Textual form of the query:
t-node 
[ !same-tree-as $t, 
     member discourse 
     [ discourse_type = "reason", 
 target_node.rf t-node $t := [  ] ] ];

Graphical form of the query:

The following two sentences represent one of the results of the query:
Pronikání do cizích počítačových systémů je podle našich zákonů beztrestné. 
Policie tak jen bezmocně přihlíží, když v bankách řádí SLÍDILOVÉ.

[Infiltration of other computer systems is according to our laws not a criminal act.
Thus the police only helplessly watches, as SNOOPERS rage in banks.]

Figure 2 captures the tectogrammatical annotation of these two sentences, along with the discourse re-
lation represented by the thick orange arrow connecting roots of the two respective propositions.
Results of queries in PML-TQ can be further processed using output filters. Thanks to an output filter,
a result of a query does not consist of individual matching positions in the trees but of a tabular sum-
mary of all the matching positions, specified by the output filter.

If we modify the previous query by deleting the definition of the discourse type (discourse_type =
"reason"), naming the member node ($d :=) and adding an output filter (the last line with prefix >>):

t-node 
[ !same-tree-as $t, 
     member discourse $d :=
         [ target_node.rf t-node $t := [  ] ] ];
>> for $d.discourse_type give $1, count() sort by $2 desc

...the query will search for all inter-sentential discourse relations in the data and – thanks to the output
filter – produce the following distribution table of the discourse types, sorted in the descending order
by the number of occurrences (only a few selected lines are printed here to save space):

opp 1,800
conj 1,389
reason 1,031

...

grad 204
restr 172
explicat 130

...

5 Conclusion
A good annotation tool, well designed annotation guidelines, and a powerful search tool are necessary
parts of a well managed project of any linguistic annotation. In the demo, we present all these parts for
the current version of annotation of discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0.

The PML as a data format, the annotation tool TrEd and the search system PML-TQ can be and
have been extensively used for many other annotation tasks in PDT and also for many other treebanks,
see for example a project of harmonizing various treebanks in HamleDT (Zeman et al., 2012).
