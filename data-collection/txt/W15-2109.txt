Abstract

This paper investigates the relation be-
tween the number of full valency frames
(we do not distinguish between comple-
ments and optional adjuncts, both are
taken into account) of a verb and the num-
ber of its synonyms. It is shown that for
Czech verbs from the Prague Dependency
Treebank it holds “the greater the full va-
lency of a verb, the more synonyms the
verb has”.

1 Introduction

Verb valency has been studied for more than fifty
years in linguistics and the study of this phe-
nomenon has enhanced knowledge about sentence
functioning substantially. Although there still
remain some problems (even fundamental ones)
which need to be solved in this research area (see
Section 2), verb valency is considered to have a
decisive impact on the sentence structure. Con-
sequently, it has become a standard part of the
majority of grammar books, verb valency lexicons
have appeared for many languages, and plenty of
articles focused on it have been published so far.
These analyses are mostly descriptive; usually va-
lency patterns, relationship between syntax and
semantics, classification criteria etc. are inves-
tigated, see, e.g., Mukherjee (2005), Herbst and
Götz-Votteler (2007), and Faulhaber (2011). How-
ever, in linguistics there are also attempts to over-
come the descriptive character of research and to
ground the discipline on empirically testable hy-
potheses, see, e.g., Zipf (1935), Sampson (2001),
Sampson (2005), Gries (2009), and Köhler and
Altmann (2011). The goal of such a methodol-
ogy is not only to describe phenomena under study
but also to interpret them, i.e., to find their re-
lations to other language properties, and, in the
ideal case, to explain them within a theory of lan-

guage. It is to be emphasized that, within this ap-
proach, all conclusions are based on statistically
testable hypotheses, and the aim is to build a the-
ory, i.e., a system of hypotheses and scientific laws
(which are statements theoretically derived and
empirically tested), see Bunge (1967) in general
and Altmann (1993) more specifically for linguis-
tics. As for verb valency, results achieved by this
methodology were presented by Köhler (2005a),
Liu (2009), Čech and Mačutek (2010), Čech et
al. (2010), Liu (2011), Köhler (2012), Gao et al.
(2014), and Vincze (2014). The authors tested hy-
potheses on relations between the number of va-
lency frames and the frequency, length of verb and
its polysemy; further, it was shown that the distri-
bution of valency frames is a special case of a very
general distribution which is used very often as a
mathematical model in linguistics (Wimmer and
Altmann, 2005).

All these studies are somewhat connected to a
synergetic theory of language, see Köhler (1986)
and Köhler (2005b), and they represent first steps
in the endeavor to implement verb valency (or va-
lency in general) to a synergetic model of syntax
(Köhler, 2012). The paper by Gao et al. (2014) de-
serves a special mention, as it contains an explicit
synergetic scheme of interrelations. The scheme
includes the verb valency and some other verb
properties (frequency, length, polysemy, polytex-
tuality, and, in addition, two properties which
are specific for the Chinese language, namely the
number of strokes and the number of pinyin let-
ters). The present study follows the same direc-
tion. Our goal is to analyse the relationship be-
tween verb valency (to be exact, its variant which
is called full valency, see Section 2) and another
important language property – synonymy. Specif-
ically, we test a hypothesis on the relationship be-
tween the number of full valency frames of verb
and its synonymy, namely, we suppose that it
holds “the more full valency frames of a verb, the

68



more synonyms the verb has”. The validity of this
statement will be tested on data from the Czech
language.

2 Full valency

The concept of full valency was introduced by
Čech et al. (2010). It can be viewed as a reac-
tion to the absence of reliable criteria for distin-
guishing obligatory arguments (complements) and
non-obligatory arguments (optional adjuncts), see
Rickheit and Sichelschmidt (2007) and Faulhaber
(2011). Full valency does not distinguish between
these two types of arguments; it takes into account
all arguments of a verb which occur in the actual
language usage (i.e., all nodes in a syntactic tree
which depend directly on the verb represent its full
valency frame). Following the paper by Čech et al.
(2010), only formally unique full valency frames
are considered. This means that if the verb occurs
in two or more identical full valency frames in the
corpus, only one of them is counted.

Čech et al. (2010) assumed that the distribution
of the number of full valency frames is not chaotic
or accidental but it is governed by fundamental
principles which have an impact also on other
language characteristics (such as the distribution
of word frequencies, word lengths, morphological
categories, etc.). Further, according to the authors,
full valency of verbs should be systematically re-
lated to other language properties (e.g., to the fre-
quency of verb, to its length, etc.) as a result of
the synergetic character of language, see Köhler
(2005b) and Köhler (2012).

First results – Čech et al. (2010), Gao et al.
(2014) and Vincze (2014) – corroborated the rea-
sonability of the approach. They revealed, for in-
stance, that the distribution of full valency frames
can be modelled by the same model as the distri-
bution of valency frames based on the traditional
argument classification, see Čech and Mačutek
(2010) for Czech, Liu (2011) for English, Gao et
al. (2014) for Chinese, and Vincze (2014) for Hun-
garian. Given these results, “traditional” valency
and full valency seem to be governed by the same
mechanism, and traditional valency can be inter-
preted, tentatively at least, as a special case of full
valency.

3 Verb full valency a synonymy

Every hypothesis should be based on some the-
oretical assumption(s). Without it, one can find

even strong correlation (e.g., inductively) between
observed phenomena, however, it does not have
to mean anything. Therefore, a crucial question
is why one should expect the existence of a rela-
tionship between verb valency and synonymy. To
find an answer, let us start from a wider perspec-
tive. At least since Zipf (1935), it is known that
semantic properties of language are systematically
related to other language characteristics (e.g., rela-
tive frequency, degree of intensity of accent, etc.).
These systematic relationships can be interpreted
as a consequence of the dynamic evolution of lan-
guage caused by language usage (Bybee and Hop-
per, 2001). For an illustration, assume a develop-
ment of usage of any word. Initially, it was used
in a unique sense and in a specific context. Next
usages of the word led both to a strengthening of
the sense and to an increase of the number of con-
texts in which the word occurs. More generally,
the word properties were formed by two opposite
forces: a unification and a diversification (Zipf,
1935). As a result, fundamental characteristics of
the word were established (for instance, the length
of the word is a consequence of its frequency as
well as the number of its derivatives, compounds
in which it occurs etc.). As for the meaning of
the word, a high frequency of its usage increases
a chance that the word is used in different con-
texts. Different contexts usually modify slightly
the word meaning, which leads (sometimes) to
a “codification” of a new meaning of the word.
Therefore, a relationship between frequency and
polysemy emerges. Further, the more meanings
the word has, the more semantic domains exist
in which the word can occur. Obviously, differ-
ent semantic domains are represented by different
sets of words. Consequently, a word which occurs
in more semantic domains increases its chance of
having more synonyms.

As for verb valency, there is, as can be seen
from any valency dictionary, a clear relationship
between polysemy of the verb and its valency.
Specifically, different meanings of the verb are of-
ten represented by different valency frames, see
Liu (2011) for an analysis of the relation between
the two properties. Consequently, it seems reason-
able to hypothesize the relationship between verb
valency and synonymy; to be precise, we expect
that the number of synonyms of a verb tends to
increase with the increasing number of its full va-
lency frames. We thus have a deductive hypothe-

69



sis which will be tested empirically in Section 5.
A quantification (which necessarily precedes tests)
not only enables the application of statistical meth-
ods, it also opens a way towards a mathematical
model (which, in turn, makes possible more objec-
tive comparisons of different languages, language
typology based on values of its parameters, etc.).

4 Language material

For the counting of full valency verb frames, the
Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 was used (Hajič
et al., 2006); specifically, the data annotated on
an analytical layer, which consists of 4264 docu-
ments, 68,495 sentences and 1.2 million tokens.
For the determination of synonyms of a verb, we
use the Czech WordNet from the EuroWordNet
project (Vossen, 1997); it contains 32,116 words
and collocations, 28,448 synsets, 43,958 literals,
see Horák and Smrž (2004) and Hlaváčková et al.
(2006).

The term “full valency” means that all verb
directly dependent words (arguments) which oc-
cur in the sentence are taken into account. To
determine a full valency frame of a verb, we
use argument characteristics as follows: analyt-
ical functions (e.g., subject, object), morpholog-
ical cases (e.g., nominative, genitive), and lem-
mas (only in the case of prepositions). Particular
characteristics are assigned to arguments in accor-
dance with the PDT 2.0 annotation. Specifically,
from the sentence John gave four books to Mary
yesterday, we obtain the following full valency
frame of the verb give: GIVE [subject/nominative;
object/accusative; AuxP/dative/lemma TO; Adv],
see Figure 1.

This procedure is used for all predicate verbs in
the corpus and, finally, we get list of verbs (lem-
mas) with assigned full valency frames.

The number of synonyms of a verb is deter-
mined from the database CzechWordNet which
is organized as a network of basic entities called
synsets, i.e., synonym sets. Each synset corre-
sponds to one meaning of a word or a collocation.
In this paper, synonymy of each verb is defined as
the number of lemmas which appear with the verb
in particular synsets. For instance, the verb intend
has four synsets in English Wordnet:

1. intend: 1, mean: 4, think: 7;

2. intend: 2, destine:2 , designate: 4, specify: 6;

3. mean: 1, intend: 3;

4. mean: 3, intend: 4, signify: 1, stand for: 2;

in which nine different lemmas appear (in order
to avoid confusion, it should be emphasized that,
e.g., “mean: 1” and “mean: 4” express two differ-
ent meanings, and hence they also represent two
different lemmas) – i.e., the verb intend has nine
synonyms. Hereby we do not claim that other pos-
sibilities of determining the number of synonyms
(e.g., distinguishing among different senses of the
verb) are worse; quite on the contrary, using sev-
eral of them (while keeping in mind what they
have in common and in what they differ) and com-
paring results can lead to a deeper understanding
of mechanisms “behind” synonymy (and language
in general).

Altogether, we work with 2120 verbs in this
study.

5 Methodology and results

The validity of our hypothesis for Czech data was
checked in two different (albeit related) ways.

First, one can compute the correlation coeffi-
cient between full verb valency and synonymy.
There is no a priori reason to suppose the linearity
of the relation; therefore, the Kendall correlation
coefficient – see, e.g., Hollander and Wolfe (1999)
– was used (similarly as the well-known Pearson
correlation coefficient, it takes values from the in-
terval [-1,1]; value 1 means that the relation “the
greater one variable, the greater the other” is valid
for all data without an exception). It is a measure
of a monotonous relation (without specifying the
type of a functional relation, like, e.g., linearity)
between two variables (full valency and synonymy
in our case). Thus it is a more general and more
robust characteristic of the relation than the Pear-
son correlation coefficient (which is a measure of
linearity of the relation).

The Kendall correlation coefficient evaluates to
0.18 for our data. It is, quite clearly, a non-zero
value (if we test the hypothesis of zero value of
the coefficient, we obtain the p-value lesser than
0.0001, hence, the hypothesis is rejected for all
reasonable significance levels). There are, how-
ever, several minor problems associated with the
test.

First, it is well-known that practically all hy-
potheses are rejected if sufficiently high amount of
data are used. This fact was discussed specifically
with respect to linguistic data by Mačutek and
Wimmer (2013). Our sample size (2120 verbs)

is not too high yet, but studies using higher vol-
umes of language material can appear in future
(see also comments in Section 6), for which (al-
most) any hypothesis would be rejected in terms
of the p-value. Thus, a need of a unified approach
to checking the validity of the hypothesis arises.

Anyway, the p-value should be read cautiously.
It can serve as a decision rule whether to reject a
hypothesis or not, but p-values resulting from dif-
ferent tests are not directly comparable (Grendár,
2012). Applied to our problem, based on the p-
value we reject the hypothesis that full valency and
synonymy are (monotonously) independent, how-
ever, from the p-value we cannot deduce a strength
(or a type) of their relationship.

Next, the test for the Kendall correlation coef-
ficient supposes no ties in the data, but there are
many verbs with the same full valency (especially
the low values of full valency frames occur very
often – which is true also for the “traditional” va-
lency.

Finally, if an “optical criterion” is taken into ac-
count, the data fluctuate quite strongly, as can be
seen in Figure 2, and the increasing trend indicated
by the positive value of the Kendall correlation co-
efficient is not too obvious.

Therefore, in order to be able to see a clearer
picture and to provide a tool applicable also to
higher sample sizes, we performed also the anal-
ysis of pooled data. Groups of at least 20 verbs
were created as follows. Starting from the verbs
with the highest number of full valency frames,
a group of the first 20 verbs was taken. Then, it

was checked whether the last verb in this groups
has more full valency frames than the first verb
in the next group – if the respective numbers of
full valency frames were equal, the group was en-
larged so that all verbs with the same full valency
belonged to the same group. This approach was
repeteadly applied, until all verbs were divided
into groups. Resulting groups do not contain the
same numbers of verbs, however, we prefer to
keep verbs with the same number of full valency
frames in one group, as there is no reasonable or-
dering of verbs (ones with the same full valency
are either ordered alphabetically, or they appear in
the chronological order as they were entered into
treebanks, etc.). Then, the mean number of full

valency frames and the mean number of synonyms
per verb were calculated in each group. The pool-
ing process results in much smoother data, see Fig-
ure 3. Obviously, the mean number of synonyms
per group tends to increase with the increasing
mean full valency.

Admittedly, the minimal size of the group used
(i.e., 20 in our case) is purely heuristic; however,
other choices lead to very similar pooled data be-
haviour (an increasing, seemingly even a linear
trend is observed). As we consider this paper to
be a kind of a pilot study, we postpone a deeper
analysis of the full valency – synonymy relation (is
there really a linear dependence, or, what we see
in Figure 3 is a part of a flat power law curve? are
parameters of the line/curve language specific? if
yes, do they correspond to an established syntax-
based language typology? etc.) until results for
more languages are available.

6 Conclusion

The results presented in this study can be seen as
the first step in the empirical research of the re-
lation between the number of full valency frames
of verbs and the number of synonyms. It goes
without saying that an analysis based on a sin-
gle language cannot be interpreted as an “honest”,
general enough corroboration of the respective hy-
pothesis. However, tentatively the results allow to
expect that synonymy can be related to verb (full)
valency, i.e., to one of fundamental syntax proper-
ties.

This paper, we hope, will serve also as an impe-
tus for future research in this field. Some questions
were already asked at the end of Section 5; in addi-
tion, our results call for substantial generalizations
in (at least) two directions. First, the same phe-
nomenon (the relation between verb valency and
synonymy) should be investigated in several typo-
logically different languages. Second, we suppose
that valency of other parts of speech, see, e.g., Spe-
vak (2014), is also related to synonymy; this topic
waits for empirical approaches as well. Given the
lack of a clear distinction between obligatory and
non-obligatory arguments, full valency (of other
parts of speech) can again be of help.

Finally, if the hypothesis on a systematic rela-
tion between (full) valency and synonymy is more
generally corroborated, it should be integrated into
the network of (inter)relations among linguistic
units and their properties, see Köhler (2005b) and
Gao et al. (2014).
