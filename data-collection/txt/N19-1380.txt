Abstract

One of the first steps in the utterance interpre-
tation pipeline of many task-oriented conver-
sational AI systems is to identify user intents
and the corresponding slots. Since data col-
lection for machine learning models for this
task is time-consuming, it is desirable to make
use of existing data in a high-resource lan-
guage to train models in low-resource lan-
guages. However, development of such mod-
els has largely been hindered by the lack of
multilingual training data. In this paper, we
present a new data set of 57k annotated ut-
terances in English (43k), Spanish (8.6k) and
Thai (5k) across the domains weather, alarm,
and reminder. We use this data set to evalu-
ate three different cross-lingual transfer meth-
ods: (1) translating the training data, (2) us-
ing cross-lingual pre-trained embeddings, and
(3) a novel method of using a multilingual ma-
chine translation encoder as contextual word
representations. We find that given several
hundred training examples in the the target
language, the latter two methods outperform
translating the training data. Further, in very
low-resource settings, multilingual contextual
word representations give better results than
using cross-lingual static embeddings. We
also compare the cross-lingual methods to us-
ing monolingual resources in the form of con-
textual ELMo representations and find that
given just small amounts of target language
data, this method outperforms all cross-lingual
methods, which highlights the need for more
sophisticated cross-lingual methods.

1 Introduction

One of the first steps in many conversational AI
systems that are used to parse utterances in per-
sonal assistants is the identification of what the
user intends to do (the intent) as well as the argu-
ments of the intent (the slots) (Mesnil et al., 2013;

∗ Work carried out during an internship at Facebook.

Liu and Lane, 2016). For example, for a request
such as Set an alarm for tomorrow at 7am, a first
step in fulfilling such a request is to identify that
the user’s intent is to set an alarm and that the re-
quired time argument of the request is expressed
by the phrase tomorrow at 7am.

Given these properties of the task, the problem
can be stated as a joint sentence classification (for
intent classification) and sequence labeling (for
slot detection) task and therefore naturally lends
itself to using a biLSTM-CRF sequence labeling
model (Lample et al., 2016; Vu, 2016) where the
biLSTM layer is also used as the input for a pro-
jection layer for intent detection.

These models are very powerful and given
enough training data, they achieve very high ac-
curacy on the intent classification as well as the
slot detection task. However, given the require-
ment of large amounts of labeled training data, de-
veloping a conversational AI system for many new
languages is a very resource-intensive task and
clearly not feasible to be done for the more than
6,500 languages that are currently spoken around
the world.

For this reason, one would like to make use of
methods that enable transfer learning from a high-
resource language to a low-resource language.
However, the development of sophisticated cross-
lingual transfer methods for intent detection and
slot filling has so far been hindered by the lack
of multilingual data sets that have been annotated
according to the same guidelines.1 In this work,
we therefore present a novel data set containing
a large number of English utterances (the high-
resource data) as well as a smaller set of utterances
in Spanish and in Thai (the low-resource data),
which were annotated according to the same anno-
tation scheme. This data allows the systematic in-

1Upadhyay et al. (2018) collected such a dataset but to the
best of our knowledge, their data is not publicly available.

vestigation of cross-lingual transfer learning meth-
ods from high-resource languages to low-resource
languages.

We use this data set to explore different strate-
gies to make use of training data from a high-
resource language to improve intent and slot de-
tection models for other languages. We investi-
gate two previously proposed strategies for cross-
lingual transfer, namely using cross-lingual pre-
trained embeddings (XLU embeddings; see Ruder
et al., 2017 for a review) as well as automatically
translating the English training data to the target
language. Further, we present a novel technique
that uses a bidirectional neural machine transla-
tion encoder as cross-lingual contextual word rep-
resentations. We compare the cross-lingual trans-
fer methods to models that are only trained on the
target language data.

Across the two languages and the various trans-
fer methods, we find that joint training on the high-
resource and the low-resource target language im-
proves results on the target language. We further
find that the optimal choice of transfer method de-
pends on the size of the available training data in
the target language: In the zero-shot case where
no target language data is available, translating the
training data gives the best results. However, if a
small amount of training data is available, we find
that jointly training on the high-resource and low-
resource data works better than training on trans-
lated data.

We release the data at https://fb.me/
multilingual_task_oriented_data.

2 Data

We originally collected a data set of around 43,000
English utterances across the domains ALARM,
REMINDER, and WEATHER. Data collection pro-
ceeded in three steps. First, native English speak-
ers were asked to produce utterances for each in-
tent, e.g., provide examples of how they would ask

for the weather. In a second step, two annotators
would label the intent and the spans correspond-
ing to slots for each utterance. As a third step, if
annotators disagreed on the annotation of an utter-
ance, a third annotator who corresponded with the
authors of the guidelines adjudicated between the
two annotations.

For the Spanish and Thai data, native speak-
ers of the target language translated a sample of
the English utterances. These translated utterances
were then also annotated by two annotators. For
Spanish, if annotators disagreed, a third annota-
tor who was bilingual in Spanish and English ad-
judicated these disagreements in communication
with the guideline authors. Unfortunately, for
Thai, we did not have a bilingual speaker available
and hence we decided to discard all utterances for
which the annotators disagreed. We hope to rec-
tify this for future data collection efforts.

We believe this data presents a great opportu-
nity to investigate cross-lingual semantic models
and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
parallel data set for a word tagging task that has
been annotated according to the same guidelines
across multiple languages.

Table 1 contains several summary statistics of
the data set. Note that the percentage of training
examples as compared to development and test ex-
amples is much higher for the English data than for
the Thai and Spanish data. We decided for a more
even split for the latter two languages so that we
had a sufficiently large data set for model selec-
tion and evaluation.

3 NLU models

The intent detection and slot-filling model consists
of two parts: It first uses a sentence classification
model to identify the domain of the user utterance
(in our case, ALARM, REMINDER, or WEATHER),
and then uses a domain-specific model to jointly
predict the intent and slots. Figure 1 shows the ba-

sic architecture of the joint intent-slot prediction
model. It first embeds the utterance using an em-
bedding matrix and then passes the word vectors
to a biLSTM layer. For intent classification, we
use a self-attention layer (Lin et al., 2017) over the
hidden states of the biLSTM as input to a softmax
projection layer; for slot detection, we pass for
each word the concatenation of the forward and
backward hidden states through a softmax layer,
and then pass the resulting label probability vec-
tors through a CRF layer for final predictions.

In our experiments, we vary how the tokens are
embedded:

• Zero embeddings: We train the parameters
of a 0-initialized embedding matrix that con-
tains each word that appears in the training
data.

• XLU embeddings: We embed the tokens
through lookup in a pre-trained cross-lingual
embedding matrix and concatenate these em-
beddings with tuned zero embeddings. Here,
we follow Dozat et al. (2017) in having
a fixed pre-trained embedding matrix com-
bined with tuneable zero-embeddings.

• Encoder embeddings: We embed tokens by
passing the entire utterance through a pre-
trained biLSTM sentence encoder and us-
ing the hidden states of the top layer as in-
put. We keep the parameters of the pre-
trained encoder fixed and concatenate them
with tuneable zero-embeddings. (See Sec-
tion 4 for a detailed description of the differ-
ent encoders.)

4 Encoder models

As mentioned in the previous section, some of
our models use a pre-trained biLSTM encoder to
generate contextual word embeddings. In all our
experiments, we use a bidirectional LSTM en-
coder with two layers. Overall, we compare three
strategies for training these encoders. The moti-
vation for choosing these strategies is to investi-
gate whether there is a benefit of using multilin-
gual embeddings.

• CoVe: Following McCann et al. (2017),
we train a neural machine translation model
to translate from the low-resource language
(Spanish or Thai) to English.

• Multilingual CoVe: We train a neural ma-
chine translation model to translate from the
low-resource language to English and from
English to the low-resource language. We
encode the translation direction using target
language-specific start tokens in the decoder
(Yu et al., 2018a). In this model, the encoder
does not have access to the target language
and therefore we expect it to learn to encode
phrases with similar meanings into similar
vector spaces across languages.

• Multilingual CoVe w/ autoencoder: We
train a bidirectional neural machine trans-
lation model and combine it with an auto-
encoder objective. For the language pair
Spanish-English, that means given a Spanish
input sentence we train the model to gener-
ate either an English translation or to repro-
duce the Spanish sentence depending on the
start token in the decoder. Likewise, given
an English sentence, we train the model to
output either a Spanish translation or to re-
produce the English sentence depending on
the start token in the decoder. The motivation
for this approach is that using the joint trans-
lation and autoencoder objective might lead
to more general representations since the de-
coder has to be capable to output sentences
in either language independent of what the
source language was, and unlike in the pre-
vious model the source language does not de-
termine the target language. We train an anal-
ogous model for the Thai-English language
pair.

For Spanish, for which pre-trained ELMo (Pe-
ters et al., 2018) embeddings are available, we
also evaluate the use of the ELMo embeddings
by Che et al. (2018); Fares et al. (2017). Note
that the ELMo encoder and the CoVe encoder are
trained to encode only the low-resource language
and therefore neither of them are multilingual en-
coders.

Implementation details We train all models us-
ing a wrapper around the fairseq (Gehring et al.,
2016, 2017) sequence-to-sequence models. We
use 300d randomly initialized word vectors as in-
put to the first embedding layer. Each direction in
each hidden layer has 512 dimensions which re-
sults in a total encoder output dimension of 1024.
For the machine translation models, we further use
dot-product attention (Luong et al., 2015) and to
improve efficiency, we limit the output space of
the softmax to 30 translation candidates as deter-
mined by word alignments as well as the 2,000
most frequent words (L’Hostis et al., 2016).

Data For the Spanish models, we use two
copies2 of Europarl v7 (Koehn, 2005), every
eighth sentences of the Paracrawl data,3 and the
newstest2008-2011 data. For model selection, we
use the newstest2012-2013 data. For the Thai
models, we use 10 copies of the IWSTL training
data (Cettolo et al., 2012) as well as the OpenSub-
titles data (Lison et al., 2018) for training, and the
IWSTL development and test data for model se-
lection. We use the 20,000 most common words
in the training data as the vocabulary. For the mul-
tilingual models, we take the union of the vocabu-
lary from both languages. We tokenize the data us-

2We upsample the Europarl (for Spanish) and IWSLT (for
Thai) data since these data sets are presumably of higher
quality than the largerly automatically mined Paracrawl and
OpenSubtitles data.

WMT 2018 task

ing an in-house rule-based (for English and Span-
ish) and dictionary-based (for Thai) tokenizer. We
further lowercase all data and remove all dupli-
cates within a data set. We discard all sentences
whose length exceeds 100 tokens.

Training details We train the models using
stochastic gradient descent with an initial learn-
ing rate of 0.5. We decrease the learning rate by
1% after an epoch whenever perplexity on the val-
idation data is higher than for the epoch with the
lowest perplexity. We train all models for up to
100 epochs, except for the Spanish bidirectional
MT model with an autoencoder which we trained
for 300 epochs since it took considerably longer
to converge. For multilingual models, we choose
the model that has the lowest average perplexity
on both translation tasks.

Table 2 shows the perplexities for the different
models. In general, the translation perplexities are
very similar independent of whether we train a
unidirectional MT system or a bidirectional MT
system, except for the Spanish bidirectional MT
model with an autoencoder which even after 300
epochs still yields higher perplexities on the vali-
dation data than the other translation models.4

5 Cross-lingual learning

In our first set of experiments, we explore the fol-
lowing baselines and strategies for training models
in Spanish and Thai given a large amount of En-
glish training data and a small amount of Spanish
and Thai training data.

• Target only: Using only the low-resource
target language data.

4We hypothesize that the slow convergence as well as the
lower performance might be caused by the fact that the sen-
tences in the Spanish-English parallel data are much longer
than in the Thai-English data which might make it harder to
learn good universal sentence representations.

• Target only with encoder embeddings: Us-
ing only the low-resource language training
data and using pre-trained encoder embed-
dings.

• Translate train: Combining the target train-
ing data with the English data that has been
automatically translated to the target lan-
guage. The slot annotations are projected via
the attention weights (Yarowsky et al., 2001).
We translate the data using the Facebook neu-
ral machine translation system.

• Cross-lingual with XLU embeddings: Joint
training on the English and target lan-
guage data with pre-trained MUSE (Con-
neau et al., 2017) cross-lingual embeddings.
Since MUSE embeddings are not available
for Thai, we only evaluate this method for
Spanish.

• Cross-lingual with encoder embeddings:
Joint training on the English and target lan-
guage data using pre-trained encoder embed-
dings.

Implementation details We implement all clas-
sification and sequence labeling models within the
PyText framework (Aly et al., 2018). We train
models for 20 epochs and select the model that
performs best on the development set. We use the
Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a
learning rate of 0.01. We use dropout of 0.3 in the
BiLSTM and we set the size of the self-attention
layer to 128 dimensions.

Evaluation We evaluate our models according
to four metrics: Domain accuracy, which mea-
sures the accuracy of the domain classification
task; intent accuracy, which measures the accuracy
of identifying the correct intent; slot F1, which is
the geometric mean of the slot precision and slot
recall; and the exact match metric, which indicates
the number of utterances for which the domain, in-
tent, and all slots were correctly identified. Exact
match is thus the strictest metric of all. We micro-
average all metrics across domains.

sults for all evaluated models. While we get

case of the translate train models, the English data was automatically translated into the target language.

slightly different results for the two languages,
there are several consistent patterns. For Spanish,
we observe that adding contextual word represen-
tations to the target only model, consistently im-
proves results. Not surprisingly since the ELMo
embeddings were trained on a large monolingual
corpus, the model that uses these embeddings out-
performs all other target only models.

If we turn to the cross-lingual models for Span-
ish, the results indicate that the translation method
works well for domain and intent classification but
less so for slot detection, presumably due to noisy
projection of the slot annotations. For slot detec-
tion, we get the best results using the ELMo em-
beddings which outperform the XLU embeddings
as well as the bidirectional MT encoder in terms
of exact match and slot F1. Similarly as in the tar-
get only setting, the model with multilingual CoVe
embeddings combined with the autoencoder per-
forms worse than the other CoVe encoders. Over-
all, however, the choice of embeddings seems to
have only a relatively small impact on the perfor-
mance of the cross-lingual models. Importantly,
however, we see improvements across all metrics
as compared to training only on the target lan-
guage data.

We observe similar results for Thai. The trans-
lation approach again yields the worst results for
slot detection and we again see a consistent im-
provement from cross-lingual training as com-
pared to training only on Thai data. And we again
only observe small differences depending on the
type of embeddings in the cross-lingual training
scenario, but in this case, the models with the

multilingual CoVe encoders outperform the model
with the monolingual encoder.

Table 3 also shows the results for English. Not
surprisingly, since we have an order of magnitude
more data for English, the model trained and tested
on English data still performs better than any of
the evaluated methods for the other two languages.
However, the gap between the numbers for En-
glish and the numbers for the other two languages
does get considerably smaller for the cross-lingual
models. Prima facie, the results also indicate that
the models perform better for Thai than for Span-
ish. However, this is potentially an artifact of the
data. As we mentioned above, we had to discard
some of the Thai utterances for which the annota-
tions disagreed with the annotations of their En-
glish translations and it is possible that we dis-
carded a disproportionate number of more com-
plex utterances which in return made parsing the
Thai utterances easier.

In summary, the results from both languages
suggest that pre-trained word representations as
well as cross-lingual training improve results over
training only on target language data without any
pre-trained embeddings. The choice of embed-
dings, however, seems to matter less, and the over-
all performance seems to depend only very little
on whether we use dynamic or static word repre-
sentations or whether we use monolingual or bilin-
gual word representations.

However, interestingly, for Spanish for which
we compared more types of word representations
than for Thai, the cross-lingual model with mono-
lingual ELMo embeddings provided the best re-



3801

sults. This potentially indicates that the benefit
of cross-lingual training comes from sharing the
biLSTM layer or the CRF layer and that embed-
ding the tokens of the high-resource and the low-
resource language in a similar space is not as im-
portant. At the same time, considering that we are
getting relatively good results for both languages
if we only train on the target language data, the po-
tential of cross-lingual training might be limited
in this case. To investigate whether the embed-
ding type matters in more extreme low-resource
scenarios, we also performed a series of zero-shot
and low-resource experiments, which we describe
in the next section.

6 Zero-shot learning and learning curves

As mentioned in the previous section, from the re-
sults on the full data, it is not entirely clear whether
there is an advantage of using cross-lingual em-
beddings. We therefore conducted additional ex-
periments with even smaller training sets in the
target language: the case where we no annotated
data in the target language exists (zero-shot) and
the case where a very limited amount of training
data in the target language exists. If there is no
advantage of using cross-lingual embeddings over
using monolingual embeddings, we expect to see
similar results for all models independent of the
training data size. On the other hand, if the mul-
tilingual CoVe encoder actually embeds phrases
with similar meanings in the two languages in a
similar vector space, we would expect the model
with multilingual CoVe embeddings to perform
much better in the zero-shot and very low-resource
scenarios than any of the models with monolin-
gual embeddings. Further, we can also investi-
gate whether there is an advantage of translating
the training data over other methods in extremely
low-resource scenarios.

Experiments We used the same models with the
same parameters as in the previous section. In the
zero-shot case, we only use English data for train-
ing and model selection. For the learning curve
experiments, we sample 10, 50, 100, or 200 ut-
terances from each domain for the target language
for training and model selection and upsample the
target language data so that it roughly matches
the size of the English data. For the zero-shot
results, we present the average numbers across 5
runs. For the learning curve experiments, since
we introduced another random factor by randomly

sampling the training and model selection data, we
repeat this process 10 times and report the average
as well as the minimum and maximum values of
the exact match metric for these experiments.

Results and discussion Table 4 shows the zero-
shot results. These results indicate that using
the multilingual CoVe embeddings works better
than not using any encoder embeddings or using
monolingual CoVe embeddings. This is true for
the sentence-level domain and intent classification
tasks as well as for slot detection. The Spanish
results also suggest that in the zero-shot case, the
multilingual encoder embeddings lead to better re-
sults than the XLU embeddings. However, also
the models that use cross-lingual embeddings per-
form very poorly and contrary to the case where
we have some training data in the target language,
in the zero-shot scenario, the translation method
works considerably better than any other of the
transfer methods.

The results for different training set sizes are
shown in Figure 2. These results generally confirm
the patterns that we observed in the experiments
with all available training data: cross-lingual train-
ing improves the results over training only on the
target language (to a much bigger extent when
there is much less target language training data
available) and using pre-trained word represen-
tations leads to further improvements. We fur-
ther observe that cross-lingual learning seems to
lead to much more stable training which can be
seen in the much smaller ranges of results as com-
pared to the models trained only on the target lan-
guage. Also in the extremely low-resource scenar-
ios, the choice of embeddings seems to have very
little effect. Lastly, as these plots show, the trans-
lation approach works better when there is very
little training data available but the performance
quickly plateaus and once there are are several
hundred target language training examples avail-
able, joint training on multiple languages leads to
better results.

Considering all results together, we find a con-
sistent advantage of using cross-lingual training
across all languages, training set sizes and embed-
ding types. We further observe that the choice of
embedding type has little effect as long as some
form of pre-trained embeddings is being used.
These facts together suggest that the main advan-
tage of cross-lingual training comes from shar-
ing the biLSTM and CRF layer across languages.

and lowest value of the exact match metric among the 10 runs.

This is in line with the results by de Lhoneux
et al. (2018) who found for cross-lingual train-
ing of dependency parsers, sharing the MLP layer
for parser decisions improved results for all lan-
guage pairs that they considered, whereas shar-
ing of lower-level parameters only led to improve-
ments for a limited set of language pairs.

Cross-lingual sequence labeling The task of
cross-lingual and multilingual sequence labeling
has gained a lot of attention recently. Yang
et al. (2017) used shared character embeddings
for cross-lingual transfer, and Lin et al. (2018)
used shared character and sentence embeddings
that were trained in a multitask setting for part-
of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.
Upadhyay et al. (2018) used cross-lingual embed-
dings for training multilingual slot-filling systems.
Xie et al. (2018) used a similar model for NER
but they first “translated” the high-resource train-
ing data by replacing each token with the token
in the target language that was closest in vector
space, and they further used character embeddings
and a self-attention mechanism. Yu et al. (2018b)
investigated using character-based language mod-
els for NER in several languages but did not do
any cross-lingual learning. Plank and Agić (2018)
used cross-lingual embeddings, projected annota-
tions, and dictionaries for zero-shot cross-lingual
part-of-speech tagging.

Cross-lingual sentence representations Re-
cently, there was also a lot of work of using cross-
lingual sequence encoders for sentence classifica-
tions using either multilingual MT encoders sim-
ilar to ours (e.g., Eriguchi et al., 2018; Yu et al.,
2018a; Singla et al., 2018) or training encoders
and then aligning their vector spaces after pre-
training (Conneau et al., 2018; Schuster et al.,
2019). Even more recently, Lample and Conneau
(2019) and Mulcaire et al. (2019) showed that it
is also possible to directly train contextual word
representations jointly on multiple languages.

Cross-lingual transfer for other tasks Apart
from tasks such as slot filling and NER, cross-
lingual transfer learning has also been investigated
a lot for syntactic tasks, and in particular for part-
of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. Early
work trained part-of-speech taggers for individual
languages and then trained delexicalized depen-
dency parsers (e.g., Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Mc-
Donald et al., 2011). Further, a lot of syntactic and
semantic parsing models recently successfully in-
corporated parameter sharing for training parsers
in closely related languges (Duong et al., 2015;
Ammar et al., 2016; Susanto and Lu, 2017; Smith
et al., 2018; de Lhoneux et al., 2018). In the do-
main of dialog managers, Mrkšić et al. (2017) and
Chen et al. (2018) presented methods for cross-
lingual transfer for dialog state tracking.

8 Conclusion and future work

In this paper, we presented a new multilingual in-
tent and slot filling data set for task oriented dia-
log of around 57,000 utterances and evaluated the
performance of different methods for cross-lingual
transfer learning, including a novel method us-
ing cross-lingual contextual word representations.
For both investigated languages, we consistently
found that cross-lingual learning improves results
as compared to only training on limited amounts
of target language data, and our results suggest
that the choice of multilingual or monolingual em-
beddings has only a small impact on the overall
performance.

Despite the range of models that we consid-
ered in this paper, we only scratched at the sur-
face of possible cross-lingual (embedding) mod-
els, and hence there are many future directions of
this work. First, except for the Spanish ELMo
embeddings, we did not use any character em-
beddings in any of our experiments or models.
This presumably makes sense for the English-Thai
transfer learning case since these two languages
use different writing systems but given the results
by Lin et al. (2018) and Yang et al. (2017), we
would expect additional improvements by sharing
character embeddings for languages with similar
writing systems.

Second, one could try to include a specific
learning objective to embed translations into a
similar vector space as used by Yu et al. (2018a)
and Conneau et al. (2018) for multilingual sen-
tence representations.

As yet another extension, one could combine
the approaches of multilingual CoVe embeddings
and monolingual ELMo (or BERT, Devlin et al.,
2018) embeddings and jointly train an encoder
with a language model and an MT objective,
which would potentially combine the benefit of
training a model on large monolingual corpora
while at the same time aligning the vector spaces
of the two languages. A similar approach worked
well for cross-lingual NLI inference on the XNLI
data set (Conneau et al., 2018) as well as for un-
supervised machine translation (Lample and Con-
neau, 2019).

We hope that our data set will facilitate research
in these directions and ultimately lead to improved
natural language understanding models for low-
resource languages.
