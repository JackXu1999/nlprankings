Abstract

Systems for automatic argument generation
and debate require the ability to (1) determine
the stance of any claims employed in the ar-
gument and (2) assess the specificity of each
claim relative to the argument context. Ex-
isting work on understanding claim specificity
and stance, however, has been limited to the
study of argumentative structures that are rel-
atively shallow, most often consisting of a sin-
gle claim that directly supports or opposes the
argument thesis. In this paper, we tackle these
tasks in the context of complex arguments on a
diverse set of topics. In particular, our dataset
consists of manually curated argument trees
for 741 controversial topics covering 95,312
unique claims; lines of argument are gener-
ally of depth 2 to 6. We find that as the dis-
tance between a pair of claims increases along
the argument path, determining the relative
specificity of a pair of claims becomes easier
and determining their relative stance becomes
harder.

1 Introduction

The tasks of automatic argument generation and
debate require the ability to present a diverse and
comprehensive set of supporting and opposing ar-
guments given a controversial topic. Two criti-
cal components of such systems are an ability to
determine the stance and the specificity of any
claims employed in the proposed argument. Con-
sider, for example, the argument thesis (i.e., the
topic) of Figure 1: (THESIS) Would we like to live
in the world of Harry Potter? Construction of an
argument in support or in opposition to this the-
sis necessarily requires knowing the stance of the
claims that comprise it: the claim Magic opens a
lot of interesting possibilities should be identified
as a claim in support of the THESIS, and The ca-
pacity of harm is greater when magic is involved
(HARM), as a claim in opposition. Indeed, pre-

vious work has studied this task (e.g., Bar-Haim
et al. (2017); Faulkner (2014)).

It is not sufficient, however, to determine claim
stance only with respect to the argument thesis.
Debate and argument generation systems, in gen-
eral, should also be able to determine whether two
claims that address the same line of reasoning rep-
resent the same, or the opposing stance: using De-
fense is also made easier through magic to refute
the HARM claim in Figure 1, for example, requires
recognizing that it represents the opposite stance.

The issue of claim specificity in argumentation
has been much less addressed. Existing work,
however, suggests that a high degree of speci-
ficity is correlated with argument quality and per-
suasiveness (Carlile et al., 2018; Swanson et al.,
2015). In terms of argument quality though, it is
entirely possible for the presented claims to be co-
herent and meaningful, yet be too specific within
the given discourse, and therefore be logically ir-
relevant (Dessalles, 2016). As a concrete example,
suppose we wanted to assert a claim in support
of the argument THESIS of Figure 1. While The
Unforgivable Curses are illegal...and their use is
grounds for immediate life imprisonment supports
the THESIS, it is too specific a claim to introduce
at this point in the argument. Namely, it doesn’t
flow naturally without first introducing the concept
of Unforgivable Curses.

To date, existing work on understanding claim
specificity and stance has mostly employed an-
notated monologic persuasive documents or dis-
cussion forums and, as a result has been lim-
ited to the study of argumentative structures that
are relatively shallow, most often only consisting
of claims that directly support or oppose the ar-
gument thesis (Bar-Haim et al., 2017; Faulkner,
2014).

To support the generation of diverse and po-
tentially complex arguments on a topic of choice,
we present here a dataset of manually curated



4631

Figure 1: Partial tree for the controversial topic “Would we like to live in the world of Harry Potter?”. Each claim’s
position towards its parent argument is indicated in the box on the edge between the claim and its parent. The full
argument tree for this topic can be found at https://www.kialo.com/is-the-world-of-harry-potter-really-the-place-
to-be-2415/2415.0=2415.1.

argument trees for 741 controversial topics cov-
ering 95,312 unique claims. In contrast to ex-
isting datasets, ours consists of argument trees
where each root node represents the argument the-
sis (main claim) and every other node represents
a claim that either supports or opposes its parent.
Taking advantage of this relatively complex argu-
mentative structure, we formulate two prediction
tasks to study relative specificity and stance. The
main contributions of our study are the following:

• We provide a publicly available dataset of ar-
gument trees consisting of a diverse set sup-
porting and opposing claims for 741 contro-
versial topics1.

• We propose two novel settings to study claim
specificity and stance in the context of a di-
verse set of supporting and opposing points.

• We control for specific aspects of the argu-
ment tree (e.g., depth, stance) in our exper-
iments to understand their effect on claim
specificity and stance detection.

2 Dataset

We extracted argument trees for 741 controversial
topics from www.kialo.com2. Kialo is a collabora-
tive platform where users provide supporting and
opposing claims for each claim related to a contro-
versial issue. Besides providing the claims them-
selves, users also help to improve the quality of

time we collected the data.

existing claims by suggesting edits, and rating the
quality of claims. This process of collaborative
editing helps to create a high quality, diverse set
of supporting and opposing points for each con-
troversial topic3.

The dataset includes diverse set of controver-
sial topics. Each controversial topic is represented
by a thesis and tagged to be related to pre-defined
generic categories such as Politics, Ethics, Society
and Technology4. Figure 2(a) shows the number
of controversial topics with the given pre-defined
categories. The controversial topics’ theses in-
clude: “A free Press is necessary to democracy.”,
“All drugs should be legalised.”, “A society with
no gender would be better.”, “Hate speech should
be banned”, etc.

2.1 Structure of the arguments
The arguments for each controversial topic are
represented as trees. The root node of each such
tree represents the thesis of the controversial topic.
Every other node in the tree represents a claim that
either supports or opposes its parent claim. Fig-
ure 1 shows a partial argument tree for the the-
sis “Would we like to live in the world of Harry
Potter?”. We see that besides the supporting and
opposing claims for the thesis, there are support-
ing and opposing claims for the claims at different
depths. With this structure, we can identify in-
direct support/oppose relationships even between
nodes without parent-child relationships if they

pre-defined categories.

(a) Number of controversial topics with the given pre-
defined categories. Note that a controversial topic
could be related to multiple pre-defined categories.

(b) Number of claims at given depths. The majority of the
claims lie at the depth 3 or higher.

(c) Number of trees with given range of total number of
claims. For the majority of trees, the argument tree has
more than 30 claims in the tree. Average number of claims
per argument tree is 127.

majority of trees, the depth of the argument tree is 4 or
higher, and average depth per argument tree is 5.

are on the same argument path. For example,
the claim “Defense is also made easier through
magic” indirectly supports the thesis, since it is in
opposition with its parent “The capacity of harm is
greater when the magic is involved”, which is an
opposing claim to the thesis. Another observation
is that as we go deeper along an argument path, the
claims get more specific, since each claim aims to
either support or oppose its parent. For example,
while the claim “The capacity of harm is greater
when the magic is involved” refers to the general
harms that can be caused by magic, one of its child
claims “There is a great capacity to harm others
using the Unforgivable Curses” is more specific as
it refers to harm via a particular set of curses in
magic.

2.2 Data Statistics

The dataset consists of argument trees for 741
controversial topics comprised of 95, 312 unique
claims. The distribution of argument trees with
the given range of total claims, and depth is shown
in Figures 2(c) and 2(d) respectively. We see that
for the majority of trees, the depth is 4 or higher,
and the number of claims is greater than 30.

Figure 2(b) shows the total number of claims

at a given depth. We see that only 7, 618 out of
95, 312 claims are directly supporting or opposing
the theses of the controversial topics. The majority
of the claims lie at the depth 3 or higher. This
shows that the dataset has a rich set of supporting
and opposing claims for not only for the theses,
but for claims at different depths of the tree.

In total, there are 44,572 claims that are sup-
porting and 50,740 claims that are opposing their
parent claims. 90% of claims consist of 1 (61%) to
2 (29%) sentences and average number of tokens
per claim is 30.

3 Claim Specificity

Determining the relative specificity of arguments
is an important step towards being able to generate
logically relevant arguments in a given discourse
(Dessalles, 2016). For a system that disregards the
relative specificity of claims, it is entirely possible
to generate coherent and meaningful, yet logically
irrelevant claims, when the generated claims are
either too generic or specific for the given argu-
ment discourse.

In this work, we determine the relative speci-
ficity between a pair of claims that are along the

which are then fed into a bi-directional GRU, to encode the path. In the figure, Ei represents the input embedding

model, and Rpair i is the representation of Pair i.

same argument path from the thesis to a given leaf
claim. We note that specificity always increases
along a given path, as each child claim is address-
ing some aspect of its parent claim, by either sup-
porting or opposing, and therefore by definition
has to be more specific. While an increase in
depth is correlated with an increase in specificity
for claims within a given argument path, this cor-
relation does not necessarily hold for claims across
different argument paths within a tree5. One im-
portant note is that we use the path information
only as a way to reliably generate specificity la-
bels, without requiring human annotations. The
task of relative specificity detection itself does not
require any path information to be present, nor do
we make any assumptions in our models about the
availability of path information.

For this task, given a pair of claims, we want
the model to determine whether the second claim
is more specific than the first claim. We note that
unlike in stance prediction, we never provide the

5We also cannot guarantee that these claims are com-
pletely irrelevant and specificity comparison is not applica-
ble. We would need human annotation for these cases to be
able to make any claims for the relative specificity.

path information between a pair of claims, as this
would be equivalent to giving the gold label as in-
put to the model, since given the path, the relative
specificity is deterministic.

3.1 Results and Analysis

Baseline. We experiment with feature-based Lo-
gistic Regression (LR) model that incorporates all
the features that are shown to be effective in deter-
mining sentence specificity (Louis and Nenkova,
2012). For example, this feature list includes po-
larity of the claims (Wilson et al., 2005), number
of personal pronouns in the claims, and length of
the claims since (Louis and Nenkova, 2012) shows
that generic sentences have stronger polarity, less
number of personal pronouns and are shorter in
length. While Ko et al. (2019) has also looked
at the task of specificity prediction, we cannot di-
rectly apply their models to our data, since their
annotation scheme requires each sentence to be
labelled as general or specific, whereas we argue
that specificity is relative.

Fine-tuned BERT. We compare our baselines
with a fine-tuned BERT model (Devlin et al.,
2018). BERT is a pre-trained deep bidirectional

transformer model that can encode sentences into
dense vector representations. It is trained on large
un-annotated corpora such as Wikipedia and the
BooksCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) using two differ-
ent learning objectives, namely masked language
model and next sentence prediction. These learn-
ing objectives together allow the model to learn
representations that can be easily fine-tuned to
achieve state-of-the-art performance for a wide
range of natural language processing tasks.

For relative specificity detection, we feed the
pair of claims as a single sequence with the spe-
cial [SEP] token between the claims, and a [CLS]
token at the beginning of the sequence, as shown
in Figure 2, into a pre-trained BERT model6. In
addition, we indicate each token in the first claim
(as well as the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens) as belong-
ing to sentence A, and each token in the second
claim as belonging to sentence B, which is used
by the BERT model to add the appropriate learned
sentence embedding to each token. Note that this
approach of packing a pair of claims into a sin-
gle sequence is consistent with the input represen-
tation from (Devlin et al., 2018), for tasks where
the input is a pair of sequences. We then take the
output of the [CLS] token from the final layer of
the BERT model, and feed it into a classification
layer. We fine-tune7 this architecture for relative
specificity detection.

We split our data into train, development and
test sets, by topic, which ensures that all nodes
from the same tree are confined to a single split.
We split the data in this way in order to encourage
our models to learn more domain independent fea-
tures, that are applicable across the diverse set of
controversial topics. Number of examples in each
split for each task is shown in Table 1.

Table 2 compares the performance of the dif-
6Specifically, we use the BERT-Base (Uncased) model,

which contains 12 layers of bidirectional transformers, with
a hidden size of 768 units and 12 attention heads (for a total
of 110M parameters).

learning rate of 2e-5. We ran the fine-tuning jobs for a max-
imum of 5 epochs, and used the validation performance for
early stopping.

ferent models for relative specificity, across three
different settings. In the first setting, we evalu-
ate the models across all claim pairs that occur in
the same argument path in a given tree. We then
control for the distance between the pair, in the
second setting, by evaluating only across pairs of
nodes that are distance 1 from each other, i.e. have
a parent-child relationship. Finally, we control for
the stance, in the third setting, and evaluate across
pairs of claims that have the same stance relative
to their parent.

Analysis. Consistent with previous work (Li
and Nenkova, 2015), we find that length is highly
predictive of specificity and more specific claims
are longer than more generic claims. Across all
settings, the fine-tuned BERT model achieves the
best performance. As expected, the performance
degrades, for all models, as we control for distance
and stance, since the claims get more similar in
language, for both cases.

Table 4 shows the top weighted words by BOW
model for each class. We find that connectives
(such as also, but, because, when) are associated
more with arguments with higher specificity as
they are mostly used to add more specific informa-
tion to the claims as also found by Lugini and Lit-
man (2017), whereas concept words (such as so-
ciety, world, gender) have higher association with
more generic arguments since these words repre-
sents the concepts of the controversial topics that
people argue about.

We further evaluate our models for the claim
pairs with distance values 2 to 5 as shown in Ta-
ble 3. We find that BERT model is consistently
the best performing model for all distance pairs.
As we increase the distance, the models achieve
higher prediction performance despite having less
training examples for higher distance values.

4 Claim Stance Detection

It is not sufficient for debate and argument gener-
ation systems to determine the claim stance only
with respect to the argument thesis; it is also nec-
essary to determine the stance between any pair
of claims that address the same line of reasoning.
An argument generation system, for example, may
need to generate arguments that oppose some of
the opponent’s previous claims while supporting
some of its own previous claims during the debate
which would require to determine the stance be-
tween any candidate claims and the claims in the

previous argument discourse.
In this work, given a claim A at depth d and

claim B at depth > d along the same argument
path, we determine whether B (in)directly SUP-
PORTS or OPPOSES A (stance). If A and B do
not have parent-child relationship, we determine
whether B indirectly SUPPORTS or OPPOSES A by
considering support/oppose relationship of each
parent-child claims between A and B. Follow-
ing the example shown in Figure 1, the claim “The
capacity of harm is greater when the magic is in-
volved” is directly supported by the claim “There
is a great capacity to harm others using the Un-
forgivable Curses”, with a direct parent-child re-
lationship. However, the argument “The Unfor-
givable Curses are illegal in the wizarding world
and their use is grounds for immediate life impris-
onment in Azkaban Prison” is indirectly oppos-
ing the same claim, by rebutting it’s parent, which
presents a supporting point for the claim.

4.1 Results and Analysis

We experiment with a feature-based Logistic Re-
gression model and a fine-tuned BERT model (De-
vlin et al., 2018) using the same strategy to split
the data into train, development and test sets as in
Section 3.1.

Baseline. Our feature-based model employs
features shown to be effective in stance detection
tasks (Mohammad et al., 2016) such as bag of
words, word match, sentiment match, document
embedding similarity, and MPQA subjectivity fea-
tures (Wilson et al., 2005)8. We cannot evaluate
the model from Sun et al. (2018) as a baseline,
as that requires additional annotations for argu-
ment phrases for the given topics. Similarly, we
cannot evaluate the model from Bar-Haim et al.
(2017) as a baseline, since it would require addi-
tional annotations for target phrases in each claim,
polarity towards the target phrases, and consis-
tent/contrastive labels between the target phrases
of two claims.

Fine-tuned BERT. We feed a pair of claims
into a pre-trained BERT model, in the same man-
ner as detailed above for relative specificity detec-
tion, and take the output of the [CLS] token from
final layer and feed it into a classifier. We fine-tune
this model for relative stance detection.

Fine-tuned BERT with path (simple). In this
model, we incorporate path information in a very
naı̈ve manner. For a given pair of claims A and

8For Featured-based LR with path, we concatenate the all
claims along an argument path, and extract features from this
concatenated sequence.

B, where A is a predecessor of B, we concatenate
the path of claims starting from B up to A with
each claim separated by the special [SEP] token.
We indicate each token from claim B as belong-
ing to sentence A, and the tokens from all other
claims in the path, including claim A, are indicated
as belonging to sentence B. We note that this way
of processing the input is similar to how (Devlin
et al., 2018) processed their input for the QA task.
Similar to the previous model, we feed the out-
put of the [CLS] token from the final layer into a
classifier. We then fine-tune this model for relative
stance classification.

Fine-tuned BERT with path (hierarchical).
We hypothesize that the task of determining rel-
ative stance becomes easier, if we can follow
along the argument path and determine the rela-
tive stance between parent-child claims. We in-
corporate this inductive bias into the model by
constructing a hierarchical architecture for relative
stance classification, as shown in Figure 2. First,
we feed each parent-child pair along an argument
path as a single sequence into the BERT encoder,
separated by the [SEP] token, and take the repre-
sentation of the [CLS] token from final layer of
the BERT model, as the pair representations. We
then feed the sequence of pair representations into
a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho
et al., 2014), to get the path representation. In our
experiments, we used a single bidirectional GRU
layer with 128 units. The output of the last token
from the forward GRU, and the output of the first
token from the backward GRU are concatenated
together to get the final path representation. We
then feed this into a classifier to predict relative
stance. We fine-tune this architecture for relative
stance classification.

Table 5 compares the performance of the differ-
ent models for argument stance detection, across
two different settings. In the first setting, we eval-
uate the models only across pairs of claims that are

distance 1 from each other, i.e. in a parent-child
relationship. In the second setting, we evaluate
the model across all pairs that occur in the same
argument path in a given tree with and without
incorporating the claims along the argument path
between these pair of claims.

Analysis. We find that the fine-tuned BERT
models perform much better than the feature based
models and baselines, across both the settings.
Also, as we hypothesized, having the argument
path information is useful for determining relative
stance between claims that do not have a parent-
child relationship, as the BERT models with path
information consistently perform better in the sec-
ond setting, with the hierarchical BERT model be-
ing the best. In our dataset, an argument path
from the tree is the best approximation that we
have for an argumentative discourse, and as such
our results suggest that considering discourse level
context is useful in determining relative stance be-
tween two claims. However, as shown by our re-
sults, our models can still be employed when there
is limited or no discourse information.

The performance degrades significantly9 in the
second setting, where we include claim pairs with
all the distances, implying that it is easier to deter-
mine the stance relative to the parent, than claims
that are further on the same path.

We do a more fine grained analysis of the per-
formance of the fine-tuned BERT models, at dif-
ferent distances, which we present in Table 6.
As expected, performance degrades for all mod-
els as the distance between the pair of claims in-
creases. We find that at distance d=4 Fine-tuned
BERT model that incorporates path information in
a simple manner performs similarly to the model
without path information. The hierarchical model,
however, performs significantly better, which fur-
ther justifies our choice to treat the argument path

5 Related Work

Argumentation Generation. Previous work in
argument generation has focused on generating
summaries of opinionated text (Wang and Ling,
2016), rebuttals for a given argument (Jitnah et al.,
2000), paraphrases from predicate/argument struc-
ture (Kozlowski et al., 2003), generation via sen-
tence retrieval (Sato et al., 2015) and developing
argumentative dialogue agents (Le et al., 2018;
Rakshit et al., 2017). The work on develop-
ing argumentative dialogue agents, in particular,
has employed mostly social media data such as
IAC (Walker et al., 2012c) to design retrieval-
based or generative models to make argumenta-
tive responses to the users. These models, how-
ever, employ very limited context in generating
the claims, and there is no notion of generating
a claim with a particular stance or the appropri-
ate level of specificity within the context. Further-
more, these models are trained on social media
conversations, which can be noisy, and as noted
by Rakshit et al. (2017), many sentences either do
not express an argument or cannot be understood
out of context. In contrast, our dataset explicitly
provides the sequence of claims in an argument
path that leads to any particular claim, which can
enable an argument generation system to generate
relevant claims, with a particular stance and at the
right level of specificity. Recent work by Hua and
Wang (2018) studies the task of generating claims
of a different stance for a given statement, how-
ever their context is limited to the given statement
and they do not take specificity into account.

Stance Detection. Previous work on claim
stance detection has studied the important linguis-
tic features to determine the stance of a claim rel-
ative to a thesis/main claim (Somasundaran and
Wiebe, 2009, 2010; Walker et al., 2012a,b; Hasan
and Ng, 2013; Sridhar et al., 2014; Thomas et al.,
2006; Yessenalina et al., 2010; Burfoot et al.,

2011; Kwon et al., 2007; Faulkner, 2014; Bar-
Haim et al., 2017). Some of these studies have
shown that simple linear classifiers with uni-gram
and n-gram features are effective for this task
(Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Hasan and Ng,
2013; Mohammad et al., 2016). However, in our
setting, since we try to predict the stance between
all pairs of claims on an argument path, rather
than simply claims that are directed towards the
thesis or the parent claim, we find that the mod-
els with a hierarchical representation of the argu-
ment path, i.e. the context, significantly outper-
form these baselines.

Argument Structure and Quality. There has
been tremendous amount of work in computa-
tional argumentation mining focusing on deter-
mining argumentative components (Mochales and
Moens, 2011; Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Nguyen
and Litman, 2015) and argument structure in text
(Palau and Moens, 2009; Biran and Rambow,

ity dimensions (Wachsmuth et al., 2017; Carlile
et al., 2018) and the characteristics of persua-
sive arguments (Kelman, 1961; Burgoon et al.,
1975; Chaiken, 1987; Tykocinskl et al., 1994;
Chambliss and Garner, 1996; Durmus and Cardie,

Durik et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2014; Marquart and
Naderer, 2016; Durmus and Cardie, 2019). Ex-
isting work on claim specificity and stance detec-
tion has mostly employed datasets extracted from
monologic documents that include more shallow
support/oppose structures (Bar-Haim et al., 2017;
Faulkner, 2014). Although there has been some
work on constructing argument structure datasets
using news sources (Reed et al., 2008), micro-
texts (Peldszus, 2014) and user comments (Park
and Cardie, 2018), these structures tend to be shal-
lower and include fewer opposing claims since
they employ existing monologic texts that are rel-



4638

atively short. In contrast, the dataset we provide
is constructed with the goal of providing support-
ing and opposing claims for each of the claim pre-
sented in an argument tree. Therefore, these argu-
ment tree structures are deeper and have more bal-
anced number of supporting and opposing claims.

6 Conclusion

We present a new dataset of manually curated ar-
gument trees, which can open interesting avenues
of research in argumentation. We use this dataset
to study methods for determining claim stance and
relative claim specificity for complex argumenta-
tive structures. We find that it is easier to predict
stance for claims that have a parent-child relation-
ship, where as relative specificity is more difficult
to predict in the same case. For future work, it may
be interesting to understand which other models
would be effective in claim specificity and stance
detection tasks. Besides, developing techniques
to incorporate the claim stance and specificity de-
tection models in argument generation to generate
more coherent and consistent arguments is another
interesting research direction to be explored.
