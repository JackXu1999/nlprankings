Abstract

Linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of
transferring linguistic constructions (lexical,
phonological, morphological, and syntactic)
from a “donor” language to a “recipient” lan-
guage as a result of contacts between commu-
nities speaking different languages. Borrowed
words are found in all languages, and—in con-
trast to cognate relationships—borrowing rela-
tionships may exist across unrelated languages
(for example, about 40% of Swahili’s vocabu-
lary is borrowed from Arabic). In this paper,
we develop a model of morpho-phonological
transformations across languages with features
based on universal constraints from Optimality
Theory (OT). Compared to several standard—
but linguistically naïve—baselines, our OT-
inspired model obtains good performance with
only a few dozen training examples, making
this a cost-effective strategy for sharing lexical
information across languages.

1 Introduction

We may imagine that globalization is a modern phe-
nomenon, but the lexicons of the world’s languages
attest to the fact that robust interaction between
communities of speakers of different languages is
widespread throughout history. Language contact
breeds linguistic borrowing—a phenomenon as old
as language itself—adoption and nativization of
phonemes, morphemes, words, and syntactic con-
structions from another language (Thomason and
Kaufman, 2001).

Contact-induced borrowing is a fundamental re-
search topic in linguistics; however, in computational

linguistics, very limited work has addressed model-
ing this phenomenon. The problem we address is
the identification of plausible donor words (in the
donor language) given a loanword (in the recipient
language), and vice versa, identification of loanwords
given a donor. For example, given a Swahili loan-
word safari ‘journey’, our model identifies its Arabic
donor éK
Q 	® (sfryh)1 ‘journey’ (§2). Although at a
high level, this is an instance of the well-known prob-
lem of modeling string transductions, our interest is
being able to identify correspondences across lan-
guages with minimal supervision, so as to make the
technique applicable in low-resource settings. To re-
duce the supervision burden, we propose a model that
includes awareness of the morpho-phonological re-
pair strategies that native speakers of a language sub-
consciously employ to adapt a loanword to phonolog-
ical constraints of the recipient language (§3). To this
end, we use constraint-based theories of phonology,
as exemplified by Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince
and Smolensky, 2008; McCarthy, 2009), which non-
computational linguistic work has demonstrated to
be particularly well suited to account for phonolog-
ically complex borrowing processes (Kang, 2011).
We operationalize OT constraints as features in our
borrowing model (§4).

We conduct a case study on Arabic and Swahili,
two unrelated languages with a long history of con-
tact; we then apply the model to additional language
pairs (§5). The proposed approach significantly out-
performs transliteration and cognate discovery mod-
els (§6).

Figure 1: Our morpho-phonological borrowing model conceptually has three main parts: (1) conversion of orthographic
word forms to pronunciations in IPA format; (2) generation of loanword pronunciation candidates; (3) ranking of
generated candidates using Optimality-Theoretic constraints. Part (1) and (2) are rule-based, (1) uses pronunciation
dictionaries, (2) is based on prior linguistic studies; part (3) is learned. In (3) we learn OT constraint weights from a few
dozen automatically extracted training examples.

2 Methodology

Our task is to identify plausible donor–loan word
pairs in a language pair. While modeling string trans-
ductions is a well-studied problem in NLP, we wish
to be able to learn the cross-lingual correspondences
from minimal amounts of data, so we propose a
linguistically-motivated approach: we formulate a
scoring model inspired by Optimality Theory (OT;
discussed below), in which borrowing candidates are
ranked by universal constraints posited to underly the
human faculty of language, and the candidates are
determined by transduction processes articulated in
prior studies of contact linguistics.

As shown in figure 1, our model is conceptually
divided into three main parts: (1) mapping of ortho-
graphic word forms in two languages into a common
space of their phonetic representation; (2) generation
of loanword pronunciation candidates from a donor
word; (3) ranking of generated loanword candidates,
based on linguistic constraints of the donor and re-
cipient languages. Parts (1) and (2) are rule-based;
whereas (3) is learned. Each component of the model
is discussed in detail in the following sections.

The model is implemented within a finite-state
cascade. Parts (1) and (2) amount to unweighted
string transformation operations. In (1), we convert
orthographic word forms to their pronunciations in
the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), these are
pronunciation transducers. In (2) we syllabify donor
pronunciations, then perform insertion, deletion, and
substitution of phonemes and morphemes (affixes), to
generate multiple loanword candidates from a donor
word. Although string transformation transducers
in (2) can generate loanword candidates that are not
found in a recipient language vocabulary, such can-

didates are filtered out due to composition with the
recipient language lexicon acceptor.

We perform string transformations from donor to
recipient (recapitulating the historical process). How-
ever, the resulting relation (i.e., the final composed
transducer) is a bidirectional model which can just as
well be used to reason about underlying donor forms
given recipient forms. To employ the model in a
specific direction, one needs to optimize parameters—
weights on transitions—to generate a desired set of
outputs from a specific input. Our model is trained to
discriminate a donor word given a loanword. In part
(3), candidates are “evaluated” (i.e., scored) with a
weighted sum of universal constraint violations. The
non-negative weights, which we call “cost vector”,
constitute our model parameters and are learned us-
ing a small training set of donor–recepient pairs. We
use a shortest path algorithm to find the path with the
minimal cost.

OT: constraint-based evaluation Our decision to
evaluate borrowing candidates by weighting counts
of “constraint violations” is based on Optimality The-
ory, which has shown that complex surface phenom-
ena can be well-explained as the interaction of con-
straints on the form of outputs and the relationships
of inputs and outputs (Kager, 1999). Although our
linear scoring scheme departs from OT’s standard
evaluation assumptions (namely, the assumption of
an ordinal constraint ranking and strict dominance
rather than constraint “weighting”), we are still able
to obtain effective models.

Although originally a theory of monolingual
phonology, OT has been adapted to account for bor-
rowing by treating the donor language word as the
underlying form for the recipient language; that is,

599



the phonological system of the recipient language is
encoded as a system of constraints, and these con-
straints account for how the donor word is adapted
when borrowed. There has been substantial prior
work in linguistics on borrowing in the OT paradigm
(Yip, 1993; Davidson and Noyer, 1997; Jacobs and
Gussenhoven, 2000; Kang, 2003; Broselow, 2004;
Adler, 2006; Rose and Demuth, 2006; Kenstowicz
and Suchato, 2006; Kenstowicz, 2007; Mwita, 2009),
but none of it has led to computational realizations.

3 Generating loanword candidates

In this section, we use the Arabic–Swahili language-
pair to describe the prototypical linguistic adaptation
processes that words undergo when borrowed. Then,
we describe how we model these processes.2

3.1 Case study: Arabic–Swahili borrowing
The Swahili lexicon has been influenced by Arabic
due to a prolonged period of language contact in the
Indian Ocean trading (800 A.D.–1920), as well as the
influence of Islam (Rothman, 2002). According to
several independent studies, Arabic loanwords consti-
tute from 18% (Hurskainen, 2004) to 40% (Johnson,
1939) of Swahili word types.

Despite a strong susceptibility of Swahili to bor-
rowing and a large fraction of Swahili words originat-
ing from Arabic, the two languages are typologically
distinct with profoundly dissimilar phonological and
morpho-syntactic systems. Therefore, Arabic loan-
words have been substantially adapted to conform to
Swahili phonotactics, which we survey briefly. First,
Arabic has five syllable patterns:3 CV, CVV, CVC,
CVCC, and CVVC (McCarthy, 1985, pp. 23–28),
whereas Swahili (like other Bantu languages) is char-
acterized by the syllable ending with a vowel and CV
or V syllable structure. At the segment level, Swahili
loanword adaptation thus involves extensive vowel
epenthesis in consonant clusters and at a syllable fi-
nal position if the syllable ends with a consonant,
e.g., : H. A�J» (ktAb) → kitabu ‘book’ (Polomé, 1967;
Schadeberg, 2009; Mwita, 2009). Second, phonologi-
cal adaptation in Swahili loanwords includes shorten-
ing of vowels (unlike Arabic, Swahili does not have

2For simplicity, we subsume Omani Arabic and other histori-
cal dialects of Arabic under the label “Arabic”; similarly, we sub-
sume Swahili, its dialects and protolanguages under “Swahili”.

3C stands for consonant, and V for vowel.

phonemic length); substitution of consonants that are
found in Arabic but not in Swahili (e.g., emphatic
(pharyngealized) /tQ/→/t/, voiceless velar fricative
/x/→/k/, dental fricatives /T/→/s/, /D/→/z/, and
the voiced velar fricative /G/→/g/); adoption of Ara-
bic phonemes that were not originally present in
Swahili /T/, /D/, /G/ (e.g., QK


	Ym��' (tH*yr)→ tahad-
hari ‘warning’); degemination of Arabic geminate
consonants (e.g., �Qå� ($r~)→ shari ‘evil’). Finally,
adapted loanwords can freely undergo Swahili inflec-
tional and derivational processes, e.g., QK
 	PñË@ (Alwzyr)
→ waziri ‘minister’, mawaziri ‘ministers’, kiuwaziri
‘ministerial’ (Zawawi, 1979; Schadeberg, 2009).

3.2 Arabic–Swahili borrowing transducers

We describe unweighted transducers for pronuncia-
tion, syllabification, and morphological and phono-
logical adaptation. An example that illustrates some
of the possible string transformations by individual
components of the model is shown in figure 2. The
goal of these transducers is to minimally overgener-
ate Swahili adapted forms of Arabic words, based on
the adaptations described above.

Pronunciation. Based on the IPA, we assign
shared symbols to sounds that exist in both sound
systems of Arabic and Swahili (e.g., nasals /n/, /m/;
voiced stops /b/, /d/), and language-specific unique
symbols to sounds that are unique to the phonemic
inventory of Arabic (e.g., pharyngeal voiced and
voiceless fricatives /è/, /Q/) or Swahili (e.g., velar
nasal /N/). For Swahili, we construct a pronunciation
dictionary based on the Omniglot grapheme-to-IPA
mapping.4 In Arabic, we use the CMU Arabic
vowelized pronunciation dictionary containing about
700K types which has an average of four pronuncia-
tions per word (Metze et al., 2010).5 We then design
four transducers—Arabic and Swahili word-to-IPA
and IPA-to-word transducers—each as a union of
linear chain transducers, as well as one acceptor per
pronunciation dictionary listing.

5Since we are working at the level of word types which

have no context, we cannot disambiguate the intended form, so
we include all options. For example, for the input word AK. A�J»
(ktAbA) ‘book.sg.indef’, we use both pronunciations /kitAbA/
and /kuttAbA/.

Syllabification. Arabic words borrowed into
Swahili undergo a repair of violations of the Swahili
segmental and phonotactic constraints, for example
via vowel epenthesis in a consonant cluster. Impor-
tantly, repair depends upon syllabification. To simu-
late plausible phonological repair processes, we gen-
erate multiple syllabification variants for input pro-
nunciations. The syllabification transducer optionally
inserts syllable separators between phones. For ex-
ample, for an input phonetic sequence /kuttAbA/, the
output strings include /ku.t.tA.bA/, /kut.tA.bA/, and
/ku.ttA.bA/ as syllabification variants; each variant
violates different constraints and consequently trig-
gers different phonological adaptation.

Phonological adaptation. Phonological adapta-
tion of syllabified phone sequences is the crux of
the loanword adaptation process. We implement
phonological adaptation transducers as a composi-
tion of plausible context-dependent insertions, dele-
tions, and substitutions of phone subsets, based on
prior studies summarized in §3.1. In what follows,
we list phonological adaptation components in the
order of transducer composition in the borrowing
model. The vowel deletion transducer shortens Ara-
bic long vowels and vowel clusters. The consonant
degemination transducer shortens Arabic geminate
consonants, e.g., it degeminates /tt/ in /ku.ttA.bA/,
outputting /ku.tA.bA/. The substitution of similar
phonemes transducer substitutes similar phonemes
and phonemes that are found in Arabic but not in
Swahili (Polomé, 1967, p. 45). For example, the em-
phatic /tQ/, /dQ/, /sQ/ are replaced by the correspond-
ing non-emphatic segments [t], [d], [s]. The vowel
epenthesis transducer inserts a vowel between pairs
of consonants (/ku.ttA.bA/ → /ku.tatA.bA/), and at
the end of a syllable, if the syllable ends with a con-

sonant (/ku.t.tA.bA/ → /ku.ta.tA.bA/). Sometimes
it is possible to predict the final vowel of a word,
depending on the word-final coda consonant of its
Arabic counterpart: /u/ or /o/ added if an Arabic
donor ends with a labial, and /i/ or /e/ added after
coronals and dorsals (Mwita, 2009). Following these
rules, the final vowel substitution transducer com-
plements the inventory of final vowels in loanword
candidates.

Morphological adaptation. Both Arabic and
Swahili have significant morphological processes
that alter the appearance of lemmas. To deal with
morphological variants, we construct morphological
adaptation transducers that optionally strip Arabic
concatenative affixes and clitics, and then optionally
append Swahili affixes, generating a superset of all
possible loanword hypotheses. We obtain the list
of Arabic affixes from the Arabic morphological an-
alyzer SAMA (Maamouri et al., 2010); the Swahili
affixes are taken from a hand-crafted Swahili mor-
phological analyzer (Littell et al., 2014).

4 Learning constraint weights

Due to the computational problems of working with
OT (Eisner, 1997; Eisner, 2002), we make sim-
plifying assumptions by (1) bounding the theoret-
ically infinite set of underlying forms with a small
linguistically-motivated subset of allowed transfor-
mations on donor pronunciations, as described in §3;
(2) imposing a priori restrictions on the set of the
surface realizations by intersecting the candidate set
with the recipient pronunciation lexicon; (3) assum-
ing that the set of constraints is finite and regular
(Ellison, 1994); and (4) assigning linear weights to
constraints, rather than learning an ordinal constraint
ranking (Boersma and Hayes, 2001; Goldwater and

601

MAX-IO-MORPH no (donor) affix deletion

Table 1: Faithfulness constraints prefer pronounced re-
alizations completely congruent with their underlying
forms.

Johnson, 2003).
OT distinguishes “markedness” constraints (Mc-

Carthy and Prince, 1995), which detect dispreferred
phonetic patterns in the language, and “faithfulness”
constraints (Prince and Smolensky, 2008), which en-
sure correspondences between the underlying form
and the surface candidates.6 The implemented con-
straints are listed in tables 1 and 2. Faithfulness con-
straints are integrated in phonological transformation
components as transitions following each insertion,
deletion, or substitution. Markedness constraints are
implemented as standalone identity transducers: in-
puts are equal outputs, but path weights representing
candidate evaluation with respect to violated con-
straints are different.

The final “loanword transducer” is the composition
of all transducers described in §3 and OT constraint
transducers. A path in the transducer represents a
syllabified phonemic sequence along with (weighted)

6To clarify the distinction between faithfulness and marked-
ness constraint groups to the NLP readership, we can draw the
following analogy to the components of machine translation or
speech recognition: faithfulness constraints are analogical to
the translation model or acoustic model (reflecting input), while
markedness constraints are analogical to the language model
(requiring well-formedness of the output). Without faithfulness
constraints, the optimal surface form could differ arbitrarily from
the underlying form.

Markedness constraints

NO-CODA syllables must not have a coda
ONSET syllables must have onsets
PEAK there is only one syllabic peak
SSP complex onsets rise in sonority,

complex codas fall in sonority
*COMPLEX-S no consonant clusters on syllable margins
*COMPLEX-C no consonant clusters within a syllable
*COMPLEX-V no vowel clusters

Table 2: Markedness constraints impose language-
specific structural well-formedness of surface realizations.

OT constraints it violates, and shortest path outputs
are those, whose cumulative weight of violated con-
straints is minimal.

OT constraints are realized as features in our linear
model, and feature weights are learned in a discrimi-
native training to maximize the accuracy obtained by
the loanword transducer on a small development set
of donor–recipient pairs. For parameter estimation,
we employ the Nelder–Mead algorithm (Nelder and
Mead, 1965), a heuristic derivative-free method that
iteratively optimizes, based on an objective function
evaluation, the convex hull of n+1 simplex vertices.7

The objective function is the “soft accuracy” of the
development set, defined as the proportion of cor-
rectly identified donor words in the total set of 1-best
outputs.

5 Adapting the model to a new language

Although we conduct a thorough case study on the
Arabic–Swahili language pair, our methodology can
easily be generalized to other language pairs. String
transformation operations, as well as OT constraints
are language-universal. The only adaptation required
is a linguistic analysis to identify plausible morpho-
phonological repair strategies for the new language
pair (i.e., a subset of allowed insertions, deletions and
substitutions of phonemes and morphemes). Since
we need only to overgenerate candidates (the OT con-
straints will filter bad outputs), the effort is minimal
relative to many other grammar engineering exer-
cises. The second language-specific component is the
grapheme-to-IPA converter. While this can be a non-

7The decision to use Nelder–Mead rather than more conven-
tional gradient-based optimization algorithms was motivated by
practical limitations of the finite-state toolkit we used that made
computing derivatives with latent structure impractical.

trivial problem in some cases, the problem is well
studied, and many under-resourced languages have
“phonographic” systems where orthography corre-
sponds to phonology, rather than organically evolved
written forms, which makes the mapping problem
trivial.

To illustrate the ease with which a language pair
can be engineered, we applied our borrowing model
to the French–Romanian language pair. Although
French and Romanian are sister languages (both de-
scending from Latin), about 12% of Romanian types
are true French borrowings that came into the lan-
guage in the past few centuries (Schulte, 2009). We
employ the GLOBALPHONE pronunciation dictio-
nary for French (Schultz and Schlippe, 2014) (we
convert it to IPA), and automatically construct a
Romanian pronunciation dictionary using Omniglot
grapheme-to-IPA conversion rules.

6 Experiments

Our experimental setup is defined as follows. The
input to the borrowing model is a loanword candi-
date in Swahili/Romanian,8 the outputs are plausible
donor words in the Arabic/French monolingual lexi-
con (i.e., any word in pronunciation dictionary). We
train the borrowing model using a small set of train-
ing examples, and then evaluate it using a held-out
test set. In the rest of this section we describe in
detail our datasets, tools, and experimental results.

Resources We employ Arabic–English and
Swahili–English bitexts to extract a training set
(corpora of sizes 5.4M and 14K sentence pairs,
respectively), using a cognate discovery technique
(Kondrak, 2001). Phonetically and semantically
similar strings are classified as cognates; phonetic
similarity is the string similarity between phonetic
representations, and semantic similarly is approxi-
mated by translation.9 We thereby extract Arabic

8Our model does not provide a mechanism for identifying
loanwords in the recipient language; we only model the borrow-
ing process. Classifying loanwords in the recipient language is
an interesting but ultimately different problem: the ontological
status of words in a lexicon is a difficult problem, even for human
experts, however, knowledge of cross-lingual correspondences
is a valuable feature, and as such, our work can be understood as
enabling this.

9This cognate discovery technique is sufficient to extract a
small training set, but is not generally applicable, as it requires

and Swahili pairs 〈a, s〉 that are phonetically similar
( ∆(a,s)min(|a|,|s|) < 0.5) where ∆(a, s) is the Levenshtein
distance between a and s and that are aligned to the
same English word e. FastAlign (Dyer et al., 2013)
is used for word alignments. Given an extracted
word pair 〈a, s〉, we also extract word pairs {〈a′, s〉}
for all proper Arabic words a′ which share the same
lemma with a producing on average 33 Arabic types
per Swahili type. We use MADA (Habash et al.,
2009) for Arabic morphological expansion.

From the resulting dataset of 490 extracted Arabic–
Swahili borrowing examples,10 we set aside ran-
domly sampled 73 examples (15%) for evaluation,11

and use the remaining 417 examples for model param-
eter optimization. For French–Romanian language
pair, we use an existing small annotated set of bor-
rowing examples,12 with 282 training and 50 (15%)
randomly sampled test examples.

We use pyfst—a Python interface to OpenFst
(Allauzen et al., 2007)—for the borrowing model
implementation.13

Baselines We compare our model to several base-
lines. In the Levenshtein (L) distance base-
lines we chose the closest word (either surface or
pronunciation-based). In the Levenshtein-weighted
(L-W) baselines, we evaluate a variant of the Lev-
enshtein distance tuned to identify cognates (Mann
and Yarowsky, 2001; Kondrak and Sherif, 2006); this
method was identified by Kondrak and Sherif (2006)
among the top three cognate identification methods.
In the CRF baselines we generate plausible “translit-
erations” of the input Swahili (or Romanian) words
in the donor lexicon using the model of Ammar et
al. (2012), with multiple references in a lattice and
without reranking. The CRF transliteration model
is a linear-chain CRF where we label each source
character with a sequence of target characters. The
features are label unigrams, label bigrams, and label

parallel corpora or manually constructed dictionaries to measure
semantic similarity. Large parallel corpora are unavailable for
most language pairs, including Swahili–English.

10In each training/test example one Swahili word corresponds
to all extracted Arabic donor words.

11We manually verified that our test set contains clear Arabic–
Swahili borrowings. For example, we extract Swahili kusafiri,
safari and Arabic Q 	®Ë@, Q 	®�
, Q 	® (Alsfr, ysAfr, sfr) all aligned
to ‘travel’.

conjoined with a moving window of source charac-
ters. In the OT-uniform baseline, we evaluate the ac-
curacy of the borrowing model with uniform weights,
thus shortest paths in the loanwords transducer will
be forms violating the fewest constraints.

Evaluation In addition to predictive accuracy on
all models (if a model produces multiple hypotheses
with the same 1-best weight, we count the proportion
of correct outputs in this set), we evaluate two partic-
ular aspects of our proposed model: (1) appropriate-
ness of the model family, and (2) the quality of the
learned OT constraint weights. The first aspect is de-
signed to evaluate whether the morpho-phonological
transformations implemented in the model are re-
quired and sufficient to generate loanwords from the
donor inputs. We report two evaluation measures:
model reachability and ambiguity. Reachability is
a percentage of test samples that are reachable (i.e.,
there is a path from the input test example to a cor-
rect output) in the loanword transducer. A naïve
model which generates all possible strings would
score 100% reachability, but it will be hard to set the
model parameters such that it discriminates between
good and bad candidates. In order to capture this
trade-off, we also report the inherent ambiguity of
our model, which is the average number of outputs
potentially generated per input. A generic Arabic–
Swahili transducer, for example, has an ambiguity
of 786,998—the size of the Arabic pronunciation
lexicon.

Results The borrowing model reachability and am-
biguity are listed in table 3. The model obtains high
reachability, while significantly reducing the aver-
age number of possible outputs per input: in Arabic
from 787K to 857 words, in French from 62K to
12. This result shows that the loanword transducer
design, based on the prior linguistic analysis, is a
plausible model of word borrowing. Yet, there are on
average 33 correct Arabic words out of the possible
857 outputs, thus the second part of the model—OT
constraint weights optimization—is crucial.

The accuracy results in table 4 show how challeng-
ing the task of modeling lexical borrowing between
two distinct languages is, and importantly, that ortho-
graphic and phonetic baselines including the state-
of-the-art generative model of transliteration are not
suitable for this task. Phonetic baselines for Arabic–

Swahili perform better than orthographic ones, but
substantially worse than OT-based models, even if
OT constraints are not weighted. Crucially, the per-
formance of the borrowing model with the learned
OT weights corroborates the assumption made in nu-
merous linguistic accounts that OT is an adequate
analysis of the lexical borrowing phenomenon.

Qualitative evaluation The constraint ranking
learned by the borrowing model (constraints are
listed in tables 1, 2) is in line with prior linguistic
analysis. Space precludes a thorough discussion, but
we highlight a few points. In Swahili NO-CODA domi-
nates all other markedness constraints, as expected.
Both *COMPLEX-S and *COMPLEX-C, restricting con-
sonant clusters, dominate *COMPLEX-V, confirming
that Swahili is more permissive to vowel clusters.
SSP—sonority-based constraint—captures a common
pattern of consonant clustering, found across lan-
guages, and is also learned by our model as undomi-
nated by most competitors in Swahili, and as a domi-
nating markedness constraint in Romanian. Finally,
vowel epenthesis DEP-IO-V is the most common strat-
egy in Arabic loanword adaptation, and is ranked
lower according to the model; however, it is ranked

highly in the French–Romanian model, where vowel
insertion is rare.

A second interesting by-product of our model is
an inferred syllabification. While we did not conduct
a systematic quantitative evaluation, higher-ranked
Swahili outputs tend to contain linguistically plausi-
ble syllabifications, although the syllabification trans-
ducer inserts optional syllable boundaries between
every pair of phones. This result further attests to
the plausible constraint ranking learned by the model.
Example Swahili syllabifications14 along with the
OT constraint violations produced by the borrowing
model are depicted in table 5.

7 Discussion

The task of modeling borrowing is unexplored in
computational linguistics. In this section we first
situate the task with respect to two most closely re-
lated research directions: modeling transliteration
and cognate forms. We then motivate the new line of
research proposed in this work: modeling borrowing.

Borrowing vs. transliteration Borrowing is not
transliteration. Transliteration refers to writing in
a different orthography, whereas borrowing refers
to expanding a language to include words adapted
from another language. Unlike borrowing, translit-
eration is more amenable to orthographic—rather
than morpho-phonological—features, although see
(Knight and Graehl, 1998). Borrowed words might
have begun as transliterations, but a characteristic
of borrowed words is that they become assimilated
in the linguistic system of the recipient language,
and became regular content words, e.g., ‘orange’
and ‘sugar’ are English words borrowed from Arabic
l .�

	'PA 	K (nArnj) and QºË@ (Alskr), respectively.

14We chose examples from the Arabic–Swahili system be-
cause this is a more challenging case due to linguistic discrepan-
cies.

Borrowing vs. inheritance Cognates are words in
related languages inherited from one word in a com-
mon ancestral language (the proto-language). Loan-
words, on the other hand, can occur between any lan-
guages, either related or not, that historically came
into contact. Theoretical analysis of cognates has
tended to be concerned with a diachronic point of
view, i.e., modeling word changes across time. While
of immense scientific interest, language processing
applications are arguably better served by models of
synchronic processes, peculiar to loanword analysis.

Why borrowing? Borrowing is a distinctive and
pervasive phenomenon: all languages borrowed from
other languages at some point in their lifetime, and
borrowed words constitute a large fraction of most
language lexicons. Another important property of
borrowing is that in adaptation of borrowed items,
changes in words are systematic, knowledge of mor-
phological and phonological patterns in a language
can be used to predict how borrowings will be re-
alized in that language, without having to list them
all. Therefore, modeling of borrowing is a task well-
suited for computational approaches.

Our suggestion in this work is that we can identify
borrowing relations between resource-limited lan-
guages and resource-rich donor languages, such as
English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Rus-
sian. For example, 30–70% of the vocabulary in Viet-
namese, Cantonese, and Thai—relatively resource-
limited languages spoken by hundreds of millions
of people—are borrowed from Chinese and English.
Similarly, African languages have been greatly in-
fluenced by Arabic, Spanish, English, and French—
widely spoken languages such as Swahili, Zulu,
Malagasy, Hausa, Tarifit, Yoruba contain up to 40%
of loanwords. Indo-Iranian languages—Hindustani,
Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Persian, Pashto—spoken by
860 million, also extensively borrowed from Ara-
bic and English (Haspelmath and Tadmor, 2009). In

605



short, at least a billion people are speaking resource-
scarce languages whose lexicons are heavily bor-
rowed from resource-rich languages.

Why is this important? Lexical translations or
alignments extracted from large parallel corpora have
been widely used to project annotations from high- to
low-resource languages (Hwa et al., 2005; Täckström
et al., 2013; Ganchev et al., 2009; Tsvetkov et al.,
2014, inter alia). Unfortunately, parallel resources
are unavailable for the majority of resource-limited
languages. Loanwords can be used as a source of
cross-lingual links complementary to lexical align-
ments. This holds promise for applying existing
cross-lingual methods and bootstrapping linguistic
resources in languages where no parallel data is avail-
able.

8 Related work

With the exception of a study conducted by Blair and
Ingram (2003) on generation of borrowed phonemes
in English–Japanese language pair (the method does
not generalize from borrowed phonemes to borrowed
words, and does not rely on linguistic insights), we
are not aware of any prior work on computational
modeling of lexical borrowing. Few papers only men-
tion or tangentially address borrowing, we briefly list
them here. Daumé III (2009) focuses on areal effects
on linguistic typology, a broader phenomenon that
includes borrowing and genetic relations across lan-
guages. This study is aimed at discovering language
areas based on typological features of languages. Gar-
ley and Hockenmaier (2012) train a maxent classifier
with character n-gram and morphological features
to identify anglicisms (which they compare to loan-
words) in an online community of German hip hop
fans. List and Moran (2013) have published a toolkit
for computational tasks in historical linguistics but
remark that “Automatic approaches for borrowing
detection are still in their infancy in historical linguis-
tics.”

Two related lines of research are transliteration and
cognate identification. Knight and Graehl (1998), Al-
Onaizan and Knight (2002) developed a finite-state
generative model of transliteration, and successfully
applied it to Arabic–English named entity transla-
tion. Mann and Yarowsky (2001) and Kondrak (2001)
identify cognate pairs, based on the learned surface

and phonetic similarities, respectively. As our experi-
ments confirm, orthographic and phonetic translitera-
tion and string edit distance methods are not adequate
models for the complex borrowing phenomena.

9 Conclusion

Given a loanword, our model identifies plausible
donor words in a contact language. We show that
a discriminative model with Optimality Theoretic
features effectively models systematic phonological
changes in Arabic–Swahili loanwords. We also found
that the model and methodology is generally applica-
ble to other language pairs with minimal engineering
effort.

This paper makes two contributions: (1) To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first computational
model of lexical borrowing. (2) While there are im-
plementations of OT (Hayes et al., 2013), they are
used chiefly to facilitate linguistic analysis.

There are numerous research questions that we
would like to explore further. Is it possible to mono-
lingually identify borrowed words in a language?
Can we automatically identify a donor language (or
its phonological properties) for a borrowed word?
Since languages may borrow from many sources,
can jointly modeling this process lead to better per-
formance? Can we reduce the amount of language-
specific engineering required to deploy our model?
Can we integrate knowledge of borrowing in down-
stream NLP applications? We intend to address these
questions in future work.
