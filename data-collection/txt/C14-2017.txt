Abstract

Chemical cancer risk assessment is a literature-dependent task which could greatly benefit from
text mining support. In this paper we describe CRAB – the first publicly available tool for
supporting the risk assessment workflow. CRAB, currently at version 2.0, facilitates the gathering
of relevant literature via PubMed queries as well as semantic classification, statistical analysis and
efficient study of the literature. The tool is freely available as an in-browser application.

1 Introduction

Biomedical text mining addresses the great need to access information in the growing body of literature
in biomedical sciences. Prior research has produced useful tools for supporting practical tasks such as
literature curation and development of semantic databases, among others (Chapman and Cohen, 2009;
Harmston et al., 2010; Simpson and Demner-Fushman, 2012; McDonald and Kelly, 2012). In this paper
we describe a tool we have built to aid literature exploration for the task of chemical risk assessment
(CRA). The need for assessment of chemical hazards, exposures and their corresponding health risks is
growing, as many countries have tightened up their chemical safety rules. CRA work requires thorough
review of available scientific data for each chemical under inspection, much of which can be found in
scientific literature (EPA, 2005). Since the scientific data is highly varied and well-studied chemicals
may have tens of thousands of publications (e.g. to date PubMed contains 23,665 articles mentioning
phenobarbital), the task can be extremely time consuming when conducted via conventional means
(Korhonen et al., 2009). As a result, there is interest among the CRA community in text mining tools that
can aid and streamline the literature review process.

We have developed CRAB, an online system that supports the entire process of literature review for
cancer risk assessors. It is the first and only NLP system that serves this need. CRAB contains three main
components:

1. Literature search with PubMed integration

2. Semantic classification of abstracts with summary visualisation

3. Literature browsing with markup of information structure

These components are described further in Section 2 below. Version 2.0 of CRAB is freely available as an
in-browser application; see Section 4 for access information.

2 System description

2.1 Literature search
The first step for the user is to retrieve a collection of scientific articles relevant to their need, e.g., all
articles with abstracts that contain the name of a given chemical. The CRAB 2.0 search page (Figure
1) allows the user to directly query the MEDLINE database of biomedical abstracts. The search query

is sent, and the results received, using the E-Utilities web service provided by the National Center
for Biotechnology Information.1 This query interface supports PubMed Advanced Search, facilitating
complex Boolean queries.

2.2 Semantic classification

The document collection returned by the PubMed web service is passed in XML format to a semantic
classifier that annotates each abstract with 42 binary labels indicating the presence/absence of concepts
relevant to CRA. These concepts are organised hierarchically in two main taxonomies: (1) kinds of
scientific evidence used for CRA (e.g., human studies, animal studies, cell experiments, biochemical/cell
biological effects); (2) the carcinogenic modes of action indicated by the evidence (e.g., genotoxic,
nongenotoxic/indirect genotoxic, cell death, inflammation, angiogenesis). The underlying classifier is a
support vector machine (SVM) trained on a dataset of 3,078 manually annotated abstracts. Features used
by the SVM include lexical n-grams, character n-grams and MeSH concepts. For more details on the
concept taxonomies, training corpus and classifier see Korhonen et al. (2012).

Figure 3: The CRAB 2.0 information structure component

Once each abstract in the retrieved collection has been classified, the user is presented with a summary
of counts for each concept (Figure 2a). In a user study, risk assessors found this summary very useful for
obtaining a broad overview of the literature, identifying groups of chemicals with similar toxicological
profiles and identifying data gaps (Korhonen et al., 2012). The user can also request a histogram
visualisation (Figure 2b), which is produced through a call to the statistical software R.2

2.3 Literature browsing
The risk assessment workflow involves close reading of relevant abstracts to identify specific information
about methods, experimental details, results and conclusions. While it is not feasible to automate this
process, we have shown that automatic markup and visualisation of abstracts’ information structure
can accelerate it considerably (Guo et al., 2011). The model of information structure incorporated in
CRAB 2.0 is based on argumentative zoning (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Mizuta et al., 2006; Teufel, 2010),
whereby the text of a scientific abstract (or article) is segmented into blocks of sentences that carry a
specific rhetorical function and combine to communicate the argument the authors wish to convey to
the reader. The markup scheme used in our system labels each sentence with one of seven categories:
background, objective, method, result, conclusion, related work and future work (Guo et al., 2010). The
CRAB system incorporates preprocessing (lemmatisation, POS tagging, parsing) with the C&C toolkit3

and information structure markup with an SVM classifier that labels sentences according to a combination
of lexical, syntactic and discourse features (Guo et al., 2011). The classifier has been trained on an
annotated dataset of 1,000 CRA abstracts (Guo et al., 2010).

The automatic information structure markup is used to support browsing of the set of abstracts assigned
a label of interest by the semantic classifier; e.g., the user can inspect all abstracts labelled genotoxic
(Figure 3). Each information structure category is highlighted in a different colour and the user can select
a single category to focus on. To our knowledge, CRAB 2.0 is the first publicly available online tool that
provides information structure analysis of biomedical literature.

3 Evaluation

Intrinsic cross-validation evaluations of the semantic taxonomy classifier and information structure
classifier show high performance: 0.78 macro-averaged F-score (Korhonen et al., 2012) and 0.88 accuracy
(Guo et al., 2011), respectively. Furthermore, user-based evaluation in the context of real-life CRA has

produced promising results. (Korhonen et al., 2012) showed that the concept distributions produced by
our classifier confirmed known properties of chemicals without human input. Guo et al. (2011) found that
integrating information structure visualisation in abstract browsing helped risk assessors to find relevant
information in abstracts 7-8% more quickly.

4 Use

CRAB 2.0 is freely available as an in-browser application at http://omotesando-e.cl.cam.
ac.uk/CRAB/request.html. New users can register an id and password to allow them to store
and retrieve data from previous sessions. Alternatively, they can use an anonymous guest account (id
guest@coling, password guest@coling).

5 Conclusion

We have presented Version 2.0 of CRAB, the first NLP tool for supporting the workflow of literature
review for cancer risk assessment. CRAB meets a real, specialised need and is already being used to
improve the efficiency of CRA work. Although currently focused on cancer, CRAB can be easily adapted
to other health risks provided with the appropriate taxonomy and annotated data for machine learning. In
the future, the tool can be developed further in various ways, e.g. to support submissions in other formats
than PubMed XML; to take into account journal impact factors, number of citations and cross references
to better organize the literature; and to offer enriched statistical analysis of classified literature.
