Abstract

In this paper, we describe our submissions
to the WMT17 Multimodal Translation
Task. For Task 1 (multimodal translation),
our best scoring system is a purely textual
neural translation of the source image cap-
tion to the target language. The main fea-
ture of the system is the use of additional
data that was acquired by selecting simi-
lar sentences from parallel corpora and by
data synthesis with back-translation. For
Task 2 (cross-lingual image captioning),
our best submitted system generates an
English caption which is then translated by
the best system used in Task 1. We also
present negative results, which are based
on ideas that we believe have potential of
making improvements, but did not prove
to be useful in our particular setup.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in deep learning allowed infer-
ring distributed vector representations of both tex-
tual and visual data. In models combining text and
vision modalities, this representation can be used
as a shared data type. Unlike the classical nat-
ural language processing tasks where everything
happens within one language or across languages,
multimodality tackles how the language entities
relate to the extra-lingual reality. One of these
tasks is multimodal translation whose goal is us-
ing cross-lingual information in automatic image
captioning.

In this system-description paper, we describe
our submission to the WMT17 Multimodal Trans-
lation Task. In particular, we discuss the effect of
mining additional training data and usability of ad-
vanced attention strategies. We report our results

on both the 2016 and 2017 test sets and discuss
efficiency of tested approaches.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the tasks we handle in this pa-
per and the datasets that were provided to the task.
Section 3 summarizes the state-of-the-art methods
applied to the task. In Section 4, we describe our
models and the results we have achieved. Sec-
tion 5 presents the negative results and Section 6
concludes the paper.

2 Task and Dataset Description

The challenge of the WMT Multimodal Transla-
tion Task is to exploit cross-lingual information
in automatic image caption generation. The state-
of-the-art models in both machine translation and
automatic image caption generation use similar
architectures for generating the target sentence.
The simplicity with which we can combine the
learned representations of various inputs in a sin-
gle deep learning model inevitably leads to a ques-
tion whether combining the modalities can lead to
some interesting results. In the shared task, this
is explored in two subtasks with different roles of
visual and textual modalities.

In the multimodal translation task (Task 1),
the input of the model is an image and its cap-
tion in English. The system then should out-
put a German or French translation of the cap-
tion. The system output is evaluated using
the METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) and
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores computed
against a single reference sentence. The question
this task tries to answer is whether and how is it
possible to use visual information to disambiguate
the translation.

In the cross-lingual captioning task (Task 2), the
input to the model at test-time is the image alone.
However, additionally to the image, the model is

supplied with the English (source) caption dur-
ing training. The evaluation method differs from
Task 1 in using five reference captions instead of
a single one. In Task 2, German is the only tar-
get language. The motivation of Task 2 is to ex-
plore ways of easily creating an image captioning
system in a new language once we have an ex-
isting system for another language, assuming that
the information transfer is less complex across lan-
guages than between visual and textual modalities.

2.1 Data

The participants were provided with the Multi30k
dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) – a multilingual exten-
sion of Flickr30k dataset (Plummer et al., 2017) –
for both training and evaluation of their models.

The data consists of 31,014 images. In
Flickr30k, each image is described with five inde-
pendently acquired captions in English. Images in
the Multi30k dataset are enriched with five crowd-
sourced German captions. Additionally, a single
German translation of one of the English captions
was added for each image.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and
test sets of 29,000, 1,014, and 1,000 instances re-
spectively. The statistics on the training and vali-
dation part are tabulated in Table 1.

For the 2017 round of the competition (Elliott
et al., 2017), an additional French translation was
included for Task 1 and new test sets have been de-
veloped. Two test sets were provided for Task 1:
The first one consists of 1,000 instances and is
similar to the test set used in the previous round
of the competition (and to the training and val-
idation data). The second one consists of im-

ages, captions, and their translations taken from
the MSCOCO image captioning dataset (Lin et al.,
2014). A new single test set containing 1,071 im-
ages with five reference captions was added for
Task 2.

The style and structure of the reference sen-
tences in the Flickr- and MSCOCO-based test sets
differs. Most of the sentences in the Multi30k
dataset have a similar structure with a relatively
simple subject, an active verb in present tense,
simple object, and location information (e.g.,
“Two dogs are running on a beach.”). Contrast-
ingly, the captions in the MSCOCO dataset are
less formal and capture the annotator’s uncertainty
about the image content (e.g., “I don’t know, it
looks like a lemon.”).

3 Related Work

Several promising neural architectures for multi-
modal translation task have been introduced since
the first competition in 2016.

In our last year’s submission (Libovický et al.,
2016), we employed a neural system that com-
bined multiple inputs – the image, the source cap-
tion and an SMT-generated caption. We used the
attention mechanism over the textual sequences
and concatenated the context vectors in each de-
coder step.

The overall results of the WMT16 multimodal
translation task did not prove the visual features
to be particularly useful (Specia et al., 2016;
Caglayan et al., 2016).

To our knowledge, Huang et al. (2016) were
the first who showed an improvement over a
textual-only neural system with model utilizing
distributed features explicit object recognition.
Calixto et al. (2017) improved state of the art using
a model initializing the decoder state with the im-
age vector, while maintaining the rest of the neural
architecture unchanged. Promising results were
also shown by Delbrouck and Dupont (2017) who
made a small improvement using bilinear pooling.

Elliott and Kádár (2017) brought further im-
provements by introducing the “imagination”
component to the neural network architecture.
Given the source sentence, the network is trained
to output the target sentence jointly with predict-
ing the image vector. The model uses the visual in-
formation only as a regularization and thus is able
to use additional parallel data without accompany-
ing images.

4 Experiments

All models are based on the encoder-decoder ar-
chitecture with attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2014) as implemented in Neural Mon-
key (Helcl and Libovický, 2017).1 The decoder
uses conditional GRUs (Firat and Cho, 2016) with
500 hidden units and word embeddings with di-
mension of 300. The target sentences are decoded
using beam search with beam size 10, and with
exponentially weighted length penalty (Wu et al.,
2016) with α parameter empirically estimated as
1.5 for German and 1.0 for French. Because of
the low OOV rate (see Table 1), we used vocabu-
laries of maximum 30,000 tokens and we did not
use sub-word units. The textual encoder is a bidi-
rectional GRU network with 500 units in each di-
rection and word embeddings with dimension of
300. We use the last convolutional layer VGG-16
network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) of di-
mensionality 14× 14× 512 for image processing.
The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rate 10−4

with early stopping based on validation BLEU
score.

4.1 Task 1: Multimodal Translation
We tested the following architectures with differ-
ent datasets (see Section 4.3 for details):

• purely textual (disregarding the visual modal-
ity);

1https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey

• multimodal with context vector concatena-
tion in the decoder (Libovický et al., 2016);

• multimodal with hierarchical attention com-
bination (Libovický and Helcl, 2017) – con-
text vectors are computed independently for
each modality and then they are combined to-
gether using another attention mechanism as
depicted in Figure 1.

4.2 Task 2: Cross-lingual Captioning
We conducted two sets of experiments for this sub-
task. In both of them, we used an attentive image
captioning model (Xu et al., 2015) for the cross-
lingual captioning with the same decoder as for
the first subtask.

The first idea we experimented with was using a
multilingual decoder provided with the image and
a language identifier. Based on the identifier, the
decoder generates the caption either in English or
in German. We speculated that the information
transfer from the visual to the language modality
is the most difficult part of the task and might be
similar for both English and German.

The second approach we tried has two steps.
First, we trained an English image captioning sys-
tem, for which we can use larger datasets. Second,
we translated the generated captions with the mul-
timodal translation system from the first subtask.

4.3 Acquiring Additional Data
In order to improve the textual translation, we ac-
quired additional data. We used the following

452



technique to select in-domain sentences from both
parallel and monolingual data.

We trained a neural character-level language
model on the German sentences available in the
training part of the Multi30k dataset. We used a
GRU network with 512 hidden units and character
embedding size of 128.

Using the language model, we selected
30,000 best-scoring German sentences from the
SDEWAC corpus (Faaß and Eckart, 2013) which
were both semantically and structurally similar to
the sentences in the Multi30k dataset.

We tried to use the language model to se-
lect sentence pairs also from parallel data. By
scoring the German part of several parallel cor-
pora (EU Bookshop (Skadiņš et al., 2014), News
Commentary (Tiedemann, 2012) and Common-
Crawl (Smith et al., 2013)), we were only able to
retrieve a few hundreds of in-domain sentences.
For that reason we also included sentences with
lower scores which we filtered using the follow-
ing rules: sentences must have between 2 and 30
tokens, must be in the present tense, must not con-
tain non-standard punctuation, numbers of multi-
ple digits, acronyms, or named entities, and must
have at most 15 % OOV rate w.r.t. Multi30k train-
ing vocabulary. We extracted additional 3,000 in-
domain parallel sentences using these rules. Ex-
amples of the additional data are given in Table 2.

By applying the same approach on the French
versions of the corpora, we were pable to extract
only few additional in-domain sentences. We thus
trained the English-to-French models in the con-
strained setup only.

Following Calixto et al. (2017), we back-
translated (Sennrich et al., 2016) the German
captions from the German side of the Multi30k
dataset (i.e. 5+1 captions for each image), and sen-
tences retrieved from the SDEWAC corpus. We
included these back-translated sentence pairs as
additional training data for the textual and multi-
modal systems for Task 1. The back-translation
system used the same architecture as the textual
systems and was trained on the Multi30k dataset
only. The additional parallel data and data from
the SDEWAC corpus (denoted as additional in Ta-
ble 3) were used only for the text-only systems be-
cause they were not accompanied by images.

For Task 2, we also used the MSCOCO (Lin
et al., 2014) dataset which consists of 300,000 im-
ages with 5 English captions for each of them.

4.4 Results

In Task 1, our best performing system was the text-
only system trained with additional data. These
were acquired both by the data selection method
described above and by back-translation. Results
of all setups for Task 1 are given in Table 3.

Surprisingly, including the data for Task 2 to the
training set decreased the METEOR score on both
of the 2017 test sets. This might have been caused
by domain mismatch. However, in case of the ad-
ditional parallel and SDEWAC data, this problem
was likely outweighed by the advantage of having
more training data.

In case of multimodal systems, adding approxi-
mately the same amount of data increased the per-
formance more than in case of the text-only sys-
tem. This suggests, that with sufficient amount of
data (which is a rather unrealistic assumption), the
multimodal system would eventually outperform
the textual one.

The hierarchical attention combination brought
major improvements over the concatenation ap-
proach on the 2017 test sets. On the 2016 test set,
the concatenation approach yielded better results,
which can be considered a somewhat strange re-
sult, given the similarity of the Flickr test sets.

The baseline system was Nematus (Sennrich
et al., 2017) trained on the textual part of Multi30k
only. However, due to its low score, we suspect
the model was trained with suboptimal parameters
because it is in principle a model identical to our
constrained textual submission.

In Task 2, none of the submitted systems outper-
formed the baseline which was a captioning sys-
tem (Xu et al., 2015) trained directly on the Ger-
man captions in the Multi30k dataset. The results
of our systems on Task 2 are shown in Table 4.

For the English captioning, we trained two
models. First one was trained on the Flickr30k
data only. In the second one, we included also the
MSCOCO dataset. Although the captioning sys-
tem trained on more data achieved better perfor-
mance on the English side (Table 5), it led to ex-
tremely low performance while plugged into our
multimodal translation systems (Table 4, rows la-
beled “en captioning + translation”). We hypothe-

size this is caused by the different styles of the sen-
tences in the training datasets.

Our hypothesis about sharing information be-
tween the languages in a single decoder was not
confirmed in this setup and the experiments led to
relatively poor results.

Interestingly, our systems for Task 2 scored
poorly in the BLEU score and relatively well in
the METEOR score. We can attribute this to the
fact that unlike BLEU which puts more emphasis
on precision, METEOR considers strongly also re-
call.

5 Negative Results

In addition to our submitted systems, we tried a
number of techniques without success. We de-
scribe these techniques since we believe it might
be relevant for future developments in the field,
despite the current negative result.

5.1 Beam Rescoring
Similarly to Lala et al. (2017), our oracle experi-
ments on the validation data showed that rescoring
of the decoded beam of width 100 has the poten-
tial of improvement of up to 3 METEOR points.
In the oracle experiment, we always chose a sen-
tence with the highest sentence-level BLEU score.
Motivated by this observation, we conducted sev-
eral experiments with beam rescoring.

We trained a classifier predicting whether a
given sentence is a suitable caption for a given
image. The classifier had one hidden layer with
300 units and had two inputs: the last layer of
the VGG-16 network processing the image, and

454



the last state of a bidirectional GRU network
processing the text. We used the same hyper-
parameters for the bidirectional GRU network as
we did for the textual encoders in other experi-
ments. Training data were taken from both parts
of the Multi30k dataset with negative examples
randomly sampled from the dataset, so the classes
were represented equally. The classifier achieved
validation accuracy of 87% for German and 74%
for French. During the rescoring of the 100 hy-
potheses in the beam, we selected the one which
had the highest predicted probability of being the
image’s caption.

In other experiments, we tried to train a regres-
sion predicting the score of a given output sen-
tence. Unlike the previous experiment, we built
the training data from scored hypotheses from
output beams obtained by translating the training
part of the Multi30k dataset. We tested two ar-
chitectures: the first one concatenates the termi-
nal states of bidirectional GRU networks encod-
ing the source and hypothesis sentences and an
image vector; the second performs an attentive
average pooling over hidden states of the RNNs
and the image CNN using the other encoders ter-
minal states as queries and concatenates the con-
text vectors. The regression was estimating either
the sentence-level BLEU score (Chen and Cherry,
2014) or the chrF3 score (Popović, 2015).

Contrary to our expectations, all the rescoring
techniques decreased the performance by 2 ME-
TEOR points.

5.2 Reinforcement Learning

Another technique we tried without any suc-
cess was self-critical sequence training (Rennie
et al., 2016). This modification of the REIN-
FORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) for sequence-
to-sequence learning uses the reward of the
training-time decoded sentence as the baseline.
The systems were pre-trained with the word-level
cross-entropy objective and we hoped to fine-
tune the systems using the REINFORCE towards
sentence-level BLEU score and GLEU score (Wu
et al., 2016).

It appeared to be difficult to find the right mo-
ment when the optimization criterion should be
switched and to find an optimal mixing factor of
the cross-entropy loss and REINFORCE loss. We
hypothesize that a more complex objective mix-
ing strategy (like MIXER (Ranzato et al., 2015))

could lead to better results than simple objective
weighting.

6 Conclusions

In our submission to the 2017 Multimodal Task,
we tested the advanced attention combination
strategies (Libovický and Helcl, 2017) in a more
challenging context and achieved competitive re-
sults compared to other submissions. We explored
ways of acquiring additional data for the task and
tested two promising techniques that did not bring
any improvement to the system performance.
