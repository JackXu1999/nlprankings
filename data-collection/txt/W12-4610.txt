Abstract

In this paper, we show how the interactions
between the tense, aspect and mood pre-
verbal markers in São Tomense can be for-
mally and concisely described at an abstract
level, using the concept of projection. More
precisely, we show how to encode the dif-
ferent valid orders of preverbal markers in
an abstract description of a Tree-Adjoining
Grammar of São Tomense. This description
is written using the XMG meta-grammar
language (Crabbé and Duchier, 2004).

1 Introduction

São Tomense1 is a Portuguese-based Creole lan-
guage spoken on São Tomé Island (RDSTP). Like
many (if not all) Creole Languages, it has prever-
bal markers expressing Tense and Aspect (TMA
markers in the classical literature on Creole lan-
guages, see (Holm, 1989)), as shown in (1):

(1) a. tataluga
turtle

xiga.
come

’The turtle came.’
b. tataluga

turtle
ka
IMPF

xiga.
come

’The turtle is coming.’
c. tataluga

turtle
tava
Anterior

ka
IMPF

xiga
come

’The turtle was coming.’

Several approaches have been proposed to for-
mally describe the combinations of TMA markers
in São Tomense, including tree-based descriptions
such as Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Schang,

1The abbreviations are: ST (São Tomense) ; IMPF (im-
perfective) ; Asp (Aspect).

2000). Schang’s TAG uses adjunction (i.e., aux-
iliary trees) to encode the ordering of the TMA
markers. As we shall see in Section 5, this is not
satisfactory for several reasons. In this paper, we
propose to shift the description of TMA markers
to a meta-level, using the XMG language (Crabbé
and Duchier, 2004). The paper is structured as
follows. In section 2, we describe São Tomense
TMA system. In Section 3, we introduce the
XMG language. Section 4 focuses on the syntac-
tic properties of the TMA markers. In Section 5,
we then show how to control the TMA markers’
combinations in an XMG meta-grammar. This
meta-grammar is then compiled in order to pro-
duce a TAG where verbal elementary trees only
contain correctly ordered TMA markers (realised
as lexical nodes).

2 TMA system

Before describing the TMA markers and their
combination, let us first look at the bare verbs.

2.1 Bare Verbs

As in many languages (and as in most of the Cre-
oles), bare verbs are used to express the past per-
fective (or preterite) with dynamic processes (as
in (1-a)) and express the present tense with stative
verbs, as in (2).

(2) n
1sg

konse
know

mana
sister

bo.
your

’I know your sister.’ (*’I knew your sis-
ter’)

Stative verbs are often considered to collide with
the TMA markers (Ferraz, 1979), but several uses
of both have been noticed in ST spoken corpora

82



(Schang, 2000), triggering an inchoative mean-
ing (3).

(3) e
3sg

ka
IMPF

sa
be

yo
very

godu.
fat

’He is going to be very fat.”

(Schang, 2000, p. 193) shows that bare verbs in
São Tomense are literally ”bare” and that no in-
formation on Tense or Aspect is attached to them,
and that no functional projection (containing a
zero morphem) is needed to account for the var-
ious uses of bare verbs. By contrast, the prever-
bal markers bear such temporal and aspectual fea-
tures.

2.2 Aspect

ka is the most-used aspectual marker in São
Tomense2. (Hagemeijer, 2007) and (Ferraz, 1979)
provide several examples of its uses in various
contexts, triggering habitual reading (4-a) , future
tense (4-b) and conditionality (4-c):

(4) a. Zon
John

ka
Asp

kanta
sing

ni
in

gleza.
church

’John uses to sing at church.’
b. Zoze

José
ka
Asp

xiga
come

amanha.
tomorrow

’José will come tomorrow.’
c. xi

if
bo
2sg

ka
Asp

bi
come

amanha,
tomorrow

bo
2sg

ka
Asp

be
see

mu.
me

’If you come tomorrow, you’ll see
me.’

(Schang, 2000, p. 193) shows that all the various
interpretations of ka boil down to an imperfective
reading, which is the core meaning of this marker.

2.3 Tense

Two Tense markers occupy the same position:
tava (anterior) and sa (present). Both markers
derive from the Portuguese verb estar ’to be’, in
its 3sg imperfect indicative tense form and 3sg
present tense form respectively. They inherit from
the temporal value of the etymon.

While tava can freely combine with the verb,
sa goes together with ka, often pronounced xka,3

see (5).

2Leaving aside its allomorph ga.
3It can also be pronouced ’e ska bi’.

(5) a. e
3sg

tava
Tense

bi.
come

’He had come.’
b. e

sa
Tense

ka
Asp

bi.
come

’He is coming.’
c. e

3sg
tava
Tense

ka
Asp

bi.
come

’He was coming.’
d. *e sa bi.

(5-b) illustrates the sa ka or xka (its short form)
combination which triggers the progressive read-
ing. Any other combination is blocked,4 see (6).

(6) a. *e ka tava bi.
b. *e sa tava bi.
c. *e ka sa bi.

To summarize, São Tomense combines a few pre-
verbal markers in order to derive a rich range of
semantic interpretations.

3 eXtensible Meta-Grammar

As mentioned above, in this paper, we show how
to move the description of TMA markers in a
São Tomense TAG from the syntactic level (i.e.,
the TAG elementary trees) to a meta-level, us-
ing the eXtensible Meta-Grammar (XMG) frame-
work. This move makes it possible for the linguist
to concisely describe the valid TMA orders.5

XMG is a declarative language for specifying
tree-based grammars at a meta-level (Crabbé and
Duchier, 2004). Basically, XMG allows to ab-
stract over tree structures (i.e., to capture general-
izations) by defining (i) elementary tree fragments
and (ii) conjunctive / disjunctive combinations of
these fragments. Such an abstraction over a (tree)
grammar is generally called a meta-grammar. It
is compiled in order to automatically produce the
underlying grammar.6

4(Hagemeijer, 2007) reports some other combinations (sa
xka, ka ka, tava sa xka) which are firmly rejected by our in-
formants and absent from the fieldwork recordings we have.
It suggests that some variation exists. But as we focus on
standard ST we don’t take it into account. Note however that
these combinations can be seen as relaxed constraints on the
system, and do not invalidate our analyses.

5This move presupposes that TMA markers should rather
be treated as co-anchors of verbal elementary trees than an-
chors of auxiliary trees. This is motivated in Section 4.

6The compiler for the XMG language is also called
XMG, and is freely available at https://launchpad.
net/xmg.

83



The elementary tree fragments of the XMG lan-
guage correspond to tree descriptions and are en-
capsulated within classes. Such a class provides
the linguist with a mean to refer to a given tree de-
scription, e.g., in order to reuse it in distinct con-
textes. These tree descriptions can contain (node
or feature) variables, dominance and precedence
constraints on nodes, and labelling constraints
(association of a node with some feature struc-
ture). Note that the combinations of these tree
descriptions are also encapsulated within classes,
and that the default scope of a variable is the class.
XMG is also equipped with an inheritance mecha-
nism, which allows to import the content of a class
and access directly its variables.

The compilation of an XMG specification
amounts to (i) accumulating tree descriptions and
then (ii) solving accumulated tree descriptions.
As a result, a fully redundant grammar is gener-
ated (i.e., TAG trees grouped into tree families).

The XMG language reveals expressive enough
to describe a large amount of syntactic struc-
tures in a compact way, as shown by the var-
ious tree grammars designed with XMG for
French (Crabbé, 2005; Perrier, 2007; Gardent,
2008), English (Alahverdzhieva, 2008) and Ger-
man (Kallmeyer et al., 2008).

A particularly interesting feature of the XMG
language is that it comes with a set of built-in lin-
guistic principles that the linguist can activate in
order to ensure the validity of the output structures
(Crabbé et al., To appear). These principles not
only guaranty the well-formedness of the gram-
mar with respect to linguistic invariants, but also
help the linguist to highly factorise her/his meta-
grammar. Indeed, principles allow the linguist to
avoid defining numerous alternative descriptions
for exceptions, but to rather catch them during the
compilation of the meta-grammar.

In the meta-grammar for ST described in Sec-
tion 5, we use the unifications over feature struc-
tures labelling nodes, which are triggered during
tree description solving, to rule out invalid TMA
orders. In a future work, we plan to rather de-
scribe valid TMA orders via a dedicated linguistic
principle.

4 Projecting Aspect and Tense

Prior to describing our meta-grammar of ST, let us
describe interesting properties of TMA markers,
which will motivate our formal description of ST.

(Schang, 2000) and (Hagemeijer, 2007) pro-
pose a description of the properties of the TMA
markers that we complete below. Contrary to the
full verb sa and tava (’be’), which can be used as
copula, as in (7), sa and tava as TMA do not have
the properties of the verbs they originate from, a
fact we will show below.

(7) a. kafe
coffee

sa
be

kentxi.
hot

’The coffee is hot.’
b. kafe

coffee
tava
be.Anterior

kentxi.
hot

’The coffee was hot.’

The question we address here is the nature of ka,
sa and tava. We present a series of tests which
shows that TMA markers behave differently from
verbs (auxiliaries included), adverbs and adjec-
tives (note that hereafter we use the reduced form
xka instead of the full form sa ka).

• Coordination
Contrary to lexical items, TMA markers
cannot be coordinated (neither overtly nor
covertly):

(8) *Zon
John

sa
Tense

i/o
and/or

tava
Tense

ka
Asp

kume.
eat

’John is and/or was eating.’

Note that the TMA markers don’t show the
properties of French and English auxiliaries
with regard to coordination.

• Reiteration
TMA markers cannot be reiterated on the
same verb (9), contrary to adverbs for in-
stance (see (Schang, 2012) for a study of lex-
ical reiteration in ST).

(9) *Zon
John

sa

• Negation
Sentential negation in ST is double-headed.
The first particle comes to the immediate
left of the TMA markers and the second one

84



comes in sentence-final position (see (Hage-
meijer, 2007) and (Schang, 2000) for a de-
scription).

(*na)

’John doesn’t eat the rice.’

However, fa is used without na in partial
negation (contrastive negation):

(11) a. ami
me

fa!
Neg2

’Not me!’
b. karu

car
fa!
Neg2

’Not the car!’
c. kume

d. glavi

Neg2

’Not slowly’
f. isa

this
fa!
Neg2

’Not this one!’

(12) *{ka/xka/tava/tava ka} fa!
[Tense and Asp markers negated]

The TMA markers cannot be negated (12)
while pronouns, nouns, verbs, adjective, ad-
verbs and strong demonstratives can, as in
(11-a-f).
While English auxiliaries for instance can be
negated, TMA markers cannot (13):

(13) a. Zon
John

tava
Tense

ka
Asp

kume?
eat

’Was he eating?’
b. *Inon,

no
e
3sg

na
Neg1

tava
Tense

ka
Asp

fa.
Neg2
’No, he wasn’t.’

• Participle-like constructions
Some verbs of Portuguese origin have been
incorporated in ST lexicon with their past
participle form (ex. Port.: chegadu > ST:
xigadu). While they can be complement of
a full verb (fika ’to stay’, or sa ’to be’ (the
full verb used as copula), they cannot ap-
pear with TMA markers, as shown in (14)
(adapted from (Hagemeijer, 2007, p.132)) :

(14) a. *kinte
garden

ka/xka
TMA

balidu.
swept

b. kinte
garden

sa/fika
is/stays

balidu.
swept

’The garden has been/remains
swept’

• Question-answer pairs
TMA markers cannot form a minimal an-
swer:

(15) a. Zon
John

ka/xka
TMA

bali
sweep

kinte?
garden

’Does John sweep/is sweeping
the garden?’

b. efan,
yes

e
he

ka/xka
TMA

*(bali).
sweep

’Yes, he does.’

• VP-fronting:

(16) a. bo
you

ka/xka
TMA

bali
sweep

kinte.
garden

’you (sweep/are sweeping) the
garden.’

b. bali
sweep

kinte
garden

so
FOCUS

bo
you

ka/xka
TMA

*(bali)
sweep

’SWEEP THE GARDEN is what
he does/is doing.’

• Pseudo-cleft

(17) a. kume/dansa/kanta
eat/dance/sing

sa

3sg

ka
Asp

fe.
do

In the fronted position where only the lexical
verb (without its functional projections) is al-
lowed, the TMA are excluded. No ellipsis is
allowed for the inflected verb. To describe
it in classic words, it shows that the material
copied to the focus position originates below
INFL.

We conclude from these tests that the TMA
markers are clearly functional elements, as inflec-
tional affixes in English and French are.

The reason why TMA markers are not repre-
sented as prefixes in the relevant litterature comes
from adverb placement. The adverb kwaji can be
inserted between Tense and Aspect, as in:

(18) Tataluga
turtle

sa
Tense

kwaji
almost

ka
Asp

koda.
wake-up

’The turtle is about to wake up.’

(19) Tataluga (??kwaji) xka (*kwaji) koda.

(19) shows that when kwaji is inserted, sa and
ka cannot freely agglutinate as xka/ska. Note in-
cidentally that the agglutinated form xka is thus
built post-syntactically in phonology.

5 Describing Tense and Aspect in São
Tomense using a Meta-Grammar

(Schang, 2000) proposes an analysis in the TAG
framework which treats the TMA markers as ad-
juncts to V and uses Tense and Aspect features on
the foot node of the adjunct tree to reject invalid
combinations. However, a description based on
the concept of Extended Projections (Grimshaw,
1991) (see also (Frank, 2004) for a similar ap-
proach) better reflects the fact that TMA markers
are not adjuncts such as adjectives or adverbs are.
Consequently, we treat here TMA markers as ex-
tended projections of V, which can remain bare or
be stretched with Tense and Aspect projections.

Thus, Tense and Aspect markers are not stored
in the Lexicon (they don’t anchor any tree) but are
co-anchors of the elementary tree associated with
verbs.

Let us consider (21), which illustrates the struc-
ture of (20).

(20) e
3sg

tava
Tense

ka
Asp

kume.
eat

’He was eating.’

(21) S

N

e

TP

T

tava

AspP

Asp

ka

V

kume

In (21), S is a projection of V, the maximal func-
tional stretching of the verb.

These facts can easily be recast in XMG’s
framework. To this aim, the structure (20) is bro-
ken down into four pieces (i.e. classes) each con-
taining minimal information. These Classes are
listed below.

• CanSubject: to express what is usually
called the External Argument of the verb. It
is described in (22-a) .

• Intransitive verb: the minimal projection
of V. It is described in (22-e) .

• Aspect: as a projection of the aspectual
marker. It is described in (22-b) .

• Tensed: as a projection of Tense. Note that
Tensed refers to a disjunction of two tree
fragments, which differ according to the past
feature labelling the Tense marker. This dis-
tinction allows us to treat the case where a
non-past Tense marker must precede an As-
pect marker. The corresponding two tree
fragments are described in (22-c) and (22-d).

(22) a. S

NP↓ V[proj:T |Asp|V ]

b. V[proj:Asp]

Asp ⋄2 V[proj:V ]

c. V[proj:T ]

T[past=+] ⋄2 V[proj:Asp|V ]

86



d. V[proj:T ]

T[past=−] ⋄2 V[proj:Asp]

e. V[proj:V ]

V ⋄

Thus, (21) is built up from the following conjunc-
tion of Classes:

CanSubject∧Intransitive∧Aspect∧Tensed
The feature proj(ection) is used here to rule out in-
valid combinations in the output elementary tree.7

As mentioned in Section 3, during the compila-
tion of the meta-grammar, the accumulated tree
descriptions are solved in order to produce min-
imal tree models (which correspond to the el-
ementary TAG trees of the grammar being de-
scribed). In the present case of TMA markers,
the tree description solver will compute verbal el-
ementary trees by identifying nodes belonging to
the tree fragments introduced in (22). For such a
node identification to succeed, the nodes need to
be labelled with feature structures, which unify.
While giving a linguistically motivated account
of the properties of TMA markers, the proj fea-
ture will help the meta-grammar compiler to only
produce valid elementary trees (recall that Tense
must dominate/precede Aspect and V).

From the conjunction of classes given above,
the result of the meta-grammar compilation are el-
ementary trees for intransitive verbs, including the
tree associated with kume ’to eat’ depicted in (23).

(23) S

N↓ V[proj:T ]

T ⋄2 V[proj:Asp]

Asp ⋄2 V[proj:V ]

V ⋄

To fill the Tense and Aspect slots, this verb ap-
pears in the Lexicon as associated with two co-
anchor equations (cf, ⋄-nodes refer to anchors and
⋄2-nodes to co-anchors in (23)):8

7In the values associated with feature proj, ”|” refers to
disjunction.

8Here, we adopt a grammar-lexicon interface comparable

• T→ tava [past = +]

• Asp → ka

A felicitous side-effect of incorporating the
TMA markers in the elementary tree of the verb
appears when looking at the derivation tree of the
sentence “e tava ka kume” (24) where functional
information such as Tense and Aspect do not ap-
pear as adjuncts but are hold by the verb (tree α1,
tree α2 being the elementary tree of the pronoun
e ’3sg’).

(24) α1-kume[tense:past, aspect:Impf ]

α2-e

It is interesting to notice that, in this context,
TMA markers can be treated similarly to Tense
and Aspect affixes in some agglutinative lan-
guages (see (Duchier et al., 2012) for an analy-
sis of Ikota – Bantu B25 – with XMG), diverging
only in the way they combine.

Of course, treating TMA markers as co-anchors
raises the question of the production of the numer-
ous elementary trees and the computational effi-
ciency of parsing with these.

Regarding the production of elementary trees,
the use of the XMG framework makes it pos-
sible to concisely describe elementary trees (in-
cluding TMA markers), the XMG compiler being
in charge of producing the redundant elementary
trees.9

Regarding the computational efficiency of pars-
ing with TAG grammars having TMA markers
embedded in verbal elementary trees, it may not
be a problem for the following reasons. While
this treatment of TMA markers causes the gram-
mar to have a much higher number of elementary
trees (TMA markers are no longer factored out,
as it is the case when using auxiliary trees), it is
worth considering two points.

First, Creoles are known to have little morphol-
ogy (McWhorter, 2001) and ST does not allow
many transformations (no voice and no argumen-
tal affixation). The extra cost of enlarging the

to that of the XTAG project (XTAG Research Group, 2001),
where the grammar is made of unanchored trees, anchoring
being realized at parsing.

9The question on how to produce the large lexicon used to
anchor the grammar (that is, containing the co-anchor equa-
tions) remains to be answered, nonetheless one option would
be to use techniques for automatic lexicon acquisition such
as that of (Sagot, 2005).

87



grammar size is thus low (and make ST grammar
size still reasonable).

Second, when replacing auxiliary trees with
co-anchoring equations, the parsing complexity
is somehow moved from the actual parsing step
(where adjunction is processed) to the lexical se-
lection and anchoring step (which is done prior
to actual parsing, see e.g. (Gardent et al., 2011)).
In other words, the complexity here raises when
selecting the right lexical entries, and anchoring
the many trees associated with these entries. But,
once the elementary trees are anchored, it will be
possible to select a pertinent subgrammar (that is,
to remove useless trees with respect to the sen-
tence to parse) using techniques such as polarity-
based filtering (Gardent et al., 2011).

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown how to implement
the concept of projection at an abstract level (the
meta-grammar) in order to describe a crucial do-
main of the syntax of São Tomense, namely the
TMA markers. We claim that the TMA markers
have to be integrated in the TAG elementary trees
of verbs instead of anchoring auxiliary trees, as
it was done before (Schang, 2000). This comes
from the fact these markers can be considered as
functional elements.

In this context, we chose to use a meta-
grammatical framework, namely the XMG sys-
tem, in order to facilitate the description of verbal
elementary trees equipped with nodes for TMA
markers. By facilitate, we do not only mean that
the meta-grammar compiler will take care of the
tedious task of producing the numerous elemen-
tary trees concerned with TMA markers, but also
(and mainly) that an abstract level may be the
right place to implement a linguistic theory such
as that of projection used here.
