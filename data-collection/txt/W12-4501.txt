Abstract

The CoNLL-2012 shared task involved pre-
dicting coreference in English, Chinese, and
Arabic, using the final version, v5.0, of the
OntoNotes corpus. It was a follow-on to the
English-only task organized in 2011. Un-
til the creation of the OntoNotes corpus, re-
sources in this sub-field of language process-
ing were limited to noun phrase coreference,
often on a restricted set of entities, such as
the ACE entities. OntoNotes provides a large-
scale corpus of general anaphoric coreference
not restricted to noun phrases or to a spec-
ified set of entity types, and covers multi-
ple languages. OntoNotes also provides ad-
ditional layers of integrated annotation, cap-
turing additional shallow semantic structure.
This paper describes the OntoNotes annota-
tion (coreference and other layers) and then
describes the parameters of the shared task in-
cluding the format, pre-processing informa-
tion, evaluation criteria, and presents and dis-
cusses the results achieved by the participat-
ing systems. The task of coreference has
had a complex evaluation history. Potentially
many evaluation conditions, have, in the past,
made it difficult to judge the improvement in
new algorithms over previously reported re-
sults. Having a standard test set and stan-
dard evaluation parameters, all based on a re-
source that provides multiple integrated anno-
tation layers (syntactic parses, semantic roles,
word senses, named entities and coreference)
and in multiple languages could support joint
modeling and help ground and energize on-
going research in the task of entity and event
coreference.

1 Introduction
The importance of coreference resolution for the

entity/event detection task, namely identifying all
mentions of entities and events in text and clustering
them into equivalence classes, has been well recog-
nized in the natural language processing community.

Early work on corpus-based coreference resolu-
tion dates back to the mid-90s by McCarthy and
Lenhert (1995) where they experimented with deci-
sion trees and hand-written rules. Corpora to support
supervised learning of this task date back to the Mes-
sage Understanding Conferences (MUC) (Hirschman
and Chinchor, 1997; Chinchor, 2001; Chinchor and
Sundheim, 2003). The de facto standard datasets
for current coreference studies are the MUC and the
ACE1 (Doddington et al., 2004) corpora. These cor-
pora were tagged with coreferring entities in the
form of noun phrases in the text. The MUC corpora
cover all noun phrases in text but are relatively small
in size. The ACE corpora, on the other hand, cover
much more data, but the annotation is restricted to a
small subset of entities.

Automatic identification of coreferring entities
and events in text has been an uphill battle for sev-
eral decades, partly because it is a problem that re-
quires world knowledge to solve and word knowl-
edge is hard to define, and partly owing to the lack
of substantial annotated data. Aside from the fact
that resolving coreference in text is simply a very
hard problem, there have been other hindrances that
further contributed to the slow progress in this area:

(i) Smaller sized corpora such as MUC which cov-
ered coreference across all noun phrases. Cor-
pora such as ACE which are larger in size, but
cover a smaller set of entities; and

(ii) low consistency in existing corpora annotated
with coreference — in terms of inter-annotator
agreement (ITA) (Hirschman et al., 1998) —
owing to attempts at covering multiple coref-
erence phenomena that are not equally anno-
tatable with high agreement which likely less-
ened the reliability of statistical evidence in the
form of lexical coverage and semantic related-
ness that could be derived from the data and

used by a classifier to generate better predic-
tive models. The importance of a well-defined
tagging scheme and consistent ITA has been
well recognized and studied in the past (Poe-
sio, 2004; Poesio and Artstein, 2005; Passon-
neau, 2004). There is a growing consensus that
in order to take language understanding appli-
cations such as question answering or distilla-
tion to the next level, we need more consistent
annotation for larger amounts of broad cover-
age data to train better automatic models for
entity and event detection.

(iii) Complex evaluation with multiple evaluation
metrics and multiple evaluation scenarios,
complicated with varying training and test
partitions, led to situations where many re-
searchers report results with only one or a few
of the available metrics and under a subset of
evaluation scenarios. This has made it hard to
gauge the improvement in algorithms over the
years (Stoyanov et al., 2009), or to determine
which particular areas require further attention.
Looking at various numbers reported in litera-
ture can greatly affect the perceived difficulty
of the task. It can seem to be a very hard prob-
lem (Soon et al., 2001) or one that is relatively
easy (Culotta et al., 2007).

(iv) the knowledge bottleneck which has been a
well-accepted ceiling that has kept the progress
in this task at bay.

These issues suggest that the following steps
might take the community in the right direction to-
wards improving the state of the art in coreference
resolution:

(i) Create a large corpus with high inter-
annotator agreement possibly by restricting
the coreference annotating to phenomena that
can be annotated with high consistency, and
covering an unrestricted set of entities and
events; and

(ii) Create a standard evaluation scenario with an
official evaluation setup, and possibly several
ablation settings to capture the range of perfor-
mance. This can then be used as a standard
benchmark by the research community.

(iii) Continue to improve learning algorithms that
better incorporate world knowledge and jointly
incorporate information from other layers of
syntactic and semantic annotation to improve
the state of the art.

One of the many goals of the OntoNotes
project2 (Hovy et al., 2006; Weischedel et al., 2011)

2http://www.bbn.com/nlp/ontonotes

was to explore whether it could fill this void and help
push the progress further — not only in coreference,
but with the various layers of semantics that it tries
to capture. As one of its layers, it has created a
corpus for general anaphoric coreference that cov-
ers entities and events not limited to noun phrases
or a subset of entity types. The coreference layer
in OntoNotes constitutes just one part of a multi-
layered, integrated annotation of shallow semantic
structures in text with high inter-annotator agree-
ment. This addresses the first issue.

In the language processing community, the field
of speech recognition probably has the longest his-
tory of shared evaluations held primary by NIST3
(Pallett, 2002). In the past decade machine trans-
lation has been a topic of shared evaluations also
by NIST4. There are many syntactic and semantic
processing tasks that are not quite amenable to such
continued evaluation efforts. The CoNLL shared
tasks over the past 15 years have filled that gap, help-
ing establish benchmarks and advance the state of
the art in various sub-fields within NLP. The impor-
tance of shared tasks is now in full display in the
domain of clinical NLP (Chapman et al., 2011) and
recently a coreference task was organized as part
of the i2b2 workshop (Uzuner et al., 2012). The
computational learning community is also witness-
ing a shift towards joint inference based evaluations,
with the two previous CoNLL tasks (Surdeanu et al.,
2008; Hajič et al., 2009) devoted to joint learning of
syntactic and semantic dependencies. A SemEval-
2010 coreference task (Recasens et al., 2010) was
the first attempt to address the second issue. It
included six different Indo-European languages —
Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, and Span-
ish. Among other corpora, a small subset (∼120K)
of English portion of OntoNotes was used for this
purpose. However, the lack of a strong participa-
tion prevented the organizers from reaching any firm
conclusions. The CoNLL-2011 shared task was an-
other attempt to address the second issue. It was well
received, but the shared task was only limited to the
English portion of OntoNotes. In addition, the coref-
erence portion of OntoNotes did not have a concrete
baseline prior to the 2011 evaluation, thereby mak-
ing it challenging for participants to gauge the per-
formance of their algorithms in the absence of es-
tablished state of the art on this flavor of annotation.
The closest comparison was to the results reported
by Pradhan et al. (2007b) on the newswire portion of
OntoNotes. Since the corpus also covers two other
languages from completely different language fami-
lies, Chinese and Arabic, it provided a great oppor-
tunity to have a follow-on task in 2012 covering all

three languages. As we will see later, peculiarities
of each of these languages had to be considered in
creating the evaluation framework.

The first systematic learning-based study in coref-
erence resolution was conducted on the MUC cor-
pora, using a decision tree learner, by Soon et al.
(2001). Significant improvements have been made
in the field of language processing in general, and
improved learning techniques have pushed the state
of the art in coreference resolution forward (Mor-
ton, 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2001; McCallum and
Wellner, 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Denis and
Baldridge, 2007; Rahman and Ng, 2009; Haghighi
and Klein, 2010). Researchers have continued to
find novel ways of exploiting ontologies such as
WordNet. Various knowledge sources from shallow
semantics to encyclopedic knowledge have been ex-
ploited (Ponzetto and Strube, 2005; Ponzetto and
Strube, 2006; Versley, 2007; Ng, 2007). Given
that WordNet is a static ontology and as such has
limitation on coverage, more recently, there have
been successful attempts to utilize information from
much larger, collaboratively built resources such as
Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006). More re-
cently researchers have used graph based algorithms
(Cai et al., 2011a) rather than pair-wise classifica-
tions. For a detailed survey of the progress in this
field, we refer the reader to a recent article (Ng,
2010) and a tutorial (Ponzetto and Poesio, 2009)
dedicated to this subject. In spite of all the progress,
current techniques still rely primarily on surface
level features such as string match, proximity, and
edit distance; syntactic features such as apposition;
and shallow semantic features such as number, gen-
der, named entities, semantic class, Hobbs’ distance,
etc. Further research to reduce the knowledge gap is
essential to take coreference resolution techniques to
the next level.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 presents an overview of the OntoNotes cor-
pus. Section 3 describes the range of phenomena
annotated in OntoNotes, and language-specific is-
sues. Section 4 describes the shared task data and
the evaluation parameters, with Section 4.4.2 exam-
ining the performance of the state-of-the-art tools
on all/most intermediate layers of annotation. Sec-
tion 5 describes the participants in the task. Sec-
tion 6 briefly compares the approaches taken by var-
ious participating systems. Section 7 presents the
system results with some analysis. Section 8 com-
pares the performance of the systems on the a subset
of the Engish test set that corresponds with the test
set used for the CoNLL-2011 evaluation. Section 9
draws some conclusions.

2 The OntoNotes Corpus
The OntoNotes project has created a large-scale

corpus of accurate and integrated annotation of mul-
tiple levels of the shallow semantic structure in text.
The English and Chinese language portion com-
prises roughly one million words per language of
newswire, magazine articles, broadcast news, broad-
cast conversations, web data and conversational
speech data. The English subcorpus also contains
an additional 200K words of the English translation
of the New Testament as Pivot Text. The Arabic por-
tion is smaller, comprising 300K words of newswire
articles. The hope is that this rich, integrated an-
notation covering many layers will allow for richer,
cross-layer models and enable significantly better
automatic semantic analysis. In addition to coref-
erence, this data is also tagged with syntactic trees,
propositions for most verb and some noun instances,
partial verb and noun word senses, and 18 named en-
tity types. Manual annotation of a large corpus with
multiple layers of syntax and semantic information
is a costly endeavor. Over the years in the devel-
opment of this corpus, there were various priorities
that came into play, and therefore not all the data in
the corpus could be annotated with all the different
layers of annotation. However, such multi-layer an-
notations, with complex, cross-layer dependencies,
demands a robust, efficient, scalable storage mech-
anism while providing efficient, convenient, inte-
grated access to the the underlying structure. To
this effect, it uses a relational database representa-
tion that captures both the inter- and intra-layer de-
pendencies and also provides an object-oriented API
for efficient, multi-tiered access to this data (Prad-
han et al., 2007a). This facilitates the extraction of
cross-layer features in integrated predictive models
that will make use of these annotations.

OntoNotes comprises the following layers of an-
notation:

• Syntax — A layer of syntactic annotation for
English, Chinese and Arabic based on a revised
guidelines for the Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1993; Babko-Malaya et al., 2006), the Chi-
nese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and the Arabic
Treebank (Maamouri and Bies, 2004).
• Propositions — The proposition structure of

verbs based on revised guidelines for the En-
glish PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Babko-
Malaya et al., 2006), the Chinese PropBank
(Xue and Palmer, 2009) and the Arabic Prop-
Bank (Palmer et al., 2008; Zaghouani et al.,
2010).
• Word Sense — Coarse-grained word senses

are tagged for the most frequent polysemous
verbs and nouns, in order to maximize token

3



coverage. The word sense granularity is tai-
lored to achieve 90% inter-annotator agreement
as demonstrated by Palmer et al. (2007). These
senses are defined in the sense inventory files.
In case of English and Arabic languages, the
sense-inventories (and frame files) are defined
separately for each part of speech that is real-
ized by the lemma in the text. For Chinese,
however the sense inventories (and frame files)
are defined per lemma — independent of the
part of speech realized in the text. For the
English portion of OntoNotes, each individual
sense has been connected to multiple WordNet
senses. This provides users direct access to the
WordNet semantic structure. There is also a
mapping from the OntoNotes word senses to
PropBank frames and to VerbNet (Kipper et
al., 2000) and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).
Unfortunately, owing to lack of comparable re-
sources as comprehensive as WordNet in Chi-
nese or Arabic, neither language has any inter-
resource mappings available.
• Named Entities — The corpus was tagged

with a set of 18 well-defined proper named en-
tity types that have been tested extensively for
inter-annotator agreement by Weischedel and
Burnstein (2005).
• Coreference — This layer captures general

anaphoric coreference that covers entities and
events not limited to noun phrases or a lim-
ited set of entity types (Pradhan et al., 2007b).
It considers all pronouns (PRP, PRP$), noun
phrases (NP) and heads of verb phrases (VP)
as potential mentions. Unlike English, Chinese
and Arabic have dropped subjects and objects
which were also considered during coreference
annotation5. We will take a look at this in detail
in the next section.

3 Coreference in OntoNotes
General anaphoric coreference that spans a rich

set of entities and events — not restricted to a few
types, as has been characteristic of most coreference
data available until now — has been tagged with a
high degree of consistency in the OntoNotes corpus.
Two different types of coreference are distinguished:
Identity (IDENT), and Appositive (APPOS). Identity
coreference (IDENT) is used for anaphoric corefer-
ence, meaning links between pronominal, nominal,
and named mentions of specific referents. It does not
include mentions of generic, underspecified, or ab-
stract entities. Appositives (APPOS) are treated sep-
arately because they function as attributions, as de-
scribed further below. Coreference is annotated for
all specific entities and events. There is no limit on

5As we will see later these are not used during the task.

the semantic types of NP entities that can be consid-
ered for coreference, and in particular, coreference
is not limited to ACE types. The guidelines are fairly
language independent. We will look at some salient
aspects of the coreference annotation in OntoNotes.
For more details, and examples, we refer the reader
to the release documentation. We will primarily use
English examples to describe various aspects of the
annotation and use Chinese and Arabic examples es-
pecially to illustrate phenomena not observed in En-
glish, or that have some language specific peculiari-
ties.
3.1 Noun Phrases

The mentions over which IDENT coreference ap-
plies are typically pronominal, named, or definite
nominal. The annotation process begins by automat-
ically extracting all of the NP mentions from parse
trees in the syntactic layer of OntoNotes annotation,
though the annotators can also add additional men-
tions when appropriate. In the following two exam-
ples (and later ones), the phrases in bold form the
links of an IDENT chain.

(1) She had a good suggestion and it was unani-
mously accepted by all.

(2) Elco Industries Inc. said it expects net income
in the year ending June 30, 1990, to fall below a
recent analyst’s estimate of $ 1.65 a share. The
Rockford, Ill. maker of fasteners also said it
expects to post sales in the current fiscal year
that are “slightly above” fiscal 1989 sales of $
155 million.

Noun phrases (NPs) in Chinese can be complex
noun phrases or bare nouns (nouns that lack a de-
terminer such as “the” or “this”). Complex noun
phrases contain structures modifying the head noun,
as in the following examples:

(3) (他担任总统任内最后一次 的 (亚太经
济合作会议 (高峰会))).
((His last APEC (summit meeting)) as the
President)

(4) (越南 统一 后 (第一 位 前往 当地 访问 的
(美国总统)))
((The first (U.S. president)) who went to visit
Vietnam after its unification)

In these examples, the smallest phrase in paren-
theses is the bare noun. The longer phrase in paran-
theses includes modifying structures. All the expres-
sions in the parantheses, however, share the same
head noun, i.e., “高峰会 (summit meeting)”, and
“美国总统 (U.S. president)” respectively. Nested
noun phrases, or nested NPs, are contained within

4



longer noun phrases. In the above example, “sum-
mit meeting” and “U.S. president” are nested NPs.
Wherever NPs are nested, the largest logical span is
used in coreference.

3.2 Verbs
Verbs are added as single-word spans if they can

be coreferenced with a noun phrase or with another
verb. The intent is to annotate the VP, but the single-
word verb head is marked for convenience. This
includes morphologically related nominalizations as
in (5) and noun phrases that refer to the same event,
even if they are lexically distinct from the verb as in
(6). In the following two examples, only the chains
related to the growth event are shown in bold. The
Arabic translation of the same example identifies
mentions using parantheses.

(5) The European economy grew rapidly over the
past years, this growth helped raising ....

(6) Japan’s domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses
in October rose 18% from a year earlier to
500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan
Automobile Dealers’ Association said. The
strong growth followed year-to-year increases
of 21% in August and 12% in September.

3.3 Pronouns
All pronouns and demonstratives are linked to

anything that they refer to, and pronouns in quoted
speech are also marked. Expletive or pleonastic pro-
nouns (it, there) are not considered for tagging, and
generic you is not marked. In the following exam-
ple, the pronoun you and it would not be marked. (In
this and following examples, an asterisk (*) before a
boldface phrase identifies entity/event mentions that
would not be tagged in the coreference annotation.)

(7) Senate majority leader Bill Frist likes to tell
a story from his days as a pioneering heart
surgeon back in Tennessee. A lot of times,
Frist recalls, *you’d have a critical patient ly-
ing there waiting for a new heart, and *you’d
want to cut, but *you couldn’t start unless *you
knew that the replacement heart would make
*it to the operating room.

In Chinese, all the following pronouns — 你，
我，他, 她, 它， 你们，我们，他们，它们，
我, 您, 咱们 (you, me, he, she, and so on), and
demonstrative pronouns —这个，那个，这些,那
些 (this, that, these, those) in singular, plural or pos-
sessive forms are linked to anything they refer to.

Pronouns from classical Chinese such as 其 中
(among which),其 (he/she/it),之 (he/she/it) are also
linked with other mentions to which they refer.

In Arabic, the following pronouns are corefer-
enced – nominative personal pronouns (subject) and
demonstrative pronouns which are detached. Sub-
ject pronouns are often null in Arabic; overt subject
pronouns are rare, but do occur.

(Our, your, their)

Pronouns such as你，您，你们，大家，各位
can be considered generic. In this case, they are not
linked to other generic mentions in the same dis-
course. For example,

(8) 请 *大大大家家家带好自己的随身物品。*大家请
下车。
Please take your belongings with *you. Please
get off the train, *everyone.

In Chinese, if the subject or object can be recov-
ered from the context, or if it is of little interest for
the reader/listener to know, it can be omitted. In
the Chinese Treebank, a small *pro* in inserted in
positions where the subject or object is omitted. A
*pro* can be replaced by overt NPs if they refer to
the same entity or event, and the *pro* and its overt
NP antecedent do not have to be in the same sen-
tence. Exactly what *pro* stands for is determined
by the linguistic context in which it appears.

(9) 吉林省主管经贸工作的副省长全哲洙说：“
(*pro*) 欢迎国际社会同(我我我们们们) 一一一道道道，，，共共共
同同同推进图门江开发事业，促进区域经济发
展，造福东北亚人民。
Quan Zhezhu, Vice Governor of Jinlin
Province who is in charge of economics and
trade, said: “(*pro*) Welcome international
societies to join (us) in the development of Tu-
men Jiang, so as to promote regional economic
development and benefit people in Northeast
Asia.

5



Sometimes, *pro*s cannot be recovered in the
text—i.e., an overt NP cannot be identified as their
antecedent in the same text — and therefore they are
not linked. For instance, the *pro* in existential sen-
tences usually cannot be recovered or linked in the
annotation, as in the following example:

(10) (*pro*) 有二十三顶高新技术项目进区开
发。
There are 23 high-tech projects under develop-
ment in the zone.

Also, if *pro* does not refer to a specific entity or
event, it is considered generic *pro* and not linked
as in (11).

(11) 肯德基 、 麦当劳 等 速食店 全 大陆 都 推
出了 (*pro*)买套餐赠送布质或棉质圣
诞老人玩具的促销.
In Mainland China, fast food restaurants such
as Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s
have launched their promotional packages by
providing free cotton Santa toys for each
combo (*pro*) purchased.

Finally, *pro*s in idiomatic expressions are not
linked. Similar to Chinese, Arabic null subjects and
objects are also eligible for coreference and treated
similarly. In the Arabic Treebank, these are marked
with just an “*”. There exists few of these instances
in English — marked (yet differently) with a *PRO*
in the treebank and which are connected in Prop-
Bank annotation but not in coreference.
3.4 Generic mentions

Generic nominal mentions can be linked with re-
ferring pronouns and other definite mentions, but not
with other generic nominal mentions.

This would allow linking of the bolded mentions
in (12) and (13), but not in (14).

(12) Officials said they are tired of making the
same statements.

(13) Meetings are most productive when they are
held in the morning. Those meetings, how-
ever, generally have the worst attendance.

(14) Allergan Inc. said it received approval to
sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first
foldable silicone lens available for *cataract
surgery. The lens’ foldability enables it to be
inserted in smaller incisions than are now pos-
sible for *cataract surgery.

Bare plurals, as in (12) and (13), are always con-
sidered generic. In example (15) below, there are
three generic instances of parents. These are marked
as distinct IDENT chains (with separate chains dis-
tinguished by subscripts X, Y and Z), each contain-
ing a generic and the related referring pronouns.

(15) ParentsX should be involved with theirX
children’s education at home, not in school.
TheyX should see to it that theirX kids don’t
play truant; theyX should make certain that
the children spend enough time doing home-
work; theyX should scrutinize the report card.
ParentsY are too likely to blame schools for the
educational limitations of theirY children. If
parentsZ are dissatisfied with a school, theyZ
should have the option of switching to another.

In (16) below, the verb “halve” cannot be linked to
“a reduction of 50%”, since “a reduction” is indefi-
nite.

(16) Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to
*halve its foreign debt of $64 billion — the
third-highest in the developing world . Ar-
gentina aspires to reach *a reduction of 50%
in the value of its external debt.

3.5 Pre-modifiers
Proper pre-modifiers can be coreferenced, but

proper nouns that are in a morphologically adjectival
form are treated as adjectives, and are not corefer-
enced. For example, adjectival forms of GPEs such
as Chinese in “the Chinese leader”, would not be
linked. Thus we could coreference United States in
“the United States policy” with another referent, but
not American in “the American policy.” GPEs and
Nationality acronyms (e.g. U.S.S.R. or U.S.). are
also considered adjectival. Pre-modifier acronyms
can be coreferenced unless they refer to a national-
ity. Thus in the examples below, FBI can be corefer-
enced to other mentions, but U.S. cannot.

(17) FBI spokesman
(18) *U.S. spokesman

In Chinese adjectival and nominal forms of GPEs
are not morphologically distinct, and in such cases
the annotator decides whether it is an adjectival us-
age. Usually if something is tagged as NORP then it
is not considered as a mention.

Dates and monetary amounts can be considered
part of a coreference chain even when they occur as
pre-modifiers.

(19) The current account deficit on France’s balance
of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French
francs ($236.8 million) in August from a re-
vised 2.1 billion francs in July, the Finance
Ministry said. Previously, the July figure was
estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs.

3.6 Copular verbs
Attributes signaled by copular structures are not

marked; these are attributes of the referent they mod-
ify, and their relationship to that referent will be cap-
tured through word sense and proposition annota-
tion.

(21) JohnX is a linguist. PeopleY are nervous
around JohnX, because heX always corrects
theirY grammar.

Copular (or ’linking’) verbs are those verbs that
function as a copula and are followed by a subject
complement. Some common copular verbs are: be,
appear, feel, look, seem, remain, stay, become, end
up, get. Subject complements following such verbs
are considered attributes and are not linked. Since
Called is copular, neither IDENT nor APPOS corefer-
ence is marked in the following case.

(22) Called Otto’s Original Oat Bran Beer, the brew
costs about $12.75 a case.

Some examples of copular verbs in Chinese are
是 (to be) and 为 (to be, to serve as). In addition,
other verbs (particularly so-called light verbs) that
trigger an attributive reading on the following NP:成
为 (become), (当)选为 (is elected),称为 (is called),
(好)像 (looks like),叫做 (is called), etc.

(23) (上海海海)是是是*(中中中国国国最最最大大大的的的城城城市市市)。。。(上上上海海海)发发发
展展展得得得很很很快快快。。。
(Shanghai) is *(the largest city in China).
(Shanghai) develops fast.

In the above example, the two mentions of 上上上
海海海 (Shanghai) co-refer with each other, but the en-
tity does not co-refer with 中中中国国国最最最大大大的的的城城城 市市市 (the
largest city in China).

3.7 Small clauses
Like copulas, small clause constructions are not

marked as coreferent. The following example is
treated as if the copula were present (“John consid-
ers Fred to be an idiot”):

(24) John considers *Fred *an idiot.

Note that the mention Fred, however, can be con-
nected to other mentions of Fred in the text.

3.8 Temporal expressions
Temporal expressions such as the following are

linked:

(25) John spent three years in jail. In that time...

Deictic expressions such as now, then, today, tomor-
row, yesterday, etc. can be linked, as well as other
temporal expressions that are relative to the time of
the writing of the article, and which may therefore
require knowledge of the time of the writing to re-
solve the coreference. Annotators were allowed to
use knowledge from outside the text in resolving
these cases. In the following example, the end of
this period and that time can be coreferenced, as can
this period and from three years to seven years.
(26) The limit could range from three years to

seven yearsX, depending on the composition
of the management team and the nature of its
strategic plan. At (the end of (this period)X)Y,
the poison pill would be eliminated automati-
cally, unless a new poison pill were approved
by the then-current shareholders, who would
have an opportunity to evaluate the corpora-
tion’s strategy and management team at that
timeY.

In multi-date temporal expressions, embedded
dates are not separately connected to other mentions
of that date. For example in Nov. 2, 1999, Nov.
would not be linked to another instance of November
later in the text.
3.9 Appositives

Because they logically represent attributions, ap-
positives are tagged separately from Identity coref-
erence. They consist of a head, or referent (a noun
phrase that points to a specific object/concept in the
world), and one or more attributes of that referent.
An appositive construction contains a noun phrase
that modifies an immediately-adjacent noun phrase
(separated only by a comma, colon, dash, or paren-
thesis). It often serves to rename or further define
the first mention. Marking appositive constructions
allows capturing the attributed property even though
there is no explicit copula.

(27) Johnhead, a linguistattribute

The head of each appositive construction is distin-
guished from the attribute according to the following
heuristic specificity scale, in a decreasing order from
top to bottom:

Type Example

Proper noun John
Pronoun He
Definite NP the man
Indefinite specific NP a man I know
Non-specific NP man

This leads to the following cases:

Type Description

Annotator Error An annotator error. This is a catch-all category for cases of errors that do not fit in the other
categories.

Genuine Ambiguity This is just genuinely ambiguous. Often the case with pronouns that have no clear an-
tecedent (especially this & that)

Generics One person thought this was a generic mention, and the other person didn’t
Guidelines The guidelines need to be clear about this example
Callisto Layout Something to do with the usage/design of Callisto
Referents Each annotator thought this was referring to two completely different things
Possessives One person did not mark this possessive
Verb One person did not mark this verb
Pre Modifiers One person did not mark this Pre Modifier
Appositive One person did not mark this appositive
Copula Disagreement arose because this mention is part of a copular structure

a) Either each annotator marked a different half of the copula
b) Or one annotator unnecessarily marked both

(30) a principal of the firmattribute, J. Smithhead

In cases where the two members of the appositive
are equivalent in specificity, the left-most member of
the appositive is marked as the head/referent. Defi-
nite NPs include NPs with a definite marker (the) as
well as NPs with a possessive adjective (his). Thus
the first element is the head in all of the following
cases:

(31) The chairman, the man who never gives up

(32) The sheriff, his friend

(33) His friend, the sheriff

In the specificity scale, specific names of diseases
and technologies are classified as proper names,
whether they are capitalized or not.

(34) A dangerous bacteria, bacillium, is found

When the entity to which an appositive refers is
also mentioned elsewhere, only the single span con-
taining the entire appositive construction is included
in the larger IDENT chain. None of the nested NP

spans are linked. In the example below, the en-
tire span can be linked to later mentions to Richard
Godown.

The sub-spans are not included separately in the
IDENT chain.

(35) Richard Godown, president of the Indus-
trial Biotechnology Association

Ages are tagged as attributes (as if they were el-
lipses of, for example, a 42-year-old):

(36) Mr.Smithhead, 42attribute,

Similar rules apply for Chinese and Arabic. Un-
like English, where most appositives have a punctu-
ation marker, in Chinese that is not necessarily the
frequent case. In the following example we can see
an appositive construction without any punctuations
between the head and the attribute.

3.10 Special Issues
In addition to the ones above, there are some spe-

cial cases such as:

• No coreference is marked between an organi-
zation and its members.
• GPEs are linked to references to their govern-

ments, even when the references are nested
NPs, or the modifier and head of a single NP.
• In extremely rare cases, metonymic mentions

can be co-referenced. This is done only when
the two mentions clearly and without a doubt
refer to the same entity. For example:

(38) In a statement released this afternoon, 10
Downing Street called the bombings in
Casablanca “a strike against all peace-
loving people.”

(39) In a statement, Britain called the
Casablanca bombings “a strike against all
peace-loving people.”

In this case, it is obvious that “10 Down-
ing Street” and “Britain” are being used inter-
changeably in the text. Again, if there is any
ambiguity, however, these terms are not coref-
erenced with each other.
• In Arabic, verbal inflections are not considered

pronominal and are not coreferenced. The por-
tion marked with an * in the example below is
an inflection and not a pronoun, and so should
not be marked.

3.11 Annotator Agreement and Analysis
Table 1 shows the inter-annotator and annotator-

adjudicator agreement on all the genres and lan-
guages of OntoNotes. A 15K disagreements in var-
ious parts of the English data was analyzed, and
grouped into one of the categories shown in Figure
1. Figure 2 shows the distribution of these differ-
ent types that were found in that sample. It can be
seen that genuine ambiguity and annotator error are
the biggest contributors — the latter of which is usu-
ally captured during adjudication, thus showing the
increased agreement between the adjudicated ver-
sion and the individual annotator version. Interest-
ingly, this mirrors the annotator disagreement analy-
sis on the MUC corpus provided by Hirschman et al.
(1998).

4 CoNLL-2012 Coreference Task
The CoNLL-2012 shared task was held across all

three languages — English, Chinese and Arabic —
of the OntoNotes v5.0 data. The task was to auto-
matically identify mentions of entities and events in
text and to link the coreferring mentions together to
form entity/event chains. The coreference decisions
had to be made using automatically predicted infor-
mation on other structural and semantic layers in-
cluding the parses, semantic roles, word senses, and
named entities. Given various factors, such as the
lack of resources and state-of-the-art tools, and time
constraints, we could not provide some layers of in-
formation for the Chinese and Arabic portion of the
data.

The three languages are from quite different lan-
guage families. The morphology of these languages
is quite different. Arabic has a complex morphol-
ogy, English has limited morphology, whereas Chi-
nese has very little morphology. English word seg-
mentation amounts to rule-based tokenization, and
is close to perfect. In the case of Chinese and Ara-
bic, although the tokenization/segmentation is not
as good as English, the accuracies are in the high
90s. Syntactically, there are many dropped subjects
and objects in Arabic and Chinese, whereas English
is not a pro-drop language. Another difference is
the amount of resources available for each language.
English has probably the most resources at its dis-
posal, whereas Chinese and Arabic lack significantly

9



— Arabic more so than Chinese. Given this fact,
plus the fact that the CoNLL format cannot handle
multiple segmentations, and that it would compli-
cate scoring since we are using exact token bound-
aries (as discussed later in Section 4.5), we decided
to allow the use of gold, treebank segmentation for
all languages. In the case of Chinese, the words
themselves are lemmas, so no additional informa-
tion needs to be provided. For Arabic, by default
written text is unvocalised, so we decided to also
provide correct, gold standard lemmas, along with
the correct vocalized version of the tokens. Table 2
lists which layers were available and quality of the
provided layers (when provided.)

As is customary for CoNLL tasks, there were two
primary tracks — closed and open. For the closed
track, systems were limited to using the distributed
resources, in order to allow a fair comparison of al-
gorithm performance, while the open track allowed
for almost unrestricted use of external resources in
addition to the provided data. Within each closed
and open track, we had an optional supplementary
track which allowed us to run some ablation studies
over a few different input conditions. This allowed
us to evaluate the systems given: i) Gold mention
boundaries (GB), ii) Gold mentions (GM), and iii)
Gold parses (GS). We will refer to the main task –
where no mention boundaries are provided – as NB.

4.1 Primary Evaluation
The primary evaluation comprises the closed and

open tracks where predicted information is provided
on all layers of the test set other than coreference. As
mentioned earlier, we provide gold lemma and vo-
calization information for Arabic, and we use gold
standard treebank segmentation for all three lan-
guages.

6The predicted part of speech for Arabic are a mapped down
version of the richer gold version present in the treebank

4.1.1 Closed Track
In the closed track, systems were limited to the

provided data. For the training and test data, in
addition to the underlying text, predicted versions
of all the supplementary layers of annotation were
provided using off-the-shelf tools (parsers, semantic
role labelers, named entity taggers, etc.) retrained on
the training portion of the OntoNotes data — as de-
scribed in Section 4.4.2. For the training data, how-
ever, in addition to predicted values for the other lay-
ers, we also provided manual, gold-standard anno-
tations for all the layers. Participants were allowed
to use either the gold-standard or predicted annota-
tion to train their systems. They were also free to
use the gold-standard data to train their own models
for the various layers of annotation, if they judged
that those would either provide more accurate pre-
dictions or alternative predictions for use as multiple
views, or if they wished to use a lattice of predic-
tions.

More so than previous CoNLL shared tasks,
coreference predictions depend on world knowl-
edge, and many state-of-the-art systems use infor-
mation from external resources such as WordNet,
which provides a layer of information that could
help a system recognize semantic connections be-
tween the various lexicalized mentions in the text.
Therefore, in the case of English, similar to the pre-
vious year’s task, we allowed the use of WordNet in
the closed track. Since word senses in OntoNotes
are predominantly7 coarse-grained groupings of
WordNet senses, systems could also map from the
predicted or gold-standard word senses to the sets
of underlying WordNet senses. Another significant
piece of knowledge that is particularly useful for
coreference but that is not available in the layers of
OntoNotes is that of number and gender. There are
many different ways of predicting these values, with
differing accuracies, so in order to ensure that par-
ticipants in the closed track were working from the
same data, thus allowing clearer algorithmic com-
parisons, we specified a particular table of number
and gender predictions generated by Bergsma and
Lin (2006), for use during both training and test-
ing. Unfortunately neither Arabic, nor Chinese have
comparable resources available that we could allow
participants to use. Chinese, in particular, does not
have number or gender inflections for nouns, but
(Baran and Xue, 2011) look at a way to infer such
information.

4.1.2 Open Track
In addition to resources available in the closed

track, in the open track, systems were allowed to use

7There are a few instances of novel senses introduced in
OntoNotes which were not present in WordNet, and so lack a
mapping back to the WordNet senses

external resources such as Wikipedia, gazetteers etc.
The purpose of this track is mainly to get an idea
of the performance ceiling on the task at the cost of
not being able to perform a fair comparison across
all systems. Another advantage of the open track is
that it might reduce the barriers to participation by
allowing participants to field existing research sys-
tems that already depend on external resources —
especially if there were hard dependencies on these
resources — so they can participate in the task with
minimal, or no modification to their existing system.

4.2 Supplementary Evaluation
In addition to the option of selecting between the

primary closed or the open tracks, the participants
also had an option to run their systems in the follow-
ing ablation settings.

Gold Mention Boundaries (GB) In this case, we
provided all possible correct mention boundaries in
the test data. This essentially entails all NPs, and
PRPs in the data extracted from the gold parse trees,
as well as the mentions that do not align with any
parse constituent, for example, non-existent con-
stituents in the predicted parse owing to errors, some
named entities, etc.

Gold Mentions (GM) In this dataset, we provided
only and all the correct mentions for the test sets,
thereby reducing the task to one of pure mention
clustering, and eliminating the task of mention de-

tection and anaphoricity determination8. These also
include potential spans that do not align with any
constituent in the predicted parse tree.

Gold Parses (GS) In this case, for each language,
we replaced the predicted parses in the closed track
data with manual, gold parses.

4.3 Train, Development and Test Splits
For various reasons, not all the documents in

OntoNotes have been annotated with all the different
layers of annotation, with full coverage.9 There is a
core portion, however, which is roughly 1.6M En-
glish words, 950K Chinese words, and 300K Arabic
words which has been annotated with all the layers.
This is the portion that we used for the shared task.

We used the same algorithm as in CoNLL-2011 to
8Mention detection interacts with anaphoricity determina-

tion since the corpus does not contain any singleton mentions.
9As mentioned earlier, large scale manual annotation of var-

ious layers of syntax and semantics is an expensive endeavor.
Adding to this, the fact that word sense annotation is most ef-
ficiently done one lemma at a time, ideally all instances of the
same across the entire corpus, or as large a portion as possi-
ble, full coverage across all lemma instances is hard to achieve
given the long tail of low frequency lemmas with a Zipfian dis-
tribution. Similar issue affects PropBank annotation, but fur-
thermore, currently it only covers mostly verb predicates, and a
few eventive noun predicates.

11These numbers are for the part of OntoNotes v5.0 that have

all layers of annotation including coreferenced.

numbers in parenthesis for the OntoNotes corpus indicate the total number of parts that correspond to the documents.
Each part was considered a separate document for evaluation purposes.

create the train/development/test partitions for En-
glish, Chinese and Arabic. We tried to reuse pre-
viously established partitions for Chinese and Ara-
bic, but either they were not in the selection used for
OntoNotes, or were partially overlapping, or had a
very small portion of OntoNotes covered in the test
set. Unfortunately, unlike English WSJ partitions,
there was no clean way of reusing those partitions.
Algorithm 1 details this procedure. The list of train-
ing/development/test document IDs can be found on
the task webpage12. Following the recent CoNLL
tradition, participants were allowed to use both the
training and the development data to train their final
model(s).

The number of documents in the corpus for this
task, for each of the different languages, and for
each of the training/development/test portions, are
shown in Table 3. For comparison purposes, it also
lists the number of documents in the MUC-6, MUC-
7, and ACE (2000-2004) corpora. The MUC-6 data
was taken from the Wall Street Journal, whereas the
MUC-7 data was from the New York Times. The ACE
data spanned many different languages and genres
similar to the ones in OntoNotes. In fact, there is
some overlap between ACE and OntoNotes source
documents.

4.4 Data Preparation
This section gives details of the different annota-

tion layers including the automatic models that were
used to predict them, and describes the formats in
which the data was provided to the participants.

12http://conll.cemantix.org/2012/download/ids/

For each language there are two sub-directories
— “all” contains more general lists which include
documents that had at least one of the layers of an-
notation, and “coref” contains the lists that include
document that have coreference annotation. The former
were used to generate training/development/test sets
for layers other than coreference, and the latter was
used to generate training/development/test sets for the
coreference layer used in this shared task.

4.4.1 Manual Annotation Gold Layers
Let us take a look at the manually annotated, or

gold layers of information that were made available
for the training data.

Coreference The manual coreference annotation
is stored as chains of linked mentions connecting
multiple mentions of the same entity. Coreference is
the only document-level phenomenon in OntoNotes,
and the complexity of annotation increases non-
linearly with the length of a document. Unfortu-
nately, some of the documents — especially the
ones in the broadcast conversation, weblogs, and
telephone conversation genre — are very long and
that prohibited efficient annotation in their entirety.
These had to be split into smaller parts. A few passes
to join some adjacent parts were conducted, but
since some documents had as many as 17 parts, there
are still multi-part documents in the corpus. Since
the coreference chains are coherent only within each
of these document parts, for the purpose of this task,
each such part is treated as a separate document. An-
other thing to note is that there were some cases
of sub-token annotation in the corpus owing to the
fact that tokens were not split at hyphens. Cases
such as pro-WalMart had the sub-span WalMart linked
with another instance of WalMart. The recent Tree-
bank revision split tokens at most hyphens and made
a majority of these sub-token annotations go away.
There were still some residual sub-token annota-
tions. Since subtoken annotations cannot be repre-
sented in the CoNLL format, and they were a very
small quantity — much less than even half a per-
cent — we decided to ignore them. Unlike English,
Chinese and Arabic have coreference annotation on
elided subjects/objects. Recovering these entities in
text is a hard problem, and the most recently re-
ported numbers in literature for Chinese are around
a F-score of 50 (Yang and Xue, 2010; Cai et al.,
2011b). For Arabic there have not been much stud-
ies on recovering these. A study by Gabbard (2010)
shows that these can be recovered with an F-score

12



of 55 with automatic parses and roughly 65 using
gold parses13. Considering the level of prediction
accuracy of these tokens, and the relative frequency
of the same, plus the fact that the CoNLL tabular
format is not amenable to a variable number of to-
kens, we decided not to consider them as part of
the task. In other words, we removed the manually
identified traces (*pro* and *) respectively in Chi-
nese and Arabic Treebanks. We also do not consider
the links that are formed by these tokens in the gold
evaluation key.

Tables 4 and 5 shows the distribution of mentions
by the syntactic categories, and the counts of enti-
ties, links and mentions in the corpus respectively.
Interestingly the mentions formed by these dropped
pronouns total roughly about 11% for both Chinese
and Arabic. All of this data has been Treebanked
and PropBanked either as part of the OntoNotes ef-
fort, or some previous effort.

Parse Trees These represent the syntactic layer
that is a revised version of the treebanks in English,
Chinese and Arabic. Arabic treebank has probably
seen the most revision over the past few years, in an
effort to increase consistency. For purposes of this
task, traces were removed from the syntactic trees,
since the CoNLL-style data format, being indexed
by tokens, does not provide any good means of con-
veying that information. As mentioned in the previ-
ous section, these include the cases of traces in Chi-
nese and Arabic which are dropped subjects/objects

13These numbers are not in the thesis, but we received them
in an email communication with the Ryan Gabbard.

that are legitimate targets for coreference annota-
tion. Function tags were also removed, since the
parsers that we used for the predicted syntax layer
did not provide them. One thing that needs to be
dealt with in conversational data is the presence of
disfluencies (restarts, etc.). In the English parses
of the OntoNotes, the disfluencies are marked using
a special EDITED14 phrase tag — as was the case
for the Switchboard Treebank. Given the frequency
of disfluencies and the performance with which one
can identify them automatically,15 a probable pro-
cessing pipeline would filter them out before pars-
ing. Since we did not have a readily available tag-
ger for tagging disfluencies, we decided to remove
them using oracle information available in the En-
glish Treebank, and the coreference chains were
remapped to trees without disfluencies. Owing to
various constraints, we decided to retain the disflu-
encies in the Chinese data. Since Arabic portion of
the corpus is all newswire, this had no impact on
it. However, for both Chinese and Arabic, since we
remove trace tokens corresponding to dropped pro-
nouns, all the other layers of annotation had to be
remapped to the remaining sequence of tree tokens.

Propositions The propositions in OntoNotes are
PropBank-style semantic roles for English, Chinese
and Arabic. Most of the verb predicates in the cor-
pus have been annotated with their arguments. As
part of the OntoNotes effort, some enhancements
were made to the English PropBank and Treebank
to make them synchronize better with each other
(Babko-Malaya et al., 2006). One of the outcomes
of this effort was that two types of LINKs that rep-
resent pragmatic coreference (LINK-PCR) and selec-

14There is another phrase type — EMBED in the telephone
conversation genre which is similar to the EDITED phrase type,
and sometimes identifies insertions, but sometimes contains
logical continuation of phrases by different speakers, so we de-
cided not to remove that from the data.

15A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one
can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational
speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 Precision
and 67 recall.

tional preferences (LINK-SLC) were added to Prop-
Bank. More details can be found in the addendum to
the PropBank guidelines16 in the OntoNotes v5.0 re-
lease. Since the community is not used to this repre-
sentation which relies heavily on the trace structure
in the Treebank which we are excluding, we decided
to unfold the LINKs back to their original represen-
tation as in the PropBank 1.0 release. This function-
ality is part of the OntoNotes DB Tool.17

Word Sense Gold standard word sense annotation
was supplied using sense numbers (along with the
sense inventories) as specified in the OntoNotes list
of senses for each lemma. The coverage of the word
sense annotation varies among the languages. En-
glish has the most coverage, while coverage for Chi-
nese and Arabic is more sporadic. Even for English,
the coverage for word sense annotation is not com-
plete. Only some of the verbs and nouns are anno-
tated with word sense information.

Named Entities Named Entities in OntoNotes
data are specified using a catalog of 18 Name types.

Other Layers Discourse plays a vital role in
coreference resolution. In the case of broadcast con-
versation, or telephone conversation data, it partially
manifests itself in the form of speakers of a given ut-
terance, whereas in weblogs or newsgroups it does
so as the writer, or commenter of a particular article
or thread. This information provides an important
clue for correctly linking anaphoric pronouns with
the right antecedents. This information could be au-
tomatically deduced, but since it would add addi-
tional complexity to the already complex task, we
decided to provide oracle information of this meta-
data both during training and testing. In other words,
speaker and author identification was not treated as
an annotation layer that needed to be predicted. This
information was provided in the form of another col-
umn in the .conll file. There were some cases of
interruptions and interjections that led to a sentence
associated with two different speakers, but since the
frequency of this was quite small, we decided to
make an assumption of one speaker/writer per sen-
tence.

4.4.2 Predicted Annotation Layers
The predicted annotation layers were derived us-

ing automatic models trained using cross-validation
on other portions of OntoNotes v5.0 data. As
mentioned earlier, there are some portions of the
OntoNotes corpus that have not been annotated for
coreference but that have been annotated for other
layers. For training models for each of the layers,
where feasible, we used all the data that we could

for that layer from the training portion of the entire
OntoNotes v5.0 release.

Parse Trees Predicted parse trees for English were
produced using the Charniak parser18 (Charniak and
Johnson, 2005). Some additional tag types used
in the OntoNotes trees were added to the parser’s
tagset, including the NML tag that has recently been
added to capture internal NP structure, and the rules
used to determine head words were extended corre-
spondingly. Chinese and Arabic parses were gen-
erated using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein,
2007). In the case of Arabic, the parsing commu-
nity uses a mapping from rich Arabic part of speech
tags, to Penn-style part of speech tags. We used the
mapping that is included with the Arabic treebank.

The predicted parses for the training portion of
the data were generated using 10-fold (5-fold for
Arabic) cross-validation. The development and test
parses were generated using a model trained on the
entire training portion. We used OntoNotes v5.0
training data for training the Chinese and Arabic
parser models, but the OntoNotes v4.0 subset of
OntoNotes v5.0 data was used for training the En-
glish model. We decided to do the latter to be able to
better compare the scores to the CoNLL-2011 eval-
uation given that parser is a central component to a
coreference system, and the fact that OntoNotes v5.0
adds a small fraction of gold parses on top of those
provided by OntoNotes v4.0. Table 6 shows the per-
formance of the re-trained parsers on the CoNLL-
2012 test set. We did not get a chance to re-train the
re-ranker available for English, and since the stock
re-ranker crashes when run on n-best parses contain-
ing NMLs, because it has not seen that tag in train-
ing, we could not make use of it. In addition to the
parser scores and part of speech accuracy, we have
also added a column for the accuracy for the NPs
because they are particularly relevant to the corefer-
ence task.

19There was an error in processing the test set, therefore the
performance on the test set was slightly lower than the correct
one reported in the table. The performance of the sense tagging
the offical test set is 77.6 (R), 71.5 (P) and 74.4 (F).

Table 8: Word sense performance over both verbs and nouns in the CoNLL-2012 test set.

Word Sense This year we used the IMS (It Makes
Sense) (Zhong and Ng, 2010) word sense tagger.20
Word sense information, unlike syntactic parse in-
formation is not central to approaches taken by cur-
rent coreference systems and so we decided to use
a better word sense tagger to get a good state of the
art accuracy estimate, at the cost of a completely fair
(but, still close enough) comparison with English
CoNLL-2011 results. This will also allow potential
future uses to benefit from it. IMS was trained on
all the word sense data that is present in the train-
ing portion of the OntoNotes corpus using cross-
validated predictions on the input layers similar to
the proposition tagger. During testing, for English
and Arabic, IMS must first uses the automatic POS
information to identify the nouns and verbs in the
test data, and then assign senses to the automatically

20We offer special thanks to Hwee Tou Ng and his student
Zhi Zhong for training IMS models and providing output for
the development and test sets.

identified nouns and verbs. In case of Arabic, IMS
uses gold lemmas. Since automatic POS tagging is
not perfect, IMS does not always output a sense to
all word tokens that need to be sense tagged due to
wrongly predicted POS tags. As such, recall is not
the same as precision on the English and Arabic test
data. Recall that in Chinese, the word senses are
defined against lemmas and are independent of the
part of speech. Since we provide gold word seg-
mentation, IMS attempts to sense tag all correctly
segmented Chinese words, so recall and precision
are same and so is F1. Table 7 gives the number of
lemmas covered by the word sense inventory in the
English, Chinese and Arabic portion of OntoNotes.

Table 8 shows the performance of this classifier
aggregated over both the verbs and nouns in the
CoNLL-2012 test set. For English, genres PT and
TC, and for Chinese genres TC and WB, no gold stan-
dard senses were available, and so their accuracies
could not be computed.

Propositions We used ASSERT21 (Pradhan et al.,
2005) to predict the propositional structure for En-
glish. Similar to the parser model for English,
the same proposition model that was used in the
CoNLL-2011 shared task — trained on all the train-
ing portion of the OntoNotes v4.0 data using cross-
validated predicted parses — was used to generate
the propositions for the development and test sets
for this evaluation. We took a two stage approach
to tagging where The NULL arguments are first fil-
tered out, and the remaining NON-NULL arguments
are classified into one of the argument types. The
argument identification module used an ensemble
of ten classifiers — each trained on a tenth of the
training data and combined using unweighted vot-
ing. This should still give a close to state-of-the-
art performance given that the argument identifi-
cation performance tends to start to be asymptotic
around 10K training instances (Pradhan et al., 2005).
The Chinese propositional structure was predicted
with the Chinese semantic role labeler described in
(Xue, 2008), retrained on all the training portion of
the OntoNotes v5.0 data. No propositional struc-
tures were provided for Arabic due to resource con-
straints. Table 9 shows the detailed performance
numbers. The CoNLL-2005 scorer was used to com-
pute the scores. At first glance, the performance on
the English newswire genre is much lower than what
has been reported for WSJ Section 23. This could
be attributed to several factors: i) the fact that we
had to compromise on the training method, ii) the
newswire in OntoNotes not only contains WSJ data,
but also Xinhua news, iii) The WSJ training and test
portions in OntoNotes are a subset of the standard
ones that have been used to report performance ear-
lier; iv) the PropBank guidelines were significantly
revised during the OntoNotes project in order to syn-

chronize well with the Treebank, and finally v) it in-
cludes propositions for be verbs missing from the
original PropBank. It looks like the newly added
Pivot Text data (comprising of the New Testament)
shows very good performance. This is not surprising
given a similar trend in it parsing performance.

In addition to automatically predicting the argu-
ments, we also trained a classifier to tag PropBank
frameset IDs for the English data. Table 7 lists
the number of framesets available across the three
languages22 An overwhelming number of them are
monosemous, but the more frequent verbs tend to be
polysemous. Table 10 gives the distribution of num-
ber of framesets per lemma in the PropBank layer of
the English OntoNotes v5.0 data.

During automatic processing of the data, we
tagged all the tokens that were tagged with a part
of speech VBx. This means that there would be cases
where the wrong token would be tagged with propo-
sitions.
Named Entities BBN’s IdentiFinderTMsystem
was used to predict the named entities. For the
CoNLL-2011 shared task we did not get a chance
to re-train Identifinder, and used the stock model
which did not have the same set of named entities
as in the OntoNotes corpus, so we decided to

re-train it on the Chinese and Arabic data, Table

Other Layers As noted earlier, systems were al-
lowed to make use of gender and number predic-
tions for NPs using the table from Bergsma and Lin
(Bergsma and Lin, 2006), and the speaker meta-
data for broadcast conversations, telephone conver-
sations and author or poster metadata for weblogs
and newsgroups.

4.4.3 Data Format
In order to organize the multiple, rich layers of

annotation, the OntoNotes project has created a
database representation for the raw annotation layers
along with a Python API to manipulate them (Prad-
han et al., 2007a). In the OntoNotes distribution the
data is organized as one file per layer, per document.
The API requires a certain hierarchical structure
with various annotation layers represented by file
extensions for the documents at the leaves, and
language, genre, source and section within a partic-
ular source forming the intermediate directories —
data/<language>/annotations/<genre>/<source>/

<section>/<document>.<layer>. It comes with
various ways of querying and manipulating the data
and allows convenient access to the information
inside the sense inventory and PropBank frame
files instead of having to interpret the raw .xml.
However, maintaining format consistency with
earlier CoNLL tasks was deemed convenient for

sites that already had tools configured to deal
with that format. Therefore, in order to distribute
the data so that one could make the best of both
worlds, we created a new file extension — .conll
which logically served as another layer in addition
to the .parse, .prop, .sense, .name and .coref
layers which house the respective annotations.
Each .conll file contained a merged representation
of all the OntoNotes layers in the CoNLL-style
tabular format with one line per token, and with
multiple columns for each token specifying the
input annotation layers relevant to that token, with
the final column specifying the target coreference
layer. Because we are not authorized to distribute
the underlying text, and many of the layers contain
inline annotation, we had to provide a skeletal form
(.skel) of the .conll file which is essentially the
.conll file, but with the column that contains the
words, anonymized. We provided an assembly
script that participants could use to create a .conll
file taking as input the .skel file and the top-level
directory of the OntoNotes distribution that they
had separately downloaded from the LDC23. Once
the .conll file is created, it can be used to create
the individual layers such as .parse, .name, and
.coref that have inline annotation, with the provided
scripts. We provide the layers that have standoff
annotation (mostly with respect to the tokens in the
treebank) like the .prop and .sense along with the
.skel file.

In the CoNLL-2011 task, there were a few issues,
where some teams used the test data accidentally
during training. To prevent it from happening again

23OntoNotes is deeply grateful to the Linguistic Data Con-
sortium for making the source data freely available to the task
participants.

this year, we were advised by the steering commit-
tee to distribute the data in two installments. One for
training and development and the other for testing.
The test data released from LDC did not contain the
coreference layer. Therefore, this year unlike previ-
ous CoNLL tasks, the test data contained some truly
unseen documents. This made it easier to spot po-
tential training errors such as ones that occurred in
the CoNLL-2011 task. Table 12 describes the data
provided in each of the column of the .conll format.
Figure 3 shows a sample from a .conll file.

4.5 Evaluation
This section describes the evaluation criteria used

for the shared task. Unlike propositions, word sense
and named entities, where it is simply a matter of
counting the correct answers, or for parsing, where
there is an established metric, evaluating the accu-
racy of coreference continues to be contentious. Var-
ious alternative metrics have been proposed, as men-
tioned below, which weight different features of a
proposed coreference pattern differently. The choice
is not clear in part because the value of a particular
set of coreference predictions is integrally tied to the
consuming application. A further issue in defining a
coreference metric concerns the granularity of the
mentions, and how closely the predicted mentions
are required to match those in the gold standard for
a coreference prediction to be counted as correct.
Our evaluation criterion was in part driven by the
OntoNotes data structures. OntoNotes coreference
makes the distinction between identity coreference
and appositive coreference, treating the latter sepa-
rately. Thus we evaluated systems only on the iden-
tity coreference task, which links all categories of
entities and events together into equivalent classes.
The situation with mentions for OntoNotes is also
different than it was for MUC or ACE. OntoNotes
data does not explicitly identify the minimum ex-
tents of an entity mention, but it does include hand-
tagged syntactic parses. Thus for the official evalua-
tion, we decided to use the exact spans of mentions
for determining correctness. The NP boundaries
for the test data were pre-extracted from the hand-
tagged Treebank for annotation, and events trig-
gered by verb phrases were tagged using the verbs
themselves. This choice means that scores for the
CoNLL-2012 coreference task are likely to be lower
than for coreference evaluations based on MUC, or
ACE data, where an approximate match is often al-
lowed based on the specified head of the mentions.

4.5.1 Metrics
As noted above, the choice of an evaluation met-

ric for coreference has been a tricky issue and there
does not appear to be any silver bullet that addresses
all the concerns. Three metrics have been commonly
used for evaluating coreference performance over an

unrestricted set of entity types: i) The link based
MUC metric (Vilain et al., 1995), ii) The mention
based B-CUBED metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)
and iii) The entity based CEAF (Constrained En-
tity Aligned F-measure) metric (Luo, 2005). Very
recently BLANC (BiLateral Assessment of Noun-
Phrase Coreference) measure (Recasens and Hovy,
2011) has been proposed as well. Each metric tries
to address the shortcomings or biases of the earlier
metrics. Given a set of key entities K, and a set of
response entitiesR, with each entity comprising one
or more mentions, each metric generates its variation
of a precision and recall measure. The MUC measure
is the oldest and most widely used. It focuses on
the links (or, pairs of mentions) in the data.24 The
number of common links between entities in K and
R divided by the number of links in K represents
the recall, whereas, precision is the number of com-
mon links between entities in K and R divided by
the number of links in R. This metric prefers sys-
tems that have more mentions per entity — a sys-
tem that creates a single entity of all the mentions
will get a 100% recall without significant degrada-
tion in its precision. And, it ignores recall for single-
ton entities, or entities with only one mention. The
B-CUBED metric tries to addresses MUC’s shortcom-
ings, by focusing on the mentions and computes re-
call and precision scores for each mention. If K is
the key entity containing mention M, and R is the re-
sponse entity containing mention M, then recall for
the mention M is computed as |K∩R||K| and precision

for the same is is computed as |K∩R||R| . Overall recall
and precision are the average of the individual men-
tion scores. CEAF aligns every response entity with
at most one key entity by finding the best one-to-one
mapping between the entities using an entity simi-
larity metric. This is a maximum bipartite matching
problem and can be solved by the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm. This is thus a entity based measure. De-
pending on the similarity, there are two variations
— entity based CEAF — CEAFe and a mention based
CEAF — CEAFm. Recall is the total similarity di-
vided by the number of mentions in K, and preci-
sion is the total similarity divided by the number of
mentions in R. Finally, BLANC uses a variation on
the Rand index (Rand, 1971) suitable for evaluating
coreference. There are a few other measures — one
being the ACE value, but since this is specific to a
restricted set of entities (ACE types), we did not con-
sider it.

4.5.2 Official Evaluation Metric
In order to determine the best performing system

in the shared task, we needed to associate a single

24The MUC corpora did not tag single mention entities.

number with each system. This could have been
one of the metrics above, or some combination of
more than one of them. The choice was not sim-
ple, and after having consulted various researchers
in the field, we came to a conclusion that each met-
ric had its pros and cons and there is no silver bul-
let. Therefore we settled on the MELA metric pro-
posed by Denis and Baldridge (2009), which takes a
weighted average of three metrics: MUC, B-CUBED,
and CEAF. The rationale for the combination is that
each of the three metrics represents a different, im-
portant dimension. The MUC measure is based on
links. The B-CUBED is based on mentions, and the
CEAF is based on entities. We decided to use the en-
tity based CEAFe instead of mention based CEAFm.
For a given end application, a weighted average of
the three might be optimal, but since we don’t have
a particular end task in mind, we decided to use the
unweighted mean of the three metrics as the score
on which the winning system was judged. This still
leaves us with a score for each language. We wanted
to encourage researchers to run their systems on all
three languages. Therefore, we decided to compute
the final official score that would determine the win-
ning submission as the average of the MELA metric
across all the three languages. We decided to give a
MELA score of zero to every language that a partic-
ular group did not run its system on.

4.5.3 Scoring Metrics Implementation
We used the same core scorer implementation25

that was used for the SEMEVAL-2010 task, and
which implemented all the different metrics. There
were a couple of modifications done to this scorer
since then.

1. Only exact matches were considered cor-
rect. Previously, for SEMEVAL-2010 non-
exact matches were judged partially correct
with a 0.5 score if the heads were the same
and the mention extent did not exceed the gold
mention.

2. The modifications suggested by Cai and Strube
(2010) have been incorporated in the scorer.

Since there are differences in the version used for
CoNLL and the one available on the download site,
and it is possible that the latter would be revised in
the future, we have archived the version of the scorer
on the CoNLL-2012 task webpage.26

5 Participants
A total of 41 different groups demonstrated in-

terest in the shared task by registering on the task

25http://www.lsi.upc.edu/∼esapena/downloads/index.php?id=3
26http://conll.bbn.com/download/scorer.v4.tar.gz

webpage. Of these, 16 groups from 6 countries sub-
mitted system outputs on the test set during the eval-
uation week. 15 groups participated in at least one
language in the closed task, and only one group par-
ticipated solely in the open track. One participant
(yang) did not submit a final task paper. Tables 13
and 14 list the distribution of the participants by
country and the participation by language and task
type.

6 Approaches
Tables 15 and 16 summarize the approaches taken

by the participating systems along some important
dimensions. While referring to the participating sys-
tems, as a convention, we will use the last name of
the contact person from the participating team. It is
almost always the last name of the first author of the
system papers, or the first name in case of conflicting
last names (xinxin). The only exception is chunyang
which is the first name of the second author for that
system. For space and readability purposes, while
referring to the systems in the paper we will refer
to the system by the primary contact name in italics
instead of using explicit citations.

Most of the systems divided the problem into the
typical two phases — first identifying the potential
mentions in the text, and then linking the mentions
to form coreference chains, or entities. Many sys-
tems used rule-based approaches for mention detec-
tion, though one, yang did use trained models, and
li used a hybrid approach by adding mentions from
a trained model to the ones identified using rules.
All systems ran a post processing stage, after linking
potential mentions together, to delete the remaining
unlinked mentions. It was common for the systems
to represent the markables (mentions) internally in

27The participant did not submit a final paper, so this infor-
mation is based on an email correspondence.

terms of individual parse tree NP constituent spans.
Some systems consider only mention-specific at-
tributes while performing the clustering, but the re-
cent trend seems to indicate a shared attribute model,
where the attributes of an entity are determined col-
lectively by heuristically merging the attribute types
and values of its constituent mentions. For example,
if a mention marked singular is clustered with an-
other entity marked plural, then the collective num-
ber for the entity is assigned to be {singular, plu-
ral}. Various types of trained models were used
for predicting coreference. For a learning-based
system, generation of positive and negative exam-
ples is very important. The participating systems
used a range of sentence windows surrounding the
anaphor in generating these examples. In the sys-
tems that used trained models, many systems used
the approach described in Soon et al. (2001) for se-
lecting the positive and negative training examples,
while others used some of the alternative approaches
that have been introduced in the literature more re-
cently. Following on the success of rule-based link-
ing model in the CoNLL-2011 shared task, many
systems used a completely rule-based linking model,
or used it as a initializing, or intermediate step in a
learning based system. A hybrid approach seems
to be a central theme of many high scoring sys-
tems. Also, taking cue from last year’s systems, al-
most all systems trained pleonastic it classifiers, and
used speaker-based constraints/features for the con-
versation genre. Many systems used the predicted
Arabic parts of speech that were mapped-down to
Penn-style parts of speech, but stamborg used some
heuristics to convert them back to the complex part
of speech type, using more frequent mapping, to
get better performance for Arabic. The fernandes
system uses feature templates defined on mention
pairs. björkelund mentions that disallowing transi-
tive closures gave performance improvement of 0.6
and 0.4 respectively for English and Chinese/Arabic.
björkelund also mentions seeing a considerable in-
crease in performance after adding features that cor-
respond to the Shortest Edit Script (Myers, 1986)
between surface forms and unvocalised Buckwal-
ter forms, respectively. These could be better at
capturing the differences in gender and number sig-
naled by certain morphemes than hand-crafted rules.
chen built upon the sieve architecture proposed in
Raghunathan et al. (2010) and added one more sieve
— head match — for Chinese and modified two
sieves. Some participants tried to incorporate pecu-
liarities of the corpus in their systems. For example,
martschat excluded adjectival nation names. Unlike
English, and especially in absence of an external re-
source, it is hard to make a gender distinction in
Arabic and Chinese. martschat used the information

that 先先先生(sir) and 女士(lady) often suggest gender
information. bo and martschat used plurality mark-
ers 们 to identify plurals. For example, 同学 (stu-
dent) is singular and同学们 (students) is plural. bo
also uses a heuristic that if the word和 (and) appears
in the middle of a mention M, and the two parts sep-
arated by和 are sub-mentions of M, then mention M
is considered to be plural. Other words which have
the similar meaning of 和, such as 同, 与 and 跟,
are also considered. uryupina used the rich part of
speech tags to classify pronouns into subtype, per-
son number and gender. Chinese and Arabic do not
have definite noun phrase markers like the in En-
glish. In contrast to English there is no strict en-
forcement of using definite noun phrases when re-
ferring to an antecedent in Chinese. Both 这次演
说 (the talk) and 演说 (talk) can corefer with the
antecedent 克林顿在河内大选的演说 (Clinton’s
talk during Hanoi election). This makes it very diffi-
cult to distinguish generic expressions from referen-
tial ones. martschat checks whether the phrase starts
with a definite/demonstrative indicator (e.g.,这(this)
or 那(that)) in order to identify demonstrative and
definite noun phrases. For Arabic, uryupina consid-
ers as definite all mentions with definite head nouns
(prefixed with “Al”) and all the idafa constructs with
a definite modifier. chang uses training data to iden-
tify inappropriate mention boundaries. They per-
form a relaxed matching between predicted men-
tions and gold mentions ignoring punctuation marks
and mentions that start with one of the following:
adverb, verb, determiner, and cardinal number. In
another extreme, xiong translated Chinese and Ara-
bic to English, and ran an English system and pro-
jected mentions back to the source languages. Un-
fortunately, it did not work quite well by itself. One
issue that they faced was that many instances of pro-
nouns did not have a corresponding mention in the
source language (since we do not consider mentions
formed by dropped subjects/objects). Nevertheless,
using this in addition to performing coreference res-
olution in these languages could be useful. Similar
to last year, most participants appear not to have fo-
cused much on eventive coreference, those corefer-
ence chains that build off verbs in the data. This usu-
ally means that nominal mentions that should have
linked to the eventive verb were instead linked in
with some other entity, or remained unlinked. Par-
ticipants may have chosen not to focus on events be-
cause they pose unique challenges while making up
only a small portion of the data (Roughly 90% of
mentions in the data are NPs and pronouns). Many of
the trained systems were also able to improve their
performance by using feature selection, the details
varied depending on the example selection strategy
and the classifier used.

7 Results
In this section we will take a look at the perfor-

mance overview of various systems and then look
at the performance for each language in various set-
tings separately. For the official test, beyond the raw
source text, coreference systems were provided only
with the predictions for the other annotation layers
(parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named en-
tities). A high-level summary of the results for the
systems on the primary evaluation for both open and
closed tracks is shown in Table 17. The scores un-
der the columns for each language are the average
of MUC, BCUBED and CEAFe for that language. The
column Official Score is the average of those per-
language averages, but only for the closed track. If a
participant did not participate in all three languages,
then they got a score of zero for the languages that
were not attempted. The systems are sorted in de-
scending order of this final Official Score. The last
two columns indicate whether the systems used only
the training or both training and development for
the final submissions. Most top performing systems
used both training and development data for training
the final system. Note that all the results reported
here still used the same, predicted information for
all input layers.

It can be seen that fernandes got the highest com-
bined score (58.69) across all three languages and
metrics. While scores for each individual language
are lower than the figures cited for other corpora, it
is as expected, given that the task here includes pre-
dicting the underlying mentions and mention bound-
aries, the insistence on exact match, and given that
the relatively easier appositive coreference cases are
not included in this measure. The combined score
across all languages is purely for ranking purposes,
and does not really tell much about each individual
language. Owing to the ordering based on official
score, not all the best performing systems for a par-
ticular language are in sequential order. Therefore,
for easier reading, the scores of the top ranking sys-
tem are in bold red, and the top four systems are
underlined in the table.

Looking at the the English performance, we can
see that fernandes gets the best average across the
three selected metrics (MUC, BCUBED and CEAFe).
The next best system is martschat (61.31) followed
very closely by björkelund (61.24) and then chang
(60.18). The performance differences between the
better-scoring systems were not large, with only
about three points separating the top four systems,
and only six out of a total of sixteen systems getting
a score lower than 58 points which was the highest
performing score in CoNLL-2011.28

In case of Chinese, it is seen that chen performs

the best with a score of 62.24. This is then followed
by yuan (60.69), and then björkelund (59.97) and
xu (59.22). It is interesting to note that the scores
for the top performing systems for both English and
Chinese are very close. For all we know, this is just
a coincidence. Also, for both English and Chinese,
the top performing system is almost 2 points higher
than the second best system.

On the Arabic language front, once again, fernan-
des has the highest score of 54.22, followed closely
by björkelund (53.55) and then uryupina (50.41)

Since the majority of mentions in all the three
languages are noun phrases or pronouns, the accu-
racy with which these are predicted in the parse trees
should directly bear on the coreference scores. Since
pronouns are a closed class and single words, the
main focus falls on the accuracy of the noun phrases.
By no means is the accuracy of noun phrases the
only factor determining the overall coreference ac-
curacy, but it cannot be ignored either. It can be ob-
served that the coreference scores for the three lan-
guages are in the same trend as the noun phrase ac-
curacies for those languages as seen in Table 6. Re-
call that in case of both Chinese and Arabic, there
are roughly 11% instances of dropped pronouns that
were not considered as part of the evaluation. The
performance for Chinee and Arabic would decrease
somewhat if these were considered in the set of gold
mentions (and entities).

Tables 18 and 19 show similar information for the
two supplementary tasks — one given gold mention
boundaries (GB) and one given correct, gold men-
tions (GM). We have however, kept the same rela-
tive ordering of the system participants as in Table
17 for ease of reading. Looking at Table 18 care-
fully, we can see that for English and Arabic the rel-
ative ranking of the systems remain almost the same,
except for a few outliers: chang performs the best
given gold mentions — by almost 7 points over the
next best performing system. In the case of Chinese,
chen performs almost 6 points better than the official
performance given gold boundaries, and another 9
points given gold mentions and almost 8 points bet-
ter than the next best system using gold mentions.
We will look at more details in the following sec-
tions.

As mentioned earlier in Section 4.2 we conducted
some supplementary evaluations. These can be cat-
egorized by a combination of two parameters. One
of which applies to both training and test set, and
one can only apply to the test set. The two parame-
ters are: i) Syntax and ii) Mention Quality. Syntax
can take two values: i) predicted (PS), or ii) gold
(GS), and can be applicable during either training or
test; and, the mention quality can be of three values:
i) No boundaries (NB), ii) Gold mention boundaries

Figure 4: Performance for eight participating systems for the three languages, across the three mention qualities.

(GB) and iii) Gold mentions (GM), and can only be
applicable during testing (since this information is
not optional during training, as is the case with us-
ing gold or predicted syntax). There are a total of
twelve combinations that we can form of using these
parameters. Out of these, we thought six were par-
ticularly interesting. This is the product of the three
cases of mention quality — NB, GB and GM, and two
cases of syntax – GS and PS used during testing.

Figure 4 shows a performance plot for eight par-
ticipating systems that attempted both the supple-
mentary tasks — GB and GM in addition to the main
NB for at least one of the three languages. These
are all in the closed setting. At the bottom of the
plot you can see dots that indicate what test condi-
tion to which a particular point refers. In most cases,
for the hardest task — NB — the English and Chi-
nese performances track quite close to each other.
When provided with gold mention boundaries (GB),
systems, chen, xu and yuan do significantly better
in Chinese. There is almost no positive effect on
the English performance across the board. In fact,
performance of the stamborg and li systems drops
noticeably. There is also a drop in performance for
the björkelund system, but the difference is probably
not significant. Finally, when provided with gold
mentions, the performance of all systems increases
across all languages, with chang showing the high-
est gain for English, and chen showing the highest

gain for Chinese.

Figure 5 is a box and whiskers plot of the per-
formance for all the systems for each language and
variations — NB, GB, and GM. The circle in the cen-
ter indicates the mean of the performances. The hor-
izontal line in between the box indicates the median,
and the bottom and top of the boxes indicate the first
and third quartiles respectively, with the whiskers in-
dicating the highest and lowest performance on that
task. It can be easily seen that the English systems
have the least divergence, with the divergence large
for the GM case probably owing to chang. This is
somewhat expected as this is the second year for the
English task, and so it does show a more mature and
stable performance. On the other hand, both Chinese
and Arabic plots show much more divergence, with
the Chinese and Arabic GB case showing the highest
divergence. Also, except for Chinese GM condition,
there is some skewness in the score distribution one
way or the other.

Some participants ran their systems on six of
the twelve possible combinations for all three lan-
guages. Figure 6 shows a plot for these tree par-
ticipants — fernandes, björkelund, and chen. As in
Figure 4, the dots at the bottom help identify which
particular combination of parameters the point on
the plot represents. In addition to the three test
conditions related to mention quality, we now also
have two more test conditions relating to the syntax.

26



We can see that the fernandes and björkelund, sys-
tem performance tracks very close to each other. In
other words, using gold standard parses during test-
ing does not show much benefit in those cases. In
case of chen, however, using gold parses shows a
significant jump in scores for the NB condition. It
seems that somehow, chen makes much better use
of the gold parses. In fact, the performance is very
close to the one with the GB condition. It is not clear
what this system is doing differently that makes this
possible. Adding more information, i.e., the GM
condition, improves the performance by almost the
same delta as going from NB to GB.

Finally, Figure 7 shows the plot for one system —
björkelund — that was ran on ten of the twelve dif-
ferent settings. As usual the dots at the bottom help
identify the conditions for a point on the plot. Now,
there is a condition related to the quality of syntax
during training as well. For some reasons, using
gold syntax hurts performance — though slightly —
in the NB and GB settings. Chinese does show some

improvement when gold parse is used for training,
only when gold mentions are available during test-
ing.

One point to note is that we cannot compare
these results to the ones obtained in the SEMEVAL-
2010 coreference task which used a small portion of
OntoNotes data because it was only using nominal
entities, and had heuristically added singleton men-
tions29.

29The documentation that comes with the SEMEVAL data
package from LDC (LDC2011T01) states: “Only nominal
mentions and identical (IDENT) types were taken from the
OntoNotes coreference annotation, thus excluding coreference
relations with verbs and appositives. Since OntoNotes is only
annotated with multi-mention entities, singleton referential ele-
ments were identified heuristically: all NPs and possessive de-
terminers were annotated as singletons excluding those func-
tioning as appositives or as pre-modifiers but for NPs in the pos-
sessive case. In coordinated NPs, single constituents as well
as the entire NPs were considered to be mentions. There is no
reliable heuristic to automatically detect English expletive pro-
nouns, thus they were (although inaccurately) also annotated as
singletons.”

Figure 6: Performance of fernandes, björkelund and chen over six different settings.

In the following sections we will look at the re-
sults for the three languages, in various settings in
more detail. It might help to describe the format of
the tables first. Given that our choice of the official
metric was somewhat arbitrary, it is also useful to
look at the individual metrics. The tables are simi-
lar in structure to Table 20. Each table provides re-
sults across multiple dimensions. For completeness,
the tables include the raw precision and recall scores
from which the F-scores were derived. Each table
shows the scores for a particular system for the task
of mention detection and coreference resolution sep-
arately. The tables also include two additional scores
(BLANC and CEAFm) that did not factor into the of-
ficial score. Useful further analysis may be possible
based on these results beyond the preliminary results
presented here. As you recall, OntoNotes does not
contain any singleton mentions. Owing to this pecu-
liar nature of the data, the mention detection scores
cannot be interpreted independently of the corefer-
ence resolution scores. In this scenario, a mention
is effectively an anaphoric mention that has at least
one other mention coreferent with it in the docu-
ment. Most systems removed singletons from the
response as a post-processing step, so not only will

they not get credit for the singleton entities that they
incorrectly removed from the data, but they will be
penalized for the ones that they accidentally linked
with another mention. What this number does in-
dicate is the ceiling on recall that a system would
have got in absence of being penalized for making
mistakes in coreference resolution. The tables are
sub-divided into several logical horizontal sections
separated by two horizontal lines. There can be a
total of 12 sections, each categorized by a combi-
nation of two parse quality features GS and PS for
each training and test set and three variations on the
mention qualities — NB, GB, and GM, as described
earlier. Just like we used the dots below the graphs
earlier to indicate the parameters that were chosen
for a particular point on the plot, we use small black
squares in the tables after the participant name, to
indicate the conditions chosen for the results on that
particular row. Since there are many rows to each
table, in order to facilitate finding which number we
are referring to, we have added a ID column which
uses letters e, c, and a to refer to the three languages
— English, Chinese and Arabic. This is followed by
a decimal number, in which the number before the
decimal identifies the logical block within the table

that share the same experiment parameters, and the
one after the decimal indicates the index of a par-
ticular system in that block. Systems are sorted by
the official score within each block. All the sys-
tems with NB setting are listed first, followed by GB,
followed by GM. One participant (björkelund) ran
more variations than we had originally planned, but
since it falls under the general permutation and com-
bination of the settings that we were considering, it
makes sense to list those results here as well.

7.1 English Closed
Table 20 shows the performance for the English

language in greater detail.

Official Setting Recall is quite important in the
mention detection stage because the full coreference
system has no way to recover if the mention de-
tection stage misses a potentially anaphoric men-
tion. The linking stage indirectly impacts the final
mention detection accuracy. After a complete pass
through the system some correct mentions could re-
main unlinked with any other mentions and would
be deleted thereby lowering recall. Most systems
tend to get a close balance between recall and preci-
sion for the mention detection task. A few systems
had a considerable gap between the final mention
detection recall and precision (fernandes, xu, yang,
li and xinxin). It is not clear why this might be the
case. One commonality between the ones that had
a much higher precision than recall was that they

used machine learned classifiers for mention detec-
tion. This could be possible because any classifier
that is trained will not normally contain singleton
mentions (as none have been annotated in the data)
unless one explicitly adds them to the set of train-
ing examples (which is not mentioned in any of the
respective system papers). A hybrid rule-based and
machine learned model (fernandes) performed the
best. Apart from some local differences, the rank-
ing for all the systems is roughly the same irrespec-
tive of which metric is chosen. The CEAFe mea-
sure seems to penalize systems more harshly than
the other measures. If the CEAFe measure does in-
dicate the accuracy of entities in the response, this
suggests that fernandes is doing better on getting co-
herent entities than any other system.

Gold Mention Boundaries In this case, all possi-
ble mention boundaries are provided to the system.
This is very similar to what annotators see when
they annotate the documents. One difficulty with
this supplementary evaluation is that these bound-
aries alone provide only very partial information.
For the roughly 10 to 20% of mentions that the auto-
matic parser did not correctly identify, while the sys-
tems knew the correct boundaries, they had no struc-
tural syntactic or semantic information, and they
also had to further approximate the already heuris-
tic head word identification. This incomplete data
complicates the systems’ task and also complicates
interpretation of the results. While most systems did

29



slightly better here in terms of raw scores, the per-
formance was not much different from the official
task, indicating that mention boundary errors result-
ing from problems in parsing do not contribute sig-
nificantly to the final output.30

Gold Mentions Another supplementary condition
that we explored was if the systems were supplied
with the manually-annotated spans for all and only
those mentions that did participate in the gold stan-
dard coreference chains. This supplies significantly
more information than the previous case, where ex-
act spans were supplied for all NPs, since the gold
mentions will also include verb headwords that are
linked to event NPs, and will not include singleton
mentions, which do not end up as part of any chain.
The latter constraint makes this test seem artificial,
since it directly reveals part of what the systems are
designed to determine, but it still has some value in
quantifying the impact that mention detection and
anaphoricity determination has on the overall task
and what the results are if they are perfectly known.
The results show that performance does go up signif-
icantly, indicating that it is markedly easier for the
systems to generate better entities given gold men-
tions. Although, ideally, one would expect a perfect
mention detection score, it is the case that many of
the systems did not get a 100% recall. This could
possibly be owing to unlinked singletons that were
removed in post-processing. chang along with fer-
nandes are the only systems that got a perfect 100%
recall. The reason is most likely because they had
a hard constraint to link all mentions with at least
one other mention. chang (77.22 [e7.00]) stands out
in that it has a 7 point lead on the next best sys-
tem in this category. This indicates that the link-
ing algorithm for this system is significantly superior
than the other systems — especially since the perfor-
mance of the only other system that gets 100% men-
tion score (fernandes) is much lower (69.35 [e7.03])

Gold Test Parses Looking at Table 20 it can be
seen that there is a slight increase (∼1 point) in per-
formance across all the systems when gold parses
across all settings — NB, GB, and GM. In the case
of björkelund for the NB setting, the overall perfor-
mance improves by a percent when using gold test
parse during testing (61.24 [e0.02] vs 62.23 [e1.02]),
but strangely if gold parses are used during train-
ing as well, the performance is slightly lower (61.71
[e3.00]), although this difference is probably not sta-
tistically significant.

30It would be interesting to measure the overlap between the
entity clusters for these two cases, to see whether there was
any substantial difference in the mention chains, besides the ex-
pected differences in boundaries for individual mentions.

7.2 Chinese Closed
Table 21 shows the performance for the Chinese

language in greater detail.

7.2.1 Official Setting
In this case, it turns out that chen does about 2

points better than the next best system across all the
metrics. We know that this system had some more
Chinese-specific improvements. It is strange that
fernandes has a much lower mention recall with a
much higher precision as compared to chen. As far
as the system descriptions go, both systems seem to
have used the same set of mentions — except for
chen including QP phrases and not considering inter-
rogative pronouns. One thing we found about chen
was that they dealt with nested NPs differently in
case of the NW genre to achieve some performance
improvement. This unfortunately seems to be ad-
dressing a quirk in the Chinese newswire data owing
to a possible data inconsistency in the release.

7.2.2 Gold Mention Boundaries
Unlike English, just the addition of gold mention

boundaries improves the performance of almost all
systems significantly. The delta improvement for
fernandes turns out to be small, but it does gain on
the mention recall as compared to the NB case. It
is not clear why this might be the case. One ex-
planation could be that the parser performance for
constituents that represent mentions — primarily NP
might be significantly worse than that for English.
The mention recall of all the systems is boosted by
roughly 10%.

7.2.3 Gold Mentions
Providing gold mention information further sig-

nificantly boosts all systems. More so is the case
with chen [e8.00] which gains another 9 points over
the gold mention boundary condition in spite of the
fact that they don’t have a perfect recall. On the
other hand, fernandes gets a perfect mention recall
and precision, but ends up getting a 11 point lower
performance [c8.05] than chen. Another thing to
note is that for the CEAFe metric, the incremental
drop in performance from the best to the next best
and so on, is substantial, with a difference of 17
points between chen and fernandes. It does seem
that the chen and yuan algorithm for linking is much
better than the others.

7.2.4 Gold Test Parses
When provided with gold parses for the test set,

there is a substantial increase in performance for the
NB condition – numerically more so than in case of
English. The degree of improvement decreases for
the GB and GM conditions.

7.3 Arabic Closed
Table 22 shows the performance for the Arabic

language in greater detail.

7.3.1 Official Setting
Unlike English and Chinese, none of the system

was particularly tuned for Arabic. This gives us an
unique opportunity to test the performance variation
of a mostly statistical, roughly language indepen-
dent mechanism. Although, there could possibly be
a significant bias that Arabic language brings to the
mix. The overall performance for Arabic seems to
be about ten points below both English and Chinese.
On the mention detection front, most of the systems
have a balanced precision and recall, and the drop
in performance seems quite steady. björkelund has
a slight edge on fernandes on the MUC, BCUBED
and BLANC metrics, but fernandes has a much larger
lead on both the CEAF metrics, putting it on the top
in the official score. We haven’t reported the de-
velopment set numbers here, but another thing to
note especially for Arabic is that performance on
Arabic test set is significantly better than on the de-
velopment set as pointed out by björkelund. This
is probably because of the smaller size of the train-
ing set and therefore a higher relative increment over
training set. The size of the training set (which is
roughly about a third of either Engish or Chinese)
also could itself be a factor that explains the lower
performance, and that Arabic performance might
gain from more data. chen did not use development
data for the final models. Using that could have in-
creased their score.

7.3.2 Gold Mention Boundaries
The system performance given gold boundaries

followed more of the trend in English than Chinese.
There was not much improvement over the primary
NB evaluation. Interestingly, chen uses gold bound-
aries for Chinese so well, but does not get any per-
formance improvement. This might indicate that the
technique that helped that system in Chinese does
not generalize well across languages.

7.3.3 Gold Mentions
Performance given gold mentions seems to be

about ten points higher than in the NB case.
björkelund does well on BLANC metric than fernan-
des even after getting a big hit in recall for mention
detection. In absence of chang, it seems like fernan-
des is the only one that explicitly adds a constraint
for the GM case and gets a perfect mention detec-
tion score. All other systems loose significantly on
recall.

7.3.4 Gold Test Parses
Finally, providing gold parses during testing does

not have much of an impact on the scores.

7.4 All Languages Open
Tables 24, 25 and 26, give the performance for

the systems that participated in the open track. Not
many systems participated in this track, so there is
not a lot to observe. One thing to note is that chen
modified precise constructs sieve to add named en-
tity information in the open track sieve which gave
them a point improvement in performance. With
gold mentions and gold syntax during testing the
chen system performance almost approaches an F-
score of 80 (79.79)

7.5 Headword-based and Genre specific scores
Since last year’s task showed that there was only

some very local difference in ranking between sys-
tems scored using the strict boundaries versus the
ones using headword based scoring, we did not com-
pute the headword based evaluation.

Owing to space constraints, we cannot present a
detailed analysis of the variation across genre. How-
ever, since genre variation is important to note, we
present the performance of the highest performing
system across all the three languages and genres in
Table 23. For each language there are three logical
performance blocks: i) The official, predicted ver-
sion, with no provided boundaries is the first block;
ii) The supplementary version with gold mention
boundaries is the second block; and iii) The third
block shows the performance for the supplementary
version given gold mentions.

Looking at the Engish performance on the official,
closed track, there seems to be a cluster of genre –
BC, BN, NW and WB – where the performance is very
close to a score of 60. Whereas, genres TC, MZ and
PT are increasingly better. Surprisingly, a simplistic
look at the individual metrics does indicate a similar
trend, except for the CEAFe score for the TC and WB
being somewhat reversed. It so happens that these
the two genres — MZ and PT – are professional hu-
man translations from a foreign language. As seen
earlier, there is not a huge shift in performance when
the systems are provided with gold mention bound-
aries. However, when provided with gold mentions
there is a big improvement in performance across
the board. Especially so with MZ genre for which
the improvement is more than double (9.5 points)
over the improvement in PT genre (3.5 points) with
the most notable improvement (of 5 points) in the
CEAFe metric, which also is another indication that
this metric does a good job of rewarding correct
anaphoric mentions.

Looking at the Chinese performance, we see that
the NW genre does particularly worse than all oth-
ers on the official, closed track. The BC genre does
somewhat worse than WB, MZ, and TC all of which
seem to be around the same ballpark, with BN lead-
ing the pack. Again, provided gold mention bound-

Table 23: Per genre performance for fernandes on the closed, official and supplementary evaluations.

aries there is very little or no change in performance.
And, when given the gold mentions the performance
again shoots up by a significant margin. Here again,
we see that the delta improvement in one particu-
lar genre TC – is much higher (12 points) than in
BN (6 points), and once again the most improvement
among all the metrics happens to be for the CEAFe.
Extremely surprising is the fact that the NW genre
shows the lowest improvement among all genre. In
fact, the performance drops for the BCUBED met-
ric. This might have something to do with the fact
that Chinese NW genre gets the lowest ITA among
all other (see Table 1), but then the better scoring TC
genre which has the second lowest ITA does con-
siderably better (leading by roughly 10 points in the
official setting, and 20 points in the gold mentions
settings with respect to the TC genre). It could also
be possible that this has something to do with the
fact (and pointed out earlier when discussing chen’s
results) that there is some overlapping mentions that
were mistakenly included in the release.

As for Arabic, since there was only one NW genre,
there is nothing more to be analyzed. We plan to
report more detailed tables and analysis on the task
webpage.

8 Comparison with CoNLL-2011
Table 27 shows the performance of the systems

on CoNLL-2011 test subset which included only the
English portion of OntoNotes v4.0. For the English
subset, the size of training data in CoNLL-2011
was roughly 76% of CoNLL-2012 training data (1M
vs 1.3M words respectively). Although the mod-
els used to generate this table were trained on the
CoNLL-2012 English data and therefore on about
200K more words, it is still a small fraction of the
total training data. In the past, coreference scores
have shown to asymptote after a small fraction of
the total training data. Therefore, the 5% absolute
gap between the best performing systems of last year
can be attributed to algorithmic improvement, and
possibly better rules. Given that a 200K data addi-
tion to a 1M word corpus is unlikely to help iden-
tify novel rules, and given that björkelund reported
adding (about 160K) development data (to the train-
ing portion) to train the final model had very lit-
tle improvement in performance over using just the
training data by itself, the possibility that the gain
is from algorithmic improvements seems even more
plausible.

It is interesting to note that although the winning

represents our conclusions on reviewing the results:

• Most top performing systems used a hybrid-
approach combining rule-based strategies with
machine learning. Rule-based approach does
seem to bring a system to a close-to-best per-
formance region. The most significant advan-
tage of the rule-based approach seems to be
that it captures most confident links before con-
sidering less confident ones. Discourse infor-
mation when present is quite helpful to disam-
biguate pronominal mentions. Using informa-
tion from appositives and copular constructions
seems beneficial to bridge across various lex-
icalized mentions. It is not clear how much
more can be gained using further strategies.
The features for coreference prediction are cer-
tainly more complex than for many other lan-
guage processing tasks, which makes it more
challenging to generate effective feature com-
binations.
• Most top performing systems did significant

feature engineering – expecially a heavy use of
lexicalized features, which was possible given
the size of the corpus, and performed feature
selection.
• It might be possible that the Chinese accuracy

with gold boundaries and mentions is better be-
cause the distribution of mentions across the
various genres is different, and if there are more
mentions in better scoring genres, then the per-
formance would improve overall.
• Gold parse during testing does seem to help

quite a bit. Gold boundaries are not of much
significance for English and Arabic, but seem
to be very useful for Chinese. The reason prob-
ably has some roots in the parser performance
gap for Chinese.
• It does seem that collecting information about

an entity by merging information across the
various attributes of the mentions that comprise

it can be useful, though not all systems that at-
tempted this achieved a benefit, and has to be
done carefully.

• It is noteworthy that systems did not seem to
attempt the kind of joint inference that could
make use of the full potential of various lay-
ers available in OntoNotes, but this could well
have been owing to the limited time available
for the shared task.

• We had expected to see more attention paid to
event coreference, which is a novel feature in
this data, but again, given the time constraints
and given that events represent only a small
portion of the total, it is not surprising that most
systems chose not to focus on it.

• Scoring coreference seems to remain a signif-
icant challenge. There does not seem to be an
objective way to establish one metric in pref-
erence to another in the absence of a specific
application. On the other hand, the system
rankings do not seem terribly sensitive to the
particular metric chosen. It is interesting that
the CEAFe metric — which tries to capture the
goodness of the entities in the output — seem
much lower than the other metric, though it is
not clear whether that means that our systems
are doing a poor job of creating coherent en-
tities or whether that metric is just especially
harsh.
