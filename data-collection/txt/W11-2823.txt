Abstract

This paper presents an ongoing work about the
implementation of a CCG grammar for Italian
Sign Language. This grammar is part of a gen-
eration system used for Italian-LIS translation.

1 Introduction

Italian Sign Language (Lingua Italiana dei Segni,
henceforth LIS) is the sign language used by the Ital-
ian deaf (signing) community. LIS is a natural lan-
guage that has a specific lexicon, morphology and
syntax (Volterra, 2004). In the last years the com-
putational linguistic community showed a growing
interest toward sign languages (SLs), and a number
of projects concerning the translation into a SL have
recently started. Some of these projects adopt sta-
tistical techniques based on developing parallel cor-
pora: English to Irish SL (Morrissey et al., 2007),
Chinese to Chinese SL (Su and Wu, 2009). Some
other projects adopt symbolic techniques: English to
British SL (Bangham et al., 2000), English to Amer-
ican SL (Zhao et al., 2000; Huenerfauth, 2006). Re-
cently a new project started for automatic translation
from Italian to LIS: in this paper we present some
features of the generation module adopted for the
interlingua translation in this project.

The challenge of Italian-LIS translation depends
on the complexity of the translation task as well
as on the peculiar features of the LIS. Sign lan-
guages mix standard linguistics of vocal languages
with a number of typical phenomena. Among oth-
ers: there is a “spatial organization” of the sentence

that interacts with the word order to determine syn-
tactic/semantic dependencies and plays a role in the
coordination; the presence of many articulators (two
hands, eyebrow, eye gaze, torso etc.) allows for
some form of parallelism; there are no prepositions,
articles; finally, LIS is a poorly studied language and
linguists often do not agree on basic linguistic prop-
erties (e.g. sentence word order). In order to reduce
the difficulties of our ambitious project we concen-
trate on a specific application domain, i.e. weather
forecasts. As starting point, the project is producing
a parallel corpus of Italian-LIS sentence extracted
from TV news and concerning weather forecasts.

Our interlingua1 translation system has four dis-
tinct modules, that are: (1) a dependency parser for
Italian; (2) an ontology based semantic interpreter;
(3) a grammar based generator; (4) a virtual actor
that performs the synthesis of the final LIS sentence.
Here we give some details about the parser and the
semantic interpreter, in the Section 2 we describe the
generator.

In the first step, the syntactic structure of
the source language is produced by the TUP
parser (Lesmo, 2007). It uses a morphological dic-
tionary of Italian (about 25, 000 lemmata) and a
rule-based grammar. The final result is a depen-
dency tree, that makes clear the structural syntac-
tic relationships occurring between the words of the
sentence (Hudson, 1984). Each word in the source
sentence is associated with a node of the tree, and
the nodes are linked via labeled arcs that specify the

1Our system can be defines as a knowledge based restricted
interlingua, since it uses extra-linguistic information and deals
with just two languages (Hutchins and Somer, 1992)

perature superano la media in Puglia e in Sicilia” (The

syntactic role of the dependents with respect to their
head (the parent node). Consider the dependency
tree n Fig. 1: temperatura (temperature) is the sub-
ject of the verb superare (exceed), while media (av-
erage) is the object; the coordinated words Puglia
and Sicilia are modifiers of the verb.

The second step of the translation is the semantic
interpretation: the syntax-semantics interface used
in the interpretation is based on ontologies (Lesmo
et al., 2011a; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004). The
knowledge in the ontology concerns the application
domain, i.e. weather forecasts, as well as more gen-
eral common knowledge about the world. Starting
from the lexical semantics of the words in the sen-
tence and on the basis of the dependency structure,
a recursive function searches in the ontology pro-
viding a number of “connection paths” that repre-
sent the meaning of the sentence. Indeed, the fi-
nal sentence meaning consists of a complex frag-
ment of the ontology: semantic roles and other kind
of semantic relations are contained in this fragment
and could be extracted by translating it into First
Order Logic (FoL) predicates. However, similar to
other approaches (among others (Bunt et al., 2007)),
our ontological meaning representation is unscoped.
In Fig. 2 we report the semantic interpretation of
the sentence “Le temperature superano la media in
Puglia e in Sicilia” in terms of FoL predicates. The
predicate onto expresses the lexical meaning of the
words by using the ontology concepts: it assigns the
concept instances exceed, temperature, average,
Puglia, Sicilia to the FoL variables l1, l2, l3, l4,
l5 respectively. Moreover, onto explicitly denotes
the classes which these instances belong to: meteo-
status is the ontological class of the events regard-

ing the meteo; geo-area is the ontological class of
the geographical areas; eva-entity is the ontologi-
cal class of the evaluable entities. The predicates
event, agent, theme, location express the seman-
tics of the event in terms of predicate-arguments by
using semantic roles (we adopt the set of semantic
roles defined in the LIRICS project (Petukhova and
Bunt, 2008)). Finally, the predicate set expresses a
semantic relation that groups entities: this predicate
allows to specify the cumulative reading, w.r.t. the
distributive reading corresponding to have two not
related locations.

2 A generator for LIS

Natural language generation can be described as a
three steps process: text planning, sentence planning
and realization (Reiterand and Dale, 2000). Text
planning determines which messages to communi-
cate and how to rhetorically structure these mes-
sages; sentence planning converts the text plan into
a number of sentence plans; realization converts the
sentence plans into the final sentences produced.
Anyway, in the context of interlingua translation we
simplify by assuming that generation needs only for
the realization step. Our working hypothesis is that
source and target sentences have as much as possi-
ble the same text and the same sentence plans. This
hypothesis is reasonable in our projects since we are
working on a very peculiar sub-language (weather
forecasts) where the rhetorical structure is usually
very simple.

In our architecture we use the OpenCCG realizer
(White, 2006), an open source tool that has sev-
eral appealing features with respect to our approach.
OpenCCG is based on combinatory categorial gram-
mars (CCG) (Steedman, 2000), a mildly context-

171



sensitive formalism that is theoretically adequate to
describe the complexity of natural language syntax
(e.g. cross-serial dependencies, non-constituency
coordination) and it has a very straight syntax-
semantic interface. Moreover, OpenCCG adheres to
the bidirectional grammar approach, i.e. there is one
grammar for both realisation and parsing. It means
that derivation and generation have the same struc-
ture and that we can develop a grammar by testing
its correctness in realization in terms of parsing: as a
result, we obtain a speed-up in the process of gram-
mar development (White et al., 2010). Realization
usually accounts for a standard number of morpho-
syntactic phenomena, that are inflection, agreement,
word order, function words. LIS has few function
words but, similar to all SLs, it has a peculiar and
rich system of inflection and agreement. OpenCCG
allows to encode an inflectional system by using fea-
ture structures, which are part of the syntactic cat-
egories. The integration in one single elementary
structure of the morphology-syntax-semantic infor-
mation is appealing for sign languages where the
absence of function words increases the importance
of morpho-syntactic features to express the correct
meaning of the sentence. Now we first give some
specifications about the input/output of the generator
(Section 2.1) and secondly we describe the treatment
of some linguistic constructions by using a fragment
of the CCG for LIS (Section 2.2).

Figure 3: The semantic interpretation of the sentence
“Le temperature superano la media in Puglia e in Sicilia”
given in terms Hybrid logic predicates.

The input of the generator, that is the output of the
semantic interpreter, are FoL predicates expressing
a number of distinct semantic relations. Seman-
tic situation type (e.g. event, state), semantic roles
(e.g. agent, location), grouping relations (e.g. set,

sequence), general semantic properties (as tense or
plurality) can be produced by the semantic inter-
preter: we assume that at least semantic roles and
grouping relations are explicitly expressed, as the
interpretation in the Fig. 2. OpenCCG requires se-
mantic interpretation in form of hybrid logic formu-
las, a kind of propositional modal logic that can be
used to represent relational structures (Blackburn,
2000). Since hybrid logic is equivalent to a frag-
ment of FOL, we could rewrite FoL predicates in
terms of hybrid logic: (1) by identifying first or-
der variables with nominal (a new sort of primitive
logic elements which explicitly name the nodes of
the relational structure); (2) by identifying first or-
der predicate (of arity two) with modality label of
hybrid logic (Brauner, 2008). Applying this algo-
rithm to the FoL predicates in Fig. 2 we obtain the
representation in Fig. 3.

Note that we assume a logical interpretation that
does not adhere to the linguistic meaning notion
that is usually adopted in OpenCCG, i.e. Hybrid
Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS) (Baldridge
and Kruijff, 2002). HLDS defines semantic rela-
tions only between words, disallowing the definition
of nominals that do not have a lexical predication
(White, 2006). In contrast, our interpretation func-
tion produces a number of non-lexicalized structures
for specific semantic constructions. One example
is the interpretation of the ordinal numbers: the in-
terpretation of “ultimo giorno del mese” (last day
of the month) is @X0(〈ODI〉X1 ∧ 〈ODRS〉X2 ∧
〈ODS〉X3) ∧ @X1day ∧ @X2month ∧ @X3last
(Lesmo et al., 2011b). In this hybrid formula,
〈ODI〉〈ODRS〉〈ODS〉 are modalities which indi-
cate specific semantic relations2 and X0X1X2X3
are nominals: in this specific case X0 does not have
a lexical predicate.

A challenging requirement of our project is re-
lated to the target language: LIS, as all signed lan-
guages, does not have a natural written form. As a
consequence we developed an artificial written form
for LIS in order to “communicate” the output of
the generator to the virtual interpreter. This writ-
ten form encodes the main morphological features
of the signs as well as a number of non-manual fea-

2〈ODI〉 = Ordinal Description Iterator; 〈ODRS〉 = Ordi-
nal Description Reference Sequence; 〈ODS〉 = Ordinal De-
scription Selector.

tures, as the gaze or the tilt of the head (Zhao et
al., 2000). For sake of clarity we write a LIS sen-
tence just as a sequence of glosses, that is the se-
quence of the names of the signs without represent-
ing any non-manual information. The only feature
that we explicitly represent is the spatial position of
the sign. In this paper we consider just the hori-
zontal dimension in the signing space: we assume
a discrete space of seven positions L1 (the leftmost
position), L2, L3, N (the neutral position), R3, R2,
R1 (the rightmost position).

For signs that have just one articulatory position, we
use the prefix Li (Rj) in the gloss to indicate that a
sign is performed on the left (and on the right) of the
signer. For signs that have two articulatory positions
(starting and ending position), we use the prefix Li
(Rj) in the gloss to indicate that a sign starts on the
left (on the right) of the signer and the suffix Ll (Rm)
in the gloss to indicate that a sign is performed on the
left (and on the right) of the signer.3

names in uppercase for the signs that are related to their rough

2.2 A CCG for LIS

In Tab. 1 we present the fragment of the hand-written
CCG: the grammar is organized in Lexical Cate-
gories and Type-changing rules. Each Lexical Cat-
egory has four fields: LEX, that contains the lexi-
cal form of the item; PoS, that contains the part of
speech category; SynCAT, that contains the syntac-
tic category; SemCAT, that contains the semantic
category. Note that SynCAT e SemCAT are related
by using semantic variables (Xi and Yj in Tab. 1):
these variables appear in the syntactic categories,
but are used as pointers to the semantic categories
(Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002; White, 2006). Some
Lexical Categories which have specific SynCAT-
SemCAT values can change these values by using
the type-changing rules.

The CCG accounts for two specific morpho-
syntactic phenomena: (i) spatial agreement between
verb and its arguments and (ii) NP-coordination.
Similar to American SL in LIS we can tell a num-
ber of verb classes on the basis of spatial accord
(Volterra, 2004; Wright, 2008). For instance the
verb Li SUPERIORE Rj (exceed) belongs to the
class II-A, i.e. it is a transitive verb such that the

Figure 4: The realization/derivation of the LIS sentence “SICILIA R1 PUGLIA R3 TEMPERATURA R2 MEDIA L2
L2 SUPERIORE R2” (for space reasons we do not show the semantics of the derivation).

starting position of the sign (Li) coincides with the
position of the agent, as well as the ending posi-
tion of the sign (Rj) coincides with the position of
the theme (or patient) (Volterra, 2004). Similar to
(Wright, 2008), we model this feature in CCG by
using a morphological feature called ap (articula-
tory position). The ap feature encodes the position
of the noun in the atomic category NP , as well as
the starting and ending position of a verb in the com-
plex category S\NP\NP . NP coordination in LIS
is realized in two distinct ways, i.e. (1.) by signing
the NP in one single position but separating them by
a pause and (2.) by signing the first NP into a partic-
ular position and signing the second NP in a distinct
but related position: in our grammar we developed
only the second option. Our CCG analysis of NP-
coordination uses unary type-change operation and,
in contrast to (Wright, 2008), does not assume a spe-
cific lexical unit that expresses coordination: Wright
models the hand movement as a lexical unit (the
“shift”) that contains the category NP\NP/NP .
In contrast, we give a lexical value to the feature ap:
similar to the CCG analysis of case-based language
(e.g. Japanese, (Steedman, 2000)), we consider the
position as a specific case. In particular, we suppose
that the type-change operation is possible just with
some specific ap values, obtaining a complex cate-
gory for the second NP in the coordination.

In Fig. 4 we report the realization (coincid-
ing with the derivation) of the LIS sentence “SI-
CILIA R1 PUGLIA R3 TEMPERATURA R2 ME-
DIA L2 L2 SUPERIORE R2” based on the lexicon
in Tab. 1, that is the LIS translation of the Italian sen-
tence “Le temperature superano la media in Puglia e
in Sicilia”. In accord to (Geraci, 2004) and in con-
trast with (Volterra, 2004) we assume that LIS re-

spects the SOV order. In the generation, the unifi-
cation mechanism on the feature ap constraints the
NP arguments to accord with the starting and ending
position of the verb: the agent TEMPERATURA is
signed in the position R2, that corresponds to the
starting position of the verb SUPERIORE, while
the theme MEDIA is signed in the position L2,
that correspond to the ending position of the verb.
This mechanism avoids the generation of ungram-
matical derivations as “TEMPERATURA R1 ME-
DIA L2 L2 SUPERIORE R2”, in which the posi-
tions of TEMPERATURA and SUPERIORE do not
agree. Finally note that in the generation we have
two type-change operations. The first one is used
to account for NP coordination, as explained above.
The second type-change is used to transform the NP
into the complex sentence modification category S/
S, since LIS does not have prepositions. Note that
in order to limit over-generation we constrain both
type-changes by using the semantics of the lexical
category by requiring that the semantic ontological
type of the lexical category is a geo-area, i.e. a geo-
graphic area.

3 Conclusion and ongoing work

In this paper we presented the main features of a
generator for LIS. The generator is based on the
OpenCCG tool and relies on a hand encoded CCG
grammar to account for a number of peculiar lin-
guistic phenomena of Sign Languages. Many im-
provements are necessary in order to encode further
syntactic phenomena and to take account for a real-
istic large lexicon. In our opinion a crucial point is
the encoding of topic-comment relations, that seem
to have an important role in the word order of the
LIS sentence.
