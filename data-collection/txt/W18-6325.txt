Abstract

Transfer learning has been proven as an ef-
fective technique for neural machine transla-
tion under low-resource conditions. Exist-
ing methods require a common target lan-
guage, language relatedness, or specific train-
ing tricks and regimes. We present a simple
transfer learning method, where we first train
a “parent” model for a high-resource language
pair and then continue the training on a low-
resource pair only by replacing the training
corpus. This “child” model performs signifi-
cantly better than the baseline trained for low-
resource pair only. We are the first to show
this for targeting different languages, and we
observe the improvements even for unrelated
languages with different alphabets.

1 Introduction

Neural machine translation (NMT) has made a big
leap in performance and became the unquestion-
able winning approach in the past few years (Bah-
danau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Sennrich
et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017). The main rea-
son behind the success of NMT in realistic con-
ditions was the ability to handle large vocabulary
(Sennrich et al., 2016b) and to utilize large mono-
lingual data (Sennrich et al., 2016a). However,
NMT still struggles if the parallel data is insuffi-
cient (e.g. fewer than 1M parallel sentences), pro-
ducing fluent output unrelated to the source and
performing much worse than phrase-based ma-
chine translation (Koehn and Knowles, 2017).

Many strategies have been used in MT in the
past for employing resources from additional lan-
guages, see e.g. Wu and Wang (2007), Nakov and
Ng (2012), El Kholy et al. (2013), or Hoang and
Bojar (2016). For NMT, a particularly promising
approach is transfer learning or “domain adapta-
tion” where the “domains” are the different lan-
guages.

For example, Zoph et al. (2016) train a “par-
ent” model in a high-resource language pair, then
use some of the trained weights as the initializa-
tion for a “child” model and further train it on the
low-resource language pair. In Zoph et al. (2016),
the parent and child pairs shared the target lan-
guage (English) and a number of modifications
of the training process were needed to achieve an
improvement in translation from Hansa, Turkish,
and Uzbek into English with the help of French-
English data.

Nguyen and Chiang (2017) explore a related
scenario where the parent language pair is also
low-resource but it is related to the child language
pair. They improved the previous approach by us-
ing a shared vocabulary of subword units (BPE,
Sennrich et al., 2016b). Additionally, they used
transliteration to improve their results.

In this paper, we contribute empirical evidence
that transfer learning for NMT can be simplified
even further. We leave out the restriction on re-
latedness of the languages and extend the experi-
ments to parent–child pairs where the target lan-
guage changes. Moreover, we do not utilize any
special modifications to the training regime or data
pre-preprocessing.

In contrast to previous work, we test the method
with the Transformer model (Vaswani et al.,
2017), instead of the recurrent approaches (Bah-
danau et al., 2014). As documented in e.g. Popel
and Bojar (2018) and anticipated in WMT18,1 the
Transformer model seems superior to other NMT
approaches.

2 Method Description

The proposed method is extremely simple: We
train the parent language pair for a number of iter-

ations and switch the training corpus to the child
language pair for the rest of the training, without
resetting any of the training (hyper)parameters.

As such, this method is similar to the transfer
learning proposed by Zoph et al. (2016) but uses
the shared vocabulary as in Nguyen and Chiang
(2017). The novelty is that we are removing the
restriction about relatedness of the language pairs,
and in contrast to the previous papers, we show
that this simple style of transfer learning can be
used on both sides (i.e. either the source or the
target language), not only with the target language
common to both parent and child model. In fact,
the method is effective also for fully unrelated lan-
guage pairs.

Our method does not need any modification of
existing NMT frameworks. The only requirement
is to use a shared vocabulary of subword units (we
use wordpieces, Johnson et al., 2017) across both
language pairs. This is achieved by learning word-
piece segmentation from the concatenated source
and target sides of both the parent and child lan-
guage pairs. All other parameters of the model
stay the same as for the standard NMT training.

During the training we first train the NMT
model for the high-resource language pair until
convergence. This model is called “parent”. After
that, we train the child model without any restart,
i.e. only by changing the training corpora to the
low-resource language pair.

2.1 Details on Shared Vocabulary

Current NMT systems use vocabularies of sub-
word units instead of whole words. Using sub-
word units gives a balance between the flexibil-
ity of separate characters and efficiency of whole
words. It solves the out-of-vocabulary words
problem and reduces the vocabulary size. The ma-
jority of NMT systems use either the byte pair en-
coding (Sennrich et al., 2016b) or wordpieces (Wu
et al., 2016). Given a training corpus and the de-
sired maximal vocabulary size, either method pro-
duces deterministic rules for word segmentation to
achieve the fewest possible splits.

Our method requires the vocabulary shared
across both the parent (translating from language
XX to YY) and the child model (translating from
AA to BB). This is obtained by concatenating both
training corpora into one corpus of sentences in
languages AA, BB, XX and YY. 2

2Having separate vocabularies for the parent and child and

Due to our focus on low-resource language
pairs, we decided to generate the vocabulary in
a balanced way by selecting the same amount of
sentences from both language pairs. We thus use
the same number of sentence pairs of the parent
corpus as there are in the child corpus.

We did not experiment with any other balanc-
ing of the vocabulary. Future research could also
investigate the impact of using only the child cor-
pus for vocabulary generation or various amounts
of used sentences.

We generated vocabularies aiming at 32k sub-
word types. The exact size of the vocabulary
varies from 26.1k to 34.8k. All experiments of a
given language set use the same vocabulary. Vo-
cabulary overlap in each language set is further
studied in Section 6.1.

3 Model Description

We use the Transformer sequence-to-sequence
model (Vaswani et al., 2017) as implemented
in Tensor2Tensor (Vaswani et al., 2018) version
1.4.2. Our models are based on the “big single
GPU” configuration as defined in the paper. To fit
the model to our GPUs (NVIDIA GeForce GTX
1080 Ti with 11 GB RAM), we set the batch size
to 2300 tokens and limit sentence length to 100
wordpieces.

We use exponential learning rate decay with the
starting learning rate of 0.2 and 32000 warm up
steps and Adam optimized. In our experiments,
we find that it is undesirable to reset learning rate
as it leads to the loss of the performance from the
parent model. Therefore the transfer learning is
handled only by changing the training corpora and
nothing else.

Decoding uses the beam size of 8 and the length
normalization penalty is set to 1.

The models were trained for 1M steps (approx.
140 hours), which was sufficient for models to
converge to the best performance. We selected the
model with the best performance on the develop-
ment test for the final evaluation on the testset.

4 Datasets

In our experiments, we compare low-resource and
high-resource language pairs spanning two orders

switching from the XX-YY to AA-BB vocabulary when we
switch the training corpus leads on an expected drop in per-
formance. Independent vocabularies use different IDs even
for identical subwords and the network cannot rely on any of
its weights from the parent training.

of magnitude of training data sizes. We consider
Estonian (ET) and Slovak (SK) as low-resource
languages compared to the Finnish (FI) and Czech
(CS) counterparts.

The choice of languages was closely related to
the languages in this year’s WMT 2018 shared
tasks. In particular, Estonian and Finnish (paired
with English) were suggested as the main focus
for their relatedness. We added Czech and Slovak
as another closely related language pair. Russian
(RU) for the parent model was chosen for two rea-
sons: (1) written in Cyrillic, there will be hardly
any intersection in the shared vocabulary with the
child language pairs, and (2) previous work uses
transliteration to handle Russian, which is a nice
contrast to our work. Finally, we added Arabic
(AR), French (FR) and Spanish (ES) for experi-
ments with unrelated languages.

The sizes of the training datasets are in Table 1.
If not specified otherwise we use training, de-

velopment and test sets from WMT.3 Pairs with
training sentences with less than 4 words or more
than 75 words on either the source or the target
side are removed to allow for a speedup of Trans-
former by capping the maximal length and allow-
ing a bigger batch size. The reduction of train-
ing data is small and based on our experiments, it
does not change the performance of the translation
model.

We use the Europarl and Rapid corpora for
Estonian-English. We disregard Paracrawl due to
its noisiness. The development and test sets are
from WMT news 2018.

The Finnish-English was prepared as in Östling
et al. (2017), removing Wikipedia headlines. The

3http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/

dev and test sets are from WMT news 2015.
For English-Czech, we use all paralel data al-

lowed in WMT2018 except Paracrawl. The main
resource is CzEng 1.7 (the filtered version, Bojar
et al., 2016). The devset is WMT newstest2011
and the testset is WMT newstest2017.

Slovak-English uses corpora from Galušcáková
and Bojar (2012), detokenized by Moses.4 WMT
newstest2011 serves as the devset and testset.

The Russian-English training set was created
from News Commentary, Yandex and UN Corpus.
As the devset, we use WMT newstest 2012.

The language pairs Arabic-Russian, French-
Russian, Spanish-French and Spanish-Russian
were selected from UN corpus (Ziemski et al.,
2016), which provides over 10 million multi-
parallel sentences in 6 languages.

5 Results

In this section, we present results of our approach.
Statistical significance of the winner (marked with
‡) is tested by paired bootstrap resampling against
the baseline (child-only) setup (1000 samples,
conf. level 0.05; Koehn, 2004).

As customary, we label the models with the pair
of the source and target language codes, for ex-
ample the English-to-Estonian translation model is
denoted by ENET.

The vocabularies are generated as described in
2.1 separately for each experimented combination
of parent and child. The same vocabulary is used
whenever the parent and child use the same set of
languages, i.e. disregarding the translation direc-
tion and model stage (parent or child).

5.1 English as the Common Language

Table 2 summarizes our results for various combi-
nations of high-resource parent and low-resource
child language pairs when English is shared be-
tween the child and parent either in the encoder or
in the decoder.

We confirm that sharing the target language im-
proves performance as previously shown (Zoph
et al., 2016; Nguyen and Chiang, 2017). This
gains up to 2.44 BLEU absolute for ETEN with
the FIEN parent. Using only the parent (FIEN)
model to translate the child (ETEN) test set gives
a miserable performance, confirming the need for
transfer learning or “finetuning”.

Table 2: Transfer learning with English reused either

“Transfer” is our method, baselines correspond to train-
ing on one of the corpora only. Scores (BLEU) are
always for the child language pair and they are compa-
rable only within lines or when the child language pair
is the same. “Unrelated” language pairs in bold. Up-
per part: parent larger, lower part: child larger. (“EN”
lowercased just to stand out.)

A novel result is that the method works also for
sharing the source language, improving ENET by
up to 2.71 BLEU thanks to ENFI parent.

Furthermore, the improvement is not restricted
only to related languages as Estonian and Finnish
as shown in previous works. Unrelated language
pairs (shown in bold in Table 2) like Czech and
Estonian work too and in some cases even better
than with the related datasets. We reach an im-
provement of 3.38 BLEU for ENET when parent
model was ENCS, compared to improvement of
2.71 from ENFI parent. This statistically signifi-
cant improvement contradicts Dabre et al. (2017)
who concluded that the more related the languages
are, the better transfer learning works. We see it as
an indication that the size of the parent training set
is more important than relatedness of languages.

The results with Russian parent for Estonian
child (both directions) show that transliteration is
also not necessary. Because there is no vocab-
ulary sharing between Russian Cyrilic and Esto-
nian Latin (except numbers and punctuation, see
Section 6.1 for further details), the improvement
could be attributed to a better coverage of English;
an effect similar to domain adaptation.

On the other hand, this transfer learning works
well only when the parent has more training data
than the child. As presented in the bottom part of
Table 2, low-resource parents do not generally im-
prove the performance of better-resourced childs
and sometimes, they even (significantly) decrease

duced ENET data.

it. This is another indication, that the most impor-
tant is the size of the parent corpus compared to
the child one.

The baselines are either models trained purely
on the child parallel data or only on the parent
data. The second baseline only indicates the relat-
edness of languages because it is only tested but
never trained on the child language pair. Also, we
do not add any language tag as in Johnson et al.
(2017). This also highlights that the improvement
of our method cannot be directly attributed to the
relatedness of languages: e.g. Czech and Slo-
vak are much more similar than Czech and Es-
tonian (Parent Only BLEU of translation out of
English is 6.51 compared to 1.42) and yet the
gain from transfer learning is larger for Estonian
(+3.38) than from Slovak (+1.62).

5.2 Simulated Very Low Resources

In Table 3, we simulate very low-resource settings
by downscaling the data for the child model. It
is a common knowledge, that gains from transfer
learning are more pronounced for smaller childs.
The point of Table 3 is to illustrate that our ap-
proach is applicable even to extremely small child
setups, with as few as 10k sentence pairs. Our
transfer learning (“start with a model for what-
ever parent pair”) may thus resolve the issue of
applicability of NMT for low resource languages
as pointed out by Koehn and Knowles (2017).

5.3 Parent Convergence

Figure 1 compares the performance of the child
model when trained from various training stages
of the parent model. The performance of the child
clearly correlates with the performance of the par-
ent. Therefore, it is better to use a parent model
that already converged and reached its best perfor-
mance.

“Aligned” is the more natural setup with English ap-
pearing on the “correct” side of the parent, the numbers
in this column thus correspond to those in Table 2.

5.4 Direction Swap in Parent and Child

Relaxing the setup in Section 5.1, we now allow a
mismatch in translation direction of the parent and
child. The parent XX-EN is thus followed by an
EN-YY child or vice versa. It is important to note
that Transformer shares word embeddings for the
source and target side. The gain can be thus due to
better English word embeddings, but definitely not
due to a better English language model. It would
be interesting to study the effect of not sharing the
embeddings but we leave it for some future work.

The results in Table 4 document that an im-
provement can be reached even when none of the
involved languages is reused on the same side.
This interesting result should be studied in more

detail. Firat et al. (2016) hinted possible gains
even when both languages are distinct from the
low-resource languages but in a multilingual set-
ting. Not surprisingly, the improvements are better
when the common language is aligned.

The bottom part of Table 4 shows a particu-
larly interesting trick: the parent is not any high-
resource pair but the very same EN-ET corpus
with source and target swapped. We see gains
in both directions, although not always statisti-
cally significant. Future work should investigate if
this performance boost is possible even for high-
resource languages. Similar behavior has been
shown in Niu et al. (2018), where in contrast to
our work they mixed the data together and added
an artificial token indicating the target language.

5.5 No Language in Common

Our final set of experiments examines the perfor-
mance of ETEN child trained off parents in totally
unrelated language pairs. Without any common
language, the gains cannot be attributed, e.g., to
the shared English word embeddings. The vocab-
ulary overlap is mostly due to short n-grams or
numbers and punctuations.

We see gains from transfer learning in all cases,
mostly significant. The only non-significant gain
is from Arabic-Russian which does not share the
script with the child Latin at all. (Sharing of
punctuation and numbers is possible across all the
tested scripts.) The gains are quite similar (+0.49–
+0.78 BLEU), supporting our assumption that the
main factor is the size of the parent (here, all have
10M sentence pairs) rather than language related-
ness.

6 Analysis

Here we provide a rather initial analysis of the
sources of the gains.

6.1 Vocabulary Overlap

jointly from the child and parent model. In Trans-

former, the vocabulary is even shared across en-
coder and decoder. With a large overlap, we could
expect a lot of “information reuse” between the
parent and the child.

Since the subword vocabulary depends on the
training corpora, a little clarification is needed.
We take the vocabulary of subword units as cre-
ated e.g. for ENRU-ENET experiments, see Sec-
tion 2.1. This vocabulary contains 28.2k subwords
in total. We then process the training corpora for
each of the languages with this shared vocabulary,
ignore all subwords that appear less than 10 times
in each of the languages (these subwords will have
little to no impact on the result of the training) and
break down the total 28.2k subwords into classes
depending on the languages in which the particu-
lar subword was observed, see Table 6.

We see that the vocabulary is reasonably bal-
anced, with each language having 20–30% of sub-
words unique to it. English and Estonian share
10% subwords not seen in Russian while Russian
shares only 0–1.39% of subwords with each of the
other languages. Overall 8.89% of subwords are
seen in all three languages.

A particularly interesting subset is the one
where parent languages help the child model, in
other words subwords appearing anywhere in En-
glish and also tokens common to Estonian and
Russian. For this set of languages, this amounts
to 20.69+10.06+1.39+0.0+8.89 = 41.03%. We list
this number on a separate line in Table 6, “From
parent”. These subwords get their embeddings
trained better thanks to the parent model.

Table 7 summarizes this analysis for several lan-
guage sets, listing what portion of subwords is
unique to individual languages in the set, what
portion is shared by all the languages and what
portion of subwords benefits from the parent train-
ing. We see a similar picture across the board, only
AR-RU-ET-EN stands out with the very low num-

ber of subwords (6.2%) available already in the
parent. The parent AR-RU thus offered very lit-
tle word knowledge to the child and yet lead to a
gain in BLEU.

6.2 Output Analysis

Since we rely on automatic analysis, we need to
prevent some potential overestimations of trans-
lation quality due to BLEU. For this, we took a
closer look at the baseline ENET model (BLEU
of 17.03 in Table 2) and two ENET childs derived
from ENCS (BLEU of 20.41) and ENRU parent
(BLEU 20.09).

Table 8 confirms the improvements are not an
artifact of uncased BLEU. The gains are apparent
with several (now cased) automatic scores.

As documented in Table 9, the improved out-
puts are considerably longer. In the table, we show
also individual n-gram precisions and brevity
penalty (BP) of BLEU. The longer output clearly
helps to reduce the incurred BP but the improve-
ments are also apparent in n-gram precisions.
In other words, the observed gain cannot be at-
tributed solely to producing longer outputs.

Table 10 explains the gains in unigram preci-
sions by checking which tokens in the improved
outputs (the parent followed by the child) were
present also in the baseline (child-only, denoted
“b” in Table 10) and/or confirmed by the refer-
ence (denoted “r”). We see that about 44+20% of
tokens of improved outputs can be seen as “un-
changed” compared to the baseline because they
appear already in the baseline output (“b”). (The

Table 10: Comparison of improved outputs vs. the
baseline and reference.

44% “rb” tokens are actually confirmed by the ref-
erence.)

The differing tokens are more interesting: “-”
denotes the cases when the improved system pro-
duced something different from the baseline and
also from the reference. Gains in BLEU are due to
“r” tokens, i.e. tokens only in the improved out-
puts and the reference but not the baseline “b”.
For both parent setups, there are about 9–9.7 %
of such tokens. We looked at these 3.2k and 3.5k
tokens and we have to conclude that these are reg-
ular Estonian words; no Czech or Russian leaks to
the output and the gains are not due to simple to-
ken types common to all the languages (punctua-
tion, numbers or named entities). We see identical
BLEU gains even if we remove all such simple to-
kens from the candidates and references. A better
explanation of the gains thus still has to be sought
for.

7 Related Work

Firat et al. (2016) propose multi-way multi-lingual
systems, with the main goal of reducing the to-
tal number of parameters needed to cater multiple
source and target languages. To keep all the lan-
guage pairs “active” in the model, a special train-
ing schedule is needed. Otherwise, catastrophic
forgetting would remove the ability to translate
among the languages trained earlier.

Johnson et al. (2017) is another multi-lingual
approach: all translation pairs are simply used at
once and the desired target language is indicated
with a special token at the end of the source side.
The model implicitly learns translation between

many languages and it can even translate among
language pairs never seen together.

Lack of parallel data can be tackled by unsu-
pervised translation (Artetxe et al., 2018; Lample
et al., 2018). The general idea is to mix monolin-
gual training of autoencoders for the source and
target languages with translation trained on data
translated by the previous iteration of the system.

When no parallel data are available, the train-
set of closely related high-resource pair can be
used with transliteration approach as described in
Karakanta et al. (2018).

Aside from the common back-translation (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016a; Kocmi et al., 2018), simple
copying of target monolingual data back to source
(Currey et al., 2017) has been also shown to im-
prove translation quality in low-data conditions.

Similar to transfer learning is also curriculum
learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Kocmi and Bojar,
2017), where the training data are ordered from
foreign out-of-domain to the in-domain training
examples.

8 Conclusion

We presented a simple method for transfer learn-
ing in neural machine translation based on train-
ing a parent high-resource pair followed a low-
resource language pair dataset. The method works
for shared source or target side as well as for lan-
guage pairs that do not share any of the translation
sides. We observe gains also from totally unre-
lated language pairs, although not always signifi-
cant.

One interesting trick we propose for low-
resource languages is to start training in the oppo-
site direction and swap to the main one afterwards.

The reasons for the gains are yet to be explained
in detail but our observations indicate that the key
factor is the size of the parent corpus rather than
e.g. vocabulary overlaps.
