Abstract

Certain phenomena of interest to linguists
mainly occur in low-resource languages, such
as contact-induced language change. We show
that it is possible to study contact-induced
language change computationally in a histor-
ical variety of a low-resource language, Early-
Modern Frisian, by creating a model using
features that were established to be relevant
in a closely related language, modern Dutch.
This allows us to test two hypotheses on two
types of language contact that may have taken
place between Frisian and Dutch during this
time. Our model shows that Frisian verb clus-
ter word orders are associated with different
context features than Dutch verb orders, sup-
porting the ‘learned borrowing’ hypothesis.

1 Introduction

If we want to use computational methods to answer
linguistic research questions, a major restriction is
that the data-driven methods that are popular in
natural language processing today are only appli-
cable to a tiny part of the world’s language vari-
eties. Last decade, it was estimated that significant
computational resources were available for “per-
haps 20 or 30 languages” (Maxwell and Hughes,
2006). Efforts to address this have been proposed,
such as the Human Language Project (Abney and
Bird, 2010), and to a limited degree executed (i.e.
the Universal Dependencies project, Nivre et al.,
2016 or SeedLing, Emerson et al., 2014). However,
the reality is still that relatively few languages are
being studied using quantitative methods. Many
phenomena that are of interest to linguists do not
occur in these 20 or 30 languages, of which the
larger available corpora mainly contain modern
standard varieties in common registers and within
easily recorded domains of language.

Specifically, certain phenomena of interest to
linguists are characteristic of minority languages,

which are by definition used less, and are less likely
to have computational resources available. For ex-
ample, in cases of language contact where there is
a majority language and a lesser used language,
contact-induced language change is more likely
to occur in the lesser used language (Weinreich,
1979). Furthermore, certain phenomena are better
studied in historical varieties of languages. Taking
the example of language change, it is more interest-
ing to study a specific language change once it has
already been completed, such that one can study
the change itself in historical texts as well as the
subsequent outcome of the change.

For these reasons, contact-induced language
change is difficult to study computationally, and
we consider it a great test case for applying some
insights from the recent wave of articles dis-
cussing computational linguistics for low-resource
languages. In this work, we apply computational
methods, to the extent that it is possible, to gain
insight into the nature of language change that oc-
curred in historical West-Frisian, a lesser-used lan-
guage spoken in the Dutch province of Fryslân.

2 Case study

Our case study of language change focuses on
word order changes in the verbal cluster. This phe-
nomenon has been studied thoroughly in the larger
West-Germanic languages such as Dutch (Coussé,
2008; Coupé, 2015), but not the smaller Frisian lan-
guage1, which has been in extensive contact with
Dutch for most of its history, continuing up to the
present (Breuker, 1993; Ytsma, 1995). This gives
us a good basis for comparison. While Frisian is a
lesser-used language, its historical data is excep-
tionally well-accessible: all known West-Frisian

1In this article, we will use the term Frisian to refer to the
West-Frisian language (Westerlauwers Fries), as opposed to
Saterland Frisian or North Frisian, or the West-Frisian dialect
of Dutch.

texts written until 1800 are digitally available.
In Frisian, when there are two verbs in a clus-

ter (an auxiliary verb and a main verb), the norma-
tive word order is the one in example 1 below, as
prescribed in the reference grammar of Popkema
(2006). However, both logically possible orders are
being used in present-day Frisian:

(1) Anne
Anne

had

‘Anne said that he had seen me’

(2) Anne
Anne

sei
said

dat
that

er
he

my
me

hie
had

sjoen.
seen

‘Anne said that he had seen me’

Example 1 shows the 2-1 order, so called be-
cause the syntactically higher head verb (referred
to as 1) comes after the lower lexical verb (2). Ex-
ample 2 shows the opposite 1-2 order. The present-
day use of the 1-2 order appears to be recent, and in-
fluenced by language contact with Dutch (de Haan,
1996). It has even been found that Frisian bilingual
children have similar word order preferences in
their Frisian as in their Dutch (Meyer et al., 2015).
However, the non-normative 1-2 order also appears
in older sources: in Early-Modern texts, Hoekstra
(2012) found 10% 1-2 orders, and noted that the
1-2 ordered clusters exhibit some Dutch-like prop-
erties that do not occur in 2-1 ordered clusters, sug-
gesting a contact effect during this time period.

A particularly interesting Middle Frisian set of
texts with regards to language contact are the Basle
Wedding Speeches, notable for mixing in Middle
Low German and Middle Dutch forms (Buma,
1957): a clear case of ‘contact’ Middle Frisian.
Two conflicting hypotheses have been proposed in
the literature regarding the nature of this language
contact. (Bremmer, 1997, p. 383) argues that the
writer was a bilingual with “a full command nei-
ther of Frisian nor Low German, certainly not in
his writing, nor in all likelihood in his spoken us-
age”. This type of contact may have resulted in this
mixed-language text. Blom (2008, p. 21) instead
proposes the existence of a shared written register
in which using borrowed forms was normal: au-
thors of the time show familiarity with texts written
in Middle Dutch and Middle Low German, which
may have influenced their written Frisian. These
two proposals correspond to two kinds of language
change that have been distinguished in the litera-
ture: change from below and change from above
(Labov, 1965, 1994). Furthermore, they correspond

to two types of language acquisition: early acquisi-
tion and late acquisition (Weerman, 2011). These
theories make different usage predictions that al-
low us to identify which of the two hypotheses is
more plausible:

1. Variation in Early-Modern Frisian texts is due
to contact through bilingualism, with early ac-
quisition of the optionality, based on Brem-
mer (1997) and like the present-day situation
(de Haan, 1996).

2. Variation in Early-Modern Frisian texts is due
to learned borrowing, with late acquisition of
the optionality, based on Blom (2008).

To test these hypotheses, we compare features
of verb clusters in Early-Modern Frisian texts to
those in modern Dutch, as those have been stud-
ied thoroughly (De Sutter, 2009; Meyer and Weer-
man, 2016; Bloem et al., 2014; Augustinus, 2015;
Hendriks, 2018). We are particularly interested in
the contexts in which the ‘Dutch’ 1-2 cluster order
is used in the Frisian corpus. Specifically, we test
whether the Frisian 1-2 orders occur in the same
contexts as modern Dutch 1-2 orders to see what
type of contact is responsible for them. It has been
argued that verb cluster order variation in Dutch
has the function of facilitating sentence process-
ing: the verb cluster order that is ‘easier’ or more
economical in a particular context is used (De Sut-
ter, 2009; Bloem et al., 2017). By studying whether
the variation in the Frisian texts is predicted by the
same features as the variation in modern Dutch,
we can infer whether Early-Modern Frisian verb
cluster order variation has the same functions as
modern Dutch verb cluster order variation.

If Early-Modern Frisian 1-2 order clusters occur
in similar contexts as modern Dutch clusters in the
1-2 order this would indicate that this order has the
same function in both varieties, and is part of the
grammar of the writer of the Early-Modern Frisian
text. This can mean two things: Firstly, it could be
the case that the order is used in the same way as its
modern Dutch counterpart. This supports the idea
that ‘contact through bilingualism’ is the source of
the variation: hypothesis 1. If the contexts of use
are not similar between Early-Modern Frisian and
modern Dutch, this means it is likely that the 1-2 or-
der has been borrowed in some way, but with a dif-
ferent function than the function it has in modern
Dutch. In this case, learned borrowing would be the



267

source of the variation: this would support hypoth-
esis 2. There is a third option, which is that these
1-2 orders are not due to contact, but for Early-
Modern Frisian we will skip over this possibility
with reference to the contact evidence found by
Hoekstra (2012). In future work, a study of older
Frisian texts is needed to investigate whether this
non-contact hypothesis is plausible for older stages
of Frisian.

3 Task description

Our task is to test the aforementioned two hy-
potheses by taking a model that shows what fea-
tures are associated with the Dutch 1-2 order, and
then creating a model from Frisian data based
on those features. We first identify a suitable
data source containing sufficiently annotated Early-
Modern Frisian text. We then operationalize the rel-
evant verb cluster features (as modelled for Dutch,
Bloem et al., 2014) in terms of the annotation.
Next, we automatically identify and extract verb
clusters and their relevant features from the data.
Lastly, we identify the features that are associated
with the Dutch-like 1-2 order in the Frisian data,
and compare them to those that are associated with
the 1-2 order in Dutch. For reasons of comparabil-
ity, we use logistic regression to identify the fea-
tures, a method commonly used in quantitative lin-
guistics (Speelman, 2014) and in the studies on
Dutch verb clusters that we use as a basis for com-
parison (De Sutter, 2009; Bloem et al., 2014).

Our approach of taking a case study that is
well-studied in a related language is inspired by
cross-lingual learning in NLP: in studies involv-
ing low-resource languages, closely related lan-
guages that are more rich in resources are used
as a source of additional data. Examples of this
are cross-language parse tree projection (Xia and
Lewis, 2007), where structural information about a
sentence in one language is transferred to parallel
data in another language, and data point selection
(Søgaard, 2011), where a tool for a low-resource
language is trained on data from a high-resource
language, while selecting the data that is most sim-
ilar to the low-resource language. In both of these
cases, general knowledge about a language family
is also transferred to a low-resource language.

Frisian language resources When working
with a low-resource language, a brief overview of
the available resources for that language can be
helpful. Most Frisian resources are of the tradi-

tional kind. The Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal, a
dictionary that has been in development since 1984,
currently contains about 115.000 lemmas (Sijens
and Depuydt, 2010), and has an online version2.
Frisian grammar has been studied since at least the
start of the 20th century (Collitz, 1915), leading to
collections of linguistic studies such as Hoekstra
et al. (2010). Its minority language status has been
researched as well (Ytsma, 1995; Breuker, 2001;
de Graaf et al., 2015).

As for digital resources, the Fryske Akademy
is working on the Frisian Integrated Language
Database3 (Taaldatabank, TDB). This corpus con-
tains all of the attested Frisian texts from the years
1550-1800 and is planned to include modern ma-
terial. The Early-Modern Frisian texts have been
tokenized, lemmatized and part-of-speech tagged
manually. The Fryske Akademy is also compil-
ing a Corpus of Spoken Frisian4 for the purpose
of developing speech technology. The aforemen-
tioned dictionary is also included in a digitalization
effort of Dutch historical dictionaries (Duijff and
Kuip, 2018), forming a bilingual lexical-semantic
database. A parallel corpus with aligned sentences
from the Fryske Akademy exists5.

Besides spell-checking, the only available NLP
tools appear to be the statistical machine trans-
lation system by van Gompel et al. (2014) and
two text-to-speech systems: one using an existing
Dutch text-to-speech system (Dijkstra et al., 2004)
and one using a bilingual system capable of han-
dling code-switching between Dutch and Frisian
(Yılmaz et al., 2016). While there is a part-of-
speech tagger for historical (Middle) Low German
(Koleva et al., 2017), a related low-resource lan-
guage, none are available for historical or modern
Frisian, and neither are syntactic parsers.

The TDB corpus is the most relevant resource
for the present study, as it contains annotated Early-
Modern Frisian texts. The size of this section of
the corpus is around 480,000 tokens and 20,000
types, though this includes repeated text and non-
contemporaneous front/back matter. After select-
ing representative texts without duplicate material
or non-Frisian material, we obtain a subcorpus con-

taining 125,842 tokens and 10,405 types. Unfortu-
nately, no tools are available for further annotation
that would be relevant for word order phenomena.

4 Experiments

We automatically annotate verb clusters and extract
their features from the corpus using a Python script
that detects verb clusters based on the information
already available in the annotation. In previous
work on Dutch, verb clusters were defined using
dependency structure or phrase structure, with one
verb being the syntactic head of the other (Bloem
et al., 2014; Augustinus, 2015). However, as no
syntactic annotation is available, we must rely on
part-of-speech tags. As there is no gold standard
data for this task, and little data in general, a sta-
tistical modeling approach is infeasible. Therefore,
the script is rule-based, and we define a verb clus-
ter based on the occurrence of bigrams of verbs
(according to the existing annotation), or trigrams
containing grammatical verb cluster interruptions,
as well as the verb classes in the annotation. The
word order of the verb cluster is then determined
based on the relative positions of its constituent
verbs (a main verb and an auxiliary verb) in the
linear order of the sentence. This procedure is not
100% reliable, especially in clusters with infiniti-
val auxiliary verbs, where auxiliary verbs and main
verbs may have the same form.

We checked the classification of a random sam-
ple of 50 1-2 order clusters and 50 2-1 order clus-
ters, using only prose text for this evaluation be-
cause the script appears to make more mistakes
there. We evaluate only for precision, not for recall,
as we have no gold standard data for evaluating re-
call. Of the 50 automatically extracted candidate
1-2 clusters, 34 were found to be actual two-verb
clusters from subordinate clauses: a precision of
68%. Of the 50 2-1 clusters, all 50 met this require-
ment (100% precision). Most of the erroneous can-
didate 1-2 order clusters were cases of a finite aux-
iliary verb in V2 position in a main clause, imme-
diately followed by the main verb in final position,
with no intervening objects. This looks exactly like
a 1-2 order cluster consisting of a finite auxiliary
verb and a main verb at the end of a subordinate
clause. Main clause clusters cannot look like 2-1
order clusters, which explains the 100% precision
for the 2-1 order. This evaluation shows that a sta-
tistical model based on this annotation is likely to
overestimate the probability of 1-2 orders.

Due to annotation limitations, several features
from Bloem et al.’s (2014) Dutch model could
not be extracted from our corpus: the tree depth
of the verb cluster, the definiteness of the preced-
ing noun, extraposition of the prepositional object,
multiword units and the length of the clause. Verb
frequency was estimated by counting over the en-
tire Early-Modern Frisian part of the TDB. An-
other factor is that Dutch 1-2 orders have a more
uniform information density (Bloem, 2016). This
was found by training a n-gram language model
on Dutch corpus data, and then measuring its per-
plexity over sentences containing verb clusters that
were not in its training data. A 145 million word
corpus was used for this, but for Early-Modern
Frisian we have less than 0.5 million words avail-
able. A model trained on such diverse texts span-
ning hundreds of years would require more train-
ing data to achieve reasonable perplexity rates than
a model trained on newspaper text from a small
range of years, thus we cannot reliably operational-
ize this factor. However, the Dutch result is likely
to apply to Frisian as well, as the reasons for the
perplexity values that were found for Dutch can
equally apply to Frisian: in both languages, there
are few clustering auxiliary verbs and many pos-
sible main verbs, and in both languages, the first
verb of a cluster helps to predict its second verb
and is highly unlikely to be followed by something
that is not a verb, as verb cluster interruption rarely
occurs in present-day Frisian (Barbiers et al., 2008,
p. 25–41). The main difference between the lan-
guages in this regard is that present-day Frisian
shows more noun incorporation into the verb clus-
ter’s main verb (Dyk, 1997), which may increase
informativity of the main verb compared to Dutch
in 1-2 orders, but seems rare. Therefore, we can
transfer the knowledge gained with a Dutch lan-
guage model to Frisian and assume that there is
not much difference between the languages regard-
ing verb cluster information density.

Next, we have created a multifactorial logistic
regression model using the remaining features. We
model verb cluster order as a binary variable pre-
dicted by these features, in which the order can be
1-2 or 2-1. The advantage of this method over neu-
ral networks or other methods involving dimension
reduction is that the contribution of each feature is
transparent. The goal is after all not to make an
optimal classifier for 1-2 and 2-1 order contexts,
but to find out more about why language users pro-



269

duced a 1-2 or 2-1 order given a context. Table 1
shows the contribution of each feature to the model.
The effect size of each variable is given as an odds
ratio, and in line with previous work, we are report-
ing associations with the 1-2 order. The model has
acceptable multicollinearity (VIF < 1.3)6. The text
type and year features were not used in previous
work, but are necessary control factors when work-
ing with historical text. Much of the text is rhyme,
which affects word order: 1-2 orders are estimated
to be 18.69 times more likely in rhyming text.

Feature Odds ratio
Text type +Rhyme *** 18.69
Text year 0.99
Auxiliary verb +Modal 1.19
Auxiliary verb +Future 0.98
Auxiliary verb +Aspectual ** 7.15
Auxiliary verb +Copula ** 7.88
Auxiliary verb +Past *** 2.50
To-infinitival verb *** 8.33
Priming +1-2 0.95
Separable verb 0.64
Information value +High 0.91
Information value +Medium *** 0.24
Verb log frequency 0.96

Table 1: Effect of different features on the likelihood of
1-2 verbal cluster orders. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

Of the auxiliary verb features, modal is the most
important feature in Dutch, with an odds ratio of
148 (Bloem et al., 2014), while our model shows no
evidence for an effect. We find an association be-
tween copular verbs and the 2-1 order, while Dutch
shows the reverse — a difference that supports
Hypothesis 2, the learned borrowing hypothesis.
The aspectual and to-infinitival effects we found
are consistent with Hoekstra’s (2012) observations,
who shows that no equivalent construction existed
in Frisian, making these easy candidates for bor-
rowing, along with the Dutch word order.

Other factors from the Dutch model are not
significant in this model (priming, separable, fre-
quency) and are all related to complexity (Bloem,
2016). The information value feature has opposite
associations compared to the Dutch model. Thus,
the model shows evidence for only some of the
features from the Dutch model. Under Hypothe-

6Variable Inflation Factor (VIF) quantifies linear depen-
dence of a feature on other features. With VIF = 1.3, the
variance of a feature is inflated by 30% due to collinearity.

sis 1, we would expect significant effects here —
use of 1-2 orders in contexts that are more diffi-
cult to process, as in Dutch (Bloem et al., 2017).
Instead, the only significant features are associated
with borrowed constructions, or are significant in
the opposite direction as in Dutch and therefore
associated with the other word order. These clear
usage differences support hypothesis 2: the 1-2 or-
ders appeared due to learned borrowing, and un-
like in Dutch, did not have a clear function besides
stylistic marking (i.e. in rhymed text). Unfortu-
nately a direct, number by number comparison to
the Dutch model is not possible due to different cat-
egories (i.e. for the types of auxiliary verbs), stem-
ming from different corpus annotation schemes
used for the Dutch and Frisian data. Furthermore,
the numbers cannot be compared directly because
both models include different features.

5 Conclusion

Our study has shown that it is possible to apply
computational methods to a historical variety of
a lesser used language. We investigated a case
of contact-induced change, a phenomenon that is
mainly found in low-resource languages, and were
able to test hypotheses regarding the nature of
this change. In doing so, we made use of what
is known about the construction in a closely re-
lated but higher-resourced language, Dutch. This
allowed us to limit the hypothesis space, reducing
the problem to a comparison with Dutch and test-
ing whether features that model the observed varia-
tion in Dutch, are also relevant in Frisian, although
the limited availability of data and annotation did
not allow us to test all features. There was also
not enough data to train a language model for esti-
mating complexity through model perplexity. Nev-
ertheless, by combining findings from our Frisian
data and from previous studies on Dutch, we are
able to get a good impression of the origin of the
1-2 order construction in Early-Modern Frisian.

As verb cluster order variation is a probabilistic
phenomenon that is affected by multiple factors,
we could not have found the verb cluster usage pat-
terns described here without making use of com-
putational models. Even when little data is avail-
able, computational methods can help supplement
other types of evidence in historical linguistics, par-
ticularly on research questions involving variation,
complexity and other matters that go beyond gram-
maticality versus ungrammaticality.
