Abstract

Historical change typically is the result of com-
plex interactions between several linguistic
factors. Identifying the relevant factors and un-
derstanding how they interact across the tem-
poral dimension is the core remit of historical
linguistics. With respect to corpus work, this
entails a separate annotation, extraction and
painstaking pair-wise comparison of the rele-
vant bits of information. This paper presents a
significant extension of HistoBankVis, a multi-
layer visualization system which allows a fast
and interactive exploration of complex linguis-
tic data. Linguistic factors can be understood
as data dimensions which show complex in-
terrelationships. We model these relationships
with the Parallel Sets technique. We demon-
strate the powerful potential of this technique
by applying the system to understanding the
interaction of case, grammatical relations and
word order in the history of Icelandic.

1 Introduction

Historical linguistic research is corpus-based by na-
ture. In recent years, a large amount of digitized
and linguistically well-annotated corpora have been
made available and the historical linguistic research
community is increasingly employing quantitative
and statistical methods for their analysis. This in-
cludes the calculation of co-occurrence frequen-
cies, correlations, dispersion statistics, and more
sophisticated methods such as clustering (see, e.g.,
Hilpert and Gries, 2016). Statistical measurements
are well-established for the analysis of linguistic
change with respect to the quantification of individ-
ual structures. However, these methods are not per
se suitable for the uncovering and understanding of
the complex interactions between various linguis-
tic structures typically involved in a change.

This paper extends our HistoBankVis system
(Schätzle et al. 2017) by a powerful visualization to

analyze and explore the interrelationship between
multidimensional linguistic factors. HistoBankVis
was specifically developed for the analysis of histor-
ical linguistic data. The system allows for an inter-
active exploratory access to a complex data set by
using several interlinked visualization and filtering
techniques. The extension presented in this paper
integrates a Dimension Interaction visualization,
based on the Parallel Sets technique (Bendix et al.,
2005; Kosara et al., 2006), into the HistoBankVis
system. Parallel Sets support the flexible analysis,
visual presentation, and exploration of correlations
between a large number of features from different
data dimensions, i.e., linguistic factors, which im-
mensely facilitates the analysis of interactions be-
tween features from changing dimensions.

We demonstrate the efficacy of the Dimension In-
teraction technique for historical linguistic research
using a concrete case study which investigates in-
terrelations between word order changes and sub-
ject case in Icelandic. The visualization not only
proved to be an extremely valuable tool for the ana-
lysis of complex interactions across different data
dimensions, but also facilitated the uncovering of
previously unknown interdependencies in the data.

2 Challenges for Diachronic Linguistics

More and more digitized text corpora have been
made available for historical linguistic research in
recent years. These comprise large linguistically
unannotated collections of historical texts, e.g., the
Bibliotheca Augustana,1 TITUS2 and GRETIL,3

but also increasingly include annotated corpora.
Annotated corpora are usually smaller in size

and have undergone a manual annotation process
in addition to an automatic preprocessing. The

manual annotation procedure allows for a linguisti-
cally sophisticated annotation which often includes
a deep syntactic analysis of hierarchies and depen-
dencies between phrase structure constituents. Pro-
totypically, such structural information is annotated
in the Penn Treebank-style (Marcus et al., 1993).
Examples are the Penn Parsed Corpora of Histori-
cal English (Kroch and Taylor, 2000; Kroch et al.,
2004, 2010), the Icelandic Parsed Historical Cor-
pus (IcePaHC, Wallenberg et al., 2011), the He-
liand Parsed Database (Walkden, 2015), the Latin
Dependency Treebank (Bamman and Cane, 2006),
the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajič, 1998),
and PROIEL (Haug and Jøhndal, 2008).

The standard procedure within diachronic cor-
pus linguistics incorporates the use of program-
ming languages for text processing and statistical
analysis, e.g., Python, Perl, and R (Baayen, 2008;
Bird et al., 2009; Christiansen et al., 2012), to ex-
tract the relevant patterns on the basis of the anno-
tation and to calculate co-occurrence frequencies
and statistical significances across different time
stages. A multitude of high-dimensional data ta-
bles containing different features and data charac-
teristics are generated. For example, Table 1 repre-
sents a prototypical historical linguistic data set.

Finding significant patterns and feature interac-
tions across such tables is by no means a trivial
task, as a temporal component not only has to be
factored in, but numbers computed for several fea-
tures belonging to different data dimensions need
to be compared across many data tables of varying
size. Moreover, statistical significances are diffi-
cult to interpret and often calculated on the basis of
only very few occurrences of the actual observation,
derogating the significance measures and statistical
conclusions. Thus, meaningful patterns may not be
identified, whereas irrelevant patterns are likely to
surface as significant. Interesting patterns may fur-
thermore stay hidden when an analyst chooses tem-

poral episodes that are either too coarse or too fine
grained for the statistical analysis. The factors caus-
ing a language to change are often unknown or at
least highly debated among researchers. Therefore,
a researcher may have to conduct several different
analyses, experimenting with different combina-
tions of data dimensions. This is time-consuming
and the resulting data is difficult to navigate.

HistoBankVis addresses these challenges by pro-
viding an exploratory access to a high-dimensional
data set by means of different visualization layers
combined with a structured statistical analysis. The
system is part of on-going work which investigates
visualization possibilities and the needs of histori-
cal linguistic data stored in treebanks.

3 HistoBankVis: a multilayer
visualization system

As part of our on-going work, we developed His-
toBankVis, a visualization system originally de-
signed for the investigation of syntactic change in
Icelandic based on IcePaHC (see Schätzle et al.
2017 for details). The tool is an online browser
app and publicly available.4 HistoBankVis requires
well-structured, tabular datasets in the csv-format
as input. Thus, corpus data needs to be processed
by extracting linguistic factors relevant for the re-
search task, usually identified by consulting the the-
oretical literature. HistoBankVis stores these fac-
tors as data dimensions in an SQL database, with
the corresponding values referred to as features.

The user can filter for a subset of the data, specif-
ically for dimensions and features from particular
time periods. Before visualizing the historical de-
velopments of the selected data dimensions, the re-
searcher has to define time periods for the temporal
comparison, either by specifying them manually or
by selecting predefined periods.

Figure 1: Compact matrix visualization showing sta-
tistically significant differences between data distribu-
tions from different time periods.

The original HistoBankVis version (Schätzle
et al., 2017) has two main visualization compo-
nents, the Compact Matrix and the Difference His-
tograms Visualization. Both visualizations allow
researchers to interactively compare the distribu-
tions of selected features and dimensions of the
filtered sentences across time periods on different
granularity levels. The compact matrix visualizes
differences between the selected data dimensions
across time stages. Each row and column repre-
sents one period as shown in Figure 1. The differ-
ences are measured by χ2-tests or Euclidean dis-
tances and represented by color. The matrix is a
useful means to show differences among all time
period combinations.

Difference histograms provide a more nuanced
view on the diachrony of individual features and
dimensions. The difference histograms visualize
each time period as one composed bar chart, see
Figure 2. For each time period, the dimensions are
encoded via different colors and can be inspected
in parallel. The bar height corresponds to the per-
centage of sentences containing a given feature in
the respective time period. To facilitate the compar-
ison of periods, we show the difference between
the distributions of two neighbouring time periods
with a separate bar chart below each feature bar. A
green bar indicates that a feature increased com-
pared to the previous period and red indicates that
the feature decreased. For example, in Figure 2,
SVO1 (Subject-Verb-Direct Object) word order in-
creases, while VSO1 (Verb-Subject-Direct Object)
decreases.

While the matrix and the histograms allow for
the exploration of differences between linguistic
factors across different time periods, the represen-
tations lack a perpendicular comparison of interac-
tions between different factors to correlate, e.g., the
occurrence of a particular type of subject case with
the observed word order variation. That is, while it

subject case and word order pre- and post-1900.

is clear that most of the subjects have nominative
case (sbj_NOM) in Figure 2, one cannot correlate
this information directly with word order: the ques-
tion of which attested word order possibilities the
subjects appear in must be tackled in a different
way. To this end, we extended HistoBankVis with
a visualization of dimension interactions.

4 Dimension Interaction Visualization

To provide insights into the interrelation between
multiple features of different dimensions, we ex-
tended the HistoBankVis system by a Dimension
Interaction visualization, based on the Parallel Sets
technique (Bendix et al., 2005; Kosara et al., 2006).
Parallel Sets extend the idea of Parallel Coordinates
(PC; Inselberg 1985, 2009) to a frequency-based
representation of categorical data dimensions.

PC represent relations between individual data
points from a multidimensional data set on a 2D
plane by visualizing each dimension along a ver-
tical axis with the related features of the dimen-
sions being connected by a polyline. This allows
to identify both relationships between data points
and neighboring dimensions. Structured Parallel
Coordinates (Culy et al., 2011), a specialized ver-
sion of PC for the analysis of linguistic data, have
been used to analyze word co-occurrences (Culy
et al., 2011) and to investigate meanings of modal
verbs within historical academic discourse (Lyding
et al., 2012). Moreover, the diachronlex diagrams
by Theron and Fontanillo (2015) which track the
evolution of meanings as represented in historical
dictionaries make use of PC.

Parallel Sets visualize the frequency of each fea-
ture as proportions of equally spaced vertical lines
(data dimensions). In this way, Parallel Sets al-
low for the sophisticated investigation of interac-
tions between features from different data dimen-
sions, whereas PC only allow for the analysis of co-
occurrence frequencies of specific features. For ex-

der in dative subject sentences from 1750–1899.

ample in Figure 3, the interactions between the di-
mensions voice and word order are visualized. The
dimensions are connected by colored ribbons. The
size of a ribbon indicates the share which a feature
holds of a feature from another dimension from left
to right, allowing for the investigation of interac-
tions between the features. In Figure 3, active con-
structions occur most often with VSO1, while mid-
dles are mostly SVO1.

In our Parallel Sets implementation, dimensions
can be reordered via drag&drop, allowing for a
flexible investigation of different types of interac-
tions.5 To provide a better overview, the features
on each dimension axis can be sorted according to
their size or alphabetically. Additionally, details
of a feature correspondence can be accessed via
mouse interaction techniques, see Figure 3.

To our knowledge, Parallel Sets have not yet
been used in the context of linguistic research. In
this paper, we show that our implementation of
Parallel Sets, i.e., the dimension interaction visual-
ization, is an extremely effective and powerful de-
vice for historical linguistic research as it fosters
the identification and understanding of interactions
between a variety of features contained in a multi-
dimensional data set.

5 Tracking Syntactic Change

In the visualization community, the general prac-
tice is to use case studies to evaluate the usefulness
of a visualization with regard to whether significant
and novel insights about the data could be yielded
(Carpendale, 2008; Isenberg et al., 2013). This sec-
tion presents a case study which shows how His-
toBankVis can be employed for the flexible inves-
tigation of syntactic change in Icelandic, focusing
on the interaction between subject case and word
order. Previous studies (e.g., Rögnvaldsson, 1996;

5This is based on Jason Davies’ work: https://www.
jasondavies.com/parallel-sets/.

Barðdal, 2011) that investigate changes with re-
spect to these phenomena do not factor in poten-
tial interactions between the changes. By visualiz-
ing the data, we found that the two phenomena are
closely interlinked.

Overview and Differences. We first looked at
the diachronic development of word order in tran-
sitive sentences, i.e., sentences containing a sub-
ject (S), a finite verb (V), and a direct object (O1),
vis-á-vis subject case (nominative, accusative, da-
tive, or genitive) via the difference histograms. The
compact matrix visualization showed at-a-glance
that the distribution of word order and subject case
changes significantly as of 1900, see Figure 1. Fig-
ure 2 provides the difference histogram distribu-
tions for subject case and word order in the pe-
riods before and after 1900. The most striking
change with respect to word order is that SVO1 is
increasing in the period from 1900–2008 (green
bar), whereas VSO1 is decreasing concomitantly
(red bar). At the same time, dative subjects increase
slightly. The question is whether these two devel-
opments are linked to one another.

Dimension Interactions. The dimension interac-
tion visualization allows for a detailed view of cor-
relations between the features of each selected data
dimension in order to investigate potential interac-
tions. Figure 4 shows the dimension interaction
for subject case and word order in the period 1900–
2008 in the upper right corner. Both dimensions
have been sorted according to the size of their fea-
tures, with the largest feature displayed at the bot-
tom. The shares of the subject cases on the left are
mapped onto the shares they hold of the word or-
ders on the right. The dimension interaction shows
that SVO1 is the most prominent word order over-
all. The large majority of nominatives occur to-
gether with SVO1, while the share of SVO1 of the
dative subjects is considerably smaller.

The patterns observed in the period from 1900 to
2008 differ from the interactions in an earlier time
period (1150–1350), compare the top right with
the top left of Figure 4. In contrast to the period
post-1900, the shares of SVO1 and VSO1 are about
equal for nominative subjects. Additionally, dative
subjects occur most frequently with VSO1. Thus,
word order develops differently with respect to sub-
ject case over time. The difference histograms in
Figure 2 indicated that subjects are increasingly re-
alized preverbally, the dimension interaction shows

that dative subjects lag behind this development.

It is well-known that voice influences the occur-
rence of dative subjects in Icelandic (e.g., Zaenen
et al., 1985; Sigurðsson, 1989). However, whether
there is an actual correlation between voice, sub-
ject case and word order has not yet been investi-
gated. This can be accomplished easily with the
help of HistoBankVis since we can simply inte-
grate the dimension voice for an analysis of the di-
mension interactions between subject case, word
order and voice, cf. Figure 4-bottom-left for the pe-
riod 1900–2008. The dimension interactions show
that SVO1 occurs most often with nominative sub-
jects in active constructions. With dative subjects
though, SVO1 order mainly occurs in middle con-
structions. A separate analysis of the interaction
between voice and word order for dative subjects
allows for a more nuanced look at interactions, see
Figure 4-bottom-right (1900–2008). Dative sub-
jects occur most frequently with middle voice and
SVO1 is the most prominent word order for both,
active and middle constructions. However, in ear-
lier stages of the language, word order and voice
pattern differently, see Figure 3 for the dimension
interaction from 1750 to 1899. First, dative sub-
jects occurred most often in active clauses and not
with middles. Moreover, SVO1 is already the dom-
inant word order for middle forms, but not for the
active constructions in which VSO1 prevails.

Concluding, these findings indicate that the in-
creasing realization of dative subjects in before the
verb correlates with an increasing use of dative sub-

jects together with middle voice. With the aid of
HistoBankVis, in particular the dimension interac-
tions, we were able to easily identify a previously
unknown link between word order, dative subjects
and voice in a matter of minutes.

6 Conclusion

HistoBankVis serves as an efficient and powerful
tool for historical linguistic investigations as it pro-
vides multiple perspectives of the data at different
levels of detail on demand, fostering an iterative
process of hypothesis testing and generation. In
particular, we introduced the use of Parallel Sets to
provide an interactive visualization of complex in-
teractions across different dimensions of data. To
our knowledge, this is the first use of Parallel Sets
in a linguistic visualization.

We illustrated the flexibility and strength of His-
toBankVis on the basis of a concrete case study
which investigated changing linguistic features in
Icelandic. We demonstrated that our system can
yield new insights and we have shown that the anal-
ysis of dimension interactions as provided by the
extended system represents an effective new means
for historical linguistic research.
