Abstract

We extend the well-known word analogy task
to a one-to-X formulation, including one-to-
none cases, when no correct answer exists.
The task is cast as a relation discovery prob-
lem and applied to historical armed conflicts
datasets, attempting to predict new relations
of type ‘location:armed-group’ based on data
about past events. As the source of semantic
information, we use diachronic word embed-
ding models trained on English news texts. A
simple technique to improve diachronic per-
formance in such task is demonstrated, using
a threshold based on a function of cosine dis-
tance to decrease the number of false positives;
this approach is shown to be beneficial on two
different corpora. Finally, we publish a ready-
to-use test set for one-to-X analogy evaluation
on historical armed conflicts data.

Performance on the task of analogical infer-
ence (or ‘word analogies’) is one of the most
widespread means to evaluate distributional word
representation models, with ‘KING is to QUEEN
as MAN is to ? (WOMAN)’ being a famous example.
It also has deep connections to the relational simi-
larity task (Jurgens et al., 2012). Most often, ana-
logical inference is formulated as a strict propor-
tion, and the model has to provide exactly one best
answer for each question (assuming that it is im-
possible that, e.g., WOMAN and GIRL are equally
correct answers for the question above).

We reformulate the analogical inference task
and extend it to include multiple-ended or one-to-
X relations: one-to-one, one-to-many and one-to-
none cases when an entity is not included in this
particular relation type, so there is no correct an-
swer for it. This way, the model has to provide as
many correct answers as possible, while providing
as few incorrect answers as possible. More for-
mally, the task is as follows: for a given vocabu-
lary V , a relation of a type z, and an entity x ∈ V ,

identify any pairs x; i ∈ V such that z holds be-
tween x and i. Note that this task has been tack-
led in NLP using a number of methods, and not
necessarily using analogical reasoning; however,
in this work we employ a supervised approach im-
plying learning from ‘example’ or ‘prototypical’
pairs (similar to analogies). Our method also does
not require providing i candidates: they are in-
ferred automatically from an embedding model.

Proper analogy test sets are difficult to com-
pile, especially when the complex structure de-
scribed above is desired. Thus, we limit ourselves
to one particular type of semantic relations, on
which objective data can be gathered from extra-
linguistic sources: those between a geographi-
cal location (country) and an insurgent group in-
volved in an armed conflict against the govern-
ment of the country in a given time period. We use
the historical armed conflicts data provided pub-
licly by the UCDP project (Gleditsch et al., 2002).
These datasets contain the needed relations: sev-
eral armed groups can operate in one location, one
group can operate in several locations, and obvi-
ously some locations lack any insurgents to speak
of. At the same time, news corpora contain a lot
of information about armed conflicts, while be-
ing comparatively easy to obtain and train distri-
butional word embedding models on.

Since the UCDP data provides exact dates for
all the conflicts, we cast our one-to-X analogical
reasoning task in a diachronic setup. We attempt
to find out whether a distributional vector space
retains enough structure to trace the relation after
the model was additionally trained with a compa-
rable amount of new in-domain texts created in the
subsequent time period.

The contributions of this work are: (1) We re-
formulate the well-known word analogy task such
that multiple correct answers or no correct an-
swer at all become possible (one-to-X relations).



197

(2) We process historical armed conflicts data and
present it as a ready-to-use evaluation set. (3) Re-
lying on and partially reproducing the workflow
from prior publications, we investigate whether
word embedding models are able to solve one-to-X
analogies diachronically. (4) Finally, we show that
our learned cosine threshold approach can signif-
icantly improve the temporal one-to-X analogies
performance by filtering out false positives.

1 Related work

The issue of linguistic regularity manifested in
relational similarity has been studied for a long
time. Due to the long-standing criticism of strictly
binary relation structure, SemEval-2012 offered
the task to detect the degree of relational similar-
ity (Jurgens et al., 2012). This means that mul-
tiple correct answers exist, but they should be
ranked differently. Somewhat similar improve-
ments to the well-known word analogies dataset
from (Mikolov et al., 2013b) were presented in the
BATS analogy test set (Gladkova et al., 2016), also
featuring multiple correct answers.1 Our One-to-X
analogy setup extends this by introducing the pos-
sibility of the correct answer being ’None’. In the
cases when correct answers exist, they are equally
ranked, but their number can be different.

Using distributional word representations to
trace diachronic semantic shifts (including those
reflecting social and cultural events) has received
substantial attention in the recent years. Our work
shares some of the workflow with Kutuzov et al.
(2017). They used a supervised approach to ana-
logical reasoning, applying ‘semantic directions’
learned on the previous year’s armed conflicts data
to the subsequent year. We extend their research
by significantly reformulating the analogy task,
making it more realistic, and finding ways to cope
with false positives (insurgent armed groups pre-
dicted for locations where no armed conflicts are
registered this year). In comparison to their work,
we also use newer and larger corpora of news texts
and the most recent version of the UCDP dataset.
For brevity, we do not describe the emerging field
of diachronic word embeddings in details, refer-
ring the interested readers to the recent surveys of
Kutuzov et al. (2018) and Tang (2018).

with word embeddings in general in (Rogers et al., 2017).

2 Learning the armed conflict projection

We rely on the idea that knowing the gold Loca-
tion: Insurgent pairs from a time period n can help
us to retrieve the correct pairs bearing the same
relation from the next time period n + 1, using
word embedding models trained incrementally2

on these time periods. The models are trained us-
ing the CBOW algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013b),
and the time periods are yearly subsections of En-
glish news corpora (see § 3). A yearly model is
saved after the training for a particular year is fin-
ished, for later usage.

We deal with pairs of consequent years (‘2010–
2011’, ‘2011–2012’, etc.). Our aim is to predict
armed conflicts (or their absence) for a fixed set of
locations in the year n+1. Having the gold armed
conflict data for all years, we can train a predic-
tor on the 1st year, and then evaluate it on the 2nd

one (simulating a real-world scenario where new
textual data arrive regularly, but gold annotation is
available only for older data). We take the gold
Location: Insurgent pairs from the year n (as a
rule, there are several dozens of them) and their
vector representations from the corresponding em-
bedding model Mn. Then, these vector pairs are
used to train a linear projection T ∈ Rp×d, where
p is the number of pairs, and d is the vector size of
the embedding model used.

Linguistically, T can be seen as defining a ‘pro-
totypical armed conflict relation’; geometrically, it
can be thought of as the average ‘direction’ from
locations to their active insurgent groups in theMn
vector space 3. The problem of finding the optimal
T boils down to a linear regression which mini-
mizes the error in transforming one set of vectors
into another, and we do it by solving d determin-
istic normal equations (since the number of data
points is small, the operation is fast).

After T is at hand, one can find the ‘armed con-
flict projection’ vector î for any location vector
v in Mn+1 by transforming it with the learned
matrix: î = v · T . In the simplest case, the
word with the highest cosine similarity to î in
Mn+1 is assumed to be a candidate for an insur-

2The model Mn+1 is initialized with the weights from the
model Mn; if there are new words in the n + 1 data which
exceed the frequency threshold, then at the start of Mn+1
training they are added to it and assigned random vectors.

3A similar approach has been used for naive translation
of words from the language L1 to L2 by using monolingual
word embeddings for both and a seed bilingual dictionary (set
of one-to-one pairs) (Mikolov et al., 2013a).

gent armed group active in this location in the time
period n + 1; however, a more involved approach
is needed to handle cases when the number of in-
surgents (correct answers) can be different from 1
(including 0), described below. For this workflow
to yield meaningful results, it is essential for the
paired models to be ‘aligned’. This is why we train
the models incrementally, thus ensuring that they
share common structural properties. Another pos-
sible way to cope with this is by using the orthog-
onal Procrustes alignment (Hamilton et al., 2016).

3 Datasets

Corpora for embeddings We train embeddings
on two corpora: (1) The Gigaword news corpus
(Parker et al., 2011), spanning 1995–2010 and
containing about 300M words per year, with about
4.8 billion total. This corpus was used in (Kutu-
zov et al., 2017) and we include it for compari-
son purposes. (2) The News on Web (NOW) cor-
pus,4 spanning 2010–2019. As the UCDP dataset
covers conflicts only up to 2017, we use the texts
up to that year, yielding on average 730M words
per year, with about 5.9 billion total. The time-
annotated texts are crawled from online magazines
and newspapers in 20 English-speaking countries.

Before training the embedding models, the
corpora were lemmatized and PoS-tagged us-
ing UDPipe 2.3 English-LinES tagger (Straka
and Straková, 2017) (during the evaluation,
PoS tags were stripped and words lower-cased).
Chains of consecutive proper names agreeing
in number (‘South_PROPN Sudan_PROPN’)
were merged together with a special character
(‘South::Sudan_PROPN’). This was impor-
tant to handle multi-word location and insurgent
names. Functional words were removed.

Conflict relation data The armed conflict data
comes from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict
Dataset5 (ver. 18.1) (Pettersson and Eck, 2018).
It is manually annotated with historical informa-
tion on armed conflicts across the world, starting
from 1946, where at least one party is the govern-
ment of a state, and frequently used in statistical
conflict research.

The dataset contains various metadata, but
we kept only the years, the names of the loca-
tions, and the names of the armed groups (e.g.,
‘2016: Afghanistan: ["Taliban",

"Islamic State"]’). Entities occurring
less than 25 times in the corresponding yearly
corpora were filtered out, since it is difficult
for distributional models to learn meaningful
embeddings for such rare words.

We create one such conflict relation dataset for
each news corpus; one corresponding to the time
span of NOW and another for Gigaword. Table 1
shows various statistics across these UCDP sub-
sets, including the important ‘new pairs share’ pa-
rameter, showing what part of the conflict pairs in
the years n + 1 was not seen in the years n (how
much new data to guess).

The NoW dataset features 102 unique Location:
Insurgent pairs, with 42 unique locations and 78
unique armed groups. On average, each year 56%
of these 42 locations were involved in armed con-
flicts, based on the UCDP data. The remaining
(different each year) serve as ‘negative examples’
to test the ability of our approach to detect cases
when no predictions have to be made. For the ar-
eas involved in conflicts, the average number of
active insurgents per location is about 1.5, with the
maximum number being 56.

A replication experiment In Table 2 we repli-
cate the experiments from (Kutuzov et al., 2017)
on both sets. It follows their evaluation scheme,
where only the presence of the correct armed
group name in the k nearest neighbours of the î
mattered, and only conflict areas were present in
the yearly test sets. Essentially, it measures the re-
call @k, without penalizing the models for yield-
ing incorrect answers along with the correct ones,
and never asking questions having no correct an-
swer at all (e.g., peaceful locations). The perfor-
mance is very similar on both sets, ensuring that
the NOW set conveys the same signal as the Gi-
gaword set; however, in the next section we make

schema to the one-to-X scenario described above.

4 Evaluation setup

In our workflow, each yearly test set contains all
locations, but whether a particular location is as-
sociated with any armed groups, can vary from
year to year. Conceptually, the task of the model
is to predict correct sets of active armed groups
for conflict locations and to predict the empty set
for peaceful locations. For a test year, an ‘armed
conflict projection’ î is produced for each location
using the learned transformation Tn. The k near-
est neighbors of î in Mn+1 become armed group
candidates (k is a hyperparameter). We calculate
the number of true positives (correctly predicted
armed groups), false positives (incorrectly pre-
dicted armed groups), and false negatives (armed
groups present in the gold data, but not predicted
by the system). These counts are accumulated
and for each year standard precision, recall and F1
score are calculated. These metrics are then aver-
aged across all years in the test set. Using false
negatives ensures that we penalize the systems for
yielding predictions for peaceful locations.

4.1 Cosine threshold

It is clear that such a system (dubbed ‘baseline’)
will always yield k incorrect candidates for peace-
ful areas. Inspired partially by the ideas from Or-
likowski et al. (2018), we implemented a simple
approach based on the assumption that the correct
armed groups vectors will tend to be closer to the î
point than other nearest neighbours. Thus, the sys-
tem should pick only the candidates located within
a hypersphere of a pre-defined radius r centered
around î. rn can be different for different years,
and we infer it from the p training conflict pairs
from the previous year by calculating the average
cosine distance between the ‘armed conflict pro-
jections’ î and armed groups:

where gp is the armed group in the pth pair, and σ
is one standard deviation of the cosine distances in
p. The hypersphere serves as a cosine threshold.

This allows us to keep only the candidates
which are not farther from î than the armed groups
in the previous year tended to be. Figure 1 shows
a PCA projection of predicting armed groups for
Algeria in 2014. With k = 3, the system initially
yielded 3 candidates (‘AQIM’, ‘Al-Qaida’
and ‘Maghreb’), with only the first being cor-
rect. The red circle is a part of the hypersphere in-
ferred from the 2013 training data. It filters out the
wrong candidates (in black), since the cosine dis-
tance from the conflict projection (in blue) to their
embeddings is higher than the inferred threshold.

5 Experiments

For the experiments, we chose k = 2, to be closer
to the average number of armed groups per loca-
tion in our sets. Table 3 shows the diachronic per-
formance of our system in the setup when the ma-
trix Tn and the threshold rn are applied to the year
n+ 1.

For both Gigaword and NOW datasets (and
the corresponding embeddings), using the cosine-
based threshold decreases recall and increases pre-
cision (differences are statistically significant with
t-test, p < 0.05). At the same time, the integral

metrics of F1 consistently improves (p < 0.01).
Thus, the thresholding reduces prediction noise
in the one-to-X analogy task without sacrificing
too many correct answers. In our particular case,
this helps to more precisely detect events of armed
conflicts termination (where no insurgents should
be predicted for a location), not only their start.

As a sanity check, we also evaluated it syn-
chronically, that is when Tn and rn are tested on
the locations from the same year (including peace-
ful ones). In this easier setup, we observed exactly
the same trends (Table 4).

6 Conclusion

We presented a new one-to-X word analogy task
formulation, applying it to the problem of tempo-
ral armed conflicts detection based on word em-
bedding models trained on English news texts. A
historical armed conflicts test set was prepared for
evaluation of diachronic word embedding models.
We also showed that a simple thresholding tech-
nique based on a function of cosine distance al-
lows us to significantly improve the relation detec-
tion performance, especially for reducing the num-
ber of false positives. This approach outperformed
the baseline both with the corpora used in the prior
work (Gigaword) and with the NOW corpus which
to the best of our knowledge was not used for di-
achronic semantic shifts research before.

Our future plans include using negative sam-
pling when calculating optimal projections, along
with testing recent diachronic modeling algo-
rithms representing time as a continuous variable
(Rosenfeld and Erk, 2018). Another interesting is-
sue is how to avoid catastrophic forgetting when
training embeddings incrementally (semantic re-
lation structures tend to completely change after
significant updates).

embeddings are available at https:
