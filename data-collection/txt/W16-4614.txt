Abstract

This paper illustrates the similarity between Thai and Laotian, and between Malay and Indone-
sian, based on an investigation on raw parallel data from Asian Language Treebank. The cross-
lingual similarity is investigated and demonstrated on metrics of correspondence and order of to-
kens, based on several standard statistical machine translation techniques. The similarity shown
in this study suggests a possibility on harmonious annotation and processing of the language
pairs in future development.

1 Introduction

Research and technique development of natural languages processing (NLP) on many understudied and
low-resource Southeast Asian languages are launched in recent years. Some attempts on transferring
available techniques on a well-developed language to an understudied language have been proved ef-
ficient (Ding et al., 2014). However, such a research direction must be established on an a priori ob-
servation on the similarity between languages. Generally, linguistically oriented issues, i.e., etymology,
vocabulary, or syntactic structure, are discussed when two (or more) languages are referred to as “similar
to each other”. In engineering practice, however, statistical metrics, i.e., word alignment precision, or
word order differences, are more addressed in NLP applications.

In this study, we focus on two Southeast Asian languages pairs, Thai-Laotian and Malay-Indonesian.
Both language pairs have mutual intelligibility to a certain extend in spoken form. We conducted a data-
driven investigation of the language pairs, trying to figure out the similarity from an engineering view-
point, which can provide a basis of further NLP techniques development on these languages. The Asian
Language Treebank (ALT)1 (Utiyama and Sumita, 2015; Riza et al., 2016), containing approximately
20, 000 parallel sentence pairs on several Asian languages, facilitates statistical approaches. Specifically,
we conducted word aligning on the two language pairs to find out the accordance on token-level, and
translation experiments to find out the accordance on sentence-level. The experimental results reveal
that the similarity on Thai-Laotian pair is nearly as same as that of Japanese-Korean, i.e., an extremely
similar East Asian language pair; for the case of Malay-Indonesian, they are extremely similar to each
other that basically they can be considered as two registers of one language. Based on the observation,
we think the Thai-Laotian and Malay-Indonesian pairs can be handled simultaneously and harmoniously
in further research, including corpus annotation, technique development, and NLP applications.

The remaining of the paper is arranged as following. In section 2, we introduce the background of the
languages discussed in this paper. In section 3, we describe the experiment settings used and discuss the
numerical results obtained. Section 4 concludes the paper and provides our future work.

2 Background

Specific approaches to process similar languages is an interesting topic in NLP (Vilar et al., 2007; Ding
et al., 2015). In this research direction, a priori knowledge of the languages is required and specific
approaches can thus be designed by taking advantage of the similarities to outperform a general approach.
Here we provide outlines of linguistic features of the four languages mentioned in this paper.

Thai and Laotian are both tonal languages from the Tai-Kadai language family. Spoken Thai and
Laotian are mutually intelligible. The two languages share a large amount of etymologically related
words and have similar head-initial syntactic structures. Both the languages are written with abugida
scripts, slightly different from each other but linguistically similar. A Thai-Laotian example is shown
in the left part of Fig. 1. The alignment of tokens is generated by the approach mentioned in the next
section. It can be observed the similarity in the shape of certain tokens.

Malay and Indonesian are both from the Austronesian languages family, applying Latin alphabet in
their writing systems. Actually, Indonesian can be considered as a standardized register of Malay. The
two languages are also mutually intelligible, with several difference in orthography, pronunciation, and
vocabulary. The right part in Fig. 1 is an example on the Malay-Indonesian pair, where the expressions
are actually identical.

3 Investigation

3.1 Data

We used the parallel raw sentences of corresponding languages from the ALT data. There are 20, 106
sentences in total, which is not a huge size, but a valuable parallel data set. As the Malay and Indonesian
use Latin alphabet in their writing systems, the pre-processing of them is relatively simple, we applied
naı̈ve tokenization to detach the punctuation marks and lowercasing all the letters. The abugida writing
systems of Thai and Laotian are more problematic. As we did not have available tokenization tools for
the two languages, we segmented the sentences of the two languages into unbreakable writing units for
experiments. Specifically, standalone consonant letters with dependent diacritics2 attached to them are
segmented and taken as tokens. The western name entities in sentences were also lowercased.

For the following alignment-based analysis, all the 20, 106 sentences were used as training data for
unsupervised word aligning. For the statistical machine translation experiments, the last 2, 000 to 1, 000
sentences were left out as the development set and the last 1, 000 sentences were reserved for test. As
the corpus is not large, the aim of the translation experiments is not a pursuit of high performance, but to
provide evidence for the similarity of the languages. Statistics of the data we used is list in Table 1.

3.2 Alignment-Based Analysis

We used GIZA++3 (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003) to align all the 20, 106 tokenized sentences
for the two language pairs. Based on the aligned results, we investigate (1) token orders by Kendall’s τ
and (2) varieties in token accordance by entropies.

The Kendall’s τ was calculated according to several previous work (Isozaki et al., 2012), which mainly
focused on the difficulties in word reordering in SMT. The distribution of Kendall’s τ is illustrated in Figs.
2 and 3 on the two languages pairs. The Thai-Laotian pair shows a relative similar order with an average

τ around 0.71, and the Malay-Indonesian pair shows an extremely identical order that the average τ is as
high as 0.98. These evidences demonstrated the similarity in token orders on the two language pairs.

The statistics on token-level entropy are shown from Fig. 4 to Fig. 9, where Figs. 6 and 7 are
based on the patent data from WAT2015’s Japanese-Korean task (Nakazawa et al., 2015), shown here for
comparison. The entropies were calculated by the lexical translation probabilities from grow-diag-final-
and symmetrized word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003). Tokens of punctuation marks and numbers are
not included in these figures. Generally, the entropies observed in Thai-Laotian and Malay-Indonesian
are not large, which suggests the varieties are not large in token corresponding.4 The scatter plots on
Japanese and Korean seem more similar to Thai and Laotian rather than Malay and Indonesian, because
the statistics of Japanese and Korean are based on characters, which are smaller units than words as the
units used of Thai and Laotian. From the Thai-Laotian pairs, a relative clear tendency can be observed
that tokens with very high and very low probabilities have lower entropies in translation. This phenomena
is reasonable, because a large portion of vocabulary of the two languages are etymologically related, as
well as their syntactic structures. So, common tokens may be aligned well by the similarity in syntax
and rare tokens may be aligned well by the similarity in vocabulary. The tendency on Malay-Indonesian
is not as obvious as that on Thai-Laotian. A reason is that the vocabulary size is much larger on the
Malay-Indonesian pair than the number of unbreakable unit types on the Thai-Laotian pair, which may
decrease the precision of alignment on the small training set.

3.3 Translation-Based Analysis
We used the phrase-based (PB) SMT in MOSES5 (Koehn et al., 2007) for the translation experiments.
Default setting were applied except for the Thai-Laotian pair the maximum phrase length was set to nine
due to the tokens are over-segmented. SRILM6 was use to train a 5-gram language model (LM) for the
Malay-Indonesian pair and a 9-gram LM for the Thai-Laotian pair. Modified Kneser-Ney interpolation
(Chen and Goodman, 1996) was applied for the LMs. We tested different distortion-limit (DL) in exper-
iments to check the requirement of reordering process in translation. The test set BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) and RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010) are listed in Table 2.

From the evaluation, it can be observed the absolute BLEU scores are not quite high, i.e., between
30 and 40, compared with the performance on Japanese-Korean task in WAT2015, which achieved over
70 in terms of BLEU. Generally, the data we used for the experiment is quite limited for statistical
model training. Furthermore, as the sentences in different languages are translated from original English
articles, the quality between specific language pairs may affected. On the other hand, we observed two
phenomena from the translation evaluation. One is the RIBES meets the Kendall’d τ quite well, to
show that reordering is not a serious problem in the translation. A further evidence is that the distortion
limit did not affect the performance much. This feature is quite like those observed in Japanese-Korean
pair. Based on the observation, we consider the Thai-Laotian and Malay-Indonesian have considerable
similarities, even from the observation on the relatively small data set.

4 Conclude and Future Work

This paper illustrates the similarity between Thai and Laotian, and between Malay and Indonesian, based
on the ALT data. The similarity shown in this study suggests a possibility on harmonious annotation and
processing of the language pairs in our further annotated corpus construction based on the ALT data.
