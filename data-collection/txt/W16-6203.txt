Abstract

Depression is a major threat to public health,
accounting for almost 12% of all disabilities
and claiming the life of 1 out of 5 patients
suffering from it. Since depression is often
signaled by decreasing social interaction, we
explored how analysis of online health forums
may help identify such episodes. We collected
posts and replies from users of several forums
on healthboards.com and analyzed changes
in their use of language and activity levels over
time. We found that users in the Depression fo-
rum use fewer social words, and have some re-
vealing phrases associated with their last posts
(e.g., cut myself ). Our models based on these
findings achieved 94 F1 for detecting users
who will withdraw from a Depression forum
by the end of a 1-year observation period.

1 Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, 30.8%
of all years lived with disability (YLDs) are due to
mental and neurological conditions (WHO, 2001).
Among these conditions, depression alone accounts
for a staggering 11.9% of all the disability. The
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Fac-
tors Study estimated that depression is responsible for
4.4% of the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)
lost, and if the demographic and epidemiological
transition trends continue, by the year 2020 depres-
sion will be the second leading cause of DALYs lost,
behind only ischaemic heart disease (WHO, 2003).

Although depression carries a significant amount
of the total burden of all the diseases, this is not its
most tragic outcome. Depression claims the lives of

15-20% of all its patients through suicide (Goodwin
and Jamison, 1990), one of the most common yet
avoidable outcomes of this disorder. Early detection
of depression has been a topic of interest among
researchers for some time now (Halfin, 2007), but
the cost of detection or diagnosis is extremely high,
as 30% of world governments who provide primary
health care services do not have this type of program
(Detels, 2009), and these diagnoses are done based
on patients’ self-reported experiences and surveys.

Social media offers an additional avenue to search
for solutions to this problem. Posts, comments, or
replies on different social media sites, e.g., Facebook
or Twitter, in conjunction with natural language pro-
cessing techniques, can capture behavioral attributes
that assist in detecting depression among the users
(De Choudhury et al., 2013). One property of depres-
sion that has not been well explored in social media is
its temporal aspect: it may be episodic, recurrent, or
chronic, with a recurrence rate of 35% within 2 years.
Thus it is critical, when using social media to look at
depression, to study how behavioral patterns change
over a detailed timeline of the user. For example, de-
creased social interaction, increased negativity, and
decreased energy may all be signals of depression.

In this work, we make the following contributions:

1. We collect a large dataset of user interactions
over time from online health forums about de-
pression and other related conditions.

2. We identify phrases (e.g. cut myself, depression
medication) that are highly associated with the
last post or reply of a user in a depression forum.

3. We show that users in depression forums have
a substantially lower use of social words than

14



users of related forums.
4. We show that user demographics, activity levels,

and timeline information can accurately predict
which users will withdraw from a forum.

While these contributions obviously do not repre-
sent a solution to depression, we believe they form a
significant first step towards understanding how the
study of social media timelines can contribute.

There are several other works that have analyzed
participation continuation problems in different on-
line social paradigms using different approaches, i.e.
friendship relationship among users (Ngonmang et
al., 2012), psycholinguistic word usage (Mahmud
et al., 2014), linguistic change (Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil et al., 2013), activity timelines (Sinha et al.,
2014), and combinations of the above (Sadeque et
al., 2015). Also there are numerous works that con-
tributes to the mental health research (De Choudhury
et al., 2016; De Choudhury, 2015; Gkotsis et al.,
2016; Colombo et al., 2016; Desmet and Hoste, 2013)
We believe ours is the first work to integrate language
and timeline analysis for studying decreasing social
interaction in depression forums.

2 Data

Our data is collected from HealthBoards1, one of the
oldest and largest support group based online social
networks with hundreds of support groups dedicated
to people suffering from physical or mental ailments.
Users in these forums can either initiate a thread, or
reply to a thread initiated by others.

We focused on the forums Depression, Relation-
ship Health, and Brain/Nervous System Disorders.
While depression remains our main focus, the other
two forums represent related conditions and serve
as control groups to which we can compare the De-
pression forum. Relationship Health includes so-
cial factors that interact heavily with mental health.
Brain/Nervous System Disorder considers a more
physical perspective, including the neuropsychiatric
disorders Arachnoiditis, Alzheimer’s Disease and
Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),
Aneurysm, Bell’s Palsy, Brain and Head Injury, Brain
and Nervous System Disorders, Brain Tumors, Cere-
bral Palsy and Dizziness/Vertigo.

Table 1: Summary of the data collected from Health-
Boards. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.

We crawled all of the posts (thread initiations) and
replies to existing threads for these support groups
from the earliest available post until the end of April
2016. The posts and replies were downloaded as
HTML files, one per thread, where each thread con-
tains an initial post and zero or more replies. The
HTML files were parsed and filtered for scripts and
navigation elements to collect the actors, contents
and general information about the thread. We stored
this collected information using the JSON-based Ac-
tivity Stream 2.0 specification from the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C, 2015). All collected con-
tents were part-of-speech tagged using the Stanford
part-of-speech tagger (Manning et al., 2014) and all
words were tagged with their respective psycholin-
guistic categories by matching them against the Lin-
guistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)2 lexicon.

Table 1 gives descriptive statistics of the dataset.
All three forums are roughly similar in number of
users. However, users in the Depression forum are
less engaged than users in Relationship Health, hav-
ing a lower average number of replies per post and
a lower average number of replies per user. While
the Depression forum is similar to the Brain/Nervous
System Disorder forum in terms of posts and replies
per user, there are more users in the Depression fo-
rums that choose not to specify their gender.

2.1 Language Analysis
We hypothesized that the final post of a user might
include linguistic cues of their decreasing social in-
teraction. For this experiment, we considered users
who were inactive for at least the one year preceding
the day of data collection. We gathered the contents
of their posts, and used pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between unigrams (and bigrams) and last posts

Table 2: Top 10 bigrams from each forum based on
their PMI with last posts. For space, we abbreviated
medication as med.

to identify words (and bigrams) that occurred in last
posts more often than would be expected by chance.
We excluded unigrams occurring less than 50 times
and bigrams occurring less than 10 times.

Table 2 lists the top 10 bigrams most associated
with last posts in each forum. These n-grams suggest
differences in reasons for leaving different types of
forums. Depression has some especially revealing
phrases: people appear to withdraw from the forum
after starting treatment (of Pristiq, depression med-
ication), but also after apparent calls for help (’m
suffering, cut myself, Any help).

We next hypothesized that there may be observable
changes over time in the language of users who are

disengaging from the community. We identified the
five LIWC psycholinguistic classes that were most as-
sociated with last posts across the forums (using PMI
as above): Social, Cognition, Affect, Positive Emo-
tion, and Negative Emotion. We selected the most
active users that (1) posted in at least two different
years, and (2) made at least 100 posts or replies. We
then divided these users into two cohorts. The first
cohort included the top 100 users who were inactive
for at least one year preceding the day of data collec-
tion, which we call the non-returning (NR) cohort.
The second cohort included the top 100 users with
high activity but not marked as inactive yet, which
we call the returning (R) cohort.

We then considered the 12 months ending at the
user’s last post or reply, and graphed the frequency
that words from the five psycholinguistic classes were
used. Figure 1 shows the use of words from different
psycholinguistic classes over time. For most word
classes, usage is fairly constant over time and similar
across the forums. However, use of social words in
the Depression forum is about 40% lower than in Re-
lationship Health or Brain/Nervous System Disorder.
This reduced use of social words may indicate less
social interaction and less energy, consistent with
signs of recurring depressive episodes. Interestingly,
both the returning (R) cohort and the non-returning
(NR) cohort exhibit this behavior.

(a) Sentiment score (NR)

Figure 2: Sentiment score of activities over the fi-
nal 12 months for three forums for Depression fo-
rums (blue), Relationship Health forums (orange),
and Brain/Nervous System Disorder forums (grey).

2.2 Sentiment Analysis

We hypothesized that sentiment scores of users’ later
activities might provide some insight into their de-
creasing social interaction. We encountered many
posts with negative sentiment after which the user
stopped participating in the forum, for example:

. . . I was really frightened of what was hap-
pening to me, my Mum took me straight
back to the doctors, to a different one, they
were useless, they put me straight on zoloft,
I took the zoloft for about 3 days when ev-
erything got worse, I couldn’t eat, I kept
throwing up, I was having constant panic
attacks I just wanted to sleep but lived in
fear when I was alone. . . 3

To investigate, we took the same users from the lan-
guage analysis and calculated sentiment for all of
their posts and replies using the Stanford CoreNLP
(Manning et al., 2014) sentiment analyzer (Socher et
al., 2013). The analyzer scores each sentence from
0 to 4, with 0 being extremely negative and 4 being
extremely positive. We take as the score for an activ-
ity (post or reply) the average of the sentence-level
scores for all sentences in that activity.

We graphed the average activity sentiment scores
for each forum by averaging the scores over the last
12 months of each user. Figure 2 shows that there was
little change in sentiment scores over time, and the
lines closely follow the average score for respective
forums (Depression: 1.68, Relationship Health: 1.70,
Brain/Nervous System Disroder: 1.78). (The figure

shows non-returning users; returning users were sim-
ilar.) This finding refutes our hypothesis regarding
sentiment scores of later activities being useful for
predicting continued participation.

2.3 Idle Time Analysis

We hypothesized that a user’s idle time predict
whether they remain socially engaged in the forum.
We define idle time as the time between two sequen-
tial activities (posting or replying). For each forum,
we identified all users who posted in at least two
different years, and selected 50 random users who
were active within the one year preceding the day
of data collection, and 50 random users who were
not. We then calculated the initial idle time (from ac-
count creation to first activity), maximum idle time,
and median idle time. Table 3 shows average ini-
tial, maximum, and median idle times across the
forums. In general, non-returning users wait longer
before their first activity, and have larger maximum
and median idle times. Depression forum users have
smaller initial idle times than Relationship Health
or Brain/Nervous System Disorder users, both for
returning and non-returning users.

3 Prediction Task

Having observed linguistic and timeline features that
suggest when a user is withdrawing from a Depres-
sion forum, we began to construct a predictive model
for identifying users that are entering such episodes.
This task is similar to the continued participation
prediction task introduced by Sadeque et al. (2015).
Formally, we consider the model

m∆t(u) =


1 if ∃a ∈ activities(u) :

start(u) + ∆t < time(a) <
start(u) + ∆t + maxtime(u)

0 otherwise

where ∆t is the observation period, u is a user,
start(u) is the time at which the user u created an
account, activities(u) is the set of all activities of
user u, time(a) is the time of the activity a, and

maxtime(u) = max
a∈activities(u)

time(a)

Intuitively, m should predict 0 iff ∆t time has elapsed
since the user created their account and the user will
be inactive in the forum for longer than ever before.

We considered the following classes of features:

D User profile demographics: gender and whether a
location and/or an avatar image was provided.

A Activity information: number of thread initiations,
number of replies posted, number of replies re-
ceived from others, number of self-replies.

T Timeline information: initial, final, maximum and
median idle times.

U/B/G Bag of unigrams/bigrams/1-skip-2-grams
from the last post of the observation period.

P Counts of words for each LIWC psycholinguistic
class in the last post of the observation period.

S Sentiment score of the last post of the observation
period

We trained an L2 regularized logistic regression
from LibLinear (Fan et al., 2008) using the data col-
lected from the Depression forum. Throwaway ac-
counts (Leavitt, 2015), defined as accounts with ac-
tivity levels below the median (2 posts or replies),
were excluded from training and testing, though their
replies to other users were included for feature ex-
traction. After removing such accounts, 8398 user
accounts remained, of which we used 6000 for train-
ing our model, and 2398 for testing.

Table 4 shows the performance of this model on
different observation periods (1 month, 6 months, 12
months) and different combinations of the feature
classes. It also shows the performance of a baseline
model (BL) that predicts that all users will be inac-

tive, the most common classification. We measure
performance in terms of F1 (the harmonic mean of
precision and recall) on identifying users who with-
draw from the forum by the end of the observation
period. The most predictive features are the timeline
(T) features, resulting in F1 of 93.7 for a 12 month
observation period. Though demographic (D) and
activity (A) features underperform the baseline alone,
adding them to the timeline features (DAT column)
yields a 6% error reduction: 94.0 F1. The improve-
ment is larger for 1 and 6 month observation periods:
8% and 10% error reductions, respectively.

Adding the language-based features (the DATP,
DATU, DATB, DATG, DATS columns) does not in-
crease performance. This is despite our findings in
section 2.1 that some phrases were associated with
final posts in the forum, but consistent with our find-
ings in Section 2.2 that sentiment analysis was not
a strong predictor. This failure of linguistic features
may be due to the relatively modest associations; for
example, cut myself had a PMI of 0.46, and is thus
only 38% more likely to show up in a last post than
expected by chance. It may also be due to the sim-
plicity of our linguistic features. Consider Im getting
to that rock bottom phase again and im scared. By
PMI, rock bottom is not highly associated with last
posts, since people often talk about recovering from
rock bottom. Only present tense rock bottom is con-
cerning, but none of our features capture this kind of
temporal phenomenon.

4 Conclusion

Our analysis of user language and activities in
depression-oriented health forums showed that cer-
tain phrases and a decline in the use of social words
are associated with decreased social interaction in
these forums. Our predictive models, based on this
analysis, accurately identify users who are withdraw-
ing from the forum, and we found that while demo-
graphic, activity, and timeline features were predic-
tive, simple linguistic features did not provide addi-
tional benefits. We believe that better understanding
of the attributes that contribute to the lack of social en-
gagement in online social media can provide valuable
insights for predicting medical issues like depressive
episodes, and we hope that our current work helps to
form a foundation for such future research.
