The translation process is regarded as a complex cognitive process and one of the core 
topics in cognitive translatology. Unlike how machine translation post-editing works, 
which only needs a machine translation result, we divide the translation process into 
several cognitive subtasks and use the technology in MT to help  the implementation 
of each subtask. We aim to make each subtask completed automatically or semi-
automatically and evaluate the improvement of cognitive effort cost by adopting the 
cognitive measure approach. In this way, a cognitive framework is expected to be 
built for the use and development of MT technology.
