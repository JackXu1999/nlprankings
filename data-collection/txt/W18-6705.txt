Abstract 

Intelligent Transportation Systems could 

benefit from harnessing social media con-

tent to get continuous feedback. In this 

work, we implement a system to identify 

reasons for stress in tweets related to traffic 

using a word vector strategy to select a rea-

son from a predefined list generated by 

topic modeling and clustering. The pro-

posed system, which performs better than 

standard machine learning algorithms, 

could provide inputs to warning systems for 

commuters in the area and feedback for the 

authorities. 

1 Introduction 

Transportation systems connect hubs of human set-

tlements and facilitate the movement of goods and 

people, with limiting congestion and accidents be-

ing a key design goal for cities. Continuous updates 

about traffic bottlenecks and accidents can help 

with this. The social web is a potential feedback 

source for transportation systems, providing in-

sights about the experiences and mental states of 

commuters. Stress is a key factor to monitor since 

transportation problems of all kinds are likely to in-

crease stress.  

In this study, we implement a framework for 

finding the causes of stress expressed in tweets re-

lated to traffic. Our system identifies specific rea-

sons for stress of commuters (accidents, conges-

tion, etc.) that could be used to generate automated 

warnings for other travelers and feed in to context-

aware GPS devices. Commuters can then take in-

formed decisions to opt for alternate routes, avoid-

ing traffic bottlenecks. Urban planning authorities 

can also leverage the analysis of stress reasons to 

take remedial actions as part of their Intelligent 

Transportation Systems strategy. 

In this study we collected tweets about traffic in 

London during July 2018 and analyzed them to un-

derstand the reasons for the stress expressed by the 

commuters. As a pre-processing step, a list of po-

tential stressors in the traffic domain was found by 

topic modelling and k-means clustering. Three dif-

ferent word-vector based methods were then ap-

plied to tweets to select a stressor from the stressors 

list. The output is evaluated by comparing it with 

the stress reason selected by human annotators.  

The contributions of this work are as follows: 

1. This is the first study detecting reasons for

stress expressed in traffic-related tweets.

2. A dataset of traffic-related tweets annotated

with reasons for stress.

2 Related Work 

2.1 Stress Detection from Social Media 

Social media has become a source of data for men-

tal health analysis and evaluation. Lin et al. (2015) 

proposed a factor graph model combined with 

CNN based on linguistic, visual and social interac-

tion data to detect stress from social media content. 

There have been several studies on detecting men-

tal health disorders from social media data.  De 

Choudhury et al. (2013a) leveraged behavioural 

patterns from social media, such as decreased ac-

tivity, increased negative sentiment, religious in-

volvement and clustered ego networks to build a 

classifier to proactively find the risk for depression 

in individuals before the onset. De Choudhury et al. 

(2013b) introduced a statistical model for predict-

ing the onset of post-partum depression in mothers 

20



  

with an accuracy of 71% using prenatal data and 

80-83% when utilizing postnatal data as well. Also, 

the anonymity of mental health related postings in 

Reddit and online forums is an important factor 

which is discussed by Umashanthi (2015). Copper-

smith et al. (2014) analysed linguistic features of 

Tweets of individuals with Post Traumatic Stress 

Disorder and built a classifier based on it. Stress 

can manifest around specific incidents, such as gun 

violence (Saha, 2017), and student deaths (Saha, 

2018). 

Thelwall et al. (2016) introduced TensiStrength, 

a novel lexicon-based system to detect stress/relax-

ation scores from social media based on linguistic 

resources such as LIWC (Tausczik and Penne-

baker, 2010), General Inquirer (Stone et al, 1986) 

and the sentiment analysis software SentiStrength 

(Thelwall et al, 2010; Thelwall et al, 2012). Incor-

poration of word sense disambiguation (Gopala-

krishna Pillai et al, 2018) improved the perfor-

mance of TensiStrength.  

Detecting reasons for stress from social media is 

a significant challenge. Lin et al. (2016) introduced 

a comprehensive scheme for identifying stressor 

event and subject and finding the stress reason and 

level based on it. This study is limited to personal 

stressor events, such as divorce, death, and rela-

tionships.  

2.2 Natural Language Generation from 
Tweets 

Traffic is a relatively new domain for the applica-

tion of Natural Language Generation. However, 

with the proliferation of social media and accurate 

location devices, there is tremendous potential for 

data-driven, automatically generated messages 

about traffic incidents. Tran and Popowich (2016) 

introduced a novel generation model to provide lo-

cation-relevant information. This traffic notifica-

tion system trains a model to generate natural lan-

guage texts and deliver real time warnings in case 

of traffic events.  

Generating route descriptions is another applica-

tion of NLG in traffic. Dale, Geldoff and Prost 

(2005) used GIS data as input and applies NLG 

principles to produce output texts. It used discourse 

structure to understand route structure and aggre-

gation techniques to form fluent and natural sen-

tences.   

2.3  Analysis of traffic-related tweets 

Lenormand et al. (2014) analyzed geo-located 

tweets from roads and railways in European coun-

tries. This study showed a positive correlation be-

tween the number of tweets and Average Annual 

Daily Traffic (AADT) on highways in France and 

the UK, especially in long highway segments.  

Kurniawan et al. (2016) proposed tweets as an 

alternate source to detect traffic anomalies. Support 

Vector Machines achieved a classification accuracy 

of 99.77% in the task of detecting traffic events in 

Yogyakarta province in Indonesia. In a similar 

study, D’Andrea et al. (2015) implemented an 

SVM classification model to distinguish traffic 

from no-traffic tweets with an accuracy of 95.8% 

and to distinguish externally caused traffic events 

with an accuracy of 88.9%.  

Long-term traffic prediction through tweet anal-

ysis has been shown to be effective by He et al. 

(2014) using traffic and Twitter data originating 

from San Francisco Bay in California. A cloud 

based system proposed by Sinnott and Yin (2015) 

has identified and verified accident black spots in 

the Australian city of Melbourne.  

Gu, Cian and Chen (2016) discussed mining 

tweets as an inexpensive and novel way to find traf-

fic incidents. Using a keyword dictionary, traffic 

incident tweets were identified, geocoded and then 

classified into one of five incident categories.  

Cottrill and Gault (2017) analyzed a case study 

of a Twitter account @GamesTravel2014 used dur-

ing the CommonWealth Games in Glasgow 2014, 

to share and respond to traffic related information. 

This Twitter account, in collaboration with the 

leading transportation providers in the city, was in-

strumental in detecting traffic hotspots. This case 

study establishes social media as a powerful tool to 

share trusted traffic information. 

Salas and Georgakis (2017) created a collection 

of Tweets which mention traffic events in the UK. 

A key contribution of this work is a methodology 

with 88.27% accuracy for crawling, preprocessing 

and classifying traffic tweets using Natural Lan-

guage Processing and Support Vector Machines. 

The dataset was analyzed to find the temporal and 

linguistic features of the Tweets.  

Lv and Chen (2016) summarized the main re-

search topics in transportation research using social 

media. However, though traffic-related tweets have 

been studied for identification of traffic events, the 

sentiments of the commuters using transportation 

systems have been largely unexplored. Cao and 

21



  

Zeng (2014) proposed Traffic Sentiment Analysis 

as a new tool to analyze sentiments expressed in 

traffic related social media content. In the context 

of the ‘yellow light rule’ and fuel prices in China, 

they demonstrated the architecture, data collection 

and process of their methods. Our system is the first 

attempt to identify stress reasons in the social me-

dia outputs of commuters, providing feedback 

about the improvement areas for transportation 

systems.  

3 Methodology 

  We use a two-step method developed in our ear-
lier research on finding stress reasons for airlines 

and politics (Gopalakrishna Pillai et al., 2018b). 

High-stress tweets belonging to the traffic domain 

were first analyzed by topic modelling to find the 

most frequently occurring topics. A list of poten-

tial reasons for stress in traffic was constructed 

from it. In the second step, tweets were analyzed 

by word-vector methods to find the reason for 

stress from the potential list. 

3.1 Overview 

Construction of Potential Stressors list: Our 

study was limited to tweets discussing traffic in 

the city of London. The tweets collected were pre-

processed by removing duplicates. They were as-

signed stress scores by TensiStrength, on a scale 

of -1 to -5, (-1 denote the least stress and -5 the 

highest stress). 

The higher stress scored Tweets (with score -5 

or -4) constituted the corpus for performing batch-

wise LDA topic modeling with hashtag pooling. 

The topics from this step were grouped into 5 clus-

ters(the number of clusters was chosen based on the 

coherence of the collection). 

 A label was assigned to each cluster using the 

most similar word vector method. These cluster la-

bels encasing the most frequent topics in high-

stress tweets constituted the potential stressors for 

the traffic domain (Table 1). 

Example topics in the cluster Stressor

down fatality

 Table 1: Clusters and stressors (London Traffic) 

Finding stress reasons for tweets: As previ-

ously introduced for politics and airlines (Gopala-

krishna Pillai et al., 2018b), we employed 3 word-

vector based methods to find causes for stress in 

Tweets. 

 Method 1 (maximum word similarity): Select 

the stressor with the highest cosine similarity with 

any of the content words in the tweets. 

Method 2 (context vector similarity): Select 

the stressor with the highest cosine similarity with 

the context vector representing the tweet (average 

of vectors corresponding to the content words). 

Method 3 (cluster vector similarity): This is 

the same as Method 2, but the stressor is repre-

sented by a cluster vector found by averaging vec-

tors of all words in the topic cluster. Select the clus-

ter with highest cosine similarity with the context 

vector. 

3.2 Dataset and Annotation 

We first collected 23249 tweets from 1st to 31st 

July 2018 with the Twitter API. The search queries 

were strings and hashtags related to traffic in Lon-

don and two key motorways (‘London’ AND ‘traf-

fic’, #london AND #traffic, #londontraffic, #m25, 

#m40). Removing tweets consisting only of URLs, 

and duplicate tweets, left 13321 tweets. Using Ten-

siStrength, these tweets were given scores in a 

scale of -1 to -5 to indicate their stress level. There 

were 2334 tweets with a stress score of -4 or -5. A 

high-stress traffic tweet corpus was created by ran-

domly selecting the 1000 tweets from this set. This 

was divided into 5 groups with 200 tweets each and 

each group was subjected to LDA-based topic 

modelling with hashtag pooling. A list of potential 

22



  

stressors in the traffic domain was created as de-

scribed in the previous section. 

Out of the 4410 tweets with -5, -4 or -3 stress 

scores, the 1000 tweets which were used for find-

ing the potential stress reasons were excluded and 

from the remaining tweets, 2000 were randomly 

chosen for evaluation of the word vector methods. 

We included Tweets with stress score -3 too in this 

dataset because this is a sufficiently high stress 

score for the annotators and the word vector analy-

sis to assign a stress reason.   

These 2000 tweets were annotated individually 

and independently by three human coders, marking 

them with the most appropriate reason for stress 

from the list of potential stressors. The annotators 

had engaged in a similar stress-reason annotation 

experiment, and their reliability was further as-

sessed with Krippendorff’s α inter-coder agree-

ment scores. The agreement rates were sufficiently 

high to claim that the annotations are coherent and 

usable (Table 2).

3.3 Experimental Setup 

The experiments performed were similar to our 

earlier research on finding stress reasons for air-

lines and politics (Gopalakrishna Pillai et al., 

2018b). To train the word vectors for finding 

stressors, we used a Word2Vec model trained on 

400 million tweets, from an ACL WNUT task 

(Godin et al, 2015).  

The default Weka 3.6 configurations of three 

machine learning algorithms (AdaBoost: An adap-

tive boosting algorithm, Logistic Regression and 

Support Vector Machines) were run using 10-fold 

cross validation to serve as comparison baselines 

for our methods. The feature selection was adapted 

from a similar task of assessing the stress and re-

laxation strengths expressed in tweets (Thelwall, 

2017).  Term unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and 

their frequencies were used as features. Punctua-

tion was included as a term, with consecutive punc-

tuation treated as a single term. 

4 Results 

4.1 Results Summary

found using the word vector processing methods. It 

is summarized in Table 3. Cluster vector method 

gives the best performance in terms of precision, 

recall and accuracy.

4.2. Error Analysis 

Indirect/Sarcastic Expressions: Tweets with 

an indirect expressions of stress pose a challenge to 

our methods. An example is “The joys of London 

traffic; not moving for last one hour is killing me”, 

“Lea Bridge rd E10 traffic is murder really London 

counsel” in which the reason for stress is Conges-

tion, but is detected as violence.

Multiple stressors: Tweets in which there are mul-

tiple reasons for stress. E.g.: “Vehicle emissions 

rise during rush hours, making the traffic jams hell-

ish” has two stressors, “pollution” and “conges-

tion”. A possible solution will be to expand the  

methods to accommodate multiple stressors.  

5 Conclusion and Future Work 

This paper proposed and implemented word vector 

based methods to find the reasons for stress ex-

pressed in Traffic domain. A dataset containing  

23249 Tweets about London traffic were collected 

and after preprocessing, 2000 tweets were ran-

domly chosen to be annotated by human coders 

for the reasons for stress. The performance of our 

proposed methods to detect the reasons for stress 

in this dataset was compared to that of standard 

machine learning algorithms. As a future work, 

we propose to extend this study to content in other 

social media and to modify our methods to accom-

modate Tweets with multiple stressors.   

This automated stress detection from tweets can 

identify traffic bottlenecks and accident-prone ar-

eas. These reasons identified for traffic-related 

stress can be used as inputs in the form of picto-

grams or short texts to an automated warning sys-

tem for the commuters and feedback for the traffic 

policymakers. Further research is required to use 

the findings of this stress reason detection method 

for improving Intelligent Transportation Systems.
