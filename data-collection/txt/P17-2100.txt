Abstract

Current Chinese social media text summa-
rization models are based on an encoder-
decoder framework. Although its gener-
ated summaries are similar to source texts
literally, they have low semantic relevance.
In this work, our goal is to improve se-
mantic relevance between source texts and
summaries for Chinese social media sum-
marization. We introduce a Semantic Rel-
evance Based neural model to encourage
high semantic similarity between texts and
summaries. In our model, the source tex-
t is represented by a gated attention en-
coder, while the summary representation
is produced by a decoder. Besides, the
similarity score between the representa-
tions is maximized during training. Our
experiments show that the proposed mod-
el outperforms baseline systems on a so-
cial media corpus.

1 Introduction

Text summarization is to produce a brief sum-
mary of the main ideas of the text. For long
and normal documents, extractive summarization
achieves satisfying performance by selecting a few
sentences from source texts (Radev et al., 2004;
Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Cheng and Lapata,
2016). However, it does not apply to Chinese
social media text summarization, where texts are
comparatively short and often full of noise. There-
fore, abstractive text summarization, which is
based on encoder-decoder framework, is a better
choice (Rush et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015).

For extractive summarization, the selected sen-
tences often have high semantic relevance to the
text. However, for abstractive text summariza-
tion, current models tend to produce grammatical

and coherent summaries regardless of its semantic
relevance with source texts. Figure 1 shows that
the summary generated by a current model (RNN
encoder-decoder) is similar to the source text liter-
ally, but it has low semantic relevance.

In this work, our goal is to improve the seman-
tic relevance between source texts and generat-
ed summaries for Chinese social media text sum-
marization. To achieve this goal, we propose a
Semantic Relevance Based neural model. In our
model, a similarity evaluation component is intro-
duced to measure the relevance of source texts and
generated summaries. During training, it maxi-
mizes the similarity score to encourage high se-
mantic relevance between source texts and sum-

maries. The representation of source texts is pro-
duced by an encoder, while that of summaries is
computed by a decoder. We introduce a gated at-
tention encoder to better represent the source tex-
t. Besides, our decoder generates summaries and
provide the summary representation. Experiments
show that our proposed model has better perfor-
mance than baseline systems on the social media
corpus.

2 Background: Chinese Abstractive Text
Summarization

Current Chinese social media text summarization
model is based on encoder-decoder framework.
Encoder-decoder model is able to compress source
texts x = {x1, x2, ..., xN} into continuous vec-
tor representation with an encoder, and then gen-
erate the summary y = {y1, y2, ..., yM} with a de-
coder. In the previous work (Hu et al., 2015), the
encoder is a bi-directional gated recurrent neural
network, which maps source texts into sentence
vector {h1, h2, ..., hN}. The decoder is a uni-
directional recurrent neural network, which pro-
duces the distribution of output words yt with pre-
vious hidden state st−1 and word yt−1:

p(yt|x) = softmaxf(st−1, yt−1) (1)

where f is recurrent neural network output func-
tion, and s0 is the last hidden state of encoder hN .

Attention mechanism is introduced to bet-
ter capture context information of source
texts (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Attention vector ct
is represented by the weighted sum of encoder
hidden states:

ct =

N∑

i=1

αtihi (2)

αti =
eg(st,hi)

∑N
j=1 e

g(st,hj)
(3)

where g(st, hi) is a relevant score between de-
coder hidden state st and encoder hidden state
hi. When predicting an output word, the decoder
takes account of attention vector, which contain-
s the alignment information between source texts
and summaries.

3 Proposed Model

Our assumption is that source texts and sum-
maries have high semantic relevance, so our pro-
posed model encourages high similarity between

their representations. Figure 2 shows our pro-
posed model. The model consists of three compo-
nents: encoder, decoder and a similarity function.
The encoder compresses source texts into seman-
tic vectors, and the decoder generates summaries
and produces semantic vectors of the generated
summaries. Finally, the similarity function eval-
uates the relevance between the sematic vectors of
source texts and generated summaries. Our train-
ing objective is to maximize the similarity score so
that the generated summaries have high semantic
relevance with source texts.

3.1 Text Representation
There are several methods to represent a text or
a sentence, such as mean pooling of RNN output
or reserving the last state of RNN. In our model,
source text is represented by a gated attention en-
coder (Hahn and Keller, 2016). Every upcoming
word is fed into a gated attention network, which
measures its importance. The gated attention net-
work outputs the important score with a feedfor-
ward network. At each time step, it inputs a word
vector et and its previous context vector ht, then
outputs the score βt. Then the word vector et is
multiplied by the score βt, and fed into RNN en-
coder. We select the last output hN of RNN en-
coder as the semantic vector of the source text Vt.

A natural idea to get the semantic vector of a
summary is to feed it into the encoder as well.
However, this method wastes much time because

636



we encode the same sentence twice. Actually, the
last output sM contains information of both source
text and generated summaries. We simply com-
pute the semantic vector of the summary by sub-
tracting hN from sM :

Vs = sM − hN (4)

Previous work has proved that it is effective to
represent a span of words without encoding them
once more (Wang and Chang, 2016).

3.2 Semantic Relevance
Our goal is to compute the semantic relevance of
source text and generated summary given seman-
tic vector Vt and Vs. Here, we use cosine simi-
larity to measure the semantic relevance, which is
represented with a dot product and magnitude:

cos(Vs, Vt) =
Vs · Vt

∥Vs∥∥Vt∥
(5)

Source text and summary share the same language,
so it is reasonable to assume that their semantic
vectors are distributed in the same space. Cosine
similarity is a good way to measure the distance
between two vectors in the same space.

3.3 Training
Given the model parameter θ and input text x, the
model produces corresponding summary y and se-
mantic vector Vs and Vt. The objective is to mini-
mize the loss function:

L = −p(y|x; θ) − λcos(Vs, Vt) (6)

where p(y|x; θ) is the conditional probability of
summaries given source texts, and is computed by
the encoder-decoder model. cos(Vs, Vt) is cosine
similarity of semantic vectors Vs and Vt. This term
tries to maximize the semantic relevance between
source input and target output.

4 Experiments

In this section, we present the evaluation of our
model and show its performance on a popular so-
cial media corpus. Besides, we use a case to ex-
plain the semantic relevance between generated
summary and source text.

4.1 Dataset
Our dataset is Large Scale Chinese Short Tex-
t Summarization Dataset (LCSTS), which is con-
structed by Hu et al. (2015). The dataset consists

of more than 2.4 million text-summary pairs, con-
structed from a famous Chinese social media web-
site called Sina Weibo1. It is split into three parts,
with 2,400,591 pairs in PART I, 10,666 pairs in
PART II and 1,106 pairs in PART III. All the text-
summary pairs in PART II and PART III are man-
ually annotated with relevant scores ranged from
1 to 5, and we only reserve pairs with scores no
less than 3. Following the previous work, we use
PART I as training set, PART II as development
set, and PART III as test set.

4.2 Experiment Setting

To alleviate the risk of word segmentation mis-
takes (Xu and Sun, 2016), we use Chinese charac-
ter sequences as both source inputs and target out-
puts. We limit the model vocabulary size to 4000,
which covers most of the common characters.
Each character is represented by a random initial-
ized word embedding. We tune our parameter on
the development set. In our model, the embed-
ding size is 400, the hidden state size of encoder-
decoder is 500, and the size of gated attention net-
work is 1000. We use Adam optimizer to learn
the model parameters, and the batch size is set as
32. The parameter λ is 0.0001. Both the encoder
and decoder are based on LSTM unit. Follow-
ing the previous work (Hu et al., 2015), our eval-
uation metric is F-score of ROUGE: ROUGE-1,
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

4.3 Baseline Systems

RNN. We denote RNN as the basic sequence-to-
sequence model with bi-directional GRU encoder
and uni-directional GRU decoder. It is a widely
used language generated framework, so it is an im-
portant baseline.
RNN context. RNN context is a sequence-to-
sequence framework with neural attention. Atten-
tion mechanism helps capture the context informa-
tion of source texts. This model is a stronger base-
line system.

4.4 Results and Discussions

We compare our model with above baseline sys-
tems, including RNN and RNN context. We refer
to our proposed Semantic Relevance Based neural
model as SRB. Besides, SRB with a gated atten-
tion encoder is denoted as +Attention. Table 1

tems. We can see SRB outperforms both RN-
N and RNN context in the F-score of ROUGE-1,
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L. It concludes that SR-
B generates more key words and phrases. With
a gated attention encoder, SRB achieves a bet-
ter performance with 33.3 F-score of ROUGE-1,
20.0 ROUGE-2 and 30.1 ROUGE-L. It shows that
the gated attention reduces noisy and unimportan-
t information, so that the remaining information
represents a clear idea of source text. The bet-
ter representation of encoder leads to a better se-

mantic relevance evaluation by the similarity func-
tion. Therefore, SRB with gated attention encoder
is able to generate summaries with high semantic
relevance to source text.

Figure 3 is an example to show the semantic rel-
evance between the source text and the summary.
It shows that the main idea of the source text is
about the reason why Shanghai has few giant com-
pany. RNN context produces “Shanghai’s giant
companies” which is literally similar to the source
text, while SRB generates “Shanghai has few giant
companies”, which is closer to the main idea in
semantics. It concludes that SRB produces sum-
maries with higher semantic similarity to texts.

Table 2 summarizes the results of our model and
state-of-the-art systems. COPYNET has the high-
est socres, because it incorporates copying mech-
anism to deals with out-of-vocabulary word prob-
lem. In this paper, we do not implement this mech-
anism in our model. In the future work, we will try
to incorporates copying mechanism to our model
to solve the out-of-vocabulary problem.

5 Related Work

Abstractive text summarization has achieved suc-
cessful performance thanks to the sequence-to-
sequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014) and at-
tention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Rush
et al. (2015) first used an attention-based en-
coder to compress texts and a neural network lan-
guage decoder to generate summaries. Follow-
ing this work, recurrent encoder was introduced
to text summarization, and gained better perfor-
mance (Lopyrev, 2015; Chopra et al., 2016). To-
wards Chinese texts, Hu et al. (2015) built a large
corpus of Chinese short text summarization. To
deal with unknown word problem, Nallapati et
al. (2016) proposed a generator-pointer model so
that the decoder is able to generate words in source
texts. Gu et al. (2016) also solved this issue by in-
corporating copying mechanism.

Our work is also related to neural attention
model. Neural attention model is first proposed
by Bahdanau et al. (2014). There are many
other methods to improve neural attention mod-
el (Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015) and accel-
erate the training process (Sun, 2016).

6 Conclusion

Our work aims at improving semantic relevance
of generated summaries and source texts for Chi-
nese social media text summarization. Our model
is able to transform the text and the summary in-
to a dense vector, and encourage high similarity
of their representation. Experiments show that our
model outperforms baseline systems, and the gen-
erated summary has higher semantic relevance.
