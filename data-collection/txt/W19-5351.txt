Abstract
We present the results of the application of a
grammatical test suite for German→English
MT on the systems submitted at WMT19, with
a detailed analysis for 107 phenomena organi-
zed in 14 categories. The systems still transla-
te wrong one out of four test items in avera-
ge. Low performance is indicated for idioms,
modals, pseudo-clefts, multi-word expressions
and verb valency. When compared to last ye-
ar, there has been a improvement of function
words, non verbal agreement and punctuati-
on. More detailed conclusions about particular
systems and phenomena are also presented.

1 Introduction

For decades, the development of Machine Trans-
lation (MT) has been based on either automatic
metrics or human evaluation campaigns with the
main focus on producing scores or comparisons
(rankings) expressing a generic notion of quali-
ty. Through the years there have been few ex-
amples of more detailed analyses of the trans-
lation quality, both automatic (HTER (Snover
et al., 2009), Hjerson (Popović, 2011)) and human
(MQM Lommel et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the-
se efforts have not been systematic and they have
only focused on few shallow error categories (e.g.
morphology, lexical choice, reordering), whereas
the human evaluation campaigns have been limi-
ted by the requirement for manual human effort.
Additionally, previous work on MT evaluation fo-
cused mostly on the ability of the systems to trans-
late test sets sampled from generic text sources,
based on the assumption that this text is repre-
sentative of a common translation task (Callison-
Burch et al., 2007).

In order to provide more systematic methods to
evaluate MT in a more fine-grained level, recent
research has relied to the idea of test suites (Guil-
lou and Hardmeier, 2016; Isabelle et al., 2017).

The test suites are assembled in a way that allows
testing particular issues which are the focus of the
evaluation. The evaluation of the systems is not ba-
sed on generic text samples, but from the perspec-
tive of fulfilling a priori quality requirements.

In this paper we use the DFKI test suite for
German→English MT (Burchardt et al., 2017) in
order to analyze the performance of the 16 MT
Systems that took part at the translation task of
the Fourth Conference of Machine Translation.
The evaluation focuses on 107 mostly gramma-
tical phenomena organized in 14 categories. In
order to apply the test suite, we follow a semi-
automatic methodology that benefits from regu-
lar expressions, followed by minimal human re-
finement (Section 3). The application of the sui-
te allows us to form conclusions on the particular
grammatical performance of the systems and per-
form several comparisons (Section 4).

2 Related Work

Several test suites have been presented as part of
the Test Suite track of the Third Conference of
Machine Translation (Bojar et al., 2018a). Each
test suite focused on a particular phenomenon,
such as discourse (Bojar et al., 2018b), morpho-
logy (Burlot et al., 2018), grammatical contrasts
(Cinkova and Bojar, 2018), pronouns (Guillou
et al., 2018) and word sense disambiguation (Ri-
os et al., 2018). In contrast to the above test sui-
tes, our test suite is the only one that does such
a systematic evaluation of more than one hundred
phenomena. A direct comparison can be done with
the latter related paper, since it focuses at the sa-
me language direction. Its authors use automated
methods to extract text items, whereas in our test
suite the test items are created manually.

3 Method

The test suite is a manually devised test set who-
se contents are chosen with the purpose to test the
performance of the MT system on specific pheno-
mena or requirements related to quality. For each
phenomenon a subset of relevant test sentences is
chosen manually. Then, each MT system is re-
quested to translate the given subset and the per-
formance of the system on the particular pheno-
menon is calculated based on the percentage of
the phenomenon instances that have been properly
translated.

For this paper we use the latest version of the
DFKI Test Suite for MT on German to English.
The test suite has been presented in (Burchardt
et al., 2017) and applied extensively in last year’s
shared task (Macketanz et al., 2018b). The cur-
rent version contains 5560 test sentences in order
to control 107 phenomena organised in 14 catego-
ries. It is similar to the method used last year, with
few minor corrections. The number of the test in-
stances per phenomenon varies, ranging between a
20 and 180 sentences. A full list of the phenome-
na and their categories can be seen as part of the
results in the Appendix. An example list of test
sentences with correct and incorrect translations is
available on GitHub1.

3.1 Construction and application of the test
suite

The construction and the application of the test
suite follows the steps below, also indicated in Fi-
gure 1:
(a) Produce paradigms: A person with good
knowledge of German and English grammar de-
vises or selects a set of source language sentences
that may trigger translation errors related to parti-
cular phenomena. These sentences may be written
from scratch, inspired from previous observations
on common MT errors or drawn from existing re-
sources (Lehmann et al., 1996).
(b) Fetch sample translations: The source sen-
tences are given as an input to easily accessible
MT systems and their outputs are fetched.
(c) Write regular expressions: By inspecting the
MT output for every given sentence, the annotator
writes rules that control whether the output con-
tains a correct translation regarding the respective
phenomenon. The rules are written as positive or

Lexical Ambiguity
Das Gericht gestern Abend war lecker.
The court last night was delicious. fail

Conditional

nicht geschlossen hätten.

He would go shopping if the shops hadn’t closed. pass
Passive voice

A lot was celebrated and danced. fail
There was a lot of celebration and dancing. pass

Table 1: Examples of passing and failing MT outputs

negative regular expressions, that signify a correct
or an incorrect translation respectively.

(d) Fetch more translations: When the test sui-
te contains a sufficient number of test items with
the respective control rules, the test suite is ready
for its broad application. The test items are conse-
quently given to a large number of MT systems.
This is done in contact with their developers or
through the submission process of a shared task,
as is the case described in this paper.

(e) Apply regular expressions: The control rules
are applied on the MT outputs in order to check
whether the relevant phenomena have been trans-
lated properly. When the MT output matches a po-
sitive regular expression, the translation is consi-
dered correct (pass) whereas when the MT output
matches a negative regular expression, the trans-
lation is considered incorrect (fail). Examples can
be seen in Table 1. In case an MT output does not
match either a positive or a negative regular ex-
pression, or in case these contradict to each other,
the automatic evaluation results in a uncertain de-
cision (warning).

(f) Resolve warnings and refine regular expres-
sions: The warnings are given to the annotator, so
that they manually resolve them and if possible re-
fine the rules to address similar cases in the future.
Through the iterative execution of steps (e) and (f)
(which are an extension of steps (c) and (d) respec-
tively) the rules get more robust and attain a bet-
ter coverage. If needed, the annotator can add full
sentences as rules, instead of regular expressions.

For every system we calculate the phenomenon-
specific translation accuracy as the the number of
the test sentences for the phenomenon which were
translated properly, divided by the number of all
test sentences for this phenomenon:

When doing comparisons, the significance of

every comparison is confirmed with a one-tailed
Z-test with α = 0.95.

3.2 Experiment Setup

In the evaluation presented in the paper, MT out-
puts are obtained from the 16 systems that are part
of the news translation task of the Fourth Confe-
rence on Machine Translation (WMT19). Accor-
ding to the details that the developers have publis-
hed by the time this paper is written, 10 of the sys-
tems are declared to be Neural Machine Transla-
tion (NMT) systems and 9 of them confirm that
they follow the Transformer paradigm, whereas
for the rest 6 systems no details were given. For
the evaluation of the MT outputs the software TQ-
AutoTest (Macketanz et al., 2018a) was used.

After processing the MT output for the 5560
items of the test suite, the automatic application of
the regular expressions resulted to about 10% war-
nings. Consequently, one human annotator (stu-
dent of linguistics) committed about 70 hours of
work in order to reduce the warnings to 3%. The
final results were calculated using 5393 test items,
which, after the manual inspection, did not have
any warning for any of the respective MT-outputs.

Since we applied the same test suite as last year,
this year’s automatic evaluation is profiting from
the manual refinement of the regular expressions
that took place then. The first application of the
test suite in 2018 resulted in about 10-45% of war-
nings depending on the system, whereas after this
year’s application, we only had 8-28%. This year’s

results are therefore based on 16% more valid test
items, as compared to last year.

4 Results

The results of the test suite evaluation can be seen
in Tables 3 and 4, where the significantly best sys-
tems for every category or phenomenon are bold-
faced. The average accuracy per system is calcula-
ted either based on all test items (with the assump-
tion that all items have equal importance) or based
on the categories (with the assumption that all ca-
tegories have equal importance). In any case, since
the averages are calculated on an artificial test sui-
te and not on a sample test set, one must be careful
with their interpretation.

4.1 Linguistic categories
Despite the significant progress of NMT and the
recent claims for human parity, the results in terms
of the test suite are somewhat mediocre. The MT
systems achieve 75.6% accuracy in average for all
given test items, which indicates that one out of
four test items is not translated properly. If one
considers the categories separately, only five ca-
tegories have an accuracy of more than 80%: ne-
gation, where there are hardly any mistakes, fol-
lowed by composition, function word, subordi-
nation and non-verbal agreement. The lowest-
performing categories are the multi-word expres-
sions (MWE) and the verb valency with about
66% accuracy.

4.2 Linguistic phenomena
Most MT systems seem to struggle with idioms,
since they could only translate properly only
11.6% of the ones in our test set, whereas a similar



448

situation can be observed with resultative predica-
tes (17.8%). Negated modal pluperfect and mo-
dal pluperfect have an accuracy of only 23-28%.
Some of the phenomena have an accuracy of about
50%, in particular the domain-specific terms, the
pseudo-cleft sentences and the modal of pluper-
fect subjunctive II (negated or not). We may assu-
me that these phenomena are not correctly transla-
ted because they do not occur often enough in the
training and development corpora.

On the other side, for quite a few phenomena
an accuracy of more than 90% has been achieved.
This includes several cases of verbs declination
concerning the transitive, intransitive and ditran-
sitive verbs mostly on perfect and future tenses,
the passive voice, the polar question, the infiniti-
ve clause, the conditional, the focus particles, the
location and the phrasal verbs.

4.3 Comparison between systems

As seen in Table 3, the system that significant-
ly wins most categories is Facebook with 11 ca-
tegories and an average of 87.5% (if all catego-
ries counted equally), followed by DFKI and RW-
TH which are in the best cluster for 10 catego-
ries. When it comes to averaging all test items,
the best systems are RWTH and Online-A. On
specific categories, the most clear results come in
punctuation where NEU has the best performan-
ce with 100% accuracy, whereas Online-X has the
worst with 31.7%. Concerning ambiguity, Face-
book has the highest performance with 92.6% ac-
curacy. In verb tense/aspect/mood, RWTH Aa-
chen and Online-A have the highest performan-
ce with 84% accuracy, whereas in this category,
MSRA.MADL has the lowest performance with
60.4%. For the rest of the categories there are
small differences between the systems, since mo-
re than five systems fall into the same significance
cluster of the best performance.

When looking into particular phenomena (Ta-
ble 4), Facebook has the higher accuracy con-
cerning lexical ambiguity with an accuracy of
93.7%. NEU and MSRA.MADL do best with mo-
re than 95% on quotation marks. The best system
for translating modal pluferect is online-A with
75.6%, whereas at the same category, Online-Y
and Online-G perform worse, with less than 2.2%.
On modal negated - preterite, the best systems
are RWTH and UCAM with more than 95%. On
the contrary, MSRA.MADL achieves the worst ac-

curacy, as compared to other systems, in pheno-
mena related to modals (perfect, present, preteri-
te, negated modal Future I), where it mistranslates
half of the test items. One system, Online-X, was
the worst on quotation marks, as it did not con-
vey properly any of them, compared to other sys-
tems that did relatively well. Online-Y also per-
forms significantly worse than the other systems
on domain-specific terms.

4.4 Comparison with last year’s systems

One can attempt to do a vague comparison of
the statistics between two consequent years (Ta-
ble 2). Here, the last column indicates the per-
centage of improvement from the average accura-
cy of all systems from last year’s shared task2 to
the average accuracy of all systems of this year.
Although this is not entirely accurate, since diffe-
rent systems participate, we assume that the lar-
ge amount of the test items allows some gene-
ralisations to this direction. When one compares
the overall accuracy, there has been an improve-
ment of about 6%. When focusing on particular
categories, the biggest improvements are seen at
function words (+12.5%), non-verbal agreement
(+9.7%) and punctuation (+8%). The smallest im-
provement is seen at named entity and terminolo-
gy (+0.3%).

We also attempt to perform comparisons of the
systems which were submitted with the same na-
me both years. Again, the comparison should be
done under the consideration that the MT systems
are different in many aspects, which are not pos-
sible to consider at the time this paper is writ-
ten. The highest improvement is shown by the
system Online-G, which has an average accura-
cy improvement of 18.7%, with most remarkable
the one concerning negation, function words and
non-verbal agreement. Online-A has also impro-
ved at composition, verb issues and non-verbal
agreement and RWTH and UEDIN at punctuation.
On the contrary, we can notice that UCAM dete-
riorated its accuracy for several categories, most-
ly for coordination and ellipsis (-13.1%), verb is-
sues (−7.6%) and composition (-4.7%). JHU and
Online-G and RWTH show some deterioration for
three categories each, whereas Online-A seems
to have worsened considerably regarding punc-
tuation (-21.6%) and UEDIN regarding negation
(−10.5%).

5 Conclusion and Further Work

The application of the test suite results in a mul-
titude of findings of minor or major importan-
ce. Despite the recent advances, state-of-the-art
German→English MT still translates erroneous-
ly one out of four test items of our test suite, in-
dicating that there is still room for improvement.
For instance, one can note the low performance on
MWE and verb valency, whereas there are issu-
es with idioms, resultative predicates and modals.
Function words, non verbal agreement and punc-
tuation on the other side have significantly impro-
ved.

One potential benefit of the test suite would be
to investigate the implication of particular deve-
lopment settings and design decisions on particu-
lar phenomena. For some superficial issues, such
as punctuation, this would be relatively easy, as
pre- and post-processing steps may be responsible.
But for more complex phenomena, further compa-
rative analysis of settings is needed. Unfortunate-
ly, this was hard to achieve for this shared task due
to the heterogeneity of the systems, but also due to
the fact that at the time this paper was written, no
exact details about the systems were known. We
aim at looking further on such an analysis in fu-
ture steps.
