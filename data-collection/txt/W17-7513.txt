Grammatical  error  correction  is  the  task  of  correcting  errors  in  texts  including  spelling,  grammar,
collocation, and word choice errors. Software that can automatically correct errors in English texts has
far-reaching impact, since it is estimated that more than one billion people worldwide are learning English
as a second language and they will benefit greatly from such software. In this talk, I will give an overview
of past and present research on grammatical error correction, and suggest future research directions.
