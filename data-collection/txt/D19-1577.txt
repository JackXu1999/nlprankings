Abstract

Many of the world’s languages employ gram-
matical gender on the lexeme. For example,
in Spanish, the word for house (casa) is
feminine, whereas the word for paper (papel)
is masculine. To a speaker of a genderless
language, this assignment seems to exist
with neither rhyme nor reason. But is the
assignment of inanimate nouns to grammatical
genders truly arbitrary? We present the first
large-scale investigation of the arbitrariness
of noun–gender assignments. To that end, we
use canonical correlation analysis to correlate
the grammatical gender of inanimate nouns
with an externally grounded definition of their
lexical semantics. We find that 18 languages
exhibit a significant correlation between
grammatical gender and lexical semantics.

1 Introduction

In his semi-autobiographic work about his time
traveling through Germany, A Tramp Abroad,
Twain (1880) recounted his difficulty when learn-
ing the German gender system: “Every noun has a
gender, and there is no sense or system in the distri-
bution; so the gender of each must be learned sep-
arately and by heart. In German, a young lady has
no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought
reverence that shows for the turnip, and what cal-
lous disrespect for the girl.” Although this humor-
ous take on German grammatical gender is clearly a
caricature, the quote highlights the fact that the rela-
tionship between the grammatical gender of nouns
and their lexical semantics is often quite opaque.

As arbitrary as certain noun–gender assignments
may appear overall, a relatively clear relationship
often exists between grammatical gender and
lexical semantics for some of the lexicon. The

portion of the lexicon where this relationship is
clear usually consists of animate nouns; nouns
referring to people morphologically reflect the
sociocultural notion of “natural genders.” This por-
tion of the lexicon—the “semantic core”—seems
to be present in all gendered languages (Aksenov,
1984; Corbett, 1991). But how many inanimate
nouns can also be included in the semantic core?
Answering this question requires investigating
whether there is a correlation between grammatical
gender and lexical semantics for inanimate nouns.

Our primary technical contribution is demon-
strating that grammatical gender and lexical
semantics can be correlated using canonical
correlation analysis (CCA)—a standard method
for computing the correlation between two multi-
variate random variables. We consider 18 gendered
languages, following 3 steps for each: First, we
encode each inanimate noun as a one-hot vector
representing the noun’s grammatical gender in that
language; we then create 5 operationalizations of
each noun’s lexical semantics using word embed-
dings in 5 genderless “donor” languages (English,
Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Turkish);
finally, for each genderless language, we use CCA
to compute the desired correlation between gram-
matical gender and lexical semantics. This process
yields a single value for each of the 90 gendered–
genderless language pairs, revealing a significant
correlation between grammatical gender and
lexical semantics for 55 of these language pairs.

Secondarily, we investigate semantic similarities
between the 18 languages’ gender systems—i.e.,
their assignments of nouns to grammatical genders.
We analyze the projections of lexical semantics
(operationalized as word embeddings in English)
obtained via CCA, finding that phylogenetically

similar languages have more similar projections.

2 Background and Assumptions

2.1 Grammatical Gender

Languages range from employing no grammat-
ical gender on inanimate nouns, like English,
Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Turkish,
to drawing grammatical distinctions between tens
of gender-like classes (Corbett, 1991). Although
there are many theories about the assignment of
inanimate nouns to grammatical genders, to the
best of our knowledge, the linguistics literature
lacks any large-scale, quantitative investigation of
arbitrariness of noun–gender assignments. How-
ever, with the advent of modern NLP methods—
particularly with advancements in distributional ap-
proaches to semantics (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957)—
and with the copious amounts of text available on
the internet, it is now possible to conduct such an
investigation. We focus on languages that have ei-
ther two (masculine–feminine) or three (masculine–
feminine–neuter) genders, to which nouns are ex-
haustively assigned, and investigate whether a cor-
relation exists between grammatical gender and lex-
ical semantics for inanimate nouns—i.e., whether
noun–gender assignments are arbitrary or not.

In many languages, a noun’s grammatical gender
can be predicted from its spelling and pronunci-
ation (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2003; Nastase and
Popescu, 2009). For example, almost all Spanish
nouns ending in -a are feminine, whereas Spanish
nouns ending in -o are usually masculine. These
assignments are non-arbitrary; indeed, Corbett
(1991, Ch. 4) provides a thorough typological
description of how phonology pervades gender
systems. We emphasize that these assignments
are not the subject of our investigation. Rather,
we are concerned with the relationship between
grammatical gender and lexical semantics—i.e.,
when asking why the Spanish word casa is
feminine, we do not consider that it ends in -a.

Finally, our investigation is related to that of
Kann and Wolf-Sonkin, which assumes that noun–
gender assignments are non-arbitrary and examines
the predictability of grammatical gender from lem-
matized word embeddings; in contrast, we investi-
gate the arbitrariness of noun–gender assignments.

2.2 Lexical Semantics via Word Embeddings

The NLP community has widely adopted word em-
beddings as way of representing lexical semantics.

The underlying motivation behind this adoption is
the observation that words with similar meanings
will be embedded as vectors that are closer together.
As we explain in §3, our investigation requires a
definition of lexical semantics that is independent
of grammatical gender. However, in many gendered
languages, word embeddings effectively encode
grammatical gender because this information is
trivially recoverable from distributional semantics.
For example, in Spanish, singular masculine nouns
tend to occur after the article el, whereas singular
feminine nouns tend to occur after the article la.
For this reason, we use an externally grounded
definition of lexical semantics: we create 5 oper-
ationalizations of each noun’s lexical semantics
using word embeddings in 5 genderless “donor”
languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin
Chinese, and Turkish). We use 5 languages that
are phylogenetically distinct and spoken in distinct
regions to minimize any spurious correlations.1

Our investigation is based on the linguistic
assumption that word embeddings in a genderless
“donor” language are a good proxy for genderless
lexical semantics. In practice, however, this
assumption is generally false: word embeddings
are largely a reflection of the text with which they
were trained. For example, the embedding of the
word snow will differ depending on whether the
training text was written by people near the equator
or people near the North Pole, even if both groups
speak the same language. Such differences will
be more pronounced for rare words, which are
arguably more language- and culture-specific than
many common words. For this reason, we limit the
scope of our investigation to only those inanimate
nouns that are likely to be used consistently across
different languages. To implement this limitation,
we use a Swadesh list (Buck, 1949; Swadesh,
1950, 1952, 1955, 1971/2006)—a list of words
constructed to contain only very frequent words
that are as close to culturally neutral as possible.
By limiting the scope of our investigation to only
those inanimate nouns that appear in a Swadesh
list, we can be reasonably confident that their
word embeddings in English, Japanese, Korean,

1It is natural to ask whether polysemy and homonymy
might result in spurious similarities. For example, in English,
the words fishN and fishV are homonymous, but in Mandarin
Chinese, the words yü (fishN ) and diào (fishV ) are not. If
patterns of homonymy in the genderless languages are very
different, but patterns of correlation between grammatical
gender and lexical semantics are very similar, then we can be
reasonably sure that the correlations are not due to homonymy.

3 Methodology

3.1 Data

We use Open Multilingual WordNet (Stamou et al.,
2004; Ordan and Wintner, 2007; Raffaelli et al.,
2008; Sagot and Fišer, 2008; Tufiş et al., 2008;
Piasecki et al., 2009; Simov and Osenova, 2010;
Toral et al., 2010; Bond and Paik, 2012; Fišer et al.,
2012; González-Agirre et al., 2012; de Paiva and
Rademaker, 2012; Rudnicka et al., 2012; Bond and
Foster, 2013; Garabı́k and Pileckytė, 2013; Oliver
et al., 2015)2 as our Swadesh list. This yields 18
gendered languages (Bulgarian, Catalan, Greek,
Spanish, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Croatian, Italian,
Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Roma-
nian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Ukranian),
of which 12 are from the Indo-European family
and 4 are not.3 For the 5 genderless languages (En-
glish, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and
Turkish), we use pre-trained, 50-dimensional word
embeddings from FASTTEXT (Bojanowski et al.,
2017; Grave et al., 2018).4 For each gendered–
genderless language pair, we limit the scope of our
investigation to only those inanimate nouns that
occur in both our Swadesh list and in FASTTEXT;
we provide the resulting counts in Table 1. Finally,
we randomly partition the set of nouns for each lan-
guage pair into a 75%–25% training–testing split.

3.2 Notation

We first establish the requisite notation. Let V`,m =
{1, . . . , V`,m} denote a set of integers representing
the inanimate nouns for gendered language ` and
genderless language m. Let G` denote the (arbi-
trarily ordered) genders in language `; for exam-

2http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/summx.html
3This imbalance as a limitation of our investigation.
4The FASTTEXT word embeddings were trained using

Common Crawl and Wikipedia data, using CBOW with po-
sition weights, with character n-grams of length 5. For more
information, see http://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html.

ple, let Gspanish = (MSC, FEM). Given an inani-
mate noun n ∈ V`,m, let g`(n) denote a one-hot
vector representing n’s grammatical gender in lan-
guage `, so that the ith entry corresponds to the ith

gender in G`. Similarly, let em(n) ∈ R50 denote
the 50-dimensional word embedding representing
the lexical semantics of n in language m. Let
G` ∈ R|G`|×V`,m collectively denote the inanimate
nouns’ grammatical genders in language `, so that
the nth column is g`(n), and let Em ∈ R50×V`,m
collectively denote the inanimate nouns’ lexical
semantics, so that the nth column is em(n). Fi-
nally, let Gtrain` and E

train
m respectively denote the

columns ofG` andEm that correspond to the inani-
mate nouns in the training set and letGtest` andE

test

respectively denote the columns of G` and Em that
correspond to the inanimate nouns in the testing set.

3.3 Canonical Correlation Analysis

CCA is a standard method for computing the
correlation between two multivariate random
variables. In our investigation, we are interested
in the correlation between grammatical gender and
lexical semantics for each gendered–genderless
language pair. To compute this correlation, we start
by solving the following optimization problem:

(a?,b?) = arg max
(a,b)

corr(a>Gtrain` ,b
>Etrainm ).

Although this optimization problem is non-convex,
it can be solved in closed form using singular
value decomposition (SVD). We use a standard
implementation of CCA (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Having found the projections a? ∈ R|G`| and
b? ∈ R50 that maximize the correlation, we then
use them to compute the correlation between gram-
matical gender and lexical semantics as follows:

ρ`,m = corr(a?
>Gtest` ,b

?>Etestm ).

To establish statistical significance, we follow
the approach of Monteiro et al. (2016). We create
B = 100, 000 permutations of the columns of

http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/summx.html
fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html


5737

Gtrain` ; for each permutation b, we then repeat the
steps above to obtain ρ`,m; finally, we compute

p =
1 +

∑B
b=1 δ(ρ

b
`,m ≥ ρ`,m)

B + 1
.

Because our investigation involves testing 90
different hypotheses, we use Bonferroni correc-
tion (Dror et al., 2017)—i.e., we multiply p by
90. If the resulting Bonferroni-corrected p-value
is small, then we can reject the null hypothesis
that there is no correlation between grammatical
gender and lexical semantics for that language pair.

Secondarily, we investigate semantic similarities
between the 18 languages’ gender systems by
analyzing their projections of lexical semantics.
For each pair of gendered languages ` and `′, we
compute the correlation (cosine distance) between
b?` and b

?
`′ for each of the 5 genderless languages.

4 Results

We find a significant correlation between gram-
matical gender and lexical semantics (i.e., the
Bonferroni-corrected p-value is less than 0.05) for
55 of the 90 gendered–genderless language pairs.
These results are depicted in Figure 1. For Slovak,
Croatian, and Ukranian, we find no correlation for
any of the genderless languages; for Slovenian, we
find a significant correlation for only Mandarin Chi-
nese. We suspect that these results are due the rela-
tively small number of inanimate nouns considered
for each of these language pairs (see Table 1 for the
counts). We also find slightly different patterns of
correlation for the different genderless languages

and lexical semantics for each of the 90 gendered–
genderless language pairs (∗ indicates significance).

that we use to create our 5 operationalizations of
lexical semantics. For Japanese, we find significant
correlations for 13 of the 18 gendered languages;
for English and Chinese, we find significant correla-
tions for 12; for Korean and Turkish, we find signif-
icant correlations for 9 of the gendered languages.

For each pair of gendered languages ` and `′, Fig-
ure 2 depicts the the correlation (cosine distance)
between b?` and b

?
`′ for English. We find higher

correlations for pairs of languages that are phyloge-
netically similar. For example, French has higher
correlations with Spanish and Italian than with Pol-
ish. This is likely because phylogenetically simi-
lar languages exhibit historical similarities in their
gender systems as a result of a common linguistic
origin (Fodor, 1959; Ibrahim, 2014; Stump, 2015).

5 Conclusion

Our investigation is the first to quantitatively
demonstrate that there is a significant correlation
between grammatical gender and lexical semantics
for inanimate nouns. Although our results provide
evidence for the non-arbitrariness of noun–gender
assignments, they must be contextualized. In
contrast to animate nouns, it is not clear that a
single cross-linguistic category explains our results.
Moreover, we limit the scope of our investigation to
frequent inanimate nouns. These nouns tend to be
distributed across genders, whereas less frequent
inanimate nouns tend to be assigned to a single gen-
der (Dye et al., 2015). We leave the investigation
of less frequent inanimate nouns for future work.
