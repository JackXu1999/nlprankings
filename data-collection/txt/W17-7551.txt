Keynote Lecture-3
Towards Abstractive Summarization

Vasudev Verma
International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India

In this talk, I will be sharing our research journey of building summarization engines to produce various
flavors of summaries. Starting from single document summarization, our experience of building multi-
document summarization (MDS),  query focused MDS,  Update  or Progressive summarization,  guided
summarization,  comparison summarization and personalized summarization systems can be seen as a
movement from Extraction based to abstraction based summary generation. We have used variations of
Relevance Based Language Model (RBLM) along with external knowledge sources, dependency parsing
and  more  recently  deep  learning  techniques  in  building  these  systems.  Since  2006,  our  team  has
consistently performed well and ranked as a top team in various tracks of DUC (Document Understanding
Conference) and TAC (Text Analysis Conference) conferences conducted by NIST. I will also discuss our
recent attempts to create semi-abstractive summarization models using natural language processing based
approaches as well as deep learning based approaches.
