Abstract

This paper presents the identification of for-
mulaic sequences in the reference corpus of
spoken Slovenian and their annotation in terms
of syntactic structure, pragmatic function and
lexicographic relevance. The annotation cam-
paign, specific in terms of setting, subjec-
tivity and the multifunctionality of items un-
der investigation, resulted in a preliminary
lexicon of formulaic sequences in spoken
Slovenian with immediate potential for future
explorations in formulaic language research.
This is especially relevant for the notable
number of identified multi-word expressions
with discourse-structuring and stance-marking
functions, which have often been overlooked
by traditional phraseology research.

1 Introduction

There has been an extensive body of research on
the formulaic nature of language in the last three
decades (Wray, 2013) exposing the large number
of multi-word combinations that speakers seem to
process as single vocabulary units (Sinclair, 1991;
Wray). In addition to the most commonly stud-
ied groups of multi-word expressions, such as id-
ioms (e.g. break a leg) and collocations (e.g. heavy
rain), corpus-driven research (Biber, 2009; Con-
klin and Schmitt, 2012) has shown that formulaic
status can also be attributed to frequently recur-
ring sequences of words (variously termed formu-
laic sequences or lexical bundles), which are not
necessarily structurally or semantically complete
(e.g. this means that).

Although there is a general consensus on the
need to systematically identify and formalize for-
mulaic sequences, both for native and non-native
speakers of a language (Simpson-Vlach and Ellis,
2010; Brooke et al., 2015), there has been less dis-
cussion on the optimal approach to their linguistic
description and (sub)categorization. In addition,

few studies that do involve some kind of quan-
tification of formulaic sequences by syntactic, se-
mantic or other properties, rarely report on the
methodological issues related to the categorization
itself.

To provide insight on the nature of formulaic
language in (spoken) Slovenian, and the method-
ological aspects related to its linguistic categoriza-
tion in general, this paper presents the annotation
of formulaic sequences in the reference corpus of
spoken Slovenian in terms of syntactic structure,
pragmatic function and semantic relevance. Af-
ter a short presentation of the corpus (Section 2)
and the formulaic sequence extraction (Section 3),
we present the annotation workflow and the guide-
lines in Section 4. Given several distinct aspects
of this annotation campaign, a detailed analysis
of inter-annotator disagreements is given in Sec-
tion 5, followed by the presentation and discussion
of the resulting list of annotated sequences in Sec-
tion 6.

2 GOS corpus

GOS is the reference corpus of spoken Slove-
nian including approximately 120 hours (1 mil-
lion tokens) of spontaneous speech in different ev-
eryday situations in public (radio and TV shows,
school lessons and lectures) and non-public set-
tings (meetings, consultations, services, private
conversations).

The recordings, balanced for communication
channels, situations and speaker demograph-
ics, have been manually transcribed in both
pronunciation-based and standardized spelling
(Verdonik et al., 2013). In this research, version
1.0 of the GOS corpus was used, freely avail-
able for download from the CLARIN.SI repository
(Zwitter Vitez et al., 2013).1

3 Identification of formulaic sequences

3.1 N-gram extraction
To generate the list of formulaic sequences in GOS
corpus, the LIST extraction tool (Krsnik et al.,
2019) was used to extract all n-grams of length 2-5
tokens (words with normalized spelling) occurring
above the frequency threshold of 20 occurrences
per million. In addition to frequency counts, the
tool also calculates the strength of association be-
tween words in a given n-gram, using three effect-
size measures (Dice coeeficient, point-wise mu-
tual information, and cubic mutual information)
and two significance measures (t-score, simple
log-likelihood), extended for multi-word combi-
nations (Ramisch et al., 2010), as well.

3.2 N-gram ranking
There is no uniform consensus on the optimal
method for measuring formulaicity in a language,
with methods ranging from raw frequency counts
to specific association measures (Biber, 2009;
Gries, 2012), producing only partially overlapping
recommendations of the most salient multi-word
units in a language (Evert, 2009), including Slove-
nian (Dobrovoljc, 2017). Instead of opting for
a single method, we narrowed the initial list of
frequently recurring n-grams to the union of top-
1,000 candidates ranked by each of the six meth-
ods (frequency, Dice, t-score, LL, MI, MI3). This
amounted to the final list of 2,374 formulaic se-
quences for subsequent annotation (Table 1).

2-gram 1,808 ja ja

Total 2,374

tom: “yes yes”, “it seems”, “given the fact that”, “eight
zero eight zero zero”.)

4 Annotation of formulaic sequences

The list of formulaic sequences has been split
into multicolumn spreadsheets containing the se-
quences, slots for predefined labels and the hyper-
links to the corresponding concordances in GOS.

line concordancer at www.korpus-gos.net.

Each spreadsheet was manually annotated by two
independent annotators (trained native speakers)
based on the guidelines summarized below, with
disagreements adjudicated by an expert third an-
notator.

4.1 Syntactic structure
In terms of syntactic structure, the sequences have
been categorized into structurally complete and in-
complete sequences. Structurally complete are the
sequences that can be attributed a specific syntac-
tic role in a utterance. This includes complete ut-
terances or phrases (e.g. to je res “that’s true”, no
no “well well”), sentence elements, such as pred-
icates (boš videl “you-will see”), predicate argu-
ments (glava družine “head of the family”) and ad-
juncts (pol ure “half an hour”), as well as modifiers
(bolj ali manj “more or less”), multi-word con-
junctions (zaradi tega ker “given the fact that”),
and connectives (tako da “so that”).

Incomplete sequences, on the other hand, in-
clude fragments of the above constructions (da
bi se “that they”, minute čez “minutes past”), in-
cluding speech-specific sequences involving fillers
(eee in eee “uhm and uhm”), discourse markers (ja
tako da “yes so”) and repetitions (kaj kaj “what
what”).

4.2 Pragmatic function
In terms of pragmatic function, the guidelines fol-
lowed previous influential functional taxonomies
(Simpson-Vlach and Ellis, 2010; Biber et al.,
2004), in which formulaic sequences are divided
into referential expressions that reference physi-
cal or abstract entities and their properties (e.g.
to je bilo “that was”, v skladu z “in line with”,
uradni list št. “official gazette no.’́), stance ex-
pressions that express attitudes or assessments of
certainty (e.g. na nek način “in a way”, se mi zdi “I
think”, naj bi bil “is supposed to”, ja ne vem “well
I don’t know”), and discourse organizers that con-
tribute to textual and interactional coherence (e.g.
kar pomeni da “which means that”, to se pravi
“that is to say”, tako da je “so that is”, ja ja ja
“yes yes yes”).

4.3 Lexicographic relevance
In order to determine which formulaic sequences
are potentially relevant for inclusion in future dic-
tionaries and similar lexical resources for Slove-
nian, the annotators were asked to label the se-
quence in terms of its semantic relevance, i.e.

www.korpus-gos.net

whether the sequence is a multi-word expression
they would expect to find in a general dictionary
intended for both native and non-native speakers
of Slovenian. Specifically, they were instructed to
identify multi-word expressions as opposed to free
word combinations, ranging from collocations (na
internetu “on the Internet”) to fixed multi-word
units with denominative (javni sektor “public sec-
tor”), syntactic (kljub temu da “despite the fact
that”), or pragmatic functions (tako rekoč “so
to speak”, dame in gospodje “ladies and gentle-
men”), regardless of semantic transparency.

4.4 Disambiguation

Only one label was allowed per category. In case
of ambiguity, the annotators were advised to in-
spect a random sample of the concordances pro-
vided and decide for the most frequently occur-
ring structural or functional interpretation, i.e. a
primary interpretation for the given string. For se-
mantic relevance, on the other hand, the annotators
were instructed to label a sequence as relevant re-
gardless of the frequency of this particular usage.

5 Inter-annotator agreement

On average, the two annotators agreed on
81.6% of categorization decisions, with disagree-
ments distributed similarly across different n-gram
lengths. This confirms the relatively high level of
subjectivity involved in this annotation task, spe-
cific not just in terms of categories (intuitive inter-
pretations of abstract classes), but also in terms of
items under investigations (highly ambiguous and
multifunctional), and the annotation setting itself
(lack of immediate context, simple guidelines).

As expected, best inter-annotator agreement
was observed for syntactic structure (86% absolute
agreement, Cohen’s Kappa 0.66), where annota-
tors mostly disagreed on the structure of sequences
occurring as both syntactically complete and in-
complete units with similar frequency distribution
(e.g. veš kaj “you know what”). Other frequent
groups with structure disagreement include predi-
cates with transitive verbs (bom rekel “I-will say”),
numerals (deset tisoč “ten thousand”), repetitions
(dobro dobro “good good”), fragments of prepo-
sitional phrases (današnji dan “(on) this day”), as
well as strings of discourse connectives (in s tem
“and thus”), and clause stems (kar pomeni “which
means”).

For pragmatic function, the moderate inter-

annotator agreement (81% agreement, Cohen’s
Kappa 0.54) was mostly due to disagreement
on the referential or discourse-organizing role of
specific groups of sequences, such as sentence
fragments containing discourse particles and con-
nectives (zato je “so is”, eee mi “uhm us”),
anaphors (na ta način “in this way”), and words
with metadiscursive meaning (govorimo o “we-
are-talking about”, v nadaljevanju “in the con-
tinuation”). Similarly, expressions with compet-
ing referential and stance-marking interpretations
include sequences with modal verbs and adverbs
(morati “have to”, lahko “can”), verbs of reason-
ing (vedeti “know”, misliti “think”) and the condi-
tional auxiliary bi “would”.

The lowest agreement was observed for seman-
tic relevance (78% agreement, Cohen’s Kappa
0.43), where the annotators disagreed on the rel-
evance of semantically bleach multi-word units,
such as discourse particles (bi rekel “say”), in-
terjections (a ja “oh really”, daj no “come on”)
and general extenders (ali kaj “or what”); modi-
fied connectives (tudi če “even if”, takrat ko “ex-
actly when”); institutionalized matrix clauses (kar
pomeni da “which means that”, predlagam da “I
suggest that”), as well as collocations involving
numerals (petnajst minut “fifteen minutes”), deic-
tics (vse to “all this”, z drugimi “with others”) and
auxiliary verbs (bomo naredili “we-will do”).

For all three categories, the competing annota-
tions were resolved by an expert third annotator.
However, given the high level of ambiguity and
subjectivity inherent to the annotation task, the in-
formation on the degree of inter-annotator agree-
ment for each decision has been preserved in the
final data release.2

6 List of annotated sequences

In general, the distribution of specific annota-
tion labels in the resulting list of formulaic se-
quences (summarized in Table 2) confirms pre-
vious empirical observations that formulaic se-
quences mostly consist of structurally incomplete
n-grams (72.2%) with referential function (72.0%)
that do not correspond to traditional dictionary-
relevant multi-word expressions (74.6%). Specif-
ically, 50.6% of sequences (1,201) have been la-
belled with this exact combination of characteris-

GOS by type.

Nevertheless, the annotated list reveals several
other groups of formulaic language in spoken
Slovenian with potential relevance for further lin-
guistic inquiries and applications. From the point
of syntactic structure, the structurally complete
sequences (27.8%) include a diverse set of con-
structions, ranging from sentence elements, such
as predicates (smo rekli “we-have said”), and ad-
juncts (v Sloveniji “in Slovenia”, dve leti “two
years”), to various types of modifiers (še en “an-
other”) and sentence-peripheral multi-word ex-
pressions. This last group also corresponds to the
function-related findings that show a notable share
of formulaic sequences with discourse-organizing
(15.1%, e.g. tako da “so that”, na primer “for ex-
ample”, a ne “right”, dobro jutro “good morning”)
and stance-marking functions (12.9%, e.g. se mi
zdi “it seems”, mislim da “I think”, po svoje “in
a way”), confirming the importance of discourse
structuring, interaction management and speaker
mitigation in speech.

In line with the observations above, the sub-
set of sequences recognized as dictionary-relevant
(25.4%) includes a heterogeneous set of speech-
specific multi-word expressions, such as formu-
laic replies and questions (kaj še “what else” točno
to “exactly”, kaj pa jaz vem “what do I know”),
expressions of politeness (hvala lepa “thank you
very much”), temporal expressions (na začetku
“in the beginning”, še zmeraj “still”, do zdaj “un-
til now”), intensifiers (zelo zelo “very very”, še
bolj “even more”), discourse-structuring devices
(pri tem “in doing so”, prav tako “as well”),
hedging expressions (ne vem “I don’t know”, v
bistvu “actually”), colloquial expressions (na hitro
“quickly”, ful dobro “awesome”), as well as other

expressions related to event-specific topics (na
televiziji “on TV”, predsednik vlade “prime min-
ister”, v letošnji sezoni “this season”). Although
the large majority of dictionary-relevant sequences
consists of syntactically complete units, some in-
complete structures have also been marked as rel-
evant, such as multi-word prepositions (ne glede
na “regardless of”), verbs and phrases with typical
prepositions (govorimo o “talk about”, pride do
“come to”, hvala lepa za “thanks for”, priložnost
za “a chance to”) and discourse-structuring sen-
tence stems (to pomeni da “this means that”, če
pogledamo “if we look at”).

7 Conclusion

This paper presented the identification of the most
frequent and statistically prominent word n-grams
in the reference spoken corpus of Slovenian and
their annotation in terms of syntactic structure,
pragmatic function and lexicographic relevance.
The annotation campaign resulted in a preliminary
lexicon of formulaic sequences in (spoken) Slove-
nian with a high potential for future explorations
in both theoretical and applied formulaic language
research.

In particular in relation to the latter, our re-
search represents an important addition to existing
corpus-based collections of multi-word units in
Slovenian (Gantar et al., 2016; Kosem et al., 2018;
Ljubešić et al., 2015), which predominantly focus
on units with propositional meaning. The large
number of formulaic expressions with discourse-
organizing and stance-marking functions iden-
tified in this research, however, confirms the
need for future investigations of non-propositional
multi-word expressions, as well.

In doing so, we plan to extend our work to
the identification and annotation of formulaic se-
quences in written texts, drawing on the findings
and observations presented above. In addition
to the immediate benefits to lexicography, lan-
guage teaching and natural language processing,
an exhaustive inventory of formulaic sequences
in Slovenian will also enable further research on
methods for their identification and categorization.
This also includes a comparison with manual for-
mulaic sequence identification in corpora, bring-
ing insight to issues related to instance-level anno-
tation, as well.
