Purity Homophily in Social Networks - Invited Talk

Does sharing moral values encourage people to con-
nect and form communities? The importance of
moral homophily (love of same) has been recog-
nized by social scientists, but the types of moral
similarities that drive this phenomenon are still un-
known. In this talk, I will present a series of exper-
iments (both large-scale, observational social-media
analyses and behavioral lab experiments) that inves-
tigate which types of moral similarities influence tie
formations. Our results indicate that social network
processes reflect moral selection, and both online
and offline differences in moral purity concerns are
particularly predictive of social distance.

Dr. Morteza Dehghani is an Assistant Professor
of psychology, computer science and the Brain and
Creativity Institute at University of Southern Cali-
fornia. His research spans the boundary between
psychology and artificial intelligence, as does his
education. His work investigates properties of cog-
nition by using documents of the social discourse,
such as narratives, social media, transcriptions of
speeches and news articles, in conjunction to behav-
ioral studies.
