Abstract 

This paper deals with a seldom studied object/oblique alternation phenomenon in Japanese, 
which. We call this the bump alternation. This phenomenon, first discussed by Sadanobu 
(1990), is similar to the English with/against alternation. For example, compare hit the wall 
with the bat [=immobile-as-direct-object frame] to hit the bat against the wall [=mobile-as-
direct-object frame]). However, in the Japanese version, the case frame remains constant. 
Although we fundamentally question Sadanobu’s acceptability judgment, we also claim that 
the causation type (i.e., whether the event is an instance of onset or extended causation; Talmy, 
1988; 2000) could make an improvement. An extended causative interpretation could improve 
the acceptability of the otherwise awkward immobile-as-direct-object frame. We examined this 
claim through a rating study, and the results showed an interaction between the Causation type 
(extended/onset) and the Object type (mobile/immobile) in the direction we predicted. We 
propose that a perspective shift on what is moving causes the “extended causation” advantage. 

1 Introduction 
There are many types of object/oblique alternation. A representative one is locative alternation: 
 
(1) a.  Jack sprayed paint onto the wall.   [mobile/theme object] 
 b.  Jack sprayed the wall with paint.   [immobile/location object] 

(Levin, 1993: 51) 
 
Locative alternation is the alternation between a theme-object frame, in which the verb selects the 
mobile theme as the direct object, and a location-object frame, in which the verb selects the immobile 
location (goal) as the direct object. 

The present paper deals with a much less studied alternation in Japanese, which we call the bump 
alternation. Sadanobu (1990) first studied this phenomenon under the label tama-ate daikan (‘bullet-
hit’ alternation). We can regard this to be a variant of locative alternation because it is an alternation 
between a mobile theme and an immobile location. This is similar to what Levin (1993) called the 
with/against alternation, as illustrated below: 
 
(2) a. Brian hit the stick against the fence.  [mobile object] 
 b.  Brian hit the fence with the stick.  [immobile object] 

(Levin, 1993: 67) 
 
However, what is peculiar about the Japanese version is that the case marking remains constant, as 
shown in (3).

(3) a. Tama-o    mato-ni  ateru      [mobile object] 
  bullet-ACC target-DAT  hit 
  ‘(lit.) hit the bullet to the target’ = ‘make the bullet hit the target’ 
 b. Mato-o    tama-ni  ateru      [immobile object] 
  target-ACC bullet-DAT  hit 
  ‘(lit.) hit the target to a bullet’ = ‘hit the target with a bullet’ 

(Sadanobu, 1990) 
 
The English translation for (3a) is awkward, but Japanese ateru means ‘to cause something to hit 
somewhere.’ This is much more natural with a mobile/theme object, whereas the immobile/location 
object (3b) sounds more awkward (we will get back to this issue shortly). In this sense, ateru may be 
closer to English bump than hit, which is the reason why we tentatively call this alternation the bump 
alternation. In any case, what is peculiar here is that in (3b), the accusative-dative frame remains 
constant. Sadanobu (1990) claims that both frames denote the same event in which the agent causes 
the mobile object to move, and then bump into the immobile one. Thus, in this alternation, the case 
marking for the two objects is switchable without changing the interpretation. Such an alternation is 
crosslinguistically peculiar, and thus hard to translate directly in English. However, according to our 
intuition (as native speakers of Japanese), Sadanobu’s acceptability judgment of (3b) is questionable. 
It sounds unacceptable when interpreted in the same way as (3a). Thus, the existence of this 
alternation is at stake. 

If this alternation were simply an erroneous observation by Sadanobu, not much would be 
interesting about it. However, it seems to us that this type of alternation can be more acceptable by 
controlling the type of the mobile object. For example: 
 
(4) a.  Doamiraa-o   dentyuu-ni   ateta/butuketa.    [mobile object] 
  door.mirror-ACC utility.pole-DAT hit/bumped 
  ‘bumped the door mirror against the utility pole’ 
 b.  Dentyuu-o   doamiraa-ni   ateta/butuketa.    [immobile object] 
  utility.pole-ACC door.mirror-DAT hit/bumped 
  ‘bumped the utility pole with the door mirror’ 
 
In (4), doamiraa ‘door mirror’ is the mobile entity and dentyuu ‘utility pole’ is the immobile one. 
Sentence (4b) sounds more acceptable than (3b) even though dentyuu ‘utility pole’ is obviously 
immobile. Why is it easier for immobile dentyuu ‘utility pole’ in (4b) to appear as the direct object 
than mato ‘target’ in (3b)? 

In order to account for the difference in acceptability judgment between (3b) and (4b), we claim 
that different kinds of mobile themes induce different types of causation: namely, onset and extended 
causations (Talmy, 1988; 2000). The former type consists of two stages, i.e., the agent’s causative 
action, followed by an autonomous event of the theme’s movement. 

 
(5)  The carton slid (all the way) across the grass from a (single) gust of wind blowing on it. 

(Talmy, 2000: 493) 
 
In (5), an autonomous event (the carton’s movement) follows a causative situation (a single gust of 
wind blowing). This event consists of two such stages, so this is an onset causation event. On the other 
hand, the latter type, extended causation, depicts a situation where “the caused event takes place 
exactly during the duration of the causing event” (Talmy, 2000: 493–494). 

 
(6)  The carton slid across the grass from the wind blowing on it (steadily). 

(Talmy, 2000: 494) 
 

The example in (6), unlike (5), depicts a situation in which the carton continues to move while the 
wind blows on it. Such synchronicity of the causative event and the movement of the theme are 
labeled extended causation.

In terms of the causation type, we can regard the event in (3) to be an instance of onset causation. 
The agent pulls the trigger of a gun, which is the causative event; after that, the bullet autonomously 
starts to move to the target, without help from the agent. Thus, the entire event can be construed as 
consisting of two stages, and thus can classify it as an instance of onset causation. By contrast, in (4), 
the door mirror, which is part of a car, keeps moving all the while the agent drives the car. The 
movement of the door mirror and the agent’s causation always coincide. Thus, we can consider the 
event in (4) to be an instance of extended causation. 

We hypothesize that the bump alternation (more specifically, the immobile object variant) is more 
acceptable when the sentence denotes an extended causation. The reason is as follows. In the case of 
extended causation, the agent moves together with the mobile theme. This could trigger a perspective 
shift such that it makes us perceive the immobile entity as if it were a mobile one. For example, when 
you are driving and you approach a huge billboard, you may perceive that the billboard is coming 
closer even though it is not moving. The same may apply to the bump alternation with extended 
causation. In (4), even though the agent moves toward the immobile utility pole while driving a car 
(with door mirrors), it may be possible to perceive this situation in such a way that it is the immobile 
entity (the utility pole) that is moving toward the agent, eventually hitting the door mirror. The 
baseline assumption is that the bump alternation is not really an alternation; the bump verbs in 
Japanese only allow mobile objects. An apparent “alternation” is possible only when the immobile 
entity can appear as a mobile one. That is, it can occur only if the sentence denotes extended causation, 
but not when it denotes onset causation. If this hypothesis is on the right track, it follows that the 
immobile object frame with extended causation such as (4b) is more acceptable than the one with 
onset causation such as (3b). Our research question is whether there is an interaction between the 
Causation type (whether the event’s interpretation involves onset or extended causation) and the 
Object type (whether the direct object is the mobile theme or immobile entity). In particular, we would 
like to examine whether the difference in Causation type affects the acceptability of the immobile 
object frame. 

2 Experiment 
In order to examine the questions shown above, we conducted a questionnaire experiment through 
Lancers, a crowdsourcing service in Japan similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk. As mentioned above, 
the current research question is whether an interaction arises between Causation type (onset/extended) 
and Object type (mobile/immobile). 

2.1 Methods 
Materials 
We prepared materials under a 2x2 factorial design. The first factor was the Causation type. We varied 
the mobile theme to permit interpretation of the causative event as either extended or onset causation. 
For example, if the mobile theme is an entity that someone is likely to throw, like a pebble or a ball, 
the event is likely an onset causation event. On the other hand, if the mobile theme is an entity that is 
likely to move along with the agent, such as a door mirror or a body part (like a shoulder or elbow), 
the event is interpreted as an extended causation event. The second factor was the Object type. In one 
situation, the accusative case -o marks the mobile theme, while the immobile is dative-marked with –
ni. In another case, the immobile object is accusative-marked, with the mobile theme being dative-
marked. The verbs used in this experiment were either ateru ‘to make hit’ or butukeru ‘bump.’ Some 
sample materials are shown below: 

 
(7) Extended causation conditions: 

 a.  Yopparai-ga    ganmen-o  kootuuhyoosiki-ni  ateta. [mobile object] 
drunken.man-NOM face-ACC   traffic.sign-DAT   hit

 b. Yopparai-ga    kootuuhyoosiki-o   ganmen-ni  ateta. [immobile object] 
drunken.man-NOM traffic.sign-ACC   face-DAT hit 
‘A drunken man hit the traffic sign with his face.’

Onset causation conditions: 
  c. Yopparai-ga    isitubute-o  kootuuhyoosiki-ni  ateta. [mobile object] 

drunken.man-NOM pebble-ACC traffic.sigh-DAT  hit 
‘A drunken man hit a pebble against the traffic sign (=made a pebble hit the sign).’ 

  d. Yopparai-ga    kootuuhyoosiki-o  isitubute-ni  ateta. [immobile object] 
drunken.man-NOM traffic.sign-ACC  pebble-DAT hit 
‘A drunken man hit the traffic sign with a pebble.’ 

 
(8) Extended causation conditions: 
  a. Musuko-ga  kata-o    genkantobira-ni   butuketa. 

son-NOM  shoulder-ACC entrance.door-DAT  bumped 
‘My son bumped his shoulder against the entrance door.’ 

  b. Musuko-ga  genkantobira-o    kata-ni    butuketa. 
son-NOM  entrance.door-ACC shoulder-DAT bumped 
‘My son bumped the entrance door with his shoulder.’ 

 Onset causation conditions: 
  c. Musuko-ga  setubun-no mame-o      genkantobira-ni  butuketa.   [mobile object] 

son-NOM     setubun-GEN beans-ACC  entrance.door-DAT bumped 
‘(lit.) My son bumped beans for the setubun festival to the entrance door.’ 
= ‘My son threw beans for the setubun festival against the entrance door.’ 

  d. Musuko-ga  genkantobira-o    setubun-no    mame-ni  butuketa.   [immobile object] 
son-NOM  entrance.door-ACC setubun-GEN beans-DAT bumped 
‘(lit.) My son bumped the entrance door with beans for the setubun festival.’ 
= ‘My son hit the entrance door with beans for the setubun festival.’ 

 
Participants and Procedures 
Participants were 105 native speakers of Japanese, recruited on-line via Lancers. They were asked to 
rate the naturalness of each sentence on a five-point Likert scale by clicking one of radio buttons 
numbered 1-5, with ‘5’ corresponding to ‘natural’ and ‘1’ to ‘unnatural’. They were instructed to rate 
each item quickly following their intuitions. 54 yen was paid for each participant after the task.  

The total of 16x4 sentences were evenly distributed into four lists with a Latin square design. Each 
list also included the same 32 fillers, among which 11 sentences were unacceptable and 21 were 
acceptable. The total of 48 sentences were shuffled in a fixed, pseudo-random order. Additional four 
lists that contained the sentences in a reverse order were prepared to counterbalance potential ordering 
effects. Each participant was assigned one of the eight lists. Each list was rated by 10 to 15 
participants. 

2.2 Predictions 
Because ateru ‘hit’ and butukeru ‘bump’ both by default select a mobile theme as the direct object, 

we predicted there would be no significant difference in the acceptability of the mobile object 
conditions between the two causation types. The immobile object conditions were generally less 
acceptable. However, our hypothesis predicted that the possibility of interpreting the event as extended 
causation should improve the acceptability, compared with the onset causation conditions. 

2.3 Results and Discussion 
The data from one subject was excluded from the analyses because all sentences were rated 5. The 
grand mean of all items was 2.9. The mean rating of each condition is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Mean Acceptability Ratings for Four Conditions 

 
It is obvious from the figure that the mean ratings of the immobile object conditions were overall 

much lower than the means of the mobile object conditions. This fits our intuition that these bump 
verbs in Japanese select the mobile-object frame by default. A linear mixed effects model analysis 
conducted with maximal random effects structure (cf. Barr et al., 2013) revealed main effects of the 
onset type (t=19.45) and the causative type (t=2.32), as in Table 1. Most importantly, there was a 
significant interaction (t=-2.70). Planned paired comparisons revealed a highly significant main effect 
of the Causation type in the immobile conditions (t=3.91), but no significant effect in the mobile 
conditions (t=-0.42). These findings conform to our hypothesis that the extended causation may 
improve the acceptability of an otherwise very awkward immobile-as-direct-object frame in the bump 
alternation in Japanese. We assume that the reason for this is that the extended causation can trigger a 
perspective shift such that the immobile object comes across as a mobile entity.

3 Conclusion 
The results revealed a significant interaction between Causation type and Object type in the bump 

alternation in Japanese. This extended causation makes the immobile object more acceptable 
compared with the case of onset causation. We interpret this result to be evidence for our hypothesis 
that extended causation could let us interpret the immobile object as if it were a mobile object. This 
occurs because the agent moves with the mobile object toward the immobile object, enabling a 

123



perspective shift with respect to what is moving. This in turn improves the acceptability of the 
immobile-as-direct-object frame in the bump alternation, due to reinterpretation of the immobile as 
mobile. In other words, the immobile-as-direct-object frame comes across as the mobile-as-direct-
object frame. Onset causation does not trigger such a perspective shift. 

Our finding also raises questions about the validity of introspective acceptability judgments 
regarding various alternation phenomena reported in linguistics literature (see Bresnan et al., 2007 for 
a criticism in this line). For example, in our case, we found a significant improvement in the 
acceptability of the immobile object frame by introducing extended causation. However, the mean 
acceptability rate was 1.88 for the immobile object × the extended causation condition, which is very 
low. Thus, it is not clear if we can state that this bump alternation phenomenon in Japanese really 
exists. We may also find other cases where quantitative studies do not support the acceptability 
judgments reported in theoretical literature of alternation phenomena. 

Another implication of this finding is that previous theoretical literature may have focused too 
closely on analyzing the semantics of verbs when it comes to alternation phenomena. A finer-grained 
analysis is desirable, especially on the effects of pragmatic interpretation induced by combining the 
verb and its arguments. This study demonstrated that simply changing the type of mobile theme could 
influence the acceptability judgment. Future research should shed more light on the contribution of 
nominal semantics to the interpretation of alternation phenomena.
