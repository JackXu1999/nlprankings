Abstract

Political identity is often manifested in lan-
guage variation, but the relationship between
the two is still relatively unexplored from a
quantitative perspective. This study exam-
ines the use of Catalan, a language local
to the semi-autonomous region of Catalonia
in Spain, on Twitter in discourse related to
the 2017 independence referendum. We cor-
roborate prior findings that pro-independence
tweets are more likely to include the local
language than anti-independence tweets. We
also find that Catalan is used more often
in referendum-related discourse than in other
contexts, contrary to prior findings on lan-
guage variation. This suggests a strong role
for the Catalan language in the expression of
Catalonian political identity.

1 Introduction

Social identity is often constructed through lan-
guage use, and variation in language there-
fore reflects social differences within the popu-
lation (Labov, 1963). In a multilingual setting,
an individual’s preference to use a local language
rather than the national one may reflect their polit-
ical stance, as the local language can have strong
ties to cultural and political identity (Moreno et al.,
1998; Crameri, 2017). The role of linguistic
identity is enhanced in extreme situations such
as referenda, where the voting decision may be
driven by identification with a local culture or lan-
guage (Schmid, 2001).

In October 2017, the semi-autonomous region
of Catalonia held a referendum on independence
from Spain, where 92% of respondents voted for
independence (Fotheringham, 2017). To deter-
mine the role of the local language Catalan in

this setting, we apply the methodology used by
Shoemark et al. (2017) in the context of the 2014
Scottish independence referendum to a dataset of
tweets related to the Catalonian referendum. We
use the phenomenon of code-switching between
Catalan and Spanish to pursue the following re-
search questions in order to understand the choice
of language in the context of the referendum:

1. Is a speaker’s stance on independence
strongly associated with the rate at which
they use Catalan?

2. Does Catalan usage vary depending on
whether the discussion topic is related to the
referendum, and on the intended audience?

For the first question, our findings are similar
to those in the Scottish case: pro-independence
tweets are more likely to be written in Catalan than
anti-independence tweets, and pro-independence
Twitter users are more likely to use Catalan than
anti-independence Twitter users (Section 4). With
respect to the second question, we find that Twitter
users are more likely to use Catalan in referendum-
related tweets, and that they are more likely to use
Catalan in tweets with a broader audience (Section
5).1

Code-switching, the alternation between lan-
guages within conversation (Poplack, 1980), has
been shown to be the product of grammatical
factors, such as syntax (Pfaff, 1979), and so-
cial factors, such as intended audience (Gumperz,

1977). While many studies have examined code-
switching in the spoken context (Auer, 2013), so-
cial media platforms such as Twitter provide an
opportunity to study code-switching in online dis-
cussions (Androutsopoulos, 2015). In the on-
line context, choice of language may reflect the
writer’s intended audience (Kim et al., 2014) or
identity (Christiansen, 2015; Lavendar, 2017), and
the explicit social signals in online discussions
such as @-replies can be leveraged to test claims
about code-switching at a large scale (Nguyen
et al., 2015).

A relatively unexplored area of code-switching
behavior is politically-motivated code-switching,
which we assume has a different set of constraints
compared to everyday code-switching. With re-
spect to political separatism, Shoemark et al.
(2017) studied the use of Scots, a language local
to Scotland, in the context of the 2014 Scotland
independence referendum. They found that Twit-
ter users who openly supported Scottish indepen-
dence were more likely to incorporate words from
Scots in their tweets. They also found that Twitter
users who tweeted about the referendum were less
likely to use Scots in referendum-related tweets
than in non-referendum tweets.

This study considers the similar scenario which
took place in 2017 vis-à-vis the semi-autonomous
region of Catalonia. Our main methodological di-
vergence from Shoemark et al. (2017) relates to
the linguistic phenomenon at hand: while Scots
is mainly manifested as interleaving individual
words within English text (code-mixing), Catalan
is a distinct language which, when used, usually
replaces Spanish altogether for the entire tweet
(code-switching).

3 Data

The initial set of tweets for this study, T , was
drawn from a 1% Twitter sample mined between

January 1 and October 31, 2017, covering nearly a
year of activity before the referendum, as well as
its immediate aftermath.2

The first step in building this dataset was to
manually develop a seed set of hashtags related
to the referendum. Through browsing referendum
content on Twitter, the following seed hashtags
were selected: #CataluñaLibre, #Independenci-
aCataluña, #CataluñaEsEspaña, #EspañaUnida,
and #CatalanReferendum. All tweets contain-
ing at least one of these hashtags were extracted
from T , and the top 1,000 hashtags appearing
in the resulting dataset were manually inspected
for relevance to the referendum. From these
co-occurring hashtags, we selected a set of 46
hashtags and divided it into pro-independence,
anti-independence, and neutral hashtags, based on
translations of associated tweet content.3 After in-
cluding ASCII-equivalent variants of special char-
acters, as well as lowercased variants, our final
hashtag set comprises 111 unique strings.

Next, all tweets containing any referendum
hashtag were extracted from T , yielding 190,061
tweets. After removing retweets and tweets from
users whose tweets frequently contained URLs
(i.e., likely bots), our final “Catalonian Indepen-
dence Tweets” (CT) dataset is made up of 11,670
tweets from 10,498 users (cf. the Scottish refer-
endum set IT with 59,664 tweets and 18,589 users
in Shoemark et al. (2017)). 36 referendum-related
hashtags appear in the filtered dataset. They are
shown with their frequencies (including variants)
in Table 1 (cf. the 47 hashtags and similar fre-
quency distribution in Table 1 of Shoemark et al.
(2017)).

To address the control condition, all authors of

cases we consulted news articles relating to the hashtag.

137



tweets in the CT dataset were collected to form a
set U , and all other tweets in T written by these
users were extracted into a control dataset (XT) of
45,222 tweets (cf. the 693,815 control tweets in
Table 6 of Shoemark et al. (2017)).

The CT dataset is very balanced with respect
to the number of tweets per user: only four users
contribute over ten tweets (max = 14) and only 16
have more than five. The XT dataset also has only
a few “power” users, such that nine users have
over 1,000 tweets (max = 3,581) and a total of
173 have over 100 tweets. Since the results are
macro-averaged over all users, these few power
users should not significantly distort the findings.

Language Identification. This study compares
variation between two distinct languages, Catalan
and Spanish. We used the langid language classifi-
cation package (Lui and Baldwin, 2012), based on
character n-gram frequencies, to identify the lan-
guage of all tweets in CT and XT. Tweets that were
not classified as either Spanish or Catalan with at
least 90% confidence were discarded. This thresh-
old was chosen by manual inspection of the langid
output. In the referendum dataset CT (control
set XT), langid confidently labeled 4,014 (56,892)
tweets as Spanish and 2,366 (10,178) as Catalan.
To address the possibility of code-mixing within
tweets, the first two authors manually annotated
a sample of 100 tweets, of which half were con-
fidently labeled as Spanish, and the other half as
Catalan. They found only two examples of poten-
tial code-mixing, both of Catalan words in Spanish
text.

4 Catalan Usage and Political Stance

The first research question concerns political
stance: do pro-independence users tweet in Cata-
lan at a higher rate than anti-independence users?

We analyze the relationship between language
use and stance on independence under two con-
ditions, comparing the use of Catalan among
pro-independence users vs. anti-independence
users in (1) opinionated referendum-related tweets
(tweets with Pro/Anti hashtags); and (2) all tweets.
These conditions address the possibilities that
the language distinction is relevant for pro/anti-
independence Twitter users in political discourse
and outside of political discourse, respectively.

Method. The first step is to divide the Twitter
users in U into pro-independence (PRO) and anti-

,

where N (u)pro (N

u that contain a pro- (anti-) independence hashtag.
The PRO user set (Upro) includes all users whose
pro-independence proportion was above or equal
to 75%, and the ANTI user set (Uanti) includes all
users whose pro-independence proportion was be-
low or equal to 25%. The counts of users and
tweets identified as either Spanish or Catalan are
presented in Table 2.

test statistic is then the difference in Catalan usage
between the pro- and anti-independence groups,
d = p̂pro − p̂anti.

To determine significance, the users are ran-
domly shuffled between the two groups to recom-
pute d over 100,000 iterations. The p-value is the
proportion of permutations in which the random-
ized test statistic was greater than or equal to the
original test statistic from the unpermuted data.

Results. Catalan is used more often among the
pro-independence users compared to the anti-
independence users, across both the hashtag-
only and all-tweet conditions. Table 3 shows
that the proportion of tweets in Catalan for pro-
independence users (p̂pro) is significantly higher
than the proportion for anti-independence users

138



(p̂anti). This is consistent with Shoemark et al.
(2017), who found more Scots usage among pro-
independence users (d = 0.00555 for pro/anti
tweets, d = 0.00709 for all tweets). The relative
differences between the groups are large: in the
all-tweet condition, p̂pro is five times greater than
p̂anti, whereas Shoemark et al. found a twofold
difference (p̂pro = 0.01443 versus p̂anti = 0.00734
for all-tweet condition). All raw proportions are
two orders of magnitude greater than those in the
Scottish study, a result of the denser language vari-
able used in this study (full-tweet code-switching
vs. intermittent code-mixing).

5 Catalan Usage, Topic, and Audience

One way to explain the variability in Catalan us-
age is through topic-induced variation, which pro-
poses that people adapt their language style in re-
sponse to a shift in topic (Rickford and McNair-
Knox, 1994). This leads to our second research
question: is Catalan more likely to be used in dis-
cussions of the referendum than in other topics?
This analysis is conducted under three conditions.
The first two conditions compare Catalan usage in
referendum-hashtag tweets (pro, anti, and neutral)
against (1) all tweets; and (2) tweets that contain
a non-referendum hashtag. This second condition
is meant to control for the general role of hash-
tags in reaching a wider audience (Pavalanathan
and Eisenstein, 2015), and its results motivate the
third analysis, comparing (3) @-reply tweets with
hashtag tweets.

5.1 Referendum Hashtags

Method. We extract all users in U who have
posted at least one referendum-related tweet and
at least one tweet unrelated to the referendum into
a new set, UR. Tweet and user counts for all
conditions are provided in Table 4. The small
numbers are a result of the condition require-
ment and the language constraint (tweets must be
identified as Spanish or Catalan with 90% con-
fidence). For a user u, we denote the propor-
tion of u’s referendum-related tweets written in
Catalan by p̂(u)C , and the proportion of u’s control
tweets written in Catalan by p̂(u)X . We are inter-
ested in the difference between these two propor-
tions d(u) = p̂(u)C − p̂

users d̄UR =

icance using a one-sample t-test.

Results. Our results, presented in the middle
columns of Table 5, show that users tweet in
Catalan at a significantly higher rate in referen-
dum tweets than in all control tweets (first re-
sults column), but no significant difference was
observed in the control condition where tweets
include at least one hashtag (second results col-
umn). The lack of a significant difference between
referendum-related hashtags and other hashtags
suggests that the topic being discussed is not as
central in choosing one’s language, compared with
the audience being targeted.

Our second result is the opposite of the prior
finding that there were significantly fewer Scots
words in referendum-related tweets than in con-
trol tweets (cf. Table 7 in Shoemark et al. (2017);
d̄u = −0.0015 for all controls). This suggests that
Catalan may serve a different function than Scots
in terms of political identity expression. Rather
than suppressing their use of Catalan in broadcast
tweets, users increase their Catalan use, perhaps
to signal their Catalonian identity to a broader au-
dience. This is supported by literature highlight-
ing the integral role Catalan plays in the Catalo-
nian national narrative (Crameri, 2017), as well as
the relatively high proportion of Catalan speakers
in Catalonia: 80.4% of the population has speak-
ing knowledge of Catalan (Government of Cat-
alonia, 2013), versus 30% population of Scotland
with speaking knowledge of Scots (Scots Lan-
guage Centre, 2011). There are also systemic dif-

139



ferences between the political settings of the two
cases: the Catalonian referendum had much larger
support for separation among those who voted
(92% in Catalonia vs. 45% in Scotland) (Fother-
ingham, 2017; Jeavens, 2014). These factors sug-
gest a different public perception of national iden-
tity in the two regions within the context of the ref-
erenda, resulting in different motivations behind
language choice.

5.2 Reply Tweets

Earlier work has highlighted the role of hashtags
and @-replies as affordances for selecting large
and small audiences, and their interaction with the
use of non-standard vocabulary (Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein, 2015). To test the role of audience size
in Catalan use, we compare the proportion of Cata-
lan in @-reply tweets against hashtag tweets.

Method. In this analysis, we take the treatment
set to be all tweets made by users in UR which
contain an @-reply but not a hashtag (narrow audi-
ence), and control against all tweets which contain
a hashtag but not an @-reply (wide audience).

Results. The results in the rightmost column of
Table 5 demonstrate a significant tendency to-
ward less Catalan use in @-replies than in hash-
tag tweets. This trend supports the hypothesis that
Catalan is intended for a wider audience.

This effect may also be explained by a subset of
reply tweets in political discourse being targeted
at national figures, possibly seeking to direct the
message at the target’s followers rather than to
engage in discussion with the target. For exam-
ple, one of the reply-tweets addresses a Spanish
politician (“user1”) in a conversation about a re-
cent court case: “@user1 @user2 What justice
are you talking about? What can a JUDGE like
this impart?”4. The same writer uses Catalan in a
more broadcast-oriented message: “Enough [be-
ing] dumb! We’ll get to work and do not divert
us from our way. First independence, then what
is needed! My part; #CatalonianRepublic”5. This
provides a new perspective on the earlier finding
by Pavalanathan and Eisenstein (2015): by reply-
ing to tweets from well-known individuals, it may

impartir un JUEZ como este?

5Prou rucades! Anem per feina i no ens desviem del camı́.
El primer la independència, després el que calgui! El meu
parti; #republicacatalana

be possible to reach a large audience, similar to the
use of popular hashtags.

6 Conclusion

This study demonstrates the association of code-
switching with political stance, topic and audi-
ence, in the context of a political referendum. We
corroborate prior work by showing that the use
of a minority language is associated with pro-
independence political sentiment, and we also pro-
vide a result in contrast to prior work, that the
use of a minority language is associated with a
broader intended audience. This study extends the
setting of code-switching from everyday conversa-
tion into specifically political conversation, which
is subject to different expectations and constraints.

This study does not use geographic signals, be-
cause the sparsity of geotagged tweets prevented
us from restricting the scope to data generated in
Catalonia proper. Another potential limitation is
that assumption that political hashtags are robust
signals for political stance. Other work has shown
that political hashtags can be co-opted by oppos-
ing parties (Stewart et al., 2017).

Our findings extend prior work on political use
of Scots words on the inter-speaker level and
Scots-English code-mixing on the intra-speaker
level to examining language choice and code-
switching, respectively. Further work is required
to reconcile our results with prior work on topic
differences and audience size (Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein, 2015). Future work may also com-
pare the Catalonian situation with multilingual so-
cieties in which a minority language is discour-
aged (Karrebæk, 2013), or in which the languages
are more equally distributed (Blommaert, 2011).
