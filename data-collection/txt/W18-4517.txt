Abstract

Automatically identifying persons in a particular role within a large corpus can be a difficult
task, especially if you don’t know who you are actually looking for. Resources compiling names
of persons can be available, but no exhaustive lists exist. However, such lists usually contain
known names that are “visible” in the national public sphere, and tend to ignore the marginal
and international ones. In this article we propose a method for automatically generating sugges-
tions of names found in a corpus of Norwegian news articles, and which “naturally” belong to
a given initial list of members, and that were not known (compiled in a list) beforehand. The
approach is based, in part, on the assumption that surface level syntactic features reveal parts of
the underlying semantic content and can help uncover the structure of the language.

1 Introduction

One important factor in media coverage of news is the use of diverse sources. Both prominent and
marginal voices should be able to express their opinions and views, and be taken into consideration by
media outlets. While prominent voices are easily identified and might already be compiled in existing
lists (e.g. top level politicians or judges), the marginal ones remain unknown for most readers, and are
often not included in precompiled lists. Marginal voices are not necessarily unknown by the public, but
they are voices that are not that prominent in a given media coverage. In order to be able to actually
quantify to what extent marginal voices are reflected in the media, it is important to be able to identify
them.

Automated approaches can be used to identify the voices present in a large corpus of texts. Advances in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches allow the automatic identification of the named entities
present in a corpus. While these advances have yielded good results for English, they are still at a
basic stage for Norwegian. To the best of our knowledge, no approaches can identify the type of an
entity (if it is a person name, an organization, ...) for Norwegian texts. However, there are some efforts
made towards it, and we are able to identify entities from texts without being able to identify their types
(Johansen, 2015). For Norwegian, it is still necessary to add a second step of analysis, usually a manual
one, to be able to identify the type of each entity. Even when or if this approach succeeds, there is still a
need for additional tools that classify a particular individual within a class of entities.

Linguistic theories show that words having the same context tend to share the same meaning (Harris,
1954), where context here is identified as the words appearing before and after a given word. We believe
that this applies to named entities as well. We therefore argue that given a list of known person names, we
can identify new unknown persons having similar roles, by analyzing the context in which their names
co-occur.

In this work we focus on prominent Norwegian politicians that are mentioned in news, predefined in
existing lists, and try to identify the marginal ones, which are not in these lists. The marginal politicians
do not need to be unknown, they just have to not be part of a predefined list of politicians. The marginal
politicians can be mayors, political representatives, or foreign politicians. Since very few or no resources

exist for Norwegian, we rely on an unsupervised approach to automatically identify these unknown
politicians.

In what follows, we start in Section 2 by giving an overview of the literature on which we build our
work. Then, in Section 3 we give an overview of the corpus used during this investigation, along with
the seed list of politicians. In Section 4 we define the methodological steps we followed, and present in
Section 5 the results of this study. A discussion of our main contributions, findings, and future avenues
are summarized in Section 6.

2 Literature review

Named entity recognition (NER) approaches allow us to automatically identify entities in a text, as well
as which type of entities these are, ranging from person names, to organizations and places. NER systems
automatically identify entities and their types in texts. These methods have been extensively developed
for English, but no off-the shelf approaches currently exist for Norwegian. Some work has been made
in this direction, so called Named Entity Chunking (NEC) (Johansen, 2015), that only focuses on the
identification of the entities, without specifying their types. It is therefore still necessary, for Norwegian
texts, to use pre-compiled lists of entities to be able to identify which types a NEC has located in a text.
Challenges emerge, however, if we want to identify specific types of persons in texts, without actually
knowing these persons’ names.

Our motivations are based on the identification of marginal voices present in news articles. The
marginal voices are those who are not precompiled in known lists, but who still express opinions in
the news. When looking for indicators of source diversity in the news, the aim is to ascertain the extent
to which a range of voices gain access to the sphere of public debate. Based on principles of repre-
sentation in democratic deliberation procedures (Bennett, 1990; Brown et al., 1987; McQuail, 1992), a
pluralistic media landscape reflects the ability of media systems to curtail imbalances in the distribution
of social, political and economic power in society (Jeffres et al., 2000). As the news media is the pri-
mary arena where actors can exchange ideas and opinions (Skogerbø and Krumsvik, 2015), access to
this space should ideally be equal for all (Baker, 2006).

Research shows, however, that marginal voices are often excluded from this arena (e.g. (Kleemans
et al., 2017; Ross et al., 2013)). This is partly because the agenda setting function of the media (Mc-
Combs, 2005), and the critical and competitive nature of journalistic professionalism (Cook, 1998; Spar-
row, 1999), tend to exclude marginal voices - especially voices that do not easily fall within the estab-
lished narrative frames of political journalism (Wolfsfeld and Sheafer, 2006). The exclusion of marginal
voices is especially prevalent in political journalism (Alexseev and Bennett, 1995; Baumgartner and
Chaqués Bonafont, 2015; Figenschou and Beyer, 2014; Shehata, 2010). By and large, these findings
reflect the fact that most of this research is conducted on elite media, while in fact, local media tend
to include a broader range of voices (Berkowitz and Beach, 1993; Allern, 1996; Ross, 2007). In cases
where media regulation aims to preserve the type of media outlets that do, in fact, contribute to increase
the diversity of voices in the news (cf., (Kulturdepartementet, 2017)), we therefore need measures to
empirically establish what those outlets are. Because automatic classifiers, topic modelling and conven-
tional content analysis methods tend to negate marginal classification, improvements to these methods
are sorely needed.

Research in linguistics has shown that it is possible, by only analyzing the surface form of the
language, to identify structures yielding important information (Harris, 1954). Especially in the sub-
languages of specialized domain languages (Harris, 1988). Information structures are linguistic struc-
tures representing the distributional structure of the language. Aligning sentences can uncover which
words are typically used with selected words in specialized languages, and words that share the same
context tend to have the same meaning. We believe that the journalistic language used to discuss politi-
cians is specialized and stylized, which makes it subject to the repeated use of some linguistic patterns.

One of the first attempts to automate the identification of information structures is the work of Lamb
(1961). He developed an approach to identify in a corpus of texts the different grouping of words into
fixed parts of sentences, and interchangeable parts. His method would for example identify from these



152

sentences “John bought a car”, “John bought a bike”, “John bought a house”, “Norah bought a car”,
“Norah bought a bike” and “Norah bought a house”, the following fixed part “bought a”, and the inter-
changeable parts (John, Norah) and (car, bike, house). The fixed parts represent a grouping of sequences
of horizontal elements/words (H-groups), and the interchangeable parts represent a set of vertical ele-
ments/words (V-groups). These information structures shed light on how words are being used similarly
or differently in the same context next to given words.

Some of the work in the field of grammar inference are built on the insights of Harris (1954) and the
work of Lamb (1961). Grammar induction approaches rely on the structural aspect of the language to
extract information from textual data. These methods are usually used to induce complete grammars for
a given language or text. However, some work has shown that methods developed in grammar induction
can be used to automatically induce information structures that can identify what is being said about
given issues, how it is being said, and can reflect some of the most important and distinctive content of a
corpus (Salway et al., 2014; Touileb and Salway, 2014; Salway and Touileb, 2014).

An unsupervised grammar induction algorithm (first presented in (Solan et al., 2005)), that discov-
ers hierarchical structures in sequential data, has been modified by Salway and Touileb (2014) into a
text mining approach – henceforth referred to as SIMMS (Structure Induction for Mining Meaningful
Snippets). The latter automatically, and in an unsupervised way, induces information structures from
unannotated corpora. This algorithm is able to identify some of the most significant patterns (hori-
zontal sequences of words) and equivalence classes (vertical groups of words) within the context of
patterns, using statistical information, and running over a predetermined set of iterations. The patterns
and equivalence classes respectively resemble the H-groups and V-groups presented by Lamb (1961).
The method focuses on text snippets around key terms of interest rather than processing entire sentences.
Instances of the most frequent induced patterns, representing information structures, are then replaced
with unique identifiers in the input to make patterning around them more explicit in subsequent iter-
ations. The induced structures are in the form of regular expressions, where elements of patterns are
separated by whitespace, and the elements of the equivalence classes are separated by “|” representing
“or”. Considering the previous example of John and Norah, this approach will induce structures of the
form “(John|Norah) bought a (car|bike|house)” which can be read as John or Norah
bought a car or bike or house. We will in what follows refer to information structures and patterns
interchangeably.

Based on this method and the linguistic theories on which it is built, we believe that given a sufficiently
large corpus and a seed list containing a set of voices (both often described in specialized language and
sufficiently homogeneous), we may isolate a set of new names (not contained in the seed list) which
naturally extend the seed list. In our case, given a set of politicians’ names, we may automatically find
a disjoint set of names which will contain a relatively high portion of politicians. We therefore propose
a method for expanding a list of known names to include previously undiscovered names occurring in
similar contexts. In the following, we outline the steps in the implementation of an approach to enlarge
a list of Norwegian politicians’ names to include politicians which do not appear in the preexisting list
(which we refer to as the seed list), from a corpus of news texts.

3 Data

We use two data sets: a large corpus of newspaper articles and a list of Norwegian politicians. The
corpus of Norwegian news articles was scraped hourly from 125 online newspapers, between October
and December 2015 and 2016. These newspapers reflect diversity in ownership (state (one outlet, the
Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation), corporate, foundation, or independent), and distribution (local
(92 outlets), metropolitan (25 outlets) or national (8 outlets)). This resulted in more than 600,000 articles.
We show in Table 1 the newspapers, and their distribution category.

The list of politicians contained 368 Norwegian politicians in parliament and government, as well as
mayors and their deputies. The names of politicians from the parliament and government were collected
from the open data of the Norwegian Parliament1. The names of mayors and their deputies were manually

gathered from various online sources. The list comprises 298 names representing county mayors, county
deputy mayors, sate secretaries, municipal councils, city councils, local chairmans, county councils, city
council representatives, and local councils.

4 Approach

We start with the assumption that texts featuring politicians have certain common context-dependent
characteristics across the corpus. This should therefore allow for the identification of language use
patterns around the politicians’ names and allow us to identify politicians that were not included in the
seed list.

Given a corpus (C), we produce a list of all names occurring in it and isolate those that appear on
the seed list of politicians. We select all sentences from C in which some politician is mentioned and
apply SIMMS to these sentences. This yields a set of patterns, from which we may isolate a sub-corpus
(D) of sentences (not full texts) which match these patterns. Names will occur in a number of sentences
matching a number of patterns. We take the sum of these frequencies to denote the names’ score. Names
which score well, are presented to a human expert for validation.

In more details, the process starts by running a Norwegian NEC analysis (Johansen, 2015) on the news
corpus. The list of identified entities was manually analyzed, with some algorithmic assistance (looking
up names), to only select entities referring to persons. Then, using the list of Norwegian politicians,
all sentences from all news articles containing the politicians’ names from the seed list were identified
and extracted. These names were then substituted with the placeholder-string “POL” in the sentences.
This was done to create an abstract concept of politician and create more patterning in the input texts. It
yields a set of sentences where known names have been removed, but permits our approach to distinguish
between entities occurring in our target list (i.e. having roles similar to politicians) from other names. In
the same sentences, we substituted each appearance of a person name (non-politician) entity, as identified
by NEC and not present in the politician seed list, with the placeholder-codes “PER” for persons, and
“ENT” for the remaining entities. The placeholders “POL”, “PER”, and “ENT” do not otherwise occur
in the text.

Once the sentences containing known politician names are extracted, SIMMS (Salway et al., 2014) is
applied in order to automatically induce salient patterns of language use around the coded politicians’
names (i.e. the string “POL”). We start by creating snippets around POL as explained in (Salway et
al., 2014). These snippets are of various sizes and contain between 0-12 words on either side of the
string. These are used in the various iteration phases of the algorithm. The snippets are of increasingly
large sizes which allows the algorithm, in each of its running iterations, to build more patterning around
the already identified patterns. These patterns are information structures of word sequences, resembling
information extraction templates (Salway et al., 2014).

Table 2: A selection of induced structures.

A small sample of induced structures is shown in Table 2. The structures are shown in Norwegian,
with English translations in italics. Structure P 0 is the most frequent of all induced structures, and
seems to discuss politicians in different positions. Structure P 14 focuses on politicians related to climate
and environment. Structures P 44, P 102, and P 192 discuss spokeswoman and spokesman in various
political roles, while structure P 61 seem to discuss local politicians.

We automatically filtered the induced structures to keep only those that included the string “POL”, or
had the string in the exterior of the patterns within the matched sentences. We disregarded all structures
that only included the strings “PER” or “ENT” without “POL” in their surroundings within their matched
sentences. However, structures including “PER” or “ENT” and not including “POL” but having the string
in the matched sentences were kept. This was done to focus our analysis on structures and sentences
containing names of politicians indicated by the presence of the string “POL”, and in order to identify
which of the strings within “PER” are actually politicians. This process resulted in 108 patterns.

After we had discovered the patterns which seemed to identify politicians, we subsequently isolated the
sentences which manifested these patterns into a sentence sub-corpus, D. We re-ran the NEC (Johansen,
2015) on this corpus to identify candidate names, which were thereafter compared to the seed list of
politicians. The politicians that were present in the seed list were removed keeping only the list of new
names that we believed were likely to be unknown politicians (i.e. not in the seed list). This list of
unknown names was afterwards presented to human judges for manual analysis. The results of this were
rather promising, as we show in the next section.

5 Results

We compute for each of the newly identified names a score representing its frequencies in the induced
structures. The score is computed as the sum of all frequencies of the name in the various structures in
which it appears. In Figure 1 we show the distribution of names and their frequencies. The figure on the
right shows an excerpt of the most interesting range of the full range shown in the figure on the left. Most
of the newly identified names have frequencies between 2 and 51, with some recurring spikes between
frequency 51 and frequency 150. The frequency distribution flattens out after frequency 150 and there is
only one name per frequency between frequency values 150 and 521.

are presented in Table 3. We also show which names are politicians using boolean values: 1 for politician
and 0 for not politician. This decision was based on the manual analysis of the human judges.

We investigated two top-scoring intervals: a set of the best scoring names, and a subsequent set of best
scoring names. The set of the best scoring names are all names that have a frequency equal or greater than
90% of the frequency of the most frequent name. The second top-scoring interval represents names with
frequencies between 50 and 32. They yielded respectively 156/264 (60%) and 97/231 (42%) politicians
including known politicians from the seed list. We argue that this already corroborates our assumptions
about specialized language, that persons sharing the same role are discussed and talked about similarly.

Disregarding known politicians, the first set of best scoring names resulted in a sample of 167 unknown
names, with frequencies spanning from 521 at maximum to minimum 51. We manually analyzed this
sample of names and identified which ones were actually politicians. From these 167 names, we were
not able to classify 6 names either because they were incomplete, or ambiguous. From the 161 names
remaining, 33% were manually classified as politicians (53 names out of 161). The remaining 67%
mostly represented athletes. The second best scoring interval of names resulted in a set of 170 unknown
names, from which 8 were unclassified. From the remaining 162 we were able to classify 28 names as
politicians, representing 17.28%. As in the previous interval, most of the remaining names referred to
athletes. That is, had we presented the unrecognized top-scoring names, a human expert would verify
every third name as a politician which we could correctly add to our seed list of politicians. Table 4
summarizes our findings on unknown politician names.

A total of 67% of the newly identified politicians, in the first set of best scoring names, represented
Norwegian politician names (local and national), and 33% were international politicians (Canada, UK,

players, football coaches, general managers of football clubs, or football commentators. About 9% re-
ferred to athletes in other sports like cycling, and handball. A total of 12% were person names known in
winter sports like skiing, ice hockey players, and alpinists. The remaining 20% were political activists,
journalists, police, jurists, lawyers, celebrities, union leaders, musicians, and company leaders.

In the second set of best scoring names, a total of 82.15% of the newly identified politician names were
Norwegian politicians, and 17.85% were international ones (from Canada, Germany, and UK). The per-
son names that were not politicians were mostly related to sports. These were football players/coaches,
other sports like handball, ski or ice hockey athletes and represent 50.31% of the 161 identified names.
The remaining 16.69% were political activists, journalists, celebrities, union leaders, musicians, and
company leaders.

6 Conclusion and future work

In this paper, we have addressed the problem of automatically identifying person names sharing similar
political roles from a corpus of news articles. We have used a text mining approach able to automati-
cally induce patterns of language use around known politician names from a predefined seed list. This
approach is able to group together words appearing in similar contexts, and hence person names sharing
similar roles.

Automatically identifying and extracting names is a difficult task, especially in Norwegian, as no off-
the shelf named entity recognition (NER) approaches exists. In this work, we have used a named entity
chunker (NEC) (Johansen, 2015) that is able to identify entities, but not their types. In order to be able
to differentiate person names from other types of entities, we in part relied on computer assisted manual
analysis. We have shown that our approach is able to identify new names that naturally extend the seed
list, as these new names have similar roles.

There are many parameters that may influence this approach. If our seed list is actually complete,
there would be no names to add and our approach would only present names not belonging to it. If our
seed list is heterogeneous, or contains names belonging to a group which is generally not discussed by a
specialized language, we may expect the human expert to be presented with many names which do not
naturally extend our list.

Although we have only tested our approach on a list of politicians’ names, we feel there is good reason
to believe that many other natural sets of names satisfy the conditions our approach relies on. It suffices
that the entities named in the seed list share some attributes or characteristics which makes it likely that
they will be discussed in similar ways in some specialized language.

Most of the names identified were not politicians, but a relatively high proportion were. We removed
all known politicians before compiling the results presented in this article. This justifies the fact that 33%
is regarded as good results for a first step. We believe that this might be due to the nature of the corpus.
The corpus was a collection of news articles covering all newsworthy issues from sport to politics. Based
on the induced structures, it seems that the way politicians are talked about, the words used to describe
them or discuss issues around them, resembles the way athletes and sports related events are talked about.

We plan to improve our approach by first running a topic modeling approach on the corpus, to filter out



157

the news articles not covering political issues, and then re-run the presented approach. This will give, we
believe, a more focused corpus as input, and we might be able to solely identify new names of politicians.
We also think that it would be interesting to use word embeddings, and investigate if politicians’ names
are nearer in the vector space model as opposed to non-politicians.
