Abstract

In this paper, we provide the first quanti-
fied exploration of the structure of the lan-
guage of dreams, their linguistic style and
emotional content. We present a collec-
tion of digital dream logs as a viable cor-
pus for the growing study of mental health
through the lens of language, complemen-
tary to the work done examining more tra-
ditional social media. This paper is largely
exploratory in nature to lay the ground-
work for subsequent research in mental
health, rather than optimizing a particular
text classification task.

1 Introduction

Despite a prominent role in the origin of psychol-
ogy (Freud, 2013; Jung, 2002), scientific research
about the meaning and value of dreams has waned
in the 21st century. Cartwright (2008), for one,
has argued that dreams lost their prominence in
the latter half of the 20th century as psychology
attempted to become a more empirical science fo-
cused on observable behavior and mental activity
and less reliant on memory. In the last decade,
the distinctive brain patterns of dreaming have be-
come more identifiable (Siclari et al., 2017) and
research has amassed on the impact of dreams on
waking life with links to mood (Cartwright, 2013),
relationship health (Selterman et al., 2012) and
decision-making (Morewedge and Norton, 2009).
While scientists debate the purpose of dreams
(Barrett, 2007; Cartwright et al., 2006), dreams
continue to be a universal and time intensive ex-
perience across humanity.

Until recently, dreams remained an offline phe-
nomena, qualitatively separate from other forms
of social interaction via social media. Online
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are fer-

tile grounds for research in social science (Wil-
son et al., 2012; boyd and Ellison, 2007) and
more recently, in mental health via computational
approaches in text analysis (Pennebaker et al.,
2015; De Choudhury et al., 2013; Coppersmith
et al., 2014) and network structure (Christakis and
Fowler, 2014). However, dreams have remained as
private, albeit important conversational currency
(Wax, 2004). When dreams are studied, they are
gathered from sleep labs, psychotherapeutic and
inpatient settings, personal dream journals and oc-
casionally classroom settings where “most recent
dreams” and “most vivid dreams” are collected
(Domhoff, 2000). The recent development of a so-
cial network dedicated to dreams offers scientists
unprecedented access to the language of dreams at
scale, collected with consistent methodology. Un-
derstanding the structure of this large corpus of
dreams gives us access to previously unobserv-
able mental activity and enables future research
to identify abnormal patterns in themes, emotional
tone, and styles associated with mental health di-
agnoses and therapeutic outcomes.

We begin with a brief overview of the impetus
for this work and a discussion of related work in
the intersection of dreams and text analysis. We
then provide details on the corpus of dreams and
discuss our results organized around three research
questions. The paper concludes with implications
for subsequent research on dreams, both to better
understand nuances in the medium, and for mental
health purposes.

1.1 Previous research on dream content and
text analysis

Dreams are challenging to understand. Dreams
are a diverse medium that vary from being per-
ceptual or cognitive, from involving simple set-
tings to complicated narratives, which may be sim-
ilar or dissimilar to waking life (Siclari et al.,

13



2017). Analyzing them is similarly complex; re-
searchers have put extensive effort into the de-
velopment of systems to score their global con-
tent, specific themes, psychological intensity, and
theoretical underpinnings (Schredl, 2010). Dif-
ferent researchers, research goals, collection ve-
hicles and analytic techniques present issues in
replication, reliability and the validity of standard-
ized methods for the content analysis of dreams.
The Hall-Van de Castle coding system is the most
comprehensive protocol for content analysis of
dreams, with eight main categories and over 300
sub scales in the dream manual (Hall and Castle,
1966). Categories include: Physical surroundings
(e.g. indoor, outdoor), Characters (e.g. persons,
animals), Social interactions (e.g. friendly vs. ag-
gressive), Activities (e.g. communication, think-
ing), Achievement outcomes (e.g. success, fail-
ure), Environmental press (e.g. fortune, misfor-
tune), Emotions (e.g. anger, happiness), Descrip-
tive elements (e.g. size, age, color), and Theoreti-
cal scales (e.g. castration anxiety, regression).

A handful of studies have used automated text
analysis to explore dreams, specifically to discern
differences from waking narratives and identify
the relationship between dream language and per-
sonality (Hawkins and Boyd, in press), for auto-
mated sentiment detection (Nadeau et al., 2006)
and to distinguish linguistic features from personal
narratives (Hendrickx et al., 2016). To our knowl-
edge, no study has examined as large a sample
of dreams from a naturalistic setting (neurotyp-
ical research participants, online social context)
across methodologies for psychological purposes
(i.e. non classification/ non hypothesis driven).

Hawkins and Boyd (in press) analyze dreams
across three samples of recent dream reports, two
undergraduate and one sample from Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk1. Using Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2007), they find
a distinctive pattern for recent dreams that dif-
fers from the base rate norms for waking narra-
tives, specifically characterized by more function
words, common words, pronouns, personal pro-
nouns, first person pronouns, past tense verbs, and
more use of words describing leisure activities;
less use of present tense and future tense verbs,
causation words, second person pronouns, num-
bers, swear words, and assent words. They did not

find consistent relationships between dream lan-
guage features and personality. Hawkins & Boyd’s
research paves the way for understanding how and
why a dream narrative differs from a waking narra-
tive and what these differences mean from a psy-
chological perspective. For example, what does
it mean for a dream to have more function words
than a waking narrative? What is the relationship
between the content of dreams and the more “in-
visible” word differences (pronouns, prepositions,
articles)?

Nadeau et al. (2006) also used LIWC on dreams
to gauge the efficacy of automated sentiment anal-
ysis to bypass human judges or dreamer esti-
mates of emotion. Comparing the performance of
LIWC, the General Inquirer, a weighted lexicon
(HM) and standard bag of words approach, they
find machine learning outperforms human judg-
ments - and specifically demonstrate that LIWC
and the GI have the best features for sentiment
classification. While a step in a promising di-
rection, Nadeau et al.’s sample was small (100
dreams from 29 individuals) and sentiment was
classified on a limited negative scale (4-class, from
neutral to highly negative) omitting nuance in
the purported emotional content of dreams, c.f.
Cartwright (2013).

Hendrickx et al. (2016) looked at the distin-
guishing features from dreams as compared to per-
sonal narratives (diary entries from Reddit and
personal stories from Prosebox) via text classifi-
cation, topic modeling and text coherence. The
authors find dreams can be classified with near
perfect precision based on the presence of un-
certainty markers (somebody, remember, some-
where, recall) and descriptions of scenes (set-
ting, riding, building, swimming, table, room),
with lower discourse coherence. Personal narra-
tive markers (non-dream) include time (2014, to-
day, tonight, yesterday, day, months) and conver-
sational expressions (please, :), ?, thanks). Hen-
drickx et al. also applied LDA topic modeling to
explore the main themes in dreams as compared
to personal narratives validating the classification
results. Dream topics span everyday activities,
setting descriptions, and uncertainty expressions.
The Hendrickx et al. research is notable in its
exploration of male vs. female topic distributions
within dreams in addition to comparisons across
corpus type (dream vs. personal narrative) though
does not explore the relationship between topic

14



and emotion and excludes the analysis of func-
tion words, which we believe is a critical piece in
understanding the psychological value of dreams
and dreamers, given previous findings (Chung and
Pennebaker, 2007).

1.2 Relevant research on mental health and
text analysis

Computational text analysis allows for assessment
of larger samples and proactive identification of
mental illness. Language in social media can indi-
cate the likelihood a user self-reports a particular
mental disorder (Coppersmith et al., 2015), or has
received a mental health diagnosis (De Choudhury
et al., 2013). The language of online dreams has
yet to be analyzed relative to mental health condi-
tions, however prior laboratory research suggests
that dream content may differ between clinical
conditions. We refer the reader to Skancke et al.’s
comprehensive review of dream content grouped
by clinical disorder (Skancke et al., 2014). In
brief, patterns in emotional tone, themes, and ac-
tor focus have been associated with diagnoses of
mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, per-
sonality, and eating disorders. Though, it remains
unclear whether dream content can distinguish be-
tween clinical disorders.

Nightmares are especially relevant to mental
health, featuring as a diagnostic symptom for post-
traumatic stress disorder (Campbell and Germain,
2016), and a common correlate with schizophre-
nia (Okorome Mume, 2009), depression and anxi-
ety (Swart et al., 2013), and personality disorders
(Schredl et al., 2012). Nightmare frequency and
intensity have been positively correlated with in-
cidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Bern-
ert et al., 2005), suggesting nightmares could be
a near-term risk factor to assess during crisis. In
sum, analysis of dream topics and emotional tone
may provide some insight to the mental health of
the dreamer.

2 Data

Dreams were collected from DreamsCloud, a so-
cial network for sharing dreams. DreamsCloud
is available to the public; those who register for
the site are informed that their data can be used
for research purposes. DreamsCloud is moderated
by professional dream reflectors who comment on
dreams, in addition to the broader community of
registered users who can also “like” and comment

on dreams.

DreamsCloud has the largest available digital
collection of dreams with over 119k dreams from
73k users and an overall community of over 300k
registered users. Visitors to the site come from
234 countries (according to Google Analytics) and
have shared dreams in 8 languages. DreamsCloud
differs from online dream banks in that dreams are
voluntarily shared for social purposes rather than
collections from research studies.

A random sample of 10k English dreams over
100 words from September 1, 2013 through De-
cember 31, 2016 was used in this study. Data
cleansing removed 322 dreams due to incorrectly
classified language (Spanish), lyrics or news con-
tent copied from the Internet by the user, and
duplicated data. The remaining sample included
9,678 dreams. No additional data about the gen-
der, age, name, or ethnicity of the participants are
included in our study. Only the original dream
texts are analyzed. While DreamsCloud has com-
ments and conversations around many of these
dreams, we put off analysis of commentary for
subsequent research and focus directly on the first-
person accounts of dreams. The average length of
dreams in the sample is 208 words (SD = 116.7).
Data is organized by an encrypted alphanumeric
Dreamer ID and a unique, encrypted alphanumeric
Dream ID for each dream logged.

2.1 Ethical considerations

While community members agree to Terms of Ser-
vice that explicitly state their content is owned by
the company and will be used for research pur-
poses, the nature of the content is very intimate.
Because of the unknowns about the science be-
hind why we dream, what our dreams mean, how
dreams are related to life events, there is less of a
stigma about sharing otherwise private or bizarre
information. The site refers to dream-sharing as
an “anonymous-as-you-want” activity. Although
the analyses in this paper are structural and aggre-
gate in nature, deeper analysis of this data could
raise privacy concerns as well as questions about
appropriate intervention. Our hope is that addi-
tional research in this area will shed light on the
relationship between dreaming and waking life to
help address these questions.

3 Results

Three approaches are used to examine the dream
narratives: content analysis using an LDA topic
model (Blei et al., 2003), analysis of linguistic
style via function words using LIWC (Pennebaker
et al., 2015), and categorization of emotions us-
ing an emotion classification model (Coppersmith
et al., 2016).

3.1 The topical structure of dreams

Topic models are statistical models which dis-
cover topics in a corpus. Topic modeling is es-
pecially useful in large data, where it is too cum-
bersome to extract the topics manually. Due to
the large volume of dreams in our corpus and the
lack of prior knowledge about their subjects, we
follow other content-based studies in employing
topic modeling to understand the content of the
dreams (Kireyev et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2011;
Chae et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2015; Hendrickx
et al., 2016). We analyzed the topical structure of
the dream corpus using a popular topic modeling
algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei
et al., 2003). LDA is an algorithm for the auto-
mated discovery of topics. LDA treats documents
as a mixture of topics, and topics as a mixture of
words. Each topic discovered by LDA is repre-
sented by a probability distribution which conveys
the affinity for a given word to that particular topic.

We used the LDA implementation available in
the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002). We con-
verted the text to lower case and, because the topic
analysis is focused on content of dream narra-
tives, excluded all function words and punctua-
tion marks. (Function and style will be consid-
ered in the following section.) No reduction in in-
flection (i.e. stemming, lemmatization) was per-
formed to satisfy the goals of exploring the nu-
ance of dream narratives as a medium and subse-
quently make inferences about the psychological
orientation of the authors (see section 3.2). Fur-
ther, in order to make more valid comparisons to
the existing literature based on human coding, it is
important to understand how distributions of sin-
gular vs. plural nouns and present vs. past tense
verbs, for example are distributed topically. We
selected 25 topics for LDA to infer and used 2000
iterations of Gibbs sampling to fit the model. The
number of topics was informed by maximizing the
computed information gain of the resulting feature
sets, while maintaining a reasonable training time.

LDA provides insightful information about the
topics in the corpus. However, interpreting the
‘aboutness’ of a topic based on a list of words re-
quires human judgment based on term frequency,
exclusivity, meaning, and subjective inference. In-
terestingly, we found 23 of 25 topics to be inter-
pretable based on semantic meaning and 2 (Top-
ics 17 and 22) which appeared more syntactically
related. Most heavily weighted topic words are
quoted in results tables, and the full 25-topic dis-
tribution with manual labeling is included in Ap-
pendix A. Note that the topic number is randomly
assigned by LDA and does not indicate anything
meaningful like rank, weight, or importance.

Although we utilize a 25-topic solution as com-
pared to Hendrickx et al.’s 50-topic solution, we
see some consistency in the topics identified as
characteristic of dream narratives. Specifically,
we see similar support for the continuity hypoth-
esis of dreams - that dreams are a continuation of
waking life activities - in topics such as Topic 19
about School, Topic 12 about food and eating, and
Topic 15 about driving and cars. Similar to their
research, we also see clustering of present tense
verbs in Topic 0, a water topic (11), and home set-
tings topic (5). We see an almost exact replica-
tion of their “dreaming in general,” in our Topic
18. Comprehensive comparisons in distributions
or characteristic words are not possible with the
data their published research makes available.

In inspecting the topical distribution and not-
ing the support for the continuity hypothesis,
what also stands out is the lack of support for
the ‘dreams-as-psychotic-state’ hypothesis. Be-
ginning with Freud and Jung, researchers have
drawn similarities between dreaming and psy-
chosis. These similarities range from phenomeno-
logical to neurobiological, qualitatively mani-
fested as a loosening of associations, incongruity
and bizarreness of personal experience, and distor-
tion of time and space parameters (Scarone et al.,
2008). Reviewing the content of our 25-topic solu-
tion, we see no reason to interpret the clustering of
words within any given topic as incongruous nor
do we detect support for the content to be evalu-
ated as “bizarre” (Hobson et al., 1987). The topics
instead appear closely aligned with reality, reflec-
tive or overt (actions) and covert (thoughts) behav-
iors and demonstrate semantic congruity within
topic. However, an automated approach to coding
as subjective a construct as bizarreness demands

16



inspection beyond content words alone.
LDA is an effective means to understand the

distribution of content words in a given corpus.
Importantly, it was developed for the purpose of
dimensionality reduction - document summariza-
tion and information retrieval (Blei et al., 2003).
Some of the assumptions that enable the algo-
rithms behind topic models, such as the exclusion
of words that have no content relevance (e.g. func-
tion words), leave room for additional methods to
explore the psychological meaning of a given doc-
ument, the author’s mindset, and emotions.

3.2 The linguistic style of dreams

Recent research on language from a psycholog-
ical perspective demonstrates that function word
use reflects and is a reliable marker of personality
and a range of social and psychological processes,
cognitive thinking styles and psychological states
(Pennebaker, 2011). Pennebaker proposes that
function words are the infrastructure for thought
and perspective: they connect (e.g. conjunctions,
auxiliary verbs), shape (e.g. pronouns) and or-
ganize (e.g. articles, prepositions) content. Con-
tent is important in dreams, and often metaphori-
cal (Lakoff, 1993). The style in which we remem-
ber and share our dreams can give important clues
to how we make sense of our dreams, and in turn,
ourselves. Said another way, our goals in this pa-
per are not just to explore the stuff that dreams are
made of but the style of dreams as a reflection of
the dreamers’ psychological states. With multiple
lenses on the data, we can obtain an enhanced pic-
ture of the psychological value of the corpus.

LIWC categorizes the words in a given text
into approximately 80 variables. Variables rep-
resent the proportion of words in a given docu-
ment (i.e. dream) that correspond to a lexicon
composed of different categories of words, includ-
ing function words (pronouns, prepositions), af-
fect words (positive emotion, anxiety), and content
words (money, religion, leisure activities). We re-
duced the window of interest in LIWC categories
to function words, affect, and cognitive processes,
as justified by what remains from the LDA analy-
sis (e.g. functions words) and comparisons to re-
sults from the empirical literature described thus
far (Hawkins and Boyd, in press; Nadeau et al.,
2006). Table 1 shows the means and SDs for all
LIWC categories within the Linguistic Processes
dictionaries with Cognitive, Social and Affective

Processes added. Unweighted means from the
aggregated sample of expressive writing in Pen-
nebaker et al. (2015) are provided for context.

As compared to the base rates from expres-
sive writing (Pennebaker et al., 2015), a dream
narrative comes across as a first person (1st per-
son pronouns) account of a past event (past tense)
with particular attention to people (family, friends,
women, and men), objects (articles), locations
(prepositions) and what is seen, heard, and felt
(perceptual processes) more than known or under-
stood (cognitive processes).

Low cognitive processes (M = 9.29; SD = 3.48)
would suggest dreamers are not on a search for
meaning in sharing their dreams, however it is un-
clear if this is a case of displaced cognitive pro-
cessing due to the more dominant perceptual expe-
rience of dreams. Previous research indicates that
narrative coherence has an inverse relationship
with cognitive processing words (Klein and Boals,
2010; Boals et al., 2011). Boals et al. (2011) show
that cognitive process words are related to sense
making as a process which occurs prior to the de-
velopment of a narrative (sense making as an out-
come). This might suggest that dreamers do not
tend to be caught up in why they had a given
dream as much as explaining what happened. In
other words, dreams are shared as complete sto-
ries. A dream narrative’s low proportion of emo-
tion words (Mean Affect = 3.42, SD= 1.90) are un-
expected given recent research on the emotion reg-
ulatory function of dreams and call for additional
investigation, which we address below. One pos-
sibility is the sensitivity of a lexicon-based instru-
ment to the way in which emotions are expressed
in dream narratives. In general, our findings are
consistent with Hawkins and Boyd (in press), de-
spite differences in the collection vehicle (recall:
Hawkins and Boyd use the ‘most recent dream’
and ‘most vivid dream’ paradigm) and previous
version of LIWC (2007 vs. 2015).

3.3 How is language style related to the
content of dreams?

To explore the relationship between dream topic
and language style, we focus on function words
only: pronouns, prepositions, articles, auxiliary
verbs, and negations. In particular, we use an in-
dex composed of the proportions of these classes
of words called the Categorical Dynamic Index
(CDI; Pennebaker et al. 2014) that measures the

extent to which thinking is Categorical (high
prepositions, articles) versus Dynamic (pronouns,
auxiliary verbs).

The CDI is a simple unit-weighted computation
which adds the proportions of articles and preposi-
tions and subtracts personal pronouns, impersonal
pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, adverbs
and negations. It has been shown to be a reliable
marker of cognitive style which we use to under-
stand differences in the experience of various top-
ics in dreams. Being categorical versus dynamic
are different ways of sense-making. One of the
goals of our research is to understand how people
use “the dream” as a medium on the path to self
insight and social connection. In the most basic
sense, do people share dreams about certain top-
ics as a narrative personal experiences indicating
changes over time? Do certain topics lend them-
selves to a more distant style- stories of what hap-

pened to whom with precise descriptions of events
and goals?

The top five Categorical dream topics and top
five Dynamic topics are depicted in Table 2. Top-
ics that are the most categorical are primarily
marked by physical environments: trees, sky,
house, beach, road. Dynamic dream narratives
are characterized by intimate relationships (baby,
mom, boyfriend, sister) and experiences (remem-
ber, time). The CDI acts a shortcut to identify
those dreams that are experienced as a narrative,
potentially offering cues to the role of the dreamer
as the main character, a distinguishing factor in
dreams of healthy controls as compared to psychi-
atric patient samples (Skancke et al., 2014). Ad-
ditionally, this shortcut points to a style of dream
that would be difficult to discern with a topical lens
only; that is, interpersonal situations with multi-
ple characters and complex relationships. Interest-
ingly, Cartwright et al. (1984) find that complex
dreams containing multiple characters and shifts
of scenes were one marker of depression remis-
sion in their five month longitudinal REM track-
ing study. Appendix B includes two samples of
dreams with high and low CDI scores.

3.4 The emotional landscape of dreams

One of the goals of this paper is to investigate
how emotions are revealed in dreams, which emo-
tions, and how they vary with the topics that
emerge. One prominent hypothesis in dream re-
search posits that the function of dreams is to help
regulate negative emotion by “intervening” be-
tween waking emotional concerns and post sleep
mood (Cartwright, 2008). Much of the literature
points to a central role for emotions in dreams, yet
there are inconsistencies in the frequencies of the
emotional array detected and their valance. The
inconsistencies are dependent on a similar vari-
ety of reasons to those cited above which make
standardized dream content analysis challenging,
with the added challenge that make emotions dif-
ficult to detect and discern in the broader computer
science literature (Sikka et al., 2014; Schredl and
Doll, 1998). For example, Merritt et al. (1994)
tested a small student population (n=20) and found
that there are an average of 3.6 emotions per dream
with 95% of dreams having at least one emotion,
with fear being the most pervasive. This is di-
rectionally consistent with Hall and Castle (1966)
who find negative emotions to be more prominent,
however the frequencies vary. Sikka et al. (2014)
find consistent differences in the external judg-
ments of emotions in dreams as compared to self
ratings. The predicted labels of each dream nar-
rative should not be taken as a definitive represen-
tation of the overall emotion of that narrative (a
difficult task for even human annotators to accom-
plish consistently; see Purver and Battersby 2012).
Instead, these results should be viewed as an addi-
tional feature of each narrative, able to be evalu-
ated automatically and quickly to gain insight and
explore broader trends.

In our exploration of language style with a
lexicon-based approach, LIWC detected a low
proportion of affect (Mean Affect = 3.42, SD=
1.90). To assess the emotional content of dreams
in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without annotat-
ing each narrative manually), we turn to a model
for classifying emotional content from text. (We
briefly summarize here, but for complete details,
see Coppersmith et al. 2016.) A series of character
language models (one for each of anger, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise, and no emotion) are trained on a
large corpus of Twitter data with an included emo-
tional hashtag, e.g., “#anger”. Tweets contain-
ing indications of sarcasm were removed. Tweets

were labeled by the emotional hashtag contained,
and then that hashtag was removed for training the
model, thus learning what words might contribute
to something being tagged “#anger”. A two-step
semi-supervised process is used to produce the no-
emotion model, since most tweets with emotional
content are not labeled with #[emotion]. (We also
scored each narrative using the Mohammad and
Turney 2013 NRC Emotional Lexicon and opted
for the character language models for greater vo-
cabulary coverage and possible explicit “no emo-
tion” label.)

We apply each of the emotion character lan-
guage models (CLM) to each of the dream nar-
ratives, producing a probability that each narra-
tive’s content results from each emotion’s CLM.
We then label that narrative with the maximum-
probability emotion. Concretely, we expect
dreams to have a mixture of emotions, and this
technique is likely to surface the dominant emo-
tion in the dream (as measured by the number of
words used that indicate that emotion). Percent
breakdown of predicted emotion labels were as
follows: sadness, 31.6%; fear, 21.0%; surprise,
19.9%; joy, 18.7%; anger, 8.7%; no emotion,
0.0%. Only two narratives out of almost 10,000
were labeled no-emotion, and only 6 had the no-
emotion label above 10% of the estimated emo-
tional content within a dream; see caveats of this
approach below.

To continue to deepen our understanding of the
psychological value of the corpus and gain in-
sight on the relationship between dream content
and emotion, we correlate each emotion’s CLM
probability with each of the 25 LDA topics. Table
3 shows the most positively-correlated topic and
most negatively-correlated topic for each emotion.
Consistent with previous research (Merritt et al.,
1994; Hall and Castle, 1966), we demonstrate
emotions present in all dreams, with more negative
than positive emotion: 61.3% negative emotions
(sadness, fear, anger), and sadness as the domi-
nant emotion. Drawbacks of this approach of re-
lying on self-stated emotional content tags are out-
lined in Coppersmith et al. (2016). In short, even
given the two-step semi-supervised method of ob-
taining the most emotionally neutral tweets possi-
ble to use as no-emotion exemplars, it is likely that
some nontrivial percentage of the tweets contain
significant emotional content. In addition, even in
a single tweet, emotional content is often mixed,

19



and the training method employed allows for only
one label that may not be sufficiently descriptive.
Perhaps the largest caveat of these results comes
from the mismatch between the Twitter data the
model was trained on and the dream data it is ap-
plied to here. The featurization and parameters
of the model are optimized for Twitter messages
that are constrained to 140 characters, while the
dream narratives are 1,047 characters on average
(SD 716). Content varies as well; the dream nar-
ratives, at least in theory, have a consistent purpose
and theme: recounting the content of a dream.
Content of tweets is incredibly varied, from a seg-
ment of a story, meant to be read in the context
of additional tweets; to a single hyperlink, perhaps
with a few words of commentary; to a single emoji
repeated 140 times. Future research directions in-
clude training a semi-supervised emotion classi-
fier that includes the dream narratives to general-
ize better across domains.

4 Conclusion

Our paper presents three types of analyses on an
innovative corpus. First we explored the content
of dreams with LDA topic modeling. The results
demonstrate topics easily interpreted by a human

including everyday activity, dreaming itself, and
themes common in the dream literature (teeth, ani-
mals, flying). These results are consistent with the
limited amount of existing research in this area.
Our second lens on the data using LIWC portrays
dreams, in general, as first person accounts of past
events with disproportionate social references and
abstract descriptions of settings. Dreams tend to
focus on perceptual processes more than cogni-
tive processes. However, there are qualitative dis-
tinctions in the content of dreams such that cer-
tain topics are experienced as dynamic and oth-
ers, more categorical. Lastly, we further explored
the emotional content in dreams with an unsuper-
vised approach. Our results indicate that emo-
tion is present in dreams and is disproportionately
negative, with the most common emotion being
sadness. With a sensitive tool, emotion can help
disambiguate content in dreams that would oth-
erwise be lumped together, for example dreams
about friends, romance, and love which show a
complex configuration of emotion.

One major question that underlies this paper
is whether we are investigating how we dream
or how we story and share our dreams. In fu-
ture research, we hope to compare dream data to
other corpora to better understand how this way
of knowing a person, through their dreams, is re-
lated to other forms of self expression. Identifying
a reasonable comparative dataset for dreams col-
lected from a social network is challenging. This
data set is unique in its length (e.g. 140 charac-
ter Tweets vs. 210 word dreams), content (inti-
mate and quotidian content), and purpose (these
dreams are shared for social connection and inter-
action) making most social media, which would
otherwise present the appropriate scale and date
range, a poor fit.

Interpreting topics in dreams is extra challeng-
ing because there is no ground truth. Language
style and emotional classification enhance our un-
derstanding of topics and the mindset of a given
dreamer, but it is as of yet unclear whether there
are individual differences in the way dreams are
experienced, or whether dreams are ‘victims’ of
our memories and are yet another corpus to ex-
plore the same individual differences we might
see in conscious thought. Continued research on
dreams over time, dreamers across media and a
variety of facets within dream data as compared
to different outcome measures (personality, etc.)

20



will help address this concern.

Another limitation in our research is lack of in-
formation about potential skew in the data. For ex-
ample, there may be biases in who shares dreams
and why; who knows about and has access to the
social network. We also did not have access to
ground truth of user mental health information, so
we did not analyze dream content relative to clin-
ical disorders. At this time, site behavior is un-
reliable at the level of dream reporting to tell us
whether there is any systematic bias in who pro-
vides dreams. Future studies will certainly explore
demographic variables including age, sex, race,
socioeconomic status, education level, in addition
to variables related to belief in dreams, dream fre-
quency and other psychological attributes which
would make people more or less likely to share
their dreams. Additionally, future research could
investigate associations between mental disorder
diagnoses and the content of dreams. This is a
preliminary investigation into a vast data set with
many additional variables to explore.

Much like this field has used social media data
as a lens to study the conscious waking percep-
tions, emotions, and thought processes of individ-
uals with mental health conditions, we see this
as a complementary set of quantifiable signals re-
lated to the person’s unconscious processes. While
more traditional social media data is a convolution
of the person’s internal state and the world they in-
habit, we see this dream data as a convolution of
their dreaming self, as recalled and recorded by
their waking self. Considered in context of the
Fluid Vulnerability Theory, dream content could
serve as one of many dynamic, near-term risk fac-
tors for detecting transitions into psychological
crisis (Rudd, 2006). Given the richness of so-
cial media data for uncovering unknown signals
related to mental health, we strongly suspect this
data may hold similar and complementary power.

In sum, our paper offers preliminary evidence
that the language of dreams can be an insightful
contribution to human-centric big data, as a means
for an enhanced understanding of human behav-
ior and cognition alongside standard psycholog-
ical means and modern neuroimaging. Paired
with large scale analysis of social media language,
Internet behavior, and wearable sensor informa-
tion that predict mental health, the language of
dreams could serve as an additional data source
from which to evaluate mental health by digital

life traces.

Appendix B: Sample dreams by CDI

Categorical This dream appears to me as if it were movie. A crowd of people
are running away from a horde of zombies. The crowd of people
run up a skyscraper. The zombies are running and still chasing
them. At the top of the building, the people are stranded and
can hear the dead catching up to them on the stairs. One man
in a brown overcoat pulls a leather tome out of his coat and
flips through it. “THE PROPHECY IS COMING TRUE!” He
yells. The clouds part above them and an angel made entirely
out of tiny swords floats down. The people all marvel for a
moment. Then the angel disintegrates into a cloud of blades and
flies at the zombie horde, decimating them. As this happens,
Japanese rock music starts playing. The scene cuts to a montage
of zombie people and cows getting disintegrated as credits roll
past the “screen” in front of my eyes. I wake up.

Dynamic So I was going to this thing and my crush was there. It was this
hill and it was snowing. So I ran and hugged my crush when I
saw him because we’re bestfriends. So then I saw one of my old
friends. He told me he liked me like 3 years ago. So I hugged
him too because I haven’t seen him forever. So then I got tired
so we sat down at this table and the guy who told me he liked
me (this was in real life when he told me) but in my dream he
sat next to me and bought me a drink and we kinda just smiled
at each other for a while. And that’s it.
