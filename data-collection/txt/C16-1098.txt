Abstract 

This paper investigates differential topic models (dTM) for summarizing the differences among docu-
ment groups. Starting from a simple probabilistic generative model, we propose dTM-SAGE that explic-
itly models the deviations on group-specific word distributions to indicate how words are used differen-
tially across different document groups from a background word distribution. It is more effective to cap-
ture unique characteristics for comparing document groups. To generate dTM-based comparative sum-
maries, we propose two sentence scoring methods for measuring the sentence discriminative capacity. 
Experimental results on scientific papers dataset show that our dTM-based comparative summarization 
methods significantly outperform the generic baselines and the state-of-the-art comparative summariza-
tion methods under ROUGE metrics. 

1 Introduction 
Today, the interconnected nature of real-world applications brings more cross-field research problems 
leading to a much closer relationship between research areas. Real-world challenges require research-
ers to quickly get acquainted with knowledge in other areas. For example, imagine a researcher who is 
familiar with topic models wants to extend her research to opinion summarization. She would be more 
interested in finding out the current development of sentiment analysis and how topic models can be 
used in sentiment analysis, rather than the common background knowledge such as topic models and 
basic NLP technologies. Such a real-world demand encourages the study of multi-document compara-
tive summarization for scientific papers in multiple subject areas. This paper presents the initial study 
on this problem.  

Comparative summarization aims at summarizing the differences among document groups (Wang 
et al., 2012). The core is to compare different topics and find unique characteristics for each document 
group. The main motivation of this paper is to apply dTM to comparative summarization and to model 
the group-specific topics to capture the unique word usage for characterising documents in the same 
group. To our best knowledge, there is no previous study providing in-depth model analysis and de-
tailed experimental results on dTM applied for comparative summarization.  

We first propose a probabilistic generative model dTM-Dirichlet to model the group-specific word 
distributions to capture the unique word usage for each document group. However, dTM-Dirichlet is 
not a truly differential topic model and it suffers from the problems of high inference cost, over-
parameterization and lack of sparsity. Evolving from the idea of SAGE (Eisenstein et al., 2011), we 
develop dTM-SAGE to make the word probability distributions for each document group to share a 
common background word distribution and explicitly models how words are used differently in each 
group from the background word distribution. 

Our main contributions include the following two points: (1) we propose dTM to capture unique 
characteristics of each document group in the application background of comparative summarization 
for cross-area scientific papers; and (2) we propose two sentence scoring methods to measure the sen-

tence discriminative capacity and a greedy sentence selection method to automatically generate sum-
mary for dTM-based comparative summarization. 

2 Related Work 
Multi-document Summarization. Existing multi-document summarization can be either extractive or 
abstractive (Sekine and Nobata, 2003). Our work focuses on the extractive techniques which involve 
in assigning saliency scores to sentences and extracting high-scored sentences in a greedy manner to 
construct a summary (Wan et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2010; Gupta and Lehal, 2010; Celikyilmaz and 
Hakkani-Tur, 2011). Graph-based ranking techniques such as TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) 
and LexPageRank (ErKan and Radev, 2004) have been widely used in extractive summarization. A 
bigram based supervised method was proposed for extractive summarization in ILP framework (Li et 
al., 2013; Li, 2015). Jha et al. (2015) proposed an extractive algorithm that combines a content model 
with a discourse model to generate coherent summaries for scientific articles. A multi-dimensional 
summarization methodology was proposed to transform the paradigm of traditional summarization 
research through multi-disciplinary fundamental exploration on semantics, dimension, knowledge, 
computing and cyber-physical society (Zhuge, 2016). 

Comparative Summarization. Unlike the generic summarization that summarizes the common in-
formation in document collection, the comparative summarization aims to summarize the differences 
among document groups. Wang et al. (2012) proposed a discriminative sentence selection method to 
generate summary by selecting sentences in a greedy manner to minimize the generalized variance of 
a covariance matrix using a multivariate normal model.  Shen and Li (2010) proposed a method by 
building the sentence graph for each document group and extracting a complementary minimum dom-
inating set on each graph to form a discriminative summary.   

Update Summarization. The most similar task to comparative summarization is update summari-
zation, which aims to detect and summarize novel information in a document set B under the assump-
tion that users have already learnt the documents in set A, where documents in A chronologically pre-
cede the documents in B. The update summarization has been well studied. Most existing methods 
solve it as a redundancy removal problem by adding functionality to remove redundant sentences us-
ing filtering rules (Fisher and Roark, 2008), Maximal Marginal Relevance (Boudin et al., 2008), or 
graph-based algorithms (Shen and Li, 2010; Li et al., 2008). 

More related to this paper is the work of a topic-model based update summarization approach Du-
alSum (Delort and Alfonseca, 2012), which learns a general background distribution across the corpus 
and a document-specific distribution for each document, but also learns two collection-specific distri-
butions for each pair of update collection and base collection: the joint topic distribution and the up-
date topic distribution. This paper revises DualSum as a baseline for evaluation in Section 5.2. 

Topic Models for Documents Comparison. The other type of related work is the comparison of 
documents. Most existing studies for this goal focus on topic models to discover common and specific 
themes among document collections, referred to as cross-collection topic models (Paul, 2009). This 
idea was first explored with an initial topic model PLSI (Zhai et al., 2004), and later improved with 
LDA topic model (Blei, 2012; Pual, 2009) which inspires our dTM-Dirichlet. There are a number of 
real-world applications extending cross-collection topic models in different scenarios (Ahmed and 
Xing, 2010; Li et al., 2011). For example, Paul and Girju (2009) employed cross-collection LDA (cc-
LDA) for cross-cultural analysis of blogs and forums and later they proposed a two-dimensional topic-
aspect model (TAM) to jointly discover topics and aspects in scientific literature (Paul and Girju, 2010). 
The common idea behind these cross-collection topic models is that using latent topics capture the 
common and unique word usage among document collections. Cross-collection topic models neglect 
the correlations between each collection-specific topic and the common background topic, thus make 
it insufficient to capture differential word usage. More importantly, the correlations are the essence of 
the differential topic models. 

3 Differential Topic Models 
In this section, the differential topic models are explored for comparative summarization. We first de-
velop a simple probabilistic generative model, dTM-Dirichlet. Evolved from dTM-Dirichlet, dTM-
SAGE is developed by modelling the correlations as additive relation between the group-specific devi-

ations and a background word distribution, which enables to capture more salient group-specific words 
and bypass the problems of high inference cost, over-parameterization and lack of sparsity. 

To illustrate dTM, we first define some notations to express a document corpus C. Let G be the 
number of groups in the corpus, ùëÄùëî be the number of papers in group g and ùëÅùëî,ùëö be the number of 
words in paper m. A word wg,m,n representing the ùëõùë°‚Ñé word in paper m of group g is a discrete ob-
served variable, defined to be an item in the vocabulary list of the whole corpus.  

3.1 dTM-Dirichlet Model 
dTM-Dirichlet model is a simplified version of cross-collection LDA (ccLDA) (Paul and Girju, 2009) 
for comparing multiple text collections. dTM-Dirichlet builds two types of word model. One is for 
each document group g, in which there is a group-specific content word model ùúóùëî that emits discrimi-
native words for the group. The other type is a superset of group-independent word models ùúëùëò that 
generates either background words shared by all document groups or salient words occurring in sever-
al documents of different groups. Reconsidering the example in section 1, the group-independent word 
model represents two classes of words, i.e. the background words like topic model that are shared by 
almost all papers; and the salient words like NP chunk and dependency parsing that only occur in sev-
eral papers of different groups.  

We focus on the group-specific word model for comparative summarization. Since background 
words and salient words provide no group-specific knowledge, they are not distinguished in dTM-
Dirichlet. Following probabilistic topic models, we assume that word models ùúëùëò and ùúóùëî are multino-
mial distributions over words, drawn from uniform Dirichlet distribution (Dir) with priors ùõºùúë and ùõºùúó.  

As shown in Fig. 1, dTM-Dirichlet associates each document a topic distribution ùõæ ~ ùê∑ùëñùëü (ùõºùõæ), and 
the topic assignment variable ùëß for each word in the document thus can be multinomially sampled 
from ùõæ. Besides a topic variable z, each word is also assigned with a binary variable ùë† that indicates 
whether the word is a group-independent topic word (s=1) or a group-specific content word (s=0). 
Each document has a group-specific word controller ùúÜ ~ ùêµùëíùë°ùëé(ùõºùúÜ), which reflects the proportion of 
group-specific content in a document. ùë† is sampled from a Bernoulli test with the probability of ùúÜ.   

Formally, the generative process of dTM-Dirichlet model for a corpus C divided into G document 
groups is shown in Table 1. When ùë†ùëî,ùëö,ùëõ = 1, the sample of the group-independent topic word is iden-
tical to LDA. When ùë†ùëî,ùëö,ùëõ = 0, the sample of the word ùë§ùëî,ùëö,ùëõ is independent from the document‚Äôs top-
ic distribution ùõæùëî,ùëö and directly drawn from the group-specific content word distribution ùúÉùëî.  

dTM-Dirichlet models group-specific word distributions to capture the differential lexicon usage of 
document groups. However, dTM-Dirichlet is not a truly differential topic model, which requires the 
development of dTM-SAGE for comparative summarization. 

3.2 dTM-SAGE Model 
When generating topics for multiple document collections, LDA-style generative models associate a 
multinomial distribution with each document group, which is the same as how we model the group-
specific content words in dTM-Dirichlet model.  

In contrast, SAGE (Sparse Additive Generative model) (Eisenstein et al., 2011) provides an alterna-
tive way to LDA by endowing each document group with a model of the deviation in log-frequency

from a constant background distribution, which brings three advantages: First, a sparsity-inducing pri-
or can be applied to limit the number of terms whose probability diverges from the background term 
frequencies. Second, multi-facets latent variables can be easily combined by adding each facet com-
ponent together to reduce the inference cost. Third, it is redundant to learn unique probabilities for 
high-frequency background words of each group. Modelling the deviation of each group-specific word 
distribution cancels the relearn process for the background words. 

We propose dTM-SAGE which explicitly models the deviation in log-frequency of each group-
specific word distribution from a background lexical distribution. dTM-SAGE also builds word models 
for group-independent topic words and group-specific content words. The group-independent topic 
words consist of background topic words and salient topic words. 

dTM-SAGE models two types of group-independent words separately: as shown in Fig. 2, the sali-
ent topic words captured by ùúëùëò and the background topic words captured by œë0. The word models ùúëùëò 
and ùúó0 are multinomial distributions drawn from uniform Dirichlet prior with parameter ùõºùúë and ùõºùúó. 
To enable œë0 to capture real background topic words shared by all document groups, we replace the 
constant background distribution in SAGE with a latent distribution learnt by MAP estimation using a 
Newton optimization.  

The major difference between dTM-SAGE and dTM-Dirichlet is how the group-specific topics are 
generated. In Fig.2, each document group g has a group component vector ùúÇùëî representing the devia-
tions in log-frequencies from the background distribution œë0. The group-specific topic is represented 
by log frequency deviations rather than word probabilities. Given the background distribution œë0 and 
the group component vector ùúÇùëî, the group-specific topic distribution œëùëî for each word in a document 
in the group g, denoted by ùõùùíà ‚àù ùëíùë•ùëù(ùõùùüé + ùúºùíà), is computed by Equation (1): 

0 0, ,
( | , ) / exp( , )

g v g vv
p w Œ∏ Œ∑ Œ∏ Œ∑‚àë                                                  (1) 

In Equation (1), g indexes the group component vector and v indexes the term in the corpus vocabu-
lary. Following SAGE, we ignore covariance between terms. For each term v, ùúÇùëî,ùë£ is drawn from a 
zero-mean Gaussian distribution ùëÅ(0,ùúéùëî,ùë£), where the variance ùúéùëî,ùë£ is drawn from the Exponential 
distribution parameterized by ùõºùúé. The compound model ‚à´ùëÅ(Œ∑; 0,ùúé)ùê∏ùë•ùëùùëúùëõùëíùëõùë°ùëñùëéùëô(ùúé;ùõºùúé)ùëëùúé is equiv-
alent to a zero-mean Laplace prior on ùúÇ inducing sparsity and meanwhile permitting large degrees of 
deviations. In dTM-SAGE, we treat the variance ùúé as a latent variable and develop variational infer-
ence on it, which is the same as SAGE. The remaining part of dTM-SAGE is the same as dTM-
Dirichlet model. Formally, the generative process of dTM-SAGE is shown in Table 1. See Appendix A 
for inference details of ùõùùüé and ùúºùíà. 

4 Comparative Summary Generation 

To summarize differences among document groups, we rely on group-specific topics œëg to select most 
discriminative sentences for summary generation. This section introduces the sentence scoring and the 
sentence selection techniques developed for dTM-based comparative summarization.

4.1 Sentence Scoring 
Both dTM-Dirichlet and dTM-SAGE model the group-specific word distributions  ùúóùëî to capture the 
unique content in each document group. For dTM-SAGE, we can also get a corpus background topic 
distribution ùúó0 that reflects the common themes shared by all groups. To measure the sentence dis-
criminative capacity, we develop two sentence scoring methods: one is based on the word discrimina-
tive scores and the other is measured by the difference of the probabilities that a sentence is generated 
from a group-specific topic distribution and the background topic distribution.  

First, given a set of group-specific word distributions  ùúóùëî (1 ‚â§ ùëî ‚â§ G), we define the word discrimi-
native score ùê∑ùëÜùëä(ùë£,ùëî) of a term v to a group g as ùê∑ùëÜùëä(ùë£,ùëî) = ‚àë ( ùúóùëî,ùë£ ‚àí  ùúóùëî‚Ä≤,ùë£)ùëî‚Ä≤‚â†ùëî ÔøΩ‚àë ùúóùëî,ùë£2ùëî + ùúñ‚ÅÑ , where ùúñ is a 
small number (set to 0.05) to avoid the error of division by zero. Larger value of the word discrimina-
tive score indicates more discriminative ability the word has. The intuition is that a word more likely 
to occur in a particular group and less likely to occur in other groups tends to be more discriminative. 
The discriminative capacity of a sentence s to a group g ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùë†ùë§(ùë†,ùëî) is the average over the word 
discriminative scores: 

_ ( , ) ( , ) / ( )
w s

DCS dsw s g DSW w g len s
‚àà

= ‚àë                                 (2) 
The other method to measure the discriminative capacity of a sentence relies on the likelihood that 

the sentence is generated from a group-specific distribution and the background topic distribution. Its 
design is motivated by the idea that a word is more discriminative if it occurs more often in a group-
specific topic and occurs rarely in the shared background topic. Given a topic-word distribution ùúó, the 
probability of a sentence s generated from ùúó: 

log ( | ) log
ww s

P s Œ∏ Œ∏
‚àà

= ‚àë                                                      (3) 
Given a set of group-specific word distributions  ùúóùëî (1 ‚â§ ùëî ‚â§ G) and the background topic distribu-

tion ùúó0, the discriminative capacity of a sentence s to a group g is defined as the difference of sentence 
generative probabilities ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùëîùëù(ùë†,ùëî): 

0
_ ( , ) log ( | ) (1 )log ( | )

g
DCS dgp s g u P s u P sŒ∏ Œ∏= ‚àí ‚àí                      (4) 

where u is a balance factor trading off between group-specific words and background words. 

4.2 Sentence Selection 
To select discriminative sentences to form group summary, we use different sentence selection meth-
ods according to sentence scoring techniques. 

For the sentence scoring based on the word discriminative scores, we first rank the sentences ac-
cording to the sentence discriminative capacity score ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùë†ùë§. Then we select a sentence with the 
highest score if it satisfies the redundancy constraint that indicated by a cosine similarity threshold 
(empirically set to 0.8).  

For the scoring based on difference sentences generative probabilities, suppose we have a set of 
candidate sentences S to form a summary for group g and we want to select k sentences denoted as ùëÜùëò. 
A greedy sentence selection schema is proposed to build ùëÜùëò by iteratively choosing a jth sentence that 
currently has the maximum sentence discriminative capacity score ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùëîùëù:

‚àí‚àà

=                                                 (5) 

In order to discourage redundancy, after select one sentence, we update the group-specific topic dis-
tribution ùúóùëî by setting œëg,w ‚àù œëg,w2  for each word w in the selected sentence sj‚àó. Sentences are selected 
in this manner until reaching the summary limit. 

5 Experiments and Results 

5.1 Data Collection and Annotation 
Comparative summarization is not a new task. However, to our best knowledge there is no public 
benchmark data set available. For collecting experiment data, we choose three tasks in NLP: summari-
zation (SUMMA), sentiment analysis (SA) and geographical NLP tasks (GEO) to form three document 
groups. To make different groups share more salient themes, we focus on papers using probabilistic 

1032



topic models. We collect 129 papers in total for the three groups from ACL Anthology Searchbench  
providing full-text search for 28,000 papers in the ACL Anthology. For each group, we search with 
two types of keyword filters: plain text filter and title filter. Table 2 shows the general information of 
each document group, including the keywords, the number of documents |D| and the number of sen-
tences |S|. To pre-process the dataset, we exclude all tables, figures and formulas, remove stop words, 
perform stemming with Porter Stemmer, and prune words less than 5 times across the corpus. There 
are 3720 tokens after pre-processing.  

We hire three PhD students in Aston University to annotate the dataset. After reading papers in each 
group, each annotator is asked to first pick out all discriminative sentences in each paper and then 
write reference summaries delivering the major differences for each group. Additional instructions are 
given to annotators: Each reference summary should be no more than 300 words; and the discrimina-
tive sentences should enable the judgment of which group the paper belongs to. Equipped with the 
annotated dataset, two parts of evaluations are performed: evaluation of differential topic models and 
evaluation of the summarization methods. 

5.2 Evaluations on dTM 
In this section, we compare dTM-Dirichlet and dTM-SAGE with other three topic models in terms of 
model perplexity and topic coherences: (1) the standard LDA topic model, which we run across the 
corpus and perform Newton optimization to update hyper-parameters; (2) SAGE, which a sparse addi-
tive generative model proposed in (Eisenstein et al., 2011), and the non-parametric Jeffrey‚Äôs prior 
make it parameter-free; (3) the variant of DualSum, which is proposed for update summarization (De-
lort and Alfonseca, 2012) and revised to perform comparative summarization by replacing pairs of 
collection-specific distributions with group-specific distributions. We implement the variant of Du-
alSum, dTM-Dirichlet and dTM-SAGE models. Experimental settings are detailed below. 

Settings for the variant of DualSum. The dirichlet priors for word distributions are empirically set 
to 0.1 and ùõºùúÜ = (2.0,2.0,1.0) to encourage more words generated from the group-specific distributions 
and document-specific distributions.  

Settings for dTM-Dirichlet. The dirichlet priors for word distributions Œ±Œ¶ and Œ±Œ∏ are set to 0.1. For 
other papramenters, we set the number of group-independent topics K = 20, the prior for the topic 
distribution  Œ±Œ≥ = 50/ùêæ, and the prior for the group-specific word controller Œ±Œª = 2.0. Beta(2.0, 2.0) 
yields equal probabilities that words sampling from the group-specific distribution and the group-
independent distributions.  

Settings for dTM-SAGE. Parameters are set the same as those in dTM-Dirichlet: Œ±Œ¶ = Œ±Œ∏ =
0.1, K = 20, Œ±Œ≥ = 50/ùêæ and Œ±Œª = 2.0. The variational distribution of the variance ùõî is Gamma(ùõºÔøΩ , ùëèÔøΩ) 
which is initialized as ùõºÔøΩ = 10.0 and ùëèÔøΩ = 5.0. The initialization for ùõùùüé and ùõà are from the Uniform 
distribution ùëà(0, 1) and the Normal distribution ùëÅ(0, 0.5) respectively. 

First, we investigate the model perplexity. Perplexity is a general measure for evaluating the gen-
erative ability of a probabilistic topic model. We compute the perplexity on a held-out test set, 20% of 
the original dataset. Note that we calculate the perplexity for all models except the variant of DualSum, 
since it models the document-specific distribution for each document and thus there is no natural way 
to assign probability to new document. For the variant of DualSum, we train the model on the whole 
dataset and report the results on the test set, though it by no means can reflect the generalization ca-
pacity of the model. 

Perplexity results are shown in the first row in Table 3, from which we can see that the perplexity 
scores decrease by 7% and 13% respectively between dTM-Dirichlet and standard LDA and between 
dTM-SAGE and standard SAGE. The better results of differential topic models over the standard ones 
are due to the discrimination between group-specific topics and group-independent topics. Both SAGE 
methods outperform their counterparts of the Dirichlet-multinomial, because the sparsity-inducing pri-
or enables SAGE to control sparsity adaptively without over-fitting (Eisenstein et al., 2011).

To check the quality of the generated group-specific topics, we investigate various topic coherence 
measures. The intuition behind the topic coherence measures is that words clustering into a single top-
ic tend to co-occur in the same document. It has been previously verified that topic coherence score is 
highly correlated with human-judged topic coherence in many works. We rely on Palmetto library 
(R√∂der et al., 2015), an online open source implementation, which offers a framework to calculate 
many coherence measures within a reference corpus of the English Wikipedia.  

In our experiment, we compare three widely-used coherence scores over the five topic models: (1) 
C_A, which is the pairwise comparison of the top words based on a context window of size 5, and 
proposed in (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013); (2) C_V, which is a one-set segmentation of the top words 
based on a sliding window of size 110, and proposed in (R√∂der et al., 2015); (3) C_UCI, which is the 
pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the top words based on a sliding window of 
size 10, and proposed in (Newman et al., 2010). 

We focus on the group-specific topics. For each group-specific topic-word distribution we get a 
word list containing the top-20 words and calculate the coherence scores for each word list. The topic 
coherence results shown in Table 3 are the average coherence scores of the three group word lists. The 
coherence scores are calculated within two reference corpus: the English Wikipedia (Wiki) and the 
original dataset (Intra). Table 4 shows the top 10 words selected by SAGE, dTM-SAGE and dTM-
Dirichlet for the group SUMMA. Main observations found in Table 3 include:  

(1) The three differential topic models generally perform much better than the standard LDA and 
SAGE models on all coherence measures, which shows the superiority of our dTM models by distin-
guishing group-specific words and group-independent words; 

(2) dTM-SAGE consistently performs the best among all the five models in terms of C_A and 
C_UCI with the significant increase at least by 6.5% over dTM-Dirichlet and 8.2% over the variant of 
DualSum, which shows the advantage of dTM-SAGE in accurately ranking the group-specific words 
due to the essence of the differential word model; 

(3) dTM-Dirichlet outperforms the variant of DualSum with C_A and C_V, however, it performs 
nearly the same or even worse when measured with C_UCI. 

As shown in Table 4, words selected by dTM-SAGE (like rouge, lexrank, redundant) are more in-
formative and discriminative than words selected by SAGE and dTM-Dirichlet. 

5.3 Evaluations on Summarization 
To evaluate the quality of the generated summaries, we compare our dTM-based comparative summa-
rization methods with five other typical methods under ROUGE metrics (Lin and Hovy, 2003).  Fur-
ther, to check the discriminative ability of the comparative summaries, following the evaluation meth-
od of (Wang et al., 2012), we investigate the precision of the discriminative sentence selection. 

In our experiment, we implement three types of summarization methods: (1) Generic baseline 
methods, including the centroid-based method (Radev et al. 2004), the graph-based method LexPag-

Summary by dTM-Dirichlet. 
‚ë†Most of the existing multi-document summarization methods decompose the 
documents into sentences and work directly in the sentence space using a term-
sentence matrix. 
‚ë°Bayesian sentences-based topic model, every sentences in a document is as-
sumed to be associated to a unique latent topic. 
‚ë¢While previous MDS systems have focused primarily on salience and coverage 
but not coherence, G-Flow generates an ordered summary by jointly optimizing 
coherence and salience. 
‚ë£Markov Random Walk Model (MRW) Graphs methods have been successfully 
applied to weighting sentences for generic and query-focused summarization. 
‚ë§The topic distributions are used to get the sentence scores and rank sentences. 
Summary by dTM-SAGE. 
‚ë†In recent years, three major techniques have emerged to perform multi-document 
summarization: graph-based methds such as LexRank, Biased-LexRank for query-
focused summarization, language models such as KLSum and variants based on 
topic models, such as BayeSum and TopicSum. 
‚ë° Bayesian Query-Focused Summarization, we present BayeSum (Bayesian 
summarization), a model for sentence extraction in query-focused summarization. 
‚ë¢Sentence Selection Strategy, The task of timeline summarization aims to produce 
a summary for each time and the generated summary should meet criteria such as 
relevance, coverage and coherence. 
‚ë£Models that use more structure in the representation of documents have also been 
proposed for generating more coherent and less redundant summaries, such as 
HierSUM and TTM. 
‚ë§In generating a summary, we use MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance for multi-
document) to avoid redundancy in a summary.

the-art comparative summarization methods, including the discriminative sentence selection (DSS) 
method (Wang et al., 2012) and the complementary dominating set (CDS) method (Shen and Li, 2010); 
(3) TM-based comparative summarization methods, which combine four different TMs with two sen-
tence scoring strategies ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùë†ùë§  and ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùëîùëù  defined in section 4.1, including the 
basic ùêøùê∑ùê¥ (ùëëùë†ùë§) , the variant of ùê∑ùë¢ùëéùëôùëÜùë¢ùëö (ùëëùë†ùë§) , dTM-Dirichlet (ùëëùë†ùë§) , dTM-SAGE (ùëëùë†ùë§)  and 
dTM-SAGE (ùëëùëîùëù). For each group, we select 20 sentences to form the final summary. 

First, we examine the precision of the discriminative sentence selection. For each group we have 20 
sentences in a summary and count how many sentences belong to the annotated discriminative sen-
tence set. Comparisons of the precision results of discriminative sentence selection by different meth-
ods are shown at the last column in Table 5. From the precision results, we find that (1) our dTM-
based comparative summarization methods can select over 70% discriminative sentences, which sig-
nificantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods with a nearly 20% increase on the precision score; 
(2) All generic summarization methods perform rather worse due to different concerns on summariza-
tion resulting in the lack of discriminative ability of summaries.  

We use ROUGE-1.5.5 toolkit to evaluate the quality of generated summaries by comparing them 
with human-written reference summaries. In our experiment, we limit the length of all summaries to 
250 words and report the average ROUGE scores (F-Scores) on various summarization methods in 
Table 5. According to the results, we observe that: (1) our dTM-based comparative summarization 
methods perform much better (paired t-test with p<0.05) than all the baselines, which demonstrates 
that targeting at a different goal for summarizing the general information among document groups, 
generic summarization methods are less applicable for comparative summarization, though by remov-
ing redundancy, MMR performs better than the other two baselines but still lags behind other summa-
rization methods specifically proposed for comparative summarization; (2) our dTM-based compara-
tive summarization methods significantly outperform (paired t-test with p<0.05) the other two state-of-
the-art comparative summarization methods, which shows that summarizing differences by extracting 
group-specific topics is more effective than directly summarizing at the sentence level; (3) Both dTM-
SAGE methods achieve better ROUGE scores than dTM-Dirichlet, which is ascribe to the advantage 
of a differential word model contributing to more informative and discriminative group-specific topics 
(discussed in section 5.2); and, (4) For dTM-SAGE, the greedy sentence selection schema based on 
ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùëîùëù is more effective than simply ranking sentence with ùê∑ùê∂ùëÜ_ùëëùë†ùë§. 

5.4 Summary Example 
We show an example of the summary generated for the group SUMMA by our dTM-SAGE and dTM-
Dirichlet in Table 6. Looking into the summaries, we find that all sentences in both summaries are 
related to summarization but different in the degree of their discriminative ability. Apparently, the 
summary generated by dTM-SAGE is more specific and unique to summarization, while the summary 
generated by dTM-Dirichlet still contains some general information about topic models in sentence ‚ë° 
and ‚ë§. Another observation is that the summary of dTM-SAGE tends to contain more salient group-
specific terms that may not occur in most of group documents but still possess high discrimination, 
like ‚Äòquery-focused‚Äô, ‚ÄòMMR‚Äô and ‚ÄòHierSUM‚Äô. In contrast, the summary by dTM-Dirichlet covers more 
background group-specific words, like ‚Äòsummarization‚Äô and ‚ÄòMDS‚Äô. Although these background 
group-specific terms are discriminative for the group, they are relatively less informative than the sali-
ent terms for the purpose of summarization.  

6 Conclusions 
This paper studies the differential topic models for comparative summarization on cross-area scientific 
papers. A differential topic model dTM-SAGE is proposed to capture the unique characteristics of each 
document group and generate coherent group-specific topics. A greedy sentence selection method with 
two sentence discriminative capacity scoring schemas is designed to automatically generate summary 
for dTM-based comparative summarization methods, which achieve significant improvements with 
various ROUGE metrics. The analysis on experiment results shows that the summaries generated by 
our dTM-SAGE method can cover major differences for each group.
