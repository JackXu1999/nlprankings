Abstract

This paper describes the Linear A/Minoan
digital corpus and the approaches we ap-
plied to develop it.

We aim to set up a suitable study resource
for Linear A and Minoan.

Firstly we start by introducing Linear A
and Minoan in order to make it clear why
we should develop a digital marked up cor-
pus of the existing Linear A transcriptions.

Secondly we list and describe some of the
existing resources about Linear A: Lin-
ear A documents (seals, statuettes, ves-
sels etc.), the traditional encoding systems
(standard code numbers referring to dis-
tinct symbols), a Linear A font, and the
newest (released on June 16th 2014) Uni-
code Standard Characters set for Linear A.

Thirdly we explain our choice concerning
the data format: why we decided to dig-
itize the Linear A resources; why we de-
cided to convert all the transcriptions in
standard Unicode characters; why we de-
cided to use an XML format; why we de-
cided to implement the TEI-EpiDoc DTD.

Lastly we describe: the developing pro-
cess (from the data collection to the issues
we faced and the solving strategies); a new
font we developed (synchronized with the
Unicode Characters Set) in order to make
the data readable even on systems that are
not updated. Finally, we discuss the cor-
pus we developed in a Cultural Heritage
preservation perspective and suggest some
future works.

1 Introduction to Linear A and Minoan

Linear A is the script used by the Minoan Civiliza-
tion (Cotterell, 1980) from 2500 to 1450 BC.

Writing system Time span
Cretan Hieroglyphic 2100 – 1700 BC
Linear A 2500 – 1450 BC
Linear B 1450 – 1200 BC

Table 1: Time spans of Cretan Hieroglyphic, Lin-
ear A and Linear B.

The Minoan Civilization arose on the island of
Crete in the Aegean Sea during the Bronze Age.
Minoan ruins and artifacts have been found mainly
in Crete but also in other Greek islands and in
mainland Greece, in Bulgaria, in Turkey and in Is-
rael.

Linear A is not used anymore and, even after
decades of studies (it was discovered by Sir Arthur
Evans around 1900 (Evans, 1909)), it still remains
undeciphered.

All the assumptions and hypotheses made about
Linear A and Minoan (its underlying language)
are mainly based on the comparison with the well
known Linear B, the famous child system origi-
nated by Linear A. In fact, Linear B was fully deci-
phered during the 1950s by Michael Ventris 1 and
was found to encode an ancient Greek dialect used
by the Mycenaean civilization.

Archaeologist Arthur Evans named the script
‘Linear’ because it consisted just of lines inscribed
in clay (Robinson, 2009) while, in the same period
(as shown in Table 1), Cretan hieroglyphs were
more pictographic and three-dimensional .

Even if many symbols are shared by both Linear
A and Linear B, it has not been possible to find
intelligible words within inscriptions in Linear A
by applying Linear B segmentation and phonemes.

Linear A consists of hundreds of symbols prob-
ably having syllabic, ideographic, and semantic
values. Many of the Linear A symbols that are

ing attempt.

found in Linear B (81 in total) are assumed to have
syllabic values, while the remaining are assumed
to be logograms.

There have been several attempts to decipher
Linear A and the Minoan Language. We can
divide the underlying hypotheses in six groups:
Greek-like language (Nagy, 1963), distinct Indo-
European branch (Owens, 1999), Anatolian lan-
guage close to Luwian (Palmer, 1958), archaic
form of Phoenician (Dietrich and Loretz, 2001),
Indo-Iranian (Faure, 1998) and Etruscan-like lan-
guage (Giulio M. Facchetti and Negri, 2003).

There is also an interesting attempt (Younger,
2000b) to decipher single words, specifically to-
ponyms, by applying Linear B phonetic values to
the symbols shared by both Linear A and Linear B
and following the assumption that toponyms are
much more likely to survive as loans in Myce-
naean Greek (written in Linear B); we show an
example of this approach in Table 2.

In the next sections we describe the available
existing resources concerning Linear A and the
Linear A Digital Corpus: why and how we devel-
oped it.

2 Linear A available resources

Even if Linear A and Linear B were discovered
more than one century ago, Linear A has not
been deciphered yet. Nevertheless, many schol-
ars worked on collecting and organizing all the
available data in order to study and to decipher the
script and the language.

Probably due to the fact that only historical lin-
guists, philologists and archaeologists attempted
to collect and organize all the existing data, nowa-
days a rich and well organized digital corpus is
still not available.

In this section we describe all the available Lin-
ear A resources, including both physical docu-
ments and digital data.

2.1 Linear A documents

Linear A was written on a variety of media, such
as stone offering tables, gold and silver hair pins,
and pots (inked and inscribed).

The clay documents consist of tablets, roundels,
and sealings (one-hole, two-hole, and flat-based).

Roundels are related to a "conveyance of a com-
modity, either within the central administration or
between the central administration and an exter-
nal party" (Palmer, 1995; Schoep, 2002). The
roundel is the record of this transaction that stays
within the central administration as the commod-
ity moves out of the transacting bureau (Hal-
lager, 1996). Two-hole sealings probably dangled
from commodities brought into the center; one-
hole sealings apparently dangled from papyrus/-
parchment documents; flat-based sealings (them-
selves never inscribed) were pressed against the
twine that secured papyrus/parchment documents
(Younger, 2000g; Schoep, 2002) as shown by pho-
tographs (Müller, 1999), (Müller, 2002) of the im-
prints that survive on the underside of flat-based
sealings.

There are 1,427 Linear A documents containing
7,362-7,396 signs, much less than the quantity of
data we have for Linear B (more than 4,600 docu-
ments containing 57,398 signs) (Younger, 2000f).

2.2 Godart and Olivier’s Collection of Linear
A Inscriptions

There is a complete and organized collection
of Linear A documents on a paper corpus, the
GORILA Louis Godart and Jean-Pierre Olivier,
Recueil des inscriptions en Linéaire A (Godart
and Olivier, 1976).

10601 AB02 L22 RO
10602 AB03 L2 PA

Table 4: Excerpt of John G. Younger’s transcrip-
tion systems conversion table extended with the
Unicode codes.

Godart and Olivier have indexed the documents
by original location and type of support, following
the Raison–Pope Index (Raison and Pope, 1971).

For example, the document AP Za 1 is from AP
= Apodoulou and the support type is Za = stone
vessels as shown in Table 3.

Younger (2000h) provides a map with all the
Cretan sites and one with all the Greek non-Cretan
sites (Younger, 2000i).

Godart and Olivier also provide referential data
about conservation places (mainly museums), and
periodization (for example: EM II = Second Early
Minoan).

Since 1976, this has been the main source of
data and point of reference about Linear A doc-
uments and it has set up the basis for further
studies. Even recent corpora, such as the Cor-
pus transnuméré du linéaire A (Raison and Pope,
1994), always refer to GORILA precise volumes
and pages describing each document.

2.3 John G. Younger’s website

Younger (2000j) has published a website that is
the best digital resource available (there is an-
other interesting project, never completed, on Yan-
nis Deliyannis’s website2). It collects most of
the existing inscriptions (taking GORILA as main
source of data and point of reference) transcribed
as Linear B phonetic values (like the KU-NI-SU
transcription above).

The transcriptions are kept up to date and a
complete restructuring in June 2015 has been an-
nounced (Younger, 2000j).

2.4 GORILA symbols catalogue

Many transcription systems have been defined.
The first one has been proposed by Raison and

Pope (1971) and uses a string composed by one or
two characters (Lm, L or Lc depending on the sym-
bol, respectively metric, phonetic or compound)
followed by a number, for example: L2.

2http://y.deliyannis.free.fr/linearA/

This system has been widely used by many
scholars such as David Woodley Packard (presi-
dent of the Packard Humanities Institute3), Colin
Renfrew and Richard Janko (Packard, 1974; Ren-
frew, 1977; Janko, 1982).

The second one, used in the GORILA collec-
tion (Godart and Olivier, 1976) and on John G.
Younger’s website, consists of a string composed
by one or two characters (AB if the symbol is
shared by Linear A and Linear B, A if the symbol
is only used in Linear A) followed by a number
and eventually other alphabetical characters (due
to addenda and corrigenda to earlier versions), for
example: AB03.

Many scholars transcribe the symbols shared by
Linear A and B with the assumed phonetical/syl-
labic transcription. This syllabic transcription is
based on the corresponding Linear B phonetic val-
ues. Younger (2000a) provides a conversion table
of Pope and Raison’s transcription system, GO-
RILA’s transcription system and his own phonet-
ic/syllabic transcription system.

Developing our corpus, we worked mainly on
Younger’s syllabic and GORILA transcriptions,
because the Unicode Linear A encoding is broadly
based on the GORILA catalogue, which is also
the basic set of characters used in decipherment
efforts4. We provide an example of different tran-
scriptions for the same symbol in Table 4. As can
be noticed, the Unicode encoding is based on the
GORILA transcription system.

2.5 Linear A Font

The best Linear A Font available is LA.ttf, re-
leased by D.W. Borgdorff5 in 2004.

In this font some arbitrary Unicode positions for
Latin characters are mapped to Linear A symbols.

On one hand this allows the user to type Lin-
ear A symbols directly by pressing the keys on the
keyboard; on the other hand, only transliterations
can be produced. The text eventually typed inter-
nally will be a series of Latin characters.

It should be remarked that this font would not
be useful to make readable a Linear A corpus that
is non-translittered and encoded in Unicode.

2.6 Unicode Linear A Characters Set
On June 16th 2014, Version 7.0 of Unicode stan-
dard was released6, adding 2,834 new characters
and including, finally, the Linear A character set.

Linear A block has been set in the range 10600–
1077F and the order mainly follows GORILA’s
one7, as seen in Table 4.

This Unicode Set covers simple signs, vase
shapes, complex signs, complex signs with vase
shapes, fractions and compound fractions.

This is a resource that opens, for the first time,
the possibility to develop a Linear A digital cor-
pus not consisting of a transliteration or alternative
transcription.

3 Corpus data format

Many scholars have faced the issues for data cura-
tion and considered various possibilities.

Among all the possible solutions, we chose to
develop the Linear A Digital Corpus as a collec-
tion of TEI-EpiDoc XML documents.

In this section we explain why.

3.1 Why Digital?
Many epigraphic corpora have begun to be digital-
ized; there are many reasons to do so.

A digital corpus can include several representa-
tions of the inscriptions (Mahoney, 2007):

• pictures of the original document;

• pictures of drawings or transcriptions made
by hand simplifying the document;

• diplomatic transcriptions;

• edited texts;

• translations;

• commentaries.

Building a database is enough to get much
richer features than the ones a paper corpus would
provide. The most visible feature of an epi-
graphic database is its utility as an Index Univer-
salis (Gómez Pantoja and Álvarez, 2011); unlike
hand-made indexes, there is no need to constrain
the number of available search-keys.

Needless to say, the opportunity to have the data
available also on the web is valuable.

announcing-unicode-standard-version-
70.html

7http://www.unicode.org/versions/
Unicode7.0.0/ch08.pdf

3.2 Why Unicode?

Text processing must also take into account the
writing systems represented in the corpus.

If the corpus consists of inscriptions written in
the Latin alphabet, then the writing system of the
inscriptions is the same as that of the Western
European modern languages used for meta-data,
translations, and commentaries.

In our case, unluckily, we have to deal with Lin-
ear A, so we need to find a way to represent our
text.

Scholars objected to epigraphic databases on
the ground of its poor graphic ability to represent
non-Latin writing systems (García Barriocanal et
al., 2011).

This led to the use of non-standard fonts in some
databases which probed to be a bad move, com-
promising overall compatibility and system up-
grading.

This approach is appealing because if the corpus
needs to be printed, sooner or later fonts will be a
need in all cases.

The font-based solution assumes that all the
software involved can recognize font-change
markers. Unluckily, some Database Management
Systems (DMSs) do not allow changes of font
within a text field and some export or interchange
formats lose font information.

When the scripts of the corpus are all supported,
which will be the case for any script still used by a
living language, Unicode is a better approach. De-
spite Minoan not being a living language, Linear
A is finally part of the Unicode 7.0 Character Code
Charts 8 but some sign groups conventionally in-
terpreted as numbers have no Unicode representa-
tion.

3.3 Why XML?

Until not so long ago, markup systems have al-
ways involved special typographical symbols in
the text—brackets, underdots, and so on.

Some epigraphers see XML as a natural trans-
formation of what they have always done, with all
the additional benefits that come from standardiza-
tion within the community.

There is a growing consensus that XML is the
best way to encode text.

Some corpora may also use the typographical
marks of the Leiden system, which has the advan-

</glyph>

tage of being entirely familiar to the epigraphers
who create and maintain the corpus.

Unfortunately, the special brackets, underdots,
and other typographical devices may not be sup-
ported by the character set of the computer system
to be used.

A key incentive for using XML is the ability to
exchange data with other projects.

It is convenient to be able to divide the informa-
tion in many layers: cataloging, annotating, com-
menting and editing the inscriptions.

In some cases, merging different layers from
different projects could be a need (for example
when each of these projects is focused on a spe-
cific layer, for which provides the best quality), as
a consequence the resulting data should be in com-
patible forms.

If the projects use the same Document Type
Definition (DTD), in the same way, this is rela-
tively easy.

While corpora that store their texts as word-
processor files with Leiden markup can also share
data, they must agree explicitly on the details of
text layout, file formats, and character encodings.

With XML, it is possible to define either ele-
ments or entities for unsupported characters.

This feature is particularly interesting in our
case, giving a solution for the numbers representa-
tion (Linear A numbers, except for fractions, have
no Unicode representation). Suppose you want to
mark up the sign group , conventionally inter-
preted as the number 5, in the XML. As specified
in the TEI DTD, this could be expressed as <g
ref="#n5"/>, where the element g indicates
a glyph, or a non-standard character and the at-
tribute value points to the element glyph, which
contains information about the specific glyph. An
example is given in Figure 1.

Alternatively, the project might define an entity

to represent this character.
Either way, the XML text notes that there is the

Linear A number 5, and the later rendering of the
text for display or printing can substitute the ap-
propriate character in a known font, a picture of
the character, or even a numeral from a different
system. Such approaches assume that tools are
available for these conversions; some application,
transformation, or stylesheet must have a way to
know how to interpret the given element or entity.

The usage of XML provides two advantages: in
first place, it makes possible the encoding of the
characters that occur in the text (as shown above);
in second place, it’s really useful for encoding
meta-information.

3.4 Why EpiDoc?
If a project decides to use XML, the most appro-
priate DTD (or schema) to be used needs to be
chosen. As in every other humanities discipline,
the basic question is whether to use a general
DTD, like the TEI, or to write a project-specific
one. Some projects need DTDs that are extremely
specific to the types of inscriptions they are deal-
ing with, instead other projects prefer to rely on
existing, widely used DTDs.

Mahoney (2007) has deeply analyzed all the
digitization issues, taking into account all the
advantages and disadvantages of different ap-
proaches; her conclusion is that it’s best to use
EpiDoc9 an XML encoding tool that could be also
used to write structured documents compliant with
the TEI standard10.

The EpiDoc DTD is the TEI, with a few epi-
graphically oriented customizations made using
the standard TEI mechanisms. Rather than writ-
ing a DTD for epigraphy from scratch, the Epi-
Doc group uses the TEI because TEI has already
addressed many of the taxonomic and semantic
challenges faced by epigraphers, because the TEI-
using community can provide a wide range of
best-practice examples and guiding expertise, and
because existing tooling built around TEI could
easily lead to early and effective presentation and
use of TEI-encoded epigraphic texts (Mahoney,
2007).

The TEI and EpiDoc approaches have already
been adopted by several epigraphic projects (Bo-
dard, 2009), such as the Dêmos project (Furman

9http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/
Projects/ep01.xml

10http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml

99



University) and the corpus of Macedonian and
Thracian inscriptions being compiled at KERA,
the Research Center for Greek and Roman Antiq-
uity at Athens (Mahoney, 2007).

Also other scholars evaluate EpiDoc as a suit-
able choice. Felle (2011) compares the EAGLE
(Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigra-
phy11) project with the EpiDoc existing resources,
viewing these resources as different but comple-
mentary.

Álvarez et al. (2010) and Gómez Pantoja and
Álvarez (2011) discuss the possibility of sharing
Epigraphic Information as EpiDoc-based Linked
Data and describe how they implemented a
relational-to-linked data solution for the Hispania
Epigraphica database.

Cayless (2003) evaluates EpiDoc as a relevant
digital tool for Epigraphy allowing for a uniform
representation of epigraphic metadata.

The EpiDoc guidelines are emerging as one
standard for digital epigraphy with the TEI.

EpiDoc is not the only possible way to use the
TEI for epigraphic texts but the tools, documenta-
tion, and examples12 make it a good environment
for new digitization projects as ours.

3.5 EpiDoc structure

An EpiDoc document is structured as a stan-
dard TEI document with the teiHeader
element including some initial Desc sec-
tions (fileDesc, encodingDesc,
profileDesc, revisionDesc, etc) con-
taining metadata, general information and
descriptions (here we annotated place, period,
kind of support and specific objects/fragments
IDs). An interesting use of encodingDesc is
shown in Figure 1 above: the gliph element has
to be defined inside its parent element charDecl
and its grandparent element encodingDesc.

The teiHeader element is followed by the
text element including the body element com-
posed by a series of unnumbered <div>s, distin-
guished by their type attributes (we show an ex-
ample of the Epidoc <div> element in Figure 2).

Typical divisions might include:

• text itself (type="edition");

• translation (type="translation");

The EpiDoc DTD introduces a finite set of pos-
sible values for the type of a <div>, so that there

100



is a clear distinction between sections covering
different aspects, such as the commentary, the de-
scription or the archaeological history.

One advantage of structured markup is that
editors can encode more information about how
certain a particular feature is. The date of an
inscription, for example, can be encoded as a
range of possible dates. EpiDoc includes the TEI
<certainty> element and the cert attribute to
encourage editors to say whether or not they are
completely confident of a given reading. After
some discussion, the EpiDoc community (Ma-
honey, 2007) decided that certainty should be ex-
pressed as a yes-or-no value: either the editor is
certain of the reading, or not. Gradual certainty is
too complicated to manage and is best explained
in the commentary.

4 Developing the Linear A Corpus

The hope that computational approaches could
help decipher Linear A, along with the evident
lack of rich digital resources in this field, led us
to develop this new resource. In this section we
describe which issues we faced and which solving
strategies we used.

4.1 Data Collection

Luckily the existence of Younger’s website and
GORILA volumes, together with the Raison–Pope
Index, made possible a semi-automatic collec-
tion process, starting from syllabic transcriptions
taken from Younger’s website (with his permis-
sion), converting them in Unicode strings through
Python scripts and acquiring all the metadata pro-
vided in Younger’s transcriptions (location and
support IDs, conservation place, periodization
etc.).

Younger’s resources on his website consist of
two HTML pages, one containing inscriptions
from Haghia Triada (that is the richest location
in terms of documents found there) (Younger,
2000k) and the other containing documents from
all the other locations (Younger, 2000l).

Younger’s transcriptions are well enriched with
metadata. The metadata convey the same infor-
mation found in GORILA, including the Raison–
Pope Index, plus some additional description of
the support (this was not necessary in GORILA
volumes, where the transcriptions are shown just
next to the documents pictures) and the reference
to the specific GORILA volume and pages.

4.2 Segmentation Issues

When working on ancient writing systems, seg-
mentation issues are expected to come up. John
G. Younger explains (Younger, 2000c) that in Lin-
ear A separation is mainly indicated in two ways:
first, by associating sign groups with numbers or
logograms, thereby implying a separation; second,
by placing a dot between two sign groups, thereby
explicitly separating the sign groups or between a
sign group and some other sign like a transaction
sign or a logogram. Younger also explains that in
texts that employ a string of sign groups, dots are
used to separate them and this practice is most no-
table on non-bureaucratic texts and especially in
religious texts.

On his website, Younger also covers the hyph-
enization issue (Younger, 2000d), explaining that
in some cases we find a split across lines and the
reason may involve separating prefixes from base
words (the root of a sign group) or base words
from their suffixes. As Younger points out, this
hypothesis would require evidence showing that
affixes are involved. The hyphenization issue is
more complex to solve because a ‘neutral’ re-
source should avoid transcriptions implying a well
known segmentation for Linear A sign groups. In
Younger’s transcriptions, split sign groups are re-
unified in order to make it clearer when a known
sign group is there. Instead, our digital collection
keeps the text as it is on the document, all the in-
formation about interpretations of such kind can
be stored separately.

4.3 Obtaining Unicode transcriptions

We managed to obtain Unicode encoded tran-
scriptions by automatically converting Younger’s
phonetic transcriptions to GORILA transcriptions
(manually checked against GORILA volumes)
and then by automatically converting GORILA
transcriptions to Unicode codes and printing them
as Unicode characters (UTF-8 encoding). In or-
der to create the syllables-to-GORILA and the
GORILA-to-Unicode dictionaries, we took into
account Younger’s conversion table mentioned in
Subsection 2.4 and the official Unicode documen-
tation (containing explicit Unicode-to-GORILA
mapping information). All these processing steps
have been implemented through Python scripts.

101



4.4 XML annotation

Once collected the whole corpus encoded in Uni-
code, we automatically added part of the XML
annotation through a python script. These doc-
uments have been later manually corrected and
completed, checking against GORILA volumes.

4.5 A new Linear A font

Before the Unicode 7.0 release, there was no
way to visualize Unicode characters in the range
10600–1077F. Even now, systems that are not up-
dated may have trouble to visualize those char-
acters. Some implementations for Unicode sup-
port in certain contexts (for example for LATEX’s
output) are not always up-to-date, so it is not
obvious that the fonts for the most recent char-
acters sets are available. We decided to de-
velop a new Linear A font, solving the main
issue found in LA.ttf (wrong Unicode posi-
tions). Starting from the official Unicode docu-
mentation, we created a set of symbols graphi-
cally similar to the official ones and aligned them
to the right Unicode positions. We decided to
name the font John_Younger.ttf to show
our appreciation for Younger’s work. He made
the results of GORILA available to a wider pub-
lic on digital media; this is the same goal we
want to pursue by developing and distributing
this font. We released the font file at the fol-
lowing URL: http://openfontlibrary.
org/en/font/john-younger.

5 The Linear A Digital Corpus as
cultural resource

As stated by European Commission (2015) and
UNESCO (2003), the meaning of the notion of
cultural heritage does not apply just to material
objects and works of art, but also to ‘intangible
cultural heritage’, as traditions and creative ex-
pressions. In this perspective, linguistic corpora
fit perfectly this definition; in fact, they contain in-
formation about tradition, knowledge and lifestyle
of a certain culture.

Despite the fact that the Minoan language has
not yet been deciphered, we know that the Lin-
ear A corpus provides interesting information con-
cerning economy, commerce and religion.

As mentioned in Subsection 2.1, Schoep (2002)
made a critical assessment of the Linear A tablets
and their role in the administrative process, study-
ing the physical supports.

Ruth Palmer (1995) made a deep study of com-
modities distributions (listing precise quantities
and places) among Minoan centers, even without
a full understanding of documents contents. As
Palmer points out, ‘the ideograms for basic com-
modities, and the formats of the Linear A texts are
similar enough to their Linear B counterparts to
allow valid comparison of the types and amounts
of commodities which appear in specific contexts’.
So, it’s possible to have ‘an idea of the focus of the
economy’ and of ‘the scale and complexity of the
transactions’. From the linear A tablets, we can
infer information about the resources management
and administration system of Minoan centers.

Van den Kerkhof and Rem (2007) analyzed the
Minoan libation formulas: religious inscriptions
on cups, ladles and tables that were used in the
offerings of oil and other powerful drinks at dawn.
The priestesses that carried out the Minoan liba-
tion ritual used all kinds of utensils, and they often
inscribed their sacred formulas onto these objects.
Around thirty of these texts have survived (whole
or in part) on libation tables, ladles and vases, writ-
ten in various kinds of handwriting. Transcripts
of these religious inscriptions are available from
Consani et al. (1999) and from John G. Younger
(2000m) on his website. As noticed by Duhoux
(1989) the Minoan libation formulas have a fixed
structure with variable elements. In fact, some
studies (Davis, 2014) about Minoan syntax have
been made by observing the sign groups order
found in these regular formulas. More impor-
tantly, the presence of olive-like ideograms could
tell us that the Minoans used olive oil for libation
(Van den Kerkhof and Rem, 2007). Beyond all
these parts of the Minoan cultural heritage already
available, a huge part is preserved there too: the
Minoan language, with its hidden stories reflect-
ing the life of a civilization. We hope that our
contribution can be useful to the community and
that the Minoan, in its digital form, may finally be
deciphered through computational approaches.

6 Future Work

We are working on XSL style sheets in order
to create suitable HTML pages. All the data
will be freely available and published at the fol-
lowing URL: http://ling.ied.edu.HK/
~gregoire/lineara. A further step will be
developing a web interface to annotate, and dy-
namically enrich the corpus information.
