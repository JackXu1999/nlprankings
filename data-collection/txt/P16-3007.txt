Abstract

Online newspaper articles can accumulate
comments at volumes that prevent close
reading. Summarisation of the comments
allows interaction at a higher level and
can lead to an understanding of the over-
all discussion. Comment summarisation
requires topic clustering, comment rank-
ing and extraction. Clustering must be ro-
bust as the subsequent extraction relies on
a good set of clusters. Comment data, as
with many social media datasets, contains
very short documents and the number of
words in the documents is a limiting fac-
tors on the performance of LDA cluster-
ing. We evaluate whether we can combine
comments to form larger documents to im-
prove the quality of clusters. We find that
combining comments with comments that
reply to them produce the highest quality
clusters.

1 Introduction

Newspaper articles can accumulate many hun-
dreds and sometimes thousands of online com-
ments. When studied closely and analysed effec-
tively they provide multiple points of view and
a wide range of experience and knowledge from
diverse sources. However, the number of com-
ments produced per article can prohibit close read-
ing. Summarising the content of these comments
allows users to interact with the data at a higher
level, providing a transparency to the underlying
data (Greene and Cross, 2015).

The current state of the art within the comment
summarisation field is to cluster comments us-
ing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic mod-
elling (Khabiri et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012;
Llewellyn et al., 2014). The comments within

each topic cluster are ranked and comments are
typically extracted to construct a summary of the
cluster. In this paper we focus on the clustering
subtask. It is important that the clustering is ap-
propriate and robust as the subsequent extraction
relies on a good set of clusters. Research in a re-
lated domain has found that topical mistakes were
the largest source of error in summarising blogs –
(Mithun and Kosseim, 2009) a similar data type.

Comment data, as with many social media
datasets, differs from other content types as each
‘document’ is very short. Previous studies have
indicated that the number of documents and the
number of words in the documents are limiting
factors on the performance of topic modelling
(Tang et al., 2014). Topic models built using
longer documents and using more documents are
more accurate. Short documents can be enriched
with external data. In our corpus the number of
comments on each newspaper article is finite and
the topics discussed within each set have evolved
from the original article. We therefore decided not
to increase the set with data from external sources.

In this work we consider whether we can com-
bine comments within a comments dataset to form
larger documents to improve the quality of clus-
ters. Combining comments into larger documents
reduces the total number of comments available to
cluster which may decrease the quality of the clus-
ters. The contribution of this work is in showing
that combining comments with their direct replies,
their children, increases the quality of the cluster-
ing. This approach can be applied to any other
task which requires clustering of newspaper com-
ments and any other data which contains small
documents linked using a thread like structure.
Combining data in this way to improve the clus-
tering reduces the need to import data from exter-
nal sources or to adapt the underlying clustering
algorithm.

2.1 Summarisation

The summarisation domain is well developed. The
earliest focus of the field was single document
summarisation – for a survey paper see (Gupta and
Lehal, 2010). This approach was extended into the
summarisation of multiple documents on the same
topic (Goldstein et al., 2000) and to summarising
discussions such as email or Twitter conversations
(Cselle et al., 2007; Sharifi et al., 2010; Inouye and
Kalita, 2011).

The basic idea behind the summarisation of tex-
tual data is the grouping together of similar infor-
mation and describing those groups (Rambow et
al., 2004). Once these groups are formed they are
described using either an extractive or abstractive
approach. Extractive summarisation uses units of
text, generally sentences, from within the data in
the group to represent the group. Abstractive sum-
marisation creates a description of the data in the
group as a whole, analogous to the approach a hu-
man would take.

2.1.1 Comment Summarisation
Abstractive summarisation is a very complex task,
and because comment summarisation is a rela-
tively new task, current work mostly focuses on
extractive approaches. The general task involves
clustering the comments into appropriate topics
and then extracting comments, or parts of com-
ments to represent those topics (Khabiri et al.,
2011; Ma et al., 2012). Ma et al. (2012)
summarise discussion on news articles from Ya-
hoo!News and Khabiri et al (2011) summarise
comments on YouTube videos. Both studies agree
on the definition of the basic task as: clustering
comments into topics, ranking to identify com-
ments that are key in the clusters, and evaluat-
ing the results through a human study. Both ap-
proaches focus on using LDA topic modelling to
cluster the data. Ma et al. (2012) explored two
topic models, one where topics are derived from
the original news article and a second, extended
version that allows new topics to be formed from
the comments. They found that the extended ver-
sion was judged superior in a user study. Khabiri
et al. (2011) contrasted LDA topic models with
k-means and found topic modelling superior. A
study by Llewellyn et al. (2014) contrasted topic
modelling, k-means, incremental one pass cluster-
ing and clustering on common unigrams and bi-

grams. They found that the topic modelling ap-
proach was superior. Aker et al. (2016) looked
at a graph based model that included information
from DBpedia, finding that this approach out per-
formed an un-optimised LDA model. They then
labelled the clusters using LDA clustering and ex-
tracted keywords.

Other work has been conducted in related do-
mains such as summarising blogs, microblogs and
e-mail.

2.1.2 Blog Summarisation
Comments are similar to blogs in that they are
generated by multiple individuals who exhibit a
vast array of writing styles. Mithum and Koseim
(2009) found that whereas news articles have a
generalisable structure that can be used to aid sum-
marisation, blogs are more variable. In particu-
lar they found that errors in blog summarisation
are much higher than in news text summarisation.
They determined that errors were often due to the
candidate summary sentences being off topic and
they suggest that blog summarisation needs to be
improved in terms of topic detection. When in-
vestigating the summarisation of blogs and com-
ments on blogs Balahur et al.(2009) found that it
is very common to change topics between the orig-
inal blog post and the comments, and from com-
ment to comment. The research of Mithum and
Koseim (2009) and Balahur et al. (2009) indicates
that topic identification is a key area on which to
concentrate efforts in the emerging field of com-
ment summarisation.

2.1.3 Microblog Summarisation
A significant amount of work has been conducted
in the area of Twitter summarisation. Many Twit-
ter summarisation techniques exploit that tweets
often include hashtags which serve as an indica-
tion of their topic. Duan et al.(2012) designed a
summarisation framework for Twitter by defining
topics and selecting tweets to represent those top-
ics. The topics are defined using hashtags and are
split when at high volume by specific time slices
and word frequency. Rosa et al. (2011) also use
hashtags to cluster tweets into topics, using them
as annotated classes for training data. They fo-
cus on supervised machine learning, specifically
SVM and K Nearest Neighbour, as they found the
results from unsupervised clustering (LDA and k-
means clustering) performed poorly when applied
to Twitter data. In a further Twitter summarisation

44



tool, TweetMotif, O’Connor et al. (2010) use lan-
guage modelling to create summaries. They form
topic clusters by identifying phrases that could de-
fine a topic, looking for those phrases in the corpus
and merging sets of topics that are similar. Re-
search on microblog summarisation indicates that
when summarising comments it is possible but dif-
ficult to use unsupervised clustering and several
rules have been suggested that can be followed to
produce the most suitable clusters for summarisa-
tion.

2.1.4 E-mail Summarisation
E-mail and comments are similar in several re-
spects: they both exhibit a thread-like structure,
containing multiple participant conversations that
occur along a variable time line, they may refer
back to previous parts of the conversation and ex-
hibit high variability in writing styles (Carenini et
al., 2007). Topic identification is challenging in e-
mail threads. Wan and Mckeown (2004) noted that
several different tasks were conducted in email
conversations: decision making, requests for ac-
tion, information seeking and social interaction.
Rambow et al. (2004) found that e-mail has an in-
herent structure and that this structure can be use
to extract e-mail specific features for summarisa-
tion. This suggests that comments may have an
inherent structure which can be used to assist in
summarisation.

3 Methods

3.1 Data

The work reported here is based on comments
from news articles taken from the online, UK ver-
sion of the Guardian newspaper. It is composed
of online comments that are created by readers
who have registered and posted under a user-name.
The site is moderated and comments can be re-
moved. We harvested the comments once the com-
ment section is closed and the data is no longer up-
dated. The comment system allows users to view
comments either in a temporal fashion, oldest or
newest first, or as threads. Users are then able to
add their own comments to the set by either post-
ing directly or by replying to another user, adding
their comments to any point in the thread. This de-
velops a conversational style of interaction where
users interact with each other and comment upon
the comments of others. The topics discussed can
therefore evolve from the topics of the original ar-

ticle.
In total we have gathered comments posted in

response to thirteen articles. Each week a journal-
ist from the Guardian summarises the comments
on one particular article and we have selected data
from these weekly summaries to provide a further
point of comparison. A typical example is our
comment set 5 where the initial article was titled
‘Cutting edge: the life of a former London gang
leader’, the journalist had divided the comments
into sets as follows:

• 40% criticised gang culture for creating a de-
sire for fame and respect

• 33% would like to hear more from victims of
gang violence

• 17% found Dagrou’s story depressing

• 10% believed he should be praised for turn-
ing his life around

An example of a comment that fit into the jour-
nalist based classification scheme is: “I’d love to
see an in-depth article about a person whose life
is made a complete misery by gangs. You know,
maybe a middle-aged lady who lives on her own
in a gang area, something like that.”

An example of a comment that does not fit into
the classification scheme: “So people who don’t
have to turn their lives around are ignored and
not supported. These are the people who are
sometimes homeless cause there is no help if you
haven’t been in prison or don’t have kids”.

In this work we refer to all of the comments on
a single article as a comment set. There is data that
has been annotated by humans (the gold standard
set) and data that has not. The gold standard data
set contained three comment sets. It was produced
by human(s) assigning all comments from a com-
ment set to topic groups. For one comment set two
humans assigned groups (Set 1) and for two com-
ment sets (Sets 2 and 3) a single human assigned
groups. No guidance was given as to the number
of topics required, but the annotators were asked
to make the topics as broad or as inclusive as they
could.

In the set where both humans assigned topics
the first annotator determined that there were 26
topics whereas the second annotator identified 45
topics. This difference in topic number was due
to a variation in numbers of clusters with a single

member. Once these were removed both annota-
tors had created 14 clusters. The human-human
F-Score was 0.607 including the single clusters
and 0.805 without. It was felt that agreement at
this level meant that double annotation was not re-
quired for the futher two sets. All annotated sets
have the clusters with single members removed.

A further 10 sets of comments were collected
which were not annotated. Table I shows the com-
position of these comment sets. We can see that
the number of comments varies and that number
of authors, threads, groups of siblings (comments
that reply to the same comment) and time seg-
ments tend to increase with size. The number of
words in a comment does not. The sets of com-
ments, with annotations where available, can be
found at (Llewellyn, 2016).

3.2 Data Manipulation

We have investigated methods for combining the
individual comments into larger ‘documents’ us-
ing metadata features. The data is combined ac-
cording to aspects extracted from the metadata;
these are as follows:

• STANDARD: Comments are not combined
in any way. This is a baseline result to which
the other results can be compared.

• AUTHOR: Comments are grouped together
if they have the same author. A common ap-
proach to increase the size of Twitter docu-
ments is to group tweets together that come
from a single author on the assumption that
authors stick to the same/similar topics. Here
the same approach is tried with comments.

• TIME: Comments are grouped together
within a ten minute segment. Comments may

be on the same topics if they are posted at the
same time (if the users are viewing comments
through the newest first method).

It is hypothesised that there may be topical consis-
tency within threads. The ‘threadness’ was identi-
fied in several ways:

• FULL THREAD: Comments were grouped
together to reflect the full thread from the
original root post and including all replies
to that post and all subsequent posts in the
thread.

• CHILDREN: A comment is grouped with all
direct replies to that comment.

• SIBLINGS: A comment is grouped with its
siblings, all other comments that reply to a
specific comment.

All of the groups of related comments are com-
bined together, according to the method, to form a
single document for each group.

3.2.1 Short Documents
Previous work indicates that removing short doc-
uments from the data sets prior to topic modelling
improves the quality of the topic models (Tang
et al., 2014). We found, in an experiment into
whether length of comments influenced the qual-
ity of clusters, that removing comments that con-
tain few than 50 terms increases the ability of a
topic model to classify documents that are longer
than 50 terms but it does not increase the ability
to classify all documents, especially shorter doc-
uments. If we deem it useful to have short com-
ments in the clusters for the ranking and extraction
phase of summarisation, then it is important that
these shorter documents are retained in the model

46



building stage, we therefore include them in our
experiments detailed here.

3.3 Topic Modelling

The clustering method used in this work is Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling (Blei
et al., 2003). It produces a generative model used
to determine the topics contained in a text docu-
ment. A topic is formed from words that often
co-occur, therefore the words that co-occur more
frequently across multiple documents most likely
belong to the same topic. It is also true that each
document may contain a variety of topics. LDA
provides a score for each document for each topic.
In this case we assign the document to the topic or
topics for which it has the highest score.

This approach was implemented using the Mal-
let tool-kit (McCallum, 2002). The Mallet tool
kit topic modelling implementation allows dirich-
let hyper-parameter re-estimation. This means that
although the hyper parameters are initially set it is
possible to allow them to be re-estimated to better
suit the data set being modelled. In these exper-
iments, after previous optimisation tests, we ini-
tially set the sum of alpha across all topics as 4,
beta as 0.08. We set the number of iterations at
1000, and we allow re-estimation of the dirichlet
hyper-parameters every 10 iterations.

In order to cluster the comment data into topics
an appropriate number of topics must be chosen.
In choosing the number of topics we aim to pick
a number which strikes a balance between produc-
ing a small number of broad topics or a large num-
ber of overly specific topics. We aim to echo a
human like decision as to when something is on-
or off-topic. Too few items in each topic is to
be avoided, as is having a small number of topics
(O’Connor et al., 2010).

In our data set, we choose the number of clus-
ters by two methods. When data has been anno-

Table 2: Combined Data, Annotated, F-score (re-
sults that beat the standard baseline are in bold)

1 2 3
Standard Baseline 0.59 0.36 0.33
Author 0.43 0.34 0.32
Children 0.70 0.41 0.48
Full Thread 0.63 0.38 0.37
Siblings 0.59 0.37 0.33
Time 0.38 0.31 0.24

tated by humans the number of topics identified by
humans was chosen as the cluster number. When
the data had not been annotated by humans the
cluster number was identified using an automatic
method of stability analysis. This method was pro-
posed by Greene, O’ Callaghan, and Cunningham
(2014), and it assumes that if there is a ‘natural’
number of topics within a data set, then this num-
ber of topics will give the most stable result each
time the data is re-clustered. Stability is calculated
using a ranked list of most predictive topic words.
Each time the data is modelled, the change in the
members and ordering of that list is used to cal-
culate a stability score. Green et. al (2014) used
the top twenty features to form their ranked list of
features. Here, as the length of the documents is
shorter, we use the top ten.

The sets of documents as described in the pre-
vious sections are then used to build topic mod-
els and the comments are assigned to topical clus-
ters using these models. Ten-fold cross-validation
is used. As topic modelling is a generative pro-
cess, the topics produced are not identical on each
new run as discussed in more detail in (Koltcov et
al., 2014). Therefore the process is repeated 100
times, so that an average score can be supplied.

3.4 Metrics

There are two main metrics that are exploited in
this work: Perplexity and micro-averaged F-score.
Perplexity is judged by building a model using
training data, and then testing with a held out set
to see how well the word counts of the test doc-
uments are represented by the word distributions
represented in the topics in the model (Wallach et
al., 2009). This score shows how perplexed the
model is by the new data. Perplexity has been
found to be consistent with other measures of clus-
ter quality such as point-wise mutual information
(Tang et al., 2014). PMI data is also available and
can be supplied if requested.

It is difficult to judge when a perplexity score is
‘good enough’ as perplexity will continue to de-
crease as the number of clusters increases. Topic
models that represent single comments are the
least perplexed. Therefore a section of the dataset
has been hand annotated and this is used to pro-
vide a micro-averaged F-score. This can be used
to gauge if the perplexity scores are equivalent to
human judgements. For more details on this met-
ric see Sokolova and Lapalme (2009).

Time 584 715 459 460 579 433 542 796 1090 965 776 720 716.05

Here we present scores in terms of micro-
averaged F-score (when a gold standard is avail-
able for comparison), and by perplexity. A higher
F-score indicates a more human like model and
a lower perplexity score indicates a less perplexed
model. Significance is tested using a Student’s two
tailed t-test and significant results are quoted when
p<0.01 (Field, 2013).

4 Results and Discussion

First we will discuss the results from the 3 anno-
tated data sets (1, 2 and 3). Using an F-score met-
ric we find that, for all three annotated sets that
grouping comments using the metadata features
author and time does not improve topic cluster-
ing. Grouping comments using thread based fea-
tures was more sucessful. We found that combin-
ing comments with their replies (the children) and
combining comments within the full thread sets
significantly beat the standard baseline (Table 2).

The results differ when judged by perplexity
(Table 3). We found for two of the comment sets
(2 and 3) the children data set gave models that
were significantly less perplexed than the standard
baseline but this was not the case for comment set
1. For comment set 1 no models beats the baseline
using the perplexity metric.

When we look at all of the data, judged using
a perplexity score (Table 3), we found that the
combined children data sets consistently created
models (for 10 out of the 13 sets) that are signifi-
cantly less perplexed than a standard baseline. For
one of the datasets the data combined with other
replies to the same message, the siblings set, beats
the baseline. For two of the sets no combination
method beats the baseline.

The automated results and human results as in-
dicated by perplexity and micro-averaged F-score
are not in complete agreement, but there are some
commonalities. Both sets of results indicate that
the group that combines responses with comments

(the children group) has the highest agreement
with the human model, and it consistently pro-
duces the least perplexed model.

5 Conclusions

It is worth noting that although we focus here on
newspaper comments, the need for summarisation
applies to any web-based chat forum and the find-
ings therefore have a wide applicability.

LDA topic modelling perfoms better with
longer documents. Here we have investigated
methods for combining newspaper comments into
longer documents in order to improve LDA clus-
tering and therefore provide a strong basis for sub-
sequent comment summarisation. We found that
combining comments using features derived from
the thread structure of the commenting system was
more successful than features from the comments
metadata. We found that using a combination of
a comment and its children provides ‘documents’
that produce models that can more accurately clas-
sify comments into topics than other document
combination methods. It is likely that the method
of grouping comments with their direct replies,
their children, is the most successful because com-
mentors interact with the other comments through
the thread system (rather than newest or oldest
first) and they add topically relevent information to
the threads. It also indicates that topics in threads
evolve, meaning that grouping the entire thread to-
gether into a single document works less well than
grouping the immediate decendants - the children.

We found that these results were generally con-
sistent, but not identical, across two metrics - per-
plexity and F-score. We therefore confirm that the
perplexity measure is a useful metric in this do-
main when annotated data is not available.
