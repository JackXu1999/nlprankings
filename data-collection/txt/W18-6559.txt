Abstract
E-health applications aim to support the
user in adopting healthy habits. An im-
portant feature is to provide insights into
the user’s lifestyle. To actively engage the
user in the insight mining process, we pro-
pose an ontology-based framework with
a Controlled Natural Language interface,
which enables the user to ask for specific
insights and to customize personal infor-
mation.

1 Introduction

E-health services based on wearable sensors, such
as smart watches, need methods to discover in-
sights from the sensor data. Insights describe
user-specific behavior patterns, or habits, that are
relevant for guiding the user towards a healthy
lifestyle. For example, an insight might reveal that
the user is especially sedentary at the weekend.

Blind discovery of significant insights is essen-
tially a search problem and requires a lot of data.
If the discovery of insights took place in dialogue
with the user, the search problem could be re-
stricted to areas that interest the user the most.
Also, the user could provide complementary in-
formation that cannot be inferred from the data.

In this paper, we propose a description logics-
based approach towards an interactive system for
the discovery of insights. Concretely, we describe
an ontological framework implemented on top of
a statistical insight miner (Härmä and Helaoui,
2016) that enables the natural language-based re-
trieval and customization of insights from wear-
able sensor data.

2 Proposed framework

Our framework consists of five layers, see Fig. 1.
Data is acquired in the data layer and further pro-
cessed in the information extraction layer. The in-
formation & knowledge integration layer abstracts

the extracted information into formal facts. The
resulting knowledge base can include user- and
situation-specific information as well as common
sense knowledge. The reasoning layer leverages
logic-based algorithms that reason with the avail-
able knowledge. The verbalization layer trans-
forms the facts into coherent and comprehensi-
ble natural language (NL) messages. Similar sys-
tems for data-to-text summarization have been
proposed in the literature (e.g. Portet et al., 2009).

We additionally introduce a Controlled Natural
Language (CNL). It is a formal language that can
be translated unambiguously into knowledge base
facts, but is also understandable by humans. By
adopting the CNL, the user can interact with the
system, i.e., add and query facts from the knowl-
edge base. Natural language or spoken text can be
fed into the system after translation into CNL.

3 Representing, summarizing and
verbalizing insights

The user’s lifestyle is described by an ontology
that contains the routines, habits, and targets of the



479

user. These concepts are leveraged to represent in-
sights as knowledge base facts.

Inspired by NaturalOWL (Galanis and Androut-
sopoulos, 2007), we include lexical annotations
in the ontology, which specify how ontology con-
cepts are to be translated into natural text. This
way, the ontology also acts as a lexicon. We
include the lexical categories (e.g., noun, deter-
miner, preposition, or verb) in the annotations to
facilitate the use of standard Natural Language
Generation (NLG) techniques, such as adapting
verb conjugations, adapting the verb tense, or ag-
gregating sentence parts.

To enable user interaction, we specify a CNL
based on the vocabulary defined in the ontology.
The CNL plays the role of a human and machine
understandable interface which allows to directly
map the user’s input to the formal concepts of the
ontology. This way, the user can add personal
information to the system, e.g., “On Monday at
work, I play tennis”. This statement will be for-
malized as a fact and added to the knowledge base.
The CNL also provides the basis for verbalizing
the system’s responses to the user’s queries, such
as “What are insights about Sunday afternoon?”
We use the Backus-Naur form to specify the CNL
as a context-free grammar.

To create an NL summary of a number
of insights, we implement the following NLG
steps (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2014): (1) Content
selection: We let the user ask for specific insights,
for example insights about their step count on Sun-
day. (2) Discourse planning: We group those in-
sights together that are semantically related. The
insights are first grouped by the measurement to
which they refer (e.g. step count) and then ordered
within each group from more general to more spe-
cific. For the grouping and ordering steps, we
leverage our semantic model (ontology) and apply
reasoning algorithms to determine which relation-
ships hold between which insights. (3) Lexicaliza-
tion: We follow a template-based approach using
the lexical annotations in the ontology. (4) Aggre-
gation: We verbalize each group of equally spe-
cific insights using an aggregation template. Fi-
nally, for (5) realization, we use the realization en-
gine SimpleNLG (Gatt and Reiter, 2009).

4 Implementation

We demonstrate the viability of our framework
by implementing one use case related to lifestyle

insight mining. The ontology is implemented
in OWL using the Protégé1 editor. We use
OWL API2 4.1.3 together with the reasoner Her-
miT3 1.3.8 to implement our system in Java.
To implement the verbalization functionality, we
build upon the library SimpleNLG4.

5 Example run

> What are insights about my sedentary time on
Sunday?
> On Sunday your sedentary time is lower than on
Tuesday, Friday, Wednesday or Thursday.
On Sunday in the afternoon your sedentary time
is lower than on Friday, Wednesday, Thursday or
Tuesday in the afternoon.
> What are insights about when I go running?
> Could not find any insights about this.
> On Sunday in the afternoon, I go running.
> What are insights about when I go running?
> On Sunday in the afternoon when you go run-
ning your sedentary time is lower than on Tuesday,
Friday, Thursday or Wednesday in the afternoon.
