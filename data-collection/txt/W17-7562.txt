Abstract

In this paper we report on a Systematic
Literature Review where we explored the
notion of semantics in Computer Science
(CSE) literature. Our goal was 1) to sur-
face how the idea of semantics has been
used and represented, and 2) to surface its
publication pattern in CSE. Our automated
search in 5 CSE repositories yielded 653
relevant papers, emerging from multiple
disciplines and geographies, spanning a
period from year 1967 to 2017. We short-
listed 50 representative samples to study.
This literature review was motivated by an
external Web Accessibility effort in which
we wanted to understand how to influ-
ence the various meanings that a variety
of human end-user could derive by varying
the computer rendering of a given content.
The results of the SLR indicate that 44%
of papers do have their own definition, al-
most all are formal in their presentation,
and 94% of them have a notion of seman-
tics that favors the computer as a proces-
sor. We observe the limited human ori-
ented focus on semantics in CSE, and sug-
gest such semantics focus as an area of po-
tential study.

1 Introduction

In the scenario of a human interacting with a com-
puter, meaning is getting produced and processed.
We are interested in impacting the notion of this
meaning that is getting created in the human.

Philosophers and Linguists have routinely used
the term ”Semantics” to represent the notion of
meaning. Now, this notion of semantics has
been carried over to Computer Sciences where it
has been applied in Natural Language Process-

ing, Programming Languages, Web, Software En-
gineering etc.

Motivated by impacting human meaning and
human sense-making, we are therefore transitively
interested in the notion of semantics. However,
even for a contained area like Computer Science
(CSE), this term has not been unambiguously de-
fined for similar and consistent use universally.
Many disciplines within CSE have all made use
of this notion of Semantics, but in their own way.

1.1 Goal of this Paper

The goal of this paper is to conduct a Systematic
Literature Review on the notion of semantics in
CSE. In particular we aim to study the use of this
term in the CSE, at least in such disciplines as Pro-
gramming Languages (PL), Software Engineering
(SE), Compilers, Web and NLP. The overall goal
being, 1) to surface how the term of semantics
has been used and represented in these said dis-
ciplines, and 2) to surface the publication pattern
on this topic.

1.2 Background, Context & Motivation

In human computer interaction, there is obviously
1) a human, 2) a computing system and 3) an en-
gagement or interaction between the two. The en-
gagement could either be passive (as in brows-
ing or viewing), or active, as in querying or se-
lecting something on the system. In such scenar-
ios, humans are said to be deriving meaning from
the representation presented by the computer. The
modality for representation can be text, image, au-
dio, video etc. More interactive representation(al
experiences) can be animation, video, user inter-
faces etc. In the case of interaction (as in inputting
or programming by the human), the computing
system is also processing data to derive meaning.
Apparently, both the human and the system can be
seen as two processing agents.513



The notion of meaning and semantics can,
therefore, be applied to either of the two agents.
Our interest, however, is on the human formulat-
ing meaning. From an information delivery point-
of-view, the idea of how meaning is extracted,
constructed or possessed by the human is studied
by Psychologists, Cognitive Scientists and Infor-
mation Processing researchers. On this side, top-
ics like Sense-making (Russell et al., 1993), User
Experience, Semantic Interaction (Endert et al.,
2012) etc. emerge.

As a compliment to the human sense making
experience, on the computing side, we may also
look at how something can be constructed to de-
liver a particular meaning. Web Accessibility re-
searchers, claim that currently web content is pri-
marily designed for a majority in mind (Prasad et
al., 2014). And that it may not suffice for the in-
dividualized needs of a minority of users (Prasad,
2017).

A color blind person, for example, may not ben-
efit in the same way as a non-body disabled user.
So, in this regard, on the computing system side
of the human computer interaction, does there ex-
ist a platform that would enable the creation and
simultaneous co-existence of multiple representa-
tions for the varying needs of a diverse human end
users? Is there sufficient motivation for a system
that can renarrate and simultaneously have mul-
tiple representations of some source text (Prasad,
2017)? That is, a system equally being able to
produce colorful content for the majority of users,
high contrast and appropriately rendered visuals
for the color blind, braille for the visually im-
paired, in vernacular for the non-English speakers,
in tables, diagrams and scientific explanations for
the learned etc. These questions form the back-
ground context and motivation for our study of se-
mantics in CSE.

1.3 Semantics as ”Meaning”

Online dictionary1 describes Semantics as ”the
meaning, or an interpretation of the meaning, of a
word, sign, sentence, etc.” From a linguistic point
of view, it relates Semantics to ”the study of mean-
ing”. Webster’s dictionary2 too shares a similar
explanation, and calls semantics as ”the study of
meanings”.

From a human computer interaction point view,

1http://www.dictionary.com/browse/semantics?s=t
2https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semantics

the study of semantics can be related to the study
of meaning for either the human or the computer.
We are keen to uncover how semantics research in
CSE has defined and explored this topic.

1.4 SLR - A Research Tool

As already stated, our larger goal is to understand
how best to represent either information or data on
the system so that it may create the right meaning
to the human. To that end we wanted to conduct
an exploratory Literature Review for such a social
applicable, human oriented web application space.

SLRs have been popularized as a Evidence
Based Software Engineering (EBSE) research tool
by Kitchenham et al. in a seminal paper (Kitchen-
ham et al., 2004) presented at ICSE 2004, which
is a prominent conference for Software Engineers.
In particular SLRs have been suggested as a sys-
tematic way of exploring a problem space and thus
have been suggested as valuable first step in a PhD
research effort (Kitchenham et al., 2004).

While SLRs have been popular in the fields
of medical sciences, their use in CSE has been
limited. However, we are now beginning to find
SLRs in various areas of CSE. SLRs are now be-
ing published in Information Systems (Okoli and
Schabram, 2010), Software Engineering (Kitchen-
ham et al., 2009), Programming Languages (Ma-
jor et al., 2012), Web (Doğan et al., 2014), Model
Driven Engineering (Santiago et al., 2012) etc.

2 Research Method

This SLR follows the guidelines given in (Keele
and others, 2007) and is also informed by DARE3

criteria for SLR.

2.1 Research Questions

The research questions put forth for the documents
surfaced by our search strategy (given in section
2.2) include:
RQ1: Was there a definition for semantics in the

paper?
RQ2: Was the notion of semantics general, or did

it have some sub categories? What where
they?

RQ3: Is the notion of semantics oriented towards
the human or the computer?

RQ4: What sort of precision did it have in its def-
initions?

3Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE):
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/about/DARE/514



RQ5: Which research domain did the paper repre-
sent within CSE?

RQ6: When was the research published?

2.2 Search Strategy

For the SLR we conducted an automated search,
which included five of the most commonly used
CSE bibliography repositories. See Table 1. Each
of the databases were searched, in the stated or-
der of priority, on the following aspects: 1) the
queried records must be CSE papers, 2) they must
have the word ”semantic” in their title, and 3) they
must have the term ”definition of semantics” in
their body of text. Table 1 lists the exact string
and the restrictions that were used for our auto-
mated search.

2.3 Paper Selection

Paper selection was based on a set of inclusion,
exclusion and quality criteria. The inclusion cri-
teria required the document to fulfill the search
string, be a peer reviewed primary study, and be
an accessible document on the web. Papers with
zero citations, papers that were essentially Patents,
papers that were on non-CSE topics (like biol-
ogy/genome) were excluded. Quality criteria
consisted of only selecting papers that were con-
sidered long publications (i.e. had to be more than
4 pages), had to be peer reviewed, and had to have
some citations.

2.3.1 Selection Process
Once a paper fulfilled our inclusion, exclusion and
quality criteria, it was entered into our initial cor-
pus for individual selection. The initial corpus
was maintained as Bibtex files in Microsoft Ex-
cel worksheet. We expected our initial corpus to
be quite large, we planned on manually shortlist-
ing it into a handlable size for evaluation. This
shortlisting process was done on Excel by two out-
side judges. Our aim was to reduce the initial cor-
pus into a more practical size of 50 representa-
tive samples. These set of shortlisted records were
then to be fed into a document manager to surface
the full length documents from the web. For PDF
management we used Qiqqa tool9, and for Bibtex
management, we used JabRef tool. This set of 50
shortlisted records, complete with their full body
content were then positioned on the Qiqqa tool for
data collection.

qiqqa.com/

The data that was used for filtering was Title,
Keywords, publication meta-data (like the pub-
lisher, journal name, issue details etc), and in some
cases Abstracts as well.

2.4 Data Extraction

The intent of this phase is to ensure that we col-
lect appropriate data from each earmarked paper
to answer our earlier stated SLR research ques-
tions. Here is the criteria that was used for each
questions:

RQ1: We used the document management
tools10 to search for various definitions found in
the papers. If there were any definitions on the
topic related to semantics then we took it as a YES
count. Else, it was counted as a NO.

RQ2: We searched the surfaced papers to un-
cover the various contexts11 in which the word se-
mantic was used. If there were any repeatedly used
sub-concepts of semantics then we recorded it. At
the end we expected to have a bag of semantics re-
lated concepts and ideas that would form the base
for where the CSE research was headed.

RQ3: One key differentiation we wanted to
make was to whom the semantics was being made
relevant to. Was it the human (as a processor of
rendered information), or was it the computer12

(as a processor of the input information)? We
scanned papers to see how the definitions of se-
mantics were oriented, and incremented the rele-
vant ”H” or ”C” count as appropriate.

RQ4: Through this question we wanted to see
if the papers presumed an earlier (elsewhere) de-
fined notion, or if they took the trouble to define
their own working definition. In some cases we
expected to also have some loosely defined ter-
minology. So, our measure was on the precision:
Was the definition formal (with logic and mathe-
matics)? Or, was it informal - as in just by English
text? Or (as in RQ1) was there no definition at all?
This was checked and recorded.

RQ5,6: For the last two questions we collected
meta data on the publications. Here we wanted to
see where the research was emerging from. We
wanted to understand which domains were active
in this research and the year of publication.

In addition to the above highlighted data, we

also collected such publication related meta data
as: Title, Keywords, Author names, Publication,
Year, and in some cases, even the Abstract. We
used Bibtex for the extraction of this information
from the online bibliographies.

Essentially, through this data collection, we
sought to surface how computer science research
viewed semantics with respect to their own work,
and to see how these ideas tallied with our idea of
influencing meaning in the minds of an end user.

3 Results

Our initial automated search extracted 790
records, of which 5 records were malformed and
irretrievable. In this initial corpus we were able
to identify 21 repeat records, 87 with no ”seman-
tics”, and 32 short papers. That is, overall 140
were eliminated from this initial corpus, resulting
in 653 retrievable pruned set of records.

In studying the initial corpus we found that
our collection was indeed quite diverse: For ex-
ample, the publication dates ranged from 1967
to 2017. The locations of publications at least
included USA, UK, Germany, Australia, South
Africa, Netherlands, Switzerland and Canada.
The covered disciplines included Theoretical CSE,
Knowledge Engineering, Formal Methods, Pro-
gramming Languages, Logic Programming, Se-
mantics, Web, Linguistics, Systems, Multimedia,
Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence etc.
Even Biology/genome related publications were
captured.

From this diverse sample set of 653 records,
as per our selection process, we then needed to
shortlist a smaller sample size of just 50 records.
We used two external judges to help us identify
50 representative samples from the original list of
653. While the choice was somewhat arbitrary, it
was still ensured that the reduced set too was suf-

ficiently diverse and indicative of the larger set of
653. Tables 2 and 3 provide a listing of these fi-
nalized studies.

The earmarked 50 records were converted into
a shortlisted bib file by use of the JabRef tool13.
The bib file was used by our document manager,
Qiqqa, to import the full content. The files were
imported from online document repositories given
by Table 1. Finally, for subsequent steps involving
data extraction, the same Qiqqa tool was then used
to manage the 50 uploaded PDFs.

Here is a brief summary of what was uncovered
through our data collection process:

3.1 RQ1: Definition

In the first RQ1 we wanted to understand how
many, if any, actually even bothered to define the
notion of semantics in their research. Our initial
presumption was that while the idea of semantics
and usage of the term was rampant, the definition
was most likely ambiguous and perhaps not suffi-
ciently formal.

The results of our SLR contradicted our as-
sumptions. The data informed us that while 56%
(that is, 28 out of 50) papers were indeed assum-
ing a pre-existing notion and definition of seman-
tics, there were also the other 44% that indeed con-
tained definitions. That is, 22 of the 50 samples
actually had expressed their notion of semantics.

Upon investigation we found that most of them
were either having special applications or were
defining niche terms related to semantics. For ex-
ample, S514 for these references. defined the no-
tion of ”meaningfulness”, S6 had Context Free
Grammar (CFG) related semantics, S16 had defi-

two parts.516

plied semantics to Aspect Oriented Programming
concepts etc. Again, the existence of such defini-
tions confirmed to us that work with semantics is
not as arbitrary as we had initially presumed.

3.2 RQ2: Subcategories

The intent here was to understand how generic was
the application of semantics. Our results suggest
that there are indeed many research works and dis-
ciplines that discuss semantics at a very high level,
but there are also those that sufficiently focused in
on the sub topics within semantics.

In our collection, the subtopics that were ex-
plored included: denotational semantic (S2), static
semantic (S3), logic semantics (S4), multilevel se-
mantics (S5), universal semantics (S8), graph se-
mantics (S9), game semantics (S46), quantum se-

mantic (S18), stationary semantic (S19), stable
class (S19), operational semantics (S23), action
semantics, stable model semantics (S24), trace se-
mantics (S37) etc. Other notion of semantics in-
clude: semantic correctness (S1), semantic relat-
edness (S27), semantic distance (S27), semantic
forgetting, semantic compatibility (S42,44), timed
semantics, semantic spaces, semantic models, se-
mantic similarity etc.

3.3 RQ3: Human Vs. Computer Semantics

Through this RQ3 we wanted to uncover a pre-
sumption that most of the notion of semantics in
CSE was computer oriented and not human ori-
ented. The SLR results confirmed this. We found
that 47 out of 50 papers were indeed meant for
computers as the processing agent. Only 3 out of
the 50 were designed for human as the processing517

agent.
Upon further investigation, these 3 were either

using a specialized concept of semantics or were
geared towards a social application. For example
S15 had to use human understandable terms like
Roof, Window, Gate, Shell, Wall etc to link the
graphics to urban planning. S13 used a cell com-
ponent ontology, and S46 focused on real world
physics on game word entities.

This exposed a potential bias for us. It appears
that in CSE, most of the ideas related to semantics
have indeed been largely designed for computers,
and not humans as the processing agent.

3.4 RQ4: Precision in Definition

In continuation of RQ1, we wanted to understand
the level of definition precision one could expect
out of these papers. For instance, if the papers

were formal in their content, then we could ex-
pect to see formal term definitions for semantics
as well.

Our results indicate that while 42 of the 50 were
papers had lot of logic and formalisms in them,
only 44% (or 22 papers) had definitions for (por-
tions of) semantics. 5 were informal in their def-
initions. And 3 assumed that semantics were de-
fined elsewhere. So, we could see the pattern that
most of the Logic Programming, Formal Methods
and Theoretical CSE works perhaps already had
a notion of semantics formally defined elsewhere
that they could leverage in these documents. And
that there very few documents discussing seman-
tics from scratch.

In the case of working with humans and their
sense-making of content, no such formal defini-
tions may exist. Therefore, such research would518

lished papers.

need a more formal definition of semantics – a hu-
man oriented semantics – in their publication.

3.5 RQ5: Computer Science Domains

Our goal in RQ5 was to understand which sub ar-
eas within Computer Science were actively dis-
cussing semantics. Our results indicate that se-
mantics was discussed in multiple sub-areas in-
cluding: NLP with 3 papers, Programming Lan-
guages with 13 papers, Workflows having 2,
Databases having 3, Games having 2, Web Ser-
vices having 5, Logic related papers having 11 and
theoretical being 8. Of course, these topics were
not mutually exclusive and did overlap. See Fig-
ure 2 for a distribution of topics.

The conclusion, therefore, is that notion of se-
mantics is not just restricted to one or two niche
areas – like Linguistics, or Programming Lan-
guages. There appear to be quite a few emerging
areas where semantics – and that too human se-
mantics – can be relevant. For example, mobile
web and social web applications has a lot of scope
for social and human related content.

3.6 RQ6: Publication History

In RQ6 we wanted to see how hot semantics re-
search has been in the past. We wanted to look at
the publication history to draw some context, and
from that extrapolate the future outlook for this
work.

When we look at the overall corpus of 653 pa-
pers, the publications on semantics started in 1967
and continued with just a few publications a year
till early 80s. See Figure 1. In the decade of 90s
there was a wave of publications for each year con-
tributing to about 10-20 publications each. While
2001-5 was relatively low (with just less than 10
publications a year), the year starting 2005 saw a
huge leap in publications: 2006-2011 saw 50-60
publications a year. Starting 2011 to date (2017)
we again see a decline in number of papers fo-
cused on this topic.

Figure 2: Sub-areas of CSE which published the
50 shortlisted papers.

It appears that semantics had its hayday in the
second half of 2005. From 2007 to 20011, that is
in the last decade, we could see over 222 publi-
cations in this space. However, this number has
reduced considerably. In the past five years we
could only see 45 publications in this space.

One may interpret this reduction trend to mean
that interest in semantics is now waning. However,
we take a different stand. We suggest that what is
reducing is not interest in semantics, but rather re-
duction in publications with ”definitions of seman-
tics” in them. This could mean two things for us:
1) There is considerable computer oriented, formal
definition of semantics already out there that could
be leveraged, and 2) there is an excellent opportu-
nity ahead to further define more human oriented
semantics for upcoming mobile and web applica-
tions.

3.7 Threats to Validity

We recognize that our study sample is (n=)50 and
only represents 8% of our excavated corpus of
(n=)653. This sample size does indeed effect our
results. In addition, we realize that we only fo-
cused on papers that used the word ”semantic” in
their title, or on those that had ”definition of se-
mantics” in their body. This also reduces our input
corpus.

Broadening our search to also include papers on
other related terms could enrich our corpus and
through that better inform similar research. But,
such resources would come at a cost: They would
potentially require more resources in time, effort
and reporting. While they may provide more de-519



tails, but it may only be marginally different infor-
mation to the pattern of findings a smaller study
could feasibly uncover.

4 Discussion & Insights

From our study we gather that semantics is not
merely a study of meaning, but it is study of mean-
ing for humans as well as computers (RQ3), both
in natural language as well as in technical lan-
guages, both in context (as in usage by a hu-
man context) or in context-independent manner
(as with lexical analysis in linguistics).

In a computing situation, it appears that there
are both 1) theoretical studies that explore the for-
malism (RQ4), the logic – as in (S18-20,24,32,36
– and 2) application studies, that apply it to web
(as in Semantic Web), or to Web Services (S13,
25-26,44), or to Work Flows (S29,49). The theo-
retical studies tend to be formal and use significant
logic (RQ4). Apparently they have contributed to
design and development of robust programming
languages (S2-3,6,16-17, 21-23,34, 37-38,42) and
compilers (S9-11).

In the context of Programming Languages,
there is Denotational (S2,12,23,33-35,43), Op-
erational (S23,38,43) and Axiomatic Semantics.
Also, the Denotational work was supported with
Action Semantics (RQ2).

We also saw that there was application of game
theory principles to semantics (S12,46), and, on
the other side, application of semantics to graphs
(S), images (S30), urban planning (S15), genome
studies, databases (S47-48), ontologies (S13), se-
mantic web (S14), web services (S13,25-6,49),
Hypertext (S41) etc. Semantics seems to have
been used to study similarity (S42-44), distance
(S27), tuples, stability. It was applied to systems
(S5) as well as for forgetting (S39).

We realize that while the generic term is some-
what ambiguous, in CSE, the term is mostly re-
lated to the computer as an processing agent
model. Only when it comes to social (as in, bio-
logical or urban studies) or web applications level
(for example with Ontologies) we found a human
interpretation to this term.

From a logic and formalism point of view, se-
mantics has been receiving lot of research atten-
tion. However, going forward, there seems to be
scope to interpret semantics from the point of view
of a human processor. Cognitive Linguistics, Psy-
chology, Information Processing might be able to

address the emerging need to make processing as
a tool to help the human manage and make sense
of the information rendered for her.

5 Conclusions

We undertook the SLR study to systematically ex-
plore the notion of semantics, as it is applied in
CSE. We presumed that the term Semantic was
ambiguously or variedly defined in different sub-
areas of CSE research. What we discovered in-
stead is that the notion of semantics is not ill de-
fined. But, however, it seems to be narrowly de-
fined. Working definitions and application spe-
cific definitions seem to exist (S5-6,16,18-19,22-
23,27,33-36,38-39,41-44,48-49). Moreover, we
found that, in the human computer interaction re-
lationship, most of the focus of the semantics is
geared towards the computer being able to process
the information(S34,50), to present the informa-
tion (S41), to access the information (S1,47).

Human semantics (influenced by a computing
system) has been, in our opinion, under empha-
sized (S13,15,46). We see this as an opportunity
to develop systems, content and architectures to
focus on enhancing meaning for the human. No
doubt, semantic models and analysis is needed for
the back-end computing processor agent. How-
ever, such models and analysis should also ac-
count for and accommodate a better semantic or
easier sense-making ability for the human end user
as well. That exploration will be our future work.
