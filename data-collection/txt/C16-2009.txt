Abstract

... so I say to you ... search, and you will find ...

In this paper and the associated system demo, we present an advanced search system that al-
lows to perform a joint search over a (bilingual) valency lexicon and a correspondingly anno-
tated linked parallel corpus. This search tool has been developed on the basis of the Prague
Czech-English Dependency Treebank, but its ideas are applicable in principle to any bilin-
gual parallel corpus that is annotated for dependencies and valency (i.e., predicate-argument
structure), and where verbs are linked to appropriate entries in an associated valency lexi-
con. Our online search tool consolidates more search interfaces into one, providing expanded
structured search capability and a more efficient advanced way to search, allowing users to
search for verb pairs, verbal argument pairs, their surface realization as recorded in the lex-
icon, or for their surface form actually appearing in the linked parallel corpus. The search
system is currently under development, and is replacing our current search tool available at
http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/CzEngVallex, which could search the lexicon but
the queries cannot take advantage of the underlying corpus nor use the additional surface form
information from the lexicon(s). The system is available as open source.

1 Introduction

For linguistic research and for manual inspection of corpora, treebanks and lexicons, many different
search tools exist (PML Tree Query1 (Štěpánek and Pajas, 2010; Bejček et al., 2010), KonText (Klyueva
and Straňák, 2016),2 NoSketch Engine3 (Rychlý, 2007), Tgrep,4 BNC-search,5 LAPPS Grid,6, and many
others. Every electronic lexicon (monolingual or bilingual) also comes with a basic search, typically
allowing to search for headwords, or within any text using some form of fulltext search. Specifically both
valency lexicons developed at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, PDT-Vallex7 (Urešová,
2011b; Urešová, 2011a) and VALLEX8 (Lopatková et al., in print; Žabokrtský and Lopatková, 2007),
come with a search-allowing interface.9

However, we are not aware of any system that would allow structured search (a) in both a lexicon with
rich information and an annotated corpus at the same time, and (b) bilingually. This could be caused also
by the lack of parallel (bilingual or multilingual) corpora that are annotated by such rich lexicon entries

(usually, the corpora contain - in some cases - lemmas, which can be then searched for in independent
lexicons). Our task was to make the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT 2.0) (Hajič
et al., 2012) efficiently searchable, aiming to be a help for various applications of computational and
traditional linguistics as well as for NLP studies. The PCEDT is a bilingual corpus that contains both
rich dependency and predicate-argument annotation itself, as well as links to valency lexicons used (not
only) for predicate-argument annotation consistency. In this respect, it is similar to the PropBank (Palmer
et al., 2005), which annotates predicate-argument structure on top of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1993), indexing also by pointing to the frame files, from which additional information about the
predicates (verbs) can be extracted. However, PropBank is a monolingual resource. Also, because
English is not a very morphologically rich language, PropBank’s frame files do not contain much more
than a list of arguments and sense distinctions; in contrast, Czech language is quite rich in this respect,
and consequently, the Czech valency lexicon entries (Urešová, 2011b) contain additional information on
the required form of verb arguments in terms of case, prepositions to be used, etc. Fig. 1 shows a simple
example of a valency entry for the Czech verb kalkulovat, which has two senses: a compute sth sense,
and a more abstract sense on counting on something, on somebody (to happen). In the first sense, it adds
an optional third argument to compute ... from something, and both senses also differ in the possible
surface form - the second, more abstract sense requires a particular preposition and case (specified by
s+7, lit. with, and 7 for instrumental case), while the deep object of the former sense is a simple direct
(prepositionless) accusative (specified by 4, as cases are typically numbered in Czech).

Figure 1: Czech Valency lexicon (PDT-Vallex) entry (two senses of “kalkukovat”: lit. “compute” and
“count on sth/sb”)

In addition, not only the Czech and English treebanks are aligned in the PCEDT, but so are the associ-
ated valency lexicons for Czech - PDT-Vallex10 (Urešová, 2011b) and English - EngVallex11 (Cinková,
2006), forming a bilingual parallel CzEngVallex lexicon (Urešová et al., 2016) which explicitly aligns
verb senses as well as verb arguments between the two languages.

What was missing after having explicit alignments annotated was a tool that would allow inspection
of the resulting corpus and lexicons, allowing cross-lingual queries with reasonable flexibility to support
linguistic studies, NLP tasks, manual check of results of automatic tools, etc.

In our previous work (Fučíková et al., 2015), we have developed a tool that can search the lexicon(s)
in a cross-lingual manner, allowing to formulate queries such as show me all pairs of verbs and their
translations where the English verb is a phrasal verb, while the Czech one is not. Fig. 2 shows the old
interface (taken from (Fučíková et al., 2015)), and the result of such a query.

The tool did not allow the user to formulate the query over the associated parallel corpus, but it was
at least showing the associated examples with the bilingual lexicon entries found. While useful as such,
there was a demand both from linguists and from computer researchers to allow for more detailed queries:
specifically, to be able to use the surface form constraints in the lexicon, and also constraints on the actual
use in the associated parallel corpus.12 For example, there was no way to specify exactly which particular
phrasal verb the user wants to find (cf. Fig. 2). The new tool presented here answers to such demands

11http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/EngVallex
12This has been in part due to the fact that the English valency lexicon unlike the Czech lexicon does not often contain any

information about the required form, such as required or typical prepositions, and thus the corpus is the only place where such
information is available.

by implementing the possibility to search for the surface form constraints in the lexicon as well as in the
corpus, in a bilingual setting.

2 System overview

Fig. 3 depicts the new search interface. We demonstrate the new system capabilities on the displayed
example.

The query interface is on the right-hand side, the results appear left to it. In this case, the user searched
for all Czech verbs—paired with the English verb to cater (to)—which express the corresponding argu-
ment (a deep object) by a prepositional phrase using the Czech preposition o (lit. about) with accusative,
or by a subordinate clause introduced by the conjunction aby (lit. so that). There was only one result
(starat se, lit. to take care) in Czech. One example from the PCEDT is also shown (which fully corre-
sponds to the requirement that the English verb occurrence in the corpus has to be complemented by a
prepositional phrase with to).

Let’s have a closer look at the query: the checkboxes (lemmas, functors, arg. form, corpus arg. form)
are all checked, bringing up the corresponding search fields to be filled. There is always a pair of these
fields - Czech on the left, English on the right.13 Apart from lemma, there are three search fields for each
language: selector for the argument label (“functor”), lexicon argument form specification, and field for
specifying the required corpus argument form. In Fig. 3, the user selected PAT as the argument label on
the Czech side, limiting the search results to “deep objects” (label: PAT) of the Czech verb while leaving
the field on the English side empty (any label - actor, deep object, addressee, ... could be paired with
the Czech PAT on the English side). In addition, the (surface) argument form of the Czech PAT has been
restricted to an accusative prepositional phrase headed by o (lit. about) which is expressed by o+4. As
an alternative for this arg. form, the user allowed for this argument to be a subordinate clause headed by
the conjunction aby, (lit. to), expressed as aby.14 On the English side, the user has put the preposition
to on the second line of the two form fields, since it is to be found in the corpus, not in the English
valency lexicon.15 These expressions are a shorthand for fully expressing the exact dependencies of the
verb and its arguments; the relatively complex expansion of these fields and execution of a proper match
of the treebank data is performed by the search engine.

In general, it is possible to use also much more complicated queries, using the usual logical operators
(“and”, “or”) grouping and precedence, all combined with the possibility of using regular expressions on
the literals (strings, whether lemmas, forms, or tags).

At query time, the search engine does not use the treebank (PCEDT) and the bilingual lexicon (CzEng-
Vallex) directly, but they are pre-processed and indexed to make the search efficient. It also re-formats
the treebank annotation to a linear annotation within the text (as can be seen in the examples), to make it
more readable and avoid the need for additional visualization for the trees.16

Information about every pair of verbs is collected into a separate .php file (which also includes CSS-
based formatting). In addition, information about the form for each argument of each valency frame for
both PDT-Valex and EngVallex is extracted to another file for efficient search; similar index is created
for the parallel corpora. There is also one more set of .php files for the display of dictionary examples,
one file for each valency frame pair.

3 Conclusions and Future Development

We have described a search system over a bilingual lexicon and a parallel corpus. The tool builds on our
previous simple search system, but substantially extends it for the use of surface form both as recorded
in the lexicon as well as allowing to restrict the search to particular forms of argument expression in the
associated corpus.

In the future, we intend to add more search possibilities, such as the option to search for particular form
combinations in verb argument description, statistics (occurrence counts etc.) and their visualization.

The system is open, but at the moment its adaptation to other similar treebanks will require certain
amount of work, namely to converts and index such treebanks and lexicons to the form which the search
system uses at search time. This factorization allows, on the other hand to accommodate diverse corpora
to be used, without regard to original formats or exact annotation schemas.

The system is available from the LINDAT/CLARIN language resource repository17 as open source, as
is the current system and the associated lexicons and corpora. The search interface can be used openly
through any browser.

13The direction can be switched for convenience.
14Czech prepositions do not overlap with conjunctions, so their lexical forms can be used without ambiguity in the queries.
15Which typically do not have the required preposition marked.
16For those interested in the annotation itself, there are other tools, such as the PML-TQ search system, see above.
