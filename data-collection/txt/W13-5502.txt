1 Introduction

In this paper we describe the specification of a
model for the semantically interoperable represen-
tation of language resources for sentiment analysis.
The  model  integrates ‘lemon’,  an  RDF-based
model  for  the  specification  of  ontology-lexica
(Buitelaar et al. 2009), which is used increasingly
for  the  representation  of  language  resources  as
Linked Data, with 'Marl', an RDF-based model for
the representation of sentiment annotations (West-
erski et al., 2011; Sánchez-Rada et al., 2013).

In  the  EuroSentiment  project,  the  lemon/Marl
model will  be used to represent  lexical resources
for sentiment and emotion analysis such as Senti-
WordNet  (Baccianella  et  al.  2010) and  WordNet
Affect1 (Strapparava and Valitutti 2004), as well as
other language resources such as sentiment anno-
tated corpora, in a semantically interoperable way,
using Linked data principles. 

The  representation  of  WordNet  resources in
lemon depends on a straightforward conversion of
the WordNet data model, but importantly we intro-
duce the use of URIs to uniquely and formally de-
fine structure and content of this WordNet based
language resource. URIs are adopted from existing
Linked Data resources, thereby further enhancing
semantic  interoperability.  We  further  integrate  a
notion of domains into this representation in order
to enable domain-specific definition of polarity for
each lexical item. 

The lemon model allows for the representation
of all aspects of lexical information, including lexi-
cal  sense  (word  meaning)  and  polarity,  but  also
morphosyntactic  features  such  as  part-of-speech,
inflection, etc. This kind of information is not pro-
vided  by  WordNet  Affect  but  will  be  available
from  other  language  resources,  including  those
available  at  EuroSentiment  partners  that  can  be

easily integrated with the WordNet Affect informa-
tion using lemon. 

The  representation  of  sentiment  polarity  uses
concepts from Marl.

2 Motivation

Sentiment analysis is now an established field of
research and a growing industry (Po et al. 2008).
However, language resources for sentiment analy-
sis are being developed by individual companies or
research organisations and are normally not shared,
with the exception of a few publicly available re-
sources such as WordNet Affect  and SentiWord-
Net.  Domain-specific  resources  for  multiple  lan-
guages  are  potentially  valuable  but  not  shared,
sometimes  due  to  IP  and  licence considerations,
but  often because  of technical  reasons,  including
interoperability.

In  the  EuroSentiment  project  we  envision  in-
stead a pool of semantically interoperable language
resources  for  sentiment  analysis,  including  do-
main-specific lexicons and annotated corpora. Sen-
timent analysis applications will be able to: access
domain-specific polarity scores for individual lexi-
cal  items  in  the  context  of  semantically  defined
sentiment lexicons and corpora, or access and inte-
grate complete language resources. Access may be
restricted according to commercial considerations,
with payment schedules in place,  or may be par-
tially free. A semantic service access layer will be
put in place for this purpose.

3 The lemon Model

The lexicon model for ontologies (lemon) builds
on previous work on standards for the representa-
tion of lexical resources, i.e., the Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF2) but extends the underlying for-
mal model and provides a native integration of lex-
ica with domain ontologies.  The lemon model is

described in detail in the lemon cookbook (McCrae
et  al.  2010).  Here  we provide  a  summary  of  its
most  prominent  features,  starting with  the lemon
core, which is organized around a core path as fol-
lows:
• Ontology Entity: URI of an ontology element to
which a Lexical Form points, providing a possible
linguistic realisation for that Ontology Entity
• Lexical  Sense:  functional  object  that  links  a
Lexical Entry to an Ontology Entity, providing a
sense-disambiguated interpretation of that Lexical
Entry
• Lexical  Entry:  morpho-syntactic  normalisation
of one or more Lexical Form
• Lexical  Form:  morpho-syntactic  variant  of  a
Lexical Entry, including inflection, declination and
syntactic variation
• Representation:  standard  written  or  phonetic
representation for a Lexical Form

In addition, lemon has a number of modules that
allow  for  further  modelling.  Currently  defined
modules  are:  linguistic  description,  phrase  struc-
ture, morphology, syntax and mapping, variation.
The  linguistic  description  module  is  concerned
with the use of ISOcat data categories for describ-
ing  lemon  elements.  Although  lemon  itself  is  a
meta-model and therefore agnostic as regards the
specific data category set used, we use a specific
set of data categories in particular instances of the
lemon  model,  such  as  LexInfo  (Cimiano  et  al.
2011).

The phrase structure module  is concerned with
the modelling of lexical  entries that  are syntacti-
cally  complex,  such as  phrases  and clauses.  The
module provides tokenisation and phrase structure
analysis  to  enable  representation  of  the  syntactic
structure of such lexical entries.

The morphology module  is  concerned with the
analysis and representation of inflectional and ag-
glutinative  morphology.  The  module  allows  the
specification of regular inflections of words by use
of Perl-like regular expressions, which greatly sim-
plifies the creation of lexical entries for highly syn-
thetic and inflectional languages.

The  syntax  and  mapping  module is  concerned
with a description of lexical ’predicates’ (subcate-
gorisation  frames  with  syntactic  arguments)  and
semantic predicates (properties with subject/object)
on  the  ontology  side  and  the  mapping  between
them. The module allows a mapping to be speci-
fied as a one-to-one correspondence.

The variation  module is  concerned with  a  de-
scription of the relationships between the elements
of  a  lemon  lexicon,  which  are  split  into  three
classes:  sense  relations,  lexical  variations,  form
variations. Sense relations require a semantic con-
text, such as translation. Lexical variations require
a  morphosyntactic  context,  such  as  plural.  Form
variations are all  other variations, such as homo-
graphs.

An interesting aspect  of lemon-based ontology
lexicalisation is the use of URIs for uniquely iden-
tifying all objects defined by the lemon model (lex-
icons, lexical entries, words, phrases, forms, vari-
ants, senses, references, etc.), which can be linked
and maintained in a flexible, modular and distrib-
uted way. The lemon model can therefore contrib-
ute  significantly  to  the  development  of  Lexical
Linked Data (McCrae et al. 2011, Nuzzolese et al.
2011,  McCrae  et  al.  2012),  which  in  turn  will
greatly  enhance  distributed  development,  ex-
change, maintenance and use of lexical resources
as well as of ontologies as they will be increasingly
tightly integrated with lexical knowledge.

In the context of the EuroSentiment project we
will exploit the lemon model exactly for this pur-
pose:  representing  language  resources  for  senti-
ment  analysis  in  a  Linked  Data  conform  way
(RDF-native form),  enabling leverage of  existing
Semantic Web technologies (SPARQL, OWL, RIF
etc.).

4 The Marl Sentiment Ontology    

Marl is an ontology for annotating sentiment ex-
pressions,  which  will  be  used  by  the  EuroSenti-
ment service layer to describe the output of senti-
ment analysis services as well as by the resource
layer to describe the sentiment properties of lexical
entries.  For  this  latter  purpose  in  particular,  the
Marl ontology is used in combination with lemon
as illustrated above.

The Marl ontology is a vocabulary designed for
annotation and description of  subjective opinions
expressed in text. The goals of the Marl ontology
are to:
• enable publishing raw data about opinions and
the sentiments expressed in them
• deliver schema that will allow to compare opin-
ions coming from different systems (polarity, top-
ics and features)

2



• interconnect  opinions by linking them to con-
textual  information expressed from other popular
ontologies or specialised domain ontologies.

The Marl ontology has been extended according
to the needs of the EuroSentiment project. In par-
ticular, the main extension has been its alignment
with the PROV-O Ontology (Lebo, 2013) in order
to  support  provenance  modelling.  The  PROV-O
ontology is part of the PROV Family (Groth, 2012;
Gil, 2012) that provides support for modelling and
interchange of provenance on the Web and Infor-
mation Systems.

Provenance is information about entities, activi-
ties and people involved in producing a piece of
data or thing, which can be used to form assess-
ment about its quality, reliability and trustworthi-
ness. The main concepts of PROV are entities, ac-
tivities and agents. Entities are physical or digital
assets, such as web pages, spell checkers or, in our
case, dictionaries or analysis services. Provenance
records describe the provenance of entities, and an
entity's provenance can refer to other entities. For
example,  a  dictionary  is  an  entity  whose  prove-
nance refers to other entities such as lexical entries.
Activities are how entities come into existence. For
example,  starting  from a  web  page,  a  sentiment
analysis activity creates an opinion entity describ-
ing the extracted opinions from that web page. Fi-
nally, agents are responsible for the activities and
can be a person, a piece of software, an organisa-
tion or other entities. The Marl ontology has been
aligned  with  the  PROV ontology  so  that  prove-
nance  of  language  resources  can  be  tracked  and
shared.

Sentiment Analysis is an Activity that analyses a
Source  text  according  to  an  algorithm  and  pro-
duces an opinion about the entities described in the
source  text.  The  main  features  of  the  extracted
opinion are the polarity (positive, neutral or nega-
tive), the polarity value or strength whose range is
defined between a min and max value, and the de-
scribed entity and feature of that opinion. Opinions
can also be aggregated opinions of a set of users.

For a better understanding of the ontology itself,
we present below the main classes and properties
that form the ontology:
• Opinion:  a  subclass  of  the  Provenance  Entity
that represents the results of a Sentiment Analysis
process. Among its classes we find:
• describesObject: property that points to the ob-
ject the opinion refers to.

• describesObjectPart:  optional  property,  used
whenever the opinion specifies the part of the ob-
ject it refers to, not only the general object.
• describesObjectFeature: aspect of the object or
part that the user is giving an opinion of.
• hasPolarity: polarity of the opinion itself, to be
chosen from the available Opinion individuals.
• polarityValue:  degree of the polarity.  In other
words, it represents how strong the opinion (inde-
pendently of the polarity) is.
• algorithmConfidence:  rating the analysis algo-
rithm has given to this particular result. Can be in-
terpreted as the accuracy or trustworthiness of the
information
• extractedFrom: original source text or resource
from which the opinion was extracted.
• opinionText: part of the source that was used in
the  sentiment  analysis.  That  is,  the  part  of  the
source that contained sentiment information.
• domain: context domain of the result. The same
source can be analysed in different domains, which
would lead to different results.
• AggregatedOpinion: when several opinions are
equivalent, we can opt to aggregate them into an
“AggregatedOpinion”,  which  in  addition  to  the
properties  we  already  covered,  it  presents  these
properties:
• opinionCount:  the  number  of  individual  opin-
ions this AggregatedOpinion represents.
• Polarity: base class to represent the polarity of
the opinion. In every opinion, we will use an in-
stance of this class. The base Marl ontology comes
with three instances: Positive, Negative, Neutral
• SentimentAnalysis: in Marl, the process of sen-
timent  analysis  is  also  represented  semantically,
which  allows us  to  understand  the  opinion  data,
trace it and keep several results by different algo-
rithms, linking all of them to the process that cre-
ated them. The main properties of each Sentiment-
Analysis class  are:  minPolarityValue:  lower limit
for polarity values in the opinions extracted via this
analysis  activity;  maxPolarityValue:  upper  limit
for polarity values in the opinions extracted via this
analysis activity.
• Algorithm: algorithm that was used in the anal-
ysis. Useful to group opinions by extraction algo-
rithm and compare them.
• source: site or source from which the opinion
was extracted.  There are two reasons behind this
property:  grouping by  opinion source  (e.g.  opin-

3



ions  from  IMDB)  and  treating  and  interpreting
opinions from the same source in the same manner.

An example application of the Marl ontology for
a sentiment  analysis service is shown  in the Ap-
pendix. It is split in two: a view of the representa-
tion of the analysis (Fig 1), and a representation of
the result (Fig 2).

5 Representation of WordNet Affect

In  this  section  we  describe  how language  re-
sources  based  on  the  Princeton  WordNet  model
(Miller 1995) such as WordNet Affect can be rep-
resented using lemon. 

WordNet Affect is an extension of the WordNet
database, including a subset of synsets suitable to
represent  affective  concepts.  Similarly  to  the  ex-
tension related to domain labels, one or more af-
fective labels (a-labels) are assigned to a number of
WordNet synsets. In particular, the affective con-
cepts representing emotional state are individuated
by synsets marked with the a-label ‘emotion’. The
emotional  categories  are  hierarchically  organized
in order to specialize synsets with a-label emotion
and to distinguish synsets according to emotional
valence. There are also other a-labels for concepts
representing moods,  situations eliciting emotions,
or emotional responses3.

Unique and independently established URIs for
WordNet synsets allow for a distributed represen-
tation that enable Semantic Web based linking be-
tween and integration of WordNet based as well as
other  language  resources.  We  illustrate  this  here
with an example from WordNet Affect, using Eng-
lish based WordNet 3.0 URIs as defined by the Eu-
ropeana project.

Consider the following example for the English
noun ‘fear’ in WordNet and equivalent Italian syn-
onyms  taken  from the  Italian  WordNet  (i.e.  this
holds for any English aligned Wordnet) in Word-
Net Affect:

Princeton WordNet:

n#05590260 12 n 03 fear 0 fearfulness 0 fright 0
017 @ 05560878 n 0000 !  05595229 n 0101 =
00080744 a 0000 = 00084648 a 0000 ~ 05590744
n 0000 ~ 05590900 n 0000 ~ 05591021 n 0000 ~
05591212 n 0000 ~ 05591290 n 0000 ~ 05591377
n 0000 ~ 05591481 n 0000 ~ 05591591 n 0000 ~

3 A SKOS version of WordNet Affect is available from 
http://gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/wnaffect/ 

05591681 n 0000 ~ 05591792 n 0000 ~ 05592739
n 0000 ~ 05593389 n 0000 %p 10337259 n 0000 |
an  emotion  experienced  in  anticipation  of  some
specific pain or danger (usually accompanied by a
desire to flee or fight)

WordNet Affect:

n#05590260 fifa paura spavento terrore timore | 
"una emozione che si prova prima di qualche 
specifico dolore o pericolo"
n#05590260 affective-label="negative-fear"
n#05590260 domain-label="Psychological_Fea-
tures"

lemon transformation & integration:

Using lemon we can represent and integrate in-
formation on the Italian synonyms,  their  links to
the English based synset using Princeton WordNet
URIs,  and  sentiment  properties  using  Marl.  Do-
main  properties  will  be  based  on  WordNet  Do-
mains4. The example illustrates the positive polar-
ity of ‘fear’ in English (and ‘fifa, paura, spavento,
terrore’ in Italian) in the context of ‘horror movies’
and  negative  polarity  in  the  context  of  ‘children
movies’.

6 Representation  of  Lexical  and  Senti-
ment Features

The examples discussed in the previous section
showed the representation of WordNet based lan-
guage resources with lemon. However also many
other types of language resources exist, including
sentiment dictionaries maintained by the EuroSen-
timent use case partners that define domain words
with  their  polarity  scores  as  well  as  inflectional
variants, part-of-speech, etc. We can also represent
such  language  resources  using  lemon  combined
with Marl, thereby making them interoperable with
the lemon version of WordNet  Affect  as well  as
other lemon based language resources.

Consider the following example for the German
noun  ‘Einschlag’  (‘impact’)  with  lexical  features
(inflection, part-of-speech) and polarity score:

Einschlag    Einschlag NN negative -/-0.0048/- L
Einschlages Einschlag NN negative -/-0.0048/- L
Einschlags   Einschlag NN negative -/-0.0048/- L
Einschläge   Einschlag NN negative -/-0.0048/- L
Einschlägen Einschlag NN negative -/-0.0048/- L

Using lemon and Marl we can represent this and
integrate it with additional information as follows:

7 Ongoing and Future Work

Sentiment Analysis aims at determining the atti-
tude of the writer to some topic (positive, negative,
neutral).  Emotion  analysis  goes  one  step  further
and aims at determining the emotional or affective
state of the writer when writing. In EuroSentiment,
we have defined two vocabularies  for annotating
sentiment  and  emotion  expressions,  called  Marl
and Onyx, respectively.  In this paper we focused
on the representation of sentiment annotations with

Marl. The definition and representation of emotion
expressions  with  Onyx is ongoing work,  with the
objective of covering different  theoretical  models
of emotions (Sánchez-Rada et al., 2013). Onyx will
support the representation and use of several emo-
tion taxonomies such as WordNet Affect  or Emo-
tionML

Our ongoing and future work is concerned  also
with the definition and implementation of a work
flow that will enable the generation of domain-spe-
cific  semantically  interoperable  lexica  for  senti-
ment analysis. The work flow will use lemon and
Marl for the representation and integration of:

• WordNet Domains information on domain(s)
• domain entity information from DBpedia and/or

other relevant semantic resources
• WordNet Affect information on synsets  (using

Onyx)
• morphosyntactic  information  (part-of-speech,

inflection, …) from other language resources in
the EuroSentiment Language Resource Pool

• SentiWordNet  scores  and/or  automatically  ex-
tracted domain sentiment scores

Given  a  particular  sentiment  analysis  task  do-
main,  the approach is based on the analysis of a
representative text collection for the purpose of en-
tity  identification,  synset  disambiguation,  mor-
phosyntactic analysis, and domain-specific polarity
value extraction.

8 Conclusions

We presented a model for the specification, inte-
gration  and  use  of  language  resources  for  senti-
ment analysis based on Linked Data principles. 

The  presented  model  is  based  directly  on  the
lemon and Marl ontologies for the representation
of Linked Data based lexical resources and senti-
ment  expressions respectively.  This  work is  now
being extended so that emotion analysis is also ad-
dressed. 

In the context of the EuroSentiment project the
combined model will be used for the integrated and
semantically interoperable representation of senti-
ment dictionaries and annotations. As a result, Eu-
roSentiment will make available lexical resources
based on this interoperable representation with the
aim of fostering the development of services using
sentiment analysis.
