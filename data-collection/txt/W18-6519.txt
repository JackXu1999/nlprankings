Abstract

We extend the classic Referring Expres-
sions Generation task by considering zero
pronouns in “pro-drop” languages such as
Chinese, modelling their use by means of
the Bayesian Rational Speech Acts model
(Frank and Goodman, 2012). By assuming
that highly salient referents are most likely
to be referred to by zero pronouns (i.e.,
pro-drop is more likely for salient refer-
ents than the less salient ones), the model
offers an attractive explanation of a phe-
nomenon not previously addressed proba-
bilistically.

1 Introduction

Languages such as Chinese and Japanese make
liberal use of zero pronouns (ZP) (Huang, 1984).
The analysis of Wang et al. (2018) on a large
Chinese-English parallel dialogue corpus shows
that 26% of the English pronouns are dropped in
Chinese. Such an abundant use of zero pronouns
has been a key factor in linguist’s idea (Huang,
1984, 1989) that Chinese is a “cool” language or a
discourse-oriented language (Cao, 1979), i.e., one
that relies heavily on context.

To exemplify zero pronouns in Chinese, con-
sider the question “你今天看见比尔了吗?” (Did
you see Bill today?). A Chinese speaker can re-
spond in a variety of shorter expressions which are
equivalent to “我看见他了” (Yes, I saw him), for
example, “∅看见他了” (Yes, ∅ saw him), “我看
见∅了” (Yes, I saw ∅), or even “∅看见∅了” (Yes, ∅
saw ∅). Here the ∅ symbol indicates the place from
where a pronoun appears to have been “dropped”
from a full sentence.

Generating zero pronouns (only) where they
are appropriate is a difficult challenge for Refer-
ring Expression Generation (REG) (Van Deemter,

2016), and more specifically for the task of choos-
ing referential form, a key step in the classic Natu-
ral Language Generation (NLG) architecture (Re-
iter and Dale, 2000). Traditionally, choosing ref-
erential form is framed as modelling speakers’ be-
haviour of deciding whether entities are referred to
using a pronoun, a proper name, or a description.
However, for “cool” languages, an extra option,
namely of choosing a zero pronoun, needs to be
added (Yeh and Mellish, 1997) for fully simulat-
ing speakers’ behaviour.

In this paper, we model the use of zero pro-
nouns in Chinese with the Rational Speech Acts
(RSA) model (Frank and Goodman, 2012) by as-
suming that speakers tend to choose a ZP if it is
salient enough for successful communication (see
§2). For computing discourse salience, we focus
on ZPs that are recoverable, meaning that they ei-
ther refer anaphorically to an entity mentioned ear-
lier in the text (i.e., anaphoric ZPs, or AZPs for
short), or to the speaker or hearer (i.e., deictic non-
anaphoric ZPs or DNZPs for short) (Zhao and Ng,
2007); a ZP is unrecoverable if it cannot be linked
to any referent, for example:

(1) ∅
∅
有
has
二十三

23
项

CLASSFIER
高新技术
high-tech

项目
projects

进区
in.the.zone

开发
under.development

‘there are 23 high-tech projects under de-
velopment in the zone’

in which the ∅ cannot be recovered.

2 Related Work

Pro-drop raises challenges for a number of NLP
tasks including, machine translation (MT), co-
reference resolution, and REG. When translating
from a pro-drop language, recovering the dropped
pronouns of the source language can improve the
overall performance of MT (Wang et al., 2016,



160

2018). Co-reference resolution of ZPs has been
widely explored with a variety of techniques in-
cluding the centring theory (Rao et al., 2015),
statistical machine learning (Zhao and Ng, 2007;
Chen and Ng, 2014, 2015), deep learning (Chen
and Ng, 2016; Yin et al., 2016, 2017) and re-
inforcement learning (Yin et al., 2018). REG
of ZPs for “cool” languages has been addressed
through rule-based methods (Yeh and Mellish,
1997) including centring theory (Yamura-Takei
et al., 2001) (for Japanese), but we are not aware
of any testable computational account.1 We offer
such an account, along probabilistic lines.

Some discourse theories suggest that speakers
choose referring expressions (REs) by consider-
ing discourse salience (Givón, 1983), i.e., speakers
tend to choose pronouns if they believe the refer-
ent is highly salient. The intuition behind is that
a highly salient referent tends to be highly promi-
nent in the mind of the speaker and/or hearer. Orita
et al. (2015) shared a similar view and argued
that highly salient REs are highly predictable, so
they are referred with pronouns (as opposed to full
NPs) more often than the less salient ones.

A theory that is sometimes used for explaining
the relation between discourse salience and hu-
man choice of referential forms is Uniform Infor-
mation Density (UID) (Jaeger and Levy, 2007).
UID asserts that speaker tends to optimise infor-
mation density (quantity of information) of the ut-
terances to achieve optimal communication. In
other words, speakers tend to drop a RE when the
referent of the RE is predictable (or recoverable),
and vise versa.

Apart from salience, production cost (Rohde
et al., 2012) and the listener models (Bard et al.,
2004), meaning the models that how speakers
model listeners’ interpretation of the utterance,
also have impact on language production. It sug-
gests to us that the salience of the referent may not
be enough for modelling speakers’ choice. The
RSA model (see §3) used in this paper is possible
to take all these factors into consideration.

3 Methodology

3.1 The Rational Speech Acts Model

The Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model (Frank
and Goodman, 2012) has been used for a variety

1E.g., Yeh and Mellish (1997) did not offer a precise def-
inition of some of the syntactic constraints and the notion of
salience that they were using.

of tasks including modelling speakers’ referential
choice between pronouns and proper names (Orita
et al., 2015), the selection of attributes for refer-
ring expressions (Monroe and Potts, 2015), and
the generation of colour references (Monroe et al.,
2017, 2018). The key idea of RSA is to model
human communication by assuming that a ratio-
nal listener PL uses Bayesian inference to recover
a speaker’s intended referent rs for word w under
context C. In this way, RSA claims to offer not
only accurate models, but highly explanatory ones
as well. Formally, PL is defined as

PL(rs|w,C) =
PS(w|rs, C)P (rs)∑
r′∈C PS(w|r′, C)P (r′)

, (1)

where r′ denotes a referent in context C, P (rs)
represents the discourse salience of rs, PS is the
speaker model defined by an exponential utility
function:

PS(w|rs, C) = eα(I(w;rs,C)−C(w)). (2)

Here I(w; rs, C) is the informativeness of wordw,
C(w) represents the speech cost.

Orita et al. (2015) extended the RSA by assum-
ing that speakers estimate listener’s interpretation
of the (form of) RE w based on discourse informa-
tion. The speaker chooses w by maximising the
listener’s belief in the speaker’s intended referent
rs in relation to the speaker’s speech cost C(w),
where the cost is estimated according to the com-
plexity of the utterance, such as the length of w:

PS(w|rs) ∝ PL(rs|w) ·
1

C(w)

=
P (w|rs, C)P (rs)∑
r′ P (w|r′, C)P (r′)

· 1
C(w)

(3)

Here PL(rs|w) estimates the informativeness of
w, and P (w|rs, C) estimates the likelihood (ac-
cording to the speaker) that the listener guesses
that the speaker used w to refer to rs.

3.2 Modelling Pro-drop with the RSA Model
We model the decision of whether to use a ZP-
based on the formulation expressed in Eq. 3. The
speaker model is PS(z|rs), which is the probabil-
ity that the speaker uses ZP (i.e., drops the RE).
We assume that the speaker makes a binary choice
(i.e., z = {1, 0}), with z = 1 indicating a ZP and
z = 0 indicating a non-zero form of RE (NZRE).
Note that whether the speaker uses a pronoun or



161

a proper name is not in the scope of this model.
To simulate the speaker’s choice, we need to es-
timate the dropping probability P (z|rs), the dis-
course salience of the referent P (rs), and the cost
C(z).

According to the UID theory (see §2), if a RE is
recoverable, then the speaker prefers a ZP over a
NZRE to maximise the information density since
a ZP is shorter than any other referential form. In
that sense, we follow Orita et al. (2015) to esti-
mate the cost function C(z) based on the length
of the RE, i.e., the total number of words the RE
contains. However, the length of the NZRE is not
known in advance, thus we use the average length
of a set of REs W instead:

C(z = 0) = average length(W ) + 1 (4)

We experimented with two ways of calculating the
average length: (i) global average length, mean-
ing that W is the set of all referring expressions
in the corpus, and (ii) local average length, in
which W is the set of expressions that can re-
fer to referent rs. For instance, if rs is “Barack
Obama”, then given a corpus for computing lo-
cal average length in which he is referred to, W
might be the set {Barack Obama, Obama, he, for-
mer president}. The cost of a zero pronoun is al-
ways C(z = 1) = 1, which means no discount
on P (z = 1|w) and the plus 1 in Eq. 4 is to make
the cost of choosing NZRE different from choos-
ing ZP if W only contains pronouns (i.e., if length
equals to 1).

We assume that the dropping probability
P (z|rs) is dependent on whether the referent rs
is one of the participants in the dialogue (i.e.,
speaker or listener). For example, in the OntoNote
5.0 corpus, 30% of maximally salient entities are
dropped, which is much higher than the 10% drop-
ping rate of non-maximally salient entities. If rs is
one of the participants, we call it maximally salient
entity (denoted as s). Otherwise, rs is called non-
maximally salient entity (denoted as ns). This as-
sumption causes AZP and DNZP to have differ-
ent proportions in the predicted results. Suppose
P (z = 1|rs = ns) = a and P (z = 1|rs = s) = b,
then we have a < b, which implies that the speaker
thinks the listener expects a maximally salient en-
tity (i.e., speaker or listener).

Let α = ab be the dropping ratio, then the prob-
ability of dropping a noun phrase that refers to the

speaker is:

PS(ZP|Speaker) ∝ PL(Speaker|ZP) ·
1

C(z = 1)

=
P (ZP|Speaker)P (Speaker)∑

r′ P (ZP|r′)P (r′)
· 1
C(z = 1)

=
NSpeaker

α ·NNS +NS
· 1
C(z = 1)

(5)

P (Speaker) is the salience of the speaker.2 In gen-
eral, we take the salience of a referent x to be in
proportion to Nx, which is the number of times
that x has been referred to in the preceding dis-
course, hence the use of NSpeaker, NS, and NNS in
the equation. Note that NS +NNS is the total num-
ber of REs in the preceding discourse.

Equation 5 shows that modelling the dropping
probability for maximally salient entities and non-
maximally salient entities differently acts as a dis-
count for the number of referents that the ZP can
refer to when predicting DNZP. Similarly, using
the dropping ratio α, the dropping probability for
AZPs is estimated as:

PS(AZP|Speaker) =
NAZP

NNS +
1
αNS

(6)

which can be seen as adding a penalty.
The frequencies counted above are all based

on the whole preceding discourse of a referent,
which might not be reasonable for predicting ZPs.
We hypothesise that the informativeness of a ZP
depends on only a part of the preceding con-
text. We tested two possible set-ups. One is
setting a discourse window to limit the number
of sentences that the simulator can look back to.
The other uses recency (Chafe, 1994). Following
Orita et al. (2015), we replace each count with:
Count(ri, rj) = e

−d(ri,rj)/a, where rj is the same
referent as the ri that has previously been referred
to and d is the number of sentences between two
REs. Instead of taking the direct raw count 1,
Count(ri, rj) decays exponentially with respect
to how far it is from the predicting RE. The RE
that has larger distance contributes less to the over-
all count of that referent.

For NZREs (z = 0), we assume that the num-
ber of times that the referent has been referred to
is equal to the total number of referents referred to
by that NZRE. Thus, the speaker believes that the
listener can always resolve the reference by giving

(2006)’s use of “recoverability”.

them a NZRE. In other words, their informative-
ness equals 1.

4 Experiments

4.1 The Dataset

We tested our model on the Chinese portion of
OntoNotes Release 5.0 data3 (Hovy et al., 2006),
which has been widely used in (ZP) co-reference
resolution tasks. The corpus contains 1,729 docu-
ments, including 143620 referring expressions. In
Table 1, there is the basic statistics about the re-
coverable zero pronouns in OntoNotes corpus.

# of Recoverable Zero Pronouns 17,129
# of Anaphoric ZPs 14,675

# of Deictic Non-anaphoric ZPs 2,454

Table 1: Basic statistics of different types of re-
coverable ZPs in OntoNotes

Baseline. In this work, we used the modified rule
1 in Yeh and Mellish (1997), i.e., the RE in the
subject position will be a ZP if it was referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence, as the base-
line. The modification is inspired by the fact that
99.2% ZPs in OntoNotes corpus are in the subject
position.

4.2 Experiment Results

Table 2 shows the results (reported in accuracy)
of various models on the OntoNote dataset. The
dropping ratio α was empirically set to 0.1 and the
decay parameter a of recency was set to 0.8. The
window size was 1, so the simulator only looks at
the current sentence and preceding sentence.

As expected, the models that look back to the
whole preceding discourse perform badly on pre-
dicting ZPs (i.e., 8.35% of accuracy), especially
DNZPs. They tend to predict all REs as NZREs,
which even performs worse than the model using
simple rule (i.e., the baseline). In contrast, lim-
iting the discourse history by applying discourse
windows or replacing frequency with recency have
a negative impact on predicting NZREs, more
specifically pronouns. Such an impact is caused
by the idea that every NZRE can always be re-
solved by the listener, which is not correct for pro-
nouns. However, so far, we cannot calculate the
informativeness of pronouns properly since we do

3https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/
ldc2013t19

not know which referent (speaker or listener) a de-
ictic pronoun in the corpus refers to. For example,
in the corpus, both the speaker and listener will
use “I” to refer to themselves, so we don’t know
whether “I” refers to the speaker or the listener.
This setting will lead to over-estimation of the in-
formativeness of pronouns. On the other hand,
computing cost by average length (as we do) over-
estimates the costs of pronouns, whose lengths are
generally shorter than proper names.

The baseline model’s performance is not bad,
especially for predicting AZPs. This is partly be-
cause the rule predicts that all REs in object po-
sition are NZREs and this is nearly always cor-
rect. (Recall that 99.84% REs in object position
are NZREs). At the same time, if the referent
was referred to in the immediately preceding sen-
tence (as the baseline model requires), then it is
clearly more salient than if it wasn’t. The base-
line model is therefore quite similar to the model
with discourse window, but its decisions are made
in a simpler way (i.e., based on a simple ”if-then”
rule).

With respect to overall accuracy for predict-
ing ZPs and NZREs, models with recency per-
form similarly to those that use a discourse win-
dow. However, recency offers better prediction on
AZPs. Adding a dropping ratio could significantly
improve the performance on predicting DNZPs
without decreasing the accuracies of AZPs and
NZREs very much (i.e., accuracy increase from
62.02% to 95.35%). For the choice of cost func-
tion, we found that using global average length is
the best.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper has explored the possibilities of us-
ing the RSA model for probabilistic simulation of
speakers’ use of ZPs (i.e., pro-drop), and investi-
gated factors that influence speakers’ choice.

Our model performs respectably yet, as men-
tioned in Section 4, it under-estimates the proba-
bility of choosing a pronoun. Solving this problem
will require a more fine-grained annotation of the
corpus, indicating which person each occurrence
of the deictic pronouns ”I” and ”you” refers to.
Once this has been done, we also hope to let the
generator distinguish between ZP, pronoun, proper
name, and full noun phrase.

When speakers are choosing between pronouns
and full NPs, sentence position is known to be rel-

evant. For example, pronouns are less common
in object than in subject position Brennan (1995),
which somehow dues to the fact that REs in sub-
ject position are more salient than in object po-
sition. In the OntoNotes corpus, 99.2% of ZPs
appear in subject position; in Chinese, empty cat-
egories are acceptable in both subject and object
(including the topic position (Huang, 1984)), but
even there they are most frequent in subject posi-
tion. The baseline model introduced in this paper
has somehow proved that considering positions
works in modelling pro-drop. In future we shall
explore the way of combining that factor with the
RSA for pro-drop model introduced in this paper.

In future, we will investigate alternative ways to
estimate informativeness and costs. For example,
it would be natural to use a co-reference resolver
for calculating informativeness. Furthermore, one
could follow on from (Yamura-Takei et al., 2001;
Roh and Lee, 2003) by using elements of centring
theory (Grosz et al., 1995) in the definition of cost
(e.g., giving Rough Shifts a high cost). Alterna-
tively, one could improve the model by adopting a
trainable function for estimating both informative-
ness and costs.
