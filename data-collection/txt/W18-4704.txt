Abstract

Focusing on the revision of the movement link in the annotation scheme, tagged <moveLink>,
this paper presents a systematic way of converting the first official edition of ISO-Space to its
second edition with revisions required at the specification levels, both abstract and concrete. Even
after the loss of its status as an ISO standard, the first edition is still expected to be compatible
with the second edition at least at the level of semantics.

1 Introduction

The annotation scheme for static and dynamic spatial information, commonly called ISO-Space1, was
officially published as part of the first edition of ISO 24617-7:2014 (E) standard. Before the publication
of this standard, there were some preliminary working versions such as the ones proposed by Pustejovsky
et al. (2010) and Pustejovsky and Yocum (2013) that had treated event-paths as part of the basic entity
types for the spatial annotation scheme. Following these preliminary proposals, the first official edition
of ISO-Space (ISO, 2014b), henceforth to be referred to by ISO-Space (2014), also listed event-paths as
a basic entity type, but failed to implement them in constructing annotation structures overall.

As Lee (2016) pointed out, this failure made the annotation structures, specified in abstract set-
theoretic terms by the first edition of ISO-Space, non-isomorphic to the corresponding structures rep-
resented in a concrete markup format. This is a serious mismatch in an annotation scheme between its
so-called abstract syntax and each of its representation formats, called concrete syntaxes, based on the
abstract syntax.2 Pustejovsky and Lee (2017) and Lee (2018) continued to show that the annotation of
the movement link, tagged <moveLink>, mostly overlapped the task of semantic role annotation, spec-
ified in ISO (2014a). Furthermore, the movement link in the first edition failed to conform to the general
triplet link structure <⌘, E, ⇢>, first formulated by Bunt et al. (2016) and then specified as required by
another ISO standard 24617-6 Principles of semantic annotation (ISO, 2016). The conformance of the
movement link to this triplet structure is basically required to be made interoperable with other parts of
the ISO 24617 standard on semantic annotation frameworks such as ISO-TimeML (ISO, 2012), which
treats event-based temporal annotation.

Much work has already been done in applying ISO-Space (2014) as an ISO standard to the semantic
annotation of raw corpora or the construction of semantic systems. It is thus necessary to make the first
edition of ISO-Space compatible with its second edition so that earlier applications still remain valid and
can easily be updated according to the second edition if needs arise. This paper aims at showing how the
first official edition of ISO-Space (ISO, 2014b) can be made compatible with the revised edition, 3 by:

2According to Bunt (2010) and Bunt (2011), a semantic annotation scheme consists of an abstract syntax, a set of concrete

syntaxes, and a semantics. The abstract syntax defines well-formed annotation structures in set-theoretic terms, while a concrete
syntax based on it provides a format for representing annotation structures. The annotation structures defined by the abstract
syntax can be represented in different formats which are semantically equivalent, since the semantics specifies the interpretation
of the abstract annotation structures.

3Following Bunt et al. (2018), this paper focuses on the compatibility of the original version with a new version in order to
save various applications based on the original. The revisions in the new version are required for various independent reasons.
The compatibility of a revised version with its original is thus not considered as a necessity, but rather as something desirable.

relating old annotation structures into new ones in a systematic way (sections 4.2 and 4.3) and turning
the semantic interpretations of old annotations into those based on event-paths as in the new annotations
(section 4.4).

2 Specification of <moveLink> in ISO-Space (2014)

ISO-Space (2014) has no event-paths implemented in its concrete syntaxes. As a result, the movement
link, tagged <moveLink> in XML, carries many of the path-related features.4

(1) List A.12 Attributes for the <moveLink> tag
attributes = identifier, [trigger], [source], [goal], [midPoint], [mover],

[ground], [goalReached], [pathID], [motionSignalID], [comment];

identifier = mvl, decimal digit, decimal digit;

{*The identifier is tagged "xml:id" for XML documents,
otherwise "id". Examples are: mvl3, mvl20*}

trigger = IDREF; {*ID of a <motion> that triggered the link*}
source = IDREF; {*ID of a location/entity/event tag at the

beginning of the event-path *}
goal = IDREF; {*ID of a location/entity/event tag at the end of the event-path*}
midPoint = IDREFS;

{*ID(s) of event-path midpoint location/entity/event tags*}
mover = IDREF; {*ID of the location/entity/event tag whose location changes*}
ground = IDREF;

{*ID of a location/entity/event tag that the @mover participant’s motion
is relative to *}

goalReached = "yes" | "no" | "uncertain";

pathID = IDREF;

{*ID of a <path> tag that is identical to the event-path of the
@trigger <motion>*}

motionSignalID = IDREFS;

{*ID(s) of <motionSignal> tag(s) that contributes path or manner information
that the @trigger <motion> carries *}

comment = CDATA;

The following example shows how the 2014 specification of <moveLink> operates:

(2) a. Markables Tagged:
Johnse1 flewm1 toms1 Miyazakipl1 throughms2 Naritapl2 and Hanedapl3.

b. Annotated:
<moveLink xml:id="mvl1" trigger="#m1" goal="#pl1" midPoint="#pl2,#pl3"

mover="#se1" goalReached="yes" motionSignalID="#ms1,#ms2"/>

This specification fails to represent what entities are being related by <moveLink>.

3 Revised Specifications

3.1 Metamodel and Basic Assumptions

Figure 1 presents the metamodel or general structure of revised ISO-Space.
Here we focus on the movement link, tagged <moveLink>, only. It is triggered by a motion and then
relates a spatial entity to an event-path. This spatial entity is a mover or object which is triggered by a
motion to traverse its trajectory, called event-path. A case referred to by “An overcrowded bus plunged

4See ISO 24617-7:2014, List A.12.

36



Figure 1: Metamodel of Revised ISO-Space

off a mountain road into a gorge in northern India” is an example, where the bus is treated as a spatial
entity and a trajectory from the mountain road down to a gorge is an event-path.5

There are some basic assumptions according to which the movement link, <moveLink>, is reformu-
lated in revised ISO-Space:

(3) a. Axiom: Every motion-event triggers a trajectory or route, called event-path, that a mover tra-
verses: 8e[motion(e) ! 9{r, x}[eventPath(r) ^ triggers(e, r) ^ mover(x, e) ^ traverses(x, r)]]6

b. Definition: An event-path is a finite directed series of locations.

c. Implementation: An event-path is represented as a non-consuming tag, which is anchored to
an empty string of text segments, but uniquely identifiable.

In the revised edition of ISO-Space, the <moveLink> is treated as a path-delimiting relation that con-
veys information about a moving about, traversing a trajectory or event-path. As a genuine but directed
finite path, the event-path is understood to have a start and an end with denumerably many mid locations
between them. Locations may include points, intervals, paths or (two-dimensional) areas. For a case like
an event expressed by “A truck sped off Massachusetts Turnpike”, the truck’s speeding off is understood
to have started on Massachusetts Turnpike or some point on that highway (path). Hence, terms such as
begin point or endpoint are replaced by more general terms like start or end, respectively. These loca-
tions delimiting event-paths may not be explicitly mentioned, but they must exist, each being uniquely
defined.

3.2 Serialization in a Concrete Syntax
In an XML-based concrete syntax, the two elements <eventPath> and <moveLink> are imple-
mented each with a list of attribute-value specifications. These may be represented in extended BNF
(ISO/IEC, 1996), which is found expressively more powerful than DTD (data-type declaration), as fol-
lows:

(4) Attribute-Value Specification for <eventPath>
attributes = identifier, target, trigger, start, mids, end,

5ISO-Space includes among spatial entities those objects that are not genuinely spatial, but are involved in a spatial relation
or in a motion.

6Rather than the variable p, which is reserved for propositions, the variable r is chosen to represents event-paths, which may
also be called routes.

37



[spatialRelator], [comment];

{*The attributes in brackets [ ] are opitonal; others are required.*}
identifier = ep, positive integer;

target = EMPTY;

trigger = IDREF; {*ID of a motion*}
start = IDREF | EMPTY;

{*ID of a location or EMPTY. A location may include a path or area.*}
mids = IDREFS | IDREF | EMPTY; {*IDs of locations, ID of a path, or EMPTY*}
end = IDREF | EMPTY; {*ID of a location or EMPTY*}
spatialRelator = IDREFS; {*IDs of <spatialRelation>s that delimit an event-path
with its @start, @end or @mids*}

comment = CDATA;

Each instance of a motion-event triggers an event-path and each event-path is uniquely associated with
a motion-event. Such a motion-event is represented by the attribute @trigger with a specific value
referring to that motion-event associated with an event-path. As a finite path, every event-path has two
ends: one is identified as its start and the other one as its end, because it is directed. Hence, the attributes
@start, @mids, and @end are required attributes. Their values are unspecified if these locations are
not explicitly mentioned.7

(5) Attribute-Value Specification for <moveLink>
attributes = identifier, figure, ground, relType, [goalReached], [comment];

{*The attributes in brackets [ ] are optional; others are required.*}
identifier = mvL, positive integer;

figure = IDREF; {*ID of a moving object*}
ground = IDREF; {*ID of an event-path*}
relType = CDATA | "traverses";

{*CDATA allows other more specific values such as the motion-event involved
than the general value "traverses".*}

goalReached = "yes"|"no";

{*If @goalReached is uncertain, then it is unspecified.*}
comment = CDATA;

This specification conforms to the general triplet structure <⌘, E, ⇢>, where ⌘ is represented by the value
of the attribute @figure, E by the value of @ground, and ⇢ by that of @relType. Optional attributes
such as @goalReached or @comment are freely allowed without violating the triplet structure of
links.

Here is an example:

(6) a. Text: John flew to Miyazaki through Narita and Haneda.

b. Markables Tagged:
Johnx1 flewm1 ;ep1 pred="fly" tosr1 Miyazakipl1 throughsr2 Naritapl2 and Hanedapl3.

c. Annotated:

<motion xml:id="m1" target="flew" pred="fly" tense="past" goal="#pl1"/>

<eventPath xml:id="ep1" target="" trigger="#m1" start=""

end="#pl1" mids="#pl2,#pl3" spatialRelator="#sr1,#sr2"/>

<moveLink xml:id="mvL1" figure="#x1" ground="#ep1" relType="fly through"

goalReached="yes"/>

7Spatial relators such as from, to, and through just define the start, end, and mids of an event-path, without carrying any
semantic content. Once the delimiting bounds of an event-path are marked up, the function of spatial relators is discharged.

38



As shown in (c), the annotation of an event-path, tagged <eventPath>, is treated as a complex entity
structure referring to other entity structures just like link structures.8

3.3 Outline of Semantics

The semantics of revised ISO-Space is formulated on the basis of its abstract syntax, but its interpretation
rules apply to the semantic interpretations of annotation structures as represented by a concrete syntax.
Here is an example for the annotation structures represented in (4c). Each of the annotation structures
is interpreted as a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS), as defined in Kamp and Reyle (1993)’s
Discourse Representation Theory, through the interpretation function �, as shown below:9

(7) DRSs:
Entity: �(Johnx1) := [named(x, john), person(x)]

Motion: �(flewm1) := [fly(m1), past(m1), goal(�pl1, m1)]

Locations: �(Miyazakipl1) := [named(l1, Miyazaki), airport(l1)],

�(Naritapl2) := [named(l2, Narita), airport(l2)],

�(Hanedapl3) := [named(l3, Haneda), airport(l3)]

Event-path: �(;ep1) := [eventPath(r), triggers(m1, r), endsAt(r, l1), mids(r, <l2, l3>)]
Link: �(mvL1) := [fly through(x1, r), goalReached]

The entity structures of the entity types entity, motion, location, and event-path represented in (4c) are
each interpreted by � as a DRS. The link structure corresponding to <moveLink> is interpreted as a
DRS by combining the interpretations of those entity structures. All of the unbound variables are to be
interpreted existentially and the commas interpreted as conjunctions. For the movement link, all these
DRSs can be compositionally combined.

First, on the basis of neo-Davidsonian event semantics10, which treats predicates as each applying
to an event as an individual entity and with a list of participants in that event, we have the following
interpretation of traverses(x1, p):

(8) Definition 1: 8{x, r}[traverses(x, r) ! 9{m, x}[moves(m), mover(x, m), pathOf(r, m)]

Second, goalReached is treated as a truth-value carrying proposition. Its interpretation requires a
decomposition to predicates involving spatio-temporal properties:

(9) Definition 2:
[goalReached ! 9{m, x, l, t}[moves(m), mover(x, m), location(l), goal(l, m), time(t), terminatesAt(m, t),
locatedAt(x, <l, t>)]]

This is interpreted as saying that the motion of moving terminated at the time t and at that time t the
mover x was at the location l.11

goalReached may also be defined in terms of an event-path, as shown below:

(10) Definition 3:
[goalReached ! 9{m, l, r}[moves(m), goal(l, m), eventPath(r), triggers(m, r), endsAt(r, l), goal(l, m)]]

This means that if a goal is reached, then there is a motion-event with a goal that triggers an event-path
such that the goal matches the end of the event-path.

The attribute @goalReached is optional with its possible values, either "true" or "false".
Consider:

(11) a. Leex1 climbedm1 ;ep1 up tosr1 [the peak of Mt. Halla]pl1, but Kimx2 couldn’t ;m2 ;ep2.
8An annotation structure consists of entity structures and link structures. An entity structure is a pair <m, s>, where m is a

markable and s, semantic information, while a link structure is a relation over entity structures, with its relation type specified.
9The notation used here can easily be converted into the box notation commonly used in DRT.

10See Davidson (1967) and Parsons (1991) and other related works.
11See Mani and Pustejovsky (2012) for the spatio-temporal interactions involving motions.

<eventPath xml:id="ep1" trigger="#m1" end="#pl1" spatialRelator="#sr1"/>
<moveLink xml:id="mvL1" figure="#x1" ground="#ep1" relType="climb to"
goalReached="yes"/>

c. <motion xml:id="m2" target="" pred="climb" tense="past" goal="#pl1"/>

<eventPath xml:id="ep2" trigger="#m2" end=""/>

<moveLink xml:id="mvL1" figure="#x2" ground="#ep2" relType="climb to"

goalReached="no"/>

Lee succeeded in reaching the goal because the end of the event-path triggered by his climbing matched
the goal of his climbing. Kim, on the other hand, failed to reach the goal, for the end of his climbing path
was unspecified, failing to match the goal.12

4 Compatible Revision

4.1 Overview
As pointed out by Bunt et al. (2018), the notion of compatibility, related to semantic annotation schemes,
works at three different levels: abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and semantics. Here we are concerned
with compatibility at the semantic level. From an operational point of view, semantic compatibility is
understood as follows:

(12) Given two versions, v1 and v2, of a semantic annotation scheme,
v1 is semantically compatible with v2 only if the information annotated by v1 is also annotated by
v2 independent of how it is annotated.

Applied to ISO-Space, the compatibility of its first edition with its revised edition means a one-way
process can be defined for converting the annotations of the first edition to those according to the second
edition. The revision may not invalidate the first edition of ISO-Space (2014) from a theoretical point of
view, but when the new edition of an ISO standard is published, the first edition legally loses its status as
an ISO standard.

In this paper we focus on the movement link (<moveLink>) and entity structures associated with it
in the first edition of ISO-Space, presenting a procedure for reformulating them in the revised edition.13

There are two steps to the conversion:

(13) i. Rename all of the path-related attributes in the movement link <moveLink> in ISO-Space
(2014);

ii. Move all of the path-related attributes to an <eventPath> restored in the revised
version of ISO-Space.

Renaming attributes in a revision only affects the representation of annotation structures in some
concrete format, but does not affect the semantics, although the range of attribute values may change.
Changing the attribute name @beignPoint to @start, for example, only widens the range of their
values from a point topossibly a line or an area. This allows to treat examples like “The car sped off
Massachusetts Turnpike.”

4.2 Renaming
The proposed renaming process is summarized in Table 1:
With an ID of a motion as value, the attribute @trigger remains the same in both of the versions. In the
revised version, the attributes @source and @goal are renamed with path-related terms, @start and
@end, respectively. The attribute @midpoint is renamed @mids, a more general term that allows its

12Kim’s failure to reach the goal was made certain with the expression of couldn’t. If it is uncertain, the optional attribute
@goalReached is not marked up in <moveLink>.

13This procedure should be discussed in abstract terms, independent of representational issues, but is discussed in concrete
terms to make it easier to understand what changes are being made.

40

value to be a location which is either a place or a path, or a list of such locations. The attribute @mover
took a more general name @figure as in other links. The attribute @ground remains the same, but
has the ID of <eventPath> as value. The attribute @goalReached remains as an optional attribute
in revised <moveLink> elements with its possible value listed as either "yes" or "no". Being op-
tional, @goalReached may not be specified; if so, its value is interpreted as being "uncertain".
The two attributes, @pathID and motionSignalID, are removed, but incorporated into @mids and
<eventPath>, respectively.

4.3 Reallocation

Having modified the names of some of the attributes in <moveLink> in ISO-Space (2014), all of the five
path-related attributes, @trigger, @start, @end, @mids and @spatialRelator, some of
which are renamed, are reallocated from <moveLink> in the first edition to <eventPath> in the re-
vised edition. The remaining four attributes, @figure, @ground, @goalReached, and @comment
remain in the movement link <moveLink> with an additional attribute @relType introduced. The
three attributes @figure, @ground, and @relType are required to be specified, conforming to the
general link structure laid down by the ISO standard 2017-6 Principles of semantic annotation. The
attributes @goalReached and @comment are optional, as licensed by these principles.

Table 2 shows how these attributes are reallocated:

Table 2: Reallocation of Attributes in revised ISO-Space

ISO-Space (2014) Revised
<moveLink> <eventPath> <moveLink> <motion>
IDprefix="mvl" IDprefix="ep" IDprefix="mvL" IDprifix="m"
[trigger] trigger
[source] [start]
[goal] [end] [goal]
[midPoint] [mids]
[mover] figure
[ground] ground

relType
[goalReached] [goalReached]
[pathID]
[motionSignalID] [spatialRelator] [manner]
[comment] [comment] [comment] [comment]

Note 1: The attributes in [ ] are optional.

The right-most column shows how the entity structure representation <motion> is modified. There
are two attributes @goal and @manner introduced to it. The attribute @goal has an ID of a location

41



as its possible value. The value @goal may be the same as that of @end for <eventPath>. Then
the value of @goalReached for <moveLink> is "yes"; otherwise, it is "no" or "uncertain",
depending other cues. If the value is ”uncertain”, then @goal is not specified.

The attribute @manner annotates information on the means of a trans-locational motion-event not
through <moveLink>, as in the first 2014 edition of ISO-Space, but directly on the entity structure rep-
resentation <motion>. This allows the removal of the manner-type <motionSignal> from the first
edition. Except for these two newly introduced attributes, the original list of attributes for <motion>
remains the same in revised ISO-Space just as in the first edition.

4.4 Semantic Compatibility Sketched
For the interpretation of each movement link, tagged <moveLink>, of ISO-Space (2014), we assume
the following tuple as standing for a list of basic (discourse) entity types:

(14) <D, L, m, r>, where
D a set of discourse entities that include so-called spatial entities, represented by x1, x2, etc.;
L a set of locations, l1, l2, etc., or sequences of locations that may include a static path;
m is a motion;
r a dynamic route, called event-path.

This specifies variables for each of the entity types.
Then, associated with the attribute specification of <moveLink> in the concrete syntax of ISO-Space

(2014), we have the following interpretations as DRSs:

(15) a. Given:
attributes = identifier, [trigger], [mover], [source], [goal], [midPoint],

[ground], [goalReached], [pathID], [motionSignalID], [comment];

b. For motion(mi) and eventPath(r),14

�(triggermi) := triggers(mi, r);

�(moversei) := [mover(xi, mi), eventPath(r), traverses(xi, r)];

�(sourcepli) := startsAt(r, li);

�(goalplj) := [goal(lj , mj), endsAt(r, lj)] if goalReached="yes";

�(goalplj) := goal(lj , mi) if goalReached="no" or "uncertain";

�(midPoint{pl1,pl2,...}) := mids(r, <l1, l2>);

�(pathIDpi) := [path(li), overlaps(r, li)].

c. By combining them into one DRS together with [motion(i), eventPath(r)], we obtain the overall
DRS �(mvli) of the movement link.

All of the DRSs here reflect Axiom (1a) on event-paths and Definitions (1-3) of goalReached. The
whole process given above makes the DRSs compatible with revised ISO-Space.

Here is an example:

(16) a. ISO-Space (2014):
Johnse3 drovem3 toms4 Worecesterpl3 onss3 [Massachusetts Turnpike]p1.

b. Annotation:
<moveLink xml:id="mvl3" trigger="m3" mover="se3" goal="pl3"

goaReached="true" motionSignalID="ms4" pathID="p1"/>

c. Interpretation of each of the entity structures:
�(Johnse3) := [named(x3, John), person(x3)]

�(drovem3) := [drive(m3), past(m3)]

�(Worcesterpl3) := [named(l3, Worcester), city(l3)]

�(MassachusettsTurnpikep1) := [named(l4, Massachusetts Turnpike), highway(l4)]

14The domain of � is a (possibly singleton) set of attribute-value pairs associated with annotation structures.

42



d. Interpretation of the movement link structure with an event-path variable r:
�(mvl3) := [[triggers(m3, r), mover(x3, m3), eventPath(r), drives through(x3, r)],

[goal(l3, m3), endsAt(r, l3), path(l4), overlaps(l4, r)]]
15

The interpretation �(mvl3) of ISO-Space (2014) above is considered as conveying the information
obtained jointly from the interpretation of an event-path and that of the revised movement link in its
revised edition. This is validated by Axiom (1a) and the interpretation of the proposition goalReached.

5 Concluding Remarks

Revision should not invalidate all of the costly past work. As discussed by Bunt et al. (2018) in this
volume, compatibility is a requirement for revision. Such compatibility, especially as understood at the
semantic level, guarantees the preservation of information in the process of revision. This paper has
tried to show how such a requirement is a desirable option as compatibility of ISO-Space (2014) with
its revised edition, by presenting a way of deriving compatible semantic forms on the basis of Axiom
(1a) from unrevised annotations. Although we have shown it in this paper, the revision of the movement
link (<moveLink>) has been required by other independent reasons such as its conformity to and
its interoperability with other parts of the ISO 24617 standard on semantic annotation framework, as
discussed in Lee (2012), Lee (2016), Pustejovsky and Lee (2017), and Lee (2018).

Other modifications than that of <moveLink> have been made in the revised edition of ISO-
Space (ISO, 2014b). The measure link, tagged <mLink>, is such a case.16 The modification of
<mLink> as well as other parts in ISO-Space is not as complicated as the revision of <moveLink>.
We thus assume that the conversion of the specifications for other entity and link structures in the first
edition into those of its revised edition can be achieved relatively easily.
