Abstract

While machine translation has traditionally re-
lied on large amounts of parallel corpora, a re-
cent research line has managed to train both
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems
using monolingual corpora only. In this pa-
per, we identify and address several deficien-
cies of existing unsupervised SMT approaches
by exploiting subword information, develop-
ing a theoretically well founded unsupervised
tuning method, and incorporating a joint re-
finement procedure. Moreover, we use our im-
proved SMT system to initialize a dual NMT
model, which is further fine-tuned through on-
the-fly back-translation. Together, we obtain
large improvements over the previous state-
of-the-art in unsupervised machine transla-
tion. For instance, we get 22.5 BLEU points
in English-to-German WMT 2014, 5.5 points
more than the previous best unsupervised sys-
tem, and 0.5 points more than the (supervised)
shared task winner back in 2014.

1 Introduction

The recent advent of neural sequence-to-sequence
modeling has resulted in significant progress in the
field of machine translation, with large improve-
ments in standard benchmarks (Vaswani et al.,
2017; Edunov et al., 2018) and the first solid
claims of human parity in certain settings (Has-
san et al., 2018). Unfortunately, these systems
rely on large amounts of parallel corpora, which
are only available for a few combinations of major
languages like English, German and French.

Aiming to remove this dependency on paral-
lel data, a recent research line has managed to
train unsupervised machine translation systems
using monolingual corpora only. The first such
systems were based on Neural Machine Transla-
tion (NMT), and combined denoising autoencod-
ing and back-translation to train a dual model ini-

tialized with cross-lingual embeddings (Artetxe
et al., 2018c; Lample et al., 2018a). Neverthe-
less, these early systems were later superseded
by Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) based
approaches, which induced an initial phrase-table
through cross-lingual embedding mappings, com-
bined it with an n-gram language model, and fur-
ther improved the system through iterative back-
translation (Lample et al., 2018b; Artetxe et al.,
2018b).

In this paper, we develop a more principled ap-
proach to unsupervised SMT, addressing several
deficiencies of previous systems by incorporat-
ing subword information, applying a theoretically
well founded unsupervised tuning method, and de-
veloping a joint refinement procedure. In addition
to that, we use our improved SMT approach to ini-
tialize an unsupervised NMT system, which is fur-
ther improved through on-the-fly back-translation.

Our experiments on WMT 2014/2016 French-
English and German-English show the effective-
ness of our approach, as our proposed system out-
performs the previous state-of-the-art in unsuper-
vised machine translation by 5-7 BLEU points
in all these datasets and translation directions.
Our system also outperforms the supervised WMT
2014 shared task winner in English-to-German,
and is around 2 BLEU points behind it in the rest
of translation directions, suggesting that unsuper-
vised machine translation can be a usable alterna-
tive in practical settings.

The remaining of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 first discusses the related work in
the topic. Section 3 then describes our principled
unsupervised SMT method, while Section 4 dis-
cusses our hybridization method with NMT. We
then present the experiments done and the results
obtained in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the
paper.

2 Related work

Early attempts to build machine translation sys-
tems with monolingual corpora go back to statis-
tical decipherment (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Dou
and Knight, 2012). These methods see the source
language as ciphertext produced by a noisy chan-
nel model that first generates the original English
text and then probabilistically replaces the words
in it. The English generative process is modeled
using an n-gram language model, and the chan-
nel model parameters are estimated using either
expectation maximization or Bayesian inference.
This basic approach was later improved by incor-
porating syntactic knowledge (Dou and Knight,
2013) and word embeddings (Dou et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, these methods were only shown to
work in limited settings, being most often evalu-
ated in word-level translation.

More recently, the task got a renewed inter-
est after the concurrent work of Artetxe et al.
(2018c) and Lample et al. (2018a) on unsuper-
vised NMT which, for the first time, obtained
promising results in standard machine transla-
tion benchmarks using monolingual corpora only.
Both methods build upon the recent work on
unsupervised cross-lingual embedding mappings,
which independently train word embeddings in
two languages and learn a linear transformation to
map them to a shared space through self-learning
(Artetxe et al., 2017, 2018a) or adversarial train-
ing (Conneau et al., 2018). The resulting cross-
lingual embeddings are used to initialize a shared
encoder for both languages, and the entire sys-
tem is trained using a combination of denoising
autoencoding, back-translation and, in the case
of Lample et al. (2018a), adversarial training.
This method was further improved by Yang et al.
(2018), who use two language-specific encoders
sharing only a subset of their parameters, and in-
corporate a local and a global generative adversar-
ial network. Concurrent to our work, Lample and
Conneau (2019) report strong results initializing
an unsupervised NMT system with a cross-lingual
language model.

Following the initial work on unsupervised
NMT, it was argued that the modular architecture
of phrase-based SMT was more suitable for this
problem, and Lample et al. (2018b) and Artetxe
et al. (2018b) adapted the same principles dis-
cussed above to train an unsupervised SMT model,
obtaining large improvements over the original

unsupervised NMT systems. More concretely,
both approaches learn cross-lingual n-gram em-
beddings from monolingual corpora based on the
mapping method discussed earlier, and use them
to induce an initial phrase-table that is combined
with an n-gram language model and a distortion
model. This initial system is then refined through
iterative back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016)
which, in the case of Artetxe et al. (2018b), is pre-
ceded by an unsupervised tuning step. Our work
identifies some deficiencies in these previous sys-
tems, and proposes a more principled approach to
unsupervised SMT that incorporates subword in-
formation, uses a theoretically better founded un-
supervised tuning method, and applies a joint re-
finement procedure, outperforming these previous
systems by a substantial margin.

Very recently, some authors have tried to com-
bine both SMT and NMT to build hybrid unsuper-
vised machine translation systems. This idea was
already explored by Lample et al. (2018b), who
aided the training of their unsupervised NMT sys-
tem by combining standard back-translation with
synthetic parallel data generated by unsupervised
SMT. Marie and Fujita (2018) go further and use
synthetic parallel data from unsupervised SMT to
train a conventional NMT system from scratch.
The resulting NMT model is then used to aug-
ment the synthetic parallel corpus through back-
translation, and a new NMT model is trained on
top of it from scratch, repeating the process it-
eratively. Ren et al. (2019) follow a similar ap-
proach, but use SMT as posterior regularization
at each iteration. As shown later in our experi-
ments, our proposed NMT hybridization obtains
substantially larger absolute gains than all these
previous approaches, even if our initial SMT sys-
tem is stronger and thus more challenging to im-
prove upon.

3 Principled unsupervised SMT

Phrase-based SMT is formulated as a log-linear
combination of several statistical models: a trans-
lation model, a language model, a reordering
model and a word/phrase penalty. As such, build-
ing an unsupervised SMT system requires learn-
ing these different components from monolingual
corpora. As it turns out, this is straightforward
for most of them: the language model is learned
from monolingual corpora by definition; the word
and phrase penalties are parameterless; and one



196

can drop the standard lexical reordering model at a
small cost and do with the distortion model alone,
which is also parameterless. This way, the main
challenge left is learning the translation model,
that is, building the phrase-table.

Our proposed method starts by building an ini-
tial phrase-table through cross-lingual embedding
mappings (Section 3.1). This initial phrase-table is
then extended by incorporating subword informa-
tion, addressing one of the main limitations of pre-
vious unsupervised SMT systems (Section 3.2).
Having done that, we adjust the weights of the un-
derlying log-linear model through a novel unsu-
pervised tuning procedure (Section 3.3). Finally,
we further improve the system by jointly refining
two models in opposite directions (Section 3.4).

3.1 Initial phrase-table
So as to build our initial phrase-table, we follow
Artetxe et al. (2018b) and learn n-gram embed-
dings for each language independently, map them
to a shared space through self-learning, and use
the resulting cross-lingual embeddings to extract
and score phrase pairs.

More concretely, we train our n-gram embed-
dings using phrase2vec1, a simple extension of
skip-gram that applies the standard negative sam-
pling loss of Mikolov et al. (2013) to bigram-
context and trigram-context pairs in addition to the
usual word-context pairs.2 Having done that, we
map the embeddings to a cross-lingual space us-
ing VecMap3 with identical initialization (Artetxe
et al., 2018a), which builds an initial solution
by aligning identical words and iteratively im-
proves it through self-learning. Finally, we extract
translation candidates by taking the 100 nearest-
neighbors of each source phrase, and score them
by applying the softmax function over their cosine
similarities:

φ(f̄ |ē) =
exp

(
cos(ē, f̄)/τ

)∑
f̄ ′ exp

(
cos(ē, f̄ ′)/τ

)
where the temperature τ is estimated using max-
imum likelihood estimation over a dictionary in-
duced in the reverse direction. In addition to
the phrase translation probabilities in both direc-
tions, the forward and reverse lexical weightings

phrase2vec

2So as to keep the model size within a reasonable limit,
we restrict the vocabulary to the most frequent 200,000 uni-
grams, 400,000 bigrams and 400,000 trigrams.

3https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap

are also estimated by aligning each word in the tar-
get phrase with the one in the source phrase most
likely generating it, and taking the product of their
respective translation probabilities. The reader is
referred to Artetxe et al. (2018b) for more details.

3.2 Adding subword information

An inherent limitation of existing unsupervised
SMT systems is that words are taken as atomic
units, making it impossible to exploit character-
level information. This is reflected in the known
difficulty of these models to translate named en-
tities, as it is very challenging to discriminate
among related proper nouns based on distribu-
tional information alone, yielding to translation er-
rors like “Sunday Telegraph” → “The Times of
London” (Artetxe et al., 2018b).

So as to overcome this issue, we propose to
incorporate subword information once the initial
alignment is done at the word/phrase level. For
that purpose, we add two additional weights to the
initial phrase-table that are analogous to the lexi-
cal weightings, but use a character-level similarity
function instead of word translation probabilities:

score(f̄ |ē) =
∏
i

max

(
�,max

j
sim(f̄i, ēj)

)
where � = 0.3 guarantees a minimum similarity
score, as we want to favor translation candidates
that are similar at the character level without ex-
cessively penalizing those that are not. In our case,
we use a simple similarity function that normal-
izes the Levenshtein distance lev(·) (Levenshtein,
1966) by the length of the words len(·):

sim(f, e) = 1− lev(f, e)
max(len(f), len(e))

We leave the exploration of more elaborated sim-
ilarity functions and, in particular, learnable met-
rics (McCallum et al., 2005), for future work.

3.3 Unsupervised tuning

Having trained the underlying statistical models
independently, SMT tuning aims to adjust the
weights of their resulting log-linear combination
to optimize some evaluation metric like BLEU in a
parallel validation corpus, which is typically done
through Minimum Error Rate Training or MERT
(Och, 2003). Needless to say, this cannot be done
in strictly unsupervised settings, but we argue that

https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap


197

it would still be desirable to optimize some un-
supervised criterion that is expected to correlate
well with test performance. Unfortunately, nei-
ther of the existing unsupervised SMT systems
do so: Artetxe et al. (2018b) use a heuristic that
builds two initial models in opposite directions,
uses one of them to generates a synthetic parallel
corpus through back-translation (Sennrich et al.,
2016), and applies MERT to tune the model in
the reverse direction, iterating until convergence,
whereas Lample et al. (2018b) do not perform any
tuning at all. In what follows, we propose a more
principled approach to tuning that defines an unsu-
pervised criterion and an optimization procedure
that is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum
of it.

Inspired by the previous work on CycleGANs
(Zhu et al., 2017) and dual learning (He et al.,
2016), our method takes two initial models in op-
posite directions, and defines an unsupervised op-
timization objective that combines a cyclic con-
sistency loss and a language model loss over the
two monolingual corpora E and F :

L = Lcycle(E) + Lcycle(F ) + Llm(E) + Llm(F )

The cyclic consistency loss captures the intu-
ition that the translation of a translation should be
close to the original text. So as to quantify this, we
take a monolingual corpus in the source language,
translate it to the target language and back to the
source language, and compute its BLEU score tak-
ing the original text as reference:

Lcycle(E) = 1− BLEU(TF→E(TE→F (E)), E)

At the same time, the language model loss cap-
tures the intuition that machine translation should
produce fluent text in the target language. For that
purpose, we estimate the per-word entropy in the
target language corpus using an n-gram language
model, and penalize higher per-word entropies in
machine translated text as follows:4

Llm(E) = LP ·max(0,H(F )−H(TE→F (E)))2

4We initially tried to directly minimize the entropy of the
generated text, but this worked poorly in our preliminary ex-
periments on English-Spanish (note that we used this lan-
guage pair exclusively for development to be faithful to our
unsupervised scenario at test time). More concretely, the be-
havior of the optimization algorithm was very unstable, as it
tended to excessively focus on either the cyclic consistency
loss or the language model loss at the cost of the other, and
we found it very difficult to find the right balance between the
two factors.

where the length penalty LP = LP(E) · LP(F )
penalizes excessively long translations:5

LP(E) = max

(
1,

len(TF→E(TE→F (E)))

len(E)

)
So as to minimize the combined loss function,

we adapt MERT to jointly optimize the param-
eters of the two models. In its basic form, MERT
approximates the search space for each source
sentence through an n-best list, and performs a
form of coordinate descent by computing the op-
timal value for each parameter through an effi-
cient line search method and greedily taking the
step that leads to the largest gain. The process
is repeated iteratively until convergence, augment-
ing the n-best list with the updated parameters at
each iteration so as to obtain a better approxima-
tion of the full search space. Given that our opti-
mization objective combines two translation sys-
tems TF→E(TE→F (E)), this would require gen-
erating an n-best list for TE→F (E) first and, for
each entry on it, generating a new n-best list with
TF→E , yielding a combined n-best list with N2

entries. So as to make it more efficient, we pro-
pose an alternating optimization approach where
we fix the parameters of one model and optimize
the other with standard MERT. Thanks to this, we
do not need to expand the search space of the fixed
model, so we can do with an n-best list of N en-
tries alone. Having done that, we fix the parame-
ters of the opposite model and optimize the other,
iterating until convergence.

3.4 Joint refinement
Constrained by the lack of parallel corpora, the
procedure described so far makes important sim-
plifications that could compromise its potential
performance: its phrase-table is somewhat unnatu-
ral (e.g. the translation probabilities are estimated
from cross-lingual embeddings rather than actual
frequency counts) and it lacks a lexical reordering
model altogether. So as to overcome this issue, ex-
isting unsupervised SMT methods generate a syn-
thetic parallel corpus through back-translation and
use it to train a standard SMT system from scratch,
iterating until convergence.

5Without this penalization, the system tended to produce
unnecessary tokens (e.g. quotes) that looked natural in their
context, which served to minimize the per-word perplexity
of the output. Minimizing the overall perplexity instead of
the per-word perplexity did not solve the problem, as the op-
posite phenomenon arose (i.e. the system tended to produce
excessively short translations).



198

An obvious drawback of this approach is that
the back-translated side will contain ungrammati-
cal n-grams and other artifacts that will end up in
the induced phrase-table. One could argue that this
should be innocuous as long as the ungrammati-
cal n-grams are in the source side, as they should
never occur in real text and their corresponding en-
tries in the phrase-table should therefore not be
used. However, ungrammatical source phrases
do ultimately affect the estimation of the back-
ward translation probabilities, including those of
grammatical phrases.6 We argue that, ultimately,
the backward probability estimations can only be
meaningful when all source phrases are grammati-
cal (so the probabilities of all plausible translations
sum to one) and, similarly, the forward probabil-
ity estimations can only be meaningful when all
target phrases are grammatical.

Following the above observation, we propose
an alternative approach that jointly refines both
translation directions. More concretely, we use
the initial systems to build two synthetic corpora
in opposite directions.7 Having done that, we in-
dependently extract phrase pairs from each syn-
thetic corpus, and build a phrase-table by taking
their intersection. The forward probabilities are
estimated in the parallel corpus with the synthetic
source side, while the backward probabilities are
estimated in the one with the synthetic target side.
This does not only guarantee that the probability
estimates are meaningful as discussed previously,
but it also discards the ungrammatical phrases al-
together, as both the source and the target n-grams
must have occurred in the original monolingual
texts to be present in the resulting phrase-table.
This phrase-table is then combined with a lexical
reordering model learned on the synthetic parallel
corpus in the reverse direction, and we apply the
unsupervised tuning method described in Section
3.3 to adjust the weights of the resulting system.
We repeat this process for a total of 3 iterations.8

6For instance, let’s say that the target phrase “dos gatos”
has been aligned 10 times with “two cats” and 90 times with
“two cat”. While the ungrammatical phrase-table entry two
cat- dos gatos should never be picked, the backward proba-
bility estimation of two cats - dos gatos is still affected by it
(it would be 0.1 instead of 1.0 in this example).

7For efficiency purposes, we restrict the size of each syn-
thetic parallel corpus to 10 million sentence pairs.

8For the last iteration, we do not perform any tuning and
use default Moses weights instead, which we found to be
more robust during development. Note, however, that us-
ing unsupervised tuning during the previous steps was still
strongly beneficial.

4 NMT hybridization

While the rigid and modular design of SMT pro-
vides a very suitable framework for unsupervised
machine translation, NMT has shown to be a fairly
superior paradigm in supervised settings, outper-
forming SMT by a large margin in standard bench-
marks. As such, the choice of SMT over NMT
also imposes a hard ceiling on the potential per-
formance of these approaches, as unsupervised
SMT systems inherit the very same limitations
of their supervised counterparts (e.g. the local-
ity and sparsity problems). For that reason, we
argue that SMT provides a more appropriate ar-
chitecture to find an initial alignment between the
languages, but NMT is ultimately a better archi-
tecture to model the translation process.

Following this observation, we propose a hybrid
approach that uses unsupervised SMT to warm up
a dual NMT model trained through iterative back-
translation. More concretely, we first train two
SMT systems in opposite directions as described
in Section 3, and use them to assist the training of
another two NMT systems in opposite directions.
These NMT systems are trained following an it-
erative process where, at each iteration, we alter-
nately update the model in each direction by per-
forming a single pass over a synthetic parallel cor-
pus built through back-translation (Sennrich et al.,
2016).9 In the first iteration, the synthetic parallel
corpus is entirely generated by the SMT system in
the opposite direction but, as training progresses
and the NMT models get better, we progressively
switch to a synthetic parallel corpus generated by
the reverse NMT model. More concretely, itera-
tion t uses Nsmt = N · max(0, 1 − t/a) syn-
thetic parallel sentences from the reverse SMT
system, where the parameter a controls the num-
ber of transition iterations from SMT to NMT
back-translation. The remaining N − Nsmt sen-
tences are generated by the reverse NMT model.
Inspired by Edunov et al. (2018), we use greedy
decoding for half of them, which produces more
fluent and predictable translations, and random
sampling for the other half, which produces more
varied translations. In our experiments, we use
N = 1, 000, 000 and a = 30, and perform a to-
tal of 60 such iterations. At test time, we use beam
search decoding with an ensemble of all check-

9Note that we do not train a new model from scratch each
time, but continue training the model from the previous iter-
ation.

5 Experiments and results

In order to make our experiments comparable to
previous work, we use the French-English and
German-English datasets from the WMT 2014
shared task. More concretely, our training data
consists of the concatenation of all News Crawl
monolingual corpora from 2007 to 2013, which
make a total of 749 million tokens in French, 1,606
millions in German, and 2,109 millions in English,
from which we take a random subset of 2,000
sentences for tuning (Section 3.3). Preprocessing
is done using standard Moses tools, and involves
punctuation normalization, tokenization with ag-
gressive hyphen splitting, and truecasing.

Our SMT implementation is based on Moses10,
and we use the KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013)
tool included in it to estimate our 5-gram language
model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Our
unsupervised tuning implementation is based on
Z-MERT (Zaidan, 2009), and we use FastAlign
(Dyer et al., 2013) for word alignment within the
joint refinement procedure. Finally, we use the big
transformer implementation from fairseq11 for our
NMT system, training with a total batch size of
20,000 tokens across 8 GPUs with the exact same
hyperparameters as Ott et al. (2018).

We use newstest2014 as our test set for
10http://www.statmt.org/moses/
11https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq

French-English, and both newstest2014 and new-
stest2016 (from WMT 201612) for German-
English. Following common practice, we re-
port tokenized BLEU scores as computed by the
multi-bleu.perl script included in Moses.
In addition to that, we also report detokenized
BLEU scores as computed by SacreBLEU13

(Post, 2018), which is equivalent to the official
mteval-v13a.pl script.

We next present the results of our proposed sys-
tem in comparison to previous work in Section
5.1. Section 5.2 then compares the obtained re-
sults to those of different supervised systems. Fi-
nally, Section 5.3 presents some translation exam-
ples from our system.

5.1 Main results

Table 1 reports the results of the proposed sys-
tem in comparison to previous work. As it can be
seen, our full system obtains the best published re-
sults in all cases, outperforming the previous state-
of-the-art by 5-7 BLEU points in all datasets and
translation directions.

A substantial part of this improvement comes
from our more principled unsupervised SMT ap-

12Note that it is only the test set that is from WMT 2016.
All the training data comes from WMT 2014 News Crawl, so
it is likely that our results could be further improved by using
the more extensive monolingual corpora from WMT 2016.

proach, which outperforms all previous SMT-
based systems by around 2 BLEU points. Nev-
ertheless, it is the NMT hybridization that brings
the largest gains, improving the results of this ini-
tial SMT systems by 5-9 BLEU points. As shown
in Table 2, our absolute gains are considerably
larger than those of previous hybridization meth-
ods, even if our initial SMT system is substan-
tially better and thus more difficult to improve
upon. This way, our initial SMT system is about
4-5 BLEU points above that of Marie and Fujita
(2018), yet our absolute gain on top of it is around
2.5 BLEU points higher. When compared to Lam-
ple et al. (2018b), we obtain an absolute gain of 5-
6 BLEU points in both French-English directions
while they do not get any clear improvement, and
we obtain an improvement of 7-9 BLEU points in
both German-English directions, in contrast with
the 2.3 BLEU points they obtain.

More generally, it is interesting that pure SMT
systems perform better than pure NMT systems,
yet the best results are obtained by initializing an
NMT system with an SMT system. This suggests
that the rigid and modular architecture of SMT
might be more suitable to find an initial alignment
between the languages, but the final system should
be ultimately based on NMT for optimal results.

5.2 Comparison with supervised systems

So as to put our results into perspective, Table 3 re-
ports the results of different supervised systems in
the same WMT 2014 test set. More concretely, we
include the best results from the shared task itself,
which reflect the state-of-the-art in machine trans-
lation back in 2014; those of Vaswani et al. (2017),
who introduced the now predominant transformer
architecture; and those of Edunov et al. (2018),
who apply back-translation at a large scale and,
to the best of our knowledge, hold the current best
results in the test set.

As it can be seen, our unsupervised system out-
performs the WMT 2014 shared task winner in
English-to-German, and is around 2 BLEU points
behind it in the other translation directions. This
shows that unsupervised machine translation is al-
ready competitive with the state-of-the-art in su-
pervised machine translation in 2014. While the
field of machine translation has undergone great
progress in the last 5 years, and the gap between
our unsupervised system and the current state-of-
the-art in supervised machine translation is still
large as reflected by the other results, this suggests
that unsupervised machine translation can be a us-
able alternative in practical settings.

5.3 Qualitative results

Table 4 shows some translation examples from our
proposed system in comparison to those reported
by Artetxe et al. (2018b). We choose the exact
same sentences reported by Artetxe et al. (2018b),
which were randomly taken from newstest2014,
so they should be representative of the general be-
havior of both systems.

While not perfect, our proposed system pro-
duces generally fluent translations that accurately
capture the meaning of the original text. Just in
line with our quantitative results, this suggests that
unsupervised machine translation can be a usable
alternative in practical settings.

Compared to Artetxe et al. (2018b), our transla-
tions are generally more fluent, which is not sur-
prising given that they are produced by an NMT
system rather than an SMT system. In addition to
that, the system of Artetxe et al. (2018b) has some
adequacy issues when translating named entities
and numerals (e.g. 34→ 32, Sunday Telegraph→
The Times of London), which we do not observe
for our proposed system in these examples.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we identify several deficiencies in
previous unsupervised SMT systems, and pro-
pose a more principled approach that addresses
them by incorporating subword information, us-
ing a theoretically well founded unsupervised tun-
ing method, and developing a joint refinement pro-
cedure. In addition to that, we use our improved
SMT approach to initialize a dual NMT model
that is further improved through on-the-fly back-
translation. Our experiments show the effective-
ness of our approach, as we improve the previous
state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine transla-
tion by 5-7 BLEU points in French-English and
German-English WMT 2014 and 2016. Our code
is available as an open source project at https:
//github.com/artetxem/monoses.

In the future, we would like to explore learn-
able similarity functions like the one proposed by
(McCallum et al., 2005) to compute the character-
level scores in our initial phrase-table. In addition
to that, we would like to incorporate a language
modeling loss during NMT training similar to He

et al. (2016). Finally, we would like to adapt our
approach to more relaxed scenarios with multiple
languages and/or small parallel corpora.
