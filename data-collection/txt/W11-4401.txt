Abstract

The paradigm of parsing as intersection has
been used throughout the literature to ob-
tain elegant and general solutions to numerous
problems involving grammars and automata.
The paradigm has its origins in (Bar-Hillel
et al., 1964), where a general construction
was used to prove closure of context-free lan-
guages under intersection with regular lan-
guages. It was pointed out by (Lang, 1994)
that such a construction isolates the parsing
problem from the recognition problem. The
latter can be solved by a reduction of the out-
come of intersection.

The paradigm has been extended in vari-
ous ways, by considering more powerful for-
malisms, such as tree adjoining grammars
(Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993), simple RCGs
(Bertsch and Nederhof, 2001), tree gram-
mars (Nederhof, 2009), and probabilistic ex-
tensions of grammatical formalisms (Neder-
hof and Satta, 2003). Different applications
have been identified, such as computation of
distances between languages (Nederhof and
Satta, 2008), and parameter estimation of
probabilistic models (Nederhof, 2005).

The lecture will focus on another applica-
tion, namely the computation of prefix prob-
abilities (Nederhof and Satta, 2011c) and in-
fix probabilities (Nederhof and Satta, 2011a)
and will address novel generalisations to lin-
ear context-free rewriting systems (Nederhof
and Satta, 2011b).
