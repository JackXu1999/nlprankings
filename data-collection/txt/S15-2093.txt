Abstract

We present an approach for tackling the Sen-
timent Analysis problem in SemEval 2015.
The approach is based on the use of a co-
occurrence graph to represent existing rela-
tionships among terms in a document with
the aim of using centrality measures to extract
the most representative words that express the
sentiment. These words are then used in a su-
pervised learning algorithm as features to ob-
tain the polarity of unknown documents. The
best results obtained for the different datasets
are: 77.76% for positive, 100% for negative
and 68.04% for neutral, showing that the pro-
posed graph-based representation could be a
way of extracting terms that are relevant to de-
tect a sentiment.

1 Introduction

In the past decade, new forms of communication,
such as microblogging and text messaging have
emerged and become ubiquitous. While there is no
limit to the range of information conveyed by tweets
and texts, often these short messages are used to
share opinions and sentiments that people have
about what is going on in the world around them.
Working with these informal text genres presents
challenges for natural language processing (NLP)
beyond those encountered when working with more
traditional text genres. Typically this kind of texts
are short and the language used is very informal.
We can find creative spelling and punctuation, slang,
new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology
and abbreviations that make their manipulation more
challenging.

Representing that kind of text for automatically
mining and understanding the opinions and senti-
ments that people communicate inside them has very
recently become an attractive research topic (Pang,
2008). In this sense, the experiments reported in
this paper were carried out in the framework of the
SemEval 20151 (Semantic Evaluation) which has
created a series of tasks for Sentiment Analysis on
Twitter (Rosenthal, 2015). Among the proposed
tasks we find Task 10, subtask B which was named
Message Polarity Classification and was defined
as follows: ”Given a message, classify whether the
message is of positive, negative, or neutral senti-
ment. For messages conveying both a positive and
a negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sen-
timent should be chosen”. In order to solve this task
we create an approach that uses a graph based rep-
resentation to extract relevant words that are used
in a supervised learning method to classify a set of
unknown documents in different topics and genres
provided by the SemEval team. The methodology
for our approach is discussed in detail in the next
sections.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2 we present some related work found in the
literature with respect to the identification of senti-
ments in text documents. In Section 3 a graph based
representation is proposed. In Section 4 the method-
ology and the tools used to detect the sentiments of
a set of unknown documents are explained. In Sec-
tion 5, the experimental results are presented and
discussed. Finally, in Section 6 the conclusions as
well as further work are described.

2 Related Work

There exist a number of works in literature associ-
ated to the automatic identification of sentiments in
documents. Some of these works have focused on
the contribution of particular features, such as the
use of the vocabulary to extract lexical elements as-
sociated to the documents (Kim, 2006), the use of
bigrams and trigrams (Dave, 2008) to capture syn-
tactic features of texts associated with a sentiment,
the use of dictionaries and emoticons of positive and
negative words (Agarwal, 2011) as well as lexical-
syntactic features or the use of Part of Speech tags
(PoS) (Wilks, 1999; Whitelaw, 2005) as syntactic
features that can help to disambiguate the polarity
of the words in a context.

In the other hand, many contributions focused on
the use of structures to represent the features asso-
ciated to a document like the frequency of occur-
rence vector (Wrobel, 2002; Aizawa, 2003; Serrano,
2006). Finally, linear representation of documents
features combined with the use of a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) has shown great performance in the
tasks associated with the classification of texts (Vap-
nik, 1995; Joachims, 1998).

Research works that use graph representations for
texts in the context of Sentiment Analysis barely ap-
pear in the literature (Pinto, 2014; Poria, 2014). It
usually has been proposed the concept of n-grams
with a frequency of occurrence vector to solved it
(Pang, 2008). However, there is still an enormous
gap between this approach and the use of more de-
tailed graph structures that represent in a natural way
the lexical, semantic and stylistic features.

3 Graph-Based Representation

Among different proposals for mapping texts to
graphs, the co-occurrence of words (Sonawane,
2014) has become a simple but effective way to rep-
resent the relationship of one term over another one
in texts where there is no syntactic order (usually
social media texts like Twitter or SMS). Formally
the proposed co-ocurrence graph is represented by
G = (V, E, L, α), where:

• V = {vi|i = 1, ..., n} is a finite set of vertices
that consists of the words contained in one or
several texts.

• E ⊆ V × V is the finite set of edges which
represents that two vertices are connected by
means of the co- occurrence, where:

– Two vertices are connected if their cor-
responding lexical units co-occur within
a window of maximum N words, where
N can be set to any value (typically be-
tween two and ten words).

• L is the edges tag set which consists of the
number of times that two vertices co-occur in
a text window.

• α : E → L is a function that assigns a tag to a
pair of associated vertices.

As an example, consider the following sentence ζ
extracted from a text T in the dataset: “They may
have a SuperBowl in Dallas, but Dallas ain’t win-
ning a SuperBowl. Not with that quarterback and
owner, they are really bad.”, which after the prepro-
cessing stage (see Section 4) would be as follows:
“may have SuperBowl Dallas Dallas ain’t winning
SuperBowl quarterback owner are bad”. Based on
the proposed representation, preprocessed sentence
ζ can be mapped to the proposed co-ocurrence graph
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2: Sentiment Analysis Process

The co-occurrence graph shown in figure 1 has the
following features:

• Terms co-occur within a window of 3 words.
• The set of vertices consists of the preprocessed

words in sentence ζ.

• An edge between two vertices represent that
both words appear in the same co-occurrence
window (at least once).

• The label edge between two vertices represents
the number of times that two words appear in a
co-occurrence window in sentence ζ.

4 Sentiment Analysis Process Using A
Graph Representation

Figure 2 shows the methodology used to detect the
sentiments associated to a set of unknown docu-
ments, considering the use of graphs to extract the
most relevant words associated to the documents.
The methodology consists of five steps:

1. Preprocess all documents associated with the
SemEval 2015 dataset. This task includes elim-
ination of punctuation symbols and all the ele-
ments that are not part of the ASCII encoding.

Then, each preprocessed sentence in a text is
tagged with its corresponding PoS tags, for this
step, the TreeTagger tool2 was used.

2. Map only the nouns, verbs and adjectives of all
documents in the training set to a graph repre-
sentation (see section 3).

3. Apply the Degree and Closeness centrality
measures (Freeman, 1979) which are indicators
that identify the most important vertices within
a graph, where:

• The Degree centrality is defined as the
number of links incident upon a vertex in
the graph and is used to find the topologi-
cally representative words.

• The Closeness centrality is defined as the
average sum of the shortest paths from one
vertex to the others in the graph and is
used to find the most accessible words in
the graph which consequently are syntac-
tically relevant.

4. For each document in the training and test col-
lection extract the top 100 ranked vertices (the

centrality measures in the graph without repe-
tition and use them to build a frequency of oc-
currence vector (Manning, 2008).

5. Apply a SVM classifier (Harrington, 2012)
with a polynomial kernel implemented in the
scikit-learn3 platform (Pedregosa, 2011), in or-
der to construct a classification model which is
used for determining the sentiment of a given
anonymous document.

5 Experimental results

The results obtained with the proposed approach are
discussed in this section. First, we describe the
dataset used in the experiments and, thereafter, the
results obtained.

5.1 Dataset
The description of the three text collections used in
the experiments for the SemEval 2015 is shown in
the next table:

The test corpus was made up of short texts (mes-
sages) categorized as: ”Progress Test” and Offi-
cial 2015 Test. The Progress Test includes the fol-
lowing datasets: LiveJournal2014, SMS2013, Twit-
ter2013, Twitter2014 and Twitter2014Sarcasm. A

complete description of the training and test datasets
can be found at the task description paper (Rosen-
thal, 2015).

5.2 Obtained results

In Table 2 we present results obtained with each
dataset considered in the SemEval 2015 competi-
tion. The results were evaluated according to the
(F1pos + F1neg)/2 measure (Rosenthal, 2014) for
the overall score and the precision measure (Man-
ning, 2008) for each one of the sentiments. Our
approach performed in all cases above the base-
line. We consider that these results were obtained
even though the training corpus was very unbal-
anced (there were more positive texts than others)
and there was a high difference between the vocabu-
lary of the training and test datasets. Further anal-
ysis on the use of centrality measures and on the
methodology for constructing the graph will allow
us to find more accurate features that can be used
in a supervised learning method for the Sentiment
Analysis problem.

6 Conclusions

We have presented an approach that uses a super-
vised learning method with a graph based repre-
sentation. The results obtained show a competitive
performance that is above the baseline score. The
model presents a good performance on the Twitter
dataset. However, there is still a great deal to im-
prove on the LiveJournal and SMS datasets where
the text could be smaller and the use of slang and
genre-specific terminology is usual. One of the con-
tributions of this paper is that we use a graph based
representation (with an excellent runtime) with cen-
trality measures to discover words related to each

559



sentiment instead of using traditional features like n-
grams and vocabulary. As further work we propose
the following:

• Experiment with other graph representations
for texts that include alternative levels of lan-
guage descriptions such as the use of sentence
chunks, pragmatic sentences, etc.

• Apply the graph representation described in
this paper to the Authorship Attribution prob-
lem (Holmes, 1994), where training and test
data sets are balanced and belong to the same
linguistic domain.

• Explore different supervised/unsupervised
classification algorithms.
