Abstract

This article presents the SIRIUS-LTG sys-
tem for the Fact Extraction and VERification
(FEVER) Shared Task. It consists of three
components: 1) Wikipedia Page Retrieval:
First we extract the entities in the claim, then
we find potential Wikipedia URI candidates
for each of the entities using a SPARQL query
over DBpedia 2) Sentence selection: We in-
vestigate various techniques i.e. Smooth In-
verse Frequency (SIF), Word Mover’s Dis-
tance (WMD), Soft-Cosine Similarity, Cosine
similarity with unigram Term Frequency In-
verse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to rank
sentences by their similarity to the claim. 3)
Textual Entailment: We compare three models
for the task of claim classification. We apply a
Decomposable Attention (DA) model (Parikh
et al., 2016), a Decomposed Graph Entail-
ment (DGE) model (Khot et al., 2018) and a
Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (TalosTree)
model (Sean et al., 2017) for this task. The
experiments show that the pipeline with sim-
ple Cosine Similarity using TFIDF in sentence
selection along with DA model as labelling
model achieves the best results on the devel-
opment set (F1 evidence: 32.17, label accu-
racy: 59.61 and FEVER score: 0.3778). Fur-
thermore, it obtains 30.19, 48.87 and 36.55
in terms of F1 evidence, label accuracy and
FEVER score, respectively, on the test set. Our
system ranks 15th among 23 participants in the
shared task prior to any human-evaluation of
the evidence.

1 Introduction

The Web contains vast amounts of data from many
heterogeneous sources, and the harvesting of in-
formation from these sources can be extremely
valuable for several domains and applications such
as, for instance, business intelligence. The vol-
ume and variety of data on the Web are increas-
ing at a very rapid pace, making their use and
processing increasingly difficult. A large volume

of information on the Web consists of unstruc-
tured text which contains facts about named enti-
ties (NE) such as people, places and organizations.
At the same time, the recent evolution of pub-
lishing and connecting data over the Web dubbed
”Linked Data” provides a machine-readable and
enriched representation of many of the world’s en-
tities, together with their semantic characteristics.
These structured data sources are a result of the
creation of large knowledge bases (KB) by dif-
ferent communities, which are often interlinked,
as is the case of DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2015)
1, Yago 2 (Suchanek et al., 2007) and FreeBase 3

(Bollacker et al., 2008). This characteristic of the
Web of data empowers both humans and computer
agents to discover more concepts by easily navi-
gating among the datasets, and can profitably be
exploited in complex tasks such as information re-
trieval, question answering, knowledge extraction
and reasoning.

Fact extraction from unstructured text is a task
central to knowledge base construction. While
this process is vital for many NLP applications,
misinformation (false information) or disinforma-
tion (deliberately false information) from unreli-
able sources, can provide false output and mislead
the readers. Such risks could be properly managed
by applying NLP techniques aimed at solving the
task of fact verification, i.e., to detect and discrim-
inate misinformation and prevent its propagation.
The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER)
shared task 4 (Thorne et al., 2018) addresses both
problems. In this work, we introduce a pipeline
system for each phase of the FEVER shared task.
In our pipeline, we first identify entities in a given
claim, then we extract candidate Wikipedia pages
for each of the entities and the most similar sen-

tences are obtained using a textual similarity mea-
sure. Finally, we label the claim with regard to ev-
idence sentences using a textual entailment tech-
nique.

2 System description

In this section, we describe our system which con-
sists of three components which solve the three
following tasks: Wikipedia page retrieval, sen-
tence selection and textual entailment.

2.1 Wiki-page Retrieval
Each claim in the FEVER dataset contains a single
piece of information about an entity that its orig-
inal Wikipedia page describes. Therefore we first
extract entities using the Stanford Named Entity
Recognition (StanfordNER) (Finkel et al., 2005).
We observe that StanfordNER is sometimes un-
able to extract entity names in the claim due to
limited contextual information like in example 1
below:
Example 1 A View to a Kill is an
action movie.
NER:[]
Noun-Phrases:[A View to a Kill, an action
movie]

To tackle this problem, we also extract noun
phrases using the parse tree of Stanford CoreNLP
(Manning et al., 2014) and the longest multi-word
expression that contains words with the first letter
in upper case. This enables us to provide a wide
range of potential entities for the retrieval process.
We then retrieve a set of Wikipedia page candi-
dates for an entity in the claim using a SPARQL
(Prud’hommeaux and Seaborne, 2008) query over
DBpedia, i.e. the structured version of Wikipedia.

The SPARQL query aids the retrieval process
by providing a list of candidates to the subsequent
system components, particularly when the claim
is about film, song, music album, bands and etc.
Listing 1 shows the query employed for the entity
Meteora in Example 2 below, which outputs the
resulting Wikipedia pages (Pages):
Example 2 Meteora is not a rock
album.
Entity:[Meteora]
Pages:[’Meteora’, ’Meteora (album)’,
’Meteora Monastary’, ’Meteora (Greek

monasteries)’, ’Meteora (film)’]

The query retrieves all the Wikipedia pages
which contains the entity mention in their title.

prefix rdfs:<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
prefix fn:<http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?resource
WHERE {?resource rdfs:label ?s.
?s <bif:contains> ’"Meteora"’.

FILTER (lang(?s) ="en")
FILTER ( fn:string-length
(fn:substring-after(?resource,
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/"))>1)
FILTER (regex(str(?resource),
"http://dbpedia.org/resource")
&& !regex(str(?resource),
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/File:")
&& !regex(str(?resource),
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:")
&& !regex(str(?resource),
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:")
&& !regex(str(?resource),
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/List")
&& !regex(str(?resource), "(disambiguation)")

)
}

page candidates for entity mention (e.g. Meteora)

2.2 Sentence Selection

Given a set of Wikipedia page candidates, the sim-
ilarity between the claim and the individual text
lines on the page is obtained. We here experiment
with several methods for computing this similar-
ity:

Cosine Similarity using TFIDF: Sentences are
ranked by unigram TF-IDF similarity to the claim.
We modified the fever-baseline code to consider
the candidate list from the Wiki-page retrieval
components.

Soft-Cosine Similarity: Following the work of
Charlet and Damnati (2017), we measure the sim-
ilarity between the candidate sentences and the
claim. This textual similarity measure relies on
the introduction of a relation matrix in the classi-
cal cosine similarity between bag-of-words. The
relation matrix is calculated using the word2vec
representations of words.

Word Mover’s Distance(WMD): The WMD distance
”measures the dissimilarity between two text doc-
uments as the minimum amount of distance that
the embedded words of one document need to
’travel’ to reach the embedded words of another
document” (Kusner et al., 2015). The word2vec
embeddings is used to calculate semantic dis-
tances of words in the embedding space.

Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF): We also create
sentence embeddings using the SIF weighting
scheme (Arora et al., 2017) for a claim and candi-



121

date sentences. Then we calculate the cosine sim-
ilarity measure between these embedding vectors.

2.3 Entailment

The previous component provides the most sim-
ilar sentences as an evidence set for each claim.
In this component, the aim is to find out whether
the selected sentences enable us to classify a claim
as being either SUPPORTED, REFUTED or NOT
ENOUGH INFO. In cases where multiple sen-
tences are selected as evidence, their strings are
concatenated prior to classification. If the set of
selected sentences is empty for a specific claim,
due to the failure in finding related Wiki-page, we
simply assign NOT ENOUGH INFO as an entail-
ment label. In order to solve the entailment task
we experiment with the use of several existing
textual entailment systems with somewhat differ-
ent requirements and properties. We follow the
instruction from the Git-Hub repositories of the
three following models and investigate their per-
formances in the FEVER textual entailment sub-
task:

Decomposable Attention (DA) model (Parikh et al., 2016):
We used the publicly available DA model 5 which
is trained on the FEVER shared task dataset. We
asked the model to predict an inference label for
each claim based on the evidence set which is pro-
vided by the sentence selection component.

Decomposed Graph Entailment (DGE) model: Khot
et al. (2018) propose a decomposed graph entail-
ment model that uses structure from the claim to
calculate entailment probabilities for each node
and edge in the graph structure and aggregates
them for the final entailment computation. The
original DGE model 6 uses Open IE (Khot et al.,
2017) tuples as a graph representation for the
claim. However, it is mentioned that the model can
use any graph with labeled edges. Therefore, we
provide a syntactic dependency parse tree using
the Stanford dependency parser (Manning et al.,
2014) which outputs the Enhanced Universal De-
pendencies representation (Schuster and Manning,
2016) as a graph representation for the claim.

Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees model: We also ex-
periment with the TalosTree model 7 (Sean et al.,

News Challenge (Pomerleau and Ra, 2017). The
TalosTree model utilizes text-based features de-
rived from the claim and evidences, which are
then fed into Gradient Boosted Trees to predict
the relation between the claim and the evidences.
The features that are used in the prediction model
are word count, TF-IDF, sentiment and a singular-
value decomposition feature in combination with
word2vec embeddings.

3 Experiments

3.1 Dataset
The shared-task (Thorne et al., 2018) provides an
annotated dataset of 185,445 claims along with
their evidence sets. The shared-task dataset is di-
vided into 145,459 , 19,998 and 19,998 train, de-
velopment and test instances, respectively. The
claims are generated from information extracted
from Wikipedia. The Wikipedia dump (version
June 2017) was processed with Stanford CoreNLP,
and the claims sampled from the introductory sec-
tions of approximately 50,000 popular pages.

3.2 Evaluation
In this section we evaluate our system in the two
main subtasks of the shared task: I) evidence ex-
traction (wiki-page retrieval and sentence selec-
tion) and II) Entailment. Since, the scoring for-
mula in the shared-task considers only the first 5
predicted sentence evidences, we choose 5-most
similar sentences in the sentence selection phase
(Section 2.2).

3.2.1 Evidence Extraction
Initially, the impact of different similarity mea-
sures in sentence selection is evaluated. Table 1
shows the results of the various similarity mea-
sures described in section 2 for the evidence ex-
traction subtask on the development set. The re-

baseline the label accuracy uses the annotated evidence instead of evidence from the evidence extraction
module.

sults suggest that the simple cosine similarity us-
ing TF-IDF is the best performing method for the
sentence selection component when compared to
the other similarity techniques. With an F1-score
of 32.17 it clearly outperforms the Soft-Cosine
Similarity (F1 30.05), WMD (F1 27.90) and SIF
(F1 23.22) measures. This component clearly also
outperforms the FEVER baseline for this subtask
(F1 17.18).

3.2.2 Entailment

This component is trained on pairs of annotated
claims and evidence sets from the FEVER shared-
task training dataset. We here train two different
models i.e. DGE and TalosTree and we utilize
the pre-trained DA model. We evaluate classifi-
cation accuracy on the development set, assum-
ing that the evidence sentences are extracted in the
evidence extraction phase with the best perform-
ing setup. The results are presented in Table 2
and show that the NOT ENOUGH INFO class is
difficult to detect for all three models. Further-
more, the DA model achieves the best accuracy
and FEVER score compared to the others. We also
observe that the label accuracy has a significant
impact on the total FEVER score.

3.2.3 Final System

The final system pipeline is established with the
SPARQL query and cosine similarity using TFIDF
in the evidence extraction module, and using the
decomposable attention model for the entailment
subtask. Table 3 depicts the final submission re-
sults over the test set using our system.

4 Conclusion

We present our system for the FEVER shared
task to extract evidence from Wikipedia and ver-
ify each claim w.r.t. the obtained evidence. We
examine various configurations for each compo-
nent of the system. The experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the TF-IDF cosine similarity
measure and decomposable attention on both the
development and test datasets.

Our future work includes: 1) to implement a
semi-supervised machine learning method for ev-
idence extraction , and 2) to investigate different
neural architectures for the verification task.
