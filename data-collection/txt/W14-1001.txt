Abstract 

The talk will report on recent and ongoing work dedicated to analytical methods for a systematic 
combination of observed strengths of translation technologies. The focus will be on different ways of 
exploiting existing data on MT output and performance measures for system combination and for 
gaining insights on strengths and weaknesses of existing technologies.
