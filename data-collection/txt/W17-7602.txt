does representation matter?

Abstract

Research in syntactic parsing is largely driven by progress in intrinsic evaluation and there have been
impressive developments in recent years in terms of evaluation measures, such as F-score or labeled
accuracy. At the same time, a range of different syntactic representations have been put to use in treebank
annotation projects and there have been studies measuring various aspects of the ”learnability” of these
representations and their suitability for automatic parsing, mostly also evaluated in terms of intrinsic
measures.

In this talk I will provide a different perspective on these developments and give an overview of re-
search that examines the usefulness of syntactic analysis in downstream applications. The talk will dis-
cuss both constituency-based and dependency-based representations, with a focus on various flavours of
dependency-based representations, ranging from purely syntactic representations to more semantically
oriented representations. The recently completed shared task on Extrinsic Parser Evaluation was aimed
at assessing the utility of different types of dependency representations for downstream applications and
I will discuss some of our findings based on the results from this task as well as follow-up experiments
and analysis.
