Abstract

We describe a first attempt at using techniques
from computational linguistics to analyze the
undeciphered proto-Elamite script. Using hi-
erarchical clustering, n-gram frequencies, and
LDA topic models, we both replicate results
obtained by manual decipherment and reveal
previously-unobserved relationships between
signs. This demonstrates the utility of these
techniques as an aid to manual decipherment.

1 Introduction

In the late 19th century, excavations at the an-
cient city of Susa in southwestern Iran began to
uncover clay tablets written in an unknown script
later dubbed ‘proto-Elamite’. Over 1,500 tablets
have since been found at Susa, and a few hun-
dred more at sites across Iran, making it the most
widespread writing system of the late 4th and early
3rd millennia BC (circa 3100–2900 BC) and the
largest corpus of ancient material in an undeci-
phered script.1

Proto-Elamite (PE) is the conventional designa-
tion of this script, whose language remains un-
known but was presumed by early researchers as
likely to be an early form of Elamite. A number of
features of the PE writing system are understood.
These include tablet format and direction of writ-
ing, the numeric systems, and the ideographic as-
sociations of some non-numeric signs, predomi-
nantly those for livestock accounting, agricultural
production, and possibly labor administration. Yet

1New PE texts have been found as recently as 2006–2007,
when excavations at Tepe Sofalin near Tehran uncovered ten
tablets (Dahl et al., 2012).

the significance of the majority of PE signs, the
nature of those signs (syllabic, logographic, ideo-
graphic, or other) and the linguistic context(s) of
the texts remain unknown. It was recognized from
the outset, due to the features of the script, that
all the proto-Elamite tablets were administrative
records, rather than historical or literary composi-
tions (Scheil, 1905).

Texts are written in lines from right to left,
but are rotated in publication to be read from top
to bottom (then left to right) following academic
practice for publishing the contemporary proto-
cuneiform tablets. The content of a text is divided
into entries, logical units which may span more
than one physical line. The entry itself is a string
of non-numeric signs whose meanings are for the
most part undeciphered. Each entry is followed by
a numeric notation in one of several different nu-
meric systems, which quantifies something in re-
lation to the preceding entry. This serves to mark
the division between entries. An important ex-
ception exists in what are currently understood to
be ‘header’ entries: these can present information
that appears to pertain to the text as a whole, and
are followed directly by the text’s first content en-
try with no intervening numeric notation. A digital
image and line drawing of a simple PE text along
with transliteration are shown in Figure 1.

Although a complete digital corpus of PE texts
exists (Section 2), it has not been studied using
the standard toolkit of data exploration techniques
from computational linguistics. The goals of this
paper are threefold. By applying a variety of com-
putational tools, we hope to

i. promote interest in and awareness of the prob-
lems surrounding PE decipherment

ii. demonstrate the effectiveness of computa-
tional approaches by reproducing results pre-
viously obtained by manual decipherment

iii. highlight novel patterns in the data which may
inform future decipherment attempts

We hope to show that interesting data may be ex-
tracted from the corpus even in the absence of a
complete linguistic decipherment. To encourage
further study in this vein, we are also releasing
all data and code used in this work as part of an
online suite of data exploration tools for PE.2 Ad-
ditional figures and interactive visualizations are
also available as part of this toolkit.

2 Conventional Decipherment Efforts

Studies towards the decipherment of PE can be
summarised by a relatively short bibliography
of serious efforts (Englund, 1996).3 Stumbling
blocks to decipherment have included inaccura-
cies in published hand-copies of the texts, a lack
of access to high-quality original images, and
the associated difficulty in drawing up an accu-
rate signlist and producing a consistently-rendered
full transcription of the corpus. Members of
the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI)
have been remedying these deficiencies over the

past two decades, and the PE script can now
boast (i) a working signlist with a consistent man-
ner of transcribing signs in ASCII, and (ii) an
open-access, searchable database hosting the en-
tire corpus in transcription, alongside digital im-
ages and/or hand-copies of almost every text.4

Historically, specialists of PE have operated on
a working hypothesis that it may be, like later
Sumerian cuneiform, to some extent a mixed sys-
tem of ideographic or logographic signs alongside
signs that may represent syllables. However, the
level of linguistic content represented in both PE
and proto-cuneiform has been called into question
(Damerow, 2006), and the presence of a set of syl-
labic signs in PE is yet to be proven.

The strict linear organisation of signs in PE
is the earliest such known to a writing system:
proto-cuneiform arranged signs in various ways
within cases (and sometimes subcases), and only
in cuneiform from several hundred years later did
scribes begin to consistently write in lines with one
sign following the next. However, it is not clear to
what extent the linear sign organization of PE re-
flects the flow of spoken language as in later writ-
ing systems.5

Analysis of sign and entry ordering in the texts
has also revealed some tabular-like organising
principles familiar from proto-cuneiform. Longer
sequences of signs can often be broken down into
constituent parts appearing to follow hierarchical
ordering patterns apparently based upon adminis-
trative (rather than phonetic/linguistic) principles,
and hierarchies can be seen across entries as well
(Hawkins, 2015; Dahl et al., 2018).

Traditional linguistic decipherment efforts have
not yet succeeded in identifying a linguistic con-
text for PE, though progress has been made, for
example in positing sets of syllabo-logographic
signs thought to be used to write personal names
(PNs). We refer to Meriggi’s (1971:173–174) syl-
labary as shorthand for these signs, as he was
the first to identify such a set and his work has
since been closely imitated (Desset 2016; Dahl
2019:85). Although he called it a syllabary,
Meriggi was aware that the signs might not prove
to be syllabic and that object or other signs might
remain mixed in.

Continued efforts to establish the organizational
principles of the PE script and to isolate possible
syllable sequences or PNs may be advanced by
computational techniques, which can be used to
evaluate hypotheses much faster than purely man-
ual approaches. In this endeavour it is necessary
to remember that although early writing encodes
meaningful information, that information may or
may not be linguistic (Damerow, 2006). Although
it is not known why PE disappeared after a rel-
atively short period of use, one of several possi-
bilities is that this relates to the way it represents
information, perhaps providing a poorer, less ver-
satile encoding compared to later cuneiform with
its mixed syllabo-logography.

3 Data

All data in this work are based on the PE cor-
pus provided by the CDLI. After removing tablets
which only bear unreadable or numeric signs, this
dataset comprises 1399 distinct texts. Most of
these are very short: the mean text length is 27
readable signs, of which only 10 are non-numeric
on average. Long texts do exist, however, up to a
maximum length of 724 readable signs of which
198 are non-numeric.

Our working signlist (extracted from the tran-

in-line structure that is more prone to language coding than
proto-cuneiform...”

scribed texts) contains 49 numeric signs and 1623
non-numeric signs. Of these, 287 are ‘basic’
signs, and 1087 are labeled as variants due to mi-
nor graphical differences. Sign variants are de-
noted by ∼, as in M006∼b, a variant of the ba-
sic sign M006. In an on-going process, analy-
sis of the corpus aims to confirm whether sign
variants are semantically distinct, or reflect purely
graphical variation. Where the latter case is un-
derstood, the sign is given a numeric rather than
alphabetic subscript, as in M269∼1. The remain-
ing 249 non-numeric signs are compounds called
complex graphemes which are made up of two or
more signs in combination, as in |M136+M365|.

Future work is required to establish which sign
variants are meaningfully distinct from their base
signs; in the absence of such work, we have chosen
to treat all variants as distinct until proven other-
wise. Our models give interpretable results under
this assumption, suggesting this is a reasonable ap-
proach. There are, however, cases where collaps-
ing sign variants together would seem to affect our
results, and we highlight these where relevant.

4 Analysis of Signs

4.1 Hierarchical Sign Clustering

Manual decipherment of PE has proceeded in part
by identifying that some signs occur in largely the
same contexts as other signs. This has produced
groupings of signs into “owners”, “objects”, and
other functionally related sets (Dahl, 2009). For
example, M388 and M124 are known to be par-
allel “overseer” signs which appear in alternation
with one another (Dahl et al., 2018:25).

In the same vein, we have investigated tech-
niques for clustering signs hierarchically based
on the way they occur and co-occur within texts.
Our work considers three approaches to sign clus-
tering: a neighbor-based clustering groups signs
based on the number of times each other sign oc-
curs immediately before or after that sign in the
corpus; an HMM clustering groups signs based
on the emission probabilities of a 10 state hidden
Markov model (HMM) trained on the corpus; and
a generalized Brown clustering groups signs as de-
scribed in Derczynski and Chester 2016. By us-
ing three different clustering techniques, we can
search for clusters which recur across all three
methods to maximize the likelihood of finding
those that are meaningful. This reduces the im-
pact of noise in the data, which is especially useful



125

given the small size of the PE corpus.

4.1.1 Clustering Evaluation
We identified commonalities between our three
clusterings using the following heuristic. Given
a set of signs S, we found for each clustering
the height of the smallest subtree containing ev-
ery sign in S. If all of these subtrees were short
(which we took to mean not larger than 2|S|) then
we called S a stable cluster.

In many cases, the stable clusters comprise vari-
ants of the same sign. This is the case for M157
and M157∼a, which cluster together across all
techniques and are already believed to function
similarly to each other, if not identically.

One very large stable cluster consists of the
signs M057, M066, M096, M218, and M371.
This cluster is shown as it appears in each
clustering in Figure 2. These signs belong to
Meriggi’s proposed syllabary (Meriggi 1971, esp.
pp. 173–4) and are hypothesized to represent
names syllabically (or logographic-syllabically;
Desset 2016:83). Desset (2016:83) likewise iden-
tified “approximately 200 different signs” from
possible anthroponyms, “among which M4, M9,
M66, M96, M218 and M371 must be noticed for
their high frequency.” Desset’s list differs from our
cluster by only two signs, replacing M057 with
M004 and M009. M004 and M009 group with
other members of the putative syllabary in each
clustering, but their position is much more variable
across the three techniques. For M009 at least, this
may indicate multivalent use: besides its inclusion
in hypothesised PNs (e.g. Meriggi 1971:173; Dahl
2019:85), it appears in various different adminis-
trative contexts that don’t appear to include PNs
(e.g P008206) and as an account postscript (see
below here and 5.3).

All three methods group the five signs in our
cluster close to other suspected syllabic signs;
however, since each technique groups them with
a different subset of the syllabary, only these five
form a stable group across all three methods. This
may be due simply to their frequency, or they
could in fact form a distinct subgroup within the
proposed syllabary; future work may yield a better
understanding of possible anthroponyms by trying
to identify other such subgroups.

While this discussion has focused on the sta-
ble clusters for which we can provide some in-
terpretation, others represent groups of signs with
no previously recognised relationship, such as

(a) (b) (c)

Figure 2: Detail of the (a) neighbor-based, (b) HMM,
and (c) Brown clusterings showing signs possibly used
in anthroponyms. M057, M066, M096, M218, and
M371 are considered a stable cluster due to their prox-
imity in all three clusterings.

M003∼b and M263∼a (Figure 3). M003(∼a/b)
are “stick” signs ( , ) understood in some PE
contexts to denote worker categories (Dahl et al.,
2018); they are graphically comparable to proto-
cuneiform PAP∼a-c ( ) and PA ( ), the lat-
ter of which can, in later Sumerian, indicate ugula,
a work group foreman/administrator.

Figure 3: M003∼b clusters identically with M263∼a
in all three techniques.

M263∼a is one of a series of depictions of “ves-
sels” ( ), this particular variant appearing in 27
texts; notably the base sign M263 appears as a
possible element in PNs (Dahl, 2019:85). Inter-
estingly, M003∼b and M263∼a only appear to-
gether in a single text (P008727), one of a closely-
related group of short texts6 that each end in the
administrative postscript M009 M003∼b or M009
M003∼c. It can also be noted that M263∼1 oc-
curs in another text belonging to this small group.

It thus remains for future work to interpret this
and the many other stable clusters resulting from
our work. These additional groupings are detailed
in our data exploration toolkit, along with com-
plete dendrograms for each clustering which are
too large to include in this publication.

Although we have not performed a full study
of the clusterings produced when sign variants
are collapsed together, a preliminary comparison

suggests this is worth pursuing. For instance,
a new cluster of small livestock signs arises in
the neighbor-based clustering, comprising M367
(“billy-goat”), M346 (“sheep”), M006 (“ram”),
and M309 (possible animal byproduct). Existing
clusters, such as the stable cluster of syllabic signs,
appear to remain intact, but a complete compari-
son of the techniques in this setting is warranted.

4.2 Sign Frequency and n-Gram Counts

Sign frequency is another useful datapoint for un-
derstanding the overall content of the corpus and
for building a more nuanced understanding of sign
use (Dahl, 2002; Kelley, 2018). Figure 4 shows
the most common PE unigrams, bigrams, and tri-
grams. These counts exclude n-grams contain-
ing numeric signs or broken or unreadable signs
(transcribed as X or [...]); n-grams which span the
boundary between entries are also excluded. Note
the sharp drop-off in frequency from the most fre-
quent signs to the rest of the signary; in fact nearly
half the attested signs (745 out of 1623) occur only
once. Similar results were presented in Dahl 2002.

The most common unigrams include “object”
signs and signs belonging to Meriggi’s syllabary.
The object signs are M288 (a grain container),
M388 (“person/man”), M124 (a person/worker
category paralleling M388), M054 (a yoke, usu-
ally indicating a person/worker category or ani-
mal), M297 (“bread”), and M346 (“ewe”). The
syllabary signs are M218, M371 (which may dou-
ble as an object sign/worker category), M387 (also
a numeral meaning “100”), and M066.

The n-gram counts reveal the scale at which
complex sequences of information are repeated
across tablets. Over 1600 strings contain at least
3 non-numeric signs. Of these, only 11 trigrams
are repeated at least 5 times across the corpus; two
of these end in the “grain container” sign M288
and are therefore best parsed as undeciphered bi-
grams followed by an object sign. Following
this, 52 other trigrams are repeated three or four
times across the corpus, leaving the great majority
(98%) of trigrams to appear only once or twice.7

The most frequent trigram, M377∼e M347 M371
(found 17 times per Figure 4), appears in no more
than about 1.5% of the texts. Even among bi-

7This assumes that sign variants are meaningfully distinct,
as is the working hypothesis among PE specialists. Collaps-
ing variants together does not appreciably change these re-
sults, however, as it only increases most trigram counts by 1
or 2 instances. A similar result holds for bigram counts.

grams, the most common can only occur in up to
3.2% of texts.

External comparisons may help determine
whether this is a meaningful degree of repeti-
tion, but such comparisons are not straightforward.
Third millennium Sumerian or Akkadian account-
ing tablets are reasonable corpora to compare
against, but these are available only in transliter-
ation (using sign readings) while PE is transcribed
(using sign names). This distinction makes n-
gram counts from the two corpora incomparable
without further work to transform the data.

Despite this, an impressionistic assessment of
Ur III Sumerian administrative texts suggests
that they are highly repetitious: information of
wide importance to the administration (e.g. ba-
sic nouns, phrases describing administrative func-
tions, month names, ruler names, etc.) occurs fre-
quently. If one expects a similar pattern in the PE
administrative record, our initial analysis suggests
that trigrams (and perhaps bigrams) may not be a
significant tactic for encoding these types of infor-
mation, although unigrams might.

An n-gram analysis can also be used to be-



127

gin exploring the frequency of suspected anthro-
ponyms within the PE corpus. Dahl (2019:85)
lists frequently-attested signs (10 instances or
more) with “proposed syllabic values” obtained
through traditional graphotactical analysis; Fig-
ure 5 presents the frequency of the most com-
mon bigrams and trigrams limited to this signset.
This list fails to include what is thought to be
the most commonly attested PN, M377∼e M347
M371 mentioned above, since the middle sign,
M347, is uncommon. Nonetheless the strings in
this figure are more representative of possible PNs,
since object signs which are understood to encode
separate units of information have been weeded
out. Overall we see that a small handful of 3-sign
PNs are repeated at least 4 times across the corpus,
but the majority appear 3 times or less. 2-sign PNs
might be more frequent,8 although some of the
bigrams in the figure simply represent substrings
from the trigrams. The ten most common bigrams
all appear 13 or more times across the corpus, and
the most frequent alone appears 45 times (M004
M218, including as part of a common trigram in
Figure 5, accounting for 11 of its uses).

appears more than once. This low level of repe-
tition indicates that common frequency-based lin-
guistic decipherment methods may be ineffective
on this corpus. We can, however, identify repeated
strings which are similar to one another, if not ex-
act copies, which may lead to insights about the
function of certain PE signs and sign sequences.
For example, the only two 6-grams which occur
multiple times in the corpus differ from one an-
other by only a single sign:

M305 M388 M240 M097∼h M004 M218
M305 M388 M146 M097∼h M004 M218

A further variant appears once in the corpus:

M305 M388 M347 M097∼h M004 M218

Traditional graphotactical analysis parses the first
of these strings as follows:

• Institution, household, or person class: M305
• Person class: M388
• Further designations of the individual: M240

M097∼h M004 M218
Side-by-side comparison of these 6-grams

raises the question of whether the third sign in
each sequence (M240, M146, and M347 respec-
tively) is yet another classifier preceding a stable
PN M097∼h M004 M218, or may reflect a PN
pattern in which the first element (perhaps a lo-
gogram?) can alternate.

Although there are no repeated 7-grams or 8-
grams, there are three pairs of 7-grams which dif-
fer by only a single sign, and one such pair of
8-grams. We hope that by exploring sign usage
within such strings, future work will be able to
identify new sign ordering principles and possibly
reach a more controlled set of signs that may rep-
resent anthroponyms. Such a list would offer a
better (if still slim) chance at linguistic decipher-
ment. Our data exploration toolkit provides an in-
terface for fuzzy string matching to facilitate fur-
ther investigation of strings like these.

5 LDA Topic Model

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al. 2003)
is a topic modeling algorithm which attempts to
group related words into topics and determine
which topics are discussed in a given set of doc-
uments. Notably, LDA infers topical relationships
solely based on rates of term co-occurrence, mean-
ing it can run on undeciphered texts to yield infor-
mation on which terms may be related. Note, how-
ever, that topics may be semantically broad, and

one must be careful not to infer too much about
a sign’s meaning simply from its appearance in a
given topic. LDA differs from the other clustering
techniques we have considered in that it also pro-
vides a means for grouping tablets based on the
topics they discuss, which may reveal genres or
other meaningful divisions of the corpus.

We induced a 10-topic LDA model over the PE
corpus. We chose a small number of topics to
make the task of interpreting the model more man-
ageable; fewer topics make for fewer sets of rep-
resentative signs to analyze. Furthermore, with 10
topics the model learns topics which are mostly
non-overlapping (Figure 6), meaning there are few
redundant topics to sort through. We note, how-
ever, that model perplexity drops sharply above 80
topics, and topic coherence peaks around 110 top-
ics; future work may therefore do well to investi-
gate larger models.

Figure 6: Intertopic distance (measured as Jensen-
Shannon divergence) visualized with LDAVis (Siev-
ert and Shirley, 2014) using two principal components
(PC1 and PC2). Larger circles represent more common
topics.

The following sections begin to elaborate on
the topics which we can most easily interpret, al-
though space constraints prohibit full analysis of
each individual topic. Our data exploration toolkit
provides additional details including information
about topic stability using the stability measure in-
troduced by Mäntylä et al. (2018).

5.1 Topic 1

The most representative signs for this topic are
M376 and M056∼f. M376 has been speculated

to represent either a human worker category or
cattle; M056∼f is a depiction of a plow ( ,
comparable to the proto-cuneiform sign for plow,
APIN ). This is an intriguing connection as
a sign-set for bovines has not yet been identified
in PE, despite the clear cultural importance of cat-
tle suggested by PE cylinder seal depictions (Dahl,
2016). More interesting still is the fact that M376
and M056∼f never occur in the same text. Their
inclusion in the same topic implies that they sim-
ply occur in the presence of similar signs (though
not as direct neighbors of those signs, since they
do not group together in the neighbor-based clus-
tering). Topic modelling in this case has brought
to light tendencies in the writing system that may
have been intuitively grasped but would be diffi-
cult to quantify manually.

5.2 Topic 3
The signs M297∼b and M297 are both highly rep-
resentative of this topic. This is interesting as the
relationship between these two signs has been un-
certain (Meriggi, 1971:74). M297∼b was hypoth-
esised to indicate a “keg” by Friberg (1978). It is
an “object” sign that almost always appears in the
ultimate or penultimate position of sign strings;
it sometimes appears in the summary line of ac-
counts followed by numerical notations that quan-
tify amounts of grain or liquids. Friberg sus-
pected such texts referred to ale distributions. Ale
is thought to have been a staple of the PE diet
at Susa. Meriggi suggested M297 may indicate
“bread”, but he also included it in his syllabary; it
is the 6th most common sign in PE, appearing in
145 texts, and M297∼b is the 31st most common
appearing in 66 texts. Yet topic 3 is the dominant
topic in only 85 texts, suggesting that the LDA
model has identified a particular subset of the ac-
counts that refer to M297 or M297∼b. Also of
note is the fact that M297∼b occurs in topic 3 at
a significantly higher rate than M297, despite be-
ing rarer in general—a much higher percentage of
the overall uses of M297∼b appear in this topic
(around 75%) than do the overall uses of M297
(less than 15%).

5.3 Topics 4 and 7
The texts included in topics 4 and 7 success-
fully reproduce aspects of Dahl 2005 with ref-
erence to the genres of PE livestock husbandry
and slaughter texts. Dahl was able to decipher
the ideographic meaning (if not phonetic realiza-

tion) of signs for female, male, young, and ma-
ture sheep and goats and some of their products,
beginning with the key observation that proto-
cunieform UDU ( , “mixed sheep and goats”) is
graphically comparable to M346 ( ). The most
representative signs in topic 4 are M346 (“ewe”)
and M367 (“billy-goat”).

While almost every instance of M346 is repre-
sentative of topic 4, it is assigned to topic 5 in the
atypical text P272825 (see 5.4). Several other typ-
ical livestock context uses of M346 belong to topic
7. Topic 7 was the most stable topic across 30 re-
peated runs in our topic stability evaluation. The
most predictive sign for this topic is M009 ( ),
which is also representative of topic 4 (and ap-
peared in Section 4.1.1). The most representative
texts in this topic include a few nanny-goat herd-
ing texts; many more texts in this topic have no
known association with livestock or animal prod-
ucts, though a few (e.g. P009141 and P008407) do
bear seal impressions depicting livestock.

5.4 Topic 5
The reason that the LDA model groups these 144
texts is not immediately apparent to the traditional
PE specialist. An odd feature of the topic is that
M388 (“person/man”) is considered the most rep-
resentative sign, but the most representative text is
a simple tally of equids that never uses M388, and
in fact uses few non-numerical signs overall. This
may be due simply to noise in the model: M388
may be a kind of “stopword” which crops up in un-
related topics due to its high frequency. That said,
an intriguing feature is that a significantly larger
proportion of the texts in this topic bear a seal im-
pression than do texts in the other topics. Seal
impressions are unknown to the LDA model, and
their presence suggests that it is at least possible
the model has identified similarities in tablet con-
tent not easily observed through traditional anal-
ysis. The atypical “elite redistributive account”
(Kelley, 2018:163) P272825, which is also sealed,
is associated with this topic. This text has around
116 entries using complex sign-strings, fifteen of
which include M388.

5.5 Topic 6
The ten most representative signs for topic 6 in-
clude the five of Meriggi’s possible syllabic signs
that grouped most stably in our clustering eval-
uation (see 4.1.1). Nine of the ten are also
included in Meriggi’s syllabary, excluding only

M388, the second most representative sign in the
topic. M388 has been key to the identification of
possible PNs, since it tends to appear just before
longer sign strings and, through a series of argu-
ments drawing on cuneiform parallels, may func-
tion as a Personenkeil (a marker for human names;
Damerow and Englund 1989; Kelley 2018:222
ff.). The texts of topic 6 are of diverse size and
structure, but do tend to include many tradition-
ally identifiable PNs.

5.6 Topic 10

This topic also confirms existing understanding of
a PE administrative genre, namely that of “labor
administration” (Damerow and Englund, 1989;
Nissen et al., 1994). The most representative signs
are the characteristic “worker category signs” de-
scribed in the very long ration texts discussed by
Dahl et al. (2018:24–23), and indeed all of those
texts appear in this topic, in addition to a variety
of other identifiable labor texts of somewhat dif-
ferent (but partially overlapping) content.

5.7 Remaining Topics (2, 8, and 9)

Initial assessments also suggest promising av-
enues of analysis for topics 2, 8, and 9. Topic
2 is heavily skewed towards M288 (“grain con-
tainer”), the most common PE sign;9 its third
most representative sign (M391, possibly mean-
ing “field”) may suggest an agricultural manage-
ment context for some texts in this topic. Topic
8 is strongly represented by |M195+M057|. This
is an undeciphered complex grapheme, frequently
occurring as a text’s second sign after the “header”
M157. In topic 9, the two most representative
signs are M387 and M036 (possibly associated
with rationing). Since the LDA model is not aware
of the numeric notation between entries, it is inter-
esting that the bisexagesimal numeric systems B#
and B appear prominently in this topic, whether or
not M036 (associated with those systems) appears:
see particularly P009048 (the text most strongly
associated with this topic) and P008619.

5.8 LDA Summary

The preceding sections confirm that the LDA
model largely learns topics which traditional PE

9A remarkable 37.3% of the topic’s probability mass is
allocated to this sign, compared to just 2.5% for the second
most predictive sign (M157, the “household” header sign).
No other topic is so skewed: only topic 4 comes close, with
20.3% of its mass assigned to M346 (“sheep”).



130

specialists recognise as meaningful. Our brief in-
terpretations of the topics serve only to highlight
the amount of potentially fruitful analysis that still
remains to be done. It also remains to see what
topics arise when sign variants are collapsed to-
gether: preliminary results suggest that topics re-
sembling our topic 6 and topic 10 are still found,
but new topics also appear which have no clear
correlates in the model discussed in this paper.

6 Related Work

Meriggi (1971:173–174) conducted manual
graphotactic analysis of PE (and later linear
Elamite) texts, for example by noting the po-
sitions in which certain signs could appear in
sign-strings. Dahl (2002) was the first to use
basic computer-assisted data sorting to present
information on sign frequencies, and Englund
(2004:129–138) concluded his discussion of “the
state of decipherment” by suggesting that the
newly transliterated corpus would benefit from
more intensive study of sign ordering phenomena.
Apart from the use of Rapidminer10 to perform
simple data sorting in Kelley 2018, no publi-
cations have yet described any effort to apply
computational approaches to the dataset.

Computational approaches to decipherment
(Knight and Yamada, 1999; Knight et al., 2006),
which resemble the setup typically followed
by human archaeological-decipherment experts
(Robinson, 2009), have been useful in several real
world tasks. Snyder et al. (2010) propose an au-
tomatic decipherment technique that further im-
proves existing methods by incorporating cognate
identification and lexicon induction. When ap-
plied to Ugaritic, the model is able to correctly
map 29 of 30 letters to their Hebrew counter-
parts. Reddy and Knight (2011) study the Voynich
manuscript for its linguistic properties, and show
that the letter sequences are generally more pre-
dictable than in natural languages. Following this,
Hauer and Kondrak (2016) treat the text in the
Voynich manuscript as anagrammed substitution
ciphers, and their experiments suggest, arguably,
that Hebrew is the language of the document. Hi-
erarchical clustering has previously been used by
Knight et al. (2011) to aid in the decipherment of
the Copiale cipher, where it was able to identify
meaningful groups such as word boundary mark-
ers as well as signs which correspond to the same

10https://www.rapidminer.com/

plaintext symbol.

Homburg and Chiarcos (2016) report prelim-
inary results on automatic word segmentation
for Akkadian cuneiform using rule-based, dictio-
nary based, and data-driven statistical techniques.
Pagé-Perron et al. (2017) furnish an analysis of
Sumerian text including morphology, parts-of-
speech (POS) tagging, syntactic parsing, and ma-
chine translation using a parallel corpus. Although
Sumerian and Akkadian are both geographically
and chronologically close to PE, these corpora
are very large (e.g. 1.5 million lines for Sume-
rian), and are presented in word level translitera-
tions rather than sign-by-sign transcriptions. This
makes most of these techniques inapplicable to
PE. Our study is more similar in spirit to Reddy
and Knight (2011), as the Voynich manuscript and
PE are both undeciphered and resource-poor, mak-
ing analysis especially difficult.

7 Conclusions

We have shown that methods from computational
linguistics can offer valuable insights into the
proto-Elamite script, and can substantially im-
prove the toolkit available to the PE specialist. Hi-
erarchical sign clustering replicates previous work
by rediscovering meaningful groups of signs, and
suggests avenues for future work by revealing sim-
ilarities between yet-undeciphered signs. Analysis
of n-gram frequencies highlights the level of rep-
etition of sign strings across the corpus as a point
of further research interest, and also reveals sets
of similar strings worth examining in detail. LDA
topic modelling has replicated previous work in
identifying known text genres, but has also sug-
gested new relationships between tablets which
can be explored using more traditional analysis.
The methods we have used are by no means ex-
haustive, and there remain many more approaches
to consider in future work. Particularly in a field
populated by a small handful of researchers, the
faster data processing and ease of visualization of-
fered by computational methods may significantly
aid progress towards understanding this writing
system. We hope that our data exploration tools
will help facilitate future discoveries, which may
eventually lead to a more complete decipherment
of the largest undeciphered corpus from the an-
cient world.
