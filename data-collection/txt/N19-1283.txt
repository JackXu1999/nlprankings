Abstract

Conversational context information, higher-
level knowledge that spans across sentences,
can help to recognize a long conversation.
However, existing speech recognition models
are typically built at a sentence level, and thus
it may not capture important conversational
context information. The recent progress in
end-to-end speech recognition enables inte-
grating context with other available informa-
tion (e.g., acoustic, linguistic resources) and
directly recognizing words from speech. In
this work, we present a direct acoustic-to-
word, end-to-end speech recognition model
capable of utilizing the conversational context
to better process long conversations. We eval-
uate our proposed approach on the Switch-
board conversational speech corpus and show
that our system outperforms a standard end-to-
end speech recognition system.

1 Introduction

Many real-world speech recognition applications,
including teleconferencing, and AI assistants, re-
quire recognizing and understand long conversa-
tions. In a long conversation, there exists the ten-
dency of semantically related words or phrases re-
occur across sentences, or there exists topical co-
herence. Thus, such conversational context infor-
mation, higher-level knowledge that spans across
sentences, provides important information that can
improve speech recognition. However, the long
conversations typically split into short sentence-
level audios to make building speech recognition
models computationally feasible in current state-
of-the-art recognition systems (Xiong et al., 2017;
Saon et al., 2017).

Over the years, there have been many studies
have attempted to inject a longer context infor-
mation into language models. Based on a re-
current neural network (RNNs) language models

(Mikolov et al., 2010), (Mikolov and Zweig, 2012;
Wang and Cho, 2015; Ji et al., 2015; Liu and Lane,
2017; Xiong et al., 2018), proposed using a con-
text vector that would encode the longer context
information as an additional network input. How-
ever, all of these models have been developed on
text data, and therefore, it must still be integrated
with a conventional acoustic model which is built
separately without a longer context information,
for speech recognition on long conversations.

Recently, new approaches to speech recogni-
tion models integrate all available information
(e.g. acoustic, linguistic resources) in a so-called
end-to-end manner proposed in (Graves et al.,
2006; Graves and Jaitly, 2014; Hannun et al.,
2014; Miao et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2014;
Chorowski et al., 2014, 2015; Chan et al., 2015;
Kim et al., 2017). In these approaches, a single
neural network is trained to recognize graphemes
or even words from speech directly. Especially,
the model using semantically meaningful units,
such as words or sub-word (Sennrich et al., 2015),
rather than graphemes have been showing promis-
ing results (Audhkhasi et al., 2017b; Li et al.,
2018; Soltau et al., 2016; Zenkel et al., 2017;
Palaskar and Metze, 2018; Sanabria and Metze,
2018; Rao et al., 2017; Zeyer et al., 2018).

In this work, motivated by such property of
the end-to-end speech recognition approaches, we
propose to integrate conversational context infor-
mation within a direct acoustic-to-word, end-to-
end speech recognition to better process long con-
versations. Thus far, the research in speech recog-
nition systems has focused on recognizing sen-
tences and to the best of our knowledge, there have
been no studies of word-based models incorpo-
rating conversational context information. There
has been recent work attempted to use the conver-
sational context information from the preceding
graphemes (Kim and Metze, 2018), however, it is



2767

limited to encode semantically meaningful context
representation. Another recent work attempted to
use a context information (Pundak et al., 2018),
however, their method requires a list of phrases at
inference (i.e. personalized contact list). We eval-
uate our proposed approach on the Switchboard
conversational speech corpus (Godfrey and Hol-
liman, 1993; Godfrey et al., 1992), and show that
our model outperforms the sentence-level end-to-
end speech recognition model.

2 Models

2.1 Acoustic-to-Words Models

We perform end-to-end speech recognition us-
ing a joint CTC/Attention-based approach (Kim
et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2017). The neural
network is trained by both CTC (Graves et al.,
2006) and Attention-based sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq) objectives (Bahdanau et al., 2014) to
combine the strength of the two. With CTC, it
preserves left-right order between input and out-
put and with attention-based seq2seq, it learns the
language model jointly without relying on the con-
ditional independence assumption.

As an output, we use word-level symbols which
generated from the bite-pair encoding (BPE) algo-
rithm (Sennrich et al., 2015). This method creates
the target units based on the frequency of occur-
rence in training sets. Similar to (Zeyer et al.,
2018; Palaskar and Metze, 2018; Sanabria and
Metze, 2018), we use BPE-10k which contains
roughly 10k units (9,838), including 7,119 words
and 2719 sub-words.

2.2 Conversational Context Representation

In order to use conversational context information
within the end-to-end speech recognition frame-
work, we extend the decoder sub-network to pre-
dict the output additionally conditioning on con-
versational context. To do so, we encode the pre-
ceding sentence into a single vector, a conversa-
tional context vector, then inject to decoder net-
work as an additional input at every output step.

Let we have K sentences in a conversation. For
k-th sentence, sk, we have T k-length input acous-
tic feature (xk) and Uk-length output words. Our
proposed decoder generates the probability distri-
bution over words ( yku), conditioned on 1) high-
level representation (hk) of input (xk) generated
from encoder, and 2) all the words seen previously
(yk1:u−1), and 3) previous decoder state (d

k
u−1) 4)

Figure 1: The architecture of our end-to-end speech
recognition model with conversational context infor-
mation. The ck−1 is the conversational context vec-
tor generated from the preceding k − 1 sentence red
curved dashed line represents the context information
flow within the same conversation.

additionally conditioning on conversational con-
text vector (ck−1), which represents the informa-
tion of the preceding sentence (k − 1):

hk =Encoder(xk) (1)

yku ∼Decoder(hk, yk1:u−1, dku−1, ck−1) (2)

We represent the context vector, ck−1, from
the preceding sentence in two different ways: (a)
mean of word embedding, and (b) attentional word
embedding. We first generate one-hot word vec-
tors, and then we simply take the mean over word
vectors to obtain a single vector in method (a), or
we use attention mechanism over word vectors to
obtain the weight over the words and then per-
form the weighted-sum. The parameter of the at-
tention mechanism is optimized towards minimiz-
ing the conversation ID classification error similar
to (Kim and Metze, 2018). The context vector is
merged with a decoder state at every output step
as follows:

d̂ku−1 = tanh(Wd
k
u−1 + V c

k−1 + b) (3)

yku ∼ softmax(LSTM(d̂ku−1,hku, yk1:u−1)))
(4)

where W,V, b are trainable parameters.
In order to learn and use the conversational-

context during training and decoding, we serialize
the sentences based on their onset times and their



2768

conversations rather than the random shuffling of
data. We shuffle data at the conversation level and
create mini-batches that contain only one sentence
of each conversation.

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets

We investigated the performance of the proposed
model on the Switchboard LDC corpus (97S62)
which has a 300 hours training set. We split the
Switchboard data into two groups, then used 285
hours of data (192 thousand sentences) for model
training and 5 hours of data (4 thousand sentences)
for hyper-parameter tuning. The evaluation was
carried out on the HUB5 Eval 2000 LDC cor-
pora (LDC2002S09, LDC2002T43), which have
3.8 hours of data (4.4 thousand sentences), and
we show separate results for the Callhome En-
glish (CH) and Switchboard (SWB) evaluation
sets. We denote train nodup, train dev, SWB, and
CH as our training, development, and two eval-
uation datasets for CH and SWB, respectively.
There are 2,402 conversations in training sets and
20 conversations in CH, and 20 conversations in
SWB.

We sampled all audio data at 16kHz, and ex-
tracted 80-dimensional log-mel filterbank coef-
ficients with 3-dimensional pitch features, from
25 ms frames with a 10ms frame shift. We used
83-dimensional feature vectors to input to the net-
work in total. We used 9,840 distinct labels:
9,838 word-level BPE units, start-of-speech/end-
of-speech, and blank tokens. Note that no pronun-
ciation lexicon was used in any of the experiments.

3.2 Training and decoding

We used joint CTC/Attention end-to-end speech
recognition architecture (Kim et al., 2017; Watan-
abe et al., 2017) with ESPnet toolkit (Watanabe
et al., 2018). We used a CNN-BLSTM encoder
as suggested in (Zhang et al., 2017; Hori et al.,
2017). We followed the same six-layer CNN ar-
chitecture as the prior study, except we used one
input channel instead of three since we did not use
delta or delta delta features. Input speech features
were downsampled to (1/4 x 1/4) along with the
time-frequency axis. Then, the 6-layer BLSTM
with 320 cells was followed by CNN. We used
a location-based attention mechanism (Chorowski
et al., 2015), where 10 centered convolution fil-
ters of width 100 were used to extract the convo-

lutional features.
The decoder network of both our proposed

models and the baseline models was a 2-layer
LSTM with 300 cells. Our proposed models ad-
ditionally require linear projection layer in order
to encode the conversational context vector and
merge with decoder states.

We also built an external RNN-based language
model (RNNLM) on the same BPE-10k sets on the
same Switchboard transcriptions. The RNNLM
network architecture was a two-layer LSTM with
650 cells. This network was used only for decod-
ing.

The AdaDelta algorithm (Zeiler, 2012) with
gradient clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) was used
for optimization. We used λ = 0.5 for joint
CTC/Attention training. We bootstrap the train-
ing our proposed conversational end-to-end mod-
els from the baseline end-to-end models. When
we decode with RNNLM, we used joint decoder
which combines the output label scores from the
AttentionDecoder, CTC, and RNNLM by using
shallow fusion (Hori et al., 2017):

y∗ = argmax{ log patt(y|x)
+ α log patt(y|x)
+ β log prnnlm(y)}

(5)

The scaling factor of CTC, and RNNLM scores
were α = 0.3, and β = 0.3, respectively. We
used a beam search algorithm similar to (Sutskever
et al., 2014) with the beam size 10 to reduce the
computation cost. We adjusted the score by adding
a length penalty, since the model has a small bias
for shorter utterances. The final score s(y|x) is
normalized with a length penalty 0.5.

The models were implemented by using the Py-
Torch deep learning library (Paszke et al., 2017),
and ESPnet toolkit (Kim et al., 2017; Watanabe
et al., 2017, 2018).

4 Results

We evaluated both the end-to-end speech recogni-
tion model which was built on sentence-level data
and our proposed end-to-end speech recognition
model which leveraged conversational context in-
formation.

Table 1 shows the WER of our baseline, pro-
posed models, and several other published results
those were only trained on 300 hours Switchboard
training data. As shown in Table 1, we obtained
a performance gain over our baseline by using the

conversational context information. Our proposed
model (a) mean shows 4.1% and 2.4% relative
improvement over our baseline on SWB and CH
evaluation set, respectively. Our proposed model
(b) att shows 3.5% and 1.7% relative improve-
ment over our baseline on SWB and CH evaluation
set, respectively. We also found that we can ob-
tain further accuracy improvement by pre-training
the decoder part only with transcription. With this
pre-training technique, the (b) att shows 5.9% and
2.7% relative improvement. Unlike the previous
work (Renduchintala et al., 2018), we did not use
any additional encoder for the text data.

We also build the language model with or with-
out the conversational context information. Table
2 shows the perplexity on a held-out set of our
baseline LM and our conversational LM. We ob-
served that incorporating the conversational con-
text improves performance showing that 9.6%
and 11.7% relative improvement on SWBD only
and SWBD + Fisher. Note that the Fisher
(LDC2004T19) parts (Cieri et al., 2004) of tran-
scriptions is only used in these experiments.

We performed analyses in order to verify the
conversational vector helps to improve recognition

accuracy. We generate the context vector from an
oracle preceding sentence and a random sentence,
in addition to our predicted sentence. As described
in Figure 2, the model using the oracle context per-
formed best and the model using the random con-
text was even worse than the baseline. Our model
outperformed over the baseline and the model us-
ing the random context, we can conclude that the
benefit from our proposed method is coming from
the conversational context information.

5 Conclusion

We proposed an acoustic-to-word model capable
of utilizing the conversational context to better
process long conversations. A key aspect of our
model is that the whole system can be trained with
conversational context information in an end-to-



2770

end framework. Our model was shown to out-
perform previous end-to-end speech recognition
models trained on isolated utterances by incorpo-
rating preceding conversational context represen-
tations.
