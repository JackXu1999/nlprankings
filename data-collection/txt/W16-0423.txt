Abstract

Emotional language of human individuals has
been studied for quite a while dealing with
opinions and value judgments people have and
share with others. In our work, we take a
different stance and investigate whether large
organizations, such as major industrial play-
ers, have and communicate emotions, as well.
Such an anthropomorphic perspective has re-
cently been advocated in management and or-
ganization studies which consider organiza-
tions as social actors. We studied this assump-
tion by analyzing 1,676 annual business and
sustainability reports from 90 top-performing
enterprises in the United States, Great Britain
and Germany. We compared the measure-
ments of emotions in this homogeneous cor-
porate text corpus with those from RCV1,
a heterogeneous Reuters newswire corpus.
From this, we gathered empirical evidence
that business reports compare well with typ-
ical emotion-neutral economic news, whereas
sustainability reports are much more emotion-
ally loaded, similar to emotion-heavy sports
and fashion news from Reuters. Furthermore,
our data suggest that these emotions are dis-
tinctive and relatively stable over time per or-
ganization, thus constituting an emotional pro-
file for enterprises.

1 Introduction

In the past years, we have witnessed an enormous
upsurge of research activities in the field of NLP re-
lated to affective language use in social networks.

This work has mostly focused on subjective, often
evaluative language of individual or informal ad-
hoc groups of human actors in a multitude of social
media platforms (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2015).
Overall, this research analyzes language about or-
ganizations (e.g., opinions about the products they
offer) rather than the language of organizations.

Quite recently, some areas of management and or-
ganization studies started modeling formal organi-
zations in an anthropomorphic way, as social actors
with human-like traits (King et al., 2010). Manage-
ment and organization researchers following this ap-
proach claim that organizations have their own, per-
sistent, human-like identity, play social roles and as-
sume responsibility for their doings in the societies
they are embedded in (Whetten, 2006). One of the
far-reaching implications of granting organizations
the status of social actors is, by default, their un-
equivocal submission to juridical standards as legal
entities liable for violations of law in the same way
as individual citizens are.

It is exactly this shift in the modeling of orga-
nizations (and thus business corporations, such as
large enterprises) as social actors, which led us to
our research questions. Within the new paradigm
of computational social science (DiMaggio, 2015),
we investigate whether organizations can also be
attributed behavioral traits and properties typically
associated with humans, such as attitudes, affects,
emotions, etc.—a question which is, to the best of
our knowledge, so far untackled despite its theoreti-
cal and empirical relevance (King et al., 2010).

2 Related Work

Subjectivity analysis is typically used as an umbrella
term for NLP approaches concerned with all sorts of
affective language use in which speakers’ emotions
play a crucial role. The most widespread subtask of
subjectivity analysis is sentiment analysis or opinion
mining (both terms are used interchangeably) (Pang
and Lee, 2008). Most often, sentiment refers to the
semantic orientation (or polarity), the positiveness
or negativeness, of a sentence or a document. More
recently, another subtask has attracted a lot of at-
tention, namely emotion detection. Unlike (bipolar)
sentiments, emotion describes a much more complex
type of affective state typically associated with phe-
nomena such as sadness, fear or joy. Yet its exact
definition and distinction from other affective phe-
nomena is an open issue (Munezero et al., 2014).

The more complex nature of emotion implies
that both subtasks—sentiment analysis and emotion
detection—need distinct analytic resources, espe-
cially lexicons. The number of general-language
sentiment lexicons is, compared to the number of
emotion lexicons, relatively large, including well-
known resources such as SENTIWORDNET (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010). An-
other notable resource is WORDNET-AFFECT which
contains both, sentiment assessments (positive, neg-
ative, neutral and ambiguous) and a hierarchy of var-
ious emotion categories (Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004; Strapparava et al., 2006). Lately, however, an
increasing number of emotion lexicons have been
developed—within the fields of NLP (Mohammad
and Turney, 2013; Staiano and Guerini, 2014), as
well as cognitive psychology (Bestgen and Vincze,
2012; Warriner et al., 2013). As far as studies
of sentiment in the economic area are concerned,
Loughran and McDonald (2011) adapted the Har-
vard Psychosociological Dictionary to better fit the
word usage of the finance domain. The resulting re-
source comprises six word lists (two of which re-
fer to positive and negative words), thus forming a
finance-specific sentiment lexicon.

Researchers in NLP and cognitive psychology
have devised a multitude of different models of emo-
tion which can be roughly subdivided into categor-
ical and dimensional models (Scherer, 2000; Calvo
and Kim, 2013). In computational studies, categor-

ical models most often employ Ekman’s (1992) six
basic emotions or a derivative therefrom. According
to this psychological theory, all human beings share
a common set of (basic) emotions so that each emo-
tional state of an individual can be unambiguously
classified as one of these. Dimensional approaches,
on the other hand, often refer to Russell and Mehra-
bian’s (1977) Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD)
model. According to this model, emotional states
can be described relative to three fundamental emo-
tional dimensions: valence (the degree of pleasure of
an emotion), arousal (level of mental activity, rang-
ing from low engagement to ecstasy) and dominance
(extent of control felt in a given situation). Accord-
ingly, emotions are characterized on three dimen-
sions, each of which spans an interval of real-valued
numbers indicating the strength and orientation of
each dimension. Hence, other than in categorical ap-
proaches with a usually small (up to nine) and finite
number of states, an infinite number of emotional
states can be represented in dimensional approaches.

Subjective language use has also been a topic
of interest in the business and economy domain.
A common theme is here whether the linguistic
‘tone’ of public mass media’s coverage of enter-
prises or publications authored by individual enter-
prises themselves are indicative of the companies’
future economic performance, and can thus, e.g., be
useful for stock trading strategies (for a recent sur-
vey, cf. Nassirtoussi et al. (2014)).

Early work on subjective language use in newspa-
pers as predictors for companies’ accounting earn-
ings and stock returns (Tetlock et al., 2008) or in
quarterly company reports for stock market perfor-
mance prediction (Kloptchenko et al., 2004) reveals
that such linguistic analysis uncover otherwise hard-
to-quantify aspects of firms’ fundamentals. The po-
tential of news-driven sentiment analysis is eluci-
dated in a recent study by Uhl (2014) who finds ev-
idence that polarity measurements on Reuters news
can explain and predict changes in stock returns bet-
ter than macroeconomic factors, in isolation.

Bollen et al. (2011) examine to what extent sub-
jective language on the social media platform TWIT-
TER can be interpreted as a predictor of stock market
prizes. They find that the predictive power of cer-
tain emotion categories exceeds that of the semantic
orientation, leading to a significant improvement of

148



basic stock market forecasting models. Their study
reveals the possible benefits of the additional infor-
mation emotion detection might contribute in con-
trast to (less expressive) sentiment analysis.

In a similar vein, Généreux et al. (2011) investi-
gate the impact of financial news items on the stock
price of companies. They treat short financial news
snippets about companies as if they were carrying
implicit sentiment about the future market direction
made explicit by the vocabulary they employ. They
investigate how this sentiment vocabulary can be au-
tomatically extracted from texts and subsequently
be used for classification. This resembles previous
work by Devitt and Ahmad (2007) who explored a
computable metric of positive or negative polarity in
financial news text which is consistent with human
judgments and can be used in a quantitative analysis
of news sentiment impact on financial markets.

Unlike sentiment analysis of informal communi-
cation pieces from social or mass media material,
Kogan et al. (2009) were the first in company-centric
text analysis to focus on official statements from en-
terprises on a larger scale (pioneering work was con-
ducted by Kloptchenko et al. (2004), as mentioned
above). They built up the 10-K Corpus, a collec-
tion of 54,379 annual business reports (from 10,492
different publicly traded companies) published over
the period from 1996 to 2006. They exploited this
corpus to predict the volatility of stock returns, an
established empirical measure of financial risk, us-
ing regression models. The economic assessments
are derived from the distribution of unigrams and bi-
grams in the reports incorporating TF and TF-IDF-
based measures for a bag-of-word (BOW) model.

Wang et al. (2013), in a follow-up study, reused
the 10-K Corpus by incorporating Loughran and
McDonald’s (2011) finance-specific sentiment dic-
tionary. The models they learn suggest strong corre-
lations between financial sentiment words and risk
in terms of stock return volatility. Using basically
the same experimental set-up as the former study,
Hájek et al. (2013) go one step further and demon-
strate that by combining qualitative sentiment in-
formation of annual reports with quantitative finan-
cial indicators (e.g. market capitalization, prof-
itability, etc.) the resulting stock price forecasting
model is more accurate than using quantitative indi-
cators alone. These findings are further supported by

Kazemian et al. (2014) who present empirical data
which indicate to act cautiously with respect to stock
trading strategies based on sentiment analysis of lin-
guistic data only (they propose to consider actual
market returns, in addition). Interestingly, the study
by Hájek et al. (2013) points out that the change
in sentiment (rather than its specific value in some
point of time) seems to be an important determinant
of stock price development in the long run.

3 Experimental Set-up

In order to test the assumption whether enterprises
can be attributed an emotional status as part of their
identity as social actors, we, first, compiled a text
corpus composed of annual business and sustainabil-
ity reports of the thirty top-performing corporations
in the United States, Great Britain and Germany.
These enterprises were selected based on their list-
ing in the Dow Jones, the FTSE 100, and the DAX
Index, respectively. The global economic power of
these corporations is quite impressive since, in 2014,
their revenues comprised about 7% of the world-
wide GDP, an equivalent of 5.4 trillion USD.

For these 90 corporations, we collected the En-
glish versions of all annual business and sustainabil-
ity reports (also called corporate social responsibil-
ity (CSR) reports (Matten and Moon, 2008)) avail-
able online. This corpus amounts to 1,676 reports
(3,798,070 sentences; 128,145,063 text tokens) di-
vided into 1,087 annual and 589 sustainability re-
ports covering the time span from 1992 to 2015.

We compared business reports (which we thought
to be emotionally mostly neutral) to sustainability
reports (which we thought to be much more emo-
tionally loaded). This comparison is based on a
simple vectorial BOW text analysis engine whose
novel feature is an attached emotion word lexicon
composed of 13,915 lexical entries (Warriner et al.,
2013). Each of its lexical entries carries empir-
ically determined (crowd-sourced) real-valued as-
sessments for the three fundamental emotion dimen-
sions of the VAD model (cf. Table 1 for illustrative
lexicon entries and associated VAD values).

So far, this model—though among the most popu-
lar models of emotion in cognitive psychology—has
found only very scant attention in the field of text-
based subjectivity analysis (Calvo and Kim, 2013).

Table 1: Lexicon entries from the VAD lexicon (adapted via
scale transformation from Warriner et al. (2013)) with consid-

erably high (low) valence, arousal or dominance values.

In the lexicon used in our experiments, valence,
arousal and dominance are balanced in the interval
of [−4, 4] (in the original VAD lexicon (Warriner et
al., 2013), values range in the interval of [1, 9]).

The basic processing cycle is as follows: A term-
vector representation (stop word-free, lemmatized)
is built up for each of the 1,676 reports. Each term
component of the 1,676 vectors is matched with all
of the 13,915 entries of the VAD lexicon. If a match
occurs, i.e., the lexical item at the i-th vector com-
ponent matches an entry in the VAD lexicon, the
3D emotion values of that item (cf. Table 1) are
multiplied with the number of occurrences of this
item in the underlying document. Finally, the emo-
tion values for all matched entries per document are
summed up and divided by the number of matches.
This average yields the emotion value of a given
document on the three principle emotional dimen-
sions of the VAD scheme.

4 Results of the Experiments

In general, we found valence and dominance val-
ues around 0.6 and arousal values at –1.0. The fact
that the latter is considerably lower than the former
two is partially derived from the statistical proper-
ties of the emotion word lexicon we employ. An-
other noteworthy characteristic is the strong correla-
tion between the valence and the dominance values
(r = 0.87) as shown in Figure 1(b). This corre-
lation can also be observed in the lexicon as well
as in other corpora (see below) although it is pro-
nouncedly higher in the enterprise corpus. The cor-
relation’s strength might be a suitable measure for
the appreciation of control as expressed in the in-
dividual documents. This is so because high cor-
relation hints at frequent co-occurrences of words
having high (low) valence ratings and words having

high (low) dominance ratings or a high frequency
of words having both, high (low) valence and high
(low) dominance ratings. According to this, the re-
sults can be interpreted as pointing out the great con-
cernment corporations place on control.

Next, we investigated the role of the two text
genres. First of all, in Figure 1, both genres can
clearly be distinguished, in particular in Figures
1(b) and 1(c). We find that sustainability reports
are on average way more positive (valence: 0.70)
and dominant (0.68) than annual reports (0.62 and
0.59, respectively). The differences in both emo-
tional dimensions are significant (two-tailed t-test:
p < 0.001) and show large effect sizes (Cohen’s
d > |0.7|). This tendency may be due to the
fact that annual reports have to comply with numer-
ous external constraints corporations have to respect
(e.g., themes and data required by legal prescrip-
tions, etc.), whereas in sustainability reports corpo-
rations have full control over phrasing and contents
and may focus on their voluntary activities.

To relate these findings to external resources and
thus gather evidence for the validity of our approach,
we compared our results from the enterprise data
set to those from a Reuters corpus which contains
newswire material (RCV1 (Lewis et al., 2004)). We
found slightly lower valence and dominance val-
ues than in the enterprise data but standard devia-
tion in the corporation corpus was half as high as in
RCV1—this points out that the enterprise corpus is
emotionally more homogeneous than Reuters.

Figure 2 depicts the localization of the two enter-
prise text genres relative to several newswire cate-
gories from the Reuters corpus in the VAD space. As
can be seen, the enterprise documents compare well
with Reuters business- and economy-related cate-
gories (in green), CCAT in particular, which con-
tains corporate and industrial topics. The emotional
values of business reports are thus shown to come
close to that of newspaper articles of the correspond-
ing content categories—these similarities seem to
indicate that the measures we use are valid.

On the arousal dimension, sustainability reports
reveal only a minor distance relative to Reuters busi-
ness and economic categories and the enterprises’
annual reports. Yet, on the valence and domi-
nance dimensions, they correspond very closely to
highly emotional fashion and sports news (GFAS

and GSPO, respectively; both in purple). This can
be taken as further evidence for the dissimilarity of
the two corporation genres mentioned before. The
dominance value of sustainability reports is on aver-
age greater than that of all news categories.

Furthermore, we could show that the reports (in
each case with respect to the authoring company)
all share a specific tendency in their emotion value
which is even relatively constant over time. This is
especially true when examining the two subcorpora
of annual and sustainability reports separately. In
this case, the proportion of explained variance with
consideration of the corporation which authored a
report reaches values of about 70% (for arousal in
annual reports, data are available in Büchel (2016)).

5 Conclusion

In summary, our research provides one of the first at-
tempts to study emotional factors in documents rep-
resenting large corporations—as reflected in the en-
terprises’ annual and sustainability reports—rather

than individuals. In comparison with economic
newswire material from the RCV1 corpus, we lo-
cated enterprise documents on three fundamental
emotional dimensions, namely valence, arousal and
dominance (according to the VAD model), and
found strong evidence for particularly high domi-
nance in sustainability reports. Furthermore, the
data indicate that organizations exhibit a distinctive
and persistent emotional profile. So, indeed, we
have reasons to believe that—in the light of their
reporting—enterprises have emotions in the sense of
an anthropomorphic model and that this profile con-
tributes to a unique organizational identity.

Technically, to the best of our knowledge, the
VAD-based emotion lexicon (with >10k entries) we
employed for our study has never been used for text
analytics tasks before. Note that this lexicon exceeds
well-known resources with a comparable emotion
model (Bradley and Lang, 1999) by an order of mag-
nitude.
