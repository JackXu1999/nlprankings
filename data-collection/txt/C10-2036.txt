Abstract 

This  paper  presents  a  fuzzy  set  theory 
based approach to Chinese sentence-level 
sentiment  classification.  Compared  with 
traditional  topic-based  text  classification 
techniques, the fuzzy set theory provides 
a  straightforward  way  to  model  the 
intrinsic  fuzziness  between  sentiment 
polarity  classes.  To  approach  fuzzy 
sentiment  classification,  we  first  propose 
a  fine-to-coarse  strategy 
to  estimate 
sentence  sentiment  intensity.  Then,  we 
define  three  fuzzy  sets  to  represent  the 
respective  sentiment  polarity  classes, 
namely  positive,  negative  and  neutral 
sentiments.  Based  on  sentence  sentiment 
intensities,  we  further  build  membership 
functions  to  indicate  the  degrees  of  an 
opinionated  sentence  in  different  fuzzy 
sets. Finally, we determine sentence-level 
polarity  under  maximum  membership 
principle. We show that our approach can 
achieve  promising  performance  on  the 
test set for Chinese opinion analysis pilot 
task at NTCIR-6.

Introduction 

With the  explosive  growth of the user-generated 
content  on  the  web  over  the  past  years,  opinion 
mining  has  been  attracting  an  ever-increasing 
amount  of  attention  from  the  natural  language 
processing  community.  As  a  key 
in 
opinions mining, sentiment classification aims to 
classify  opinionated  documents  or  sentences  as 
expressing positive, negative or neutral opinions, 
and plays a critical role in  many opinion  mining 
applications  such  as  opinion  summarization  and 
opinion question answering.

in  sentiment  analysis, 

Although  recent  years  have  seen  a  great 
progress 
is  still 
challenging  to  develop  a  practical  sentiment 
classifier  for  open  applications.  This  is  largely 
due to the particularities of subjective languages. 
Unlike  factual  text,  opinion  text  is  usually 
expressed  in  a  more  subtle  or  arbitrary  manner 
(Pang  and  Lee,  2008).  Moreover,  the  sentiment 
orientation  of  a  subjective  expression  is  often 
context,  domain  and/or  even  order-dependent 
(Pang  and  Lee,  2008).  This  makes  it  hard  to 
explore 
sentiment 
classification.  In  particular,  the  final  semantic 
orientation  of  an  opinionated  sentence  often 
depends  on the synthetic  effects of all sentiment 
units (e.g. sentiment words or phrases) within it. 
Therefore,  sentiment  granularity  selection  and 
polarity  aggregation  are  two  important  factors 
that affect sentiment classification performance.

In  addition,  real  opinion  texts  do  not  contain 
precisely-defined  criteria  of  membership  with 
respect  to  polarity  classes.  Most  current  work 
employs supervised machine learning techniques 
like  naive  Bayesian  models  and  support  vector 
machines  to  perform  sentiment  classification. 
While  they  have  shown  a  good  performance  in 
traditional  topic-based  text  classification  tasks 
(Wang,  2006),  their  applications  in  sentiment 
classification  are  far  from  satisfactory  (Pang  et 
al.,  2002).  The  reason  might  be  the  intrinsic 
fuzziness  between  sentiment  polarity  classes. 
Relative  to  the  concept  of  objective  topics  like 
politics 
sports 
text 
and 
classification, 
the  division  between  positive 
sentiments  and  negative  sentiments  is  rather 
vague,  which  does  not  make  clear  boundary 
between their conceptual extensions. Such vague 
conceptual  extension 
in  sentiment  polarity 
inevitably  raises  another  challenge  to  sentiment 
classification.

To  address  the  above  problems,  in  this  paper 
we  exploit  fuzzy  set  theory  to  perform  Chinese 
sentiment  classification  at  sentence  level.  To 
approach  this  task,  we  first  consider  multiple 
sentiment  granularities, 
including  sentiment 
morphemes,  sentiment  words  and  sentiment 
phrases, and develop a fine-to-coarse strategy for 
computing  sentence  sentiment  intensity.  Then, 
we  reformulate  the  three  classes  of  sentiment 
orientations,  namely  positive,  negative  and 
neutral 
sets, 
respectively.  To  describe  the  membership  of  an 
opinion sentence in a special sentiment fuzzy set, 
we further construct membership functions based 
on  sentence  sentiment 
thus 
determine  the  final  semantic  orientation  of  a 
given opinionated sentence under the principle of 
maximum  membership.  We  show 
the 
proposed  approach  can  achieve  a  promising 
performance  on  the  test  set  for  Chinese  opinion 
analysis pilot task at NTCIR-6.

More  recently,  Wilson  et  al.  (2009)  distinguish

fine-to-coarse  strategy,  which  take  into  account 
multiple  granularity  sentiments,  from  sentiment 
morphemes,  sentiment  words 
to  sentiment

3  Sentence-Level Sentiment Intensity 

In  this  section,  we  describe  a  fine-to-coarse 
strategy  to  compute  sentence-level  sentiment 
intensity.  After  a  brief  discussion  of 
the 
relationship  between  Chinese  sentiment  words 
and  their  component  morphemes  in  Section  3.1, 

314

we  extract a dictionary of sentiment  morphemes 
from  a  sentiment  lexicon,  and  compute  their 
opinion  scores  using  a  modified  chi-square 
technique.  Then,  we  develop  two  rule-based 
strategies 
for  word-level  and  phrase-level 
polarity  identification,  respectively.  Finally,  we 
calculate  the  final  sentiment  intensity  of  an 
opinionated  sentence  by  summing  the  opinion 
score of all phrases within it. 

3.1  Sentiment words and morphemes 
As  shown  in  Table  1,  Chinese  sentiment  words 
can  be  categorized  into  static  polar  words  and 
dynamic  polar  words.  The  polarity  of  a  static 
polar  word  remains  unchanged  while  a  dynamic 
polar  word  may  have  different  polarity  in 
different contexts or domains.

Table 1. Types of Chinese sentiment words 
 
For  a  static  polar  word,  its  polarity  can  be 
easily  determined  by  referring  to  a  sentiment 
lexicon.  However,  a  precompiled  dictionary 
cannot  cover  all  sentiment  words  in  real  text, 
which raises an issue of predicting the polarity of 
out-of-vocabulary  (OOV)  sentiment  words.  To 
address  this  problem,  we  introduce  sentiment 
morphemes. As Table 2 shows, here we consider 
two  types  of  sentiment  morphemes,  namely 
positive morphemes and negative morphemes.

  ‘corruption’,  and 

its component morphemes. In other words, word-
level  polarity  can  often  be  determined  by  some 
key  component  sentiment  morphemes  within 
sentiment  words.  Take 
three 
 ‘undermine’, 
sentiment words for example, 
  ‘degenerate’.  They 
 
share  a  same  negative  sentiment  morpheme
‘fail’,  and 
the  same  negative 
orientation.  Based  on  this  observation,  here  we 
use  morpheme-level  polarity,  rather 
than  a 
sentiment lexicon, to predict the polarity of static 
sentiment words, particularly the OOV sentiment 
words in real text. 

thus  have 

As  for  dynamic  sentiment  words,  traditional 
lexicon-based methods do not work for their real 
polarity  changes  with  contexts.  We  will  discuss 
the problem of dynamic polarity identification in 
Section 3.4.

Sentiment  morphemes  prove  to  be  helpful  in

morphemes  available  for  sentiment  analysis.  To 
avoid  this,  we  propose  to  automatically  extract

Identifying phrase-level polarity 

3.4 
To  handle  contextual  polarity,  we  apply  lexical 
polarity to determine the sentiment orientation of 
phrases within an opinionated sentence. Based on 
(Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) and (Turney, 
2002),  we  consider  four  types  of  structures  (as 
shown  in  Table  5)  during  sentiment  phrase 
extraction.  To  simplify  the  process,  we  reduce 
some  function  words  like 
  ‘and’ 
from the input sentences before extraction in that 
they  have  no  influence  on  sentiment  orientation 
determination,  and  focus  on  extracting  two 
consecutive  words.  Different  from  (Turney, 
2002),  we  consider  phrases  with  negations  as 
their initial words. In this way, we can handle the 
local negation that may reverse polarity.

After  opinion  phrase  extraction,  we  continue 
to  calculate  the  opinion  score  of  the  extracted 
phrases  using  rules  that  are  similar  to  (Hu  and 
Liu, 2004). Before going to the details of phrase-
level  opinion  score  calculation,  we  need  to  give 
some definitions in advance. 
Definition 3 (increased dynamic polar words). 
An increased dynamic polarity word can increase 
the orientation strength of sentiment words that it 
modifies  without  changing  their  polarity.  For 
  ‘serious’  in  the  phrase 
example,  the  word
 

  ‘serious  pollution’  and  the  word 

 ‘high benefit’. 

‘high’ in  the phrase 
Definition  4  (decreased  dynamic  polar  word). 
A decreased dynamic polarity word can decrease 
the orientation strength of sentiment words that it 
modifies  and  at  the  same  time,  reverse  their 
polarity.  For  example,  the  word  “
”  ‘little’  in 
 ‘little pollution’ and the  word 
the phrase

 ‘low benefit’.  

 ‘low’ in the phrase 
To  calculate  phrase-level  opinion  scores,  we 
construct a dictionary of dynamic polar words by 
extracting  adjectives  and  verbs  that  contain  a 
single-character  seed  morpheme  like 
‘little’ 
from the training corpus. Table 6 illustrates some 
increased  and  decreased  dynamic  polar  words 
and their signs for changing polarity.  

Example

 ‘increase’ 
 ‘upgrade’ 
 ‘down’ 
 ‘reduce’  
 ‘diminish’

With these dynamic polar words, we can then 
calculate  the  opinion  score  of  a  given  opinion 
phrase pi that consists of two words (denoted by 
wj, j˛ {1,2}), using three rules as follows. 

 ‘no’ and 

 
If w1 is a negation, e.g. 
‘without’, then Score(pi) =  -1· Score(w2). 
If  pi  involves  a  dynamic  word  wd,  then  
Score(pi) = Sign(wd) ·
Score(wj). Where, 
Sign(wd)  denotes  the  polarity  sign  of 
dynamic words shown in Table 6.  
  Otherwise,  Score(pi)  =  Sign(wj)  ·

4  Sentence Sentiment Classification 

4.1  Sentiment  fuzzy  sets  and  membership 

functions 

As we have mentioned above, sentiment polarity 
is vague  with regard to its conceptual extension. 
There  is  not  a  clear  boundary  between  the 
concepts of “positive”, “neutral” and “negative”. 
To  better  handle  such  intrinsic  fuzziness  in 
sentiment polarity, we apply the fuzzy set theory 
by  (Zadeh,  1965)  to  sentiment  classification.  To 
do so, we first redefine sentiment classes as three 
fuzzy  sets,  and 
then  apply  existing  fuzzy 
distributions  to  construct  membership  functions 
for the three sentiment fuzzy sets.  

In  our 

Score(Si)) 

formulation,  all 

the  opinionated 
sentences  under  discussion  are  represented  as  a 
sorted set, denoted by X, in terms of their opinion 
scores.  Thus,  we  have  X  =  [Min(Opinion  
Score(Si)),  …,  Max(Opinion  Score(Si))].  Where, 
i={1,…,n},  Min(Opinion 
and 
Max(Opinion  Score(Si))  denotes  the  respective 
minimum  and  maximum  opinion  scores.  The 
details  of  the  fuzzy  sets  and  their  membership 
functions  are  given  in  Definitions  5,  6  and  7, 
respectively. 
Definition 5 (positive sentiment fuzzy set). if X 
is a collection of sentiment opinions (denoted by 
~
x), then a positive sentiment fuzzy set  P
in X can 
be defined as a set of ordered pairs, namely

4.2  Determining sentence polarity 
Based  on  the  above  membership  functions,  we 
can now calculate the  grade of  membership of a 
given  opinionated  sentence  in  each  sentiment 
fuzzy  set,  and  thus  determine  its  polarity  under 
the  principle  of  maximum  membership.  The 
basic idea is as follows: Let Ã1, Ã2, …, Ãn  be the 
fuzzy sets of X. $ x

then x0 is a membership of the fuzzy set Ãk.  

5  Experiments and Results 

To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  our  approach,  we 
implemented  a  classification  system  for  Chinese 
sentence-level  sentiment  analysis.  The  system 
involves  three  main  modules,  namely  a  lexical 
analysis module, a subjectivity detection module 
and  a  sentiment  classification  module.  To 
explore  lexical  cues  for  sentiment  analysis,  the 
morpheme-based chunking technique by (Fu, Kit 
and  Webster,  2008)  is  employed  in  the  lexical 
analysis  module  to  carry  out  word  segmentation 
and  part-of-speech  tagging  tasks. To  conform  to 
the  NTCIR-6  evaluation,  a  sentiment  density-
based naive Bayesian classifier is also embedded 
in  the  second  module  to  perform  opinionated 
sentence  detection.  The  details  of  this  classifier 
can be seen in (Wang and Fu, 2010). To evaluate 
our  system,  we  conducted  experiments  on  the 
NTCIR-6  Chinese  opinion  data.  This  section 
reports the experimental results. 

5.1  Experimental setup 
In  our experiments, we use the same test set for 
the  Chinese  opinion  analysis  tasks  at  NTCIR-6. 
The  basic  statistics  is  presented  in  Table  7.  For 
comparison, the performance is reported in terms 
of  the  same  metrics  as  used  in  NTCIR-6.  They 
are  F-score  (F),  recall  (R),  precision  (P)  under 
the LWK evaluation with lenient standard.

and 

The  basic  sentiment  lexicon  used  in  our 
system contains a total of 17138 sentiment words, 
which  is  built  from  the  CUHK  and  NTU 
sentiment  lexica  by  excluding  some  derived 
opinion  words  like 
  ‘not  beautiful’.  In 
addition,  we  also  construct  a  list  of  95  dynamic 
polarity  words  using  the  method  described  in 
Section 3.4. 

5.2  Experimental results 
The  experiments  are  designed  to  examine  the 
following two issues: 

the 

(1)  As  we  have  discussed  above,  it  is  a  key 
issue to select a proper granularity for sentiment 
classification.  To  determine 
sentiment 
orientation of an  opinionated sentence,  we use a 
fine-to-coarse  strategy  that  considers  three  types 
of sentiment units, namely sentiment morphemes, 
sentiment  words 
sentiment  phrases. 
Therefore,  the  first  intention  of  our  experiments 
is  to  investigate  how  the  use  of  different 
sentiment  granularity  affects  the  performance  of 
Chinese  sentence-level  sentiment  classification. 
To  do  this,  we  take  the  above  three  sentiment 
granularity  as  the  basic  units  for  computing 
sentence-level  sentiment  intensity,  respectively, 
and examine the relevant sentiment classification 
results.  

(2)  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  study 
may  be  the  first  attempt  to  apply  the  fuzzy  set 
theory 
in  Chinese  sentiment  classification. 
Therefore,  our  second  motivation  is  to  examine 
whether it is feasible to apply fuzzy set theory in 
sentiment classification by comparing our system 
with  other  public  systems  for  Chinese  opinion 
analysis pilot task at NTCIR-6.  

Table 8 presents the experimental results with 
different  sentiment  granularities.  It  can  be 
observed  that  the  system  with  word  as  the  basic 
sentiment  units  slightly  performs  better  than  the 
system  based  on  sentiment  morphemes.  But  a 
prominent  improvement  of  performance  can  be 

obtained  after  using  sentiment  phrases.  This 
reason  may  be  that  under  the  fine-to-coarse 
framework,  sentiment  classification  based  on 
sentiment  phrases  can  handle  both  internal  and 
external  contextual  sentiment  information,  and 
can thus result in performance improvement.

CUHK system (Seki et al., 2007; Xu, Wong and 
Xia,  2007).  As  can  be  seen  from  Table  9,  our 
system  outperforms  the  CUHK  system  by  5 
percents  with  regard  to  F-score,  showing  the 
feasibility of using fuzzy set theory in sentiment 
classification.

In  this  paper,  we  have  described  a  fuzzy  set

unknown polarity and contextual polarity as well,

granularities,  namely  sentiment  morphemes, 
words  and  phrases  in  calculating  sentiment 
intensity  of  opinionated  sentenced.  Furthermore, 
we  define  three  fuzzy  sets  to  represent  polarity 
classes  and  construct  the  relevant  membership 
functions,  respectively.  Compared  with  most 
existing work, the proposed approach provides a 
straightforward  way  to  model  the  vagueness  in 
conceptual  division  of  sentiment  polarity.  The 
experimental  results  show 
that  our  system 
outperforms the best system for Chinese opinion 
analysis pilot task at NTCIR-6 under the  lenient 
evaluation standard.  

The encouraging results of the fuzzy set-based 
approach  suggest  several  possibilities  for  future
