Abstract

This paper describes the second edition of the
shared task on Taxonomy Extraction Evalua-
tion organised as part of SemEval 2016. This
task aims to extract hypernym-hyponym rela-
tions between a given list of domain-specific
terms and then to construct a domain taxon-
omy based on them. TExEval-2 introduced a
multilingual setting for this task, covering four
different languages including English, Dutch,
Italian and French from domains as diverse
as environment, food and science. A total of
62 runs submitted by 5 different teams were
evaluated using structural measures, by com-
parison with gold standard taxonomies and by
manual quality assessment of novel relations.

1 Introduction

Taxonomies are useful tools for content organisa-
tion, navigation, and retrieval, providing valuable in-
put for semantically intensive tasks such as question
answering (Harabagiu et al., 2003) and textual en-
tailment (Geffet and Dagan, 2005). In general, a hi-
erarchical relation is any asymmetrical relation that
indicates subordination between two terms, but in
this task we focus on hyponym-hypernym relations.
Taxonomy learning from text is a challenging task
that can be divided in several subtasks, including
term extraction, hypernym identification and taxon-
omy construction. Existing approaches for hyper-
nym identification from text rely on lexico-syntactic
patterns (Hearst, 1992; Lefever et al., 2014), cooc-
currence information (Grefenstette, 2015), substring
inclusion, or exploit semantic relations provided in
textual definitions (Velardi et al., 2013). This stage

usually produces a large number of noisy, incon-
sistent relations, which assign multiple parents to a
node and contain cycles. Hence, the third stage of
taxonomy learning, taxonomy construction, focuses
on the overall structure of the resulting graph and
aims to organise terms in a hierarchical structure,
more specifically a directed acyclic graph (Velardi
et al., 2013; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010).

More recently, the hypernym identification sub-
task has attracted an increased interest from the
distributional semantics community (Santus et al.,
2014; Rei and Briscoe, 2014; Roller et al., 2014; Yu
et al., 2015), as part of a wider effort to distinguish
between different semantic relations which exist be-
tween distributional similar words (Weeds et al.,
2014; Levy et al., 2015). Although this is a promis-
ing direction of research, that addresses some of the
limitations of pattern-based approaches, including
low coverage of domain-specific terms, most partic-
ipants in this shared task opted for traditional ap-
proaches for hypernym identification, with the ex-
ception of one system (Pocostales, 2016).

TexEval-2 is mainly concerned with automati-
cally extracting hierarchical relations from text and
subsequent taxonomy construction, therefore we
make the assumption that a list of terms is readily
available. This simplifies evaluation by providing a
common ground for all the systems, but participants
are allowed to add additional nodes, i.e. terms, in the
hierarchy as they consider appropriate. To avoid the
need for term extraction, terms are extracted from
existing taxonomies, providing participants with a
domain lexicon that has to be organised in a hierar-
chical structure.

2 Task Description

The first TExEval shared task (Bordea et al., 2015),
organised as part of SemEval 2015, introduced a
monolingual dataset that covers terms and hierar-
chical relations from four domains that were not
previously considered for this task. Performance
was evaluated across domains, considering com-
mon sense knowledge as well as technical domains
gathered from WordNet and other well known tax-
onomies. The second TExEval shared task aimed
to extend this experimental setting to a multilingual
setting, covering English, French, Italian and Dutch.
A main challenge faced by the participants in the
first TExEval was that no corpus was provided by
the task organisers. We address this issue by pro-
viding participants with instructions for download-
ing and preparing a Wikipedia-based corpus. De-
pending on the selected approach, a system may or
may not require large amounts of text to extract re-
lations between terms, therefore participants are al-
lowed to extend this corpus as they consider appro-
priate. The task is structured in several subtasks,
including monolingual subtasks for hypernym iden-
tification and taxonomy construction in English, as
well as two corresponding multilingual subtasks that
cover Dutch, French and Italian.

3 Dataset Creation

We selected three target domains (i.e. Environ-
ment, Food and Science) with three root concepts
(i.e. “environment”, “food” and “science”, respec-
tively). Then, for each domain we considered differ-
ent sources for gathering gold standard taxonomies,
including a multilingual thesaurus, Eurovoc1, a large
lexical database of English, WordNet, and a general
purpose resource, the Wikipedia Bitaxonomy (Flati
et al., 2014). We also considered other domain-
specific resources including “The Google product
taxonomy” 2 for Food, and the “Taxonomy of Fields
and their Subfields” 3 for Science.

English taxonomies The English gold standard
taxonomies are collected from each of the sources

described above as follows. Gold standards are
gathered from WordNet by selecting concepts and
relationships in the hypernym-hyponym hierarchy
rooted on the corresponding root concept for each
domain. Relations extracted from Wikipedia are
combined together with relations extracted from
domain-specific resources, to obtain high-coverage
domain-specific taxonomies. Hierarchical relations
from Eurovoc were used integrally without any
modification, but currently Eurovoc covers only the
Environment and Science domains. It is worth noth-
ing that the English gold standard taxonomies gath-
ered from WordNet and from combined resources
were also used as test data in the previous edition of
this shared task (Bordea et al., 2015).

Multilingual taxonomies For the three other lan-
guages, the collected English gold standards were
manually translated by six linguists (two computa-
tional linguists and four master students of the Ghent
University Translation, Communication and Inter-
preting department). In a first step, the English term
lists were translated in Excel by one annotator per
language. The first annotator was allowed to mark
entries that needed to be revised by a second an-
notator. In addition, the annotators could make re-
marks in an additional column. Some of the English
terms could not be properly translated in the spe-
cific domain (e.g. “center” in the food domain) and
were left out. In a second step, the translated term
lists were used to automatically replace the English
terms in the gold standard taxonomies with their cor-
responding translation.

The translation of English gold standards revealed
a number of issues. First of all, some of the trans-
lations were near-synonyms in the other language,
which eventually lead to cycles in the taxonomy. Ex-
amples in Italian are for instance “cibo” (English:
food) and “vitto” (English: fare) which are in Ital-
ian almost synonymous, whereas their English coun-
terparts have a more distinctive meaning. Another
problematic example are the Italian words “condi-
mento” (English: seasoning, sauce, dressing) and
“salsa” (English: dressing, sauce), which can be
hypernyms of each other, depending on the exact
meaning of the word. The translated taxonomies
also revealed errors in the original English taxon-
omy, such as for instance “conserve” is a kind of
“confiture”, which is incorrect.

Table 1: Structural measures of gold standard taxonomies, including number of vertices (|V |), edges (|E|), interme-
diate nodes (#i.i), connected components (#c.c.) and cycles.

Table 1 shows the resulting number of vertices
|V | and edges |E| of the produced gold standard
taxonomies for each considered domain, source and
language. We also report structural information
about the number of intermediate nodes (#i.i), the
number of connected components (#c.c.) and the
number of cycles. Test data for this task consists of
six lists of domain-specific terms for each language
that were provided to participants as a shared ba-
sis to construct the taxonomies. The initial English
taxonomies provide connections from the root node
to all the other nodes, as they form one connected
component. As some of the terms did not have a
correspondent in all the other languages, some of
the translated taxonomies have several components.
This is specifically the case for the food domain that
is highly dependent on the language and that shows
the largest variation in number of nodes. For ex-
ample, 127 terms from the Combined English tax-
onomy for Food could not be translated into Dutch

and 279 terms could not be translated into Italian.
Additionally, four cycles are erroneously introduced
for the WordNet Italian taxonomy for Food, includ-
ing “cibo”-“vitto”-“cibo” and “piatto principale”-
“piatto”-“piatto principale”. Slight differences ex-
ist between the Eurovoc taxonomies constructed for
different languages as well, and these taxonomies
underwent a thorough review process.

4 Evaluation Approach

The construction of taxonomies is a challenging task
even for humans but evaluating a taxonomy is not a
trivial task either. In this shared task, taxonomies
are evaluated through comparison with gold stan-
dard relations collected from WordNet and other
well known, freely available taxonomies. This is
complemented by a manual evaluation of relations
that are not covered by the gold standard and through
quantitative and qualitative structural analysis of the
resulting graph. The evaluation methodology is sim-

Table 2: Structural analysis of the submitted taxonomies and the string-based baseline for the monolingual setting

ilar to the approach introduced in the first edition of
TExEval, with the main difference that we also re-
port separate overall rankings of the participant sys-
tems for each of the subtasks.

Let S = (VS , ES) be an output taxonomy pro-
duced by a system for a given domain, where VS in-
cludes the set of domain concepts initially provided
by the task organizers and ES is the set of taxonomy
edges extracted by the system. To broadly analyze

the quality of the produced set of hypernymy rela-
tionships ES , these results are benchmarked against
the string-based baseline described in Section 4.1,
using the following evaluation approaches: i) anal-
yse the graph structure and check if the produced
taxonomy is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); ii)
compare the edges ES , against the set of relations
from each type of gold standard; iii) manually vali-
date a sample of novel relationships produced by the

1084



system that are not contained in the gold standard.
The final ranking of the systems takes into consid-

eration these three types of evaluation by aggregat-
ing the achieved ranks using a voting scheme. First,
the output taxonomies are ranked on the basis of the
average performance obtained for each evaluated as-
pect and for each domain. The resulting ranks are
simply summed up, favoring systems at the top of
the ranked list and penalizing systems at the lower
end.

4.1 Baseline

Simple string-based approaches that exploit term
compositionality as a main property to hierarchi-
cally relate terms are known to be highly effective
(Bordea et al., 2015). In this task, we implement
the following baseline approach for hypernym ex-
traction and taxonomy construction that is used to
benchmark the evaluated systems. The baseline ac-
counts for relations between compound terms such
as (science, network science) and is implemented as
follows:

B = (VB, EB) (1)

where EB = {(a, b)| b starts with a or ends with
a and |b| > |a|}. In this equation a is a term and b
is a compound term that includes a as a substring.
This baseline approach takes as input only a list of
terms and does not require any external corpora or
other structured information. It is worth noting that
the same approach was applied in the multilingual
setting, without any language-specific modification.

4.2 Structural Analysis

In this task, the structural evaluation quantifies the
size of a taxonomy under investigation in terms
of nodes and edges, evaluating whether the over-
all graph generated by hypernym-hyponym relations
provides connections between the root of the tax-
onomy and all the other nodes. This is an impor-
tant property of taxonomies that are used for search
because it ensures that all the nodes are findable
when exploring the taxonomy from the root. An-
other structural property of taxonomies is the ab-
sence of cycles, which are inconsistent with the se-
mantics of hierarchical relations. Additionally, we
highlight the number of nodes located on higher lev-

els of a taxonomy, called intermediate nodes. Find-
ing these nodes is more important than connecting a
large number of leaves, as they generate taxonomies
with a deeper and richer structure.

Based on these considerations, structural evalua-
tion is performed by computing the cardinality of
|VS | and |ES |. We use an algorithm that finds all
the elementary circuits of a simple directed graph
(Johnson, 1975) to establish if the taxonomy S con-
tains simple directed cycles (self loop excluded). We
then use an approach based on the Tarjan algorithm
(Tarjan, 1972) to calculate the number of connected
components in S. Finally, we compute the num-
ber of intermediate nodes as the number of nodes
|VS | − |LS | where LS is the set of leaf nodes in S,
where a leaf node is defined as a node with the out-
degree zero.

4.3 Gold Standard Comparison
While initial gold standard datasets for evaluating
taxonomy extraction were mainly based on rela-
tions extracted from WordNet (Kozareva and Hovy,
2010), more recent work (Velardi et al., 2013) fo-
cuses on specialized domains such as artificial intel-
ligence. The dataset introduced in this shared task
brings together gold standards collected from Word-
Net together with gold standards extracted from
domain-specific taxonomies and from Wikipedia, a
collaborative resource.

Given a gold standard taxonomy G = (VG, EG),
the comparison between a target taxonomy and a
gold standard taxonomy is quantified using the fol-
lowing measures:

• Edge precision: P = |ES ∩ EG|/|ES |
• Edge recall: R = |ES ∩ EG|/|EG|
• F-score: F = 2(P ∗R)/(P +R)

Additionally, we consider the Cumulative
Fowlkes&Mallows (Cumulative F&M) measure
(Velardi et al., 2013), denoted as BS,G, and defined
as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which measures
level by level how well a target taxonomy S clusters
similar nodes compared to a gold standard taxon-
omy G. BS,G is calculated as follows: let k be the
maximum depth of both S and G, and Hij a cut of
the hierarchy, where i ∈ {0, ..., k} is the cut level
and j ∈ {G,S} selects the clustering of interest.

1085



Then, for each cut i, the two hierarchies can be
seen as two flat clusterings CiS and CiG of the n
concepts. When i = 0 the cut is a single cluster
incorporating all the objects, and when i = k we
obtain n singleton clusters. Now let: n11 be the
number of object pairs that are in the same cluster
in both CiS and CiG; n00 be the number of object
pairs that are in different clusters in both CiS and
CiG; n10 be the number of object pairs that are in
the same cluster in CiS but not in CiG; n01 be the
number of object pairs that are in the same cluster
in CiG but not in CiS .

The generalized Fowlkes&Mallows measure of
cluster similarity for the cut i (i ∈ {0, ..., k}), as
reformulated in (Wagner and Wagner, 2007), is de-
fined as:

BiS,G =
ni11√

(ni11 + n

4.4 Manual Evaluation
Even the most complete and up to date taxonomy
can be extended with additional nodes and relations,
therefore it is possible for systems to identify correct
relations that are not covered by the gold standard.
A problem faced by gold standard evaluation is that
these relations are considered incorrect when relying
on a direct comparison with the gold standard taxon-
omy. This is why we additionally evaluate by hand
a subset of new relations proposed by each system
to estimate the number of relations in ES that do not
belong to EG. Due to limited resources, we extract
only a random sample of novel relations from each
submission and manually annotate them to com-
pute precision P as: |correctISA|/|sample|. At
most 100 relations were evaluated by one annotator
for each system, domain, and language for a total
of 6200 term pairs. Two different annotators were
tasked to evaluate submissions for the monolingual
subtask (English) and for the multilingual subtask
(Dutch, French, Italian).

The annotators were provided with a list of term
pairs organized by domain and were asked if the re-
lation was a correct ISA relation, if the relation and

the terms were domain specific, and if the relation
was too generic. Overall, a relation is considered
correct only if it is considered a correct hypernym-
hyponym relation, if it is relevant for the given do-
main and not over-generic. Take for example the
following edges from the food domain: (linguine,
pasta) and (lemon, food). Both edges are correct
ISA relations and are domain specific, but the sec-
ond edge is over-generic because lemons can be cat-
egorized more precisely as fruits.

5 Participants and Results

A total of five teams participated in the shared task,
but only two systems participated in the multilingual
subtasks. Two of the systems that participated in the
monolingual subtask alone did not submit runs for
the food domain, which has the largest number of
nodes. Overall, 62 system runs were submitted by
the five teams, 36 for the multilingual subtasks and
26 for the monolingual subtasks. Next, we provide
a short description of each approach starting with
the two systems that participated in the multilingual
subtasks.

JUNLP The JUNLP system makes use of an ex-
ternal linguistic resource for hypernym identifica-
tion (Maitra and Das, 2016). This resource is the
BabelNet semantic network that connects concepts
and named entities in a very large network of se-
mantic relations, called Babel synsets (Navigli and
Ponzetto, 2010). To make sure that no relations that
were used to construct the gold standards are con-
sidered, only relations that mention Wikipedia as a
source were selected, discarding relations from all
the other sources. Additionally, the system makes
use of two string inclusion heuristics. The first
heuristic checks if any of the terms provided by the
organisers is included as a substring in another term.
The second heuristic considers terms that have a
considerable overlap, for instance Chocolate Pud-
ding and Vanilla Pudding although their hypernym
(i.e., Pudding) is not mentioned in the list of terms.
A limitation of this approach is that stopwords are
also considered as hypernyms, but this can be easily
avoided by using a stopword list.

TAXI The methods for hypernym identification
used in the TAXonomy Induction system (TAXI)
rely on two sources of evidence: substring matching

Table 4: Manual evaluation of 100 (at most) randomly selected novel relations based on precision for English

and Hearst-like patterns (Panchenko et al., 2016).
The Hearst patterns for all languages are extracted
from Wikipedia and from focused crawls with seed
pages that are Wikipedia pages. In addition, for
English, several additional corpora are used in-
cluding GigaWord, ukWaC, a news corpus and the
CommonCrawl. For French, Italian and Dutch the
method is completely unsupervised and relies on
KNN approach. For English, an SVM classifier is
trained on the trial data. For all languages the fea-
tures are the same: substrings and ISA relations ex-
tracted with lexico-syntactic patterns. No databases
or linguistic resources beyond trial data and raw text
corpora mentioned above are used. For the taxon-
omy construction subtasks, the system makes use of
an unsupervised graph pruning approach based on
the Tarjan algorithm, connecting the resulting dis-
connected components to the root of the graph.

NUIG-UNLP The system implements a semi-
supervised method that finds hypernym candidates
for the provided noun phrases by representing them
as distributional vectors. Roughly, this method as-
sumes that hypernyms may be induced by adding a

vector offset (Mikolov et al., 2013; Rei and Briscoe,
2014) to the corresponding hyponym representation
generated by GloVe over a Wikipedia dump. The
vector offset is obtained as the average offset be-
tween 200 pairs of hyponym-hypernym in the same
vector space selected from trial data.

USAAR This system introduces hypernym endo-
centricity as a useful property for hypernym iden-
tification (Tan, 2016). Often multi-word hyponyms
are endocentric constructions which contains a word
that fulfills the same function as one part of its word.
E.g. an ”apple pie” is essentially a ”pie”. The num-
ber of multi-words terms that are endocentric in En-
glish is investigated and whether this endocentric
property can be used to generate entity links to con-
nect terms in the Wikipedia list of list.

QASSIT A semi-supervised methodology is used
for the acquisition of lexical taxonomies based on
genetic algorithms (Cleuziou and Moreno, 2016).
It is based on the theory of pretopology that offers
a powerful formalism to model semantic relations
and transforms a list of terms into a structured term
space by combining different discriminant criteria.

1087



In particular, rare but accurate pieces of knowledge
are used to parameterize the different criteria defin-
ing the pretopological term space. Then, a structur-
ing algorithm is used to transform the pretopological
space into a lexical taxonomy.

5.1 Monolingual Subtasks (English)

Table 2 presents the results of the structural anal-
ysis for English, giving an overview of the struc-
tural measures presented in Section 4.2 for each of
the submitted runs. The taxonomies constructed by
the TAXI and QASSIT systems are the only tax-
onomies that provide a path from the root to all
the other nodes, as the corresponding graphs have a
single connected component. All the other submis-
sions have more than ten disconnected components.
The string-based baseline is also producing several
disconnected components. The TAXI and USAAR
systems are the only systems that produce directed
acyclic graphs across all the domains. The QAS-
SIT system generates two cycles in the case of the
combined taxonomy for Science. Overall, only the
TAXI system consistently produces well-structured
taxonomies across domains. The systems that output
taxonomies with a large number of nodes, edges and
intermediate nodes (e.g., JUNLP and NUIG-UNLP)
tend to do so at the cost of introducing cycles in the
graph.

In Table 3 we summarize the results of the com-
parison with gold standards in terms of Fscore and
the Cumulative F&M measure. The string-based
baseline is relatively strong compared to the other
systems in terms of Fscore, providing the best re-
sults for all the domains with the exception of the
food domain. A reason why the baseline is weaker
in this domain is that a much larger number of food
terms are single-word terms that are not composi-
tional, but in absolute terms the results are still com-
parative with the results of the best system coming
second on the overall ranking. In terms of the Cumu-
lative F&M measure that quantifies structural simi-
larity with the gold standards, the QASSIT system
takes the lead for all the domains where a taxonomy
was submitted. In the case of the Food domain, it is
the TAXI system that achieves the best results for the
Combined gold standard and the USAAR system for
the WordNet gold standard. The string-based base-
line captures only a small part of the structure of the

gold standard, as shown by the poor results for the
Cumulative F&M measure.

The results of the manual evaluation of a sam-
ple of novel relations is presented in Table 4. It is
worth noting that not all the systems had at least
one hundred novel relations to analyse, therefore in
some cases a smaller number of relations was man-
ually evaluated. The USAAR submissions intro-
duce the largest number of correct novel relations,
with precision higher than 70% for Food taxonomies
and the Science taxonomy gathered from Combined
sources. The TAXI system comes second for all the
domains with the exception of the Science taxonomy
gathered from Eurovoc, where the QASSIT system
achieves the best results.

The final ranking of the systems is produced
by using a voting approach based on the averaged
scores of selected measures that cover the main
properties of a well-formed taxonomy. For this
shared task all the properties are considered to be
equally important, but a weighted approach could
also be considered depending on the intended pur-
pose of a taxonomy. These properties include (1)
cyclicity, measured in terms of the number of sub-
missions that have cycles; (2) structural similarity
with gold standard taxonomies, measured with Cu-
mulative F&M measure; (3) categorization, mea-
sured in number of intermediate nodes #i.i. that can
be interpreted as taxonomical categories; (4) con-
nectivity, measured in number of connected com-
ponents #c.c.; (5) overlap of edges with the gold
standard taxonomy, measured by Fscore; (6) number
of covered domains; (7) precision of novel relations
from manual evaluation of sample relations. Table 5
presents the averaged results for each of these mea-
sures across domains.

Take for example the best ranked system TAXI,
where none of the submitted taxonomies had any
cycles, which resulted in an overall score of 0 for
cyclicity and a rank 1 in the overall ranking, as this
is a desirable feature for a taxonomy. In the case
of the structure property, measured by averaging the
Cumulative F&M measure over all the submitted
taxonomies, the TAXI system achieved the second
highest score. This score is below the score achieved
by the QASSIT system for the same feature, which
brings the TAXI system on the second position in
the final ranking for the structure property. Cyclicity

and connectivity are the only two properties where
low scores are preferable, while for the structure,
categorisation, gold standard Fscore, domains, and
manual precision higher values are preferred.

The averaged scores shown in Table 5 are directly
used to obtain the final ranking of the system for
the monolingual subtasks presented in Table 6. The
scores used to generate the rankings for the Hyper-
nym Identification (HI) subtask are mainly the last
three properties, namely the Fscore with the gold
standard, the number of domains, and the precision
from manual evaluation. All the seven taxonomi-
cal properties described above are used for ranking
systems for the Taxonomy Construction (TC) sub-
task. The TAXI system achieves the best results
based on most of these measures, coming third only
for the categorization property. This brings the sys-
tem to the first place both for the Hypernym Iden-
tification and the Taxonomy Construction subtasks,
in the monolingual setting. There is a tie with the
USAAR system, but only for the Hypernym Iden-
tification subtask. The second placed system is the
QASSIT system, that is ranked on the top three po-
sitions for most of the properties with the exception

of the categorization property, where it is ranked on
the second last place. This is due to the fact that the
QASSIT system produces a relatively flat structure,
with a smaller number of intermediate nodes.

5.2 Multilingual Subtasks (Dutch, French,
Italian)

The results for the multilingual subtasks cover a
much smaller number of systems, as only two out
of the five participants submitted multilingual tax-
onomies. The same properties are used for the final
rankings of the systems as in the previous section, as
can be seen in Table 7. This table shows the average
scores of the two systems and of the string-based
baseline across domains. Both systems submitted
runs for all the domains, therefore in the multilin-
gual subtask the number of domains was not used
for ranking the systems. Table 8 presents the final
ranking of the systems for the multilingual Taxon-
omy Construction subtask and the multilingual Hy-
pernym Identification subtask. The TAXI system
achieves the best results across all the metrics, with
the exception of the categorisation property where
JUNLP system introduces a larger number of in-

achieves the best Fscore results in comparison with
the gold standards. The TAXI system achieves the
best results for English, with a 12.5% decrease in Fs-
core for Dutch and French and a 9.4% decrease for
Italian. JUNLP performance is more stable across
languages, with only a 5% drop in Fscore for Dutch
and Italian compared to English, and the same Fs-
core for French.

6 Conclusion

This paper provides an overview of the SemEval
2016 task on Taxonomy Extraction, that intro-
duced a multilingual dataset for evaluating hyper-
nym extraction and taxonomy construction. The
constructed dataset covers three domains includ-
ing Environment, Food, and Science. The task at-
tracted 62 submissions from five teams that were
automatically evaluated against gold standards col-
lected from WordNet, Eurovoc, Wikipedia and other
domain-specific resources. We also reported the re-
sults of an extensive structural analysis of the sub-
mitted taxonomies and a manual evaluation of a
sample of edges that are not covered by the gold

standards.
The best results were obtained by an approach

based on Hearst patterns that makes use of a large
web-based corpus including Wikipedia. All the
systems could benefit from addressing the taxon-
omy construction subtask, by paying attention to
the overall structure of the taxonomy not just the
task of extracting pairs of terms. Compared to the
previous edition of TExEval, there are two systems
that submitted proper taxonomies compared to just
one system last year. In this edition, it is also
worthy of mention the introduction of methods that
make use of purely distributional approaches. These
approaches leave a lot of place for improvement,
achieving a competitive recall but lagging behind
pattern-based approaches in terms of precision.

A possible improvement of this shared task is to
analyse system performance in relation to word pol-
ysemy. This could be measured by example based
on Wikipedia disambiguation pages or on the num-
ber of WordNet senses. It is reasonable to assume
that hypernym/hyponym pairs between polysemous
words are more difficult to connect without using
disambiguation methods to identify the appropriate
sense for a domain.
