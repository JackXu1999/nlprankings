A Functional Linguistic Perspective on Evaluation

ABSTRACT 

For the past two decades linguists working within the framework of systemic functional 

linguistics have been developing appraisal theory as a tool for analysing evaluation in discourse. 

In this talk I will present a brief overview of the current model and then move on to address a 

number of the challenges that have arisen over the years including distinguishing inscribed from 

invoked attitude, determining the prosodic domain of attitude selections and the role of attitude in 

the negotiation of affiliation. Recent work in Maton's Legitimation Code Theory, it sociological 

perspective on axiologically charged constellations of meaning in particular, will be introduced in 

relation to these challenges.
