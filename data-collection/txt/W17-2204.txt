Abstract

Enjambment takes place when a syntac-
tic unit is broken up across two lines of
poetry, giving rise to different stylistic ef-
fects. In Spanish literary studies, there are
unclear points about the types of stylis-
tic effects that can arise, and under which
linguistic conditions. To systematically
gather evidence about this, we developed
a system to automatically identify enjamb-
ment (and its type) in Spanish. For evalu-
ation, we manually annotated a reference
corpus covering different periods. As a
scholarly corpus to apply the tool, from
public HTML sources we created a di-
achronic corpus covering four centuries of
sonnets (3750 poems), and we analyzed
the occurrence of enjambment across stan-
zaic boundaries in different periods. Be-
sides, we found examples that highlight
limitations in current definitions of en-
jambment.

1 Introduction

Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit
is broken up across two lines of poetry
(Domı́nguez Caparrós, 1988, 103), giving rise to
different stylistic effects (e.g. increased empha-
sis on elements of the broken-up phrase, or con-
trast between those elements), or creating dou-
ble interpretations for the enjambed lines (Garcı́a-
Page Sánchez, 1991).

The literature shows a debate on the stylistic ef-
fects emerging from a mismatch between syntactic
and metrical units (Martı́nez Cantón, 2011). The
types of effects possible and the syntactic units
where the effects can be said to be attested are
a matter of current research. Quilis (1964) char-
acterized enjambment as occurring in a series of
very specific syntactic contexts. The definition is
still considered current, however, some aspects in
it have been questioned: Are these the only syn-
tactic configurations where such effects are ob-
served? Are syntactic criteria enough to predict
when these effects arise?

Given these unclear points, it is relevant to sys-
tematically collect large amounts of enjambment
examples, according to current definitions of the
phenomenon. This can provide helpful evidence
to assess scholars’ claims. To this end, we devel-
oped a system to automatically detect enjambment
in Spanish, applying it to a corpus of ca. 3750 son-
nets by 1000 authors (15th to 19th century).

We are not aware of a systematic large-sample
study of enjambment across periods, literary
movements, or versification types in Spanish, or
other languages. Automatic detection can help an-
swer interesting questions in verse theory, which
would benefit from a quantitative approach, com-
plementing small-sample analyses, e.g.: “To what
an extent is enjambment used differently in free
verse vs. traditional versification?” or “Does the
use of enjambment increase in movements that
seek distance from traditional forms?”

Finally, our study complements automatic met-
rical analyses of Spanish Golden Age sonnets by

27



Navarro-Colorado (2016; 2017), by focusing on
enjambment and covering a wider period.

The paper is structured thus: First we provide
the definition of enjambment adopted. Then, our
corpus and system are described, followed by an
evaluation of the system’s outputs. Finally, find-
ings on enjambment in our diachronic sonnet cor-
pus are discussed. Our project website provides
details omitted here for space reasons.1

2 Enjambment in Spanish

Syntactic and metrical units often match in poetry.
However, this trend has been broken since antiq-
uity for various reasons (Parry (1929) on Homer,
or Flores Gómez (1988) on early classical poetry).

Enjambment is considered to take place when
a pause suggested by poetic form (e.g. at the
end of a line or across hemistichs) occurs between
strongly connected lexical or syntactic units, trig-
gering an unnatural cut between those units.

Quilis (1964) carried out reading experiments,
proposing that several strongly connected ele-
ments give rise to enjambment, should a poetic-
form pause break them up:

1. Lexical enjambment: Breaking up a word.
2. Phrase-bounded enjambment: Within

a phrase, breaking up sequences like
noun + adjective, noun + prepositional
phrase complementing it, verb + adverb,
auxiliary verb + main verb, among others.
For instance, the italicized words in the
following lines by Matthew Arnold would
be an enjambment, as a line-boundary
intervenes between the noun roar and the
prepositional phrase complementing it (Of
pebbles): “Listen! you hear the grating roar
// Of pebbles which the waves draw back,
and fling, // At their return, up the high
strand”.

3. Cross-clause enjambment: Between a noun
antecedent and the pronoun heading a defin-
ing relative clause that complements the an-
tecedent (e.g. “people // who persevere may
succeed”).

Besides the enjambment types above, Spang
(1983) noted that if a subject or direct object and
their related verbs occur in two different lines of
poetry, this can also feel unusual for a reader, even

1https://sites.google.com/site/
spanishenjambment

if the effect is less remarkable than in the environ-
ments identified by Quilis. To differentiate these
cases from enjambment proper, Spang calls these
cases enlace, translated here as expansion.

The procedure in Quilis (1964, 55ff.) for assess-
ing the strength of the cohesion within syntactic
elements was as follows: Around 50 participants
were asked to read literary prose excerpts. Syntac-
tic units within which it was rare for participants
to produce a pause were considered to be strongly
cohesive (see the list above). The unnaturalness of
producing a pause within these units was seen as
contributing to an effect of mismatch between me-
ter and syntax, should the units be interrupted by a
metrical pause.

Quilis (1964) was the only author so far to
gather reading-based experimental evidence on
Spanish enjambment. His typology is still con-
sidered current, and was adopted by later authors,
although complementary enjambment typologies
have been proposed, as Martı́nez Cantón (2011)
reviews. Our system identifies Quilis’ types, in
addition to Spang’s expansion cases.

Above we listed Quilis’ three broad types, but
there are subtypes for each, equally annotated by
our system; a detailed description and examples
for each type and subtype is on our site.2

3 Diachronic Sonnet Corpus

The corpus is based on two public online collec-
tions (Garcı́a González, 2006a,b). The first one
covers 1088 sonnets by 477 authors from the 15th–
17th centuries. The second one contains 2673 son-
nets by 685 authors from the 19th century. We
created scripts to download the poems, remove
HTML and extract dates of birth and death for
the authors. The corpus covers canonical as well
as minor authors, inspired in distant reading ap-
proaches (Moretti, 2005, 2013). The distribution
of sonnets and authors over periods is given on the
project’s site.3

3.1 System Description

The system has three components: a preprocessing
module to format input poems uniformly, an NLP
pipeline, and the enjambment-detection module it-
self.

com/site/spanishenjambment/
our-large-sonnet-corpus

28



We used the IXA Pipes library as the NLP
pipeline (Agerri et al., 2014), obtaining part-of-
speech tags, syntactic constituents and syntactic
dependencies with it.

In the absence of data annotated for enjamb-
ment, that may allow applying a machine learning
approach, we created a rule and dictionary-based
system that exploits the information provided by
the NLP pipeline. A total of ca. 30 rules identify
enjambed lines, assigning them a type among a list
of 11 types, based on the typology in section 2.
Some of the rules are very shallow, only taking
the part-of-speech sequences around a line bound-
ary into account. Some other rules additionally ex-
ploit constituency information. Dependency pars-
ing results are used to detect among other cases
subject/object/verb relations, relevant for the ex-
pansion cases defined by Spang (see section 2).
For any type of rule, custom dictionaries can re-
strict rule application to a set of terms. E.g. certain
verbs govern arguments introduced by one spe-
cific preposition; we itemized these verbs and their
prepositions in a dictionary, to complement infor-
mation provided by the NLP pipeline or to cor-
rect parsing errors. The lists of verbs and preposi-
tions were obtained from online resources on the
descriptive grammar of Spanish.4

An example of a rule would be the following:
If line n contains a verb v, and line n + 1 has a
prepositional argument pa governed by v, and v is
listed in the custom dictionary as accepting argu-
ments introduced by pa’s preposition, assign en-
jambment type verb cprep to line-pair 〈n, n + 1〉.

It is possible, but rare in or corpus, for more
than one enjambment type to be applicable to a
line-pair. At the moment, the system annotates
only one type per line, following a fixed rule or-
der. In the future, criteria to output and evaluate
multiple types per line could be developed.

The rules are currently implemented as Python
functions. Future work that could benefit non-
programmer users would be to make the rules con-
figurable rather than written directly in code.

Enjambment annotations are output in a stand-
off format; the project’s site provides details.5

4 Evaluation and Result Discussion

We describe the evaluation method (the refer-
ence sets, the task and metrics), and present the re-
sults along with a brief discussion of error sources.
Comments about the relevance of the results for
literary studies are provided in section 5.

4.1 Test Corpora

To evaluate the system, we created two reference-
sets (SonnetEvol and Cantos20th), which were
manually annotated for enjambment by a metrics
professor and a linguist.

1. SonnetEvol: 100 sonnets (1400 lines) from
our diachronic sonnet corpus of ca. 3750 son-
nets. This test-set contains 260 pairs of en-
jambed lines.

2. Cantos20th: 1000 lines of 20th century po-
etry (Colinas, 1983), showing natural con-
temporary syntax. We identified 277 pairs of
enjambed lines.

The SonnetEvol diachronic test-set covers all cen-
turies, with ca. 70% of sonnets from the 15th–17th
centuries and 30% from the 19th. The test-sets
cover all enjambment types, but some types are
infrequent in them, as in Spanish poetry overall.

We annotated the Cantos20th corpus in order
to assess the system’s performance on contempo-
rary Spanish with natural diction, compared to its
behaviour with the SonnetEvol corpus, which in-
cludes some archaic constructions and often shows
an elevated register.

The distribution of enjambment types in both
test-corpora is shown on Table 1. The enjamb-
ment types are described in detail, with examples,
on our site2. The type labels generally stand for
the constituents that take part in an enjambment,
e.g. noun prep and adj prep mean, respectively, a
noun or an adjective and the prepositional phrase
complementing them.

To have an indication of the reliability of the
annotation scheme, 50 sonnets of the SonnetEvol
corpus were each tagged by two annotators. The
ratio of matching labels across both annotators
was 91.7%. Besides, a set of 120 sonnets (not
from the test-sets) annotated by our students were
later corrected by the professor; the ratio of match-
ing labels was 89.7%. Getting several annota-
tors’ input on more sonnets, and obtaining inter-
annotator agreement metrics (e.g. Artstein and
Poesio (2008)) is part of our planned future work.

4.2 Enjambment-detection Tasks Evaluated

We defined two enjambment-detection tasks: un-
typed match and typed match. In untyped match,
the positions of enjambed lines proposed by the
system must match the positions in the reference
corpus for a correct result to be counted. In typed
match, for a correct result, both the positions and
the enjambment type assigned by the system to
those positions must match the reference.

The untyped match task can be seen as an en-
jambment recognition task, and typed match cor-
responds to an enjambment classification task.

test-corpus (SonnetEvol). The project’s site shows
more detailed results.6 Lexical enjambment is not
listed on the tables above, as no occurrences were
found in the test corpora.

For untyped match, F1 reaches 80 points in the
SonnetEvol corpus, whereas F1 for typed match
is 66.31. For the contemporary Spanish corpus
(Cantos20th), F1 is higher: 80.63 typed match,
and 86.51 untyped match. This reflects additional
difficulties posed by archaic language and histori-
cal varieties for the NLP system whose outputs our
enjambment detection relies on.

A common source of error was hyperbaton: the
displacement of phrases triggers constituency and
dependency parsing errors. Prepositional phrase
(PP) attachment also posed challenges: Verbal ad-
juncts get mistaken for PPs complementing nouns
or adjectives.7 Creating a reparsing module to
manage hyperbaton and improve PP attachment
results may be fruitful future work.

Further interesting future work would be a de-
tailed analysis of error sources. This would help
determine the extent to which errors are due to
the enjambment detection rules in themselves or to
the NLP pipeline. In the second case, it would be
useful to know the extent to which POS-tagging

7PP attachment is a difficulty even in current languages
(e.g. Agirre et al. (2008) for English). For historical varieties,
Stein’s (2016) results for verbal adjuncts and prepositional
complements in Old French also suggest this difficulty.

represents line-positions; the x-axis is the percentage of enjambed line-pairs for a position over all en-
jambed line-pairs in the period. Enjambment across quatrains and across the octave-sestet divide is very
rare, with a small increase in the 19th century. The division between the tercets blurs in the 19th century,
in the sense that enjambment across them is clearly higher than in the previous period.

or parsing errors are due to archaic features and
complex diction in some of the earlier sonnets in
the corpus. The earlier varieties of Spanish cov-
ered in the corpus have a large lexical and syn-
tactic overlap with contemporary Spanish, which
justified applying NLP models for current Span-
ish to the entire corpus (besides the fact that we
are not aware of NLP tools for 15th–17th century
Spanish). However, it would be relevant to quan-
tify error sources per period.

5 Relevance for Literary Studies

The system’s goal is detecting enjambment to help
literary research on the phenomenon, via provid-
ing systematic evidence for its analysis. For in-
stance, in our result validation, we find that the
system annotates line-pairs that formally fit the
description of an enjambment context (see sec-
tion 2), but that we’d actually consider unlikely to
yield a stylistic effect. Conversely, our annotators
are sometimes surprised that line-pairs where they
perceive an unnatural mismatch between syntactic
and line-boundaries are not captured by our typol-
ogy and left unannotated by the system.

Regarding the system’s potential for quantita-
tive analyses, we consider our untyped detection
results helpful, given an F1 of ca. 80 points on
the diachronic test-set. As an example applica-
tion, we examined the distribution of enjambment
according to position in the poem, particularly in
positions across a verse-boundary (lines 4–5, 8–9
and 11–12). Comparing the results for the 15th-to-

17th centuries vs. the 19th century (Figure 1), we
see that enjambment across the tercets increases
clearly in the 19th century, with a small increase of
enjambment across the quatrains (lines 4–5) and
across the octave-sestet divide (lines 8–9). Per-
forming such analyses on a large corpus opens the
door for scholars to assess the literary relevance of
the findings, and search for the best interpretation.

6 Outlook

With automatic enjambment detection, our goal is
to help gather systematic large scale evidence to
study the complex phenomenon of enjambment,
which poses challenges for metrical and stylistic
theory to characterize, and for critical practice to
apply. Our metrics students have so far manually
annotated enjambment for 400 sonnets; their work
will permit computing inter-annotator agreement,
and performing new tests of the automatic sys-
tem. As our manually annotated corpus grows,
we will examine the possibility of using super-
vised machine learning to train a sequence label-
ing and classification model to complement our
current rules. A specific goal is improving en-
jambment type detection for the typed match task.
