ABSTRACT
A novel method for hybrid graph-based dependency parsing of natural language text is proposed.
It is based on k-best maximum spanning tree dependency parsing and evaluation of the spanning
trees by using a verb valency lexicon for a given language as a reranking knowledge base.
The approach is compared with existing state-of-the-art transition-based and graph-based
approaches to dependency parsing. As the proposed generic method was developed specifically
for improving the accuracy of Croatian dependency parsing, Croatian Dependency Treebank
and CROVALLEX verb valency lexicon are used in the experiment. The suggested approach
scored approximately 77.21% LAS, outperforming the tested state-of-the-art approaches by at
least 2.68% LAS.

Kvaliteta parsanja u paradigmi ovisnosnoga parsanja temeljenog na podatcima ovisi u najvećoj

implicitno sadržana u banci ovisnosnih stabala, kaže se da je kvaliteta parsanja ovisna o
svojstvima banke ovisnosnih stabala (Kübler et al., 2009). Ovdje se nastoji — koristeći postojeće
spoznaje o ovisnosnomu parsanju različitih razreda prirodnih jezika parserima temeljenim na

jezika CROVALLEX (Mikelić Preradović, 2008; Mikelić Preradović et al., 2009).

Prikazana su dva skupa eksperimenata. U prvome se skupu na hrvatskim tekstovima iz HOBS-a

predstavnik prijelazničkih parsera i MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2006) kao najbolji med̄u
ovisnosnim parserima temeljenima na teoriji grafova. Za testiranje je korištena najnovija inačica
HOBS-a, koja je sadržavala ukupno 88,045 pojavnica u 3,465 rečenica. Osnovni statistički

2 Introduction

The quality of data-driven dependency parsing — as expressed by the de facto standard depen-
dency parsing evaluation metrics such as LAS and UAS (Nivre, 2006) — is repeatedly shown
to be highly language-dependent. More specifically, being that syntactic properties of a given
language are implicitly encoded by dependency treebanks in the framework of data-driven de-
pendency parsing, it is seen as treebank-dependent (Kübler et al., 2009). The CoNLL 2006 and
2007 shared tasks on multilingual data-driven dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006;
Nivre et al., 2007) separate the tested languages into three classes on the basis of observed
dependency parsing accuracy scores: low, medium and high. It is specifically noted in (Nivre
et al., 2007) that "the classes are more easily definable via language characteristics than via
characteristics of the data sets" and that the "most difficult[-to-parse] languages are those that
combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of inflection," modified to an extent
only by the respective treebank sizes.

The research presented here was conducted with a goal of improving the baseline for depen-
dency parsing of Croatian texts. Croatian is a highly inflected Slavic language with a relatively
free word order, similar to Czech and Slovene, which were included in the CoNLL shared tasks
on dependency parsing. With respect to the results of the shared tasks, it was expected that
the scores for state-of-the-art parsers on the Croatian Dependency Treebank (Tadić, 2007; Agić,
2012; Berović et al., 2012) would place Croatian in the low accuracy class, i.e., the class of most
difficult-to-parse languages. After conducting these preliminary experiments, various courses
of action were considered in order to improve the baseline. Parsing baselines in data-driven
dependency parsing are usually topped by feature reselection (Passarotti and Dell’Orletta, 2010),
merging parser outputs — as in parser voting (Sagae and Lavie, 2006) and stacking (Nivre and
McDonald, 2008) — and by using external sources of linguistic knowledge, such as subcate-
gorization information (Zeman, 2002), possibly introducing rule-based (language-dependent)
modules into data-driven (language-independent) parsers. The presented approach deals with
implementing an interaction between a graph-based dependency parser and a valency lexicon
of Croatian verbs, producing in turn a parsing model requiring only a dependency treebank and
a machine-readable verb valency lexicon to operate.

In the paper, the baseline experiment in dependency parsing of Croatian using existing state-
of-the-art data-driven dependency parsers is first described, including a description of the
current state of development of the Croatian Dependency Treebank. Second, the valency lexicon
reranking parser is introduced, along with a short description of the verb valency lexicon of
Croatian verbs used in this experiment — CROVALLEX (Mikelić Preradović, 2008; Mikelić
Preradović et al., 2009). The newly-developed parser is evaluated within the testing framework
of the existing parsers and the obtained results are presented in comparison. Future work plans
for improving the parser and for improving dependency parsing of Croatian texts in general are
sketched in the closing section.

3 Baseline experiment

At the time of conducting the experiments within the CoNLL shared tasks of 2006 and 2007,
no treebanks for Croatian were available, for any syntactic formalism. More precisely, the
development of the Croatian Dependency Treebank started in January 2007 and only a 100-
sentence prototype of the treebank existed when the CoNLL 2007 task was initiated. Being
that both shared tasks required a training and testing set and that the minimum size of the
testing set was fixed at 5,000 tokens, the prototype was insufficient for participation. Once

the treebank had finally matured in size, the shared task experiments could be recreated for
Croatian texts in order to establish a baseline. This section briefly presents this experiment by
presenting the treebank, parser selection, experimental setup and the obtained results.

3.1 Treebank

Quoting (Tadić, 2007) and (Agić et al., 2010), the Croatian Dependency Treebank (hr. Hrvatska
ovisnosna banka stabala, HOBS further in the text) is a dependency treebank built along the
principles of Functional Generative Description (Sgall et al., 1986), a multistratal model of
dependency grammar developed for Czech. This formalism was further adapted in the Prague
Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Hajič et al., 2000) project and applied in sentence analysis and
annotation on the levels of morphology, syntax and tectogrammatics. The ongoing construction
of HOBS closely follows the guidelines set by PDT, with their simultaneous adaptation to
the specifics of Croatian. More detailed account of the HOBS project plan is given in (Tadić,
2007). Currently, HOBS consists of 3,465 sentences in the form of dependency trees that were
manually annotated with syntactic functions using TrEd (Pajas, 2000) as the annotation tool.
These sentences, encompassing approximately 88,000 tokens, stem from the CW100 newspaper
sub-corpus of the Croatian National Corpus (Tadić, 2002, 2009). The CW100 sub-corpus was
previously XCES-encoded, sentence-delimited, tokenized, lemmatized and morphosyntactically
annotated by linguists. Thus, each of the analyzed sentences contains the manually assigned
information on part-of-speech, morphosyntactic category, lemma, dependency and analytical
function for each of the tokens. Such a course of action was taken in order to enable the
training procedures of state-of-the-art dependency parsers to choose from a wide selection of
different features in experiments with stochastic dependency parsing of Croatian texts. Basic
stats for HOBS and the experiment sets are given in Table 1. Sentences in HOBS are annotated
according to the PDT annotation manual for the analytical level of annotation, with respect to
differing properties of Croatian and consulting the Slovene Dependency Treebank (SDT) project
(Džeroski et al., 2006). The utilized analytical functions are thus compatible with those of PDT.
HOBS is available via META-SHARE (Federmann et al., 2012; Piperidis, 2012).

The experiment was envisioned as a tenfold cross-validated run of several parsing algorithms
on the Croatian Dependency Treebank respecting the rules of the CoNLL 2006 and 2007
shared tasks. Training and testing set stats are also given in Table 1. They are indicative of
the high morphological complexity of Croatian, as tokens in HOBS are annotated by using
828 different morphosnytactic tags (out of the 1,405 existing in the Croatian Morphological
Lexicon (Tadić and Fulgosi, 2003)). As to the syntactic complexity inherent in HOBS, 1,801
of dependency relations (2.06%) were found to be non-projective in 761 different sentences

Table 2: Overall parsing accuracy of the standard dependency parsing algorithms

(21.96%), indicating an expectedly high presence of non-projectivity, similar to what is observed
in PDT (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005). All selected parsers were thus evaluated as non-projective
parsers, regardless of their need for treebank (de)projectivization that may be present as a pre-
or post-processing step in certain workflows.

3.2 Parsers

Parser selection was based on the results of the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks for languages
similar to Croatian, i.e., the observed LAS scores for Czech and especially Slovene (being that
PDT is substantially larger than both HOBS and SDT). Two standalone parser generators —
MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) and MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2006) — were shown to be
predominant in scores for parsing morphologically complex languages, with the graph-based
MSTParser systems slightly outperforming the transition-based MaltParser systems for both
emphasized languages. Based on these results, MaltParser and MSTParser were chosen among
the publicly available CoNLL 2006 and 2007 parser generators for inclusion in the baseline
testing on HOBS. MaltParser was configured by using MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre,
2012) and seven projective and non-projective parsing algorithms were tested, while four
different configurations of MSTParser were tested: first- and second-order arc-factored language
model with Eisner’s (projective) and Chu-Liu/Edmonds (non-projective) parsing algorithms.

3.3 Results

Labeled (LAS) and unlabeled (UAS) attachment score was observed, as well as linear label
attachment (LA), both overall and for specific syntactic functions and parts of speech. The first
set of results is given in Table 2. Systems are grouped into four classes by the way parsing
algorithms handle non-projectivity — as pseudo-projective and non-projective MaltParsers
and projective and non-projective MSTParsers. Boldfaced names indicate the top performing
algorithms for the four classes. Statistical significance of the observed scores is indicated by
Figure 1 as it shows that the MSTParser systems are consistently and significantly outperforming
MaltParser systems. The top-scorer of the experiment is the MSTParser system that used a
second-order arc-factored language model and the non-projective Chu-Liu/Edmonds maximum

and Slovene in CoNLL 2006 and 2007. Figure 1 also shows how graph-based top-performing
systems handle long-range dependencies better than their transition-based counterparts.

From another perspective, the top-performing MSTParser system with a second-order arc-
factored language model and the Chu-Liu/Edmonds MST parsing algorithm scored approxi-
mately 74.53% LAS, a result that places Croatian in the group of languages with low parsing
accuracy, as expected. Table 3 additionally indicates that the parsing scores are even lower for
the most important syntactic functions with respect to information extraction – subjects (Sb),
predicates (Pred) and objects (Obj). This supported the initial estimation that a compound
approach to dependency parsing should be implemented in order to increase overall parsing
accuracy for Croatian. The method is presented and evaluated in the following section.

4 Valency lexicon reranking parser

The suggested parsing method draws on the fact that verb valency lexicons, such as VALLEX
(Lopatková et al., 2006) and the VALLEX-inspired valency lexicon of Croatian verbs CROVALLEX
(Mikelić Preradović et al., 2009), explicitly encode obligatory and optional constraints on the
number and morphosyntactic properties of dependents that the verbs contained in the lexicon
impose. While rule-based dependency parsers might use such information on (predicate) verbs
at parser runtime, a post-processing reranking approach is presented here. Namely, a parser is
developed that provides k-best dependency trees sorted by adequacy for an input sentence and
this parser is then linked to the valency lexicon through a reranking module that reorders the
suggested k-best trees by using the lexicon to evaluate them. The evaluation and subsequent
reranking is done by weighting dependency relations whose heads are verbs contained within
the valency lexicon and adding up the weights to provide overall scores for the suggested
dependency trees.

In this section, the CROVALLEX valency lexicon is briefly presented and followed by a pre-
sentation of the reranking parser CroDep. The parser is then evaluated in the same testing
environment as in the baseline experiment and the obtained results are discussed.

4.1 Valency lexicon

CROVALLEX is a verb valency lexicon created following the FGD guidelines (Sgall et al., 1986)
and is accordingly compatible with HOBS with respect to the syntactic theory of choice. The
utilized version of CROVALLEX (v2.008) contained 1,797 verb lemmas with 5,188 valency
frames. Each valency frame is defined by stating the number, obligatoriness and morphological
properties of sentence elements that a given verb introduces. An example is given in Figure 2

Table 4: Distribution of direct predicate dependents in HOBS

for the verb dotaknuti (en. to touch). In the first frame, the agent (AGT) is obligatory (obl) and
the instrument (INST) is optional and has to be in the instrumental case (case number 7). In
the second frame, the patient (PAT) is obligatory and has to be in the accusative case (4).

The lexicon was adapted to the requirements of data-driven dependency parsing by filtering
all multiword lemmas and entries with frequency of 0 denoted in the lexicon. 1,455 verbs
and 4,090 respective frames were held. HOBS was then tested using CROVALLEX in order to
observe the overlaps. HOBS contained a total of 1,525 verb lemmas and 12,952 verb tokens (ca
14.55% of all lemmas and 14.72% of all tokens), out of which a total of 791 verb lemmas was
found in CROVALLEX (ca 51.87%). On the other hand, 664 of the CROVALLEX verbs were not
represented by HOBS (ca 45.64% of all CROVALLEX verbs). Even though the measurement of
static coverage of verb lemmas itself implicitly supports the course of action with interacting
CROVALLEX with a HOBS-trained dependency parser, the dynamic coverage, i.e., the coverage
of verb tokens provides an even stronger justification. Only 9.24% of all the verb tokens in
HOBS were not covered by CROVALLEX, i.e., for 90.76% of verb tokens in HOBS, at least a
single valency frame was found in CROVALLEX.

Another CROVALLEX-related viewpoint on HOBS is given in Table 4. It shows the relative
frequency of dependents attached to verbal predicates by their syntactic function. It can be seen
that a place in the sentence is most frequently opened by predicates to subjects (almost 20%),
prepositions introducing prepositional phrases (16.38%), auxiliary verbs (15.47%), objects
(12.17%) and adverbials (10%). The distribution indicates that the properties of verbs encoded
in CROVALLEX are readily instantiated in HOBS.

4.2 Parser

Within the suggested framework, parsing is envisioned as a three-step procedure. First, k-best
dependency trees sorted by confidence are provided by a language-independent data-driven
parsing algorithm. Second, these k dependency trees are scored by a valency-lexicon-based
scoring module. Third and final, the trees are re-sorted by combining the scores from the
previous steps.

The data-driven component is a dependency parser based on both MSTParser (McDonald et
al., 2006) and kMSTParser (Hall, 2007). Graph-based dependency parsing was chosen as
a starting point in prototype development on basis of the results obtained in the baseline
experiment, showing that graph-based dependency parsers consistently outperform transition-
based dependency parsers on Croatian texts. The prototype uses the perceptron training
algorithm implemented in MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005) and the parsing algorithm based
on (Camerini et al., 1980) for detecting k-best maximum spanning trees adapted to dependency

parsing in kMSTParser. This prototype parser is called CroDep0. Currently it supports only
first-order arc-factored language models. It was evaluated on HOBS within the baseline testing
framework to provide a reference point and it scored 73.27% LAS, 1.26% lower than the
top-performing second-order Chu-Liu/Edmonds MSTParser.

The verb valency lexicon reranking component prototype was developed in what could be
considered the simplest possible form of validating dependency relations with respect to valency
frames. Namely, the reranking component takes a dependency tree as input. It searches the
tree for verbal predicates. When a verbal predicate is encountered, its lemma is matched with
the valency lexicon. If it exists as an entry in the lexicon, each of the first-level dependents
introduced to the sentence by the verbal predicate is matched with the predicted slots in the
valency frames on basis of its morphosyntactic properties: if the properties match and if the
element is defined as obligatory, the tree score is incremented. The final score of the tree is
defined as the sum of scores of all dependency relations having a verbal predicate as relation
head. Each of the k-best trees provided by CroDep0 is given a score by the reranking component.

Finally, the re-sorting component combines the two lists — confidence scores for the k-best
trees provided by CroDep0 and valency scores provided by the valency reranker — into a
single list averaging the scores while favoring the stochastic component in case of ties. Being
that the dependency tree scores from the valency reranker are positive integers representing
overall counts of dependency relation confirmations extracted from the valency lexicon, they
are normalized for comparison with the CroDep0 confidence scores. The normalization is done
by using the maximum confidence score of CroDep0 as ceiling for the valency reranker scores.
More formally, let Sp = {cp(t i)}ki=1,∀i, cp(t i) ∈ [0,1] represent the confidence scores for the k
dependency trees t i from the k-best parser module and let Sv = {cv(t i)}ki=1,∀i, cv(t i) ∈ N be a
list of trees and respective integer scores obtained from the valency reranker. The normalized
valency reranker scores Ŝv and finally the overall dependency tree scores So are provided by the
re-sorting component as follows.

Ŝv = {ĉv(t i)}ki=1,∀i, ĉv(t i) ∈ [0,1] ĉv(t i) =maxi (cp(t i)) ·
cv(t i)

maxi(cv(t i))

So = {co(t i)}ki=1,∀i, co(t i) ∈ [0,1] co(t i) =
2 · cp(t i) · ĉv(t i)
cp(t i) + ĉv(t i)

The final output of the parser is always argmaxi(co(t i)). If there are multiple dependency trees
with the same overall score co, the ordering is decided by selecting the tree with the highest
relative score in the k-best parser ranking, i.e., Sp. The resulting parser prototype is called
CroDep. It inherits the properties of CroDep0 stochastic module, has the value of k fixed to 10
and additionally requires a verb valency lexicon in VALLEX-XML format for operation.

4.3 Results

Table 5 shows the overall accuracy of CroDep and its accuracy on selected parts of speech.
CroDep outperforms the top-performing baseline parser by 2.68% LAS and the difference is
shown to be statistically significant. The difference is also indicated graphically by the confidence
intervals in Figure 3 (left side), where CroDep is compared to the top-performing graph-based
system (second-order Chu-Liu/Edmonds MSTParser) and the top-performing transition-based

system (MaltParser stack projective). Table 6 shows the CroDep LAS and UAS scores on selected
syntactic functions, as well as precision and recall with respect to label attachment for these
functions, similar to linear morphosyntactic tagging evaluation. Compared to Table 3 which
listed the scores on these syntactic functions for the top-performing baseline parsers, it can be
clearly seen that the overall increase of CroDep accuracy by 2.68% LAS on MSTParser is caused
by a substantial increase in LAS for predicates, subjects and objects (more than 10.00% LAS
for each of the functions). Figure 3 (right side) shows that CroDep also handles long-distance
dependencies better than the best baseline parsers and that its footprint is very similar to the
one of the graph-based parser.

Conclusion and perspectives

A method is presented for hybrid language-independent dependency parsing by combining
data-driven k-best maximum spanning tree parsing and rule-based reranking guided by a
verb valency lexicon. It was tested in the form of prototype parser CroDep on the Croatian
Dependency Treebank by using the CROVALLEX lexicon of Croatian verbs and it scored 77.21%
LAS, topping the top-performing baseline parser by 2.68% LAS. Future work plans include
testing the method on other languages, combining CroDep with other parsers and using methods
of automatic valency frame extraction to enrich existing resources. Introduction of valency
features to standard parsers might be considered. A preliminary experiment with parsing
Czech was conducted by using PDT and VALLEX in compliance with the CoNLL 2007 shared
task. CroDep scored 80.51% LAS, topping CroDep0 by 1.73% LAS, thus indicating method
applicability across languages and outlining the influence of resource properties on method
performance. Further research in language-independent k-best spanning tree parsing with
valency lexicon reranking is required to support these preliminary results.
