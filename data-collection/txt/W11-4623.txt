Abstract

We show that the quality of sentence-level
subjectivity classification, i.e. the task of
deciding whether a sentence is subjective
or objective, can be improved by incorpo-
rating hitherto unused features: readability
measures. Hence we investigate in 6 dif-
ferent readability formulae and propose an
own. Their performance is evaluated in a
10-fold cross validation setting using ma-
chine learning. Thereby, it is demonstrated
that sentence-level subjectivity classifica-
tion benefits from employing readability
measures as features in addition to already
well-known subjectivity clues.

1 Introduction

Wiebe et al. (2004) refer to subjectivity in natural
language as “aspects of language used to express
opinions, evaluations, and speculations”. For ex-
ample, an utterance like

“In the end, though, it is only mildly
amusing when it could have been so
much more.”

clearly bears an opinion, i.e. is subjective, whereas
an utterance like

“The movie takes place in mexico,
2002.”

clearly does not1. Readability is usually refered
to as “the degree to which a given class of people
find certain reading matter compelling and, neces-
sarily, comprehensible” (cf. McLaughlin (1969)).
So whereas the meaning of a sentence like

“Nanometer-sized single crystals, or
single-domain ultrafine particles, are of-
ten referred to as nanocrystals.”

1Both sentences are taken from (Pang and Lee, 2004)’s
subjectivity data set v1.0.

is quite difficult to grasp, a sentence like

“Wills and Kate get into marriage
mode.”

is much easier to understand2. Why is that? The
former sentence not only exhibits a more com-
plex syntactic structure than the latter, but also ex-
tensively utilises domain-specific terminology that
many readers would not be familiar with.

Although counter-intuitive on first sight, we
pose the following hypothesis: There is a connec-
tion between subjectivity and readability in natural
language text. If so, we may assume that knowing
about its readability possibly yields valuable infor-
mation regarding its subjectivity.

1.1 Related Work

To our best knowledge, readability measures have
not been used to assess the subjectivity of any lex-
ical units so far, be it word forms, phrases, sen-
tences or whole documents. However, there is
Hoang et al. (2008)’s work on evaluating the qual-
ity of user-created documents, and recent work on
grading the helpfulness of reviews by (O’Mahony
and Smyth, 2010), both incorporating readabil-
ity measures. Close to our research is Nishikawa
et al. (2010)’s study on sentiment summarisation
which utilises measures both for informativeness
and readability. Very recent support in favour of
our hypothesis is provided by (Lahiri et al., 2011),
who measure a correlation between informality
and readability.

As subjectivity classification poses many inter-
esting challenges and has many applications in
NLP including genre detection, flame recognition
and information extraction, the identification of

features for subjectivity classification and the clas-
sification itself has been extensively studied. Es-
pecially Wiebe et al. contributed a lot to the field:
Wiebe (2000) learns subjective adjectives from
corpora in a semi-supervised fashion, while Wiebe
et al. (2001) identify other subjectivity clues us-
ing collocations. Riloff et al. (2003) and Riloff
and Wiebe (2003) present ways to mine extrac-
tion patterns for subjective expressions. Wiebe
et al. (2004) summarise these findings and show
how different features work “together in concert”.
Wiebe et al. (2005) introduce a scheme for anno-
tating opinions and the like in Wiebe et al. (2003)’s
English-language Multi-Perspective Question An-
swering (MPQA) corpus. Wilson et al. (2004) as-
sess the strength of deeply-nested opinions. Wiebe
and Riloff (2005) create high-precision classifiers
for distinguishing between subjective and objec-
tive sentences and use them as a source for learn-
ing additional subjectivity clues.

Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) perform both
document- and sentence-level subjectivity classi-
fication using Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers and several
unsupervised approaches. Pang and Lee (2004)
use a graph-based formalism to first tell subjective
and objective sentences apart, then perform a po-
larity classification employing both Naı̈ve Bayes
classifiers and Support Vector Machines.

1.2 Outline

This paper is structured as follows: In the next sec-
tion, we describe our method by presenting hith-
erto unused features for subjectivity classification:
readability measures. In Section 3 we describe our
experimental setup and evaluate its performance.
Finally, we draw conclusions and point out possi-
ble directions for future work in Section 4.

2 Method

Following our assumption that knowing about the
readability of natural language text possibly yields
valuable information regarding its subjectivity, we
will try to measure readability and later exploit this
information for sentence-level subjectivity classifi-
cation.

According to Klare (1974)’s survey there are
3 possible solutions to “tell whether a particular
piece of writing is likely to be readable to a partic-
ular group of readers”: A first solution is simply
to guess. A second solution are tests, manually
built and refined. A third solution are readability

measures. We will assess readability by such mea-
sures for the obvious reason that some of them are
automatically computable.

2.1 Readability Measures
We chose 6 different readability formulae from the
large body of available readability measures. All
measures we chose are automatically computable
and do not depend on lexical resources like word
lists and the like. We solely present the 6 formulae
themselves. The reader interested in their underly-
ing ideas, their development and the derivation of
their constants and variables may be refered to the
aforementioned Klare (1974), or the original work
cited below.

Additionally, we propose an easy to calculate
formula that embodies our own intuition for as-
sessing readability.

2.1.1 Devereux Readability Index
The Devereux Readability Index D was introduced
by Smith (1961) and is calculated as shown in
Equation 1,

D = 1.56× wl + 0.19× sl − 6.49 (1)

where wl is the average word length in characters
and sl is the average sentence length in words. The
Devereux formula was designed to cover school
grades 4 to 12. Hence, the higher the value of D,
the less readable the graded text according to the
formula.

2.1.2 Easy Listening Formula
The Easy Listening Formula EL was introduced
by Fang (1966) and is calculated simply as shown
in Equation 2,

EL = npsw (2)

where npsw is the average number of polysyllabic
words per sentence, i.e. words with more than just
one syllable. The Easy Listening Formula is, as
the name suggests, tailored to “listenability” rather
than readability. Therefore, the higher the value of
EL, the less “listenable” the graded text according
to the formula.

2.1.3 Fog Index
The Fog Index was introduced in Gunning (1952)
and reformulated by Powers et al. (1958). It is cal-
culated as shown in Equation 3,

FI = 3.068 + 0.0877× sl+ 0.0984× nosw (3)

169

169



where sl is the average sentence length in words
and nosw is the average number of one-syllable
words per sentence. The higher the value of FI,
the less readable the graded text according to the
formula.

2.1.4 FORCAST
The FORCAST formula F was introduced in Cay-
lor et al. (1973). It is calculated as shown in Equa-
tion 4,

F = 20.41− 0.11× nosw (4)

where nosw is the average number of one-syllable
words per sentence. The higher the value of F, the
less readable the graded text according to the for-
mula.

2.1.5 New Reading Ease Index
The New Reading Ease Index NREI was intro-
duced by Farr et al. (1951) and is calculated as
shown in Equation 5,

NREI = 1.599×nosw−1.015×sl−31.517 (5)

where nosw is the average number of one-syllable
words per sentence and sl is the average sentence
length in words. The higher the value of NREI,
the less readable the graded text according to the
formula.

2.1.6 SMOG
The SMOG grading S was introduced by
McLaughlin (1969) and is calculated as shown in
Equation 6,

S = 3 +
√
npsw (6)

where npsw is the number of polysyllabic words.
Again, the higher the value of SMOG, the less
readable the graded text according to the formula.

2.1.7 An Own Formula
Following our intuition for how to assess read-
ability, we propose an easy to calculate formula,
shown in Equation 7.

W = wl × sl × ntop (7)

Here, wl is the average word length per sen-
tence, sl is the average sentence length in words
and ntop is the average number of words in
each sentence, that are not among the top 1,000
most frequent words of a large reference cor-
pus. This list was automatically extracted from

D EL FI F NREI S W
wl × ×
sl × × × ×

nosw × × ×
npsw × ×
ntop ×

Table 1: Comparison of language characteristics
captured by the presented readability formulae.
wl denotes the average word length, sl the aver-
age sentence length in words, nosw the average
number of one-syllable words per sentence, npsw
the average number of polysyllabic words per sen-
tence.

an English-language newspaper corpus of Uni-
versity of Leipzig’s Wortschatz3 project consist-
ing of 49,628,893 distinct sentences, 4,785,862
word types and 926,766,504 word tokens. The
idea behind ntop is, that high-frequency words are
common to all readers, whereas medium- to low-
frequency words are not necessarily. The more un-
familiar words a reader encounters in a text, the
less readable it is. wl and sl basically capture
the same idea: both longer sentences and longer
words lead to less readable text. Just as for all the
other formulae, the higher the value of W, the less
readable the graded text according to our formula.

2.1.8 Other Formulae
There are other well-known readability formulae
we did not investigate in yet, e.g. Lorge (1939)
and Lorge (1948)’s Lorge formula, Flesch (1944)’s
Flesch formula and Dale and Chall (1948)’s Dale-
Chall formula. These rely on lexical resources
some of which are not publicly available and addi-
tionally introduce stronger language dependency.

2.2 Summary

Different readability formulae capture different
language characteristics, as summarised in Table
1. Not only do they differ in their encoded fea-
tures, but also in their intended outcome. Whereas
some aim to determine a school grade, some refer
to tables for further interpretation. For those rea-
sons, the readabilities calculated by the presented
measures are not comparable in general, although
they do have in common, that higher values sig-
nalise less readable (or less listenable) text.

3 Evaluation

In order to evaluate whether the presented read-
ability measures indeed yield possibly valuable in-
formation regarding a natural language text’s sub-
jectivity or not, we perform a sentence-level sub-
jectivity classification using readability formulae
as features: i.e., given a sentence, extract its fea-
tures and classify it as being either subjective or
objective.

3.1 Experimental Setup
The evaluation data set, the features and the text
classifier we used in our experiments are now
briefly described.

3.1.1 Evaluation Data Set
To ensure comparability and reproducibility of our
results we use Pang and Lee (2004)’s publicly
available subjectivity data set v1.04. This widely-
used data set consists of 5,000 sentences marked
as “subjective” and 5,000 sentences marked as
“objective”.

3.1.2 Features
Our baseline features are subjectivity clues pro-
vided by Wilson et al. (2005). Their freely avail-
able English-language lexical resource encom-
passes 8,221 word forms, each manually anno-
tated for being either a strong or a weak subjectiv-
ity clue and for its polarity being either positive,
negative or neutral. We only used the 5,569 strong
subjectivity clues to form a solid baseline. Exam-
ples of strong subjectivity clues include disagree,
love and overstate.

Our additional features are the readability for-
mulae presented in Section 2. Although most
of them were developed to capture readability of
whole texts, we apply them to single sentences.
Their minima, maxima, averages and standard
deviances measured in the 5,000 subjective and
5,000 objective sentences are shown in Table 4.

3.1.3 Text Classifier
The actual text classification is performed by Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVMs) (cf. Vapnik (1995)
and Cortes and Vapnik (1995)). SVMs are known
for being able to handle large feature spaces while
simultaneously limiting overfitting. Because of
the large number of baseline features at hand,
SVMs were a natural choice. The SVMs were

trained using an radial basis function kernel as pro-
vided by LibSVM (cf. Chang and Lin (2001)).

Even though it is highly probable that some of
the baseline features are either redundant, mislead-
ing, or both, no feature selection (cf. for example
Weston et al. (2001)) was carried out.

3.2 Results

As we use 8 features (7 readability formula and a
“feature package” consisting of 5,569 strong sub-
jectivity clues), there are

(

)
= 255 possi-

ble feature combinations. For each feature combi-
nation a SVM was trained and tested in a 10-fold
cross validation setting.

In this paper we only report on the best per-
forming feature combinations regarding precision,
recall and f-score plus each single feature on its
own. The results of all feature combinations will
be made accessible through the author’s web site5

by the time of the publication of this work.
Results of single features are shown in Table 2,

results for best performing feature combinations

3.3 Discussion

Although the presented measures may be consid-
ered as rather crude approximations of readability,
it is quite clear from the results shown in Table
2 and Table 3 that they provide a valuable source
of information regarding the sentence-level sub-
jectivity.

Whereas for “single features” the strong subjec-
tivity clues perform best in regards to precision,
every single readability formula significantly out-
performs them in regards to both recall and f-score
as shown in Table 2. The best performing read-
ability measure in terms of precision is the Dev-
ereux Readability Index, the Fog Index performs
best in recall and f-score. Even though these re-
sults look promising on their own, it is notewor-
thy that a classifier that simply always chooses the
same class reaches P = 0.5, R = 1.0 and F = 0.67
on the given data set.

Combinations of different readability formulae
show considerable improvement in precision, re-
call and f-score over single readability formula
features as shown in Table 3. Finally, combining
different readability formulae with strong subjec-
tivity clues shows further improvement and out-
performs using these clues alone in precision, re-
call and f-score, as also shown in Table 3.

It is remarkable that FORCAST appears in ev-
ery single feature combination shown in Table
3, both with and without the subjectivity clues.
Noticeably Easy Listening Formula only appears
in feature combinations without the subjectivity
clues. Fog Index, the best performing single read-
ability formula, appears only in combinations in-
cluding the subjectivity clues. Our own formula
does not contribute a lot – it only appears once.

Comparison
(Pang and Lee, 2004) report 92% accuracy
on sentence-level subjectivity classification using
Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers and 90% accuracy using
SVMs on the same data set. (Wiebe et al., 2004)
report 94% accuracy on document-level subjectiv-
ity classification using the k-nearest-neighbour al-
gorithm. Although these results are not directly
comparable to ours, our approach seems to per-
form not as good as theirs.

4 Conclusion & Future Work

We have shown that using readability formulae
and their combinations as features in addition to
already well-known subjectivity clues leads to sig-
nificant quality improvements in sentence-level
subjectivity classification. Therefore, one might
argue in favour of our initial hypothesis and say
that there is a connection between readability and
subjectivity. We will carry out a detailed error
analysis to shed light on their relationship.

Although our approach does not yet perform as
good as current state-of-the-art, we believe that
readability is a feature with less language de-
pendency and a greater generalisation power than
the pure presence or absence of certain word n-
grams. Thus, it looks promising to further in-
vestigate in readability formulae as features for
subjectivity classification. Thereby, it is possi-
bly worthwhile to choose more complex formu-
lae, e.g. ones that incorporate syntactic knowledge
like the depth of parse trees or the number of sub-
trees of parse trees (cf. Schwarm and Ostendorf
(2005)). Such formulae might be more reliable
predictors of readability than the one used in our
current work.

Questions still remaining open include: do we
need readability formulae themselves or is it suf-
ficient to just use the language characteristics cap-
tured by them? Are readability formulae indepen-
dent from each other, and if so, to what degree?
Are our results reproducible on other data sets, in
other domains and even for languages other than
English? If so, is there a plausible linguistic expla-
nation for a correlation between subjectivity and
readability? We will address these points in future
work.
