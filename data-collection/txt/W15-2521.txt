Abstract

In this paper, we analyse cross-linguistic
variation of discourse phenomena, i.e.
coreference, discourse relations and
modality. We will show that contrasts in
the distribution of these phenomena can
be observed across languages, genres, and
text production types, i.e. translated and
non-translated ones. Translations, regard-
less of the method they were produced
with, are different from their source texts
and from the comparable originals in the
target language, as it was stated in studies
on translationese. These differences can
be automatically detected and analysed
with exploratory and automatic clustering
techniques. The extracted frequency-
based profiles of variables under analysis
(languages, genres, text production types)
can be used in further studies, e.g. in the
development and enhancement of MT
systems, or in further NLP applications.

1 Introduction

Although considerable research aiming at enhanc-
ing machine-translated texts with discourse prop-
erties achieved positive results in recent years, see
e.g. (Webber et al., 2013; Hardmeier, 2014) or
(Meyer et al., 2015), some document-wide prop-
erties of automatically translated texts still require
improvement, as translation models are induced
from stand-alone pairs of sentences. Moreover,
target language models approximate the target lan-
guage on the string level only, whereas target texts
have properties that go beyond those of their indi-
vidual sentences and that reveal themselves in the
frequency and distribution of certain structures.
These frequency- and distribution-based proper-
ties of translated and non-translated texts are in fo-
cus of corpus-based translation studies. However,

these properties (in form of higher-level language
models) may also be useful for natural language
processing (NLP), including machine translation
(MT).

In this paper, we show an example of a corpus-
based analysis of interlingual (between English
and German) and intralingual (across different
genres) variation of discourse properties in trans-
lated and non-translated texts. In particular, this
paper will focus on various types of discourse re-
lational devices, pronominal referring expressions,
as well as modal meanings expressed with par-
ticular modal verbs. The frequencies of these
discourse features will be automatically extracted
from English-German comparable corpora which
also contain multiple translations produced with
several methods, including manual and automatic
ones. We will compare the distributions of these
features in both languages, as well as in transla-
tions from English to German, paying attention
to their variation across genres available in the
dataset. We will also consider differences in their
distributions in human and machine translation.
For our analysis, we apply exploratory and unsu-
pervised classification techniques. The obtained
information on the frequency-based interlingual
and intralingual differences may be valuable for
linguistic studies on language contrasts, human
translation, and may find application in NLP and
especially MT.

2 Related Work

2.1 Discourse properties in English and
German

Various discourse phenomena have been in focus
of several translation studies and those on lan-
guage contrasts dealing with English and Ger-
man. Recent years have seen an increase in the
number of works employing corpus-based meth-
ods for their analysis. However, multilingual stud-

158



ies are mostly concerned with individual phenom-
ena in particular genres, see e.g. (Bührig and
House, 2004) for particular cohesive conjunctions
or adverbs in prepared speeches, (Zinsmeister et
al., 2012) for abstract anaphora in parliament de-
bates, and (Taboada and Gómez-González, 2012)
for particular coherence relations. The latter, how-
ever, considers two modes: spoken and written,
and states that the differences between modes are
more prominent than between languages. Kunz
and Lapshinova-Koltunski (2015) and Kunz et al.
(2015) show that distributions of different dis-
course phenomena are not only mode- but also
genre-dependent. The authors show this for a
number of textual phenomena, analysing struc-
tural and functional subtypes of coreference, sub-
stitution, discourse connectives and ellipsis. Their
dataset includes several genres, and they are able
to identify contrasts and commonalities across lan-
guages (English and German) and genres with re-
spect to the subtypes of all textual phenomena un-
der analysis, showing that these languages differ
as to the degree of variation between individual
genres. Moreover, there is more variation in the
realisation of discourse devices in German than
English. The authors attested the main differences
in terms of preferred meaning relations: a prefer-
ence for explicitly realising logico-semantic rela-
tions by discourse markers and a tendency to re-
alise relations of identity by coreference. Inter-
estingly, similar meaning relations are realised by
different subtypes of discourse phenomena in dif-
ferent languages and genres.

2.2 Discourse properties in human and
machine translation

Cross-lingual contrasts stated on the basis of non-
translated data are also of great importance for
translation. Kunz et al. (2015) suggest preferred
translation strategies on the basis of contrastive
interpretations for the results of their quantitative
analysis, which show that language contrasts are
even more pronounced if we compare languages
per genre. These contrasts exist in the features
used for creating textual relations. Therefore, they
suggest that, for instance, when translating popu-
lar science texts from English into German transla-
tors should more extensively use linguistic means
expressing textual relations. Overall, they claim
that translators should use more explicit devices
translating from English into German, e.g. demon-

strative pronouns should be used more often in-
stead of personal pronouns (e.g. dies/das instead
of es/it). The opposite translation strategies should
be used when translating from German to English.

However, studies of translated language show
that translators do not necessarily apply such
strategies. For instance, Zinsmeister et al. (2012)
demonstrate that translations in general tend to
preserve the source language anaphor’s categories,
functions and positions, which results in the shin-
ing through effect (shining through of the source
language preferences, see (Teich, 2003)) in both
translation directions. Additionally, due to the
tendency to explicate textual relations, translators
tend to use more nominal coreference instead of
pronominal one. Explicitation (tendency of trans-
lations to be more explicit than their sources, see
(Vinay and Darbelnet, 1958) and (Blum-Kulka,
1986)) along with shining through belong to the
characteristics of translated texts caused by pe-
culiarities of translation process. A number of
works on discourse connectives, e.g. (Becher,
2011; Bisiada, 2014; Meyer and Webber, 2013)
and (Li et al., 2014), show implicit/explicit dis-
course expression divergence in both human and
machine translation. There are several studies that
attempt to incorporate information on discourse
relations or other discourse properties into MT,
see for instance, those by Le Nagard and Koehn
(2010), Hardmeier and Federico (2010) and Guil-
lou (2012), or those presented within the first Dis-
coMT workshop, see (Webber et al., 2013). Most
of them employ parallel corpora, thus, the approx-
imation of the target language is based on trans-
lations, which, however, possess characteristics
that differ them from non-translated texts origi-
nally written in a target language, also in terms
of discourse properties. This paper will consider
discourse-related characteristics that differ trans-
lation from non-translated texts, and also differen-
tiate human from machine translations.

3 Methodology

3.1 Data

As we focus on variation of discourse phenom-
ena in English and German, as well as English-
German translations, our data should contain both
English-German parallel texts and non-translated
comparable texts in German. Furthermore, as we
are also interested in linguistic variation in terms
of genre, the texts should be from different gen-

159



res. For this reason, we had to dismiss the typical
corpora used in MT, e.g. Europarl (Koehn, 2005)
or TED talks, as translated texts in these resources
are not comparable. The latter contains multilin-
gual subtitles which are produced under different
restrictions than those of translations. We also ex-
pect that some of the phenomena under analysis
might be omitted in the subtitles, as this is rec-
ommended in the guidelines1. So, we select two
corpora which contain English-German parallel
and comparable texts from different genres. En-
glish and German originals (EO and GO) were ex-
tracted from CroCo (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2012),
whereas German translations originate from the
VARTRA corpus (Lapshinova-Koltunski, 2013),
as it contains multiple translations of the CroCo
English originals produced both manually and au-
tomatically (HU and MT).

The whole dataset totals 406 texts which
cover seven genres: political essays (ESS), fic-
tional texts (FIC), instruction manuals (INS),
popular-scientific articles (POP), letters to share-
holders (SH), prepared political speeches (SP),
and tourism leaflets (TOU). The decision to in-
clude this wide range of genres is justified by the
need for heterogeneous data for our experiment.
The number of words per genre in comprises ca.
36 thousand tokens. We tag both English and
German data with the TreeTagger tools (Schmid,
1994).

3.2 Feature selection
Linguistic relations between textual elements help
recipients in their cognitive interpretation as to
how different thematic concepts are connected.
These relations are indicated by particular struc-
tures that language producers employ, e.g. gram-
matical items such as connectives, personal and
demonstrative pronouns, substitute forms, ellipti-
cal constructions and lexical items, such as nouns,
verbs and adjectives. As already mentioned in
Section 1 above, we will analyse discourse rela-
tions, coreference and modality.

For discourse relations, we will analyse connec-
tives classified according to the semantic relations
they convey. Our classification is based on seman-
tic relations defined by Halliday and Hasan (1976)
and includes additive (relation of addition, e.g.
and, in addition, moreover), adversative (relation

translations.ted.org/wiki/How_to_

of contrast/alternative, e.g. yet, although, by con-
trast), causal (relation of causality/dependence,
e.g. because, therefore, that’s why), temporal
(temporal relation between events such as after,
afterwards, at the same time) and modal relations
(expressing rather a pragmatic meaning, in which
evaluation of the speaker is involved, e.g. unfortu-
nately, surely).

Demonstrative and personal pronouns (such as
this, that, she, his, theirs, it, etc.) will serve as trig-
gers of coreference. We also consider distributions
of general nouns, e.g. plan, case, fact, which com-
monly function as abstract anaphora (Zinsmeister
et al., 2012). For the analysis of modality, we
consider frequencies of modal verbs grouped ac-
cording to the modal meanings defined by Biber
et al. (1999): permission (can/could, may/might),
volition (will, would, shall) and obligation (must,
ought to, should, need to, have got to, suppose to).

Table 1: Features under analysis

The set of 11 selected features is outlined in
Table 1. The first column denotes the extracted
and analysed feature patterns, the second repre-
sents the corresponding discourse property. For
the extraction of the frequencies of these feature
patterns, we use a number of regular expressions
based on string, part-of-speech and chunk tags, as
well as further constraints, e.g. position in a sen-
tence or in a text. Frequency information is col-
lected both per text, and per subcorpus (e.g. per
genre in a certain language).

3.3 Methods
For our analysis, we use exploratory and also
unsupervised classification (automatic clustering)
techniques which will allow us to observe differ-
ences between groups of texts and subcorpora, and
also to discriminate between them on the basis of
discourse features described in Section 3.2.

We apply correspondence analysis (CA) (Ven-
ables and Smith, 2010; Baayen, 2008; Greenacre,

160



2007) that is conceptually similar to principal
component analysis (PCA), with the difference
that the data is scaled so that rows and columns are
treated equivalently. Thus, this technique will help
us to see not only which variables (e.g. languages
or genres) have similarities, but also possible cor-
relation of these variables with discourse features
contributing to these similarities, as distances be-
tween between dependent and independent vari-
ables are calculated. These distances are then rep-
resented in a two-dimensional map, and the larger
the differences between subcorpora or texts, the
further apart they are on the map. Likewise, dis-
similar categories of discourse phenomena are fur-
ther apart. Proximity between subcorpora and dis-
course features in the merged map is as good an
approximation as possible of the correlation be-
tween them. In computing this low-dimensional
approximation, CA transforms the correlations be-
tween rows and columns of our table into a set of
uncorrelated variables, called principal axes or di-
mensions. These dimensions are computed in such
a way that any subset of k dimensions accounts for
as much variation as possible in one dimension,
the first two principal axes account for as much
variation as possible in two dimensions, and so
on. In this way, we can identify new meaningful
underlying variables, which ideally correlate with
such variables as language or genre, indicating the
reasons for the similarities or differences between
these subcorpora. The length of the arrows in the
graph indicates how pronounced a discourse fea-
ture is, see (Jenset and McGillivray, 2012) for de-
tails. The position of the points in relation to the
arrows indicates the relative importance of a fea-
ture for a subcorpus. The arrows pointing in the
direction of an axis indicate a high correlation with
the respective dimension, and thus, a high contri-
bution of the feature to this dimension.

The results of automatic clustering will indicate
differences and similarities between the languages
(English and German) and their varieties (genres).
Moreover, we can also discover differences be-
tween non-translated and (manually or automati-
cally) translated texts. We decide for unsupervised
techniques, in favour of different genres contained
in our data, and supervised classification performs
better with single genre data, so that in a super-
vised scenario, we would need to perform several
classification tasks. We apply hierarchical cluster
analysis (HCA), see (Hothorn and Everitt, 2014)
and (Everitt et al., 2011). This clustering tech-

nique is connectivity-based as its core idea is that
objects are more related to nearby objects than to
objects farther away. Objects, in our case texts and
subcorpora, are connected to form clusters based
on their distance measured here on the basis of
the feature distributions. We calculate the dis-
tance by the Euclidean distance which is one of
the most straightforward and generally accepted
ways of computing distances between objects in
a multi-dimensional space. The results of hier-
archical clusters are represented graphically in a
dendrogram, which is a branching diagram that
represents the relationships of similarity among a
group of entities. The arrangement of the branches
tells us which texts/subcorpora (on leaves) are
most similar to each other. The height of the
branch points indicates how similar or different
they are from each other. Ward’s method (also
called Ward’s minimum variance method) is em-
ployed to perform clustering. This method min-
imises the total within-cluster variance after merg-
ing.

The main drawback of this technique is that the
number of clusters needs to be specified in ad-
vance. Therefore, we apply a technique based on
bootstrap resampling, with the help of which we
are able to produce p-value-based clusters, i.e. that
are highly supported by the data will have large p-
values2. The output dendrogram demonstrates two
types of p-values: AU (Approximately Unbiased)
p-value and BP (Bootstrap Probability) value. AU
p-value, which is computed by multi-scale boot-
strap resampling, is a better approximation to un-
biased p-value than BP value computed by normal
bootstrap resampling.

4.1 Discourse properties in English and
German

First, we analyse English and German non-
translated texts, to define the differences between
these languages in terms of discourse properties.
We perform CA on the subset of data containing
originals only. In the first step, the dataset is la-
belled with text IDs only (e.g. EO 001, GO 010,
etc.).

In Table 2, we present the Eigenvalues calcu-
lated for each dimension to assess how well our

with the two-dimensional representation4.

Concerning dimension 1 (47,10% of inertia),

i.e. different types of discourse relations via con-
nectives for German, and coreference via demon-
strative pronouns, modal meaning of volition and
causal logico-semantic relations for English. The
assumption is that the second dimension indicates
distinction between genres available in our dataset,
which is not seen in the data labelled with text IDs
only.

For the sake of the visualisation of results, we
perform the same analyses labelling our dataset
with genres, and also reducing it to subcorpora
corresponding to different genres and languages
(e.g. EO ESS containing all texts of English polit-
ical essays, etc.), see the resulting plot in Figure 2.

tourism, essays and popular-scientific texts group-
ing together below zero (with additives, modality
and general nouns as features), and fiction, po-
litical speeches and letters to shareholders above
zero. The features of instruction manuals seem
to be language-dependent, as the English and the
German INS subcorpora are positioned on the op-
posite axis sides. Fictional texts of both languages
are positioned at the edge of the genre axis, with
personal pronouns contributing to this grouping,
which coincides with the results obtained by Kunz
and Lapshinova-Koltunski (2015) and Kunz et al.
(2015) showing that fiction is best distinguished
from the other genres for both languages with su-
pervised classification techniques.

Automatic clustering deliver similar results, see
Figure 3, with the exception of English fictional
texts, which are classified along with the German
fictional texts into the cluster of German subcor-
pora.

4.2 Originals and translations

In the next step, we include translated texts into
our analysis. The translation data is labelled
with HU and MT, indicating manual or auto-
matic method of translation, whereas digits indi-
cate translation variants. Thus, MT1 and MT2 are
produced with two different SMT systems, and
HU1 and HU2 were produced by two different
groups of translators. The results of the bootstrap

resampling5 suggests two classes in our data, il-
lustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Classification of originals and transla-
tions

As seen from the graph, our dataset is clus-
tered into originals (on the right side) and trans-
lations (on the left side), which is apparently the
most prominent difference in this data. This coin-
cides with the statements of the theory of transla-
tionese, see (Gellerstam, 1986) or (Baker, 1993),
that translations have their specific feature differ-
ing them from the source texts and comparable
originals in the target language. A number of stud-
ies have shown that these features can be used to
automatically discriminate between translated and
non-translated texts, such as (Baroni and Bernar-
dini, 2006; Ilisei et al., 2010; Koppel and Or-
dan, 2011). Our results show that this discrimina-
tion is also possible with discourse features, which
means that translations differ from originals also
in these properties.

The only exceptions in our results are man-
ually produced translations of political speeches
(HU2-SP) and instruction manuals (HU2-INS)
classified together with political speeches and let-
ters to shareholders originally written in German.
Most of the smaller clusters within the bigger
’non-translated’ class are grouped rather accord-
ing to languages than genres, e.g. political essays,
tourism texts, manuals and popular-scientific arti-

5We achieve a good classification performance with an
average error rate of 0,06.

cles.
Next, we want to prove if the observed dif-

ference between originals and translations is de-
pendent on the source or the target language
(which would indicate the phenomenon of shin-
ing through or normalisation). For this reason,
we perform two classification experiments apply-
ing the same clustering technique and including
German translation data and their English sources
in the first experiment (Figure 5), and the same
German translations together with German com-
parable non-translated texts in the second (Figure
6). The results show that in both cases, the data is
separated into translations and originals, with the
same two subcorpora as exceptions. So, no shin-
ing through/normalisation effect can be detected.

4.3 Human and machine translations

Finally, we perform classification on the data sub-
set containing translations only. The resulting den-
drogram in Figure 7 reveals four heterogeneous
classes of translations, all containing both man-
ually and automatically produced outputs. The
two human translations that were classified with
the non-translated data in previous experiments in
Section 4.2 form a cluster on their own. This is
the only cluster containing one type of translations
in the whole data subset. The other three clusters
consist of a mixture of human and machine trans-
lations. They presumably form genre-sensitive

Figure 7: Human and machine translations

On the one hand, this suggests that genre is
more prominent than translation method, i.e. there
are more differences between various genres than
between human and machine translations in the
data under analysis, if discourse properties are
concerned. On the other hand, the results may
also indicate that discourse features are more in-
formative in genre classification than in the dis-

164



tinction into human vs. machine. Similar re-
sults were shown by Zampieri and Lapshinova-
Koltunski (2015) who were able to achieve bet-
ter results in the classification between genres
than between translation methods, operating with
delexicalised n-grams and using supervised classi-
fication techniques. Therefore, we claim that the
distributions of the discourse features under analy-
sis are genre-dependent, which coincides with the
results of the previous analyses within a number
of multilingual genre studies.

As seen in the analyses above (see Figures 4, 5,
6 and 7), political speeches and letters to share-
holders are always clustered together in trans-
lated data. Similar observations were also made
in (Lapshinova-Koltunski, inpress) for a different
set of features. According to Neumann (2013),
these two registers seem to be closer in English
than in German, and so, their commonalities in
our translation data might indicate the influence of
the source texts. However, CA performed on Ger-
man and English originals reveal that these register
are similar not only within each language, but also
cross-lingually, as they are situated on the same
level of the y-axis, see Figure 2. As a result, trans-
lations also reveal these similarities.

5 Conclusion and Discussion

We have demonstrated an example of a corpus-
based analysis of discourse properties in a mul-
tilingual dataset which contains both translated
and non-translated texts, using exploratory and au-
tomatic clustering techniques. The results show
that discourse-related features vary depending on
the languages and genres involved. Languages,
even such closely related ones as English and
German, have different preferences in the usage
of discourse properties, which are also prone to
interlingual variation in terms of genres. This
knowledge on contrasts will be valuable not only
for contrastive linguistics and translation studies,
but also for natural language processing includ-
ing statistical MT, as it is available in form of
frequency-based information and can be used for
language models. The observed variation of dis-
course properties is also influenced by the nature
of the texts (translated vs. non-translated). Both
human and machine translations have constella-
tions of discourse properties different from those
of their underlying originals, and from compara-
ble non-translated texts in the target language.

Comparing machine-translated texts with those
translated by humans, we stated that genre-
membership of translations determines more
prominent differences between them than the
methods they were translated with (manual vs. au-
tomatic). This points to the fact that machine
translations resemble rather human translations
than non-translated texts in both the source and the
target languages, if discourse features are consid-
ered. On the one hand, this confirms the hypothe-
sis of levelling out indicating that individual trans-
lated texts are more alike than individual original
texts, in both source and target languages6. On the
other hand, our results conform to those obtained
by Rabinovich and Wintner (2015) who show that
multi-genre data is more difficult to be classified
with translationese (translation-specific) features.

Furthermore, the results seem to contradict the
findings in (Guzman et al., 2014), which used dis-
course information to develop automatic MT eval-
uation metrics. However, we believe that the dif-
ferences in the outcome are caused by the nature of
the dataset: translations in the present study origi-
nate from multiple genres, whereas Guzman et al.
(2014) use news texts only. Intralingual variation
in both English and German imply that if a model
is applicable for a certain genre in one language,
it is not necessarily applicable to a different genre
of the same language, as the distributions of the
underlying phenomena differ (sometimes) tremen-
dously.

The contrasts between translated and non-
translated texts suggest that we need more re-
search on how to incorporate discourse-based lan-
guage models induced from comparable and not
parallel data. In this way, we might achieve a
closer approximation of machine translation to
non-translated texts in a target language. This is
relevant not only for the development of machine
translation systems but also for their evaluation,
as the similarities between a reference and an MT
output might be confounding in the quality judge-
ment, if discourse phenomena are concerned. In
the future, experiments could be planned that ap-
ply the present results for the development and
evaluation of MT. Moreover, it would be interest-
ing to learn if the differences between translated
and original text affect perception of the quality of
the text, for which experiments involving human
judgements are required.

6Variation in individual translators is not considered.
