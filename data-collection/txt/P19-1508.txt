Abstract

Recent work shows that distributional seman-
tic models can be used to decode patterns of
brain activity associated with individual words
and sentence meanings. However, it is yet un-
clear to what extent such models can be used
to study and decode fMRI patterns associated
with specific aspects of semantic composition
such as the negation function. In this paper,
we apply lexical and compositional seman-
tic models to decode fMRI patterns associated
with negated and affirmative sentences con-
taining hand-action verbs. Our results show
reduced decoding (correlation) of sentences
where the verb is in the negated context, as
compared to the affirmative one, within brain
regions implicated in action-semantic process-
ing. This supports behavioral and brain imag-
ing studies, suggesting that negation involves
reduced access to aspects of the affirmative
mental representation. The results pave the
way for testing alternate semantic models of
negation against human semantic processing
in the brain.

1 Introduction

Computational semantic models are increasingly
being evaluated in their ability to capture aspects
of human semantic processing, including similar-
ity and association judgments (De Deyne et al.,
2016) and semantic representation in the brain
(Bulat et al., 2017). Prior work shows that dis-
tributional semantic models (DSMs) are able to
decode functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) patterns associated with the meaning of
concrete words (Anderson et al., 2013). Relevant
to our work, Carota et al. (2017) showed that the
similarity structure of DSMs for action words cor-
relates with that of fMRI patterns in brain regions
implicated in action-semantic processing.

More recent studies have also investigated the

ability of DSMs to predict fMRI patterns of sen-
tential meanings (Pereira et al., 2018) and larger
narrative text passages (Wehbe et al., 2014; Huth
et al., 2016). They have shown that encoding mod-
els based on word embeddings are able to capture
subtle aspects of sentence meaning in the brain,
even when these models are oblivious of word or-
der and syntactic structure. While promising, none
of this research has so far systematically investi-
gated specific semantic composition phenomena
and processing at the syntax-semantic interface,
such as that of the negation function.

Negation is a fundamental abstraction necessary
for efficient reasoning and communication (Horn,
1989). Although it is typically marked syntac-
tically, the semantics of negation in natural lan-
guage usage has proven to be rather challenging
to pinpoint (Speranza and Horn, 2010). In logi-
cal negation, the negation operator has been suc-
cinctly described as a truth-functional operation,
reversing the truth value of a sentence. On the
other hand, from a pragmatic point of view, the
primary function of negation is to direct attention
to an alternative meaning and can thus be, more
generally, compared to our ability for counterfac-
tual thinking (Hasson and Glucksberg, 2006). It is
also often assumed that negation entails affirma-
tion (as it is always positive by default), yet the
extent to which the the affirmative situation need
be processes is debated (Orenes et al., 2014). De-
spite the intuition that negated meanings are in-
deed quite distinct from their affirmative counter-
parts, there is still no comprehensive account of
how the brain represents negated entities.

Neuroscientific studies on negation have pre-
dominantly focused on studying negation of
action-related sentences and suggest that nega-
tion blocks access to aspects of the affirmative
representation (Papeo et al., 2016). For exam-



5156

ple, negation of action-related sentences or im-
peratives involves decreased activity in motor sys-
tems of the brain implicated in action semantics
when compared to the affirmative context (Tetta-
manti et al., 2008; Tomasino et al., 2010). How-
ever, overall reduced activation does not necessar-
ily equate to a lack of information across patterns
of activated or deactivated voxels in a brain region
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). More importantly, the
degree to which negation of action-related sen-
tences impacts access to lexico-semantic repre-
sentations and semantic similarity in the brain is
not yet well understood. To contribute to our un-
derstanding of negation and its modeling, we in-
vestigate the extent to which lexical and compo-
sitional semantic models can decode fMRI pat-
terns of negated and affirmative action sentences
in the brain using similarity-based decoding (An-
derson et al., 2016). We also test the extent
to which the representational similarity structure
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) of DSMs of action-
verbs correlates with that of fMRI patterns asso-
ciated with negated versus affirmative sentences
containing hand-action verbs. We focus on motor
areas and classical language-related brain regions
implicated in action-semantic processing (e.g., un-
derstanding action words and sentences) (Pulver-
muller, 2005; Kemmerer, 2015).

DSMs have proven successful in modeling as-
pects of semantic composition in the context
of the natural language inference task (Bowman
et al., 2015b). Although the modeling of logical
negation using DSMs is wrought with challenges
(Kruszewski et al., 2017), current state-of-the-art
neural network based models appear to capture el-
ements of markedness asymmetry in negation (Li
et al., 2016) and, presumably, implicitly model
negation at some level. In our experiments, we
investigate the extent to which DSMs are able
to decode (correlate with) fMRI patterns asso-
ciated with the reading of sentences containing
negated and affirmative action verbs. We exper-
iment with (1) word-level representations of ac-
tion verbs; and (2) compositional semantic models
(based on addition of word-level representations
and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks).

In agreement with previous work, our results
show that distributional representations of action
verbs (and to some extent verb-object phrases)
show reduced decoding for negated versus affir-
mative action sentences. This is also reflected as

a reduced correlation between the similarity struc-
ture of DSMs of action verbs and fMRI patterns
of negated as compared to affirmative action sen-
tences. Importantly, we show for the first time that
negation impacts semantic similarity in motor ar-
eas, but also to some extent language-related brain
regions. These findings lend further support to the
hypothesis that negation may involve reduced ac-
cess to aspects of the affirmative mental represen-
tation.

2 Related Work

Decoding brain activity Mitchell et al. (2008)
were the first to show that DSMs based on co-
occurrence counts with 25 sensorimotor verbs
(e.g. see, hear, taste) can predict fMRI pat-
terns associated with the meaning of concrete
nouns. Later research has demonstrated that a
range of DSMs can decode fMRI patterns of con-
crete nouns (Murphy et al., 2012; Anderson et al.,
2013; Bulat et al., 2017) and, more recently, ab-
stract nouns (Anderson et al., 2017). Most rel-
evant to our study, Carota et al. (2017) showed
that the similarity structure of a Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (LSA) model for action words (nouns
and verbs) correlates with that of fMRI patterns in
motor areas (left precentral gyrus (LPG)) and clas-
sical language-related brain regions (left inferior
frontal gyrus (LIFG), left posterior middle tempo-
ral gyurs (LMTP)) implicated in lexico-semantic
processing (Binder et al., 2009).

Moving beyond words, other studies have
shown that DSMs can predict brain activity pat-
terns associated with larger linguistic units (We-
hbe et al., 2014; Huth et al., 2016; Pereira et al.,
2018). For example, Pereira et al. (2018) showed
that a regression model mapping between fMRI
patterns of words and their word embeddings
could synthesize vector representations for novel
sentences that correlate with the average of the
word embeddings of the sentence. Working with
larger text fragments, Wehbe et al. (2014) and
Huth et al. (2016) have been able to predict neu-
ral activity associated with the processing of narra-
tives in the brain using encoding models with word
embeddings (also syntactic markers) as features.
Although these findings suggest that DSMs are
able to predict fMRI patterns associated with the
processing of compositional meanings, they do not
reveal to what extent the models capture specific
compositional phenomena nor the specific impact



5157

of linguistic context on semantic representation in
the brain. Our work extends this line of research to
study individual aspects of semantic composition,
focusing on the negation function.

Modeling negation in NLP Kruszewski et al.
(2017) contrast logical negation, which captures
the idea of the complement of a set, with con-
versational negation, the phenomenon by which
negation identifies a set of alternative plausible
utterances: i.e., the assertion “this is not a dog”
suggests that the speaker may have been talking
about other mammals, but is unlikely to have been
talking about a skyscraper. They argue that dis-
tributional semantics is a good fit to model con-
versational negation. Their focus is on compo-
sitional distributional methods, which model the
negation of nouns via linear transformations. This
approach, unlike those used in the present work,
relies on the availability of parsed training data.

The effect of negation has also been studied
in recurrent neural network models for sentiment
classification: Li et al. (2016) observe that their
LSTM model does not simply learn a fixed trans-
formation for “not”, but rather manages to capture
differences in the composition of different words;
while Wang et al. (2015) study the behaviour of
the LSTM gates in response to negation, showing
the network’s ability to simulate complex linguis-
tic phenomena. Both groups of authors, like us,
focus on LSTM networks, but their models were
trained on a sentiment analysis task. We chose
a natural language inference task, as it has over
an order of magnitude more training data, and re-
quires models to learn a full range of logical and
commonsense inferences (Bowman et al., 2015a).

Neurocognitive processing of negation Neu-
roimaging studies show that negated hand action
sentences (e.g., Now I don’t push the button) and
negative imperatives (e.g., Don’t write) involve
decreased activity in motor systems of the brain
compared to the same sentences in the affirmative
context (Tettamanti et al., 2008; Tomasino et al.,
2010). Importantly, Papeo et al. (2016) using
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) provide
evidence that negation of action-related impera-
tives involves an immediate reduction of motor
(cortical-spinal) excitability for negated compared
to affirmative sentences as early as at the initial
semantic access stage. Interestingly, the authors
show that this suppression does not necessarily re-
flect neural inhibition in motor areas in contrast

to prior studies suggesting a link between action
negation and the inhibition of actions (de Vega
et al., 2016).

These findings seem in some regards contrary to
the predictions of linguistic theories of negation.
For example, it has been suggested that, at some
level, negation must involve processing of the af-
firmative situation followed by either its modifi-
cation or rejection (Russell, 1948). Specifically,
Kaup et al. (2007) suggest that the abstract syn-
tactic negation marker may act to reverse the truth
value of a sentence through a two-step simulation
process involving first, a simulation of the affir-
mative situation, and, subsequently, a simulation
of the actual state of affairs, leading eventually to
the suppression of the affirmative situation. While
a few behavioral studies have found evidence in
favor of the idea that negation involves a simula-
tion of the affirmative situation (Kaup et al., 2007),
it has been argued that these effects may be the
result of task-induced cognitive strategies (Papeo
et al., 2016). On the whole, behavioral and neu-
roscientific findings do not paint a complete pic-
ture of negation, but they suggest that access to
some aspects of the affirmative semantic represen-
tation in the brain are being immediately reduced
(or blocked). Given the above, we might expect
to see significant differences in the way in which
the semantic similarity of DSM models for action-
words and sentences is reflected across the brain
areas implicated in action-semantics when com-
paring affirmative and negated actions.

3 Brain Imaging Data

We use the fMRI data by Djokic et al. (forth-
coming), who investigated negation of literal and
metaphoric actions in the brain.

Participants Fifteen healthy adults (8 female,
ages 18 to 35) took part in the study. All subjects
were right-handed, native English speakers.

Stimuli Thirty-one unique hand-action verbs
were used to create 40 affirmative literal (AL),
40 negated literal (NL), 40 affirmative metaphor
(AM), and 40 negated metaphor (NM). Each verb
was repeated once for each condition, except 9
verbs which were repeated twice for each con-
dition. Additionally, 40 affirmative literal para-
phrases of the metaphor were created. All sen-
tences are in the 3rd person singular, present tense,
progressive (Figure 1). Stimuli were created by

guistic variables in a separate experiment.

Experimental Paradigm Subjects were in-
structed to passively read the object of the sen-
tence (e.g. ‘the yellow lemon’), briefly shown on
screen first, followed by the sentence (e.g. ‘She’s
squeezing the lemon’). Catch trials were included
that contained a semantically incongruent object
(e.g., ‘the wooden table’, ‘She’s eating the table’).
Participant’s recall of catch trials (and non-catch)
trials was tested to ensure participants were paying
attention. The object was shown on screen for 2 s,
followed by a 0.5 s interval, then the sentence was
presented for 4 s followed by a rest of 8 s. A total
of 5 runs were completed, each lasting 10.15 min-
utes (3 subjects only completed 4 runs). Stimulus
presentation was pseudo-randomized (i.e., such
that sentences with the same verb were not shown
in succession).

fMRI Data Acquisition fMRI images were ac-
quired with a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3T Sys-
tem with a 32-channel head matrix coil. High-
resolution anatomical scans were acquired with
a structural T1-weighted magnetization prepared
rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) with TR=1950
ms, TE=2.26 ms, flip angle 10◦, 256 × 256
mm matrix, 1 mm resolution, and 208 coro-
nal slices. Whole brain functional images
were obtained with a T2* weighted single-shot
gradient-recalled echo-planar sequence (EPI) us-
ing blood oxygenation-level-dependent contrast
with TR=2000 ms, TE=30 ms, flip angle 90◦,
64 × 64 mm matrix, 3.5 mm resolution. Each
functional image consisted of 37 contiguous axial
slices, acquired in interleaved mode.

4 Semantic models

All our semantic models are based on GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) word embeddings. We use
the 100-dimensional word vectors provided by the
authors, trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword cor-
pora.1 We investigate the following models:

1https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Verb In this model, stimulus phrases are repre-
sented as the individual D-dimensional word em-
beddings of their verb.

Addition This model takes the embeddings of
the verb and object of the phrase, and computes
the phrase representation as their average.

LSTM As a more sophisticated compositional
model, we take the long short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Due to the
lack of a large training set, directly training the
LSTM model for our specific task (i.e. brain de-
coding) was not possible. Instead, we trained the
LSTM on a natural language inference task (Bow-
man et al., 2015a), as it is a complex semantic
task where we expect rich meaning representa-
tions to play an important role. Given two sen-
tences, the goal of natural language inference is to
decide whether the first entails or contradicts the
second, or whether they are unrelated. We used
the LSTM to compute hidden representations for
each sentence, and then used a single-layer per-
ceptron classifier as in Bowman (2016) to predict
the correct relationship. The inputs were the same
100-dimensional word embeddings used for the
other models, and were updated during training.
The model was optimised using Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014). We extracted the 100-dimensional
hidden representations learnt by the LSTM for the
verb-object phrases in our stimulus set.

5 Brain activity decoding

5.1 fMRI data preprocessing

We restricted analysis to the 12 subjects that com-
pleted all runs (3 out of 15 subjects scanned only
completed 4 out of 5 runs). The runs were com-
bined across time to form each subject’s dataset.
The functional data was co-registered with the
MPRAGE structural image, high-pass filtered (90
secs) and motion corrected to the middle slice us-
ing the fMRI software FSL2. Lastly each dataset
was linearly detrended and (baseline) normalized
per run using PyMVPA3.

using the general linear model (GLM) with the
hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor
with PyMVPA. The entire stimulus duration for
each object and action-related sentence was mod-
eled as an event lasting six seconds (3 TRs) after
taking into account the hemodynamic lag. This
gave a response amplitude (Beta) estimate for each
sentence resulting in voxel-wise Beta maps that
were normalized to Z-scores.

Verbs Estimated fMRI patterns were calcu-
lated for each of the thirty-one action-verbs by
combining action-related sentences with the same
action-verb across all stimuli, irrespective of sen-
tence context (All Verbs). Estimated fMRI pat-
terns for action-verbs presented in an affirma-
tive context (Aff Verbs) were obtained by com-
bining only affirmative sentences containing the
same action-verbs. Similarly, fMRI estimates for
action-verbs in a negative context (Neg Verbs)
were obtained by combining negative sentences
containing the same action-verbs. In all three
cases, estimated brain responses for sentences
containing the same action-verbs were averaged
together across runs to yield voxel-wise Z-score
maps for each of the thirty-one verb presenta-
tions and used to perform similarity-based anal-
ysis within each subject’s native functional space.
We performed voxel selection by selecting the top
fifteen percent of voxels that had the highest cor-
relation stability across runs using All Verbs.

Stimulus Phrases Estimated fMRI patterns
for individual action sentences in each condi-
tion (affirmative literal (AL), affirmative metaphor
(AM), negated literal (NL), and negated metaphor
(NM)), were calculated, separately, by modeling
unique action sentences within a condition as sep-
arate events. Analysis was restricted to only sen-
tences within each condition representative of the
31 unique verbs. We performed voxel selection by
selecting the top fifteen percent of voxels with the
greatest correlation stability across runs between
sentences in the specific condition being modeled.

5.3 Definition of Regions of Interest

We selected a priori regions of interest (ROIs)
implicated in action semantics to perform our
analysis. This includes 1) left precentral gyrus
(LPG), implicated in sensorimotor processing
(i.e., motoric features) (Pulvermuller, 2005); 2)
left middle temporal gyrus, posterior (LMTP); 3)
left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), the latter two

matrices. In the study the number of verbs is 31.

implicated in language processing (i.e., lexical-
semantics/syntax) (Fedorenko et al., 2011). ROIs
were created using the Harvard-Oxford Corti-
cal Structural Probabilistic Atlases thresholded at
25% in FSL. Masks were transformed from the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard
space into the subject’s native functional space.

5.4 Representational Similarity Analysis

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) is a
multivariate approach to fMRI data analysis and
avoids model over-fitting and dependence on
learning parameters when dealing with high-
dimensional data (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). It
calculates a global measure comparing the simi-
larity structures of neural and model-based stimuli
representations. The neural and semantic model
vectors are first transformed into an abstracted
similarity space by computing a similarity matrix
from the brain activity vectors (N stimuli × N
stimuli) and a similarity matrix from the semantic
model-based vectors (N stimuli × N stimuli), as
shown in Figure 2. The similarities are computed
using Pearson correlation coefficient as a measure
following Kriegeskorte et al. (2008). The elements
in the neural and semantic correlation matrices are
then converted into correlation distances (1 − r),
leaving zeros in the diagonal. The resulting ma-
trices are referred to as representational dissimi-
larity matrices (RDMs) and indicate the degree to
which conditions can be distinguished from each
other (i.e., distance in high-dimensional similarity
space). An overall (dis)similarity measure is given
by the strength of Spearman’s rank correlation be-
tween the vectorized lower below diagonal trian-
gle of the model RDM and the vectorized lower
below diagonal of the neural RDM giving an over-
all indication of the correspondence between the
representational information carried in the brain
and model. We used a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-



5160

rank test to test whether correlations across sub-
jects were significantly greater than zero. False-
Discovery-Rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995) was used to correct for multiple testing.

5.5 Group-level Similarity-based Decoding

We used similarity-based decoding (Anderson
et al., 2016), based on RSA, to investigate if our
semantic models can decode fMRI patterns of
action-related sentences. In similarity-based de-
coding, neural and semantic models are first each
projected to a similarity space, in the same man-
ner as in RSA, allowing decoding to be performed
in a common unit space. Following Anderson
et al. (2016), we perform leave-two-out decoding
(for n = 31, possible pairs = 465). Given a
pair of stimuli, the neural and semantic similar-
ity codes for each stimulus are obtained by ex-
tracting the relevant labeled column vector from
the neural similarity matrix and the semantic sim-
ilarity matrix, respectively. These similarity codes
are further reduced by removing the entries refer-
ring to that pair, to avoid auto-correlations. These
reduced neural and semantic similarity codes are
then correlated with each other. If the sum of
the correlation coefficients of the correct labeling
scheme (i.e. when the neural and semantic codes
have the same label) has a higher sum of corre-
lation coefficients than the incorrect labeling (i.e.,
when they don’t match) this is counted as a correct
classification, otherwise as incorrect. The decod-
ing accuracy is calculated as the number of correct
classifications over the number of possible pairs.

We performed group-level similarity-based de-
coding in which prior to the decoding step the
neural similarity codes of each subject are aver-
aged together to yield one single group-level neu-
ral similarity code, as in Anderson et al. (2016).
Leave-two-out decoding was then performed us-
ing group-level neural similarity and model-based
similarity codes as described above.

Statistical significance of group-level decoding
accuracies was assessed using permutation test-
ing as in Anderson et al. (2016). The rows and
columns of the model-based correlation matrix
were shuffled to remove relationships between the
stimulus label and its model-based similarity code,
while the neural correlation matrix was held fixed.
Classification accuracies were obtained using the
randomly shuffled data. This procedure was re-
peated 10,000 times to obtain a null distribution of

decoding accuracies, reflecting expected chance-
level accuracies with random labeling. The null
hypothesis is that there is no relationship between
the model-based and the group-level neural sim-
ilarity codes of our stimuli. The p-value for
each accuracy was calculated as the proportion of
scores equal to or larger than that accuracy score.

6 Experiments and Results

6.1 Verb Model

Representational Similarity Analysis We used
RSA to obtain a measure of relatedness between
our fMRI patterns for 31 verbs and the semantic
similarity of the VERB model. We performed a
condition-based analysis, comparing three types
of neural estimates of the verbs: 1) All Verbs,
2) Aff Verbs, and 3) Neg Verbs. We correlated
the RDMs for each condition of the neural esti-
mates of the verbs (All Verbs, Aff Verbs, and
Neg Verbs) separately with the RDM of the VERB
model. Each analysis was performed within the a
priori-defined ROIs (LPG, LIFG, and LMTP).

Significant correlations (greater than zero)
across subjects were found between the dissimilar-
ity structures of the neural estimates for All Verbs
and the VERB model in the LPG (r = 0.04, p <
0.01), LIFG (r = 0.04, p < 0.01), but not the
LMTP (Table 1). Similarly, the Aff Verbs neural
estimates showed significant correlations with the
VERB model in the LPG (r = 0.04, p < 0.01),
LIFG (r = 0.05, p < 0.01) and not the LMTP.
In contrast, we did not find that Neg Verbs trig-
gered any significant correlations with the VERB
model in the ROIs tested. Moreover, Aff Verbs
showed greater overall correlations with the VERB
model when compared to Neg Verbs (as assessed
by two-tailed paired Wilcoxon Sign Rank test)
within the LPG and the LIFG (p < 0.05), but
not the LMTP. These results suggest that (1) the
semantic similarity of the VERB model corre-
lates with fMRI patterns of sentences containing
the same action verb (irrespective of polarity) in
motor (LPG) and the language-related brain re-
gion (LIFG) (2) neural estimates for Neg Verbs
show a reduced sensitivity to the similarity struc-
ture of the VERB model compared to Aff Verbs
in the same ROIs, mainly motor (LPG) and the
language-related brain region (LIFG). This sug-
gests that negation involves reduced access to sen-
sorimotor and lexico-semantic representations as-
sociated with the affirmative representation.

We performed an additional analysis restricted
to nine verbs, for which we had maximal num-
ber of sentences with these same verbs (giving
improved signal to noise ratio). We observed a
stronger but similar pattern with significant corre-
lations for All Verbs in the LPG (r = 0.09, p <
0.05), LIFG (r = 0.05, p < 0.01), and also within
the LMTP (r = 0.07, p < 0.05) (Table 2). Sim-
ilarly, for Aff Verbs we found significant correla-
tions across the LPG (r = 0.09, p < 0.01), LIFG
(r = 0.08, p < 0.01), and also within the LMTP
(r = 0.10, p < 0.01). These results are in line
with work showing semantic category effects for
action-words in brain regions implicated in action-
semantics (Carota et al., 2017), extending this to
action sentences. Similar to the previous analysis,
we did not find any significant correlations with
the Neg Verbs in any of the ROIs tested (Table 2).
In the restricted analysis only the LPG (p < 0.05)
(as opposed to both the LPG and LIFG) showed
greater correlations for Aff Verbs than Neg Verbs
in line with work showing that action negation im-
pacts modal (e.g., motor) areas (Ghio et al., 2018).
Group-level Similarity-based Decoding We
also performed the same condition-based analysis
with group-level similarity-based decoding allow-
ing us to observe systematic patterns across sub-
jects, more generally. Table 3 shows the decod-
ing accuracy obtained for each ROI at the group-
level in the condition-based analysis. Overall,
findings are in line with the RSA results with sig-
nificant decoding accuracies found for All Verbs
in the LPG (Acc = 0.72, p < 0.01) and LIFG

LIFG, we observed significant decoding within the
LMTP for Neg Verbs (Acc = 0.64, p < 0.05).
The above finding coupled with the fact that in the
RSA analysis we never observed significant cor-
relation differences between Neg Verbs and Aff
Verbs in the LMTP, may suggest that this area is
less impacted by polarity.

6.2 Addition and LSTM Models

Group-level Similarity-Based Decoding As an
exploratory component to our study we also per-
formed group-level similarity-based decoding for
the 31 sentences that each contained a unique
verb for each condition type (i.e., AL, NL, AM,
NM), separately, allowing us to assess the abil-
ity of compositional semantic models (ADDITION
and LSTM models) to decode different kinds of
negated and affirmative sentences. We observed
that the ADDITION model showed significant de-
coding in the LPG (Acc = 0.64, p < 0.05) and
LIFG (Acc = 0.65, p < 0.05) for the affirmative
literal condition (AL) but not in the the negated
condition (NL) (Table 4). Interestingly, while we
found significant decoding accuracies for the affir-
mative metaphor condition (AM) in the LPG and
LMTP, we also observed significant decoding ac-
curacies for the negated metaphor condition (NM)
within the LPG (Acc = 0.70, p < 0.01) and LIFG
(Acc = 0.64, p < 0.05). For the LSTM model we
showed significant decoding in the LPG for the af-
firmative literal condition (AL) (Acc = 0.67, p <
0.05) and affirmative metaphoric condition (AM)
(Acc = 0.73, p < 0.01) but not for the negated
conditions (NL, NM) (Table 5). Significant de-
coding was also found in the LMTP but only for
the AM condition (Acc = 0.70, p < 0.01). The
results suggest reduced decoding for the negated
as compared to affirmative literal conditions pri-
marily in sensorimotor brain areas in line with our
previous RSA findings at the verb-level with more
mixed results for the LIFG and LMTP. Given that
we observed that the ADDITION model appears to
be sensitive to negated metaphoric actions within
the LPG and LIFG, suggests this may not be the

7 Discussion

Representational similarity analysis showed that
the semantic similarity structure provided by
the VERB model corresponded well with neu-
ral similarity of sentences containing the same
action-verbs (All Verbs) within motor (LPG) and
language-related brain regions (LIFG, LMTP),
both implicated in action-semantic processing
(Pulvermuller, 2005). Crucially, when looking
at the specific impact of sentential context we
found that the fMRI response patterns for negated
action-verbs (Neg Verbs) showed significantly re-
duced correlations with the VERB model than
the affirmative action-verbs (Aff Verbs) mainly in
the LPG and LIFG. Similarly, when performing
a group-level similarity-based decoding analysis,
we also found evidence suggesting reduced de-
coding accuracies for Neg Verbs compared to Aff
Verbs within the LPG and LIFG. Taken together,
these findings provide support to previous neuro-
scientific studies that suggest that negation man-
ifests foremost as reduced access to motor areas
implicated in coding sensorimotor features of ac-
tion verbs (Tettamanti et al., 2008; Tomasino et al.,
2010; Papeo et al., 2016). However, they also pro-
vide compelling evidence in support of the idea
that the modulatory impact of negation may ex-
tend to areas of the language-network. Lastly, our
experiments with compositional models show that
some of these effects may carry over to more com-
plex models.

Our RSA findings for All Verbs (and also Aff
Verbs) are consistent with the work of Carota et al.
(2017) who showed that an LSA model reflecting
semantic category information about both verbs

and objects associated with actions (e.g., tools and
foods) significantly correlated with the similarity
of fMRI patterns for verbs and objects in the LPG
and LIFG (and to a lesser extent the LMTP). When
this analysis was restricted to only action verbs,
the LIFG was predominantly sensitive to the se-
mantic similarity of action verbs. It is likely that
our results for All Verbs (irrespective of polar-
ity) are more closely aligned with their results for
verbs and objects associated with actions, given
that our action verbs were presented in a sentence
context that included information about the object.

Notably, we found a modulatory impact of
negation in both sensorimotor (LPG) and to some
extent the language-related brain region (LIFG).
The LIFG has been implicated in lexical-semantic
similarity in the brain but also in the selection
of competing semantic alternatives (Thompson-
Schill et al., 1997; Carota et al., 2017). For ex-
ample, the LIFG may be important for event pre-
diction, such as knowing which words (objects or
tools) are implied by a given action verb (Carota
et al., 2017). This provides further support to the
hypothesis that negation involves reduced access
to the affirmative mental representation. Impor-
tantly, this involves not only reduced access to mo-
toric features, but also access to lexico-semantic
relations in language-related brain regions.

The LMTP may have been less impacted by ac-
tion negation as it is more closely associated with
higher-level object processing (Devereux et al.,
2013) and, therefore, possibly captures less of
the overall semantic variance associated with any
given action verb. Moreover, in our study we fo-
cused on neural estimates of action verbs irrespec-
tive of their specific objects. Thus, the LPG and
LIFG may more closely reflect action-semantic
variance and show a greater modulatory effect of
negation. However, given that similarity-based
analysis is sensitive to the semantic distance of the
stimuli in question, future work should investigate
polarity decoding with verb-object phrases with
maximal semantic-variance (e.g., action verbs as-
sociated with distinct effectors and object-directed
goals).

Lastly, when testing compositional models we
also observed that significant decoding accuracies
were predominantly found in motor areas (LPG)
for affirmative conditions. Interestingly, we did
observe an exception to this for negated action-
verbs that were also used in a metaphorical con-



5163

text, possibly suggesting that compositional mod-
els are better able to capture motor features asso-
ciated with metaphorical meanings on the whole,
but this would need further investigation.

Our main finding of a modulatory impact
of negation on motor but also to some extent
language-related brain regions is in line with the
earlier work of Tettamanti et al. (2008) who found
a reduction in activations within left-hemispheric
frontal-temporal-parietal areas implicated in the
representation of actions for negative compared
to positive action sentences, but see (Ghio et al.,
2018). Importantly, however, our results do not
rule out the possibility that other brain regions may
correlate with the VERB model. Recent neurosci-
entific work suggests that negation not only modu-
lates modality-specific brain regions but also brain
areas implicated in syntactic processing and cog-
nitive control (Ghio et al., 2018). It is possible that
prefrontal areas implicated in control and work-
ing memory may act as an intermediate stage in
charge of assigning polarity and temporarily hold
a representation of the affirmative situation. We
are currently investigating this possibility through
a whole-brain searchlight analysis, but note that
the temporal resolution of fMRI may possibly hin-
der detection of any intermediate processing steps.

In this study we provide support for the idea
that negation may be mediated in part by reduc-
ing (or blocking) access to aspects of the affir-
mative representation. This may provide a ‘de-
fault’ negation meaning (Papeo et al., 2016), as
well as allow competing or cooperating semantic
alternatives to emerge. On the other hand, it is
also possible that the results reflect a more ‘cat-
egorical’ representation of negation and that the
current semantic models are merely not a suit-
able represenation for the negated meaning. Fu-
ture work will need to understand the mechanisms
by which negation modulates semantic similarity
and lexico-semantic relations in brain regions im-
plicated in action-semantics and how this gives
rise to a negated meaning. It would be interesting
to test alternate models for negation that can si-
multaneously explain, for example, why the verb
‘grasping’ has a more crystallized meaning than its
negation ‘not grasping’, whose meaning may also
depend to a greater extent on the specific linguistic
(or extralinguistic) context.

A fruitful avenue of research may be to inves-
tigate the extent to which contextual representa-

tions of LSTM models in the context of a sen-
timent classification task can be used to predict
fMRI activations for positive versus negative af-
fective phrases. Predicting sentiment is intimately
tied to polarity (e.g., ‘good’ versus ‘not good’)
and the relationship between affective words and
their negated counterparts near orthogonal. Prior
work shows the role of LSTM gates in modeling
negation in sentiment prediction in part by locally
minimizing the input of the negated affective word
(Wang et al., 2015), providing insight into the role
of learned contextual information in building the
negated meaning. The sentiment test case may of-
fer a means to measure how changes in contextual
representations relevant to the semantic modeling
of negation can contribute directly to predicting
brain activity associated with negation processing.

Alternatively, Kruszewski et al. (2017) show
that conversational negation can be modeled with
a distributional approach, acting like a ‘graded
similarity function’ that prompts a search for
‘similar’ alternative meanings. Although prior
psycholinguistics work on negation consistently
shows evidence to suggest that negation reduces
access to the affirmative representation, at least
one study showed that this is not the case for enti-
ties semantically related to the negated represen-
tation (MacDonald and Just, 1989). This more
closely aligns with the idea that some dimensions
of the affirmative representation are being pro-
cessed while others reduced, possibly due to com-
peting semantic alternatives. Thus, future work
should also investigate whether modeling negation
as a set of alternative meanings can further show
the impact of negation on semantic representation
in the brain.

8 Conclusion

In our work, we show for the first time that senso-
rimotor and to some extent language-related brain
regions that correlate with distributional semantic
models of action verbs may be impacted by nega-
tion. We also show that this effect may extend
to more complex compositional models (in motor
brain regions). Our work paves the way towards
understanding the extent to which human mean-
ing representation is impacted by negation. This
finding can in turn inform the design of distribu-
tional models dealing with verb negation, for in-
stance when modelling negation as a space of al-
ternative meanings.
