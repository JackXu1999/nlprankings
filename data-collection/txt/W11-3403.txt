Abstract

The Bantay-Wika (Language Watch)
project was started in 1994 by the Uni-
versity of the Philippines (UP) - Sentro
ng Wikang Filipino1 (SWF) in order to
track for long periods of time how the
Philippine national language is being used
and how it develops, particularly in the
Philippine media. The first phase of this
project, from 1994 to 2004, involved the
manual collection and tallying of fre-
quency counts for all the words in eleven
major Philippine tablods. With increasing
online presence of Philippine news organi-
zations, the project was revived in March
2010, with UP-SWF partnering with UP
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP) labo-
ratory. The project objectives were also
re-drafted to include the development of
software that would automate the process
of downloading of Filipino news articles.
In this paper, we further detail the goals
and the history and of the Bantay-Wika
project, its accomplishments and plans
for future work. The project ultimately
endeavors to build a computational model
for language development that can guide
language policy makers in a multi-lingual
country such as the Philippines, in drafting
policies that can effectively promote the
use and development of their national
language.

1 Introduction

The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 is-
lands with 171 living languages spoken by 94 mil-
lion inhabitants2, thus making it the 25th most

1‘Sentro ng Wikang Filipino’ means ‘Filipino Language
Center’

2Projected population of Filipinos for 2010 according to
the National Statistics Office of the Republic of the Philip-

linguistically diverse nation in the world among
224 nations in the 16th edition Ethnologue (2009)
(Lewis, 2009). Based on the 2000 census con-
ducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO),
there are 14 major languages3 spoken in the coun-
try, listed next in order of decreasing number of
speakers: (1) Tagalog, (2) Cebuano Bisayan, (3)
Ilokano, (4) Hiligaynon Bisayan, (5) Waray (East-
ern Bisayan), (6) Kapampangan, (7) Northern Bi-
col, (8) Chavacano, (9) Pangasinense, (10) South-
ern Bicol, (11) Maranao, (12) Maguindanao, (13)
Kinaray-a, and (14) Tausug (Roxas et al., 2009).
With such a rich Philippine linguistic profile, it is
not hard to understand how difficult it must have
been when in 1935, then president Manuel L. Que-
zon pushed for the establishment and development
of language to be commonly spoken by all of the
inhabitants. In the years that followed, laws have
been enacted to support such cause, leading to
the establishment of a national language institute
tasked to identify and select the basis of the na-
tional language from the list of Philippine native
languages, and to further develop the national lan-
guage into a modernized and intellectualized one.
Table 1 lists a brief timeline showing some mile-
stones related to the development of the Philippine
national language.

It is worth noting that the issues concerning the
Philippine national language have initially been
controversial and divisive, especially in the so-
called language wars of the 1960’s, when Senate
representatives who speak the Cebuano Bisayan
language challenged the selection of Tagalog lan-
guage as the basis of the national language (Gon-
zalez, 2003). During those times until now, efforts
were made to differentiate the national language
from its original Tagalog base, through conscious
revisions of the grammar and orthography rules

lion speakers.

to incorporate elements from other Philippine lan-
guages (Santos, 1940; Surian ng Wikang Pam-
bansa [SWP], 1976; SWP, 1987; Komisyon sa
Wikang Filipino [KWF], 2001; UP Sentro ng
Wikang Filipino [UPSWF], 2004; UPSWF, 2008;
KWF, 2009), and by renaming the national lan-
guage, first as Pilipino in 1959, then as Filipino in
19874 in order to garb it with more sense of na-
tional appeal. Almost a quarter-century after the
idea of a national language was first floated, lin-
guists and language planners are wondering how
far the Filipino language has developed and where
it is headed, knowing that in a multi-lingual so-
ciety such as the Philippines, it is possible that a
language may retrogress and die despite sincere
efforts to develop and propagate its proper use to
the rest of the population (Abrams and Strogatz,
2003). In this light, effective monitoring activi-
ties of the extent and quality of actual usage of
the national language by its community of users is
deemed important.

2 The Bantay-Wika Project

Cognizant of the importance of the national lan-
guage in fostering national unity and identity, the
University of the Philippines felt it is duty-bound
to actively participate in the discussions on lan-
guage development. Hence, the UP - Sentro ng
Wikang Filipino was created in 1990. Realizing
the value of quantitavely observing the dynamics
of the Filipino language usage in ascertaining the
trajectory of Filipino language development, the

4The official name of the Philippine national language is
Filipino.

UP-SWF started the Bantay-Wika project in 1994.
This project initially sought to observe the rates
with which new words were being introduced in
the Filipino working vocabulary, as evidenced in
the tabloid media. Filipino-written articles from
eleven tabloids5 with wide circulation were tran-
scribed on a weekly basis, and a database of word
frequency counts was manually built.

2.1 Tracking of competing word forms

Ferguson (1968) noted that as a language devel-
ops, it undergoes a process of standardisation by
means of conventionalization of its function and
use within a given language community . Guided
by this language developmental framework, the
Bantay-Wika project also seeks to observe how
the Filipino language conventionalizes, by com-
paring usage rates of competing word forms. One
particular class of competing word forms actually
tracked in the project are borrowed words from
other languages, mainly from Spanish and Ameri-
can English languages, owing to the influence that
Spain and USA have on the Philippine society as
its long-time settlers. A cursory look into Filipino-
written articles would show that many of the terms
used in daily news reportage which have equiva-
lent translations in either English or Spanish man-
ifest in any of four possible ways: (1) direct bor-
rowing, (2) calquing or loan-translation, (3) Filip-
inization of spelling, and (4) use of a native word.
Table 2 shows examples of each of the four ways
of improvising Filipino words with foreign equiv-
alents.

Other classes of competing word forms are
spelling variants that fall under the cases listed
in Table 3. Towards the end of the first phase of
Bantay-Wika (year 2001 to 2004), software that
can process the gathered text corpora and pro-
duce summarized reports of word counts was de-
veloped. The reports are then manually inspected
to identify spelling variants. This process resulted
in over 957 words tracked, of which 85 pairs were
identified as spelling variants.

Filipino - written news articles

The topics that a group of people write about re-
flect their prevailing sentiments at any given time

frame. Hence, it is possible to study cultural
trends based on quantitative analysis of large cor-
pora of digitized text, a field of study called Cul-
turomics. Using normalized frequency plots of
specific search words and phrases, Michel et al.
(2011) were able to investigate cultural trends in
fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution
of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of
technology, the pursuit of fame, censorhip, and
historical epidemiology. Inspired by these re-
cent developments in Culturomics, we wanted to
gain more insights into the dynamics of topics
that interest Filipinos, using news corpora curated
from websites of two popular Philippine tabloids.
Articles were downloaded using a web-crawler
from the websites of Abante6 and Abante-tonite7

within a two-year window period from March 22,
2009 to May 16, 2011. Each downloaded html-
file was then automatically date-stamped by pars-
ing its URL for date information, and then pre-
processed by removing markup tags and scripts.

After which, the resulting text-files were each
word-tokenized and content-modified by lining up
sentences one after the other. Metadata for the
unannotated Abante and Abante-Tonite text cor-
pora include URL, publication date and download
date information. Table 4 describes the sizes of
the Abante and Abante-tonite news text corpora.
Figure 1 shows a graph of the number of down-
loaded articles per day for the entire observation
period. Note the gaps in the dates of downloaded
data for both Abante and Abante-tonite, indicating
that not all dates have available downloadable data
from the corresponding websites within the 2-year
analysis period.

Data from Filipino-written news articles cov-
ering a 2-year analysis period from March 2009
to May 2011 was used to support the Culturomic
analysis presented in this paper. Bantay-Wika,
however, is a current project of UP-DSP and UP-
SWF, with ongoing data collection efforts from
Philippine news websites. The results will be pub-
lished after the project has been completed. In-
tellectual Property rights for the text corpora are
owned by the University of the Philippines - Dili-
man and data wil be made available to researchers
for free except for requesting parties intending to
use them for commercial purposes.

The normalized frequency value of a given
search word for a particular date was obtained by
dividing the total number of sentences wherein a
search word was seen at least once, with the total
number of sentences obtained for the given date.
Normalized frequency plots for particular search

words/phrases have revealed interesting insights
into the Filipino culture, as seen in the succeed-
ing graphs. Note that the search process used for
all the search words is case-insensitive.

2.2.1 Investigating the actual duration of
Filipino Christmas season

The Philippines, being a predominantly Catholic
Christian nation, celebrates the longest Christ-
mas season in the world, starting from the on-
set of September and continuing until the feast
of the Sto. Niño celebrated every third Sunday
of January of the next year. Counting the num-
ber of times the words ‘Christmas’ and ‘Pasko’8

were mentioned in news media, whether by sim-
ple greetings or actual news reportage over a long
time period can give us an idea of how intensely
Filipinos celebrate Christmas. Figure 2 shows
the normalized frequency plots for search words
‘Christmas’ and ‘Pasko’. The plots show annual
repeating patterns, with the initial peak found at
beginning of September. The next significant peak
is on the first day of December, slowly increasing
to its peak on December 25, then sharply decreas-
ing by the first week of January. Hence, it can
be said that a typical Filipino’s excitement over
the thought of Christmas is triggered by certain
events: (1) the entry of September which is the
first of the ‘-Ber’ months leading to Christmas, (2)
the entry of December, the month of Christmas,
and (3) the actual day of Christmas.

2.2.2 Investigating the effect of Typhoon
Ondoy

On September 24, 2009, the Philippines’ capital of
Manila was inundated with floods when it was vis-
ited by Super Typhoon Ondoy (international code
name: Ketsana). Images and videos of flood and
devastation filled the storylines of news agencies
all over the world and in various online social net-
working sites for many weeks. Many professed
Ondoy to be a natural disaster that will never be
erased in the collective Filipino memory. Look-
ing at graph of normalized frequency plots for the
search word ‘Ondoy’ of Figure 3, we see quite a
different story. Approximately one month after
Ondoy visited, news reportage has almost com-
pletely subsided. It can be seen that exactly one
year later, news reporting on the topic Ondoy was
only slightly revived.

8Pasko is the Filipino word for ‘Christmas’

2.2.3 Tracking the rise of popularity of the
Ampatuans

Figure 4 shows the normalized frequency plots
when the search word is ‘Ampatuan’. Data shows
that the Ampatuans were relatively under the me-
dia radar before the Nov. 23, 2009 massacre of
57 civilians and media people in Maguindanao. It
was widely believed that the massacre was mas-
terminded by the heads of the Ampatuan clan, in
order to deter their political foe, Ismael Manguda-
datu from running against them in the May, 2010
national elections. The next significant peak near
Apr. 19, 2010 is when DOJ Acting Secretary Agra
absolved the Ampatuans, resulting in an immedi-
ate public outrage. The plots clearly show that

since the day of the massacre, the Ampatuans have
consistently remained to be a favorite news fodder
for the Philippine media.

2.2.4 Looking at an example of a linguistic
fad

The normalized frequency plot of a linguistic fad
such as ‘Jejemon’ (see Figure 5) shows a quick
rise, followed by a period of relatively stable fre-
quency plot, but ending with an abrupt fall of
mentions in news and media articles. Of all the
words that qualified as finalists for the Sawikaan
2010 Word of the year sponsored by the UP-SWF,
only namumutbol did not have at least 1 entry in
the Data Set. The rest of the word finalists for

2.2.5 Looking at an example of an enduring
Filipino news item

Refer to Figure 6 to see the plot for the search
phrase ‘Cory Aquino’. Former Philippine Presi-
dent Cory Aquino, who was the transitory pres-
ident after 26 years of Marcos dictatorship, has
again been relatively popular in media news start-
ing with rumors of her showing signs of succumb-
ing to colon cancer early July of 2009, with re-
ports peaking on the week of her death on August
1, 2009. Her first death anniversary shows strong
public commemoration. Cory Aquino‘s popular-
ity has remained consistent throughout the whole

year.

3 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have described the Bantay-Wika
project: it’s goals, history, accomplishments and
plans for future work. Aimed at helping language
planners in attaining the goal of standardizing the
use of the Philippine national language, Bantay-
Wika is first and foremost seen as an objective and
effective monitoring mechanism for tracking ac-
tual language use. Allowing the conventionaliza-
tion phenomenon that characterizes the develop-
ment of a language to be tracked over time en-
ables language agencies such as the UP-SWF to
test the effectiveness of their rolled out language

policies and strategies, and design appropriate in-
terventions that would aid strategies that turn out
to be ineffective. In this regard, one strong moti-
vation behind the Bantay-Wika project is to ulti-
mately develop computational models for linguis-
tic change, thus allowing language policy makers
to reliably forecast the trajectory of language de-
velopment for each language policy being imple-
mented. Secondly, culturomic analysis of down-
loaded news articles covering a two-year period
has provided us with more insights into the Fil-
ipino Christmas tradition, the Filipino outlook in
the face of natural and man-made calamities that
has attracted global attention, and linguistic fads.
Observing the fluctuations in the intensity of news
reportage of topics that have pervaded the Philip-

pine national consciousness has given us an objec-
tive view of the favorite topics of Filipinos, per-
haps a reflection of the values that Filipinos collec-
tively hold dear. Efforts are currently being made
to increase the coverage of the text corpora to in-
clude written work representative of each stage
of the Philippine nation’s colorful history start-
ing from the 1900’s to the present. With larger
and more comprehensive text corpora, the authors
are hopeful that more insights into how the Fil-
ipino sentiment changes with each milestone in the
Philippines’ history will be made apparent, thus
offering a fresh look at Philippine history in a way
not possible before. Finally, the data, the tools
for analysis developed for this project, and the
actual research findings open up different oppor-

16



tunities for conducting further quantitative inves-
tigative work in the areas of Philippine lexicog-
raphy and diachronic linguistics, and even aid in
the further understanding of Filipino philosophy.
Truly, it can be said that in the case of the Bantay-
Wika project, the use of technology has greatly ex-
panded the reaches of scholarly inquiry.
