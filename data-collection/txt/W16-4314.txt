Abstract 

 A growing body of research exploits social media behaviors to gauge psychological character-

istics, though trait empathy has received little attention. Because of its intimate link to the abil-

ity to relate to others, our research aims to predict participants’ levels of empathy, given their 

textual and friending behaviors on Facebook. Using Poisson regression, we compared the vari-

ance explained in Davis’ Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) scores on four constructs (em-

pathic concern, personal distress, fantasy, perspective taking), by two classes of variables: 1) 

post content and 2) linguistic style. Our study lays the groundwork for a greater understanding 

of empathy’s role in facilitating interactions on social media. 

1 Introduction 

Empathy is an important component of social cognition that contributes to one’s ability to understand 

and respond to the emotions of others, to succeed in emotional communication, and to promote pro-

social behavior (Spreng, 2009). We explore the correlations between participants’ levels of the various 

types of trait empathy, and their digital traces at Facebook, representing social media activities. To 

date, empathy has received little attention from social media and human factors researchers. Some 

work has been done toward understanding “empathic design” of online support communities (Bren-

nan, Moore, & Smyth, 1991), (Tetzlaff, 1997), (Brennan & Ripich, 1994). However, surprisingly, em-

pathy in social media in the context of day-to-day conversations or messaging has not been well stud-

ied.  

 

In this work, we conceptualize empathy as a trait, operationalizing it within the context of our study. 

In the next subsections, we highlight the intimate relationship between empathy, communication, and 

friendship patterns, and present hypotheses to be tested. Finally, we explain why users’ writing pat-

terns are expected to provide a source of information with respect to their underlying levels of empa-

thy, detailing our hypotheses of interest. We test these hypotheses by fitting the Poisson regression 

model with each IRI score as the outcome variable and a set of explanatory variables suitable for each 

hypothesis. 

1.1 Davis’ IRI 

Davis’ IRI (Davis, 1983) is a measure of trait empathy that considers a set of four distinct but related 

constructs. Each of the four subscales of the IRI—empathic concern (EC), fantasy subscale (FS), per-

spective taking (PT) and personal distress (PD)—was assessed with seven items on a five-point Likert

scale (1 = does not describe me well to 5 = describes me very well). The subscales that pertain to cog-

nitive dimensions of empathy are the FS and the PT subscale. They measure the tendency to get 

caught up in fictional stories and imagine oneself in the same situations as fictional characters, and the 

tendency to take the psychological point of view of others, respectively. The EC and PD subscales 

measure the affective dimensions of empathy. Specifically, the EC measures sympathy and concern 

for others and is typically considered as an other-oriented emotional response in which attention is 

directed to the person in distress (Schroeder, et al, 1988). The PD scale considers a self-oriented emo-

tional response in which attention is directed at one’s negative emotions of distress and the reduction 

of these negative emotions. The IRI has demonstrated good intra-scale and test-retest reliability, and 

convergent validity is indicated by correlations with other established empathy scales (Davis, 1983). 

1.2 Empathy in Social Media 

Scholars such as Rogers (2003) have noted the abilities of highly empathic individuals to influence 

the opinions of others. This could also be the case in the context of social media, although it is unclear 

whether or not measures such as an individual’s network size and frequency and types of activities 

could reflect this. On Facebook in particular, establishing a friendship is a mutual decision, meaning 

that both sides must confirm it in order to be connected. Intuitively, we can say that the creation of a 

“friendship” on Facebook is an indication that individuals are open to sharing with others. A previous 

study performed on a large and diverse dataset of Facebook participants in Bachrach et al. (2012) 

found significant relationships between their personality traits and the size and density of their friend-

ship network, and their activity online. Kang and Lerman (2015) explored user effort and content di-

versity in social networks, with a commentary on cognitive constraints in social network activity. Giv-

en that little work on empathy in the social media literature, we found it necessary to establish the 

baseline relationship (if any) between network size, activity, and trait empathy.  

 

H1a: The size of one’s friendship network is correlated to her levels of empathy. 

 

H1b: A user’s level of activity (i.e., amount of written text) is correlated to her levels of empathy. 

 

While level of activity depends on one’s network size, there is also reason to believe that in some cas-

es, people with smaller networks may engage actively with their close friends, thus producing higher 

levels of activity than those with a larger network. Therefore, we also examine the relationship be-

tween level of activity and empathy. 

 

 

1.3 Empathy and writing patterns 

The widespread use of writing therapy by psychologists (Pennebaker, 1997) confirms the tight rela-

tionship between writing characteristics and aspects of the self, such as empathy. We believe that the 

level of one’s empathy influences one’s writing. Therefore, we analyzed written content (in the form 

of posts and comments) in order to distinguish between users with different levels of empathy. Previ-

ous research (Pennebaker and King, 1999), (Mairesse and Walker, 2008) concluded that linguistic 

style is an independent and meaningful way of exploring personality and there is a strong correlation 

between language dimensions, measured by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), and per-

sonality factors. Our analysis focuses on LIWC Psychological (i.e., content) and Linguistic (i.e., style) 

measures (see Table 2), to test the following hypotheses: 

 

H2a: Users whose social media texts express more socially oriented content are more empathic. 

 

H2b: Users whose social media texts exhibit linguistic styles that engage others are more empathic.

2 Methodology 

2.1 Data collection and preprocessing 

We developed a Facebook application (“app”) in order to carry out the following phases of our data 

collection: capturing each participant’s digital traces during the previous 30 months, and administering 

a standardized test that measures different types of trait empathy. We analyzed participants’ levels of 

trait empathy using Davis’ IRI.
1
 

 

The app captured participants’ profile (upon their agreement), including the full list of their Facebook 

friends. In addition, the app tracked users’ recent social activities: with whom and how frequently they 

interacted through “likes,” “shares,” and “comments” to others’ posts. Then, the participant was 

prompted to complete the IRI. The participant could also invite friends to complete the survey and be-

come new participants. As such, we employed an opportunistic sampling and snowballing method. 

Table 1 describes attributes that were collected while Figure 1 depicts the app flowchart.  

 

In order to describe participants’ language behaviors, we considered all textual communication (i.e., 

posts on one’s own Facebook wall and comments left on the walls of others) that occurred during the 

previous 30 months. We used LIWC, which analyzes a text by counting word occurrences in psycho-

logically meaningful categories such as negative versus positive emotion, or social versus cognitive 

processes (Pennebaker, Francis, & Booth, 2001). At the same time, LIWC computes attributes of lin-

guistic style (e.g., the use of punctuation, the extent to which first-, second-, and third-person pronouns 

are used), otherwise known as stylometric features (Brizan, et al, 2015). Each participant’s set of texts 

was processed using LIWC, in order to obtain scores on six psychological (i.e., content) measures, 

described in Table 2, and ten linguistic (i.e., style) measures. The style features included the partici-

pant’s total word count and the mean number of words per post. Finally, we considered the proportion 

of words used belonging to each of the following categories: pronouns, verbs, adverbs, auxiliary (i.e., 

“helping”) verbs, quantifiers, numbers, swearing, and punctuation.

2.1.1 Participants 

A total of 334 Facebook users participated in the study. In the current analysis, we considered only 

the users who posted in English, such that their traces could be analyzed via LIWC, and who complet-

ed the IRI. We also restricted the dataset to include only individuals whose profiles indicated that they 

were 65 years old or younger. This was to ensure the integrity of the data. We did not filter short posts 

and did not distinguish between users using few words and ones using many words. 

 

After applying the aforesaid restrictions, a total of 202 complete profiles were available for the analy-

sis. Of these, 167 participants (82.7%) were female, with mean and median ages of 39.3 and 36.0 

years, respectively. This gender imbalance can likely be attributed to the manner by which we incen-

tivized participation. It is well established that there are gender-based differences with respect to em-

pathy. Specifically, women reportedly score higher than men on all four subscales of the IRI (Davis, 

1980). Therefore, in our analyses, we included gender as a control variable. 

 

As expected, the distributions of the total number of friends as well as two measures of attention re-

ceived from others (the number of likes received and the number of words commented on users’ posts) 

were skewed to the right. The mean and median numbers of friends among participants were 304.1 

and 238.5, respectively, while the mean and median numbers of likes per post were 16.3 and 13.0, re-

spectively. Participants received a mean of 636, and a median of 257 words, in the comments posted 

by their friends.  

2.1.2 Trait empathy 

We considered our participants’ scores on the four IRI scales by gender, given that previous studies 

report salient gender differences. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test reveals that, compared to male 

participants, females score significantly higher on measures of empathic concern and fantasy. Howev-

er, no significant gender differences were revealed with respect to perspective-taking and personal dis-

tress. These gender differences are somewhat in line with previous research that has reported greater 

trait empathy overall (i.e., all IRI subscales) among women (Davis, 1980). As mentioned, we retain 

gender as a control variable in our regression analyses. 

131



 

Figure 2: Distribution of IRI scores. 

As shown in Figure 2, the median IRI scores for participants is as follows (men / women): EC (20 / 

26), FS (18.5 / 24), PD (14.5 and 15), and PT (20 / 23). 

 

2.2 Data analysis 

In order to examine the relationship between users’ Facebook behaviors and their trait empathy, we 

used Poisson regression models. Specifically, for each of the four IRI scores, we fit four models, in 

order to explore the explanatory power of four sets of variables: 

 

● Control: Participant gender and age only; 
● Model 1: The content of users’ posts, namely, psychological processes exhibited in the text (so-

cial, affective, cognitive mechanisms, perception, biological, relativity); 

● Model 2: The linguistic style of posts, namely, linguistic characteristics (total word count, words 
per post, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, quantifiers, numbers, swearing, punctuation); 

● Model 3: Measures of users’ friendship network (namely, number of total friends and likes). 

2.2.1 Poisson regression model 

The Poisson regression model is a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Such models use the 

logarithm link function in order to correlate the model predictors (explanatory variables) to the out-

come variable, which is an expected frequency (incidence). In our case, the outcome variable is the 

IRI score, which ranges from 0 to 28 for each of the four subscales. The estimation of the Poisson 

models was conducted using the R statistical computing package
2
. For each of the models, we estimate 

the parameter and statistical significance of each explanatory variable. In addition, we gauged the de-

gree to which the variance in the dependent variable (i.e., the level of empathy as measured by the rel-

evant IRI score) is explained by the set of explanatory variables. To this end, we use Mittlböck’s ad-

justed R
2
, which is appropriate for evaluating Poisson regression models (Mittlböck, 2002).

3 Results and discussion 

Table 3 shows that gender is correlated to three subscales of empathy. Specifically, female participants 

display higher levels of empathic concern, fantasy, and personal distress. Age is negatively correlated 

to the level of personal distress. In all three cases, the control variables do not explain a good deal of 

variance in the IRI scores. In the case of empathic concern, gender alone explains 13% of the variabil-

ity (i.e., the R
2
 of the model with gender as the only explanatory variable is 0.13).

Focusing on the model that includes the content of users’ posts, we see an improvement in the explan-

atory power of our Poisson model for each of the four subscales of empathy (over the control model), 

as can be seen from Table 4. However, the most significant improvements are for EC and PT. Gender 

and social psychological processes in users’ text account for just over 20% of the variance in EC 

score. In particular, female participants and those whose posts are more social (i.e., make references to 

people, friends and family) tend to score higher on the empathy scale of the IRI. This is expected, giv-

en that a user’s attentional focus when using social processes within their text is likely to be oriented 

to others, which is encapsulated in the other-oriented empathic concern subscale. Likewise, the social 

and perception processes are significant correlates of the PT score. PT is a measure of the dispositional 

ability to consider the perspective of others.

Thus, using language relating to social processes would likely enable users to take the perspective of 

others; they need information about their communication partner to take their perspective. Unsurpris-

ingly, language referring to perceptual processes significantly correlates to trait PT. In order to take 

the perspective of another (i.e., to understand the issues, thoughts, and feelings of others) one needs to 

use perceptual processes. That said, the effect sizes are rather small to draw any definitive conclusions 

regarding the H2a. 

 

Table 5 shows that for all four subscales of empathy, adding the stylistic characteristics of users’ texts 

increases the proportion of variance explained. Interestingly, the use of auxiliary verbs significantly 

correlates to both greater cognitive and affective empathy (i.e., all IRI subscales), while pronouns sig-

nificantly correlate to FS and PT. The fact that the number of words per post is significantly correlated 

to greater PD could refer to a need to express oneself (e.g., an opinion, complaint or need). However, 

133



the fact that the word counts of the participant’s posts or comments are not correlated to other empathy 

measures approves that, in general, H1b is not supported. 

 

A possible explanation can be found in Bachrach et al (2012)’s work, where all Big Five personality 

traits have demonstrated correlation to the activity level of users in Facebook, expressed by number of 

likes, uploaded photos, statuses, and more. It was found that extroverts are more likely to reach out 

and interact with other people on Facebook. Given that word counts of posts or comments are also 

self-generated content, it is arguably possible that a greater volume of written words is reflective of a 

more extroverted personality trait. However, there is no direct correlation between empathy and extra-

version trait (Magalhães et al., 2012).

We observed a number of correlations between linguistic styles and empathy measures. Importantly, 

the use of pronouns is positively correlated with PT and FS, but negatively correlated with PD. The 

regular use of pronouns might indicate that a user is switching perspectives frequently within a ses-

sion, which would in turn exercise perspective taking skills. Although communication partners are 

real, as opposed to a character in a novel, there is still a barrier between the user and his or her com-

munication partner because they are not physically face-to-face. In a sense, this type of communica-

tion is surreal and may require some fantasy. Interestingly, the use of auxiliary verbs such as am, will, 

or have, is positively correlated with all empathy measures. Auxiliary verbs add functional meaning to 

the clause in which the auxiliary verb appears and thus can express tense and emphasis among other 

meanings. Therefore, these words function to create a more vivid sense of an action, which conse-

quently would exercise more mental imagery. The use of our mental imagination capacities is inherent 

in the FS and PT subscales.  

 

Further, greater words per post significantly correlating to greater personal distress could refer to a 

need to express oneself. Feelings of personal distress are uncomfortable and someone who is dis-

tressed has a reason that has evoked negative feelings in the first place. In the digital domain, one way 

of alleviating the distress would be to write about one’s feelings as a cathartic exercise, or perhaps to 

express their point if in an argument or debate; both would likely require more words to achieve. 

In sum, it is safe to say that users with varying levels of empathy do exhibit different linguistic styles 

when communicating in social media. Therefore, the results of our analysis support H2b. 

The number of available cases to fit model 3 was reduced to 169 participants (from 202), because 

some of the data regarding friends of participants could not be collected (most likely because it was 

protected by the respective Facebook users). 

 

134



The total number of likes and comments received on posts, as well as number of friends were used in 

order to examine the relationship between these measures and empathy. As can be seen in Table 6, the 

number of likes on one’s posts and total number of friends were not correlated to any of the four types 

of empathy. The volume of comments (measured as the total number of words of the comments) on 

one’s posts is weakly correlated to PD, although the direction of the relationship is negative.  

Therefore, we can conclude that H1a is not supported; network size alone is not a clear signal of an 

empathic personality.  

 

A possible explanation of this finding might be that participants use Facebook to manage a large num-

ber of “weak ties” (people from different social circles) while still maintaining closer relationship with 

a smaller number of friends (see (Marsden 1987) and (Putnam 2001) for details). However, without 

quantifying the nature (weak vs strong) of each Facebook friend, we cannot test this explanation.  

Still another possibility is the link between network size and narcissism, which is negatively correlated 

to empathy (see (Mehdizadeh, 2013) and (Buffardi and Campbell, 2008) for more explanations).

4 Conclusions and future work 

Given the unprecedented scale of human connectivity realized through social media, with unforeseea-

ble consequences on a global scale, it is timely to study the relationship of online interactions with 

such an important human characteristic as empathy. In this paper, we explored correlations between 

multiple behavioral cues on social media and empathy. We considered a snapshot of a user’s Facebook 

data, collected over a given time interval, to understand how different behavioral cues correlate to the 

user’s levels of empathy. In other words, we explore how other Facebook users might form impres-

sions about someone’s level of empathy based on his or her behavior. The main focus and novelty of 

our study was to explore whether the writing characteristics can describe the user in terms of empathy.  

 

We learned that the relationship between participants’ social media behaviors, friendships and interac-

tions with others, and their levels of trait empathy is rather complex. While we began with hypotheses 

grounded in previous literature, we observed some unexpected correlations. In particular, it appears to 

be the case that not all interactions are equal; it is likely that simple traces of interaction such as 

“likes” and “commenting” may tell us different things about an individual’s willingness and ability to 

engage others. Future work could probe deeper in order to understand how and why users exhibiting 

relatively high and low levels of empathy engage “the other”.  

 

We also generated some ideas for future work, including experimenting with more targeted linguistic 

features (such as modal and hypothetical verbs); using syntactic structure for a more complex meas-

urement of style; building a cross-validated predictive model; analysis of other traits, e.g. narcissism, 

big five (BF) personality (and considering empathy as an aspect of agreeableness from the BF person-

ality traits); distinguishing between friendship, acquaintances, and incidental/semi-random FB connec-

tions in our model; considering how empathy relates to the care/harm dimension of moral foundations 

theory; and exploring trolling (Buckels et al., 2014) as an opposite of empathy. 

 

135



In summary, this paper has highlighted a few interesting research directions: the relationship between 

social media activities, communication patterns, and the human characteristic of empathy. Future work 

must focus on recruiting a larger sample of participants in order to obtain a more balanced representa-

tion of different cultural groups as well as gender representation. In addition, the study can be extend-

ed to inter-group interactions based on social classes, religions, nationality, and so on. An in depth un-

derstanding of inter-group interaction online and its relationship to empathy is an important direction 

of research, and would potentially provide insights to those who design social technology that would 

facilitate positive intergroup interactions, thus creating a more empathic online environment.
