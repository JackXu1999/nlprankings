Abstract

With the advent of informal electronic
communications such as social media, col-
loquial languages that were historically
unwritten are being written for the first
time in heavily code-switched environ-
ments. We present a method for in-
ducing portions of translation lexicons
through the use of expert knowledge in
these settings where there are approxi-
mately zero resources available other than
a language informant, potentially not even
large amounts of monolingual data. We
investigate inducing a Moroccan Darija-
English translation lexicon via French
loanwords bridging into English and find
that a useful lexicon is induced for human-
assisted translation and statistical machine
translation.

1 Introduction

With the explosive growth of informal electronic
communications such as email, social media, web
comments, etc., colloquial languages that were
historically unwritten are starting to be written
for the first time. For these languages, there are
extremely limited (approximately zero) resources
available, not even large amounts of monolingual
text data or possibly not even small amounts of
monolingual text data. Even when audio resources
are available, difficulties arise when converting
sound to text (Tratz et al., 2013; Robinson and
Gadelii, 2003). Moreover, the text data that can
be obtained often has non-standard spellings and
substantial code-switching with other traditionally
written languages (Tratz et al., 2013).

In this paper we present a method for the ac-
quisition of translation lexicons via loanwords and
expert knowledge that requires zero resources of

the borrowing language. Many historically un-
written languages borrow from highly resourced
languages. Also, it is often feasible to locate a
language expert to find out how sounds in these
languages would be rendered if they were to be
written as many of them are beginning to be writ-
ten in social media, etc. We thus expect the gen-
eral method to be applicable for multiple histori-
cally unwritten languages. In this paper we inves-
tigate inducing a Moroccan Darija-English trans-
lation lexicon via borrowed French words. Mo-
roccan Darija is an historically unwritten dialect of
Arabic spoken by millions but lacking in standard-
ization and linguistic resources (Tratz et al., 2013).
Moroccan Darija is known to borrow many words
from French, one of the most highly resourced
languages in the world. By mapping Moroccan
Darija-French borrowings to their donor French
words, we can rapidly create lexical resources for
portions of Moroccan Darija vocabulary for which
no resources currently exist. For example, we
could use one of many bilingual French-English
dictionaries to bridge into English and create a
Moroccan Darija-English translation lexicon that
can be used to assist professional translation of
Moroccan Darija into English and to assist with
construction of Moroccan Darija-English Machine
Translation (MT) systems.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 summarizes related work; section 3 ex-
plains our method; section 4 discusses experimen-
tal results of applying our method to the case
of building a Moroccan Darija-English translation
lexicon; and section 5 concludes.

2 Related Work

Translation lexicons are a core resource used for
multilingual processing of languages. Manual cre-
ation of translation lexicons by lexicographers is

21



time-consuming and expensive. There are more
than 7000 languages in the world, many of which
are historically unwritten (Lewis et al., 2015).
For a relatively small number of these languages
there are extensive resources available that have
been manually created. It has been noted by
others (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and
Yarowsky, 2002) that languages are organized into
families and that using cognates between sister
languages can help rapidly create translation lex-
icons for lower-resourced languages. For exam-
ple, the methods in (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001)
are able to detect that English kilograms maps
to Portuguese quilogramas via bridge Spanish
kilogramos. This general idea has been worked
on extensively in the context of cognates detec-
tion, with ‘cognate’ typically re-defined to include
loanwords as well as true cognates. The meth-
ods use monolingual data at a minimum and many
signals such as orthographic similarity, phonetic
similarity, contextual similarity, temporal similar-
ity, frequency similarity, burstiness similarity, and
topic similarity (Bloodgood and Strauss, 2017;
Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013; Kondrak et al.,
2003; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Mann and
Yarowsky, 2001). Inducing translations via loan-
words was specifically targeted in (Tsvetkov and
Dyer, 2015; Tsvetkov et al., 2015). While some
of these methods don’t require bilingual resources,
with the possible exception of small bilingual seed
dictionaries, they do at a minimum require mono-
lingual text data in the languages to be modeled
and sometimes have specific requirements on the
monolingual text data such as having text coming
from the same time period for each of the lan-
guages being modeled. For colloquial languages
that were historically unwritten, but that are now
starting to be written with the advent of social me-
dia and web comments, there are often extremely
limited resources of any type available, not even
large amounts of monolingual text data. More-
over, the written data that can be obtained of-
ten has non-standard spellings and code-switching
with other traditionally written languages. Often
the code-switching occurs within words whereby
the base is borrowed and the affixes are not bor-
rowed, analogous to the multi-language categories
“V” and “N” from (Mericli and Bloodgood, 2012).
The data available for historically unwritten lan-
guages, and especially the lack thereof, is not suit-
able for previously developed cognates detection

methods that operate as discussed above. In the
next section we present a method for translation
lexicon induction via loanwords that uses expert
knowledge and requires zero resources from the
borrowing language other than a language infor-
mant.

3 Method

Our method is to take word pronunciations from
the donor language we are using and convert them
to how they would be rendered in the borrowing
language if they were to be borrowed. These are
our candidate loanwords. There are three possi-
ble cases for a given generated candidate loanword
string:

true match string occurs in borrowing language
and is a loanword from the donor language;

false match string occurs in borrowing language
by coincidence but it’s not a loanword from
the donor language;

no match string does not occur in borrowing lan-
guage.

For the case of inducing a Moroccan Darija-
English translation lexicon via French we start
with a French-English bilingual dictionary and
take all the French pronunciations in IPA (Inter-
national Phonetic Alphabet)1 and convert them to
how they would be rendered in Arabic script. For
this we created a multiple-step transliteration pro-
cess:

Step 1 Break pronunciation into syllables.

Step 2 Convert each IPA syllable to a string in
modified Buckwalter transliteration2, which
supports a one-to-one mapping to Arabic
script.

Step 3 Convert each syllable’s string in modified
Buckwalter transliteration to Arabic script.

Step 4 Merge the resulting Arabic script strings
for each syllable to generate a candidate loan-
word string.

International_Phonetic_Alphabet

2The modified version of Buckwalter transliter-
ation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Buckwalter_transliteration, replaces special
characters such as < and > with alphanumeric characters so
that the transliterations are safe for use with other standards
such as XML (Extensible Markup Language). For more
information see (Habash, 2010).

22



For syllabification, for many word pronuncia-
tions the syllables are already marked in the IPA
by the ‘.’ character; if syllables are not already
marked in the IPA, we run a simple syllabifier to
complete step 1. For step 2, we asked a language
expert to give us a sequence of rules to convert
a syllable’s pronunciation to modified Buckwalter
transliteration. This is itself a multi-step process
(see next paragraph for details). In step 3, we sim-
ply do the one-to-one conversion and obtain Ara-
bic script for each syllable. In step 4, we merge
the Arabic script for each syllable and get the gen-
erated candidate loanword string.

The multi-step process that takes place in step 2
of the process is:

Step 2.1 Make minor vowel adjustments in cer-
tain contexts, e.g., when ‘a’ is between two
consonants it is changed to ‘A’.

Step 2.2 Perform bulk of conversion by us-
ing table of mappings from IPA characters
to modified Buckwalter characters such as
‘a’→‘a’,‘k’→‘k’, ‘y:’→‘iy’, etc. that were
supplied by a language expert.

Step 2.3 Perform miscellaneous modifications to
finalize the modified Buckwalter strings, e.g.,
if a syllable ends in ‘a’, then append an ‘A’ to
that syllable.

The entire conversion process is illustrated in
Figure 1 for the French word raconteur. At the
top of the Figure is the IPA from the French dic-
tionary entry with syllables marked. At the next
level, step 1 (syllabification) has been completed.
Step 2.1 doesn’t apply to any of the syllables in
this word since there are no minor vowel adjust-
ments that are applicable for this word so at the
next level each syllable is shown after step 2.2 has
been completed. The next level shows the sylla-
bles after step 2.3 has been completed. The next
level shows after step 3 has been completed and
then at the end the strings are merged to form the
candidate loanword.

4 Experiments and Discussion

In our experiments we extracted a French-
English bilingual dictionary using the freely avail-
able English Wiktionary dump 20131101 down-
loaded from http://dumps.wikimedia.
org/enwiktionary. From this dump we ex-
tracted all the French words, their pronunciations,

the main text, step 2.1 doesn’t apply to this ex-
ample so it is omitted from the diagram to con-
serve space. Note that in the final step the word is
in order of Unicode codepoints. Then application
software that is capable of processing Arabic will

and their English definitions. Using the pro-
cess described in section 3 to convert each of the
French pronunciations into Arabic script yielded
8277 unique loanword candidate strings.

The data used for testing consists of a million
lines of user comments crawled from the Moroc-
can news website http://www.hespress.
com. The crawled user comments contain Mo-
roccan Darija in heavily code-switched environ-
ments. While this makes for a challenging set-
ting, it is a realistic representation of the types of
environments in which historically unwritten lan-
guages are being written for the first time. The
data we used is consistent with well-known code-
switching among Arabic speakers, extending spo-
ken discourse into formal writing (Bentahila and
Davies, 1983; Redouane, 2005). The total number
of tokens in our Hespress corpus is 18,781,041.
We found that 1150 of our 8277 loanword candi-
dates appear in our Hespress corpus. Moreover,
more than a million (1169087) loanword candi-

date instances appear in the corpus. Recall that a
match could be a true match that really is a French
loanword or a false match that just happens to co-
incidentally have string equality with words in the
borrowing language, but is not a French loanword.
False matches are particularly likely to occur for
very short words. Accordingly, we filter out can-
didates that are of length less than four characters.
This leaves us with 838 candidates appearing in
the corpus and 217616 candidate instances in the
corpus. To get an idea of what percentage of our
matches are true matches versus false matches, we
conducted an annotation exercise with two native
Moroccan Darija speakers who also knew at least
intermediate French. We pulled a random sample3

of 1185 candidate instances from our corpus and
asked each annotator to mark each instance as ei-
ther:

A if the instance is originally from Arabic,

F if the instance is originally from French, or

U if they were not sure.

The results are shown in Table 1. There are a
substantial number of French loanwords that are
found. Some examples of translations successfully
induced by our method are:

omelette �IJ
ÊÓð@; and

bourgeoisie ø
 	P@ñk. PñK. .

We hypothesize that our method can help im-
prove machine translation (MT) of historically un-
written dialects with nearly zero resources. To test
this hypothesis, we ran an MT experiment as fol-
lows.

First we selected a random set of sentences
from the Hespress corpus that each contained
at least one candidate instance and had an
MSA/Moroccan Darija/English trilingual transla-
tor translate them into English. In total, 273 sen-
tences were translated. This served as our test set.

3We removed 15 Arabic stopwords from our candidate list
before pulling the random sample.

We trained a baseline MT system using all GALE
MSA-English parallel corpora available from the
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) from 2007 to
2013.4

We trained the system using Moses 3.0 with de-
fault parameters. This baseline system achieves
BLEU score of 7.48 on our difficult test set of
code-switched Moroccan Darija and MSA.

We trained a second system using the paral-
lel corpora with our induced Moroccan Darija-
English translation lexicon appended to the end of
the training data. This time the BLEU score in-
creased to 8.11, a gain of .63 BLEU points.

5 Conclusions

With the explosive growth of informal textual
electronic communications such as social media,
web comments, etc., many colloquial everyday
languages that were historically unwritten are now
being written for the first time often in heavily
code-switched text with traditionally written lan-
guages. The new written versions of these lan-
guages pose significant challenges for multilingual
processing technology due to Out-Of-Vocabulary
(OOV) challenges. Yet it is relatively common
that these historically unwritten languages borrow
significant amounts of vocabulary from relatively
well resourced written languages. We presented a
method for translation lexicon induction via loan-
words for alleviating the OOV challenges in these
settings where the borrowing language has ex-
tremely limited amounts of resources available, in
many cases not even substantial amounts of mono-
lingual data that is typically exploited by previous
cognates and loanword detection methods to in-
duce translation lexicons. This paper demonstrates
induction of a Moroccan Darija-English transla-
tion lexicon via bridging French loanwords using
the method and in MT experiments, the addition of
the induced Moroccan Darija-English lexicon in-
creased system performance by .63 BLEU points.
