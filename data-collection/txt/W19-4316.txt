Abstract

Bilingual word embeddings, which represent
lexicons of different languages in a shared em-
bedding space, are essential for supporting se-
mantic and knowledge transfers in a variety of
cross-lingual NLP tasks. Existing approaches
to training bilingual word embeddings require
often require pre-defined seed lexicons that are
expensive to obtain, or parallel sentences that
comprise coarse and noisy alignment. In con-
trast, we propose BilLex that leverages pub-
licly available lexical definitions for bilingual
word embedding learning. Without the need
of predefined seed lexicons, BilLex comprises
a novel word pairing strategy to automati-
cally identify and propagate the precise fine-
grained word alignment from lexical defini-
tions. We evaluate BilLex in word-level and
sentence-level translation tasks, which seek to
find the cross-lingual counterparts of words
and sentences respectively. BilLex signifi-
cantly outperforms previous embedding meth-
ods on both tasks.

1 Introduction
Bilingual word embeddings are the essential com-
ponents of multilingual NLP systems. These em-
beddings capture cross-lingual semantic transfers
of words and phrases from bilingual corpora, and
are widely deployed in many NLP tasks, such as
machine translation (Conneau et al., 2018), cross-
lingual Wikification (Tsai and Roth, 2016), knowl-
edge alignment (Chen et al., 2018) and semantic
search (Vulić and Moens, 2015).

A variety of approaches have been proposed to
learn bilingual word embeddings (Duong et al.,
2017; Luong et al., 2015; Coulmance et al., 2015).
Many such approaches rely on the use of aligned
corpora. Such corpora could be seed lexicons that
provide word-level mappings between two lan-
guages (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Xing et al., 2015),

or parallel corpora that align sentences and doc-
uments (Klementiev et al., 2012; Gouws et al.,
2015). However, these methods critically suf-
fer from several deficiencies. First, seed-lexicon-
based approaches are often hindered by the lim-
itedness of seeds (Vulić and Korhonen, 2016),
which is an intractable barrier since high-quality
seed lexicons require extensive human efforts to
obtain (Zhang et al., 2017). Second, parallel cor-
pora provide coarse alignment that does not often
accurately infer fine-grained semantic transfers of
lexicons (Ruder et al., 2017).

Unlike the existing methods, we propose to use
publicly available dictionaries1 for bilingual word
embedding learning. Dictionaries, such as Wik-
tionary and Merriam-Webster, contain large col-
lections of lexical definitions, which are clean lin-
guistic knowledge that naturally connects word
semantics within and across human languages.
Hence, dictionaries provide valuable information
to bridge the lexicons in different languages. How-
ever, cross-lingual learning from lexical defini-
tions is a non-trivial task. A straightforward ap-
proach based on aligning the target word embed-
ding to the aggregated embedding of words in the
definition might work, but not all words in a defini-
tion are semantically related to the defined target
word (Fig. 1(a)). Therefore, a successful model
has to effectively identify the most related lexicons
from the multi-granular and asymmetric alignment
of lexical definitions. Besides, how to leverage
both bilingual and monolingual dictionaries for
cross-lingual learning is another challenge.

In this paper, we propose BilLex (Bilingual
Word Embeddings Based on Lexical Definitions)
to learn bilingual word embeddings. BilLex con-
stitutes a carefully designed two-stage mechanism

1We refer to dictionary in its regular meaning, i.e. the
collections of word definitions. This is different from some
papers that refer to dictionaries as seed lexicons.

to automatically cultivate, propagate and leverage
lexicon pairs of high semantic similarity from lex-
ical definitions in dictionaries. It first extracts
bilingual strong word pairs from bilingual lexi-
cal definitions of which the words contribute to
the cross-lingual definitions of each other. On top
of that, our model automatically exploits induced
word pairs, which utilize monolingual dictionar-
ies and the aforementioned strong pairs to exploit
semantically related word pairs. This automated
word pair induction process enables BilLex to cap-
ture abundant high-quality lexical alignment infor-
mation, based on which the cross-lingual seman-
tic transfer of words is easily captured in a shared
embedding space. Experimental results on word-
level and sentence-level translation tasks show that
BilLex drastically outperforms various baselines
that are trained on parallel or seed-lexicon corpora,
as well as state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

2 Related Work

Prior approaches to learning bilingual word em-
beddings often rely on word or sentence align-
ment (Ruder et al., 2017). In particular, seed
lexicon methods (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Faruqui
and Dyer, 2014; Guo et al., 2015) learn transfor-
mations across different language-specific embed-
ding spaces based on predefined word alignment.
The performance of these approaches is limited by
the sufficiency of seed lexicons. Besides, parallel
corpora methods (Gouws et al., 2015; Coulmance
et al., 2015) leverage the aligned sentences in dif-
ferent languages and force the representations of
corresponding sentence components to be simi-
lar. However, aligned sentences merely provide
weak alignment of lexicons that do not accurately
capture the one-to-one mapping of words, while
such a mapping is well-desired by translation tasks
(Upadhyay et al., 2016). In addition, a few unsu-
pervised approaches alleviate the use of bilingual
resources (Chen and Cardie, 2018; Conneau et al.,
2018). These models require considerable effort
to train and rely heavily on massive monolingual
corpora.

Monolingual lexical definitions have been used
for weak supervision of monolingual word simi-
larities (Tissier et al., 2017). Our work demon-
strates that dictionary information can be extended
to a cross-lingual scenario, for which we develop a
simple yet effective induction method to populate
fine-grain word alignment.

3 Modeling
We first provide the formal definition of bilingual
dictionaries. Let L be the set of languages and L2
be the set of ordered language pairs. For a lan-
guage l ∈ L, we use Vl to denote its vocabulary,
where for each word w ∈ Vl, w ∈ Rk denotes its
embedding vector. A dictionary denoted as Dli,lj
contains words in language li and their definitions
in lj . In particular, Dli,lj is a monolingual dic-
tionary if li = lj and is a bilingual dictionary if
li 6= lj . A dictionary Dli,lj contains dictionary en-
tries (wi, Qj(wi)), where wi ∈ Vli is the word be-
ing defined and Qj(wi) is a sequence of words in
lj describing the meaning of the wordwi. Fig. 1(a)
shows an entry from an English-French dictionary,
and one from a French-English dictionary.

BilLex allows us to exploit semantically related
word pairs in two stages. We first use bilingual
dictionaries to construct bilingual strong pairs,
which are similar to those monolingual word pairs
in (Tissier et al., 2017). Then based on the given
strong word pairs and monolingual dictionaries,
we provide two types of induced word pairs to fur-
ther enhance the cross-lingual learning.

3.1 Bilingual Strong Pairs

A bilingual strong pair contains two words with
high semantic relevance. Such a pair of words that
mutually contribute to the cross-lingual definitions
of each other is defined as below.
Definition (Bilingual Strong Pairs) PSli,lj is the
set of bilingual strong pairs in (li, lj) ∈ L2
(li 6= lj), where each word pair is defined as:
(wi, wj) ∈ PSli,lj ⇔ w

i ∈ Qi(wj) ∧ wj ∈ Qj(wi)
Intuitively, if wi appears in the cross-lingual

definition of wj and wj appears in the cross-
lingual definition of wi, then wi and wj should
be semantically close to each other. Particularly,
PSli,lj denotes monolingual strong pairs if li = lj .
For instance, (car, véhicule) depicted in Fig. 1(a)
form a bilingual strong pair. Note that Tissier et al.
also introduce the monolingual weak pairs by pair-
ing the target word with the other words from its
definition, which do not form strong pairs with it.
However, we do not extend such weak pairs to the
bilingual setting, as we find them to be inaccurate
to represent cross-lingual corresponding words.

3.2 Induced Word Pairs

Since bilingual lexical definitions cover only lim-
ited numbers of words in two languages, we in-

blue words in (b-c) are pivot words of the induced pairs.

corporate both monolingual and bilingual strong
pairs, from which we induce two types of word
pairs with different confidence: directly induced
pairs and indirectly induced pairs.
Definition (Bilingual Directly Induced Pairs)
PDli,lj is the set of bilingual directly induced pairs
in (li, lj) ∈ L2, where each word pair is de-
fined as: (wi, wj) ∈ PDli,lj ⇔ ∃w

i
p, (w

i, wip) ∈
PSli,li ∧ (w

i
p, w

j) ∈ PSli,lj
Intuitively, a bilingual induced pair (wi, wj) in-

dicates that we can find a pivot word that forms
a monolingual strong pair with one word from
(wi, wj) and a bilingual strong pair with the other.
Definition (Bilingual Indirectly Induced Pairs)
P Ili,lj is the set of bilingual indirectly induced pairs
in (li, lj) ∈ L2, where each word pair is de-
fined as: (wi, wj) ∈ P Ili,lj ⇔ ∃(w

i
p, w

j
p) ∈

PSli,lj , (w
i, wip) ∈ PSli,li ∧ (w

j , wjp) ∈ PSlj ,lj
A bilingual indirectly induced pair (wi, wj) in-

dicates that there exists a pivot bilingual strong
pair (wip, w

j
p), such that wip forms a monolingual

strong pair with wi and w
j
p forms a monolingual

strong pair with wj . Fig. 1(b-c) shows examples
of the two types of induced word pairs.

3.3 Training
Our model jointly learns three word-pair-based
cross-lingual objectives ΩK to align the embed-
ding spaces of two languages, and two mono-
lingual monolingual Skip-Gram losses (Mikolov
et al., 2013b) Lli , Llj to preserve monolingual
word similarities. Given a language pair (li, lj) ∈

L2, the learning objective of BilLex is to minimize
the following joint loss function:

J = Lli + Llj +
∑

K∈{PS ,PD,P I}

λKΩK

Each λK (K ∈ {PS , PD, P I}) thereof, is the
hyperparameter that controls how much the corre-
sponding type of word pairs contributes to cross-
lingual learning. For alignment objectives, we
use word pairs in both directions of an ordered
language pair (li, lj) ∈ L2 to capture the cross-
lingual semantic similarity of words, such that
PS = PSli,lj ∪P

S
lj ,li

, PD = PDli,lj ∪P
D
lj ,li

and P I =
P Ili,lj ∪ P

I
lj ,li

. Then for each K ∈ {PS , PD, P I},
the alignment objective ΩK is defined as below,
where σ is the sigmoid function.

ΩK = −
1

|K|
∑

(wi,wj)∈K

(
log σ(wi>wj)

+
∑

(wa,wb)∈Ni(wj)∪Nj(wi)

log σ(−wa>wb)
)

For each word pair (wi, wj), we use the uni-
gram distribution raised to the power of 0.75 to
select a number of words in lj (or li) forwi (orwj)
to form a negative sample setNi(wj) (orNj(wi)).
Without loss of generality, we define the nega-
tive sample set as Ni(wj) = {(win, wj)|win ∼
Ui(w)∧(win, wj) /∈ PS∪PD∪P I}, where Ui(w)
is the distribution of words in li.

4 Experiment
We evaluate BilLex on two bilingual tasks:
word translation and sentence translation re-
trieval. Following the convention (Gouws et al.,
2015; Mogadala and Rettinger, 2016), we evalu-
ate BilLex between English-French and English-
Spanish. Accordingly, we extract word pairs from
both directions of bilingual dictionaries in Wik-
tionary for these language pairs. To support the
induced word pairs, we also extract monolingual
lexical definitions in the three languages involved,
which include 238k entries in English, 107k en-
tries in French and 49k entries in Spanish. The
word pair extraction process of BilLex excludes
stop words and punctuation in the lexical defini-
tions. The statistics of three types of extracted
word pairs are reported in Table 1.

4.1 Word translation
This task aims to retrieve the translation of a
source word in the target language. We use the

test set provided by Conneau et al. (2018), which
selects the most frequent 200k words of each lan-
guage as candidates for 1.5k query words. We
translate a query word by retrieving its k near-
est neighbours in the target language, and report
P@k (k = 1, 5) to represent the fraction of cor-
rect translations that are ranked not larger than k.
Evaluation protocol. The hyperparameters of
BilLex are tuned based on a small validation set of
1k word pairs provided by Conneau et al. (2018).
We allocate 128-dimensional word embeddings
with pre-trained BilBOWA (Gouws et al., 2015).
and use the standard configuration to Skip-Gram
(Mikolov et al., 2013b) on monolingual Wikipedia
dumps. We set the negative sampling size of bilin-
gual word pairs to 4, which is selected from 0 to 10
with the step of 1. λPS is set to 0.9, which is tuned
from 0 to 1 with the step of 0.1. As we assume that
the strong pair relations between words are inde-
pendent, we empirically set λPD = (λPS )

2 = 0.81
and λP I = (λPS )

3 = 0.729. We minimize the loss
function using AMSGrad (Reddi et al., 2018) with
a learning rate of 0.001. The training is terminated
based on early stopping. We limit the vocabular-
ies as the 200k most frequent words in each lan-
guage, and exclude the bilingual strong pairs that
have appeared in the test set. The baselines we
compare against include BiCVM (Hermann and
Blunsom, 2014), BilBOWA (Gouws et al., 2015),
Biskip (Luong et al., 2015), supervised and unsu-
pervised MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018).
Results. Results are summarized in Table 2,
where the performance of BilLex is reported for
three variants: (i) training with bilingual strong
pairs only BilLex(PS), (ii) with directly induced
pair added BilLex(PS+PD), and (iii) with all
three types of word pairs BilLex(PS+PD+P I ).
BilLex(PS+PD+P I ) thereof, offers consistently

that the induced word pairs are effective in im-
proving the cross-lingual learning of lexical se-
mantics. Among the baseline models, the unsu-
pervised MUSE outperforms the other four super-
vised ones. We also discover that for the word
translation task, the supervised models with coarse
alignment such as BiCVM and BilBOWA do not
perform as well as the models with word-level su-
pervision, such as BiSkip and supervised MUSE.
Our best BilLex outperforms unsupervised MUSE
by 4.4∼5.7% of P@1 between En and Fr, and by
0.3∼1.8% between En and Es. The reason why the
settings between En and Fr achieve better perfor-
mance is that there are much fewer bilingual defi-
nitions between En and Es.

4.2 Sentence translation retrieval

This task focuses on retrieving the sentence in the
target language space with the tf-idf weighted sen-
tence representation approach. We follow the ex-
periment setup in (Conneau et al., 2018) with 2k
source sentence queries and 200k target sentences
from the Europarl corpus for English and French.
We carry forward model configurations from the
previous experiment, and report P@k (k = 1, 5).
Results. The results are reported in Table 3. Over-
all, our best model variant BilLex(PS+PD+P I )
performs better than the best baseline with a no-
ticeable increment of P@1 by 1.4∼1.7% and P@5
by 1.3∼2.1%. This demonstrates that BilLex is
suitable for transferring sentential semantics.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose BilLex, a novel bilin-
gual word embedding model based on lexical defi-
nitions. BilLex is motivated by the fact that openly
available dictionaries offer high-quality linguistic
knowledge to connect lexicons across languages.
We design the word pair induction method to
capture semantically related lexicons in dictio-
naries, which serve as alignment information in
joint training. BilLex outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on word and sentence translation tasks.
