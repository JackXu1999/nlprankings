Abstract

This paper deals with the creation of the first morphological treebank for German by merging
two pre-existing linguistic databases. The first of these is the linguistic database CELEX which
is a standard resource for German morphology. We build on its refurbished and modernized
version. The second resource is GermaNet, a lexical-semantic network which also provides
partial markup for compounds. We describe the state of the art and the essential characteristics
of both databases and our latest revisions. As the merging involves two data sources with distinct
annotation schemes, the derivation of the morphological trees for the unified resource is not
trivial. We discuss how we overcome problems with the data and format, in particular how we
deal with overlaps and complementary scopes. The resulting database comprises about 100,000
trees whose format can be chosen according to the requirements of the application at hand. In
our discussion, we show some future directions for morphological treebanks. The Perl script for
the generation of the data from the sources will be made publicly available on our website.

1 Introduction

Lexical productivity is a characteristic for German word formation. This leads to bottleneck prob-
lems in different fields such as the building of terminology or Information Retrieval. Concerning the
morphological analyses and structures, there are three main problems:

A. the wealth of ambiguous forms on the level of morph segmentation
B. the lack of deeper structural analyses in current approaches
C. for morphological analysis in general, the lack of frequency counts or a robust estimation for affixes.

A morphological treebank of the most common lemmas or word forms of German can serve as a starting
point for addressing all of these issues. Although the demand for such a morphological treebank with
hierarchical analyses was recognized some time ago (Zielinski and Simon, 2009, 230), to our knowledge,
morphological treebanks for German do not exist so far, besides some mostly internally used gold
standards. Deep morphological analyses can be used as

1. input for statistical approaches for full morphological parsing of German words
2. base of counts for testing of quantitative hypotheses about morphological tendencies and laws
3. gold standards and test suites for morphological analyzers
4. morphological resources for morphological analyzers
5. input for textual analyses

We derive a morphological treebank for German from two different databases: the first resource is the
linguistic database CELEX which is a standard resource for German morphology. The second resource
is the GermaNet database which contains partial markup for compounds.

Section 2 describes the current state of research for German deep-level morphological data. The first
part of Section 3 describes the German part of the refurbished CELEX database with an emphasis on the
data which are relevant for the tree extraction process as well as problems and errors in the data. It also
gives a sketch of the preprocessing. The second part deals with the GermaNet (GN) database and the
characteristics that are relevant for our project. Section 4 presents the procedures we use. It starts with
the extraction of all relevant information from both databases, followed by the recursive construction of
the morphological analyses. The derivation of the morphological trees for both sources is not trivial and
we show how we overcome problems with the data and format. In Section 5, we show how we merge
the two sources which have distinct annotation styles as well as overlaps and complementary scopes in
their morphological classifications. We discuss the decisions used for the classification underlying our
unified annotation. The results of the script are presented in Section 6. The resulting database comprises
about 100,000 morphological trees whose format can be chosen according to the requirements of the
applications. The conclusion in Section 7 provides some future directions for morphological treebanks.
The Perl script for the generation of the data from the sources will be made publicly available on our
website.

2 Related work
German is a language with complex processes of word formation, of which the most common are
compounding and derivation. Segmentation and analysis of the resulting word forms are challenging
as spelling conventions do not permit spaces as indicators for boundaries of constituents. Therefore,
so far the main concern of morphological analysers for German is finding the correct splits on the
level of the morphs. Morphological segmentation tools for German such as SMOR (Schmid et al.,
2004), Gertwol (Haapalainen and Majorin, 1995), MORPH (Hanrieder, 1996), TAGH (Geyken and
Hanneforth, 2006) generate dozens of analyses for relatively simple words. For instance, Kellerassel
“common rough woodlouse” could be erroneously segmented to ]Kelle|Rassel “(ladle|rattle)” instead of
Keller|Assel (basement|woodlouse) common rough woodlouse”. Also, there are many sets of homonyms
comprising both free and bound morphemes. For example, the form bar is a suffix in machbar mach|bar
(make|able) “feasible”, a free morph in Hotelbar (hotel|bar) “hotel bar” and a sequence without syn-
chronically transparent meaning inNachbardistrikt “neighboring district” which can be wrongly analysed
to ]nach|Bar|Distrikt (after|bar|district) (see Figure 1).

This ambiguity problem has been tackled by using ranking scores for the different morphological analyses.
For example, Cap (2014) and Koehn and Knight (2003) use the geometric mean as a weighting measure
for each possible analyses of SMOR and then choose the one with the highest rank. Another possibility
are methods of exploiting the sequence of letters, e.g by pattern matching with tokens (Henrich and
Hinrichs, 2011, 422), lemmas (Weller-Di Marco, 2017), or normalization (Ziering and van der Plas,
2016) which is combined with ranking by the geometric mean. Ma et al. (2016) apply Conditional
Random Fields modeling for letter sequences. Daiber et al. (2015) extract candidates of compound splits
by string comparisons with corpus data.

More recent approaches exploit semantic information for the ranking. Riedl and Biemann (2016)
take sets of constituent candidates they generate by combining a compound splitter and look-ups of
similar terms inside a distributional thesaurus generated from a large corpus. Their ranking score is
a modification of the geometric mean. Ziering et al. (2016) use the cosine as a measure for semantic

147



similarity between compounds and their hypothetical constituents and combine these similarity values
by computing the geometric means and other scores for each produced split. The scores are then
used as factors to be multiplied by the results of former splits, which were produced by morphological
segmentation tools such as SMOR. The re-ranking shows a slight improvement over the initial values,
while the pure distributional similarities were inferior to the initial results from the splitter. The reason
for this is mainly the rate of word ambiguity which for large corpora is mirrored within the distributional
patterns.

Most tools for word analyses of German word forms provide flat sequences of morphs or morphemes
but no hierarchical parses which could give important information for word sense disambiguation. Only
Würzner and Hanneforth (2013) tackle the problem of full morphological parsing, restricted to adjectives,
by using a probabilistic context free grammar for parsing. Steiner and Ruppenhofer (2015) developed
a method for building parts of morphological structures by reducing the set of all possible low-level
combinations by ranking SMOR splits with the gmean score. They derived the frequencies from different
lexical and textual sources, showing some effects which hint at the importance of carefully choosing the
source of frequency counts.

Ziering et al. (2016) discuss left-branching compounds consisting of three lexemes such asArbeitsplatz-
mangel “(Arbeit|Platz|Mangel) (work|place|lack) job scarcity”. Their distributional semantic modelling
fails to find the correct binary split, if the head (here Mangel “lack”) is too ambiguous to correlate
strongly with the first part (here Arbeitsplatz “employment”). Ziering and van der Plas (2016) develop
a splitter which makes use of normalization methods and can be used recursively by re-analyzing the
results of splits. Their evaluation however is based only on the binary compounds of GermaNet (Hamp
and Feldweg, 1997).

All these approaches build strongly upon corpus data but none of them uses lexical data. Only Henrich
and Hinrichs (2011) enrich the output of morphological segmentation with information from GermaNet
to disambiguate such structures. This can yield hierarchical structures but presupposes that the entries
for the components exist inside the database.

Databases of correct morphological splits and deep-level analyses could save a lot of effort, as there
are almost no cases of forms with two different analyses which are really used, even if structure and splits
can be analysed ambiguously. The second analysis in Figure (1) will hardly ever occur in real text. At
most, it could be merely understood as a pun.

In most cases, German morphological data resources are restricted to lists of flat analyses, for instance,
the test set of the 2009 workshop on statistical machine translation,1 which was used by Cap (2014). It
comprises 6,187 word tokens with binary top-level splits. Henrich and Hinrichs (2011) augmented the
GermaNet database with information on noun compound splits of the top-level. DErivBase (Zeller et al.,
2013) comprises derivational families (word nests) and could be used to infer derivational trees from its
sets and rules, however, it is based on heuristics and therefore contains some errors.

The only publicly available source which comprises German word tree information is the German part
of the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995). The linguistic information is combined with frequency
information based on corpora (Burnage, 1995) which makes it useful for automated morphological
analysis of unknown words.

That CELEX is a standard resource for research in morphology is demonstrated by Shafaei et al. (2017)
who use its German data for inferring derivational families (DErivCELEX) which are more precise than
DErivBase. This data is obviously drawn from the original CELEX version with its old orthographical
standard.2 Shafaei et al. (2017) claim that CELEX does not treat prefixation as a form of derivation. In
general, this assertion is unjustified, though some first constituents of verbs are classified as free morphs
which Shafaei et al. (2017) consider as prefixes. While the CELEX classification is justifiable from a
linguistic viewpoint of consistency and difference between prefixes and particles, this proves as an error
source for the algorithms of derivational families. For this reason, a second version of DErivCELEX is
based on some "pragmatic changes" in categorization concerning compound verbs.

Cotterell et al. (2016) reanalyse part of the deep-level morphological analyses for English and thus
generate 7,454 morphological parses which to our knowledge is the only morphological treebank for
English besides the aforementioned. Dutch morphological analysis is covered by CELEX too. For other
languages, the situation is even less fortunate. But if there are resources of derivational families with
information on their generating rules such as in CroDeriV (Filko and Šojat, 2017) for Croatian, Démonette
for French (Hathout and Namer, 2016), DeriNet for Czech (Žabokrtský et al., 2016) or DerIvaTario for
Italian (Talamo et al., 2016), hierarchical trees could be derived though compounds are not considered
by these lists.

The original drawbacks of the German part of the CELEX database were an outdated format and use
of former orthographical conventions. However, these problems were tackled by Steiner (2016), and so
the database yields a foundation for further exploitation. We decided to take it as the foundation for the
morphological treebank and then augment it by other sources, the first of which is the GermaNet database.

3 Lexical resources for morphological trees

3.1 The Refurbished CELEX-German Database
The CELEX database comprises 51,728 entries of which 38,650 are derivates or compounds and 2,402
conversions. This seems to be a small set, however, the lemmas are similar to the small dictionary
Der kleine Wahrig (Wahrig-Burfeind and Bertelsmann, 2007) which represents the core vocabulary
for German. Being developed in the early Nineties, the original CELEX database coding comprised
a workaround for special characters. In German, these are mainly umlauts and characters such as ß.
Furthermore, it uses an out-dated spelling convention which makes the lexicon partially incompatible
with text written after 1996. For instance, the modern spelling of the original CELEX entry Abschluß
‘conclusion’ is Abschluss. About 20 percent of the data is in an outdated format. Steiner (2016)
refurbished the encoding and the spelling of the database completely. A version with modern encoding
but old spelling was also created. Now, trees as in Figure (2) and (3) can be derived from the database.

However, these kinds of trees do not contain categorial information for affixes nor for the derivation
process, e.g. the noun Abschluss ‘finalization’ in the derivation of (2). Morever, some derivations in the
German CELEX database provide diachronic information which is correct but often unwanted for many
applications, for example in Abdrift ‘leeway’ in example (1) which is diachronically derived from treiben
‘to float’. On the other hand, some derivations such as the ablaut change between gehen ‘to go’ and Gang
‘gait,path,aisle’ in Abgangszeugnis ‘leaving certificate’ in example (2) could be of interest.3

Figure 3 shows that the filler letters (interfix)4 can be inferred from the database entry, where they are

information and the morphological trees.

logical status can be discussed, and we prefer the term filler letters which refers to the form.

represented within the categories of the immediate constituent structure. As every complex entry has this
information, this enables one to recursively collect them from the entries.

Though most of its data is free of errors, the original CELEX database contains some mistakes
which were not treated by the refurbishment of Steiner (2016) which involved only changes of coding and
spelling. We found missing constituents and missing part of speech information within the morphological
trees and within the field of immediate constituency information as well as inconsistent morphological
analyses. We augmented the script for the transformation to a modern standard by 18 additional rules,
which covered 65 instances before we could use the data for extracting the morphological trees. We are
aware of the fact that we could not find all mistakes.

3.2 Compound Analyses from GermaNet

Henrich and Hinrichs (2011) augmented the GermaNet database with information on compound splits.
This is restricted to nouns and does not provide filler letters or deep-level structures. The data was revised
since then. We are using version 11 which was most recently updated in February 2017.5 Example (3)
presents a typical entry for Werkstück ‘work piece’. The parts of interest are marked by bold letters. As
two derivational processes are possible, two modifiers werken ‘to work’ and Werk‘work, noun’ exist for
the head, leading to two splits.

(3) <synset id="s5552" category="nomen" class="Artefakt"> <lexUnit id="l8355" sense="1"
source="core" namedEntity="no" artificial="no" styleMarking="no"> <orthForm>Werkstück
</orthForm><compound><modifier category="Nomen">Werk</modifier><modifier
category="Verb">werken</modifier><head>Stück</head></compound></lexUnit>
</synset>

Different to the CELEX data, the filler letters are missing in the analyses, such as in (4a). Therefore,
we insert them by a heuristic method to get analyses as in (4b). Furthermore, we exclude compounds
with proper names as constituents such as (5) and foreign expressions as in (6). We did not correct
any mistakes of the database but automatically excluded a few deficient entries, for example those with
missing part-of-speech classes, and compounds with affixoids or fossilized morphemes.

(4) a. Abfahrtszeit ‘departure time’: Abfahrt|Zeit (departure|time)
b. Abfahrtszeit ‘departure time’: Abfahrt|s|Zeit (departure|filler letter|time)

(5) Bodenseeregion ‘Lake of Constance region’

(6) After-Show-Party

4 Procedures

4.1 Data Extraction

For extracting all relevant information from the refurbished CELEX data, we build an inverted index
of all lemmas and extract all immediate constituents and their categories. Then we internally add the
infinitive forms of the verbs which are included within these entries. This is necessary so that these forms
can be found within the inverted index of the entries. We also refurbish the German syntactic database
of CELEX to the modern standard and extract the parts of speech of the entries. As the users can choose
if they like to generate not just compounds and derivatives but also conversions, we extract the relevant
information for this word-formation type too but exclude 724 cases of lexicalized inflection (see Gulikers
et al., 1995, 54) such as (7).

(7) anhaltend (continuing, present perfect) ‘persistent’

5see http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/compounds.shtml#Download for a description.

150



The data finally comprises an inverted list of 40,081 entries with 38,650 different word splits of complex
entries (compounds and derivations) and 1,678 conversions.

From the GermaNet data, we extract all completely annotated compounds with their splits and filler
letters according to the restrictions. We also infer the category of the head from the entry. This leads to
a list of 64,468 entries with 67,466 different word splits; all of them are nominal compounds. (8) shows
the analyses for (3). The variation in spelling of nomen is due to the original data.

(8) Werkstück Werk_Nomen|Stück_nomen
Werkstück werken_Verb|Stück_nomen

4.2 Building the Trees
For each entry of the extracted data, the procedure starts from the list of its immediate constituents and
recursively collects all information. Algorithm 1 in Appendix A presents the recursive process for the
CELEX data, Algorithm 2 for the GN data.

4.3 Diachronic Information
Diachronic information can be of interest, however, for many applications it is considered as unnecessary
or even unhelpful. Therefore, the script permits users to choose a threshold of similarity within the range
of [0:1] which is compared to a measure we devised based on the Levenshtein distance.

For accepting or rejecting two parts of words, the procedure will calculate the Levensthein distance
(LD) for the strings of the smaller length of the two compared constituents (min(c1, c2)), and then
compare their quotient dis to a threshold t as in (9):

dis =
LD

min(c1, c2)
≤ t (9)

For calculating the dissimilarity quotient of the example (1), in (10) the stem of the derived form (e.g.
treib) and its component (e.g. driften) are reduced to the smaller size of these forms. In this case, the
smaller length is 5. After this, the quotient of LD and the length is compared to the threshold. (10) shows
that the analysis will stop for a threshold at 0.8 or below.

LD

min(c1, c2)
=

4

5
(10)

Just in case, that singular variations were needed, we also added a small list of exceptions.

4.4 Formats of output
The output can be configured in many ways. The following options are available:

• Depth of analysis for compounds
• Parts of speech for the constructs and/or the smallest constituents
• Choice of the output format (parentheses or a notation with | for the splits on the same level)
• Addition of filler letters for GN
• Transfering the GN annotation scheme to CELEX scheme
• Removing compounds with proper names and/or foreign words as constituents for GN
• Analysis of conversions for CELEX
• Depth of analysis for conversions for CELEX
• Dissimilarity measure for CELEX diachronic analyses

The analyses in (11) for (3) and a complex compound containing (3) as a constituent are from the
GN part in the format without any linguistic information. Due to combination of ambiguous entries, it
comprises multiples trees for some forms. Example (12) shows an output for CELEX data of the same
form in parenthesis notation. Here only one analysis is assigned to the word form with the verb as a result
of conversion from the noun. More examples are given in the Appendix.

151

Werkstück Werk|Stück ‘work(noun)|piece’
Werkstück werken|Stück ‘to work|piece’
Glaswerkstück Glas|(Werk|Stück) ‘glass|work(noun)|piece’
Glaswerkstück Glas|(werken|Stück) ‘glass|to work|piece’

(12) Werkstück (*werken_V* (Werk_N)(en_x))(Stück_N) ‘(*to work_V* (work_N)(en(suffix))(piece_N)’

5 Merging the trees

The CELEX trees comprise not only compounds but also deep-level analyses of derivatives and conver-
sions, while the GNmorphological data is restricted to compound nouns which are partially very complex.
For instance, the flat analysis of Währungsausgleichsfond ‘currency adjustment fond’ (13) from the GN
database can be recursively augmented to the tree in (14). Its constituent Ausgleich ‘adjustment’ is not
further analyzed within the GN database, but has an entry as a complex conversion (15) in the CELEX
database. Therefore, the combination of both sets and their parameters for building complex trees seems
promising.

(13) Währungsausgleich_N|s_x|Fonds_N ‘currency adjustment|filler letters|fund’

(14) (*Währungsausgleich_N* Währung_N|s_x|Ausgleich_N)|s_x|Fonds_N)
‘(*currency adjustment_N* currency_N|s_x|adjustment_N)|s_x|fund_N’

(15) Ausgleich (*ausgleichen_V* aus_x|(*gleichen_V* gleich_A|en_x))‘adjustment (*to adjust_V aus(prefix)_x|(*to equal_V equal_A|en(suffix)_x))’

Moreover, GN compounds which were formerly excluded during the procedure of data extraction because
their part of speech categories are missing inside the database (see 3.2), can be assigned the category
from CELEX if available.

The main problem consists in two annotation sets and their different classification schemes, especially
for roots. Table (1) shows the mapping. While the main part-of-speech categories are almost perfectly
mappable between the CELEX and the GN data, the classification of function words and bound mor-
phemes is less consistent. There are cases of different interpretations with a tendency of CELEX to prefer
affix analyses for cases such as (16) and (17) with a. presenting the GN entry and b. the entry of CELEX.
There are differing analyses of morphological constituency. In (18) GN’s compound analysis is opposed
to the conversion of CELEX. The classes of roots and word groups have the same or complementary
scopes, e.g. (19) and (20) have the same analysis in both sources. We decided to unify the tagset but to
leave different trees such as in (11) and (12) to the choice of the users. Some more complex analyses as
well as the algorithm are presented in Appendix A.

(16) a. Abwasser (ab_P)(Wasser_N) ‘(away_P)(water_N) waste water’b. (ab_x)(Wasser_N) ‘(away_x)(water_N) waste water’

(17) a. afroasiatisch (afro_R)(Asiatisch_N) ‘(afro_R)(Asian_N)’b. afroamerikanisch (afro_x)(amerikanisch_A) ‘(afro_x)(American_A)’

(18) a. Maßnahme (Maß_N)(Nahme_N) ‘(measure_n)(taking_N) measure’b. maßnehmen_V ‘(to measure_take_V) measure’

(19) Kondenswasser (kondens_R)(Wasser_N) ‘(condensed_R)(water_N)’

(20) Zwölftonmusik (zwölf Ton_n)(Musik_N) ‘(twelve tone_n)(music_N)’

6 Results

Table 2 provides the number of the trees for CELEX, GermaNet and their merge in GermanTreebank. The
parameters for the deep-level analyses are 6 for the levels of complex words and 2 for conversions. The
Levenshtein dissimilarity threshold was set to 0.5. Double entries were removed. As the combinatorial
power of GN’s ambiguous trees grows with the depth of the trees, the numbers have to be considered
with a grain of salt. The set of trees in the GermanTreebank consists of the unification of both sources.
For examples, see (21)-(23) in A.

7 Conclusions and future work

This paper decribes our recent work on merging two types of morphological trees from GermaNet and
CELEX. The resulting resource contains 95,506 lemmas connected with 100,986 merged trees and is
currently the biggest available data resource of its kind. In principle, the treebank is extensible and
combinable with other analyses, and we intend to enlarge it. The resource can be especially useful for
all kind of data-intense morphological analyses. We plan to use it especially as a source for depth-level
word analyses in combination with a word splitter.

Example of the Treebank: Augmentation of a GermaNet tree
The following shows how an entry fromGermaNet (GN),Währungsausgleichsfonds ‘currency adjustment
fund’ (24) can be augmented recursively from GN (25) and the CELEX database (26). The complete tree
is presented in (4).
