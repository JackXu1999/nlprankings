Abstract

In spontaneous speech, Mandarin tones that
belong to the same tone category may exhibit
many different contour shapes. We explore the
use of data mining and NLP techniques for un-
derstanding the variability of tones in a large
corpus of Mandarin newscast speech. First,
we adapt a graph-based approach to character-
ize the clusters (fuzzy types) of tone contour
shapes observed in each tone n-gram category.
Second, we show correlations between these
realized contour shape types and a bag of au-
tomatically extracted linguistic features. We
discuss the implications of the current study
within the context of phonological and infor-
mation theory.

1 Introduction

One of the central phenomena of interest in lex-
ical tone production is the deviation of their sur-
face realizations from canonical templates of tone
categories(Xu, 1997; Prom-on et al., 2009; Suren-
dran, 2007). In a tone language, different tone cat-
egories differing in pitch movements can distin-
guish different lexical meanings of a syllable (e.g.,
in Mandarin, the syllable “ma” in a high level pitch
contour means “mother”, whereas the same syl-
lable spoken in a falling pitch contour means “to
scold”). Even though each tone category is de-
fined with a general pitch contour profile (such as
level, rising, falling, etc.), they typically exhibit
great variability in spontaneous speech. As an ex-
ample, Figure 1 shows many different realizations
of Mandarin tone 1, observed during speech pro-
duction experiments in the lab.

Previous works in phonology, speech prosody,
and tone recognition have investigated this vari-
ability by asking questions such as: (1) What fac-
tors contribute to the variability in tone produc-
tion (Xu, 1997)?(2) How can we model the tone
contour trajectory in synthesized speech (Prom-on

et al., 2009)? (3) What features can we use to im-
prove the accuracy of automatic tone recognition
(Surendran, 2007)? Each of the works was driven
by a particular set of theoretical or practical moti-
vations and offered us a slice of understanding into
the problem.

In this work, we are interested in looking at the
tone variability problem from a data mining per-
spective: we explore the structure and distribution
of tone contour shapes within a large amount of
data. By taking a data mining approach, we con-
trast our work with those works that focus on tone
recognition or tone learning (either by machine or
by human): we seek to extract tone patterns of em-
pirical significance from a large data set of tones
from spontaneous speech.

Working with the MCPST corpus (see Section
3) of Mandarin newscast speech (about 100,000
tones), we ask two questions: (1) For each tone
category, what are the (coarse) types/classes of
tone contour shapes we observe in this corpus? (2)
For a particular tone category, what linguistic fac-
tors caused the same tone to be realized as these
different types of shapes?

Inspired by works in natural language process-
ing (NLP), we further extend these research ques-
tions in two directions. First, we extend our in-
vestigation of tone categories into a series of n
consecutive tones, or tone n-grams. N -grams is
a classic technique in NLP language modeling1,
whereas in the current context, we study tone n-
grams due to the importance of context in tone
variability (Xu, 1997): a tone category maybe re-
alized differently depending on their neighboring
tones. What can we learn from data mining tone
contour shapes for tone unigrams, bigrams, and
trigrams?

data, we use automatic methods (NLP and other)
to extract linguistic features from the text, includ-
ing Named Entity Recognition (NER), Corefer-
ence resolution, Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, de-
pendency parsing, and other phonological, mor-
phological and contextual features. In order to find
out the importance of these linguistic factors in
shaping tone variability, we run the following ex-
periment: given a particular tone (or tone n-gram)
category, how well can we predict the type of tone
contour shape it will take in running speech, using
these linguistic features that exclude information
about the pitch contour f0 values?

Previous works showed that many linguistic
factors (such as focus, topic, etc.) affect tone pro-
duction or prosody (see Section 2) . In this work,
we extend this to a more comprehensive set of lin-
guistic features, motivated by the information the-
ory account of tone production. We hypothesize
that there exists an information content inequality
resulting from probability distribution of events in
various linguistic domains (phonological, seman-
tic, etc). These inequalities affect speakers’ speech
production, resulting in gradient variants of tone
contour shapes in a given tone category. We in-
vestigate the relative importance of these factors
in predicting the types of contour shapes any par-
ticular tone n-gram will take.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses relevant previous works. Next
we describe the data used in this paper in Sec-
tion 3. In order to characterize the types of con-
tour shapes a tone n-gram will take, we develop
a method to derive clusters of tone contour shape
types using network analysis (Section 4). In Sec-
tion 5, we discuss feature engineering and feature
extraction from various linguistic domains (syn-
tax, morphology, semantics, information structure,
etc.). Section 6 reports machine learning experi-
ments and results on predicting tone contour shape
types and the analysis on feature importance. Fi-
nally, in Section 7 we discuss the implications of
this work in the context of information theory and
phonological theory of speech and tone produc-
tion.

2 Related Work

There has been a long line of research on the vari-
ability of tone contour shapes as well as interfac-
ing between other linguistic factors and prosody
(Li, 2009; Buring, 2013). In linguistic research

speaker in lab speech. Data source: (Xu, 1997). The

level, low rising, low dipping, high falling, where low
and high denote the pitch starting point of the tone.

of Mandarin tones, most works have focused on
the effect of local tonal context (e.g., neighbor-
ing tones and pitch range, such as (Gauthier et al.,
2007; Xu, 1997)) and broader context (e.g., focus,
topic, information structure, long term f0 varia-
tions, such as (Xu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006;
Wang and Xu, 2011)). The data in these works
usually consisted of a small number of tone obser-
vations obtained in speech production experiments
in the lab. They have informed later works on im-
proving the performance of supervised or unsu-
pervised tone recognition ((Levow, 2005; Suren-
dran, 2007) etc.). Other works such as (Surendran,
2007) and (Yu, 2011) have shown the importance
of signals in speech outside of f0 for tone recogni-
tion and learning.

In the PENTA (Xu, 1997, 2005) and qTA (quan-
titative target approximation) models (Prom-on
et al., 2009), the surface f0 contour is viewed as
the result of asymptotic approximation to an un-
derlying pitch target, which can be a static tar-
get (High or Low) or a dynamic target (Rise or
Fall). An important contribution of the qTA is that
it provides a mathematical model to account for
the process of generating of a particular realiza-
tion of a tone template, defined by a pitch target
(with slope and intercept parameters) and the ac-
celeration rate. As such, the specific shape of the
contour then would depend on the starting pitch,
ending pitch target, and how fast the pitch moves.

A fundamental theoretical question is how
should we view the underlying factors that ac-
count for the tone surface variability. Previous re-
search exhibits two opposing theories to this ques-
tion. The first approach (Cooper et al., 1985;
Cooper and Sorenson, 1981) postulates a direct
link between communicative functions and sur-
face acoustic forms by finding the acoustic corre-



146

lates of certain communicative functions, such as
focus, stress, newness, questions, etc. Such ap-
proaches have met criticisms from phonologists
(Ladd, 1996; Liberman and Pierrehumbert, 1984),
who argue that prosodic meanings are not directly
mapped onto acoustic correlates. Instead, into-
national meanings should be first mapped onto
phonological structures, which is in turn linked
to surface acoustic forms through phonetic imple-
mentation rules. In this work, we attempt to show
a new middle ground between these two theories.

3 Data

All the data in this work comes from the Man-
darin Chinese Phonetic Segmentation and Tone
(MCPST) corpus 2, developed by the Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC). It contains 7,849 Man-
darin Chinese newscast speech “utterances” and
their phonetic segmentation and tone labels. Ut-
terances are defined as the time-stamped between-
pause units in the transcribed news recordings. We
used the auto-correlation algorithm implemented
in Praat 3 for f0 (pitch) estimation from speech
audio signal. We obtained f0 pitch contour data
for 100,161 syllables. After pre-processing the
pitch tracks (e.g., speaker-dependent normaliza-
tion, f0 outlier detection and removal, pitch in-
terpolation, downsampling), we generate tone un-
igram, bigram and trigram f0 data sets, giving rise
to a total of 75 unigram (5), bigram (16), and tri-
gram data sets for the prediction task (54) 4. The
total number of tone n-grams in these data sets are
on the order of 250k. All tone unigram, bigram,
and trigram f0 vectors are downsampled to length
of 30, 100, and 200 samples respectively.

4 Deriving tone n-gram contour shape
types through network analysis

4.1 Problem formulation
We define a tone n-gram category as a consecutive
sequence of n tones ti, for i = 1, ..., n, where ti
∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, the five tone categories of Man-
darin. In this paper we restrict n to {1, 2, 3}.

phonetics by computer [Computer program]. Version 6.0.48,

4Mandarin Chinese has four regular tone categories plus
one neutral tone. Since neutral tones occurs infrequently, we
did not include them in the analysis of tone bigrams and tri-
grams due to data sparsity in the conditional distributions.
Similarly, we also excluded ngrams categories where the data
points are sparse.

Given the set S (represented as a network) that
contains all observations of f0 vectors that belong
to a particular tone n-gram category, an algorithm
A, defined in this section, partitions S into k clus-
ters, c1, c2, ..., ck, where all tone contours within ci
are highly similar to each other, and members of ci
maximally distinct from cj for i 6= j. For a partic-
ular tone n-gram category, we define the centroid
f0 vector of ci to be its tone contour shape type ti.

If we denote C to be set of types {c1, c2, ..., ck},
our goal in this section is to describe the algorithm
A that learns a function g : S → C. We adapt an
algorithm first proposed by (Gulati et al., 2016),
which has been shown to be effective in identify-
ing clusters in time-series data such as pitch con-
tours. It also has several advantages over baseline
algorithms such as k-means clustering, including
outlier pruning and no need to determine the num-
ber of clusters before hand.

On a high level, this method represents all tone
contours in a data set as a fully connected network
G. It then filters G using heuristics based on the
pairwise similarity of tone contour shapes. Af-
ter the filtering step, only those nodes that have
a similarity score beyond a threshold will remain
connected. It then leverages network community
detection algorithms to optimize the community
structure, effectively deriving tone contour shape
types T = {t1, t2, ..., tk}.

4.2 Network construction

To construct the network as described above, we
first partition all data in MCPST corpus by their
tone n-gram category. For each category, we con-
struct a network where each node stores the f0
vector of an observation, and the edge between
two nodes holds the Euclidean distance between
the two f0 vectors as weights. We derive an undi-
rected, weighted and fully connected network G
of tone n-gram patterns for each n-gram category.

4.3 Network filtering

In this step, we take a fully connected network G
of a given tone n-gram category and use a princi-
pled method to remove edges from the network.
Our goal is to find an appropriate threshold so
that all edges whose weights (distance between
two tone n-gram f0 vectors) are greater than the
threshold will be cut. In the resulting network,
only those nodes representing similar enough tone
contour shapes will remain connected.



147

Specifically, we decide the threshold value by
a six-step process: (1) We search for the ap-
propriate threshold in the set of values Φ ∈
{1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5} for bigrams
and trigrams, Φ ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8} for uni-
grams. These values are empirically chosen; (2)
we iterate over this set of values and each time
apply a threshold to the network; (3) after we ap-
plied the threshold we convert the network to a un-
weighted network G′ where only those nodes that
have a distance below the threshold will remain
connected; (4) we produce a randomized network
Gr by randomly swapping edges from G′ k times
while keeping the degree of the nodes constant,
where k is equal to the number of edges in G′.
This can be seen as producing a maximally ran-
dom network given the degree distribution of the
current network; (5) we compute the difference in
Clustering Coefficient (CC) of both G′ and Gr; (6)
after repeating this for all values in T , we pick the
threshold that has the largest difference of CCs. 5

4.4 Community detection

We use the Louvain algorithm (Blondel et al.,
2008) to perform community detection, in order to
partition the filtered network derived from last step
into communities (clusters) C1, C2, ..., Ck. We
pre-tuned the hyperparameters in the network fil-
tering step so that it will result in a small number
(n < 10) of tightly connected medium-sized com-
munities. Figure 2 shows a histogram of number
of shape classes for unigram, bigram, and trigram
data sets.

4.5 Outlier community filtering

We propose an extra step of outlier community
filtering before deriving our final contour profile
classes. In this step, we use a heuristic threshold
of t = 10 to filter out any communities (clusters)
with a size less than t.

4.6 Evaluation of tone contour profile classes

We have leveraged the intrinsic structure of the
tone data to derive the tone contour shape types for

5Clustering coefficient (CC) measures the extent to which
the nodes in a network tend to cluster together. Intuitively, it
expresses how saturated the network is — how many of the
possible connections are actually expressed. The CC for a
network of k nodes and n edges is computed as:

each tone n-gram category. Figure 3 shows exam-
ples of learned clusters of tone contour shape types
from two n-gram categories of tone unigram, bi-
gram, and trigram, respectively. Without declar-
ing any cognitive or phonological significance of
these clusters, these resulting clusters should re-
flect the similarities of tone contour shapes within
any given tone n-gram category: those that are
highly similar are grouped into the same clus-
ter. This is an intrinsic property derived from the
above method, and is a necessary property suffi-
cient for carrying out the subsequent experiment
on predicting the tone contour shape types from
linguistic factors.

Nonetheless, we propose two different ways to
evaluate the validity of these clusters. First, in the
following experiments, we show that we are able
to predict these learned tone contour shape types
significantly better than randomly assigned clus-
ters (Section 6.2, Figure 4). Second, we train a
decision tree classifier to predict the shape type of
a given tone n-gram using its f0 vector and ob-
tained a mean accuracy of 92% (following (Zhang,
2016)). This indicates how well these tone contour
shape types can be predicted with complete infor-
mation of its pitch trajectory, which will serve as
an upper bound to our next prediction task using
linguistic factors without information about pitch
movements f0 values.

emerged from each tone n-gram category in the
corpus, we now describe the linguistic features

gram will take. All syntactic and semantic features
are extracted using Stanford CoreNLP for Chinese
(Manning et al., 2014).

5.1 Syntactic features

Syntax and prosody has been the subject of in-
vestigation in (psycho)linguistic studies (Bard and
Aylett, 1999). We extract the part-of-speech (POS)
tags for all syllables in a tone n-gram. In addition,
we also extract the dependency function (Chen
and Manning, 2014) of all syllables in the tone n-
gram. Therefore there are 2 ∗N syntactic features
where N is the number of syllables included in the
tone n-gram data under consideration. The origi-
nal tag set used in CoreNLP comes from Penn Chi-
nese Treebank6 and is too fine grained. To avoid
data sparseness, we collapsed several categories.
For both POS tags and dependency edge function
categories, we compute their distributions using
the original tag set and we collapse any categories
that appear less than 5 times in the data. For POS
tags we mapped the original 33 tags onto 5 cat-
egories. For dependency functions, we collapsed
all tags with a subcategory separated by a colon
(e.g., “advmod:loc”, “advmod:rcomp”, mapped to

6https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T21

“advmod” etc.).

5.2 Semantic features

We extract two semantic features for a tone n-
gram data point: (1) whether the tone n-gram in-
cludes a named entity; (2) whether the tone n-
gram includes a singleton (as opposed to being
part of a coreference chain in the discourse). Se-
mantic features such as information structure have
been postulated to have an effect on the prosody
domain (Buring, 2013). In particular, given in-
formation may encode prosodic features different
from new information. This could also apply to
named entities vs. non-named entities. Named en-
tities points to definite, specific objects in the real
world. Whether the token is a singleton (i.e., does
not co-refer to an entity with another mention in
the text) or part of a coreference chain can be cor-
related with information structure (Recasens et al.,
2013). That is, a singleton may signify new infor-
mation in discourse, while a non-singleton is part
of a coreference chain with potential antecedent
or anaphor, pointing to potentially a different in-
formation structure. Both can have distinguishing
effects on the mental representations and the pro-
duction of speech prosody (indirectly related to re-



149

dundancy in (Aylett and Turk, 2004)).

5.3 Morphological features

In Mandarin Chinese, each word usually consists
of one to four syllables. Building on the intu-
ition that the first syllable is usually spoken with
higher prominence (e.g., neutral tone, which does
not carry stress, only occurs on word-final posi-
tions), we extract morphological features for each
syllable in the given tone n-gram: whether they
cross word boundary or not. There are n features
in this category in total.

5.4 Phonological features

A basic representation of phonological features is
the identity of phonemes in each syllable of the
n-gram. However, due to the sparseness of this
feature representation, we have designed 7 binary
features to encode the phonological properties of
the syllables in the tone n-gram: (1) whether the
syllable includes a nasal; (2) whether the syllable
includes a dipthong; (3) whether the syllable in-
cludes a high vowel; (4) whether the syllable in-
cludes a low vowel; (5) whether the syllable in-
cludes a front vowel; (6) whether the syllable in-
cludes a back vowel; (7) whether the syllable in-
cludes a round vowel. In addition, we add two
contextual tone features: the tone identity of the
previous and following syllables of the tone n-
gram in question.

5.5 Other features

We add two pitch features to the feature set: the
beginning and ending pitch of the tone n-gram.
This is based on the notion in generative Mandarin
tone modeling (Parallel ENcoding and Target Ap-
proximation model, or PENTA) that in speech pro-
duction, the actual realized tone shape of a given
tone category highly depends on the starting point
of the pitch contour and its distance to the actual
pitch target of the current tone, which affects its
course of trajectory when it approximates the tar-
get (Prom-on et al., 2009). An additional feature
to be included is the position of the current tone n-
gram within the context of the current sentence as
a percentage. It is a known effect that pitch tends
to downdrift in speech production as sentence pro-
gresses (Wang and Xu, 2011). Therefore, we also
want to account for the effect of sentence position.

5.6 Bag of features

In this task, we note that the unit of feature ex-
traction is not as straightforward as it would be
in classic NLP tasks. That is, instead of a typi-
cal syntactic constituent (word, phrase, sentences)
as the feature extraction unit, here, our target is
tone n-gram, a sequence of n syllables that may or
may not be a syntactic constituent. As described
above, in many features we have adopted a “Bag of
features” approach (similar to the speech corefer-
ence resolution work in Roesiger et al. (Röesiger
and Riester, 2015)) where each feature describes
whether the n-gram contains a certain target value
in any position. For some other features, we sim-
ply use a set of n features applied to each syllable
in the n-gram in question. These are precisely de-
scribed in Table 1.

6 Predicting tone contour profiles

6.1 Experimental setup

For each of the 5 unigram, 16 bigram, and 54 tri-
gram data sets, the extracted linguistic feature vec-
tor (f1, f2, ..., fm) forms the input space X . The
contour shape types T forms the output space Y .
Our goal is to learn a function h : X → Y min-
imizing expected loss. We use SVM with linear
kernel so that we can extract feature importance
in subsequent analyses. Each data set is randomly
split into 90/10 for train and test. Since the classes

6.2 Results

To visualize model performances on a large num-
ber of tone n-gram data sets (75), we choose the
boxplot because of its efficiency to convey statis-
tical information of the distribution of the results
across all data sets. Figure 4 gives an overview of
our proposed model classification accuracies for
all unigram(U), bigram(B), and trigram(T) data
sets, as compared to several baselines. In this
figure, data, dfp, no syn, no Ntone, and
no pitch denote results using different sets of
features: full set, start/end pitch only, no syn-
tactic features, no prev/next tone features, and
no start/end pitch features, respectively. The
random baseline uses the same set of linguistic
features as our proposed model but the target tone
contour shape type is randomly assigned (while
keeping the number of shape types constant). Fi-
nally, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
baseline reflects chance level performance if lin-
guistic factors are independent from the output
tone contour shape types, and is calculated as 1/d,
where d is the number of output classes in a data
set.

First, the proposed model significantly outper-
forms MLE baselines for unigrams, bigrams, and
trigrams. Second, the accuracy for predicting
learned tone contour shape types is significantly
higher than randomly assigned clusters. This
serves as a sanity check for the validity of these
learned tone contour shape types. Overall, this re-
sult supports the hypothesis that a variety of lin-
guistic and contextual features are strongly corre-
lated with the realization of a particular category
of tone n-grams. In particular, we observe that us-
ing the set of features excluding the syntactic fea-
tures (POS tags and dependency functions) allows
the model to achieve the best median accuracy in

all n-grams (no syn baseline). In Section 6.3, we
provide a more detailed analysis and discussion of
feature importance.

A significant trend to note in Figure 4 is that we
observe a negative correlation between the model
accuracy and the baseline (MLE, random) accu-
racy as the value of n becomes larger in n-grams.
This is striking because it indicates a decrease in
predictive power as n grows larger. Moreover, the
variance on model accuracy also increases as n be-
comes larger. From inspecting the tone contour
shape types we obtained (such as those showed in
Figure 3), we attribute this to three factors from
the data perspective: (1) the dimensionality of un-
igram, bigram, and trigram f0 vectors in our data
set are different (increase); (2) the number of data
sets also increases as n grew larger; (3) the com-
plexity of tone contour shapes tend to increase
from unigram to bigram to trigram. On a linguistic
level, we hypothesize that the longer the window
of n-grams, the stronger an effect of unaccounted
factors come into play (longer range prosodic fac-
tors such as focus and topic, as demonstrated in
(Xu et al., 2004)).

Figure 6: Feature weights for all bigram data sets.

6.3 Feature importance

To analyze feature importance, we extracted
weight vectors (coefficients) associated with all
features in the linear SVM classifiers (following
(Guyon et al., 2002)) for all data sets in each of
the n-grams. We take the absolute values of fea-
ture weights and normalize them to be compara-
ble across data sets. We then aggregated feature
weights for all classes and across all data sets in a
given n-gram.

Figure 5, 6, 7 show the distribution of feature
weights (importance) for all features for unigram,
brigram, and trigram data. Since feature impor-
tance values tend to behave similarly according
to their linguistic domains, we group them to-
gether instead of analyzing the features individu-
ally. We observe three levels of feature importance
based on the weights, consistent among different
n-grams: (1) High: starting pitch, ending pitch,
and sentence position (especially when n > 1).
The importance of starting and ending pitch is
consistent with the qTA model of Mandarin tones
(Prom-on et al., 2009). The latter (sentence po-
sition) is consistent with the effect of downdrift
(Wang and Xu, 2011). (2) Medium: Phonological
features and morphological token boundary fea-
tures, as well as coreference (singleton) and entity,
which are information structure of the discourse
and semantics (givenness, newness of information
in speech). (3) Low: Syntactic (pos tag, depen-
dency functions) and contextual features (previous
and next tone). This is consistent with (Bard and
Aylett, 1999) and (Surendran, 2007)7.

7Specifically, (Bard and Aylett, 1999) showed the dis-
sociation of syntax with de-accent in spontaneous speech,
and (Surendran, 2007) showed that context did not help tone

To have a more detailed understanding of the
feature importance, Figure 4 shows how the model
performs with partially ablated feature sets across
different n-grams. First, to understand the role of
start/end pitch vs. non-pitch linguistic features, we
observe that the dfp baseline (using only start/end
pitch features) has lower results than other mod-
els with linguistic features. This is true for all
the markers on the boxplots (min, max, first quan-
tile, median, third quantile) when comparing dfp
to no syn. However, there is also considerable
overlap in these accuracy distributions to different
degrees as n varies, which indicates cases where
the dfp baseline outperforms the other models
with more linguistic features. To see this possi-
bility, we plotted the difference (delta) in accura-
cies values for all data sets for the pair of baselines
no syn - dfp in Figure 8. It shows that for 80%
of the data sets, the no syn baseline with linguis-
tic features outperforms the pitch-only baseline in
most data sets by a margin of less than 20% in ac-
curacy improvements.

Second, comparing across different n-grams,
the no pitch baseline (only linguistic features)
performs worse in unigram, and the best in tri-
grams. This shows that the pitch feature is less
important when n becomes larger in n-grams.
The same trend is observed in the weights of the
pitch features in feature importance. This ob-
servation is also consistent with (Prom-on et al.,
2009): the target approximation of tones only op-
erates on the syllable units. Therefore the ef-
fect of start/end pitch should diminish when n>1.
Third, even though feature weights are small for
previous/next tones, in these results we didn’t see
an improvement when we exclude these features
in the no Ntone baseline. Finally, we confirm
the importance of the non-pitch linguistic features
since the no pitch baseline significantly outper-
forms the random and the MLE baselines.

7 Discussion

In this work, we first described a method to mine
tone contour shape types from a large amount of
tone data. These shape types, as well as those
mined from tone n-grams with larger values of
n (n>3), can be further analyzed with linguistic
knowledge to better understand the behaviors of
tones in different tonal contexts in future works.
We also showed that using linguistic and contex-

recognition as much as expected.

tual factors, we can predict with reasonable accu-
racy the contour shape type that a tone n-gram will
take in the MCPST data. We analyzed the feature
importance to form a relative ranking of the lin-
guistic factors. These results should be interpreted
with caution because they are constrained by the
particular representations of the linguistic features
used in this study, as well as the accuracy of the
NLP softwares used to extract them. Nonethe-
less, we envision that by mining correlates be-
tween speech prosody and automatic analysis of
linguistic features extracted from the data, this line
of work could have potential applications in im-
proving the quality and naturalness of prosody in
speech synthesis such as Text-To-Speech (TTS)
technologies.

Previous works targeting information theory
and information structure in prosody domain have
largely looked at acoustic correlates directly, such
as accent and duration, all of which may in turn
have an impact on the shape of tone contours in
speech production. Therefore, looking at tone
contour shapes can be thought of as a differ-
ent level of manifestation of such phenomena, an
amalgamation of single dimension acoustic cor-
relates (e.g., duration and intensity). It is also a
level that is more difficult to quantify and mea-
sure in the traditional linguistic/phonetic investi-
gations on a smaller scale. One possible exten-
sion of this work in the future is to look at specific
ways tone contour shapes correlate with particular
features when they are perturbed in a certain direc-
tion. Moreover, it is also of interest to demonstrate
this change in a quantified manner using the infor-
mation theory formulation.

retical question of whether there is a direct link
between communicative functions and surface
acoustic forms, a question that we found disagree-
ment in literature (as summarized in (Xu, 2005)
and in Section 2 of the current paper). In this pa-
per, we showed that by taking a data driven ap-
proach, we can predict the contour shape type of
a prosodic category (such as a tone n-gram) using
linguistic factors, even though we are not predict-
ing its exact shape. In doing so, we give an ap-
proximate solution for a middle ground between
the two theories.
