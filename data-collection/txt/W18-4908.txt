Abstract

We shed light on aspects of the relation between the semantics and the syntactic flexibility of
multiword expressions (MWE) by investigating fixed adjective similes (FS), a predicative. MWE
class not studied in this respect before.Wework onModernGreek data1 and find that only a subset
of the observed syntactic structures is related with idiomaticity. We identify and measure two
aspects of semantic idiomaticity, one of which seems to allow to predict FS syntactic flexibility.
Our research draws on a resource developed with the semantic and detailed syntactic annotation
of web-retrieved material, indicating frequency of use of the individual similes.

1 Introduction

The relation between the idiomatic semantics of multiword expressions (MWE) and their syntactic
flexibility, namely the ability of a MWE to occur in different syntactic configurations without loss of the
idiomatic meaning, has offered a fertile field of research because it challenges the notion of composition-
ality, namely the derivation of the meaning of an utterance from the meaning of its components and its
syntactic structure. The (predicative) free subject verb MWEs of the type verb+noun (V+N) have been
one of the privileged fields of these studies. We add to the understanding of this relation by investigating
a class of predicative (non-verb) MWEs that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied from this
point of view so far, namely the class of fixed similes (FS) of the type adjective+connector+(article)+noun
such as sweet like honey. Modern Greek, a lesser studied language in this respect, is our object language.
We ask whether the occurrence of the syntactic structures considered as manifestations of syntactic flex-
ibility is related with (idiomatic) semantics and we find that this holds only for some structures –a subset
of which could be characterised as syntactic alternatives. Our results corroborate the idea that syntactic
structures demonstrate varying sensitivity to the semantics of their components and that the presence of
syntactic variants may not be dependent only on idiomatic semantics. Next, we investigate the notion of
idiomaticity. We understand idiomaticity as the degree of similarity between the FS semantics and the
semantics of their free property (i.e., the free adjective, see Table 1) and, we identify and measure two
types of similarity, one of which allows us to make predictions about FS syntactic flexibility. Our results
were drawn from a resource developed as part of the research presented here by extensively annotating
a large amount of web-retrieved unique FS usage examples. The special feature of this resource is that it
offers an as good as possible approximation of the actual FS usage in texts, both in terms of frequency
and in terms of structure selection.
Table 1 shows the terminology for the parts of an FS adopted from Hanks (2005):

2 Related work

Simile is a figure of speech, which, unlike metaphor, draws attention to the likeness between the tenor
and the vehicle that are implied to share certain properties (Veale and Hao, 2007). Similes draw on con-
ventional beliefs about likeness and effectively convey the speaker’s superlative evaluation of the tenor
(Israel et al., 2004). They follow the same structure as comparative, e.g. Knowledge is sweeter than
honey, equative, e.g. Her argument was as clear as glass and similative statements, e.g. My hands were
cold like ice (Chila-Markopoulou, 1986; Israel et al., 2004; Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2014;
Mpouli and Ganascia, 2015). Many conventional similes tend to be fixed and have idiom status (Hanks,
2005). For instance, FS6 κόκκινος σαν αστακός (kokinos san astakos) ‘red as lobster’ (see Table 2) ap-
plies mainly to persons or body (parts) (96,4% in our data) to denote blushing or sunburned people; this
meaning can not be derived from the parts of the FS. Some English FS tend to select tenors from a small
range of semantic fields (Mpouli and Ganascia, 2015); for Greek see Figure 1. FS have been found to
share a good part of simile usage in English (Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2014).
Modern Greek FS assume the syntactic functions of the adjectives (Markantonatou et al., 2016). They

appear as complements of the copula (1), as phrasal adjuncts controlled by the subject of the main verb
(3), in verbless sentences (4), in the typical adjective position between the determiner and the noun (5)
and, rarely, as subjects and objects of verbs or prepositions. In all these structures, FS can be replaced
with the superlative of the adjective (exemplified only for the complement of copula (2)). They may
occur with the adverb πολύ (poli) ‘much’ or, rarely, with some other intensifying adverb. In this case,
the simile is not pronounced as a unit but as if a punctuation mark existed between the property and the
σαν+vehicle part. We annotated these structures as empp (phrasal emphasis (Table 3)). We will treat FS
as MWE adjectives.

Computationalmethods distinguishing between similes and other comparisons take advantage of the at-
tested semantic distance between the similes’ tenor and vehicle and of definiteness (Niculae and Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil, 2014). Ηοwever, we show that in Modern Greek, determiner distribution is independent
of FS idiomaticity (§4.1).
The study of large amounts of data of V+NMWEs has shown that MWE syntactic flexibility is related

to MWE idiomaticity modeled as the semantic distance between the environments where the MWE and
its parts occur (Fazly et al., 2009). Our research on FS sheds more light on this attested relation.
A much debated proposal claims that MWE syntactic flexibility is related with MWE semantic

analysability, namely the degree to which the idiomatic semantics of the MWE can be derived syntheti-
cally from the (idiomatic) meanings of its parts (indicatively, Nunberg et al. (1994), Kay and Sag (2012)
argue in favor of the syntactic analysability approach and Laporte (2018) argues against it). Interestingly,
(Kay and Sag, 2012, 4) maintain that while “meaningful idiom words can be modified and can appear in
syntactic contexts that meaningless ones cannot”, only those language structures that “do not entail inter-
pretive consequences (as does, for example, English topicalization) are precisely the syntactic contexts
that permit meaningless idiom words to be “displaced.”” We demonstrate that the syntactic environments
in which FS occur can be split into FS semantics sensitive and insensitive ones.

3.1 Data collection
With a tailor-made Facebook application (Mitrović and Markantonatou, 2018) we asked 260 native

speakers of Modern Greek to specify which of 152 similes they would use in their everyday exc hange.2
Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) was used to evaluate inter-speaker agree-
ment. 85 similes were found to be used by a critical number of speakers. According to Baldwin and Kim

2The similes were collected from the Hellenic National Corpus (HNC), http://hnc.ilsp.gr/, and a corpus of 100 million words
that was collected with crawlers. The corpora were searched for the pattern adjective+σαν+noun and only structures that ap-
peared more than once were retained.



54

(2010), the selected similes can be considered MWEs because (i) they fulfill the statistical idiomaticity
criterion; as explained in §3.2, the similes are subject to minimal lexical variation (ii) most of them fulfill
the semantic idiomaticity criterion (§2). Of them, we selected 20 FS (Table 2) that represent the classes
defined in two different simile classifications by the semantics of the vehicle and of the property, one of
Modern Greek FS (Mpolla-Mavridou, 1996) and one of English similes (Hanks, 2005). A corpus consist-
ing of 4900 unique usage examples (instances from now on) was collected from the web with exhaustive
searches, which allowed our resource to represent instance frequency.3 Regular expressions were used
to capture the rich morphology of Modern Greek, its flexible word order as well as lexical and syntactic
variation. The retrieved material was cleaned from multiple occurrences of the same instance and from
machine translation outputs. Table 2 shows the distribution of instances per FS in the corpus.

3.2 Lexical and syntactic variation in the case of Modern Greek FS

Lexical variation is not attested for most FS in our data (Table 2). The adjectives άσπρος (aspros)
‘white’, οπλισμένος (oplismenos) ‘armed’ and γρήγορος (grigoros) ‘fast’ variate between synonyms that
differ in terms of style and the variants occur in considerable frequencies. FS1 άσπρος σαν το πανί (aspros
san to pani) ‘as white as sheet’ is exceptional because there is a small number of adjectives with the
sense pale that variate with άσπρος: κίτρινος (kitrinos) ‘yellow’, ωχρός (ochros) ‘ashy, ghostly’, χλωμός
(chlomos) ‘pale’. FS10 πιστός σαν σκύλος (pistos san skilos.masc) ‘as faithful as a dog’, variates with
πιστός σαν σκυλί (pistos san skili.neut) because the vehicle occurs in both genders.
Syntactic variation is more frequent in our data. The FS alternative with connector σαν (san) ‘like, as’

(6) is themost frequently used form,whichwewill call the normative form. The same property and vehicle
may appear in a comparative structure; (7) features a morphological comparative form and (8) a phrasal
one (Chila-Markopoulou, 1986). They can also appear in an equative form (9). Similar observations have
been made for English (Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil (2014); Mpouli and Ganascia (2015)).
We will use the term FS alternative to refer to syntactic variations (6)-(10): we have also treated as FS
alternatives the structures that contain a punctuation mark (comma, full stop, dots) between the property
and the connector+vehicle part of the FS (10) provided that the parts on either side of the punctuation
mark are predicated of the same entity.

3.3 Syntactic and semantic annotation
Syntactic annotationmodeled FS syntactic flexibility; it captured the normative form and the deviations

from it observed in the data, including FS alternatives. As Greek FS function as adjective MWEs (§2),
we assume that their semantics is represented by the semantics of the NPs they select as tenors (Table
1). We used WordNet supersenses to annotate the tenors; this detailed semantic annotation allowed us to
distinguish between types of idiomaticity. In the remainder, we will use the term FS semantics to denote
the set of semantic annotations assigned to the tenors of a particular FS in the resource. High degrees of
inter-annotator agreement were obtained as confirmed by Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient.

3.3.1 Syntactic annotation
Table 3 summarises the labels used to annotate syntactic flexibility. The last four lines of Table 3 show

the FS alternants. The annotators used a manual developed for this purpose.

Label Phenomenon Example-Litteral Translation

ixp-w word (not tenor) after property elafri poli san pupulo (light much like feather)

ixp-punc punctuation after property elafris, san pupulo (light, like feather)

Table 3: The labels for syntactic flexibility annotation.

To check inter-annotator agreement 630 instances (12,9% of the data), representing 6 FS (FS19, FS18,
FS12, FS11, FS9, FS8), were annotated by 3 linguists. Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient was equal to 0.91.

3.3.2 Semantic annotation
WordNet supersenses were used to semantically annotate the tenors (Schneider et al., 2013; Schneider

and Smith, 2015). No sufficient WordNets are available for Modern Greek, so we translated Greek tenors
into English. In case of pronouns or pro-drop phenomena, the tenor was induced from the context.
To check inter-annotator agreement 2400 instances (49% of the data), representing 4 FS (FS20, FS19,

FS18, FS1), were annotated by 5 linguists. Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient was equal to 0.95.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of semantic categories of tenors in the resource. We see that FS (at

least, the ones we studied) mainly describe humans and that they select a small set of semantic categories
(Mpouli and Ganascia, 2015), which partly explains the high inter-annotator agreement.

3.4 The Flat-Folia resource
To make the annotated resource5 machine-readable, extensible and reusable, we converted it to Folia

format (van Gompel and Reynaert, 2013), an XML-based format for linguistic annotation. We use the
4MWE1: elafri to choma pu ton skiepazi, lit. light the soil that covers him (it is said for those who have passed away), FS:

elafris san pupulo ‘as light as a feather’.

4 Investigating the resource

4.1 The relation between syntactic flexibility and tenor semantics
Shannon entropy is used as a measure of the syntactic and semantic diversity (Manning and Schütze,

1999; Lebani et al., 2015). For the syntactic entropy, each FS instance is represented as a vector including
binary values of the syntactic features defined in Table 3 (presence or absence of a feature). Thus, syntactic
entropy is measured according to the distinct vectors and their frequency. Semantic entropy is measured
by the number of occurrences of each semantic category (Figure 1).
Pearson correlation coefficient (Benesty et al., 2009) showed a strong positive linear relationship be-

tween the syntactic and semantic diversity (equal to 0.84 with p − value = 3.2 · 10−6), across the FS
for the syntactic features constr, comp, toso, ixp-punc, ixp-creative, ixp-n, empp, mwo. We observe a
positive relation between fixedness and semantic idiomaticity, also observed for V+N MWEs (Fazly and
Stevenson, 2007). Correlation improved for the aforementioned syntactic features and deteriorated for
the features iwo, ixp-w, mod, var, det, empm (Table 3). This result is reminiscent of the (Kay and Sag,
2012, 4) observation that syntactic contexts may or may not interfere with MWE semantics (§2). The
relation between the syntactic and semantic diversity of each FS is depicted in Figure 2.

4.2 Classification of FS by syntactic flexibility

Clustering over the vectors including binary values of the syntactic features (presence or absence of
a feature) failed to produce an FS classification by syntactic flexibility (such as the one proposed for
all MWEs in Sag et al. (2002)); rather, it produced interesting FS instance clusters. We applied Logistic
Principal Component Analysis (LPCA) (Landgraf and Lee, 2015) to achieve dimensionality reduction
and to visualize the FS instances in two dimensions. The k-Means algorithm7 is used to separate the
data in k clusters of FS instances, where the instances in each cluster are expected to have similar char-
acteristics (Berkhin, 2006). Although the instances could be analyzed in more clusters employing more
complicated clustering algorithms, in this initial approach, we identify significant knowledge in a more
general separation, as we describe below.

Figure 3: Clustering FS instances.

When all syntactic features are used, we obtain six clusters (Figure 3(i)) with prominent features det,
var, comp and constr. Only constr’s and comp’s syntactic diversity correlates with tenor’s semantic di-
versity (§4.1). The most frequent features by cluster are: cluster 1, constr (the normative form); cluster
2, det, var; cluster 3, det; cluster 4, var; cluster 5, det, comp, constr; cluster 6, det, comp, constr, var.
When only the syntactic flexibility features that contribute positively to the flexibility-idiomatic se-

mantics correlation are used (§4.1), we obtain four clusters (Figure 3(ii)) with prominent features constr,
comp, ixp-punc and toso. The most frequent features by cluster are: cluster 1, constr (the normative form,
i.e. absence of any syntactic feature); cluster 2, comp, constr; cluster 3, ixp-punc, constr; cluster 4, toso,
constr. The feature constr occurs in the clusters 2, 3 & 4, so these clusters can be characterized by their
other features comp, ixp-punc and toso. The four structures are the FS alternatives (§3) that more or less
partition the set of FS instances (only ixp-punc co-occurs with the other FS alternatives, very rarely).
Geeraert et al. (2017), using eyetracking, identified lexical variation (corresponding to our feature var)

as one of the “easiest” MWE variations for English in terms of comprehension. This might indicate that
MWE variations that are “easy” in terms of comprehension are, at the same time, independent of MWE
idiomaticity and “more prominent” than other syntactic structures in the speakers’ output.

4.3 Predicting syntactic flexibility

To better understand the relation between semantic and syntactic diversity, we sought a quantitative
definition of idiomaticity. Intuitively, since FS function as MWE adjectives (§2), rather than defining
idiomaticity as the distance of the context of the constituents of the FS from the context of the FS itself
(Fazly and Stevenson, 2007), we defined it as the similarity between the tenor semantics and the semantics
of the NPs selected by the free property of the FS. For instance, we calculated the similarity between
the semantics of the tenors of FS1 άσπρος σαν το πανί (aspros san to pani) ‘as white as a sheet’ and
the semantics of the NPs selected by the free occurrences of the adjective άσπρος (aspros) ‘white’. We
defined two measures of semantic similarity:

7The popular k-means algorithm is sufficient because the obtained clusters have clear limits.



58

Semantic similarity measure 1 (SSM1): Cosine similarity (Manning and Schütze, 1999) based on
frequency is applied to the vectors of the two sets of supersenses described above, which include the
frequency of each supersense, for instance, the frequency of the supersense person in the semantics of
FS1 and in the semantics of the NPs selected by the FS’s free property. To ensure comparability of the
vectors, frequencies have been normalized in the range zero to one.
Semantic similaritymeasure 2 (SSM2): Cosine similarity based on binary vectors: the vectors of both

supersence sets which include only the presence or absence (i.e. 1 or 0, respectively) of each supersense.
For instance, FS1 selects 7 semantic categories and the respective free adjective selects 17; 5 semantic
categories occur in both sets.

(ii) Relation between semantic diversity and SSM2.

Figure 4: The linear relation between syntactic diversity or semantic diversity and semantic similarity
measure 2 (SSM2).

For each property of the 20 FS, we retrieved the first 200 unique instances from the HNC.We excluded
MWEs involving the adjectives, for instance, for the property κόκκινος (kokinos) ‘red’ we excluded the
occurrences of κόκκινη γραμμή (kokini grami) ‘red line’8. The NPs selected by the adjectives in ques-
tion were annotated semantically with the WordNet supersenses. The results of both semantic similarity
measures are reported in Table 4.
We found that only SSM2 is correlated with syntactic diversity and semantic diversity (only syntactic

flexibility features correlating with syntactic diversity were used (§4.1)). Pearson correlation coefficient
between syntactic diversity and SSM2 is equal to 0.61 with p− value = 4.4 · 10−4 (Figure 4(i) depicts
the correlation) and between semantic diversity and SSM2, it is equal to 0.85 with p − value = 2 ·
10−6 (Figure 4(ii) depicts the strong linear correlation). The positive linear correlation between syntactic
diversity and SSM2 is less strong than between semantic diversity and SSM2 (Figure 4). This might
indicate that some similes tend to be used in particular syntactic configurations, which interfere with the
semantically sensitive syntactic alternants; this is a hypothesis that will be checked with future research.
Because cosine similarity by the semantic categories selected by the FS and its free property correlates

well with the syntactic and semantic diversity of FS, it could be used as a predictor of the semantic
idiomaticity of FS.

8Kόκκινη γραμμή (kokini grami) denotes a boundary or limit which should not be crossed.

5 Conclusion

The quantitative study of the Modern Greek fixed simile (FS) resource adds interesting new aspects to
the understanding of the relation between MWE syntactic flexibility and idiomatic semantics and paves
the way to further research.
We found that cosine similarity by the semantic categories selected by the FS and its free property,

but not cosine similarity by frequency, correlates well with both the syntactic and semantic diversity of
FS and it could be used as a predictor of FS syntactic flexibility and idiomaticity. Furthermore, syntactic
deviations from the normative form can be split in “FS semantics sensitive ” and “FS semantics insensi-
tive” ones. The latter introduce noise in the correlation of idiomaticity and syntactic flexibility and in their
correlation with cosine similarity by semantic categories (SSM2). Finally, the clustering of FS instances
as vectors of syntactic flexibility features showcases some “semantics insensitive syntactic deviations”
as dominant features. The same constructions have been shown by V+N MWE comprehension studies
to require less comprehension effort than other syntactic constructions. If future research shows that a
correlation exists, it may be inferred that, along with idiomatic semantics, syntactic flexibility depends
on certain cognitive factors/skills.
