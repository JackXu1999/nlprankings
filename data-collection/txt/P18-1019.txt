Abstract

We present a corpus of 5,000 richly anno-
tated abstracts of medical articles describ-
ing clinical randomized controlled trials.
Annotations include demarcations of text
spans that describe the Patient population
enrolled, the Interventions studied and to
what they were Compared, and the Out-
comes measured (the ‘PICO’ elements).
These spans are further annotated at a
more granular level, e.g., individual in-
terventions within them are marked and
mapped onto a structured medical vocab-
ulary. We acquired annotations from a di-
verse set of workers with varying levels of
expertise and cost. We describe our data
collection process and the corpus itself in
detail. We then outline a set of challeng-
ing NLP tasks that would aid searching of
the medical literature and the practice of
evidence-based medicine.

1 Introduction

In 2015 alone, about 100 manuscripts describ-
ing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for med-
ical interventions were published every day. It is
thus practically impossible for physicians to know
which is the best medical intervention for a given
patient group and condition (Borah et al., 2017;
Fraser and Dunstan, 2010; Bastian et al., 2010).
This inability to easily search and organize the
published literature impedes the aims of evidence
based medicine (EBM), which aspires to inform
patient care using the totality of relevant evidence.

∗* now at Google Inc.

Computational methods could expedite biomedi-
cal evidence synthesis (Tsafnat et al., 2013; Wal-
lace et al., 2013) and natural language processing
(NLP) in particular can play a key role in the task.

Prior work has explored the use of NLP meth-
ods to automate biomedical evidence extraction
and synthesis (Boudin et al., 2010; Marshall et al.,
2017; Ferracane et al., 2016; Verbeke et al.,
2012).1 But the area has attracted less attention
than it might from the NLP community, due pri-
marily to a dearth of publicly available, annotated
corpora with which to train and evaluate models.

Here we address this gap by introducing EBM-
NLP, a new corpus to power NLP models in sup-
port of EBM. The corpus, accompanying doc-
umentation, baseline model implementations for
the proposed tasks, and all code are publicly avail-
able.2 EBM-NLP comprises ∼5,000 medical ab-
stracts describing clinical trials, multiply anno-
tated in detail with respect to characteristics of the
underlying trial Populations (e.g., diabetics), In-
terventions (insulin), Comparators (placebo) and
Outcomes (blood glucose levels). Collectively,
these key informational pieces are referred to as
PICO elements; they form the basis for well-
formed clinical questions (Huang et al., 2006).

We adopt a hybrid crowdsourced labeling strat-
egy using heterogeneous annotators with vary-
ing expertise and cost, from laypersons to MDs.
Annotators were first tasked with marking text
spans that described the respective PICO ele-
ments. Identified spans were subsequently anno-

1There is even, perhaps inevitably, a systematic review of
such approaches (Jonnalagadda et al., 2015).

tated in greater detail: this entailed finer-grained
labeling of PICO elements and mapping these onto
a normalized vocabulary, and indicating redun-
dancy in the mentions of PICO elements.

In addition, we outline several NLP tasks that
would directly support the practice of EBM and
that may be explored using the introduced re-
source. We present baseline models and associ-
ated results for these tasks.

2 Related Work

We briefly review two lines of research relevant to
the current effort: work on NLP to facilitate EBM,
and research in crowdsourcing for NLP.

2.1 NLP for EBM

Prior work on NLP for EBM has been limited
by the availability of only small corpora, which
have typically provided on the order of a cou-
ple hundred annotated abstracts or articles for
very complex information extraction tasks. For
example, the ExaCT system (Kiritchenko et al.,
2010) applies rules to extract 21 aspects of the
reported trial. It was developed and validated on
a dataset of 182 marked full-text articles. The
ACRES system (Summerscales et al., 2011) pro-
duces summaries of several trial characteristic,
and was trained on 263 annotated abstracts. Hint-
ing at more challenging tasks that can build upon
foundational information extraction, Alamri and
Stevenson (2015) developed methods for detecting
contradictory claims in biomedical papers. Their
corpus of annotated claims contains 259 sentences
(Alamri and Stevenson, 2016).

Larger corpora for EBM tasks have been de-
rived using (noisy) automated annotation ap-
proaches. This approach has been used to build,
e.g., datasets to facilitate work on Information Re-
trieval (IR) models for biomedical texts (Scells
et al., 2017; Chung, 2009; Boudin et al., 2010).
Similar approaches have been used to ‘distantly
supervise’ annotation of full-text articles describ-
ing clinical trials (Wallace et al., 2016). In contrast
to the corpora discussed above, these automati-
cally derived datasets tend to be relatively large,
but they include only shallow annotations.

Other work attempts to bypass basic extraction
tasks and address more complex biomedical QA
and (multi-document) summarization problems to
support EBM (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007;
Mollá and Santiago-Martinez, 2011; Abacha and

Zweigenbaum, 2015). Such systems would di-
rectly benefit from more accurate extraction of the
types codified in the corpus we present here.

2.2 Crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing, which we here define opera-
tionally as the use of distributed lay annotators,
has shown encouraging results in NLP (Novot-
ney and Callison-Burch, 2010; Sabou et al., 2012).
Such annotations are typically imperfect, but
methods that aggregate redundant annotations can
mitigate this problem (Dalvi et al., 2013; Hovy
et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2017).

Medical articles contain relatively technical
content, which intuitively may be difficult for per-
sons without domain expertise to annotate. How-
ever, recent promising preliminary work has found
that crowdsourced approaches can yield surpris-
ingly high-quality annotations in the domain of
EBM specifically (Mortensen et al., 2017; Thomas
et al., 2017; Wallace et al., 2017).

3 Data Collection

PubMed provides access to the MEDLINE
database3 which indexes titles, abstracts and meta-
data for articles from selected medical journals
dating back to the 1970s. MEDLINE indexes over
24 million abstracts; the majority of these have
been manually assigned metadata which we used
to retrieved a set of 5,000 articles describing RCTs
with an emphasis on cardiovascular diseases, can-
cer, and autism. These particular topics were se-
lected to cover a range of common conditions.

We decomposed the annotation process into
two steps, performed in sequence. First, we ac-
quired labels demarcating spans in the text de-
scribing the clinically salient abstract elements
mentioned above: the trial Population, the Inter-
ventions and Comparators studied, and the Out-
comes measured. We collapse Interventions and
Comparators into a single category (I). In the sec-
ond annotation step, we tasked workers with pro-
viding more granular (sub-span) annotations on
these spans.

For each PIO element, all abstracts were anno-
tated with the following four types of information.

1. Spans exhaustive marking of text spans con-
taining information relevant to the respective
PIO categories (Stage 1 annotation).

2. Hierarchical labels assignment of more spe-
cific labels to subsequences comprising the
marked relevant spans (Stage 2 annotation).

3. Repetition grouping of labeled tokens to in-
dicate repeated occurrences of the same in-
formation (Stage 2 annotation).

4. MeSH terms assignment of the metadata
MeSH terms associated with the abstract to
labeled subsequences (Stage 2 annotation).4

We collected annotations for each P, I and O
element individually to avoid the cognitive load
imposed by switching between label sets, and to
reduce the amount of instruction required to be-
gin the task. All annotation was performed using
a modified version of the Brat Rapid Annotation
Tool (BRAT) (Stenetorp et al., 2012). We include
all annotation instructions provided to workers for
all tasks in the Appendix.

3.1 Non-Expert (Layperson) Workers
For large scale crowdsourcing via recruitment of
layperson annotators, we used Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk (AMT). All workers were required to
have an overall job approval rate of at least 90%.
Each job presented to the workers required the an-
notation of three randomly selected abstracts from
our pool of documents. As we received initial re-
sults, we blocked workers who were clearly not
following instructions, and we actively recruited
the best workers to continue working on our task
at a higher pay rate.

4MeSH is a controlled, structured medical vocabulary
maintained by the National Library of Medicine.

We began by collecting the least technical an-
notations, moving on to more difficult tasks only
after restricting our pool of workers to those with
a demonstrated aptitude for the jobs. We obtained
annotations from ≥ 3 different workers for each
of the 5,000 abstracts to enable robust inference of
reliable labels from noisy data. After performing
filtering passes to remove non-RCT documents or
those missing relevant data for the second annota-
tion task, we are left with between 4,000 and 5,000
sets of annotations for each PIO element after the
second phase of annotation.

3.2 Expert Workers

To supplement our larger-scale data collection via
AMT, we collected annotations for 200 abstracts
for each PIO element from workers with advanced
medical training. The idea is for these to serve as
reference annotations, i.e., a test set with which
to evaluate developed NLP systems. We plan to
enlarge this test set in the near future, at which
point we will update the website accordingly.

For the initial span labeling task, two medi-
cal students from the University of Pennsylvania
and Drexel University provided the reference la-
bels. In addition, for both stages of annotation
and for the detailed subspan annotation in Stage
2, we hired three medical professionals via Up-
work,5 an online platform for hiring skilled free-
lancers. After reviewing several dozen suggested
profiles, we selected three workers that had the fol-
lowing characteristics: Advanced medical training

tors, the one exception being a fourth-year medi-
cal student); Strong technical reading and writing
skills; And an interest in medical research. In ad-
dition to providing high-quality annotations, indi-
viduals hired via Upwork also provided feedback
regarding the instructions to help make the task as
clear as possible for the AMT workers.

4 The Corpus

We now present corpus details, paying special at-
tention to worker performance and agreement. We
discuss and present statistics for acquired annota-
tions on spans, tokens, repetition and MeSH terms
in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, respectively.

4.1 Spans

For each P, I and O element, workers were asked
to read the abstract and highlight all spans of
text including any pertinent information. Annota-
tions for 5,000 articles were collected from a total
of 579 AMT workers across the three annotation
types, and expert annotations were collected for
200 articles from two medical students.

We first evaluate the quality of the annota-
tions by calculating token-wise label agreement
between the expert annotators; this is reported in
Table 2. Due to the difficulty and technicality of
the material, agreement between even well-trained
domain experts is imperfect. The effect is magni-
fied by the unreliability of AMT workers, moti-
vating our strategy of collecting several noisy an-
notations and aggregating over them to produce a
single cleaner annotation. We tested three differ-
ent aggregation strategies: a simple majority vote,
the Dawid-Skene model (Dawid and Skene, 1979)
which estimates worker reliability, and HMM-
Crowd, a recent extension to Dawid-Skene that in-
cludes a HMM component, thus explicitly lever-
aging the sequential structure of contiguous spans
of words (Nguyen et al., 2017).

For each aggregation strategy, we compute the
token-wise precision and recall of the output la-
bels against the unioned expert labels. As shown
in Table 3, the HMMCrowd model afforded mod-
est improvement in F-1 scores over the standard
Dawid-Skene model, and was thus used to gener-
ate the inputs for the second annotation phase.

The limited overlap in the document subsets an-
notated by any given pair of workers, and wide
variation in the number of annotations per worker
make interpretation of standard agreement statis-

tics tricky. We quantify the centrality of the AMT
span annotations by calculating token-wise preci-
sion and recall for each annotation against the ag-
gregated version of the labels (Table 4).

When comparing the average precision and re-
call for individual crowdworkers against the ag-
gregated labels in Table 4, scores are poor show-
ing very low agreement between the workers. De-
spite this, the aggregated labels compare favorably
against the expert labels. This further supports the
intuition that it is feasible to collect multiple low-
quality annotations for a document and synthesize
them to extract the signal from the noise.

On the dataset website, we provide a variant
of the corpus that includes all individual worker
span annotations (e.g., for researchers interested in
crowd annotation aggregated methods), and also a
version with pre-aggregated annotations for con-
venience.

4.2 Hierarchical Labels

For each P, I, and O category we developed a hier-
archy of labels intended to capture important sub
categories within these. Our labels are aligned
to (and thus compatible with) the concepts codi-
fied by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vo-
cabulary of medical terms maintained by the Na-
tional Library of Medicine (NLM).6 In consulta-

relatively precise information without being over-

At this stage, workers were presented with ab-

Crowd model). This two-step approach served
dual purposes: (i) increasing the rate at which
workers could complete tasks, and (ii) improving
recall by directing workers to all areas in abstracts
where they might find the structured information
of interest. Our choice of a high recall aggrega-
tion strategy for the starting spans ensured that the
large majority of relevant sections of the article
were available as inputs to this task.

The three trained medical personnel hired via
Upwork each annotated 200 documents and re-
ported that spans sufficiently captured the tar-
get information. These domain experts received
feedback and additional training after labeling an
initial round of documents, and all annotations
were reviewed for compliance. The average inter-

With respect to crowdsourcing on AMT, the
task for Participants was published first, allowing
us to target higher quality workers for the more
technical Interventions and Outcomes annotations.
We retained labels from 118 workers for Partici-
pants, the top 67 of whom were invited to continue
on to the following tasks. Of these, 37 continued
to contribute to the project. Several workers pro-
vided ≥ 1,000 annotations and continued to work
on the task over a period of several months.

To produce final per-token labels, we again
turned to aggregation. The subspans annotated
in this second pass were by construction shorter
than the starting spans, and (perhaps as a result)
informal experiments revealed little benefit from
HMMCrowd’s sequential modeling aspect. The
introduction of many label types significantly in-
creased the complexity of the task, resulting in
both lower expert inter-annotator agreement (Ta-
ble 6 and decreased performance when comparing
the crowdsourced labels against those of the ex-
perts (Table 7.

Most observed token-level disagreements (and
errors, with respect to reference annotations) in-
volve differences in the span lengths demarcated
by individuals. For example, many abstracts con-
tain an information-dense description of the pa-
tient population, focusing on their medical con-
dition but also including information about their
sex and/or age. Workers would also sometimes fail

to capture repeated mentions of the same informa-
tion, producing Type 2 errors more frequently than
Type 1. This tendency can be seen in the overall
token-level confusion matrix for AMT workers on
the Participants task, shown in Figure 3.

In a similar though more benign category of er-
ror, workers differed in the amount of context they
included surrounding each subspan. Although the
instructions asked workers to highlight minimal
subspans, there was variance in what workers con-
sidered relevant.

evaluated against the aggregated versions, macro-
averaged over different labels.

For the same reasons mentioned above (lit-
tle pairwise overlap in annotations, high variance
with respect to annotations per worker), quantify-
ing agreement between AMT workers is again dif-
ficult using traditional measures. We thus again
take as a measure of agreement the precision, re-
call, and F-1 of the individual annotations against
the aggregated labels and present the results in Ta-
ble 8.

4.3 Repetition

Medical abstracts often mention the same infor-
mation in multiple places. In particular, interven-
tions and outcomes are typically described at the
beginning of an abstract when introducing the pur-
pose of the underlying study, and then again when
discussing methods and results. It is important to

be able to differentiate between novel and reiter-
ated information, especially in cases such as com-
plex interventions, distinct measured outcomes, or
multi-armed trials. Merely identifying all occur-
rences of, for example, a pharmacological inter-
vention leaves ambiguity as to how many distinct
interventions were applied.

Workers identified repeated information as fol-
lows. After completing detailed labeling of ab-
stract spans, they were asked to group together
subspans that were instances of the same informa-
tion (for example, redundant mentions of a partic-
ular drug evaluated as one of the interventions in
the trial). This process produces labels for repeti-
tion between short spans of tokens. Due to the dif-
ferences in the lengths of annotated subspans dis-
cussed in the preceding section, the labels are not
naturally comparable between workers without di-
rectly modeling the entities contained in each sub-
span. The labels assigned by workers produce rep-
etition labels between sets of tokens but a more
sophisticated notion of co-reference is required to
identify which tokens correctly represent the en-
tity contained in the span, and which tokens are
superfluous noise.

As a proxy for formally enumerating these en-
tities, we observe that a large majority of start-

for span-level repetition labels.

ing spans only contain a single target relevant
to the subspan labeling task, and so identifying
repetition between the starting spans is sufficient.
For example, consider the starting intervention
span ”underwent conventional total knee arthro-
plasty”; there is only one intervention in the span
but some annotators assigned the SURGICAL label
to all five tokens while others opted for only ”total
knee arthroplasty.” By analyzing repetition at the
level of the starting spans, we can compute agree-
ment without concern for the confounds of slight
misalignments or differences in length of the sub-
spans.

Overall agreement between AMT workers for
span-level repetition, measured by computing pre-
cision and recall against the majority vote for each
pair of spans, is reported in Table 10.

4.4 MeSH Terms

The National Library of Medicine maintains an
extensive hierarchical ontology of medical con-
cepts called Medical Subject Headings (MeSH
terms); this is part of the overarching Metathe-
saurus of the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). Personnel at the NLM manually assign
citations (article titles, abstracts and meta-data) in-
dexed in MEDLINE relevant MeSH terms. These
terms have been used extensively to evaluate the
content of articles, and are frequently used to fa-
cilitate document retrieval (Lu et al., 2009; Lowe
and Barnett, 1994).

In the case of randomized controlled trials,
MeSH terms provide structured information re-
garding key aspects of the underlying studies,
ranging from participant demographics to method-
ologies to co-morbidities. A drawback to these an-
notations, however, is that they are applied at the
document (rather than snippet or token) level. To
capture where MeSH terms are instantiated within
a given abstract text, we provided a list of all terms
associated with said article and instructed workers
to select the subset of these that applied to each set
of token labels that they annotated.

MeSH terms are domain specific and many re-

quire a medical background to understand, thus
rendering this facet of the annotation process par-
ticularly difficult for untrained (lay) workers. Per-
haps surprisingly, several AMT workers voluntar-
ily mentioned relevant background training; our
pool of workers included (self-identified) nurses
and other trained medical professionals. A few
workers with such training stated this background
as a reason for their interest in our tasks.

The technical specificity of the more obscure
MeSH terms is also exacerbated by their sparsity.
Of the 6,963 unique MeSH terms occurring in our
set of abstracts, 87% of them are only found in
10 documents or fewer and only 2.0% occur in at
least 1% of the total documents. The full distri-
bution of document frequency for MeSH terms is
show in Figure 4.

To evaluate how often salient MeSH terms were
instantiated in the text by annotators we consider
only the 135 MeSH terms that occur in at least
1% of abstracts (we list these in the supplementary
material). For each term, we calculate its ”instan-
tiation frequency” as the percentage of abstracts
containing the term in which at least one annotator
assigned it to a span of text. The total numbers of
MeSH terms with an instantiation rate above dif-
ferent thresholds for the respective PIO elements
are shown in Table 11.

5 Tasks & Baselines

We outline a few NLP tasks that are central to the
aim of processing medical literature generally and

to aiding practitioners of EBM specifically. First,
we consider the task of identifying spans in ab-
stracts that describe the respective PICO elements
(Section 5.1). This would, e.g., improve medical
literature search and retrieval systems. Next, we
outline the problem of extracting structured infor-
mation from abstracts (Section 5.2). Such mod-
els would further aid search, and might eventually
facilitate automated knowledge-base construction
for the clinical trials literature. Furthermore, au-
tomatic extraction of structured data would enable
automation of the manual evidence synthesis pro-
cess (Marshall et al., 2017).

Finally, we consider the challenging task of
identifying redundant mentions of the same PICO
element (Section 5.3). This happens, e.g., when
an intervention is mentioned by the authors re-
peatedly in an abstract, potentially with different
terms. Achieving such disambiguation is impor-
tant for systems aiming to induce structured repre-
sentations of trials and their results, as this would
require recognizing and normalizing the unique
interventions and outcomes studied in a trial.

For each of these tasks we present baseline
models and corresponding results. Note that we
have pre-defined train, development and test sets
across PIO elements for this corpus, comprising
4300, 500 and 200 abstracts, respectively. The lat-
ter set is annotated by domain experts (i.e., per-
sons with medical training). These splits will, of
course, be distributed along with the dataset to fa-
cilitate model comparisons.

5.1 Identifying P, I and O Spans

We consider two baseline models: a linear Condi-
tional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001)
and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neu-
ral tagging model, an LSTM-CRF (Lample et al.,
2016; Ma and Hovy, 2016). In both models, we
treat tokens as being either Inside (I) or Outside
(O) of spans.

For the CRF, features include: indicators for the
current, previous and next words; part of speech
tags inferred using the Stanford CoreNLP tagger
(Manning et al., 2014); and character information,
e.g., whether a token contains digits, uppercase
letters, symbols and so on.

For the neural model, the model induces fea-
tures via a bi-directional LSTM that consumes dis-
tributed vector representations of input tokens se-
quentially. The bi-LSTM yields a hidden vector at

each token index, which is then passed to a CRF
layer for prediction. We also exploit character-
level information by passing a bi-LSTM over the
characters comprising each word (Lample et al.,
2016); these are appended to the word embedding
representations before being passed through the
bi-LSTM.

5.2 Extracting Structured Information

Beyond identifying the spans of text containing in-
formation pertinent to each of the PIO elements,
we consider the task of predicting which of the
detailed labels occur in each span, and where they
are located. Specifically, we begin with the start-
ing spans and predict a single label from the cor-
responding PIO hierarchy for each token, evaluat-
ing against the test set of 200 documents. Initial
experiments with neural models proved unfruitful
but bear further investigation.

For the CRF model we include the same fea-
tures as in the previous model, supplemented with
additional features encoding if the adjacent tokens
include any parenthesis or mathematical operators
(specifically: %,+,−). For the logistic regression
model, we use a one-vs-rest approach. Features
include token n-grams, part of speech indicators,
and the same character-level information as in the
CRF model.

5.3 Detecting Repetition

To formalize repetition, we consider every pair of
starting PIO spans from each abstract, and assign

binary labels that indicate whether they share at
least one instance of the same information. Al-
though this makes prediction easier for long and
information-dense spans, a large enough majority
of the spans contain only a single instance of rel-
evant information that the task serves as a reason-
able baseline. Again, the model is trained on the
aggregated labels collected from AMT and evalu-
ated against the high-quality test set.

We train a logistic regression model that op-
erates over standard features, including bag-of-
words representations and sentence-level features
such as length and position in the document. All
baseline model implementations are available on
the corpus website.

6 Conclusions

We have presented EBM-NLP: a new, publicly
available corpus comprising 5,000 richly anno-
tated abstracts of articles describing clinical ran-
domized controlled trials. This dataset fills a need
for larger scale corpora to facilitate research on
NLP methods for processing the biomedical liter-
ature, which have the potential to aid the conduct
of EBM. The need for such technologies will only
become more pressing as the literature continues
its torrential growth.

The EBM-NLP corpus, accompanying docu-
mentation, code for working with the data, and
baseline models presented in this work are all
publicly available at: http://www.ccs.neu.
edu/home/bennye/EBM-NLP.
