Abstract

Current work on multimodal machine trans-
lation (MMT) has suggested that the vi-
sual modality is either unnecessary or only
marginally beneficial. We posit that this is
a consequence of the very simple, short and
repetitive sentences used in the only available
dataset for the task (Multi30K), rendering the
source text sufficient as context. In the general
case, however, we believe that it is possible to
combine visual and textual information in or-
der to ground translations. In this paper we
probe the contribution of the visual modality
to state-of-the-art MMT models by conducting
a systematic analysis where we partially de-
prive the models from source-side textual con-
text. Our results show that under limited tex-
tual context, models are capable of leveraging
the visual input to generate better translations.
This contradicts the current belief that MMT
models disregard the visual modality because
of either the quality of the image features or
the way they are integrated into the model.

1 Introduction

Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) aims
at designing better translation systems which
take into account auxiliary inputs such as im-
ages. Initially organized as a shared task within
the First Conference on Machine Translation
(WMT16) (Specia et al., 2016), MMT has so far
been studied using the Multi30K dataset (Elliott
et al., 2016), a multilingual extension of Flickr30K
(Young et al., 2014) with translations of the En-
glish image descriptions into German, French and
Czech (Elliott et al., 2017; Barrault et al., 2018).

The three editions of the shared task have seen
many exciting approaches that can be broadly cat-
egorized as follows: (i) multimodal attention us-
ing convolutional features (Caglayan et al., 2016;
Calixto et al., 2016; Libovický and Helcl, 2017;
Helcl et al., 2018) (ii) cross-modal interactions

with spatially-unaware global features (Calixto
and Liu, 2017; Ma et al., 2017; Caglayan et al.,
2017a; Madhyastha et al., 2017) and (iii) the in-
tegration of regional features from object detec-
tion networks (Huang et al., 2016; Grönroos et al.,
2018). Nevertheless, the conclusion about the con-
tribution of the visual modality is still unclear:
Grönroos et al. (2018) consider their multimodal
gains “modest” and attribute the largest gain to
the usage of external parallel corpora. Lala et al.
(2018) observe that their multimodal word-sense
disambiguation approach is not significantly dif-
ferent than the monomodal counterpart. The orga-
nizers of the latest edition of the shared task con-
cluded that the multimodal integration schemes
explored so far resulted in marginal changes in
terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation
(Barrault et al., 2018). In a similar vein, Elliott
(2018) demonstrated that MMT models can trans-
late without significant performance losses even in
the presence of features from unrelated images.

These empirical findings seem to indicate that
images are ignored by the models and hint at the
fact that this is due to representation or modeling
limitations. We conjecture that the most plausi-
ble reason for the linguistic dominance is that – at
least in Multi30K – the source text is sufficient to
perform the translation, eventually preventing the
visual information from intervening in the learn-
ing process. To investigate this hypothesis, we
introduce several input degradation regimes (Sec-
tion 2) and revisit state-of-the-art MMT models
(Section 3) to assess their behavior under degraded
regimes. We further probe the visual sensitivity by
deliberately feeding features from unrelated im-
ages. Our results (Section 4) show that MMT
models successfully exploit the visual modality
when the linguistic context is scarce, but indeed
tend to be less sensitive to this modality when ex-
posed to complete sentences.

2 Input Degradation

In this section we propose several degradations
to the input language modality to simulate condi-
tions where sentences may miss crucial informa-
tion. We denote a set of translation pairs by D and
indicate degraded variants with subscripts. Both
the training and the test sets are degraded.

Color Deprivation. We consistently replace
source words that refer to colors with a special to-
ken [v] (DC in Table 1). Our hypothesis is that a
monomodal system will have to rely on source-
side contextual information and biases, while a
multimodal architecture could potentially capital-
ize on color information extracted by exploiting
the image and thus obtain better performance.
This affects 3.3% and 3.1% of the words in the
training and the test set, respectively.

Entity Masking. The Flickr30K dataset, from
which Multi30K is derived, has also been ex-
tended with coreference chains to tag mentions of
visually depictable entities in image descriptions
(Plummer et al., 2015). We use these to mask out
the head nouns in the source sentences (DN in Ta-
ble 1). This affects 26.2% of the words in both
the training and the test set. We hypothesize that a
multimodal system should heavily rely on the im-
ages to infer the missing parts.

Progressive Masking. A progressively de-
graded variant Dk replaces all but the first k
tokens of source sentences with [v] . Unlike
the color deprivation and entity masking, mask-
ing out suffixes does not guarantee systematic
removal of visual context, but rather simulates
an increasingly low-resource scenario. Overall,
we form 16 degraded variants Dk (Table 1)
where k ∈ {0, 2, . . . , 30}. We stop at D30 since
99.8% of the sentences in Multi30K are shorter
than 30 words with an average sentence length
of 12 words. D0 – where the only remaining
information is the source sentence length – is an
interesting case from two perspectives: a neural
machine translation (NMT) model trained on
it resembles a target language model, while an
MMT model becomes an image captioner with
access to “expected length information”.

Visual Sensitivity. Inspired by Elliott (2018),
we experiment with incongruent decoding in order
to understand how sensitive the multimodal sys-
tems are to the visual modality. This is achieved

D a lady in a blue dress singing

DC a lady in a [v] dress singing
DN a [v] in a blue [v] singing

D4 a lady in a [v] [v] [v]
D2 a lady [v] [v] [v] [v] [v]
D0 [v] [v] [v] [v] [v] [v] [v]

Table 1: An example of the proposed input degradation
schemes: D is the original sentence.

by explicitly violating the test-time semantic con-
gruence across modalities. Specifically, we feed
the visual features in reverse sample order to
break image-sentence alignments. Consequently,
a model capable of integrating the visual modality
would likely deteriorate in terms of metrics.

3 Experimental Setup

Dataset. We conduct experiments on the
English→French part of Multi30K. The models
are trained on the concatenation of the train and
val sets (30K sentences) whereas test2016 (dev)
and test2017 (test) are used for early-stopping
and model evaluation, respectively. For entity
masking, we revert to the default Flickr30K splits
and perform the model evaluation on test2016,
since test2017 is not annotated for entities. We
use word-level vocabularies of 9,951 English and
11,216 French words. We use Moses (Koehn
et al., 2007) scripts to lowercase, normalize and
tokenize the sentences with hyphen splitting. The
hyphens are stitched back prior to evaluation.

Visual Features. We use a ResNet-50 CNN (He
et al., 2016) trained on ImageNet (Deng et al.,
2009) as image encoder. Prior to feature extrac-
tion, we center and standardize the images using
ImageNet statistics, resize the shortest edge to 256
pixels and take a center crop of size 256x256. We
extract spatial features of size 2048x8x8 from the
final convolutional layer and apply L2 normaliza-
tion along the depth dimension (Caglayan et al.,
2018). For the non-attentive model, we use the
2048-dimensional global average pooled version
(pool5) of the above convolutional features.

Models. Our baseline NMT is an attentive
model (Bahdanau et al., 2014) with a 2-layer bidi-
rectional GRU encoder (Cho et al., 2014) and a
2-layer conditional GRU decoder (Sennrich et al.,
2017). The second layer of the decoder receives
the output of the attention layer as input.

Table 2: Baseline and color-deprivation METEOR
scores: bold systems are significantly different from the
NMT system within the same column (p-value≤ 0.03).

For the MMT model, we explore the basic
multimodal attention (DIRECT) (Caglayan et al.,
2016) and its hierarchical (HIER) extension (Li-
bovický and Helcl, 2017). The former linearly
projects the concatenation of textual and visual
context vectors to obtain the multimodal context
vector, while the latter replaces the concatena-
tion with another attention layer. Finally, we
also experiment with encoder-decoder initializa-
tion (INIT) (Calixto and Liu, 2017; Caglayan
et al., 2017a) where we initialize both the encoder
and the decoder using a non-linear transformation
of the pool5 features.

Hyperparameters. The encoder and decoder
GRUs have 400 hidden units and are initialized
with 0 except the multimodal INIT system. All
embeddings are 200-dimensional and the decoder
embeddings are tied (Press and Wolf, 2016). A
dropout of 0.4 and 0.5 is applied on source embed-
dings and encoder/decoder outputs, respectively
(Srivastava et al., 2014). The weights are decayed
with a factor of 1e−5. We use ADAM (Kingma
and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 4e−4 and
mini-batches of 64 samples. The gradients are
clipped if the total norm exceeds 1 (Pascanu et al.,
2013). The training is early-stopped if dev set ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) does not im-
prove for ten epochs. All experiments are con-
ducted with nmtpytorch1 (Caglayan et al., 2017b).

4 Results

We train all systems three times each with dif-
ferent random initialization in order to perform
significance testing with multeval (Clark et al.,
2011). Throughout the section, we always report
the mean over three runs (and the standard devi-
ation) of the considered metrics. We decode the
translations with a beam size of 12.

Figure 1: Entity masking: all masked MMT models are
significantly better than the masked NMT (dashed). In-
congruent decoding severely worsens all systems. The
vanilla NMT baseline is 75.92.

We first present test2017 METEOR scores for
the baseline NMT and MMT systems, when
trained on the full dataset D (Table 2). The first
column indicates that, although MMT models per-
form slightly better on average, they are not sig-
nificantly better than the baseline NMT. We now
introduce and discuss the results obtained under
the proposed degradation schemes. Please refer to
Table 5 and the appendix for qualitative examples.

4.1 Color Deprivation

Unlike the inconclusive results for D, we observe
that all MMT models are significantly better than
NMT when color deprivation is applied (DC in Ta-
ble 2). If we further focus on the subset of the
test set subjected to color deprivation (247 sen-
tences), the gain increases to 1.6 METEOR for
HIER. For the latter subset, we also computed the
average color accuracy per sentence and found that
the attentive models are 12% better than the NMT
(32.5→44.5) whereas the INIT model only brings
4% (32.5→36.5) improvement. This shows that
more complex MMT models are better at integrat-
ing visual information to perform better.

4.2 Entity Masking

The gains are much more prominent with entity
masking, where the degradation occurs at a larger
scale: Attentive MMT models show up to 4.2 ME-
TEOR improvement over NMT (Figure 1). We ob-
served a large performance drop with incongruent
decoding, suggesting that the visual modality is

2Since entity masking uses Flickr30K splits (Section 3)
rather than our splits, the scores are not comparable to those
from other experiments in this paper.

now much more important than previously demon-
strated (Elliott, 2018). A comparison of attention
maps produced by the baseline and masked MMT
models reveals that the attention weights are more
consistent in the latter. An interesting example is
given in Figure 2 where the masked MMT model
attends to the correct region of the image and suc-
cessfully translates a dropped word that was oth-
erwise a spelling mistake (“son”→“song”).

Czech and German. In order to understand
whether the above observations are also consis-
tent across different languages, we extend the en-
tity masking experiments to German and Czech
parts of Multi30K. Table 3 shows the gain of each
MMT system with respect to the NMT model and
the subsequent drop caused by incongruent decod-
ing3. First, we see that the multimodal benefits
clearly hold for German and Czech, although the
gains are lower than for French4. Second, when
we compute the average drop from using incon-
gruent images across all languages, we see how
conservative the INIT system is (↓ 4.7) compared

3For example, the INIT system for French (Figure 1) sur-
passes the baseline (50.5) by reaching 53.9 (+3.4), which
ends up at 47.4 (↓ 6.5) after incongruent decoding.

4This is probably due to the morphological richness of DE
and CS which is suboptimally handled by word-level MT.

to HIER (↓ 6.1) and DIRECT (↓ 6.8). This raises a
follow-up question as to whether the hidden state
initialization eventually loses its impact through-
out the recurrence where, as a consequence, the
only modality processed is the text.

4.3 Progressive Masking
Finally, we discuss the results of the progressive
masking experiments for French. Figure 3 clearly
shows that as the sentences are progressively de-
graded, all MMT systems are able to leverage the
visual modality. When the multimodal task be-
comes image captioning at k=0, MMT models
improve over the language-model counterpart by
∼7 METEOR. Further qualitative examples show
that the systems perform surprisingly well by pro-
ducing visually plausible sentences (see Table 5
and the Appendix).

To get a sense of the visual sensitivity, we pick
the DIRECT models trained on four degraded vari-
ants and perform incongruent decoding. We no-
tice that as the amount of linguistic information
increases, the gap narrows down: the MMT sys-
tem gradually becomes less perplexed by the in-
congruence or, put in other words, less sensitive to
the visual modality (Table 4).

derlined and bold words highlight the bad and good lexical choices. MMT is an attentive system.

We then conduct a contrastive “blinding” exper-
iment where the DIRECT models are not only
fed with incongruent features at decoding time but
also trained with them from scratch. The results
suggest that the blinded models learn to ignore
the visual modality. In fact, their performance is
equivalent to NMT models.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

We presented an in-depth study on the potential
contribution of images for multimodal machine
translation. Specifically, we analysed the behav-
ior of state-of-the-art MMT models under several
degradation schemes in the Multi30K dataset, in
order to reveal and understand the impact of tex-
tual predominance. Our results show that the mod-
els explored are able to integrate the visual modal-
ity if the available modalities are complementary
rather than redundant. In the latter case, the pri-
mary modality (text) sufficient to accomplish the
task. This dominance effect corroborates the sem-
inal work of Colavita (1974) in Psychophysics
where it has been demonstrated that visual stimuli
dominate over the auditory stimuli when humans
are asked to perform a simple audiovisual discrim-
ination task. Our investigation using source degra-
dation also suggests that visual grounding can in-
crease the robustness of machine translation sys-
tems by mitigating input noise such as errors in

the source text. In the future, we would like to
devise models that can learn when and how to in-
tegrate multiple modalities by taking care of the
complementary and redundant aspects of them in
an intelligent way.

A Qualitative Examples

In this appendix, we provide further translation
examples for color deprivation (Table 6), entity
masking (Table 7) and progressive masking (Ta-
ble 8). Specifically for the entity masking experi-
ments, we also give further examples to showcase
the behavior of the visual attention in Figure 4 and
Figure 5.
