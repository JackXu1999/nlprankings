Abstract

We present a free web-based CAT tool called CATaLog Online which provides a novel and user-
friendly online CAT environment for post-editors/translators. The goal is to support distributed
translation where teams of translators work simultaneously on different sections of the same text,
reduce post-editing time and effort, improve the post-editing experience and capture data for in-
cremental MT/APE (automatic post-editing) and translation process research. The tool supports
individual as well as batch mode file translation and provides translations from three engines –
translation memory (TM), MT and APE. TM suggestions are color coded to accelerate the post-
editing task. The users can integrate their personal TM/MT outputs. The tool remotely monitors
and records post-editing activities generating an extensive range of post-editing logs. Compared
with current state-of-the-art CAT tools, CATaLog Online provides an enhanced interface, an op-
tion to integrate APE and more informative logs to help translation process research.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) technology has improved substantially over the past few decades. MT output
is no longer used just for gisting but also for post-editing by professional translators as an important part
of the translation workflow. Several studies confirm that post-editing MT output increases translators’
productivity and improves translation consistency (Guerberof, 2009; Plitt and Masselot, 2010; Zampieri
and Vela, 2014). Alongside classical TM matches, computer-aided translation (CAT) Tools that integrate
MT and TM output are a trend in the translation and localization industries providing translators more
useful suggestions. Another important trend is the development of web-based CAT tools which require
no local software installation and allow teams of translators to work on the same project simultaneously
(e.g., WordFast Anywhere1, MateCat2 (Federico et al., 2014), and Wordbee3, Lilt4 etc.).

This paper presents CATaLog Online, a web-based CAT tool that provides translators MT, TM and
APE output and ensures data capture for APE development and translation process research. The MT
and APE systems integrated in CATaLog Online are based on Pal et al. (2015) and Pal et al. (2016b),
respectively. In this paper, we present the key features implemented in CATaLog Online and their impor-
tance to translation project managers, translators, and MT and APE developers. Compared to state-of-
the-art CAT tools (e.g., MateCat, Lilt) CATaLog Online offers the following advantages: (i) color coded
TM translation suggestions (highlighted TM source and corresponding target fragments are shown in the
same interface), (ii) a wide range of editing logs, (iii) alignment between source, TM/MT/APE and the
results of human PE, (iv) improved TM similarity measure and search technique (Pal et al., 2016a), and
(v) additional translation option from APE which learns from human post-edited data.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the desktop version of the CATaLog tool. Section
3 describes in detail the main functionalities of CATaLog Online. Section 4 outlines APE and translation

process research with CATaLog Online. Section 5 concludes and provides avenues for improving the
CAT tool further.

2 CATaLog

CATaLog (Nayek et al., 2015) is a TM-based CAT tool which provides core functionalities for CATaLog
Online. What distinguishes CATaLog from existing TM-based CAT tools is a set of newly introduced
features targeted towards improving post-editing experience in terms of both performance and produc-
tivity. These include an improved TM similarity measure, searching and a novel coloring scheme. The
color coding introduced into CATaLog guides the user during the translation (or post-editing) process.
The matching parts in the TM source matches, as well as their translations in the target, are displayed in
green, while the non-matching parts in both the TM source and target suggestions are displayed in red.
Unaligned words are shown in orange. Similarly, when the user clicks on one of the 5 TM suggestions to
start the post-editing task, the corresponding matching and non-matching parts in the input segment are
also displayed in green and red, respectively. The color coding scheme not only helps the user to choose
the most suitable TM suggestion for post-editing, it also helps the user to identify which parts of a TM
match require more post-editing effort and which fragments are reliable translations.

3 CATaLog Online

CATaLog Online provides a novel and user-friendly online CAT environment for post-editors and trans-
lators to reduce post-editing time and effort and improve the post-editing experience. The basic TM
fuctionalities in CATaLog Online follow CATaLog’s color coding scheme. CATaLog Online is a freeware
software that can be used through a web browser (works best in Mozilla Firefox) and requires only a
simple registration. The tool remotely monitors and records translator/post-editor activities generating
a wide range of post-editing logs (cf. Section 3.5) that are a fundamental source of information for
APE and translation process research. CATaLog Online, produces multiple translation options for an up-
loaded input text file. It is a language independent tool that enables users to upload their own translation
memories.

On the main user interface5, users can translate a single segment after choosing the source language
and the target language (cf. “Quick Translation” in the main interface ). The suggested translations
are generated by three different engines: MT, TM and APE. The TM output is color coded. Unlike
other existing CAT tools, CATaLog Online provides many facilities including file translation, CAT tool
environment, user management, project management, translation data capture, TM/MT and APE support,
as well as distributed translation, where teams of translators working on the same job, etc.

3.1 File Translation

CATaLog Online provides facilities for batch mode file translation6, i.e., a user can input a source file. The
CATaLog Online batch mode file translation option provides a post-editing environment which allows
the user to post-edit the selected translation from among the three translation suggestions (MT, TM and
APE). The user has to choose the source–target language pair and upload a text file which contains a set
of source segments. The tool translates this text file at the back end by creating a project and then assigns
a unique job identification number (Job ID) to the user which is displayed on the large red button in the
interface (cf. Figure 3). Each project/job is associated with a unique job URL. The user can either keep
this Job ID for future reference or directly go to the job page by clicking on the recent Job ID (i.e., the
red button marked with the Job ID). To recover a project/job, the translator has to search the project/job
using the corresponding Job ID (cf. Figure 3). The File translation interface provides on-the-fly user
guidance regarding the “usage” and “tool functionality” in terms of message services.

3.2 CAT Tool

The CAT Tool interface7 is similar to the File Translation interface described in Section 3.1, however, it
differs in terms of features and functionalities. Users can upload their own translation memories as tab
separated text files. The tool is language agnostic and allows the user to upload files in any language.
Users have full freedom to use MT translations generated by their own MT systems or third party MT
engines (up to two alternatives are supported in the current version. Additionally, the tool provides color
coded translations from the back end TM. When uploading finishes, the system provides a unique Job
ID; the functionality is similar to that described in Section 3.1.

3.3 Project Management and Distributed Translation

The CATaLog Online project management system supports basic project management activities. A regis-
tered Project manager (PM) creates a translation project for a specific language pair by uploading a source
file. Once a project/Job has been created, a Job Id appears in a row of the job assignment table. Additional
information is associated with the Job Id, including issue date, submission date, available translators for
that particular language pair, etc. The PM can review the job and assign translation sub-jobs to any of
the available translators supporting concurrent distributed translation management including submission
deadlines (cf. Figure 2).

As soon as the PM assigns a sub-job to a particular registered translator, the translator can see and
review that job. The interface provides three options to the translator by which the translator can set
the status of his/her activity for that particular job. A translator can either delete the assigned job from
his/her profile by setting a “Deny” status or can accept it by setting the “Accept” status (cf. Figure 4).
After finishing a translation task, the translator sets the corresponding job status as “Completed” which
is directly updated in the PM’s job status where the PM can see the completed and pending jobs. Finally,
after reviewing, the PM can download the completed job and deliver it to the client.

3.4 Job Management

A job is created when the PM or a guest user uploads a source file. The job interface provides three
different translation alternatives for each source segment (cf. Figure 5).The TM translation alternative
is color coded. The other two outputs are from MT and APE engines provided by CATaLog Online (cf.
Section 3.1) or the uploaded third party MT engine outputs (cf. Section 3.2). As shown in Figure 5,
source segments are listed in the blue panel on the left and the corresponding translation suggestions
appear on the right panel upon clicking a link shown above the source segment. The translator chooses
one of these suggestions and post-edits it. Figure 6 shows the interface when the translator selects the
TM suggestion. The final translation appears in the green panel on the left when the translator presses
the “Save” button. The editing time (in seconds) is also shown below the final translation panel. After
finishing each translation, an editing summary shows the number of editing operations performed by the
translator. CATaLog Online provides an on-the-fly editing guide throughout the translation process. In
case of re-editing a translation, the previously stored final translation is shown as the first translation
suggestion in the suggestion panel.

3.5 Editing Log

For a given input segment, the post-editor edits the best translation suggestion which may contain errors.
The system records the user activities such as key strokes, cursor positions, text selection and mouse
clicks. The tool provides analytical summaries of post-editing activities during translation and presents
well structured XML formatted logs which can be customized according to the user’s choice, e.g., the
user can download the entire logs or some specific logs for a particular translation job (cf. Figure 1). The
tool also provides word alignment which is also a part of the XML logs. CATaLog Online records word
alignments between source–MT, MT–APE and source–HPE (human PE). The source–MT and MT–APE
word alignments are established based on the decoding traces. The MT–HPE and APE–HPE alignments
are recorded from the keystroke logs based on whether the user edits the MT output or APE output.
Finally, the source–HPE alignments are generated by combining the transitive links between source–MT,
MT–APE and APE–HPE in case of editing on the APE output or as the combination of source–MT and
MT–HPE. These alignments and post-editing information are beneficial for translation process research.

4 APE and Translation Process Research using CATaLog Online

The post-editing logs collected during the translation process are a valuable source of information for
translation process research as well as APE research and development. These user activity data logs not
only help to assess the performance and understand the behavior of the translators, they also provide
crucial information about cognitive aspects of post-editing. The logs can be used to model APE to
improve quality and productivity.

User Perspective: CATaLog Online generates a summary for every completed translation task which

101



includes translator productivity in terms of number of words translated per minute and time taken per
word. From the logs it is also possible to generate a report on translator style and behavior which can
include, e.g., number of keystrokes per (effective) character editing, repetitive typing, preference for
certain function words, etc.

Research Perspective: CATaLog Online records word alignments between source–MT, MT–APE,
source–APE and source–HPE. These alignments and related post-editing information are beneficial for
incremental MT/APE. Moreover, the source–HPE word alignments gathered by the tool can serve as a
potential source for terminology extraction.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

CATaLog Online is a novel and user-friendly online CAT tool offering new features developed with the
objective of improving translation productivity and experience. The tool provides a wide range of logs
and data which serve as important information to translation process researchers, MT developers, and
APE developers. The success of the two editions of the APE shared task in WMT (Bojar et al., 2016)
indicate that APE is one of the important directions that research in MT is moving to. Post-editing
tools, such as CATaLog Online, are able to provide crucial information for APE development. We would
like to further expand and improve the tool by including additional features, e.g., interactive translation
prediction in the form of on-the-fly translation suggestion, terminology extraction, option for compiling
corpora, auto-suggestion for words, on-click pop-up terminology view, etc. Finally, we would like to
model user behaviour and implement incremental MT/APE using the edit logs provided by the tool.
