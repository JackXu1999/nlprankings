Abstract

This paper identifies features that occur frequently in coherence relations labelled CHOSEN AL-
TERNATIVE. This achieves two goals: (1) to identify evidence for an argument being considered
an alternative excluded from further consideration, and (2) to contribute to the automatic identifi-
cation of coherence relations and their arguments. It is shown that the simplest of these features
occur significantly more often in implicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE relations than in explicit CHOSEN
ALTERNATIVE relations, where a connective helps signal this sense.

1 Introduction

There have been two main approaches to identifying what coherence relations can hold between the
segments in a discourse. Knott (1996) calls one theoretical, grounded in a philosophical view of lan-
guage, and the other empirical, grounded in the discourse connectives that can be taken as explicit ex-
pressions of coherence relations. Knott’s own approach starts with the first, characterizing patterns of
meaning-preserving substitutability between connectives — whether two connectives are freely substi-
tutable wherever they occur as connectives (hence synonyms), contingently substitutable (one a hyponym
of the other), or non-substitutable (hence exclusive). He then explains these patterns in terms of connec-
tives being more or less specific with respect to one or more theoretically-motivated features and their
(exclusive) values. In later work, Knott and Sanders (1998) show how the approach works for subsets of
connectives in both English and Dutch. It does not, however, explain how the same coherence relations
may be seen to hold when connectives are absent.

Automated approaches to recognizing coherence relations do not assume that their sense arises solely
from connectives. Rather, these approaches take as evidence, lexical and syntactic features of the argu-
ments of the coherence relation, nearby coherence relations, high-level text structure, etc. (Feng and
Hirst, 2012; Ghosh et al., 2011; Hernault et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010; Lin, 2012; Marcu, 2000; Marcu
and Echihabi, 2002; Sagae, 2009; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Subba et al., 2006). As one might
expect, automated approaches use simple features that can be computed reliably. However, performance
in recognizing coherence relations in the absense of connectives is still low, and significant improvement
is unlikely to come from simply trying new Machine Learning methods over the same set of simple fea-
tures. A bigger pay-off might come from identifying more predictive features. That is the goal of the
current work.

The particular coherence relation of interest here is one that holds when the discourse connective
instead is present, but can also hold when it isn’t. In the Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0 (Prasad et al.,
2008), the sense is called CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE. It is defined as holding when “two alternatives are
evoked in the discourse but only one is taken” — meaning still being considered while the other isn’t
(The PDTB Research Group, 2008).

Such a definition leads to two questions: What, if any, features suggest that the two arguments of
a coherence relation denote alternatives, and what, if any, features indicate that one of them has been
excluded from further consideration? As Sporleder and Lascarides (2008) argue, one should not assume
a priori that the same features will be at work when a connective is present and when it isn’t. However,



one satisfying outcome of the current effort is that when the most common features are present, an
explicit connective is often absent. When the evidence is more subtle, explicit connectives are more
often present.

The PDTB 2.0 provides a good basis for starting to address these questions because it contains over
40K manual annotations of coherence relations that are either signalled by explicit discourse connectives
or that hold between adjacent sentences that lack such an explicit signal (Prasad et al., 2008). Additional
evidence is taken from a corpus of >300 singly-annotated tokens of the discourse connective instead and
its arguments gathered over several years (the Instead Corpus).

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the connective instead and its place in earlier
approaches to coherence relations. It then presents the annotation of coherence relations in the PDTB 2.0.
Within this framework, instead is taken to be an unambiguous signal of the coherence relation CHOSEN
ALTERNATIVE, one of three types of ALTERNATIVE relations annotated in the PDTB 2.0. The section
concludes by laying out the scope of the current study with respect to CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, which is
to argue for what characterizes the argument that serves as its excluded alternative. Section 3 describes
several constructions that commonly appear there in explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE. Section 4 then
shows that three of them (negation markers, downward-entailing constructions, and event modals) are
even more frequent in the even larger percentage of implicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE. Finally, Section 5
lays out some open issues and some thoughts on further work that should be done.

2 Instead and CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE

2.1 Background

As noted in the Introduction, approaches to coherence relations differ in whether they start from an
abstract theory of what relations can hold between units of text, or from empirical data on the discourse
connectives that serve as explicit ways of expressing those relations.

Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) belongs to the first sort. In the first large
corpus annotated in the framework of RST — the RST Corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) — coherence
relations are annotated on the basis of definitions that do not link them with any particular discourse
connectives (Carlson and Marcu, 2001). Still, examining the corpus for those elementary discourse units
(EDUs) that begin “Instead, . . . ”, one finds eleven such EDUs: three in CONTRAST relations, four in
PREFERENCE and two in ANTITHESIS relations (both being types of COMPARISON relations), one in a
REASON relation and one in an ELABORATION relation. Given this, one can not associate the connective
instead with any particular coherence relation (or relations, if it is ambiguous) because there is no record
for why any of these relations has been taken to hold between EDUs other than their definitions.

Instead is one of the discourse connectives that Knott (1996) has analysed. He places it at a very
high level of his substitutability structure, taking it to be specified only for the feature polarity with value
negative. Polarity is defined in terms of a defeasible rule P→Q. Given two segments A and C connected
by a connective whose polarity is positive, A=P , C=Q and the defeasible rule is specified to succeed. If
the polarity of the connective is negative, A=P , C is inconsistent with Q, and the rule is specified to fail.
If a connective is unspecified for polarity, then neither case holds. But instead having negative polarity
does not provide any information about its arguments beyond the fact that the speaker must believe in
the existence of such a rule and that it fails for the given arguments.

While Martin (1992) also approaches coherence relations from theory (here, systemic-functional
grammar (Halliday and Hasan, 1976)), he illustrates each relation with one or more English connectives.
One can see from this that he takes instead to convey the COMPARATIVE relation he calls REPLACE-
MENT. In later work on families of coherence relations and connectives in English and German, Stede
(2012) similarly mentions both English instead and German anstatt, as both expressing the SUBSTITU-
TION relation, a sub-type of CONTRASTIVE RELATION. Both REPLACEMENT and SUBSTITUTION seem
intuitively to represent the same notion as CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE in the Penn Discourse TreeBank.



2.2 The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0

As noted in the Introduction, the Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0 (or PDTB 2.0) contains over 40K manual
annotations of coherence relations over the Penn Wall Street Journal Corpus, over 18K signalled by
explicit discourse connectives and over 16K holding between adjacent sentences that lack this explicit
signal (Prasad et al., 2008). In the latter case, readers are taken to infer an implicit discourse connective
relating the adjacent units, and their annotation includes an indication of the connective that best conveys
the inferred relation. The remaining annotation includes around 5K tokens of entity relations, where the
second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first, akin to entity-
based coherence (Knott et al., 2001), plus another 624 tokens in which the coherence relation is signalled
by some alternative lexicalization (such as “that means”) other than a conjunction or discourse adverbial
and another 254 in which no relation is inferred as holding between the adjacent sentences.

Annotated for each coherence relation are its arguments, the one or more sense relations taken to hold
between them, and any attribution relations taken to hold over either the relation as a whole or either of
its arguments.

All coherence relations have two and only two arguments. When a relation is realised with an explicit
connective or alternative lexicalization (ALTLEX), one of those arguments derives from the clause that is
syntactically bound to the connective. In the PDTB 2.0, this is called Arg2. The other argument, called
Arg1, may be linked syntactically to Arg2 if the connective is a subordinating conjunction or coordinating
conjunction (Ex. 1). Or it may be elsewhere in the sentence or previous discourse, if the connective is
a discourse adverbial (Ex. 2). If the coherence relation is realized through sentence adjacency and an
implicit connective, the second sentence is taken to provide Arg2 and the first sentence, Arg1.

(2) The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon’s final banquet toast, normally
an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship. Instead, Mr. Nixon reminded his
host, . . . , that Americans haven’t forgiven China’s leaders for the military assault of June 3-4
that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. [wsj 0093]

The senses used in annotation are drawn from a hierarchy of semantic classes whose top level consists
of four abstract classes: TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY, COMPARISON and EXPANSION. Each of these is
further divided into several types, which may themselves be further divided into sub-types (The PDTB
Research Group, 2008). Annotators could associate one or more senses with each explicit or implicit
connective or ALTLEX, with each sense at the level of sub-type or type, if the annotator couldn’t decide
among its sub-types.

In the PDTB 2.0, 108 of the 112 tokens of instead are annotated EXPANSION.ALTERNATIVE.CHOSEN
ALTERNATIVE (here, simply CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE). Its higher sense type ALTERNATIVE is taken to
hold “when the two arguments denote alternative situations” (The PDTB Research Group, 2008) and its
sister sub-types are CONJUNCTIVE (taken to hold when both alternatives are possible) and DISJUNCTIVE
(taken to hold when only one alternative needs to be possible). CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE itself is taken to
hold when “two alternatives are evoked in the discourse but only one is taken”.

Of the four tokens not annotated as CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, Ex. 3 is annotated ALTERNATIVE
rather than the more specific ALTERNATIVE.CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, though it is hard to imagine the
annotators being uncertain about which sub-type holds, Examples 4–5 have been annotated COMPARI-
SON.CONTRAST and Ex. 6, COMPARISON.CONTRAST.JUXTAPOSITION. The latter is defined in terms
of a comparison between a shared property having values taken to be alternatives. While there will be
more to say about CONTRAST versus CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE in Section 5, there is no reason not to
consider all four as instances of CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, if only for considering the set of features its
first argument dispays, which are no different than other instances of instead.

including mortgage-backed bonds. [wsj 0983]

contempt. Instead [COMPARISON.CONTRAST.JUXTAPOSITION], it turns on the disputed and
elusive facts of “who did what to whom”. [wsj 0946]

2.3 The Scope of the Current Study

The current study addresses the second question raised in Section 1: What, if any, features indicate that
one of the alternatives of a CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE relation has been excluded from further considera-
tion? This is of practical, as well as of theoretical interest because in English, the excluded alternative
derives from Arg1 of the relation.1 Because this argument is not syntactically linked to the connective, its
location and identity is more difficult for automated methods to determine (Webber et al., 2012). Also,
for implicit coherence relations, the same features that can be used to identify Arg1 of an explicit CHO-
SEN ALTERNATIVE may also be used to suggest that CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE holds in the absense of an
explicit connective.

3 Features manifest in CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE

For brevity, instances of CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE that have an explicit connective will simply be called
explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, while those that lack an explicit connective associated with this sense
will be called implicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE.

This analysis of features characteristic of the arguments of explicit and implicit CHOSEN ALTER-
NATIVE is based on 289 multiply-annotated tokens in the PDTB 2.0 (118 explicit and 171 implicit),
and seven multiply-annotated tokens in the BioDRB corpus (Prasad et al., 2011). The Instead Corpus
mentioned in Section 1 is used as a source of shorter, simpler examples.

Approximately 70% of the cases of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE in the PDTB and BioDRB man-
ifest features discussed in Sections 3.1–3.3 below. And ∼87% of the even larger number of implicit
CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE do the same (Section 4).

3.1 Negation markers

Of the 118 tokens of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, the largest subset have an explicit negation marker
associated with Arg1. Such a marker is sufficient to allow the sense that Arg1 is an alternative that is no
longer in consideration. Negation markers here include not (Ex. 8), no (Ex. 9), never (Ex. 10), and no
one.

(8) If the flex is worn, do not use insulating tape to repair it. Instead, you should replace it . . . .
1Paola Merlo has suggested [personal communication] that this doesn’t hold in all languages. She identifies the connective

invece as expressing CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE in Italian and the closest in meaning to English instead. While Invece allows
either alternative in Arg1 (Ex. 7), cases like (7b) do not occur in English.

(7) a. John non ha mangiato gli spinaci. Invece Maria si‘.
(John didn’t eat spinach. Instead Mary did.)

b. John ha mangiato gli spinaci. Invece Maria no.
(John ate spinach. *Instead Mary didn’t.)



(9) There are no separate rafters in a flat roof ; instead, the ceiling joists of the top story support
the roofing.

(10) Sue Grafton has never bowed to fad or fashion. Instead, she’s kept her whip-smart private
investigator, Kinsey Millhone, focused on modestly scaled domestic crimes . . . .

That the negation marker is critical to interpreting Arg1 as excluded from consideration, can be seen by
the infelicity of similar examples without the negation marker.

gator, Kinsey Millhone, . . . .

3.2 Downward Entailment

Since negation markers are downward entailing (DE), one might check whether all DE constructions can
exclude Arg1 of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE from consideration, or if not all, whether a larger set of
DE constructions than just negation markers can do so.

Constructions that are downward entailing (⇓) support valid reasoning from a set to a member. Ones
that are upward entailing (⇑) support valid reasoning in the opposite direction, from a member to a set.
Upward entailment means that one can reason from John owns a beagle to John owns a dog. Negation
markers, being downward entailing, support valid reasoning from John doesn’t own a dog to John doesn’t
own a beagle.

In the corpora analyzed in this study, the second largest set of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE re-
lations have a DE predicate associated with Arg1 that is other than a negation marker. Examples 14–15
below show two of them: reject (from John rejected dogs, conclude John rejected beagles) and too
<modifier> (from John was too ill to own a dog, conclude John was too ill to own a beagle).

(14) In India, he rejects the identification of Indianness with Hinduism, . . . . Instead he champions Mr
Tagore’s view . . . . [The Economist, 18 June 2005]

(15) The current system is too bureaucratic . . . . Instead, research councils should “pay the full costs
of the projects they fund . . . ”. [Research Fortnight, 28 April 2004]

Other DE predicates that appear in Arg1 of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE in the PDTB or BioDRB are
shown in Figure 1: This list, although long, is only a subset of DE constructions. What about other ones?
Since neither dictionaries nor other lexical resources record direction of entailing as a property, Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2009) attempted to extract DE constructions from the large BLLIP corpus (LDC
catalogue LDC2000T43), using cooccurence with Negative Polarity Items (NPI) like “any” as a cue.

Figure 2 shows the 55 most frequent DE lemmas that Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2009) extracted
from the corpus: Four are negation markers or contain them (cannot, never, nobody, nothing), twelve
have attested occurences in Arg1 of instead in the PDTB or BioDRB (as indicated in Figure 1), and all
but two of the others (compensate for and essential for) can be found on the web in similar Arg1 position
as the attested forms. Why does neither compensate for nor essential for seem to license an alternative
being excluded from consideration, as in
(16) Olivia compensates for eating by exercising. *Instead she ??

(17) Talent is essential for singing. *Instead ???

First, observe that all the DE constructions in Figure 1 and all the lemmas in Figure 2 except for
compensate for and essential for are negative assertions: e.g., bar, block, prevent, and prohibit assert
that something does not occur. In contrast, what is negative in compensate for and essential for is what
they presuppose: Compensate for presupposes that one has done something that one should not have;
essential for presupposes that something cannot occur without it. While a negative presupposition is
sufficient to allow cooccurence with NPIs, as in

(19) The car’s on-board diagnostic systems compensate for any of these blends to keep it running

it is insufficient to license the exclusion of an alternative from further consideration: That requires a
negative assertion. Of course, compensate for and essential for are not alone in this: The same holds for
repent, atone, repair, make amends for, etc. All have negative presuppositions and so can cooccur with
NPIs, but do not make a negative assertion, so do not license an excluded alternative.

While I will continue to refer to DE predicates as evidence for alternatives being excluded from
consideration, I only mean those DE predicates that make a negative assertion and not those that only
have a negative presupposition.

3.3 Modals

The third largest set of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE have a modal associated with Arg1. However,
because there are so many different modals, it makes sense to examine whether all of them license the
excluded alternative of this relation, and for those which do, it makes sense to examine why they can do
so.

Palmer (2001) divides modality into two types:

• propositional modality, involving the speaker’s attitude towards the factual status of a proposition,
as in Ex. 20;

• event modality, involving events that are not actualized, but are merely potential, as in Ex. 21.

(20) Kate must be eating dinner at home tonight. (Otherwise, you would see her at that table.)

(21) Kate must eat dinner at home tonight. (She hasn’t spent any time with her children yet this week.)

Palmer further divides event modality into:

• deontic modality, involving obligation or permission, and conditional factors “that are external to
the individual”

• dynamic modality, involving factors “internal to the individual” (including purpose, wishes, effort,
fears, etc.)

Both types of event modality are found associated with Arg1 of CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE relations.
Ex. 22–23 illustrate deontic modals (obligation and permission), while Ex. 24–25 illustrate dynamic
modals (want/wish/desire/hope and effort).

(22) Charles Kennedy’s advisors should have told him the truth. Instead, they covered up for him to
an unacceptable extent and for far too long. [The Economist, 14 January 2006]

(23) Lynn Sherr could have availed herself of one of the 10.4m private pools in the United States.
Instead, she became determined to swim the Hellespont in western Turkey. [The Economist, 2
June 2012]

(24) Anne Compoccia wanted to be a nun. Instead, she found herself in prison for embezzling city
funds. [http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/nyregion/22DECA.html?todaysheadlines]

(25) Lyndon B Johnson was trying to have the parallel presidency that Dick Cheney secured for himself
under a compliant George Bush. Instead, he was consigned to an office in the Executive Office
Building. [NYRB, 2012]

On the other hand, while Palmer (2001) further divides propositional modality into:



• epistemic modality, involving the speaker’s judgment about the factual status of a proposition;

• evidential modality, involving the speaker’s evidence for the factual status of a proposition.

neither seems appropriate in the argument conveying the alternative that is excluded from consideration,
and there are no such tokens in the PDTB 2.0, the BioDRB, or the Instead Corpus. The examples
in (26) illustrate the inappropriateness of instead with epistemic modals, while those in (27) show the
same is true of evidential modals (where they in Example 27b should be taken as generic, for this to be
evidential).

(26) a. John always arrives promptly, so he must/may have been delayed. *Instead, he decided not to
come.

b. John has a senior pass, so he must/may be over 60. *Instead, he’s not.

(27) a. John seems to have left the house. *Instead, he has locked himself in the lavatory.

b. They say John drinks. *Instead, he smokes weed.

This pattern suggests that modals associated with the excluded alternative of a CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE
relation are ones that mark their associated state-of-affairs as not holding. In her study of alternatives in
disjunction, Mauri (2008) uses the term irrealis to describe an alternative that doesn’t hold. If we follow
Mauri, then we can say that Event modals mark their associated SoA as irrealis because neither factors
external to the individual (obligations, permissions, etc.) nor factors internal to the individual (purposes,
wishes, effort, fear, etc.) can guarantee that the SoA will come to pass.

3.4 Other features

In addition to these three constructions that appear frequently with excluded alternatives are some other
sets that can be characterized by lexico-syntactic features. One is a set of predicates that specify an
actual state-of-affairs (SoA) that lead one to expect some particular next SoA. While expected, this
next SoA does not hold, and so is irrealis. Thus, while not modals, these predicates can be associated
with alternatives that are excluded from consideration for the same reason as modals can. Among such
predicates are expect (Ex. 28), encourage (Ex. 29), and prepare to (Ex. 30).

(28) They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade
surplus with the U.S. Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work
together . . . .[wsj 2321]

where they began building a dream house on the beach. [NYTimes, 14 July 2002]

(30) A gynecologist is slain at home by his wife, who was preparing to serve him coq au vin that
evening. Instead, she thrusts a kitchen knife through his heart. [NYTBR, 4 May 2003]

Other state-expecting predicates found in Arg1 of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE include: anticipate, be
about to, plan, promise, propose, raise expectations, suggest and wait for. As with downward entailing,
state-expecting is not a feature marked in dictionaries, and one may simply have to search for examples
in a large corpus based on what it cooccurs with.

A second set comprises Arg2 of non-factual if clauses and constructions indicating hypotheticals
such as sentence-initial Had. Although downward entailing, they seem sufficiently different from the DE
predicates to warrant separate mention. The three examples of this in the PDTB 2.0 include:

(31) If government or private watchdogs insist, however, on introducing greater friction between the
markets (. . . ), the end loser will be the markets themselves. Instead, we ought to be inviting more
liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants. [wsj 0118]

4 Implicit Chosen Alternatives

Having described features commonly found on Arg1 of explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE that are usu-
ally, but not always, signalled by instead, I now turn to the even larger number of implicit CHOSEN
ALTERNATIVE relations in the PDTB 2.0 and BioDRB. Here, the three features that are most common
with explicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE are even more common with implicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE —
negation markers (Ex 32), DE predicates (Ex 33), and event modals (Ex 34):

(32) It isn’t just exercise gear that isn’t getting a good workout. The fitness craze itself has gone soft,

said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels. [wsj 0174]

Table 1 shows just how much more common they are, both with respect to absolute and relative fre-
quency. In fact, with an implicit CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, either a negation marker, DE predicate or
event modal is present ∼87% of the time.

5 Conclusion

I have left three questions unresolved:

1. What is behind the view that instead is evidence for a type of COMPARISON relation (Martin, 1992)
or a type of CONTRASTIVE relation (Stede, 2012) and behind the decision of PDTB 2.0 annotators
to label three of the 112 tokens of instead as conveying a COMPARISON.CONTRAST relation?

2. Are the features that allow Arg1 to be interpreted as an excluded alternative, sufficient to label an
implicit discourse relation as having the sense CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE, or do negation markers,
DE constructions, event modals and other less frequent licensers of excluded alternatives occur in
Arg1 of other constructions?

3. What features suggest that the two arguments of a coherence relations denote alternatives?

With respect to the first question, researchers since Mann and Thompson (1988) have drawn a distinction
between SEMANTIC and PRAGMATIC relations, which Moore and Pollack (1992) call INFORMATIONAL
and INTENTIONAL, respectively. Moore and Pollack (1992) make a convincing arguement that relations
of both types can hold simultaneously. With respect to instead, I think it can be argued that it conveys
a purely informational relation. That is, instead (when it is not in construction with of, followed by the
alternative being excluded) is anaphoric: Its excluded alternative must be derived from the (previous)
discourse context. The most common thing that a speaker does with this excluded alternative may be to



compare or contrast it with the alternative still in consideration, so that COMPARISON or CONTRAST be-
come the most common intentional relation to hold when instead is used. But other intentional relations
are possible, as evidenced by the many instances of explicit and instead, because instead, and so instead,
etc. (again, not in construction with of ). This will be discussed in a companion paper.

As for the second question, negation markers, DE constructions, event modals and state-expecting
predicates are indeed found in the first (and second) arguments of relations other than CHOSEN ALTER-
NATIVE, including purely temporal relations (Example 35) and causal relations (Example 36):

(35) they may not buy new episodes, when [TEMPORAL.SYNCHRONY] their current contracts expire
[wsj 0060]

(36) The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without
pay because [CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.REASON] the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary

So a procedure for recognizing Arg1 of a CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE relation would use the absense of all
these features as evidence against a possible candidate.

As for the third question – deciding whether two arguments can and should be interpreted as al-
ternatives – it may be that this does not have to be addressed independently, but rather falls out as a
consequence of strong lexico-syntactic cues. This too will be discussed in a companion paper.

I would like to thank my three anonymous reviewers for their very valuable comments on the submitted
version of this paper. In addition, earlier versions of this material were presented as invited talks at
ACL ExProm Workshop in Jeju, South Korea (July 2012) and later at the TAG+11 Conference in Paris
(September 2012). Members of the audience at both meetings were a source of additional valuable
comments, some of which are addressed here and others of which I hope to address in the companion
paper.
