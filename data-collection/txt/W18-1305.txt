Abstract

The classical view on argumentation, such that arguments are logical structures consisting of
different distinguishable parts and that parties exchange arguments in a rational way, is prevalent
in textbooks but nonexistent in the real world. Instead, argumentation is a multifaceted commu-
nication tool built upon humans’ capabilities to easily use common sense, emotions, and social
context. As humans, we are pretty good at it. Computational Argumentation tries to tackle these
phenomena but has a long and not so easy way to go. In this talk, I would like to shed a light on
several recent attempts to deal with argumentation computationally, such as addressing argument
quality, understanding argument reasoning, dealing with fallacies, and how should we never ever
argue online.
