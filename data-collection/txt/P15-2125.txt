Abstract

Code-switching is commonly used in the
free-form text environment, such as so-
cial media, and it is especially favored in
emotion expressions. Emotions in code-
switching texts differ from monolingual
texts in that they can be expressed in ei-
ther monolingual or bilingual forms. In
this paper, we first utilize two kinds of
knowledge, i.e. bilingual and sentimen-
tal information to bridge the gap between
different languages. Moreover, we use
a term-document bipartite graph to incor-
porate both bilingual and sentimental in-
formation, and propose a label propaga-
tion based approach to learn and predic-
t in the bipartite graph. Empirical stud-
ies demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach in detecting emotion in
code-switching texts.

1 Introduction

With the rapid development of Web 2.0, emotion
analysis in social media has become of great val-
ue to market predictions and analysis (Liu et al.,
2013; Lee et al., 2014). Previous researches on
emotion analysis have mainly focused on emo-
tion expressions in monolingual texts (Chen et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2013a). However, in informal
settings such as micro-blogs, emotions are often
expressed by a mixture of different natural lan-
guages. Such a mixture of language is called code-
switching. Specifically, code-switching text is de-
fined as text that contains more than one language
(code). It is a common phenomenon in multilin-
gual communities (Auer, 1999; Adel et al., 2013).
For instance, [E1-E3] are three examples of code-
switching emotional posts containing both Chi-

nese and English words. [E1] expresses the hap-
piness emotion through English, and the anger e-
motion in [E2] is expressed through both Chinese
and English, while the fear emotion in [E3] is ex-
pressed through a mixed English-Chinese phrase
(holdØ4).

(A quote, to my great disgust, is
”There’s no staking claims in a relation-
ship based on who got there first - the
one who isn.t loved is the true third
party.” Shit!)

(The so-called ”highlighting”...we can’t
hold it anymore.)

It is more difficult to detect emotions in code-
switching texts than in monolingual ones since e-
motions in code-switching posts can be expressed
through one or two languages. Hence, traditional
automatic emotion detection methods which sim-
ply consider monolingual texts (Liu et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2013a) would not be readily applicable.

The key issue of emotion detection in code-
switching texts is to deal with the emotions ex-
pressed through different languages. Thus bridg-
ing the gap between different languages becomes
essential for emotion detection in code-switching
texts. A straightforward approach to handle this
issue is to translate texts from one language into
another. Since Chinese is the dominant language
in our data set, a word-by-word statistical machine
translation strategy (Zhao et al., 2009) is adopt-
ed to translate English words into Chinese. Ad-
ditionally, as text from micro-blogs is informal,

763



synonym dictionary and PMI similar based word
correlation (Turney, 2002) are used to enhance the
language model for machine translation.

In spite of the English-to-Chinese translation,
many English and Chinese words are still uncon-
nected. Hence, we use sentiment analysis strategy
(Turney, 2002; Li et al., 2013) to extract the po-
larity of both Chinese and English texts, and then
connect words of similar polarity.

Moreover, for propagating label information be-
tween the bilingual texts from training data to
test data, we use a term-document bipartite graph
to incorporate both bilingual and sentimental in-
formation and propose a label propagation (Zhu
and Ghahramani, 2002) based approach to learn
and predict in the graph. Specially, the label
information between Chinese and English texts
would be propagated through the bipartite graph
by word-document relations, bilingual informa-
tion, and sentiment information. Evaluation of the
data set indicates the importance of the task and
the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

2 Related Work

Emotion analysis has been a hot research topic in
NLP in the last decade. One main group of relat-
ed studies on this task is about emotion resource
construction (Xu et al., 2010; Volkova et al., 2012;
Lee et al., 2014). Moreover, emotion classification
is one of the most important tasks in emotion anal-
ysis, while emotion classification aims to classify
text into multiple emotion categories (Chen et al.,
2010; Liu et al., 2013). Despite a growing body of
research on emotion analysis, little has been done
on the analysis of emotion in code-switching due
to the complexities of processing two languages at
the same time.

Besides, although several research studies have
focused on analyzing bilingual (Wan, 2009; Lu et
al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014) and code-switching
texts (Li and Fung, 2012; Ling et al., 2013; Lig-
nos and Marcus, 2013), none of them has studied
the multilingual code-switching issues in emotion
detection. This research area is especially crucial
when public emotions are mostly expressed in the
free-form text on the Internet.

3 Data Collection

We collect our data set from Weibo.com, one of
the most popular SNS websites in China. We use
encoding code for each character in the post to i-

dentify the code-switching posts. After removing
posts containing noise and advertisements, we ex-
tract 4,195 code-switching posts from the dataset
for emotion annotation. Five basic emotions are
annotated, namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger
and surprise (Lee et al., 2013b). After the an-
notation process, results show 2,312 posts which
include emotions. Moreover, 81.4% of emotion-
al posts are expressed through Chinese. Although
there are a few words of English in each post (an
average of 3 words per post), 43.5% of emotion
posts are caused by English. This statistic indi-
cates that English is of vital importance to emotion
expression even in code-switching contexts domi-
nated by Chinese.

The corpora is annotated by two annotators and
the inter-annotator agreement calculation shows
that the agreement of our annotation is 0.692 in
Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, which indicates that
the quality of the annotation is guaranteed.

Figure 1: Distribution of Emotions and Languages

The joint distribution between emotions and
caused languages is illustrated in Figure 1. The
Y-axis of the figure presents the conditional prob-
ability of a post expressing the emotion ei given
that lj is the caused language, p(ei|lj).

It is suggested in Figure 2 that: 1) happiness oc-
curs more frequently than other emotions; 2) peo-
ple would like to use English text to express the
happiness emotion much more than the sadness e-
motion; 3) the distribution of emotions expressed
through Chinese and English text are similar.

4 Emotion Detection via Bilingual and
Sentiment Information

In this paper, our goal is to predict the emotion
label for each unlabeled post. Simply, we only
choose those posts with single emotion on our re-

764



search. We systematically explore both the bilin-
gual and sentimental information to detect emo-
tions in code-switching posts. Moreover, we use
a term-document bipartite graph to incorporate
these two kinds of information, and propose a La-
bel Propagation (LP) based approach to learn and
predict emotion in code-switching texts. In the fol-
lowing subsections, we will discuss these issues
one by one.

4.1 Bilingual Information

For using bilingual information, a word-by-word
statistical machine translation strategy is adopt-
ed to translate words from English into Chinese.
For better clarity, a word-based decoding, which
adopts a log-linear framework as in (Och and Ney,
2002) with translation model and language model
being the only features, is used:

P (c|e) = exp [
∑2
i=1 λihi(c, e)]∑

c exp [
∑2
i=1 λihi(c, e)]

(1)

where
h1(c, e) = log(pγ(c|e)) (2)

is the translation model, which is converted from
the bilingual lexicon1, and

h2(c, e) = log(pθLM (c)pθSY N (c)pθPMI (c)) (3)

is the language model, and pθLM (c) is the bigram
language model which is trained from a large s-
cale Weibo data set2. As text in micro-blogs is in-
formal, synonym dictionary3 and PMI based word
correlation are used to enhance the language mod-
el for machine translation. pθSY N (c) denotes the
synonym similarity between translated words and
the contexts. This is necessary since the sense of
translated words and the contexts are expected to
be similar; and pθPMI (c) presents the PMI simi-
larity between translated words and the contexts,
while the PMI score is calculated by the individ-
ual and co-occurred hit count between translated
words and contexts from the search engine4 (Tur-
ney, 2002). This is to ensure that the translated
words are highly associated with the contexts.

in total.

3TongYiCiLin is adopted as the Chinese synonym dictio-
nary: http://www.ltp-cloud.com/

4We use BING.com as the search engine for PMI:
http://www.bing.com/

The candidate target sentences made up of a se-
quence of the optional target words are ranked by
the language model. The output will be generat-
ed only if it reaches the maximum probability as
follows (Brown et al., 1990; Zhao et al., 2009):

c = argmax
∏

p(wc) (4)

4.2 Sentimental Information
Sentimental information is very useful in emotion
detection (Gao et al., 2013). In this paper, we ex-
tract polarity from both Chinese and English texts
to ensure text of similar polarity will be connected.

In this paper, both Chinese5 and English6 sen-
timental lexicons are employed to identify can-
didate opinion expressions by searching the oc-
currences of negative and positive expressions in
text, and predict the polarity of both Chinese and
English texts through the word-counting approach
(Turney, 2002).

4.3 LP-based Emotion Detection
For the knowledge of bilingual and sentimental in-
formation to be well incorporated, we use a term-
document bipartite graph to incorporate the in-
formation, and propose a label propagation based
approach to learn and predict emotion in code-
switching texts.

The input of the LP algorithm is a graph de-
scribing the relationship between each sample
pair in the labeled and test data (Sindhwani and
Melville, 2008; Li et al., 2013). In a bipartite
graph, the nodes consist of two parts: documents
and all terms extracted from the documents. An
undirected edge (di, wk) exists if and only if the
document di contains the term wk.

Note that, there are four kinds of terms on the
graph, i.e., Chinese words, English words, trans-
lated Chinese words (bilingual information), and
sentimental features. Although Chinese words and
English words cannot be connected directly, the
label information between Chinese and English
words would be propagated through the bipartite
graph by word-document relations, bilingual in-
formation, and sentiment information. The exam-
ple of the bipartite graph is illustrated on the Fig-
ure 2.

ed as the Chinese sentiment lexicon:

lized from MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon:
http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj lexicon/

Figure 2: Example of the bipartite graph

When all terms are taken into consideration, we
get the transition probability from di to dj as in
(5):

tij =
∑
k

xik∑
k xik

· xjk∑
k xjk

(5)

where xik is the frequency of term wk in docu-
ment di.

After building the document-document trans-
fer matrix through the bipartite graph, we use la-
bel propagation algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani,
2002; Zhou and Kong, 2009) to learn and predict
emotions in the graph, in which the probabilities
of the labeled data are clamped in each loop using
their initial ones and act as a force to propagate
their labels to the test data.

5 Experiments

In this section, we first introduce the experimental
settings, and then evaluate the performance of our
proposed approach for detecting emotions in code-
switching texts.

5.1 Experimental Settings
As described in Section 3, the data are collected
from Weibo.com. We randomly select half of the
annotated posts as the training data and another
half as the test data. FNLP7 is used for Chinese
word segmentation.

5.2 Experimental Results
Our first group of experiments is to investigate
whether our proposed label propagation model
with both bilingual and sentimental information
can improve emotion detection in code-switching
texts. Figure 3 shows the experimental results of
different models, where ME is the basic Maximum

7FNLP (FudanNLP), https://github.com/xpqiu/fnlp/

Entropy (ME) classification model8 in which all
Chinese and English words of each post function
as a feature, ME-CN and ME-EN in which only the
Chinese or English text of each post function as
features, and BLP-BS, our proposed LP-based ap-
proach which incorporates both bilingual and sen-
timental information. We adopt F1-Measure (F1.)
to measure the performance of each model in the
respective emotions.

From Figure 3, we find that the results of ME-
CN and ME-EN are instable. It indicates that on-
ly considering one kind of language text is not
very effective for predicting emotions in code-
switching texts. Moreover, as Chinese and English
texts are taken into account collectively with both
bilingual and sentimental information, our pro-
posed BLP-BS model is significantly better than
basic approaches on all the emotions.

Figure 3: Results of emotion detection

We then analyze the influence of different fac-
tors in our proposed approach with average F1-
Measure of the five emotions with the results il-
lustrated in Table 1. In the table, Basic SMT
refers to using basic word-by-word statistical ma-
chine translation to help the detection process; En-
hanced SMT refers to using both synonyms and
word correlation to enhance the machine transla-
tion process; Sentiment refers to using sentimen-
tal information to help the detection process; ME-
BS refers to using the maximum entropy model
with both bilingual and sentimental information,
and BLP refers to the label propagation model in
which all of the words in Chinese and English text
function as a feature.

From Table 1, it is observed that: 1) senti-
mental information (Sentiment) are effective for
predicting emotion in both ME-based and BLP-

tion; and 3) our proposed approach (BLP-BS) out-
performs the other approaches. This indicates the
complementarity of bilingual and sentimental in-
formation on the bipartite graph based label prop-
agation model.

6 Conclusion

In this study, we address a novel task, namely e-
motion detection in code-switching texts. First,
we collect and extract the code-switching post-
s from Weibo.com, which are annotated with e-
motions. Then, we use both SMT-based bilin-
gual information and sentimental information to
bridge the gap between different languages in
code-switching texts. Finally, we propose a bi-
partite graph based label propagation model to
effectively incorporate both bilingual and senti-
mental information for detecting emotion in code-
switching texts. Empirical studies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms several
strong baselines.

Our current work assumes the independence of
emotions and caused languages. In future work,
we would like to explore the relation among emo-
tions and caused languages for detecting the emo-
tion and caused languages collectively.
