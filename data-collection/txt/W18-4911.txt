Abstract

This paper presents a Basque corpus where Verbal Multiword Expressions (VMWEs) were an-
notated following universal guidelines. Information on the annotation is given, and some ideas
for discussion upon the guidelines are also proposed. The corpus is useful not only for NLP-
related research, but also to draw conclusions on Basque phraseology in comparison with other
languages.

1 Introduction

For Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to produce good-quality results, it is necessary to detect
which words need to be treated together (Sag et al., 2002; Savary et al., 2015). However, identifying
Multiword Expressions (MWEs) is a challenging task for NLP, and current tools still struggle to do
this properly. This is mainly due to the multiple morphosyntactic variants that these kinds of word
combinations can have, especially when their syntactic head is a verb.

(1) They made a decision.

(2) They made some difficult decisions.

(3) The decisions they made were correct.

In order to promote research on this topic, the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of
Verbal Multiword Expressions (VMWEs) was organised (Savary et al., 2017), which holds its second
edition this year. One of the outcomes of this initiative is an MWE-annotated corpus including 20
languages. Along with other relevant resources (Losnegaard et al., 2016), this kind of corpus can be
helpful to tackle the problems posed by MWEs to NLP. The present paper aims at describing the Basque
annotation carried out for this Shared Task (ST), Basque being one of the novel languages included in
the new edition.

Comprehensive work has been done on Basque MWEs, not only from a linguistic perspective (Zabala,
2004), but also concerning identification within parsing (Alegria et al., 2004), extraction of VMWEs
for lexicographical purposes (Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2011) and translation (Inurrieta et al., 2017).
Nevertheless, this is the first corpus where these kinds of expressions are manually annotated1.

The paper starts by introducing what resources are used (Section 2), and it goes on to briefly describe
how the annotation process was done overall (Section 3). Then, the main confusing issues concerning
Basque VMWEs are commented on (Section 4), and a few questions about the guidelines are proposed
for future discussion (Section 5). Some remarks about Basque VMWEs are also made based on the
annotated corpus (Section 6), and finally, conclusions are drawn (Section 7).

done on corpora but on automatically extracted out-of-context word combinations.

2 Resources and setup

For the annotation described in this paper, a Basque corpus was created by collecting texts from two
different sources: (A) 6,621 sentences from the Universal Dependencies treebank for Basque (Aranzabe
et al., 2015), that is, the whole UD treebank, and (B) 4,537 sentences taken from the Elhuyar Web
Corpora2. Thus, in all, the Basque corpus consists of 11,158 sentences (157,807 words).

The UD subcorpus comprises news from Basque media, whereas the Elhuyar subcorpus consists of
texts which were automatically extracted from the web. Although only good-quality sources were se-
lected and a cleanup was done before performing the annotation, a few strange sentences can still be
found in this part due to automatic extraction (such as sentences missing some words or a few words in
languages other than Basque). Scripts made available by the ST organisers3 were used to prepare the
corpus before and after annotation.

Likewise, the annotation guidelines4 created specifically for the ST edition 1.1 were used. The
guidelines are intended to be universal and were the result of thoughtful discussions among experts
from many different languages (Savary et al., 2018). Six different categories of VMWEs are included
in the guidelines, but only two of them are applicable to Basque: Verbal Idioms (VID) and Light Verb
Constructions (LVCs), the latter being divided into two subcategories, LVC.full and LVC.cause. All of
them are universal categories.

Detailed information about each of the categories can be found in the guidelines, as well as decision
trees and specific tests provided in order to make it easier to decide whether/how a given combination
should be annotated. As a brief explanation to better follow the content of this paper, categories can be
broadly defined as follows.

• VID: combinations of a verb and at least another lexicalised component whose meaning is not
derivable from the separate meanings of the component words.

(4) adarra jo5
horn-the.ABS play
‘(to) trick, (to) pull somebody’s leg’

• LVC.full: combinations of a verb and a noun phrase (sometimes introduced or followed by an
adposition) where the noun denotes an event or state and the verb adds only morphological features
but no meaning.

(5) proba egin
test.BARE do
‘(to) try’

• LVC.cause: combinations of a verb and a noun phrase (sometimes introduced or followed by an
adposition) where the noun denotes an event or state and the verb is causative.

(6) berri izan
news.BARE have
‘(to) know (about), (to) have heard (of)’

As for the annotation platform, FLAT6 was used, which has a very user-friendly interface and greatly
simplifies the task of adding, deleting or modifying tags.

3 The annotation process

The annotation process had several phases. First of all, a few training sessions were organised with a dual
objective: on the one hand, to help participants get familiarised with the guidelines and the annotation
platform; on the other hand, to identify tricky issues that might arise from annotating Basque VMWEs
in corpora. Some decisions were made on problematic cases, which were then collected in an internal
document to be used as a reference tool along with the guidelines.

Six experts took part in this annotation task: five linguists and a lexicographer, most of which have
broad experience in the field of phraseology. The training sessions will now be briefly described (Section
3.1), and some more details on the final annotated corpus will be given (Section 3.2).

3.1 Training sessions

After receiving explanations about the guidelines and the annotation platform, all participants were asked
to annotate the same part of the corpus: 500 sentences in all. At this first attempt, the degree of disagree-
ment was considerably high among annotators, whose number of tags varied from 85 to 170 for the same
sentences. The main reason for this was that two oposed positions were adopted: whereas some partici-
pants marked everything which showed any kind of similarity with VMWEs, others opted for annotating
only the cases they were completely sure of.

All examples which caused disagreements were collected and classified, and three more sessions were
organised, where participants tried to reach an agreement on the main problematic cases. A lot of the
differently-annotated sentences were quite easy to decide on, as they were due to misunderstandings on
basic concepts, either related to general language or to the guidelines. The rest of the cases, however,
required further discussion. Decisions made on these cases were collected in an internal document for
Basque annotators, so that they knew what criteria they should follow. Details about this document will
be given in Section 4.

3.2 Final annotation and Inter-Annotator Agreement

After disagreements were discussed and decided on, each annotator was assigned some texts, and a small
part of the corpus was double-annotated as a basis to calculate Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA). This
subcorpus was fully annotated by one participant, and was then split into two parts, so that two more
annotators would work on one part each. Following the measurements of the first edition of the ST, the
final IAA scores for Basque are sumed up in Table 17.

sent inst-file1 inst-file2 mwe-fscore kappa kappa-cat
871 327 355 0.86 0.82 0.86

Table 1: IAA scores

As it can be noticed, scores are noteworthily high for all three measures. This is presumably an
outcome of, on the one hand, the clarity of the guidelines and the specific tests provided, and on the other
hand, the effectiveness of the training sessions held before starting the real annotation. Additionally, as
a further step towards ensuring the unity of all annotations, consistency checks were performed once
the main annotations were finished. Considering that before such checks these IAA scores were already
much higher than average (comparing to the rest of the languages included in the ST), the good quality
of this resource becomes evident beyond doubt.

The final annotated corpus comprises 3,823 VMWE tags of three categories in a total of 11,158 sen-
tences. General data about the annotations is collected in Table 2, and further comments on them will be
made in Section 6.

7Meaning of the table columns: sent = sentence; inst-file1 = instances annotated by one of the annotators; inst-file2 =
instances annotated by the other two annotators; mwe-fscore = F score for MWEs; kappa = kappa score for VMWEs annotated;
kappa-cat = kappa score for VMWE categories. More details on how scores were calculated are given in (Savary et al., 2018).

4 Difficult language-dependent cases

As pointed out previously, all the conclusions drawn from the training sessions were collected in an
internal document for annotators. The main issues found during the annotation of Basque VMWEs will
now be commented on, and the decisions made for each of the issues will be explained. Note that only
general questions will be brought here. Individual cases which led to disagreements among annotators
will not be included in this section, although a few examples of this kind were also collected.

4.1 Morphological variation of the nouns inside LVCs

In Basque, noun phrases almost always have a determiner, and there are hardly any instances of “bare”
nouns (Laka, 1996), that is, nouns with no determiner at all. However, the presence of this kind of
noun followed by a (usually light) verb seems to be a common characteristic among VMWEs. More
specifically, it is frequent in VMWEs which denote very common actions, usually expressed by single
verbs in other languages.

(7) lo egin
sleep.BARE do
‘(to) sleep’, (ES) ‘dormir’, (FR) ‘dormir’

(8) hitz egin
word.BARE do
‘(to) speak’, (ES) ‘hablar’, (FR) ‘parler’

While some of these VMWEs accept almost no morphological modification in the noun phrase, others
are also used with determiners and modifiers, as the one shown in Examples (9)-(10). In these cases, the
VMWEs display a canonical morphosyntactic variation.

(9) lan egin
work.BARE do
‘(to) work’

(10) lana egin
work-the.ABS do
‘(to) work, (to) do some work’

Morphological variants of this kind of LVC caused some trouble to annotators at the beginning, prob-
ably because only variants where the noun is “bare” are currently considered MWEs by Basque parsers
(Alegria et al., 2004). Although it has sometimes been argued that instances with a determiner should not
be treated as VMWEs, they pass all the LVC tests in the guidelines. Thus, our decision was to annotate
these kinds of combinations both when they have some determiner and when they do not.

4.2 The future time in LVCs containing the verb izan

Izan ‘have/be’ is one of the most common verbs inside Basque LVCs, but it is also an auxiliary verb,
which can be confusing for annotators sometimes. The usage of this verb is somewhat peculiar concern-
ing the future form of LVCs. When we want to express that a given action will happen in the future, the
verb participle is inflected by taking the morpheme -ko/-go at the end. However, this morpheme does not



90

always follow the verb when an LVC with izan is used: in many cases, it can also be attached to the noun
inside the VMWE, eliding the verb.

(11) behar dut
need.BARE have.1PS.PR
‘I need’

(12) behar izango dut
need.BARE have-FUT AUX.1PS
‘I will need’

(13) beharko dut
need-FUT AUX.1PS
‘I will need’

Example (11) shows the VMWE behar izan ‘(to) need’ in its present form, while the other examples
show two variants of the future form. In Example (12), the -go morpheme is attached to the verb as
usual, while in Example (13) the verb is elided, and the morpheme -ko is added to the noun behar
instead8. Whereas the first two cases must be annotated, there is no VMWE in the third one, as only one
lexicalised component is present, behar.

The fact that izan is also an auxiliary verb makes it easy to mistakenly think that the auxiliary after a
word like beharko is a lexicalised component of the VMWE. However, this difference is an important
detail annotators should always bear in mind. To see this difference, it can be helpful to use a mor-
phological analyzer like Morfeus (Alegria et al., 1996), as it analyses beharko as an inflected form of
behar izan.

4.3 The blurred limit between adjectives and nouns in Basque VMWEs
All languages have words which can belong to more than one different part of speech. In some Basque
VMWEs, it is not always clear if the non-verbal element is a noun or an adjective, and many parsers
struggle to get the right tag. For instance, the word gose ‘hunger/hungry’ can be either one or the other
depending on the context, even though its usage as an adjective is quite marginal nowadays. In Examples
(14)-(15), two VMWEs containing this word and the verb izan ‘be/have’ are shown. Although intuition
indicates us that gose is an adjective in Example (14) but a noun in (15), it is very common for parsers to
tag both instances as nouns.

(14) gose naiz
hungry/hunger.BARE be.1PS.PR
‘I am hungry.’

(15) gosea dut9
hunger-the.ABS have.1PS.PR
‘I am hungry.’

Besides, sometimes, the usage of a word which always holds one category may even suggest that it
belongs to a different part of speech within a VMWE. For instance, the first element in the expression
nahi izan (wish.BARE have→ ‘(to) want’) can take the comparative suffix -ago, which is used to grade
adjectives and adverbs: nahiago izan (wish-more have → ‘(to) prefer’). This usage may suggest that
nahi is used as an adjective in this expression, even if it is always used as a noun out of it.

For coherence, it was concluded that these kinds of examples should all be grouped equally, and they
were classified in the LVC categories. Given that the non-verbal element is sometimes closer to adjectives

8Note that -ko and -go are allomorphs of the same morpheme (due to phonemic context).
9Example (15) is probably a loan translation, as this is the way the idea of being hungry is expressed in Spanish and French,

the main languages sharing territory with Basque. This usage is more recent and, according to some speakers, it is not as
‘proper’ as the first one. However, it is more and more common in real corpora and, thus, it must be considered.



91

than to nouns, it could be pertinent to add a note in the guidelines along with the one about Hindi, which
states “the noun can be replaced by an adjective which is morphologically identical to an eventive noun”.
Exactly the same could be applied to Basque as well.

(16) bizi izan
live/life be
‘(to) live’

In fact, as the adjectives of this kind have identical nouns, combinations like the one in Example (16)
pass LVC tests with no difficulty, and thus, this is the category they were assigned, regardless of their
adjectival nature.

4.4 (Apparently) cranberry words inside LVCs
Some VMWEs which have reached us from a former stage of the language may present some idiosyn-
crasies from a diachronic perspective, e.g. the lack of determiners in noun phrases (see Section 4.1).
They may also contain words which are only used within the context of a given verbal expression. For
example, the word merezi is almost exclusively used as part of the VMWE merezi izan ‘to deserve’.

Something similar occurs with ari in the verbal expression ari izan, which is categorised as a complex
aspectual verb in Basque grammars (Etxepare, 2003). It is used in phrases such as lanean ari izan ‘to be
at work’ and becomes grammaticalised when used to make the continuous forms of verbs, as in jaten ari
izan ‘to be eating’.

For the vast majority of Basque speakers, it is not a straight-forward assumption that these words are
nouns. Nevertheless, if we take a look at the Orotariko Euskal Hiztegia (Mitxelena, 1987), the reference
historical dictionary created by the Royal Academy of the Basque language, Euskaltzaindia10, we realise
that these words have an entry by themselves and are actually classified as nouns. Futhermore, while
speakers might first think that these expressions do not pass test LVC.5, that is, that the verb can be
ommitted when a possessive is added to the noun, some examples11 of this kind can be found in the
dictionary:

(17) Eman diote (...) bere merezia.
give AUX.3PP (...) his/her deserved-the.ABS
‘They gave him what he deserved.’

(18) Ez zuen utzi bere aria.
not AUX.3PS leave his/her practice-the.ABS
‘He did not stop doing what he was doing.’

To sum up, although some non-verbal elements in VMWEs might look like cranberry words, it is
important to contrast information with reference material, especially when the verb is accompanied by
a light verb. For the examples mentioned here, it was clear to us that LVC.full was the category where
they fitted best.

5 Discussion on some conceptions in the guidelines

Overall, it is a remarkable point that the most controversial issues during the training sessions were all
related to LVCs. This is probably an effect of the very high frequency of this type of VMWE in Basque
corpora (more details will be given in Section 6), but it should also be considered that, as far as LVCs are
concerned, there are notable differences between the guidelines and the rest of the literature on Basque
(and Spanish) phraseology. Therefore, it is very likely that this fact has also conditioned the doubts arisen
to participants.

It is an enormous challenge to create universal guidelines in a field like phraseology, where boundaries
are never as definite as NLP tools would need. The guidelines created for both PARSEME Shared

92

Tasks are a really important step towards unifying different conceptions about MWEs, and the clarity
of tests simplifies the annotation task greatly. However, some points might still benefit from further
consideration, which will be briefly noted here. If these points were problematic in other languages as
well, the ideas presented in this section could be used as a starting point for future discussion.

Two main notions will be mentioned here related to the gap existent between the guidelines and our
previous conceptions about phraseology: on the one hand, the understanding of collocations as a phe-
nomenon separate from MWEs (Section 5.1), and on the other hand, the fact that LVCs are defined as
combinations of a verb and a noun phrase only (Section 5.2).

5.1 Collocations as non-VMWEs

LVCs are usually understood as a subcategory of collocations in the reference literature about Basque
phraseology (Urizar, 2012; Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2013), as well as in that about Spanish phraseol-
ogy (Corpas Pastor, 1997). However, in the guidelines, collocations are defined as a mere statistical
phenomenon, and they are discriminated not only from LVCs but also from VMWEs in general. The
line separating ones and others was not always clear, and despite the comprehensive tests, annotators
sometimes found it hard not to annotate some instances which, according to them, were clearly related
to phraseology somehow.

(19) deia egin
call-the.ABS make
‘(to) make a call’

(20) deia jaso
call-the.ABS receive
‘(to) receive a call’

For instance, the guidelines say that, whereas the combination in Example (19) must be annotated,
the one in Example (20) must not. The fact that one passes all tests and the other one does not made it
relatively easy to let the second example apart. However, it is still not that evident to us that it should
not be treated as a VMWE at all, since the noun deia ‘call’ always chooses the verb jaso ‘receive’ to
express that meaning. As a matter of fact, it is extremely rare to see it accompanied by other verbs which
could equally express that meaning, such as eduki ‘have’. Similar examples were found quite often in
the corpus, so it might be worth examining those cases further for future editions.

5.2 LVCs accepting only noun phrases

On the other hand, according to the guidelines, LVCs can only be composed of a light verb and a noun
phrase (except for Hindi, as it is pointed out in Section 4.3). This noun phrases can be preceded by
prepositions or followed by postpositions. According to this, VMWEs like the one in Example (21)
should not be annotated as LVC.full, as korrika is an adverb.

(21) korrika egin
running.ADV do
‘(to) run’

By definition, LVCs are VMWEs where the verb is void of meaning and the other component carries
the whole semantic weight about the event or state the combination denotes. In Basque, many events
can be expressed by adverbs, and this definition could equally be applied to constructions of adverbs and
light verbs like the one in Example (21).

Furthermore, many of these adverbs are created by attaching a suffix to a noun, often -ka, such as
hazka ‘scratching’, which comes from hatz ‘finger’ and forms part of the VMWE hazka egin (scratching
do→ ‘(to) scratch’). Thus, the LVC.full and LVC.cause categories would probably be more coherent if
they had a wider scope and this kind of combination was also considered.



93

6 Information about Basque VMWEs inferred from annotations

As already mentioned, VMWEs from three different categories were annotated in Basque: VID, LVC.full
and LVC.cause. Table 2 shows how many tags there are in the corpus, where the number of VMWEs
annotated as LVC.full clearly stands out from the rest: 75% of all tags belong to this category. If we add
the instances in the LVC.cause group to this number, the whole group of LVCs amounts to almost 80%
of all annotations.

This is not surprising, since, as it is pointed out in Section 4.1, it is not strange that very common
actions expressed by single verbs in some other languages are denoted by an LVC in Basque. Thus, it
was to be expected that the number of instances in this category would be higher in our corpus than in
other languages.

Table 3 makes this fact obvious. It collects the ratio of LVCs and VMWEs per sentence in the Basque
corpus, as well as the average ratio of the whole ST corpus (20 languages in all) and the ratios for
Spanish, French and English corpora12, the three languages which affect Basque the most. In order to
make comparisons properly, only the three universal categories were taken into account, even if all except
Basque include other categories as well. From the languages included in the ST, only Farsi and Hindi
have a higher number of LVCs per 100 sentences (95 and 40 respectively).

VMWEs per 100 sentences LVCs per 100 sentences
Basque 34 27
Average 18 11
French 20 9
Spanish 15 9
English 6 4

Table 3: Average frequencies of tags in Basque, Spanish, French and English

On the other hand, the number of instances annotated as LVC.cause is very low (less than 5% of
all tags), and this seems to be quite a common tendency also in other languages. Considering only
annotations from the three universal categories, the average percentage of VMWEs classified in this
group is only 3% (taking all 20 languages into account). This might be a sign that either: (A) the
LVC.cause category would be better merged with the LVC.full one, or (B) maybe it would be a good idea
to broaden this category so that it includes combinations that are not yet annotated, such as collocations.

Concerning morphology, the VMWEs in the Basque corpus are mostly combinations of a verb and a
noun (94%)13, which was easy to anticipate considering that LVCs can only be of this kind according to
the guidelines. Consistent with other work about VMWEs in dictionaries (Inurrieta et al., 2017), such
nouns are mainly found in the absolutive case (85%) in the corpus, and among the rest, the locative is the
most frequent postposition, as in Example (22).

(22) jolasean ibili
game-the.LOC be
‘(to) be playing, (to) play’

Something comparable probably happens in other languages as well. In the Spanish corpus, for ex-
ample, out of the VMWEs where the main constituents are a verb and a noun, only 23% include a
preposition.

7 Conclusion

VMWEs were annotated in a 11,158-sentence Basque corpus, following the universal guidelines of edi-
tion 1.1 of the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions. In

12Corpora for all languages can be accessed here: https://gitlab.com/parseme/sharedtask-data/tree/
master/1.1

13When calculating this number, non-verbal elements of LVCs which could be either a noun or an adjective (see Section 4.3)
were counted as nouns.



94

all, 3,823 instances were annotated and classified into two main categories: Verbal Idioms and Light Verb
Constructions. High Inter-Annotator Agreement scores make it evident that this is a very good-quality
resource, which can be useful not only for NLP-related research, but also for future studies on Basque
phraseology.

After explaining how the annotation process was organised, the main doubts arisen to Basque anno-
tators while performing this task were commented on in this paper. The decisions taken on language-
dependent issues were presented, and some ideas for discussion on the universal guidelines were also
proposed. If these ideas are shared by annotators from other languages, it could be interesting to take a
further look at them for future editions.
