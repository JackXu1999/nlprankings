Abstract 

The emergence of the internet has led to a 
whole range of possibilities to not only collect 
large, but also highly specified text corpora for 
linguistic research. This paper introduces the 
Multilingual Affective Soccer Corpus. MASC 
is a collection of soccer match reports in Eng-
lish, German and Dutch. Parallel texts are col-
lected manually from the involved soccer 
clubs’ homepages with the aim of investigat-
ing the role of affect in sports reportage in dif-
ferent languages and cultures, taking into ac-
count the different perspectives of the teams 
and possible outcomes of a match. The ana-
lyzed aspects of emotional language will open 
up new approaches for biased automatic gen-
eration of texts. 

1 Introduction 

Sports reportage provided by sports clubs them-
selves is one of the most interesting registers avail-
able for linguistic analyses of emotionally charged 
language. It opens up a lot of room for creative lan-
guage use, starting with the headlines of the match 
reports (Smith and Montgomery, 1989). Another 
reason is that the point of view of the author of a 
match report is clearly definable from the begin-
ning, as it is either a reaction to a tie (that might still 
be perceived as a net loss or win by the team) or, 
depending on the perspective, a loss or a win for the 
soccer club. So, it is easy to assume that the differ-
ent possible outcomes of such a match would also 
produce different match reports in terms of lan-
guage and communicated emotion. Take for exam-
ple the following introductory sentences: 

 
(1) “Peterborough United suffered a 2-1 defeat at Bur-

ton Albion in Sky Bet League One action and lost 
defender Gabi Zakuani to a straight red card dur-
ing a nightmare spell at the Pirelli Stadium, but 
what angered all connected with the club hap-
pened in the final moments of the encounter.” 
(PB220815, MASC, 2016) 

Compared to: 
 
(2) “If all League One games at the Pirelli Stadium 

this season are going to be like this it is going to 
be an entertaining if nerve jangling season.” 
(BA220815, MASC, 2016) 

 
Both describe the exact same match and happen-

ings, but the emotional nuances are completely dif-
ferent. While the match resulted in a loss for the 
British club Peterborough United, as evident in 
quote (1), it turned out to be a win for Burton Al-
bion, see quote (2). This results in very different 
emotions shining through in the corresponding 
texts: while all the frustration for Peterborough 
seems to be piled up in a long first sentence already 
(“suffer... a defeat”, “nightmare spell”, “anger”), the 
winners’ text is shorter and much more positive 
(“entertaining”). 

Knowing about these and other differences that 
occur in biased sports reporting would be especially 
valuable for automatic generation of natural lan-
guage. NLG can be and is currently applied in many 
different ways, ranging from photo captions (Feng 
and Lapata, 2010) to neonatal intensive care reports 
(Portet et al., 2009) and narrative prose (Callaway 
and Lester, 2001). Bateman and Paris (1989) stress 
the importance of tailoring machine generated lan-
guage to the needs of the intended audience. Taking

this one step further, Hovy (1990) describes how 
considering different perspectives on the same 
event, by taking into account the speaker’s emo-
tional state, rhetorical, and communicative goals, is 
crucial for generating suitable texts for different 
hearers. Several companies worldwide already offer 
automatically generated narratives based on data-
bases, e.g. Automated Insights (USA) or Arria NLG 
(UK). However, the reality of automatic text gener-
ation is that not many NLG systems are able to 
adapt to the mood of the recipients of the produced 
text (Mahamood and Reiter, 2009) and to convey 
the mood of the author. While this may not be a 
problem if simple data-to-text output is the aim of 
the system, Portet et al.’s (2009) study shows that 
there are indeed situations that call for a more emo-
tionally informed approach.  

To find out more about the emotional language in 
texts that are produced in negative and positive 
emotional states, the Multilingual Affective Soccer 
Corpus (MASC) was compiled and will be analyzed 
for several aspects of the relation between emotion 
and written language production in three different 
languages. To our knowledge, nothing similar to 
MASC exists at the moment. There is a variety of 
studies concerned with emotional language (e.g. 
Stirman and Pennebaker, 2001) and studies that 
mainly deal with sports reportage (e.g. Müller, 
2007), but none of the existing ones includes a com-
plete corpus of parallel texts of the same event from 
two different perspectives over a whole season in 
three different languages. This paper introduces this 
new corpus and highlights possible uses and ad-
vantages. MASC is available to interested research-
ers on request. 

2  Building MASC 

The corpus includes match reports in (British) Eng-
lish, German and Dutch and was compiled manu-
ally, with the texts being copied directly from the 
individual participating clubs’ homepages. This 
means that the texts are the official reports endorsed 
by the clubs which are published shortly after the 
matches have taken place. The overall corpus com-
prises the 121 different clubs (See Tab.1) which par-
ticipate in the first and second league in their respec-
tive countries. This includes the British Sky Bet 
League 1 and 2 (UK 1/2), the German Bundesliga 1 
and 2 (GER 1/2) as well as the Eredivisie and the 
Jupiler League (NL 1/2) in the Netherlands (Tab.1). 

2.1 Data Collection 

Depending on the websites, the match reports are 
either linked by the clubs themselves as such in the 
“fixtures and results” tables, in which case those 
texts were chosen and saved, or the individual re-
ports have to be located in the respective news ar-
chives.  

In some instances, reports were missing for indi-
vidual matches. Those cases are marked as “not 
available (n.a.)” in the metadata files. As the per-
spectives on those unavailable matches cannot be 
compared later on, they might be disregarded in the 
actual analysis. In the affected matches, the coun-
terparts to the missing texts are still included in the 
dataset. 

The reports are saved as plain text files in UTF-8 
coding in separate folders according to which sub-
corpus and category (WIN, LOSS, TIE) they belong 
to. The metadata for the three main subcorpora is 
split into three separate files. These tables contain 
the names of the text files, the clubs’ and the oppo-
nents’ names, the dates the matches actually took 
place, the outcomes from the respective clubs’ per-
spectives and the date the club homepages were ac-
cessed. They also include basic information about 
the subcorpus, like average lengths or number of 
texts in the conditions. 

As of now, MASC includes the written reports 
themselves, meaning that (elementary) statistics on 
the match, match photos etc. are not part of the cor-
pus.

3 Descriptive Statistics 

This description will present observations about the 
completed corpus, including the whole season 
2015/16 in the three aforementioned countries. It 
contains an overall of 2,916,265 tokens (Tab.2). 
MASC can be divided into different subcorpora, ei-
ther according to language, league or outcome. Dif-
ferentiating between the three languages, 1,515,442 
tokens are part of the British subcorpus, while 
803,793 belong to the German and 597,030 to the 
Dutch part (Tab.3). 

In general, the corpus includes 4,686 reports 
(Tab. 2). The difference in numbers between WINs 
and LOSSes as well as the uneven number of TIEs 
is caused by not available texts, which could not be 
collected and are therefore left aside in the final cal-
culations. The substantially greater numbers of par-
ticipating clubs and game days result in almost 
twice as many texts in the British leagues compared 
to the Dutch or German ones (Tab.2). This is also 
one reason for the significantly higher number of to-
kens in the English subcorpus.  

Table 3 provides a first impression of the average 
lengths of the match reports, which might be an in-
teresting factor for NLG. There are clear differences 
(or preferences) not only between the three lan-
guages, but also the competitions themselves and 
the outcomes. The shortest texts throughout all lan-
guages and leagues by far are the Dutch match re-
ports, which fall short of the English and German 

ones by about 200 tokens on average. The shortest 
Dutch report comprises only 24 tokens (Tab.3, NL 
1) in total. Compared to this, the shortest texts in the 
other first leagues of the other countries are at least 
about four times as long. Furthermore, reports de-
scribing WINs are, on average, longer than reports 
describing LOSSes or TIEs throughout all lan-
guages and leagues. The length of the reportage on 
tied or lost matches, on the other hand, varies 
slightly across leagues and languages (Tab.3). 

Besides text length and emotion words, which 
have already been mentioned in examples (1) and 
(2) in the introductory part of this paper, shift of fo-
cus is another interesting aspect that we observe in 
the texts in the different conditions. For example, 
consider the following excerpts that have been se-
lected from several possible alternatives in the cor-
pus: 

(3) “Pijnlijke nederlaag Ajax bij FC Utrecht (…) Ajax 
kreeg de bal niet uit het eigen strafschopgebied, 
waarop de middenvelder venijnig uithaalde: 1-0.”  

      (AX131215, MASC, 2016) 
 
(4) “FC Utrecht wint van Ajax (…) Het is dat ene bal-

letje waarvan je 86 minuten lang hoopt dat-ie valt. 
En drie minuten voor tijd gebeurt dat.” 
(FCU131215, MASC, 2016) 

The texts again describe the same match, but 
they stress different details. While the loss is an 
“embarrassing defeat” for league leader Ajax 
(“pijnlijke nederlaag”), the win for Utrecht triggers 
pride and happiness (“the one thing you’ve been 
hoping for all 86 minutes long”). Following exam-
ple (4), we can find a detailed account of the win-
ning goal. For Ajax, on the other hand, the short 
mention of the deciding goal in example (3) is pre-
ceded by a detailed account of the teams’ (unsuc-
cessful) defense. So, the focus shifts according to 
the author’s affiliation. However, emotions and fo-
cus shift do not only show in reports of decided

matches. Examples (5) and (6) are taken from texts 
about an, again, randomly selected tied match. 

 (5) “Der 1. FC Nürnberg verliert in der Nachspielzeit 
zwei wichtige Punkte.“ (FCN171015, MASC, 
2016) 

 
(6) “Der FSV Frankfurt sichert sich einen Punkt in 

Mittelfranken“ (FSV171015, MASC, 2016) 

As we can see, both clubs perceive the tie differ-
ently – for the FCN in example (5), it is a lost match 
because the club “loses points (“verliert… Punkte”), 
while the FSV in (6) thinks of the outcome as a WIN 
(“sichert sich einen Punkt”) as they “secure a point”. 
This means that TIEs are usually also perceived as 
lost or won matches and might even trigger the same 
emotional response in both teams (LOSS/LOSS or 
WIN/WIN). So far, the mentioned aspects of match 
reportage seem to appear in all three languages. 

4 Discussion 

In this paper, we introduced MASC as a new text 
collection for linguistic research aimed at improv-
ing biased output of NLG systems across different 
languages. English, German and Dutch might be 
similar and from the same language family, but the 
realization of emotions in a text is not only a matter 
of linguistic preferences, but also rooted in the re-
spective soccer culture. This is why – even though 
close in geographic and linguistic proximity – the 
way emotions are expressed and the emotions them-
selves (e.g. excitement, disappointment, shame, 
happiness etc.) in the conditions may vary more 
than the similarity in languages would imply.  

As a first step towards analyzing the corpus for 
emotional language, we will use the text analysis 
program LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001). For ex-
ample, LIWC can help to determine the proportions 
of negative and positive emotion words, such as 
“defeat” in example (1) or “entertaining” in exam-
ple (2). It can even be expected that the soccer cul-
ture differences in the three countries in question are 
significant enough to also shine through in the lan-
guage of the match reports. The corpus will help to 
contribute to the understanding of how different 
emotional states influence and change written lan-
guage production. After MASC has been com-
pleted, we are planning a detailed descriptive anal-
ysis on surface features, such as already indicated 
text lengths and emotion words, as well as a more 

in-depth analysis of, for example, referential ex-
pressions and pronouns. Further, an analysis of the 
preferred pronouns or referential items in general 
can be carried out. By analyzing the pronouns, it is 
possible to ascertain the focus of the author in the 
respective outcome of the game. If the match results 
in a WIN, does the report focus on the own team’s 
great performance or on the opponent’s failure (“us 
vs. them”)? Does even the perspective on one’s own 
team change (“we vs. they”)? Or, in case of a LOSS, 
are the positive aspects of the game for the own 
team highlighted or rather the superiority of the 
other team? Additionally, we plan to investigate 
whether there are linguistic features that are related 
to the affect present in the texts – for example, 
whether certain grammatical constructions occur 
more in positive or negative contexts. For instance, 
Beukeboom and Semin (2006) suggest that abstract 
language correlates with positive affect. 

Besides looking at potential effects of emotional 
state on language production, we also want to inves-
tigate how authors select game events for their re-
portage. For this purpose, we plan to collect game 
statistics for all games in MASC, to see which 
events are realized in the respective reports, and 
whether there is any bias in this selection procedure. 
This could also provide useful information about 
how game events are generally expressed in lan-
guage, which is helpful for the development of new 
NLG applications. 

These are some of the research questions that we 
seek to answer with MASC. As indicated before, the 
corpus is available on request.
