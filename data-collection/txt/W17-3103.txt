Abstract 

Social connection and social isolation are 
associated with depressive symptoms, par-
ticularly in adolescents and young adults, 
but how these concepts are documented in 
clinical notes is unknown. This pilot study 
aimed to identify the topics relevant to so-
cial connection and isolation by analyzing 
145 clinical notes from in-patients with de-
pression diagnosis. We found that provid-
ers, including physicians, nurses, social 
workers, and psychologists, document de-
scriptions of both social connection and so-
cial isolation. 

1 Introduction 

Social connection and social isolation are associ-
ated with health problems, including mental health 
issues (Matthews et al., 2015; Williams & Galliher, 
2006). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recom-
mends healthcare providers collect social relation-
ship information from individuals using NHANES 
III Social Connection and Isolation Questions 
(IOM, 2015). For example, this survey inquiries 
about how many times per week an individual 
speaks on the telephone with family, friends, or 
neighbors, gets together with friends or others, at-
tends church or religious services, or attends meet-
ings of the clubs or organizations. While these 
questions focus on the quantity of the social inter-
actions, the survey fails to assess the quality of so-
cial relationship and interaction. 
The electronic health record (EHR) can be a rich 
source of clinical information. However, it is not 
clear whether the EHR contains adequate docu-
mentation to support a detailed assessment of so-
cial connection and social isolation. In this study, 
our goals are to understand how social connection 
and social isolation are documented in the clinical 

notes for patients diagnosed with major depressive 
disorder: (1) which providers more frequently doc-
ument social connection and social isolation infor-
mation? (2) what types of clinical notes most likely 
contain descriptions of social connection and so-
cial isolation? and (3) what types of social connec-
tion and social isolation are documented in clinical 
notes? 

2 Method 

In this Institutional Review Board (IRB)- approved 
pilot study, we selected a cohort of adolescent pa-
tients ages 12-25 (mean=17.14, standard devia-
tion=3.61) admitted to a major healthcare system 
between 2013-2016 with at least one visit coded 
with International Classification of Disease, ver-
sion 9 (ICD-9) billing codes for major depressive 
disorder; resulting in 181,880 in-patient clinical 
notes. From this set, we originally planned to ran-
domly sample 100 notes based on the distribution 
of notes generated by provider type: social worker 
(33.5%), therapist (28.8%), physician (22.3), psy-
chologist (12.0%), intern (1.8%), pharmacist 
(0.5%), dietitian (0.4%), nurse (0.1%), and other 
providers (0.6%). It resulted that there was only 
one note individually represented to five provider 
types (i.e., intern, pharmacist, dietitian, nurse, and 
other providers). We, therefore, randomly selected 
additional 9 notes to supplement the sample of 
notes for those five provider types. Totally, 145 
notes were used in this pilot study.  

2.1 Definitions 
Social connection (SC) is the belonging and inter-
personal closeness between an individual and 
other people or society, including friends, family, 
and others (Haslam, Cruwys, Haslam, & Jetten, 
2015; Milner et al., 2015; van Bel, Smolders, 
IJsselsteijn, & de Kort, 2009). High quality social 

26



connections or networks are associated with in-
creased positive health behaviors (Cohen & 
Janicki-Deverts, 2009; Walton & Cohen, 2011), 
improved academic outcome (Walton & Cohen, 
2011), and reduced depressive symptoms 
(Williams & Galliher, 2006). 

Social isolation (SI) is a lack of contact and en-
gagement between oneself and society (Cacioppo 
& Cacioppo, 2014; Nicholson, 2012; Zavaleta, 
Samuel, & Mills, 2014). There are two types of so-
cial isolation: objective isolation, such as absence 
or limited number of meaningful social interac-
tions; and subjective isolation where an individual 
reports feeling socially isolated or loneliness 
(Cacioppo & Cacioppo, 2014; Zavaleta et al., 
2014). Social isolation has been associated with de-
pression (Matthews et al., 2015; Tiwari & Ruhela, 
2012). 

2.2 Corpus Annotation 
We developed an initial codebook based on the 
NHANES III Questions for social connections. For 
social isolation, we . Other codes   Then,  
Two annotators who are registered nurses with 
clinical experienced, including taking care of de-
pressive patients, reviewed ten notes and devel-
oped a coding schema. Then, each individually 
coded another ten notes, and inter-annotator agree-
ment (IAA) was calculated. The IAA was high for 
both SC (observed agreement: 0.974; Cohen’s 
kappa: 0.80) and SI (observed agreement: 0.997, 
Cohen’s kappa: 0.90); hence, both annotators con-
tinued independently annotating mentions of SC 
and SI from the remaining 135 notes. The annota-
tion outcome was reviewed together and any dis-
crepancy discussed. To be explicit about the codes 
for SC and SI, we used the concepts from 
NHANES III as subtypes of SC. We identified sub-
types of SI from review of the clinical notes and 
based on the literature. Qualitative data analysis 
software, NVivo (version 11), was used for this cor-
pus analysis. 

2.3 Corpus Analysis 
For the corpus analysis, we (1) described the sub-
types of SC and SI, (2) determined the distribution 
of SC and SI mentions by provider type, and (3) 
determined the distribution of subtypes of SC and 
SI across clinical notes.  

3 Results  

Among 145 clinical notes, 34.5% (n=50) contain 
either SC or SI mentions; 7% (n=10) of notes con-
tain both SC and SI mentions. 32.4% (n=47) of 
notes contain only SC mentions; in contrast to, 
9.0% (n=10) with only SI mentions.  

3.1 Subtypes of SC and SI  
We report the distribution of SC and SI subtypes 
based on the number of clinical notes and the 
number of mentions (Table 1).

Table 1. Distribution of SC and SI mentions 

Seven SC subtypes were observed: family or rel-
atives, school activity, friend, marital status, so-
cial-cultural, spiritual activities, and employment. 
They included activities or experiences with others: 
engaging in spiritual, academic, cultural, or work 
activities and committing to a personal relationship 
status. For example, “patient stated her parents and 
family are her biggest support.” 

27



Eight SI subtypes were observed: restriction 
from contact with others, being asked to leave oth-
ers or groups, distancing self from desired relation-
ships, isolation, not being understood, lack of 
meaningful social institutions, feeling loneliness, 
and lack of meaningful social relationship. These 
subtypes can be divided into objective isolation 
(i.e., restriction from contact with others, being 
asked to leave others or groups, distancing self 
from desired relationships, and isolation) and sub-
jective isolation (i.e., not being understood, lack of 
meaningful social institutions, feeling loneliness, 
and lack of meaningful social relationship) based 
on whether the mention related to self-expression. 
For example, “patient mentioned that Mom doesn't 
understand symptoms of depression and thinks I 
am lazy.” 

The most frequent subtypes of SC were: family 
or relatives, school activity, and friend. The most 
frequent subtypes of SI were: restriction from con-
tact with others, being asked to leave others or 
groups, distancing self from desired relationships, 
and isolation (Table 1). 

3.2 Provider Types 
In Table 2, we report the distribution of notes con-
taining one or more mentions of SC and SI by pro-
vider type. The highest frequencies of SC and SI 
mentions were written by physicians and social 
workers.

3.3 Clinical Note Types 
Among 145 notes, more than 20 different note 
types were observed. The majority of notes were: 

behavioral health group notes (n=41, 28.3%), un-
specified due to lack of the note title (n=28, 
19.3%), psychiatric attending daily progress notes 
(n=17, 11.7%), psychology progress notes (n=12, 
8.3.7%), nutrition reassessments (n=9, 6.2%), and 
progress notes (n=9, 6.2%). Some note types are 
written by multiple providers. For example, social 
workers, psychologists, or therapists can document 
behavioral health group notes. Similarly, a provider 
could be the author of multiple note types. For ex-
ample, a social worker can document behavioral 
health group notes, behavior health social work 
notes, or discharge notes. The detailed distribution 
of each SC or SI subtype by note types is presented 
in Table 3.

psychology progress notes (n=37, 15.4%), psychi-
atric attending daily progress notes (n=29, 12.0%), 
behavior health social work notes (n=28, 11.6%), 
and behavior health clinical intake assessments 
(n=23, 9.5%). More than 80% of SI mention were 
identified from psychiatric attending admit notes 
(n=6, 27.3%), behavior health clinical intake as-
sessments (n=5, 22.7%), psychology progress 
notes (n=3, 13.6%), psychiatric attending daily 
progress notes (n=3, 13.6%), and behavioral health 
group notes (n=2, 9.1%). 

4 Discussion 

We conducted a corpus analysis to characterize the 
documentation of SC and SI mentions in clinical 
notes from patients diagnosed as depression. About 
a third of notes contain only mentions of SC; in 
contrast to 9% of notes with only mentions of SI. 
There are two possible explanations. First, the sub-
types of SC were named or grouped by social entity 
because SC has the meaning of belonging to certain 
social groups (Haslam et al., 2015). This may be 
easier to identify from the notes while the subtypes 
of SI were described specific situations which may 
require more interpretation or judgment form the 
annotators. Second, we did not double annotate the 
mentions but some SC mentions with negative 
meanings could possibly be interpreted as SI. For 
example, the SC mention, “Patient’s mom states 
that my son has had difficulty his entire life making 
friends”, implying that mom has been paying atten-
tion about her son’s friendship (a form of SC); 
however, this mention could be also annotated as 
Lack of meaningful social relationship of SI. 
Therefore, we plan to update the annotation proto-
col for the double annotation mention when it is 
needed.  

Mentions of SC often include interactions and 
relationships between the patient and other individ-
uals, the most frequent of which describe family or 
relatives. In this context, most SC mentions de-
scribe receiving support from a parent or sibling or 
perhaps missing loved ones who live at a distance. 
School activities are one of the most annotated 
mentions; this could be because most of the pa-
tients were school age. School activities mentions 
include attending school (middle school through 
college) and living away from home (dorms). 
Friends are also often reported as a source of con-
nection including descriptions of spending leisure 
time with a close other or having a roommate at 
home.  

However, patients also report SC difficulties 
such as making friends, desiring a relationship, ex-
periencing jealousy when not receiving attention of 
others, and ending close relationships. Marital sta-
tus mentions were consistently reporting single sta-
tus; however, this is not surprising given the age of 
our study population. Spiritual activity was not al-
ways a source of connection. For example, one pa-
tient reports not identifying with family religious 
values. More informative descriptions of SC in-
clude loving to learn at school and reporting high 
grades in classes, but also include patient’s ac-
counts of dealing with school stresses (bullying) 
and being expelled from school. Patients also re-
port social-culture as a reason for a lack of connec-
tion including descriptions of ethnicity, language 
barriers, and moving cities. 

Although not as frequent as SC, SI mentions 
were observed. Common themes of SI mentions 
include general struggles with isolation as well as 
particular types of isolation including verbal iso-
lation, e.g., being asked to leave others or groups 
(“getting kicked out of the house or dorms”), 
physical isolation e.g., restricting from contact 
with others i.e., avoiding others, being placed in 
time out, having phone privileges revoked, and 
distancing self from desired relationships i.e., vol-
untarily removing oneself from the group, asking 
others to leave, and refusing to talk with others. 
Patients report a lack of meaningful social group 
e.g., unable to find meaningful work and a lack of 
meaningful social relationships e.g., difficulty es-
tablishing relationships outside of family. Impli-
cations and reasons for SI include feeling loneli-
ness and not feeling understood by family e.g., 
“doesn’t understand their illness or listen to 
them”. 

The notes containing the highest frequencies of 
SC and SI mentions were written by physicians, so-
cial workers, psychologist, and nurses. This sug-
gests that future efforts could be focused on spe-
cific providers’ notes. 

5 Limitations and Future Work 

This pilot work has limitations. We only annotated 
145 clinical notes and new information about SC 
and SI may emerge with continued annotation ef-
forts on a larger sample. Therefore, we plan to con-
tinue the annotation work until there is no new in-
formation identified. The patients were adolescents 
or young adults with depression; therefore, the 
findings may not generalize to other patient popu-
lations or clinical problems.

6 Conclusion 

This study is the first study to explore SC and SI 
from EHR clinical notes and a precursor to more 
computational work for extracting SC and SI infor-
mation from the notes. We found that SC and SI 
information documented in the notes and can be re-
liably identified with human review suggesting the 
content may be amenable to more automated meth-
ods (natural language processing). We are actively 
developing a linguistic model to support SC and SI 
information extraction and qualification of the re-
lationship of SC and SI information as this relates 
to a patient’s mental health status and outcomes of 
depression treatment.
