Abstract

Arabizi is a form of writing Arabic text which
relies on Latin letters, numerals and punctua-
tion rather than Arabic letters. In the literature,
the difficulties associated with Arabizi senti-
ment analysis have been underestimated, prin-
cipally due to the complexity of Arabizi. In
this paper, we present an approach to automat-
ically classify sentiments of Arabizi messages
into positives or negatives. In the proposed
approach, Arabizi messages are first translit-
erated into Arabic. Afterwards, we automat-
ically classify the sentiment of the translit-
erated corpus using an automatically anno-
tated corpus. For corpus validation, shallow
machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vectors Machine (SVM) and Naive Bays (NB)
are used. Simulations results demonstrate the
outperformance of NB algorithm over all oth-
ers. The highest achieved F1-score is up to
78% and 76% for manually and automatically
transliterated dataset respectively. Ongoing
work is aimed at improving the transliterator
module and annotated sentiment dataset.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis (SA), also called opinion min-
ing, is the field of study that analyzes people’s
opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, at-
titudes, and emotions towards entities such as
products, services, organizations, individuals, is-
sues, events, topics, and their attributes. It repre-
sents a large problem space(Liu, 2012). To deter-
mine whether a document or a sentence expresses
a positive or negative sentiment, three main ap-
proaches are commonly used, the lexicon based
approach (Taboada et al., 2011), machine learn-
ing (ML) based approach (Maas et al., 2011) and
a hybrid approach (Khan et al., 2015). English has

the greatest number of sentiment analysis studies,
while research is more limited for other languages
including Arabic and its dialects (Alayba et al.,
2017; Guellil and Boukhalfa, 2015).

ML based sentiment analysis is a more domi-
nant approach in the literature but it requires an-
notated training data. One of the majors prob-
lems related to the treatment of Arabic and its
dialect is the lack of resources. Other domi-
nant problems include the non standard roman-
ization (called Arabizi) that Arabic speakers often
use in social media. Arabizi uses Latin alphabet,
numbers, punctuation for writing an Arabic word
(For example the word "mli7", combined with
Latin letters and numbers, becomes the romanized
form of the Arabic word "iJ
ÊÓ" meaning "good").
To the best of our knowledge, limited work has
been conducted on sentiment analysis of Arabizi
((Duwairi et al., 2016; Guellil et al., 2018)). The
reason behind the lack of contribution is the com-
plexity of Arabizi. Most researches are therefore
moving towards the transformation of Arabizi into
Arabic. This transformation or passage is recog-
nized by the transliteration. Therefore, transliter-
ation is only a process of passing from a written
text in a given script or alphabet to another (Guellil
et al., 2017c; Kaur and Singh, 2014). To bridge the
gap, this paper proposes an approach determining
the sentiment of Arabizi messages after translit-
erating them. This paper is organized as follows,
Section 2 presents an overview of Arabizi. Section
3 presents the related work on SA and machine
transliteration (MT). Section 4 presents the pro-
posed approach and related components. Section
5 presents the simulation and experimentation. Fi-
nally, Section 6 presents the conclusion with some
future directions.

2 Arabizi: An overview

Arabic speakers on social media, discussion fo-
rums, Short Messaging System (SMS), and on
line chat applications often use a non standard ro-
manization called "Arabizi" (Darwish, 2013; Bies
et al., 2014). For example, the sentence: "rani
fer7ana" (which means I am happy and correspond
to the arabic sentence: �é 	K A �gQ 	¯ ú




	
G @ �P) is written in

Arabizi. Hence, Arabizi is an Arabic text written
using Latin characters, numerals and some punc-
tuations (Darwish, 2013). The challenge behind
Arabizi is the presence of many forms of the same
word. For example the authors in (Ryan et al.,
2014) argued that the word é<

�
Ë @ Z A

�
�


	
à@ (meaning

if the god willing) could be written in 69 different
manners.

3.1 Machine learning Arabic sentiment
analysis

ML based sentiment analysis requires annotated
data. Among the corpora presented in the lit-
erature and focused on MSA, we cite: LABR
(Aly and Atiya, 2013), AWATIF (Abdul-Mageed
and Diab, 2012), ASTD (Nabil et al., 2015) and
ArTwitter (Abdulla et al., 2013). LABR con-
tains 63,257 comments annotated with stars rang-
ing from 1 to 5. AWATIF is a multi-genre corpus
containing 10,723 sentences manually annotated
in objective and subjective sentences. ASTD con-
tains 10,000 Arab Tweets classified into objective,
subjective positive, subjective negative or subjec-
tive mixed. ArTwitter contains 2,000 tweets man-
ually annotated into positive and negative. How-
ever, most of the aforementioned works suffer
from manual annotation and almost all resources
are not publicly available. In addition, constructed
corpora are dedicated to some dialects, neglecting
others (specially Maghrebi dialect such as Moroc-
can or Algerian dialect).

3.2 Arabizi Transliteration
The proposed approach is inspired by the work
presented in (van der Wees et al., 2016), where
the authors used a table extracted from Wikipedia1

for the passage from Arabizi to Arabic. The orig-
inality of our transliteration approach compared
to this work is the treatment of ambiguities re-
lated to Arabizi transliteration such as: (a) Am-

1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet

biguity of the vowels, where each vowels can be
replaced by different letters or by NULL character
(b) Ambiguity of the characters having the same
sound or whose sounds are close, for example, the
letters ’s’ and ’c’ which can be replaced by the
two letters  and  (c) Ambiguity related to the
transliteration direction, unlike the different works
in (Guellil et al., 2017c,b), the rules of passage that
we defined are from Arabizi to Arabic. The re-
verse passage may cause several ambiguities. The
proposed approach is also inspired by the works
presented in (Guellil et al., 2017c,b; Nouvel et al.)
that uses a language model to determine the best
possible candidate for a word in Arabizi. How-
ever, their work relies on a parallel corpus corre-
sponding to the transliteration of a set of messages
from Arabizi to Arabic. The realization of this cor-
pus is usually done manually, which is a very time
and effort consuming work. Hence, we avoid us-
ing a parallel corpus between Arabizi and Arabic
and applied a language model (based on large cor-
pus extracted from social media) to extract the best
candidate.

3.3 Arabizi Sentiment Analysis

Different works have been proposed for han-
dling Arabizi Darwish (2013); Guellil and Faical
(2017); Azouaou and Guellil (2017); Guellil and
Azouaou (2016). However,to the best of our
knowledge, limited work has been conducted on
sentiment analysis of Arabizi (Duwairi et al.,
2016; Guellil et al., 2018). In (Duwairi et al.,
2016), the authors presents a transliteration step
before proceeding to the sentiment classification.
However their approach present two majors draw-
backs: (1) They rely on a very basic table for
the passage from Arabizi to Arabic which can-
not handle Arabizi ambiguities. (2) They con-
struct a small annotated corpus manually (contain-
ing 3026 messages). This corpus contains Ara-
bizi messages which therefore transliterated into
Arabic. In (Guellil et al., 2018), the authors au-
tomatically construct an annotated sentiment Ara-
bizi corpus and directly applied sentiment classi-
fication without calling the transliteration process.
However, the authors confronted several ambigu-
ity problems which resulted low F1-score of 66%.
In contrast, the purpose of our paper is to present
an approach dedicated to Arabizi sentiment anal-
ysis by calling transliteration process. The sen-
timent analysis corpus (training corpus) contains

Figure 1: A general architecture of our approach for
Arabizi sentiment analysis

Arabic messages (Modern Standard Arabic MSA
and Dialectal Arabic DA, specially Algerian di-
alect) and it is constructed automatically. For
transliteration step, this paper is focused on am-
biguities treatment (especially vowels).

4 Methodology

This paper presents an approach for Arabizi Sen-
timent Analysis. Figure 1 summarizes the main
steps of the proposed approach, including:

• Automatic construction of Arabic sentiment
lexicon.

• Automatic annotation of Arabic messages

• Arabizi transliteration

• Sentiment classification of Arabic messages

4.1 Automatic construction of Arabic
sentiment lexicon

In this study, the sentiment lexicon is constructed
by translating an existing English lexicon, namely
SOCAL (Taboada et al., 2011) to Arabic. We opt
for using SOCAL rather than other lexicons such
as SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) or Sen-
tiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2010) because SOCAL
contains a large number terms and in this study,
we are not focusing on the context of terms but
only on its global valence. The text is translated
using the Glosbe API2, which takes an English

2https://glosbe.com/en/arq/excellent

word as input and returns a set of equivalent in
other languages. In this work we focus on Arabic
and its dialect (MSA + dialect). We choose this
API because, to the best of our language, it is the
unique API dealing with some dialects with scarce
resources such as the Algerian dialect. After the
automatic translation, the same score is assigned
to all the translated words. This score corresponds
to the score of English word from which they are
translated. For example, all the translations of the
English word ’excellent’ with a score of +5, such
as ù



ëA

�
K. (bAhy),

	
­J
¢Ë (lTyf), and ’iJ
ÊÓ’ (mlyH),

are assigned a score of +5. 6 769 terms were
obtained including negative sentiment terms (la-
bels ranging between -1 and -5) and positive terms
(labels ranging between +1 and +5). Since some
Arabic sentiment words result from different En-
glish words having different sentiment scores, an
average score is assigned to such English words.
Lastly, the resulted lexicon is manually reviewed
to retain correct sentiment words. The final lex-
icon contains 1 745 terms (in Algerian dialect)
where 968 are negative, 6 are neutral and 771 are
positives. We choose to apply our approach to Al-
gerian dialect for comparing our results to those
obtained in (Guellil et al., 2018).

4.2 Automatic Annotation of Arabic
messages

The constructed lexicon is used to automatically
provide a sentiment score for Arabic utterances.
The lexicon is used to build a large sentiment cor-
pus. To calculate the score, we considered: (1)
Opposition (2) Multi-word expressions (because
the constructed lexicon contains multi-word en-
tries) (3) Handling Arabic morphology by em-
ploying a simple rule-based light stemmer that
handles Arabic prefixes and suffixes (4) Negation
which can reverse polarity. Negation in some Ara-
bic dialect is usually expressed as an attached pre-
fix, suffix, or a combination of both.

To score a message, the sentiment scores of
all words in the message are averaged. Finally,
balanced dataset is constructed by keeping the
same number of messages in positive and nega-
tive dataset. The resulted corpus contains 255,008
messages (where both positive and negative cor-
pus contains 127,504 messages).



338

4.3 Arabizi Transliteration
The proposed transliteration approach includes
four important steps: (1) pretreatment of the Ara-
bic corpus and the Arabizi message. (2) Proposal
and application of the rules for the Algerian Ara-
bizi. (3) Generating the different candidates. (4)
Extraction of the best candidate. This part re-
ceives input, a set of messages written in Arabizi
and a voluminous corpus written in DA extracted
from Facebook. All these messages are pretreated
(i.e. deleting exaggeration, etc). Afterwards, a
set of passages rules are proposed (i.e. the letter
’a’ could be replaces by ’¨ ,


@ , ø ,

�
è , @’, etc. It

could also be replaced by ”, none letters when it
represents a diacritic). By applying different re-
placements, as well as different rules developed,
each Arabizi word gives birth to several words in
Arabic. For example the word "kraht" generates
32 possible candidates, such as: ’ �IëQ»’, ’ �IëQ�¯’,

’ �Ië@ �Q»’ etc. The correctly transliterated word

is ’ �IëQ»’. The word "7iati" has 16 candidates

such as: ’ù


¢J
k’, ’ù



¢J
k’,’ù



£A

�
J
k’. The correctly

transliterated word is ’ú



�
GA

�
J
k’. To extract the best

candidate for the transliteration of a given Arabizi
word into Arabic, a language model is constructed
and applied.

4.4 Sentiment classification of Arabic
messages

In this paper, different classification models are
compared. The document embedding vectoriza-
tion (Doc2vec algorithm presented within (Le and
Mikolov, 2014)) is used (with default parameters).
For Doc2vec, the two methods presented in (Le
and Mikolov, 2014) were applied: (1) Distributed
Memory Version Of Paragraph Vector (PV-DM)
and (2) Distributed Bag of Words Version of Para-
graph Vector (PV-DBOW). Moreover, the imple-
mentation merging these two methods is used.
For the classification part, five different classifiers
are used: (1) Support Vector Machine (SVM) (2)
Naive Bayes (NB) (3) Logistic regression (LR) (4)
Decision Tree (DT) and 5) Random Forest (RF).

5 Experimentations and results

5.1 Experimental Setup
The proposed approach is applied on a Maghrebi
dialect (i.e. Algerian Arabizi) which suffers
from limited available tools and other handling

resources required for automatic sentiment anal-
ysis. Algerian dialect (DALG) is largely pre-
sented in (Meftouh et al., 2012). However, the re-
sources dedicated to the treatment of MSA can-
not be directly applied to DALG. In this con-
text, two large corpora were extracted from Face-
book using RestFB3. The first one was extracted
on September, 2017 which contains 8,673,285
messages with 3,668,575 written in Arabic let-
ters. The second one was extracted on Novem-
ber, 2017 that contains 15,407,910 messages with
7,926,504 written in Arabic letters. The first one
was used for transliteration task where the second
one was used in sentiment annotation task. For
testing our transliteration approach, we used Cor-
pus_50 which is a part of Cottrell’s corpus (Cot-
terell and Callison-Burch, 2014) used in (Guellil
et al., 2017c,b,a). For testing our sentiment anal-
ysis approach, we used Corpus_500 ( an Algerian
Arabizi annotated corpus in (Guellil et al., 2018),
containing 250 positives and negatives messages)
.

5.2 Experimental results

The first experiment evaluates the translitera-
tion module. The transliteration of Corpus_50
achieves an accuracy up to 74.76% (as compared
to 45.35% in (Guellil et al., 2017c)). This re-
sults shows the efficacy of the proposed translit-
eration approach. For sentiment analysis, we used
Corpus_500. This dataset was transliterated auto-
matically with the transliterator module. To val-
idate the quality of the automatic transliteration,
this dataset was also transliterated manually by
Algerian dialect’s natives. The transliteration of
this dataset achieves an accuracy up to 72.05%.
Afterwards, we carried out two types of experi-
ments: (1) SA on test corpus transliterated auto-
matically (2) SA on test corpus transliterated man-
ually. Table 1 presents the performance of dif-
ferent shallow classification algorithms in terms
of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1-score (F1)
for Doc2vec methods (PV_DBOW, PV_DM and
PV_DBOW + PV_DM) and for Tr_automatic and
Tr_manual dataset (respectively referring to the
dataset transliterated automatically and manually).

(because the mistake on transliteration generally
appears on only one letter), (2) The implementa-
tion PV_DBOW of Doc2vec achieved best results,
(3) For classification, NB performed the best. (4)
The results presented in Table 1 largely outper-
form the resulted presented in (Guellil et al., 2018)
(which are up to 66%). However, we were not
able to compare our results to those presented in
(Duwairi et al., 2016) because their data are not
available.However, the most observed errors are as
follow:

• The principal error appears in transliteration
process is related to technique of choosing
the best candidate. The idea of language
model is to extract the candidate having the
most important number of occurrence. How-
ever, in some cases, this techniques returns
an incorrect candidate. For example the
word "rakom" meaning "you are" is translit-
erated as "Õ�P̄" meaning "a number" rather

than "Õ» @ �P" (which is the correct translitera-
tion). The solution to this problem is to in-
tegrate other parameters for determining the
best candidate such as distance.

• Some sentiment classification errors are
due to transliteration errors. For exam-
ple, "khlwiya" meaning good and quiet is
wrongly transliterated to " A�J
Ê

	
g" (meaning

empty) rather than �éK
ñÊ
	

g. Improving translit-
eration will improve sentiment classification.

• Other sentiment classification errors are
due to some errors occurred in the au-
tomatic annotated corpus (so the train-
ing corpus). For example, the messages
ù

g. meaning Djabou the

excellency of the name is sufficient was an-
notated negative (where it is positive). Man-
ually reviewing the automatic annotation will
definitely improve the results.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present an approach to automati-
cally classify sentiments of Arabizi messages (ex-
tracted from Facebook). The proposed approach
constitutes an automatic annotation and transliter-
ation. An Arabic sentiment lexicon is automati-
cally constructed followed by automatic annota-
tion and transliteration (Arabizi to Arabic). The
developed dataset is validated using shallow ma-
chine learning, where the highest achieved preci-
sion is up to 78% and 76% for manual and auto-
matic transliteration respectively with NB classi-
fiers and PV_DBOW vectorization method.In the
future, we intend to further enhance the proposed
approach by improving the transliteration module
focusing the annotated corpus (i.e manually re-
viewing the automatic annotation).
