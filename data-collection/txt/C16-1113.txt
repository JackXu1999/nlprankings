Abstract

There are growing needs for patent analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based
approaches. Although NLP-based approaches can extract various information from patents, there
are very few approaches proposed to extract those parts what inventors regard as novel or having
an inventive step compared to all existing works ever. To extract such parts is difﬁcult even for
human annotators except for well-trained experts. This causes many difﬁculties in analyzing
patents. We propose a novel approach to automatically extract such keywords that relate to
novelties or inventive steps from patent claims using the structure of the claims. In addition,
we also propose a new framework of evaluating our approach. The experiments show that our
approach outperforms the existing keyword extraction methods signiﬁcantly in many technical
ﬁelds.

1 Introduction

Recently there are growing needs for analyzing patents. Many companies want to analyze large amount
of patents for various purposes like patent retrieval or analyzing technical trends, etc. For searching
and analyzing large amount of patents, NLP-based approaches are adequate, and many approaches are
developed (for example (Abbas et al., 2014)). Several keyword extraction methods are proposed in
the context of patent retrieval or information extraction from patents. Most of them use traditional
unsupervised approaches like BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009) or supervised approaches like CRF
(Lafferty et al., 2001). While BM25 tends to extract keywords that are characteristic to each patent, CRF
is applied to extract various kinds of Named Entities such as technologies, effects, and attributes. (for
example in (NTCIR, 2010),(Nishiyama et al., 2010)).

However, considering the original purpose of submitting patents, patents must contain rich information
not limited to the above examples. Especially, every patent must contain what the inventors think as novel
or having an inventive step compared to the all existing works ever. There is no doubt that extracting such
keywords is quite important and applicable to all other patent analysis like patent retrieval or analyzing
technical trend, etc. To our knowledge there are very few works that explicitly try to extract those
keywords that relate to the novelties or the inventive steps of each patent (we will call these keywords as
keywords of novelties in this paper).

In general patent retrieval task, various kind of weights are calculated for keywords/keyphrases. But
these weights don’t necessarily reﬂect the degree of the novelties. Several approaches seem to extract
novel parts of each patent implicitly, but they don’t go so far as to extract keywords of novelties. Besides,
in patent retrieval, similar patents often have different surface expressions especially on the novel parts,
resulting in the situation that the performance in patent retrieval task is not necessarily related to the
performance of extracting the novel part. This means that the extracting keywords of novelties cannot be
evaluated directly in patent retrieval task.

In this paper, we propose a new approach of extracting keywords of novelties from patent claims.
Among various parts in patent applications, patent claims are the most crucial parts that deﬁne the scope

of protection and contain all of the important parts of the invention. Since patent claims are written in
a speciﬁc manner, usual NLP approaches may fail to extract useful information. Therefore, we assume
several underlying structural rules in patent claims and utilize these assumptions in extracting keywords.

In addition, we also propose a new framework of evaluating our approach.
In section 2, we ﬁrst explain patent claim structures and related work to extract those structures. Then
we brieﬂy introduce some approaches of keyword extraction from patents. In section 3 we propose a
novel approach to extract keywords of novelties. And in section 4, we introduce a new framework of
evaluating the performance of our approach. Section 5 shows the experimental setting and the evaluation
results of our proposed approach compared to other keyword extraction approaches. Section 6 describes
some concluding remarks and future application using our approach.

2 Related Work

Several attempts are made to implicitly extract keywords of novelties for each patent, mainly in the
context of patent retrieval. Patent retrieval is a task to extract similar patents when a target patent is
given.(Patent retrieval includes those concepts such as invalidity search and prior art search.) Among
naive approaches that use common techniques in information retrieval (IR), some utilize the features that
are speciﬁc to patent claims, which result in better performance than using usual IR techniques.

Although each patent claim is a plain text without apparent sections, it is built under some rules. There
is no doubt that utilizing these rules achieves better performance in extracting information from patent
claims.

2.1 Patent Claim Structures
Patent claims have speciﬁc structures, and it is difﬁcult to understand the contents except for experts.
Each patent has one or more claims. In case a patent has multiple claims, these claims are divided into
two kinds of claims; independent claims and dependent claims. Each claim can be decomposed to several
structural elements. There are also several types for claim structure like Jepson type or Markush type.
For example, Jepson type has two parts in a claim, preamble and body. In addition, each claim must
declare a subject matter, which corresponds to a noun phrase in a speciﬁc position of the claim.

To extract those structures automatically, several approaches exist. For example, Sheremetyeva et al.
have decomposed each claim to structural elements using POS-tags (Sheremetyeva et al., 1996), Parapat-
ics et al. have categorized claims into several types using cue phrases (Parapatics and Dittenbach, 2009),
and Shinmori et al. have proposed to apply Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for parsing structural
elements (Shinmori et al., 2003).

2.2 Keyword Extraction from Patent Documents
Keyword extraction is an important task for every kind of documents, and many approaches are sug-
gested. The most known approaches are tf-idf, BM25 and TextRank. These approaches are also applica-
ble to patent claims, but these are not designed to extract keywords of novelties, and tend to achieve low
performance in various patent analysis.

For example, TextRank approach is applied (Verma and Varma, 2011) to the whole patent application
or to a speciﬁc part of a patent like patent claim, abstract, or detailed description in order to extract
important keywords for invalidity search. But they did not intend to extract such keywords of novelties.
Besides, they did not utilize claim structure.

Word age of each term is introduced to measure the degree of the novelties for each patent (Hasan et
al., 2009) in order to score novelty of each patent. Word age represents how long the term exists in a
corpus (time span from the time when it ﬁrst appeared to the time when the target patent submitted), and
it represents novelty to some extent. But it is obvious that word age highly depends on the corpus, tech-
nical ﬁeld or surface expressions, which is not related to what inventors think as novel part. Moreover,
inventors don’t necessarily use new keywords to describe the novel part of of their inventions.

Other than those approaches that directly extract important keywords from patent claims, there are

some approaches that patent-speciﬁc keyword extraction are used.

1194

Shinmori et al.(2003) proposed an approach to extract such keywords/keyphrases that are representa-
tive in each structural element in patent claims by using some morphological patterns after decomposion
of claims to structural elements(Shinmori et al., 2003).

Takaki et al.(2004) ﬁrst decomposed each claim into structural elements, and calculated the importance
of each element by a measure of how each term in the element is locally distributed in those elements
(Takaki et al., 2004). Their approach seems to grasp one side of patent claim structure, and their approach
is effective in patent retrieval task to some extent.

Lin et al.(2010) tried more systematic approach utilizing patent claim structure for patent retrieval
(Lin et al., 2010). They built a claim tree by extracting the relations between independent/dependent
claims and the structural elements for all patents, then search the similarities of the claim trees. They
extracted relevant keywords of each structural element from patent speciﬁcations (not from claims) using
term frequency in the speciﬁcations and calculating mutual information of terms selected from claim and
speciﬁcation.

These patent-speciﬁc methods extract keywords from various aspects, but none of them directly tried

to extract keywords of novelties for each patent.

There are other approaches to extract keywords from patent claims using claim structures, but the fo-
cuses are only limited to discriminations like preambles/bodies (Mase et al., 2005) or the subject matters.

3 Extraction of Keywords Related to Novelty from Patent Claims
Compared to the related work, our approach is built under some assumptions of claim structures. Using
these assumptions we propose a new approach to extract keywords of novelties from patent claims.

3.1 Assumptions of Claim Structures
One main reason that a patent is constructed from multiple claims is that an applicant want to protect the
scope as broad as possible after registration by a patent ofﬁce. Patent ofﬁces in many countries examine
patent claims, and if one idea already exists in prior art or easily imaginable from prior art, they refuse
the claim. However, if there is a claim that describes a bit smaller scope of the rejected claim, and the
scope is invalidated by any prior art, this claim is granted. Therefore, applicants tend to submit multiple
claims in one patent with some hierarchical structures of dependencies. In general, a dependent claim
describes smaller scope than that of the ”parent” claim. This means that a dependent claim focuses on
an important part of the parent claim to secure this part. In many cases, this important part (that the
applicant wants wider scope as possible) describes the novelties or the inventive steps that the inventor
wants to claim, or describes the area the patent is applicable.

Besides, each claim usually has multiple structural elements. Since a claim must contain every element
that is necessary, part of the elements are necessary to construct the subject matter but not directly related
to the novelties or the inventive steps of the patent. This also suggests that elements are related to
each other somehow. These relations might represent some process ﬂows or adding functions/features
to other elements. Then we can interpret these relations as some kind of hierarchies. Therefore, just
like dependent claim structures, we can rebuild structural elements in a claim into some hierarchical
structures.

Figure 1 shows an example of hierarchical structures. The element 1-4 is in the claim 1, and the

dependent claim 2 and claim 3 depends on the element 2 and 4 respectively.

Now there is another rule in writing a claim; there must be no unnecessary element appeared in a
claim. This is because an unnecessary element narrows the scope of the patent, and applicants never
want this situation. Suppose that a claim has an additional new element which depends on an key element
containing novelties of the patent (this new element might use the output of the key element’s process
or add some features to the key element), then the claim has only a limited scope compared to the claim
without the additional element. This means that a properly written patent claims contain only a few key
elements and these key elements should be placed in a lower level of the hierarchical structure.

Based on these observations, we assume two things;
• the keywords of novelties tend to exist in the elements that the dependent claims depend on.

1195

• the keywords of novelties tend to exist in a lower level of the element hierarchical structure.

3.2 Outline of New Approach to Extract Keywords
In this subsection, we describe the outline of our proposed approach to extract keywords of novelties in
the ﬁrst claim using patent claim structures under the assumptions in the previous section. (The extension
from the ﬁrst claim to all independent claims is straightforward.) The notation is listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Notation

Step1:extracting element structure: The ﬁrst claim of a patent is parsed so that each structural
element is decomposed, and dependencies within the elements are extracted. Dependencies between the
elements are extracted in the following way. First, the decomposition of each element is done by using
cue phrases (Shinmori et al., 2003) or using line breaks. Then, the depth for each element is calculated
by following the procedure in Algorithm 1. Note that {ei} is a set of elements sequentially derived from
the ﬁrst claim. Those terms that appear in the subject matter are removed from this analysis. Figure
2 represents the example of dependencies using overlapping terms to. The term to3 ﬁrst appears in e3,
then in e4. Therefore parent(e4) = e3, and ET (e4) = to3. Other types of structure extraction is also
applicable.

Step2:extracting claim dependency structure: The claims that depend on the ﬁrst claim are parsed.
The procedure to attach depth for all dependent claims is the same as that of step 1. This means that
overlapping term to is attached for each dependent claim ci, i.e. DT (ci) ← to. In ﬁgure 2, to5 ﬁrst
appeared in e4. to5 also appears in the claim 3, then DT (c3) = to5.

Step3:calculating the score of the representative keywords: For every overlapping term to stored
in the set To, the score so is calculated using the depth of element e(to) and the number of dependent
claims ncl(to) attached to to. The deﬁnition of score so is explained in the next subsection 3.3.

Step4:calculating the score of the keywords of novelties: Keywords k modifying each to are
searched in the ﬁrst claim. Modiﬁcation of to by k is deﬁned by satisﬁng at least one of the follow-
ing conditions;

Algorithm 1 extracting element dependency structure

1. k appears in the element ET −1(to).
2. k appears in the element e(to).
to can be also regarded as k. A keyword k modifying to is represented as to ∈ M od(k) and k ∈
M od−1(to). Note that the mapping function M od and M od−1 is many-to-many mapping. Figure 3
shows examples of modiﬁcations. In every example in ﬁgure 3, k modiﬁes to. Then the score S(k) for
each k ∈ {k| ∪to∈To M od−1(to)} is calculated using the deﬁnition in the next subsection 3.3.

The actual example of claim structures is shown in ﬁgure 4. The boxes enclosed by solid line represent
elements in the ﬁrst claim and those of dashed line represent dependent claims. The bold italic keywords
are the keywords of novelties annotated automatically in the framework introduced in the section 4. The
right side of ﬁgure 4 shows the actual procedure of Algorithm 1 for the ﬁrst 3 elements.

3.3 Deﬁnition of Scores
During the whole process, the locality score for each term w is calculated by

loc(w) =

|{ei}|

|{ei|ei ∋ w}| ,

that is, locality represents how much w is localized among all elements.

The score for overlapping terms is deﬁned as

so1(to) = d(e(to))∗(ncl(to) + 1)
so2(to) = d(e(to))∗(log(ncl(to)+1) + 1),

(1)

(2)
(3)

and using the score of overlapping terms to, the score of k that modiﬁes to is deﬁned in the equation

Sl(k) = max

to∈M od(k)

loc(k) ∗ sol(to)

(4)

with l = 1, 2 and sol represents eq.(2) or eq.(3), respectively. Note that Sl(k) = 0 if M od(k) = ∅.

1197

4 Evaluation Method Using Rejected and Granted Patents

In the previous section, we proposed a new approach of how to calculate the scores for each term k.
This score Sl(k) represents the degree of novelties of term k in each patent. But the evaluation of this
approach is another difﬁcult task. To evaluate the performance of extracting such keywords, we need
annotated data. But manual annotation needs domain knowledge of each technical ﬁeld and expertise
in reading patent claims. Therefore, preparing large amount of manual annotations for various technical
ﬁelds is quite difﬁcult. Since extracting the keywords of novelties is not a conventional task in patent
analysis, there is no commonly available shared task set for evaluation. In this section, we propose a
general framework to obtain annotated data automatically from the examination result of Patent Ofﬁces.

4.1 Process of Patent Examination
Patent Ofﬁces in some countries publish all examination processes of each patent. Basically, a submitted
patent follows a process like this; 1. A patent is examined and if an insufﬁcient part exists, the examiner
reject the patent. 2. The applicant may withdraw submission, or modify the claim to overcome the reason
of the rejection. 3. After repeated examination and possible rejection/modiﬁcation, a patent is decided
to be granted or rejected.

One of the major and critical reasons of the rejection is the existence of prior art that invalidates the
submitted patent. In other words, if this type of rejection is overcome by modiﬁcations of the claims,
this modiﬁed part must contain the keywords of novelties.

4.2 Framework of Evaluation
Based on the assumption, we build a framework to evaluate the extraction of keywords of novelties
for each patent. Each patent document used in this framework must be rejected only by the reason
of existence of prior art and then be granted after modiﬁcations. For each patent satisfying the above
condition, two types of claims are extracted for each patent; the claims before the patent is examined and
the claims after the patent is granted. Then those keywords, which appear in the granted ﬁrst claim but
not in the rejected ﬁrst claim, are extracted. Such keywords are regarded as the positive-labeled set of
keywords of novelties. The reason of extracting keywords only from the ﬁrst claim is, the correspondence
between the two types is clear. (For example, the third claim in the rejected patent corresponds to the
second claim in the granted patent, which is difﬁcult to guess. But usually, the ﬁrst claim of the rejected
patent is corrected by adding keywords from the proceeding dependent claims or from the description in
the application.)

In order to examine the extracted set of keywords are truly positive, we randomly pickup and check
some of the granted ﬁrst claims manually by referencing the arguments in response to the notices of
reasons for rejection (i.e. Ofﬁce Actions). In the arguments, applicants explain how the corrected claims
In this preliminary analysis, the average f-measure of 26 patents becomes
differ from the prior art.
0.8339. This result ensures that our proposed framework is adequate for preparing positive-labeled set
of keywords of novelties at least as an approximation.

The positive-labeled set is compared to those keywords extracted by various approaches for evaluation.

5 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate our approach proposed in section 3 using the framework proposed in section
4.

5.1 Corpus
The Japanese patents submitted during Jun 1 to March 31 in 2005 are used in the evaluation. We selected
patents for each technical ﬁeld corresponding to International Patent Classiﬁcation (IPC) from A to H.
The IPC Section title and the deﬁnition list is shown in table 2 (More detailed explanation can be found
in (WIPO Guide, 2016)). For calculating document frequency in BM25 (one of the baseline approaches
we applied), we use other corpus containing the patent data submitted before Jun 1, 2005. This corpus
contains around 3 million patents.

5.2 Approaches to be Evaluated
As a baseline, we try BM25, the traditional keyword extraction approach. Besides, we also try several
naive approaches that are easily conceivable from the related work in section 2. One is using locality as
a score deﬁned in eq.(1). This is similar to Takaki(2004)’s approach while they also used element-wise
score as well. Here we prepare two types of element-wise score referring to Takaki’s approach.

Moreover we prepare one simple extension of BM25:

Sbase2(w) = max

˜Se2(ei) ∗ BMi(w)

where BMi(w) represents the value of BM25 of w regarding the element ei as a document.

The table 3 shows the deﬁnition of scores of tested approaches. Proposed1 and Proposed2 are our new
proposed approaches introduced in section 3. BM25 is the baseline approach. BM25perEle, Loc*Ele1
and Loc*Ele2 are the approaches easily conceivable from the related work.

5.3 Evaluation Results
We evaluate the performance of keyword extraction using each score by Mean Average Precision (MAP)
which is often used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval. Since several types of scores
like our proposed approaches or locality tend to have the same value for multiple terms, we calculate all
the orders for those tie ranks and averaged the MAP value of each order.

The result is in the table 4. This shows that in every technical ﬁeld our proposed approaches Pro-
posed1, Proposed2 outperform the baselines using BM25 or those approaches that are easily conceiv-
able from the relate work. Especially the approach Proposed2 signiﬁcantly outperforms the baselines
in most of the tehcnical ﬁelds except for IPC=C (chemistry). One reason for relatively low performance
of our proposed approach in the ﬁeld of chemistry is, that patent claims in the ﬁeld are often the type of
Markush Claim which doesn’t ﬁt our current structure parsing method in step1 of subsection 3.2 (The
current method ﬁts Jepson Claim better).

6 Conclusion
We propose a new approach to extract keywords of novelties from patent claims. It is a challenging task
partly because the problem setting itself is rather unique, and partly because there has been no framework
to evaluate the performance directly. We show that the existing keyword extraction techniques don’t
work well when analyzing patent claims, since patent claims have a speciﬁc format that a non-expert
ﬁnds difﬁcult. Although analyzing patent claims is quite important in many industries, understanding the
contents of claims using NLP techniques is still in a developing phase.

Table 4: MAP result

While there are works on extracting novelties from trend analysis of news, SNS or other documents,
these are mainly aiming to extract only keywords from those documents with brand new contents. But
in patent claims, novelties are often represented in general expressions. This is one main reason that we
focus on extracting what inventors think as novel for every patent using the structures of patent claims.
In this paper we apply only preliminary approaches, but additional attempts such as using key phrases,
using dependencies between terms, or using other ﬁelds in patent speciﬁcations will surely increase the
performance. Moreover, since annotated data is available using our proposed framework, supervised
approaches are applicable. Combining features like eq.(4) with other features derived from patent claim
structures, supervised approaches may give us some knowledges on what kind of structure may be effec-
tive for extracting keywords of novelties.

A simple expansion of the method in step 1 of subsection 3.2 to Markush Claim will also increase the

performance in the ﬁeld of chemistry.

Future work also includes applying our approach to patent retrieval, patent summarization, or detecting

important technologies.
