Abstract

Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated on written image
descriptions. At the same time, these systems are often used to provide spoken descriptions (e.g.
for visually impaired users) through apps like TapTapSee or Seeing AI. This is not a problem, as
long as spoken and written descriptions are very similar. However, linguistic research suggests
that spoken language often differs from written language. These differences are not regular, and
vary from context to context. Therefore, this paper investigates whether there are differences
between written and spoken image descriptions, even if they are elicited through similar tasks.
We compare descriptions produced in two languages (English and Dutch), and in both languages
observe substantial differences between spoken and written descriptions. Future research should
see if users prefer the spoken over the written style and, if so, aim to emulate spoken descriptions.

1 Introduction

Automatic image description systems (Bernardi et al., 2016) are commonly trained and evaluated on
datasets of described images, such as Flickr30K and MS COCO (Young et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2014).
These datasets have been collected by asking workers on Mechanical Turk to write English descriptions
that capture the contents of the images that are presented to them. But how much are these descriptions
influenced by the modality of the task? This paper explores the differences between spoken and written
image descriptions. While many papers at VarDial aim to distinguish similar dialects using machine
learning (e.g. in shared tasks such as those in Malmasi et al., 2016; Zampieri et al., 2017), we aim
to identify the features distinguishing two similar varieties (spoken and written language) of the same
language (either English or Dutch) in a particular domain (image descriptions).

One of the motivations behind automatic image description research is to support blind or visually
impaired people (e.g. Gella and Mitchell, 2016), and indeed apps are starting to appear which describe
visual content for blind users (e.g. TapTapSee or Microsoft’s Seeing AI1). These apps are commonly used
together with screen readers, which convert on-screen text to speech. Given this presentation through
speech, it is worth asking: should we not also collect spoken rather than written training data? That
might give us more natural-sounding descriptions. But a big downside of collecting spoken training data
is that it also requires a costly transcription procedure (unless we go for an end-to-end approach, see
Chrupała et al., 2017). An alternative is to try to understand what the differences are between written and
spoken image descriptions. Once we know those differences, and we know what kind of descriptions
users prefer, we may be able to direct image description systems to produce more human-like descrip-
tions, similar to the way we can modify the style of the descriptions, for example with positive/negative
sentiment (Mathews et al., 2016), or humorous descriptions (Gan et al., 2017).

This paper presents an exploratory study of the differences between spoken and written image de-
scriptions, for two languages: English and Dutch. We provide an overview of the variables that have
been found to differ between spoken and written language, and see whether these differences also hold

between English spoken and written image descriptions. Following this, we repeat the same experiment
for Dutch. Our main findings are that spoken descriptions (1) tend to be longer than written descriptions,
(2) contain more adverbs than written descriptions, (3) contain more pseudo-quantifiers and allness terms
(DeVito, 1966), and (4) tend to reflect the certainty of the speaker’s beliefs more-so than written descrip-
tions. Our work paves the way for a future controlled replication study, and follow-up studies to assess
what kind of descriptions users prefer. All of our code and data is available online.2

2 Technical background: Manipulating the image description task

Recently, researchers have started to manipulate the image description task to obtain a better understand-
ing of how this influences the resulting descriptions. This section presents a brief list of variables that
have been considered in the literature.

Language. The most common modification is the language in which the task is carried out (e.g.
Elliott et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Miyazaki and Shimizu, 2016). This is typically done to be able
to train an image description system in a different language, but van Miltenburg et al. (2017) use this
manipulation to show that speakers of different languages may also provide different descriptions. For
example, speakers of American English described sports fans barbecuing on a parking lot as tailgating,
a concept unknown to Dutch and German speakers.

Style. Another possible manipulation is the requested style of the descriptions. Gan et al. (2017)
asked crowd workers to provide ‘humorous’ and ‘romantic’ descriptions, but found that it is impossible
to control the quality of the resulting descriptions. So they, like Mathews et al. (2016), further changed
the description task to a description editing task.

Content. Gella and Mitchell (2016) emphasize the importance of emotional or descriptive content
and humor in the image, and explicitly ask for these to be annotated. This makes the elicited descriptions
useful for training an assistive image description system which can provide descriptions for blind people.

Other. Baltaretu and Castro Ferreira (2016) present variations on an object description task (the
ReferIt task, by Kazemzadeh et al. (2014)). The authors show that asking participants to work very fast,
or produce thorough or creative descriptions, results in very different kinds of descriptions.

While the studies listed above cover a wide range of variables, there are many more possibilities that
are still unexplored. Van Miltenburg et al. (2017) provide a (non-exhaustive) list of other factors that
may influence the image description process. This paper aims to identify the role of modality.

3 Theoretical background: Spoken versus written language

The differences between spoken and written language have been thoroughly studied in the linguistics lit-
erature since the 1960s. Extensive overviews are provided by Akinnaso (1982), Chafe and Danielewicz
(1987), Chafe and Tannen (1987), Biber (1988), and Miller and Fernandez-Vest (2006). Why should
we study differences between spoken and written image descriptions, when so many linguists before us
have studied differences between spoken and written language? Because spoken and written language
are not monoliths. Biber (1988) notes that there is often as much variation within each modality, as there
is between the two modalities. Biber attributes this variation to situational, functional, and processing
considerations (p. 24-25). So while there may be general tendencies for particular linguistic phenomena
to occur more in written than in spoken language (or vice versa), the only way to know for sure how
speech differs from writing in a particular domain is to investigate that particular domain. For image
description, the seminal study by Drieman (1962a; 1962b) is of particular interest to us. Drieman asked
eight participants to describe two realistic paintings (one by Renoir and one by Weissenbruch), provid-
ing either spoken or written descriptions. He found that written texts (1) are shorter; but (2) have longer
words (fewer words of one syllable, more words of more than one syllable); (3) have more attributive
adjectives3; and (4) a more varied vocabulary. The drawback of this study is its limited size. More-
over, it is unclear if Drieman’s conclusions about descriptions of paintings extend to one-sentence image

2Our code and data is available at https://github.com/cltl/Spoken-versus-Written
3In English, this means that the adjective is used in the prenominal position (the good book) rather than postnominal (the

book is good). The same holds for Dutch.

descriptions like those in MS COCO and Flickr30K. This is what we intend to study.
Following Drieman’s study, researchers have proposed many other variables that seem to correlate

with the speech/writing distinction. After surveying the literature on spoken versus written language,
Biber (1988) presents an extensive list of linguistic features. The features used in this paper are based
on Biber’s list, see Section 4.3 for an overview. Noted in almost all surveys is the ephemeral nature of
speech; whereas writing samples can be edited and reworded, speech cannot be edited the same way.
Hence, spoken language also contains false starts, speech errors, and subsequent repairs. But despite
those flaws, we must not think of spoken language as somehow inferior to written language. Halliday
(1989) notes that the two are simply different media that serve different functions, which may require
different forms of language. It is our task, as language users, to pick the right form (and medium) for
the right job. If we find significant differences between spoken and written language, we should ask
ourselves: now that we know about these differences in the way people describe images, which form is
the most suitable for an image description system?

4 Data and methods for analyzing image descriptions

We present an analysis for both Dutch and English image descriptions. For each language, we took
existing sets of spoken and written image descriptions, and automatically computed their differences in
terms of the literature discussed above. The rationale here is that, even if these corpora are not perfectly
comparable, they do provide an indication of the extent to which spoken and written image descriptions
may differ. If we find structural differences between spoken and written image descriptions, it may
be worth it to explore these differences further in a more controlled environment. If we fail to find
any differences, we should conclude that there is no evidence for the effect of modality on the image
description task. But, as we will see later, there do seem to be structural differences between spoken and
written descriptions in both Dutch and English.

4.1 English data

For the written sample, we use the Flickr30K and the MS COCO datasets. Both were collected through
Mechanical Turk, and have 5 written descriptions per image. We only use the training splits from both
datasets, so that we remain ignorant of the properties of the validation and test splits. Figure 1 provides
the instructions for both datasets. One of the main differences between the two is that the MS COCO
instructions explicitly forbid the use of there is at the start of a sentence, which leads to the use of
different syntactic constructions. Otherwise the instructions are very similar.

For the spoken sample, we use the Places Audio Caption Corpus, Part 1 (Harwath et al., 2016; Harwath
and Glass, 2017), which contains about 230,000 spoken descriptions for a selection of images that were
equally sampled from the 205 scene categories in the Places205 dataset (Zhou et al., 2014). The spoken
descriptions were collected through Mechanical Turk using the Spoke framework (Saylor, 2015). These
were then automatically transcribed by Harwath et al. (2016) using the Google Speech API. Because the
transcriptions were not manually corrected, they have a word error rate of about 20%. It is unclear how
participants were instructed to describe the image. The authors only mention that the descriptions are



91

free-form, and that they should describe the salient objects in the scene.4

Image selection. The images from Flickr30K, MS COCO, and Places205 were all collected from on-
line sources. Flickr30K and MS COCO exclusively use images from Flickr,5 while Places also contains
images found through general image search engines (Google and Bing). The main difference between
the datasets is in the kind of images that are included. For the Flickr30K dataset, the authors downloaded
images from six different user groups on the Flickr website.6 The MS COCO authors compiled a list
of 91 object categories, and searched for different object+object combinations of different categories on
Flickr. They also selected 60 scene categories from the SUN database (Xiao et al., 2010), and searched
for different object+scene combinations to diversify their data. Finally, the Places205 dataset is built by
querying different search engines for adjective+scene combinations. The 205 scenes come from the SUN
database, and the adjectives come from a manually curated list. Examples are: messy, spare, sunny.

Comparability. To what extent can we compare the descriptions in these datasets? Ideally, we would
have one set of images that is provided with both spoken and written descriptions. But if the tasks are
similar enough, and we compare the image descriptions on a large scale, we may still be able to confirm
general tendencies of spoken versus written data, e.g. that spoken descriptions tend to be longer than
written ones (Drieman, 1962a), or use more self-reference terms (DeVito, 1966). What we cannot do,
is compare how often particular properties or kinds of entities are mentioned, because the distribution of
those properties or entities might be dramatically different. Generally speaking, using different sets of
images also means that we can never exclude the possibility that the underlying cause of the differences
between the descriptions lies with the images rather than the modality. However, as the sets of images
become more similar, chances of the images being a major source of the differences between the written
and spoken descriptions become smaller. So how big are the differences between existing datasets?

Table 1: Top-10 most frequent nouns for all three datasets.
Flickr30K and MS COCO are fairly similar (they have a
larger overlap), but Places differs from the other two.

To answer this question, we tagged the
descriptions in all three datasets using
the SpaCy part-of-speech tagger.7 Ta-
ble 1 shows the top-10 most frequent
nouns in all three datasets. These corre-
spond to the most frequent entities. We
observe that while the Flickr30K and
MS COCO datasets are fairly similar
(sharing 5 words in their top-10), the
Places dataset stands out from the other
two (sharing only 2 words). Thus, the
only spoken English descriptions that are
available, describe images that are fairly
different from the other datasets. Luck-
ily we have more comparable data for
Dutch.

4.2 Dutch Data

For the written sample, we use the data collected by van Miltenburg et al. (2017). The authors crowd-
sourced Dutch descriptions for the Flickr30K validation and test sets (1014 + 1000 images, with 5 de-
scriptions per image). The annotation task was translated from the Flickr30K and Multi30K templates
(Elliott et al., 2016), to stay as close to these datasets as possible. We only use the validation split for our
comparison, so that we remain ignorant of the properties of the test set.

For our spoken sample, we use data from a task that we carried out for another purpose, and that will
be published separately (van Miltenburg et al., 2018). 45 Dutch students participated in a lab experiment

where they were asked to describe a series of images, while we also measured their eye movements.
We used the 307 images from MS COCO that both appear in SALICON and the Visual Genome dataset
(Jiang et al., 2015; Krishna et al., 2016). We transcribed and annotated the recorded descriptions, so
that we ended up with three layers: (1) a raw layer; (2) an annotated layer indicating (filled) pauses,
corrections and repetitions; and (3) a normalized layer, with the ‘intended’ description. In total, we
collected 14-16 descriptions per image, resulting in a grand total of 4604 descriptions for the entire
dataset. This study uses the normalized descriptions, so that our metrics are unaffected by corrections
and repetitions, and we can focus more on the content of the descriptions.

4.3 Preprocessing, metrics, and hypotheses

We tokenize, tag, and parse the descriptions using SpaCy. Then, we compute the following metrics:
1. Average token length Drieman (1962a) and others have found that the tokens in spoken language are
shorter than those in written language. We measure token length in terms of syllables (following e.g.
Drieman 1962a) and characters (following e.g. Biber 1988), using Hunspell to obtain the syllables.8

2. Average description length Drieman (1962a) and others have shown that spoken language has a
higher sentence length than written language. We measure description length in tokens and syllables.
3. Mean-segmental type-token ratio (MSTTR) corresponds to the average number of types per 1000
tokens (Johnson, 1944). It is used as a measure of lexical variation. Because it is computed for a fixed
number of tokens, it is unaffected by corpus size or sentence length. Drieman (1962a) shows that written
language is more diverse than spoken language. One issue is that the Places Audio Caption Corpus has
only one description per image, versus five descriptions per image for MS COCO and Flickr30K. This
means that for every description in Flickr30K or MS COCO, there are four very similar descriptions,
which makes these corpora less diverse overall. For a fair comparison, we treat Flickr30K and MS
COCO as collections of five similar corpora, compute MSTTR for each of these, and report the average.
4. Attributive adjectives Drieman shows that spoken language contains fewer attributive adjectives
than written language. We use SpaCy’s tagger and parser to determine if an adjective is attributive or
not. We consider a token to be an attributive adjective if its part-of-speech tag is ADJ, and it has an
amod dependency relation with a head that is either tagged as NOUN or PROPN. In other words: if it’s an
adjective modifying a noun.
5. Adverbs We count all tokens with the ADV part-of-speech tag. The literature shows mixed results for
the use of adverbs: Harrell (1957) studied children’s production of stories, and found fewer adverbs in
spoken than in written language, while Chafe and Danielewicz (1987) show that adverbs are used more in
conversation and letters, and less in lectures and academic writing. They explain this pattern by arguing
that the key variable is not modality but involvement. Whenever people are more involved with their
audience or their environment, they also tend to use more locative or temporal adverbials. And whenever
they are more detached (talking about more abstract ideas), they tend to use fewer adverbs.
6. Prepositions Chafe and Danielewicz (1987) show that prepositions are used more in (academic) writ-
ten language. We count all tokens with the ADP part-of-speech tag.
The metrics below are computed by matching the tokenized descriptions with different sets of words.
7. Consciousness-of-projection terms DeVito (1966) defines these as: “words which indicate that the
observed is in part a function of the observer.” He shows that these words are more frequently used in
speech than in writing. Since DeVito does not provide a list of the terms used in his work, we compiled
our own list containing the following words: apparently, appear, appears, certainly, clearly, definitely,
likely, may, maybe, might, obviously, perhaps, possibly, presumably, probably, seem, seemed, seemingly,
seems, surely. The consciousness-of-projection terms contain Biber’s (1988) set of possibility modals
and seem and appear.
8. Self-reference terms DeVito (1966) also shows that self-reference terms (first-person pronouns and
phrases like the author) are used more in spoken than in written language. We only use I, me, my as
self-reference terms, since phrases like the author are not relevant in this domain.

for more details. We use the Pyphen library (https:/github.com/Kozea/Pyphen) as an interface.

Negations Geen, niet, niemand, nergens, noch, nooit, niets
Pseudo-quantifiers Veel, vele, weinig, enkele, een paar, een hoop, grote hoeveelheid, kleine hoeveelheid

Table 2: Dutch terms that were used for each feature.

9. Positive allness terms DeVito (1966) shows that spoken language contains more ‘allness terms’ than
written language. For DeVito, these include both positive (all, every, always) and negative (none, never)
terms. Following more recent work, which also focuses explicitly on negations, we decided to distinguish
between the two. As positive allness terms, we use the words all, each and every.
10. Negations Biber et al. (1999, Chapter 3) show that spoken language contains more negations than
written language. For the negative allness terms, we focus on explicit, non-affixal negations: n’t, neither,
never, no, nobody, none, nor, not, nothing, nowhere. (Using the terminology from Tottie (1980).)
11. Pseudo-quantifiers While DeVito (1966) did not find any significant differences in the use of exact
numerals, between spoken and written language, he did find such differences in the usage of terms like
many, that are “loosely indicative of amount or size.” We use the following terms: few, lots, many, much,
plenty, some and a lot.

Table 2 shows the Dutch terms used for each feature. For all features except average token length,
average description length, and MSTTR, we report the average number of occurrences per description,
and per 1000 tokens. We also compute the Propositional Idea Density (PID) for the spoken and written
descriptions. PID corresponds to the average number of propositional ideas per word in a text (Turner
and Greene, 1977). According to Turner and Greene’s annotation scheme, sentence (1a) breaks down
into the five ideas expressed in (1b).9 Because the nine words in (1a) express five ideas, the PID for this
sentence is 5/9 = 0.56.

(1) a. The old gray mare has a very large nose

b. HAS(MARE, NOSE), OLD(MARE), GRAY(MARE), LARGE(NOSE), VERY(LARGE)(NOSE)

We expect that written language has a higher PID than spoken language. In other words: that spoken
language uses more words to convey the same amount of information. This hypothesis is based on the
idea that written language is edited or condensed to convey as much information as possible. For exam-
ple, Chafe and Danielewicz (1987) show that nominalizations (e.g. categorization, development) occur
more often in written language. They argue that the spoken alternatives for nominalizations are often
much longer: several clauses instead of one. Another example comes from Ravid and Berman (2006),
who show that written narratives contain relatively more propositional content (“events, descriptions,
and interpretations”) and less ancillary content (“nonnovel, nonreferential, or nonnarrative”). Spoken
narratives are said contain more ancillary content for communicative purposes. We use existing tools to
measure idea density. For English, we use the Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rater (Brown et
al., 2008).10 For Dutch, we use the tool developed by Marckx (2017).

Because this is an exploratory study, we will only report descriptive statistics. These allow us to
formulate hypotheses about the differences between spoken versus written image descriptions. We can
test these hypotheses in a future study with spoken and written descriptions for the same images, collected
in the same controlled setting.

Corpus (spoken). For the top table, columns correspond to: number of descriptions, number of tokens,
average token length (in syllables), average description length (in syllables, in tokens), features 4-6 (per
description, per 1000 tokens). For the bottom table, columns correspond to the mean-segmental type-
token ratio, followed by features 7-11 (per description, per 1000 tokens).

5.1 English results

Table 3 shows the results for the English descriptions. We immediately see that, in line with the literature,
spoken image descriptions are almost twice as long as their written counterparts. With almost half the
number of descriptions of MS COCO, the Places dataset has significantly more tokens. Based on the
literature, we might also expect spoken descriptions to use shorter words than written descriptions. This
is indeed the case when we look at syllable length, but when we look at the number of characters, tokens
in the MS COCO dataset have a shorter average length. We conclude there is no clear difference in token
length between spoken and written image descriptions.

MSTTR. We next look at the richness of the vocabulary used by the crowd workers. Following
Drieman’s work, we expected that written descriptions would have a higher type-token ratio than spoken
descriptions. This expectation is not borne out by the data. The MSTTR score for the Places data falls
between the scores for MS COCO and Flickr30K. A possible explanation for this result is that spoken
language is typically produced without any preparation, which leads speakers to ‘fall back’ on a more
basic vocabulary. But with the Places dataset, participants could think of a description before they pressed
the ‘record’ button, alleviating cognitive constraints on language production.

Adjectives and prepositions. For the remaining fea-
tures, we report the average number of occurrences per de-
scription, as well as per 1000 tokens. Based on Drieman’s
work, we thought that attributive adjectives might occur
more in written descriptions, but when we look at Table 3,
we find a mixed result: spoken descriptions contain more
attributive adjectives per description, but fewer attributive
adjectives per 1000 tokens than the written descriptions in
the Flickr30K dataset. This is possible because the spoken
descriptions are longer than the written ones. We conclude
that there is no clear difference between written and spo-
ken descriptions in the use of attributive adjectives. We
draw the same conclusion for the use of prepositions.

Adverbs and other features. We observe that spoken
descriptions contain more adverbs than written ones; three
times more adverb tokens than MS COCO, and almost four

times more than Flickr30K. The same holds for consciousness-of-projection terms, self-reference terms,
positive allness terms, negations, and pseudo-quantifiers: all these kinds of terms are used more often in
spoken than in written image descriptions.

Propositional idea density. Figure 2 shows the distribution of Propositional Idea Density scores for
each of the three datasets, visualized using Kernel Density Estimation. We computed the PID scores
over 100 samples of 1000 descriptions for each dataset. We observe that the spoken descriptions have a
lower PID than both written datasets, confirming the hypothesis that spoken descriptions use more words
to convey the same amount of propositional information. Of course, the extra-propositional information
may be useful as well, e.g. to convey pragmatic messages. Future research should look into whether
users prefer the spoken or the written variant.

5.2 Dutch results

Table 4 shows the results for the Dutch descriptions. As with the English descriptions, we observe that
the spoken descriptions are longer than their written counterparts, albeit to a lesser extent. Whereas the
English spoken descriptions were almost twice as long as the written descriptions, the Dutch spoken
descriptions are only two tokens longer on average.

Token length and MSTTR. We do not find any major differences in terms of token length or mean-
segmental type-token ratios. The spoken descriptions are slightly less diverse, but not by a large margin.
Unlike the English spoken data, the participants for the Dutch spoken data did not have any time to pre-
pare, since the experiment immediately started recording as the picture was presented. We hypothesize
that the differences that Drieman found might have been due to the length of the spoken and written
samples, and that with a description spanning multiple sentences, speakers are perhaps more likely to
repeat themselves, leading to less diversity in their descriptions.11

Adjectives and prepositions. In contrast to the English descriptions, we do observe a difference in the
use of attributive adjectives between spoken and written descriptions. Written description contain slightly
more attributive adjectives per description (even though written descriptions are shorter on average), and
significantly more attributive adjectives per 1000 tokens. We also find that written descriptions contain
more prepositions than spoken descriptions. These findings are in line with Drieman’s original results.

Adverbs and other features. We find that spoken descriptions contain more than twice as many
adverbs than written descriptions, mirroring the results for English. And, just like in English, we find that
spoken descriptions also contain more negations, pseudo-quantifiers, and consciousness-of-projection,
self-reference, and allness terms.

Propositional idea density. We also computed the Propositional Idea Density for both written and
spoken descriptions, but we found little difference between the two: 0.44 for written descriptions ver-
sus 0.46 for their spoken counterparts. This is a far cry from the highly contrastive results we found
for English. We conclude that there is no clear difference for Dutch spoken and written descriptions,
though we should note that Marckx (2017) translated the rules to compute propositional idea density

11We did use normalized rather than raw spoken descriptions in our analysis, but the entire corpus of spoken Dutch descrip-
tions contains only 139 repetitions/false starts, which is unlikely to have a strong effect over 57K+ tokens.

from English to Dutch. It may be the case that the Dutch PID rater overlooked linguistic constructions
for communicating propositional ideas that only exist in Dutch.

5.3 Summary and discussion of our findings

Looking at the results for both Dutch and English, we have found that: (1) Spoken descriptions are likely
to be longer than written descriptions and, in English, seem to have a lower propositional information
density than written descriptions. (2) Spoken descriptions contain more adverbs than written descrip-
tions. (3) Spoken descriptions contain more pseudo-quantifiers and allness terms. (4) Speakers have a
bigger tendency to “show themselves” in their descriptions than writers, who are less involved (in the
sense of Chafe and Danielewicz 1987). We can see this in the use of more consciousness-of-projection
and self-reference terms. Akinnaso (1982) calls this egocentric language, indicating “that the observed
is in part a function of the observer” (p. 102). It has been shown that negations in image descriptions
often reflect the author’s expectations about the image they are describing (van Miltenburg et al., 2016).

Negative findings. Some of the ‘negative’ findings (where, unlike earlier work, we find no difference
between spoken and written language) may be explained in functionalist terms. For example, token
length may not be a function of spoken versus written language, but rather of register; abstract or formal
language tends to use longer words than concrete or informal language (Feng et al., 2011). Another
explanation comes from the fact that Drieman (1962a) used paintings as a stimuli, which also come
with a particular vocabulary, whereas MS COCO, Flickr30K, and the Places Audio Caption corpus use
real-life, everyday photographs, which may not elicit the same kind of expert language.12

Limitations. There are two main threats to the validity of this study. First, the English descriptions
from the Places Audio Caption Corpus have been automatically transcribed, with a 20% word error rate.
This means that there may be biases in which words are recognized from the audio and which are not.
McKoskey and Boley (2000) show that short words and function words are often confused by Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) systems with other function words, brief periods of silence, background
noise, or filled pauses. Fosler-Lussier and Morgan (1999) also show that infrequent words are less likely
to be recognized correctly. See Goldwater et al. (2010) for a survey and further analysis of ASR errors.

Second, for both comparisons (Dutch and English), the images differ between the spoken and the
written descriptions. The use of different images may have an effect on the length of the descriptions,
for example if one set of images is more complex, or contains more objects per image than another.
The length difference in English between spoken and written descriptions is much larger than in Dutch,
making the impressive average of 21 tokens per description looking more like a peculiarity of the Places
dataset, than a general property of spoken descriptions. Using different sets of images may also influence
the word distribution, though perhaps more in terms of content words, than in the way participants report
their observations. It seems to us that the use of self-reference terms, for example, should be relatively
independent from the contents of the images. Finally, this study is limited in scope. We have only
focused on descriptions in Dutch and English, two Germanic languages. It is an open question whether
the differences we have found also hold up in other languages.

6 Conclusion and future research

We performed an exploratory study to find differences between spoken and written image descriptions
in both Dutch and English. We found four main differences, summarized in the previous section. Where
should we go from here? We offer three directions to consider.

12Here is a written sample from Drieman’s study:

“A landscape with rushes —could be the Biesbos. The subject sounds charming, rural: fisherman near the edge
of the rushes, — open water, in the background trees and a churchtower. Yet, the impression made by the actual
painting is much less charming. There is a suggestion of movement among the rushes in the foreground and also
in the clouds — a movement from left to right — investing the calm subject with something ominous and troubled.
The bright patches in the sky, too, enhance this impression. Especially the bright horizon, on the right and beyond
the churchtower, recalls, by contrast with the dark patches, elsewhere, an atmosphere of thunder.”

Controlled replication. As Akinnaso (1982) notes, Drieman’s study carefully controlled for (1) the
topic of the descriptions; (2) the circumstances in which participants were asked to provide the descrip-
tions; and (3) participants’ background and level of linguistic knowledge. Changing any of these factors
between the written and spoken condition makes the resulting data less comparable. Because we used ex-
isting datasets, we were not able to control for these. Although we believe that our main findings should
hold up, the only way to know for sure is to carry out a follow-up study. The benefit of this exploratory
study is that we have compiled a freely available set of tools to analyze spoken versus written language,
and we have narrowed down the potential differences between spoken and written descriptions to four
main differences. We can now also begin to study how potential users feel about these differences.

Qualitative analysis. We have limited ourselves to a quantitative analysis of the differences between
spoken and written language. The key reason for this is that we do not have any parallel sets of spoken
and written descriptions for the same images. However, we would still like to emphasize the importance
of looking at individual images and individual descriptions in more detail, as manual inspection may
reveal interesting examples and phenomena that are glossed over by automated metrics.

What do users want? Having found differences between spoken and written language, we should now
ask ourselves: what kind of descriptions would users of image description technology prefer? Research
on this topic goes back to user studies of ALT-text on the internet. For example, Petrie et al. (2005)
asked a group of blind people about the type of content they would like to be described. They found
that there is no single answer to this question, because descriptions are context dependent. But generally
speaking, blind users like to know about objects, buildings, and people; activities; the use of color; the
purpose of the image; the emotion and atmosphere; and the location where the picture was taken. Gella
and Mitchell (2016) asked a panel of visually impaired users about automatic image captioning, and
also found that users want to hear about humor and emotional content (besides concrete, literal content).
While these studies are important for our understanding of the needs of blind users, they only focus
on what should be described, and not so much on how images should be described, which is still an
open question. Possibly the most interesting feature to explore in the context of this paper is the use
of subjective language. Furthermore, the datasets discussed in this paper all use pictures from Flickr,
or unspecified images from the web. But Gella and Mitchell found that blind users would also like to
have image description technology for personal, news, and social media images. It is unclear how these
should be described, and whether these kinds of images would elicit similar differences between spoken
and written descriptions.

There are many ways to describe an image. As Vedantam et al. (2015) show, we can collect 50
descriptions for an image and still find meaningful variation. But this variation is not random. By
manipulating the image description task, we can identify the different factors influencing the description
process. With this paper, we hope to have shown that modality is one of the factors causing descriptions
to diverge.
