Abstract
The study of language change through parallel
corpora can be advantageous for the analysis
of complex interactions between time, text do-
main and language. Often, those advantages
cannot be fully exploited due to the sparse
but high-dimensional nature of such histori-
cal data. To tackle this challenge, we intro-
duce ParHistVis: a novel, free, easy-to-use,
interactive visualization tool for parallel, mul-
tilingual, diachronic and synchronic linguistic
data. We illustrate the suitability of the com-
ponents of the tool based on a use case of word
order change in Romance wh-interrogatives.

1 Introduction

Historical linguistics has begun to work with par-
allel corpora, exploiting the advances in corpus
linguistics that facilitate the creation, linkage and
analysis of large data sets. For some discussions
as to the advantages of using parallel corpora see,
e.g., Wälchli (2009); Enrique-Arias (2013). As-
pects that stand out are: a) the direct comparabil-
ity of concrete examples across time periods; b)
the ease of analysis due to the known structure of
the base text which makes it possible to look se-
lectively at a small number of passages in which
relevant structures are likely to occur; c) the facil-
itation of analysis of languages for which the re-
searcher has no deep knowledge, based on the bet-
ter known languages. Despite these advantages, it
is challenging to use parallel corpora with state-of-
the-art statistical/learning methods, because such
data is often a) too sparse; b) but too large and
too high-dimensional for manual inspection; c) a
learning approach necessarily reduces the dimen-
sionality so that important aspects that could in
principle be gained from the use of parallel texts
are lost. For our study on word order and lan-
guage change in Romance wh-interrogatives, our

goal is to investigate the strict word order observed
in Old Romance (Kaiser, 1980; Schulze, 1888;
Lapesa, 1992) and the more flexible word order of
Modern Romance (Ordóñez, 1997; Rizzi, 2006),
based on a parallel corpus of French and Spanish
Bible translations of the 12th, 16th and 20th cen-
turies. In particular, it is of interest to determine
what factors might interact to determine word or-
der, e.g., particles or the type of interrogative pro-
noun (Bayer and Obenauer, 2011). However, the
relatively small size of our corpus for statistical
methods but large size for manual investigation of
the interacting factors and the unsuitability of ex-
isting visualizations for the inspection of parallel,
multilingual, diachronic texts pose a challenge.

To tackle this challenge, but also to assist
researchers with similar issues, we designed
ParHistVis (Parallel Multilingual Historical Visu-
alization). ParHistVis is a novel, freely-available,1

easy-to-use, interactive visualization tool for pa-
rallel, multilingual, diachronic and synchronic
data of a) the same time period across languages;
b) of different periods of the same language; c)
across languages. The tool employs methods of
the field of Visual Analytics (VA) (Keim et al.,
2008) and Computational Linguistics. It is suit-
able for researchers with little or no experience
with computational approaches: after defining an
input data file, they can directly interact with the
visualization. Thus, our contributions are two-
fold: first, we present an easy-to-use, freely avail-
able, interactive tool suitable for the visualization
of parallel multilingual data. Concretely, we show
what aspects of parallel data can be efficiently ex-
plored using streamgraphs and Sankey diagrams.
Second, we describe how the tool can be used via
a concrete use case: the investigation of word or-
der change in Romance wh-interrogatives.

2 Relevant Work

Visualization as a means of illustration has a long
tradition in linguistics, e.g., through spectograms
for sound waves, tables for paradigms or graphs
and attribute-value matrices for syntactic informa-
tion. Besides such traditionally established visu-
alizations, recent years have seen the emergence
of new visualization ideas coming out of the field
of VA (Keim et al., 2008) for the analysis and
representation of linguistic data (Sun et al., 2013;
Liu et al., 2014; Gan et al., 2014). A consider-
able amount of research has specifically focused
on the visualization of historical linguistic change.
One strand of research has focused on the visual-
ization of word meaning across time (Sagi et al.,
2009; Rohrdantz et al., 2011; Hilpert, 2011; Tah-
masebi and Risse, 2017; Jatowt et al., 2018), while
others have approached the same area with state-
of-the-art embeddings (see Kutuzov et al. (2018)
for a review). Another strand of research has
concentrated on visualizing diachronic informa-
tion in historical dictionaries, e.g., Theron and
Fontanillo (2015) and linguistic evolution within
the discourse (Lyding et al., 2012). Other work
has visualized syntactic historical change (Butt
et al., 2014; Schätzle et al., 2017; Schätzle, 2018).
This work situates itself in the middle of those ap-
proaches, attempting to present a general, easy-to-
use tool that can be employed for historical change
of any kind (syntactic, semantic, etc.), but particu-
larly targeting parallel, multilingual data.

3 The ParHistVis Tool

The tool works through a web-browser interface
and is fully implemented in JavaScript. The
only requirement is a tabulated file with the data
to be visualized. The file can contain parallel,
multilingual text, synchronic or diachronic, with
each aligned piece of text (across languages or
across time) associated with a row and identified

by a unique ID. The rows can contain different
columns, each of them encoding linguistic anno-
tations that the researcher has assigned to that spe-
cific piece of text/row. In what follows, we call
these linguistic annotations dimensions and their
possible subcategories features. These dimensions
can be specific to a particular language or time pe-
riod or be associated with the whole row, i.e. the
whole aligned text across languages and periods.
The loading of the file in the tool is easy and fast:
the researcher creates an online document of her
file, e.g., a Google Sheets Document, and feeds
its link in the provided field of the interface. This
connects the document with the tool and the visu-
alization instantly appears. This method is user-
friendly and avoids complex handling of the do-
cuments usually found in a server-client environ-
ment. An additional merit is that the user can up-
date the input document anytime and the changes
will be automatically reflected in the visualization.

3.1 Parallel Analysis of Linguistic Change

One simple but essential requirement for the effi-
cient study of parallel data is that the researcher
can indeed observe each data point in a parallel
way for each time period and, if multilingual data
is available, for each language. Although this is
possible with common tools like Excel, such a
large document can quickly become overwhelm-
ing. To facilitate the direct comparability that par-
allel corpora enable, our tool builds upon this ex-
isting metaphor of a matrix visualization, as such
a method preserves all dimensions of the data, in
contrast to others which use dimensionality reduc-
tion techniques and crucial information gets lost.
In this initial matrix view, the data follows the for-
mat of the input file but is structured in a color-
ful visualization: the languages and time periods
are on the horizontal axis, allowing for interlingual
and diachronic analysis of the data, and the course
of the corpus is on the vertical axis, allowing for



111

intralingual and synchronic comparisons (see Fig-
ure 1). Each time period of each language is as-
signed a different color. The user can choose to fil-
ter a subset of the data, i.e. the features she is inter-
ested in, by selecting the corresponding columns.
These columns will be automatically highlighted
and the rest of the dimensions will be blended out
to enable a more focused view on the data. In this
detailed view, the user can observe the data in a
qualitative way. For example, she can hover over
the ID of a row and get the specific text associated
with that ID, for each separate time period and lan-
guage. General trends concerning the whole cor-
pus can also be observed by zooming out on the
matrix, e.g., we could observe that the filtered fea-
tures appear only in the second half of the corpus
(on the vertical axis) or only in the later time peri-
ods (on the horizontal axis).

3.2 Aggregated View of Linguistic Change
Although the detailed matrix view is suitable for
inspecting individual data points, it does not fa-
cilitate general quantitative observations for the
whole corpus or another natural grouping of the
data. But these observations are of interest when
comparing the same text across time and lan-
guages. We therefore offer an aggregated matrix
view. Here, the user can select which data points
should be aggregated; the tool offers a standard ag-
gregation option but also makes educated guesses
for other natural groupings of the data. The stan-
dard option is the aggregation of all data points of
the whole corpus. Other aggregation options are
offered based on the unique IDs: the tool searches
for any reasonable pattern occurring in the IDs and
suggests this as a natural aggregation, e.g., IDs
with the same prefix will be aggregated to a group.
The aggregation function merges all values of each
feature of the subgroups contained in the aggrega-
tion and calculates their sum (Figure 1). Addition-
ally, a colormap encodes the frequency of the fea-
tures: the lighter the color of a given feature, the
lower its frequency across the aggregated dimen-
sion; the darker the color, the higher the frequency.

3.3 Streamgraphs for Pattern Recognition
The aggregated view is suitable for general quanti-
tative observations. Nevertheless, through the ag-
gregation the features of the categorical dimen-
sions are collapsed and thus interesting patterns
may disappear. Moreover, the summed aggre-
gated numerical dimensions can be overwhelming

French across the aggregated Bible books (bottom left).

when trying to identify patterns. To tackle these
drawbacks, the aggregated data is further visual-
ized through streamgraphs. A streamgraph (also
known as ThemeRiver) is a type of stacked area
graph displaced around a central axis, resulting
in a flowing, organic shape. Streamgraphs were
popularized by Byron and Wattenberg (2008) for
movie box office revenues but were already used
for topic modelling by Havre et al. (2002) and
have been applied to prosody visualization (Martin
et al., 2010). Streamgraphs are commonly used to
show changes of different categories across a sin-
gle dimension, e.g., time, where categories might
appear or disappear at different times. The height
of each individual stream shows how its value has
changed over time and the length shows its dura-
tion. This allows a comparison of the width of in-
dividual features visually, highlighting trends and
outliers. Colours are used to differentiate between
categories. Such high-dimensional data could also
be represented by Parallel Coordinates (Inselberg,
1985), if time and space were considered “sim-
ple” quantifiable dimensions. However, as high-
lighted by Kehrer and Hauser (2013), the indepen-
dent dimensions of time and space tend to play
a central role in spatio-temporal data and should
thus be considered independently. The properties
of streamgraphs are thus suitable for parallel his-

tween particles and interrogative pronouns.

torical data. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply streamgraphs to paral-
lel, multilingual historical data. In ParHistVis, for
a selected dimension, two streamgraphs are dis-
played: a) one for the frequency of the features of
this dimension over the aggregated dimension for
the specified time period (Figure 2, bottom left)
and b) one for the frequency of the features of the
dimension over the time periods, if this feature ex-
ists in a diachronic scale (Figure 2, top right). By
hovering over a stream, the exact frequency of the
feature visualized is displayed.

3.4 Sankey Diagrams for Pattern Interaction

Although streamgraphs offer a useful at-a-glance
overview of the frequency of the dimensions, they
cannot provide any insight into potential interac-
tions between them. However, in the study of lan-
guage change it is crucial to be able to discover
such interactions, as most changes are the out-
come of a series of interacting factors. Specifi-
cally, in parallel data there is a need for compar-
ing how a concrete interaction has behaved across
time or language. We make this kind of visualiza-
tion available by incorporating Sankey Diagrams.
These diagrams are traditionally used for visual-
izing (energy) flows; the entities under investiga-
tion are represented as nodes. The links among
them are represented with edges with a width pro-
portional to the importance of the flow. The dia-
grams have already gained attention in the digital
humanities, e.g., in the visualization of migration
flows and evolution (Abel, 2018), but also in lit-
erature (e.g., Campbell et al. (2018)). Here, the
user selects the dimensions for which she wants
to observe potential interactions. The features of
these dimensions are depicted as nodes and the in-
teractions between them as flows connecting them;
the thickness of the flow shows the extent of the
correlation. Again, a colormap helps the user dis-
tinguish between the interacting dimensions. An

example of a Sankey Diagram is shown in Figure
3. The tool does not make predictions about po-
tential interactions to display but lets the user de-
fine themselves the dimensions which might show
an interesting interaction. This is especially use-
ful for historical data where the data might be
too sparse for the tool to be able to find any sta-
tistically interesting interactions but the user still
wants to observe preliminary patterns and tenden-
cies.

4 Use case

The visualizations above were obtained as part
of our study on Romance wh-interrogatives. We
used a subset of the parallel, multilingual corpus
made available by Kalouli et al. (2018). This sub-
corpus contains three French and three Spanish
Bible translations of the 12th, 16th and 20th cen-
turies. We semi-automatically annotated this cor-
pus for a) word order in interrogatives, b) inter-
rogative pronouns and verbs of speaking introduc-
ing questions and c) particles used with interrog-
atives. The ultimate goal was to investigate the
differences between the strict word order in Old
Romance vs. the greater word order variation in
Modern Romance, in correlation with interroga-
tive pronouns, the introducing verbs of the inter-
rogatives and particles. (Old and Modern) Ro-
mance languages are characterized by a relatively
high stability with respect to word order in wh-
interrogatives. They generally exhibit the fronting
of the wh-phrase (wh-ex-situ) in combination with
subject-verb inversion (whVS), so there is a strict
adjacency between the wh-phrase and the verb. In
Modern Romance, however, there is some varia-
tion with respect to these word order constraints.
Many Modern Romance languages exhibit, mostly
under very specific conditions, wh-ex-situ inter-
rogatives without subject-verb inversion and allow
for non-adjacency of the wh-element and the verb
with certain elements. With this high-dimensional
research question we are interested in a linguis-
tic development within one language, as well as
across different languages and time periods, with
various interacting factors. ParHistVis can ideally
assist us: although a detailed linguistic analysis
is beyond the scope of this paper, we can show
how the different views facilitate the study of this
kind of data. With the color encoding in the ma-
trix view in Figure 1, we can already make at-
a-glance observations, e.g., there is a relatively



113

high number of interrogative pronouns in the be-
ginning and the end of the corpus.2 By using the
streamgraph visualization (Figure 2) we can ex-
actly inspect two phenomena attested in the litera-
ture: the emergence of complex inversion in Mod-
ern French (Roberts, 1993), i.e. the orange stream
(whSNPVSCl) first appears in Middle French and
increases its frequency in Modern French, and the
diachronic non-adjacency of the wh-element and
the verb when a particle is present, i.e. the blue
(whPtcVS) stream stays stable over time. The vi-
sualization with the Sankey Diagram also offers
interesting insights: arguably, some interrogative
pronouns allow for more variation in the sentence
structure, e.g. allow for particles (cf. e.g. Ordóñez
(1997)). If we select to view the interaction of the
interrogative pronouns and the particles in Mid-
dle Spanish and Modern French, Figure 3 shows
us that the interrogative pronoun why allows for
more frequent use of the particle pues and donc in
Spanish and French, respectively, than other pro-
nouns. Through the streamgraphs and Sankey Di-
agrams, similar observations can be made for other
dimensions of the dataset. More importantly, the
different available views allow the user to switch
between them and inspect patterns that arise from
these higher-level graphs. With this, the researcher
can recognize and evaluate patterns in an other-
wise too multifactorial dataset.

5 Conclusion

We presented ParHistVis, a visualization tool for
parallel, multilingual, synchronic and diachronic
linguistic data. We showed how the different
views of the tool facilitate the inspection of the
data, based on our study on word order change in
Romance wh-interrogatives.
