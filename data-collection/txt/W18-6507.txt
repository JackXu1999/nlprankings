Abstract

In this paper, we describe SimpleNLG-
GL, an adaptation of the linguistic real-
isation SimpleNLG library for the Gali-
cian language. This implementation is de-
rived from SimpleNLG-ES, the English-
Spanish version of this library. It has been
tested using a battery of examples which
covers the most common rules for Gali-
cian.

1 Introduction

Realisation is the final task in natural language
generation. Its goal is to ensure that well-formed
texts are generated according to the grammar rules
of the output language. Consequently, having
tools that facilitate this task is desirable for any de-
veloper of a NLG system. For instance, templates
are a widely-used realisation mechanism which is
appropriate for many application domains, where
generated texts are rather static.

Templates, however, are harder to maintain as
they grow, and ensuring consistency among the el-
ements of a realised template might become more
difficult as more dynamic components appear. To
address this kind of issues, other realisation tools
pack language rules and syntactic structures to
provide a framework for building well-formed
sentences. This is the case of SimpleNLG, a Java
realiser for English presented in (Gatt and Reiter,
2009) to facilitate realisation tasks. Some versions
of this library have been created to support dif-
ferent languages: English-French (Vaudry and La-
palme, 2013), Italian (Mazzei et al., 2016), Brazil-
ian Portuguese (de Oliveira and Sripada, 2014),
German (Bollmann, 2011) and English-Spanish
(Ramos-Soto et al., 2017). Other realisers de-
scribed in the literature are Alethgen (Coch, 1996),
FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996), Real-

Pro (Lavoie and Rainbow, 1997), KPML (Bate-
man, 1997), YAG (McRoy et al., 2000), HALogen
(Langkilde-Geary, 2002) and OpenCCG (White,
2006).

This paper describes SimpleNLG-GL, a trilin-
gual realisation tool for English, Spanish and Gali-
cian, derived from SimpleNLG-ES (Ramos-Soto
et al., 2017). The Galician language is mainly
spoken by approximately a million people in Gali-
cia, NW of Spain. It is also closely related to the
Portuguese language, since until the Middle Ages
both were a single linguistic unit.

Given the closeness of Spanish and Galician, we
decided to base this adaptation of SimpleNLG on
the dual English-Spanish version. Nevertheless,
Galician has a rich variety of specific features that
clearly demanded a new adaptation of the library.
Thus, we will also show some examples of the
necessary steps to translate a phrase from Spanish
to Galician, in order to illustrate the higher com-
plexity that the Galician language has with respect
to Spanish, and how this influenced our implemen-
tation of SimpleNLG-GL.

2 Covered subset of Galician

The Galician grammar used as reference is
“Normas ortográficas e morfolóxicas do idioma
galego” (Galega, 2012), which was created by the
Real Academia Galega (Royal Galician Language
Academy, founded 1906), a scientific institution
whose objective is studying the Galician culture
and, in particular, its language. This grammar was
created to define the orthographic and morpholog-
ical rules of the Galician language.

2.1 Lexicon
To create the lexicon used to develop this ver-
sion of SimpleNLG, we chose the Galician dic-
tionary provided by the FreeLing Project (Padró
and Stanilovsky, 2012), an open source language



68

analysis tool suite which provides some language
analysis capabilities for a wide range of languages.
This dictionary cannot be used directly by Sim-
pleNLG, so we produced a compatible XML dic-
tionary generated from the original file.

3 Features of the Galician language

In this section, we describe the most interesting
features of the Galician language covered by the li-
brary, including syntax, orthography and morphol-
ogy.

3.1 Syntax
3.1.1 Noun phrases
The structure of noun phrases is composed by a
determiner, zero or one possessive, a noun and op-
tionally one or more adjectives. When a phrase
contains a possessive, in most cases it also in-
cludes a determiner (before). For instance, “o
meu fogar” is translated as “my home” when “o”
means “the”, “meu” means “my” (masculine)
and “fogar” means “home”. Therefore, the lit-
eral translation is “the my home”. In a phrase
with adjectives, the meaning of the phrase can
slightly change depending on where the adjectives
are placed (before or after the noun). Adjectives
after the noun refer to features which were pre-
viously unknown by the speaker. However, if the
adjective goes before the noun, the referred feature
was already known. For instance, “o novo fogar”
or ”o fogar novo” mean “the new home”. To say
“his new home” we can express it as “o seu novo
fogar” or “o seu fogar novo”.

A specific feature when noun phrases are used
as indirect objects is that a preposition “a”, which
means “to”, is utilised before the phrase and a
contraction is generated formed by that preposi-
tion and the phrase’s determiner if applicable. For
instance, “Eu vin a Victoria” means “I saw Victo-
ria”. An example with contraction is “Eu vin ao
teu gato”, translated as “I saw your (male) cat”
when the preposition “a” and the masculine deter-
miner “o” are contracted forming “ao”. Other ex-
ample, with a feminine noun is Eu vin á túa gata”
which means “I saw your cat (female)”.

3.1.2 Verb phrases
A general structure of verb phrases is composed by
a subject, a verb and zero or more objects. How-
ever, in Galician there are sentences without a sub-
ject using the verb “haber” in its third person sin-
gular conjugation in the simple tense form “hai”,

Figure 1: Steps to translate from Spanish to Gali-
cian language.

which means “there is/are”. For instance “there
is a cat on the tree” would be expressed as “hai
un gato na árbore”. Similarly, passive sentences
are created adding the reflexive pronoun “se” con-
nected to the verb and after it. For instance “the
event was cancelled” can be expressed as “can-
celouse o evento” (Figure 1).

A feature of the Galician language is the pro-
noun placement in relation to the verb when it is
used as a direct or indirect object, either before
or after the verb, appearing both combined in the
latter case. This collocation depends on the sen-
tence type, e.g., the pronoun is generally placed
after the verb in affirmative sentences, whereas it
is placed before it in negative sentences. For in-
stance, “el deume un regalo” is translated as “he
gave me a present”. In this case the verb is “deu”
(“gave”) and the pronoun is “me”, which is com-
bined with the verb. In a negative sentence, “el
non me deu un regalo” translated as “he did not
give me a present”, an the pronoun appears sepa-
rately before the verb. To handle this feature, the
library has to perform the following three tasks:

• Analyse the phrase type. The general rule is
that pronouns are placed after the verb, how-
ever, we must analyse the phrase to deter-
mine its position. Some words change the
verb’s position as negation adverbs (“non o
vin” which means “I did not see it”), doubt
adverbs (“quizais ela te chame mañá” trans-
lated as “maybe she calls you tomorrow”),
interrogative pronouns (“que che pasou?”
which means “what happened to you?”).

• Split the verb into syllables. Adding the pro-
noun to the verb, its accentuation can change
and an accent mark has to be added or moved
if the verb has it. Therefore, we need to anal-
yse the verb to find out its category according
to where its strong syllable is. For instance,



69

Figure 2: Steps to translate from Spanish to Gali-
cian language.

the form “entendo”, the first person singular
conjugation in the present simple tense form
of the verb “understand”, is split as “en-ten-
do”.

• Accentuation. Once we know the verb’s cat-
egory, the last step is to concatenate the pro-
noun to the verb and to check the new word’s
accentuation, adding, moving or removing an
accent mark. For instance, the first person
singular conjugation in the past simple tense
form “dixen” of the verb “dicir” (“say”)
has the stress on its first syllable. If we add
the pronoun “lle” expressed as “to him”,
“to her” or “to it”, the composed word is
‘dı́xenlle‘. If we add the contraction of pro-
nouns (Table 6) “llelo”, composed by the
pronoun “lles”, which means “to them”, and
the pronoun “o”, which means “it”, the com-
posed word is “dı́xenllelo” (Figure 2). The
stress of the new words in these examples is
also their first syllable. However, due to the
Galician orthography rules, an accent mark
(which is not present in the original word) has
to be put on these first syllables.

More details about pronoun concatenation are
given in Section 3.3.3.

3.1.3 Interrogative phrases
Interrogative phrases can be formed in many ways
by simply adding the punctuation mark at the end
of the sentence. For example, “tes frı́o” that
means “you are cold” can be transformed into a
question simply adding the punctuation mark “tes
frı́o?” that means “are you cold?”.

When the interrogative pronouns “what” and
“who” have the role of indirect objects, the prepo-

sition “a” is inserted in the beginning of the ques-
tion. For instance, “a quen chamaches?” can be
expressed as “who did you call?”.

3.2 Orthography

General Galician orthography rules (e.g. punctua-
tion, capital letters at the beginning of sentences...)
are like English and Spanish ones. This means that
SimpleNLG already has them implemented.

As we mentioned before, Galician has special
rules for word categorisation regarding their stress
syllables. Besides, some words have accent marks
on one vowel to stress the strong syllable. The en-
tries in the lexicon we use contain accents accord-
ing to the Galician orthography rules. However, it
does not contain generated words formed by con-
tractions, so we implemented the corresponding
accentuation rules to handle these cases.

3.3 Morphology

3.3.1 Gender and number

Determiners, nouns and adjectives have to be in-
flected in gender and number. Our lexicon pro-
vides the base form of a word but not its gender
and number variations so we had to implement
some rules to generate them when they are regular.

3.3.2 Verb tenses

Verbs can be regular or irregular. We implemented
some rules to generate regular forms, whereas the
irregular ones are provided by the lexicon.

3.3.3 Morphophonology

Galician is a very rich language in terms of its
morphophonology rules. SimpleNLG-GL imple-
ments the contractions that exist between prepo-
sitions and articles, and also between pronouns
when they function as direct and indirect objects.

Prepositions and articles: The prepositions
shown in Table 1 can contract with definite arti-
cles, “o”, “a”, “os”, “as” which mean “the”, for
instance “o gato” means “the cat”; and also in-
definite articles, “un”, “unha”, “uns”, “unhas”
which mean “a”, for instance, “un gato” means
“a cat”. These contractions have the following
meanings:

• “a + definite article” means “to the”
whereas “a + indefinite article” means “to
a”

• “de + definite article” means “of the”
whereas “de + indefinite article” means “of

• “en + definite article” means “in the”
whereas “en + indefinite article” means “in

• “por + definite article” can mean “by the”
whereas “por + indefinite article” can mean
“by a”

• “tras + definite article” can mean “after the”
whereas “tras + indefinite article” can “after
a”

In Tables 2 and 3 the contractions are shown.
Pronouns: The atonic pronouns having the role

of indirect objects shown in Table 4 can also con-
tract with others which have the role of direct ob-
jects which are shown in Table 5. For instance, the
phrase “El deumo” (Figure 3) is expressed as “He
gave it to me”, where “deu” means “gave” and

4 Availability, test and documentation

SimpleNLG-GL is available and fully download-
able at (Cascallar-Fuentes et al., 2018)

The documentation from SimpleNLG-ES has
also been adapted to this version, and is also avail-
able at the library repository in the form of a wiki,
as usual in SimpleNLG, which contains a tutorial
with some examples.

SimpleNLG-GL has been tested using 180 unit
tests adapted from SimpleNLG-ES. New tests
have been generated to cover Galician language
features not present in the Spanish language. We

Table 6: Contractions between atonic pronouns

had to create new tests to cover the Galician lan-
guage features previously described. For instance,
we created 11 tests to cover contractions between
all prepositions and articles, 4 tests to cover atonic
pronouns collocation and 7 tests to cover contrac-
tions between atonic pronouns. Also, in some of
the adapted tests from the Spanish version these
features are present as well.

Besides, SimpleNLG-GL has been used in the
real data-to-text service GALiWeather (Ramos-
Soto et al., 2015), which generates daily weather
forecasts for the Galician municipalities in the
Website of the Galician Meteorological Agency
(Agency). This service combines a template-based
approach with the use of SimpleNLG-GL to gen-
erate correct sentences, in terms of the agreement
between the elements of the phrase (for example,
for choosing correct verb conjugations and ensur-
ing gender and number coherence, among others).

5 Conclusions

We have described SimpleNLG-GL, an adapta-
tion of the SimpleNLG Java realisation engine
for Galician language, that provides a sophisti-
cated covering of even the most complex rules
found in this language. This library has been
tested extensively using unit tests, 180 adapted
from SimpleNLG-ES testing, whilst other 22 were
newly developed for SimpleNLG-GL.
