1 Abstract

In this talk I will first describe some techniques
for projecting syntactic information across lan-
guage boundaries, allowing us to build models for
languages with no labeled training data. I will
then present some ongoing work towards a univer-
sal representation of morphology and syntax that
makes it possible to model language phenomena
across language boundaries in a consistent way.
Finally, I will highlight some examples of how
we have successfully used syntax at Google to im-
prove downstream applications like question an-
swering and machine translation.

Slav Petrov is a researcher in Google’s New York
office, leading a team that works on syntactic pars-
ing and its applications to information extraction,
question answering and machine translation. He
holds a PhD degree from UC Berkeley, where he
worked with Dan Klein. Before that he completed
a Master’s degree at the Free University of Berlin
and was a member of the FU-Fighters team that
won the RoboCup world championship in 2004.
His work on fast and accurate multilingual syntac-
tic analysis has been recognized with best paper
awards at ACL 2011 and NAACL 2012. Slav also
teaches Statistical Natural Language Processing at
New York University.
