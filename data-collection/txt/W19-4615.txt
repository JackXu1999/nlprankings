Abstract

We present a collection of morphologi-
cally annotated corpora for seven Arabic
dialects: Taizi Yemeni, Sanaani Yemeni,
Najdi, Jordanian, Syrian, Iraqi and Moroc-
can Arabic. The corpora collectively cover
over 200,000 words, and are all manually
annotated in a common set of standards
for orthography, diacritized lemmas, to-
kenization, morphological units and En-
glish glosses. These corpora will be pub-
licly available to serve as benchmarks for
training and evaluating systems for Arabic
dialect morphological analysis and disam-
biguation.

1 Introduction

As Arabic dialects (DA) become more widely
written in social media, there is increased interest
in the Arabic NLP community to have annotated
corpora that will allow us to both study the dialects
linguistically, and to create systems that can auto-
matically process dialectal text. There have been
important efforts to create relatively large corpora
for Egyptian (Maamouri et al., 2014), Palestinian
(Jarrar et al., 2014), and Emirati Arabic (Khal-
ifa et al., 2018). While these resources are very
helpful for single dialects, the problem is that
there are many dialects, and in fact it is often un-
clear what to count as separate dialects (for exam-
ple, the subdialects of Levantine). Therefore, we
present a different approach in this paper: we an-
notate seven dialects, but with relatively smaller
corpora (most around 30,000 words). Some of
the dialects are closely related (Jordanian and Syr-
ian), others are more distant (Moroccan). We use
the same annotation methodology for all dialects:
same guidelines, same processing steps, and same
annotation file format. This makes our effort an

ideal starting point for experimenting with using
multidialectal resources to create and train NLP
tools. The dialects we consider are Taizi Yemeni
(YE.TZ)1, Sanaani Yemeni (YE.SN), Saudi Na-
jdi (SA.NJ), Jordanian (JOR), Syrian Damascene
(SY.DM), Iraqi Baghdadi (IR.BG), and Moroccan
Rabati (MA.RB) Arabic.

The paper is structured as follows. We start with
a review of relevant literature (Section 2). We then
summarize some linguistic facts about DA in gen-
eral (Section 3) and subsequently present each of
our seven dialects in Section 4, summarizing the
corpora used and some interesting facts specific to
each dialect. Section 5 then presents our annota-
tion methodology. We then briefly discuss mor-
phological analyzers, and conclude.

2 Related Work

Data Collections There have been several data
collections centered on Arabic dialects, specifi-
cally spoken Arabic. A very useful resource is the
Semitisches Tonarchiv at the University of Heidel-
berg in Germany.2 We have included two Yemeni
transcriptions from this resource in our YE.TZ and
YE.SN corpora. Khalifa et al. (2016) is a large col-
lection of over 100M words of a number of Ara-
bic dialect, although the majority is from the Gulf.
Bouamor et al. (2018) created a large corpus with
parallel data text from 25 Arab cities. Further data
collections include (Al-Amri, 2000) which has not
yet been digitized for use in NLP research.

Annotated Corpora There are few annotated
corpora for dialectal Arabic: the Levantine Ara-
bic Treebank (specifically Jordanian) (Maamouri
et al., 2006), the Egyptian Arabic Treebank
(Maamouri et al., 2014), Curras, the Pales-

name and the city or region name when applicable.

tinian Arabic annotated corpus (Jarrar et al.,
2014), the Gulf Arabic Annotated corpus (Khalifa
et al., 2018), Syrian, Jordanian dialectal corpora
(Bouamor et al., 2014; Harrat et al., 2014), a small
effort on Sanaani and Moroccan (AlShargi et al.,
2016) (which this paper builds on), and SUAR
(Al-Twairesh et al., 2018), a morphologically an-
notated corpus for Najdi and Hijazi which is semi-
automatically annotated using the MADAMIRA
tool (Pasha et al., 2014) and subsequently man-
ually checked. Additionally, Voss et al. (2014)
present a corpus of Moroccan dialect which has
been annotated for language variety (code switch-
ing). Several of these efforts have followed the ap-
proach of Curras (Jarrar et al., 2014), which con-
sists of around 70,000 words of a balanced genre
corpus. The corpus was manually annotated using
the DIWAN tool (Alshargi and Rambow, 2015),
which we also use. The annotation in Curras is
done by first using a morphological tagger for an-
other Arabic dialect, namely MADAMIRA Egyp-
tian (Pasha et al., 2014), to produce a base that was
then corrected or accepted by a trained annotator.

Other NLP Resources for Dialectal Arabic
The effort to annotate corpora in context is a cen-
tral step in developing morphological analyzers
and taggers (Eskander et al., 2013; Habash et al.,
2013). However, other notable approaches and
efforts that do not use annotated corpora have
focused on developing specific resources manu-
ally or semi-automatically, e.g., the Egyptian Ara-
bic morphological analyzer (Habash et al., 2012b)
which is built upon the Egyptian Colloquial Ara-
bic Lexicon (Kilany et al., 2002), the multi-
dialectal dictionary Tharwa (Diab et al., 2014), or
extending MSA analyzers and resources (Salloum
and Habash, 2014; Harrat et al., 2014; Boujelbane
et al., 2013).

Linguistic Studies There are many theoretical
and descriptive linguistic studies for the dialects
we work on: Yemeni dialects (Watson, 1993,
2002), Najdi (Ingham, 1994), Gulf Arabic dialect
(Holes, 1990), Jordanian (Bani-Yasin and Owens,
1987), Moroccan (Harrell, 1962), Syrian (Cow-
ell, 1964), and Iraqi (Erwin, 1963); not to men-
tions comparative studies across dialects and MSA
(Holes, 2004; Brustad, 2000). We make extensive
use of such studies as part of the design of our an-
notation guidelines.

3 Dialects: Linguistic Facts

In this section we present some general facts and
phenomena shared across different dialects. In
subsequent subsections, we present our dialects
in more detail and commenting on the corpus
sources.

Dialects and MSA Arabic dialects share many
commonalities with Classical Arabic and Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA). All variants of Ara-
bic are morphologically complex as they include
rich inflectional and derivational morphology that
is expressed in two ways: namely, via templates
and affixes. Furthermore, they contain several
classes of attachable clitics. However, the dialects
as a class differ in consistent ways from MSA,
and they differ amongst each other. In fact, the
differences between MSA and Dialectal Arabic
(DA) have often been compared to those between
Latin and the Romance languages (Chiang et al.,
2006). The principal morpho-syntactic difference
between DA and MSA is the loss of productive
case marking, and nunation (tanween) on nouns,
and mood on imperfective verbs.

Dialectal Variations Differences among the di-
alects are found on all levels of linguistic descrip-
tion, i.e., phonology, morphology, syntax, and the
lexicon. We summarize three phonological and
three morphological salient examples in Table 1
for our dialects: the pronunciation of MSA /q/
written � q,3 MSA /Ã/ written h. j and MSA /k/
written ¼ k; and the various forms of the future,
progressive and possessive particles.

From a lexical point of view, there are many
words that have different meanings across dialects.
For example, the word ú



æ
�
AÓ mA$y /ma:Si/ is ‘no’

in YE.SN and MA.RB, ‘yes/ok’ in SY.DM and
JOR, and ‘walking’ in SA.NJ. Another exam-
ple is the word ú




	
¯A SAfy /sQa:fi/ which means

‘enough’ in MA.RB, but ‘pure’ in the other di-
alects and MSA. Some cases show subtle dif-
ferences in meaning, e.g., Ð@Y 	g xdAm /xadda:m/
means ‘employee’ generically in MA.RB, but it
has a more specific and negative connotation in
YE.TZ and YE.SN, namely ‘enslaved servant’.
While the above cases are all homonyms (homo-
phones and homographs), there are instances of

Buckwalter transliteration (in italics) (Habash et al., 2007).
When needed, we present the IPA (in /.../). The English gloss
is added in single quotes.

homophones that have different meanings in dif-
ferent dialects. For example the utterance /fagr/
can mean ‘morning’ in YE.TZ (written as Qm.

‘poverty in YE.SN (written as Q�® 	¯ fqr). The YE.SN
pronunciation of Qm.

	
¯ fjr is /faZr/; and the YE.TZ pro-

nunciation of Q�® 	¯ fqr is /faqr/.

There are also cases of the same meaning be-
ing expressed in different ways, e.g., ‘spoon’ is

®ªÊÓ mlEqp in MSA, metathesized �é�®ÊªÓ mElqp in

JOR and SY.DM, and �é�¯ñ �A 	g xA$wqp in IR.BG.

Dialectal Orthography Since Arabic dialects
do not have spelling standards, several previous
efforts on Arabic dialect annotations (Maamouri
et al., 2014; Jarrar et al., 2014; Khalifa et al., 2018)
contributed to a movement that lead to the cre-
ation of a common Conventional Orthography for
Dialectal Arabic (CODA) (Habash et al., 2012a;
Zribi et al., 2014; Habash et al., 2018). We also
follow this approach to map from any spontaneous
orthography in our data to CODA. The spirit of
CODA is to define a common and consistent ap-
proach to spelling DA words that acknowledges
their etymological and historical relationship with
MSA and CA, but also maintains their uniqueness
and independence. For example, if a DA word has
an MSA cognate containing � q, then its CODA
spelling will use � q even if the dialectal pronun-
ciation is different. In contrast, DA morphemes
are spelled in a way to reflect their DA unique-
ness. For example the SY.DM word �J


	
®

	
Jk Hnfyq

/èanfi:P/ ‘we will wake up’ is a cognate of MSA
�

J

	
®

	
J snfyq /sanafi:qu/: the future marker reflects

the dialectal morphology and is not spelled as in
MSA, but the stem is spelled as in MSA and thus
the � q does not reflect the dialectal pronunciation.

4 Dialect-Specific Corpora

Until recently, Arabic was mostly written in Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Classical Arabic,
while written DA was rare. One early source of
written dialectal Arabic are textbooks for learning
an Arabic Dialect intended for non-Arabic speak-
ers. Furthermore, sometimes spoken language has
been recorded and transcribed. However, owing
to the advent of the internet and its rapid growth
among Arabic speaking populations, written ma-
terials in DA are now more accessible and easy
to obtain than they were in the past. These writ-
ten materials are typically informal written con-
versations among participant or traditional folk lit-
erature like short stories, poems, prose, thoughts
and song. These texts can be found in online fo-
rums, blogs, and postings on social media net-
works. All of the our dialectal corpora consist of
sources of various genres, collected from both on-
line and print materials in order to cover many of
the aspects of these dialects. Each of the YE.TZ,
SA.NJ, IR.BG, JOR corpora has 30K words, while
the YE.SN has 32K words, SY.DM has 35k words
and MA.RB has 20k words. It should be noted
that the data collected from the internet was writ-
ten in Arabic characters, using “spontaneous” or-
thography since there are no orthographic stan-
dards for DA. The Roman alphabet sentence were
transcribed from the textbooks into the Arabic al-
phabet using CODA. All examples presented in
the rest of this section are in CODA except where
specified otherwise.

4.1 Taizi Corpus (YE.TZ)

Sources The YE.TZ written data was collected
manually from different resources such as forums,



140

blogs, and social media networks. With reference
to spoken data, half of the oral interviews were
recorded and transcribed manually by the annota-
tors, the remaining oral interview transcripts are
taken from the Semitisches Tonarchiv (Section 2).
The data includes wise anecdotes, proverbs, sto-
ries, poems, songs and dialogues.

Phonology and Orthography A distinguishing
feature of YE.TZ is that MSA h. j /Ã/ is pro-
nounced as /g/, e.g., ÉÔg

.
jml ‘camel’ /gamal/, and

that MSA � q /q/ retains its pronunciation. In that
regard, CODA spellings were straightforward.

Morphology Similar to a number of other di-
alects but unlike MSA, negation is expressed as
an enclitic � $ ‘not’, e.g., �Ê 	gYK
 ydxl+$ ‘he does
not enter’. The vocative particle is expressed as
the proclitics AK
 yA ‘Oh’ and @ð wA ‘Oh’, or as an
the enclitic è @ Ah as in èA

��
Ó

@ AmAh ‘my mother’. The

verbal proclitic A�¯ qA ‘already’, which corresponds
to MSA Y�¯ qd, frequently appears with past verbs,
e.g., A 	JÊÔ« A�¯ qA EmlnA ‘we have already done that’.

Lexicon There are many open-class words that
make YE.TZ different from MSA and other di-
alects, e.g., �èñ�¯ 	P zqwp ‘shrewd’, 	á» 	P zkn ‘order’,
and ¨@Q�¯ qrAE ‘breakfast’. Some words have MSA
meanings that differ from YE.TZ, e.g., É � $l ‘take’
and

��	QK. bz ‘take’. YE.TZ has a number of loan-
words from English that underwent Arabization,
e.g., �èPAm.� sjArp ‘cigarette’, and ú



Î
�
J» ktly ‘kettle’.

4.2 Sanaani Corpus (YE.SN)
Sources The social texts were taken from
a Sanaani Radio Station program called
�
èYªÓð YªÓ msEd wmsEdp, which addressed
social issues and problems of the community.
The oral interview transcripts were taken from
the Semitisches Tonarchiv (Section 2). The
interviews describe daily life, history and lifestyle
in Sanaa. Folktales describing traditional stories
handed down in Sanaa are taken from internet
forums. Collections of wisdom sayings and tales
of the famous wise man of Yemen “Ali walad
Zaid” are taken from internet websites. Other
texts were taken from social media, and include
political events in Yemen, Sanaani jokes, religious
sermons and transcripts that discuss the Sanaani
dialect in MSA.

Phonology and Orthography MSA � q /q/ is
pronounced /g/ in YE.SN, including in religious

contexts. For example, the word QÔ
�
¯ qmr ‘moon’ is

pronounced /gamar/. This variation is not unique
to YE.SN and other dialects such as IR.BG and
JOR have it as well. This /g/ is often sponta-
neously spelled as � q, which is consistent with
CODA guidelines. A particularly marking phe-
nomenon in YE.SN is the devoicing and empha-
sis of some instances of word-medial /d/, e.g.,
�
èðY

	
« gdwp ‘tomorrow’ is pronounced /GutQwa/

and as a result may be written spontaneously as
�
èñ¢

	
« gTwp.

Morphology As shown in Table 1, there are four
future particles in YE.SN: +¨ E+, Y« Ed, + � $+,
+ø



y+. While +¨ E+ may be used with 1st, 2nd, or

3rd person conjugated verb, the rest are only used
with 1st person singular conjugated verbs.

Lexicon YE.SN has some distinguishing closed
class words, such as prepositions ù 	®�¯ qfY ‘behind’
and � � $q ‘next’, and numbers like �HA�J stAt ‘six’,
and �ª¢ë hTE$ ‘eleven’. There are also some
Turkish loanwords, e.g., ú




	
GA sAny ‘direct’ and

½K
Q» kryk ‘shovel’.

4.3 Najdi Corpus (SA.NJ)

Sources The SA.NJ corpus was collected from
different sources that represent different genres:
forums, poetry, jokes and tweets. We collected dif-
ferent posts from the Saudi web forum eqla3.
com, including personal narratives (mainly sar-
castic) and discussions. We also collected Na-
jdi poems from the late twentieth century, mainly
written by the contemporary Najdi poets Khalid
AlFaisal, Mohammed bin Ahmed AlSudairy and
Saad Bin Jadlan. We manually collected Najdi
jokes from various online resources. And finally,
on Twitter, we searched for distinctive Najdi key-
words such as A 	Jk HnA ‘we’, �é �ðQ�¯ qrw$p ‘incon-
venience’, and I. �


	
JÓ mnyb ‘I’m not’.

Phonology and Orthography As Table 1
shows, there are a number of phonological alter-
nations in SA.NJ. The /dz/ variant of � q /q/ and
/ts/ variants of ¼ k /k/ are rather restricted in their
usage. And unlike MSA, SA.NJ shows no distinc-
tion between the pronunciation of MSA etymolog-
ical 	 /dQ/ and 	  /DQ/. These phenomena affect
spontaneous orthography and had to be addressed
in the CODA annotations.

Morphology One marking morphological fea-
ture of SA.NJ (and other Gulf Arabic dialects) is

eqla3.com

141

the use of negation circumfix H. + . . + AÓ mA+ .. +b,
as in I. �


	
KAÓ mAnyb ‘I am not’ (spontaneously, often

written as I. �

	
JÓ mnyb). Similar constructions ex-

ist in other dialects but are more productive, e.g.
Egyptian �+ . . + AÓ mA+ .. +$ negates verbs in
addition to pronouns. Unlike most DA and like
MSA, SA.NJ retains some tanween (nunation).
For example: ½Ë É

�
K
A

�
¯ A

	
K

@>nA qAylK lk /Pana ga:ylin

lak/ ‘I said (active participle) to you’. However, as
in MSA, the nunation is rarely written. Some mor-
phological phenomena are becoming very rare,
e.g., the use of �� ts for 2nd person singular
feminine pronominal enclitic is dying out among
younger people and merging with the masculine
form ¼ k.

Lexicon SA.NJ has some distinguishing words
such as 	m�'.


@ >bxS ‘more expert’, ñ 	®» kfw ‘good’,

and Pñ 	¯@X dAfwr ‘nerd’ There are many borrowed
words from English compared to borrowings from
Turkish or Persian. For instance, the verb ÕÎ 	®K
 yflm
is borrowed form English ‘film’ and means ‘to act
dramatically’.

4.4 Jordanian Corpus (JOR)
Sources The corpus includes written as well as
spoken data. The written materials were drawn
from internet sources, such as, forums, blogs, and
social media. They include informal conversations
among participant or traditional folk literature like
short stories, poems, prose, memoirs, and songs.
As for spoken data, oral interviews and observa-
tions were recorded and transcribed by the anno-
tators. Nearly 20 informants were interviewed by
the researchers. Older as well as uneducated peo-
ple are included in order to ensure the authenticity
of the data. The JOR data included a mix of sub-
dialects that reflect the multiplicity of DA forms,
including markedly Palestinian as well as Jorda-
nian variants. For this reason, we refer to this cor-
pus simply as JOR.

Phonology and Orthography In some JOR
sub-dialects, as with IR.BG, MSA ¼ k is affricated
to /Ù/, e.g., I. Ê¿ klb /Ùalb/ ‘dog’.

�
 q also realizes

in two forms as /g/ and /P/. Some of these phe-
nomena results in different spontaneous spellings
that are then normalized during annotation.

Morphology JOR’s 2nd person feminine singu-
lar pronominal clitic has two alternations depend-
ing on the sub-dialect: ú



» ky /ki/ and ¼ k /ik/.

Examples include ú


¾

�
J
	
®

�
 $ftky or ½�J 	® � $ftk ‘I saw

you’; however when following a vowel, both be-
come ú



» ky /ki/, e.g. ú



»ñ

	
¯A

�
 $Afwky ‘they saw you’.

Negation is marked with the enclitic � $ ; such as,
�

�
ñAK. bAswy$ ‘I do not do’.

Lexicon Some JOR words are from Syriac, e.g.,
H. ñ

�
 $wb ‘hot’, and Q�
ºK. bkyr ‘early in the morn-

ing’. Other words are borrowed from Turkish, e.g.,
ø



Q
	
«X dgry ‘straightforward’ and 	áK
 	QK. @PX drAbzyn

‘ladder’. Some words that were borrowed from
English underwent some morpho-phonological
changes. For example, PðYK
Pñ» kwrydwr ‘corri-
dor’, �IÓQ 	¯ frmt ‘format’, and ½ÊK. blk ‘to block
somebody’.

4.5 Syrian Corpus (SY.DM)

Sources The written data was collected manu-
ally from different online written resources such as
forums, blogs, and social media networks. Among
the data, there were anecdotes, proverbs, stories,
some poems, songs and dialogues.

Phonology and Orthography SY.DM has a
glottal stop phoneme /P/ that is a cognate with ei-
ther MSA Hamza ( ð ø


@ @


Z & } > < ’) or MSA

Qaf � q. In most spontaneous SY.DM orthogra-
phy, the two forms are distinguished in a manner
similar to CODA guidelines. A few exceptions
include the word


Cë hl> ‘now’ which in CODA

is written as �Êë hlq highlighting its etymological
link to �I�¯ñËAë hAlwqt ‘this time’. Less common
spelling variations include the devoicing of h. j /Z/
to /S/, which may be reflected in spontaneous or-
thography, e.g., ©Ò�Jm.�

	
' njtmE /niZtmiQ/ ‘we meet’

may appear as ©Ò�J �	� n$tmE /niStmiQ/.

Morphology A distinction of SY.DM (and
North Levantine) compared to South Levantine
and a number of other dialects is the absence of
the negation enclitic � $. SY.DM makes use of a
number of future particles in free distribution (See
Table 1). The progressive particle Ñ« Em can only
be used to indicate active progression at the mo-
ment, while the progressive proclitic +H. b+ has a
wider range from habitual to progressive.

Lexicon As with JOR, some SY.DM words
were originally Syriac, e.g., H. ñ � $wb ‘hot’, or
ú



	
G @QK. brAny ‘outer’. Other words are borrowed from

Turkish, e.g., ø



Q
	
«X dgry ‘straightforward’. Some

words encountered major semantic shifts, e.g.,
	Q£ Tz comes from Turkish tuz ‘salt’, then shifting
to mean ‘something unimportant’, and eventually



142

‘good riddance’. Other words were found to be
borrowed from French, e.g., PñºK
X dykwr ‘decor’
and ñ�KAg. gAtw ‘gateaux’, and from Persian like
ø



QåQå srsry ‘bad man’. Markedly SY.DM expres-
sions include �ñK. Qk Hrbwq /èarbu:P/ ‘shrewd’.

4.6 Iraqi corpus (IR.BG)
Sources The materials of the IR.BG corpus were
obtained from social media websites, blogs and
other online sources. The sources contain posts
on political, social, and religious issues that touch
upon the daily life of the Iraqi people. The sources
include blogs, e.g., different sarcastic posts with
a witty sense of humor gathered from the Iraqi
blog ú




�
¯@QªË@

�
Ê

�
 $l$ AlErAqy, and short essays with

commentary and views that sharply criticize loss
in traditional values and morals in the Iraqi soci-
ety after 2003. Proverbs, common sayings, and fa-
mous expressions were also collected from online
blogs and forums.

Phonology and Orthography Some instances
of MSA ¼ k appear as /tS/ in IR.BG, e.g., �I	KA¿ kAnt
‘she was’ /tSa:nat/. Some of these cases appear in
spontaneous orthography as ��� t$ or even h� J/h. j
(mostly due to Persian spelling influences). Some
instances of MSA /q/ are pronounced as /g/, e.g.,
�

ñ
	
¯ fwq ‘above’ /fo:g/. Some of these cases appear

in spontaneous orthography as À G or ¼ k, also
due to Persian influences.

Morphology A strong marker of IR.BG is the
progressive proctlitc +X d+, e.g., ? �ñ��Y � $dtswq?
‘what are you driving?’. IR.BG also has three fu-
ture particles: h@P rAH, hP rH, and +h H+, which
seem to be in free variation.

Lexicon The IR.BG lexicon has some distin-
guishing words such as pñ£


@ >Twx ‘little darker’,

and ú



	
G
�
@ |ny ‘I’. IR.BG has many loanwords from

Kurdish, Persian, and Russian, e.g., Kurdish
é» A¿ kAkh ‘mister’, Persian 	¨@Y 	J�¯ qndAg ‘very
weak tea or hot water and sugar’, and Russian
	
àA¾

�
J@


<stkAn ‘a spindle-shaped tea cup’.

4.7 Moroccan Corpus (MA.RB)
Sources The corpus includes comments from
the Moroccan news website hespress.com
that have to do with sports, cinema, and educa-
tion policy. The materials from forums include ad-
vice on social, religious, and economic issues. The
oral interviews are transcriptions of people telling
stories, most of which are events from their lives.

The folktales come from a Moroccan website that
reprinted stories originally published in an ency-
clopedia of traditional Moroccan folktales. The
textbook examples include many basic greetings
and expressions, as well as sample dialogues. The
blog posts range in topic, but include relationship
advice, recipes, and philosophical musings. The
humor includes both short and long jokes from a
few Facebook pages and one other website.

Phonology and Orthography Most MA.RB
consonants are pronounced like their MSA equiva-
lents; however, there are exceptions: dental conso-
nants in MSA have become alveolar, so MSA �H v
/T/, 	X * /D/, and 	  Z /DQ/, are pronounced /t/, /d/,
and /dQ/, respectively in MA.RB. Such issues nat-
urally interact with spontaneous orthography and
are annotated as per CODA guidelines.

Morphology Among the set of dialects dis-
cussed here, MA.RB has the most distinct set of
morphological features, such as its future, progres-
sive and possessive particles (see Table 1). Like
other North African dialects, and unlike MSA,
MA.RB uses the prefix + 	à n+ for imperfect first
person singular, and distinguishes first person plu-
ral by adding the plural suffix @ð+ +wA. Interest-
ingly the imperfect first person singular in MA.RB
looks like the imperfect first person plural in MSA
and numerous other dialects. Finally, the perfect
second person singular masculine and feminine
both use the suffix ú




�
G ty, which corresponds to the

feminine suffix in other DA.

Lexicon MA.RB has a number of loanwords
from Berber, French and Spanish; and many
speakers code-switch between Moroccan and
French or Spanish. Examples include French
h. AÓPñ

	
¯ fwrmAj ‘cheese’, and ÉK. A�KPñK. bwrtAbl ‘mo-

bile phone’; and Spanish �é 	K AÖÞ smAnp ‘week’, and
PñK. AK. bAbwr ‘ship’.

5 Annotation Process

Process Overview To create new morphologi-
cal annotated corpora, we follow (AlShargi et al.,
2016)’s basic approach: we utilize the DIWAN
tool (Alshargi and Rambow, 2015) to build and
annotate the seven DA corpora discussed above.
The project team consists of:

1. a project manager,

2. dialect leads for each dialect, and

Figure 1: Steps to creating a new annotated corpus for a dialect

3. annotators.

The dialect leads verify the annotators’ work,
and the project manager organizes and monitors
the flow of the progress of everyone using the tool
in the project.

Annotation Steps First, the dialect leads collect
the corpus text from different resources like so-
cial media, forms, websites, etc. The next step is
to develop dialect-specific annotation guidelines,
including the CODA specification for normalized
orthography. The dialect leads then train the an-
notators before annotation starts. The leads follow
the annotator’s work. The annotations are not ap-
proved until the dialect leads check them. Wrong
annotations are sent back to the annotator for cor-
rection. After the first round of annotation is done,
we perform a second round of error checking, us-
ing both manual inspection and scripts that check
for coherent annotations. The result is a DIWAN
file which includes the correct annotation for the
entire corpus. In the last step, we automatically re-
format the annotations into a format which is best
suited for computational purposes; we perform a
third round of error checking for format errors,
which we fix automatically. Figure 1 shows these
steps.

Morphological Features Annotated The DI-
WAN interface assists human annotators in anno-

tating each token with morphological and seman-
tic information, including the following fields:

• The CODA spelling of the raw token.

• The lemma, or the citation form, of the token.

• The morphemes of the word (prefixes, stem,
suffixes) and their part-of-speech (POS). The
stem is marked by the symbol # on either
side.

• The English gloss of the word.

• Features indicating proclitics and enclitics.

• Features indicating word POS, functional
number and gender (Alkuhlani and Habash,
2011), and aspect.

The annotation for one sentence in different di-
alects is shown in Table 2. This is not actually
a sentence from our corpora, of course; we have
chosen it to illustrate the annotation.

Error Correction Linguistic annotation is car-
ried out manually. In order to guarantee high lev-
els of accuracy and precision, we performed ex-
tensive error checking and correction. After an-
notating the seven different corpora, the anno-
tated words were compiled in the form of linguis-
tic codes in either one file or separate files to be



145

checked and corrected by a second reviewer. This
form of error checking cannot of course identify
annotation errors in context (for example, a noun
is misidentified as a verb); instead, this approach
is efficient at finding impossible annotations. Ex-
amining the data demonstrated that the most chal-
lenging part for the annotators was the suffixes
part, especially when there are long and compli-
cated words. Some examples indicating the errors
are listed below in Table 3.

Distribution of Resources All created re-
sources will be freely available for research pur-
poses from Columbia (http://innovation.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented a collection of morphologically an-
notated corpora for seven Arabic dialects, col-
lectively covering over 200,000 words. All cor-
pora were manually annotated in a common set
of standards for orthography, diacritized lem-
mas, tokenization, morphological units and En-
glish glosses. These corpora will be publicly avail-
able to serve as benchmarks for training and eval-
uating systems for Arabic dialect morphological
analysis and disambiguation.

In future work, we will use these resources to
train morphological taggers as described in (Es-
kander et al., 2016). We also plan to extend the
collection of dialect to include additional less stud-
ied varieties following the lead of efforts such as
Bouamor et al. (2018). We also plan to expand to-
wards different historical and literature based va-
rieties of Arabic.
