Abstract

We present our English→Czech and
English→Hindi submissions for this
year’s WMT translation task. For
English→Czech, we build upon last year’s
CHIMERA and evaluate several setups.
English→Hindi is a new language pair for
this year. We experimented with reverse
self-training to acquire more (synthetic)
parallel data and with modeling target-side
morphology.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we describe translation systems sub-
mitted by Charles University (CU or CUNI) to the
Translation task of the Ninth Workshop on Statis-
tical Machine Translation (WMT) 2014.

In §2, we present our English→Czech systems,
CU-TECTOMT, CU-BOJAR, CU-DEPFIX and CU-
FUNKY. The systems are very similar to our sub-
missions (Bojar et al., 2013) from last year, the
main novelty being our experiments with domain-
specific and document-specific language models.

In §3, we describe our experiments with
English→Hindi translation, which is a translation
pair new both to us and to WMT. We unsuccess-
fully experimented with reverse self-training and a
morphological-tags-based language model, and so
our final submission, CU-MOSES, is only a basic
instance of Moses.

2 English→Czech
Our submissions for English→Czech build upon
last year’s successful CHIMERA system (Bojar
et al., 2013). We combine several different ap-
proaches:

• factored phrase-based Moses model (§2.1),

• domain-adapted language model (§2.2),

• document-specific language models (§2.3),
• deep-syntactic MT system TectoMT (§2.4),
• automatic post-editing system Depfix (§2.5).
We combined the approaches in several ways

into our four submissions, as made clear by Ta-
ble 1. CU-TECTOMT is the stand-alone TectoMT
translation system, while the other submissions
are Moses-based, using TectoMT indirectly to pro-
vide an additional phrase-table. CU-BOJAR uses
a factored model and a domain-adapted language
model; in CU-DEPFIX, Depfix post-processing is
added; and CU-FUNKY also employs document-
specific language models.

2.1 Our Baseline Factored Moses System
Our baseline translation system (denoted “Base-
line” in the following) is similar to last year – we
trained a factored Moses model on the concatena-
tion of CzEng (Bojar et al., 2012) and Europarl
(Koehn, 2005), see Table 2. We use two fac-
tors: tag, which is the part-of-speech tag, and stc,
which is “supervised truecasing”, i.e. the surface
form with letter case set according to the lemma;
see (Bojar et al., 2013). Our factored Moses sys-
tem translates from English stc to Czech stc | tag
in one translation step.

Our basic language models are identical to last
year’s submission. We added an adapted language

model which we describe in the following section.
Tables 3 and 4 show basic data about the language
models. Aside from modeling surface forms, our
language models also capture morphological co-
herence to some degree.

2.2 Adapted Language Model

We used the 2013 News Crawl to create a language
model adapted to the domain of the test set (i.e.
news domain) using data selection based on infor-
mation retrieval (Tamchyna et al., 2012). We use
the Baseline system to translate the source sides of
WMT test sets 2012–2014. The translations then
constitute a “query corpus” for Lucene.1 For each
sentence in the query corpus, we use Lucene to
retrieve 20 most similar sentences from the 2013
News Crawl. After de-duplication, we obtained a
monolingual corpus of roughly 250 thousand sen-
tences and trained an additional 6-gram language
model on this data.

2.3 Document-Specific Language Models

CU-FUNKY further extends the idea described in
§2.2. Taking advantage of document IDs which
are included in WMT development and test data,
we split our dev- (WMT 13) and test-set (WMT
14) into documents. We translate each document
with the Baseline system and use Lucene to re-
trieve 10,000 most similar target-side sentences
from News Crawl 2013 for each document sen-
tence.

Using this procedure, we obtain a corpus for
each document. On average, the corpora con-
tain roughly 208 thousand sentences after de-
duplication. Each corpus then serves as the
training data for the document-specific language
model.

We implemented an alternative to
moses-parallel.perl which splits the
input corpus based on document IDs and runs a
separate Moses instance/job for each document.
Moreover, it allows to modify the Moses config-
uration file according to document ID. We use
this feature to plant the correct document-specific
language model to each job.

In tuning, our technique only adds one weight.
In each split, the weight corresponds to a differ-
ent language model. The optimizer then hope-
fully averages the utility of this document-specific
LM across all documents. The same weight is ap-
plied also in the test set translation, exchanging the
document-specific LM file.

2.4 TectoMT Deep-Syntactic MT System

TectoMT2 was one of the three key components
in last year’s CHIMERA. It is a linguistically-
motivated tree-to-tree deep-syntactic translation
system with transfer based on Maximum Entropy
context-sensitive translation models (Mareček et
al., 2010) and Hidden Tree Markov Models
(Žabokrtský and Popel, 2009). It is trained on
the WMT-provided data: CzEng 1.0 (parallel data)
and News Crawl (2007–2012 Czech monolingual
sets).

We maintain the same approach to combining
TectoMT with Moses as last year – we translate
WMT test sets from years 2007–2014 and use
them as additional synthetic parallel training data –
a corpus consisting of the test set source side (En-
glish) and TectoMT output (synthetic Czech). We
then use the standard extraction pipeline to create

2http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tectomt/

196



an additional phrase table from this corpus. The
translated data overlap completely both with our
development and test data for Moses so that tuning
can assign an appropriate weight to the synthetic
phrase table.

2.5 Depfix Automatic Post-Editing

As in the previous years, we used Depfix (Rosa,
2013) to post-process the translations. Depfix is
an automatic post-editing system which is mainly
rule-based and uses various linguistic tools (tag-
gers, parsers, morphological generators, etc.) to
detect and correct errors, especially grammatical
ones. The system was slightly improved since last
year, and a new fixing rule was added for correct-
ing word order in noun clusters translated as geni-
tive constructions.

In English, a noun can behave as an adjective,
as in “according to the house owners”, while in
Czech, this is not possible, and a genitive construc-
tion has to be used instead, similarly to “according
to the owners of the house” – the modifier is in the
genitive morphological case and follows the noun.
However, SMT systems translating into Czech do
not usually focus much on word reordering, which
leads to non-fluent or incomprehensible construc-
tions, such as “podle domugen vlastnı́kůgen” (ac-
cording to-the-house of-the-owners). Fortunately,
such cases are easy to distinguish with the help
of a dependency parser and a morphological tag-
ger – genitive modifiers usually do not precede the
head but follow it (unless they are parts of named
entities), so we can safely switch the word order
to the correct one: “podle vlastnı́kůgen domugen”
(according to-the-owners of-the-house).

2.6 Results

We report scores of automatic metrics as shown in
the submission system,3 namely (case-sensitive)
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover
et al., 2006). The results, summarized in Ta-
ble 5, show that CU-FUNKY is the most success-
ful of our systems according to BLEU, while
the simpler CU-DEPFIX wins in TER. The re-
sults of manual evaluation suggest that CU-DEPFIX
(dubbed CHIMERA) remains the best performing
English→Czech system.

In comparison to other English→Czech sys-
tems submitted to WMT 2014, CU-FUNKY ranked
as the second in BLEU, and CU-DEPFIX ranked

3http://matrix.statmt.org/

as the second in TER; the winning system, ac-
cording to both of these metrics, was UEDIN-
UNCONSTRAINED.

Table 5: Scores of automatic metrics and results of
manual evaluation for our systems. The table also
lists the best system according to automatic met-
rics and Google Translate as the best-performing
commercial system.

Our analysis of CU-FUNKY suggests that it is
not the best performing system on average (de-
spite achieving the highest BLEU scores from our
submissions), but that it is rather the most volatile
system. Some sentences were obviously improved
compared to CU-BOJAR but most got degraded es-
pecially in adequacy. We are well aware of the
many shortcomings our current implementation
has, the most severe of which lie in the sentence
selection by Lucene. For instance, we do not use
any stopwords or keyword detection methods, and
also pretending that each sentence in our monolin-
gual corpus is a “document” for the information
retrieval system is far from ideal.

We also evaluated a version of CU-BOJAR which
uses not only the adapted LM but also an addi-
tional LM trained on the full 2013 News Crawl
data (see “CU-BOJAR +full 2013 news” in Table 5)
but found no improvement compared to using just
the adapted model (trained on a subset of the data).

3 English→Hindi
English-Hindi is a new language pair this
year. We submitted an unconstrained system for
English→Hindi translation.

We used HindEnCorp (Bojar et al., 2014) as the
sole source of parallel data (nearly 276 thousand
sentence pairs, around 3.95 million English tokens
and 4.09 million Hindi tokens).

Given that no test set from previous years was
available and that the size of the development set
provided by WMT organizers was only 500 sen-
tence pairs, we held out the first 5000 sentence
pairs of HindEnCorp for this purpose. Our de-
velopment set then consisted of the 500 provided

sentences plus 1500 sentence pairs from HindEn-
Corp. The remaining 3500 sentence pairs taken
from HindEnCorp constituted our test set.

As for monolingual data, we used the News
Crawl corpora provided for the task and the new
monolingual HindMonoCorp, which makes our
submission unconstrained. Table 6 shows statis-
tics of our monolingual data.

We tagged and lemmatized the English data us-
ing Morče (Spoustová et al., 2007) and the Hindi
data using Siva Reddy’s POS tagger.4

3.1 Baseline System

The baseline system was eventually our best-
performing one. Its design is completely straight-
forward – it uses one phrase table trained on
all parallel data (we translate from “supervised-
truecased” English into Hindi forms) and one 5-
gram language model trained on all monolingual
data. We used KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013) for
estimating the model as the data was rather large
(see Table 6).

We used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) as
our word alignment tool. We experimented with
several coarser representations to make the final
alignment more reliable. Table 7 shows the re-
sults. The factor “stem4” refers to simply taking
the first four characters of each word. For lem-
mas, we used the outputs of the tools mentioned
above. However, lemmas as output by the Hindi
tagger were not much coarser than surface forms
– the ratio between the number of types is merely
1.11 – so we also tried “stemming” the lemmas
(lemma4). Of these variants, stem4-stem4 align-
ment worked best and we used it for the rest of our
experiments.

3.2 Reverse Self-Training

Bojar and Tamchyna (2011) showed a simple tech-
nique for improving translation quality in situa-
tions where there is only a small amount of par-

tools

stem4 stem4 22.96±1.17

tions for word alignment.

allel data available but where there is a sufficient
quantity of target-side monolingual texts. The so-
called “reverse self-training” uses a factored sys-
tem trained in the opposite direction to translate
the large monolingual data into the source lan-
guage. The translation (in the source language,
i.e. English in our case) and the original target-
side data (Hindi) can be used as additional syn-
thetic parallel data. The authors recommend creat-
ing a separate phrase table from it and combining
the two translation models as alternatives in the
log-linear model (letting tuning weigh their impor-
tance).

The factored setup of the reverse system
(Hindi→English) is essential – alternative decod-
ing paths with a back-off to a coarser representa-
tion (e.g. stems) on the source side (Hindi) give
the system the ability to generalize beyond surface
forms observed in the training data. The main aim
of this technique is to learn new forms of known
words.

The technique is thus aimed at translating into a
morphologically richer language than the source.
Indeed, the authors showed that if the target lan-
guage has considerably more word types than the
source, the gains achieved by reverse self-training
are higher. In this respect, English→Hindi is not
an ideal candidate given that the ratio we observed
is only 1.2.

The choice of back-off representation is impor-
tant. We measure the vocabulary reduction of
several options and summarize the results in Ta-
ble 8. E.g. for stem4, the vocabulary size is
roughly 30% compared to the number of surface
word forms.

Bojar and Tamchyna (2011) achieved the best
results using “nosuf3” (“suffix trimming”, i.e. cut-
ting of the last 3 characters of each word); how-
ever, they experimented with European languages
and the highest reduction of vocabulary reported
in the paper is to roughly one half. In our case, the
vocabulary is reduced much more, so we opted for
a more conservative back-off, namely “nosuf2”.

Back-off % of vocab. size

lemma4 32.36
nosuf3 36.36

lemma5 57.47
lemma 90.09

Table 8: Options for back-off factors in reverse
self-training and the percentage of their vocabu-
lary size compared to surface forms.

We translated roughly 2 million sentences from
the Hindi monolingual data, focusing on news
to maintain a domain match with the WMT test
set. However, adding the synthetic phrase table
did not bring any improvement and in fact, the
BLEU score dropped to 22.37±1.17 (baseline is
22.96±1.17).

We can attribute the failure of reverse self-
training to the nature of the language pair at hand.
While Hindi has some synthetic properties (e.g.
future tense of verbs or inflection of adjectives are
marked by suffixes), its inflectional morphemes
are realized mainly by post-positions which are
separated from their head-words. Overlooking this
essential property, we attempted to use reverse
self-training but our technique could contribute
only very little.

3.3 Target-Side Morphology

We also experimented with a setup that tradition-
ally works very well for English→Czech trans-
lation: using a high-order language model on
morphological tags to explicitly model target-side
morphological coherence in translation. We used
the same monolingual data as for the baseline lan-
guage model; however, the order of our morpho-
logical language model was set to 10.

This setup also brought no improvement over
the baseline – in fact, the BLEU score dropped
even further to 22.27±1.14.

4 Conclusion

We presented our contributions to the Translation
task of WMT 2014.

As we have focused on English→Czech trans-
lation for many years, we have developed sev-
eral complex and well-performing systems for it
– an adaptation of the phrase-based Moses sys-

tem, a linguistically-motivated syntax-based Tec-
toMT system, and an automatic post-editing Dep-
fix system. We combine the individual systems
using a very simple yet effective method and the
combined system called CHIMERA confirmed its
state-of-the-art performance.

For English→Hindi translation, which was a
new task for us, we managed to get competitive
results by using a baseline Moses setup, but were
unable to improve upon those by employing ad-
vanced techniques that had proven to be effective
for other translation directions.
