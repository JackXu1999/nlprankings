Abstract

Dialectal Arabic (DA) is significantly dif-
ferent from the Arabic language taught in
schools and used in written communica-
tion and formal speech (broadcast news,
religion, politics, etc.). There are many
existing researches in the field of Arabic
language Sentiment Analysis (SA); how-
ever, they are generally restricted to Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA) or some di-
alects of economic or political interest. In
this paper we focus on SA of the Tunisian
dialect. We use Machine Learning tech-
niques to determine the polarity of com-
ments written in Tunisian dialect. First,
we evaluate the SA systems performances
with models trained using freely available
MSA and Multi-dialectal data sets. We
then collect and annotate a Tunisian di-
alect corpus of 17.000 comments from
Facebook. This corpus shows a signif-
icant improvement compared to the best
model trained on other Arabic dialects or
MSA data. We believe that this first freely
available12 corpus will be valuable to re-
searchers working in the field of Tunisian
Sentiment Analysis and similar areas.

1 Introduction

Sentiment Analysis (SA) involves building sys-
tems that recognize the human opinion from a text
unit. SA and its applications have spread to many
languages and almost every possible domain such
as politics, marketing and commerce. With re-
gard to the Arabic language, it is worth noting
that the most Arabic social media texts are written
in Arabic dialects and sometimes mixed with for-
eign languages (French or English for example).

1This corpus is freely available for research purpose
2https://github.com/fbougares/TSAC

Therefore dialectal Arabic is abundantly present in
social media and micro blogging channels. In pre-
vious works, several SA systems were developed
for MSA and some dialects (mainly Egyptian and
middle east region dialects).

In this paper, we present an application of
sentiment analysis to the Tunisian dialect. One
of the primary problems is the lack of annotated
data. To overcome this problem, we start by using
and evaluating the performance using available
resources from MSA and dialects, then we cre-
ated and annotated our own data set. We have
performed different experiments using several
machine learning algorithms such as Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes classifier, and
SVM. The main contributions of this article are as
follows: (1) we present a survey of the available
resources for Arabic language SA (MSA and
dialectal). (2) We create a freely available training
corpus for Tunisian dialect SA. (3) We evaluate
the performance of Tunisian dialect SA system
under several configurations.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 discusses some related works.
Section 3 presents the Tunisian dialect features
and its challenges. Section 4 details our Tunisian
dialect corpus creation and annotation. In section
4 we report our experimental framework and the
obtained results. Finally section 5 concludes this
paper and gives some outlooks to future work.

2 Related work

The Sentiment Analysis task is becoming increas-
ingly important due to the explosion of the number
of social media users. The largest amount of SA
research is carried for the English language, re-
sulting in a high quality SA tools. For many other
languages, especially the low resourced ones, an
enormous amount of research is required to reach
the same level of current applications dedicated

55



to English. Recently, there has been a consider-
able amount of work and effort to collect resources
and develop SA systems for the Arabic language.
However, the number of freely available Arabic
datasets and Arabic lexicons for SA are still lim-
ited in number, size, availability and dialects cov-
erage.

It is worth mentioning that the highest propor-
tion of available resources and research publica-
tions in Arabic SA are devoted to MSA (Assiri et
al., 2015). Regarding Arabic dialects, the Middle
Eastern and Egyptian dialects received the lion’s
share of all research effort and funding. On the
other hand, very small amounts of work are de-
voted to the dialects of Arabian Peninsula, Arab
Maghreb and the West Asian Arab countries. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the list of all freely available SA
corpora for Arabic and dialects that we were able
to find. For more details about previous works on
SA for MSA and its dialects, we refer the reader
to the extensive surveys presented in (Assiri et al.,
2015) and in (Biltawi et al., 2016).

From a technical point of view, the are two
approaches to address the problem of sentiment
classification: (1) machine learning based ap-
proaches and (2) lexicon-based approaches.

Machine learning approaches uses annotated
data sets to train classifiers. The sentiment clas-
sifier is built by extracting discriminative fea-
tures from annotated data and applying a Machine
learning algorithm such as Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM), Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) and Logistic re-
gression etc. Generally, the best performance is
achieved by using n-grams feature, but also Part
of speech (POS), term frequency (TF) and syntac-
tic information can be used. (Shoukry and Rafea,
2012) examined two machine learning algorithms:
SVM and NB. The dataset is collected from the
Twitter social network using its API. Classifiers
are trained using unigram and bigram features and
the results show that SVM outperforms NB.

Another machine learning approach was used
in (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b) where they build
the opinion corpus for Arabic (OCA) consisting
of movie reviews written in Arabic. They also cre-
ated an English version translated from Arabic and
called EVOCA (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b). Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes
(NB) classifiers are then used to create SA sys-
tems for both languages. The results showed that

both classifiers gives better results on the Arabic
version. For instance, SVM gives 90% F-measure
on OCA compared to 86.9% on EVOCA.

(Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012), have presented
SAMAR, a sentiment analysis system for Arabic
social media, which requires identifying whether
the text is objective or subjective before identi-
fying its polarity. The proposed system uses the
SVM-light toolkit for classification.

In lexicon-based approaches, opinion word lex-
icon are usually created. An opinion word lexi-
con is a list of words with annotated opinion po-
larities and through these polarities the application
determine the polarity of blocks of text. (Bay-
oudhi et al., 2015) presented a lexicon based ap-
proach for MSA. First, a lexicon has been built
following a semi automatic approach. Then, the
lexicon entries were used to detect opinion words
and assign to each one a sentiment class. This
approach takes into account the advanced linguis-
tic phenomena such as negation and intensifica-
tion. The introduced method was evaluated using
a large multi-domain annotated sentiment corpus
segmented into discourse segments. Another work
has been done in (Al-Ayyoub et al., 2015) where
authors built a sentiment lexicon of about 120,000
Arabic words and created a SA system on top of it.
They reported a 86.89% of classification accuracy.

3 Tunisian dialect and its challenges

The Arabic dialects vary widely in between re-
gions and to a lesser extent from city to city in
each region. The Tunisian dialect is a subset of
the Arabic dialects of the Western group usually
associated with the Arabic of the Maghreb and is
commonly known, as the ”Darija or Tounsi”. It
is used in oral communication of the daily life of
Tunisians. In addition to the words from Mod-
ern Standard Arabic, Tunisian dialect is charac-
terized by the presence of words borrowed from
French, Berber, Italian, Turkish and Spanish. This
phenomenon is due to many factors and historical
events such as the Islamic invasions, French colo-
nization and immigrations.

Nowadays, the Tunisian dialect is more often
used in interviews, telephone conversations and
public services. Moreover, Tunisian dialect is be-
coming very present in blogs, forums and online
user comments. Therefore, it is important to con-
sider this dialect in the context of Natural Lan-

guage Processing (NLP). The development of SA
system for Tunisian dialect faces many challenges
due to: (1) the very limited number of previous
research conducted in this dialect, (2) the lack
of freely available resources for SA in this di-
alect, (3) and the absence of standard orthogra-
phies (Maamouri et al., 2014) (Zribi et al., 2014)
and tools dedicated to this dialect.

Indeed, textual content of social networks is
characterized by an intense orthographic hetero-
geneity which made its processing a serious chal-
lenge for NLP tools. This heterogeneity is aug-
mented by the lack of normalization of dialec-
tal writing system. Moreover, social networks
communication is very impacted by the personal
experience of each user. For instance, Tunisian
users usually uses code-switching with English or
French which depends of their second language.

Table 2 presents an example to highlight the or-
thographic heterogeneity issue in Tunisian dialect.
The example presents the Tunisian dialect transla-
tion of the English expression ”how beautiful she
is! ”. The translation is a single word which could
be written using several spelling variants in Latin
or Arabic script in the context of social networks.

4 Data set collection and annotation

Being aware of the challenges related to the
tunisian dialect, we decided to create the first pub-
licly available SA data set for this dialect. This

data set is collected from Facebook users com-
ments. Tunisian are among the most active Face-
book Users in the Arab Region3. In fact, Tunisia
is the 8th Arabic country in terms of penetration
rates of Tunisian Facebook users, and almost tied
as 2nd in the region alongside the UAE (United
Arab Emirates) on the percentage of most active
users out of total users (Salem, 2017).

This corpus is collected from comments written
on official pages of Tunisian radios and TV chan-
nels namely Mosaique FM, JawhraFM, Shemes
FM, HiwarElttounsi TV and Nessma TV during a
period spanning January 2015 until June 2016.

The collected corpus, called TSAC (Tunisian
Sentiment Analysis Corpus), contains 17k user
comments manually annotated to positive and neg-
ative polarities. Table 4 shows the basic statistics.
In particular, we give the number of words, the
number of unique words and the average length of

comments per polarity. We provide also the num-
ber of Arabic words and mixed comments.

# Arabic Words 13896 8048
# Mixed comments 98 48
# Comments 8215 8845

Table 3: Statistics of the TSAC corpus.

The collected corpus is characterized by the use
of informal and non-standard vocabulary such as
repeated letters and non-standard abbreviations,
the presence of onomatopoeia (e.g. pff, hhh, etc)
and non linguistic content such as emoticons. Fur-
thermore, the data set contains comments writ-
ten in Arabic scripts, Latin scripts known as Ara-
bizi (Darwish, 2014) and even a mixture of both.
TSAC is a multi-domain corpus consisting of the
text covering a maximum vocabulary from educa-
tion, social and politics domain.

Given the nature of the raw collected data we
did some cleaning before the annotation step. We
manually : (1) removed the comments that are
fully in other languages (French, English, etc.); (2)
deleted the user names; (3) deleted URLs and (4)
removed hash character from all Hashtags. Table
4, presents several examples for each polarity. We
also added the Buckwalter transliteration and the
English translation for the purpose of clarity.

5 Experiments and results

From machine learning perspective, the SA could
be represented as text classification problem (bi-
nary classification in our case). In this section we
present several experiments that we run in order to
find out (1) the most desirable machine learning
algorithms for our task and (2) the usefulness of
training data from MSA and other dialects for the
Tunisian dialect SA.

5.1 Training Data and features extraction
Table 5 presents the training and evalaution sets.
For each corpus we report the dialect, the num-
ber of comments per polarity (positive /negative)
and the vocabulary size (|V |). We used 3 dif-
ferent training corpus, OCA (Opinion Corpus
for Arabic), LABR (Large-scale Arabic Book
Review) and TSAC. The OCA corpus contains

500 movie reviews in MSA, collected from forums
and websites. It is divided into 250 positive and
250 negative reviews. In this work, we used a sen-
tence level segmented version of OCA corpus de-
scribed in (Bayoudhi et al., 2015)4. The LABR
corpus is freely available5 and contains over 63k
book reviews written in MSA and different Arabic
dialects. In our experiments we refer to this corpus
as mixed dialect corpus (D Mix). The evaluation
corpus is a held-out portion, randomly extracted
from the TSAC corpus to evaluate and compare
different SA systems on Tunisian dialect.

In the literature, different linguistic features are
generally extracted and successfully used for the
SA task. Given the absence of linguistic tools
(Part-of-Speech tagger, morphological analysers,
lemmatizers, parsers, etc) for Tunisian dialect, we
decided to run different classifiers using automati-
cally learned features.

A fixed-length vector is learned in an unsu-
pervised fashion using Doc2vec toolkit (Le and
Mikolov, 2014) which has been shown to be useful
for SA in English (Le and Mikolov, 2014). In this
work, each sentence is considered as a document
and represented, using Doc2vec, by a vector in a
multi-dimensional space.

5.2 Classifiers

In SA literature, the most widely used machine
learning methods are Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). On top of these
methods, we investigated MLP classifier. All
the experiments were conducted in Python using
Scikit Learn6 for classification and gensim7 for
learning vector representation. The input of the
final sentiment classifier is the set of features vec-
tors from Doc2vec toolkit. The output is the senti-
ment class S ∈ {Positive, Negative}.

5.3 SA experiments and evaluation

To evaluate the performance of SA on the Tunisian
dialect validation set, we carried out several exper-
iments using various configuration.

Seven experiments were carried out for each
classifier depending on the training dataset: (1) us-
ing the Tunisian dialect training set, (2) using the

ferent combination of these datasets.
The performance of our different SA experi-

ments are evaluated on the Tunisian dialect eval-
uation set and results are reported using precision
and recall measures. Precision and recall are de-
fined to express respectively the exactness and the
sensitivity of the classifiers.

5.4 Results and Discussion
The results of the different classifiers with differ-
ent experimental setups are presented in Table 6.
As expected, the best classification performance of
all the classifiers are obtained when the Tunisian
dialect SA system is trained using (or including)
the Tunisian dialect training set. We obtained an
error rate of 0.23 with SVM, 0.22 with MLP and
0.42 with BNB.

As shown in table 6 SVM and MLP obtain sim-
ilar results for all experimental setups. However,
lower results are obtained with BNB classifier. We
notice also no improvement when the SA sys-
tems are trained with additional training data from
LABR and OCA. Overall, poorer results are ob-
tained when SA systems are trained without the
TSAC corpus. This is mainly due to :

• The OCA and LABR data sets are limited to
one domain (movies and books respectively),
while the evaluation set is multi-domain.

• The OCA and LABR data sets are written
only in Arabic character, while the evaluation
set contains Latin character.

• The lexical differences between Tunisian di-
alect, MSA and other dialects.For example,
the English word beautiful, is written in
Tunisian: TaAa§Åzi /mizoyaAnap, in Egyp-
tian : Å­Áw"li� / Hilowapo and in MSA :
¿Talyima� / jamiylapN)

Table 7 shows several outputs of our SA system
with MLP classifier. We present examples for Pos-
itive and Negative classes and for both situation :
when SA predict the correct polarity and when SA
system fails.

6 Conclusions and feature work

In this paper we have presented the first freely
available annotated sentiment analysis corpus for
the Tunisian dialect. We have experimented and
presented several SA experiments with different
training configurations. Best results for Tunisian

SA are obtained using the Tunisian training cor-
pus. We believe that this corpus will help to boost
research on SA of Tunisian dialect and to explore
new techniques in this field. As future works we
would like to perform a deep analysis of system
outputs. We are planning also to work on the
TSAC corpus normalization and to extend the cor-
pus to include the neutral class.
