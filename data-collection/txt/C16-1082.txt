Abstract

We present a linguistic analysis of a set of English and Spanish verb+noun combinations (VNCs),
and a method to use this information to improve VNC identification. Firstly, a sample of frequent
VNCs are analysed in-depth and tagged along lexico-semantic and morphosyntactic dimensions,
obtaining satisfactory inter-annotator agreement scores. Then, a VNC identification experiment
is undertaken, where the analysed linguistic data is combined with chunking information and
syntactic dependencies. A comparison between the results of the experiment and the results
obtained by a basic detection method shows that VNC identification can be greatly improved by
using linguistic information, as a large number of additional occurrences are detected with high
precision.

1 Introduction

Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are recurrent combinations of two or more words expressing a single
unit of meaning, this meaning not always derivable directly from the meanings of the component words
(Sag et al., 2002). Therefore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that need to be sensitive to
lexical meaning should treat MWEs as single units. However, this is a challenging problem since many
MWEs can have multimple morphosyntactic variants, which makes them difficult to recognise or gener-
ate. Examples (1)-(3) below contain take steps; correct translation of this MWE into another language,
for instance, requires it to be recognised as a single unit1.

(1) The Government will take all the necessary steps to prepare.

(2) They set out five important steps the Minister needs to take.

(3) What were the steps that should have been taken?

Although the most straightforward method for recognising MWEs is to attempt to match word se-
quences against entries in a lexicon, this method does not work for combinations that can have multiple
variants. This is often the situation for verb+noun combinations (VNCs), since this kind of MWE is
usually morphosyntactically flexible.

In the case of Machine Translation (MT), there are two challenges that need to be addressed concerning
VNCs: (1) the detection of a given combination in the source language, and (2) its translation into the
target language. If the first part fails, the words that constitute the MWE will be translated separately,

which will usually result in an incorrect translation. Then, for the second part, it is vital to have the
necessary information to know what translation should be given to each VNC. A further problem arises
here, since the morphosyntax of this kind of MWE varies a great deal from one language to another,
meaning that it is not necessarily translated by another VNC into the target language. This problem
is especially acute when the source and target languages are typologically different, as with English,
Spanish and Basque2. This is what happens in example (4).

(4) English (EN): get married (V+V)

Spanish (ES): contraer matrimonio (V+N)
‘contract marriage’

Basque (EU): ezkondu (V)
‘(to) marry’

In this paper, we present a linguistic analysis undertaken with the aim of improving the detection of
VNCs in Matxin (Mayor et al., 2011), a rule-based MT system which translates English and Spanish
into Basque. Although we ground our study in this particular MT system, our methodology, analysis and
conclusions are relevant to any kind of NLP task that needs to be sensitive to lexical meaning.

The paper is structured as follows. After discussing related work (Section 2), we present our linguistic
analysis (Section 3) including: our procedure for VNC tagging, how we classify the combinations, and
levels of inter-annotator agreement. In Section 4 we present a VNC detection experiment, and give the
results obtained by combining linguistic information with chunking and dependency parsing. Finally, in
Section 5, we draw conclusions and propose directions for future work.

2 Related Work

It is widely acknowledged that good MWE processing strategies are necessary for NLP systems to work
effectively (Sag et al., 2002), since these kinds of word combinations are very frequent in both text and
speech. It is estimated that the number of MWEs in an English speaker’s vocabulary is of the same order
of magnitude as that of single words (Jackendoff, 1997), and that at least one MWE is used per sentence
on average (Sinclair, 1991).

Various classifications of MWEs have been proposed, employing different criteria to match the re-
quirements of a particular kind of target application. Some researchers propose a binary categorisation
of literal and non-literal word combinations (Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Cook et al., 2008), whereas oth-
ers propose a grading containing several MWE types based on semantic idiomaticity, considered as a
continuum (Wulff, 2008). Within the Meaning-Text Theory, collocations are sorted according to the
notion of lexical functions (Mel’ćuk, 1998), that is, taking into account how the component words are
semantically related. Furthermore, some experiments have investigated automatic methods—such as dis-
tributional similarity or word embeddings—for the task of classification, leading to fairly good results
(Baldwin et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Fazly et al., 2007; Rodrı́guez-Fernández et al., 2016).

In addition to MWE classification, a great deal of work has been undertaken over the last two decades
on MWE acquisition (Ramisch, 2015) and identification (Li et al., 2003; Seretan and Wehrli, 2009;
Sporleder and Li, 2009). Precise and detailed syntactic information is crucial for both tasks, and, at the
same time, MWE identification can also help parsers obtain better results (Seretan, 2013). Moreover,
accurate MWE detection is crucial for MT, since MWEs vary greatly from one language to another,
and are not usually translated word for word. In the context of MT systems, Wehrli (2014) states “the
non-identification of collocations dramatically affects the quality of the output”.

3 Linguistic Analysis

The linguistic analysis we present here aims at improving MWE processing in MT. More specifically,
we base our study on Matxin (Mayor et al., 2011), a rule-based MT system for English-Basque and

2Whereas English (Germanic) and Spanish (Romance) are Indo-European languages, Basque is a non-Indo-European lan-
guage which moreover belongs to no known language family.

Spanish-Basque translation. One of the problems Matxin has concerning MWEs is that it currently fails
to detect many instances of morphologically flexible word combinations, since it only searches for word
sequences against entries in a lexicon.

As mentioned in Section 1, our study foccusses on one particular kind of MWE: verb+noun combina-
tions (VNCs). As well as the principal constituents of a verb and a noun, we also allow for combinations
containing a preposition and/or a determiner in between. Candidate combinations were first gathered
from machine-readable dictionaries and were then searched for in corpora, the most frequent combina-
tions being selected for detailed analysis.

More details about the procedure for selecting the combinations are given in the following subsections,
as well as explanations of a manual tagging process, the criteria used to classify the combinations, and
the overall results and conclusions drawn from this analysis. How this information is used for VNC
identification is explained in Section 4.

3.1 Selection of Verb+Noun Combinations

The Spanish combinations for this study were extracted from the Elhuyar Spanish-Basque dictionary3,
and the corpus used to obtain frequency information was made up of 491,853 sentences taken from a
Spanish-Basque parallel corpus containing a range of text genres. A total of 150 distinct VNCs were
selected, each of which occurred more than five times as a word sequence in the corpus.

For English, our original intention was to extract combinations from the Elhuyar English-Basque
dictionary, in part because the Basque translations would be useful for the translation process in the MT
system. However, the dictionary contained too few combinations for this study, so instead we decided to
use the Oxford Collocations Dictionary (Deuter, 2008). After extracting the combinations matching our
grammatical pattern, we searched for them in the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2007). If the verb
and the noun (and the preposition, when necessary) were found as main elements in adjacent chunks
more than 500 times, the combination was selected. The final set consisted of 173 combinations in all.

3.2 Tagging Process

The combinations were tagged manually and classified along lexico-semantic and morphosyntactic di-
mensions, as discussed in the next sections. Although annotators looked at corpora to take decisions, the
tagging was not done on instances in a corpus but on combinations out of sentential context. Therefore,
each annotator gave each combination a single tag per task.

The lexico-semantic classification was done for two reasons: to determine which combinations were
worth detecting and which ones should not be treated as MWEs, and because making groups depending
on the combinations’ idiomaticity was considered relevant for the later translation process. The mor-
phosyntactic data, on the other hand, was analysed to be used for VNC detection (Section 4).

The tagging was performed by five linguists, all of whom are Spanish native speakers and fluent in
English. Firstly, a ‘super-annotator’ tagged all the data, comprising a total of 323 distinct combinations
in Spanish and English. Then, the data were split in four parts, and a further four annotators each tagged
one of these parts, following the guidelines created for this purpose.

3.3 Lexico-Semantic Classification

The tags assigned by the annotators separated the combinations into four lexico-semantic groups, from
less to more idiomatic: (1) free expressions, (2) collocations and light verb constructions, (3) metaphoric
expressions, and (4) idioms. This was not an easy task, as the boundaries between one group and another
are not always clearly defined. Idiomaticity is rather understood as a continuum (Wulff, 2008), and some
combinations are very difficult to classify (we return to this point in Section 3.5).

Idioms (also called opaque expressions) are combinations in which the whole meaning cannot be
understood by looking at the meanings of the words separately. Two clear examples of these would be
the sentences in examples (5) and (6), which are impossible to interpret correctly without knowledge of

the figurative meaning of the expressions in italics.

(5) Do not believe her, she is just pulling your leg.
= Do not believe her, she is just joking.

(6) Ese chico no se corta un pelo, es un descarado.
‘That boy does not cut a hair, he is shameless.’
= That boy is never intimidated, he is shameless.

Metaphoric expressions are not used in their literal sense either, but it is possible to understand their
meaning in terms of a metaphor, as in examples (7) and (8).

(7) He did not come to the meeting and the boss had a word with him.
= He did not come to the meeting and the boss spoke with him.

(8) Las experiencias de ese tipo dejan huella.
‘These kinds of experiences leave (a) mark.’
= These kinds of experiences have a very significant effect (on people’s life).

Unlike the combinations in examples (5)–(8), those in examples (9) and (10) are easily understand-
able on the basis of their component words; they belong to the group of collocations and light verb
constructions. Collocations are defined as lexically constrained and recurrent combinations of words
which are in a given syntactic relation (Evert, 2008; Bartsch, 2004). When they are VNCs, the verb
is often a very common word which is semantically bleached—meaning that it loses its usual sense to
a certain extent (Butt, 2010). These kinds of combinations are called light verb constructions (LVCs).
Examples (9) and (10) would be classified in this group.

(9) Volunteers gave support to disadvantaged children.

(10) La educación tiene vital importancia para los niños desaventajados.
‘Education has vital importance for disadvantaged children.’

Finally, free expressions are groups of words that can be combined freely, that is, following the
standard lexical and grammatical rules of a given language. These kinds of expressions are not idiomatic,
and are thus not considered MWEs, as in examples (11) and (12). Therefore, the combinations sorted in
this group by the annotators were excluded for the later detection experiment (Section 4).

(11) They are using a new technique now.

(12) Este año iremos a un lugar diferente.
‘This year we will go to a different place.’

As mentioned in Section 3.2, we consider that classifying the VNCs is relevant for translation. Our
hypothesis is that the kind of translation a VNC should be given is often dependent on its lexico-semantic
class. For instance, the combinations we have analysed so far suggest that, although idioms are usually
translated by other (morphosyntactically equivalent or non-equivalent) idioms into the target language,
they are unlikely to receive a word-for-word translation (see example (13)). On the other hand, in collo-
cations, the noun is very likely to receive a direct translation, whereas the verb is often given a translation
other than the one expected when it is not part of the collocation (see example (14)).

(13) EN: pull (somebody)’s leg

ES: tomar el pelo (a alguien)
‘take (somebody)’s hair’

EU: (norbaiti) adarra jo

860



‘play (somebody) the horn’

(14) EN: take steps
ES: dar pasos

‘give steps’
EU: pausoak eman

‘give steps’

We will not focus on the correlation between VNC classes and their translation in this paper. However,
we do consider it an interesting topic for future investigation.

3.4 Morphosyntactic Classification

As well as the lexico-semantic tagging described above, we examined morphosyntactic features of com-
binations to classify them into three groups: (1) fixed combinations, (2) semi-fixed combinations, and
(3) morphosyntactically free combinations. The annotators had to consider five questions to determine
how fixed the combinations were:

• Does the noun phrase (NP) have a determiner? (always/never/optional)

• Is the NP singular or plural? (singular/plural/optional)

• Can there be a modifier (i.e. an adjective) inside the NP? (yes/no)

• Can the verb and the NP be separated by other words? (yes/no)

• Can the order of the elements be altered? (yes/no)

A given VNC needed to be classified as completely free when: the determiner and the number of the
NP were marked as optional; there could be a modifier inside the NP; the verb and the NP could be
separated by other words; and the order of the elements in the expression was judged to be alterable.
When some of the answers were different to these, the combination had to be marked as semi-fixed, and
as completely fixed if all the answers were different (that is, when the syntactic variability of the VNC
was completely restricted).

None of the combinations was tagged as fixed by both the super-annotator and the second annotator,
but this was not surprising, as VNCs which do not accept any kind of morphosyntactic variation are
extremely rare. Usually, they can undergo some alterations (semi-fixed expressions as in examples (15)
and (16)), or they can even be completely flexible (morphosyntactically free expressions as in exam-
ples (17) and (18)).

(15) be in love; be always in love; *be in the love; *be in loves.

(16) dar paso (a algo); dar siempre paso (a algo); *dar pasos (a algo)
‘give way (to sth); always give way (to sth); *give ways (to sth)’

(17) cause a problem; cause two important problems; the problem was caused

(18) hacer un favor; hacer un gran favor; hacer dos favores; el favor que se hizo
‘do a favour; do a big favour; do two favours; the favour that was done’

As these features have a direct impact on the detection of the combinations, the answers to the above-
mentioned questions were also specified by the super-annotator one by one, so that this information could
later be used to improve detection (see Section 4).

3.5 Inter-Annotator Agreement
Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was measured in two ways: the percentage of combinations in which
the annotators agreed, and Cohen’s Kappa, κ (Cohen, 1960).

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, annotator agreement was 70% to 84% for all tagging tasks and for both
languages. With κ scores between 0.55 and 0.63, we conclude that the task is coherent and that the
tagging results are usable for further investigation. The lexico-semantic IAA for English is similar to the
IAA obtained in previous related work (Fazly et al., 2007; Vincze, 2012), and for Spanish it is appreciably
higher.

Consistent with previous work (Seretan, 2013), we found that in our selection of 323 of the most
frequently occurring VNCs in Spanish and English, collocations and LVCs are the most common type
of combination, and that opaque expressions (idioms) are very scarce.

We also found that the combinations that led to disagreements among annotators were not classified in
random groups, but were almost always in classes lexico-semantically (and morphosyntactically) close
to each other (see Tables 3 and 4). Indeed, only a few combinations were classified in two groups that
were not directly adjacent on the idiomaticity continuum. This provides further evidence that MWEs
form a continuum of idiomaticity with no clear boundaries between MWE types (McCarthy et al., 2003).

4 Identification Experiment

To test whether the analysed morphosyntactic data (see Section 3.3) could improve MWE detection,
we undertook an experiment where three identification methods were combined and compared: (A)

862



the old one, used by Matxin, which searched only for word sequences; (B) a second one, based on the
analysed linguistic data and automatically-produced chunking information; and (C) a third one, based
on the analysed linguistic data and automatically-produced syntactic dependencies. Depending on how
morphosyntactically fixed a given combination was, more or less linguistic restrictions were applied to
identify them.

The experimental set was made of the combinations presented in Section 3, excluding the ones tagged
as completely free by the super-annotator (Section 3.3). The final set consisted of 117 combinations in
Spanish and 133 in English.

4.1 Results of the English Experiment

The corpus used for the experiment on English VNCs was the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2007),
and chunking and dependency information was computed by the Stanford parser (Manning et al., 2014).
A total of 152,051 occurrences of the 133 VNCs were identified by combining all three methods, 78.92%
of which were not detected by method A, currently used for English-Basque translation in Matxin. Figure
1 shows the percentages of all the instances detected by each of the methods.

Figure 1: Percentages of English VNC occurrences identified by each method. (For clarity, areas are not
drawn in scale with percentages)

We cannot calculate recall since our evaluation dataset contains only the occurrences identified col-
lectively by the three methods, and it is almost certain that some occurrences of the VNCs under inves-
tigation were not detected. For future work, we would need to use MWE-tagged corpora to calculate
recall, such as the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (Uresova et al., 2013). In any case,
the results obtained clearly show that the number of identified occurrences is increased considerably by
using linguistic data specific to VNCs, as well as confirming that VNCs are commonly used in multiple
morphosyntactic variations, as only 21.08% of the instances could be identified by searching for word
sequences against entries in a lexicon.

To estimate the precision of VNC detection, we considered a representative sample of the full set, and
evaluation was carried out manually by linguists. The precisions of methods B and C were not as good
as that of method A. However, the evaluation on instances identified by both B and C methods reveals
that detection quality is still very high when linguistic data specific to VNCs is combined with parsing
(the second row of scores in Table 5).

Additional VNCs % Precision
Method A (in all) 21.08% 99%
Method B+C but not A 62.81% 96%
Method B only 6.08% 70%
Method C only 10.03% 79%

Table 5: Identification precision for the additional VNC occurrences detected in English

The least satisfactory results were those obtained by method B. When verifying the results, we noticed
that the vast majority of false instances detected were light verb constructions (LVCs) containing verbs

863



that could also work as auxiliaries. In example (19), for instance, have influences is erroneously detected
since influence is mis-analysed as the object of have rather than the subject of have been likened.

(19) These influences have also been likened to the forces effected by a millenarian journey
to a new faith...

The overall improvement we obtained was substantial, as expected from previous work. Li et al.
(2003) report an F-score improvement of 9 percentage points (86.9% to 95.6%) when using parsers and
hand-crafted lexical patterns to identify phrasal verbs in English, as well as a precision improvement of
8 percentage points (90% to 98%). In our case, precision falls from 99% to 93% when combining all
three methods, but the number of new instances detected suggests an appreciable increase in recall. As
we already mentioned, MWE-annotated corpora would be needed to calculate recall and F-score and
compare our results to those reported by other authors.

4.2 Results of the Spanish Experiment
For the experiment on Spanish, VNCs were searched in 15,182,385 sentences taken from the parallel
English-Spanish corpus made public for the shared task in the ACL 2013 workshop on statistical MT4,
and the parser used was Freeling (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012). A total of 433,092 occurrences were
identified, 27.80% of which were not detected by method A (the percentages of the combinations iden-
tified by each method are shown in Figure 2). Consistent with the results obtained for English, this
further reveals that the morphosyntactic data we took into account (Section 3.4) is very relevant for VNC
identification.

Figure 2: Percentages of Spanish VNC ocurrences identified by each method

Furthermore, as well as the quantity improving considerably, the manual evaluation reveals that the
quality of our method is also very satisfactory. As is shown in Table 6, methods B and C, although not
as precise as method A, got very good precision scores.

Additional VNCs % Precision
Method A (in all) 72.20% 99%
Method B+C but not A 20.85% 97%
Method B only 4.12% 93%
Method C only 2.83% 83%

Table 6: Identification precision for the additional VNCs detected in Spanish

As the corpora and parsers we used were different for English and Spanish, the experiments in both
languages are not really comparable. However, it is evident that the improvement obtained for English
was considerably higher than the one obtained for Spanish. Taking into account that the Freeling and
Stanford parsers work in similar ways and that the manual tagging of the VNCs was done following the
same criteria, this difference could suggest that syntactic variations of VNCs other than the canonical
form are more common in English than in Spanish. One of the possible reasons for this could be the

4http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/translation-task.html

864



different word order inside NPs in both languages. In Spanish, adjectives can either precede or follow
the head noun, whereas in English adjectives are almost never placed after the noun: importantes pasos
or pasos importantes vs. important steps but not *steps important. An exhaustive analysis would be
needed to verify this hypothesis or identify other possible reasons.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

Morphosyntactically flexible MWEs constitute a problem for NLP systems, which often fail to process
these kinds of word combinations correctly. In this paper, we presented a linguistic analysis undertaken
with the aim of improving the identification of VNCs, as well as an experiment which shows how lin-
guistic data can improve identification results greatly.

Firstly, we classified a selection of frequent VNCs in English and Spanish, following both lexico-
semantic and morphosyntactic criteria. A total of 323 distinct combinations (173 in English and 150
in Spanish) were tagged by several annotators, with very reasonable inter-annotator agreement scores
(κ 0.55 to 0.63). We noted moreover that the combinations that led to disagreements among annotators
were always tagged in groups that were lexico-semantically and morphosyntactically close to each other,
which gives further evidence that idiomaticity should be viewed as a continuum. More detailed mor-
phosyntactic information was also specified for each combination, and this information was then used to
improve VNC identification.

Our experiment confirmed that specific linguistic data about VNCs is useful for the identification
of this kind of word combination, as it allows for the recognition of occurrences that do not match a
combination’s canonical form. Indeed, a large number of instances that were not identified by searching
for fixed word sequences could be identified by combining linguistic data with chunking information and
syntactic dependencies, with fairly good precision scores (79% to 97%).

Building on the satisfactory results obtained, we will test our methods in the context of MT, and we
will keep analysing more VNCs. The next step will be to explore what kind of data is needed for an
adequate translation of VNC combinations within MT systems. In addition, we intend to investigate how
semantic information can be used within the translation process.
