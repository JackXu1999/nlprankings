Abstract

Estimation of the semantic relatedness be-
tween biomedical concepts has utility for
many informatics applications. Automated
methods fall into two broad categories: meth-
ods based on distributional statistics drawn
from text corpora, and methods based on the
structure of existing knowledge resources. In
the former case, taxonomic structure is disre-
garded. In the latter, semantically relevant em-
pirical information is not considered. In this
paper, we present a method that retrofits the
context vector representation of MeSH terms
by using additional linkage information from
UMLS/MeSH hierarchy such that linked con-
cepts have similar vector representations. We
evaluated the method relative to previously
published physician and coder’s ratings on
sets of MeSH terms. Our experimental re-
sults demonstrate that the retrofitted word vec-
tor measures obtain a higher correlation with
physician judgments. The results also demon-
strate a clear improvement on the correlation
with experts’ ratings from the retrofitted vec-
tor representation in comparison to the vector
representation without retrofitting.

1 Introduction

Groups of semantically similar concepts and terms
are known to improve the retrieval (Rada et al.,
1989) and clustering (Lin et al., 2007) of biomed-
ical and clinical documents, and the development
of biomedical terminologies and ontologies (Bo-
denreider and Burgun, 2004). However, auto-
mated estimation of semantic similarity remains
a challenge. Most semantic similarity measures

leverage the structure of an ontology or taxonomy
(e.g. WordNet, Unified Medical Language Sys-
tem (UMLS)/Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)) to
calculate, for example, the shortest path informa-
tion between concept nodes (Pedersen et al., 2007;
Caviedes and Cimino, 2004). Vector representa-
tions based on a co-occurrence matrix from a cor-
pus has also been used to calculate the relatedness
between concepts (Pedersen et al., 2007; Pedersen
et al., 2004). Others use information content (IC)
to estimate the semantic similarity and relatedness
between two concepts, which incorporate the proba-
bility of the concept occurring in a corpus (Caviedes
and Cimino, 2004; Ciaramita et al., 2008; Turney,
2005). Some topic modeling techniques (Blei et al.,
2003; Yu et al., 2013) have also been applied to in-
tegrate the automatically generated themes (topics)
from a specific corpus to the controlled vocabulary
that indexed within this corpus to help improve the
document retrieval and clustering performances (Yu
et al., 2016).

In this paper, we introduce a new semantic
similarity measure utilizing both vector space
word representations and a biomedical taxonomy
(UMLS/MeSH) to determine the degree of semantic
similarity between pairs of concepts. For two
concepts, we first learn their vector space word
representations from distributional information of
words in a large domain-relevant corpus. Although
such vectors are semantically informative, they
disregard the valuable information contained in
semantic lexicons such as WordNet, FrameNet,
and the Paraphrase Database. In 2014, Faruqui, et
al. (Faruqui et al., 2014a) developed a ”retrofitting”

43



method that addresses this limitation by incorporat-
ing information from such semantic lexicons into
word vector representations, such that semantically
linked words will have similar vector representa-
tions. We applied this technique to word vector
representations of UMLS/MeSH concepts in an
effort to improve their quality. We evaluated the
method relative to previously published human
expert similarity ratings of a Physician and Coder
on sets of MeSH terms. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the retrofitted word vector sim-
ilarity measures have a higher correlation with
Physician (but not Coder) judgments, compared
with other existing techniques. The results also
demonstrate a clear improvement on the correlation
with experts’ ratings from the retrofitted vector
representation to the vector representation without
retrofitting.

2 Related Work

There are two major classes of semantic similar-
ity measurement methods. The most common class
uses an ontology or taxonomy to calculate the short-
est path between two concepts. Rada, et al. (Rada
et al., 1989) introduces the measure of conceptual
distance to quantify the similarity between concepts
in the UMLS. Wu and Palmer (Wu and Palmer,
1994) extend this measure by calculating the length
of shortest path between two concepts that con-
nects the concepts through their least common sub-
sumer (LCS). The LCS is the most specific an-
cestor shared by two concepts. In 2005, Nguyen
and Al-Mubaid (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006) pro-
posed a new path-based measure using is − a rela-
tion in MeSH. They incorporate both the depth and
LCS in their measure. In their results, they com-
pared with the measures introduced by Leacock &
Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), Wu &
Palmer (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and the Path mea-
sure. Batet, et al. (Batet et al., 2011) introduce
a measure that incorporates the common concepts
shared between the two concepts and their LCS. Re-
cently, McInnes, et al. (McInnes et al., 2014) intro-
duced U-path measure using undirected path to de-
termine the degree of semantic similarity between
two concepts in a dense taxonomy with multiple in-

heritance. In 2009, McInnes, et al. (McInnes et al.,
2009) presented a UMLS-Similarity tool which con-
tains five semantic similarity measures proposed by
Rada, et al. (Rada et al., 1989) , Wu & Palmer (Wu
and Palmer, 1994), Leacock & Chodorow (Lea-
cock and Chodorow, 1998), and Nguyen & Al-
Mubaid (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006), and the
Path measure.

The second class of techniques uses training cor-
pora and information content (IC) to estimate the
semantic similarity between two concepts. IC mea-
sures the specificity of a concept in a hierarchy. The
IC-based measures account for the probability of the
concept occurring in a corpus. A concept with a high
IC value is more specific to a topic than one with a
low IC value. Resnik (Resnik, 1995), Jiang & Con-
rath (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) and Lin (Lin, 1998),
all have published works on the IC-based similarity
measures. Resnik (Resnik, 1995) measures the simi-
larity between two concepts by finding the IC of the
LCS of the two concepts. Jiang & Conrath (Jiang
and Conrath, 1997) and Lin (Lin, 1998) extended
Resnik‘s IC-based measure by incorporating the IC
of the individual concepts. Jiang & Conrath mea-
sure similarity by finding the IC of each individual
concept and of the LCS of them. However, Lin‘s
measure is similar to that of Wu & Palmer (Wu and
Palmer, 1994), where depth is replaced by informa-
tion content.

Context vector metrics based on distributional
statistics have also been used to calculate semantic
similarity (Patwardhan, 2006; Patwardhan, 2003).
By building co-occurrence vectors that represent the
contextual profile of concepts, the relatedness be-
tween concepts can then be calculated using co-
sine similarity between vectors corresponding to two
given concepts (Pedersen et al., 2007).

Though IC-based measures do draw upon distri-
butional information, this is used in a very restricted
way to determine the specificity of a concept. Con-
text vector metric-based distributional statistics do
not have such limitations on the use of distributional
information. However, the taxonomic structure is
not taken into account in distributional methods.
“Correlation with human pairwise judgment” eval-
uation is widely used in computational linguistics.
There are a number of evaluation sets exist in the
biomedical domain. ‘MayoSRS’, developed by

44



Pakhomov, et al. (Pakhomov et al., 2011), consists
of 101 clinical term pairs whose relatedness was
determined by nine medical coders and three
physicians from the Mayo Clinic. In this paper,
we used ‘MiniMayoSRS,’ a subset of ‘MayoSRS.’
The average correlation between physicians is
0.68. The average correlation between medical
coders is 0.78 (Pedersen et al., 2007). ‘UMNSRS’,
developed by Pakhomov, et al. (Pakhomov et al.,
2010), consists of 725 clinical term pairs whose
semantic similarity and relatedness was determined
independently by four medical residents from the
University of Minnesota Medical School.

3 Method

In this section, we provide a brief description of the
method used for retrofitting word vector to semantic
lexicons, present the design of our work flow,
describe the test data and the semantic lexicon we
created , and also present the evaluation measures
we used.

3.1 Retrofitting Word Vector to Semantic
Lexicons

Vector space word representations are a critical com-
ponent of many natural language processing sys-
tems. It is common to represent words as discrete
indices in a vocabulary, but this fails to capture the
rich relational structure of the human semantic lex-
icon (Maas et al., 2011). Retrofitting is a simple
and effective method to improve word vectors us-
ing word relation knowledge found in semantic lexi-
cons. It is used as a post-processing step to improve
vector quality (Faruqui et al., 2014a).

Figure 1 shows a small word graph example with
edges connecting semantically related words. The
words, cancer, tumor, neoplasm, sarcoma, and
swelling, are similar words to each other in a lex-
ical knowledge resource. Grey nodes are observed
word vectors built from the corpus, which are in-
dependent of each other. White nodes are inferred
word vectors, waiting to be retrofitted. The edge be-
tween each pair of white nodes means they are sim-
ilar words to each other. The inferred word vector
(e.g., q tumor) is expected to be close to its cor-

responding observed word vector (e.g., qˆ tumor)
and close to its synonym neighbors (e.g., q cancer
and q neoplasm). The objective is to minimize the
following:

Ψ(Q) =
n∑

i=1

[αi ‖qi − q̂ i‖2 +
∑

(i,j)∈E
βij ‖qi − qj‖2]

(1)
where α and β values control the relative strengths
of associations, Q is the retrofitted vectors, and
(i, j) ∈ E means there is an edge between node
qi and qj. Ψ is convex in Q. An efficient iterative
updating method is used to find this convex. First,
retrofitted vectors in Q are initialized to be equal to
the observed vectors. The next step is to take the
first derivative of Ψ with respect to qi vector and use
the following to update it online.

qi =

∑
j:(i,j)∈E βijqj + αiq̂ i∑

j:(i,j)∈E βij + αi
(2)

It takes approximately 10 iterations to converge
to the difference in Euclidean distance of adjacent
nodes of less than 0.01 in practice. An implementa-
tion of this algorithm has been published online by
the authors (Faruqui et al., 2014b). We used this im-
plementation in the current work.

served (grey node), inferred (white node).

documents from PubMed. In our test data, each con-
cept is mapped to MeSH term(s) (Please see details
in the paragraph Test Data of this section.) We then
randomly fetch 1000 citations indexed with those
MeSH term(s) from PubMed. In the Build Word Vec-
tors step, we build each MeSH term a word vector
using the approach described in (Yu et al., 2016).
We use titles and abstracts of returned citations and
only select those MeSH terms indexed in more than
100 citations as our candidate semantic lexicon. The
main MeSH term mapped from the input concept is
indexed in all 1000 citations. The retrofitted vector
quality suffers if we take into account MeSH terms
that appear in a small number of citations. For each
selected MeSH term, we collect all the words from
the citations indexed with that MeSH term. After re-
moving the stop words, We use tf-idf (Equation 3)
to weight the remaining words and then normalize
the weights so that they sum to one. In Create Se-
mantic Lexicons, we use both the UMLS-similarity
tool developed by McInnes, et al. (McInnes et al.,
2009) and the MeSH tree structure as the source
from which it estimates semantic relatedness. For
details see the paragraph Semantic Lexicons in this
section. Retrofitting Word Vectors retrofits the word
vectors using the created semantic lexicons to gen-
erate new word vectors. We then calculate cosine
similarity (Equation 4) based on the concepts pair’s
new word vectors. On account of the stochastic na-
ture of the literature sampling, we test each pair of
concepts five times and average performance over
these five times as its final similarity score.

3.3 Test Data
We used the set of 30 concept pairs from Pedersen,
Pakhomov, and Patwardhan (2005) (Pedersen et al.,
2007), which was annotated by 3 physicians and 9
medical index coders. Each pair was annotated on
a 4 point scale: “practically synonymous, related,
marginally, and unrelated“. Table 1 displays the de-
tails of these concepts pairs along with both ratings.

Neguyen and Al-Mubaid use 25 out of the 30
pairs of terms in the dataset. 5 pairs of terms (high-
lighted in both table 1 and table 2) were excluded be-
cause they did not exist in MeSH version 2006. To
make it comparable with their results, we also use
these 25 pairs of terms. The mappings of the terms
to MeSH terms were obtained firstly by using the on-
line MetaMap tool (Aronson and Lang, 2010). Then
we used the MeSH browser 2016 (MeSH, 2016) to
get the most updated MeSH terms.

3.4 Semantic Lexicons
We tested two semantic lexicons in our experi-
ments. The first is from the results of McInnes,
et al.’s UMLS-Similarity tool (McInnes et al.,
2009). UMLS-Similarity contains five semantic
similarity measures proposed by Rada, et al. (Rada
et al., 1989), Wu & Palmer (wup) (Wu and
Palmer, 1994), Leacock & Chodorow (lch) (Leacock
and Chodorow, 1998), and Nguyen & Al-Mubaid
(nam) (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006), and the Path
measure. Leacock & Chodorow’s measure achieved
best performance among these five semantic similar-
ity measures. In our experiment, we used this mea-

sure in UMLS-Similarity to calculate the similar-
ity score between each selected MeSH term and the
main MeSH term. We calculated the average of all
these scores as the threshold. We then chose those
MeSH terms whose scores are over this threshold as
the main MeSH term’s semantic lexicon terms. The
second semantic lexicon is constructed using MeSH
tree structure information. For each main MeSH
term, we chose its parents and child terms from the
MeSH tree as its lexicon terms.

3.5 Evaluation

In our experiment, we used three types of vector
representations to calculate the semantic similarity:
MeSH term word vectors without retrofitting;
MeSH term word vectors retrofitted with UMLS-
Similarity results; and MeSH term word vectors
retrofitted using the MeSH tree structure. We rank
the 25 pairs of terms based on similarity scores
and calculate the correlation between our rankings
and the Physician and Coder judgments using the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient. We compare
our correlation results with those reported by
Nguyen, et al. (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006) and

ods and the judgments made by physicians and
coders, as well as the results reported by Nguyen,
et al. (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006) and McInnes,
et al. (McInnes et al., 2009), using the UMLS-
Similarity tool.

From Table 3, we can see our retrofitted vec-
tor representation with UMLS-Similarity obtains
a highest correlation with the Physician judg-
ments. Though our retrofitted vector representation
achieved a lower correlation with the Coder judg-
ments than the results reported by Nguyen and Al-
Mubaid (Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006), we still
see an improvement from the retrofitted vector rep-
resentations as compared with the original vector
representation without retrofitting. Since UMLS-
Similarity’s results are lower than our vector repre-
sentations, it is understandable that our retrofitted
vector representations still can not surpass the re-
sults achieved by Nguyen and Al-Mubaid‘s method.
From Table 3, we can also see that our vector repre-
sentations obtain lower correlations with the coder
judgments than with the physician judgments. This
contrasts with both the UMLS-Similarity results and
those reported by Nguyen and Al-Mubaid. We be-
lieve that the reason for this phenomenon is that the
coder group were more familiar with the ontology
or taxonomy than the physician group. When re-

viewing these pairs of concepts, coders may inter-
pret the terms in relation to the ontology or taxon-
omy, whereas physicians may be more likely to un-
derstand them at a broader contextual level. Be-
cause our vector representation methods all origi-
nated as context vectors, this may explain why our
methods achieved higher correlation with physician
judgments.

Among the three types of vector representa-
tions, the retrofitted vector representation with
UMLS-Similarity had a higher correlation with both
physician and coder judgments than the vectors
retrofitted using the MeSH tree structure. We be-
lieve this occurred because the way we created the
semantic lexicon from the MeSH tree structure had a
limited effect on the original vector representations.
From Table 2, we can see that the semantic lexicon
based on the MeSH tree structure only affected 10
of 25 pairs of terms. The semantic lexicon based
on UMLS-Similarity results affected 16 of 25 pairs
of terms. We used the MeSH term’s parents and
children as the lexicon terms, and it is unlikely for
a PubMed article to be indexed with both parent
and child terms. The UMLS-Similarity approach is
more permissive. Two MeSH terms are accepted as
a lexicon term only when they have above-threshold
similarity as estimated by path-based measures.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we introduced a semantic similarity
measure that utilizes vector word representation and
the linkage information in an ontology or taxonomy.
By retrofitting vector representations with additional
ontology or taxonomy information, we can gener-
ate vector representations in which lexically-linked
concepts are more likely to have similar vector rep-
resentations. This leads to better approximation of
human judgments on the task of estimating seman-
tic relatedness. We show that our method obtains
a higher correlation with physician judgments than
UMLS-Similarity, and previously reported results.
We also demonstrate a clear improvement from the
retrofitted vector representation as compared to the
vector representation without retrofitting. In the
future we plan to expand this technique to other
knowledge sources and datasets. We also plan to
use more sophisticated and better established ap-
proaches to generate concept vectors, e.g. methods
of distributional semantic (Cohen et al., 2010), word
embedding (Mikolov et al., 2013), and compare
with more recently evaluations using neural network
based similarity and relatedness measures (Pakho-
mov et al., 2016).
