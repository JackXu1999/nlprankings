Abstract

Document date is essential for many
important tasks, such as document re-
trieval, summarization, event detection,
etc. While existing approaches for these
tasks assume accurate knowledge of the
document date, this is not always avail-
able, especially for arbitrary documents
from the Web. Document Dating is a
challenging problem which requires infer-
ence over the temporal structure of the
document. Prior document dating sys-
tems have largely relied on handcrafted
features while ignoring such document-
internal structures. In this paper, we pro-
pose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) based document dating
approach which jointly exploits syntactic
and temporal graph structures of docu-
ment in a principled way. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first applica-
tion of deep learning for the problem of
document dating. Through extensive ex-
periments on real-world datasets, we find
that NeuralDater significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute
(45% relative) accuracy points.

1 Introduction

Date of a document, also referred to as the Doc-
ument Creation Time (DCT), is at the core of
many important tasks, such as, information re-
trieval (Olson et al., 1999; Li and Croft, 2003;
Dakka et al., 2008), temporal reasoning (Mani and
Wilson, 2000; Llidó et al., 2001), text summariza-
tion (Wan, 2007), event detection (Allan et al.,
1998), and analysis of historical text (de Jong
et al., 2005a), among others. In all such tasks, the
document date is assumed to be available and also

bitrary documents from the Web. Thus, there is
a need to automatically predict the date of a docu-
ment based on its content. This problem is referred
to as Document Dating.

Initial attempts on automatic document dating
started with generative models by (de Jong et al.,
2005b). This model is later improved by (Kan-
habua and Nørvåg, 2008a) who incorporate addi-
tional features such as POS tags, collocations, etc.
Chambers (2012) shows significant improvement
over these prior efforts through their discrimina-
tive models using handcrafted temporal features.

Document dating is a challenging problem

which requires extensive reasoning over the tem-
poral structure of the document. Let us moti-
vate this through an example shown in Figure 1.
In the document, four years after plays a crucial
role in identifying the creation time of the docu-
ment. The existing approaches give higher confi-
dence for timestamp immediate to the year men-
tion 1995. NeuralDater exploits the syntactic and
temporal structure of the document to predict the
right timestamp (1999) for the document. With the
exception of (Chambers, 2012), all prior works on
the document dating problem ignore such infor-
mative temporal structure within the document.

Research in document event extraction and or-
dering have made it possible to extract such tem-
poral structures involving events, temporal ex-
pressions, and the (unknown) document date in
a document (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016; Chambers
et al., 2014). While methods to perform reason-
ing over such structures exist (Verhagen et al.,
2007, 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013; Llorens et al.,
2015; Pustejovsky et al., 2003), none of them have
exploited advances in deep learning (Krizhevsky
et al., 2012; Hinton et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al.,
2016). In particular, recently proposed Graph
Convolution Networks (GCN) (Defferrard et al.,
2016; Kipf and Welling, 2017) have emerged as a

way to learn graph representation while encoding
structural information and constraints represented
by the graph. We adapt GCNs for the document
dating problem and make the following contribu-
tions:

• We propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolu-
tion Network (GCN)-based approach for doc-
ument dating. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first application of GCNs, and more
broadly deep neural network-based methods,
for the document dating problem.

• NeuralDater is the first document dating ap-
proach which exploits syntactic as well tem-
poral structure of the document, all within a
principled joint model.

• Through extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets, we demonstrate Neu-
ralDater’s effectiveness over state-of-the-art
baselines.

NeuralDater’s source code and datasets used
in the paper are available at http://github.

tend this work by incorporating semantic-based
preprocessing and temporal entropy (Kanhabua
and Nørvåg, 2008b) based term-weighting. Cham-
bers (2012) proposes a MaxEnt based discrimina-
tive model trained on hand-crafted temporal fea-
tures. He also proposes a model to learn proba-
bilistic constraints between year mentions and the
actual creation time of the document. We draw
inspiration from his work for exploiting temporal
reasoning for document dating. Kotsakos et al.
(2014) propose a purely statistical method which
considers lexical similarity alongside burstiness
(Lappas et al., 2009) of terms for dating docu-
ments. To the best of our knowledge, NeuralDater,
our proposed method, is the first method to utilize
deep learning techniques for the document dating
problem.

Event Ordering Systems: Temporal ordering
of events is a vast research topic in NLP. The
problem is posed as a temporal relation classifi-
cation between two given temporal entities. Ma-
chine Learned classifiers and well crafted linguis-
tic features for this task are used in (Chambers
et al., 2007; Mirza and Tonelli, 2014). D’Souza
and Ng (2013) use a hybrid approach by adding
437 hand-crafted rules. Chambers and Jurafsky
(2008); Yoshikawa et al. (2009) try to classify with
many more temporal constraints, while utilizing
integer linear programming and Markov logic.

CAEVO, a CAscading EVent Ordering archi-
tecture (Chambers et al., 2014) use sieve-based ar-
chitecture (Lee et al., 2013) for temporal event or-
dering for the first time. They mix multiple learn-
ers according to their precision based ranks and
use transitive closure for maintaining consistency
of temporal graph. Mirza and Tonelli (2016) re-
cently propose CATENA (CAusal and TEmporal
relation extraction from NAtural language texts),
the first integrated system for the temporal and
causal relations extraction between pre-annotated
events and time expressions. They also incorpo-
rate sieve-based architecture which outperforms
existing methods in temporal relation classifica-
tion domain. We make use of CATENA for tem-
poral graph construction in our work.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN):
GCNs generalize Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) over graphs. GCN is introduced by (Bruna
et al., 2014), and later extended by (Defferrard
et al., 2016) with efficient localized filter approx-

imation in spectral domain. Kipf and Welling
(2017) propose a first-order approximation of lo-
calized filters through layer-wise propagation rule.
GCNs over syntactic dependency trees have been
recently exploited in the field of semantic-role
labeling (Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017), neural
machine translation (Bastings et al., 2017a), event
detection (Bastings et al., 2017b). In our work,
we successfully use GCNs for document dating.

3 Background: Graph Convolution
Networks (GCN)

In this section, we provide an overview of Graph
Convolution Networks (GCN) (Kipf and Welling,
2017). GCN learns an embedding for each node of
the graph it is applied over. We first present GCN
for undirected graphs and then move onto GCN
for directed graph setting.

3.1 GCN on Undirected Graph

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph, where V
is a set of n vertices and E the set of edges. The
input feature matrix X ∈ Rn×m whose rows are
input representation of node u, xu ∈ Rm, ∀u ∈ V .
The output hidden representation hv ∈ Rd of a
node v after a single layer of graph convolution
operation can be obtained by considering only the
immediate neighbors of v. This can be formulated
as:

hv = f

 ∑
u∈N (v)

(Wxu + b)

 , ∀v ∈ V.
Here, model parameters W ∈ Rd×m and b ∈ Rd
are learned in a task-specific setting using first-
order gradient optimization. N (v) refers to the set
of neighbors of v and f is any non-linear activa-
tion function. We have used ReLU as the activa-
tion function in this paper1.

In order to capture nodes many hops away, mul-
tiple GCN layers may be stacked one on top of an-
other. In particular, hk+1v , representation of node
v after kth GCN layer can be formulated as:

hk+1v = f

 ∑
u∈N (v)

(
W khku + b

k
) , ∀v ∈ V.

where hku is the input to the k
th layer.

1ReLU: f(x) = max(0, x)

3.2 GCN on Labeled and Directed Graph
In this section, we consider GCN formulation over
graphs where each edge is labeled as well as di-
rected. In this setting, an edge from node u to
v with label l(u, v) is denoted as (u, v, l(u, v)).
While a few recent works focus on GCN over di-
rected graphs (Yasunaga et al., 2017; Marcheg-
giani and Titov, 2017), none of them consider la-
beled edges. We handle both direction and label by
incorporating label and direction specific filters.

Based on the assumption that the information
in a directed edge need not only propagate along
its direction, following (Marcheggiani and Titov,
2017) we define an updated edge set E ′ which ex-
pands the original set E by incorporating inverse,
as well self-loop edges.

E ′ = E ∪{(v, u, l(u, v)−1) | (u, v, l(u, v)) ∈ E}
∪ {(u, u,>) | u ∈ V)}. (1)

Here, l(u, v)−1 is the inverse edge label corre-
sponding to label l(u, v), and > is a special empty
relation symbol for self-loop edges. We now de-
fine hk+1v as the embedding of node v after k

th

GCN layer applied over the directed and labeled
graph as:

hk+1v = f

 ∑
u∈N (v)

(
W kl(u,v)h

k
u + b

k
l(u,v)

) .
(2)

We note that the parameters W kl(u,v) and b
k
l(u,v)

in this case are edge label specific.

3.3 Incorporating Edge Importance
In many practical settings, we may not want to
give equal importance to all the edges. For exam-
ple, in case of automatically constructed graphs,
some of the edges may be erroneous and we may
want to automatically learn to discard them. Edge-
wise gating may be used in a GCN to give im-
portance to relevant edges and subdue the noisy
ones. Bastings et al. (2017b); Marcheggiani and
Titov (2017) used gating for similar reasons and
obtained high performance gain. At kth layer,
we compute gating value for a particular edge
(u, v, l(u, v)) as:

gku,v = σ
(
hku · ŵkl(u,v) + b̂

k
l(u,v)

)
,

where, σ(·) is the sigmoid function, ŵkl(u,v) and
b̂kl(u,v) are label specific gating parameters. Thus,

gating helps to make the model robust to the noisy
labels and directions of the input graphs. GCN
embedding of a node while incorporating edge
gating may be computed as follows.

hk+1v = f

 ∑
u∈N (v)

gku,v ×
(
W kl(u,v)h

) .
4 NeuralDater Overview

The Documents Dating problem may be cast as a
multi-class classification problem (Kotsakos et al.,
2014; Chambers, 2012). In this section, we
present an overview of NeuralDater, the document
dating system proposed in this paper. Architec-
tural overview of NeuralDater is shown in Figure
2.

NeuralDater is a deep learning-based multi-
class classification system. It takes in a document
as input and returns its predicted date as output by
exploiting the syntactic and temporal structure of
document.

NeuralDater network consists of three layers
which learns an embedding for the Document Cre-
ation Time (DCT) node corresponding to the doc-
ument. This embedding is then fed to a soft-
max classifier which produces a distribution over
timestamps. Following prior research (Chambers,
2012; Kotsakos et al., 2014), we work with year
granularity for the experiments in this paper. We
however note that NeuralDater can be trained for
finer granularity with appropriate training data.
The NeuralDater network is trained end-to-end us-
ing training data. We briefly present NeuralDater’s
various components below. Each component is de-
scribed in greater detail in subsequent sections.

• Context Embedding: In this layer, Neu-
ralDater uses a Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-
LSTM) to learn embedding for each token in
the document. Bi-LSTMs have been shown
to be quite effective in capturing local context
inside token embeddings (Sutskever et al.,
2014).

• Syntactic Embedding: In this step, Neural-
Dater revises token embeddings from previ-
ous step by running a GCN over the depen-
dency parses of sentences in the document.
We refer to this GCN as Syntactic GCN or
S-GCN. While the Bi-LSTM captures imme-
diate local context in token embeddings, S-



1609

GCN augments them by capturing syntactic
context.

• Temporal Embedding: In this step, Neu-
ralDater further refines embeddings learned
by S-GCN to incorporate cues from temporal
structure of event and times in the document.
NeuralDater uses state-of-the-art causal and
temporal relation extraction algorithm (Mirza
and Tonelli, 2016) for extracting temporal
graph for each document. A GCN is then run
over this temporal graph to refine the embed-
dings from previous layer. We refer to this
GCN as Temporal GCN or T-GCN. In this
step, a special DCT node is introduced whose
embedding is also learned by the T-GCN.

• Classifier: Embedding of the DCT node
along with average pooled embeddings
learned by S-GCN are fed to a fully con-
nected softmax classifier which makes the fi-
nal prediction about the date of the document.

Even though the previous discussion is pre-
sented in a sequential manner, the whole network
is trained in a joint end-to-end manner using back-
propagation.

5 NeuralDater Details

In this section, we present detailed description of
various components of NeuralDater.

5.1 Context Embedding (Bi-LSTM)

Let us consider a document D with n tokens
w1, w2, ..., wn. We first represent each token by
a k-dimensional word embedding. For the exper-
iments in this paper, we use GloVe (Pennington
et al., 2014) embeddings. These token embed-
dings are stacked together to get the document
representation X ∈ Rn×k. We then employ a
Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997) on the input matrix X to ob-
tain contextual embedding for each token. After
stacking contextual embedding of all these tokens,
we get the new document representation matrix
Hcntx ∈ Rn×rcntx . In this new representation,
each token is represented in a rcntx-dimensional
space. Our choice of LSTMs for learning con-
textual embeddings for tokens is motivated by the
previous success of LSTMs in this task (Sutskever
et al., 2014).

5.2 Syntactic Embedding (S-GCN)

While the Bi-LSTM is effective at capturing im-
mediate local context of a token, it may not be as
effective in capturing longer range dependencies
among words in a sentence. For example, in Fig-
ure 1, we would like the embedding of token ap-
proved to be directly affected by govt, even though
they are not immediate neighbors. A dependency
parse may be used to capture such longer-range
connections. In fact, similar features were ex-
ploited by (Chambers, 2012) for the document dat-
ing problem. NeuralDater captures such longer-
range information by using another GCN run over
the syntactic structure of the document. We de-
scribe this in detail below.

The context embedding, Hcntx ∈ Rn×rcntx
learned in the previous step is used as input to
this layer. For a given document, we first extract
its syntactic dependency structure by applying the
Stanford CoreNLP’s dependency parser (Manning
et al., 2014) on each sentence in the document in-
dividually. We now employ the Graph Convolu-
tion Network (GCN) over this dependency graph
using the GCN formulation presented in Section
3.2. We call this GCN the Syntactic GCN or S-
GCN, as mentioned in Section 4.

Since S-GCN operates over the dependency
graph and uses Equation 2 for updating embed-
dings, the number of parameters in S-GCN is di-
rectly proportional to the number of dependency
edge types. Stanford CoreNLP’s dependency
parser returns 55 different dependency edge types.
This large number of edge types is going to sig-
nificantly over-parameterize S-GCN, thereby in-
creasing the possibility of overfitting. In order to
address this, we use only three edge types in S-
GCN. For each edge connecting nodes wi and wj
in E ′ (see Equation 1), we determine its new type
L(wi, wj) as follows:

• L(wi, wj) =→ if (wi, wj , l(wi, wj)) ∈ E ′,
i.e., if the edge is an original dependency
parse edge

• L(wi, wj) =← if (wi, wj , l(wi, wj)−1) ∈ E ′,
i.e., if the edges is an inverse edge

• L(wi, wj) = > if (wi, wj ,>) ∈ E ′, i.e., if
the edge is a self-loop with wi = wj

S-GCN now estimates embedding hsynwi ∈ Rrsyn
for each token wi in the document using the for-



1610

mulation shown below.

hsynwi = f

(∑
wj∈N (wi)

(
WL(wi,wj)h

cntx
wj + bL(wi,wj)

))

Please note S-GCN’s use of the new edge types
L(wi, wj) above, instead of the l(wi, wj) types
used in Equation 2. By stacking embeddings for
all the tokens together, we get the new embedding
matrix Hsyn ∈ Rn×rsyn representing the docu-
ment.

AveragePooling: We obtain an embedding havgD
for the whole document by average pooling of ev-
ery token representation.

havgD =

5.3 Temporal Embedding (T-GCN)

In this layer, NeuralDater exploits temporal struc-
ture of the document to learn an embedding for the
Document Creation Time (DCT) node of the doc-
ument. First, we describe the construction of tem-
poral graph, followed by GCN-based embedding
learning over this graph.

Temporal Graph Construction: NeuralDater
uses Stanford’s SUTime tagger (Chang and Man-
ning, 2012) for date normalization and the event
extraction classifier of (Chambers et al., 2014) for
event detection. The annotated document is then
passed to CATENA (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016),
current state-of-the-art temporal and causal rela-
tion extraction algorithm, to obtain a temporal
graph for each document. Since our task is to pre-
dict the creation time of a given document, we
supply DCT as unknown to CATENA. We hy-
pothesize that the temporal relations extracted in
absence of DCT are helpful for document dating
and we indeed find this to be true, as shown in
Section 7. Temporal graph is a directed graph,
where nodes correspond to events, time mentions,
and the Document Creation Time (DCT). Edges in
this graph represent causal and temporal relation-
ships between them. Each edge is attributed with
a label representing the type of the temporal rela-
tion. CATENA outputs 9 different types of tempo-
ral relations, out of which we selected five types,
viz., AFTER, BEFORE, SAME, INCLUDES, and
IS INCLUDED. The remaining four types were
ignored as they were substantially infrequent.

Please note that the temporal graph may involve
only a small number of tokens in the document.

APW 675k 1995 2010
NYT 647k 1987 1996

Table 1: Details of datasets used. Please see Section 6 for
details.

For example, in the temporal graph in Figure 2,
there are a total of 5 nodes: two temporal expres-
sion nodes (1995 and four years after), two event
nodes (adopted and approved), and a special DCT
node. This graph also consists of temporal rela-
tion edges such as (four years after, approved, BE-
FORE).

Temporal Graph Convolution: NeuralDater
employs a GCN over the temporal graph con-
structed above. We refer to this GCN as the Tem-
poral GCN or T-GCN, as mentioned in Section
4. T-GCN is based on the GCN formulation pre-
sented in Section 3.2. Unlike S-GCN, here we
consider label and direction specific parameters as
the temporal graph consists of only five types of
edges.

Let nT be the number of nodes in the temporal
graph. Starting with Hsyn (Section 5.2), T-GCN
learns a rtemp-dimensional embedding for each
node in the temporal graph. Stacking all these em-
beddings together, we get the embedding matrix
Htemp ∈ RnT×rtemp . T-GCN embeds the tempo-
ral constraints induced by the temporal graph in
htempDCT ∈ Rrtemp , embedding of the DCT node of
the document.

5.4 Classifier

Finally, the DCT embedding htempDCT and average-
pooled syntactic representation havgD (see Equation
3) of document D are concatenated and fed to a
fully connected feed forward network followed by
a softmax. This allows the NeuralDater to exploit
context, syntactic, and temporal structure of the
document to predict the final document date y.

p(y|D) = Softmax(W · havg+tempD + b).

6 Experimental Setup

Datasets: We experiment on Associated Press
Worldstream (APW) and New York Times (NYT)
sections of Gigaword corpus (Parker et al., 2011).
The original dataset contains around 3 million



1611

documents of APW and 2 million documents of
NYT from span of multiple years. From both
sections, we randomly sample around 650k doc-
uments while maintaining balance among years.
Documents belonging to years with substantially
fewer documents are omitted. Details of the
dataset can be found in Table 1. For train, test and
validation splits, the dataset was randomly divided
in 80:10:10 ratio.

Evaluation Criteria: Given a document, the
model needs to predict the year in which the docu-
ment was published. We measure performance in
terms of overall accuracy of the model.

Baselines: For evaluating NeuralDater, we
compared against the following methods:

• BurstySimDater Kotsakos et al. (2014):
This is a purely statistical method which uses
lexical similarity and term burstiness (Lappas
et al., 2009) for dating documents in arbitrary
length time frame. For our experiments, we
took the time frame length as 1 year. Please
refer to (Kotsakos et al., 2014) for more de-
tails.

• MaxEnt-Time-NER: Maximum Entropy
(MaxEnt) based classifier trained on
hand-crafted temporal and Named Entity
Recognizer (NER) based features. More
details in (Chambers, 2012).

• MaxEnt-Joint: Refers to MaxEnt-Time-
NER combined with year mention classifier
as described in (Chambers, 2012).

• MaxEnt-Uni-Time: MaxEnt based discrim-
inative model which takes bag-of-words rep-
resentation of input document with normal-
ized time expression as its features.

• CNN: A Convolution Neural Network
(CNN) (LeCun et al., 1999) based text
classification model proposed by (Kim,
2014), which attained state-of-the-art results
in several domains.

• NeuralDater: Our proposed method, refer
Section 4.

Hyperparameters: By default, edge gating
(Section 3.3) is used in all GCNs. The parameter
K represents the number of layers in T-GCN (Sec-
tion 5.3). We use 300-dimensional GloVe embed-
dings and 128-dimensional hidden state for both

7 Results

7.1 Performance Comparison

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Neu-
ralDater, our proposed method, we compare it



1612

against existing document dating systems and text
classification models. The final results are sum-
marized in Table 2. Overall, we find that Neu-
ralDater outperforms all other methods with a
significant margin on both datasets. Compared
to the previous state-of-the-art in document dat-
ing, BurstySimDater (Kotsakos et al., 2014), we
get 19% average absolute improvement in accu-
racy across both datasets. We observe only a
slight gain in the performance of MaxEnt-based
model (MaxEnt-Time+NER) of (Chambers, 2012)
on combining with temporal constraint reasoner
(MaxEnt-Joint). This may be attributed to the
fact that the model utilizes only year mentions in
the document, thus ignoring other relevant signals
which might be relevant to the task. BurstySim-
Dater performs considerably better in terms of pre-
cision compared to the other baselines, although
it significantly underperforms in accuracy. We
note that NeuralDater outperforms all these prior
models both in terms of precision and accuracy.
We find that even generic deep-learning based text
classification models, such as CNN (Kim, 2014),
are quite effective for the problem. However,
since such a model doesn’t give specific attention
to temporal features in the document, its perfor-
mance remains limited. From Figure 3, we ob-
serve that NeuralDater’s top prediction achieves
on average the lowest deviation from the true year.

7.2 Ablation Comparisons

For demonstrating the efficacy of GCNs and BiL-
STM for the problem, we evaluate different ab-
lated variants of NeuralDater on the APW dataset.
Specifically, we validate the importance of us-
ing syntactic and temporal GCNs and the effect
of eliminating BiLSTM from the model. Over-
all results are summarized in Table 3. The first
block of rows in the table corresponds to the case
when BiLSTM layer is excluded from Neural-
Dater, while the second block denotes the case
when BiLSTM is included. We also experiment
with multiple stacked layers of T-GCN (denoted
by K) to observe its effect on the performance of
the model.

We observe that embeddings from Syntactic
GCN (S-GCN) are much better than plain GloVe
embeddings for T-GCN as S-GCN encodes the
syntactic neighborhood information in event and
time embeddings which makes them more relevant
for document dating task.

Figure 4: Evaluating performance of different methods on
dating documents with and without time mentions. Please
see Section 7.3 for details.

Overall, we observe that including BiLSTM
in the model improves performance significantly.
Single BiLSTM model outperforms all the mod-
els listed in the first block of Table 3. Also, some
gain in performance is observed on increasing the
number of T-GCN layers (K) in absence of BiL-
STM, although the same does not follow when
BiLSTM is included in the model. This observa-
tion is consistent with (Marcheggiani and Titov,
2017), as multiple GCN layers become redundant
in the presence of BiLSTM. We also find that elim-
inating edge gating from our best model deterio-
rates its overall performance.

In summary, these results validate our thesis
that joint incorporation of syntactic and temporal
structure of a document in NeuralDater results in
improved performance.

7.3 Discussion and Error Analysis
In this section, we list some of our observations
while trying to identify pros and cons of Neural-
Dater, our proposed method. We divided the de-
velopment split of the APW dataset into two sets
– those with and without any mention of time ex-
pressions (year). We apply NeuralDater and other
methods to these two sets of documents and re-
port accuracies in Figure 4. We find that overall,
NeuralDater performs better in comparison to the
existing baselines in both scenarios. Even though
the performance of NeuralDater degrades in the
absence of time mentions, its performance is still
the best relatively. Based on other analysis, we
find that NeuralDater fails to identify timestamp
of documents reporting local infrequent incidents
without explicit time mention. NeuralDater be-
comes confused in the presence of multiple mis-
leading time mentions; it also loses out on docu-
ments discussing events which are outside the time
range of the text on which the model was trained.
In future, we plan to eliminate these pitfalls by



1613

incorporating additional signals from Knowledge
Graphs about entities mentioned in the document.
We also plan to utilize free text temporal expres-
sion (Kuzey et al., 2016) in documents for improv-
ing performance on this problem.

8 Conclusion

We propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) based method for document dat-
ing which exploits syntactic and temporal struc-
tures in the document in a principled way. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first applica-
tion of deep learning techniques for the problem of
document dating. Through extensive experiments
on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of NeuralDater over existing state-of-the-
art approaches. We are hopeful that the representa-
tion learning techniques explored in this paper will
inspire further development and adoption of such
techniques in the temporal information processing
research community.
