Abstract

Statistical Machine Translation has come a
long way improving the translation quality
of a range of different linguistic phenom-
ena. With negation however, techniques pro-
posed and implemented for improving transla-
tion performance on negation have simply fol-
lowed from the developers’ beliefs about why
performance is worse. These beliefs, however,
have never been validated by an error analysis
of the translation output. In contrast, the cur-
rent paper shows that an informative empiri-
cal error analysis can be formulated in terms
of (1) the set of semantic elements involved
in the meaning of negation, and (2) a small
set of string-based operations that can char-
acterise errors in the translation of those ele-
ments. Results on a Chinese-to-English trans-
lation task confirm the robustness of our anal-
ysis cross-linguistically and the basic assump-
tions can inform an automated investigation
into the causes of translation errors. Conclu-
sions drawn from this analysis should guide
future work on improving the translation of
negative sentences.

1 Introduction

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in
improving the quality of SMT systems over a wide
range of linguistic phenomena, including corefer-
ence resolution (Hardmeier et al., 2014) and modal-
ity (Baker et al., 2012). Amongst these, however,
translating negation is still a problem that has not
been researched thoroughly.

This paper takes an empirical approach towards

understanding why negation is a problem in SMT.
More specifically, we try to answer two main ques-
tions:

1. What kind of errors are involved in translating
negation?

2. What are the causes of these errors during de-
coding?

While previous work (section 2) has shown that
translating negation is a problem, it has not ad-
dressed either of these questions.

The present paper focuses on the first one; we
show that tailoring to a semantic task, string-based
error categories standardly used to evaluate the qual-
ity of the machine translation output, allows us
to cover the wide range of errors occurring while
translating negative sentences (section 3). We re-
port the results of the analysis of a Hierarchical
Phrase Based Model (Chiang, 2007) on a Chinese-
to-English translation task (section 4), where we
show that all error categories occur to some extent
with scope reordering being the most frequent (sec-
tion 5).

Addressing question (2) requires connecting the
assumptions behind this manual error analysis to er-
rors occurring along the translation pipeline. As
such, we complete the analysis by briefly introduce
an automatic method to investigate the causes of the
errors at decoding time (section 6).

Conclusion and future works are reported in sec-
tion 7 and 8.



2 Previous Work

In recent years, automatic recognition of negation
has been the focus of considerable work. Follow-
ing Blanco and Moldovan (2011) and Morante and
Blanco (2012) detecting negation is a task of unrav-
eling its structure, i.e. locating in a text its four main
components:

• Cue: the word or multi-word unit inherently
expressing negation (e.g. ‘He is not driving a
car’)

• Event: the lexical element the cue directly
refers to (e.g. ‘He is not driving a car’)

• Scope: all the elements whose falsity would
prove negation to be false; given that the cue is
not included, the scope is often discontinuous
(e.g. ‘He is not driving a car’)

• Focus: the portion of the statement negation
primarily refers to (e.g. ‘He is not driving
a car).

The *SEM 2012 shared task represented a first at-
tempt to apply machine learning methods to the
problem of automatically detect the aforementioned
elements in English. In particular CRFs and SVMs,
making use of syntactic (both constituent and de-
pendency based) clues, were shown to lead to the
best results in a supervised machine learning setting
(Read et al., 2012; Chowdhury and Mahbub, 2012).
The shared task also saw the release of a fully an-
notated corpus in the literature domain, which rep-
resents, along with the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et
al., 2008), the only resource specifically annotated
for negation.

There were also a few attempts in automatically
detecting negation in Chinese texts. Li et al. (2008)
designed a negation detection algorithm based on
syntactic patterns; similarly, Zheng et al. (2014)
implemented an FSA for automatic recognition of
negation structures in Chinese medical texts, using a
list of manually defined cues and the syntactic struc-
tures they appear in.

In a bilingual setting such as the SMT, however,
most work has only considered negation as a side
problem. For this reason, no actual analysis on the
type of errors involved in translating negation or

their causes has been specifically carried out. The
standard approach has been to formulate an hypoth-
esis about what can go wrong when translating nega-
tion, modify the SMT system in a way aimed at re-
ducing the number of times that happens, and then
assume that any increase in BLEU score - the stan-
dard automatic evaluation metric used in SMT - con-
firms the initial hypothesis. Collins et al. (2005)
and Li et al. (2009) consider negation, along with
other linguistic phenomena, as a problem of struc-
tural mismatch between source and target; Wetzel
and Bond (2012) consider it instead as a problem of
training data sparsity; finally Baker et al. (2012) and
Fancellu and Webber (2014) consider it as a model
problem, where the system needs enhancement with
respect to the semantics of negation. Given that
all these works assess the quality of translation of
negative sentences using an n-gram overlap metric,
there is no certainty whether any improvement de-
rives from a better rendering of negation or from
other, non-negation related elements.

Evaluating the semantic adequacy of the SMT
output has also stimulated interest in recent years.
Traditional error categories, such as the ones pre-
sented in (Vilar et al., 2006), are mostly based on
n-gram overlap between hypothesis and reference
and so are the most widely used automatic evalu-
ation metrics used in SMT (e.g. BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2009)). In
contrast, MEANT (Lo and Wu, 2010, 2011) and its
human counterpart, HMEANT, attempt to abstract
from simple string matching and assess the degree of
semantic similarity between machine output and ref-
erence sentence. To do so, both sides are annotated
using Propbank-like semantic labels, and the fillers
matched if both sides contain the same event. To as-
sign a score to the test set evaluated, an F1 measure
over precision and recall of matched fillers is then
computed.

3 Methodology

3.1 Manual Annotation

First, we start with the assumption that negation is a
language independent semantic phenomenon which
can be defined as a structure. This assumption im-
plies that it should be possible to annotate any lan-
guage using the elements in this structure – cue,



event and scope. Isolating a small set of seman-
tic elements involved in the construction of negation
is useful in the context of SMT to reduce negation
into tangible elements at the string level. Moreover
each of the three elements above represents differ-
ent translation problems: if, for instance, translating
the cue mainly involves ensuring the presence of a
negation marker, translating the scope involves in-
stead ensuring that semantic elements are translated
in the right domain and most of the times, around
the negated event.

We carried out the annotation of cue, event and
scope on both the source Chinese sentences and the
correspondent translation output by the SMT sys-
tem, following the guidelines released during the
SEM* 2012 shared task (Morante et al., 2011). To
our understanding, this is the first work that applies
these guidelines to a language other than English.
It is however worth noticing that while these guide-
lines were released with the goal in mind of auto-
matically extracting information from text, with a
particular emphasis on factuality, the present work
focuses on translation, where each negation instance
is taken into consideration as potential source of er-
ror. This leads to some differences in the annotation
process, especially in the case of the event:

1. While the original guidelines do not annotate
negation scoping on non-factual events, such
as in conditional clauses (‘if he doesn’t come,
I will blame you’), the demands of translation
require it to be annotated.

2. While the original guidelines do not include
modals or auxiliaries in the event annotation (in
order to minimise the number of annotated ele-
ments), getting these elements correct in trans-
lation is needed to distinguish a correct vs. par-
tially correct event (cf. section 3.2).

3. For the same reason as (2), the event in a nom-
inal predicate includes all its modifiers.

4. All these points apply to Chinese as well; in ad-
dition, in the case of resultative constructions
(e.g. fù bù qĭ lit. ‘pay not lift-RES.’, ‘could not
pay, can not afford’) we considered the resulta-
tive particle as part of the event.

With respect to scope, the current work makes a
simple approximation: scope is often discontinu-
ous, with multiple semantic units whose translations
might impact the overall translation of the scope dif-
ferently. To facilitate error analysis we approximate
the scope in terms of its constituent semantic fillers,
here taken to be Propbank-like semantic arguments.
In doing so, we consider the scope as the semantic
domain of negation, where the constituent elements
are expected to remain in its boundaries and to pre-
serve their semantic role (or take an equivalent one)
during translation.

Example (1) illustrates our annotation scheme
over the first instance of bù (not) in a Chinese source
sentence.

As shown in (1) the scope around the first main
clause can be split into two arguments - a subject
and an object - around the verb páichú(rule out) so
error analysis can be carried on each individually.
We instead consider the second instance of bù/not
as ‘non-functional negation’ and do not annotate it
since it is just part of the question and does not con-
stitute itself a negation instance.

3.2 Manual Error Analysis

A subsequent task is to define categories that are
able to cover potential errors in translating negation.
Our analysis aims at applying a small set of string-
based operations traditionally used in SMT to the
aforementioned elements of negation. We consider
three main operations and apply them to each of the
three elements of negation for a total of 9 main con-
ditions:



• Deletion: one of the three sub-constituents of
negation is present in the source Chinese sen-
tence but not in the machine output. This corre-
sponds to the missing words category in (Vilar
et al., 2006).

• Insertion: the negation element is not present
in the source sentence but has been inserted
in the machine output. This resembles the ex-
tra words sub-category in the incorrect words
class.

• Reordering: whether the element has been
moved outside its scope. Since some seman-
tic elements can also move inside the scope and
take a role which they did not have in the orig-
inal source sentence, we define the former re-
ordering error as out-of-scope reordering error
and the latter intra-scope reordering error. The
reordering category represents an adaptation of
the original word order category.

Since we are not concerned with errors regarding
style, punctuation or unknown words, other opera-
tions were left aside.

For a better understanding at when during the
translation process (a.k.a. the decoding process) and
why the error occurs, we also investigated the trace
of rules used to build the 1-best machine output.
This is particularly useful in the case of deletion:
this may occur because a certain Chinese word or
sequence of Chinese words (generally referred in
SMT as phrases) has not been seen during training
(so called out-of-vocabulary items - OOVs) and the
system is therefore unable to translate them.

After the elements of negation have been an-
notated in both the source sentences and machine
outputs, we use the same heuristic as (H)MEANT
(Lo and Wu, 2011) to decide whether a translated
unit is correct or partially correct. We also consider
correct translations that are synonyms of the source
negation element since they are taken to convey the
same meaning. This also includes those elements
that are negated in the source but are rendered in
the machine output by means of a lexical element
inherently expressing negation (e.g. fails) or by
paraphrase into positive (e.g. bù tóng, lit. ‘not
similar’→ different). We consider partially correct
translated elements that do not contain errors which

impact the overall meaning. In the case of the event,
this might be related to tense agreement or wrong
modality, whilst in the case of the scope it is usually
related to the fact that secondary elements are not
translated correctly but the overall meaning is still
preserved.

As in HMEANT, we compute precision, recall
and F1 measure using the following formulae
where e ∈ E = {cue,event,filler}. However, unlike
HMEANT, we do not normalise the number of
correct fillers by the number of total fillers in the
predicate.

4 System

We carried out the error analysis on the output of
the Chinese-to-English hierarchical phrase based
system submitted by the University of Edinburgh
for the NIST12 MT evaluation campaign.

Hierarchical phrase-based (or HPB) systems are a
class of SMT systems that use syntax-like rules and
hierarchical tree structures to build an hypothesis
translation given a test source sentence and a model
previously trained on a bilingual corpora. Unlike
pure syntax models, HPBMs do not make use of
syntactic constituent tags for non-terminals but
instead use an X as placeholder for recursion. A
rule used in a Hierarchical Phrase based system
looks like the following,

ne veux plus X1→ do not want X1 anymore

where the French source (also referred to as
the left hand side - LHS of the rule) and the English
target side (the right hand side - RHS) allows arbi-
trary insertion of another rule where the placeholder
X is located.

The system was trained on approximately 2.1
million length-filtered segments in the news domain,
with 44678806 tokens on the source and 50452704
on the target, with MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel,



2008) used for alignment. The system was tuned
using MERT (Minimal Error Rate Training, (Och,
2003)) on the NIST06 set.

Two different test sets were considered to assess
differences that might be associated with genre:
the NIST MT08 test set, containing data from the
newswire domain and the IWSLT14 tst2012 test
set, containing transcriptions of TED talks. We
hypothesise that the difference in genre can influ-
ence the kinds of negation related error occurring
during translation: as a collection of planned spoken
inspirational talks, we expect the IWSLT’14 test set
to contain shorter sentences, and on average, more
instances of negation. On the contrary, we expect
the NIST MT08, where data are from the written
language domain, to contain longer sentences and
fewer instances of negation.

In order to carry out future work on the effect of
word segmentation on the elements on negation,
we built two different systems (and therefore rule
tables), one from data segmented using the LDC-
WordSegmenter and the other using the Stanford
Word Segmenter. The former matches the segmen-
tation of the NIST08 test set, whilst the latter the
one of the IWSLT14 test set.

Out of the 1397 segments in the IWSLT2014 set
and the 1357 segments in the NIST MT08 set, 250
sentences for each set were randomly chosen to
carry out the manual evaluation.

5 Results

5.1 Manual Analysis

5.1.1 NIST MT08
The results of the manual evaluation for the NIST

MT08 test set are reported in Table 1. It can be
easily seen that getting the cue right is easier than
translating event and scope correctly. The cue is in
fact usually a one-word unit and related errors con-
cern almost entirely whether the system has deleted
it during translation or not. Event and scope instead
are usually multi-word units whose correctness also
depends on whether they interact correctly with the
other negation elements.

In those cases where the cues were deleted during
translation, the trace shows that they were all caused
by a rule application that does not contain negation
on the English right hand side. Also worth notic-

ing is that, in these cases, the negation cue in the
source side is lexically linked to the event (‘bùshăo’
, ‘not few, many’) or lexically embedded in it (e.g.
‘dé bùdao, ‘cannot obtain’). No cases of cues be-
ing deleted were found where the cue is a distinct
unit. Also, no cases of cues were found of cues be-
ing deleted because of not being seen during training
(out-of-vocabulary items).

Other cue-related errors involve the cue being re-
ordered with respect to scope. In one case, cue re-
ordering happens within the same scope, where the
cue is moved from the main clause to the subordi-
nate. In three other cases, the cue is instead trans-
lated outside its source scope and attached to a dif-
ferent event. The two cases are exemplified in (2)
and (3) respectively.

As for the translation of events, a trend similar to
the translation of cues can be observed, although
the percentage of deletions is higher than the cue.
The trace shows that in 3 out of 11 cases, deletion
is caused by an OOV item, i.e. a Chinese phrase
which is not seen in training and for which the sys-
tem has not learned any translation. The remaining
cases resemble the cue case, insofar as no rule con-
tains the target side event. Another problem arising
with events is that some fillers in the source might
have erroneously become events in the machine out-
put and vice versa; we found 3 events on the source
becoming fillers in the target and 7 fillers on the



source becoming events in the machine output, as
shown in (4).

The fact that most of reordering errors are filler-
related is connected to the lack of semantic-related
information during the translation process, a com-
mon problem in machine translation systems. Since
there is no explicit guidance as to which events the
fillers should be attached to and in what order, in-
scope and out-of-scope problems are to be expected.

Around 10% of filler-related errors were caused
by deletion. An investigation of the trace shows
that in all 9 cases, the system has knowledge of the
source words in the rule table but has applied a rule
that does not contain the filler on the target side.

Finally, in the case of fillers, we notice that 2 of
the incorrect fillers in the hypothesis were due to the
insertion in the scope of fillers not present in the
source side. The trace shows that this kind of error
is generated by rules that contain on the right hand
side extra material not related to the source side. We
hypothesised that these rules might have been cre-
ated during training where English words that did
not correspond to any Chinese source words were
arbitrarily added to neighbouring phrases. For in-
stance, in (5) a rule that translates yĭzhı̀yú (‘to the
extent of’) into ‘to the extent of they’ is used, adding
a filler to following negation scope.

5.1.2 IWSLT ’14 Tst2012 TED Talks

Results for the TED talks test set are reported in
Table 2. It can be observed that results on all three
categories are better than the NIST08 test set, in
particular for the F1 measure of correct events and
scope. A reduction in the percentage of reordered
fillers on the overall number translation errors might
be connected to the fact that on average sentences
in the TED talk, also given their domain, are shorter
than the sentences in the NIST08 test set and there-
fore there is less chance of operating long range re-
ordering.

We can also observe that genre has an effect on
the number of negation cues; despite sentences be-
ing shorter, we found more negative instances in the
TED talks.

As for the errors in the NIST08 test set, we anal-
ysed the trace output after the completion of the
translation process to see whether deletions were
caused by incorrect rule application or by the pres-
ence of OOV items not seen during training. Out of
7 cases of cue deletion, 3 of event deletion and 5 of
filler deletion, only one was caused by the presence
of an OOV vocabulary item in the source. However,
as shown in (6), the OOV error is generated by a
wrong segmentation of two elements in the source,
bùzhī and zĕnme, which end up being collapsed in a
single word unit.

This seem to exclude OOV items as a problem in
translating negation for the present system and what
we are left with is a problem of negative elements
not correctly reproduced on the target side of the
rules.

Finally, we have found two cases of insertion, one
cue and the other event related. Overall, cases of
insertion are rare and do not constitute a real prob-
lem for the system here considered. In general, as
for event and scope, a rule application that does not
contain one of these two elements on the Chinese
left hand side but inserts it in the English right hand
side might be just fortuitous. As in the case of (5), it
might have been that a rule containing extra material
was preferred because a better fit in that specific con-
text (a LM score is in fact part of the scoring func-
tion of a SMT system). Insertion of the cue deserves
instead a better investigation. The results shows that
deletion is sometimes associated with rules whose
Chinese (left-hand) side contains a cue whilst the
English side does not. This is most certainly caused
by the training process where rules are extracted ac-
cording to what portion of the source Chinese sen-
tence is aligned to what portion in the target English
sentence. If an Chinese sentence contains negation
but the English does not, a rule learnt from that pair
might learn that a negation cue corresponds to some-
thing positive. This should theoretically happen the
other way around and if so, the application of these
rules should lead to insertion. Further analysis of the
rule table and the sentences used in training might
clarify this point.

6 Towards An Automatic Error Analysis

This manual error analysis assesses the quality of
the 1-best translation output by the system. More
can be done: (i) we can determine which component
of the system is responsible for each error so as to
know where to intervene and (ii) we can automate

the whole process of error finding. Both actions can
be referred to as automatic error analysis, given that
they rely on (semi-)automatic method to analyse er-
rors in translating negation, although they differ in
the scope of their analysis: (i) represents an exten-
sion of the manual error analysis, whilst (ii) aims at
automating it.

Although out of the scope of the present work, we
briefly sketch our current work on (i) whilst leaving
(ii) for future work. The reason for this is because
the assumption behind this as many other manual
analysis, i.e. that a small set of string-based error
categories can be used to characterise different kind
of translation errors (here semantic), can be easily
projected in the automatic error analysis. Moreover,
the importance and indispensability of a manual er-
ror analysis is highlighted when devising an auto-
matic error analysis. This is obvious in the case of
(i), where, in order to find the causes of the errors,
we need to know what these are. However, even we
succeed in (ii) and we are able to spot errors auto-
matically, we still need a manual error analysis as
a benchmark to assess the quality of any automatic
method.

When we talk about detecting errors during de-
coding, we try to determine the reason why our sys-
tem is behaving differently to what we expect. These
expectations depends on the source side negation el-
ement processed at each step during decoding and
are closely linked to both the set of string-based er-



ror category and the set of negation sub-constituents
used in this manual error analysis:

1. The cue has to be translated correctly; no cue
deletion or insertion should occur.

2. The event has to be translated correctly; no
event deletion or insertion should occur.

3. The cue has to be connected to right event; no
cue or event reordering should occur.

4. The semantic arguments in the source scope
should be translated and reproduced in line
with the target language semantics; no dele-
tion, insertion or reordering of the semantic
fillers should occur.

An ideal system would meet all the above conditions
in translating negation in each cell of the decoding
chart1; if not, we have to inspect the decoding chart
trace and classify the errors occurred. The goal here
is to find which part of the translation system is re-
sponsible for each error category. There are three
main type of errors, each one connected to one com-
ponent of the translation pipeline:

• Induction errors, where the correct translation
for a given element is absent from the search
space. These errors depends on how many tar-
get translations are fetched from the rule table
when a given source span is translated (default
is 20). The more we consider, the more likely is
for the correct translation to be inserted in the
search space. The system component related to
this category is the rule table.

• Search errors, where the correct translation
fetched from the rule table disappears from the
search space before making it to the final cell,
due to pruning or other optimisation heuristics.
The system component responsible for this er-
ror is the search space.

• Model errors, where the system ranks bad
translations better than better translations. The
component responsible is the scoring function.

Induction errors occur when no negation element is
found in any hypothesis built in any of the chart cell;
search errors occur when, by enlarging the search
space, hypotheses meeting the expected conditions
that were previously absent from the chart are now
present; finally, model errors occur where hypothe-
sis meeting one or more expectation are present but
rank lower than the ones that do not.

Since these expectations are based on source side
elements we need a way to project source side nega-
tion elements into a target language; for expectation
(1) and (2), we are experimenting with two differ-
ent methods: (i) via an automatically extracted list
of potential cues and a bilingual dictionary enriched
with paraphrases; (ii) by extracting cues and events
from the multiple reference translations set. To en-
sure that expectation (3) and (4) are met we instead
use a dependency parse.

Preliminary results on the translation of the cue
alone (expectation (1)) in the NIST08 MT test set
shows that it is uniquely a problem of model er-
ror, where good hypotheses are ranked lower than
bad ones. A comparison between the scores of
good and bad hypotheses show, when the former are
not ranked properly, shows that it is the translation
model the main responsible for such bad ranking.

7 Conclusion

The present paper presents an analysis of the errors
involved in translating negation. We showed that it
is possible to build a clear and robust error analysis
using (1) the set of semantic elements involved in
the meaning of negation (cue, event and scope) and
(2) a sub-set of string-based operations traditionally
used in SMT error analysis (deletion, insertion and
reordering).

Results of a manual error analysis on a Chinese-
to-English output shows that this analysis is easily
portable to a language other than English and allows
us to cover a wide range of potential errors occur-
ring during translating. Our findings also show that
amongst the three elements of negation here consid-
ered, the scope is the most problematic and reorder-
ing is in general the most frequent error in Chinese-
to-English translation. In the case of deletion or
insertion of negation elements, we also found that
the errors are attributable to a rule application that



prefers positive translations over negative and are
therefore not caused by OOV items not seen during
training.

Using the assumptions and the results of the man-
ual error analysis, we also introduced an automatic
way to inspect the causes of the errors in the de-
coding chart trace. Preliminary results show that
the scoring function is the main responsible for cue
deletion errors observed.

We hope that the methodology and the results of
the present work can guide future work on improv-
ing the translation of negative sentences.

8 Future Work

In the present paper, we have successfully applied
the manual error analysis to the output of a Chinese-
to-English Hierarchical Phrase-based system. Fu-
ture work will extend this method to other language
pairs and different SMT systems. We in fact ex-
pect these two variables to impact the kind of er-
rors found in translation. Chinese and English are
in fact very similar in the way they express nega-
tion: adverbial negation is the most frequent way of
expressing negation (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011;
Fancellu and Webber, 2012); morphological nega-
tion (or affixal) or lexically embedded negation is
present in both languages and affect mainly adjec-
tives; events can be both nominal, verbal and ad-
jectival. If we however extend this analysis to a
language pair where negation is expressed through
different means (e.g. English and Czech), it is un-
likely we will find the same error distribution. More-
over, hierarchical phrase-based models are in fact
non-purely syntax driven methods that are able to
deal with high levels of reordering. That however
also means that (a) there is no concept of syntac-
tic constituent boundaries and (b) when reordering
is performed incorrectly there is a high degree of el-
ement scrambling. For this reason phrase-based sys-
tems (where reordering is limited) and syntax-based
systems (where an explicit knowledge of constituent
boundaries is present) are likely to yield different re-
sults.

Finally, this paper has only discussed manual
detection of translation errors involving negation.
Other ongoing work tries instead to automate this
process.
