Abstract

This paper focuses on the interaction of chains
of coreference identity with other types of re-
lations, comparing English and German data
sets in terms of language, mode (written vs.
spoken) and register. We first describe the
types of coreference and the chain features
analysed as indicators of textual coherence
and topic continuity. After sketching the fea-
ture categories under analysis and the methods
used for statistical evaluation, we present the
findings from our analysis and interpret them
in terms of the contrasts mentioned above. We
will also show that for some registers, coref-
erence types other than identity are of great
importance.

1 Introduction

This paper presents the findings from an empirical
analysis of different types of coreference chains in
a corpus of English and German written and spoken
registers. The motivation lying behind our study is
twofold.

First, our objective is to analyse the interac-
tion between typical relations of coreference iden-
tity and other relations in chains, e.g. type-
instance, part-whole, etc. Example (1) illustrates
a coreference chain consisting of the antecedent
town and anaphors expressed via It/it, and a lex-
ical chain with the elements town, Reigate, Lon-
don, village, place, Banstead, establishing relations
of type/(co-)instance (e.g. town – Reigate/London),
hyper-/hyponymy (place – village/town).

(1) I live in a town called Reigate. It’s between
London and the countryside which is quite
nice. It takes us about 25 minutes to get to
London on the train. I say it’s a town, it’s
more of a village. It’s quite small. It’s very
nice actually, it’s a nice place to live. And I
grew up in a place called Banstead which is
fairly close to Reigate.

We focus on the features of such chains, including
the type of the semantic relations, the distance be-
tween chain elements, the number of chains as well
as chain length. Hence, the focus is not on the formal
types of anaphors and antecedents but on the rela-
tions themselves. These features serve as indicators
of how coherence and topic continuity are overtly
expressed in texts.

Second, another aim of this study is to analyse
specific properties of textual coherence. The inten-
tion here is to see which factor plays a more impor-
tant role for variation in coherence: language (En-
glish vs. German), mode of production (written vs.
spoken) or register (political essays, interviews, pop-
ular scientific texts and fictional texts containing di-
alogues).

Knowledge about these coherence types may ad-
vance automatic multilingual coreference resolu-
tion, which is, however, beyond the scope of this
study.

2 Related Work

Most existing studies concentrate on the properties
of anaphors and antecedents only, describing their
structural and functional properties. Some of them,

23



mostly theoretical, e.g. (Ariel, 2001; Kibrik, 2011),
are related to the model of referential choice based
on the degree of referent salience. Algorithms de-
scribing the degree of salience were presented by
Hajičová et al. (2006); Lambrecht (1994), Strube &
Hahn (1999), etc.

There also exists a considerable amount of large-
scale annotated data for coreference, anaphoric re-
lations, event anaphora, bridging relations and so
on, compiled mostly for automatic anaphora resolu-
tion (MUC-6 (1995), MUC-7 (1997) or ACE NIST
(Doddington et al., 2004) and more recently CoNNL
2011 (Pradhan et al., 2011). However, most of these
corpora are monolingual and cannot be applied for
a multilingual analysis, as they do not contain com-
parable registers across languages. For instance, the
largest coreference corpus for English is OntoNotes
(Technologies, 2006) containing several genres. For
German, the TüBa-D/Z corpus (Telljohann et al.,
2012) was annotated with semantic and coreference
information, but contains newspaper texts only.

Besides, the number of studies that base their
analysis on corpora annotated with chains, e.g. as
described in (Zikánová et al., 2015; Lapshinova-
Koltunski and Kunz, 2014a) , is rather small in con-
trast to those just using the annotation of relations.
Yet, an extensive comparison from a multilingual
perspective is missing.

3 Phenomena under analysis

Our focus therefore is on the textual relations set up
in what we call chains in our study. A chain min-
imally consists of a tie between an anaphor and an
antecedent, yet many chains are larger and contain
several anaphors. We mainly distinguish two types
of chains: coreference chains and lexical chains.

The coreference chains in our framework not only
include relations of identity between entities, as be-
tween town and it in example (1) above, but also ab-
stract and situation anaphora as in (2), where That
refers to the underlined preceding clause.

(2) They may cry, and we find it very hard to
find out why ... That’s difficult.

The formal types of anaphors annotated in corefer-
ence chains are mainly function words (i.e. gram-
matical types of cohesion) and include personal

and possessive pronouns, demonstrative determin-
ers, demonstrative pronouns, the definite article,
and local and temporal adverbs (here, there, now,
then). The annotated antecedents may include NPs,
clauses, clause complexes (see example (2)) or even
larger textual chunks.

The lexical chains analysed in this study con-
tain lexical relations between nominal antecedents
and anaphors (nouns or nominal compounds), which
vary in terms of the semantic relation between the
chain elements. Relations include repetitions as be-
tween London - London, place - place, hyperonymy
as between place - town and place - village in ex-
ample (1) in Section 1 above and others. They are
comparable to what is called bridging or indirect
anaphora in the state-of-the-art literature.

Note that the two types of chains may interact
as in example (3), where coreference relations are
set up between the two grammatical anaphors (the
demonstrative pronoun this and the definite article
the) to the antecedent reward system. In addition, a
lexical relation of hyper-/hyponymy holds between
this system (hyperonym) and a relation of repetition
between the system and this antecedent.

(3) Neurobiologists have long known that the
euphoria induced by drugs of abuse arises
because all these chemicals ultimately boost
the activity of the brain’s reward system: a
complex circuit of nerve cells, or neurons,
that evolved to make us feel flush after eat-
ing or sex... At least initially, goosing this
system makes us feel good... But new re-
search indicates that chronic drug use in-
duces changes in the structure and function
of the system’s neurons...

The chain features of coreference and lexical cohe-
sion analysed in this study include: 1) chain length
concerns the number of elements in a coreference
or a lexical chain; 2) chain number concerns the
number of different coreference and lexical chains
per text; 3) chain distance is the distance in to-
kens between different elements in the same chain.
4) semantic relation is the type of semantic relation
between adjacent chain elements. The types anal-
ysed in this study are: 1) identity, for all elements
in a coreference chain; and all kinds of other re-

24



lations, namely: 2) repetition, 3) antonym, 4) syn-
onym, 5) hyperonym, hyponym and cohyponym,
6) holonym, meronym, comeronym, 7) type, in-
stance, coinstance. Apart from analysing each of
these features separately we also study their inter-
action.

4 Methods and resources

4.1 Research questions

The chain features described in Section 3 indicate
how coherence is created and how and to which de-
gree topics are distributed throughout the texts. For
instance, we may find long coreference chains in
combination with a small distance between the re-
spective chain elements. This points to high topic
continuity in terms of certain referents. Further-
more, topic continuity within one domain is ex-
pressed by long lexical chains with small distance
between elements. Small chains and low distance in
combination with a high number of different chains
hints at a high degree of topic variation, i.e. that
text producers often jump from one topic to another.
By contrast, long chains and high distances between
elements indicates topic interaction i.e. that there
are several important topics which are interwoven.
Moreover, repetition in combination with corefer-
ence points to low semantic variation whereas re-
lations of lexical cohesion such as type-instance and
meronymy point to high variation.

We are additionally interested in which contrasts
are more pronounced, those concerning language,
mode or register (see Section 1) and which of the
analysed features mainly contribute to these con-
trasts.

4.2 Data

For the research aims within this study, we use a
data set containing texts of both written and spoken
discourse. The written part was extracted from the
corpus described in (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2012),
whereas the spoken subcorpus was extracted from
the corpus described in (Lapshinova-Koltunski et al.,
2012). The whole corpus is annotated on various
linguistic levels, including parts-of-speech (POS),
chunks, clauses, sentences, and various devices of
cohesion, i.e. coreference, discourse relations, el-
liptical constructions and substitution annotated as

described by Lapshinova & Kunz (2014b)1. Rela-
tions of coreference other than identity (synonymy,
antonymy, hyponymy, etc.) were annotated for the
subset of the data analysed in this study. The regis-
ters included are political essays (ESSAY), popular-
scientific articles (POPSCI), fictional excerpts (FIC-
TION) and transcribed interviews (INTERVIEW).
ESSAY and POPSCI represent written discourse,
INTERVIEW represents spoken discourse, whereas
FICTION is on the borderline, as it contains both
written and spoken elements in the form of dia-
logues. INTERVIEW and FICTION additionally
share narrative elements. The details on the anal-
ysed subset are provided in Table 1.

4.3 Visualisation techniques

We use various techniques to investigate the distri-
butional characteristics of subcorpora in terms of oc-
currences of the features described in Section 3 and
to answer the questions in Section 4.1.

Box plots are used to visualise a summary of the
distribution underlying a particular sample and to
compare central measure values and spread of the
data across groups. Special attention is given to
the median (second quartile) and the IQR (range be-
tween the first and third quartile). Box plots have
lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers)
indicating variability outside the upper and lower
quartiles. We use notched box plots to see if the
differences between the variables are significant: if
the notches of two box plots overlap, there is no ev-
idence that their medians differ (Chambers et al.,
1983). The means are also plotted for the sake of
completeness. The evidence from box plots is con-
firmed with two-way factorial ANOVA tests for the
significance of the differences between languages

(English vs. German), registers (ESSAY vs. FIC-
TION, etc.) and the interaction between these two
variables. η2 is calculated to show the variance ex-
plained by the variables and their interaction.

Mosaic plots are used to visualise a table and to
examine the association between the variables. For
each cell, the height of bars is proportional to the
observed relative frequency. The colours indicate
the standard deviation of the expected count in chi-
square testing (or standardised residuals). If row and
column variables are completely independent (no as-
sociation), the mosaic bars for the observed values
are aligned to the mosaic bars for the expected val-
ues. In case of an association, the bars are coloured
according to the standardised residuals. Standard-
ised residual is a measure of the strength of the dif-
ference between observed and expected values, and
thus, a measure of how significant your cells are to
the chi-square value. This helps to see which cells
are contributing the most to the value.

Correlation plots are used to visualise correla-
tions between various variables under analysis. For
this, we calculate row and column profiles. The pro-
file of a given row/column is calculated by taking
each row/column point and dividing by the sum of
all row/column points. Then, the squared distance is
computed between each row/column profile and the
other rows/columns in the table, resulting in a dis-
tance matrix (a kind of correlation matrix), which
can be visualised with a correlation plot.

Correspondence analysis (CA) is a multivariate
technique to observe similarities and differences be-
tween the variables under analysis using an entire
set of features in interaction. It enables us to see
how certain features are grouped together and where
the biggest differences and similarities lie, see (Ven-
ables and Smith, 2010; Baayen, 2008; Greenacre,
2007) for details. Moreover, we are able to trace the
interplay of categories of the cohesive devices under
analysis. The output is plotted into a two dimen-
sional graph. The position of the points indicates
the relative importance of a feature for a subcorpus.

for lexical and coreference chains. Regarding lex-
ical chains, the data shows a significant difference
between registers (>| .05) and for the interaction lan-
guage:register, whereas the difference between lan-
guages is not significant (see p values in Table 2).
The register featuring the longest lexical chains and
a more distinctive behaviour is POPSCI, while the
other registers tend to show (≈ 50%) shorter chains
and differences are not so marked. As for corefer-
ence chains, only the difference between registers
is statistically significant (see Table 3). FICTION is
the register showing the longest coreference chains
and the clearest difference when compared to the
other registers. η2 in Tables 2 and 3 confirms that the
independent variable register is the factor explain-
ing a higher proportion (≈ 60%) of the variation ob-
served for both types of chains, whereas the effect
of language and the interaction language:register is
negligible.

5.2 Chain number

Figure 2 shows a significant difference between reg-
isters for lexical chains with respect to the number
of chains, and for the interaction language:register
(>| .05). The register featuring the highest num-
ber of lexical chains is FICTION, at the other end of
the spectrum we find ESSAY (≈ 33% of FICTION),
both registers show a clearcut difference when com-
pared with INTERVIEW and POPSCI, which are lo-
cated somewhere in the middle. Although the dif-
ference between languages is not significant (see
p values in Table 4), there is an interesting differ-
ence in terms of register ranking. As for corefer-
ence chains, the picture is almost the same. We ob-
serve a slightly lower number of coreference chains
than lexical chains. Nevertheless, the difference is
not so marked as with chain length. η2 in Tables
4 and 5 confirms that the independent variable reg-
ister is the factor explaining a higher proportion
(≈ 50% for lexical chains, ≈ 60% for coreference)
of the variation observed for both types of chains,
whereas the effect of language and the interaction
language:register is negligible.

5.3 Chain distance
Regarding lexical chains, Figure 3 shows a signif-
icant difference between registers, taking into ac-
count the average distance between elements of the
chains. By contrast, the difference between lan-
guages is not significant (see p values in Table 6).
The register showing the greatest average distance
between elements in lexical chains is FICTION, at
the other end of the spectrum we find ESSAY (≈
50% of FICTION), both registers disassociate from
INTERVIEW and POPSCI, which are located some-
where in the middle. Coreference chains show a
completely different picture this time: Differences
between registers are again significant. However,
FICTION and INTERVIEW stand out as the reg-
isters with the highest distance between elements
of chains, ESSAY is again the register showing the
lowest distance, and POPSCI is situated in the mid-
dle. Quite remarkably, there clearly is a higher
spread of the distributions for coreference than for
lexical chains denoted by the IQR and the standard
deviation reaching proportions up to 1 to 3 in some
cases. The magnitude and range of the values is very
similar for both lexical and coreference chains. Fi-
nally, η2 in Tables 6 and 7 confirms that the inde-
pendent variable register is the factor explaining a
higher proportion of the variation observed for both
lexical chains (≈ 60%) and to a less extent for coref-
erence (≈ 30%), whereas the effect of language and
the interaction language:register is negligible.

trated in Figure 4.
Blue colour indicates that the observed value is

higher than the expected value if the data were
random, whereas red colour specifies that the ob-
served value is lower. The number of lexical chains
is very important in both English and German for
ESSAY, distance between elements in coreference
chains plays a great role in INTERVIEW (however,
more in English than in German). The distance be-
tween elements in lexical chains is strong in FIC-
TION (however, more in German than in English).
Overall, this confirms our observations in Sections
5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 above.

We then produce a correlation plot on the basis
of squared distances as explained in 4.3 above. The
size and the colour of the circle in the plot is pro-
portional to the magnitude of the distance between
register profiles, see Figure 5.

We see that cross-lingual differences between reg-
isters (e.g. EO-ESSAY vs. GO-ESSAY) are smaller
than intralingual distances between registers of one
language (e.g. GO-FICTION vs. GO-ESSAY).
This, again, confirms our observations in the pre-
vious Sections, where we saw a prevalence of the
variable register in the variation in our data.

Next, we analyse the association between chain

properties and the registers, which is possible with
a correlation graph on the basis of log-likelihood ra-
tio (calculated on the basis of observed and expected
values of chi-squared test), see Figure 6. Blue colour
of the cell means a positive value and a log(ratio)
that is higher than 0, whereas red colour would mean
a negative value with a log(ratio) below 0. Cell size
and colour intensity indicate the strength of the as-
sociation.

As seen in Figure 6, all chain features are posi-
tively associated with all registers of both languages
though there are certain preferences. For instance,
length of lexical chains is of special importance in
POPSCI, especially in English, whereas their num-
ber is more specific for English and German ESSAY.
Distance between elements in chains play a greater
role for INTERVIEW and FICTION, as already seen
above (see Figure 4).

5.5 Semantic relations

For the semantic relations under analysis (see Sec-
tion 4.1 above), we start with the association be-
tween the variables proved with a mosaic plot illus-
trated in Figure 7.

This plot clearly shows that identity relations are
more important in both fictional registers, repeti-
tions in English essays and interviews, hyponymy
and meronymy relations are more typical for both
popular-scientific registers. Fictional texts in both
languages show strong preferences for using coref-

erence, whereas this semantic type is much less im-
portant for political essays and popular-scientific ar-
ticles. In general, the coloured patterns for registers
of both languages seem to be similar, which con-
firms the observation on the strength of registerial
contrast in our data.

Next, we analyse the correlations between regis-
ter profiles in our data (based on distance matrix),
visualised in Figure 8.

Again, cross-lingual differences between registers
are smaller here. At the same time, the intralingual
differences between registers seem to be greater in
English than in German, since the circles are bigger
on the left upper part of the plot. This confirms the
observations from our previous analyses on lexical

cohesion, in which we used a set of shallow lexi-
cal features (TTR, LD, most frequent words, etc.).
As for coreference, an opposite effect was observed
in (Kunz and Lapshinova-Koltunski, 2015) for the
same language pair.

Analysing association between semantic relations
and the registers in a correlation plot (Figure 9) pro-
duced on the basis of log-likelihood ratio, we see
that our previous observations are confirmed here
too: relations of identity are strongly associated with
FICTION, hyponymy and meronymy with POPSCI.
Instance-type relations are typical for ESSAY.

In general, the registers with week identity as-
sociations (ESSAY and POPSCI) tend to show a
strong association to other relations, i.e. hyper-
/hyponymy, type-instance, etc., whereas semantic
relations tend to show a lower association (FICTION
and partly INTERVIEW) when the identity associa-
tion is strong. This means that for certain registers
(e.g. narrative ones), chain relations other than iden-
tity play a minor role.

5.6 Feature combination

In the last analysis step, we combine all the fea-
tures under analysis , to map the correlations be-
tween them, as well as between registers applying
CA, see Figure 10.

The plot provides us with two multilingual sub-
corpora groupings: FICTION and INTERVIEW on
the left side, and ESSAY and POPSCI on the right

side. This suggests a subdivision according to mode:
written vs. spoken. In terms of features, those re-
lated to lexical cohesion are on the right side of the
x-axis, and coreference-related ones on the left side.
However, the distance between elements of lexical
chains seems to have a correlation with the relation
of identity and its chain properties, especially with
the distance between elements of coreference chains
(as their points are situated close to each other on
the plot). Length and number of coreference chains
also have a correlation and are especially impor-
tant for interviews. We also observe groupings of
the subtypes of semantic relations on the plot, e.g.
meronym and holonym; hyperonym, hyponym and
cohyponym; type, instance and coinstance.

6 Discussion

Altogether, registerial differences are more pro-
nounced than language differences, at least for the
language pair English-German. The differences and
similarities observed between the registers seem to
reflect typical situational configurations, some of
which pointing to differences between written and
spoken discourse.

In POPSCI, we find a relatively low number of
long lexical chains in which the distance between
elements is relatively low, in combination with a
medium number of short coreference chains with
low distance. This goes along with relatively high
semantic variation and few repetitions, as compared
to the other registers. The chain features express
continuity within one topic domain and a detailed
development of these topics, reflecting the inten-
tion of information distribution. In ESSAY, we ob-
serve the lowest frequencies for chain number, chain
length and distance in both coreference and lexical
chains, pointing to a generally lower textual coher-
ence and much topic variation. The frequent use of
repetitions serve the communicative goal of persua-
sion. FICTION is characterized by a high number
of short lexical chains and long coreference chains,
with a high distance between elements of the two
chain types, and with much semantic variation in
lexical chains. Thus there is a focus on specific
referents reflecting a narrative style together with

extensive use of lexical resources available in the
two languages. INTERVIEW features longer chains
than ESSAY and POPSCI but shorter ones than FIC-
TION, a medium number of chains which is be-
low FICTION and a chain distance as high as in
FICTION for coreference. Apart from that, IN-
TERVIEW equals ESSAY in low distance in lexical
chains and frequent use of repetitions. This however
may rather be attributed to constraints of short term
memory capacity in a spoken context rather than the
intention to manipulate opinions as in ESSAY.

Last but not least, our findings show that identity
is not the only and most important coreference re-
lation to build textual coherence, at least for some
registers. This all the more calls for an extensive ex-
ploration of such relations in future analyses.
