Affective computing has a commercial side. Numer-
ous products and projects provide sentiment, emo-
tion, and intent extraction capabilities, applied in
consumer and financial markets, for healthcare and
customer care, and for media, policy, and politics.
Academic and industry researchers are naturally in-
terested how sentiment and social technologies are
being applied and in commercial market opportu-
nities and trends, in what’s being funded, what’s
falling flat, and what’s on business’s roadmap. Ana-
lyst Seth Grimes will provide an industry overview,
surveying companies and applications in the senti-
ment and social analytics spaces as well as work at
the tech giants. He will discuss commercialization
strategy and the affective market outlook.
