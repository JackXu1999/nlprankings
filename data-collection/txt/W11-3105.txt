Abstract 

Comparative or evaluative questions are 
the non-factoid class of questions that 
contain comparative or evaluative key-
words, which may or may not be directly 
quantifiable. This entails the need for ex-
traction of comparative and evaluative 
features, identification of semantic mean-
ing of those features and converting them 
to quantifiable criteria before data can be 
obtained from the source text. This paper 
presents the study of the comparative or 
evaluative questions along with a rule 
based approach to syntactically extract 
and semantically analyze comparative or 
evaluative features, and give a basic idea 
to generate the answer. 

1 Introduction 
Answering of the Comparative or Evaluative 
questions needs some extra effort mainly because 
of two reasons. The first reason is the extraction 
of the Comparative or Evaluative keywords and 
features (CEF) from the question and syntactical-
ly and semantically analyzing them. Secondly, 
the non-quantifiable Comparative or Evaluative 
expressions have to be transformed into quantifi-
able criteria so that appropriate answer can be 
generated. 

 The Comparative or Evaluative expressions 
mainly belong to the adjective (like good, better, 
best) or the adverbs followed by the adjective 
(like more popular, most popular). The expres-
sion depicts the degree of comparison (e.g. gen-
eral or positive/ negative, comparative, superla-
tive). The Comparative or Evaluative expression 
may (for example, cheapest hotel to stay in Las 
Vegas where ‘cheapest’ is the comparative ex-
pression) or may not be (for example, best hotel 
to stay in Las Vegas where ‘best’ is comparative 
expression) directly quantifiable. So, a mecha-
nism is necessary to convert all the Comparative 

or Evaluative expressions into quantifiable crite-
ria. The Comparative and Evaluative Features 
(CEF) include the entity upon which comparison 
is done (e.g. all hotels in Las Vegas) and the con-
straints, which are used to choose the most ap-
propriate entity. In brief, the task of question 
analysis part can be divided into 3 basic opera-
tions. 

1. Extraction of Comparative or Evaluative 
Expression and CEFs. 

2. Classification of question according to user 
information need. 

3. Transforming the Comparative or Evalua-
tive expression into quantifiable criteria. 

  Another issue with the comparative or evalu-
ative question is that, it requires great deal of 
domain knowledge to transform comparative or 
evaluative keywords into quantifiable criteria. 
For example, if ‘best’ is the comparative key-
word and used as ‘best hotel’ (e.g., what are the 
best hotels in Las Vegas?) in tourism domain and 
‘best insurance policy’ (e.g. what are the best 
insurance policy for my child education?) in 
business domain then system has different set of 
paradigms to transform ‘best’ into quantifiable 
criteria. The topic is elaborately discussed in sec-
tion 3. 

In the next section, the related works of the 
Comparative or Evaluative questions are de-
scribed. The challenges are described in Section 
3. In the next section 4, the degree of comparison 
is described. The decomposition of non-
quantifiable expressions is described in Section 
5.  Section 6 elaborates our approach to build the 
question analyzer. System evaluation is de-
scribed in Section 7. Future works are discussed 
in Section 8. 

2 Related works  
Friedman (1989) presents a general approach to 
process comparative expressions by syntactically 
treating them to conform to a standard form con-
taining the comparative operator and the clauses 
that are involved in the comparison. Another ap-

29



proach would be to automatically extract com-
parative relations in sentences via machine learn-
ing. 

Olawsky (1989) attempts to study the seman-
tic context by generating a set of candidate inter-
pretations of comparative expressions. Then, the 
user is prompted to choose among these to speci-
fy his intent. 

Kennedy (2006) proposed that comparisons 
may be in relation to properties within the same 
object, degree of comparisons of the same prop-
erty between different objects, or different prop-
erties of different objects. The properties at stake 
in the comparison are embedded in the semantics 
of the words in the question, and possibly in the 
context that comes with the question. To date, 
there is obviously no widely available lexical 
resource containing an exhaustive list of compar-
ative predicates, applied to precise terms, togeth-
er with the properties involved. These can possi-
bly be derived, to a limited extent, from existing 
resources like Frame-Net or from ontology 
where relationships between concepts and terms 
can be mapped. However, this is tractable for 
very simple situations, and in most cases, identi-
fying those properties is a major challenge. 

Nathalie et al (2009) have proposed the tech-
nique to handle comparative and evaluative ques-
tion answering for business domain. They have 
proposed the procedure to identify the terms in 
the question based on which comparison or eval-
uation can be done. 

This paper gives the idea of a question an-
swering system which is capable of handling 
comparative and evaluative questions related to 
tourism domain and attempts to resolve the chal-
lenges identified by Patrick et al (2009). 

3 Challenges 
Patrick et al (2009) show the challenges that the 
comparative and evaluative question answering 
system face.  

Type of comparison: Comparisons may be 
the relation to properties within the same object, 
or degree of comparisons of the same property 
between different objects, or different properties 
of different objects. In some simple situations, 
Jindal and Liu (2006) show that comparative re-
lations in sentences can be extracted automatical-
ly via machine learning. Their approach deter-
mines whether the expression is non-equal grad-
able, equative, or superlative. In this paper a rule 
based technique is used to explore in depth se-

mantic and conceptual issues and their depend-
ence to context, users, and domains. 

Determining semantic meaning and con-
verting to quantifiable measures: The proper-
ties at stake in the comparison are embedded in 
the semantics of the words in the question, and 
possibly in the context that comes with the ques-
tion. To date, there is obviously no widely avail-
able lexical resource containing an exhaustive 
list of comparative predicates, applied to precise 
terms, together with the properties involved.  
However, this is tractable for very simple situa-
tions, and in most cases, identifying those prop-
erties is a major challenge. Various ways to ac-
curately identify these properties through differ-
ent resources (like Generative Lexicon) in the 
tourism domain have been explored. 

Ambiguity of Comparative Expression: The 
standard of comparison (i.e., the value) may be 
different based on the context, i.e., depending on 
the object that it is associated to and on the type 
of expression. Properties of expression may be 
underspecified and/or polysemous and would 
gain context only when associated with the ob-
ject. One such predicate is ‘best’. 

Best Place to go: type of weather of the place, 
popularity to visit, number of famous tourist 
spots. 

Best Hotel to stay: type of Hotel (1 star, 3 
star,5 star), types of rooms (AC, Non AC, Dou-
ble Bed etc) available, Fare of the room & Other 
facilities 

Best way to reach: Type of communication 
(Train, Bus, Flight etc), duration of journey, fare 
of the journey etc.  

To automatically determine the properties, in-
cluding default values, to be used in the evalua-
tion, other available sources indicating some 
range of values may be tapped, as is done in an-
swer fusion. But rather than retrieving the partial 
answer, properties needed for evaluation must be 
retrieved or inferred. Values may be either nu-
merical values (where comparisons are quite 
easy to handle) or textual values (that are often 
discrete). It is then necessary to define compara-
tive scales along basic properties so that those 
values get ordered. This is a major challenge for 
our work. 

Processing superlatives and other forms of 
quantification related to comparisons: Super-
latives and other forms of quantifications in con-
nection with comparative expressions can also be 
used on top of the basic evaluative expressions. 
Consider the question: 

Which is the best hotel to stay in Delhi? 

30



“Best hotel” entails different dimensions from 
being conservative. In the context of tourism, 
evaluation could be in terms of variety of room; 
rent of the hotel, satisfactory room service, avail-
ability of restaurant, bar, summing pool and oth-
er facilities. Also sometime it is not explicitly 
mentioned the boundary of the entity for superla-
tive question (for example hotels). If a strict 
evaluation of all these criteria is done, the result 
may not be complete or accurate. So it may be 
the better approach to rank the result and show 
top 10 results than showing a single answer.  

Domain dependency: Transformation of the 
comparative expression into quantifiable criteria 
needs domain knowledge. The comparative ex-
pression and associated features contain the se-
mantic meaning of the question. The semantic 
meaning of the features is changed in different 
domain. So the same comparative expression can 
be translated into different quantifiable criteria 
depending on which domain question is raised. 
Domain dependency is a biggest problem in 
analysis of the comparative and evaluative ques-
tions.  

4 Determine Degree of Comparison and 
Evaluation 

It is observed that the Comparative Expressions 
may be either adjective (e.g., cheaper, best etc.) 
or adverb associated with adjective or another 
adverb (e.g. more/RB popular/JJ, most/RB com-
fortable/JJ, as/RB fast/RB as/IN, as/RB comfort-
able/JJ as/IN etc) or quantifiers. In a sentence the 
comparative expression is placed in adjective 
chunk preceded by either verb or noun chunk and 
followed by noun chunk (e.g. what/WP (VP 
(are/VBP the/DT (NP (cheapest/JJS ho-
tels/NNS)) in/IN (NP (Las/NNP Ve-
gas/NNP?))))) or (what/WP (VP (are/VBP (NP 
(the/DT Las/NNP Vegas/NNP)) (NP (cheap-
est/JJS hotels/NNS))))).  

The comparative expression can be catego-
rized into three classes according to the nature of 
comparison.          

1. Positive/Negative or General: Positive 
/Negative or General comparative expression is 
basically not to compare between entities but to 
know whether the entity posses the criteria or 
not. 

Example: Is the [Taj Bengal] (entity) [good] 
(Comparative Expression) [5 star hotel] (crite-
ria)?  

2. Comparative: Comparative expressions are 
those which compare between two entities or two 
set of entities. 

    Example: Is [ITC Sonar Bangla] (entity) 
[better] (Comparative Expression) than [Taj Be-
gal] (entity)? or 

     Is [ITC Sonar Bangla] (entity) as [good] 
(Comparative Expression) as [Taj Begal] (enti-
ty)? 

3. Superlative:  Superlative expressions are 
those which compare an entity with set of entity 
based on certain criteria. 
Example: Is [Taj Bengal] (entity) [best]( Com-
parative Expression) [5 star hotel in Kolkata] 
(criteria)? 

Sometimes it is seen that the entity is not ex-
plicitly defined. For example, the following 
question does not include the entity information: 
What are the [best] (Comparative Expression) [5 
star hotel in Kolkata] (criteria)? 

All relevant entities have to be identified for 
the above question and then compared according 
to criteria. 

The rules to extract comparative expressions 
in the present work are discussed in Table 4. 

Evaluative expressions: Evaluative expres-
sions are not directly compared but checks 
whether the criteria are matched or not. 

Example: What are the [morning] (Evaluative 
Expression) [flights to Delhi from Kolkata] (enti-
ty)? 

It is also important that entity and expression 
can appear in many places in the sentence. User 
can also write the previous question in many dif-
ferent ways (like what are the Kolkata to Delhi 
morning flight? or what are the morning Kolkata 
to Delhi flight? etc.). So we extract the relevant 
important information in the form of Compara-
tive and Evaluative Features (CEF).    

5 Decompose Non-quantifiable criteria 
to quantifiable criteria  

The comparative or evaluative expressions may 
not be directly quantifiable. It is the task of the 
question analyzer to decompose these non-
quantifiable expressions to equivalent quantifia-
ble criteria. In the earlier example question, the 
comparative expression “good 5 star hotels” is 
not a directly quantifiable expression. To solve 
this, we follow the human interpretation of an-
swering whether the hotel is a good 5 star Hotel 
or not. For a human, a hotel is a good 5 Star Ho-
tel if it has adequate rooms with good variety 
(like single bed, double bed, cottage, suit etc.), 

31



quality food and other facilities like gym, swim-
ming pool, disco, library, etc. so the comparative 
expression ‘good’ depends on the entity (5 star 
hotel) features or characteristic that are stated 
below.  

 
1. Adequate Rooms 
2. Varity of Rooms 
3. Quality of Food Service 
4. Availability of Gym 
5. Availability of Summing Pool 
6. Availability of Bar 
7. Availability of Casino 
8. Availability of Disco 
 
So the non-quantifiable comparative expres-

sion can be evaluated by the linear combination 
of the weighted entity features. The entity feature 
values can be computed by the percentage of 
matching keywords/phrases for string valued 
features or the deviation from the range for nu-
merical valued features. The weight of each fea-
ture represents user preferences.  

6 Our Approach 
As we have discussed earlier, our prime target is 
to extract all important properties (comparative 
or evaluative expression, its degree of compari-
son, entity and constraints) or features from the 
user given question. In this section, we describe 
the basic idea to analyze the comparative and 
evaluative questions raised in the tourism domain. 

6.1 Why tourism domain? 
We have used tourism related question because 
of two reasons.   

1. Tourism is very popular domain where 
user frequently asked various types of 
question. So it has rich set of compara-
tive or evaluative questions. 

2. Tourism domain has large set of criteria 
for each entity. So comparison can be 
done appropriately.  

Over 200 questions are collected from differ-
ent tourism website Q&A section. Rules have 
been developed with 150 questions. These rules 
are applied on the rest 50 questions. Here are 
some questions1: 

Q1: We plan to visit Andhra Pradesh in De-
cember. We live in Kolkata, and will start and

end our journey at Vizag and have seven days in 
hand. We are three families with kids and our 
budget is moderate. Kindly suggest an itinerary, 
which must include Araku Valley. 

Q2: My family is planning a trip to Khashmir 
in late October. We plan to spend six days there 
and will visit Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. 
Can you suggest good hotel in range of Rs 3000-
4000? 

Q3: My husband, son and I want to visit 
Stuttgart, Heidelberg, Salzburg and maybe Mu-
nich in May 2010. We live in Mumbai. Is it 
cheaper to fly to Frankfurt first or to Stuttgart?  

6.2 Classification of questions according to 
information need  

All the questions related to tourism domain can 
be classified into 7 classes according to their in-
formation need. The categories are stated below: 
Itinerary: The questions where user asks for a 
suggested itinerary or schedule or planning for 
visiting a place fall into this category. 
Accommodation: The questions where user asks 
for accommodation, i.e., Hotel detail, Cost to 
stay, etc for a place fall into this category. 
How to Reach: The questions regarding how to 
visit or reach a place along with transportation 
details like travel by train, flight and cost of 
transportation fall into this category. 
Best Time to Visit: User asks for the best time to 
visit a place or whether a specific time is best to 
visit that place or not. 
Getting Around: User asks for details of seeing 
the tourist spot, buy something, eat/drink in a 
restaurant etc.  
Cost Related Information: User asks for esti-
mated cost to visit a place or per head cost to 
visit a place. 
Miscellaneous: If the question does not classify 
into any of the above categories then it comes 
under miscellaneous category. 

Table 1 shows the result of classifying 200 
questions that are collected. 

 
# Type of Question Percentage 
1 Itinerary 18% 
2 Accommodation 22% 
3 Reach Destination 19% 
4 Best Time To Visit 9% 
5 Getting Around 20% 
6 Cost Related Information 8% 
7 Miscellaneous 4% 

 
Table 1: % of question occurs in different class 

 

32



Questions are classified into different classes 
using set of rules. Rules are nothing but match-
ing string. If a string is present then the question 
is classified into the corresponding class. The 
rules are stated in Table 2. 

 

# Type of Ques-tion 

Rules 
(Question Consist of follow-

ing String) 

1 Itinerary itinerary, chalk out a [trip, tour] 

2 Accommoda-tion 
[H,h]otels?, 
[a,A]ccommodations? 

3 Reach Desti-nation travels?, transport 

4 Best Time To Visit 
[good, best, preferable, suita-
ble] [time, season] 

5 Getting Around 
site screen, place to visit, 
tourism spot 

6 Cost Related Information 

cost per [day, week, head, 
living], per [day, week, head, 
living] cost 

7 Miscellane-ous 

If any question was not classi-
fied in any of the above six 
classes then it will be classi-
fied as Miscellaneous. 

 
Table 2: Rule for classifying questions into different 

classes. 

6.3 Extraction of CEF 
The comparative and evaluative features (CEF) 
are the features which play useful role to evalu-
ate the answer of the question. CEFs are holding 
the semantic meaning of the phrases like time of 
visit, duration of visit, Number of people are go-
ing and their description like age (old, kids etc), 
relation (wife, friends, family, parent) etc. For 
example CEF holds the information of user opted 
tour places, his/her purpose of visiting those 
places, his/her family and relative information 
who will accompany the user, the time when user 
wants to go, the time span that user wants to 
spend, the budget of user, and other user specifi-
cations. So answers of the question are heavily 
dependent on the CEFs present in the question. 

Sixteen types of CEF are identified. All of the-
se 16 types of features may not occur in a single 
question. In these 16 types of CEFs, the place 
features like <Origin Place> and <Destination 
Place> etc are included. <Destination Place> is 
always required and must be present in the ques-
tion. The various CEFs are now described. 

Location Related feature: These features 
contain the place name where user wants to 
go/travel/stay etc or the place name from where 
he/she starts his/her journey or where he/she 
stays (Origin). Sometimes user also mentions the 
place name where he/she must want to visit. 

Location To: Where user wants to 
go/visit/travel/see. 

Extraction Rule: Location named entity words 
are preceded by preposition “to”, “include”, “at” 

Location From: From where user wants to 
start his/her journey. 

Extraction Rule: Location named entity words 
are preceded by preposition “from”, “in”. 

Must Include Locations: Explicitly men-
tioned place name where user must visit. 

Extraction Rule: Location named entity words 
are preceded by preposition “must”, “include”. 

Similar Locations: User wants to visit the 
place that is similar (historically, geographically 
etc) with explicitly mentioned place. 

Extraction Rule: Location named entity words 
are preceded by preposition “similar”, “Likely”. 

Time Related Information: These features 
contain the time related phrase like the time 
when user wants to travel or duration of his/her 
travel. 

Time to Go: When user plans to go/travel/stay 
on the place. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of 
Month, Season and Day Expressions. 

Month={"january","frebruary","march","april"
,"may","june","july","august","september","octo
ber","november","december"}; 

Season={"summer", "rainy", "monsoon", 
"winter", "autumn"}; 

Day={"sunday","monday","tuesday","wednus
day","thusday","friday","saturday"}; 

Time Limit: How many days user wants to 
spend. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of 
Time Expression 

TimeExp= 
{"day","days","month","months","week","weeks
","nights","nights","fortnight","fortnights","week
ends","weekend","week ends", "week end"}; 

Team Related Information: This type of fea-
ture contains the phrases that carry the infor-
mation of the number of members with whom 
user wants to share his/her journey and their de-
tails. 

Team Member: Number of people who will 
travel with the user 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of 
Team Expression 

33



TeamExpression= {"families", "family", 
"couple", "men", "women", "man", "woman”, 
"friends",  "friend", "colleague"}; 

Team Details: The relation of other member 
with the user and their details like age, or dis-
ease/weakness etc. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of 
Team Details Expression 

TeamDetailsExpression = {"family" 
,"husband", "wife", "father", "mother", "son", 
"daughter”, "friends", "young", "old", “kids” 
etc}; 

Travel Related Information: These features 
contain useful information like the budget of 
travel and purpose of travel etc. 

Budget: User may specify the expected budg-
et of their journey. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of 
keyword like “moderate”, “cheapest”, “budget” 
or “$”, “USD”, “`”, “Rs”, “INR”, “£”, “EUR”, 
“€”, “GBP” followed by Number Expression 
which consists tag “(CD”. 

Purpose of Travel: User may specify the pur-
pose of his/her journey like tourism, business, 
honeymoon, study etc. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase consists of Visit 
Type Expression. 

Visit Type= {tour, family tour, business, hon-
eymoon, study, job} 

Adjective Modifier: Adjective modifier plays 
an important role to evaluate the answer. Adjec-
tive modifiers like cheapest, best, suitable, af-
fordable, comfortable etc. give different direc-
tions of evaluating the answer. User uses adjec-
tive modifier to specific their choices. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase contains Adjec-
tive phrases with JJ or JJS tag or ADJP Phrase. 

Specific Type Related Information: Some 
features are dependent on the type of question.  

Accommodation Related These features 
specify the choice of accommodation of the user. 
Sometime user specifies the special range of ac-
commodation like government guesthouse, holi-
day home etc. 

Hotel Type: User specifies the type of hotel 
he/she wants to stay. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase contains key-
word like “Private Hotels”, “Government Hotel”, 
and “Guest House”, “Hostel” etc 

Hotel Specification: User specifies the crite-
ria that should be met by a hotel, like, 3-star, 5-
star, resort, etc. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase contains key-
word like “hotel”, “Inn”, “Resort”, “Darmasala” 
etc 

Transportation: This feature specifies the 
choice of transportation of the user, like, flight, 
bus, train. 

Transportation Mode: User may specify 
his/her liking or disliking of transportation mode 
while traveling. 

Extraction Rule: Noun Phrase contains key-
word like “train”, “bus”, “car”, “flight”, “fly” 
etc. 

Getting Around: This feature specifies the 
choice or purpose of Getting Around like to see 
tourist spot or buy or see market place etc. 

Extraction Rule: 
Getting Around Choice: User may specify 

his/her choice to do (See tourist spot, or roam 
famous market place or eat foods in restaurant 
etc) while staying at the place. 

Extraction Rule: Choice= {sight seen, buy, 
eat}

6.4 Determining degree of comparison and 
Entity Selection 

The comparative or evaluative expressions, the 
entities and the constraints are extracted from the 
CEFs. Comparative or Evaluative Expression 
belong to Adjective Modifier. Entity and Con-
straints are different for different class of ques-
tion. These are shown in Table 3.

6.5 Decomposing non-quantifiable expres-
sion into quantifiable criteria 

Now we identify the list of comparative expres-
sion that are found in our test set and are not di-
rectly quantifiable. They are good, suit/suitable, 
comfortable, perfect, reasonable, appropriate, 
clean, safe etc. and their comparative and super-
lative forms. 

Decomposition of non-quantifiable expression 
is done by the scoring of each feature of the enti-
ty. The score of the entity features are computed 
by the percentage of keyword/phrase matching 
between the keywords present in the entity fea-
ture value and the keywords present in the rules 
for the string valued features (e.g. variety of 

35



rooms for hotel entity) or by the standard devia-
tion from the range for numerical valued features 
(e.g. rent of the room for hotel entity). The rule 
set are developed for each non-quantifiable ex-
pression for each class of question which con-
tains the keyword set for each entity features by 
human annotator. So the ‘good hotel’ compara-
tive expression of Q2 can be evaluated by using 
the following hotel features. 

 
    1. Adequate Rooms 
Good Hotel=      2. Varity of Rooms 

3. Rent of the rooms 
4. Other facilities 

 
From Q2, the system has also extracted the 

other constraints (e.g. Team Details=‘Family’, 
Time Limits=‘six days’, Time to Go=‘Late Oc-
tober’ & Budget=‘Rs 3000-4000’). So the rule 
for determining good hotel is shown below. 

 
1. Adequate Rooms available in 
Late October 
2. Availability of Double bed      
Rooms, Double bed Ac room, 
family suit, cottage etc. 
3. Room Rent between Rs 3000-
4000 
4. Availability of family restau-
rant, room service etc. 

 
So the entity features are scored by the per-

centage of matching keywords between the rule 
and feature value. The keywords in the rule are 
changed according to the constraints present in 
the question. Here we show how the keywords of 
the ‘variety of room’ features are changed for the 
‘good hotel’ comparative expression with differ-
ent constraints: 

If team details consist of friends, colleague, 
etc and if travel limits are more than 7 days in a 
place then keywords are dormitory, single bed, 
non-ac rooms. 

If team details consist businessman or purpose 
of travel is business and if a travel limit is less 
than 7 days in same place then keywords are suit, 
cottage, villa etc. 

If team details include husband and wife, or 
newly married couple and the purpose of travel is 
honeymoon then keywords are double bed 
ac/non ac, family suit, villa etc. 

The comparison is done by ordering the final 
score of each entity. The final score is evaluated 
by the weighted average of each                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
entity feature score. Weight of entity features is 

between 0-5, which represents the user prefer-
ence. For example if user explicitly mentioned 
his/her budget in numerical figure (e.g. Rs 3000-
4000) then the entity features related with budget 
(e.g. room rent) has weight 5. If user mentioned 
its budget as moderate the entity features related 
with budget (e.g. room rent) has weight 3. If user 
does not explicitly mentioned his/her budget then 
the entity features related with budget (e.g. room 
rent) has weight 1.  

Sometimes two or more comparative expres-
sions are semantically close like ‘good hotel’ & 
‘appropriate hotel’ or ‘suitable hotel’ so same 
rule can be followed for those expressions. 

Quantifiable adjective are those which can 
quantify directly like cheap, fast, short, large, big 
small, high, low etc. So, ‘cheapest hotel’ means 
low cost hotel. We just sort the hotel rent in as-
cending order and show the top 5 results. 

7 Evaluation 
We have developed the rules with 150 distinct 
questions and tested it over 50 questions. The 
system is evaluated by the string matching tech-
nique between the system generated tagged ques-
tions and the corresponding human annotated 
tagged questions. The precision and recall are 
calculated by the formula (1) and (2). Table 6 
shows the precision and recall of our system. 
 
Precision =                                                    ... (1) 
 
 
Recall =       … (2)

8 Conclusion and Future work 
System is somewhat biased because all the rules 
are manually developed and it requires the great 
understanding of domain knowledge. In future 
machine learning technique will be used to ex-
tract the rules and to extract more comparative

and evaluative features from the question. Ex-
traction of more features means extraction of 
more semantic information’s from question. 
Sometime user gives unusual information that 
misleads the system and drives to wrong direc-
tion. If we extract semantically correct infor-
mation from it and remove the unessential in-
formation then system performance will increase. 

In future we have to identify the unusual in-
formation that mislead the system and try to re-
move this kind of noise from the question. In 
future, we will try to port our system in other 
domains like news, business intelligence etc. Al-
so there is no good evaluation system to evaluate 
the performance of question answering system, 
so in future we would have planned to design 
automated evaluation scheme to evaluate the per-
formance of question answering system.
