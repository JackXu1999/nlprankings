Abstract

This paper investigates whether sentence
structure analysis—examining who ap-
pears in subject versus object position—
can illuminate who academic articles por-
tray as having agency in labor relations.
We extract subjects and objects from a cor-
pus of 3,800 academic articles, and com-
pare both the relative occurrence of differ-
ent groups (workers, women, employers)
in each position and the verbs that most
commonly attach to each group. We con-
clude that agency, while elusive, can po-
tentially be modeled by sentence structure
analysis.

1 Introduction

In scholarship on grassroots movements and non-
elite groups, the question of “agency” often looms
large (Johnson, 2003). Who exactly do we, as
scholars, portray as taking action, accomplishing
historical change, doing rather than being done to?

With regard to scholarship on American labor
unions, the main fault lines along which “doers”
and “done-to” are split involve not only employers
versus unions, but also the union leadership versus
the rank and file, and unionized workers versus un-
affiliated workers. This question has, indeed, in-
formed some of the major shifts in the writing of
labor history, as scholars have moved away from
the “Wisconsin school” of John Commons, which
focused on the institutional and organizational his-
tory of unions and toward a more inclusive and
bottom-up social history of workers, affiliated or
not (Isserman, 1976; Fink, 1988). More recently,
perhaps spurred by the sorry state of American la-
bor unions, interest in unions as institutions and
organized movements has resurfaced (Currarino,
2011; Taillon, 2009). As many scholars have

noted, however, there seems to often be an excess
of attention to the articulate leadership and the ac-
tions of the union as an institution, even if the rank
and file (let alone unaffiliated workers) may not
share those views or endorse those actions (Pierce,
2010).

The question of who gets to speak for social
movements is hardly limited to the history of or-
ganized labor. Similar questions about whose ac-
tions command attention (as well as about who
does the hard work and who gets the credit) have
been raised about the Civil Rights Movement as
well (Hall, 2005; Ransby, 2003). More recently,
the efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement to
remain multipolar and avoid focusing attention on
“leaders” have raised both the question of whether
that is a useful strategy vis-à-vis the media or the
public’s perceptions of the significance or the mes-
sage of the organization, and the question of the
risks of one or a handful of “charismatic leaders”
(Harris, 2015).

This paper investigates whether these problems
of agency—fundamentally, who exercises some
measure of power—can be perceived in scholarly
writing using natural language processing (NLP)
tools. A syntactic analysis has potential to go be-
yond bag-of-words models like topic modeling in
illuminating power relations, as well as to capture
more clearly who exactly is at the center of the
analysis. Analysis of subjects and objects can also
easily be combined with analysis of which actions
are related to which subjects/objects, revealing in-
teresting patterns about the ways different groups
of actors are represented in the literature. In fu-
ture work, we hope to expand the analysis by ex-
perimenting with Semantic Role Labeling in ad-
dition to syntactic analysis as well as with using
FrameNet (Baker, 2008; Palmer, 2009) and Verb-
Net (Kipper et al., 2008) to discover patterns in the
actions.

In what follows, we offer a preliminary analy-
sis focusing on noun phrases (NP) that appear in
either a subject (passive or active) or an object (in-
direct or direct) position, and of the actions they
most commonly perform or are subjected to. Does
this grammatical representation of the doers and
the done-to reproduce the splits usually empha-
sized in scholarship? Who, in academic writing,
appears as a doer, grammatically speaking? Do the
actions associated with doers and done-to modify
assumptions about who has agency in this corpus?

2 Dataset

The texts examined in this paper consist of the
set of English-language research articles over 9
pages contained in the JSTOR article database
answering the query (“american federation of la-
bor”). The query was selected to weight attention
toward “mainstream” organized labor rather than
e.g. working-class culture or the Socialist move-
ment, though naturally the dataset also contains
articles on e.g. the radical Industrial Workers of
the World (IWW).1 This query produces a set of
4,183 articles, of which about 70 percent are pub-
lished after 1945. The final set consists of a subset
of 3,807 of these articles successfully processed
using the Stanford CoreNLP parser (Manning et
al., 2014).

3 Extracting subjects and objects

Extracting subjects and objects from the parsed
articles was performed using the Stanford Tregex
utility (Levy and Andrew, 2006).

The expressions used to extract subjects (active
and passive) and objects (direct and indirect) are
listed in table 1. The copula “to be” was excluded
from consideration. As the main expressions cap-
ture rather long noun phrases (NPs), a constrain-
ing expression was used to further narrow those
phrases down to more useful sub-NPs.

3.1 Most common entities

Disregarding for the moment whether an entity
(NP) appears as subject, direct object, or indirect
object, the list of most-frequent animate entities in
the corpus reads like the cast of main characters

1The American Federation of Labor was the dominant
union umbrella group until the emergence of the Congress
of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s; the AFL and
the CIO merged in 1955 to form the present-day AFL-CIO.

and issues of industrial relations, with e.g. work-
ers, employers, and the american federation (of la-
bor) as well as legislation and wages clearly rep-
resented (see table 2).2

Some trends can be extracted even from this ba-
sic count of subject/object NPs: for example, as
figure 1 shows, women’s involvement in the labor
movement has been of shifting scholarly interest,
with the first peak coinciding roughly with the suf-
frage movement and the second upward trend be-
ginning around the rise of second wave feminism
in the 1970s. Although the topic model3 depicted
in figure 2 finds a similar pattern in the data, the
NP-based graph offers a much more fine-grained
and more easily interpreted view.

3.2 Subjects and objects

But what about the question of agency? Is there
any pattern in who appears as a subject and who
appears as an object?

There is, though the results should be taken with
some caution. Table 3 and figure 3 show selec-

2The count is the sum of the times the NP appeared as
indirect, object, direct object, passive subject, and active sub-
ject.

tions of the most frequent human or human-like
entities according to the entity’s degree of “sub-
jectness.” The table and figure were constructed
by first selecting the 1,000 most frequent NPs in
the data and then calculating for each the ratio of
how many times it appeared as a subject (passive
or active) versus as an object (indirect or direct).
From this was then deducted the overall ratio of
subjects to objects in the dataset, and the resulting
figure was used as a proxy for “subjectness.” Thus,
negative ratios in table 3 indicate that the NP is
found in object position more commonly than the
average NP in the data (the count reflects the sum
of mentions, each position being counted once per
article). Of the 1,000 most frequent terms, few
were of this “more-object-than-average” charac-
ter; however, the spread of “subjectness” allows
some preliminary conclusions.4

4We did not perform coreference resolution, and thus have
no way of capturing repeated references to the same entity
with different words. To mitigate this, we have used a count
of how many articles an NP appears in as subject/object
rather than allowing multiple counts per article. The order
of the NPs in terms of subjectness if multiple instances per

On the whole, workers (even strikers) appear
quite commonly in an object position, whereas the
government, unions as organizations, and employ-
ers appear clearly more commonly than average in
a subject position. Partly the results are explain-
able by specificity: the AFL-CIO and the well-
known AFL leader Samuel Gompers are more
likely to appear as subjects, whereas “workers”
is only barely above average in its “subjectness.”
However, it is worth noting that “employers” and
“manufacturers” are significantly above “workers”
and variants thereof in subjectness. Even as “strik-
ers,” workers’ subjectness is quite low—although
as “unionists” their subjectness is slightly higher
than that of manufacturers.

4 The actions of doers and done-to

To further investigate the meaning of a word ap-
pearing in a subject versus object position, the
most common verbs for each word and each cat-
egory (object, indirect object, subject) were ex-
tracted. The indirect object category was mostly
too ambiguous to draw conclusions from, involv-
ing verbs like send, provide, give, distribute; the
analysis below therefore focuses on the subject
versus indirect object categories.5

4.1 “Unions”

The verbs associated with unions as actors (sub-
jects) are the bread and butter of union activ-
ity: they affiliate, represent, organize, seek, agree,
refuse, grow, demand — and encouragingly, win
rather more often than lose.

As acted-upon (direct objects), unions seem to
mainly reflect worker activity: join is by far the
most common verb, followed by verbs like form,
organize, and build. The third most common verb
here is recognize, i.e., achieving union recogni-
tion by the employer. However, high on the list
are also destroy, break, and prohibit, reflecting the
contested history of labor.

4.2 “Workers,” “members,” and “strikers”

High on the list of verbs associated with work-
ers as actors are organize and strike; interestingly,

5Excessively generic verbs like do or make are ignored in
the analysis.

strike comes much higher on the list for “workers”
than for “unions” (10th versus 73rd place).

“Members” as actors are clearly tied to the bu-
reaucracy and process of union activity: they ap-
point, vote, elect, represent, and participate. In-
triguingly, they also grapple and adapt.

As acted-upon, both members and workers are
organized, represented, recruited, and mobilized,
as well as employed and hired. However, workers
are also excluded and divided, reflecting the divi-
sions among workers and the not-always-inclusive
nature of American labor unions. Meanwhile,
members get disciplined, presumably reflecting
conflicts between leadership and rank and file,
and forbidden, possibly by police or courts. Both
workers and members are the targets of someone’s
efforts to educate.

When they appear as “strikers,” the main thing
workers do is return (to work, presumably). They
also demand, remain (on strike?), refuse, vote, and
win or lose. As acted-upon, strikers most com-
monly get replaced. But they are also supported,
urged, aided, rehired, and reinstated — as well as
restrained, arrested, and intimidated.

4.3 “Employers”

Employers are not primarily the initiators of ac-
tion in this corpus: rather, the two most com-
mon verbs for “employers” as actor are refuse and
agree. In the top 25 are also violate (presumably
agreements) and resist (presumably unions).

As acted-upon, employers in this corpus find

themselves the target of efforts to require, force,
compel, prevent, prohibit, and coerce, though also
to allow, permit, and induce.

4.4 “Women”

The main thing that women do in this corpus is
work; it seems that the main news about women as
workers is that they exist. High on the list is also
enter, probably from a phrase like “enter the work-
force.” However, women also participate, want,
organize and negotiate.

As acted-upon, women are given, organized,
employed, and bafflingly, ordained. They are also
encouraged and excluded (7th and 8th position).

5 Discussion

As the above analysis demonstrates, grammatical
subjects and objects function as a rough proxy for
examining agency, illuminating who tends to be
the doer and who the done-to: the broad lines of
which NPs have high “subjectness” coincide with
one’s intuition of the prevailing power relations.
At least as interesting, however, is that the verbs
attached to each further demonstrate their different
roles. Juxtaposing the subjectness and the com-
mon verbs is particularly interesting: for instance,
it is intriguing that in a corpus where employers
appear in a not-so-favorable light (as resisting, re-
fusing, and violating, among other things), they
are nevertheless as a group more likely than work-
ers to occupy a position of agency as subjects. On
the other hand, the tensions between union lead-
ership and rank-and-file are also revealed in, for
example, the fact that “members” find themselves
the object of verbs like discipline.

6 Future research

In the future, we hope to investigate whether SRL
analysis would offer greater clarity in distinguish-
ing agents from non-agents. We also hope to re-
fine the preliminary verb analysis presented here
by using verb categories as defined in VerbNet and
FrameNet. In addition, we plan to combine the
type of analysis presented here with an analysis
of named entities; this might allow us to investi-
gate not only the prominence of well-known fig-
ures, but possibly also questions like whether the
rise of bottom-up approaches in the 1970s or the
cultural turn of the 1990s resulted in a greater va-
riety of named entities.
