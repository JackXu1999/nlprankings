Abstract

Fact verification requires validating a claim in
the context of evidence. We show, however,
that in the popular FEVER dataset this might
not necessarily be the case. Claim-only classi-
fiers perform competitively with top evidence-
aware models. In this paper, we investigate the
cause of this phenomenon, identifying strong
cues for predicting labels solely based on the
claim, without considering any evidence. We
create an evaluation set that avoids those id-
iosyncrasies. The performance of FEVER-
trained models significantly drops when evalu-
ated on this test set. Therefore, we introduce a
regularization method which alleviates the ef-
fect of bias in the training data, obtaining im-
provements on the newly created test set. This
work is a step towards a more sound evalua-
tion of reasoning capabilities in fact verifica-
tion models.1

1 Introduction

Creating quality datasets is essential for expand-
ing NLP functionalities to new tasks. Today, such
datasets are often constructed using crowdsourc-
ing mechanisms. Prior research has demonstrated
that artifacts of this data collection method often
introduce idiosyncratic biases that impact perfor-
mance in unexpected ways (Poliak et al., 2018;
Gururangan et al., 2018). In this paper, we explore
this issue using the FEVER dataset, designed for
fact verification (Thorne et al., 2018).

The task of fact verification involves assessing
claim validity in the context of evidence, which
can either support, refute or contain not enough
information. Figure 1(A) shows an example of
a FEVER claim and evidence. While validity of
some claims may be asserted in isolation (e.g.

Asterisk (*) denotes equal contribution.

through common sense knowledge), contextual
verification is key for a fact-checking task (Al-
hindi et al., 2018). Datasets should ideally eval-
uate this ability. To assess whether this is the case
for FEVER, we train a claim-only BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019) model that classifies each claim on
its own, without associated evidence. The result-
ing system achieves 61.7%, far above the majority
baseline (33.3%).

Our analysis of the data demonstrates that this
unexpectedly high performance is due to idiosyn-
crasies of the dataset construction. For instance, in
§2 we show that the presence of negation phrasing
highly correlates with the REFUTES label, inde-
pendently of provided evidence.

To address this concern, we propose a mecha-

nism for avoiding bias in the test set construction.
We create a SYMMETRIC TEST SET where, for
each claim-evidence pair, we manually generate
a synthetic pair that holds the same relation (e.g.
SUPPORTS or REFUTES) but expressing a differ-
ent, contrary, fact. In addition, we ensure that in
the new pair, each sentence satisfies the inverse re-
lation with the original pair’s sentence. This pro-
cess is illustrated in Figure 1, where an original
REFUTES pair is extended with a synthetic RE-
FUTES pair. The new evidence is constrained to
support the original claim, and the new claim is
supported by the original evidence. In this way,
we arrive at three new pairs that complete the sym-
metry.

Determining veracity with the claim alone
in this setting would be equivalent to a ran-
dom guess. Unsurprisingly, the performance of
FEVER-trained models drop significantly on this
test set, despite having complete vocabulary over-
lap with the original dataset. For instance, the
leading evidence-aware system in the FEVER
Shared Task, the NSMN classifier by Nie et al.
(2019)2, achieves only 58.7% accuracy on the
symmetric test set compared to 81.8% on the orig-
inal dataset.

While this new test set highlights the afore-
mentioned problem, other studies have shown that
FEVER is not the only biased dataset (Poliak et al.,
2018; Gururangan et al., 2018). A potential solu-
tion which may be applied also in other tasks is
therefore to develop an algorithm that alleviates
such bias in the training data. We introduce a new
regularization procedure to downweigh the give-
away phrases that cause the bias.
The contributions of this paper are threefold:

• We show that inherent bias in FEVER dataset
interferes with context-based fact-checking.

• We introduce a method for constructing an eval-
uation set that explicitly tests a model’s ability to
validate claims in context.

• We propose a new regularization mechanism
that improves generalization in the presence of the
aforementioned bias.

2 Motivation and Analysis

In this section, we quantify the observed bias and
explore the factors causing it.

Claim-only Classification Claim-only aware
classifiers can significantly outperform all base-
lines described by Thorne et al. (2018).3 BERT,
for instance, attains an accuracy of 61.7%, which
is just 8% behind NSMN. We hypothesize that
these results are due to two factors: (1) idiosyn-
crasies distorting performance and (2) word em-
beddings revealing world knowledge.

Idiosyncrasies Distorting Performance We in-
vestigate the correlation between phrases in the
claims and the labels. In particular, we look at
the n-gram distribution in the training set. We
use Local Mutual Information (LMI) (Evert, 2005)
to capture high frequency n-grams that are highly
correlated with a particular label, as opposed to
p(l|w) that is biased towards low frequency n-
grams. LMI between w and l is defined as follows:

LMI(w, l) = p(w, l) · log
!
p(l|w)
p(l)

"
, (1)

where p(l|w) is estimated by count(w,l)count(w) , p(l) by
count(l)

|D| , p(w, l) by
count(w,l)

|D| and |D| is the num-
ber of occurrences of all n-grams in the dataset.

Table 1 shows that the top LMI-ranked n-grams
that are highly correlated with the REFUTES class
in the training set exhibit a similar correlation in
the development set. Most of the n-grams express
strong negations, which, in hindsight, is not sur-
prising as these idiosyncrasies are induced by the
way annotators altered the original claims to gen-
erate fake claims.

3We evaluate on the development set as the test set is hid-
den. Hyper-parameter fine-tuning is performed on a 20%
split of the training set, which is finally joined to the remain-
ing 80% for training the best setting. See Appendix B.1.

https://github.com/easonnie/combine-FEVER-NSMN

World Knowledge Word embeddings encom-
pass world knowledge, which might augment the
performance of claim-only classifiers. To fac-
tor out the contribution of world knowledge, we
trained two versions of claim-only InferSent (Po-
liak et al., 2018) on the FEVER claims: one with
GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) and
the other with random embeddings.4 The perfor-
mance with random embeddings was 54.1%, com-
pared to 57.3% with GloVe, which is still far above
the majority baseline (33.3%). We conjecture that
world knowledge is not the main reason for the
success of the claim-only classifier.

3 Towards Unbiased Evaluation

Based on the analysis above, we conclude that an
unbiased verification dataset should exclude ‘give-
away’ phrases in one of its inputs and also not al-
low the system to solely rely on world knowledge.
The dataset should enforce models to validate the
claim with respect to the retrieved evidence. Par-
ticularly, the truth of some claims might change as
the evidence varies over time.

For example, the claim “Halep failed to ever
win a Wimbledon title” was correct until July 19.
A fact-checking system that retrieves information
from Halep’s Wikipedia page should modify its
answer to “false” after the update that includes in-
formation about her 2019 win.

Towards this goal, we create a SYMMETRIC
TEST SET. For an original claim-evidence pair,
we manually generate a synthetic pair that holds
the same relation (i.e. SUPPORTS or REFUTES)
while expressing a fact that contradicts the original
sentences. Combining the ORIGINAL and GEN-
ERATED pairs, we obtain two new cross pairs that
hold the inverse relations (see Figure 1). Exam-
ples of generated sentences are provided in Table
2.

This new test set completely eliminates the abil-
ity of models to rely on cues from claims. Consid-
ering the two labels of this test set5, the probability
of a label given the existence of any n-gram in the
claim or in the evidence is p(l|w) = 0.5, by con-
struction.

Also, as the example in Figure 1 demonstrates,
in order to perform well on this dataset, a fact veri-
fication classifier may still take advantage of world

4We use InferSent because BERT, being pretrained on
Wikipedia, comprises world knowledge (Talmor et al., 2019).

5NOT ENOUGH INFO cases are easy to generate so we
focus on the two other labels.

knowledge (e.g. geographical locations), but rea-
soning should only be with respect to the context.

4 Towards Unbiased Training

Creating a large symmetric dataset for training is
outside the scope of this paper as it would be
too expensive. Instead, we propose an algorith-
mic solution to alleviate the bias introduced by
‘give-away’ n-grams present in the claims. We re-
weight the instances in the dataset to flatten the
correlation of claim n-grams with respect to the la-
bels. Specifically, for ‘give-away’ phrases of a par-
ticular label, we increase the importance of claims
with different labels containing those phrases.

We assign an additional (positive) balancing
weight α(i) to each training example {x(i), y(i)},
determined by the words in the claim.

Bias in the Re-Weighted Dataset For each n-
gram wj in the vocabulary V of the claims, we
define the bias towards class c to be of the form:

bcj =

#n
i=1 I[w(i)j ]

(1 + α(i))I[y(i)=c]
#n

i=1 I[w(i)j ]
(1 + α(i))

, (2)

where I
[w

(i)
j ]

and I[y(i)=c] are the indicators for wj

being present in the claim from x(i) and label y(i)

being of class c, respectively.

Optimization of the Overall Bias Finding the α
values which minimize the bias leads us to solving
the following objective:

min

$

%
|V |&

j=1

max
c

(bcj) + λ!#α!2

'

( . (3)

Re-Weighted Training Objective We calculate
the α values separately from the model optimiza-
tion, as a pre-processing step, by optimizing Eq. 3.
Using these values, the training objective is re-
weighted from the standard

#n
i=1 L(x

(i), y(i)) to

n&

i=1

(1 + α(i))L(x(i), y(i)). (4)

This re-weighting is independent of the model
architecture and can be easily added to any objec-
tive, similar to Jiang and Nachum (2019) where
they learn instance weights to address labeling
bias in datasets.

5 Experiments

We use the SYMMETRIC TEST SET to (1) inves-
tigate whether top performing sequence classifica-
tion models trained on the FEVER dataset are ac-
tually verifying claims in the context of evidence;
and (2) measure the impact of the re-weighting
method described in §4 over a classifier.

To achieve the first goal, we use three classi-
fiers. The first is a pre-trained, current FEVER
state-of-the-art classifier, NSMN (Nie et al., 2019)
which is a variation of the ESIM (Chen et al.,
2017) model, with a number of additional features,
such as contextual word embeddings (Peters et al.,
2018). In addition, we train our own ESIM model
with GloVe embeddings, using the available code
from Gardner et al. (2017). The third is a BERT
classifier6 that we fine-tune for 3 epochs to clas-
sify the relation based on the concatenation of the
claim and evidence (with a delimiter token). To
measure the impact of our regularization method,
we also train the ESIM and BERT models with the
re-weighting method.

Symmetric Test Set The full SYMMETRIC
TEST SET consists of 956 claim-evidence pairs,
created following the procedure described in §3.
The new pairs originated from 99 SUPPORTS and
140 REFUTES pairs that were randomly picked
from the cases which NSMN correctly predicts.7

After its generation, we asked two subjects to
annotate randomly sampled 285 claim-evidence
pairs (i.e. 30% of the total pairs in SYMMET-
RIC TEST SET) with one label among SUPPORTS,
REFUTES or NOT ENOUGH INFO, flagging non-
grammatical cases. They agreed with the dataset
labels in 94% of cases, attaining a Cohen κ of 0.88
(Cohen, 1960). Typos and small grammatical er-
rors were reported in 2% of the cases. Given the
small size of this dataset, we only use it as a test
set.

the three models on the SUPPORTS and REFUTES

form relatively well on FEVER DEV but achieve
less than 60% accuracy on the synthetic ones. We

conjecture that the drop in performance is due to
training data bias that is also observed in the devel-
opment set (see §2) but not in the generated sym-
metric cases.

Our re-weighting method (§4) helps to reduce
the bias in the claims. In Table 4, we revisit
the give-away bigrams from Table 1. Applying
the weights obtained by optimizing Eq. 3, the
weighted distribution of these phrases being asso-
ciated with a specific label in the training set is
now roughly uniform.

The re-weighting method increases the accu-
racy of the ESIM and BERT models by an abso-
lute 3.4% and 3.3% respectively. One can notice
that this improvement comes at a cost in the ac-
curacy over the FEVER DEV pairs. Again, this
can be explained by the bias in the training data
that translates to the development set, allowing
FEVER-trained models to leverage it. Applying
the regularization method, using the same training
data, helps to train a more robust model that per-
forms better on our test set, where verification in
context is a key requirement.

6 Related Work

Large scale datasets are fraught with give-away
phrases (McCoy et al., 2019; Niven and Kao,
2019). Crowd workers tend to adopt heuristics
when creating examples, introducing bias in the
dataset. In SNLI (Stanford Natural Language In-
ference) (Bowman et al., 2015), entailment based
solely on the hypothesis forms a very strong base-
line (Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018).

Similarly, as shown by Kaushik and Lipton
(2018), reading comprehension models that rely
only on the question (or only on the passage re-
ferred to by the question) perform exceedingly
well on several popular datasets (Weston et al.,
2016; Onishi et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2016). To
address deficiencies in the SQuAD dataset (Jia

and Liang, 2017), researchers have proposed ap-
proaches for augmenting the existing dataset (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2018). In most cases, these augmen-
tations are done manually, and involve construct-
ing challenging examples for existing systems.

7 Conclusion

This paper demonstrates that the FEVER dataset
contains idiosyncrasies that can be easily ex-
ploited by fact-checking classifiers to obtain high
classification accuracies. Evaluating the claim-
evidence reasoning of these models necessitates
unbiased datasets. Therefore, we suggest a way
to turn the evaluation FEVER pairs into sym-
metric combinations for which a decision that is
solely based on the claim is equivalent to a random
guess. Tested on these pairs, FEVER-trained mod-
els show degraded performance. To address this
problem, we propose a simple method that sup-
ports a more robust generalization in the presence
of bias.

Moving forward, we suggest using our symmet-
ric dataset in addition to the current retrieval-based
FEVER evaluation pipeline. This way, models
could be tested both for their evidence retrieval
and classification accuracy and for performing the
reasoning with respect to the evidence.
