ABSTRACT 

The Morphemes of the Manipuri word are the real bottleneck for any of the Manipuri Natural 

Language Processing (NLP) works. It is one of the Indian Scheduled Language with less 

advancement so far in terms of NLP applications. This is because the nature of the language is 

highly agglutinative. Segmentation of a word and identifying the morphemes becomes necessary 

before proceeding for any of the Manipuri NLP application. A highly inflected word may 

sometimes consist of ten or more affixes. These affixes are the morphemes which change the 

semantic and grammatical structure.  So the inflexion in a word plays an important role.  Words 

are segmented to the syllables and are examined to extract a morpheme among the syllables.  

This work is implemented in the Manipuri words written with the Meitei Mayek (script). This is 

because the syllable formations are distinct comparing to the Manipuri written with Bengali 

script. The combination of 2-gram or bi-gram and the Standard Deviation technique are used for 

the identification of the morphemes. This system gives an output with the recall of 59.80%, the 

precision of 83.02% and the f-score of 69.52%.

1 Introduction 

Manipuri or Meiteilon which is synonymous with the Manipuri language is a highly agglutinative 

Indian scheduled language. A single root word can sometimes have 10 or more affixes which are 

attached one after another. For example, different suffixes can be agglutinated to the root word 

wb(pu) in order to produce the word wbKgEoEcjAxrqegrsO(pusinhǝnjǝrǝmgǝdǝbǝnidǝko), which 
means “I wish (I) myself would have caused to bring in the article”. Here 10 suffixes are being 

attached to a bound verbal root (Nonigopal, 2006).  Separation of the morphemes in the word are 

as follows: wbKgEoEcjAxrqegrsO =  wb/pu + KgE/sin + oE/hǝn + c/jǝ + jA/rǝm + x/gǝ + r/dǝ + q/bǝ 
+ eg/ni + r/dǝ + sO/ko  

Morphology is the identification, analysis and description of the structure of morphemes and 

other units of meaning in a language such as words, affixes, part of speech etc (Denial J et.al. 

2008). Morphemes are the smallest conceptual meaningful component of a word that has 

semantic meaning. 

In this work, first the syllables are identified which is followed by the morpheme identification 

among the syllables. It is not guaranteed that all the syllables are morphemes. Manipuri usages 

two script a borrowed Bengali script and the original Manipuri script which is also known as the 

Meitei Mayek. This work is implemented in the Meitei Mayek Manipuri words. This is because 

the syllable formations are distinct comparing to the Bengali Script Manipuri. 

The paper is organised with the related works in section 2, word segmentation into syllables in 

section 3, the system design in section 4 which is followed by experiment and evaluation in 

section 5 and at the last section 6 conclusions is drawn. 

2 Related work 

Morphological works in Germanic and other European languages can be found in (Braschler 

et.al, 2004).  The various stemming algorithms comparative analysis for nine European 

Languages is presented in the survey report by (Tomlinson, 2003).  

Some of the other works on Indian Language can be found in the work of (Utpal et. al., 2002a) 

where unsupervised learning technique is implemented for highly inflectional language. Another 

work of (Utpal et. al., 2008b) deals about acquisition of morphology of an Indic language from 

text corpus. Oriya morphological analyser design is reported in (Mohanty et. al., 2008). 

Morpheme detection will of great help for Manipuri which is a highly agglutinative Indian 

Language. It is because these morphemes are meaningful units and the affixation of these 

morpheme changes semantic and POS of a word. This identification may lead us to an easy way 

for Machine translation. So far, identification of syllabic unit for Manipuri words are reported in 

the work of (Kishorjit et. al, 2012a). The work of Manipuri morphological analyser is reported in 

(Sirajul et.al, 2004).  Stemming works of Manipuri is also reported in (Kishorjit et. al.,2011b). 

Morphological driven Manipuri POS tagging are also reported in (Singh et. al., 2008). 

3 Word Segmentation into syllables 

Word Segmentation in this context refers to the process of division of words into phonemic units 

or syllables that forms the whole word. It is an operation for dividing words into unit syllables by 

automatic means (Kalyani et. al., 2009). It is also known as syllabification (Bernd, 1998). 

96



Segmentation may be used in a variety of applications which need the unit prosodic cues of the 

words, or need the proper understanding of the structural construction of the words (Jean-Luc, 

2007).  The word segmentation of Manipuri follows the algorithms and the systems mention in 

(Kishorjit et. al., 2012b) with certain modifications.  

3.1 A brief about Meitei Mayek characters 

It will be better if the characters used in the Meitei Mayek are discussed in brief. The work is 

based on the 27 scripts approved by the State Government of Manipur. which is also published in 

(Kangjia, 2003). The characters used in Meiteilon (Manipuri language) can be classified into five 

different categories. 

• Iyek Ipee : This character set consists of 27 letters which are mainly major consonants, out of 
which three are used to produce vowel sounds (B, T, [). This category is considered as major 
consonants in the sense that letters are used in their full form at the initial position of a 

syllabic unit. Moreover, associations with Cheitap Iyek are permitted with these characters 

only. 

• Cheitap Iyek (Matras):  These are associative symbols which can be found only in association 
with Iyek Ipee character sets. Association with Iyek Ipee characters follow a one to one 

relationship i.e. no two (or more) symbols is found to be associated with one letter in Iyek 

Ipee. Consecutive occurrence is also not permitted. 

• Cheising Iyek (Numerals):  This set contains the numeral figures and follow the decimal 
system.  

• Lonsum Iyek: There are 8 characters in this set and these characters can be considered to be 
derivative form of 8 distinct letters in Iyek Ipee. In one sense, these letters can be regarded as 

half consonants as they cannot be associated with any symbols in Cheitap Iyek and cannot 

initiate formation of a syllable. This character set can only be present in the syllabic final 

position. Recurrence or clusters of these characters i.e. consecutive occurrence of these 

characters are also not permitted in the language. 

• Khudam Iyek (Symbols): Usage of special characters is limited in this language and as such 
few symbols suffice the need in expression. 

Examples: 

‘||’  - Cheikhei (Full Stop) 

‘.’  - Lum Iyek (Sign of intonation) eg.  vk.q (cha.ba (to eat)) falling intonation and 

vkq (cha.ba (swimming/floating)) rising intonation. 

‘_’  - Apun Iyek (Sign of Ligature) eg. vAwDjk (cham.pra (lemon)) 

Other symbols are as internationally accepted symbols. 

Before going deep into the syllabic structure it is important to discuss the usage of Apun Iyek for 

better understanding. This symbol is used to indicate clustering of Iyek Ipee characters to 

produce a combined sound. 

 vAwDjk  �  cǝm.pra (lemon) 
 vGSDjl  �  cǝt.khre (gone) 
Important thing to be noted is that clustering of more than two characters in Iyek Ipee is rare and 

Cheitap Iyek, if present (along with Apun Iyek), are found in association with the second Iyek 

Ipee character. 

97



3.2 Syllabic unit structure in Meitei Mayek Manipuri 

A hand craft structure is identified. This rule is used to identified the formation of a mono 

syllable Manipuri origin words without occurrence of consonant clusters. Basically, the structure 

consists of three cells: the initial position, intermediate position and the final position. 

 

FIGURE 1 – The character set and positions of syllabic unit structure in Meitei Mayek Manipuri 

3.2.1 Pattern of Character Sets in Different Positions in Mono Syllable 

In this section, occurrences of different character sets in different position contributing to the 

formation of syllables are discussed along with exceptional cases. 

3.2.1.1 Initial Position 

The initial position should always be a character from Iyek Ipee. The conditions apply to every 

syllable in a Meiteilon origin word, regardless of exceptions. 

 

FIGURE 2 – Illustration of Initial Position with examples. 

The first example is a mono syllabic word, in which the initial position is occupied by the 

character ‘w’ belongs to Iyek Ipee. 

The second example is a word formed by two syllables where in both cases the character in initial 

position belongs to Iyek Ipee character set. 

3.2.1.2 Intermediate Position 

The intermediate position, generally, is occupied by the character set in Cheitap Iyek. This 

condition may not apply in case of consonant clustering and exceptional cases. Moreover, it is 

not necessary that this position be occupied. 

In the first example shown in Fig 3.3, the occurrence of ‘  k’ , a character in Cheitap Iyek in the 
intermediate position is illustrated, while in the second example the nonexistent state in this 

position is shown in Figure 3.3. 

IYEK IPEE CHEITAP IYEK LONSUM IYEK 

Initial Intermediate Final 

98



 

FIGURE 3 – Illustration of Intermediate Position with examples. 

3.2.1.3 Final Position 

Normally, the final position is filled in by characters from the Lonsum Iyek character set, but, as 

in the previous case, it is not a necessary condition. Syllables with nonexistent final position are 

common in the language. 

 

FIGURE 4 – Illustration of Final Position with examples. 

In this example, the final position of the first syllable is occupied by Lonsum Iyek character ‘ G ’ 
whereas in the second syllable the position is empty. 

3.2.1.4  Occurrence of Exceptional Characters in Final Position 

In Meiteilon some exceptional characters belonging to Iyek Ipee are found to occur in the final 

position of a syllable. Special attention is to be given to each and every letter in this group 

because understanding the correct utilization of these letters is important for correct and proper 

command over the language. 

One such character is the letter ‘ T ’(i). This letter is present in both Iyek Ipee character set as 
well as Lonsum Iyek. So, if it initializes a syllable, should it be considered as a major consonant, 

and if it finalizes the syllable, should it be considered as Lonsum Iyek? This issue is purely 

linguistic in nature. But from a computational view this is a character which has the capability to 

initiate as well as finalize syllable and its importance should be kept in mind while developing 

algorithm. 

 

FIGURE 5 – Illustration of Exceptional cases with examples. 

Similarly, the letters B,_,\,j are found to be used in both initial and final positions, but these  
letters do not have their derivative counterparts in Lonsum Iyek character set. 

99



FIGURE 6 – Illustration of Exceptional cases with examples. 

3.3  Complex Syllabic Structure 

Majority of the syllable are of the basic structure. But occurrence of a slightly complex structure 

is found if the use of (  D ) Apun Iyek is found (mostly in close association with j, _, \). 

In this case, a syllabic unit is divided into five cells, comprising of initial, final and three 

intermediate positions. 

 

FIGURE 7 – Comparison of Simple and Complex Syllabic Structure. 

In another sense, the first three cells can be thought as the expanded form of the initial position in 

basic structure. The last two cells (4
th

 and 5
th

) are same as that of basic structure. 

The first three cells i.e. expansion of the initial position, the second cell is meant to be occupied 

by the Apun Iyek (  D  ) and the first and the third cell is filled in by characters from Iyek Ipee 
character set. 

3.4 The Syllabic Pattern 

Syllable can be divided into three parts; onset (beginning of a syllable, either a consonant or a 

semivowel), peak (nucleus of the syllable, vowels) and coda (sound which comes after the peak, 

generally consonants). In every syllable there must be a peak. But there may not be an onset or 

coda in Meiteilon syllabic system. 

Referring to section 2.4.1 of (Yashawanta, 2000), the syllabic structure, the author has stated that 

the syllables can be of six forms.  

Classification A 

1. V 
2. VC 
3. CV    where, 
4. CCV    V = Syllabic peaks, vowels 
5. CVC    C = Syllabic margins, consonants 
6. CCVC 

100



In this process, syllables are segmented using a script based algorithm and thus the pattern 

observed also are on the basis of the script (Kishorjit et.al. 2012b). The patterns found are as 

follows; 

Classification B 

1. V 
2. CV 
3. C 
4. VVV 
5. CVC 
6. CC 
7. CVV 
8. VV    where, 
9. VVC    V = vowel characters 
10. VC    C = consonant characters 
11. CCVC 

It must be noted that the previous classification A is based on linguistic approach and the 

classification B, on computational view. 

 It may seem like the later classification shows more variety of patterns, but it is not so. 

Both, classifications are one and same, the only difference lies in the approach. This is elaborated 

in (Kishorjit et. al., 2012b). 

4 System design 

The system design of this work can be divided into two parts. The first part is designed in order 

to identify the syllabic units of a word and the second part is the identification of morphemes 

from the syllabic units.  

4.1 System design for word segmentation 

The identification of the syllabic unit follows the same hand craft rule used in the work of 

(Kishorjit et. al., 2012b). Fig. 8 shows the details of the segmentation system. The first method 

(segmentor) provides the base foundation in which the Input File is read line by line and every 

line is tokenized and every tokens or word is provided for syllable extraction. Then from the 

stack, where the syllables for every word are stored, the unit/mono syllables are again written 

into the Output File. 

The second method (extractor), when called by the first, takes a string parameter (word) and 

segments the word into unit syllables. Segmentation is done depending on the script based rules 

and the syllabic structures defined in this chapter. For every syllable extracted it is pushed down 

into a stack object defined for the particular word. The extraction process starts from the left most 

syllables, thus suitable for storing in a stack. 

101



 

FIGURE 8 – System Diagram of Segmentation 

The Input File is passed to the segmentation algorithm. The segmentation algorithm tokenizes the 

string in the file and calls the extractor algorithm passing each word as parameter. The extractor 

algorithm refers to the character list for checking the various conditions present and pushes down 

each extracted segment in the stack. A stack is used because the segmentation starts from the end 

of the word and LIFO (Last In First Out) principle is followed. When extraction is over, control 

is shifted to segmentation algorithm and it takes the segments from the stack and gives the 

output. 

4.2 Morpheme identification system 

With the principle that word consists of syllable or syllables and the syllable can be morpheme 

but not guaranteed that all the syllables will be a morpheme. For example in the word 

“unladylike”, there are 4 syllables (un-, la-, dy- and like) but only 3 morphemes (un-, lady- and 

like).  Taking a Manipuri word example  Kk\OdKI/sa.yok.saŋ/ “animal rearing place or zoo”, there 
are three syllables, out of which the first one Kk /sa/ “animal” is a free root (noun) and the second 
one is \Od /yok/ “bring up/ rear” is a bound root (verb) and the last one KI /saŋ/ “house/shed” is 
again a free root (noun). Together these three syllables form the word Kk\OdKI/sa.yok.saŋ/ 
meaning “zoo/animal rearing place” also altogether there are three morphemes. 

 

4.2.1 Pre-processing and segmentation process 

The system (Fig. 9) is feed with a text corpus, so pre-processing is very important and the process 

consists of cleaning of the file. By cleaning it means the correction of spellings, removal of 

unwanted characters and the grammatical errors. The cleaned file is fed as the input file. The 

input file is procured from local newspaper Huiyen Lanpao
1
 which provides a Meitei Mayek 

version of the daily news. Approximately some well cleaned 13,045 words are used for the 

system input file.  

The Cleaned file is fed as an input for the segmentation process. The segmentation process 

follows the same rule mention in section 4.1. The segmented file with syllables as output is used 

for the next module of morpheme identification.

4.3 Morpheme identification module 

In the morpheme identification module the syllables are used for frequency finding and other 

statistical findings. The Bigram model is used in order to measure the relative association 

between each syllable present in a word and find their corresponding probability values. This 

probability values are normalized so as to bring uniformity in the data and prevent redundancy 

and duplication.  

The output of Bigram probability is implemented with Standard deviation.  

4.3.1 N-gram and Bigram 

In order to start a brief discussion of N-gram, the concept of conditional probability is necessary. 

In probability theory, the conditional probability of A given B is the probability of A if B is 

known to occur (or have occurred). It is commonly denoted as )( BAP , and sometime 

)().( BAPAPB  can be visualized as the probability of event A when the sample space is 

restricted to event B (Freund et. al., 2006).

An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model for predicting the next item in such a 

sequence in the form of a (n-1) order Markov model.In the fields of computational linguistics and 

probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or 

speech. The items in question can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according 

to the application. n-grams are collected from a text or speech corpus. Mathemetically, it is 

defined as :  

Given a string of words (w1, w2, w3 ,……………, wn), we can compute the probability of the 

complete string using n-gram. If we consider each word occurring in its correct location as an 

independent event, we can represent this probability as follows: 

P(w1,w2,w3,w4,…….,wn) 

This can be further decomposed by the chain rule of probability as follows: 

P(w1
n
)=P(w1)P(w2|w1)P(w3|w2)P(w4|w3)…………… P(wn|w1

n-1

And in order to compute the probability like )|( 11
−−−−n

n wwP , we have to approximate the 

probability of a word given all previous words. 

An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "bigram", size 3 is a "trigram" and so 

on. In this system it has restricted to the bigram model which approximates the probability of a 

word given all the previous words )|( 11
−−−−n

n wwP  by the conditional probability of the preceding 

word )|( 1−−−−nn wwP  

As an example, instead of computing the probability 

P(rabbit | Just the other day I saw a) 

We approximate it with the probability: 

P (rabbit | a) 

Implementing in the syllabic level, for example for the word Kk\OdKI/sa.yok.saŋ/ “animal rearing 
place or zoo”, the three syllables are Kk /sa/ “animal”, \Od /yok/ “bring up/ rear” and KI /saŋ/ 
“house/shed”. And the sample Bigram probability notation is: 

P(\\\\OdOdOdOd|KKKK), P(KIKIKIKI|\\\\Od)Od)Od)Od), , , , etc. 

4.3.2 Standard deviation 

Standard deviation is the degree of variation in the probability distribution. It expresses the 

amount of dispersion from the average (mean).  

The mean, denoted by µ, of a distribution or set of random variables X is given by: 

n

xi
n
i 1====∑∑∑∑====µµµµ   Where, n = total elements in a population/sample 

104



The standard deviation of a probability distribution is given by the positive square root of its 

variance. Variance is the square of summation of the difference between the probability values 

and the mean value divided by the population size.

Standard deviation (σ) and mean (µ) of the probability distribution is calculated for the given 

syllables. In Standard Deviation, the domain range is defined as the distance between one σ 

difference from µ on both negative and positive values. And this range is used to determine 

whether a syllable is a morpheme or not. In our case only the positive values of µ is considered 

because negative value is meaningless in our case. It is because the syllabic unit bigram 

frequency probability outputs do not have negative values. 

5 Experiment and evaluation 

A total of 13,045 word forms were supplied. The outcome was 35,840 syllables and 972 of them 

were distinct syllables. In order to evaluate the experiment, the system used the parameter of 

Recall, Precision and F-score.

 ; where, ββββ is one, which means precision and recall are given equal 

weight.  
The Fig. 10 shows the graph of the syllables with the probability values. It can be observed that 

the ranges between 0.01 and 0.08 are clustered together. This indicates that there is some 

consistency in this range and as mention above only these positive values range is considered 

even though in the standard deviation it has a range both comprises of negative and positive 

values. It is because negative value is meaningless since it’s calculated with the syllabic unit 

bigram frequency probability outputs which do not have negative values. 

105



 

FIGURE 10 – Standard Deviation  

The measurement is done using the evaluation method of recall, precision and f-score mention 

above. So, the system gives a Recall of 59.80%, Precision of 83.02%, and F-score of 69.52%. 

6 Conclusion 

The system designed is a morpheme identifier not a morphological analyser, so the job of this 

system is to identify the morpheme from a set of syllables. A syllable segmentation algorithm is 

applied and the output syllables are verified whether it’s a morpheme or not. In the identification, 

the concept of standard deviation is implemented. There is no such report of identifying Manipuri 

language morphemes using syllable or syllabic unit inputs.  

These could be a boon for this highly agglutinative language since the complexity of Machine 

translation could be solved up-to a great extend. Other statistical method can also be 

implemented to improve the output.
