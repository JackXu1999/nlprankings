Abstract

This paper examines the task of detecting
intensity of emotion from text. We cre-
ate the first datasets of tweets annotated
for anger, fear, joy, and sadness intensities.
We use a technique called best–worst scal-
ing (BWS) that improves annotation con-
sistency and obtains reliable fine-grained
scores. We show that emotion-word hash-
tags often impact emotion intensity, usu-
ally conveying a more intense emotion. Fi-
nally, we create a benchmark regression
system and conduct experiments to deter-
mine: which features are useful for detect-
ing emotion intensity; and, the extent to
which two emotions are similar in terms
of how they manifest in language.

1 Introduction

We use language to communicate not only the
emotion we are feeling but also the intensity of
the emotion. For example, our utterances can con-
vey that we are very angry, slightly sad, absolutely
elated, etc. Here, intensity refers to the degree
or amount of an emotion such as anger or sad-
ness.1 Natural language applications can benefit
from knowing both the class of emotion and its
intensity. For example, a commercial customer
satisfaction system would prefer to focus first on
instances of significant frustration or anger, as op-
posed to instances of minor inconvenience. How-
ever, most work on automatic emotion detection
has focused on categorical classification (presence
of anger, joy, sadness, etc.). A notable obstacle
in developing automatic affect intensity systems is
the lack of suitable annotated data. Existing af-
fect datasets are predominantly categorical. Anno-

1Intensity is different from arousal, which refers to the
extent to which an emotion is calming or exciting.

tating instances for degrees of affect is a substan-
tially more difficult undertaking: respondents are
presented with greater cognitive load and it is par-
ticularly hard to ensure consistency (both across
responses by different annotators and within the
responses produced by an individual annotator).

Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) is an annotation
scheme that addresses these limitations (Louviere,
1991; Louviere et al., 2015; Kiritchenko and Mo-
hammad, 2016, 2017). Annotators are given n
items (an n-tuple, where n > 1 and commonly
n = 4). They are asked which item is the
best (highest in terms of the property of inter-
est) and which is the worst (lowest in terms of
the property of interest). When working on 4-
tuples, best–worst annotations are particularly ef-
ficient because each best and worst annotation will
reveal the order of five of the six item pairs. For
example, for a 4-tuple with items A, B, C, and D,
if A is the best, and D is the worst, then A > B, A
> C, A > D, B > D, and C > D.

BWS annotations for a set of 4-tuples can be
easily converted into real-valued scores of associ-
ation between the items and the property of inter-
est (Orme, 2009; Flynn and Marley, 2014). It has
been empirically shown that annotations for 2N
4-tuples is sufficient for obtaining reliable scores
(where N is the number of items) (Louviere, 1991;
Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016).2 The lit-
tle work using BWS in computational linguistics
has focused on words (Jurgens et al., 2012; Kir-
itchenko and Mohammad, 2016). It is unclear
whether the approach can be scaled up to larger
textual units such as sentences.

Twitter has a large and diverse user base,
which entails rich textual content, including non-
standard language such as emoticons, emojis, cre-

2At its limit, when n = 2, BWS becomes a paired com-
parison (Thurstone, 1927; David, 1963), but then a much
larger set of tuples need to be annotated (closer to N2).

atively spelled words (happee), and hashtagged
words (#luvumom). Tweets are often used to con-
vey one’s emotions, opinions towards products,
and stance over issues. Thus, automatically de-
tecting emotion intensities in tweets has many ap-
plications, including: tracking brand and product
perception, tracking support for issues and poli-
cies, tracking public health and well-being, and
disaster/crisis management.

In this paper, we present work on detecting
intensities (or degrees) of emotion in tweets.
Specifically, given a tweet and an emotion X,
the goal is to determine the intensity or degree
of emotion X felt by the speaker—a real-valued
score between 0 and 1.3 A score of 1 means that
the speaker feels the highest amount of emotion
X. A score of 0 means that the speaker feels
the lowest amount of emotion X. We annotate a
dataset of tweets for intensity of emotion using
best–worst scaling and crowdsourcing. The main
contributions of this work are summarized below:
• We formulate and develop the task of detecting

emotion intensities in tweets.
• We create four datasets of tweets annotated

for intensity of anger, joy, sadness, and fear,
respectively. These are the first of their kind.4

• We show that Best–Worst Scaling can be suc-
cessfully applied for annotating sentences (and
not just words). We hope that this will encour-
age the use of BWS more widely, producing
more reliable natural language annotations.

• We annotate both tweets and a hashtag-removed
version of the tweets. We analyse the impact of
hashtags on emotion intensity.

• We create a regression system, AffectiveTweets
Package, to automatically determine emotion
intensity.5 We show the extent to which various
features help determine emotion intensity. The
system is released as an open-source package
for the Weka workbench.

• We conduct experiments to show the extent to
which two emotions are similar as per their
manifestation in language, by showing how
predictive the features for one emotion are of
another emotion’s intensity.
3Identifying intensity of emotion evoked in the reader, or

intensity of emotion felt by an entity mentioned in the tweet,
are also useful, and left for future work.

4We have also begun work on creating similar datasets
annotated for other emotion categories. We are also creating
a dataset annotated for valence, arousal, and dominance.

• We provide data for a new shared task WASSA-
2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.6 The
competition is organized on a CodaLab website,
where participants can upload their submis-
sions, and the leaderboard reports the results.7

Twenty-two teams participated. A description
of the task, details of participating systems,
and results are available in Mohammad and
Bravo-Marquez (2017).8

All of the data, annotation questionnaires, evalua-
tion scripts, regression code, and interactive visu-
alizations of the data are made freely available on
the shared task website.6

2 Related Work

Psychologists have argued that some emotions are
more basic than others (Ekman, 1992; Plutchik,
1980; Parrot, 2001; Frijda, 1988). However, they
disagree on which emotions (and how many)
should be classified as basic emotions—some pro-
pose 6, some 8, some 20, and so on. Thus, most ef-
forts in automatic emotion detection have focused
on a handful of emotions, especially since manu-
ally annotating text for a large number of emotions
is arduous. Apart from these categorical models of
emotions, certain dimensional models of emotion
have also been proposed. The most popular among
them, Russell’s circumplex model, asserts that all
emotions are made up of two core dimensions: va-
lence and arousal (Russell, 2003). In this paper,
we describe work on four emotions that are the
most common amongst the many proposals for ba-
sic emotions: anger, fear, joy, and sadness. How-
ever, we have also begun work on other affect cat-
egories, as well as on valence and arousal.

The vast majority of emotion annotation work
provides discrete binary labels to the text instances
(joy–nojoy, fear–nofear, and so on) (Alm et al.,
2005; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007; Brooks et al.,
2013; Neviarouskaya et al., 2009; Bollen et al.,
2009). The only annotation effort that provided
scores for degree of emotion is by Strapparava and
Mihalcea (2007) as part of one of the SemEval-
2007 shared task. Annotators were given newspa-
per headlines and asked to provide scores between

0 and 100 via slide bars in a web interface. It is dif-
ficult for humans to provide direct scores at such
fine granularity. A common problem is inconsis-
tency in annotations. One annotator might assign a
score of 79 to a piece of text, whereas another an-
notator may assign a score of 62 to the same text.
It is also common that the same annotator assigns
different scores to the same text instance at differ-
ent points in time. Further, annotators often have
a bias towards different parts of the scale, known
as scale region bias.

Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) was developed by
Louviere (1991), building on some ground-
breaking research in the 1960s in mathemati-
cal psychology and psychophysics by Anthony
A. J. Marley and Duncan Luce. Kiritchenko
and Mohammad (2017) show through empiri-
cal experiments that BWS produces more re-
liable fine-grained scores than scores obtained
using rating scales. Within the NLP commu-
nity, Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) has thus far
been used only to annotate words: for exam-
ple, for creating datasets for relational similar-
ity (Jurgens et al., 2012), word-sense disambigua-
tion (Jurgens, 2013), word–sentiment intensity
(Kiritchenko et al., 2014), and phrase sentiment
composition (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016).
However, in this work we use BWS to annotate
whole tweets for degree of emotion. With BWS
we address the challenges of direct scoring, and
produce more reliable emotion intensity scores.
Further, this will be the first dataset with emotion
scores for tweets.

Automatic emotion classification has been pro-
posed for many different kinds of texts, including
tweets (Summa et al., 2016; Mohammad, 2012;
Bollen et al., 2009; Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007;
Brooks et al., 2013). However, there is little work
on emotion regression other than the three submis-
sions to the 2007 SemEval task (Strapparava and
Mihalcea, 2007).

3 Data

For each of the four focus emotions, our goal was
to create a dataset of tweets such that:

• The tweets are associated with various intensi-
ties (or degrees) of emotion.

• Some tweets have words clearly indicative of
the focus emotion and some tweets do not.

A random collection of tweets is likely to have a
large proportion of tweets not associated with the

focus emotion, and thus annotating all of them for
intensity of emotion is sub-optimal. To create a
dataset of tweets rich in a particular emotion, we
use the following methodology.

For each emotion X, we select 50 to 100 terms
that are associated with that emotion at differ-
ent intensity levels. For example, for the anger
dataset, we use the terms: angry, mad, frustrated,
annoyed, peeved, irritated, miffed, fury, antago-
nism, and so on. For the sadness dataset, we use
the terms: sad, devastated, sullen, down, crying,
dejected, heartbroken, grief, weeping, and so on.
We will refer to these terms as the query terms.

We identified the query words for an emotion
by first searching the Roget’s Thesaurus to find
categories that had the focus emotion word (or
a close synonym) as the head word.9 We chose
all words listed within these categories to be the
query terms for the corresponding focus emotion.
We polled the Twitter API for tweets that included
the query terms. We discarded retweets (tweets
that start with RT) and tweets with urls. We
created a subset of the remaining tweets by:

• selecting at most 50 tweets per query term.
• selecting at most 1 tweet for every tweeter–

query term combination.

Thus, the master set of tweets is not heavily
skewed towards some tweeters or query terms.

To study the impact of emotion word hashtags
on the intensity of the whole tweet, we identified
tweets that had a query term in hashtag form
towards the end of the tweet—specifically, within
the trailing portion of the tweet made up solely
of hashtagged words. We created copies of these
tweets and then removed the hashtag query terms
from the copies. The updated tweets were then
added to the master set. Finally, our master set of
7,097 tweets includes:

1. Hashtag Query Term Tweets (HQT Tweets):
1030 tweets with a query term in the form
of a hashtag (#<query term>) in the trailing
portion of the tweet;

2. No Query Term Tweets (NQT Tweets):
1030 tweets that are copies of ‘1’, but with the
hashtagged query term removed;
9The Roget’s Thesaurus groups words into about 1000

categories. The head word is the word that best represents
the meaning of the words within the category. The categories
chosen were: 900 Resentment (for anger), 860 Fear (for fear),
836 Cheerfulness (for joy), and 837 Dejection (for sadness).

67



3. Query Term Tweets (QT Tweets):
5037 tweets that include:
a. tweets that contain a query term in the form
of a word (no #<query term>)
b. tweets with a query term in hashtag form
followed by at least one non-hashtag word.

The master set of tweets was then manually an-
notated for intensity of emotion. Table 1 shows a
breakdown by emotion.

3.1 Annotating with Best–Worst Scaling
We followed the procedure described in Kir-
itchenko and Mohammad (2016) to obtain BWS
annotations. For each emotion, the annotators
were presented with four tweets at a time (4-
tuples) and asked to select the speakers of the
tweets with the highest and lowest emotion inten-
sity. 2 × N (where N is the number of tweets in
the emotion set) distinct 4-tuples were randomly
generated in such a manner that each item is seen
in eight different 4-tuples, and no pair of items
occurs in more than one 4-tuple. We will re-
fer to this as random maximum-diversity selection
(RMDS). RMDS maximizes the number of unique
items that each item co-occurs with in the 4-tuples.
After BWS annotations, this in turn leads to di-
rect comparative ranking information for the max-
imum number of pairs of items.10

It is desirable for an item to occur in sets of 4-
tuples such that the maximum intensities in those
4-tuples are spread across the range from low in-
tensity to high intensity, as then the proportion of
times an item is chosen as the best is indicative
of its intensity score. Similarly, it is desirable for
an item to occur in sets of 4-tuples such that the
minimum intensities are spread from low to high
intensity. However, since the intensities of items
are not known beforehand, RMDS is used.

Every 4-tuple was annotated by three indepen-
dent annotators.11 The questionnaires used were
developed through internal discussions and pilot

10In combinatorial mathematics, balanced incomplete
block design refers to creating blocks (or tuples) of a handful
items from a set of N items such that each item occurs in the
same number of blocks (say x) and each pair of distinct items
occurs in the same number of blocks (say y), where x and y
are integers ge 1 (Yates, 1936). The set of tuples we create
have similar properties, except that since we create only 2N
tuples, pairs of distinct items either never occur together in a
4-tuple or they occur in exactly one 4-tuple.

11Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2016) showed that using
just three annotations per 4-tuple produces highly reliable re-
sults. Note that since each tweet is seen in eight different
4-tuples, we obtain 8× 3 = 24 judgments over each tweet.

annotations. A sample questionnaire is shown in
the Appendix (A.1).

The 4-tuples of tweets were uploaded on the
crowdsourcing platform, CrowdFlower. About
5% of the data was annotated internally before-
hand (by the authors). These questions are referred
to as gold questions. The gold questions are inter-
spersed with other questions. If one gets a gold
question wrong, they are immediately notified of
it. If one’s accuracy on the gold questions falls be-
low 70%, they are refused further annotation, and
all of their annotations are discarded. This serves
as a mechanism to avoid malicious annotations.12

The BWS responses were translated into scores
by a simple calculation (Orme, 2009; Flynn and
Marley, 2014): For each item, the score is the per-
centage of times the item was chosen as having
the most intensity minus the percentage of times
the item was chosen as having the least intensity.13

The scores range from −1 to 1. Since degree of
emotion is a unipolar scale, we linearly transform
the the−1 to 1 scores to scores in the range 0 to 1.
3.2 Training, Development, and Test Sets

We refer to the newly created emotion-intensity la-
beled data as the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset.
The dataset is partitioned into training, develop-
ment, and test sets for machine learning experi-
ments (see Table 1). For each emotion, we chose
to include about 50% of the tweets in the training
set, about 5% in the development set, and about
45% in the test set. Further, we made sure that
an NQT tweet is in the same partition as the HQT
tweet it was created from. See Appendix (A.4) for
details of an interactive visualization of the data.

12In case more than one item can be reasonably chosen as
the best (or worst) item, then more than one acceptable gold
answers are provided. The goal with the gold annotations
is to identify clearly poor or malicious annotators. In case
where two items are close in intensity, we want the crowd
of annotators to indicate, through their BWS annotations, the
relative ranking of the items.

13Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2016) provide code
for generating tuples from items using RMDS, as well
as code for generating scores from BWS annotations:

4 Reliability of Annotations

One cannot use standard inter-annotator agree-
ment measures to determine quality of BWS anno-
tations because the disagreement that arises when
a tuple has two items that are close in emotion in-
tensity is a useful signal for BWS. For a given 4-
tuple, if respondents are not able to consistently
identify the tweet that has highest (or lowest) emo-
tion intensity, then the disagreement will lead to
the two tweets obtaining scores that are close to
each other, which is the desired outcome. Thus a
different measure of quality of annotations must
be utilized.

A useful measure of quality is reproducibility
of the end result—if repeated independent man-
ual annotations from multiple respondents result
in similar intensity rankings (and scores), then one
can be confident that the scores capture the true
emotion intensities. To assess this reproducibility,
we calculate average split-half reliability (SHR),
a commonly used approach to determine consis-
tency (Kuder and Richardson, 1937; Cronbach,
1946). The intuition behind SHR is as follows.
All annotations for an item (in our case, tuples)
are randomly split into two halves. Two sets of
scores are produced independently from the two
halves. Then the correlation between the two sets
of scores is calculated. If the annotations are of
good quality, then the correlation between the two
halves will be high.

Since each tuple in this dataset was annotated by
three annotators (odd number), we calculate SHR
by randomly placing one or two annotations per
tuple in one bin and the remaining (two or one)
annotations for the tuple in another bin. Then two
sets of intensity scores (and rankings) are calcu-
lated from the annotations in each of the two bins.
The process is repeated 100 times and the correla-
tions across the two sets of rankings and intensity
scores are averaged. Table 2 shows the split-half
reliabilities for the anger, fear, joy, and sadness
tweets in the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset.14

Observe that for fear, joy, and sadness datasets,
both the Pearson correlations and the Spearman
rank correlations lie between 0.84 and 0.88, indi-
cating a high degree of reproducibility. However,

14Past work has found the SHR for sentiment intensity an-
notations for words, with 8 annotations per tuple, to be 0.98
(Kiritchenko et al., 2014). In contrast, here SHR is calculated
from 3 annotations, for emotions, and from whole sentences.
SHR determined from a smaller number of annotations and
on more complex annotation tasks are expected to be lower.

Emotion Spearman Pearson
anger 0.779 0.797
fear 0.845 0.850
joy 0.881 0.882
sadness 0.847 0.847

Table 2: Split-half reliabilities (as measured by
Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correla-
tion) for the anger, fear, joy, and sadness tweets
in the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset.

the correlations are slightly lower for anger indi-
cating that it is relative more difficult to ascertain
the degrees of anger of speakers from their tweets.
Note that SHR indicates the quality of annotations
obtained when using only half the number of an-
notations. The correlations obtained when repeat-
ing the experiment with three annotations for each
4-tuple is expected to be even higher. Thus the
numbers shown in Table 2 are a lower bound on
the quality of annotations obtained with three an-
notations per 4-tuple.

5 Impact of Emotion Word Hashtags on
Emotion Intensity

Some studies have shown that emoticons tend
to be redundant in terms of the sentiment (Go
et al., 2009; Mohammad et al., 2013). That is,
if we remove a smiley face, ‘:)’, from a tweet,
we find that the rest of the tweet still conveys a
positive sentiment. Similarly, it has been shown
that hashtag emotion words are also somewhat
redundant in terms of the class of emotion being
conveyed by the rest of the tweet (Mohammad,
2012). For example, removal of ‘#angry’ from the
tweet below leaves a tweet that still conveys anger.

This mindless support of a demagogue
needs to stop. #racism #grrr #angry

However, it is unclear what impact such emotion
word hashtags have on the intensity of emotion. In
fact, there exists no prior work to systematically
study this. One of the goals of creating this dataset
and including HQT–NQT tweet pairs, is to allow
for exactly such an investigation.15

We analyzed the scores in our dataset to cre-
ate scatter plots where each point corresponds to
a HQT–NQT tweet pair, the x-axis is the emotion
intensity score of the HQT tweet, and the y-axis
is the score of the NQT tweet. Figure 1 shows
the scatter plot for the fear data. We observe that

tion word hashtags have been used in prior research.

Table 3: The impact of removal of emotion word hashtags on the emotion intensities of tweets.

Figure 1: The scatter plot of fear intensity of HQT
tweet vs. corresponding NQT tweet. As per space
availability, some points are labeled with the rele-
vant hashtag.

in a majority of the cases, the points are on the
lower-right side of the diagonal, indicating that the
removal of the emotion word hashtag causes the
emotion intensity of the tweet to drop. However,
we do see a number of points on the upper-left side
of the diagonal (indicating a rise), and some ex-
actly on the diagonal (indicating no impact), due
to the removal of a hashtag. Also observe that the
removal of a hashtag can result in a drop in emo-
tion scores for some tweets, but a rise for others
(e.g., see the three labeled points for #nervous in
the plot). We observe a similar pattern for other
emotions as well (plots not shown here). Table 3
summarizes these results by showing the percent-
age of times the three outcomes occur for each of
the emotions.

The table also shows that the average scores of
HQT tweets and NQT tweets. The difference be-
tween 0.58 and 0.47 is statistically significant.16

The last two columns show that when there is a
drop in score on removal of the hashtag, the aver-

16Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 0.05 significance level.

age drop is about 0.17 (17% of the total range 0–
1), whereas when there is a rise, the average rise
is 0.08 (8% of the total range). These results show
that emotion word hashtags are often not redun-
dant with the rest of tweet in terms of what they
bring to bear at the overall emotion intensity. Fur-
ther, even though it is common for many of these
hashtags to increase the emotion intensity, there
is a more complex interplay between the text of
the tweet and the hashtag which determines the di-
rectionality and magnitude of the impact on emo-
tion intensity. For instance, we often found that
if the rest of the tweet clearly indicated the pres-
ence of an emotion (through another emotion word
hashtag, emojis, or through the non-hashtagged
words), then the emotion word hashtag had only
a small impact on the score.17

However, if the rest of the tweet is under-
specified in terms of the emotion of the speaker,
then the emotion word hashtag markedly in-
creased the perceived emotion intensity. We also
observed patterns unique to particular emotions.
For example, when judging degree of fear of
a speaker, lower scores were assigned when
the speaker used a hashtag that indicated some
outward judgment.

@RocksNRopes Can’t believe how rude
your cashier was. fear: 0.48

@RocksNRopes Can’t believe how rude
your cashier was. #terrible fear: 0.31

We believe that not vocalizing an outward judg-
ment of the situation made the speaker appear
more fearful. The HQT–NQT subset of our dataset
will also be made separately, and freely, available
as it may be of interest on its own, especially for
the psychology and social sciences communities.

17Unless the hashtag word itself is associated with very
low emotion intensity (e.g., #peeved with anger), in which
case, there was a drop in perceived emotion intensity.

6 Automatically Determining Tweet
Emotion Intensity

We now describe our regression system, which we
use for obtaining benchmark prediction results on
the new Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset (Section
6.1) and for determining the extent to which two
emotions are correlated (Section 6.2).

Regression System We implemented a pack-
age called AffectiveTweets for the Weka machine
learning workbench (Hall et al., 2009) that pro-
vides a collection of filters for extracting state-of-
the-art features from tweets for sentiment classifi-
cation and other related tasks. These include fea-
tures used in Kiritchenko et al. (2014) and Mo-
hammad et al. (2017).18 We use the package
for calculating feature vectors from our emotion-
intensity-labeled tweets and train Weka regression
models on this transformed data. We used an L2-
regularized L2-loss SVM regression model with
the regularization parameter C set to 1, imple-
mented in LIBLINEAR19. The features used:20

a. Word N-grams (WN): presence or absence of
word n-grams from n = 1 to n = 4.
b. Character N-grams (CN): presence or absence
of character n-grams from n = 3 to n = 5.
c. Word Embeddings (WE): an average of the
word embeddings of all the words in a tweet. We
calculate individual word embeddings using the
negative sampling skip-gram model implemented
in Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). Word vectors
are trained from ten million English tweets taken
from the Edinburgh Twitter Corpus (Petrović
et al., 2010). We set Word2Vec parameters:

detection system that outperformed submissions from all 19
teams that participated in SemEval-2016 Task 6.

window size: 5; number of dimensions: 400.21
d. Affect Lexicons (L): we use the lexicons shown
in Table 4, by aggregating the information for
all the words in a tweet. If the lexicon provides
nominal association labels (e.g, positive, anger,
etc.), then the number of words in the tweet
matching each class are counted. If the lexicon
provides numerical scores, the individual scores
for each class are summed. These resources
differ according to: whether the lexicon includes
Twitter-specific terms, whether the words were
manually or automatically annotated, whether the
words were annotated for sentiment or emotions,
and whether the affective associations provided
are nominal or numeric. (See Table 4.)

Evaluation We calculate the Pearson correla-
tion coefficient (r) between the scores produced
by the automatic system on the test sets and the
gold intensity scores to determine the extent to
which the output of the system matches the re-
sults of human annotation.22 Pearson coefficient,
which measures linear correlations between two
variables, produces scores from -1 (perfectly in-
versely correlated) to 1 (perfectly correlated). A
score of 0 indicates no correlation.

6.1 Supervised Regression and Ablation

We developed our system by training on the offi-
cial training sets and applying the learned models
to the development sets. Once system parameters
were frozen, the system trained on the combined
training and development corpora. These models
were applied to the official test sets. Table 5 shows
the results obtained on the test sets using various
features, individually and in combination. The last
column ‘avg.’ shows the macro-average of the cor-
relations for all of the emotions.

21Optimized for the task of word–emotion classification on
an independent dataset (Bravo-Marquez et al., 2016).

22We also determined Spearman rank correlations but
these were inline with the results obtained using Pearson.

Table 5: Pearson correlations (r) of emotion inten-
sity predictions with gold scores. Best results for
each column are shown in bold: highest score by
a feature set, highest score using a single lexicon,
and highest score using feature set combinations.

Using just character or just word n-grams leads
to results around 0.48, suggesting that they are
reasonably good indicators of emotion intensity
by themselves. (Guessing the intensity scores
at random between 0 and 1 is expected to get
correlations close to 0.) Word embeddings pro-
duce statistically significant improvement over the
ngrams (avg. r = 0.55).23 Using features drawn
from affect lexicons produces results ranging from
avg. r = 0.19 with SentiWordNet to avg. r = 0.53
with NRC-Hash-Emo. Combining all the lexicons
leads to statistically significant improvement over
individual lexicons (avg. r = 0.63). Combining
the different kinds of features leads to even higher
scores, with the best overall result obtained us-
ing word embedding and lexicon features (avg. r
= 0.66).24 The feature space formed by all the
lexicons together is the strongest single feature
category. The results also show that some fea-
tures such as character ngrams are redundant in
the presence of certain other features.

23We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 0.05 signifi-
cance level calculated from ten random partitions of the data,
for all the significance tests reported in this paper.

24The increase from 0.63 to 0.66 is statistically significant.

Among the lexicons, NRC-Hash-Emo is the
most predictive single lexicon. Lexicons that in-
clude Twitter-specific entries, lexicons that in-
clude intensity scores, and lexicons that label
emotions and not just sentiment, tend to be
more predictive on this task–dataset combination.
NRC-Aff-Int has real-valued fine-grained word–
emotion association scores for all the words in
NRC-EmoLex that were marked as being associ-
ated with anger, fear, joy, and sadness.25 Improve-
ment in scores obtained using NRC-Aff-Int over
the scores obtained using NRC-EmoLex also show
that using fine intensity scores of word-emotion
association are beneficial for tweet-level emotion
intensity detection. The correlations for anger,
fear, and joy are similar (around 0.65), but the cor-
relation for sadness is markedly higher (0.71). We
can observe from Table 5 that this boost in perfor-
mance for sadness is to some extent due to word
embeddings, but is more so due to lexicon fea-
tures, especially those from SentiStrength. Sen-
tiStrength focuses solely on positive and negative
classes, but provides numeric scores for each.

6.1.1 Moderate-to-High Intensity Prediction

In some applications, it may be more important
for a system to correctly determine emotion inten-
sities in the higher range of the scale than in the
lower range of the scale. To assess performance in
the moderate-to-high range of the intensity scale,
we calculated correlation scores over a subset of
the test data formed by taking only those instances
with gold emotion intensity scores ≥ 0.5.

Table 6 shows the results. Firstly, the correla-
tion scores are in general lower here in the 0.5
to 1 range of intensity scores than in the experi-
ments over the full intensity range. This is sim-
ply because this is a harder task as now the sys-
tems do not benefit by making coarse distinctions
over whether a tweet is in the lower range or in the
higher range. Nonetheless, we observe that many
of the broad patterns of results stay the same, with
some differences. Lexicons still play a crucial
role, however, now embeddings and word ngrams
are not far behind. SentiStrength seems to be less
useful in this range, suggesting that its main bene-
fit was separating low- and high-intensity sadness
words. NRC-Hash-Emo is still the source of the
most predictive lexicon features.

6.2 Similarity of Emotion Pairs
Humans are capable of hundreds of emotions, and
some are closer to each other than others. One rea-
son why certain emotion pairs may be perceived as
being close is that their manifestation in language
is similar, for example, similar words and expres-
sion are used when expressing both emotions. We
quantify this similarity of linguistic manifestation
by using the Tweet Emotion Intensity dataset for
the following experiment: we train our regression
system (with features WN + WE + L) on the train-
ing data for one emotion and evaluate predictions
on the test data for a different emotion.

Table 7 shows the results. The numbers in the
diagonal are results obtained using training and
test data pertaining to the same emotion. These
results are upperbound benchmarks for the non-
diagonal results, which are expected to be lower.
We observe that negative emotions are positively
correlated with each other and negatively corre-
lated with the only positive emotion (joy). The
absolute values of these correlations go from r =
0.23 to r = 0.65. This shows that all of the emo-
tion pairs are correlated at least to some extent,
but that in some cases, for example, when learning
from fear data and predicting sadness scores, one
can obtain results (r = 0.63) close to the upper-
bound benchmark (r = 0.65).26 Note also that the
correlations are asymmetric. This means that even
though one emotion may be strongly predictive of

260.63 and 0.65 are not statistically significantly different.

fear 0.46 0.65 -0.39 0.63

lation on all target tweets.

another, the predictive power need not be similar
in the other direction. We also found that train-
ing on a simple combination of both the fear and
sadness data and using the model to predict sad-
ness obtained a correlation of 0.67 (exceeding the
score obtained with just the sadness training set).27

Domain adaptation may provide further gains.
To summarize, the experiments in this section

show the extent to which two emotion are simi-
lar as per their manifestation in language. For the
four emotions studied here, the similarities vary
from small (joy with fear) to considerable (fear
with sadness). Also, the similarities are asymmet-
ric. We also show that in some cases it is bene-
ficial to use the training data for another emotion
to supplement the training data for the emotion of
interest. A promising avenue of future work is to
test theories of emotion composition: e.g, whether
optimism is indeed a combination of joy and an-
ticipation, whether awe if fear and surprise, and so
on, as some have suggested (Plutchik, 1980).

7 Conclusions

We created the first emotion intensity dataset for
tweets. We used best–worst scaling to improve
annotation consistency and obtained fine-grained
scores. We showed that emotion-word hashtags
often impact emotion intensity, often conveying a
more intense emotion. We created a benchmark
regression system and conducted experiments to
show that affect lexicons, especially those with
fine word–emotion association scores, are use-
ful in determining emotion intensity. Finally, we
showed the extent to which emotion pairs are cor-
related, and that the correlations are asymmetric—
e.g., fear is strongly indicative of sadness, but sad-
ness is only moderately indicative of fear.

A Appendix

A.1 Best–Worst Scaling Questionnaire used
to Obtain Emotion Intensity Scores

The BWS questionnaire used for obtaining fear
annotations is shown below.

Degree Of Fear In English Language Tweets
The scale of fear can range from not fearful at all
(zero amount of fear) to extremely fearful. One
can often infer the degree of fear felt or expressed
by a person from what they say. The goal of this
task is to determine this degree of fear. Since it is
hard to give a numerical score indicating the de-
gree of fear, we will give you four different tweets
and ask you to indicate to us:

• Which of the four speakers is likely to be the
MOST fearful, and

• Which of the four speakers is likely to be the
LEAST fearful.

Important Notes

• This task is about fear levels of the speaker (and
not about the fear of someone else mentioned
or spoken to).

• If the answer could be either one of two or
more speakers (i.e., they are likely to be equally
fearful), then select any one of them as the
answer.

• Most importantly, try not to over-think the
answer. Let your instinct guide you.

EXAMPLE

Speaker 1: Don’t post my picture on FB #grrr
Speaker 2: If the teachers are this incompetent, I
am afraid what the results will be.
Speaker 3: Results of medical test today #terrified
Speaker 4: Having to speak in front of so many
people is making me nervous.

Q1. Which of the four speakers is likely to be the
MOST fearful?
– Multiple choice options: Speaker 1, 2, 3, 4 –
Ans: Speaker 3

Q2. Which of the four speakers is likely to be the
LEAST fearful?
– Multiple choice options: Speaker 1, 2, 3, 4 –
Ans: Speaker 1

The questionnaires for other emotions are similar
in structure. In a post-annotation survey, the re-
spondents gave the task high scores for clarity of
instruction (4.2/5) despite noting that the task it-
self requires some non-trivial amount of thought
(3.5 out of 5 on ease of task).

A.2 Use of Emotion Word Hashtags

Emotion word hashtags (e.g., #angry, #fear) have
been used to search and compile sets of tweets
that are likely to convey the emotions of interest.
Often, these tweets are used in one of two ways:
1. As noisy training data for distant supervision
(Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Mohammad, 2012; Sut-
tles and Ide, 2013). 2. As data that is manually
annotated for emotions to create training and test
datasets suitable for machine learning (Roberts
et al., 2012; Qadir and Riloff, 2014; Mohammad
et al., July 2015).28 We use emotion word hashtag
to create annotated data similar to ‘2’, however,
we use them to create separate emotion intensity
datasets for each emotion. We also examine the
impact of emotion word hashtags on emotion in-
tensity. This has not been studied before, even
though there is work on learning hashtags asso-
ciated with particular emotions (Qadir and Riloff,
2013), and on showing that some emotion word
hashtags are strongly indicative of the presence of
an emotion in the rest of the tweet, whereas others
are not (Kunneman et al., 2014).

A.3 AffectiveTweets Weka Package

AffectiveTweets includes five filters for converting
tweets into feature vectors that can be fed into the
large collection of machine learning algorithms
implemented within Weka. The package is
installed using the WekaPackageManager and can
be used from the Weka GUI or the command line
interface. It uses the TweetNLP library (Gimpel
et al., 2011) for tokenization and POS tagging.
The filters are described as follows.
• TweetToSparseFeatureVector filter: calculates

the following sparse features: word n-grams
(adding a NEG prefix to words occurring in
negated contexts), character n-grams (CN),
POS tags, and Brown word clusters.29

28Often, the query term is removed from the tweet so as to
erase obvious cues for a classification task.

29The scope of negation was determined by a simple
heuristic: from the occurrence of a negator word up until a
punctuation mark or end of sentence. We used a list of 28
negator words such as no, not, won’t and never.

• TweetToLexiconFeatureVector filter: calculates
features from a fixed list of affective lexicons.

• TweetToInputLexiconFeatureVector: calculates
features from any lexicon. The input lexicon
can have multiple numeric or nominal word–
affect associations.

• TweetToSentiStrengthFeatureVector filter:
calculates positive and negative sentiment
intensities for a tweet using the SentiStrength
lexicon-based method (Thelwall et al., 2012)

• TweetToEmbeddingsFeatureVector filter: calcu-
lates a tweet-level feature representation us-
ing pre-trained word embeddings supporting
the following aggregation schemes: average of
word embeddings; addition of word embed-
dings; and concatenation of the first k word em-
beddings in the tweet. The package also pro-
vides Word2Vec’s pre-trained word embeddings.

Additional filters for creating affective lexicons
from tweets and support for distant supervision are
currently under development.

A.4 An Interactive Visualization to Explore
the Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset

We created an interactive visualization to allow
ease of exploration of this new dataset. The
visualization has several components:
1. Tables showing the percentage of instances in

each of the emotion partitions (train, dev, test).
Hovering over a row shows the corresponding
number of instances. Clicking on an emotion
filters out data from all other emotions, in all
visualization components. Similarly, one can
click on just the train, dev, or test partitions to
view information just for that data. Clicking
again deselects the item.

2. A histogram of emotion intensity scores. A
slider that one can use to view only those
tweets within a certain score range.

3. The list of tweets, emotion label, and emotion
intensity scores.

One can use filters in combination. For e.g., click-
ing on fear, test data, and setting the slider for the
0.5 to 1 range, shows information for only those
fear–testdata instances with scores ≥ 0.5.
