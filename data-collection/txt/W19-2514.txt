Abstract

The detection of allusive text reuse is partic-
ularly challenging due to the sparse evidence
on which allusive references rely—commonly
based on none or very few shared words. Ar-
guably, lexical semantics can be resorted to
since uncovering semantic relations between
words has the potential to increase the support
underlying the allusion and alleviate the lexi-
cal sparsity. A further obstacle is the lack of
evaluation benchmark corpora, largely due to
the highly interpretative character of the anno-
tation process. In the present paper, we aim to
elucidate the feasibility of automated allusion
detection. We approach the matter from an In-
formation Retrieval perspective in which refer-
encing texts act as queries and referenced texts
as relevant documents to be retrieved, and esti-
mate the difficulty of benchmark corpus com-
pilation by a novel inter-annotator agreement
study on query segmentation. Furthermore,
we investigate to what extent the integration of
lexical semantic information derived from dis-
tributional models and ontologies can aid re-
trieving cases of allusive reuse. The results
show that (i) despite low agreement scores,
using manual queries considerably improves
retrieval performance with respect to a win-
dowing approach, and that (ii) retrieval perfor-
mance can be moderately boosted with distri-
butional semantics.

1 Introduction

In the 20th century, intertextuality emerged as an
influential concept in literary criticism. Originally
developed by French deconstructionist theorists,
such as Kristeva and Barthes, the term broadly
refers to the phenomenon where texts integrate
(fragments of) other texts or allude to them (Orr,
2003). In the minds of both authors and read-
ers, intertexts can establish meaningful connec-
tions between works, evoking particular stylistic

Reference (Vulgata, Ep 3,19) “scire
etiam supereminentem scientiae cari-
tatem Christi ut impleamini in omnem
plenitudinem Dei”

“and to know the love (caritas) of Christ
that is beyond knowledge, such that
you’d be filled with all fullness of God”

Reuse (Bernard, Sermo 8, 7.l) “Oscu-
lum plane dilectionis et pacis, sed dilec-
tio illa supereminet omni scientiae, et
pax illa omnem sensum exsuperat”

“It is a kiss of love and peace, but of that
kind of love (dilectio) that is beyond any
knowledge, and of that kind of peace
that surpasses all senses.”

effects and interpretations of a text. Existing cate-
gorizations (Bamman and Crane, 2008; Mellerin,
2014; Büchler, 2013; Hohl Trillini and Quassdorf,
2010) emphasize the broad spectrum of intertexts,
which can range from direct quotations, over para-
phrased passages to highly subtle allusions.

With the emergence of computational methods
in literary studies over the past decades, inter-
textuality has often been presented as a promis-
ing application, helping scholars identifying po-
tential intertextual links that had previously gone
unnoticed. Much progress has been made in this
area and a number of highly useful tools are now
available—e.g. Tracer (Büchler, 2013) or Tesserae
(Coffee et al., 2012). This paper, however, aims
to contribute to a number of open issues that still
present significant challenges to the further devel-
opment of the field.

Most scholarship continues to focus on the de-



105

tection of relatively literal instances of so-called
‘text reuse’, as intertextuality is commonly – and
somewhat restrictively – referred to in the field.
Such instances are relatively unambiguous and
unproblematic to detect using n-gram matching,
fingerprinting and string alignment algorithms.
Much less research has been devoted to the de-
tection of fuzzier instances of text reuse hold-
ing between passages that lack a significant lexi-
cal correspondence. This situation is aggravated
by the severe lack of openly available benchmark
datasets. An additional hindrance is that the es-
tablishment of intertextual links is to a high de-
gree subjective – both regarding the existence of
particular intertextual links and the exact scope of
the correspondence in both fragments. Studies of
inter-annotator agreement are surprisingly rare in
the field, which might be partially due to to the fact
that existing agreement metrics are hard to port to
this problem.

Contributions In this paper, we report on an
empirical feasibility study, focusing on the an-
notation and automated detection of allusive text
reuse. We focus on biblical intertext in the works
of Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153), an influen-
tial medieval writer known for his pervasive ref-
erences to the Bible. The paper has two main
parts. In the first part, we formulate an adaptation
of Fleiss’s κ that allows us to quantitatively esti-
mate and discuss the level of inter-annotator agree-
ment concerning the span of the intertexts. While
annotators show considerably low levels of agree-
ment, We show that manual segmentation has nev-
ertheless a big impact on the automatic retrieval
of allusive reuse. In the second part, we offer an
evaluation of current Information Retrieval (IR)
techniques for allusive text reuse detection. We
confirm that semantic retrieval models based on
word and sentence embeddings do not present ad-
vantages over hand-crafted scoring functions from
previous studies, and that both are outperformed
by conventional retrieval models based on TfIdf.
Finally, we show how a recently introduced tech-
nique, soft cosine, allows us to combine lexical
and semantic information to obtain significant im-
provements over any other considered model.

2 Related Work

Previous research on text reuse detection in liter-
ary texts has extensively explored methods such
as n-gram matching (Büchler et al., 2014) and se-

quence alignment algorithms (Lee, 2007; Smith
et al., 2014). In such approaches, fuzzier forms of
intertextual links are accounted for through the use
of edit distance comparisons or the inclusion of
abstract linguistic information such as word lem-
mata or part-of-speech tags, and lexical semantic
relationships extracted from WordNet. More re-
cently, researchers have started to explore tech-
niques from the field of distributional semantics in
order to capture allusive text reuse. Scheirer et al.
(2016), for instance, have applied latent-semantic
indexing (LSI) to find semantic connections and
evaluated such method on a set of 35 allusive ref-
erences to Vergil’s Aeneis in the first book of Lu-
can’s Civil War.

Previous research in the field of text reuse has
also focused on the more specific problem of find-
ing allusive references. One of the first stud-
ies (Bamman and Crane, 2008) looked at allu-
sion detection in literary text using an IR approach
exploiting textual features at a diversity of lev-
els (including morphology and syntax) but col-
lected only qualitative evidence on the efficiency
of such approach. More ambitiously, Bamman and
Crane (2009) approached the task of finding allu-
sive references across texts in different languages
using string alignment algorithms from machine
translation. Besides the afore-mentioned work by
Scheirer et al. (2016), the work by Moritz et al.
(2016) is highly related to the present study, since
the authors also worked on allusive reuse from the
Bible in the works of Bernard. In their work, the
authors focused on modeling text reuse patterns
based on a set of transformation rules defined over
string case, lemmata, POS tags and synset rela-
tionships: (syno-/hypo-/co-hypo-)nymy. More re-
cently, Moritz et al. (2018) conducted a quantita-
tive comparison of such transformation rules with
paraphrase detection methods on the task of pre-
dicting paraphrase relation between text pairs but
do not evaluate the method in an IR setup.

3 Dataset

The basis for the present study stems from the Bib-
lIndex project (Mellerin, 2014), which aims to in-
dex biblical references found in Christian litera-
ture.1 More specifically, we use a subset of man-
ually identified biblical references from Bernard
of Clairvaux which was kindly shared with us by
Laurence Mellerin. The provided data consists of

http://www.biblindex.mom.fr/


106

85 Sermons, totalling 199,508 words. The data
came already tokenized and lemmatized. Bible
references were tagged with a URL mapping to
the corresponding Bible verse from the Vulgata
edition of the medieval Bible in the online BiblIn-
dex database. We extracted the online text of the
Vulgata and used the URLs to match references
in Bernard with the corresponding Bible verses.
Since the online BiblIndex database does not pro-
vide lemmatized text, we applied an state-of-the-
art lemmatizer for Medieval Latin (Manjavacas
et al., (in press) to obtain a lemmatized version of
the Vulgata. The resulting corpus data comprises
a total of 34,835 verses totalling 586,285 tokens
and amounting to a vocabulary size of 46,025 to-
ken types.

BiblIndex distinguishes three types of refer-
ences: quotation, mention and allusion. While the
links in the first two types are in their vast majority
exact or near-exact lexical matches, the latter type
comprises mostly references that fall into what is
commonly known as allusive text reuse. Although
our focus lies on the allusive category, Table 1 dis-
plays statistics about all these types in order to ap-
preciate the characteristics of the task. As shown
in Table 1 (last row), allusions are characterized by
low Jaccard coefficients – in set-theoretical terms,
the ratio of the intersection over the union of the
sets of words of both passages. On average, an-
notated allusions share 6% of the word forms with
their targets and 12% of the lemmata. In compar-
ison, mentions and quotations have 25% or more
tokens and 30% or more lemmata in common. The
full distribution of token and lemma overlap for
allusions shown in Fig. 2 indicates that more than
500 ( 65%) instances have at most 1 token in com-
mon; about more than 400 ( 50%) share at most 1
lemma.

4 Annotation

Conventional systems in text reuse detection typ-
ically work by segmenting texts into consecutive,
equal-length chunks of texts, which are then used
as queries to find cross-document matches. For
(semi-)literal cases of reuse, this matching proce-
dure yields good results and overlapping or ad-
jacent matches can be easily merged into longer
units of reuse. For allusive text reuse, such an ap-
proach seems unfeasible at the current stage, par-
tially because the definition of the relevant query
units is much harder to establish. As shown in Ta-
ble 1, the annotated allusive references are mere
‘anchors’, consisting of single words or single
multi-word expressions that cannot be easily used
as queries. This is in agreement with pragmatic
editorial conventions, which favour uncompromis-
ing signposting of references at anchor words over
establishing particular decisions on the scope of
the reference. However, from the point of view
of the evaluation of IR systems, the provided ed-
itorial anchors must be turned into fully-fleshed,
neatly delineated queries. In order to accomplish
this, we have conducted an annotation experiment,
which we will describe next.

4.1 Full dataset annotation

The aim of the annotation was to determine the
scope of a biblical reference identified by the ed-
itors in text by Bernard. From an IR perspective,
the annotation task consists of delineating the ap-
propriate input query, given the anchor word in
the source text and the corresponding Bible verse.
An example annotation is shown in Fig. 1 where
the anchor word provided by the editors is “scien-
tiae” and the corresponding annotated query spans
the subclause “sed dilection illa supereminet omni
scientiae”. Naturally, such references not always
correspond to full sentences and often go over sen-
tence boundaries.

The dataset was distributed evenly across 4 an-
notators, who worked independently through a
custom-built interface. All annotators were pro-
ficient readers of Medieval Latin with expertise
ranging from graduate student to professor. The
annotators were familiar with the text reuse de-
tection task and were given explicit instructions
that can be summarized as follows: given a pre-
viously identified allusion between the Bernardine
passage surrounding an anchor word, on the one
hand, and a specific Bible verse on the other hand,

annotate the minimal textual span in the Bernar-
dine passage that is maximally allusive to the Bible
verse. For the sake of simplicity, the interface only
allowed continuous annotation spans and the an-
notated span had to include the pre-identified an-
chor token. Of a total of 876 initial instances, we
discarded 147 cases in which annotators expressed
doubts on the existence of the alleged reference or
could not precisely decide the span. This decision
was taken in order to ensure a high quality in the
resulting benchmark data.

4.2 Inter-annotator agreement experiment

Determining the scope of an allusive reference is
a relevant task for two reasons. Firstly, we expect
this task to be reader-dependent, and thus highly
subjective, given the minimal lexical overlap be-
tween the source and target passage. Measuring
the agreement between annotators sheds new light
on the overall feasibility of the task. Secondly, the
resulting annotations allow us to critically evalu-
ate the performance of existing retrieval methods
under near-perfect segmentation conditions: if the
correct source query is given, what is the perfor-
mance of existing methods when attempting to re-
trieve the correct Bible verse in the target data?

Measuring inter-annotator agreement Inter-
annotator agreement coefficients such as Fleiss’s
κ and Krippendorff’s α are typically defined in
terms of labels assigned to items in a multi-class
classification setup (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).
In the present case, however, the annotation in-
volves making a decision on the span of words
surrounding an anchor word that better captures
the allusion and it is unclear how to quantify the
variation in annotation performance. A naı̈ve ap-
proach defined in terms of number of overlaping
words has a number of undesirable issues. For ex-
ample, since the annotations are centered around
the anchor word, a relatively high amount of over-

lap is to be expected for short annotations. More-
over, disagreements over otherwise largely agree-
ing long spans should weigh in less than disagree-
ments over otherwise largely agreeing small spans.
Additionally, it is unclear how to quantify the rate
of agreement expected under chance-level annota-
tion, a quantity that needs to be corrected for in
order to to obtain reliable and non-inflated inter-
annotator agreement coefficients (Artstein, 2017).
We have found that an extension of the Jaccard
coefficient defined over sequences can help adapt
Fleiss’s κ to our case and tackle such issues.

Given any pair of span annotations, s and t, we
can define overlap in a similar way to the Jaccard
index, as the intersection (i.e. the Longest Com-
mon Substring) over the union (i.e. the total num-
ber of selected tokens by both annotators):

O =
LCS(s, t)

|s|+ |t| − LCS(s, t)
(1)

Interestingly, this quantity can be decomposed
into an agreement A(s, t) = LCS(s, t) (number
of tokens in common) and a disagreement score
D(s, t) = |s| + |t| − 2 · LCS(s, t) (number of
tokens not shared with the other annotator):

O =
A

A+D
(2)

The advantage of this reformulation is that it
lets us see more easily how O is bounded be-
tween 0 and 1, and also that it gives us a way
of computing the expected overlap score Oe by
aggregating dataset-level A and D scores: Oe =
Ae/(Ae +De), with

Ae =

∑
s,tA(s, t)

|s, t|
;Dw =

∑
s,tD(s, t)

|s, t|
(3)

where |s, t| refers to the number of unordered



108

annotation pairs in the dataset2. Oe can be thus in-
terpreted as the expected overlap between two ar-
bitrary annotators. The final inter-annotator agree-
ment score is defined following Fleiss’s:

κ =
Oo −Oe
1−Oe

(4)

where Oo refers to the dataset average of Eq. 2.

Inter-annotator agreement results and discus-
sion In order to estimate κ for our dataset, we
extracted a random sample of 60 instances which
were thoroughly annotated by 3 of the annotators.
We obtain a κ = 0.22, which compares unfa-
vorably with respect to commonly assumed reli-
ability ranges. For example, values in the range
κ ∈ (0.67, 0.8) are considered fair agreement
(Schütze et al., 2008). While our result remains
hard to assess in the absence of comparable work,
it is low enough to cast doubts over the feasibil-
ity of the task, which is in fact rarely explicitly
questioned. The annotators informally reported
that, against their expectations, the task was not
straightforward and required a considerable level
of concentration and interpretation. Such situation
may be due to particularities of Bernard’s usage of
biblical language. Besides conventional, direct al-
lusions, Bernard is also known for pointed use of
single, significant allusive words, which are hard
to isolate. Still it should be noted that in some
instances inter-annotator agreement was high and,
as Fig. 3(b) shows, in 22% of all pairwise com-
parisons even perfect. This suggests that there ex-
ist clear differences at the level of individual allu-
sions. We now turn to the question how well cur-
rent retrieval approaches perform, given manually
segmented queries.

5 Retrieval Experiments

Given the small amounts of lexical overlap in the
allusive text reuse datasets (c.f. Table 1), we aim
to investigate and quantify to which extent seman-
tic information can help improving retrieval of al-
lusive references. For this reason, we look into 3
types of models. First, we look at purely lexical-
based approaches. Secondly, approaches based
on distributional semantics and, in particular, re-
trieval approaches that utilize word embeddings.
Finally, we look at hybrid approaches that can ac-
commodate relative amounts of semantic informa-

the number of annotations and k the number of annotators.

tion into what is otherwise a purely lexical model.
From the retrieval point of view, all approaches
fall into one of two categories: retrieval methods
based on similarity in vector space and retrieval
methods using domain-specific similarity scoring
functions.

5.1 Lexical
Hand-crafted scoring function Previous work
has devised hand-crafted scoring functions tar-
geted at retrieving intertextual relationships simi-
lar to those found in Bernard (Forstall et al., 2015).
The scoring function is used in an online retrieval
system3 and is defined by Eq. 5:

T (s, t) = ln

(∑
w∈(S∩T )

1
f(w,s)

+ 1f(w,t)
ds + dt

)
(5)

where f(w,d) refers to the frequency of word w in
document d and dd refers to the distance in tokens
between the two most infrequent words in docu-
ment d. Note that T (s, t) is only defined for cases
in which documents share at least 2 words, since
otherwise the denominator cannot be computed.
While this presents a clear disadvantage, it also
lends itself to evaluation in a hybrid fashion with a
complementary back-off model operating on pas-
sages with lower overlap. While originally f(w,s)
is defined with respect to the query (or target) doc-
ument, we observed such choice yielded poor per-
formance (probably due to the small size of the
documents), and, therefore, we use frequency es-
timates extracted from the respective document
collections instead. We refer to this model as
Tesserae.

BOW & TfIdf We include retrieval models
based on a bag-of-words document representation
(BOW) and cosine similarity for ranking. In a
BOW space model, a document d is represented
by a vector where the ith entry represents the fre-
quency of the ith word in d. Beyond word counts,
it is customary to apply the Tf-Idf transformation,
that targets the fact that the importance of a word
for a document is also dependent on how specific
it is to that document. Tf-Idf for the ith word
is computed as the product of its frequency in d,
denoted Tf(w, d), and its inverse document fre-
quency, Idf(w, d), defined by Eq. 6:

Idf(w, d) = log

(
|D|

1 + |{d ∈ D : w ∈ d}|

)

histogram, perhaps indicating a qualitative difference in the dataset. One with high overlap scores close to 1.0 and
another one at around 0.6 (close to the overall overlap mean).

We refer to these retrieval models as BOW and
TfIdf. Given document vector representations in
some common space, we can compute their simi-
larity score based on the cosine similarity between
such vectors:

cos(−→s ,−→t ) =
∑

i siti√∑
i s

√∑

(7)

5.2 Semantic

We define a number of semantic models based on
distributional semantics and, in particular, word
embeddings. We use FastText word embed-
dings (Bojanowski et al., 2017) trained with de-
fault parameters on a large collection of Latin texts
provided by (Bamman and Crane, 2011), which
include 8.5GB of text of varying quality.4

Sentence Embeddings We use distributional se-
mantic models based on the idea of computing a
sentence embedding through a composition func-
tion operating over the individual embeddings of
words in the sentence. The most basic compo-
sition function is averaging over the single word
embeddings in the sentence (Wieting et al., 2015).
We can take into account the relative importance
of words to a given sentence using the Tf-Idf trans-
formation defined in Section 5.1 and compute a
Tf-Idf weighted average word embedding. We re-

4 All the relevant materials are available at the following
URL: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ dbamman/latin.html. We also
experimented with an LSI retrieval model (Deerwester et al.,
1990), similar to the one used by (Scheirer et al., 2016), but
found it performed poorly on this dataset due to the small size
of the documents in our dataset.

fer to these models as BOWemb and TfIdfemb re-
spectively.

Word Mover’s Distance WMD is a metric based
on the transportation problem known as Earth
Mover’s Distance but defined for documents over
word embeddings. WMD has shown excellent per-
formance in document retrieval tasks where se-
mantics play an important role (Kusner et al.,
2015). Intuitively, WMD is grounded on the idea of
minimizing the amount of “travel cost” incurred
in moving the word histogram of a document s
into the word histogram of t, where the “travel
distance” between words wi and wj is given by
their respective distance in the embedding space
cos(wi, wj). Formally, WMD is computed by find-
ing a so-called flow matrix T ∈ RV xV —where
Tij denotes how much of word wi in s travels to
wordwj in t—such that

∑
i,j Ti,jc(wi, wj) is min-

imized. Computing WMD involves solving a lin-
ear programming problem for which specialized
solvers exist.5

5.3 Hybrid

We look into methods that are able to encompass
both lexical and semantic information.

Tesserae + WMD as backoff model (T+WMD)
Since Tesserae score is only defined for docu-
ment pairs with at least 2 words in common, it can
be easily combined with other models in a backoff
fashion. In particular, we evaluate this setup using
WMD as the backoff model since it proved to be the

package (Laszuk, 2017)

most efficient purely semantic model.6

Soft Cosine A more principled approach to
combining lexical and semantic information is
based on the soft cosine similarity function, which
was first introduced by (Sidorov et al., 2014) and
has been recently used in a shared-task winning
contribution by (Charlet and Damnati, 2017) for
question semantic similarity. Soft cosine gener-
alizes cosine similarity by considering not only
how similar vectors s and t across feature i but
more generally across any given pair of features
i, j. Soft cosine is defined by Eq. 8:

soft cos(−→s ,−→t ) =
∑

i,j Si,jsitj√∑
i,j Si,jsisj

√∑
i,j Si,jtitj

(8)
with S ∈ RV xV representing a matrix where

Si,j expresses the similarity between the ith and
the jth word in the vocabulary. It can be seen that
soft cosine reduces to cosine when S is taken to be
the identity matrix.

Soft cosine is a flexible function since it lets us
use any linguistic resource to estimate the simi-
larity between words. For our purposes, matrix S
can be estimated on the basis of WordNet-based
semantic relatedness measures or word embed-
ding based semantic similarity estimates. More
concretely, we define the following two mod-
els. SCwn, which uses a similarity function based
on the size of the group of synonyms extracted
from the Latin WordNet (Minozzi, 2010): Si,j =

1
|Ti∩Tj | where Ti refers to the set of synonyms of
the ith word. SCemb which exploits word embed-
ding similarity Si,j = max(0, cos(−→wi,−→wj) over
embeddings−→wi,−→wj . All soft cosine-based retrieval
models are applied on TfIdf document repre-
sentations. In agreement with previous research
(Charlet and Damnati, 2017), we boost the rela-
tive difference in similarity between the upper and
lower quantiles of the similarity distribution by
raising S to the nth-power.7

6 We note that for this retrieval setup to be used in practice
WMD and Tesserae similarity scores must be transformed
into a common scale. In the present paper, we assume an
oracle on the lexical overlap with the relevant document and
therefore the resulting numbers must be interpreted as an op-
timal score given perfect scaling.

7 During development we found that raising S to the 5th
power yielded the best results across similarity functions in
all cases.

5.4 Evaluation

Given a Bernardian reference as a query for-
mulated by the annotators and the collection of
Biblical candidate documents, all evaluated mod-
els produce a ranking. Using such a ranking,
we evaluate retrieval performance over the set of
queries Q using Mean Reciprocal Rank8 (MRR)
(Voorhees, 1999) defined in Eq. 9:

MRR(Q) =
1

|Q|

|Q|∑
j=1

1

|Rj |
(9)

Additionally, we also report Precision@K—
based on how often the system is expected to
retrieve the relevant document within the first k
results—since it is a more interpretable measure
from the point of view of the retrieval system user.

It must be noted that P@K and MRR are not
suitable metrics to evaluate a text reuse detection
system on unrestricted data, since, in fact, most
naturally occurring text is not allusive. However,
the focus of the present paper lies on the feasi-
bility of allusive text detection, which we aim to
elucidate on the basis of a pre-annotated dataset
in which each query is guaranteed to match to a
relevant document in the target collection. The
results must therefore be interpreted taking into
account the artificial situation, where the selected
queries are already known to contain allusions and
the question is how well different systems recog-
nize the alluded verse.

Results As shown in Table 2, the best model
overall is SCemb, achieving 21.95 MRR and
47.60 P@20, closely followed by another soft
cosine-based hybrid approach: SCwn. Interest-
ingly, a simple TfIfd baseline over lemmatized
input results in strong ranking performance, sur-
passing all other purely lexical – including the
hand-crafted Tesserae – and all purely seman-
tic models. In agreement with general expec-
tations, all models benefit from lemmatized in-
put and TfIdf transformation (both as input rep-
resentation in purely lexical models and as a
weighting scheme for the sentence embeddings
in purely semantic approaches). WMD outper-
forms any other purely semantic model, but as al-
ready pointed out, it compares negatively to the
purely lexical TfIdf baseline. The combination

range into the [0− 100] range.

of Tesserae with WMD as back-off proves use-
ful and outperforms both approaches in isolation,
highlighting that they model complementary as-
pects of text reuse.

In order to test the specific contribution of the
similarity function used to estimate S, we compare
results with soft cosine using a random similarity
matrix (Srnd) defined by Eq. 10:

Si,j =

{
i = j 1

i 6= j ∼ N (0.5, 0.05)
(10)

We also investigate the effect of the word embed-
ding algorithm by comparing to SCemb based on
word2vec embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013).
As Table 3 shows, FastText embeddings, an al-
gorithm known to capture not just semantic but
also morphological relations, yields strong im-
provements over word2vec. Moreover, a ran-
dom approach produces strong results, only un-
derperforming the word2vec model by a small
margins, which questions the usefulness of the se-
mantic relationships induced by word2vec for
the present task.

Table 4: Comparison of best performing approach
SCemb across different segmentation types: manual
and automatic window of 3 (Win-3) and 10 (Win-10)
tokens to each side of the anchor word.

Finally, we test the relative importance of the
query segmentation to the retrieval of allusive text
reuse. For this purpose, we evaluate our best
model (SCemb) on a version of the dataset in
which the referencing text is segmented according
to a window approach, selecting n words around
the anchor expression.

As Table 4 shows, results on manually seg-
mented text are always significantly better than on
automated segmentation. A window of 10-word
around the anchor produces slightly better results
than a 3-word window – more closely matching
the overall mean length of manually annotated
queries. This indicates the importance of localiz-
ing the appropriate set of referential words in con-
text, while avoiding the inclusion of confounding
terms. In other words, both precision and recall
matter to segmentation, an issue that has been ob-
served previously (Bamman and Crane, 2009).

Qualitative inspection To appreciate the effect
of the soft cosine using a semantic similarity ma-
trix, it is worthwhile to inspect a hand-picked se-
lection of items which were correctly retrieved



112

by SCemb but not by TfIdf.9 In Fig 4, the
distributional approach adequately captures the
antonymic relation between visibilis (‡) and invis-
ibilis (†), which is reinforced by the synonymy be-
tween species (‡) and imago (†). Similar mecha-
nisms seem at work in Fig 5, where the semantic
similarity between vinery-related words increases
the overall similarity score (botrus, palmes, uva,
granatus).

Figure 4

Figure 5

Figure 6

Although the SC offers a welcome boost in
retrieval performance, many errors remain. A
first and frequent category are allusions that are
simply hard to detect, even for human read-
ers, often because they are very short or cryptic
such as Fig 7, where despite increased seman-
tic support—cognovissent being synonymous with
intellexerint—the match is missed.

A second type of error occurs when less relevant
candidates are pushed higher in the rank due to se-
mantic reinforcements in the wrong direction. For
example, in Fig 6 we have a query together with
a wrongly retrieved match (dico enim . . . ) and the
true, non retrieved reference (et civitatem . . . ). We
observe that due to the high similarity of redun-
dantly repeated perception verbs (video, audio),
the wrong match receives high similarity whereas
the true reference remains at lower rank.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

Our experiments have highlighted the difficulties
of automated allusion detection. Even assum-

9 In the examples, we display the relative contribution
made by each term in a sentence to the total similarity score
(darker red implies higher contribution). Queries are pre-
ceded by a double dagger (‡) and Bible references by a simple
dagger (†).

Figure 7

ing manually defined queries, the best perform-
ing model could only find the matching reference
within the top 20 hits in less than half of the
dataset. Moreover, the retrieval quality heavily
drops when relying on windowing for query con-
struction. This aspect calls for further research
into the problem of automatic query construction
for the detection of allusive reuse.

Across all our experiments, purely semantic
models are consistently outperformed by a purely
lexical TfIdf model. Similarly, lemmatization
boosts the performance of nearly all models which
also suggests that ensuring enough lexical overlap
is still a crucial aspect of allusive reuse retrieval.
A similar reasoning helps explaining the superior-
ity of FastText over word2vec embeddings,
since the former is better at capturing morpholog-
ical relationships – and lemma word embeddings
suffer from data sparsity in the latter.

Overall, the hybrid models involving soft cosine
show best performance, which indicates the effec-
tiveness of such technique to incorporate seman-
tics into BOW-based document retrieval and offers
evidence that improvements in allusive reuse de-
tection, however limited, can be gained from lexi-
cal semantics.

An interesting direction for future research is
the application of soft cosine to text reuse detec-
tion across languages, leveraging current advances
in multilingual word embeddings (Ammar et al.,
2016) to extract multilingual word similarity ma-
trices. Similarly, while the effect of adding seman-
tic information from WordNet was less effective, it
is still worth expanding the scope of semantic re-
lationship beyond synonymy and exploring the us-
age of semantic similarity measures defined over
WordNet (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001).
