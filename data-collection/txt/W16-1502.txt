Abstract. In this paper we consider sentences that contain Multiple
In-text References (MIR) and their position in the rhetorical structure
of articles. We carry out the analysis of MIR in a large scale dataset of
about 80,000 research articles published by the Public Library of Sci-
ence in 7 journals. We analyze two major characteristics of MIR: their
positions in the IMRaD structure of articles, and the number of in-text
references that make up a MIR in the di↵erent journals. We show that
MIR are rather frequent in all sections of the rhetorical structure. In the
Introduction section, sentences containing MIR account for more than
half of the sentences with references.

1 Introduction

In a scientific article, the frequency of in-text references is highly dependent
on the rhetorical structure. For example Bertin et al. [2] study the di↵erences
between the four sections of the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results and
Discussion) structure in terms of the density of citations.

The phenomenon of multiple in-text references in scientific papers has not
yet been studied. In recent works on the rhetorical structure of articles [1–3],
the studies are based on the presence of in-text references in sentences but their
number in a single sentence is not taken into consideration. Several works exist
on a related problem which is the proximity of co-citations in texts [5]. Liu and
Chen [9, 10] propose a four level co-citation proximity scheme for the levels of
article, section, paragraph and sentence.

Our approach allows to identifies multiple in-text references. In general, the
presence of more than one in-text references in the same sentence gives us infor-
mation about a relative proximity between the works that are cited. Previous
studies on in-text references take into account word windows or sentences to
study citation contexts. However, some recent works show the importance and
the di�culty in identifying citation blocks that are spans of citations that may
encompass one or more sentences [7]. Another related question, the recurrence
of in-text references or re-citations, has been the object of several studies [6, 15].

We focus on text spans in articles that contain more than one in-text ref-
erences that appear very close to each other. We consider sentences as a basic
textual unit, and we examine sentences containing more than one in-text refer-
ence. We call this phenomenon Multiple In-text References (MIR). For example,
the following sentence contains a MIR composed of 4 references, where 3 of the
references appear in the range ”[74–76]”:

”Indeed, it has long been proposed on thermodynamic grounds that transcrip-

tion factors would bind at low, nonfunctional levels throughout the genome ei-

ther via sequence-independent [74–76] or sequence-specific DNA binding [32].”3

In this paper, we present the results on the behavior of MIR and their posi-
tions in the IMRaD structure that we obtain by processing a large scale corpus
of about 80,000 research articles. The key idea involves identifying the number
of in-text references at the level of the sentence. We analyze two major charac-
teristics of MIR. The first one is their positions in the IMRaD structure, and
the second one is the number of in-text references that make up a MIR.

2 Method

To address the problem of the identification of MIR and their positions in the
rhetorical structure of articles, we have processed a large-scale corpus of articles
that follow the IMRaD structure. In fact, during the last decades, IMRaD has
imposed itself as a standard rhetorical framework for scientific articles in the
experimental sciences.

The objective of our study is to determine the locations where MIR are most
likely to appear in the rhetorical structure of scientific articles. We also study
the number of in-text references in the sentences.

2.1 Dataset

To perform this study we have analyzed a dataset of seven peer-reviewed aca-
demic journals published in Open Access by the Public Library of Science
(PLOS). Six of the journals are domain-specific (PLOS Biology, PLOS Com-
putational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Neglected Tropical
Diseases) and the 7th is PLOS ONE, which is a general journal that covers
all fields of science and social sciences. We have processed the entire dataset of
about 80,000 research articles in full text published up to September 2013.

The dataset is in the XML JATS format, where the body of the articles
consists of sections and paragraphs that are identified as distinct XML elements.
The in-text references are also, for the most part, present as XML elements and
linked to the corresponding elements in the bibliography of the article.

2.2 Identification of the IMRaD Structure

To identify the IMRaD structure of articles, we have analyzed all section titles
and categorized the sections. All seven journals use similar publication models,
where authors are explicitly encouraged to use the IMRaD structure. As a result,
more than 97% of the research articles in the corpus contain the four main section
types (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion), although not always in
the same order. While the relative position of a section may have an influence
on the number of references found in the section, e.g. a Discussion section that
appears immediately after an Introduction section may have more references
than a Discussion section that appears at the end of the article, the order in
which the sections appear in an article has not been taken into consideration for
this study. The detailed results of the analysis of the IMRaD structure for this
corpus are presented by Bertin et al. [2].

2.3 Identification and Processing of MIR

In order to identify sentences containing MIR, we need to perform the following
steps:

1. Segment all paragraphs into sentences;
2. Identify all in-text references;
3. Consider the number of in-text references in each sentence.

The first step was done by analyzing the punctuation and capitalization of the
text in order to identify sentence ends. Our corpus contains a total of 15,852,120
sentences, out of which 3,528,514 (around 22%) contain in-text references.

The second step may seem trivial given that the in-text references are present
as elements in the XML tree of the article. In the case of MIR however, this is
not always true. When in-text references are in a numeric form, reference ranges
are often present in sentences containing MIR. For example, we can consider the
following sentence in the corpus with XML markup:

”A number of recent studies have used a modification of the picture viewing

procedure by substituting pleasant pictures with photographs of loved, famil-

iar faces <xref ref-type=”bibr” rid=”pone.0041631-Bartels1”>[16]</xref> –

<xref ref-type=”bibr” rid=”pone.0041631-Xu2”>[24]</xref>.”4

The in-text references in this sentence ”[16]–[24]” are identified as two xref
elements that point to the corresponding bibliography items. In reality, the sen-
tence contains 9 di↵erent citations: all the works from [16] to [24] are cited; and
7 of these citations are not present in the XML markup. In such cases, we call
implicit in-text references those in-text references that are part of a range but
that are not mentioned by their numbers in the sentence.

In order to identify correctly MIR and their number in sentences it is im-
portant to detect in-text reference ranges and implicit references. To do this, we

first examine the context of each xref element and identify all possible ranges.
Then, we generate the list of implicit references and the links between these
references and the bibliography items. A similar method for the processing of
in-text reference ranges was used by Bertin et al. [1].

The occurrences of in-text reference ranges are rather numerous in our cor-
pus. We found out that reference ranges are present in 19.19% of all sentences
containing MIR and implicit in-text references account for 12.38% of the MIR.

3 Results

We first observe the presence of MIR in the four section types of the IMRaD
structure and then we examine the number of the MIR according to the di↵erent
journals.

3.1 Use of MIR in the IMRaD Structure

Table 1 presents the percentage of sentences containing Multiple In-text Ref-
erences (MIR) among all sentences with in-text references in the four section
types of the IMRaD Structure (I-M-R-D). We observe that MIR are present for
the most part in the Introduction section where more than half of the sentences
with in-text references contain MIR (52.78%). This result is consistent with the
observation that the Introduction section often includes a state of the art with
a literature review in which MIR are most likely to appear. As for the Methods
and Results sections, they have around 25% and 35% of MIR respectively.

I M R D Total

Sentences with MIR 52.78% 25.05% 35.59% 42.65% 41.43%
Sentences without MIR 47.22% 74.95% 64.41% 57.35% 58.57%

Table 1: MIR in the IMRaD Structure

The results in this table for the four di↵erent section types are not unex-
pected. In fact, the relative quantity of MIR in the sections follows the overall
distribution of references in the IMRaD structure, shown in Bertin et al. [2],
where the Methods section contains the smallest number of in-text references,
followed by the Results section. The Introduction section, which is also the short-
est one on average, contains the highest number of citations.

Table 1 shows also that MIR appear very often: in around 41% of all sen-
tences containing in-text references. This means that in a scientific article, the
largest number of in-text references appear in groups of several references situ-
ated closely in the textual space, i.e. in the same sentence.

15 0.05% 0.01% 0.03% 0.02%

Table 2: Percentage of sentences with MIR in the IMRaD structure

Table 2 presents the percentage of sentences with MIR of di↵erent sizes
among all sentences containing citations in each of the four section types. Consid-
ering the MIR with 2 elements, we observe that there is little di↵erence between
the sections Introduction, Results and Discussion. Then, the di↵erences between
the sections increase with the number of in-text references. This means that,
while MIR with 2 elements appear almost homogeneously in an article, the MIR
with higher number of elements are more and more exclusively reserved to the
Introduction section. This phenomenon again, is explained by the presence of
the state of the art in the Introduction with a very high concentration of in-text
references.

3.2 MIR in the PLOS Journals

Figure 1 presents the relative number of sentences with MIR in each of the
journals. The horizontal axis gives the number of in-text references in the same
sentence in a logarithmic scale. The vertical axis gives the average number of
sentences per article containing MIR in a logarithmic scale.

We observe some di↵erences between the journals in the use of very large
MIR (number of elements 20 and above). In fact, the journal PLOS Medicine
stands out because it uses MIR with relatively high number of elements.

Table 3 presents the average and the maximal number of elements in MIR
observed in the 7 journals. PLOS Medicine has the highest average number of
elements in MIR. In fact, articles in this journal tend to be short, but with a very
high number of references and many of them appearing in the same sentence.
PLOS ONE and PLOS Medicine have very high maximal number of elements in
MIR. However, as we can see on figure 1, MIR with a high number of elements
in PLOS ONE tend to be less frequent than those in PLOS Medicine.

Fig. 1: MIR in the 7 PLOS Journals

Some examples of sentences containing MIR with very high number of In-text
References are presented in table 4. In fact, these examples are extracted from
articles in the medical domain that are of a specific type: systematic reviews.
This kind of articles has for objective to sum up the best available research on a
specific topic by collecting and synthesizing the results of other studies that fit
pre-specified eligibility criteria. For this reason, we find in these articles sentences
that cite a large number of other works. Moreover, as we can see on table 4, these
sentences are not necessarily in the Introduction section but appear quite often
in the Results and Methods sections.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

We have proposed a study of Multiple In-text References (MIR) in respect of
their positions in the rhetorical structure of articles. This study shows the fol-
lowing key points:

– MIR are rather frequent in all sections of articles: 41% of the sentences with
citations contain MIR;

– In the Introduction section MIR account for more than half of the sentences
containing citations;

PLOS Medicine R The systematic review identified 188 studies that provided
prevalence estimates [18,29,36–223].

PLOS Medicine M Data for calculation of the number of snakebite envenomings
were obtained for 46 countries [9–60] while data for calcula-
tion of the number of deaths due to snakebite were obtained for
22 countries [9–11,18, 31,47,49,51,56,58–72] by this process.

PLOS ONE R As a result, 221 unique genes and 4 protein complexes (DNA-
PK, HSP70, MRN(95), RAS) were identified from around 200
papers that studied radiation response-related biomarkers [4],
[14]–[185].

PLOS ONE M Details of each study [11]–[113] were entered into a database
by one investigator with a 100% re-check.

Table 4: Examples of sentences with high number of in-text references

– The MIR with two elements are the most homogeneous: they appear quite
often in the Introduction, Results and Discussion sections (about 20% of
sentences with citations) and in about 15% of sentences with citations in the
Methods section;

– There exist sentences with very high number of in-text citations (more than
100). Such sentences are specific to the domain of medicine and the system-
atic review article type.

In this study, the notion of MIR raises the question of the importance and
role of MIR in scientific articles. We show the behavior and location of sentences
that contain MIR. The implications of this study are relevant from the perspec-
tive of networks as bibliographic coupling [8], clustering [14] and co-citation [13],
but also for the analysis of the functions of citations. Furthermore, many applica-
tions can benefit from the di↵erentiation between single and multiple references
such as automatic summarization [4, 12] or automatic generation of surveys [11].
More generally, the distribution of MIR along the text progression has impor-

tant implications for understanding the contexts of citations. For example, we
can consider the following sentence:

”Previous attempts to apply functional genomics methods to address
these questions used various approaches, including DNA microarrays
(Hayward et al. 2000; Ben Mamoun et al. 2001; Le Roch et al. 2002),
serial analysis of gene expression (Patankar et al. 2001), and mass
spectrometry (Florens et al. 2002; Lasonder et al. 2002) on a limited
number of samples from di↵erent developmental stages.”5

In this sentence, there are 3 groups of in-text references and each group
is characterized by a noun group that identifies topics related to the in-text
references. The automatic identification of these topics will allow to assign them
to each of the references.

This example shows that work at the level of sentences is not enough if
we want to obtain fine and accurate results for content citation analysis. The
observations of this study suggest the presence of MIR implies the existence of
features such as topics, keywords, methods, etc. that are common to all works
cited in the MIR group. This means that by examining the text content of such
sentences one can obtain information on the topics that are shared by the group
of cited works.
