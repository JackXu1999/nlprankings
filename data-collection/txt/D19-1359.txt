Abstract

Current research in knowledge-based Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) indicates that
performances depend heavily on the Lexical
Knowledge Base (LKB) employed. This pa-
per introduces SyntagNet, a novel resource
consisting of manually disambiguated lexical-
semantic combinations. By capturing sense
distinctions evoked by syntagmatic relations,
SyntagNet enables knowledge-based WSD
systems to establish a new state of the art
which challenges the hitherto unrivaled perfor-
mances attained by supervised approaches. To
the best of our knowledge, SyntagNet is the
first large-scale manually-curated resource of
this kind made available to the community (at
http://syntagnet.org).

1 Introduction

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the
most challenging Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks. It deals with lexical ambiguity, and
it is core to achieving the much-sought-for goal of
Natural Language Understanding (Navigli, 2018).
In a broad sense, two major approaches can be
adopted for performing WSD: the supervised and
the knowledge-based ones.

Supervised methods, which learn a classifier
from training data, have improved from 65% (Sny-
der and Palmer, 2004) to over 71% accuracy, thus
proving to perform best for WSD purposes (Yuan
et al., 2016; Melacci et al., 2018; Uslu et al., 2018).
However, supervision depends heavily on large
quantities of reliable sense-annotated data which
– especially for languages other than English – are
poorly available.

As a major alternative to supervised WSD,
knowledge-based approaches drop the require-
ment for large amounts of training data by draw-
ing on rich Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKB) such
as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and allow scaling

to multiple languages thanks to multilingual re-
sources such as BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2012). The structure of an LKB plays a key
role in increasing the overall disambiguation per-
formance. For the purposes of WSD, a criti-
cal consideration concerns the nature of the rela-
tions connecting concepts: while LKBs tend to fo-
cus on the paradigmatic dimension of language,
such resources fall short in respect of syntagmatic
relations1, which are also crucial for sense dis-
ambiguation due to interconnecting co-occurring
words (Navigli and Lapata, 2010).

In this paper we address this deficiency
and present, for the first time, a manually-
curated large-scale lexical-semantic combination2

database which associates pairs of concepts with
pairs of co-occurring words. Importantly, we
prove the effectiveness of our resource by achiev-
ing the state of the art in multilingual knowledge-
based WSD and by matching supervised WSD
performances when integrated into an LKB made
up of WordNet and the Princeton WordNet Gloss
Corpus3.

2 Related work

Several studies on knowledge-based algorithms
have indicated that the LKB structure is of vi-
tal importance in determining the accuracy of
sense disambiguation. In particular, it has been
demonstrated that WSD performance improves

1A syntagmatic relation exists between two words which
co-occur in spoken or written language more frequently than
would be expected by chance and which have different gram-
matical roles in the sentences in which they occur (Saussure,
1916).

2Here, we will use the term “lexical combination” to refer
to both lexical collocations and free word associations (with-
out considering idiomatic expressions) and the term “lexical-
semantic combination” to refer to sense-annotated lexical
combinations.

dramatically when employing an LKB with a
larger number of high-quality lexical-semantic re-
lations, i.e., more connections between concepts
(Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Lemnitzer et al., 2008;
Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010). During the last
two decades, a certain amount of work has been
carried out aimed at enriching LKBs with new
lexical-semantic relations. To this end, knowl-
edge has been (semi-)automatically extracted from
large collections of data and integrated into lexical
resources such as WordNet.

As far as semi-automatic approaches are con-
cerned, Mihalcea and Moldovan (2001) conceived
eXtended WordNet, a resource providing disam-
biguated glosses by means of a classification en-
semble combined with human supervision. A
set of manually disambiguated glosses, called the
Princeton WordNet Gloss Corpus (PWNG), which
inherently included syntagmatic content, was sub-
sequently also made available in 2008.

The rationale behind the creation of such re-
sources was substantiated in a knowledge-based
WSD study conducted by Navigli and Lapata
(2010), who hypothesized an improvement in per-
formance by several points when enriching a se-
mantic network with tens of lexical-semantic re-
lations for each target word sense. To achieve
this demanding goal, endeavors in the literature fo-
cused on the fully-automatic production of seman-
tic combinations, such as those obtained by dis-
ambiguating topic signatures (Cuadros and Rigau,
2008; Cuadros et al., 2012, KnowNet and deep-
KnowNet) or by disentangling the concepts in
ConceptNet (Chen and Liu, 2011).

More recently, Espinosa-Anke et al. (2016)
aimed at automatically enriching WordNet with
collocational information by leveraging the rela-
tions between sense-level embedding spaces (Col-
WordNet), while Simov et al. (2016) addressed
the enhancement of LKBs by exploiting relations
over semantically-annotated corpora as contextual
information. To the same end, Simov et al. (2018)
employed grammatical role embeddings to gather
new syntagmatic relations.

The lack of syntagmatic information in seman-
tic networks was also tackled by the extension of
a lexical database by means of phrasets, i.e., sets
of free combinations of words recurrently used to
express a concept (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2004).

Unfortunately, due to their (semi-)automatic
nature, the aforementioned resources could not

inherently offer wide coverage and high preci-
sion at the same time. Compared to other re-
sources geared towards knowledge-based WSD,
the novel resource we contribute in this work fea-
tures: (i) wide coverage with a broad spectrum of
possible lexical combinations, and (ii) high preci-
sion thanks to being entirely manually curated.

3 SyntagNet: a wide-coverage
lexical-semantic combination resource

In this Section, we present SyntagNet, a knowl-
edge resource created starting from lexical com-
binations extracted from the English Wikipedia4

and the British National Corpus (Leech, 1992,
BNC), and manually disambiguated according to
the WordNet 3.0 sense inventory.

3.1 Methodology
Lexical combination extraction First of all, we
employed the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline (Man-
ning et al., 2014) to extract the dependency trees5

for all the sentences in both Wikipedia and the
BNC. Then, in order to identify relevant combi-
nations, we determined the strength of correlation
between pairs of POS-tagged, lemmatized content
words6 w1, w2, co-occurring within a sliding win-
dow of 3 words. Each candidate pair (w1, w2) was
weighted using Dice’s coefficient multiplied by a
logarithmic factor of the co-occurrence frequency:

score(w1, w2) = log2(1 + nw1w2)
2nw1w2

nw1 + nw2
(1)

where nwi (i ∈ {1, 2}) is the frequency of wi
and nw1w2 is the frequency of the two words co-
occurring within a window.

Three filters were then applied in order to slim
down the list of pairs: (i) we filtered out En-
glish stopwords according to the Natural Lan-
guage Toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002, NLTK 3.4);
(ii) we discarded combinations between verbs and
verbs; (iii) we discarded combinations not linked
by any of the five most frequent dependencies in
our list, namely: compound, dobj (direct ob-
ject), iobj (indirect object), nsubj (nominal
subject) and nmod (nominal modifier).

Finally, we ranked the resulting lexical com-
bination list according to the geometric mean

between i) the logarithmic Dice scores and ii)
the frequency count of a pair in a given POS
tag/dependency combination. We show some ex-
amples with w1 = runv, together with their final
correlation score in Table 1 (left).

We then repeated the whole process described
above, with the following changes: i) we set a slid-
ing window of 6 words; ii) we removed the con-
straint on the dependency selection; iii) we filtered
out all pairs already occurring within the first list;
iv) we selected only items attested in multiple En-
glish monolingual and collocation dictionaries.

Manual disambiguation We asked eight anno-
tators to manually disambiguate the top-ranking
20, 000 lexical combinations from the first list and
58, 000 lexical combinations from the second list,
i.e., to associate each word in a pair (w1, w2) with
its most appropriate senses in WordNet (in Table 1
(right) we show the senses chosen by the annota-
tors for the corresponding lexical combinations).

The eight annotators shared a background in lin-
guistics (Master’s Degree with a minimum C1 En-
glish proficiency level) and were well acquainted
with WordNet. In order to facilitate the annotation
process, we provided each annotator with a unique
batch of lexical combinations in a simple inter-
face; for each pair, the annotators visualized all the
synsets for each word of the combination (along
with WordNet definitions and examples), and a
context of up to 25 random sentences in which the
combination was extracted. The annotators were
asked to input the sense numbers associated with
their chosen synsets for both the words in a given
pair. Since the combinations can carry different
meanings depending on the context, the annotators
were allowed to assign multiple senses to the same
word in a given combination (e.g., judge in the
“public official” sense vs. the “evaluator” sense
in the (judgen, decidev) lexical combination).

As a further measure to ensure quality, the an-
notators were also asked to skip the annotation
of lexical combinations (i) carrying mistakes due
to the automatic parsing process, (ii) for which
none of the available senses in WordNet would fit

the context, (iii) reflecting idiomatic expressions,
(iv) which were multi-word Named Entities.

Overall, the annotators covered 78, 000 lex-
ical combinations (10, 218 unique nouns and
3, 786 unique verbs for 52, 432 noun-verb rela-
tions and 25, 568 noun-noun relations), and ob-
tained 88, 019 semantic combinations (61, 249
noun-verb and 26, 770 noun-noun semantic rela-
tions) linking 20, 626 WordNet 3.0 nodes, i.e.,
unique synsets (14, 204 noun synsets and 6, 422
verb synsets), with a relation edge.

We periodically timed the annotators by con-
sidering the number of annotations produced on
a daily basis, obtaining an average value of 42 dis-
ambiguated combinations per hour (1 minute and
26 seconds per word pair). Overall, the annotation
process took a period of 9 months.

To determine the reliability of the annotations,
we calculated the minimum inter-annotator agree-
ment between pairs of annotators on a random
sample of 500 combinations. For each of the
500 lexical combinations used to compute the
inter-annotator agreement, the annotators were ex-
ceptionally asked to disambiguate the two target
words in all of the 25 sentences provided, thus
leading to a figure of 25,000 single instances dis-
ambiguated per annotator, resulting in a substan-
tial agreement (κ = 0.71). Moreover, we found
that most of the disagreement instances arose out
of valid alternative tags, rather than factual errors,
due to the fine granularity of the WordNet sense
inventory.

4 Experimental setup

We now present the setup of our evaluation, car-
ried out to assess the effectiveness of SyntagNet
when employed for knowledge-based WSD.

Disambiguation algorithm We performed our
experiments employing UKB7 (Agirre et al.,
2014), a state-of-the-art system for knowledge-
based WSD, which applies the Personalized Page
Rank (PPR) algorithm (Haveliwala, 2002) to an

input LKB. We used its PPRw2w single-sentence
context disambiguation method, which initializes
the PPR vector using the context of the target word
in a given sentence, while excluding the contribu-
tion of the target word itself.

Evaluation benchmarks and measures We
used five test sets standardized with WordNet 3.0
(Raganato et al., 2017a) including the English all-
words tasks from Senseval-2 (Edmonds and Cot-
ton, 2001), Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004),
SemEval-2007 (Pradhan et al., 2007), SemEval-
2013 (Navigli et al., 2013) and SemEval-2015
(Moro and Navigli, 2015). To run experiments
on multilingual WSD, we used the last two of the
foregoing datasets, which also include German,
Spanish, French and Italian, employing, as sense
inventory, the synset lexicalizations provided in
BabelNet 4.08. As customary, we computed pre-
cision, recall and F1, which in our case coincided,
due to UKB always outputting a sense for each tar-
get word.

LKBs For the purposes of our evaluation we
measured the performance obtained with UKB
when combined with different LKBs. As our
baseline we used WordNet + PWNG, which is
the best configuration of UKB according to its
authors. We also evaluated the following LKBs
when integrated separately on top of our baseline:
(i) the best configurations of KnowNet9 and deep-
KnowNet10, (ii) the subgraph of BabelNet 4.0 in-
duced by WordNet 3.0, (iii) eXtended WordNet11,
(iv) ColWordNet12, (v) SyntagNet (cf. Section 2).

5 Experimental results

English WSD As shown in Table 2 (left), Syn-
tagNet enabled UKB to achieve the best results in
the English all-words disambiguation tasks, attain-
ing 4.4 overall points above the WNG baseline,
which is the only statistically-significant improve-
ment across LKBs. Furthermore, results for the
individual datasets exhibit statistically-significant
improvements over the baseline on two out of
five datasets. We attribute this result to the fully
manual nature of SyntagNet, in contrast to the
noisy character of the other LKBs. A further jus-
tification of our results comes from an analysis
we performed on relation samples from the vari-
ous LKBs: we collected 500 random relations for
each LKB we experimented with, and manually
tagged each of them as syntagmatic or paradig-
matic, revealing that their syntagmatic contribu-
tion ranges from 39% (deepKnowNet) to 54%
(eXtended WordNet). The fully syntagmatic na-
ture of SyntagNet, instead, effectively blends in
with the complementary information available in
the baseline (63% of the relations in WNG are
paradigmatic).

Table 3 compares UKB + SyntagNet against the
best supervised English WSD systems (Yuan et al.,
2016; Melacci et al., 2018; Uslu et al., 2018):
none of the differences across datasets between
the best performing supervised system and Syn-
tagNet is statistically significant according to a χ2

test (p < 0.01), meaning that SyntagNet enables
knowledge-based WSD to rival current supervised
approaches.

Multilingual WSD As regards our multilingual
evaluation, SyntagNet enabled UKB to attain the
best overall result (see Table 2 (right)), which is a
statistically-significant improvement of 2.1 points
over the baseline. With respect to the compari-
son against the best systems (Table 4), SyntagNet
provides a statistically-relevant boost of 4.6 points
in relation to the aggregate score of the compared
systems (second to last row), attaining state-of-
the-art results on five out of the six datasets taken
into account.

5.1 Impact of LKB size

Finally, we graphed the increase in WSD per-
formance obtained when progressively enriching
the baseline UKB graph with random samples of
10, 000 SyntagNet relations at each step. As illus-
trated in Figure 1, the improvements in the English
and multilingual settings, respectively, present a
growing trend according to a linear regression
analysis of the data. This demonstrates that our
relations are high-quality and effective for WSD,
while leaving room for further improvement as
more relations are added in the future.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we put forward two main con-
tributions: 1) we presented SyntagNet (http:
//syntagnet.org), a new wide-coverage,
manually-curated resource of lexical-semantic
combinations; 2) we showed that SyntagNet en-
ables state-of-the-art knowledge-based WSD, ri-
valing the best supervised system on English and
surpassing the overall performance of the best
multilingual systems by 4.6 points. As future
work, we plan to: i) enrich SyntagNet with more
combinations, so as to surpass supervised English
WSD; ii) include information from adjectives; iii)
establish a common evaluation framework to com-
pare the contribution of lexical-semantic combina-
tion resources; iv) employ and assess SyntagNet in
other NLP tasks, such as word and sense similar-
ity (Navigli and Martelli, 2019) or Semantic Role
Labeling (where a newly released WordNet-linked
resource, VerbAtlas (Di Fabio et al., 2019), would
greatly benefit from collocational information).
