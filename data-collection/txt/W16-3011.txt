Abstract

This paper describes our system to ex-
tract binary regulatory relations from text,
used to participate in the SeeDev task of
BioNLP-ST 2016. Our system was based
on machine learning, using support vector
machines with a shallow linguistic kernel
to identify each type of relation. Addition-
ally, we employed a distant supervised ap-
proach to increase the size of the training
data. Our submission obtained the third
best precision of the SeeDev-binary task.
Although the distant supervised approach
did not significantly improve the results,
we expect that by exploring other tech-
niques to use unlabeled data should lead
to better results.

1 Introduction

The SeeDev task of BioNLP-ST 2016 consisted
in extracting relations between biomedical named
entities on a set of texts about Arabidopsis
thaliana(Chaix et al., 2016). These texts were
manually annotated with entities and relations rel-
evant to seed storage and reserve accumulation.
Furthermore, the type of entities that could have
a specific role on each type of relation was speci-
fied by the organization. There were two subtasks:
the first task, binary relation extraction (SeeDev-
binary), considered only relations between two ar-
guments; the second, full event extraction, con-
sidered relations that could be composed by two
to eight arguments. For both tasks, the evaluation
criteria used consisted in comparing the type and
arguments of each predicted relation to the gold
standard. A total of 7 teams participated on this
task. The best F-measure achieved was of 0.432,

which is slightly lower than the best scores ob-
tained for the comparable task on the 2013 edition
of BioNLP-ST (Cancer Genetics task (Pyysalo et
al., 2015): 0.554; Gene Regulation Network task
(Bossy et al., 2015): 0.45; GENIA task (Kim et
al., 2015): 0.489)

Our team has developed a system for the
identification of chemical entities and interac-
tions, based on Conditional Random Fields, ker-
nel methods and domain knowledge. We have also
adapted this system to other types of entities such
as temporal expressions and clinical events. The
SeeDev-binary subtask provided us with an oppor-
tunity to test our system on a new domain, which
contains more types of entities and relations than
the domains we had previously tested on.

We adapted the relation extraction module of
our system to the types of relations considered by
the SeeDev-binary subtask. For each type of rela-
tion, we trained a classifier with the shallow lin-
guistic kernel. We used every sentence containing
at least two entities of the types accepted by that
relation type. Since there was no ontology readily
available for this domain, we were not able to inte-
grate domain knowledge. Alternatively, we exper-
imented a distant supervision approach by using a
large number of documents to find sentences con-
taining pairs that were already present on the train-
ing corpus. Our system is available at https:
//github.com/AndreLamurias/IBEnt

The following sections describe the main meth-
ods used by our system (Section 2), the results
obtained with our submission and post-challenge
improvements (Section 3), and a discussion about
these results (Section 4).

2 Methods

This section describes the methods used by our
system. The pre-processing and relation extrac-

88



tion steps were already part of our system, imple-
mented for other biomedical domains. For this
task, we tested a basic distant supervision ap-
proach.

2.1 Pre-processing
The first step of our system consisted in pre-
processing the input text using the Genia Sen-
tence Splitter (Sætre et al., 2007) and the Stan-
ford CoreNLP pipeline (Toutanova and Manning,
2000). The latter tokenizes the text into word
tokens and extracts the corresponding lemmas
and part-of-speech, and named entity tags (proper
noun, numerical and temporal entities). We im-
plemented additional tokenization rules to sepa-
rate words linked by dashes, dots and slashes be-
cause biomedical entities may be part of expres-
sions containing these characters.

2.2 Relation extraction
Each of the 22 types of relations has two ar-
guments, and each argument is restricted to a
set of entity types specific to each relation type.
These restrictions were established by the task
organizers. The sentences that satisfied the en-
tity type requirements were considered to train
and test a classifier of that relation type. The to-
kens that comprise the relation arguments were
replaced by a generic string in order to re-
duce the variability of the text. Furthermore,
for the types “Has Sequence Identical To” and
“Is Functionally Equivalent To”, we considered
only pairs with the same entity type.

The machine learning algorithm used to train
the classifiers was a variation of Support Vector
Machines, with the shallow linguistic kernel, as
implemented by jSRE (Giuliano et al., 2006). Ker-
nel methods rely on a kernel function which com-
putes the inner product between every instance
instead of a specific feature map. This kernel
function in particular considers an instance as the
sequence of tokens, lemmas, part-of-speech and
named entities. The tokens that refer to each ar-
gument are identified, while the label of each in-
stance was 0 if the pair was not a relation, or 1 if
it was a relation. Each pair of entities that satis-
fied the argument type restrictions was considered
a candidate pair. This kernel has been applied to
biomedical text, for the extraction of relations be-
tween proteins (Tikk et al., 2010) and chemical
compounds (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011), obtain-
ing positive results. The shallow linguistic kernel

is a composite sequence kernel which uses both a
local and global context window, which we set at
3 and 4, respectively. These are the only variable
parameters of this kernel.

2.3 Distant supervision

The objective of this experiment was to find rela-
tions on PubMed abstracts which could increase
the size of the training data, and therefore, im-
prove the performance of the system. First, we
retrieved the 10,000 most recent abstracts with
the MeSH term “arabidopsis” from PubMed. Us-
ing the entity annotations from the gold standard,
we trained Condition Random Fields (Lafferty et
al., 2001) classifiers to recognize each type of en-
tity on the abstracts. We have previously applied
this approach to chemical entities, obtaining a F-
measure of 0.847 (Lamurias et al., 2015b). We
generated lists of the keywords most used in sen-
tences where a relation is described, for each type
of relations. To prevent common words from ap-
pearing on those lists, we also generated a list of
the most used words on the corpus, and removed
those words from each list. Our assumption was
that if at least two keywords in the list were men-
tioned in the sentence, then the relation would be
true. Since this approach produced mostly nega-
tive instances, we excluded some of those to main-
tain the same positive/negative ratio as the train-
ing data. This approach was based on the work of
Thomas et al. (2011), where they used various fil-
ters to reduce the number of false positives. In this
case, we used only instances of the 10 relations
types that were least represented in the gold stan-
dard. Table 2.3 provides a comparison between
the data set obtained with this technique (DS set)
and the training set.

3 Results

To classify the test set, we trained with the docu-
ments of the gold standard. We present the results
of our official submission, as well as the results ob-
tained with the addition of distant supervised sen-
tences (Table 3). More detailed results, as well as
the results obtained by the other teams, are avail-
able at the task website 1. After submitting the
results, we found that, by mistake, we had trained
the classifiers only with the training set. There-
fore, we also present the results obtained with the

Table 3 also contains a baseline that we used
during development of the system, to compare the
performance of our system to a simple approach.
In this case, the simple approach consisted in clas-
sifying every pair that satisfied the entity type re-
quirements as a true relation. As expected, this
baseline obtained high recall and low precision
and F-measure. The reason why the recall is not
1 is because we only considered pairs of entities
from the same sentence. This way, the recall of the
baseline (0.895) is the maximum recall we could
have obtained with our approach. We observed
that with our system, the results obtained were bet-
ter both in terms of precision and F-measure.

The main difference between training with just
the training set and using both training and devel-
opment was in the recall obtained. By increasing
the number of training instances, the classifier was
able to correctly identify more relations. Although

it also decreased the precision, the difference in
terms of F-measure was positive.

Using the distant supervision approach, we
were able to use 6947 sentences as an additional
data set (DS set). This approach improved the F-
measure by 0.055, due to an increase in recall and
precision.

4 Discussion

This task was a challenge for our system since
it required the identification of 22 types of rela-
tions, while previously the system was tested only
on one specific type of relation While we could
optimize the system for one type of relation with
domain knowledge, in this case we had to use a
generic approach to various types.

Comparing with the other participants, our F-
measure was the 5th best of the 7 participating
teams, 0.126 points below the best. In terms of
precision, our team was the 3rd best, 0.154 below
the best. Our submitted results had higher preci-
sion because we used only the gold standard anno-
tations to train the classifiers. This way, the output
of the classifiers tended to be closer to the training
corpora.

4.1 Error Analysis

In order to fairly compare our results with the
other teams, we discuss only the errors of our of-
ficial submission. There was a wide range of F-
measure values within the different types of re-
lations. The types “Has Sequence Identical To”
and “Is Functionally Equivalent To” had a F-
measure of 0.708 and 0.646, respectively. These

90



types obtain much higher scores possibly be-
cause the entity types of the two arguments had
to be the same, reducing the number of candi-
date pairs. The most difficult relations were the
ones less represented in the training data, such as
“Is Involved In Process” and “Is Linked To”. In
the case of the first type, no team was able to iden-
tify one of the 12 relation instances present in the
test corpus, while with the second type, only one
team was able to identify some relations. These re-
sults show that the performance of the techniques
used for this task are dependent on the annotations
of the training data.

Regarding the contribution of the distant super-
vision approach, we observed that the system pre-
dicted fewer relations of the less frequent relation
types. Since we labeled each pair of entities auto-
matically, it is possible that some relations were
mislabeled. However, since we maintained the
same positive/negative ratio as the training set (Ta-
ble 2.3), this approach provided mostly negative
instances.

4.2 Future Work

We intend to explore other techniques to use un-
labeled data for distant supervision. A technique
that has improved results on other domains con-
sists of using a knowledge base to restrict which
entities could constitute a relation (Bunescu and
Mooney, 2007). By combining the knowledge
base with the keyword based filter, we should ob-
tain a set of instances with a high probability of be-
ing correctly labeled. These instances should then
improve the quality of the classifiers by providing
other ways to express a relation, and reduce the
number of incorrect annotations.

Another technique to explore consists in ap-
plying semantic similarity measures (Couto and
Pinto, 2013) to check if two entities are seman-
tically related and therefore could constitute a re-
lation (Lamurias et al., 2015a). Additionally, we
intend to apply our distant supervision approach
to improve the results of our biomedical ques-
tion&answering system (WS4A) that participated
in the BioASQ 2016 challenge(Rodrigues et al.,
2016).
