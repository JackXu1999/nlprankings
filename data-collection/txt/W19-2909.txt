Abstract

Backward saccades during reading have been
hypothesized to be involved in structural re-
analysis, or to be related to the level of text
difficulty. We test the hypothesis that back-
ward saccades are involved in online syntac-
tic analysis. If this is the case we expect that
saccades will coincide, at least partially, with
the edges of the relations computed by a de-
pendency parser. In order to test this, we an-
alyzed a large eye-tracking dataset collected
while 102 participants read three short narra-
tive texts. Our results show a relation between
backward saccades and the syntactic structure
of sentences.

1 Introduction

Written language consists of a sequence of graphic
signs. While most eye movements during reading
indeed follow this sequential order, they are also
occasionally interleaved with jumps back to words
in preceding portions of the text. We refer to these
backward saccades as regressions throughout this
paper. There are at least two competing hypothe-
ses concerning the nature and function of this phe-
nomenon.

The first main line of hypotheses on the role of
regressions emphasizes their active role in com-
puting linguistic representations (Kennedy, 1992),
the second stresses their function as a reanalysis
tool in the event of detected parsing errors (Rayner
and Sereno, 1994). In this paper we start from
the former; in particular, we aim to investigate the
relation between regressions and the structure of
sentences as computed by a dependency parser.

We take dependency structures as a valid approx-
imation of syntactic properties of the sentences,
and we investigate whether these are reflected in
eye movement regressions during naturalistic text
reading.

We consider regressions from each word in the
text, and relate those to dependency relations that
link pairs of words in the sentence. In this way we
can represent syntactic properties of the sentences
as shallow structural information at the word level,
by focusing on the number and direction of the
syntactic relations that each word in a sentence is
engaged in.

The aim of this paper is two-fold: on the one
hand we want to investigate whether regressions
might play a role in online sentence parsing; on
the other hand – as an implication of the previous
goal – we are interested in finding traces of syntac-
tic parsing during reading. We report the results of
a mixed-effect regression analysis showing a rela-
tion between the pattern of eye regressions and the
syntactic structure of sentences.

2 Theoretical Background

2.1 The Role of Regressions in Text
Comprehension

Regressions (backward saccades) are relatively
rare, occurring usually only with 15 to 25% of the
words (Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989). They do not
seem to be random, however. Regressions typi-
cally aim at specific word locations, moving fixa-
tion from the current word back to one of the pre-
viously encountered words (Vitu, 2005). Nonethe-



78

less their function in language comprehension is
still debated. Here we will review two proposed
explanations: the first links regressions to the dif-
ficulty of text processing; the second instead sees
them as tools for language processing, not neces-
sarily linked to processing difficulties or errors.
According to the first proposal regressions only
start to play a role in reading once difficulties
are encountered; according to the second proposal
they are part and parcel of regular reading.

2.1.1 Regression as a Response to
Comprehension Difficulty

The first hypothesis interprets regressions as part
of the reanalysis of textual input due to encoun-
tered comprehension problems. In a milestone
study, Altmann et al. (1992) introduced the no-
tion of regression-contingent analysis, based on
the assumption that regressive eye movements are
a necessary consequence of subjects being garden-
pathed. A garden-path effect occurs when read-
ers incrementally construct an incorrect interpre-
tation of a sentence as a consequence of its lo-
cally ambiguous syntactic structure. This does not
necessarily mean that the presence of a difficult
structure, leading for instance to the reader be-
ing garden-pathed, triggers a regression. Rayner
and colleagues reported data showing that strong
garden path effects can occur sometimes without
triggering any regressions (Rayner and Sereno,
1994; Castelhano and Rayner, 2008). Nonethe-
less, other studies have given support to the idea
that regressions are linked to textual ambiguity
and contextual difficulties. Readers make more re-
gressions when the text is complex (Rayner and
Pollatsek, 1995), when the topic changes (Hyn,
1995), when the text contains grammatical errors
or ambiguities (Reichle et al., 2013), or when they
encounter information that disambiguates the pre-
ceding text (Blanchard and IranNejad, 1987; Fra-
zier and Rayner, 1982). The general hypothesis
holds that the probability of regressions and their
span might depend on the difficulty of the text.
Therefore these regressions might allow the reader
to reread information that has been missed, forgot-
ten, or wrongly interpreted (Rayner, 1998).

2.1.2 Regression as a Tool for
Comprehension

The alternative explanation focuses instead on the
role of eye movements as a tool in language pro-
cessing, used independently from the structural

difficulty of the input. The idea is that regres-
sions help the reader reactivate cognitive informa-
tion that is associated with the regressed-to loca-
tion. Kennedy (1992) refers to this as the Spatial
Code Hypothesis. The hypothesis is that readers
use the position of words on the page as a support
to their working memory by reactivating previ-
ously read words associated with information rel-
evant for the processing of the word from which
the regression originated (O’Regan, 1992; Spivey
et al., 2004). This hypothesis has been criticized
by Booth and Weger (2013). They presented three
experiments showing that reader comprehension
is not hindered when reading conditions inhibit or
discourage visual access to already read material.
In their Experiment 1, readers knew that candidate
targets for regression were no longer available for
rereading. Experiment 2 discouraged regressions
by forcing readers to follow a visual placeholder
on the stimulus while it was also presented in au-
ditory form. Finally, in Experiment 3, candidate
targets for regression were manipulated after read-
ing. In all these three experiments, readers showed
no hindered comprehension of the presented stim-
ulus sentences. As an entailment of these results,
Booth and Weger suggested that readers do not
use regressions to cue their memory for previously
read words.

Our hypothesis is that readers might make use
of regressions to reactivate previously read infor-
mation in the context of naturalistic language com-
prehension, in order to help compute linguistic in-
formation.

We want to examine whether there is an align-
ment between patterns of regressions and word-to-
word syntactic relations as described by the depen-
dency structure of the stimulus. We hypothesize
that regressions play a role in syntactic parsing
that may go beyond the reanalysis of ambiguous
material. We do not deny their role in reanalysis
and repair, but we rather stand with the hypothesis
that they allow re-reading and cueing of previous
words, as an aid to memory, when this is required
for a successful construction of a syntactic repre-
sentation of the text.

In order to test this hypothesis we rely on an
eye-tracker dataset that was collected during nor-
mal text reading of unmodified literary narratives.
We assess whether there is a relation between the
number of eye regressions from the words and the
number of syntactic relations that those words en-



79

tertain with their preceding text. These syntactic
relations are derived from the dependency struc-
tures (described in Section 4) of the sentences
composing the stimuli of the eye-tracker dataset.

2.2 Regressions and Sequence Processing

The hypothesized relation between dependency
structure and eye movement taps into a broader de-
bate on whether language processing relies mainly
on the sequential structure of the input or whether
it involves the computation of non-sequential syn-
tactic parses (Jackendoff and Wittenberg, 2014).
Undeniably, the linguistic stimulus is presented as
a string of symbols, nonetheless regressions seem
to counter the notion that it is processed strictly
in a sequential order. If these eye movements are
involved only in re-analysis, then their existence
does not necessarily contradict sequential process-
ing accounts. They can be explained as an ”emer-
gency recovery” operation that takes place only in
cases of processing difficulties. On the other hand,
if we find evidence of a relation between sac-
cades and syntactic dependency structures inde-
pendent from processing difficulty, then we might
conclude that saccades offer behavioral evidence
that processing involves the computation of non-
sequential structures.

This question is related to the line of research
in psycholinguistics and neuroscience investigat-
ing the computation of syntactic structures in
the mind/brain during language processing. In
this context, sequential structures are usually con-
trasted with hierarchical ones, where input items
are grouped into larger units, which in turn are
(possibly recursively) grouped in even larger units.
These larger units are commonly referred to as
syntactic constituents or phrases and have a cen-
tral position in theoretical linguistics (Chomsky,
1965; Jackendoff, 2002, 2007). An increasing
amount of evidence against a strictly hierarchi-
cal processing of language has emerged over the
past decades. Psycholinguistic studies have sup-
plied evidence suggesting that the mere sequential
properties of the stimulus are sufficient to explain
aspects of human behavior during reading and lis-
tening. Frank et al. (2012) provide a review of
evidence from cognitive neuroscience, psycholin-
guistics and computational modeling studies sup-
porting the hypothesis that hierarchical structure
may not play a central role in language process-
ing and acquisition, and that sequential structure

instead has a significant explanatory power. They
argue that hierarchical structure is rarely needed
to explain behavioral and neural correlates of lan-
guage processing in vivo. In contrast with these
findings, recent neuroimaging studies have delin-
eated a slightly more complex landscape in which
both hierarchical and sequential processing may
be carried out simultaneously by the human brain
during language processing (Brennan et al., 2016;
Nelson et al., 2017).

Dependency parses are different from con-
stituency parses as they lack the non-terminal
nodes characteristic of constituency parses.
Nonetheless they still constitute a non-sequential
type of structure. Demonstrating a relation
between eye movement and such structure will
provide evidence for the non-sequentiality of
language processing, at least in the context of text
reading.

3 Related Work

The present work studies the relation between eye
movements during reading and the dependency
structure as produced by a dependency parser (see
Section 5.2 for more details). Several other studies
tested language processing hypotheses by using
computational models as predictors of eye move-
ments during sentence reading.

Boston et al. (2008) demonstrates the impor-
tance of including parsing costs implemented as
surprisal as a predictor of comprehension diffi-
culty in models of reading. They showed that sur-
prisal of grammatical structures has an effect on
fixation durations and regression probabilities.

Demberg and Keller (2008) compared linguis-
tic integration cost computed as a function of de-
pendency relations distances and word surprisal as
predictors of gaze duration. They showed that dis-
tance is not a significant predictor of reading times
except for nouns. On the other hand, they demon-
strate that surprisal can predict reading times for
arbitrary words in the corpus, concluding that the
two predictors may capture distinct aspects of nat-
uralistic language processing.

In the context of Natural Language Processing,
Klerke et al. (2015) used eye-tracker data as a met-
ric for the quality of automatic text simplification
and compression, which are operations used in
machine translation and automatic summarization.
Their proposal is grounded in the hypothesis that
eye movements are related to perceived text diffi-

4 Dependency Structure

We chose dependency grammar as the formalism
of non-sequential syntactic structure. Dependency
grammar describes a sentence as a set of rela-
tions between words (heads) and their dependents.
These relations are called dependencies and cor-
respond to grammatical functions and – together
with the words they link – are the only descriptive
elements composing the structure, which has the
form and properties of a directed graph (Tesnière
et al., 2015; Mel’čuk, 1988; Nivre and Kübler,
2009).

(1) Peter bought a very expensive luxury car.

Take for instance Sentence 1 above. Figure 1
contains the dependency graph representing the
dependency structure of the sentence in terms of
typified head-dependent relations. The main verb
(bought) acts as head for Peter and car, with which
it is in subject and object relations, respectively.
A dependent of one dependency relation can in
turn be the head of another one. For instance car
is head of luxury and of expensive with which it is
linked by modifier relations, and also head of the
article a via a determiner relation.

This structure lacks phrasal non-terminal con-
stituents. In addition, it is not strictly sequential,
or put differently, it is not isomorphic to the se-
quence of items that makes up the stimulus. This
is based on the fact that the dependency relations
can hold between words that are non-consecutive
or possibly even far apart in the sentence. There is
the assumption that during reading, these links are
created once a suitable candidate for the second
term of the dependency is introduced. Therefore,
online dependency parsing proceeds by introduc-
ing one word at a time, and by looking back at the
prefix in order to assess whether this novel input is
a suitable candidate for a dependency link with a
preceding word that has not yet been matched.

5 Materials and Methods

5.1 Eye-tracker data

The eye tracker data used in this study was orig-
inally collected for a study on mental stimula-
tion during literary reading by Mak and Willems
(2018) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, the
Netherlands. For more details on data acquisition
and preprocessing we refer to the original publica-
tion.

5.1.1 Participants and Stimuli

Data was collected from 102 participants (82 fe-
males, mean age 23.27, range 18–40), all of whom
were native speakers of Dutch, with normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. All participants gave
written informed consent in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Stimuli consisted of three published short sto-
ries in Dutch. Stories 1 and 2 were written by con-
temporary Dutch writers, and Story 3 was trans-
lated from American English to Dutch. Their
lengths were 2143, 2659, and 2988 words respec-
tively, and they required around 10-15 minutes
each to be read.

5.1.2 Data Acquisition and Pre-processing

For eye-movement data collection, a monocu-
lar desktop-mounted EyeLink1000+ eye-tracking
system was used (500 Hz sampling rate). Head
movements were minimized using a head stabi-
lizer, ensuring that all participants were seated at
108 cm from the screen.

The stimuli were presented using SR Research
Experiment Builder software (SR Research, Ot-
tawa, Canada). The stories were divided into 30
sections each. The stories were presented in coun-
terbalanced order. After data collection, partici-
pants were presented with a comprehension ques-
tionnaire.

All fixations were checked to make sure that
they did not drift off and enter a different inter-
est area. If correction of the drifts was not possi-
ble, individual sections were excluded. Data for at
least one section was removed for 40 participants.
For four participants, the number of excluded sec-
tions exceeded six, resulting in the exclusion of
one story for these participants.

Eight participants answered more than one
comprehension question incorrectly for one of the
three stories (four times for Story 2 and four times



81

for Story 3), resulting in the exclusion of the data
for one story reading for eight participants.

The dataset contains a total of 582,807 words
across all participants and narratives.

5.1.3 Eye Tracker Measures
For the present study we focus on the number of
eye regressions. A regression consists of a fast eye
movement from a word back to a previous word.

5.2 Dependency Parsing

The text of the three stories presented to the partic-
ipants were fed to the ALPINO toolbox for Dutch
natural language processing (Noord, 2006) to gen-
erate a dependency parse for each of their sen-
tences. The parser creates a structure composed
of dependency triples consisting of a head word,
the type of dependency relation and its dependent
word. A parse is produced for each sentence in-
dependently, therefore no relation can be assigned
between words belonging to different sentences.
The output of the parser was manually checked
in order to prevent tokenization and sentence seg-
mentation errors.

5.2.1 Number of Dependency Relations
As described in Section 4, every word in a sen-
tence entertains at least one relation with another
word in the same sentence. Every non-final and
non-initial word can have relations with a variable
number of other words on its right and its left. Be-
cause we are interested in eye regressions, we de-
cided to focus our attention only on relations be-
tween a word w and its preceding context. There-
fore only relations with a head and possible depen-
dents on the words preceding w are counted.

From the dependency structure of a sentence,
we derived the following count measures:

• N head indicates the presence of a syntactic
relation between wi and a word in w1:i−1 that
is head of wi;

• N dependents counts the number of syntactic
relations betweenwi and words inw1:i−1 that
are dependents of wi.

Measure N head is a binary variable indicat-
ing whether word w has a head in its left context
w1:t−1. This is because every word has one, and
only one, head.

For example, the word expensive in Sentence 1
has one head relation with a word on its right

Peter bought a very expensive luxury car
N head 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
N dependents 0 1 0 0 1 0 3

Table 1: Number of dependency relations per word w
that correspond to words in w’s own preceding context.

(car), no dependents on its right, and one on its
left (very). On the other hand, the word car, be-
ing sentence-final, does not have any links on its
right, but it has 1 head (bought) and 3 dependents
(a, expensive, luxury) on its left. Table 1 contains
the count measures (N head and N dependents)
for Sentence 1.

5.3 Descriptors not Related to Dependencies

We are interested in the effect of syntactic struc-
ture, implemented as dependency relations, on the
pattern of regressions. For this reason it is nec-
essary to control for other possible quantifiable
factors affecting these eye movements. We chose
to use log-transformed lexical frequency and sur-
prisal.

Base-2 log-transformed lexical frequency per
word was computed using the Subtlex NL corpus
(Keuleers et al., 2010). Surprisal was computed
from a second-order Markov model, also known as
trigram model, trained on a random selection of 10
million sentences (comprising 197 million word
tokens; 2.1 million types) from the Dutch section
of Corpora from the Web (NLCOW2012; Schäfer
and Bildhauer, 2012). Surprisal of word wt is
the negative logarithm of the conditional prob-
ability of encountering wt after having read se-
quence wt−2, wt−1, or: − logP (wt|wt−2, wt−1).
The computation was performed by the SRILM
toolbox (Stolcke, 2002).

Frequency and surprisal are computed in order
to control for processing difficulties. Intuitively,
infrequent words and words with high surprisal
are more difficult to retrieve (and possibly to in-
tegrate) with their preceding context. Controlling
for processing difficulty is motivated by the alter-
native hypothesis regarding the role of regressions
as depending on the level of complexity posed by
a linguistic input.

In addition to frequency and surprisal, we also
use word position in the sentence. Intuitively, the
probability of regressing from a word to its previ-
ous context increases linearly with the position of
the word in a sequence. By controlling for it, we
ensure that the eye movements are not due simply



82

to the opportunity given by the larger target pool
to regress to.

5.4 Analyses
We fitted two logistic mixed-effect models predict-
ing eye regressions. The first model (null, Eq. (1)
below) contains as predictors only the position
of the words in their sentences (word order), and
probabilistic information consisting of the above-
mentioned log-transformed frequency (freq) and
surprisal (surp). The second model (full, Eq. (2)
below) contains as predictors of interest also the
number of left-hand side dependency relations
(i.e. N head and N dependents) of each word. In
addition, we included by-participant and by-word
random intercepts, as well as by-participant ran-
dom slopes for word order in the null model and
for word order, N head and N dependents in the
full models.

We expect the model’s fit to improve signif-
icantly after inclusion of the measures derived
from the dependency parse as regressors. The in-
crease in model fit is quantified by the χ2-statistic
of a likelihood-ratio test for significance between
the null and full models and is taken as the
measure of the fit of N head and N dependents
measures at each word to the probability of a
regression being generated at each word.

The models are fit by maximum likelihood
(Laplace Approximation) and with a binomial dis-
tribution.

6 Results

6.1 Regression Model Analysis
In the results below we first describe the fit of
each of the two models (null and full) separately,
then we report the results of the model comparison
analysis using the χ2-statistic.

Table 2 presents the fitted null model. Table 3
shows the fitted full model. The head and de-
pendent regressors have significant effects on the
number of regressions (eye regressions) - N head:
β = 0.242, p < .0001; N dependents: β =
0.046, p < .0005.

In addition, both word frequency (freq) and sur-
prisal (surp) have a significant negative effect. The
negative effect of frequency might be due to less
frequent words being more difficult to retrieve
from memory, therefore triggering a regression to
gather more contextual information to help word
processing. The negative effect of surprisal indi-
cates that the larger the surprisal of a word – there-
fore more difficult its integration into the context
– the less probable the reader is to regress to the
word’s previous context. Mak and Willems (2018)
reported a positive effect of surprisal on the num-
ber of incoming saccades, that is, eye movements
into a word back from subsequent parts of the text.

Table 3: Fixed effects for the full model

In order to test whether the introduction of head
and dependent measures improves the fit of the lo-
gistic mixed effect model to outgoing saccades, we
computed the χ2-statistic of a likelihood-ratio test
for the difference between the null and full mod-
els above. The χ2 is taken as the measure of the
fit of the dependency measures to the probability
of a regression being initiated at each word. Table
4 reports the results of the test, showing the dif-
ference in model fit to be significant (χ2 = 738.87,
p < .0001).

the presence of left-hand side dependency rela-
tions. In order to corroborate these observations,
we counted the number of times regressions
generated from each word do actually land on
preceding words that are heads or dependents of
that word. As reported in Table 5, it turns out that
of the 110,336 regressions, about 40% do actually
land on a head or dependent of the words they
originate from. These are referred to as matches.
The analyses were limited only to regressions
landing within sentence boundaries. In the table,
“misses” refers to the regressions that land on
targets that are neither head nor dependent of the
the word they originated from.

tot nr of matches: 46378
tot nr of misses: 63958

Table 5: Total numbers of regressions, matches (i.e. re-
gressions that land on heads or dependents), and misses
(i.e. regressions do not land on heads or dependents of
the word they originated from).

A χ2-test of independence was performed to as-
sess the relation between having a dependency re-
lation with a word and generating a regression to
that word. The test was computed independently
for 10 separate left-hand side distances d = [−10 :
−1]. In other words, for d = −1, we want to as-
sess whether there is a relation between having a
dependency relation with the preceding word and
looking back at that word; for d = −2, we want to
assess whether there is a relation between having
a dependency relation with the preceding word at
position −2 and looking back at that word, and so
on for the other considered distances.

Table 6 contains the per-distance results of the
χ2 analyses. An association between presence of
a dependency relation at position d and the gener-
ation of a regression to that position is significant
for distances −1 (χ2 = 132.52, p < 0.001), −2
(χ2 = 678.14, p < 0.001), −3 (χ2 = 8.05, p <
0.005), and −4 (χ2 = 13.68, p < 0.001). For all
other tested distances (between −5 and −10) the
association was not significant (see Figure 2). For

d = {−1,−2,−3,−4}:

• The fraction of words wi in a dependency re-
lation with wi−d that originate a regression
of length −d is significantly higher than the
fraction of wi not in a dependency relation
with wi−d originating a regression of length
−d;

• The fraction of words wi with a regression
of length −d that are in a dependency rela-
tion with wi−d is significantly higher than the
fraction of wi without a regression of length
−d that are in a dependency relation with
wi−d.

Figure 2: The effect of dependency relations on re-
gressions from wi is significant only for the preceding
four words - further away saccades might not be influ-
enced by a possible relation with wi (∗∗ = p < 0.001,
∗ = p < 0.01).

This seems to indicate that the effect of the de-
pendency structure of a sentence on the pattern of
outgoing eye-movements from a word is present
only for short-distance relations (between a word
and its four preceding words).

It is important to keep in mind however that
the number of dependency relations found by the



84

parser is much higher than the actual number of
matches. This is simply because the parser does
assign at least a head to each and every word in
the text (even words in isolation are assigned a
root head), whereas a regression is a relatively rare
event (under normal conditions, using naturalistic
language). The present work aims at demonstrat-
ing that regressions are related (also) to the struc-
ture of the dependency graph. The results we have
produced so far point in that direction. In other
words, it is possible to affirm that if a regression
takes place, it might be triggered by the presence
of a dependency relation between the word it is
generated from and the word it lands on.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented an analysis inves-
tigating whether eye movements of readers may
be influenced directly by the syntactic structure of
the sentence. We tested this using shallow non-
hierarchical structures computed by a dependency
parser. The hypothesis was that the path of re-
gressions from a word to an earlier word coin-
cide, at least partially, with the edges of depen-
dency relations between these words. We used a
substantially large eye-tracking dataset collected
while 102 participants were engaged in reading
three short narrative texts.

The results of a mixed-effect regression analy-
sis indicate that there is a significant effect of the
number of left-hand side dependency relations on
the number of backward saccades. This effect is
well above chance even after correcting for word
position in the sentence and word frequency and
surprisal – measures held to explain a large part of
natural language processing behavioral and neural
correlates. These results are corroborated by the
observation that about 40% of backward saccades
do indeed land on target words engaged in depen-
dency relations according to the syntactic structure
of the sentences composing our stimuli.

The length of the regressions seems to be rela-
tively short: the vast majority being shorter than
three words, with a predominance of regressions
one position backwards. The results of a series
of χ2 tests for independence shows that there
is a significant association between presence
of a dependency link and backward saccading
between two words holds only for pairs which are
not further apart than four positions. This might
indicate that the eye regressions are involved

predominantly in dependency parsing at the local
level, rather than at long distance.

Altogether these results converge on the idea
that eye movements reflect, among other things,
the shallow syntactic structure of language. More-
over these results seems also to corroborate the
idea that humans do engage in online syntactic
analysis of the input – at least in the form of lo-
cal dependency parsing.
