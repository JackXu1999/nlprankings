Abstract

The Computational Linguistics and Clini-
cal Psychology (CLPsych) 2018 Shared Task
asked teams to predict cross-sectional indices
of anxiety and distress, and longitudinal in-
dices of psychological distress from a subsam-
ple of the National Child Development Study
(Brown and Goodman, 2014), started in the
United Kingdom in 1958. Teams aimed to pre-
dict mental health outcomes from essays writ-
ten by 11-year-olds about what they believed
their lives would be like at age 25. In the
hopes of producing results that could be eas-
ily disseminated and applied, we used largely
theory-based dictionaries to process the texts,
and a simple data-driven approach to model
selection. This approach yielded only modest
results in terms of out-of-sample accuracy, but
most of the category-level findings are inter-
pretable and consistent with existing literature
on psychological distress, anxiety, and depres-
sion.

The CLPsych Shared Task1 this year asked a
question with relevance to the nature of continu-
ity and change in mental health: Can we predict
concurrent and future mental health from child-
hood writing samples? Aggregate results from this
task may have the potential for near-future applied
value, especially for clinicians working with chil-
dren. If we find usable signals in the linguistic
data that have not been uncovered by the exten-
sive prior research on the NCDS (Davie et al.,
1972; Elliott, 2010; Richardson et al., 1976), the
writing task that served as the basis of our analy-
ses (asking 11-year-old children to imagine what

their lives would be like at age 25) could be eas-
ily adapted into individual-level clinical practice
or group-level school counseling programs.

Interpretability. Our team’s overarching goal
in this analysis was to produce interpretable re-
sults. To this end, we used dictionaries and la-
tent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003)
to make sense of the texts, and focused on reduc-
ing these features further in our modeling to arrive
at a tractable number of variables. Before describ-
ing our methods, we briefly outline our thought
processes as we worked through the Shared Task’s
prediction problems, and foreshadow results that
we believe may be of particular interest to psy-
chologists and clinicians.

Perhaps because of our backgrounds in psychol-
ogy, our bias is typically to rely on dictionary-
based processing (such as done by Linguistic In-
quiry and Word Count; LIWC; Pennebaker et al.,
2015) as a first step. However, we felt that tak-
ing a relatively simple, dictionary-based approach
to the task was a particularly good fit with the
applied focus of this year’s CLPsych Workshop:
“From Keyboard to Clinic, Talk to Walk” (Loveys
et al., 2018). Clinicians and practitioners with lim-
ited computational linguistic experience may be
more willing to adopt methods—or, at the mini-
mum, consider results—that are more transparent
and face valid.

Although our ultimate model selection was
data-driven, many of LIWC’s dictionaries are
theory-driven, and tend to be face valid as a re-
sult. That is, they were designed by psychologists
to measure psychological constructs, such as fu-
ture focus or tentativeness, and the words in those
dictionaries tend to directly reflect the constructs
they aim to measure. In contrast, data-driven ap-
proaches to dictionary development may include
some words that statistically predict a particular
state of mind (e.g., temporal focus) but are not in-

tuitively related to how psychologists typically op-
erationalize that mental state (Garten et al., 2018;
Schwartz et al., 2013). Likewise, approaches that
regress some outcome on every possible combina-
tion of two or more characters (e.g., moving win-
dows) or every word (e.g., the baseline unigram
models) run the risk of not providing clinicians
with actionable insights, or generalizing well to
other samples.

Another way to think about interpretability is as
a source of insensitivity to data, or stability. Fol-
lowing something like a mental models perspec-
tive (and specifically Yufik and Friston, 2016), we
might think of individuals’ engagement with the
world as a modeling process. Understanding in
this view can then be seen as a mechanism of con-
servation; when we feel we understand something,

we can stop collecting data, or process data less
deeply (maybe only enough to check for disagree-
ment with our understanding). The stable mod-
els associated with a sense of understanding also
allow us to go about predicting future states—
something that would not be possible if our mod-
els were too much in flux, if only because they
would not offer any stable prediction.

A more traditional (and perhaps fallibilist) per-
spective on understanding might relate it to some-
thing like causal explanations, where understand-
ability is taken to be associated with truth. For
example, a theory-based approach might be seen
as focused on the discovery of truths (understand-
ing), where a more exploratory approach might
be focused on fleeting but temporarily useful re-
sults (prediction). The thinking here may be
that there are stable, causal underpinnings to the
world, but there is considerable noise hiding those
underpinnings, so we need to develop theories,
and test those theories in a triangular fashion, to
cut through the noise and arrive at those causes.
An equivalent perspective that does not appeal to
stable, discoverable causes is to see the whole
understanding-seeking process as statistical mod-
eling, where theories (and even the concept of
truth) are biasing factors that work to stabilize con-
ceptualizations of the world, allowing for predic-
tion (and, therefore, long term action) within it.

Dictionary-based approaches can be thought of
in much the same way, at least in terms of their
understandability and biasing influence on model-
ing. Dictionaries work toward understandability
by simplifying the representation of the data (re-
ducing its dimensions). In this reduction process,
dictionaries also smooth the raw text data insensi-
tively by effectively unit-weighting words (at least
as we generally apply them). Theory-based dic-
tionaries are additionally biased as they draw on
other assimilative, simplifying efforts.

Predictions. Although our approach was
very exploratory, with no specific predictions (or,
rather, a large number of ad hoc, speculative pre-
dictions based on our reading of the essays and our
background knowledge of relevant research), there
were some categories that we paid particular atten-
tion to. Some of these predictors were paralinguis-
tic rather than standard word lists. For example,
we were especially interested in the total percent-
age of words captured by our dictionary before and
after automated text cleaning for misspellings—

48



which, in texts written by 11-year-olds, were pre-
dictably quite common. Those predictors were
considered not based on existing theories that we
are aware of, but on our reading of the training
essays, which varied widely in spelling and coher-
ence. Although we did not find any evidence that
cognitive complexity (variously measured using
LIWC’s cognitive mechanism and analytic cate-
gories) related to outcomes, the two variables rep-
resenting misspellings (dictionary percentage cap-
tured before and after text processing) were robust
predictors of present and future mental distress.

The essays also varied widely in adherence to
the writing instructions, which were to write about
life at age 25 as though you were currently that
age. That variance led us to predict that focusing
on the future—that is, not following the implicit
instructions to use the present tense—would be
positively rather than negatively related to distress.
As the results show, that prediction was somewhat
supported in the cross-sectional data.

Finally, based on previous findings on early life
writing predicting distant future outcomes (e.g.,
positivity in novice nuns’ autobiographies predict-
ing longer lives; Danner et al., 2001), we expected
LIWC’s emotion categories (posemo, negemo,
anx, anger, and sad) to predict outcomes either
alone or in combination with sex or personal pro-
nouns as moderators. Those predictions were not
supported, perhaps partly due to low base-rates of
emotional language in the essays.

1 Text Processing

The full training set included 9,217 essays writ-
ten at age 11. The first step in processing the texts
was to account for regular aspects that would make
word boundaries less clear. For example, asterisks
marked uncertain transcriptions, and line breaks
were marked by characters. Illegible words were
also filled in with variable numbers of asterisks or
xs, which we standardized so they would all be
treated as the same (as an “illegible” category).
After this initial, more text specific cleaning, we
translated the texts into a unigram document-term
matrix. This involved more generic processes that
aimed to identify word boundaries (such as at-

tempting to account for unusual punctuation or
formatting; using an R package currently in de-
velopment2).

This preprocessing resulted in a matrix with
each essay in a row, and counts of each unique
word-form in columns. To roughly account for
misspellings (which were intentionally preserved
in the transcription process), we first looked for
matches to dictionary terms in the unique word-
forms. The complete dictionary we used consisted
of 121 categories from a few dictionaries: the
LIWC 2015 dictionary, the revised Moral Foun-
dations dictionary (Frimer et al., 2018), and an in-
ternal lab dictionary (Ireland and Iserman, 2018).
We compared words that did not match any dictio-
nary term to those that did; if the unmatched word
was within 1 edit distance (optimal string align-
ment, calculated with the stringdist package; van
der Loo, 2014) of any matched word, we added it
to that matched word. Once we checked all un-
matched words and included them if there was a
close match, we calculated category scores from
the matched words.

After dictionary matching and edit-distance re-
duction, we split the official training sample into
2/3 (6,145) train, and 1/3 (3,072) test samples.
Using the 2/3 training sample, we extracted LDA
topics (using the topicmodels package; Grün and
Hornik, 2011) from the augmented matched words
(excluding function words; Table 1), and calcu-
lated topic scores based on the words in each topic,
in the same way as the dictionary categories. Then
we converted category scores to percents of the au-
thor’s total word count. Once the category scores
were calculated and weighted, we calculated a
few composites (z-scored, averaged combinations
of categories; Table 2). We also calculated the
percent of words captured before and after edit-
distance reduction: Mean dictionary capture be-
fore reduction = 90.24%, after = 95.83%.

2 Modeling and Results

The models we ended up using for our predic-
tions were linear mixed-effects regression mod-
els which estimated intercepts for each sex and
class group (fit with the lme4 package; Bates et al.,
2015). We selected predictors from the full set of
variables by calculating the correlation (Pearson’s
r) of each with each outcome within the 2/3 train-
ing sample; any variable with an absolute correla-

tion over .1 with any of the outcomes was added
as a predictor in all models. These variables in-
cluded word count, and both forms of dictionary
capture percent (Dic; before and after reduction);
the informal, netspeak, prep, focusfuture, and conj
LIWC categories; the fairness.vice Moral Founda-
tions category; and the 7th LDA topic. The esti-
mates from each model are reported in Table 3.
Once we settled on these models, we refit them to
the full official training set, and calculated predic-
tions for submission. The results of these models
on the held-out sample are reported in Table 4.

One motivation for these models was the gen-
erally poor results of the other methods we at-
tempted. We considered recursive partitioning al-
gorithms and elastic net regularization for their ef-
fective reduction of the number of variables. We
applied these to a the full variable set, as well as
sets which variably included individual words and
interaction terms with the controls in addition to
the dictionary categories, and we allowed models
to vary between outcomes. Even though these at-
tempts were more sophisticated in that they had
more potential cues, and attuned to each outcome,
they did not outperform our ultimate, blunt ap-
proach.

Looking at the relationship between our predic-
tions and the actual outcomes in the full training
sample suggests we may have been able to im-
prove some of our predictions by better accounting
for sex. For example, our model predicts psycho-
logical distress at age 23 for women better than it
does for men (Figure 1). For other outcomes, the
model performs equally well between sexes, such
as when predicting total Bristol Social Adjustment
Guide (BSAG) scores at age 11 (Figure 2). These
figures also point to the loose relationships be-
tween predictions and outcomes in general, and
to the very low rates of maladjustment and dis-
tress. The bulk of actual and predicted outcome
scores tended to be low on each scale, and some
of the positive relationship between them seems
to be driven by only a relatively small number of
more extreme scores (those few points that scatter
out toward higher predicted scores).

ture than present psychological distress (relative
to other teams). Within the cross-sectional pre-
dictions, anxiety was least reliably related to our

linguistic predictors. In the future predictions, we
particularly struggled to identify predictors of age
42 psychological distress. Below, we will attempt
to make sense of our exploratory (that is, mostly
unpredicted) findings in the context of existing
literature from clinical psychology and computa-
tional linguistics, focusing primarily on findings
that were relatively robust across concurrent and
future mental health outcomes.

Anxiety. Although the explanation for our
limited success in predicting distress at the lat-
est time point (age 42) is relatively obvious—that
is, predicting mental states and behavior across
time becomes more challenging as the amount of
lapsed time increases—the difficulty of predict-
ing present anxiety is less clear. As the exist-
ing literature on the linguistic correlates of men-
tal health focuses more on depression than anxi-
ety (De Choudhury et al., 2013; Rude et al., 2004;
Tackman et al., 2018), we are reluctant to spec-
ulate on why the signal for depression should be
stronger than for anxiety. Indeed, it may be the
case that depression is studied more frequently in
psychology and computational linguistics specifi-
cally because it has a stronger or more reliable lin-
guistic signal than anxiety or related mental health
conditions (a file-drawer effect).

On the other hand, a more promising explana-
tion (than simply arguing that anxiety is hard to
measure) could be that there were differences in
measurement error between the anxiety and de-
pression measures; perhaps depressive symptoms
were easier for teachers to accurately rate than
anxiety symptoms, in general or in this particular
population of British children. We will be able to
more confidently interpret our weak prediction ac-
curacy for cross-sectional anxiety after exploring
the other teams’ summaries of their successes and
failures in this same subtask.

Dictionary percent capture. One of the most
robust predictors of present and future psycholog-
ical distress was, somewhat surprisingly, rate of
words captured by the dictionary before and after
our automated cleaning process, described above.
Having more words captured by dictionaries—
in other words, using more commonly used and
recognizably spelled words—in the raw (unpro-
cessed) texts predicted less anxiety and depression
at age 11, and less general psychological distress
at ages 23 and 33. These effects were all signif-
icant in the full model, suggesting a useful signal

above and beyond other related predictors, such
as two LIWC measures of less conscientious or
formal language use (netspeak and informal cate-
gories).

Results suggest that misspelling—above and
beyond its moderate association with socioeco-
nomic status (Sénéchal and LeFevre, 2002)—
reflects general psychological distress that is not
limited to a specific disorder or class of symptoms.
If the associations we observed are causal, the
relation between misspellings and distress could
be bidirectional, with distress leading to cognitive
load and distraction from class, and poor academic
engagement or performance exacerbating existing
psychological vulnerabilities via academic stress.

In contrast, the dictionary percent captured af-
ter text processing (automated spelling correction)
was positively correlated with anxiety, depression,
and distress at all but the latest time point. That is,
after accounting for misspellings in the original,
people who use higher frequency words tend to be
more distressed. Again, these results could reflect
a bidirectional relationship between distress and
the various aspects of academic performance that
dictionary percentage may reflect—such as cre-
ativity or vocabulary level. That is, distress may
limit academic performance, and poor academic
performance increases stress for most children.

Word count. Another modest but reliable pre-
dictor of cross-sectional mental health was word
count. Children who wrote fewer words in their
essays had more severe behavioral and psycholog-
ical symptoms, as measured by teachers’ observa-
tions. Verbosity or word count has not played a
major role in most past LIWC research. When
it appears in analyses at all, word count is often
treated as a nuisance variable to be partialed out of
predictive models (Ireland et al., 2011).

However, recent evidence suggests that saying
fewer words in daily life is a robust predictor of
general psychological distress (Mehl et al., 2017).
That finding and our present results dovetail nicely
with earlier theories, partly arising from the ex-
pressive writing paradigm (Pennebaker, 2018),
that inhibition is a key predictor of future physi-
cal illness and psychological distress (Pennebaker,
1989). The rationale is that chronic inhibition
(e.g., when keeping secrets or concealing stig-
matized identities, such as sexual orientation) not
only requires constant vigilance, greatly increas-
ing stress and allostatic load (Meyer, 2003), but

52



also by definition limits individuals’ agency and
self-efficacy, or ability to freely pursue personal
goals (Bandura, 1982).

More parsimoniously, decreased word count in
these essays could simply reflect less academic
engagement or poorer attentional control, per-
haps resulting from higher impulsivity (Stevens
et al., 2018). Along the same lines, future focus
(i.e., future tense verbs and references to the fu-
ture) was positively correlated with overall behav-
ioral problems, suggesting that failing to follow
the instructions—which were to write as though
you were currently age 25—may have reflected
academic defiance or disengagement (refusing to
follow instructions), poor reading comprehension
(not understanding the instructions), or language
impairments (not being able to follow the instruc-
tions).

Other explanations for the associations between
concurrent mental health and word count may
have to do with the nature of the task. Thoughts
about the future—or any area of life that involves
uncertainty—are often a primary source of anxi-
ety for people with anxiety disorders (Grupe and
Nitschke, 2013). Writing as little as possible when
asked to think and write about the future could rep-
resent avoidant coping with an anxiety-inducing
task (Herman-Stabl et al., 1995). Future analyses
may benefit from taking a finer-grained approach
to measuring temporal orientation or prospection,
perhaps differentiating between various aspects of
thinking about the future, including affective fore-
casting, episodic simulation, and autobiographical
planning (Szpunar et al., 2014).

Conjunctions. Conjunctions were positively
correlated with all indicators of psychological dis-
tress except for concurrent anxiety. These results
add to the impression that academic engagement
and conformity to academic norms may have been
the primary predictors of both present and later
life distress for these participants. Conjunctions
are a key part of a language style sometimes re-
ferred to as dynamic or narrative thinking; the op-
posite is categorical or analytic thinking, which
involves more nouns, prepositions, and articles,
and fewer conjunctions, pronouns, adverbs, and
verbs, among a few other categories (Jordan and
Pennebaker, 2017). Dynamic thinking is more
conversational and informal—better suited for so-
cial interactions than an essay writing assignment,
perhaps. Analytic thinking—again, mathemati-

cally the opposite of dynamic thinking—in stu-
dents’ college admissions essays predicts higher
GPAs throughout college (GPA and graduation
rates; Pennebaker et al., 2014).

Fairness (vice). Finally, children who dis-
cussed the “vice” side of fairness (e.g., unfair, un-
equal, bias) experienced more psychological dis-
tress concurrently and in the future (Graham et al.,
2009). The simplest explanation could be that
children talked about what they had experienced
in life, and people who experience chronic mal-
treatment or unfairness have more stress and are
therefore at higher risk for distress and mental ill-
ness (Shonkoff et al., 2012).

Alternately, discussing unfairness in the
future—that is, expecting your future to be as
unfair as your present—could represent hope-
lessness (Van Allen et al., 2015) or pessimism
(Plomin et al., 1992). Hopelessness in particu-
lar has emerged recently as a factor that leads
to poorer adherence to prescribed healthcare
regimens (e.g., in type 1 diabetes mellitus) and
worse health outcomes longitudinally in children
(Van Allen et al., 2015). In other words, hope-
lessness leads to maladaptive coping strategies,
such as disengagement coping or drinking to
cope, and impedes goal-congruent behavior, thus
exacerbating existing mental health vulnerabilities
(Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010).

4 Limitations and Future Directions

If we think of people as agents who act and make
decisions within their relatively immediate envi-
ronments, their lives are Markovian processes, and
so, prediction of their distant positions is bound to
be limited. This perspective is comforting at least
in terms of a sense of free will—it allows for (what
at least feel like) meaningful decisions even within
an effectively deterministic system.

Of course, there are strong considerations of
starting position within the system, and their asso-
ciated levels of adversity. Random walks or those
biased toward known regions will generally hover
around the same position. Moving in a directed
way may also be difficult given any uncertainty
about where a step will lead, so even without ran-
domness or bias, starting positions can be infor-
mative. This is where the sex and class controls
come in.

Directed movement from those initial positions
can be thought of as long term, prospective action,

53



which draws back on the notion of understanding
as a modeling process and means of prediction, as
it allows for such action. This may be one way of
interpreting the LDA topic from the final model:
The 7th LDA topic focuses on family and work,
and may be reflective of an expected future—a fu-
ture potentially modeled and referred to explicitly
by parents, family, and society in general. This
topic is positively related to age 11 anxiety, which
makes sense if seen as an expectation others have
for the child’s future, that the child is aware of
and applies to their own image of their future.
The topic is also related to age 23 distress, which
might make sense if we imagine the child contin-
ues to direct themselves toward others’ expecta-
tions. Cues to models such as this may be a route
to prediction of future states within a stochastic
system insomuch as they speak to the directed be-
havior of the agent. This would stand in contrast
to some theoretical psychological feature outside
of the agent’s control (such as mental health vul-
nerabilities), and to features of their more imme-
diate environment, potentially observable in less
psychologically meaningful linguistic patterns.

At a more quotidian level, any generalizations
that we or interested clinicians can draw from the
current results are limited by our modest effect
sizes—which, as noted above, are partly a conse-
quence of the low base-rates of distress at any time
point in the NCDS sample. As with any prediction
of low base-rate behaviors (such as spree killing or
suicide; e.g., Pokorny, 1983; Iserman and Ireland,
2017; Walsh et al., 2017) based on relatively noisy
behavioral data, the clinical utility of our results is
limited. Any attempt to use the language patterns
that we have identified in clinical practice as di-
agnostic tools or prospective predictors of clients’
future depression or anxiety may lead to a large
number of false positives (Mitchell et al., 2009),
which in some cases may be more ethically trou-
bling than false negatives.

We have no easy solution to our results’ vari-
ous statistical and methodological shortcomings.
Small effect sizes are a common limitation of text
analytic approaches to understanding human psy-
chology, particularly when attempting to predict
low base-rate events or diagnoses (Pennebaker and
King, 1999). Still, text analysis could have prac-
tical value; for example, a clinician might take a
rubber mallet approach, analyzing text (perhaps
that they have already collected, or have ready

access to via social media) for a low impact,
low precision tool to supplement their more in-
tensive and refined tool set. Working with lan-
guage in this way, and focusing on subtle lin-
guistic cues may also positively carry over into
the clinician’s other methods (such as hearing the
client differently in interviews or sessions). Along
the same lines, the current linguistic results—and
similar interpretable findings uncovered by other
Shared Task teams—could help fine-tune (rather
than solely determine) treatment regimens on a
client-by-client basis.

5 Conclusion

One takeaway from this task is that current malad-
justments and future distress are not readily pre-
dictable from largely unrelated writing tasks. We
believe this to be more encouraging than discour-
aging. The only real discouraging aspect of this
perspective is the limit it suggests on the accurate
detection of such issues. The encouraging aspects
are that—in the near term—forms of illadjustment
do not always and overwhelmingly pervade every
aspect of a child’s life (they can imagine their fu-
ture without obvious distress), and that—in the
longer term—children who experience these is-
sues are not destined for inordinate future distress.
Reading through some of the essays and compar-
ing with the adjustment and distress scores seem
to support this perspective as well.

Judging by our rankings, the simplicity of our
approach to the texts may have harmed our age
11 predictions, but it may also have improved our
longer term predictions (or perhaps just failed to
actively harm them). This may be due to the insen-
sitivity of dictionary-based processing; it is lim-
ited in its ability to capitalize on idiosyncrasies (of
individuals or datasets), which may tend to make
it more modest.

Future approaches to similar tasks may bene-
fit from more seamlessly integrating top-down and
bottom-up approaches to dictionary-based predic-
tion. We are encouraged by new strategies that im-
prove theory-driven dictionaries using data-driven
methods (e.g., distributed representations; Garten
et al., 2018) and hope that additional work in that
vein will bolster computational linguists’ ability to
provide clinicians and other practitioners with ac-
tionable insights about mental health.
