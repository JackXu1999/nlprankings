Abstract

We present the results of text reuse de-
tection, based on the corpus of scanned
and OCR-recognized Finnish newspapers
and journals from 1771 to 1910. Our
study draws on BLAST, a software cre-
ated for comparing and aligning biologi-
cal sequences. We show different types of
text reuse in this corpus, and also present
a comparison to the software Passim, de-
veloped at the Northeastern University in
Boston, for text reuse detection.

1 Introduction

The dataset of the National Library of Finland
(NLF) contains 1.95 million pages of digitized
historical newspapers and journals from 1771 to
1910. Approximately half of the content is in
Swedish, the other half in Finnish, although there
are also a few German and Russian papers in-
cluded (Pääkkönen et al., 2016). We aim to trace
the influential texts that were copied and recircu-
lated in Finnish newspapers and journals in this
time period. This is done by clustering the 1771–
1910 NLF corpus with a text reuse detection algo-
rithm. Our approach enables us to study the dis-
semination of news and other information and to
reconstruct the development of the newspaper net-
work as a part of Finnish public discourse: What
kinds of texts were widely shared? How fast did
they spread and what were the most important
nodes in the Finnish media network?

Our research project builds on a similar study

of nineteenth-century US newspapers by Ryan
Cordell, David A. Smith and their research group
(Cordell, 2015; Smith et al., 2015). However, in
contrast to the US press, the nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century Finnish newspapers were typi-
cally printed in the Fraktur typeface, which (to-
gether with other possible sources of noise) poses
unusual difficulties for Optical Character Recogni-
tion (Kettunen, 2016). To solve this problem, we
have developed a novel text reuse detection solu-
tion based on BLAST (Vesanto et al., 2017) that is
accurate and resistant to OCR mistakes and other
noise, making the text circulation and virality of
newspaper publicity in Finland a feasible research
question.

2 Detecting Text Reuse

In the nineteenth century, contemporaries saw
newspapers as reflections of modern culture.
Many phenomena were amplified by the increas-
ing power of the press, including urbanization,
consumerism, and business life. The changes in
transport technology led to more efficient distribu-
tion of information. Before 1880s, there was no
copyright agreement to regulate the free copying
of texts, which became a distinctive feature of the
press. To understand this process, it is essential to
analyze how texts were copied and reprinted.

In Finland, newspaper publishing started
slowly, the first paper being Tidningar Utgifne af
et Sällskap i Åbo in 1771. According to the NLF
metadata, in 1850 there were only ten papers and
six journals. A rapid upheaval occurred at the

end of the century, resulting in 89 papers and 203
journals in 1900. The volume of the press was
thus very limited during the first half of the cen-
tury, which also means that text reuse was small-
scale. Towards the end of the period the situation
changed dramatically, offering more volume for
viral chains of reprints. These chains had different
origins: they were internal chains within the press,
translations from abroad, stories from books, tele-
grams, or official announcements. Therefore, text
reuse detection can shed essential light on how in-
formation flowed between centers within the coun-
try and how, in the end, Finnish press participated
in the global circulation of information.

The primary obstacle in detecting text reuse in
the NLF dataset is the poor OCR recognition rate,
as illustrated in Figure 1. This makes any ap-
proach which assumes exact seed overlaps of sev-
eral words in length infeasible, and calls for a
fuzzy matching method highly tolerant to noise.
To this end, we have applied BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1990), a sequence alignment software de-
veloped for fast matching of biological sequences
against very large sequence databases. The main
features of BLAST are speed and the ability to re-
trieve also distantly related sequences – which in
our case translates to the ability to withstand the
OCR noise present in the data. We index each
page of the NLF data as a sequence in BLAST,
translating the 23 most common lowercase letters
into the amino-acid sequences which BLAST is
hard-coded to handle, and subsequently matching
the pages in an all-against-all scenario, and post-
processing the results to recover the repeated text
segments. We choose not to describe the technical
details of the process in this paper, and rather focus
on the results obtained. The implementation will
be made available as open-source software and in
the following, we focus on presenting the main re-
sults in context of processing historical texts.

3 Text Reuse Clusters – Quantitative
Analysis

In total, we found around 8 million clusters of re-
peated texts that have a total of 49 million occur-
rences (hits) longer than 300 characters. Note,
however, that some clusters refer to the same,
larger repeated news piece, in different lengths.
This is due to the fact that at times the OCR qual-
ity is too low, allowing only for a shorter hit to
be identified in some of the repetitions of an oth-
erwise larger text. Since the surrounding text of
a shorter hit is too dissimilar (which, after all, is
the very reason why only a shorter segment was
found), it is difficult to establish whether these
clusters can be safely merged. Therefore, the num-
ber of found hits does not necessarily fully corre-
spond to the number of unique text reuse.

3.1 BLAST evaluation

As there is not a feasible manner in which to di-
rectly estimate the recall of the system on this data,
we compare our system to Passim, a popular tool
for text reuse detection (Smith et al., 2014) used in
many similar studies previously, so as to establish
a relative comparison to the state-of-the-art. We
form a dataset of 2,000 randomly selected docu-
ments from the NLF corpus, apply both systems
to it, and for every document, we calculate the
fraction of its text that was identified as text reuse,
with a text length minimum set to 100. The results
are summarized in Table 1, and demonstrate a sub-
stantial recall gain of the BLAST-based method.

We can see that the BLAST-based method

vastly outperforms Passim in terms of recall. In
order to establish that this gain in recall is not at
the expense of precision, we sample clusters both
randomly and at the very bottom of BLAST simi-
larity scores still acceptable for inclusion in the re-
sults and manually verify the proportion of those
that are true positives. The proportions are shown
in Table 2. The results naturally depend on the
length of the texts in the cluster, with shorter texts
less likely to be correct hits than the longer ones,
given a constant alignment score.

Table 2: The precision and coverage of the
BLAST method on 50 clusters of varying text hit
lengths, sampled randomly and at the lowest align-
ment scores acceptable.

To understand to what extent the hits identified
as text re-use are dissimilar, we randomly selected
1000 clusters which contain only two hits of at
least 300 characters in length. We then calculate
the pairwise character alignment between these
two hits and measure the proportion of matching
characters, i.e. not gaps nor misalignments. As
shown in Figure 2, the alignment values range
from around 99% down to as low as 40%, with
the bulk of the data in the 70–90% range. For the
most part, the repeated texts thus differ in 10–30%
of positions, but the difference can be as much as
60%. Partly, these are cases of e.g. advertisements
which differ only in numerical values, but partly
these are in fact fully identical texts with a mas-
sive OCR error rate.

The gain in recall comes at the expense of com-
pute time, with BLAST being about three orders of
magnitude slower than Passim. Applying BLAST
to the entire NLF dataset required around 150,000
CPU-core hours. This is certainly out of reach for
a single computer, but well within modern cluster
computing resources, especially since the histori-
cal text collection is static and the run only needs
to be carried out once.

4 Text Reuse Clusters – Qualitative
Analysis

Copying and reprinting texts from other newspa-
pers took three different forms, which is why we
need to differentiate between text reuse, long-term
reuse and virality. First, the majority of reprinted
clusters consists of advertisements and notices, of-
ficial announcements and ecclesiastical material.
Second, many clusters include old news items,
anecdotes, stories and poems that are suddenly
reprinted many decades – sometimes even a hun-
dred years – later. This second group is an ex-
ample of longitudinal text reuse. Finally, the third
group is viral news proper. The amount of viral
news increases towards the end of the nineteenth
century and these texts are often reprinted very
rapidly within a short time frame.

4.1 Advertisements and announcements

The first group of clusters, advertisements and an-
nouncements, might be interesting sources in their
own right for specific research questions. But
above all, the changes in their amount tell us a
lot about the scope of the public communication
network and its historical development year by
year even if we completely overlook the content
of shared texts. For instance, by importing all text
clusters as nodes and edges to a network analy-
sis software, one is able to produce visualizations
of the development of relationships between the
newspapers and show what were the most domi-
nating nodes in the network.

4.2 Longitudinal text reuse

Because of the wide time frame of the NLF
dataset, long-term text reuse opens up an impor-
tant perspective on historical memory. For in-
stance, the Fennomans were an influential group
in the nineteenth-century publicity of the Grand
Duchy of Finland. The papers published around
the turn of the nineteenth century often reprinted
old articles and shorter quotations that supported
their cause. To give an example of this, the Ta-
ble 3 shows the reprints of a patriotic student song
“Ännu på tidens mörka vågor” that was probably
written by Gustaf Idestam (1802–1851) and first
printed in Åbo Morgonblad in 3 March 1821 –
a newspaper edited by the polemical Romanticist
author Adolf Ivar Ardwidsson (1791–1858). The
lyrics of the song were then reprinted three times
in 1891, crediting the Swedish humorous maga-
zine Söndags-Nisse as their source in addition to
Arwidsson’s paper. The song is also described in
Nya Pressen as the favourite anthem of the Turku
students before the introduction of “Vårt land”,
the later national anthem. We have found many
other similar examples that show the way in which
much earlier historical texts were reused for polit-
ical purposes, opening up an important research
question for the strategies of Finnish nationalism.

One example explicitly connected with the state
of the Finnish press is the closing down of Arwids-
son’s newspaper Åbo Morgonblad by the officials
in October 1821. The reasons for this act were
political since Arwidsson had been calling for the
wide freedom of the press in his paper. In the last
issue of Åbo Morgonblad Arwidsson published
the document on the official decision for the act.
In 1891, 70 years later, this text was reprinted by
five different newspapers. The first reprint was in
Åbo Tidningar (30 September 1891), which used
the censorship case of 1821 to discuss the state of
the press freedom in 1891 – the censorship law
was tightened in Autumn 1891. Other newspapers
continued this discussion by reprinting the docu-
ment from 1821 and also commenting the state of
the censorship in 1891. This way the reuse of old
news item offered a way to discuss and criticize
the situation of the press freedom in 1891.

4.3 Viral news

The third group of text reuse are the actual viral
news. According to our preliminary survey of the
clustered NLF newspaper corpus, their amount in-

creases rapidly after the The Crimean War (1853–
1856). For instance, a bank robbery in Helsinki
broke the news in 20 newspapers in 1906. This
item was disseminated very rapidly in the Finnish-
language press, as is shown in the Table 4. Only in
six days it traveled from the urban communication
hubs like Helsinki, Turku, Viipuri and Tampere to
smaller towns in Ostrobothnia, Savonia, Karelia
and Lapland. The viral chain served the need to
rapidly tell about a current incident, although this
happened without any particular plan, through the
existing network of newspapers.

The three categories of text reuse could also
overlap. Longitudinal chains, for example, might
later on transform into viral texts. Old sto-
ries or anecdotes could be reactivated after sev-
eral decades and reused in an infectious manner.
BLAST is effective in revealing these different
temporal rhythms of text reuse.

5 Conclusion

We have presented the use of the BLAST method
to analyze text reuse in a massive corpus of his-
torical newpapers of poor OCR quality. We have
shown that, given sufficient computational power,
the method is capable of identifying reprinted text
passages that, due to OCR noise, may differ in
up to 60% characters when aligned. Analysis of
the clusters discovered by the method provides us
with new insights into the magnitude and differ-
ent types of text reuse, and reveals a number of
individual examples of historical interest. As a fu-
ture work, we will strive to develop a text classi-
fier of the different types and topics of text reuse to
be able to provide their quantitative analysis. The
software developed to carry out the study will be
made publicly available as open-source.
