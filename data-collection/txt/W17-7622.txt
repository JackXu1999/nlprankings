Abstract

This paper discusses how to analyze syntactically irregular expressions in a syntactic treebank. We dis-
tinguish such Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) from comparable non-compositional expressions, i.e.
idioms. A solution is proposed in the framework of Universal Dependencies (UD). We further discuss
the case of functional MWEs, which are particularly problematic in UD.

1 Introduction

In every linguistic annotation project, the delimitation of lower and upper boundaries of the annotation
units constitutes a basic challenge. In syntactic annotation, the lower boundaries are between morphol-
ogy and syntax, the upper boundaries between syntax and discourse organization. This paper discusses
the lower boundaries in syntactic treebank development. We place our analysis in the Universal De-
pendency framework (UD), which constitutes a large community of more than 100 teams around the
globe (Nivre et al. 2016).

In this paper, we want to discuss the problem caused by idioms in syntactic annotation. The litera -
ture on idioms and MWEs is immense (Fillmore et al. 1988, Mel’čuk 1998, Sag et al. 2002, etc.). Our
goal is not to mark the extension of MWEs on top of the syntactic annotation (see Savary et al. 2017
for a recent proposition). Our purpose is to tackle the impact of idiomaticity on the syntactic annota-
tion itself.  Most idioms (such as  kick the bucket  or  green card) do not  cause any trouble for the
syntactic  annotation  because  their  internal  syntactic  structure  is  absolutely  transparent  (and  it  is
precisely because they have an internal syntax that they are idioms and not words). Some expressions,
however, such as not to mention, heaven knows who, by and large, Rio de la Plata  (in English), are
problematic for a syntactic annotation, because they do not perfectly respect the syntactic rules of free
expressions.

We propose two contributions:

 For a coherent  annotation it  is  crucial  to distinguish  syntactically irregular structures from
semantically non-compositional units. These notions are highly correlated but distinct and we
propose criteria to distinguish them.

 We explore different ways of annotating these two kinds of Multi-Word Expressions and their
combinations in a syntactic treebank, with a special focus on functional MWEs.

Section 2 proposes a simple typology of MWEs opposing semantic compositionality and syntactic
regularity.  In  section  3,  we  lay  the  basis  of  our  analysis  by  discussing  the  syntactic  units  of  a
dependency annotation and point to problems in the current UD scheme (version 2.1). In section 4, we
propose to analyze MWEs with an internal syntactic structure according to their level of syntactic
regularity. We show how an MWE can be introduced into the current CoNLL-U format as a unit with
its own POS. In section 5, we introduce two convertible dependency schemes for functional MWEs
before concluding in section 6 with an example combining the MWE as a separated unit with the new
convertible scheme for functional MWEs.

2 Idioms and syntactic irregularity

We distinguish idiomatic expressions from syntactically irregular constructions. Idiomaticity is a se-
mantic notion and semantics has to be annotated apart from syntax.

Even if it is not our purpose to define idiomaticity here, let us give some thoughts to the matter. Fol -
lowing Fillmore 1988 (with his encoding and decoding idioms) or Mel’cuk 1998 (with his phraseme
and collocation), we distinguish two levels of non-compositionality. We adopt the point of view of en-
coding: “Compositionality […] is to be distinguished from analysability, which pertains instead to the
extent to which speakers are cognizant […] of the contribution that individual component structures
make to the composite whole.” (cf. Langacker 1987:457). An MWE is an  idiom (i.e.  non-composi-
tional) if its components cannot be chosen individually by the speaker (kick the bucket is chosen as a
whole and there is no possible commutation on its components).1 An MWE is a collocation (i.e semi-
compositional) if one of its component is chosen freely (the basis) and the other one (the collocate) is
chosen according to the basis (in wide awake, wide can be suppressed and awake keeps the same con-
tribution: awake is the basis and wide is a collocate expressing intensification with awake).

We also consider three levels of syntactic irregularity. First, natural languages contain some syntac-
tic subsystems which do not follow the general properties of syntactic relations. For instance, most
languages have particular constructions for named entities such as dates or titles. English has a regular
construction N N, where the second noun is the head (pizza boy, Victoria Lake) but it also has a sub-
system where the first noun is the head, used for named entities (Lake Michigan,  Mount Rushmore,
Fort Alamo). These subsystems are in some sense “regular irregularities”, that is, productive unusual
constructions. Similarly, English produces a high number of multi-word adverbs from a preposition
and a bare noun as in on top (of) or in case (of), thus forming another sub-system that does not con-
form to the typical syntactic system of English.

Second, languages have non-productive irregular constructions. Most of these irregular construc-
tions are idioms,  but  some are compositional.  This is  the case of Fr.  peser lourd  ‘weigh a lot/be
significant’, lit. weigh heavy, where  lourd is an adjective that commutes only with NPs (peser une
tonne ‘weigh one ton’).2 Even the commutation with its antonym léger ‘light’ is impossible. Another
example is Fr. cucul la praline ‘very silly’, lit. silly the praline. It is a collocation: the adjective cucul
can be used alone and the NP la praline is an intensifier. The POSs of the units are clear, and the de-
pendency structure can be reconstructed, but it is unusual to have an NP modifying an adjective.

We consider four cases of non-productive irregular constructions. 

a. Structures with a clear POS and dependency structure but that function as a whole differently
than their syntactic head: the coordinating conjunction headed by a verb not to mention (they gave us
their knowledge, not to mention their helpfulness), the adjective top of the range, headed by a noun (as
in  a very top of  the range restaurant),  the French pronoun  Dieu sait  quoi  ‘heaven knows what’,
headed by a verb.

b. For some sequences, the POS are clear, but the dependency structure has to be reconstructed dia-
chronically (the Fr. pronoun n’importe quoi ‘anything’, lit. no matter what)3 or inversely, the depen-
dency structure is clear but the POS have to be reconstructed (the adverb  by and large – by being
originally an adverb).

c. Other sequences have no clear internal dependency structure at all, while the POS remain clear:
each other, Fr. à qui mieux mieux ‘each trying to do better than the other’, lit. to whom better better.

1 An idiom can be semantically transparent (Svensson 2008). For example, it is quite clear that a washing machine is a ma-
chine that is used to wash something, but is an idiom because it is arbitrary that this denotes a machine for washing clothes
and not a dishwasher or a high-pressure water cleaner. An idiom can even be semantically analyzable, cf. Gibbs 1994:278:
“Idioms like pop the question […], spill the beans, and lay down the law are ‘decomposable’, because each component ob-
viously contributes to the overall figurative interpretation.”
2 How the relation between peser and lourd must be analyzed in UD is not quite clear. Lourd should probably be analyzed
as an xcomp of peser but if we do that we lose the fact that lourd is in the paradigm of NPs analyzed as obj.
3 Diachronically, quoi is the subject of importe but now it is recognized as an object due to its position.

182



d. Some sequences have neither clear POS nor an internal structure in the language of the corpus:
the adjective ad hoc, the proper noun Al Qaeda, and the Fr. SCONJ parce que ‘because’.4

Table 1. Different types of MWEs

Table  1 opposes degrees  of  syntactic regularity  in  the  rows and semantic compositionality in the
columns. In section 4, we will propose an annotation scheme for irregular constructions and for some
non-compositional sub-systems.

3 MWE in UD

3.1 MWE and tokenisation

The tokenization of UD follows the underlying principle that tokens must be words or parts of words.
A priori no token contains spaces (except well delimited cases of polysyllabic words) and therefore
multi-word expressions are described syntactically and not morphologically. This is a vital choice for
practical and theoretical reasons: Ambiguous sequences cannot be disambiguated on a morphological
level without taking into account the whole sentence. Therefore, the alternative choice of multi-word
tokens containing spaces is problematic: In the manual annotation process, creating the tokenization
and the syntactic analysis at the same time is time-consuming, annotating a special link for MWE is
much more user-friendly. For automatic parsing, too, a tokenization as a separate task that precedes
the actual dependency annotation is redundant because both tools need a global view on the sentence –
and syntactic parsers are specialized tools to do just  that.  Moreover, two annotations of the same
sentence are  harder  to  compare  if  they are  based on different  tokenizations  and a  spelling-based
annotation  makes  that  possible  because  it  does  not  depend  on  the  possibly  ambiguous  syntactic
annotation itself.

Inversely, grouping Multi-Word Expressions together in a syntactic annotation scheme can at its
most simple form always be achieved by introducing into the set of relations special ad hoc links for
multi-words. UD makes use of this approach with the links fixedand flat5 where no internal struc-
ture is annotated. In UD terms we could reformulate the purpose of the paper simply as: When must
the fixed relation be used?

3.2 Problems with the MWE encoding in UD

This work springs from a recognition that the treatment of functional MWEs in UD is unsatisfactory
for at least four reasons:

4 Historically parce is the preposition par ‘through’ and the pronoun ce ‘that’, but this is not visible in today’s orthography.
The attribution of a POS to parce seems arbitrary and the French UD treebanks are subsequently incoherent: Fr-Original
calls parce an ADV, Fr-Sequoia an SCONJ, and Fr-ParTUT has both versions. 
5 flat is a relation used for headless constructions (such as Bill Clinton for which is it not easy to decide which word is
the head). This relation concerns productive and regular sub-systems and will not be discussed here.

183



1) The relation fixed is commonly used for MWEs with a very clear internal syntactic structure (see
Figure 1).6 

Figure 1. Analyses with fixed in En-PartTUT and Fr-Original

When analyzing them as  fixed MWEs, we flatten the structure, losing precious information in the
process, which will give us fewer instances of these syntactic relations on which to train our parser (cf.
Gerdes & Kahane 2016’s principles as well as the principles given on the UD introduction page).
Moreover, the analysis is somewhat contradictory: If we recognize the POSs of the components (such
as the verbal nature of  importe in Fr.  n’importe quoi  ‘anything’, lit. no matter what), then we could
also recognize the dependency relations that the tokens entertain.

2) Currently, the criteria to decide which constructions enter the realm of MWEs are insufficient and
we observe a lot of discrepancies between different treebanks and even inside a single treebank. 

For instance along with appears with three analyses. In En-ParTUT along is considered as the case
marker of the noun phrase and  with as  along’s fixed dependent. On the other hand, En-Original
mainly favors a compositional analysis with both along and with as  case markers, but there is also
one occurrence where along is a cc dependent of the noun phrase and with along’s fixed dependent. 

Tables 2 and 3 give an overview of the usage of the MWE-relations in the English and French UD
treebanks. When comparing the highlighted lines in the English and the French tables, we observe that
the usage that annotators make from the three MWE relations  compound,  fixed,  and  flat go
beyond what can be expected as language and genre differences and rather seems to indicate that the
annotators understood the relations differently. This is corroborated by the high inter-corpus variation,
for French, too. The two French treebanks Fr-FTB and Fr-Sequoia, for example, do not use compound
at all. The significant number of observed incoherences in these two languages suffices to show that
the UD annotation guide for MWE relations clearly deserves an overhaul in order to achieve a higher
inter-language, inter-corpus, and inter-annotator annotation.

3)The POS of an MWE as a whole does not appear explicitly.

The assumption made is that the MWE will have the same POS as its syntactic head but many ex-
amples show that this is not the case. For example not to mention is a coordinating conjunction, a use-
ful information for a syntactic parser that cannot be retrieved from the POS of its units.

6 UD’s definition of fixed refers to Sag et al. (2002) who say: “Fixed expressions are fully lexicalized and undergo nei -
ther morphosyntactic variation (cf. *in shorter) nor internal modification (cf. *in very short). As such, a simple words-with-
spaces representation is sufficient. If we were to adopt a compositional account of fixed expressions, we would have to in-
troduce a lexical entry for “words” such as hoc, resulting in overgeneration and the idiomaticity problem (see above).” Let
us remark that, first, limits on modification do not imply weird lexical entries, as the example in short shows itself – the
two words being in the lexicon anyhow. Second, and most importantly, an MWE can have constraints on modification for a
specific meaning while still remaining transparent for the speaker, not only diachronically: in short, for example, is identifi-
able as a prepositional phrase, even if short is originally an adjective. This leads to multiple but syntactically constrained
internal modifications of MWEs, not only in puns and journalistic style, but more generally also in ordinary coordinations
and elisions as we will see below. Note also that the current 2.0 En-Original corpus consistently annotates in short (3 occur-
rences) and for short (1 occurrence) as a compositional prepositional phrase (case-nmod), contrarily to Sag’s paper refer-
enced in the annotation guide.

4) The span of MWEs in the current UD scheme is questionable in some cases, especially concerning
governed prepositions, which are not separated from the MWE itself (cf. of in Figure 2, below).7

4 Propositions for the encoding of MWEs in UD

All regular constructions from Table 1, including idioms, should be analyzed internally because:

1. Such a tree is syntactically more informative than any type of flattened structure where
readily available syntactic relations have been removed.

2. We can expect a higher inter-annotator agreement on the syntactic relations if the annota -
tion of MWE is kept independent from syntax, because of the difficulty of defining and
recognizing MWEs

3. Equally, we can expect better parsing results because we have more instances of every re-
lation and unknown idioms can obtain a correct parse, too.

The same holds for all compositional and semi-compositional constructions. We even go as far as
proposing to analyze non-productive irregular constructions in case a) and b) by regular syntactic rela -
tions, but for some MWEs, we need means of encoding the POS of the whole expression because its
POS is not identical to its head’s POS. We propose to use fixed only for parts of c) and d) where the
regular syntax does not provide appropriate syntactic relations. 

In some MWE of c) and d), some relations remain transparent and we could annotate partial struc-
tures whenever they are available. For example à qui mieux mieux contains a clear à <case- qui rela-
tion independent of the analysis of the rest of the expression.

7 The preposition can be repeated (According to the President and  to the Secretary of State – the repetition can disam-
biguate the scope of the shared element in the coordination) which seems incompatible with the fixed analysis favored in
the English treebanks. In other languages, such as French, the repetition is quite systematic. In English, governed preposi-
tions are particularly cohesive with their governor, giving us what is called preposition stranding in extraction (the girl I
talk to). But even in this case, nobody denies that the verb talk subcategorizes a preposition phrase and that the preposition
to is not part of the verb form. The fact that the preposition is not a part of the idiom becomes even clearer with expressions
such as in front of X, where the subcategorized phrase can be suppressed (she stopped in front) or pronominalized (in its
front). Note that the alternative classical dependency analysis where prepositional phrases are governed by prepositions re -
sults in a more coherent analysis because the governor (the verb or the expression) always forms a subtree with the sub-cat -
egorized preposition, independently of the extension given to the MWE.

185



For  those  remaining  fixed relations,  dependency distance  measures  would  give  more  reliable
result if the standard bouquet annotation (all words depending on the first token) would be replaced by
a series of left-to-right relations connecting one word to its neighbor, because the absence of any
recognizable syntactic relation rather implies some relation of simple juxtaposition than a structure
headed by the first word.

The CoNLL-U format can easily be extended to allow for a fully expressive annotation of MWEs.
One solution is to devote one specific column holding the idiomatic information (or equally, put this
information into a specific attribute in the feature column of CoNNL-U). This choice does not allow
embedding MWEs in one another. A better choice is to extend the current multi-word token format by
adding a line for each MWE. This additional line could also include the POS of the whole expression. 8
It  constitutes  an  additional  unit  that  can  constitute  a  node  of   a  semantic  graph.  This  could  be
combined with a specific MWE column or simply a specific feature in the additional line’s FEATS
column that distinguishes different types of non-compositionality, following the Parseme project: for
instance idioms, light-verb constructions, and named entities. 

In the following example, the governor of the MWE top of the range is shoe. But the head/root of
the MWE is top.

Figure 2. UD analysis of the adjective top of the range (case a)Functional MWEs in UD

UD presents a particular problem with functional MWEs, because UD favors dependencies between
content words (determiners and prepositions are dependents of the noun following them).  It appears
that the choice made by UD to have the prepositions as dependent of their complement is the source of
some “catastrophes” (in the mathematical sense of the term) as soon as “prepositional” MWEs are in -
volved (Gerdes & Kahane 2016). The goal of this section is to present the problem and to propose a
solution to smooth it.

Let us consider the following examples illustrating what is often called a complex determiner (1a)
and a complex preposition (1b):

1. (a) She asked me a lot of questions.
(b) She lives in front of my house.

We can compare these sentences with (2a) and (2b):

2. (a) She asked me many questions.
(b) She lives near my house.

According to the choices made by UD, we have dependencies between asked and questions in (2a) and
between lives and house in (2b) (Figure 3)

Figure 3. UD analysis of 2a and 2b
8 Currently the format is only used for contiguous items. The format can be extended to non-contiguous expressions, e.g.
we could have “3-5,7-8” as an index.

It is tempting to preserve these dependencies and to treat  a lot of and  in front of respectively as a
complex determiner and a complex preposition. Let us first remark that of in these expressions is not
part of the MWE, but is part of the sub-categorization of the MWE, by parallelism with verbal sub-
categorization  (cf.  footnote  7,  although  the  coherence  of  these  expressions  is  higher  and  the
preposition cannot always be repeated alone). In other words, the MWEs in question are a lot and in
front. Theses MWEs are syntactically transparent and we do not want to analyze them with fixed.
Two analyses are possible. 

Analysis A respects the surface syntax and of N is treated as the complement (nmod) of the MWE.
This is the most common analysis in the current English UD treebanks.9

Figure 4. Analysis A for a lot (of) and in front (of)

Analysis B favors the relation between content words, as in the analyses of Figure 3. In this analysis,
we propose to introduce special relations det:complex and case:complex when the dependents of
det and case are MWEs.

Figure 5. Analysis B for a lot (of) and in front (of)

The sub-categorized preposition of  is governed by the complement noun. We introduce a feature on
the case relation to indicate that this preposition is subcategorized by a dependent of the noun. We
need to distinguish case:depdet and case:depcase because both can be present: in front of a lot
of houses, where front, lot and the two of will depend on houses.

Figure 6. Analyses A and B for in front of a lot of houses

Both analyses A and B are interesting. It is possible not to choose and to allow the conversion from
one analysis to the other. For that we need to enrich analysis A, by adding the subtype :antidet and
:anticase to the standard nmod relations which go the other way in the B analysis (and are labeled
det:complex and case:complex).

Figure 7. Enhanced analysis B for a lot (of) and in front (of)

9 Since quite a lot (of questions) is possible, a lot has actually become an adverb (just like in a lot better – or other compar-
ative adjectives) and the relation between a lot and the noun complement of questions should be of type obl and not nmod
as it is in the current English UD treebanks. This irregular behavior of a lot can be captured by the introduction of an MWE
unit as in Section 4.

Our rules of conversion are:

Similar rules could be used to get a surface syntax-based representation from UD:10

5 Conclusion

We have shown that irregular structures need to be introduced as units because we have to associate a
POS to them. In cases a) and b) the internal structure is transparent but the POS of the complete unit is
not predictable. In cases c) and d),  where we use  fixed relations, it  is all  the more necessary to
indicate the POS of the MWE. For regular idioms, too, we can add the MWE as a unit.

For regular functional MWEs, we propose to add sub-types to the relation to capture the relations
between content words, as well as the syntactic dominance relations. A tree does not allow expressing
both types of relations at the same time, but the proposed sub-types relations can be converted from
one to another.11 

The two proposals are orthogonal and can be combined. For example, if we want to treat a lot as an
adverb, we can have the analysis of Figure 8:

Figure 8. Analysis A and B for quite a lot of questions

The proposed schemes and distinctions clarify some underspecifications in the current UD scheme
that lead to incoherent analyses. The usage of subtypes fits in unintrusively into the current scheme
and could be used for upcoming versions. More generally, it allows back and forth conversions of UD
and more classical subcategorization-based dependency annotation schemes.

10 The conversion of chains of auxiliaries (would have been done) to a surface syntax-based representation (would –anti-
aux> have –antiaux> been –antiaux> done) is presently problematic in UD 2 because all auxiliaries depend on the
lexical verb. This suggests enriching the UD annotation either in the same way as proposed here in analysis A (with a
casedep feature for a second case introduced by a first case) or by replacing the current bouquet style annotation with
a chain of auxiliaries, an auxiliary depending on the auxiliary it subcategorizes.
11 In this paper, we started from the UD annotation scheme and we have used UD’s relation names. The names case and
anticase could suggest that case has a sort of primacy on anticase. But anticase is simply the obj relation be-
tween a preposition and its direct complement.
