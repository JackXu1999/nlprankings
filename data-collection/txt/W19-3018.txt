Abstract

This paper describes our system submission
for the CLPsych 2019 shared task B on sui-
cide risk assessment. We approached the prob-
lem with three separate models: a behaviour
model; a language model and a hybrid model.
For the behavioral model approach, we model
each user’s behaviour and thoughts with four
groups of features: posting behaviour, senti-
ment, motivation, and content of the user’s
posting. We use these features as an input
in a support vector machine (SVM). For the
language model approach, we trained a lan-
guage model for each risk level using all the
posts from the users as the training corpora.
Then, we computed the perplexity of each
user’s posts to determine how likely his/her
posts were to belong to each risk level. Finally,
we built a hybrid model that combines both
the language model and the behavioral model,
which demonstrates the best performance in
detecting the suicide risk level.

1 Introduction

Every year, there are over 800,000 people who die
of suicide (WHO, 2019). Although health care
systems play a major role in assessment of sui-
cide risk, given limited time, clinicians are unable
to assess thoroughly all the risk factors. One of
the most important warning signs for suicide is
the expressions of suicidal thoughts. The standard
practice of clinicians asking people about suici-
dal thoughts cannot effectively predict and prevent
suicide, because most patients who died of suicide
did not report any suicidal thoughts when asked by
a doctor (McHugh et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2016),
therefore, many of them were assessed to have a
low or moderate risk before their suicide attempts
(Powell et al., 2000).

The CLpsych 2019 shared task B (Zirikly et al.,
2019) attempts to address the challenge of auto-
matic suicide risks asssessment using people’s fo-
rum postings. The aim of the task is to distinguish

the levels of suicide risks among users who posted
any contents in the suicide watch (SW) subreddit.
The dataset includes all the posts (N = 31,553) in
any subreddit from 621 users who had posted on
SW. One of the four risk levels ranging from ”No
Risk” to ”Severe Risk” was assigned to each user
according to their SW posts. The annotation pro-
cess is described in Shing et al. (2018).

We treat the task as a multi-classification prob-
lem. We approach it with three models: a be-
havioural model (BM), a suicide language model
(SLM) and a hybrid model (HMBM SLM ) that
combines the (BM) and (SLM) models. The SLM
offers good classification accuracy, but it does not
provide any human interpretable reason for its
classification decisions. Hence, we define a col-
lection of features to better capture users’ posting
behaviours and thoughts, then we use these fea-
tures in the BM. The overall results show that the
hybrid model (HMBM SLM ) performs the best in
identifying the risk level with a f1 score 38% for
the CLPsych task B.

2 Related work

Suicide is a complex behaviour involving biologi-
cal, psychological and social factors. For psycho-
logical factors, a large amount of literature sug-
gests that a history of psychiatric disorders, es-
pecially affective disorders, is a strong predictor
of suicide (Angst et al., 2002; Brent et al., 1993;
Bostwick and Pankratz, 2002). Another important
precursor of suicide is self-harm or previous at-
tempt. Biological and social factors that contribute
to suicide include: substance abuse (Vijayakumar
et al., 2011; Hawton et al.; Bergen et al., 2012;
Chan et al., 2016; Joiner, 2007), gender (males
have a higher suicide risk) and living alone(Joiner,
2007).

The suicidal behaviour model by Wilson et al.
(2005); Cukrowicz et al. (2011) proposed that
the unmet need of belonging (e.g. relationship



153

breakup) and the self perceived burden were the
major motivations for suicidal behaviors (Trout,
1980). Other motivations include: having a neg-
ative self-image, hopelessness (Kovacs and Garri-
son, 1985), and having a plan of the suicidal at-
tempt. The duration, intensity, and frequency of
the suicidal desires also indicate the pertinacity to
the attempt.

The majority of the prior work on the sui-
cide risk detection focuses on manually generated
(BoW) features centering only around the textual
cues of the user’s post (Varathan and Talib, 2014;
O’Dea et al., 2015), such as the LIWC pre-trained
word embeddings (Husseini Orabi et al.) or su-
pervised learning topics (e.g., latent Dirichlet al-
location) (Ji et al., 2018). Unlike these studies, we
design a model that leverages user’s behavioural
data in combination with a suicide language model
to detect the suicide risk level. Our features intend
to capture the language and behavioral character-
istics proposed by clinical literature as suicide risk
factors. For example, we develop a feature vec-
tor that represent suicide motivations. Examining
the validity of these features in our experimental
model provides us a way to understand the preva-
lence of these characteristics in people with differ-
ent suicide risk levels.

3 Suicide risk identification models

In this study, we propose three models to mea-
sure suicide risk levels. BM uses user’s posting
behaviours and manual selected language charac-
teristics to predict suicidal risk level. SLM learns
the language characteristics of each risk level. The
hybrid model (HMBM SLM ) combines the advan-
tages of the BM and SLM models.

3.1 Behavioral model

Most of the existing studies focus on the lan-
guage used in expressing suicide thoughts, and
only a small number of them examine the behav-
ioral and thought patterns on social media. For
instance, Colombo et al. (2016) use twitter fol-
lowers, friends, and number of retweets to repre-
sent the connectivity between users having suicide
ideas. Based on the clinical literature, we engi-
neer four sets of features that capture user behav-
iors and thoughts for the Behavioural model (BM),
including: posting behaviour, sentiment, content,
and motivation for suicide. Posting behaviours
consist of users’ posting patterns in SW, mental

health related subreddits and all the other subred-
dits. Sentiment features consist of a sentiment
profile for each user, user’s sentiment towards se-
lected topics (e.g., friends and family). Content
features consist of Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2001), EM-
PATH (Fast et al., 2016) and count vectors normal-
ized by TF-IDF (Salton and McGill, 1986). For
the motivation features, we use a word count ap-
proach to define whether the user have suggested
any motivations.

Some of these features were constructed us-
ing Suicide Watch (SW) posts only, while others
were constructed using all the reddit posts from
the users. Although many of these posts might
not be directly related to suicide thoughts, we hy-
pothesized that using irrelevant posts to define a
user’s interaction behaviour and emotional magni-
tude would help to identify the virtual community
of the users with suicide risk.

3.1.1 Sentiment
Sentiment profile. The sentiment of each user’s
previous posting was used to identify the similar-
ity between users’ postings. This set of features
are represented as a vector of sentiment value cor-
responding to a user’s previous posting. Then, we
use the Levenshtein Distance to compute the sim-
ilarity between two such vectors (Yujian and Bo,
2007).

Topic Sentiment. We inspect the sentiment
of specific topics in the SW posts. We extract
the sentences containing keywords related to fam-
ily members (e.g. mom, dad), partners (e.g.
boyfriend), and self (e.g. myself). We then use
sentiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2010) to detect the
sentiment values of these sentences and aggregate
the topic sentiment at a user level.

3.1.2 Posting behaviours
Frequency of posting We use the number of
posts, word count in each post, whether and when
a user posts more frequently as features. To check
whether a user has recently started posting more
frequently, we define a posting frequency vector
by computing the average posting time interval be-
tween any two posts from a user. We use a slid-
ing window from the head to the tail of the fre-
quency vector to identify which time interval(s)
are at least one standard deviation below the mean
of all intervals. Users are highly likely to post
more frequently if the last window is one standard



154

deviation below the mean. Frequency of posting
is inspected in the SW posts, all user posts, and
posts involving mental illnesses and drugs use. To
extract the posts involving mental illnesses and
drugs use, we compile a dictionary of mental ill-
nesses names and symptoms. Posts that contain
words from this dictionary are selected. Mean-
while, posts from subreddits that are associated
with mental illnesses self help groups (e.g., self-
harm, TwoXADHD) are also extracted.

3.1.3 Motivation factors
Financial problems, drug use, mental illness his-
tory, relationship break up, hopelessness, suicide
tools and self-harm have been found to be pre-
dictive to suicidal behaviors (Kessler et al., 1999).
In our study, we compile dictionaries for each of
the motivation factors. Terms in drug use, mental
illness and suicide tools dictionaries are extracted
from websites using the webscraping techniques.

3.1.4 Content feature
We use both the open and closed BoW approaches
to generate the content feature. For the open vo-
cabulary approach, we counted the term frequency
and normalized it with tf-idf. For the closed vo-
cabulary approach, we used LIWC and Empath.
Both tools are used to count words from prede-
fined psychologically meaningful categories.

3.1.5 Clustering
We use model-based clustering (Banfield and
Raftery, 1993) to group sentiment, posting be-
haviour and motivation factors. Model-based clus-
tering assumes that the data are formed by mul-
tiple Gaussians. The clustering algorithm tries to
recover the models that generate the data. The best
model is selected according to the Bayesian infor-
mation criterion (BIC). We adopt five clusters as
our solution.

3.2 Suicide language model

The behavioural model (BM) enables us to ob-
serve the behavioral and thought differences
among individuals with various suicide risk levels.
However, one disadvantage of the BM approach is
that we might miss some relevant cases that do not
contain words in the manually selected dictionary,
or include irrelevant cases but contain the dictio-
nary words.

With this challenge in mind, we also tackle
the suicide risk classification problem with sui-

cide language modeling (SLM). Language model-
ing is used in domains such as machine translation,
speech recognition and text classification (McCal-
lum et al., 1998; Brants et al., 2007; Coppersmith
et al., 2014). The principle of language model-
ing is to compute a probability distribution over
words in order to determine how likely a specific
language model is to generate a given document.
In our case, we train one model for each risk level.
Then, we calculate a document’s likelihood (per-
plexity) for all the models, and select the model
with the best score.

4 Dataset and experiment setup

The dataset used for training the models is pro-
vided by the CLPsych shared task B (Zirikly et al.,
2019). It contains 621 reddit users who had posted
on SW with an overall of 31,553 posts. The users
are labeled as ”no risk” (class A), ”low risk” (class
B), ”moderate risk” (class C), and ”severe risk”
(class D). Dataset statistics is presented in table 1.
From the training set, it is shown that nearly half
of the posts were labeled as ”severe risk”, class
B only accounts for less than 10% of the posts.
Nearly half of the posts in both the training and
testing sets did not have any contents in the post
body.

4.1 Suicide language model setup
We train the (SLM) language model with the min-
imal processed data (raw text), and tokenized and
truecased data. For the raw text model, the data
are preprocessed as follows: Sentences are split
by the NLTK sentence splitter and then spaces
are inserted around each full stop to make sure
mis-spelled cases are parsed correctly. For exam-
ple, ”tomorrow.And today” is processed as ”to-
morrow . And today”. For the tokenized and
truecased model, we apply the tokenizer and true-
caser from the Moses machine translation toolkit



155

(Koehn et al., 2007).
The language model is trained with KenLM’s

default settings (modified Kneser-Nay smoothing)
(Heafield et al., 2013). In each model, all the posts
from a redditor and annotated with a specific risk
level are used as the training corpora. All the posts
from a redditor are treated as a single document.
To assign a risk level to the document, we calcu-
late its perplexity for each language model, and
assign the document’s class based on the language
model that produces the lowest perplexity score.
We experiment with the context windows of 3 to
6-gram, and find that 4-gram works the best.

5 Experiments

In the SLM, for each document, the model with
the lowest perplexity is assigned to the document.
Perplexity is the inverse probability of a test set,
normalized by the number of words, a low per-
plexity indicates that the probability distribution is
good at predicting the sentence (Sennrich, 2012).
Given a sample test, we calculate its likelihood for
all the models, and select the model with the best
score.

In the BM, we use random forest to select
the top 300 features to use in the final predic-
tion. We validate our BM features on the multi-
classification problem using support vector ma-
chines (SVM) in scikitlearn 1. We use the 5-fold
cross validation on training data and grid-search
parameters to explore both the kernels and margin
of the hyperplane (C parameter).

Furthermore, we construct a hybrid model
based on our observations on the prediction results
from the SLM and the BM. In the training pro-
cess, we observe the BM is weak in distinguishing
classes B and C, but the SLM is better in identi-
fying class B. Therefore, we adopt the class B re-
sults from the SLM. We also find that some posts
in class A are suicide experiences from someone
associated with the authors, but not the authors
themselves. The BM is better than the language
model in identifying these cases, so we use the
BM for class A. However, if the confidence score
is lower than 0.4, the SLM becomes better at iden-
tifying class A. Therefore, we replace the results
with confidence score lower than 0.4 with those
from the SLM model.

6 Results

Table 2 shows the test set results of the three
models. Table 3 shows f1 for flagged vs. non-
flagged and urgent vs. non-urgent. Flagged vs.
non-flagged distinguished class A from the rest of
the classes. Urgent vs. non-urgent distinguished
classes A, B with classes C, D. The hybrid model
had the best average f1 macro in the risk assess-
ment task.

In our test set result, we find that SLM is over-
fitting. SLM classifies most of the posts to class D
in the testing set. Whereas, the BM has consistent
good performances on classes A and D, but poor
performances on classes B and C.

7 Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that suicide risk can be
gauged by user’s posting behaviors. Suicide risk
factors identified by clinical literature are useful
in automatic detection of suicide risks. Suicide
language can be modeled by statistical language
model, especially for risk level B and D, in which
cases it surpasses the behavioral model. Hence, a
combination of the two models results in a more
accurate user classification. As a future work, a
further analysis of each feature would gauge its
contribution towards identifying suicide risk lev-
els.
