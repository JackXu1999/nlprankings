Abstract

The paper investigates the potential effects
user features have on hate speech classifica-
tion. A quantitative analysis of Twitter data
was conducted to better understand user char-
acteristics, but no correlations were found be-
tween hateful text and the characteristics of
the users who had posted it. However, ex-
periments with a hate speech classifier based
on datasets from three different languages
showed that combining certain user features
with textual features gave slight improvements
of classification performance. While the in-
corporation of user features resulted in vary-
ing impact on performance for the different
datasets used, user network-related features
provided the most consistent improvements.

1 Introduction

Detecting hate speech has become an increasingly
important task for online communities, but auto-
matic hate speech detection is a challenging task,
which the majority of the research in the field is
targeting through textual features. However, as
shown by, e.g., Gröndahl et al. (2018), there is
a need for further efforts to improve the qual-
ity and efficiency of detection methods, motivat-
ing for studies on how non-textual features can be
utilised to enhance detection performance.

The goal of this research is to investigate in-
formation related to users in the Twitter commu-
nity that can be helpful in identifying online hate
speech, and use this as features in hate speech clas-
sification. Information about the users could be ei-
ther known factors, such as age and gender, or fac-
tors derived from behaviour. There exists research
that investigates the impact of different features,
and research about the personality and behaviour
of users expressing hate speech. However, there is
little research that combines the two topics.

Most early studies on automatic recognition of
online hate speech focused on lexicon-based ap-
proaches for detecting “bad” words, with Kwok
and Wang (2013) finding that 83% of their data
was annotated racist due to the presence of of-
fensive words. However, these approaches tend
to give low precision by mistakenly classifying all
messages containing specific terms as hate speech,
which is particularly problematic on social media
sites that have a relatively high prevalence of of-
fensive words (Wang et al., 2014). After all, hate
speech can be much more sophisticated than that.

Finding the features that best represent the un-
derlying phenomenon of hate speech is challeng-
ing. Later studies have mainly focused on content-
based text classification using features such as the
appearance or frequency of words, spelling mis-
takes or semantic meaning, but while these meth-
ods perform relatively well, there is still need for
improvements to increase the quality of detection.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 discusses previous studies related to the
authors of hate speech and Section 3 presents the
datasets used together with an analysis of user
characteristics. Section 4 describes the classifier
developed, while Section 5 details the experiments
conducted to measure the impact of user features.
Section 6 sums up the research contributions along
with suggestions for potential future work.

2 Related Work

Including user information in methods for detect-
ing hate speech is an under-researched area. How-
ever, related to hate speech detection are studies
of the people that post hateful content online, in-
cluding characteristics and behavioural traits that
are typical of the authors behind aggressive be-
haviour, hate speech or trolling. Chen et al. (2012)

proposed a Lexical Syntactic Feature architecture
to bridge the gap between detecting offensive con-
tent and potential offensive users in social media,
arguing that although existing methods treat mes-
sages as independent instances, the focus should
be on the source of the content. Waseem and Hovy
(2016) stated that among various extra-linguistic
features, only gender brought improvements to
hate speech detection. Papegnies et al. (2017)
mention a plan to use context-based features for
abuse detection, and especially those based on
the networks of user interactions. Several authors
share this intention, but face the challenge that
user information often is limited or unavailable.

Wulczyn et al. (2017) qualitatively analyzed
personal attacks in Wikipedia comments, showing
that anonymity increases the likelihood of a com-
ment being an attack, although anonymous com-
ments only contributed to less than half of the
total attacks. The study also suggested that per-
sonal attacks cluster in time, which may be be-
cause one attack triggers another. In another qual-
itative analysis, Cheng et al. (2015) characterized
forms of antisocial behaviour in online discussion
communities, comparing the activity of users that
have been permanently banned from a community
to those that are not banned. The study found
the banned users to use less positive words and
more profanity, and to concentrate their efforts in
a small amount of threads. They also receive more
replies and responses than other users.

Hardaker (2010) defined a troller as a user who
appears to sincerely wish to be part of a group,
including professing, or conveying pseudo-sincere
intentions, but whose real intentions are to cause
disruption or to trigger conflict for the purposes
of their own amusement. Buckels et al. (2014)
studied the characteristic traits of Internet trolls
by looking at commenting styles and personal-
ity inventories, and found strong positive relations
among commenting frequency, trolling enjoyment
and trolling behaviour and identity. Cheng et al.
(2017) proposed that an individual’s mood and
seeing troll posts by others trigger troll behaviour.

Most similar to the objectives of the present
work, Chatzakou et al. (2017) investigated user
features that can be utilized to enhance the de-
tection and classification of bullying and aggres-
sive behaviour of Twitter users. They found that
network-based features (such as the number of
friends and followers, reciprocity and the position

in the network) were particularly useful and effec-
tive in classifying aggressive user behaviour.

3 Data Analysis

Creating datasets of hate speech is time consum-
ing, as the number of hateful instances in online
communities is relatively low. The datasets avail-
able are also often created for different tasks, and
from different types of media and languages, and
therefore vary in characteristics and types of hate
speech. Sources include Twitter (Waseem and
Hovy, 2016; Fortuna, 2017; Ross et al., 2016),
Wikipedia (Wulczyn et al., 2017), and Fox News
(Gao and Huang, 2017). Furthermore, many
datasets (from Yahoo, SpaceOrigin and Twitter)
are not publicly available (Djuric et al., 2015; No-
bata et al., 2016; Papegnies et al., 2017; Chatzakou
et al., 2017), while others are available only under
some restrictions (Davidson et al., 2017; Golbeck
et al., 2017). This may be due to privacy issues or
considering the content of the datasets: Pavlopou-
los et al. (2017) made their Greek Gazzetta dataset
available by using an encryptor to avoid directly
publishing hate speech content.

Here, three datasets were used to investigate
the characteristics of users for increased insight
and to allow comparisons of the findings. All
datasets have Twitter as their source, ensuring that
the same information could be retrieved. However,
the datasets differ in terms of annotations, size and
characteristics, and come from three different lan-
guages: English (Waseem and Hovy, 2016), Por-
tuguese (Fortuna, 2017), and German (Ross et al.,
2016). The datasets contain tweet IDs that can be
used to retrieve the actual text, information about
the tweet or information about the user who has
posted it. As user information is something that
should be handled with care, it is important to
mention that no attempt was made to directly iden-
tify the actual users.

Tweet IDs may become unavailable, either by
the tweet having been deleted, or if the user who
posted the tweet has become suspended or has
deleted their account. Therefore, a review of the
availability of the tweets in all datasets was con-
ducted prior to the investigation of characteristics,
and will be described first below, before going into
details of the analysis of the user characteristics in
the three datasets. The statistics of the actually
available tweets and posting users in the datasets
as included in this work are shown in Table 1.

3.1 Datasets
The English dataset by Waseem and Hovy (2016)
is publicly available on GitHub.1 The Twitter
search API was used to collect the corpus, and in
total 16,907 tweets (from 2,399 users) were anno-
tated either as racist, sexist or neither. The dataset
contains more instances of neutral than racist or
sexist tweets. This unbalance was intended by the
developers, to make the corpus more representa-
tive of the real world, where hate speech is a lim-
ited phenomenon. Since the dataset was devel-
oped in 2016, the Python library Tweepy was used
here to filter out any unavailable tweets and users.
Furthermore, the original “Sexism” and “Racism”
classes were merged into one “Hate speech” class.
1,180 of the original tweets were no longer avail-
able, which also impacted the number of users in
the dataset. The remaining tweets and users are
presented in Table 1, in the ‘ENG’ column.

Fortuna (2017) developed a dataset consisting
of 5,668 Portuguese tweets and made it available
through the INESC TEC research data repository.2

Tweets were collected through the Twitter API
with searches based on keywords related to hate
speech and Twitter profiles known for posting hate
messages. Fortuna aimed to have a higher pro-
portion of hate speech messages than other related
datasets, and 22% of the tweets were annotated as
hate speech. She annotated nine direct hate speech
sub-classes, but in the present work those will be
merged into one hate speech class. In total there
are 5,668 annotated tweets by 1,156 distinct users;
however, the distribution of users within the tar-
get classes was not specified. Today, close to half
of the tweets in both classes are unavailable; how-
ever, as shown in the ‘POR’ column of Table 1,
there are still 1,010 users available, meaning that
the unavailability of tweets did not heavily affect
the number of users. While the original dataset
had a binary value for the presence of hate speech
and subcategories as labels, the target classes were
here changed to “Hate speech” and “None”.

2rdm.inesctec.pt/dataset/cs-2017-008

To investigate the issue of reliability concerning
hate speech annotation, Ross et al. (2016) com-
piled a German hate speech corpus with tweets
linked to the refugee crisis in Europe. By using
known insulting or offensive hashtags, a total of
13,766 tweets were collected, 469 of which were
annotated by two annotators for presence or ab-
sence of hate speech. In Table 1 the column ‘GER’
shows the availability of the tweets in the dataset
and the number of users in each target class. It
was beneficial to transform the labels of the dataset
into binary classes, to equal the labelling of the
other datasets. Therefore, a tweet that was la-
belled “Yes” by one or both of the annotators was
assigned to the “Hate speech” class. Hence, the
“Hate speech” class consists of 65 available tweets
labelled as hate speech by one annotator, and 33
labelled hate speech by both annotators.

3.2 Characteristics

A quantitative analysis was conducted to better
understand the characteristics of the users in the
datasets, based on the proposed features in Sec-
tion 2 and other information about the user avail-
able through the Twitter API. All datasets included
several tweets from the same users; tweets that
then can be present in both target classes. How-
ever, to better distinguish between users and avoid
redundancy in the analysis, users who are present
in both target classes are here only included as
users within the “Hate speech” class.

Gender: Twitter does not require users to reg-
ister their gender, so no explicit gender field is
retrievable through the Twitter API. Finding the
gender distribution for users in the dataset is there-
fore challenging. Waseem and Hovy (2016) inves-
tigated the distributions of gender in their origi-
nal dataset through extracting gender information
by looking up usernames and names in the user
profiles, and then comparing these to known male
or female given names. A similar approach was
used here, by incorporating lists of common inter-
national, Portuguese, German, and English names.
In addition, the user descriptions were also con-
sidered, as users often give a more detailed de-
scription there of who they are, e.g., “I am a mom
of three boys”. A risk with this approach is that
names or descriptions may mistakenly be classi-
fied as the wrong gender, and therefore the gender
findings may not be entirely accurate. Names that
can be both female and male have been avoided.

Figure 1: Gender distribution of users in the datasets: blue = male, green = female, beige = unidentified

Waseem and Hovy (2016) expressed that the
gender of about half the users could not be iden-
tified by their approach, and that the male gender
was over-represented in all categories. Figure 1a
presents the gender distribution derived here, with
significant differences to their findings. In par-
ticular, the female users are identified to a much
larger degree, with the distribution of male, fe-
male and unidentified users being more equal; the
fraction of unidentified users has decreased from
50% to 36%. Still, a higher amount of male users
are identified than female, which is also the case
for the dataset by Ross et al. (2016). In contrast,
the gender distribution derived from the dataset by
Fortuna (2017) shows a majority of the identified
user genders to be female. In that dataset there is
also a large number of unidentified genders (55%),
which is equal to the number of unidentified users
in the dataset by Ross et al. (2016).

User Network: The user networks are defined
here as their social networks on Twitter, i.e., who
a user follows (called ‘following’ or ‘friends’ on
Twitter) and who follows that user (‘followers’).
Chatzakou et al. (2017) found network-based fea-
tures to be very useful in classifying aggressive
user behaviour. They investigated features such

as the ratio of followers to friends, the extent to
which users reciprocate the follow connections
they receive from others, and the users’ tendency
to cluster with others.

In Figure 2a, the relationship between a user’s
friends and followers in the dataset by Waseem
and Hovy (2016) is illustrated. The majority of
users form a cluster in the area below 10,000
friends and 50,000 following. Beyond this cluster,
it appears as users of the “None” class are most
common, with the exception of one outlier of the
“Hate speech” class with about 228,00 followers
and no friends. It is difficult to say whether this
trend can be generalized, or is caused by the un-
even number of users in the two target classes.

Figure 2b shows the distribution of friends and
followers for the users in the dataset by Fortuna
(2017). A general observation is that the users
of this dataset often tend to have more followers
than friends. Furthermore, there is little that dis-
tinguishes the users of the two classes regarding
the number of friends and followers. The number
of users in the dataset by Ross et al. (2016) is con-
siderably lower than the other datasets, and may
explain the lower number of friends and follow-
ers for the users, as shown in Figure 2c. There is

Figure 3: Distribution of users based on activity (number of favourites given vs number of status updates)

an outlier in the “Hate speech” class with about
13,000 followers and 14,000 friends, but the rest
of the users are somewhat evenly distributed.

Activity: Previous research suggests that both
high and low activity levels can be related to post-
ing hate speech content. Buckels et al. (2014)
found commenting frequency to be positively as-
sociated with trolling enjoyment and Cheng et al.
(2015) suggested that frequently active users are
often associated with anti-social behaviour online.
In contrast, Wulczyn et al. (2017) found users that
launched personal attacks on Wikipedia regardless
of activity level. Here, activity is defined by the in-
formation that can be extracted through the Twitter
API. Tweepy enables the retrieval of the number
of tweets a user has posted (also known as ‘status
updates’ on Twitter) and the number of ‘favorites’
they have given to tweets by others (corresponding
to ‘likes’ in other online media).

In Figure 3 the relationship between a user’s
number of favourites given and total number of
statuses is illustrated, showing that there is a gen-
eral tendency to have a larger number of status
updates than favourites. With the exception of
one outlier in the “Hate speech” class with over
400,000 favourites and over 600,000 statuses, the
majority of users in both classes of the English
dataset form a cluster below 50,000 favourites and
200,000 statuses. In the Portuguese dataset, the
users of both target classes are somewhat evenly
distributed, and in general the users of this dataset
have posted below 200,000 tweets and given be-
low 25,000 favourites. The number of status up-
dates and the number of favourites for the users
in the German dataset are much lower than in the
other datasets, and similarly to the findings inves-
tigating the users’ network, there is no clear dis-
tinction between the activity characteristics of the
users in the target classes.

Table 2: User profile characteristics (%)

User Profile: Twitter enables users to customize
their profile pages, e.g., by changing theme colour,
or by adding a profile or header picture. In addi-
tion, users can add a bio description, a geograph-
ical location or a web page link. Wulczyn et al.
(2017) found personal attacks to be more preva-
lent among anonymous users than registered users.
Therefore the elements of a user’s profile that can
be personalized were examined with the under-
lying assumption that personalizing the profile is
contradicting to remaining anonymity. The ele-
ments retrieved were the number of public lists a
user has joined, geotagging of tweets, the profile
image, and whether or not the user has altered a
default theme or background of the profile.

The users in the English data are somewhat
equally divided between enabling and disabling
of geotagging for both target classes, as seen in
Table 2. The distribution is similar for the geo-
tagging characteristic of users in the Portuguese
data. However, the majority in both target classes
in the German data have disabled geotagging, with
a slightly higher percentage for the users in the
“Hate speech” class. There is a tendency of the
users in the English and Portuguese datasets to
rather have a customized profile page than a stan-
dard, while the German data is more evenly dis-
tributed. Nearly all the users in the three datasets
have changed their profile image. For all the
datasets, the percentage of changed profile images
is also marginally higher for the users in the “Hate
speech” class than the users in the “None” class.

4 Classification Setup

The analysis of the datasets presented in the previ-
ous section indicated that none of the investigated
user characteristics could be clearly used to dif-
ferentiate textual tweets annotated “Hate speech”
and “None”. However, the impact of user features
in detection may become more visible when tested
through a classifier. To investigate the possible ef-
fects user features have on the performance of hate
speech classification, a baseline hate speech classi-
fier was implemented and trained only on the tex-
tual tweets from the datasets, and then compared
to a classifier that also incorporated user features.
Along with observing the overall effects of user
feature inclusion, the impacts of the individual fea-
tures and feature subsets were investigated.

A basic hate speech classifier needs to include
preprocessing of the textual input, feature extrac-
tion, and a choice of actual classification model.
These will be addressed in turn below, while clas-
sification results will be given in the next section.

Preprocessing: Text processing is a difficult
task due to the noise contained in language and
should be done with care, to avoid losing any im-
portant features. This is particularly proliferent
in social media such as Twitter, which also intro-
duces domain-specific challenges: the character
limit in a tweet increases the use of abbreviations,
while including non-textual content (e.g., URLs,
images, user mentions and retweets) is common.

The Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al.,
2009) was used for preprocessing of the data,
through: (i) removal of Twitter specific informa-
tion (user mentions, emoticons, retweets, URLs,
and hashtag symbols; only retaining textual con-
tent), (ii) tokenization, (iii) lowercasing, and (iv)
stop word removal (with different stop word lists
for the datasets, due to the different languages).

Feature Extraction and Representation: Hav-
ing found many tweets to be annotated racist due
to the appearance of offensive words, Kwok and
Wang (2013) constructed a vocabulary using uni-
gram features only. However, this fails to cap-
ture relationships between words, so Nobata et al.
(2016) added syntactic features, while also em-
ploying n-grams and distributional semantic de-
rived features. They found combining all fea-
tures to yield the best performance, but character
n-grams made the largest individual feature con-
tribution. Mehdad and Tetreault (2016) specifi-

cally investigated character-based approaches and
showed them to be superior to token-based ap-
proaches and other state-of-the-art methods.

Since n-grams thus have been shown to be very
useful in hate speech classification, both character
n-grams and word n-grams were tested here to rep-
resent the textual content of the tweets. A TF-IDF
approach was used to represent the n-gram fea-
tures, and ranges up to n=6 tested. Higher values
of n were not considered due to the computational
effort required. The most suitable type of n-gram
and n-gram range were explored through a grid
search, and finding different alternatives for rep-
resenting the tweets suiting the different datasets.

Classification Model: Supervised machine
learning classifiers have been the most frequently
used approaches to hate speech detection, in
particular Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
Logistic Regression (LR). Davidson et al. (2017)
found LR and linear SVM to perform better than
other models, such as Naı̈ve Bayes, Decision
Trees, and Random Forests. A comparative
study performed by Burnap and Williams (2015)
concluded that an ensemble method seemed
most promising. Deep learning methods have
also been investigated, both Recurrent Neural
Networks (Pavlopoulos et al., 2017; Mehdad and
Tetreault, 2016), Convolutional Neural Networks
(Gambäck and Sikdar, 2017), and combinations
(Zhang et al., 2018). Badjatiya et al. (2017)
used various deep learning architectures to learn
semantic words embeddings and showed these to
outperform character and word n-grams.

Here a Logistic Regression model was chosen
due to its simplicity and its common usage in lan-
guage classification. This is also in line with the
note by Gröndahl et al. (2018) that a simple LR
model performed on par with more complex mod-
els in their comparison of hate speech detection
classifiers. As the aim here was not to implement
the best performing classifier or to compare meth-
ods, but to investigate the effects of user features,
no other classification models were tested.

5 Experiments and Results

The datasets were initially split into training data
and test data to ensure that the model performance
was evaluated on unseen data. A grid search with
10-fold cross-validation over the training data was
used for selecting model parameters. The classi-
fication model with the chosen hyperparameters

Table 4: Baseline model performance on test data

was then evaluated on the test set. This section
first presents results from baseline classification
with only n-gram features, and then discusses the
effects of incorporating user features.

5.1 Classifier with Text Features
The dataset provided by Waseem and Hovy (2016)
contained 15,727 available English tweets, that
were split into a training set of 11,008 tweets and
a test set containing 4,719 tweets, of which 3,275
were classified as non-hate speech. A grid search
found that character n-grams in range [1,5] pro-
vided the best performance, as shown in the col-
umn ‘ENG’ in Table 3. Table 4 shows the per-
formance metrics of the model, where 0.83 was
the macro average F1-score. Both the precision
and recall values are higher for the “None” class.
However, the recall value for the “Hate speech”
class obtained for this dataset is higher than for
the other datasets, most probably due to the larger
amount of available training data.

3,059 tweets from the Portuguese dataset by
Fortuna (2017) were used, with the training set
containing 2,636 tweets and the test set 423, of
which 126 were annotated as hate speech. Word
unigrams yielded the best performance (Table 3),
and the macro average F1-score obtained for the
test data was 0.79 (Table 4). The precision ob-
tained for “Hate speech” is slightly higher than for
the “None” class, while the recall is much lower.

The German dataset by Ross et al. (2016) is
considerably smaller than the other datasets, con-
taining only 341 tweets, that were split into a train-

A grid search of the n-gram parameters (‘GER’ in
Table 3) showed a character n-gram with the range
[1,2] produced the best 10-fold cross validation re-
sults on the training data. On the unseen test data,
this model received a macro average F1-score of
0.65 (Table 4), with the score severely hampered
by the classifier only being able to identify 3% of
the instances of the “Hate speech” class. This is
most likely due to small the size of the dataset,
resulting in an insufficient amount of training in-
stances. Notably, Ross et al. (2016) did not de-
velop this dataset primarily for classification, but
for investigating hate speech annotation reliabil-
ity. Their study concluded that the presence of
hate speech perhaps should not be considered a bi-
nary yer-or-no decision; however, this is how the
current classification model is operating.

5.2 Classifier with Text and User Features
In the second part of the experiments, the classi-
fier was expanded to incorporate various user fea-
tures and subsets. Four types of in total ten fea-
tures were experimented with:

Gender: male and female,
Network: number of followers and friends,
Activity: number of statuses and favourites,
Profile: geo enabled, default profile, default

image, and number of public lists,
where the “number of” features are integer valued,
while all the other features are binary (boolean).

Table 5 repeats the performance of the baseline
model (n-grams only, in row 1) and then shows n-
grams along with various subsets of user features.
Including all user features yielded the largest im-
provement over the baseline on the Waseem and
Hovy (2016) dataset, with the ‘Network’ feature
subset making the largest difference. ‘Gender’ did
not improve performance at all, while ‘Activity’
and ‘Profile’ provided very slight improvements.
Each individual feature was also tested along with

(a) English (Waseem and Hovy, 2016) (b) Portuguese (Fortuna, 2017) (c) German (Ross et al., 2016)

n-grams, as shown in Figure 4a. Half of the fea-
tures had no impact on performance; ‘Default pro-
file’ and ‘Geo enabled’ increased F1 by 0.1, while
‘Female’, ‘Followers’ and ‘Public lists’ had the
most impact, increasing F1 by 0.2.

The incorporation of all user features on the
Fortuna (2017) dataset resulted in a slightly wors-
ened performance. This was also the case for
inclusion of the ‘Activity’ subset, while includ-
ing ‘Network’ improved performance. ‘Gender’
and ‘Profile’ made no major impact on the scores.
Of the individual features, ‘Followers’ and ‘Geo
enabled’ resulted in the largest F1-score increase
when used in combination with n-gram features,
as shown in Figure 4b. In addition, the inclusion of
‘Public lists’ also slightly improved the F1-score.
Interestingly, the inclusion of ‘Statuses’ actually
worsened model performance.

By only using word unigrams, the baseline clas-
sifier only received a recall value of 0.03 for the
hate speech class of the dataset by Ross et al.
(2016), as shown in Table 4. Looking at Table 5,
we see that the ‘Gender’, ‘Activity’ and ‘Profile’
feature subsets resulted in improvements of the av-
erage F1-score. The inclusion of all the features

and the ‘Network’ subset had no effect on the aver-
age F1 score. The inclusion of ‘Activity’ increased
the F1 by 0.02, ‘Gender’ increased it by 0.04, and
‘Profile’ had the largest impact by increasing F1
by 0.06. These results are consistent with the test-
ing of the individual features shown in Figure 4c,
where ‘Male’, ‘Female’ and ‘Profile’ have a large
impact on performance. However, the ‘Statuses’,
‘Favourites’, and ‘Public lists’ had the largest im-
provement by 0.4. Of the individual features in-
cluded, only ‘Geo Enabled’ lead to a decreased F1
score over the baseline.

The results are notably affected by the uneven
distribution of instances in the target classes, as
shown by significantly lower F1-scores for “Hate
speech” than “None” for all datasets. This was re-
flected clearly by a closer comparison of classi-
fier output for the English data with n-grams and
with all user features (i.e., the setup which yielded
the best classifier performance on this dataset):
the number of correctly labelled “Hate speech”
instances increased from 623 to 1,048 (of 1,444)
while the correctly labelled “None” instances de-
creased slightly, from 3,111 to 3,000 (of 3,275), as
illustrated by the confusion matrices in Figure 5.

A similar pattern was observed also for the
German data, for which the optimal classifier
setup was to include the ‘Profile’ feature subset.
However, for Portuguese where the best classifier
utilised only the ‘Network’ user features, Figure 6
shows that adding those features produced a de-
crease of correctly labelled “Hate speech” (from
60 to 56 of 116) with marginally increased cor-
rectly labelled “None” instances (from 285 to 286
of 297), possibly since data sparsity made the
model interpret the added features as noise.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

There are several challenges linked to the detec-
tion of harmful online behaviour, such as detec-
tion beyond simply recognising offensive words.
Aiming to address this gap, the paper investigated
the potential and effects of including user features
in hate speech classification, focusing on Twitter.
A quantitative analysis of three datasets in three
different languages indicated that there were no
particular characteristics distinguishing the users
who have had tweets annotated as hate speech and
those who have seemingly not.

However, systematically incorporating the user
features into a Logistic Regression-based hate
speech classifier in conjunction with word and
character n-gram features allowed observations of
the effects of individual features and feature sub-
sets. Experimental results showed that the inclu-
sion of specific user features, in addition to n-
grams, caused a slight improvement of the base-
line classifier performance.

Of all individually tested feature subsets, ‘Net-
work’ (i.e., the number of followers and friends)
caused the largest improvement of the classi-
fier performance on the English and Portuguese
datasets, corroborating the findings of Chatzakou
et al. (2017) that network-based features are pow-
erful for detecting aggressive behaviour. This sub-
set improvement may have been affected by the
individual feature (number of) ‘Followers’, which
also increased the F1-score on the two datasets.
The other features had inconsistent effects on the
different datasets, suggesting that the impact is
highly dependent on the data or the subtask the
data was created for. The experiments also found
the inclusion of some user features to be detrimen-
tal to model performance, while some user fea-
tures were ineffective alone, but improved model
performance when combined with others.

Interestingly, the ‘Gender’ feature subset
mainly failed to give any F1-score improvements,
in contrast to the result by Waseem and Hovy
(2016). While other user features are easily re-
trievable through the Twitter API, user gender was
derived from a comparative method, classifying
more users by gender than in the work by Waseem
and Hovy. However, also the method used here is
still unable to identify the gender of a large amount
of users in all datasets, so combinations with other
gender identification methods would be needed to
properly investigate the impact gender has in hate
speech detection. As of now, it can be argued that
gender is not a useful feature to include, at least
where it cannot be directly extracted.

One limitation of using several datasets is that
they were developed for different subtasks and
languages, with different geographical areas of the
users in the datasets, and in particular with differ-
ent interpretations and annotations of hate speech.
However, the main difference of the datasets is the
size and hence number of instances available for
model training, which probably is the main reason
for the different results. Still, the results combine
to show a potential for incorporating user features
to improve hate speech detection performance.

There is a great amount of information related
to the users of Twitter that was not used in the ex-
periments, but that could be retrieved or derived
from user behaviour. Examples include consider-
ing the time of tweeting, investigations of relation-
ships with other users, communication with other
users, and what content users are exposed to. It is
in general important to not only consider who the
users are or what they have written, but also their
context and how they are affected by surround-
ing factors in their online communities, as well as
combinations of those issues, since what can be
considered as hate speech by one user in a specific
context may be considered as non-hate speech if
written by another user or in another context.
