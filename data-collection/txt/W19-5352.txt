Abstract

As the quality of machine translation rises and
neural machine translation (NMT) is moving
from sentence to document level translations,
it is becoming increasingly difficult to evaluate
the output of translation systems.

We provide a test suite for WMT19 aimed at
assessing discourse phenomena of MT sys-
tems participating in the News Translation
Task. We have manually checked the outputs
and identified types of translation errors that
are relevant to document-level translation.

1 Introduction

Currently, the level of machine translation sys-
tems can be very good or excellent. For some
languages, the systems are on par with humans
when evaluated at the level of individual sen-
tences, see Hassan et al. (2018) for Chinese-to-
English and Bojar et al. (2018) for English-to-
Czech translation at WMT18. The main criterion
for distinguishing MT systems’ quality thus has to
shift from evaluating individual sentences to larger
units. Ideally, the translated text should be now
evaluated as a whole.

We believe that the fundamental criterion of the
quality of manual or automatic translation is the
extent to which the translation is functional in hu-
man communication. These days, the critical ba-
sic level in this criterion has been already reached
by multiple machine translation systems covering
a wide range of language pairs. While the reader
of an automatically translated text may be grop-
ing at some points in the text, the overall quality
of the translation is already so high that the main
content of the text and the author’s communicative
intention is mostly conveyed.

Still, the reader of an MT output takes a higher
effort to understand the translated text. For ex-
ample, morphological errors, shortcomings in the

word order, incorrect syntactic relations, failure in
translating terminology, or the choice of inappro-
priate synonyms can hinder the speed and accu-
racy of text understanding.

In this paper, we first provide a test suite
for WMT19 aimed at assessing translation qual-
ity of English to Czech NMT systems regarding
document-level language phenomena. As qualita-
tive analyses of document-level errors in MT out-
puts are up-to-date quite rare, this paper further
aims at identification, manual annotation and lin-
guistic description of these types of errors relevant
to English-Czech NMT and a comparison of per-
formance of the submitted systems in the given ar-
eas. We compare NMT systems that translate one
sentence at a time with systems that have more
than one sentence on input and therefore have po-
tential to translate document-level phenomena bet-
ter.

After an overview of detected translation er-
rors from various levels of language description,
the paper zooms in on three document-level, or
coherence-related, phenomena: topic-focus artic-
ulation (information structure), discourse connec-
tives and alternative lexicalizations of connec-
tives.1 We assume that translation systems might
have difficulties with these phenomena, as they are
related to the previous context and go beyond (or
are affected by the phenomena across) the sen-
tence boundary. In this way, they contribute to
the overall coherence of the text that should (as a
whole) function as an independent unit of human
communication.

1This work does not address in detail errors in corefer-
ence, pronoun and gender translation, as these phenomena
have been already widely accounted for, e.g. Guillou et al.
(2016); Novák (2016).

2 Data

The evaluations in this paper are conducted on
a selection of 101 documents from the paral-
lel Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
(PCEDT, Hajič et al. (2012)), and we also used
discourse annotations of the same texts in the Penn
Discourse Treebank 3.0 (PDTB, for details see
Webber et al. (2019)).

2.1 Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank

The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
is a parallel corpus consisting of English original
texts and their Czech translations. The PCEDT
contains 1.2 million running words in almost
50,000 sentences in each part.

The English texts come from the Penn Tree-
bank (Wall Street Journal Section; Marcus et al.,
1993). They were manually translated into Czech
by trained linguists without any support of MT
and proofread. The PCEDT is manually an-
notated on the tectogrammatical (deep-syntactic)
layer in both languages. The sentences are repre-
sented by dependency structures of content words.
The nodes in the tree structures are provided
with syntactico-semantic labels as, e.g., predi-
cate, actor, patiens, addressee or locative. Also,
the valency frames of verbs (argument structure)
are captured, as well as elliptical structures and
anaphoric relations.

In addition, the Czech part is automatically
tagged and parsed as surface-syntactic depen-
dency trees on the analytical layer. The English
part also preserves the original phrase-structure
annotation of the Penn Treebank. Also, the anno-
tation of discourse relations, connectives and Al-
tlexes from the Penn Discourse Treebank was ex-
tracted and added to our PCEDT dataset.

3 NMT Systems

We evaluated 5 NMT systems from those partic-
ipating in WMT19 in English-to-Czech transla-
tion. In particular, we selected those of the highest
quality as estimated by automatic scoring at ma-
trix.statmt.org.2

CUNI-Transf-2018 is last year submission
by Popel (2018). It is a neural machine transla-
tion model based on the Transformer architecture

2http://matrix.statmt.org/matrix/
systems_list/1896

and trained on parallel and back-translated mono-
lingual data. It translates one sentence at a time.
CUNI-DocTransf-T2T is a Transformer

model following Popel (2018), but trained on
WMT19 document-level parallel and monolin-
gual data. During decoding, each document
was split into overlapping multi-sentence seg-
ments, where only the “middle” sentences in
each segment are used for the final transla-
tion. CUNI-Transf-T2T is the same system as
CUNI-DocTransf-T2T, just applied on sepa-
rate sentences during decoding.
CUNI-DocTransf-Marian is document-

level trained Transformer in Marian frame-
work following Popel (2018), but finetuned on
document-level parallel and monolingual data by
translating triples of adjacent sentences at once.
If possible, only the middle sentence is consid-
ered for the final translation hypothesis, otherwise
a double or single sentence context is used.
Online-B is an anonymized online system

which we know also from several previous years
of WMT.
Reference is the Czech side of the PCEDT

corpus.

4 Annotation Design

The 101 PCEDT documents selected for transla-
tion and manual evaluation belong to the “essay”
and “letter” genre labels according to the classifi-
cation of PDTB given in Webber (2009). At the
same time, the selected texts have a length of 20–
50 sentences. These documents were submitted
as an additional test suite for Machine Transla-
tion of News shared task at the WMT 2019. Be-
cause we are interested in document-level transla-
tion and the effect of context on the translation, we
only selected documents with cross-sentence dis-
course relations.

We have created a simple annotation interface
(see Figure 1), which allows the annotator to mark
the items that were translated correctly.

Specifically, several types of cross-sentence dis-
course relations are considered on the source side
(reusing the annotations available in the Penn Dis-
course Treebank 3.0).

The target side was validated by trained lin-
guists. For each of the observed connectives / Al-
tLex, the annotators indicated whether:
(1) the given expression/phrase in the source ful-
fills the function of a connective – according to the

annotator, or the function of AltLex – according to
the original English annotation displayed. If yes,
then whether its Czech translation is (2):

• adequate and correctly placed,3
• adequate but incorrectly placed,
• omitted and it does not harm the output
• omitted and it harms the output
• not adequate.

The questionnaire for word order annotation is
analogous, compare the description of tables with
results below in Section 7. The original translation
into Czech from PCEDT could serve as a reference
translation but similarly to Bojar et al. (2018), we
opted for a bilingual evaluation, showing the anno-
tators always the source and the candidate transla-
tion. The benefit is that the human translation can
be evaluated using the same criteria as the MT sys-
tem outputs.

There were 6 annotators, all of them students
of linguistics. Each annotator evaluated 8 docu-
ments in the first round. For each document, they

3for Altlexes: and preserves the original discourse mean-
ing

evaluated the output of one MT system (without
knowing which MT system produced the output).
To measure the inter-annotator agreement, we or-
ganized a second round of evaluation, where each
annotator was given documents and systems com-
bination that was in the first round evaluated by
another annotator. Details on the IAA are given in
Section 7.

5 Linguistic Analysis of Translations
Errors across Language Levels

We carried out a complex linguistic analysis of
a sample of the translated texts and revealed that
even the best translations contained cca 15–20 lin-
guistic issues (per text of 35 sentences). This
means that although the content reliability and lin-
guistic level of (the best) MT systems is very high,
they still do not reach communication skills of hu-
mans. This fact may be challenging for their au-
thors, as there are still possibilities for improve-
ment. However, a systematic improvement of MT
systems is rather difficult due to non-systematic
nature of language errors found in the analysis –
e.g. if there appeared an untypical word order in a



458

sentence, it does not mean that word order errors
are also present in the rest of the translated text. It
turned out, on the contrary, that the errors / prob-
lematic issues appear individually, as singularities.

In the following part, we discuss the problem-
atic places in a sample of translated texts. We tried
to select the best or (at least) good MT systems to
demonstrate that even in such an advanced transla-
tion, there are still issues requiring improvement.

5.1 Morphology
We were able to detect errors from various lev-
els of language description. Some problematic
issues concerned even such basic phenomena as
e.g. the use of a verbal mood or other morpholog-
ical issues (It’s as if France decided to give only
French history questions to students in a Euro-
pean history class, and when everybody aces the
test, they say their kids are good in European his-
tory – Je to, jako by se Francie rozhodla dávat
studentům evropských hodin dějepisu jen otázky
z francouzštiny, a když všichni v testu excelujı́,
řı́kajı́, že jejich děti jsou v evropských dějinách
dobré; the Czech translation is not consistent
in maintaining potentiality: the intended content
should be translated into Czech as: jako kdyby se
Francie..., a až by všichni v textu excelovali, řekli
by...) with the obligatory conditional morpheme
by, also as a part of the conjunction kdyby, used in
past (unreal) conditions.

5.2 Lexicon
Other issues concerned the choice of vocabulary.
The individual translations included e.g. inap-
propriate repetition of the same word (ie. the
MT systems produced a non-natural output by
not attempting to use a synonym, cf. in test-
coaching workbooks and worksheets — v pra-
covnı́ch sešitech a pracovnı́ch sešitech “in test-
coaching workbooks and in test-coaching work-
books”). In some of them, there also appeared in-
correct literal translations of terms (cf. a joint ven-
ture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan’s par-
entt, Britain’s Maxwell Communication Corp –
společným podnikem McGraw-Hill Inc. a Macmil-
lanovým rodičem, britskou společnostı́ Maxwell
Communication Corp).

Another lexical issue was the use of an inac-
curate synonym in a given context (cf. but he
doesn’t deny that some items are similar – ale
nepopı́rá, že některé předměty jsou podobné; the
word předměty may be a synonym to the original

items but not in this context, the Czech word here
means rather tangible objects).

Generally, the MT systems succeed in translat-
ing basic words or phrases but sometimes they fail
in translating terms or technical words and in lex-
ical variety (often resulting in word repetition and
failure to use an appropriate synonym).

5.3 Syntax
The translations also exhibit signs of incorrect
syntactic relations, e.g. excessive genitive ac-
cumulation, which is untypical for Czech (cf.
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers’
binders have also been sold in the past four years.
– Asi 20 000 souborů (Noun in Gen) učebnı́ch
materiálů (NP in Gen) učitelských pořadačů (NP
in Gen) bylo také prodáno v poslednı́ch čtyřech
letech.). Another typical syntactic error appears
in translation of syntactically potentially homony-
mous phrases, as in the example above in 5.1 the
phrase European history class, translated wrongly
as evropských hodin dějepisu (European classes of
history).

Also, a large problematic area was revealed
in word order configurations. Some translations
contained the word order adopted from English,
where it is untypical or even incorrect in Czech.
This issue is related to sentence information struc-
ture or topic-focus articulation, as the word or-
der is connected with contextual boundness (cf.
. . . says ”well over 10 million” of its Scoring High
test-preparation books have been sold since their
introduction 10 years ago – uvádı́, že “vı́ce než
10 milionů” jeho testovacı́ch knih Scoring High
se prodalo od jejich zavedenı́ před 10 lety; the
expression “vı́ce než 10 milionů” is the focus of
the sentence and therefore it should be placed in
the final position in Czech). Similar issue (con-
cerning topic-focus articulation) may be observed
in the sentence Scoring High and Learning Ma-
terials are the best-selling preparation tests. –
Scoring High and Learning Materials jsou ne-
jprodávanějšı́ přı́pravné testy. Again, the expres-
sion Scoring High and Learning Materials should
be (as focus proper of the sentence) placed in the
final sentence position in Czech.

5.4 Semantics
Semantic issues (to a certain extent) are already
partly included in the incorrect translations of
terms as discussed above. Other are related es-
pecially to factual inaccuracy, e.g. the expression



459

French history questions was incorrectly trans-
lated as otázky z francouzštiny “questions from
French”.

In some cases, even a whole part of the orig-
inal text was completely omitted in the transla-
tion – the meaning of the sentence was thus nega-
tively affected (. . . and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc.’s Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stan-
ford Achievement Test – . . . a Harcourt Brace Jo-
vanovich).

5.5 Discourse

Further issues in translations also appeared on
higher levels of language description, crossing
the sentence boundary and mostly affecting text
understanding as a whole. These discourse-
related phenomena include especially corefer-
ence and discourse (semantico-pragmatic) rela-
tions, largely expressed by discourse connectives
or their paraphrases (AltLexes). A detailed analy-
sis of discourse-related translation errors is given
below in Section 6.1.

6 Linguistic Analysis of Selected
Document-Level Errors

6.1 Selected coherence phenomena

A comprehensive linguistic analysis of a sample
of translated texts showed that even the best trans-
lations are not completely error-free (the best ones
contained about 15–20 errors per text). These er-
rors were further analyzed – they appear across
individual levels of language description. Unfor-
tunately, the main common feature of the errors
seems to be the fact that they are not systematic.
The key to a good distinction of translation qual-
ity is thus their complex linguistic analysis. For
the annotation, we have chosen three document-
level types of the errors discovered in the output
analysis, namely those concerning topic-focus ar-
ticulation, discourse connectives and the mean-
ings they convey and alternative lexicalizations
of connectives (AltLexes). The annotators then
assessed them on a larger sample of translated data
from all the systems and the reference translation.
The finding are analyzed linguistically in the rest
of this Section and quantitatively below in Sec-
tion 7.

6.1.1 Topic-focus articulation and word
order

First, we observed the phenomenon of topic-focus
articulation (we follow this phenomenon as pre-
sented within the Functional Generative Descrip-
tion, see Sgall (1967) or Sgall et al. (1986)). In our
experiment, we took advantage of the fact that En-
glish and Czech have a different word order sys-
tem in combination with topic-focus articulation
and contextual boundness.4 While English has a
fixed word order, strongly influenced by grammar,
Czech has a free word order mainly influenced by
the contextual boundness of individual sentence
constituents. It is thus necessary to harmonize the
word order in a Czech sentence always with re-
spect to the previous (con)text.

In the annotation of the translated texts, we fo-
cused on the word order of the subject. While the
subject is typically at the beginning of the sen-
tence in English, it can occupy various positions
in Czech, depending on whether it is contextually
bound or not. We were wondering how individual
MT-systems reflect this word order issue.

We automatically selected English original sen-
tences from the PCEDT that contained a noun
used with an indefinite article in the subject posi-
tion and its Czech counterparts in evaluated trans-
lated texts. It is assumed that this subject is con-
textually non-bound (not deductible from the pre-
vious context, it is “new” information) and is thus
expected elsewhere than at the beginning of the
sentence, most likely to follow the predicate in
Czech. Moreover, this subject (or the constituent
corresponding to it in Czech) could be also so-
called focus proper standing at the very end of the
Czech sentence in written texts.

For Czech translations, it was necessary to
check whether the Czech equivalent of the
English subject was retained as a contextually
non-bound sentence constituent and whether it
was appropriately located in the Czech sentence,
see the following example.

English text: What is the best-selling prepa-
ration test? A NEW LANGUAGE TEST is the
best-selling preparation test.

Expected Czech translation: Co je ne-
jprodávanějšı́m přı́pravným testem? Ne-

4For definitions of terms related to topic-focus articulation
and contextual boundness see Hajičová et al. (1998).

jprodávanějšı́m přı́pravným testem je NEW
LANGUAGE TEST.

6.1.2 Discourse connectives and their
sentence positions

The second phenomenon assessed in the anno-
tation were discourse connectives. Discourse
connectives are rather short function words (e.g.
but, therefore, nevertheless, because, or and)
that connect two text units while expressing a
discourse (semantico-pragmatic) relation between
them, thus ensuring text to a large extent text co-
herence and cohesion. Here, the problematic is-
sues included the use of a wrong Czech equiv-
alent – both from the semantic and grammati-
cal point of view (e.g. the positions of connec-
tives in a sentence etc.). An example of a wrong
connective translation is as follows. Since chalk
first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted to
know: What’s on the test? – *Protože se křı́da
poprvé dotkla břidlice, žáci chtěli vědět: Co je na
testu?

The English connective since is homonymous
and its meaning may be causal or temporal. In
the example, it was translated as causal (by the
Czech connective protože – because) in a temporal
context (the correct Czech translation here would
be od okamžiku, kdy (from the moment when...).
Such an incorrect translation of a discourse con-
nective demonstrates nicely the potential huge im-
pact on overall comprehensibility.

From the word order perspective, even these
cohesive devices have their typical positions in a
clause – according to their part-of-speech classifi-
cation. Coordinating conjunctions typically stand
between two discourse units (I play the flute and
I dance. / Hraju na flétnu a tančı́m.) both in En-
glish and Czech. Subordinating conjunctions typi-
cally occur at the beginning of the discourse unit to
which they belong syntactically (Because it rains,
I’m not going out. I won’t go out because it rains.
/ Protože pršı́, nepůjdu ven. Nepůjdu ven, protože
pršı́.). Connectives of adverbial origin have looser
positions in some cases;5 they can occur e.g. in
the first and second position in the sentence (For
me it is easier to not lose a game than to win it,
thus I produce better results in stronger tourna-
ments. Both umpires claimed that they were un-
sighted, and were thus forced to give Somny the
benefit of the doubt. / Pro mě je snazšı́ neztratit

5For more information see Rysová and Rysová (2018).

hru, než ji vyhrát, proto dosahuji lepšı́ch výsledků
v silnějšı́ch turnajı́ch. Oba rozhodčı́ tvrdili, že
neviděli, byli proto nuceni dát Somnymu výhodu
pochybovat.).

In some word-order positions of discourse con-
nectives, English and Czech differ. In other words,
a Czech translation should not copy the connec-
tive ordering from an English original. In English,
some discourse connectives can occur e.g. at the
very end of the sentence (cf. too, as well, instead,
nevertheless etc.), which is not typical for Czech.

To better compare the quality of the individual
translations, we observed especially the transla-
tion equivalents of multi-word connectives like as
long as or as much as that could be problematic
due to their idiomatic character.

6.1.3 Alternative lexicalizations of discourse
connectives (AltLexes)

In addition to discourse connectives, discourse re-
lations can also be expressed by their alternatives
called AltLexes, see Prasad et al. (2010). Alterna-
tive lexicalizations of connectives are often multi-
word phrases such as for this reason. Since these
cohesive structures often have an idiomatic char-
acter and they generally do not achieve such de-
gree of grammaticalization as connectives, their
forms in languages may vary to a large extent.

For example, the AltLex for this reason is not
translated into Czech literary as pro tento důvod
‘lit. for this reason’, but as z tohoto důvodu ‘lit.
from this reason’. Other examples of English Al-
tLexes are that’s all, that’s largely due to, at-
tributed that to, it will cause etc. A list of Al-
tLexes in English is given in Prasad et al. (2007),
multi-word connective expressions in Czech are
described and presented in Rysová (2018). Due
to their high lexical variety and lower degree of
grammaticalization, AltLexes were selected for
the annotation as potentially interesting expres-
sions for translation.

7 Results

In this section, we present the results of the evalu-
ation.

7.1 Inter-annotator agreement
The inter-annotator agreement was measured pair-
wise, it ranges from 66 % to 93 % with an average
of 80 %. The agreement was on average 69 % for
AltLexes, 87 % for connectives and 79 % for ques-
tions concerning word order.



461

7.2 AltLexes

The annotation interface for alternative lexicaliza-
tions contained identical questions to those for
connective assessment (described above in Sec-
tion 4), with the exception of their (in)correct
placement, as this question is irrelevant for such
non-grammaticalized phrases. There were 23
queries in average for each of the evaluated trans-
lations. The results for adequacy of AltLex trans-
lations in each system output AND the reference
are summed up in Table 1.

A source AltLex was assessed as an appropri-
ate connecting device in accordance with the orig-
inal discourse annotation in 130 cases (Yes), and
inappropriate in 42 cases (No). The proportion
of negative answers is surprisingly high, but a
closer look on the data reveals that the annotators,
quite in unity (but in contrast to the PDTB no-
tion of AltLex), resist treating verbs as a specific
form of connecting devices. This mostly concerns
causative verbs like to explain, to strengthen or to
blame. They might be in fact right, these verbs are
mostly translated well and their role in discourse
coherence is a rather supplementary one. Apart
from this issue, Table 1 demonstrates that once an
AltLex is approved as a connecting device, it is in
vast majority of cases translated correctly (rarely
incorrectly), the original discourse meaning is pre-
served and it is not omitted in the translation. This
applies quite equally across all systems, with a
small decrease for CUNI-DocTransf-Marian sys-
tem and the reference (!). A potential explanation
is the typically looser human translation (and pos-
sibly the context-aware Marian system).

7.3 Connectives

As for connectives, there were 52 queries in av-
erage for each of the evaluated translations. The
results for adequacy of connective translations in
each system output and the reference are summed
up in Table 2. A source connective candidate
was assessed as an factual connecting device in
303 cases (Yes), and not a connective in 30 cases
(No). This proportion seems to be correct, the
non-connective readings of some expressions are
relevant, e.g. several times for as much as in the
function (and position) of a quantifier. Once a con-
nective candidate is approved as an actual connec-
tive, it translated always correctly (compare col-
umn “n” in Table 2), but it is possibly incorrectly
placed in the translation (column “ax”). The result

figures indicate that there are no significant differ-
ences across the systems in translating the traced
connectives.

7.4 Word order

The word order evaluation focused the translation
of contextually non-bound subjects (representing
a new information in the sentence). The annota-
tors first determined, which of the automatically
preselected sentences from the English source in-
deed contain a contextually non-bound subject (85
Yes, 10 No). If yes, they traced whether the sub-
ject in the Czech translation also contextually non-
bound. The results of manual annotation demon-
strate that MT systems in general preserve the con-
textual non-boundness of the subjects. The figures
are comparable across the systems, only the Mar-
ian system and the reference achieved a slightly
worse scores:

yes no
CUNI-Transf-2018 11 1
CUNI-DocTransf-Marian 17 3
online-B 6 1
CUNI-DocTransf-T2T 17 1
CUNI-Transf-2019 6 1
reference 19 4

In a second task, we observed whether the sub-
ject in the English original the focus proper of
the given sentence. Again, the annotators first fil-
tered out relevant sentences (10 Yes, 36 No). Then
they looked at whether the subject in the Czech
translation is also the focus proper of the sentence.
Similarly as in the previous task, the Marian sys-
tem’s performance is worse, and the performance
of CUNI-DocTransf-T2T drops. However, the re-
sults here are less significant, as there were only
few occurrences of the annotated tokens:

yes no
CUNI-Transf-2018 2 0
CUNI-DocTransf-Marian 5 3
online-B 0 1
CUNI-DocTransf-T2T 1 2
CUNI-Transf-2019 0 1
reference 1 6

Next, we followed the systems’ ability to place
the Czech equivalents of the original English sub-
jects correctly into the Czech output sentence.
Here, a correct placement according to the Czech
word order rules was mostly achieved by all sys-
tems. There was not enough data collected for the
online-B system, but the rest is comparable, with
both context-aware systems performing slightly

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we have described a test suite of
parallel English-Czech texts provided for WMT19
with the aim to assess discourse phenomena in
output of MT systems participating in the News
Translation Task. We have carried out an exten-
sive manual annotation of the MT outputs and
identified types of translation errors relevant to
document-level translation. We also compared the
systems’ performance with respect to the observed
phenomena.

In general, the recent NMT systems have
achieved such a high level of translation quality
that it has become difficult to evaluate their output
in a systematic fashion. Most of the errors in the
translation cannot be found by a simple compari-
son with the reference translation, a bilingual eval-
uation is needed. Moreover, for the observed phe-
nomena, the systems performed with only a mi-
nor differences among each other and they reached

the quality of the reference. In fact, the refer-
ence translation was in some aspects evaluated
as worse, which is likely caused by the greater
literal adherence of the automatic translations to
the original and it does not mean that the refer-
ence is incorrect. Contrary to our assumptions,
the two context-aware systems did not outperform
the others in translating the followed document-
level phenomena. This can be attributed to the
fact that the systems perform good enough on this
task already, and also partly because the evalua-
tion can change a lot using just a slightly differ-
ent annotation setting, e.g. if we traced also other
(ambiguous) connective expressions or anaphoric
items. The actual errors are difficult to predict
from scratch and they occur randomly. More
specifically, while the translations of AltLexes and
discourse connectives showed quite satisfactory
(at least of those observed here), the most errors
(equally across systems) were detected in the area
of word order and contextual (non-)boundness of
the subjects. The systems prefer to keep the orig-
inal word also in the translations, not really ac-
counting for the impact of information structure.
