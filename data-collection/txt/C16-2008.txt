Abstract

The paper introduces a web-based authoring support system, MuTUAL, which aims to help
writers create multilingual texts. The highlighted feature of the system is that it enables machine
translation (MT) to generate outputs appropriate to their functional context within the target doc-
ument. Our system is operational online, implementing core mechanisms for document structur-
ing and controlled writing. These include a topic template and a controlled language authoring
assistant, linked to our statistical MT system.

1 Introduction

For improved machine translatability, a wide variety of controlled language (CL) rule sets have been
proposed (Kittredge, 2003; Kuhn, 2014). Evidence of reduced post-editing costs when a CL is employed
is provided (Bernth and Gdaniec, 2001; O’Brien and Roturier, 2007), and several controlled authoring
support tools, such as Acrolinx1 and MAXIT2, have been developed. The fundamental limitation of the
CLs proposed hitherto is, however, that they are defined at the level of the sentence rather than at the
level of the document (Hartley and Paris, 2001). In fact, the notion of functional document element (see
Section 2.1) does figure in some CL rule sets. ASD Simplified Technical English (ASD, 2013), for ex-
ample, specifies writing patterns linked to functional roles of the document elements; the recommended
maximum length of sentence is 20 words for ‘procedural’ writing and 25 words for ‘descriptive’ writing.
Yet, the granularity of the elements is not high enough to enable detailed definitions of linguistic pat-
terns within the elements. Thus it is necessary to formalise a document-level framework which enables
context-dependent CL specification.

In this paper, we introduce an integrated web-based system, MuTUAL, which implements a suite of
controlled authoring support modules, combined with our statistical machine translation (SMT) system.
At the document level, document structuring modules help authors create well-organised documents.
At the sentence level, controlled writing modules help them write source texts (ST) consistent with
source-language CL rules. The principal innovation in the system is to contextualise the CL rules in
the document structure to enable MT to generate outputs consistent with the target-side CL for a given
functional element. While the current system supports the creation of municipal procedural documents
in Japanese and their translation into English, it is extensible to other language pairs and text domains.

2 Contextual Translation

MuTUAL starts from the observation that the same source sentence should be translated as different tar-
get sentences depending on its location within the functional elements of the document. Let us consider
this example Japanese sentence from a procedural technical manual: ‘文書を印刷する/bunsho o insatsu
suru’. This sentence can appear as a task title in a section heading or as a step description in an itemi-
sation, and should be translated, respectively, as ‘To print a document’ or ‘Print the document’. That is,
the translation depends on the item’s functional role within the document.

Table 1: Instantiation of the DITA Task topic

To realise contextual translation using MT, we (1) formulated a document structure for municipal
procedures based on the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) framework (OASIS, 2010), and
(2) defined context-dependent CL rules in both source and target languages according to the functional
document elements, in combination with ST transformation rules.

2.1 Functional Task Elements

DITA is an XML architecture for authoring and publishing technical information which supports struc-
tured authoring to help writers compose a modularised chunk of information, called topic (Bellamy et al.,
2012). A topic has a hierarchical structure of functional elements, i.e., elements which play certain com-
municative roles within the documents, and, at the highest level, is composed of the common elements:
Title, Short description, Prologue, Body and Related-links.

According to topic types, DITA further defines more specific elements under the Body element. DITA
provides by default several topic types such as Concept topic, Reference topic and Task topic. We focus
here on the Task topic, which is designed for describing technical procedures, because what we are
concerned is mainly municipal procedures. The left column in Table 1 shows the functional elements
under the Body of Task topic (OASIS, 2010).

Note that the functional elements of the Task topic as defined in DITA are still too coarse-grained to
properly organise municipal procedures and specify detailed linguistic patterns for each element. How-
ever, DITA allows for ‘specialisation’, so we undertook a genre analysis of actual municipal documents
and assigned fine-grained sub-elements (the right column of Table 1).

2.2 Context-dependent CL with Pre-translation Processing

At this stage, the DITA structure provides a language-independent functional framework, which helps
authors identify what information should be included. It is, however, still unclear how to write and
translate each element. In order to instantiate the elements as texts, we defined context-dependent CL
rules, i.e., desired linguistic patterns, for each element on both source and target sides.

For example, Event condition requires a conditional clause such as ‘日本に来たとき/nihon ni kita
toki’ (when you arrive in Japan). We also assigned a rather strict pattern for Steps element, polite speech
style with declarative form ‘します/shimasu’ in Japanese and imperative form ‘do’ in English, such as
‘以下の書類を持参します/ika no shorui o jizan shimasu’ (Bring the following documents), while the
constraint is relaxed in Context, Result and Postreq.

The problem here is that a CL-compliant ST segment does not always generate a desired linguistic
form in the target language. To resolve such incompatibilities, we introduce background pre-translation
processing to transform the ST into an internal form amenable to the chosen MT system. Figure 1 depicts
an example flow of this process for the Steps element: ST1 is the CL-compliant original sentence, in
polite speech style with the declarative ‘shimasu’. Since the MT output MT1 is not a desirable result,
ST1 is transformed internally into ST2, with the imperative ‘shiro’. This then enables MT to produce

MT2, which complies with the target side CL rule, with the use of the imperative form ‘do’. ST1 is
served to Japanese readers and MT2 to English readers. This process can be fully automated by defining
simple transformation rules based on the morphological analysis of ST,3 on condition that the linguistic
patterns of the ST are sufficiently controlled in conjunction with functional elements.

3 The MuTUAL System

The MuTUAL system comprises modules for document structuring, controlled writing, and multilin-
gualisation (see Figure 2). The following modules realise the contextual translation we have outlined:

• Topic template is the core interface for authoring self-contained topics in a structured manner.
The left pane in Figure 3 provides the basic DITA Task topic structure for composing municipal
procedural documents.

• CL authoring assistant analyses each sentence in the text box and highlights any segment that vio-
lates a local CL rule or controlled terminology, together with diagnostic comments and suggestions
for rewriting (shown at bottom centre in Figure 3) (Miyata et al., 2016). In addition, we have imple-
mented a preliminary rewriting support function with several of the features advocated by Mitamura
et al. (2003). For a particular CL-noncompliant segment, the function offers alternative expressions;
clicking one of the suggestions automatically replaces the offending segment in the text box above.

• Pre-translation processing automatically modifies source segments in the background following
transformation rules defined for each functional element, and then MT produces the translation and
back-translation at the same time.

The key mechanism for enhancing authoring and translation is to invoke the CL authoring assistant
tuned to the current functional element. For example, only for the Steps elements of the template, it
implements the rule ‘use declarative form shimasu at the end of the sentence’. Then the pre-translation
processing for Steps transforms the declarative ‘shimasu’ into an imperative ‘shiro’ for our MT system
to produce the desired imperative form ‘do’ on the target side.

The modules above are implemented in PHP and JavaScript, and can be accessed through the usual
web browsers. The topic template seamlessly connects with our SMT system, TexTra,4 the dictionary of
which is customised by municipal terminology we maintain. We plan to publish an open-source version
of the system through our project website.5

4 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented a web-based support system for authoring municipal procedural documents. The prin-
cipal novel feature of the system is that it makes use of document structuring based on the DITA frame-
work, which affords a basis for fine-grained context-dependent CL rules coupled with pre-translation
processing. It consequently enables MT to generate outputs appropriate to their functional context with-
out degrading the quality of the source.

MuTUAL is currently operational online, focusing on the Task topic for creating municipal procedural
documents in Japanese and English. The implemented CL rules were shown to be effective in triggering
more appropriate outputs from our SMT system (Miyata et al., 2015). Also, a preliminary user evaluation
revealed that the controlled authoring assistant module helped reduce time correcting CL-violations by
more than 30%. As a future evaluation plan, while previous work has tended to focus on sentence-
level text quality, we intend to evaluate the document-level quality of the system products by adopting
task-based methods (Colineau et al., 2002). We will eventually make the system available to municipal
departments and assess its usability in actual work scenarios.

4TexTra is a state-of-the-art SMT system particularly intended for Japanese as source language, and provides free API.
