Back to 2012
● David Canek, Memsource CEO and founder presented at 2012 AMTA 

conference in San Diego
● Anyone attended? Raise hands
● At that time MT was picking up in the industry and David presented results 

from a survey Memsource and the GALA association ran among translation 
providers/LSPs

When using MT, are you able to measure its quality?

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 206



Do your translators use MT without you knowing 
about it?

2011: The Introduction of The Post-editing Analysis
● MT integration with CAT tools 

began around 2010 
● Limited features supporting MT 

post-editing, e.g., to measure 
PE efficiency

● In 2011 Memsource launched 
the post-editing analysis

MT Usage Started Picking Up

Post-editing Became the Norm 

In 50%+ translation projects with machine translation enabled, MT post-editing 
became the preferred method of professional translation.

 From TEP...
● Translation

● Editing

● Proofreading

Less Post-editing
● Machine translation

● Automated quality estimation

● Human post-editing

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 214



Automated Quality Estimation
● A very hard problem.
● We decided to first apply our approach to segments that DO NOT HAVE TO 

BE TRANSLATED: non-translatables

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 215



Examples of Non-translatables
● A segment that is simply copied from source to target.
● Some Examples: 

○ 123
○ Labs.Core.Actions.IGetValueOptions 
○ Memsource
○ Eva Smith
○ 51 x 55 mm

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 216



14% of Segments Are Non-translatable

Accuracy
Overall accuracy very high:

●  ~98% of accuracy of non-translatable segment identification
● ~95% of accuracy of 100% non-translatable match category
