Abstract

In this paper, we provide a quantitative
analysis of non-projective constructions
attested in the Ancient Greek Dependency
Treebank (AGDT). We consider the differ-
ent types of formal constraints and metrics
that have become standardized in the liter-
ature on non-projectivity (planarity, well-
nestedness, gap-degree, edge-degree). We
also discuss some of the linguistic factors
that cause non-projective edges in Ancient
Greek. Our results confirm the remark-
able extension of non-projectivity in the
AGDT, both in terms of quantitative inci-
dence of non-projective nodes and for their
complexity, which is not paralleled by the
corpora of modern languages considered
in the literature. At the same time, the
usefulness of other constraint (especially
well-nestedness) is confirmed by our re-
searches.

1 Introduction

The “free” word-order of Ancient Greek (AG) is
a notorious problem for philologists and linguists.
In spite of several studies devoted to the subject,
the tendencies that govern the disposition of words
and constituents in the sentence still lack a com-
prehensive explanation. Strictly connected to the
word-order issue is the relevant amount of discon-
tinuous constituents, which even casual readers of
AG texts can experience1.

The dependency-based treebanks of Classical
languages (AG and Latin) that have been recently
made available enable us to reconsider this long
debate in the light of the abundant work on non-
projective structures in dependency trees. Non-
projectivity (see 2 for a formal definition) is a

structures see Devine and Stephens (2000).

key issue in dependency grammar, both from the
formal point of view and from a more descrip-
tive linguistic perspective. From the standpoint
of natural language processing, non-projectivity is
also known to affect the efficiency of dependency
parsers.

In a first attempt to improve parsing perfor-
mances on AG, Mambrini and Passarotti (2012)
reported that the amount of non-projective arcs oc-
curring in the available treebanks of Classical lan-
guages is significantly higher than that attested in
the corpora of modern languages used for CoNLL-
X (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006, 155, tab. 1) and
CoNLL 2007 shared tasks (Nivre et al., 2007, 920,
tab. 1). Furthermore, the non-projective rate in
the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank is higher
than in Classical and Medieval Latin (Passarotti
and Ruffolo, 2010, 920, tab. 1).

In this paper, we want to discuss this claim in
depth and substantiate it by applying to AG data
the standard metrics for the different kinds of non-
projective constructions established in the litera-
ture.

The paper is organized as follows. Section
2 provides a definition of the formal constraints
considered and of the metrics that will be used:
non-projectivity, planarity, well-nestedness, on the
one hand, and gap-degree and edge-degree on the
other. Section 3 introduces the corpus that will be
tested, the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank
(AGDT).

Section 4 presents the evidence provided by the
data. In 4.1 we report the results for the different
constraints and metrics defined in section 2. Re-
sults for the distribution of non-projectivity in the
different genres of the corpus are given and com-
mented in 4.2.

In section 5, we discuss some of the linguistic
issues that cause non-projectivity. Finally, section
6 reports our conclusions and sketches possible di-
rections for additional research.

2 Non-projectivity

A dependency tree is a rooted tree where the nodes
represent the words of a sentence, the edges repre-
sent the syntactic dependencies and the linear or-
der of the nodes stands for the sequence of words.

According to the so-called ‘treeness constraint’
(Debusmann and Kuhlmann, 2010), a dependency
tree requires (a) that no word should depend on
itself, not even transitively (i.e. the tree must be
acyclic), (b) that each word should have at most
one governor, and (c) that a dependency analysis
should cover all the words in the sentence.

If a node j depends on a node i, j is called a
‘child’ of i, and, symmetrically, i is the ‘parent’ of
j (we write i → j). On the other hand, we write
i ↔ j whenever the edge is considered regardless
of the direction of the relation (i can be either the
parent or the child of j). If i precedes j in the
word order, i lies to the left of j (we write i < j);
conversely, j lies to the right of i (j > i). The
set of all nodes that can be reached from a given
node i by following a directed path of zero or more
edges is called the set of ‘descendants’ of i. A
subtree of a tree T at a node i is the restriction of
T (nodes and edges) to the descendants of i.

The condition of projectivity, which was for-
mally defined by Marcus (1965), requires each de-
pendency subtree to cover a contiguous region of
the sentence: a word and its transitive dependents
must span a contiguous sequence in the linear or-
der. We may define the constraint of projectivity
with the following formula (Havelka, 2007, 609):

i→ j & v ∈ (i, j) =⇒ v ∈ Subtreei

which must be read in this way: let i be the par-
ent of j (i → j); if a node v lies between i and
j in the linear order of the sentence, then v be-
longs to the subtree of i. If this condition does not
hold, then the edge is non-projective and v is said
to be in a gap (v ∈ Gapi↔j). Example 1 illus-
trates this construction with a simplified version
of a sentence from the AGDT (the first sentence
of the Iliad), which is also represented in fig. 12.
The edges mēnin-Achilēos and mēnin-ouloménēn
are non-projective, since the nodes of áeide and
theá are in a gap in both cases.

2The Greek words and lemmata in the AGDT are written
in Greek characters, transcribed according to an ASCII-based
convention known as “Beta Code” (TLG, 2010). All the trees
reported in this paper are transliterated in Latin script by the
authors for ease of reading.

Non-projectivity, which was postulated by Mar-
cus (1965) for the purposes of machine translation
and language generation, is too strong a constraint
for natural languages: a non-negligible number
of constructions attested for many languages does
not satisfy the condition. Several relaxations to the
definition were subsequently introduced in order
to better account for the linguistic data.

The condition of planarity involves two edges
i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2 and disallows any over-
lapping between them. Two edges are said to
overlap if, for example, i1 > i2 > j1 > j2 or
i1 < i2 < j1 < j2. Therefore, following Havelka
(2007), a tree is non-planar if there are at least two
edges i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2 that meet the following
condition:

i1 ∈ (i2, j2) & i2 ∈ (i1, j1)

Example 2 (fig. 2) presents two non-planar
edges from a tree of the AGDT.

Figure 2: Non-planar (well-nested) edges

In the tree reported in fig. 2, the edges éthēke
→ Achaióis and álge’→ mýri’ are non-planar, be-
cause éthēke > álge’ > Achaióis > mýri’.

Well-nestedness introduces a further relaxation
to projectivity. A (sub)tree is said to be well-
nested if, for each pair of overlapping disjoint
edges, the source node of one of the edges is a
descendant of the source node of the other; con-
versely (Havelka, 2007), the (sub)tree is ill-nested
if, for two edges i1 ↔ j1 and i2 ↔ j2:

i1 ∈ Gapi2↔j2 & i2 ∈ Gapi1↔j1

One may note that the two edges in fig. 2 are
well-nested, since álge’ is the child of éthēke.

In addition to these constraints, two met-
rics have become standard measures for non-
projectivity.

Given a non-projective edge, edge-degree rep-
resents the number of nodes that are in the gap.
This metric was introduced by Nivre (2006), but
was named edge-degree by Kuhlmann and Nivre
(2006) and it corresponds to component degree
in Havelka (2007). The edge-degree can be esti-
mated either by counting the edges that match the
definition in a treebank, or by using the tree as a
basis, the edge-degree of a tree T being equal to
the highest edge-degree among the edges of T .

On the contrary, gap-degree is not based on a
single edge, but rather on the ‘projection’ (or on
the ‘blocks’) of a node, which is defined as the
longest non-empty sequence of nodes that goes
down to a terminal node in a chain succession
from father to child3. A gap (or interval) in the
projection is a discontinuity such that, given a

3A projection of a node may consist of one or more
’blocks’, i.e. maximal, non-empty intervals of descendants.

node jk in the sequence, jk − jk+1 > 1. The gap-
degree corresponds to the number of gaps in the
sequence (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006), while the
gap-degree of a tree is equal to the highest gap-
degree for each sequence in the tree4.

3 The corpus

The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (Bam-
man et al., 2009) is a dependency-based treebank
of Greek literary texts of the Archaic and Classical
age published by the Perseus Digital Library5.

In its theoretical framework and guidelines, the
AGDT is inspired by the analytical layer of the
Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (Böhmová
et al., 2001). Currently, the last published version
of the AGDT (1.7) includes 354,529 tokens. The
collection is constituted by unabridged works that

degree (Havelka, 2007). Given a non-projective edge i → j
with v1,n in the gap, the interval-degree corresponds to the
number of intervals in the sequence v1,n.

iad, the Odyssey, and the complete works of Hes-
iod), tragedy (the complete work of Aeschylus and
five plays of Sophocles), philosophical prose (the
Euthyphro of Plato). Chronologically, the texts
range from the 8th to the 4th Century BCE. The

4.1 Constraints and measures in the AGDT
Table 2 reports the number and percentage of the
trees that do not respect the constraints of projec-
tivity, planarity, and well-nestedness in the AGDT
1.7. The Ancient Greek data are compared with
those of six other languages from the CoNLL-X
shared task that display the highest rate of non-
projective constructions (Havelka, 2007)7. The
languages are sorted according to the percentage
of non-projective trees in decreasing order.

As it may be seen, AG shows a remarkably high
rate of non-projective trees in comparison with the
other languages. Non-projective edges are found
in almost three out of every four sentences of the
AGDT, a distribution that nearly reverses that of
German, Czech or Slovene. The abundance of
non-projective constructions in the AGDT stands
out even more clearly when one considers the rate
of non-projective edges instead of non-projective

6The dates reported in the table refer to the century BCE.
In some cases (like for the Homeric poems and the works of
Hesiod), even this general chronology is very hypothetical.

7Note that in the CoNLL data format, each sentence is
provided with a technical root node placed before the sen-
tence (i.e. the root is the leftmost node in dependency trees
for left-to-right languages). All the dependency analyses are
attached directly, or indirectly to the root node. As edges
from technical roots may introduce non-planarity, we disre-
gard all such edges when counting trees conforming to the
planarity constraint. Since the same is done by Havelka
(2007, p. 21), this makes our data comparable with those
reported there.

comparative data are again taken from Havelka

Table 3: Non-projective edges in AG and other
languages

Although AG is exceptional for the incidence of
non-projective edges, if one considers the different
conditions of relaxation of projectivity, AG data
seem to reflect the same tendencies already ob-
served in other languages (Kuhlmann and Nivre,
2006; Havelka, 2007). Non-planarity does not
prove to mark a significant relaxation. On the
contrary, well-nestedness is a very effective con-
straint in AG too. Although the absolute rate is
higher than in the other languages, the number of
ill-nested trees is considerably smaller.

AG deviates from the trend observed in
other languages also for the complexity of non-
projective structures, as measured by both gap-
and edge-degree. The observations reported in ta-
ble 4 highlight the main differences with the other
languages studied8.

The fact that in AG the percentages of gap-
degree 0 and 1 appear to be almost inverted in
comparison with those of the other languages is
not surprising, given the general proportion of
non-projective trees in the languages discussed. In
all the languages but AG, a threshold set to gap-
degree = 1 is a very strong constraint, which al-
lows to account for more than 99% of the total of
trees9. In AG, instead, the number of trees with
gap-degree = 3 is still a non-negligible fraction
(more than 6% of the total).

The rate of trees with edge-degree≥ 1 is signif-
icantly higher in AG than in the other languages
too. While in other treebanks an edge-degree = 2
is already sufficient to cover more than 99% of the

trees, it is only at edge-degree = 7 (0.84%) that the
frequency of the AGDT trees drops under 1% of
the corpus10.

To sum up, we can conclude that, whereas well-
nestedness appears to be an effective constraint in
AG too, the thresholds of gap-degree 1 and edge-
degree 2 in the AGDT do not have the same impact
as that observed in other treebanks.

4.2 The role of genre

Genre difference is known to have a strong effect
on the performances of dependency parsers for AG
texts (Mambrini and Passarotti, 2012). It is impor-
tant, therefore, to observe if the values reported
above are at variance in the different genres in-
cluded in the AGDT.

The frequencies of non-projective constructions
in each of the three genres of the AGDT are re-
ported in table 5. The most relevant fact is the
difference between the poetic genres (epic and
drama) on the one hand, and the philosophical dia-
logue in prose on the other. This difference can be
appreciated especially when one looks at the rate
on non-projective edges, which does not vary sig-
nificantly between epic and drama (respectively,
15.30% and 15.09%), but it is quite different if
prose is concerned (9.81%). Plato’s Euthyphro
(the sole prose work included in the corpus at the

tation error.

moment) is the only text where the number of non-
projective trees is less than 50%, although the in-
cidence of non-projectivity is still sensibly higher
than in corpora of modern languages, as reported
above.

These distributions may lead to the claim that
the high number of discontinuous constituents is
due to poetic style and, possibly, to the metrical
constraints that operate in poetic language11. Un-
fortunately, no conclusions can be drawn on this
matter. Limited as they are to one single author
and text, the presently available data for prose lan-
guage can hardly point to more than a working
hypothesis for future research. It will be possi-
ble to test this hypothesis as soon as new texts of
the same genre and/or author will be added to the
corpus.

5 Discussion: linguistic causes of
non-projective edges in the AGDT

In this section we discuss some of the linguistic
causes of non-projective edges in the AGDT. We
first analyze one specific kind of nodes in the gap
(the clitics: 5.1); then we will focus on those non-
projective edges in the AGDT that are governed by
a verb or by a noun, also in the light of the typolo-
gies studied for Czech (Hajičová et al., 2004).

11Sensible remarks (with minimal bibliography) about the
question of linguistic and metrical constraints on word-order
in AG tragedy can be read in Dik (2007, 3, 168-224).

5.1 The role of clitics

As it is partly the case with the Czech conjunc-
tion -li (Hajičová et al., 2004), clitics are likely
to have a strong role in non-projective structures
of the AGDT. It is well known that in AG clitics
tend to stick to a fixed position in the sentence
or clause, in accordance to the so-called “Wack-
ernagel’s law”, which is common to many Indo-
European languages (Wackernagel, 1892; Ruijgh,
1990). The words that belong to the class of post-
positives (i.e. the clitics and a few other words that
cannot occupy the clause-initial position) tend to
be placed in second position, even when this col-
location breaks a syntactic constituent. In exam-
ple 4, the coordinating particle d’ (dé) is placed in
second position and separates one of the two (non-
coordinated) attributes (pollás) from the rest of the
noun phrase (iphthı́mous psychás).

This situation is normal also with the enclitic te
(and, = Latin -que), which is regularly placed after
the first word of coordinated clauses. Whenever
the word that precedes te has one or more right
descendants in the dependency tree, te comes to
be in a gap.

Some facts hint that this tendency of clitics is
a relevant issue for non-projectivity: we have re-

quent words recurring in gaps belong all to the
class of postpositives; in total, postpositives ac-
count for about 40% (39.16%) of the nodes at-
tested in gaps12. As for the most frequent syntactic
labels, coordinating conjunctions (COORD) and
sentence adverbials (AuxY), which are the two
typical functions of postpositives, are again the
two groups ranking in the first and second place.
Finally, second position (i.e. the one which is usu-
ally occupied by postpositives) is by far the most

often attested for nodes in a gap13.

5.2 Verb-headed and noun-headed
non-projective edges in the AGDT

In this section we will focus on those non-
projective edges that are governed by either a
noun/pronoun or a verb, as they cover more than
76% of all the non-projective edges in the AGDT.

Figure 4: Iliad 1.53-4

Verb-headed edges: in the non-projective struc-
tures of the AGDT, verbal complementations pre-
cedes their verbal head in the 67.93% of the cases.
Both arguments (subjects, predicatives and di-
rect/indirect objects) and adjuncts (several kinds
of adverbial modifications) are very frequently in-
volved in such a movement of the complements to
the left, which often results in non-projective con-
structions.

In Czech, this situation is produced notably by
contrastive contextually bound elements moved
towards the beginning of the clause. As the AGDT
does not feature annotation of information struc-
ture yet, it is not easy for us to evaluate its quanti-
tative impact in data, but a reading of the examples
that can be extracted from the treebank suggests
that the same tendency is at work also in AG14.

In the two coordinated clauses of example 5
(fig. 4), for instance, the temporal complemen-

13The value of this observation is very limited. There are a
number of cases (starting with those where a particle follows
a coordinating conjunction and has the second coordinated
clause in its scope) where the “second position” of clitics does
not correspond to the second word of a sentence. However,
it seems significant, also in light of the other observation re-
ported above, that rank n. 2 scores so highly.

14It is also known that topic elements in AG tend to be
placed at the beginning of the clause (Dik, 1995; Matić,
2003).

tations create a contrastive frame for the action
(ennēmar. . . tēi dekátēi). In order to highlight their
function, both complements are moved to the first
position of their respective clauses. This move-
ment causes non-projectivity, as the nodes for mén
and d’ result to be in a gap.

Another phenomenon that may generate non-
projective constructions in AG is the raising
of complementations of infinitive verbs that are
moved to the left outside the subordinate clause.
The importance of this pattern can be seen by mea-
suring the distribution of verbal mood in the non-
projective arcs. Indicative dominates in general
(75% vs 14% of infintives), but if one considers
the subset of cases with complement–head order
and with a gap wider than one single clitic, then
the rate of infinitives increases considerably (50%
vs 42% of indicatives).

So they sailed over the watery paths, while
the son of Atreus commanded the men to
purify themselves (Iliad 1.312-2, slightly

Example 6 (fig. 5) shows a combination of the
two aforementioned phenomena: laoús, subject of
the infinitive apolymáinesthai, is moved to the left
of the main verb of the clause, outside the subordi-
nate governed by the infinitive. At the same time,
one may note the structure of the sentence, where
two clauses are contrasted. In the first part, the
departure of a small embassy of twenty selected

Greek soldiers (whose preparation is the subject of
the preceding lines) is mentioned. In the second,
the events at the Greek camp and the actions of
the main army that remains at Troy are narrated.
When the whole army is mentioned again, thus,
the contrastive contextually bound word (laoús) is
raised in prominent position and this movement
causes non-projectivity, since the subject of the
governing clause (Atreı́dēs) comes to be in a gap15.

Noun-headed edges: nouns can govern at-
tributes (in the form of adjectives, nouns in
genitives, or relative clauses), predicatives and
valency complements (especially for deverbal
nouns). In the case of nouns, the preference to-
ward the complement–head order is less marked
than with verbs (57% complement–head vs 43
head–complement%).

The head-noun of a non-projective edge can be
the salient element moved toward the beginning of
the sentence. This is the case in example 1 (fig. 1),
where the noun mēnis (“wrath”), which introduces
the main subject of the whole poem, is the focus of
the sentence. This word is placed in first position,
before the invocation to the Muse, and detached
from the possessive genitive (“of Achilles”), of the
epithet (”accursed”) and of the long series of rel-
ative clauses that further specify the noun (not re-
ported in the example above). The left-movement
of the noun that isolates one of the key-themes in
the poem occurs in the first sentence of each of the

tually bound subject (hoi) and the verb (epépleon) are non-
contiguous, with the particle mén placed in the gap.

epic texts of the AGDT, with the only exception of
the Shield of Herakles.

Figure 6: Iliad 1.8

Another case where we can observe the iso-
lation of one focus element at the beginning of
the sentence is with the interrogative pronoun tı́s
(“who/which?”). Often, this left-movement sep-
arates the pronoun from the determiners that fur-
ther specify it; in the case of example 7 (fig. 6)
the pronoun is separated from the partitive geni-
tive (tı́s. . . theōn) by two particles (t’ and ár) and
by the direct object of the verb (sphōe)16.

against each other so that they contended

Predicative adjectives, which specify the man-
ner of the action expressed by the verb but agree
with a nominal head, are very frequent in AG.
They are syntactically dependent on the agreeing
noun, but they modify semantically the verb as
well. This sort of “double gravity” is a poten-
tial source of non-projective constructions. Often,
as it is the case with autómatos (“of his initiative,
unbidden”) in example 8 (fig. 7), predicative ad-
jectives convey the most salient information in the
sentence and are therefore attracted toward a pre-
eminent position.

16The fact that the identity of the god is the focus of the
question is evinced from the answers that is given (as nominal
sentence) in the line that follows: “the son of Leto and Zeus.
For he, angered against the king” etc.

6 Conclusions and future work

Our survey has confirmed the remarkable exten-
sion of non-projectivity in the Ancient Greek De-
pendency Treebank (1.7). The AGDT stands out
for the relevant amount of both non-projective
trees and edges, which are unmatched by the rate
of discontinuous structures known from depen-
dency treebanks of other languages and for the
complexity of these constructions.

The edge-degree and gap-degree measures of
non-projective trees from the AGDT are equally
unmatched. In particular, the non-neglectable
rates of trees with gap-degree ≥ 2 (which include
more than 6% of the sentences in the AGDT) con-
tradicts the assumptions that were inferable from
other languages. On the other hand, in spite of
these peculiarities, AG data confirm other conclu-
sions that were drawn in previous literature, es-
pecially about the efficacy of the well-nestedness
constraint.

The peculiar nature of these results may par-
tially depend on the genres represented in the cor-
pus, more than 98% of which is taken from poetic

texts. The only prose work that is included in the
collection shows a lesser degree of non-projective
trees and edges, without conforming, however, to
the rates known from other languages.

We have also isolated a number of specific con-
structions and we have tried to highlight some lin-
guistic factors that can bring about syntactic dis-
continuity. Section 5 does not want to be an ex-
haustive classification of the linguistic aspects that
stand behind non-projectivity: further work is re-
quired. Especially, on account of the well known
influence of topic-focus articulation on AG word-
order, this research would greatly benefit from the
interaction of layers of syntax, pragmatics and in-
formation structure in annotated data.
