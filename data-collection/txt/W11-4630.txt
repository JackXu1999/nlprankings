Abstract

Psycho-acoustical research investigates
how human listeners are able to separate
sounds that stem from different sources.
This ability might be one of the reasons
that human speech processing is robust to
noise but methods that exploit this are, to
our knowledge, not used in systems for
automatic formant extraction or in mod-
ern speech recognition systems. There-
fore we investigate the possibility to use
harmonics that are consistent with a har-
monic complex as the basis for a robust
formant extraction algorithm. With this
new method we aim to overcome limita-
tions of most modern automatic speech
recognition systems by taking advantage
of the robustness of harmonics at formant
positions. We tested the effectiveness of
our formant detection algorithm on Hillen-
brand’s annotated American English Vow-
els dataset and found that in pink noise the
results are competitive with existing sys-
tems. Furthermore, our method needs no
training and is implementable as a real-
time system which contrasts many of the
existing systems.

1 Introduction

Formants are the resonance frequencies of the vo-
cal tract; they change as the shape of the vocal tract
changes. As such, formants are important acous-
tical cues for the description and identification of
phonemes.

The task of automatic formant frequency es-
timation is traditionally investigated by methods

based on LPC. Such representations accurately
estimate formant positions and formant develop-
ments (Vargas and McLaughlin, 2008) in clean
speech. However, efforts that focus on formant
detection in noise (de Wet et al. 2004; Mustafa
and Bruce, 2006; Yan et al. 2007) show results
that deteriorate quickly in noise. One exception to
this can be found by the system that was recently
developed by Glaeser et al. (2010); their method
shows a major improvement with regard to other
methods.

Human listeners can detect and recognize
speech in uncontrolled environments with rel-
atively little hindrance of background noises
(O’Shaughnessy, 2008). Psycho-acoustical re-
search suggests that human listeners use Breg-
mans grouping cues (Bregman, 1990) to recom-
bine components of sounds into a single percept.
Provided the individual components are separa-
ble from background noise these grouping princi-
ples can be applied in automatic methods. Those
methods were first investigated by Duifhuis et al.
(1982). In general, systems based on grouping
of harmonics are applicable in uncontrolled envi-
ronments and do not rely on training. However,
harmonic mismatches or missed detections some-
times occur.

Here, we investigate whether we can use the ex-
tractions of a harmonic grouping algorithm to ex-
tract robust formants without the need of training.
Our results show that formant position estimates
are stable over different noise conditions for a sim-
ple database. The results indicate that a renewed
investigation of the problem of harmonic complex
extraction can be a key to solving the lack of ro-
bustness in features for applications such as auto-
matic speech recognition.

2 Methods

2.1 Algorithm

In order to reach a close estimation of the reso-
nance frequencies of the vocal tract we perform
peak interpolation over harmonics in a harmonic
complex (HC). First, the time signal is converted
to the time-frequency domain by a gamma-chirp
filterbank (Irino and Patterson, 1997). Its filter co-
efficients (hgc) are defined by,

hgc = at
N−1e−2πbB(fc)tej(2πfct+c log(t)) (1)

where N = 4 is the order of the gammachirp. The
coefficients (a = 1, b = 0.71, c = -3.7) are based
on Irino and Patterson (1997) but were adjusted
such that the response is narrower in frequency
such that the tonal components become empha-
sized. The frequency range fc is fully logarithmic
from 67 to 4000 Hz over 100 channels. The band-

width (B) of the filters is given by (9),

B(fc) = 24.7 + 0.108fc (2)

We call the averaged and logarithmically com-
pressed result a cochleogram.

Second, harmonics are extracted from the
cochleogram using tone fit. Here we only give a
global description of tone fit (see Krijnders and
Andringa (submitted) and Krijnders et al. (2009)
for details). The tone fit is a measure how well
the cochleogram matches a tone at that time-
frequency location. This measure is calculated
with a filter derived from the response of the
cochleogram to a perfect tone. Connected loca-
tions that match the filter well (with high tone-fit
values) are extracted and are described as a line
through the best matching location. We call such a
description a signal component (Figure 1, top left).

The final step before the formant extraction
combines signal components into HCs (Figure 1,

top right). To that end, HC hypotheses are gen-
erated from energetic signal components (Figure
1, top right) that partly overlap in time and have
an approximately harmonic frequency relation to
each other. Initially a hypothesis consists of a
fundamental frequency (f0) estimate and energetic
signal components. Additional signal components
are added later to each hypothesis if they increase
the score of that hypothesis. This score is defined
as (Krijnders et al., 2009; Niessen et al., 2009):

S = nsc+ bf0 +nh−
∑

sc

rmssc−
∑

sc

∆fsc (3)

where nsc is the number of signal components in
the group, bf0 is one or zero depending on the
existence of a signal component at the f0, nh is
the number of sequential harmonics in the group,
rmssc are the root mean square values of the dif-
ferences of the signal component f0 after the mean
frequency difference is removed, and ∆fsc is the
mean frequency difference divided by harmonic
number. To reduce octave errors additional hy-
potheses at octaves above and below each hypoth-
esis are added and scored. In the formant extrac-
tion phase only the hypothesis with the highest
score is used.

The resonance frequencies of the vocal tract
might be located between two harmonics. There-
fore, a three point quadratic interpolation over the
harmonics around the harmonic with (local) max-
imum energy is used to estimate the formant lo-
cation (Figure 1, bottom left). Subsequently, for-
mant estimates with minimal distance in the adja-
cent frames in the time-frequency plane are con-
nected into formant tracks. Only tracks of suffi-
cient duration (7 frames or more, Figure 1, bottom
right) are kept. These long formant tracks consti-
tute our final formant estimate.

2.2 Material
The formant extractor was tested on the Amer-
ican English Vowels dataset (AEV) HillenBrand
(1995). The dataset consists of 12 vowels pro-
nounced in /h-V-d/ context by 48 female, 45
male and 46 child speakers. The AEV dataset is
automatically annotated and subsequently hand-
corrected for the first four formants at 8 points in
time for each vowel, which makes it a suitable
ground truth. We added pink noise in decreas-
ing signal to noise ratios (SNRs), from 30dB to -
6dB SNR. Pink noise was chosen because it masks
speech evenly.

2.3 Evaluation
As we do not extract exactly three formants we
cannot calculate error scores that represent the dis-
tance of the extracted formant to the annotated for-
mant. The annotations are determined in clean
speech and therefore we compare our results to the
annotations for the clean speech condition. In or-
der to evaluate the robustness of the system, we
compare our results in noise to our results in clean
speech as this gives the best estimate of noise ro-
bustness of the features.

2.3.1 Detections in clean speech
We specify two performance measures that to-
gether indicate how useful the features are for
classification and calculate those for the features
extracted in clean speech. The usefulness for
classification is based on extraction of informa-
tive features on the one hand and neglecting non-
informative features on the other hand.

The rd gives the fraction of annotated formants
that is consistent with our detections,

rd =
#detected ∩#annotated

#annotated
(4)

We consider a detection to be consistent with
the annotation if the relative error falls within
the range of 15% (1st formant), 12% (2nd for-
mant) and 8% (3rd formant). This equals a mean
accepted error of respectively 95Hz, 316Hz and
266Hz. The range is chosen such that formants
that were considered correct by the authors ac-
cording to visual inspection were included.

The ratio spurious peaks (rsp) is a measure for
the detected formants that cannot be related to the
annotated formants. It gives the ratio between the
number of extra detected formants at the annotated
positions, and the number of annotated points,

rsp =
#detected− (#detected ∩#annotated)

#annotated
(5)

The rd and the rsp are used to compare our
results in clean speech to the annotations of the
database. The robustness of the features is not
determined with regard to the annotations but by
comparing the results to itself.

2.3.2 Precision and recall in noise
The robustness is calculated by the precision and
recall of the findings in clean speech. The pre-
cision reflects whether the extracted formants are

3 Results

3.1 Detections in clean speech

The detection rates (rd) and proportion of spuri-
ous peaks (rsp) are calculated for clean speech
with regard to the annotated formants. In clean
conditions, 90% correct detections are made for
all three speaker classes for the first formant, and
75% correct for the second and third formants.
The level of spurious peaks is found at 10%.

monic complex for male, female and child speak-
ers in pink noise. For male speakers more har-
monic complexes are missed and more octave er-
rors are made.

3.2 Precision in noise
In Figure 2 the precision of the findings is plot-
ted against an increasing SNR in pink noise (left
panel). Formants consistent with the ground truth
can still be extracted at negative SNR values. Per-
formance stays very high for the first formant and
remains above 75% for both the second and the
third formant.

3.3 Recall in noise
The right panel in Figure 2 shows that the recall
is high above 10dB SNR and decreases rapidly
in higher noise levels. The main reason for this is
that harmonic complexes are not, or not correctly

extracted. To provide a better insight in the re-
sults of the HC extraction stage, table 1 shows the
occurrences of HCs that are not detected and the
occurrences of HCs that exhibit an octave error in
pink noise, calculated on the f0 annotations in Hil-
lenbrand (1995).

4 Discussion

We described and tested a method to automati-
cally extract formants based on robust parts of the
acoustic signal, namely the harmonics at formant
positions. The robustness of harmonics at formant
positions allows us to develop a method to extract
similar feature values in varying SNR. Because the
harmonics have high energy levels the influence of
noise is relatively small. The energetic harmonics
provide a solid bases for the extraction of formants
that are important acoustical cues for the identifi-
cation of phonemes. With the aim of developing
a system for robust phoneme identification speech
features derived from harmonics are a good start-
ing position. We showed that it is possible to ex-
tract formant feature values over SNRs from 30dB
to -6dB in pink noise, that uses the robustness of
harmonics at formant positions in human hearing.
These initial results support the believe that har-
monic grouping can be used as a basis for speech
processing.

Recently Glaeser et al. (2010) presented a
method that robustly estimates formant positions.
In 0dB SNR they find mean relative error scores
of approximately 24%, 17% and 10%, which is
slightly worse than our results probably because it
was tested on a more challenging database. One
important difference of their method is that it is
based on the enhancement of harmonics instead of
grouping. We expect therefore that our method is
better suited for data with mixed sources such as
competing speakers.

Because the extraction of harmonic complexes
poses some unsolved problems such as misses and
octave errors we argue that the problem of the ex-
traction of harmonic complexes should be system-
atically investigated. If this problem can be solved
we have access to extremely robust features for
speech coding with the advantage that training on
a specific noise condition is not needed.

4.1 Conclusion

We showed that it is possible to develop an au-
tomatic method to extract formant feature values

over SNRs from 30dB to -6dB in pink noise, that
uses the robustness of harmonics at formant posi-
tions in human hearing. These initial results sup-
port the believe that harmonic grouping can be
used as a basis for speech processing.
