Abstract

We investigate the problem of sentence-level
supporting argument detection from relevant
documents for user-specified claims. A dataset
containing claims and associated citation ar-
ticles is collected from online debate web-
site idebate.org. We then manually label
sentence-level supporting arguments from the
documents along with their types as STUDY,
FACTUAL, OPINION, or REASONING. We fur-
ther characterize arguments of different types,
and explore whether leveraging type informa-
tion can facilitate the supporting arguments
detection task. Experimental results show
that LambdaMART (Burges, 2010) ranker that
uses features informed by argument types
yields better performance than the same ranker
trained without type information.

1 Introduction

Argumentation plays a crucial role in persuasion
and decision-making processes. An argument usu-
ally consists of a central claim (or conclusion) and
several supporting premises. Constructing argu-
ments of high quality would require the inclusion
of diverse information, such as factual evidence
and solid reasoning (Rieke et al., 1997; Park and
Cardie, 2014). For instance, as shown in Figure 1,
the editor on idebate.org – a Wikipedia-style
website for gathering pro and con arguments on
controversial issues, utilizes arguments based on
study, factual evidence, and expert opinion to sup-
port the anti-gun claim “legally owned guns are
frequently stolen and used by criminals”. How-
ever, it would require substantial human effort to
collect information from diverse resources to sup-
port argument construction. In order to facilitate
this process, there is a pressing need for tools that
can automatically detect supporting arguments.

To date, most of the argument mining research
focuses on recognizing argumentative components

- A June 2013 IOM report states that “almost all guns
used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal
transaction”. [study]
- Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were
stolen from US homes during property crimes (in-
cluding bulglary and car theft), a yearly average of
232,400. [factual]
- Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, . . . states, “with guns being a
product that can be easily carried away and quickly
sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the
presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimu-
lus to burglary and theft.” [expert opinion]

Figure 1: Three different types of arguments used to
support the claim “Legally owned guns are frequently
stolen and used by criminals”.

and their structures from constructed arguments
based on curated corpus (Mochales and Moens,
2011; Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Feng and Hirst,
2011; Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Nguyen and
Litman, 2016). Limited work has been done for
retrieving supporting arguments from external re-
sources. Initial effort by Rinott et al. (2015) inves-
tigates the detection of relevant factual evidence
from Wikipedia articles. However, it is unclear
whether their method can perform well on docu-
ments of different genres (e.g. news articles vs.
blogs) for detecting distinct types of supporting in-
formation.

In this work, we present a novel study on the
task of sentence-level supporting argument detec-
tion from relevant documents for a user-specified
claim. Take Figure 2 as an example: assume we
are given a claim on the topic of “banning cos-
metic surgery” and a relevant article (cited for
argument construction), we aim to automatically
pinpoint the sentence(s) (in italics) among all sen-
tences in the cited article that can be used to back
up the claim. We define such tasks as supporting
argument detection. Furthermore, another goal of

- Topic: This house would ban cosmetic surgery
- Claim: An outright ban would be easier than the
partial bans that have been enacted in some places.
- Human Constructed Argument: . . .This poten-
tially leaves difficulty drawing the line for what is al-
lowed.[1] . . .
Citation Article
[1]: “Australian State Ban Cosmetic Surgery for
Teens”
- . . . It is unfortunate that a parent would consider let-
ting a 16-year-old daughter have a breast augmenta-
tion.”
- But others worry that similar legislation, if it ever
comes to pass in the United States, would draw a
largely arbitrary line – and could needlessly restrict
some teens from procedures that would help their self-
esteem.
- Dr. Malcolm Z. Roth, director of plastic surgery at
Maimondes Medical Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. , said
he believes that some teens are intelligent and mature
enough to comprehend the risks and benefits of cos-
metic surgery.. . .

Figure 2: A typical debate motion consists of a Topic,
Claims, and Human Constructed Arguments. Citation
article is marked at the end of sentence. Our goal is to
find out supporting argument (in italics) from citation
article that can back up the given claim.

this work is to understand and characterize differ-
ent types of supporting arguments. Indeed, hu-
man editors do use different types of information
to promote persuasiveness as we will show in Sec-
tion 3. Prediction performance also varies among
different types of supporting arguments.

Given that none of the existing datasets is suit-
able for our study, we collect and annotate a cor-
pus from Idebate, which contains hundreds of de-
bate topics and corresponding claims.1 As is
shown in Figure 2, each claim is supported with
some human constructed argument, with cited ar-
ticles marked on sentence level. After careful in-
spection on the supporting arguments, we propose
to label them as STUDY, FACTUAL, OPINION, or
REASONING. Substantial inter-annotator agree-
ment rate is achieved for both supporting argu-
ment labeling (with Cohen’s κ of 0.8) and argu-
ment type annotation, on 200 topics with 621 ref-
erence articles.

Based on the new corpus, we first carry out
a study on characterizing arguments of different
types via type prediction. We find that arguments

of STUDY and FACTUAL tend to use more con-
crete words, while arguments of OPINION contain
more named entities of person names. We then in-
vestigate whether argument type can be leveraged
to assist supporting argument detection. Experi-
mental results based on LambdaMART (Burges,
2010) show that utilizing features composite with
argument types achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank
(MRR) score of 57.65, which outperforms an un-
supervised baseline and the same ranker trained
without type information. Feature analysis also
demonstrates that salient features have signifi-
cantly different distribution over different argu-
ment types.

For the rest of the paper, we summarize related
work in Section 2. The data collection and anno-
tation process is described in Section 3, which is
followed by argument type study (Section 4). Ex-
periment on supporting argument detection is pre-
sented in Section 5. We finally conclude in Sec-
tion 6.

2 Related Work

Our work is in line with argumentation min-
ing, which has recently attracted significant re-
search interest. Existing work focuses on argu-
ment extraction from news articles, legal docu-
ments, or online comments without given user-
specified claim (Moens et al., 2007; Palau and
Moens, 2009; Mochales and Moens, 2011; Park
and Cardie, 2014). Argument scheme classifi-
cation is also widely studied (Biran and Ram-
bow, 2011; Feng and Hirst, 2011; Rooney et al.,
2012; Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Al Khatib et al.,
2016), which emphasizes on distinguishing differ-
ent types of arguments. To the best of our knowl-
edge, none of them studies the interaction between
types of arguments and their usage to support a
user-specified claim. This is the gap we aim to fill.

3 Data and Annotation

We rely on data from idebate.org, where hu-
man editors construct paragraphs of arguments, ei-
ther supporting or opposing claims under contro-
versial topics. We also extract textual citation arti-
cles as source of information used by editors dur-
ing argument construction. In total we collected
383 unique debates, out of which 200 debates are
randomly selected for study. After removing in-
valid ones, our final dataset includes 450 claims

STUDY: Results and discoveries, usually quantita-
tive, as a result of some research investment.
FACTUAL: Description of some occurred events or
facts, or chapters in law or declaration.
OPINION: Quotes from some person or group, ei-
ther direct or indirect. It usually contains subjective,
judgemental and evaluative languages, and might re-
flect the position or stance of some entity.
REASONING: Logical structures. It usually can be
further broken down into causal or conditional sub-
structures.

and 621 citation articles with about 53,000 sen-
tences.
Annotation Process. As shown in Figure 2, we
first annotate which sentence(s) from a citation
articles is used by the editor as supporting argu-
ments. Then we annotate the type for each of them
as STUDY, FACTUAL, OPINION, or REASONING,
based on the scheme in Table 1.2 For instance, the
highlighted supporting argument in Figure 2 is la-
beled as REASONING.

Two experienced annotators were hired to iden-
tify supporting arguments by reading through the
whole cited article and locating the sentences that
best match the reference human constructed argu-
ment. This task is rather complicated since hu-
man do not just repeat or directly quote the origi-
nal sentences from citation articles, they also para-
phrase, summarize, and generalize. For instance,
the original sentence is “The global counterfeit
drug trade, a billion-dollar industry, is thriving in
Africa”, which is paraphrased to “This is exploited
by the billion dollar global counterfeit drug trade”
in human constructed argument.

The annotators were asked to annotate indepen-
dently, then discuss and resolve disagreements and
give feedback about current scheme. We compute
inter-annotator agreement based on Cohen’s κ for
both supporting arguments labeling and argument
type annotation. For supporting arguments we
have a high degree of consensus, with Cohen’s κ
ranges from 0.76 to 0.83 in all rounds and 0.80
overall. For argument type annotation, we achieve
Cohen’s κ of 0.61 for STUDY, 0.75 for FACTUAL,
0.71 for OPINION, and 0.29 for REASONING3

2We end up with the four-type scheme as a trade-off be-
tween complexity and its coverage of the arguments.

3Many times annotators have different interpretation on
REASONING, and frequently label it as OPINION. This results

PERCENTAGE OF EACH DOMAIN TYPE
Organization

Blog Reference

Figure 3: For each supporting argument type, from
left to right shows the percentage of domain names of
organizations, scientific, blog, and reference. We do
not display statistics for news, because news articles
take the same portion in all types (about 50%).

Statistics. In total 995 sentences are identified as
supporting arguments. Among those, 95 (9.55%)
are labeled as STUDY, 497 (49.95%) as FACTUAL,
363 (36.48%) as OPINION, and 40 (4.02%) as
REASONING.

We further analyze the source of the supporting
arguments. Domain names of the citation articles
are collected based on their URL, and then cat-
egorized into “news”, “organization”, “scientific”,
“blog”, “reference”, and others, according to a tax-
onomy provided by Alexa4 with a few edits to fit
our dataset. News articles are the major source
for all types, which account for roughly 50% for
each. We show the distribution of other four types
in Figure 3. Arguments of STUDY and REASON-
ING are mostly from “scientific” websites (14.9%
and 22.9%), whereas “organization” websites con-
tribute a large portion of arguments of FACTUAL
(18.5%) and OPINION (16.7%).

4 A Study On Argument Type Prediction

Here we characterize arguments of different types
based on diverse features under the task of predict-
ing argument types. Supporting arguments identi-
fied from previous section are utilized for experi-
ments. We also leverage the learned classifier in
this section to label the sentences that are not sup-
porting arguments, which will be used for support-
ing argument detection in the next section. Four
major types of features are considered.
Basic Features. We calculate frequencies of un-
igram and bigram words, number of four major
types of part-of-speech tags (verb, noun, adjective,
and adverb), number of dependency relations, and

in a low agreement for REASONING.

number of seven types of named entities (Chin-
chor and Robinson, 1997).
Sentiment Features. We also compute number
of positive, negative and neutral words in MPQA
lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), and number of words
from a subset of semantic categories from General
Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966).5

Discourse Features. We use the number of dis-
course connectives from the top two levels of Penn
Discourse Tree Bank (Prasad et al., 2007).
Style Features. We measure word attributes for
their concreteness (perceptible vs. conceptual),
valence (or pleasantness), arousal (or intensity of
emotion), and dominance (or degree of control)
based on the lexicons collected by Brysbaert et al.
(2014) and Warriner et al. (2013).

We utilize Log-linear model for argument type
prediction with one-vs-rest setup. Three baselines
are considered: (1) random guess, (2) majority
class, and (3) unigrams and bigrams as features
for Log-linear model. Identified supporting argu-
ments are used for experiments, and divided into
training set (50%), validation set (25%) and test
set (25%). From Table 2, we can see that Log-
linear model trained with all features outperforms
the ones trained with ngram features. To further
characterize arguments of different types, we dis-
play sample features with significant different val-
ues in Figure 4. As can be seen, arguments of
STUDY and FACTUAL tend to contain more con-
crete words and named entities. Arguments of
OPINION mention more person names, which im-
plies that expert opinions are commonly quoted.

5 Supporting Argument Detection

We cast the sentence-level supporting argument
detection problem as a ranking task.6 Features

topic to various degrees. We focus on detecting the most rel-
evant ones, and thus treat it as a ranking problem instead of a

in Section 4 are also utilized here as “Sentence
features” with additional features considering the
sentence position in the article. We further employ
features that measure similarity between claims
and sentences, and the composite features that
leverage argument type information.

Similarity Features. We compute similarity be-
tween claim and candidate sentence based on TF-
IDF and average word embeddings. We also con-
sider ROUGE (Lin, 2004), a recall oriented met-
ric for summarization evaluation. In particular,
ROUGE-L, a variation based on longest common
subsequence, is computed by treating claim as
reference and each candidate sentence as sample
summary. In similar manner we use BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002), a precision oriented metric.

Composite Features. We adopt composite fea-
tures to study the interaction of other features with
type of the sentence. Given claim c and sentence
s with any feature mentioned above, a composite
feature function φM(type, feature)(s, c) is set
to the actual feature value if and only if the
argument type matches. For instance, if the
ROUGE-L score is 0.2, and s is of type STUDY,
then φM(study, ROUGE)(s, c) = 0.2
φM(factual, ROUGE)(s, c), φM(opinion, ROUGE)(s, c),

φM(reasoning, ROUGE)(s, c) are all set to 0.

Table 3: Supporting argument detection results.
Comp(type, Sen) stands for composite features of
argument type and sentence features, similarly for
Comp(type,Simi). Comp(type,Claim) represents com-
posite features of type and claim features. Results that
are statistically significantly better than all three base-
lines are marked with ∗ (paired t-test, p < 0.05).

We choose LambdaMART (Burges, 2010) for
experiments, which is shown to be successful for
many text ranking problems (Chapelle and Chang,
2011). Our model is evaluated by Mean Recipro-
cal Rank (MRR) and Normalized Discounted Cu-
mulative Gain (NDCG) using 5-fold cross valida-
tion. We compare to TFIDF and Word embedding
similarity baselines, and LambdaMART trained
with ngrams (unigrams and bigrams).

Results in Table 3 show that using com-
posite features with argument type information
(Comp(type, Sen) + Comp(type, Simi)) can im-
prove the ranking performance. Specifically, the
best performance is achieved by adding composite
features to sentence features, similarity features,
and ngram features. As can be seen, supervised
methods outperform unsupervised baseline meth-
ods. And similarity features have similar perfor-
mance as those baselines. The best performance is
achieved by combination of sentence features, N-
grams, similarity, and two composite types, which
is boldfaced. Feature sets that significantly outper-
form all three baselines are marked with ∗.

For feature analysis, we conduct t-test for in-
dividual feature values between supporting argu-
ments and the others. We breakdown features
according to their argument types and show top
salient composite features in Table 4. For all sen-
tences of type STUDY, relevant ones tend to con-
tain more “percentage” and more concrete words.
We also notice those sentences with more hedging
words are more likely to be considered. For sen-
tences of FACTUAL, position of sentence in article

composition with different types. The number of ∗
stands for the p-value based on t-test between support-
ing argument sentences and the others after Bonferroni
correction. From one ∗ to four, the p-value scales as:
0.05, 1e-3, 1e-5, and 1e-10. When mean value of sup-
porting argument sentences is larger, ↑ is used; other-
wise, ↓ is displayed. Number of arrows represents the
ratio of the larger value over smaller one. “-” indicates
no significant difference.

plays an important role, as well as their similarity
to the claim based on ROUGE scores. For type
OPINION, unlike all other types, position of sen-
tence seems to be insignificant. As we could imag-
ine, opinionated information might scatter around
the whole documents. For sentences of REASON-
ING, the ones that can be used as supporting argu-
ments tend to be less concrete and less emotional,
as opposed to opinion.

6 Conclusion

We presented a novel study on the task of
sentence-level supporting argument detection
from relevant documents for a user-specified
claim. Based on our newly-collected dataset, we
characterized arguments of different types with a
rich feature set. We also showed that leveraging
argument type information can further improve the
performance of supporting argument detection.
