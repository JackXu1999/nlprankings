Abstract

Recent research has shown that MT-based
sentence alignment is a robust approach
for noisy parallel texts. However, using
Machine Translation for sentence align-
ment causes a chicken-and-egg problem:
to train a corpus-based MT system, we
need sentence-aligned data, and MT-based
sentence alignment depends on an MT
system. We describe a bootstrapping ap-
proach to sentence alignment that resolves
this circular dependency by computing an
initial alignment with length-based meth-
ods. Our evaluation shows that itera-
tive MT-based sentence alignment signifi-
cantly outperforms widespread alignment
approaches on our evaluation set, with-
out requiring any linguistic resources other
than the to-be-aligned bitext.

1 Introduction

Given a parallel text, i.e. the same text in two (or
more) languages, aligning the different language
versions on a sentence level is a necessary first step
for corpus-based machine translation (e.g. statisti-
cal MT (SMT) or example-based MT), but also for
building translation memories from existing paral-
lel texts or other forms of multilingual analysis.
Some parallel texts can be aligned with compara-
tive ease. Parliamentary Proceedings such as Eu-
roparl or the Canadian Hansards, which are fre-
quently used for MT, provide markup information
to identify the different speakers; such markup
information provides useful anchor points for an
alignment, and allows for accuracies above 95%
(Gale and Church, 1993).

However, sentence alignment is significantly

harder for other texts, as will be illustrated in sec-
tion 3. Since SMT systems depend on relevant
training data for their performance, it is not suf-
ficient to only use easily accessible and alignable
texts as training material for SMT systems; ide-
ally, SMT systems should be trained on texts that
are similar to those one wishes to translate. This
warrants continued research on more robust sen-
tence alignment algorithms.

Bleualign is a sentence alignment algorithm
that, instead of computing an alignment between
the source and target text directly, bases its align-
ment search on an MT translation of the source
text. It has been shown that Bleualign can ro-
bustly align texts for which other algorithms per-
form poorly (Sennrich and Volk, 2010). The qual-
ity of sentence alignment has an effect on the per-
formance of SMT systems (Lambert et al., 2010),
but high quality is also desirable for other pur-
poses, e.g. when building a translation memory
from a text corpus. The main disadvantage of an
MT-based algorithm is that it requires an existing
MT system. For resource-poor language pairs, this
requirement makes the algorithm unattractive.

We have investigated the bootstrapping of MT-
based sentence alignment with an MT system
trained on the to-be-aligned corpus. For this first
MT system, a length-based sentence alignment al-
gorithm is used which requires no linguistic re-
sources. Such an iterative approach can supersede
the dependence of the algorithm on existing MT
systems.

(Sennrich and Volk, 2010) have demonstrated
that the sentence alignment quality of their MT-
based algorithm depends on the quality of the MT
system. If we can produce a superior MT system
using Bleualign, it is worthwhile to test if the re-
sulting MT system can in turn be used for an even

better sentence alignment.

2 Related Work

The first sentence alignment algorithms by (Brown
et al., 1991) and (Gale and Church, 1993) are
based on a length-comparison between source and
target text and work without language-specific in-
formation.1 A second strand of sentence align-
ment algorithms work with lexical correspon-
dences. This is either done on the basis of cor-
respondence rules (Simard et al., 1993), with ex-
ternal dictionaries (Varga et al., 2005), or using a
translation model trained on the parallel text it-
self (Moore, 2002; Varga et al., 2005). The lat-
ter requires a preliminary sentence alignment of
the parallel text, usually performed with a length-
based algorithm. After this first pass, a translation
model can be trained (e.g. an IBM Model 1 in the
case of (Moore, 2002), a dictionary-based transla-
tion model in (Varga et al., 2005)), which is then
used for the alignment in a second pass.

(Sennrich and Volk, 2010) describe an align-
ment algorithm based on the automatic transla-
tion of one language portion of the parallel text.
They use existing MT systems to translate the to-
be-aligned parallel text, then try to find an align-
ment between the translated source text and the
target text that maximizes the BLEU score. Since
sentence alignment is required to build an SMT
system, being dependent on existing MT systems
for sentence alignment causes a chicken-and-egg
problem.

Circular dependencies as the one relating to
MT-based sentence alignment are a well-known
problem, for instance for word alignment. Word
translation probabilities can only be estimated
from a word-aligned parallel text, and to word-
align the parallel text, we need a translation model.
Brown et al. (Brown et al., 1993) use an it-
erative Expectation-Maximization algorithm for
word alignment in the still widely-used IBM mod-
els.

In this paper, we investigate if the algorithm
lends itself to an iterative approach similar in spirit
to the one by (Brown et al., 1993), in order to
avoid the dependency on pre-existing MT systems

1To be precise, Gale & Church’s algorithm does contain
a priori probabilities for deletions and insertions estimated
from the Canadian Hansards (Gale and Church, 1993). How-
ever, these parameters are usually left untouched (Danielsson
and Ridings, 1997).

for sentence alignment2, while obtaining equal or
better results.

3 The Parallel Text

We conduct our experiments on the parallel part of
the Text+Berg corpus, a collection of Alpine texts
(Volk et al., 2010). As of now, the collection con-
sists of the yearbooks of the Swiss Alpine Club
from 1864 to 1995. Since 1957, the yearbook has
been published in two parallel editions, German
and French. This results in about 3 million tokens
of parallel text which can be used for Statistical
Machine Translation.

The Text+Berg corpus is characterized by its
thematic homogeneity. The topic of most if not all
texts are the mountains. However, there is a wide
range of text types represented in the corpus. We
will illustrate this with some examples from the
1975 yearbook. Most typical are reports on moun-
tain expeditions: Schreckhorn-Nordwand im Win-
ter (English: Schreckhorn North Face in winter).
We also find poems (one called Praise of Nature,
one on the alphorn), a historical account on the ex-
termination and reintroduction of ibex in the Swiss
Alps, and articles that capture current trends or
innovations, such as Segelflieger im Gebirge (En-
glish: Gliders in the Mountains). Recurring arti-
cles include chronicles of Himalaya expeditions,
and scientific reports on the periodic variations of
the glaciers in the Swiss Alps.

The corpus poses interesting challenges for Ma-
chine Translation. The terminology used in the
text is very specific and is translated badly by
SMT systems trained on out-of-domain data. In
a set of 1000 Text+Berg sentences, 11% of to-
kens, or 31.4% of types, are out-of-vocabulary
items for a SMT system trained on the Europarl
corpus. These unseen words can be roughly di-
vided into the following categories: named enti-
ties (Nadelhorn; Selbstsanft), domain-specific vo-
cabulary (Pickel, English: pick-axe; Basislager,
English: base camp), Swiss spelling variations
(gross instead of groß, English: big), and OCR er-
rors (iweimal instead of zweimal, English: twice).
Of course, we can expect a certain proportion
of unseen words in any text, especially in Ger-
man, where compounds and inflected word forms
abound3. Domain-specific vocabulary is the most

2We use open source tools to build the SMT systems; we
do not, however, use any training data other than the parallel
text we wish to align.

prevalent category in the list of unseen words, and
is the strongest reason for adapting MT systems
to new domains with in-domain training data –
not only to reduce the number of unseen words,
but also to learn domain-specific translations of
polysemous terms. For instance, the German
term Führer is usually translated into French as
dirigeant in Europarl (English: leader), but as
guide in Text+Berg.

Aligning the Text+Berg corpus on a sentence
level is surprisingly difficult. The texts are aligned
semi-automatically on an article level. Within
each article, there are no reliable structural mark-
ers: the number of paragraphs is different for the
two language versions; page breaks are at different
places in the text. With an average article length
of approximately 200 sentences (which is about 6
pages of text), the search space for possible align-
ments is significantly larger than for the small seg-
ments in Europarl which are delimited by com-
mentary tags.

Additionally, the ratio of 1-to-1 aligned sen-
tences (We will subsequently call any n-to-m
alignment a bead) is very low in the articles which
we manually aligned for evaluation purposes. Out
of the 422 beads found in a manually aligned arti-
cle, only 58.3% are 1-to-1 beads. This is a striking
contrast to earlier publications on the topic of sen-
tence alignment, which reported on texts with over
90% 1-to-1 beads (Manning and Schütze, 1999).
In the hand-aligned article, 19.5% of the beads are
1-to-2 or 2-to-1, 9.7% deletions (0-to-1 or 1-to-0),
and the remaining 12.6% beads of higher order (2-
to-2, 1-to-many, many-to-1, many-to-many).

The two main reasons for the low number of 1-
to-1 beads are the joining or splitting of sentences
by the translators, and errors in the digitization of
the corpus. The 1-to-4 bead shown in table 1 is
an example of a German sentence being split up
into several French ones. In the article we hand-
aligned, the translator frequently splits or joins
sentences in this way. We cannot claim that the
article is representative of the whole corpus, how-
ever, hence we do not exactly know how pervasive
this problem is4. Other 1-to-many alignments are
artifacts of the digitization process, e.g. OCR, to-
kenization, or sentence boundary detection errors.

In summary, sentence alignment is considerably
more difficult for the Text+Berg corpus than e.g.

a Europarl test set, with a Europarl training set.
4In a independent hand-aligned set of 1000 sentences by

various authors, we found 74% 1-to-1 alignments.

for Europarl, both because there are few anchor
points, and because the number of 1-to-1 beads is
low.

4 Iterative Sentence Alignment

Technically, iterative sentence alignment is sim-
ple, given freely available tools for SMT and sen-
tence alignment. Each iteration consists of the fol-
lowing steps:

1. Sentence-align the parallel training corpus.

• In the first iteration, use an implementa-
tion of the Gale & Church algorithm (or
any other sentence alignment tool that
does not require additional resources).
• In all subsequent iterations:

– Automatically translate the corpus
using the SMT system trained in the
last iteration.

– Align the texts using Bleualign and
this translation.

2. Train an SMT system on the sentence-aligned
corpus.

The language model needs only be trained once;
we use SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The SMT sys-
tem is built with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)
and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). The most time-
consuming part of each iteration is typically the
automatic translation of the training set.

In the remainder of this section, we will discuss
how the alignment algorithm works, and what po-
tential problems the iterative approach brings.

4.1 The Sentence Alignment Algorithm
The sentence alignment algorithm, first described
in (Sennrich and Volk, 2010), is a two-pass ap-
proach. In the first pass, dynamic programming
is used to find a set of 1-to-1 beads that maxi-
mizes BLEU score in the document without violat-
ing the monotonic order of sentence pairs. In the
second pass, unaligned sentences are either added
to beads found in the first pass (if warranted by
increasing BLEU scores), aligned using a length-
based algorithm (if possible without violating the
monotonic order of sentence pairs), or discarded.

It was shown that the algorithm is very sensitive
to the quality of the automatic translation (Sen-
nrich and Volk, 2010). If no translation is pro-
vided, performance is actually worse than if the
texts are aligned using the algorithm by Gale &

Church. This may happen if the BLEU-based first
pass yields wrong beads, for instance if there are
recurring names or dates.

4.2 Pruning

Let us consider the effect of misaligned sentence
pairs. With the word alignment and phrase extrac-
tion algorithms that the Moses system uses, wrong
phrase translations will be learned if sentences are
misaligned. Such wrong phrase translations are
normal in SMT, and usually not a big problem.
For frequent phrases, every wrong phrase transla-
tion tends to be much rarer (and thus less proba-
ble) than correct ones. Rare phrases that are mis-
translated are unlikely to occur again in the to-be-
translated text.

Unfortunately, this last point does not hold true
for an iterative approach where the training text
is also the to-be-translated text. The type Al-
bertEggler, an artifact caused by OCR, only oc-
curs once in the Text+Berg corpus. It is part of
the sentence - AlbertEggler :, which is misaligned
in the first sentence alignment pass to the sen-
tence 1954 , Helmut Heuberger en géographie ;.
Consequently, the training algorithm estimates via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation that the phrase
- AlbertEggler : is translated to 1954 , Helmut
Heuberger en géographie ; with a probability of
1.5 Hence, the sentence is mistranslated during
the next iteration. The problem is that such mis-
translations may cause the same alignment errors
to be made in subsequent iterations.

In order to prevent random misalignments to

quences in SMT, without syntactic implications. In this case,
the whole sentence is treated as a single phrase by the SMT
system.

be fossilized, we prune the translation model us-
ing the approach by (Johnson et al., 2007). The
pruning is based on computing whether the co-
occurrence frequency of phrase pairs in the trans-
lation model is statistically significant, or to be
expected by chance. All phrase pairs whose sig-
nificance value fall below a predefined threshold
are discarded. We chose the significance thresh-
old α+ �, which among others discards all phrase
pairs that co-occur only once.6

5 Evaluation

For the evaluation of alignment quality, we man-
ually aligned an article consisting of 468 and
554 sentences (German and French, respectively).
This manual alignment serves as a gold standard
to which the automatic sentence alignments will
be compared. The alignment test set is a subset
of the training set. This unusual choice was made
because it mirrors the conditions of the iterative
approach: the text that is to be translated serves as
training set for the SMT system, which potentially
causes errors (see section 4.2). To test whether
pruning mitigates the problem, we will perform
the evaluation both with and without pruning.

Because of the high proportion of 1-to-many
alignments, we will use two different truth condi-
tions, which are evaluated on a per-alignment ba-
sis. Under the strict truth condition, we demand an
exact match between the gold alignment and the
hypothesis. Under the lax condition, a hypothesis
is true if there is an overlap with a gold alignment
on both language sides. This means that a 2-to-
2 alignment that is misrecognized as two 1-to-1

alignments will count as two false positives under
the strict condition, but two true positives under
the lax condition.

While sentence alignment may serve various
goals, our main interest is using the aligned cor-
pus for SMT, and obtaining better translation sys-
tems from better-aligned corpora. Hence, we mea-
sure translation performance of all SMT systems
trained through BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).
The systems, built with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002),
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and Moses (Koehn
et al., 2007), will be evaluated on a test set of 1000
sentences, held-out from training. The training
set consists of 3 300 000 German and 3 740 000
French tokens, measured before sentence align-
ment.7 We test translation performance in the di-
rection DE–FR, and use a language model trained
on 9 511 000 tokens of in-domain text. We did
not perform Minimum Error Rate Training, which
is typically the most time-intensive step of train-
ing an SMT system, in order to limit the compu-
tational cost of the iterative approach. Statistical
significance is tested with paired bootstrap resam-
pling (Koehn, 2004).

5.1 Results
We first establish baseline scores achieved by
either using the Gale & Church algorithm or
Bleualign with an out-of-domain MT system,
shown in table 2. For a wider comparison of differ-
ent sentence alignment algorithms, see (Lambert
et al., 2010).

On the alignment test set, Gale & Church’s al-
gorithm fails almost entirely; only 1 out of 468
alignment hypotheses is correct. The reason for
the bad performance of the Gale & Church algo-
rithm in this evaluation is that errors tend to propa-
gate, since misaligned sentences may cause neigh-
bouring sentences to be misaligned as well. This
is one of the reasons why anchor points – article

ing on the number of sentences discarded during alignment,
and the number of sentence pairs filtered because of sentence
length.

boundaries in our case – are so important; they
serve as boundaries to the alignment algorithm and
stop the propagation of errors from one article to
the next.

For the iterative approach, the results obtained
by aligning the Text+Berg training corpus with
Bleualign, based on a translation of the corpus
with a SMT system trained on Europarl8, serve as
the baseline. We observe an F1 score of 69.5%
(strict condition) and 94.4% (lax condition) in the
evaluation of alignment quality. With 16.38 BLEU
points, it is significantly better in terms of MT per-
formance than the system aligned with the Gale &
Church algorithm (15.54 BLEU points).9

It might seem surprising that MT performance
of the system that is based on the Gale & Church
alignment is still acceptable, despite most align-
ments in the alignment test set being wrong. How-
ever, note that the MT quality evaluation is based
on the entire Text+Berg corpus, whereas the align-
ment quality evaluation is based on a relatively
small test set of about 500 setences; there are arti-
cles for which Gale & Church alignment performs
better. In terms of how difficult the test set is
to align, this evaluation is complementary to the
one by (Sennrich and Volk, 2010), who evaluated
alignment algorithms on a test set of seven shorter
articles. Having a difficult-to-align test set is im-
portant for the second part of our evaluation; the
high error rate of the Gale & Church algorithms
for this test set allows us to observe whether and
to what degree misalignments are self-reinforcing,
as we outlined in section 4.2.

Table 3 shows SMT and alignment performance
for each of 5 iterations. Table 4 does the same,
but before re-translating the training text, the sys-
tem is pruned according to (Johnson et al., 2007).
Note that we are interested in the effects of prun-
ing on the alignment of training data, not in the
direct effect of pruning on SMT results. This is
why even for the unpruned experiment (table 3),
we show MT results both with and without prun-
ing. The effect of pruning is especially strong in
the first iteration (which is identical to the base-
line Gale & Church system): pruning accounts for
an increase in BLEU score from 13.72 to 15.54

8Approximately 25 000 000 tokens per language for train-
ing the translation model, 47 000 000 French tokens for the
language model.

9Note that the training corpus is the same for all experi-
ments; only the alignment algorithm and the system used to
translate the corpus change between experiments.

BLEU points. In later iterations, the difference is
between 0.7 and 0.8 BLEU points.

We can see that the alignment quality improves
after each iteration in the experiment without
pruning (table 3). However, after 4 iterations, it is
still lower than in the baseline experiment with an
SMT system trained on Europarl. The systems in
the experiment with pruning reach a higher align-
ment quality, and reach it after fewer iterations.
We cannot explain this difference away through
the general quality increase through pruning. In
the third and fourth iteration without pruning, MT
performance on the held-out test set is higher than
in the first iteration with pruning. Still, the pruned
system leads to a higher alignment quality in the
subsequent iteration. We conclude that a self-
reinforcement of misalignments, as described in
section 4.2, does indeed occur if we do not prune
the SMT systems, and that pruning successfully
combats this effect.

In this experiment, an iterative alignment (with
pruning) only requires two iterations to reach a sta-
ble level both in alignment quality and SMT per-
formance. SMT performance of the second itera-
tion of the experiment with pruning is significantly
better than both baselines, and significantly bet-
ter than the fifth iteration without pruning. Com-
pared to the baseline with the Europarl SMT sys-
tem, the increase is relatively small, from 16.38 to
16.67 BLEU points. At least in this experiment,
the main advantage of the iterative approach lies
not in a performance increase, but in being inde-
pendent from external MT systems.

5.2 Interpretation and Usage
Recommendations

Having to translate the entire training corpus for
sentence alignment is a costly requirement, even
if the iterative algorithm does not rely on external
MT systems. It is thus positive that, with our SMT
tools and the well-known pruning approach by
(Johnson et al., 2007), we reach the highest qual-

ity after just two iterations, meaning that the train-
ing corpus only needs to be translated once. Still,
we do not recommend iterative sentence alignment
with Bleualign for all purposes.

Aspects worth considering for the choice of sen-
tence alignment algorithm are:

1. The accuracy of computationally less expen-
sive sentence alignment algorithms such as
Gale & Church’s on the parallel text. The
lower their accuracy, the more promising
it is to perform a sentence alignment with
Bleualign.

2. The size of the parallel text. If the amount
of parallel text is too small to train an ad-
equate MT system with it, we recommend
using Bleualign with a pre-existing MT sys-
tem or a different alignment algorithm alto-
gether. On the other hand, if the amount of
parallel text is very large, this slows down
the iterations considerably, both because of
the large amount of text to be translated and
the increase in training/decoding time result-
ing from more data. Using only a subsection
of the parallel text to build the first, non-final
SMT system will speed up the process.

3. The availability of language-specific re-
sources. Whether the recommended re-
sources are dictionaries (Varga et al., 2005),
or MT systems (Sennrich and Volk, 2010),
they might be unavailable or lacking in qual-

ity for a given alignment task. The itera-
tive sentence alignment approach described
in this paper is especially suitable for lan-
guage pairs with few existing resources.

6 Conclusion

In (Sennrich and Volk, 2010), Bleualign was es-
tablished as a well-performing sentence alignment
tool given a sufficiently good existing MT system.
In this paper, we show that a similar performance
can be achieved without the use of language-
specific resources other than the to-be-aligned par-
allel text. We do this by training an SMT sys-
tem on the to-be-aligned text, using a length-based
sentence alignment algorithm. This SMT system
is then used to translate the source side of the par-
allel training corpus; on this translation, Bleualign
bases its sentence alignment.

The biggest weakness of an iterative sentence
alignment approach is that misaligned sentences
lead to errors in the translation model, which tend
to cause the same alignment errors in the next iter-
ation. We show that pruning singleton phrase pairs
improves the quality of iterative sentence align-
ment tremendously, leading to the best results after
just two iterations.
