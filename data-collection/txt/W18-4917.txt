Abstract

Discourse analysis is necessary for different tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP). As
two of the most spoken languages in the world, discourse analysis between Spanish and
Chinese is important for NLP research. This paper aims to present the first open Spanish-
Chinese parallel corpus annotated with discourse information, whose theoretical framework is
based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). We have evaluated and harmonized each
annotation part to obtain a high annotated-quality corpus. The corpus is already available to the
public.

1 Introduction

Spanish and Chinese are two of the most spoken languages in the world; the language pair occupies an
important position in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) research world. Recently, discourse
analysis has called much attention as an unsolved problem and is crucial for many NLP tasks (Zhou et
al., 2014). The great language distance causes a great number of discourse differences between
Spanish and Chinese. Comparative or contrastive studies of discourse structures reveal information to
identify properly equivalent discourse elements in a language pair (Cao and Gete, 2018). Here we give
an example to show the discourse similarity and difference between the two languages.

2 DM means discourse marker. In this work, we use the definition of DM by Eckle-Kohler, Kluge and Gurevych (2015). DMs
are used to signal discourse relations in a text segment. Specially, the DMs in our work are traditional markers and markers
including verbal structures, as da Cunha indicates (2013).
3 In this work, we give an English literal translation for both Spanish and Chinese examples in order to make the readers
understand the content better.

[DM1 still no get results,] [DM2 we consider that the model contains the sentence group
nominal.]

1.4 Eng: Although we haven’t got the results yet, we consider that the model will be more extensive
than the nominal sentence group.

In Example 1, we can see that the Spanish passage has a similar discourse structure to the Chinese
passage. Both passages start the text with a discourse marker in the first unit. However, the usage of
discourse markers in both languages is different. To show same meaning, in Chinese, it is mandatory
to include two discourse markers: one marker is “jinguan” (尽管), at the beginning of the first unit,
and another marker is “danshi” (但是 ), at the beginning of the second unit. These two discourse
markers are equivalent to the English discourse marker ‘although’. By contrast, in Spanish, just one
discourse marker “aunque” is being used at the beginning of the first unit, and this discourse marker is
also equivalent to the English discourse marker although. Moreover, the order of the discourse units in
the Spanish passage can be changed and it makes sense syntactically, but the order cannot be changed
in the Chinese passage, because neither syntactically nor grammatically makes sense.
Additionally, as a large electronic library, a corpus can provide a large amount of linguistic

information (Wu, 2014). Therefore, this paper aims to present the first open Spanish-Chinese parallel
corpus with annotated discourse information under the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and
Thompson, 1988).
In the second section, we present the theoretical framework of this study. In the third section, we

talk about some related works. In the fourth section, we give detailed information about the research
corpus. In the fifth section, we discuss how we carry out the study by introducing different annotation
steps. In the sixth section, we evaluate the annotation results and give the qualitative analysis about the
annotation quality. In the last section, we conclude our work and look ahead at our future work.

2 Theoretical framework

The Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is a theory that was created
especially for discourse analysis. RST addresses both hierarchical and relational aspects of text
structures for discourse analysis. Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) (Marcu, 2000) and coherence
relations are established in RST. Relations are recursive in RST and are held between EDUs, which
can be Nuclei or Satellites, denoted by N and S. Satellites offer additional information about nuclei.
EDUs can be linked among them holding a nucleus-satellite (e.g. CAUSE, JUSTIFY, EVIDENCE)
function or a multinuclear (e.g. CONJUNCTION, LIST, SEQUENCE) function. As relations are
recursive, all the discourse units of the text have a function in a treelike structure, if and only if the text
is coherent.
Comparing to other discourse theory, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008),

RST focuses on the hierarchical structure of a whole text, where discourse relations can be annotated
within a sentence (intra-sentence style) and between sentences (inter-sentence style). The intra-
sentence annotation and inter-sentence annotation styles help to inform how discourse elements are
being expressed in a language.

3 State of the art

3.1 Comparative discourse study

Some previous research using RST for comparative discourse has compared Chinese and English. Cui
(1986) presents some aspects regarding discourse relations between Chinese and English; Kong (1998)
compares Chinese and English business letters; Guy (2000, 2001) compares Chinese and English
journalistic news texts. The only work that compares Spanish and Chinese using RST is by Cao, da
Cunha and Bel (2016). They explore sentences that contain the Spanish discourse marker aunque
(‘although’) and their Chinese parallel sentences in the UN subcorpus.

3.2 RST Treebanks for different languages

With the development of discourse analysis, annotated corpora with relational discourse structure
under the RST exist for several languages: (i) for English, the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson,
Marcu and Okurowski, 2001)4 and the Discourse Relations Reference Corpus (Taboada and Renkema,
2008)5; (ii) for German, the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede and Neumann, 2014)6; (iii) for
Spanish, the RST Spanish Treebank (da Cunha, Torres-Moreno and Sierra, 2011; da Cunha et al.,
2011)7; (iv) for Basque, the RST Basque Treebank (Iruskieta et al., 20138; (v) for Portuguese, the
CorpusTCC (Pardo, Nunes and Rino, 2008) and Rhetalho (Pardo and Seno, 2005)9; (vi) for Russian,
the Russian RST Treebank (Toldova et al., 2017)10.
Bilingual and multilingual RST Treebanks are not common; Iruskieta, da Cunha and Taboada,

(2015) create one of the few with the Multilingual RST Treebank11 for Spanish, Basque and English.
For Basque and Spanish, Imaz and Iruskieta (2017) establish the RST Basque-Spanish DELIB
Treebank12. To our knowledge, our corpus is the first bilingual corpus serves for the discourse analysis
between Spanish and Chinese under the RST.

4 Research corpus

There are currently few parallel Spanish-Chinese corpora. the already existing parallel corpora are: (i)
The Holy Bible (Resnik, Olsen & Diab, 1999), (ii) The United Nations Multilingual Corpus (UN)
(Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009) and (iii) Sina Weibo Parallel Corpus (Wang et al., 2013). Cao, da Cunha
and Iruskieta (2017) indicate the three corpora contain their own limitations for Spanish-Chinese
comparative discourse analysis. To carry out our work, we develop a new Spanish-Chinese parallel
corpus.
Complexity of discourse structure and heterogeneity are the main characteristics taken into account

for corpus development. The specific considerations are the following: (a) texts with different sizes
(between 100 and 2,000 words), (b) specialized texts and non-specialized texts, (c) texts from different
domains, (d) texts from different genres, (e) texts from different original publications, and (f) texts
from different authors.
Based on the mentioned aspects, finally, we selected 100 texts to form our research corpus13. The

genres of the texts are the following: (a) abstracts of research papers, (b) news, (c) advertisements, and
(d) announcements. The longest text of the corpus contains 1,774 words and the shortest one contains
111 words.
The sources of these texts are: (a) International Conference about Terminology (1997), (b) Shanghai

Miguel Cervantes Library, (c) Chamber of Commerce and Investment of China in Spain, (d) Spain
Embassy in Beijing, (e) Spain-China Council Foundation, (f) Confucius Institute Foundation in
Barcelona, (g) Beijing Cervantes Institute and (h) Granada Confucius Institute.
The corpus includes texts related to seven domains: (a) terminology (30 texts), (b) culture (12 texts),

(c) language (16 texts), (d) economy (14 texts), (e) education (8 texts), (f) art (10 texts), and (g)
international affairs (10 texts).
The corpus was enriched automatically with POS information by using the Stanford parser (Levy

and Manning, 2003) for Chinese.
Finally, we created an online interface to access the research corpus:

http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/rst/zh/. Users can search POS information, discourse segments, key
information and discourse structure of each text in the research corpus. Moreover, users can also
download the texts of the corpus.

13 Due to the limited resources that guarantee the complexity of discourse structure and heterogeneity, finally, we choose 50
Spanish texts and their translated Chinese texts (50 texts) to form the corpus.

5 Methodology

In this work, firstly, we elaborate some criteria to segment the corpus. Secondly, we annotate the
Central Unit (CU) for each text following Iruskieta et al. (2014). Lastly, we annotate the discourse
structure for each text in the corpus following Pardo (2005).

5.1 Segmentation annotation

Segmentation affects the discourse annotation quality; this makes it a crucial step for RST study. Two
notable works for Spanish segmentation from the discourse level are mentioned previously: the RST
Spanish Treebank (da Cunha, Torres-Moreno and Sierra, 2011; da Cunha et al., 2011) and the
Multilingual RST Treebank (Iruskieta, da Cunha and Taboada, 2015). Few works focus on the
Chinese segmentation from the discourse level under RST. There are three works that use form-based
criteria that use punctuation marks to elaborate segmentation rules for Chinese (Yue, 2006; Qiu, 2010;
Li, Feng and Zhou, 2013).
In our work, we elaborate the discourse segmentation criteria proposal for both Spanish and Chinese

based on linguistic function (the function of the syntactic components) and linguistic form
(punctuation category and verbs). We have not considered the meaning (of any coherence relation
between propositions) to segment EDUs to avoid circularity in the annotation process. For the function
and form perspective, we adopt the segmentation criteria from Iruskieta, da Cunha and Taboada
(2015). A Spanish-Chinese bilingual linguists and two Spanish linguists are in charge of the
segmentation for the Spanish subcorpus while the bilingual linguists and a Chinese linguists carry out
the segmentation task for the Chinese subcorpus14. The segmentation tool is the RSTTool (O’Donnell,
2000). Table 1 shows the segmentation criteria15.

5.2 Central Unit (CU) annotation

Under RST, for each segmented text, among the EDUs, there is an EDU called Central Unit (CU) that
contains the key information of the text (Iruskieta, Labaka and Desiderato, 2016).
According to van Dijk (1980), language users are able to summarize discourses, expressing the

main topics of the summarized discourse. For our work, for all the segmented texts, the annotators
decide which EDUs represent the main idea of the text. Table 2 shows the statistical information of the
segmented texts and the annotated CUs in the corpus.

14 The bilingual expert annotates all the 100 texts, each of the two Spanish experts annotate 25 Spanish texts. The Chinese
expert annotate all the 50 Chinese texts.
15 For the examples of the segmentation criteria, consult Cao et al (2017).

Table 2: Statistical information of EDUs and CUs in the corpus

A Spanish-Chinese bilingual linguist and a Spanish linguist annotate the CUs for all the Spanish
texts. The bilingual linguist and a Chinese linguist selected the CUs for all the Chinese texts.

5.3 Discourse structure annotation

Discourse structure annotation is one of the most difficult challenges for annotation works (Hovy and
Lavid, 2010). Our study adopts the intra-sentence annotation and inter-sentence annotation styles.
Figure 1 shows an annotated parallel Spanish-Chinese text16.

6 Evaluation result

6.1 Segmentation annotation evaluation

In this annotation level, we use Cohen Kappa to measure inter-annotator agreement of the segmented
discourse units18. Kappa calculates the agreement between annotators as:

� r
�nno t �nio
� t �nio

where (A) represents the current observed agreement, and P(E) represents chance agreement. Kappa
was calculated by considering titles, parentheses, and verbs, as EDUs candidates. Table 4 includes the
agreement between the annotators for the Spanish subcorpus and the Chinese subcorpus.

Corpus Source Kappa AgreementSpanish Chinese

SMCL 0.945 0.719

CIFB 0.716 0.616
BCI 0.863 0.759
GCI 0.873 0.705
Total 0.87 0.76

Table 4: Segmentation annotation agreement of the entire corpus

From Table 4, we can see that, for the Spanish subcorpus, the highest agreement between the
annotators is 0.945, and the lowest agreement is 0.716. The agreement for the whole Spanish
subcorpus is 0.87. The highest agreement result for the Chinese subcorpus is 0.815, and the lowest
agreement result is 0.616. The agreement for the entire Chinese subcorpus is 0.76. The annotation
results prove the segmentation criteria are reliable for the language pair. Based on the results, we
analyze the segmentation errors to improve the segmentation annotation quality.

6.2 Central Unit (CU) annotation evaluation

Same as the segmentation evaluation, we also use Kappa to measure the CU annotation agreement for
exact match. Table 5 shows the evaluation results of the Spanish subcorpus and Table 6 reflects the
agreement of the Chinese subcorpus.
From Table 5, we can see that for the Spanish subcorpus, the agreement is 0.961 and the agreement

is 0.977 for the Chinese subcorpus (see Table 6). The results show that the CU annotation for the
whole corpus is almost perfect.

Based on the annotation results, the annotators discuss the disagreements to confirm the correct CUs
for each text in the corpus.

6.3 Discourse structure annotation evaluation

For the discourse structure annotation evaluation, we follow a newly created qualitative method by
Iruskieta, da Cunha and Taboada (2015). Under this qualitative method, four elements are being
examined by using F-measure: Nuclearity (N), Relation (R), Composition (C) and Attachment (A). In
addition, to use this method for the discourse evaluation between two or more languages, the
comparison parts must be aligned and must contain the same number of EDUs, to avoid confusing
analysis disagreement and segmentation disagreement. The following example explains how we
follow this comparison rule by using our corpus:

Ex.2: Text name: CCICE3_ESP & CCICE3_CHN
Sp: [El jueves, el Tesoro volverá a los mercados con una subbasta de bonos y obligaciones en la que

intentará colocar entre 3.000 y 4.000 millones.]
[On Thursday, the Treasury will return to the markets with a subbase of bonds and obligations in
which it will try place between 3,000 and 4,000 million.]

Ch: [另外，财政部将在本周四再次回到市场拍卖中长期国债，] [欲拍卖 30亿至 40亿欧元。]
[In addition, the Ministry of Finance will on Thursday again return to the markets to auction of
medium-term and long-term treasury bonds,] [to auction 3 billion to 4 billion euros.]

Eng: On Thursday, the Treasury will return to the markets with a sub-base of bonds and obligations
in which it will try to place between 3,000 and 4,000 million.

From the above example, we can see the Spanish message is an interdependent EDU and its parallel
Chinese message contains three EDUs. For the qualitative comparison, Iruskieta, da Cunha and
Taboada (2015) suggest a simple rule, which is to erase the segmentation differences and get the same
number of EDUs for the parallel content. Therefore, we combine three Chinese EDUs as a discourse
unit (DU) or text span. Although the harmonization process erases some rhetorical relations, the higher
level of RS-Tree structure is not affected.
Table 7 shows the evaluation results of the original Spanish subcorpus and the original Chinese

subcorpus, meanwhile Table 8 shows the qualitative evaluation of the harmonized corpus.
From Table 7, we can conclude that in the Spanish subcorpus, the agreement of the Nuclearity is

from 0.761 to 1, the agreement of the Relation is from 0.641 to 1, the agreement of the Composition is
from 0.761 to 0.947, and the agreement of the Attachment is from 0.731 to 0.933. The annotation
evaluation results of the Chinese subcorpus shows the agreement of the Nuclearity is from 0.864 to
0.978, the agreement of the Relation is from 0.727 to 0.844, the agreement of the Composition is from
0.864 to 0.978, and the agreement of the Attachment is from 0.84 to 0.978. The evaluation results
prove that the annotation of the Spanish subcorpus and the annotation of the Chinese subcorpus are
reliable. Two aspects explain why we have the good annotation results: (i) the annotation guideline has
been discussed many times and (ii) some texts in the corpus are general publications and the discourse
structure of these texts are more simple than others.
Table 8 informs that in the harmonized corpus, the agreement of the Nuclearity is from 0.855 to 1,

the agreement of the Relation is from 0.794 to 0.923, the agreement of the Composition is from 0.855
to 1, and the agreement of the Attachment is from 0.855 to 1.The evaluation results of the harmonized
corpus are better than the original corpus because of the removal of the annotation disagreements
during the harmonized process for both Spanish subcorpus and Chinese subcorpus.
The qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation results of the harmonized corpus demonstrate

the reliability of the annotation quality. The reason that we get the good results is because of: (i)



163

Before carrying out the annotation work, we elaborate the annotation guideline, which requires the
same inter-sentence annotation process and intra-sentence annotation process, and (ii) comparing to
other annotation campaigns and texts (news, argumentation texts, scientific texts and abstracts), some
texts have a simpler discourse structure.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we present the first RST Spanish-Chinese Treebank with open access. We annotate the
discourse information for all the 100 texts by using the RSTTool. We use Kappa to evaluate the
annotation quality. The evaluation results for each annotation step show that we get an annotated
corpus with high quality. Our corpus fills an important gap for Spanish-Chinese discourse analysis.
Moreover, the corpus texts can be downloaded online. The POS information, discourse segments, CU
information and the annotations of discourse structure can also be found online.
The corpus can be used for different NLP tasks, for instance, Spanish-Chinese language learning,

evaluation of the machine translation (MT) between the two languages from the discourse level,
information retrieval, etc. In the future, we will select and annotate more Spanish-Chinese parallel
texts and will develop a protocol to help the MT for the language pair.
