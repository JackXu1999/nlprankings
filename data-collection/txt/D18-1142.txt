Abstract

Are brand names such as Nike female or male?
Previous research suggests that the sound of a
person’s first name is associated with the per-
son’s gender, but no research has tried to use
this knowledge to assess the gender of brand
names. We present a simple computational ap-
proach that uses sound symbolism to address
this open issue. Consistent with previous re-
search, a model trained on various linguistic
features of name endings predicts human gen-
der with high accuracy. Applying this model
to a data set of over a thousand commercially-
traded brands in 17 product categories, our re-
sults reveal an overall bias toward male names,
cutting across both male-oriented product cat-
egories as well as female-oriented categories.
In addition, we find variation within categories,
suggesting that firms might be seeking to im-
bue their brands with differentiating character-
istics as part of their competitive strategy.

1 Introduction
When naming humans, clear gender conventions
seem to exist in every society. For example, in
the English-speaking world, Jessica, Linda, and
Nancy are female names, while John, Michael, and
William are male names. In turn, decades of gender-
stereotyping research suggest that people associate

particular genders with particular characteristics.
For example, females are viewed as “warm,” “ex-
pressive,” and “emotional,” while males are viewed
as “assertive,” “competent,” and “rational” (Brover-
man et al., 1972; Spence and Helmreich, 1979). We
ask whether any of this applies to commercially-
traded brands, and is there a gender strategy un-
derlying brand names? If so, what does this strat-
egy say about firms’ motivations in making these
choices? Is it driven by product category char-
acteristics or is it driven by competitive strategy
considerations within each category?

In this paper, we take the first steps toward an-
swering these questions. We start by developing
a machine-learning method to predict the gender
of human first names. Large labeled data sets of
human first names are available from the U.S. and
the U.K. to train such an algorithm. Using various
linguistic features of such names—for example, “a”
ending, sonorant ending (m, n, ng, l, r), etc.—we
find that we can predict human gender quite ac-
curately (approximately 80% success rates). We
then use this algorithm to predict the masculinity-
femininity of brand names (see Figure 1). For this
purpose we have identified another data set where
a large number of brand names are available, pre-



1129

classified into many different product categories—
detergents, analgesics, health and beauty aids, elec-
tronics, etc. Finally, having classified brand names
by gender, we ask what the variation in brand name
gender, within and across product categories, can
tell us about the marketing strategy in brand name
choices. By using NLP-methods to analyze brand
names, we contribute not only a new application
domain for such methods, but also, importantly,
advance the branding literature by suggesting that
brand name gender may be part of a brand’s posi-
tioning strategy.

classifier trained on people’s names is applied to brand
names.

2 Sound symbolism and gender of names
Existing work from linguistics has suggested that
male and female names have different phonologi-
cal properties. Here we summarize gender-related
features of first names identified in the literature: 1)
Names ending in the mid-central unstressed vowel
sound ‘uh’ are almost always feminine (Lieber-
son and Bell, 1992); 2) Names ending in a vowel
tend to be feminine (Slater and Feinman, 1985); 3)
Names ending in a sonorant (m, n, ng, l, r) may
be either masculine or feminine (Barry and Harper,
1995; Lieberson and Bell, 1992; Slater and Fein-
man, 1985); 4) Names ending in a ‘fricative’ or
‘affricate’ produced by restricting airflow through
the mouth to create frication (s, z, f, v, h, sh, ch,
dj) tend to be masculine (Barry and Harper, 1995);
5) Names ending in a ‘plosive’ produced by stop-
ping airflow through the mouth (p, b, t, d, k, g)
are almost always masculine (Barry and Harper,
1995); 6) Words and names featuring fricatives are
more associated with femininity relative to those

with plosives, which are associated with masculin-
ity (Folkins and Lenrow, 1966; Guèvremont and
Grohmann, 2014; Klink, 2000); 7) The front / back
vowel distinction mirrors that of plosives and frica-
tives. Brand names with front vowels, such as “i,”
and “ee,” seem more feminine than names with
back vowels, such as “oh,” “oo” (Klink, 2000).

Despite the rich literature on sound symbolism
and gender, sparse attempts have been made to sys-
tematically examine the contribution of different
linguistic features in gender prediction of names at
scale (Bird et al., 2009). Although recent work has
examined gender issues in web-crawled data (Zhao
et al., 2017) and historical corpora (Garg et al.,
2018), there has been no study on exploiting lin-
guistic features to predict gender of brand names.

3 Computational methods
Table 1 summarizes the full set of features that we
used for modeling. We took orthographic forms
of names as a proxy for phonetic forms due to
practical scalability. We started by considering
names ending in the sound ‘uh’ as ending with the
letter ‘a’, because ‘a’ accounts for the vast majority
of instances of this sound. After this initial step, we
dummy-coded names ending in a vowel with the
letters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, and ‘y’ (i.e., any name
ending in a vowel was coded 1 on this feature,
whereas all other names were coded 0; see Table
1 for an illustration). We coded names ending in
fricatives and plosives with the letters ‘p’, ‘b’, ‘t’,
‘d’, ‘k’, ‘g’, ‘f’, ‘v’, ‘s’, ‘z’, ‘th’, ‘sh’, ‘ch’, and
‘dge’. We coded sonorant endings based on the
letters ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘ng’, ‘r’, ‘and ‘l’.

We also considered word-initial occurrences of
all the previously mentioned sounds, making sym-
metric hypotheses that word-initial vowels will pre-
dict femininity, word-initial plosives will predict
masculinity, and that sonorants and fricatives may
be predictive in some way. Coding was based on
the same letters with some minor variations (the
letters ‘w’ and ‘y’ were included with sonorants,
and the letter ‘j’ was included with fricatives).

Finally, we considered the total number of oc-
currences of all the previously mentioned sounds,
hypothesizing that the total number of vowels will
predict femininity, total number of plosives will
predict masculinity, and total number of sonorants
and fricatives may be predictive in some way. Ad-
ditionally, we consider two distinct categories of
vowels: front vowels, represented by the letters ‘i’,
and ‘e’, which we hypothesize will predict feminin-



1130

ity, and back vowels, represented by the letters ‘o’
and ‘u’, which we hypothesize will be more predic-
tive of masculinity. We excluded features such as
stressed syllable and number of syllables that have
been linked with name gender (Slater and Feinman,
1985) because they require manual coding and do
not scale. However, we considered total number of
letters as a proxy for name length.

brand names, with example values for Linda.

We used three simple models for name gender
classification based on the features we have de-
scribed. For all methods, we considered binary
classification (female/male) and excluded “gender-
neutral” names that are ambiguous. 1) To exam-
ine how each feature contributes to name gen-
der prediction individually, we first considered
a single-feature logistic model that determines
gender of a name y from one of the features x:
log p(y=female)p(y=male) = β0 + β1x. 2) To examine how
features combine to name gender prediction, we
considered a multivariate version of the logistic
model. We applied a sparsity constraint with au-
tomatic relevance determination (Yamashita et al.,
2008) to explore the minimal set of features neces-
sary for gender determination, taking into account
the fact that the features are over-complete and
not interdependent, e.g. “a ending” entails “vowel
ending.” We used the default settings on the hyper-
parameters in the open-source Python package. 1

3) We considered random forest as an alternative
multivariate classifier, based on decision trees us-
ing the Gini impurity criterion and bootstrapped
subsamples in ensemble averaging. We used the
Python sklearn package for this model.

4 Data
We draw data from three primary sources, two
for people’s names and one for brand names.
For people’s names, we relied on databases
of U.S. and U.K. names available at https:
//github.com/OpenGenderTracking/
globalnamedata/tree/master/assets.
The U.S. data come from the yearly birth records
maintained by the U.S Social Security Administra-
tion from 1880 to 2013; the U.K. data come from
the UK Office of National Statistics, the Northern
Ireland Statistics and Research Administration,
and the Scotland General Register Office. After
removing names that are labeled as both male and
female, we ended up with 97102 unique English
names (60984 female, 36118 male) to work with.
For brand names, we relied on Kantar Media’s
Stradegy database. This database documents U.S.
advertising spending by brands in virtually every
product category. 2 In this case, after removing
multi-word names that are derivative brands (e.g.,
Ford Escort) and a small number (66) of names that
are common English words (e.g., Coach) based
on the ∼5000 most frequent words in the British
National Corpus, 3 we ended up with 1021 brand
names in 17 product categories. We represented
each name as a 16-dimensional vector based on the
features described, and we made all data available
in the supplementary materials.

5 Results
Evaluation. We tested all gender classifiers on the
English dataset in a supervised setting. Table 2
summarizes the model performances in a five-fold
cross validation with the data initially randomized.

Overall, all models predicted gender of people’s
names substantially above chance (50%). In partic-
ular, the multivariate models performed better than
the single-feature model though the difference is
small, suggesting that gender information is likely
encoded in a restricted set of features. Figure 2
confirms this finding by showing the fitted weights
on different features from the sparse logistic classi-
fier. The top four features with the highest weights
are “a ending,” “plosive ending,” “sonorant ending,”
and “fricative ending,” suggesting the dominance
of gender information in the ending of names. The
same four features also yielded the highest predic-
tive accuracies in the single-feature model except
for the feature of “vowel ending” - 75.1%: a end-

Figure 2: Feature coefficients in logistic regression.

We observed a small difference in predictive ac-
curacy between the random forest model and the
sparse logistic model, suggesting the features are
relatively robust to classifier variation. We also
observed that predictive accuracies on male names
tend to be poorer than those on female names, possi-
bly because some male names also end with vowels
27.1%, e.g., Joshua), but female names predomi-
nantly end with vowels 76.4%).

Brand name gender prediction. We applied
the three classifiers to the brand name database,
by using the weights estimated from the English
name database. We used a conservative criterion in
determining gender of brand names. In particular,
we took majority vote from prediction of the three
classifiers for any given brand name as opposed to
relying on prediction from a single classifier. 4

Although it is difficult to fully evaluate the ac-
curacy of our classifiers on brand name gender,
we identified “true” gender of a small set of brand
names where etymology can be found from the
Oxford English Dictionary, summarized in Table 3.
We found that our procedure of gender classifica-
tion yielded an accuracy of 83.3% on this small set,
which is consistent with the accuracies we obtained

4We also considered a more stringent criterion by analyz-
ing only the subset of brand names where all three classifiers
agreed on gender prediction (N = 702 out of 1021 names),
and our results are similar based on that subset of brand names.

with people’s names. We refrained from evaluat-
ing our models against human judgments on brand
name gender, because people’s conceptions might
be biased or primed given the products associated
with brands (e.g., cosmetic brand names might be
perceived as female). Figure 3 visualizes the brand
names in the feature space we considered, with
predicted gender and annotated example brands.

Brand name gender distribution. We ana-
lyzed gender distributions across and within the 17
product categories. Across categories, we observed
a strong asymmetry in frequency between male and
female brand names. The scatter-plot in Figure 3
illustrates that male and female brand names sep-
arate in sound-attribute space. tSNE (Maaten and
Hinton, 2008) with 17 feature attributes was used
to generate this plot, which shows that male and
female names separate along the first dimension,
but not in the second dimension. This suggests that
these names share commonalities, but they are also
different.

We observed that the gross number of male
brand names is significantly greater than the num-
ber of female brand names (binomial p < 0.0001).
Several factors could contribute to this bias. For
example, many present-day brands originated long
before gender equality was valued, and the brand
names that emerged from these male-dominated
eras tend to skew masculine. It should also be
noted that many brands are named after company
founders (e.g., Ford), and surnames may tend to be
more masculine than first names.

A more fine-grained analysis in the individual
product categories revealed nuanced patterns in
gender distribution (Figure 3). Although the male
bias we observed at the broad level applies to 14
of 17 categories (binomial p < 0.0001) including
some intuitive ones such as “power tools,” “mil-
itary,” and “baseball equipment,” this bias is sur-
prisingly weak or non-existent in “car / trucks” and
“men haircare” where we expect more male as op-
posed to female consumers. Second, brands where



1132

we expect more female consumers such as “jew-
elry,” “cosmetics,” and “womens underwear” have
a relatively high proportion of male-oriented names.
These patterns suggest that although male brand
names might be an overall preferred convention,
gender-polarized brands might have adopted a re-
versal strategy in naming with the opposite gender.

6 Discussion
While the notion of brand name gender is an intrigu-
ing concept in theory, its practical measurement has
proved elusive. This paper has shown that NLP-
methods can be used fruitfully to get a handle on
this problem. Our results suggest that brand names
are more male-oriented than female-oriented over-
all. However, under this broad result, there are
several interesting nuances. First, the overall pref-
erence for male names applies not only in cate-
gories that are primarily male-oriented, but also in
some categories that are primarily female-oriented.
Second, there is considerable within-category vari-
ation in brand name gender. Understanding these
nuances is an important topic for future research.
