Abstract. This paper describes our experience using available linguistic resources for Croatian in
order to address data sparseness when building an English-to-Croatian general domain phrase-
based statistical machine translation system. We report the results obtained with factored translation
models and morphological expansion, highlight the impact of the algorithm used for tagging
the corpora, and show that the improvement brought by these methods is compatible with the
application of data selection on out-of-domain parallel corpora.

Keywords: data sparseness, factored translation models, morphological expansion

1 Introduction

Data sparseness is a well-known problem that phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) systems suffer from when dealing with highly inflected languages, especially
when the highly inflected one is the target language (TL). In these kinds of languages, a
single word (lemma) can have dozens of different inflected forms. Translation perfor-
mance is hampered because it is difficult to observe all the forms of a given word (in the
different contexts relevant for translation) in the training corpus.

This paper is part of the Abu-MaTran project, where we aim to provide machine
translation support to Croatian, as the official language of a new EU country. Croatian
is a highly inflected language and hence it is affected by data sparseness. For instance,
adjectives inflect for 3 genders, 2 numbers and 7 cases and the hrLex Croatian inflectional
lexicon (Ljubešić et al, 2016b) contains 939 unique morphosyntactic description tags.
In this paper, we show how we dealt with that problem in a general-domain English-
to-Croatian phrase-based SMT system by leveraging a Croatian inflectional lexicon
and adapting existing solutions in the literature, namely factored translation models

(Koehn and Hoang, 2007) and morphological expansion (Turchi and Ehrmann, 2011).
Sections 2 and 3 respectively describe these solutions, while Section 4 shows that they
can be successfully combined with a data selection strategy. The paper ends with a brief
description of related approaches and some concluding remarks and future directions.

2 Factored translation models

Factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) split the translation of words in
the translation of different factors (surface forms, lemmas, lexical categories, morphosyn-
tactic information, etc.). Among the different ways these factors can be combined, we
opted for producing a surface form factor and a morphosyntactic description (MSD)
factor for each word in the output, and used two different language models (LMs), one
operating on surface forms and another one on MSDs. This setup has been reported to
be effective (and efficient in terms of decoding time) when the TL is highly inflected but
the SL is not (Skadinš et al., 2010), since it helps the decoder to produce grammatically
correct phrases that have not been observed in the training corpus. We considered the
following aspects when building our factored phrase-based SMT system.

– Order of the MSD LM. The order of surface-form based LMs is usually set to 5. As
the number of different MSDs is several orders of magnitude lower than the number
of different surface forms, a greater order can also be considered.

– Corpora tagging algorithm. In order to obtain the MSD factor of the TL side of the
parallel corpus and the TL monolingual corpus, a part-of-speech (PoS) tagger is
needed. We tested the effect of lexicon constraining in PoS tagging.

2.1 Constrained part of speech tagging

The best performing tagger available for Croatian is a CRF-based tagger (Ljubešić et
al, 2016b). While the tagger makes use of the hrLex inflectional lexicon (Ljubešić et al,
2016b), the corresponding lexicon entries are not used for constraining the tagger to the
potential tags, but just as features. As a result, the number of translations for each SL
phrase in a factored system grows when compared to a non-factored phrase-based SMT
system: in the system setups described in Section 2.2, the average number of translations
per SL phrase in the phrase table of our non-factored system is 2.091. This value grows
to 2.119 in the factored system that uses the CRF tagger. Moreover, we observed that the
increase in the number of translation options caused by unconstrained tagging is more
relevant in frequent SL phrases. For instance, the Croatian surface form kuća (house) can
only be analysed as a feminine, singular, nominative, common noun or as a feminine,
plural, genitive, common noun according to the lexicon. However, in our factored
system with unconstrained tagging (Section 2.2), we can find 8 phrase table entries
whose SL word is house and whose TL surface form factor is kuća. Additional MSDs
include cardinal number, adjective, or proper noun. Since according to some studies
(Ling et al., 2012), the presence of redundant phrase translations can hurt translation
quality, we also tested a modified version of the tagger in which it only selects the MSDs
present in the lexicon.4 As a result, the average number of translations per SL phrase
was 2.111.

4 We post-processed the output of the CRF tagger: for each word tagged with an MSD not present
in the lexicon, we replaced it with the most likely one from the lexicon according to a 3-gram



356 Sánchez-Cartagena et al.

We compared the original and the constrained tagger on the test set traditionally
used to evaluate taggers on Croatian: 300 sentences (6306 tokens) from news, general
web and Wikipedia domains (Agić and Ljubešić, 2014): constraining the tagger slightly
reduces accuracy from 0.9253 to 0.9232.

2.2 Experiments and results

We built our phrase-based SMT system from corpora crawled from the web: we consider
them to be the most suitable ones for an open-domain system. In particular, we used
hrenWaC as parallel corpus (Ljubešić et al., 2016a) and hrWaC (Ljubešić and Klubička,
2014) as TL monolingual corpus. The parallel corpus contains 1 166 732 sentences,
32 908 281 English words and 29 199 856 Croatian words. The size of the vocabularies
is 605 929 (English) and 888 405 (Croatian): the ratio between them is 1.47, which gives
us an idea of the morphological richness of Croatian as compared with English. The
monolingual corpus contains 67 403 231 sentences and 1 404 303 868 words. We used
Moses5 with the MIRA tuning algorithm (Watanabe et al., 2007). We estimated a 5-gram
surface-form LM from the TL monolingual corpus. Our factored system contains an
additional MSD LM estimated from the same monolingual corpus. We experimented
with orders 3, 5 and 7 and the two tagging alternatives discussed in the previous section.
We used KenLM and Knesser-Ney discounting.6

We tuned the systems with newstest2012 and evaluated them with newstest2013, as
Pirinen et al. (2016) did. Table 1 shows the values of the BLEU, TER and METEOR
evaluation metrics for the basic phrase-based SMT system and the different factored
alternatives. Results show that constraining the tagging brings a consistent improvement
(for all evaluation metrics and MSD LM orders), thus confirming the observations by

LM of MSDs estimated from the same annotated corpus from which the CRF tagger was trained
(Ljubešić et al, 2016b). Words not found in the lexicon were assigned the special tag UNK (this
was not done when evaluating tagging accuracy in order to perform a fair comparison with the
unconstrained tagger).

Ling et al. (2012). Concerning the order of the MSD LM, the best translation quality
is obtained for order 3. We observed that, as we increase the value of the order, short-
distance agreement deteriorates, but long-distance agreement does not improve. A couple
of examples can be found in Table 2. This is probably caused by the fact that the order
of the constituents of the sentence is relatively free in Croatian. Thus, it is difficult to
predict MSDs in the TL with n-grams that cross constituent boundaries.

Table 2. Example sentences illustrating the difference in local agreement between different orders
of the MSD LM. In the first example, the phrase obične smrt should be in the genitive case, but it
is nominative in the order 7 alternative; in the second example, the adjective egipatske should be
in neuter gender in order to agree with društva, but it is feminine in the order 7 alternative.

Example 1 Example 2

order 3 hrabrost obične smrti. [...] poštovanje za druge elemente egipatskog društva.
order 7 hrabrost obična smrt. [...] poštovanja za druge elemente egipatske društva.
ref. hrabrost obične smrti. [...] poštovanja ostalih elemenata egipatskog društva.

3 Morphological expansion

Factored systems with an additional MSD LM cannot produce surface forms in Croatian
that have not been observed in the training corpus. In order to further mitigate the data
sparseness problem, we enhanced our system with morphological expansion. It consists
of creating new phrase table entries from existing ones by means of changing values
of morphological inflection attributes and inflecting words accordingly. We followed
a strategy7 inspired by Turchi and Ehrmann (2011) but we restricted the process with
linguistically motivated rules so as to avoid the need to optimise filtering thresholds. We
created new phrase pairs by changing only the TL side of existing phrase pairs, and only
for those phrase pairs whose TL side is a single word or a grammatically meaningful
phrase. We select, among others, TL phrases that contain a noun, a noun phrase, an
adjective, a verb, etc. Then, we generate new phrases with all the possible values of the
morphological inflection features not present in English.8 We added the generated phrase
pairs to a new phrase table which is combined with the original one at decoding time by
means of independent decoding paths (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).

We added morphological expansion to the best factored system described in Sec-
tion 2.2 and repeated the evaluation. In view of the positive results of reducing translation
alternatives by constraining PoS tagging, we also evaluated an alternative morphological
expansion strategy in which only noun phrases were expanded. Our expansion rules
generate only 3 alternatives for them (for nominative, accusative and instrumental cases),
while the number of generated entries is higher for verbal phrases and adjectives. Results
displayed in Table 3 show that there is not a clear difference between both expansion

strategies, and that morphological expansion is not able to outperform the factored
system (the difference is not statistically significant). We performed a manual analysis
on the agreement errors found in 40 sentences randomly selected from the test set and
found that for only 25% of all the agreement errors proper word forms were not present
in the phrase table, out of which only 23% were generated by morphological expansion.
Most needed words were not generated because they were not present in the lexicon.

+ morph. expansion noun phrases 0.2470 0.6232 0.2174
+ morph. expansion all 0.2460 0.6235 0.2179

4 Combination with data selection

A different way of dealing with data sparseness is to augment the training corpus by
selecting the most suitable sentences from out-of-domain data. Pirinen et al. (2016;
Section 2.6) followed that strategy and obtained a significant improvement over a plain
phrase-based SMT system trained on hrenWaC (Table 4 shows the result of evaluating
their approach; the evaluation setup defined in Section 2.2 was followed). In order
to make the most of the available resources for English–Croatian we combined both
approaches: we built a system with factored translation models (following the best setup
in Section 2.2) on the parallel corpora obtained as a result of data selection. Results,
which are also depicted in Table 4, confirm that both approaches can be successfully
combined, allowing us to reach the state-of-the-art system, Google Translate.9

language pair is not feasible. Successful application of factored models to different
language pairs has been already reported by other authors, like Bojar (2007) and Koehn
et al. (2010). Regarding morphological expansion, to the best of our knowledge, the
approach by Turchi and Ehrmann (2011) is the only one that addresses the expansion of
the TL side of the phrase table. Concerning other ways of adding linguistic information
to an SMT system, we refer the reader to the survey by Costa-Jussà and Farrús (2014).

6 Conclusions and future work

In this paper, we presented a set of strategies on how to leverage existing Croatian linguis-
tic resources to address data sparseness in a general-domain English-to-Croatian SMT
system. Applying factored models showed to be successful. We observed that accuracy
of PoS tagging and translation performance are not correlated and that increasing the
order of the MSD LM is counterproductive. A combination of factored models and data
selection allowed us to build a system that reaches state-of-the-art commercial tools.
Improvement obtained with morphological expansion was negligible.

Since most of the agreement errors were not caused by lack of inflected forms in the
phrase table, and the best results were obtained with a low-order MSD LM because of
the free constituent order in Croatian, hybridisation with an RBMT system that performs
full syntactic analysis (Labaka et al., 2014) could further improve the results.
