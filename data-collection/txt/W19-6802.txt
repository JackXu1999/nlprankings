Abstract 

Torwali is an endangered language spo-

ken in the north of Pakistan. It is a com-

putationally challenging language be-

cause of its RTL Perso-Arabic script, 

non-concatenative nature and distinct 

words alterations. This paper discusses 

issues and challenges regarding gram-

matical structure, divergence in terms of 

lexicon as well as morphological make-

up for the machine translation of a less 

studied language. It includes creation of 

NLP tools such as parts of speech (POS) 

tagger and morphological analyser with 

HFST which is based on the idea of 

building lexicon and morphological rules 

using finite state devices. This work, on 

which this paper is based, will be a 

source of Torwali finite state morphology 

and its future computational growth as 

electronic dictionaries are usually 

equipped with morphological analyser 

and it will also be helpful for developing 

language pairs. 

Key words: Machine Translation, Low-

resource language, Morphological analy-

sis, language pairs 

1 Introduction 

Torwali belongs to the Kohistani sub-group of 

the Indo-Aryan Dardic languages, spoken in the 

upper reaches of district Swat of northern Paki-

stan. It has two dialects (the Bahrain and Chail 

dialects), with a total of approximately 90,000 to 

100,000 speakers.  

    Torwali is written in a cursive, context sensi-

tive Perso-Arabic script from left to right having 

unique grammar (morphology + syntax).   Being 

a marginalized and low resource language, there 

are no robust morphology sources which hinders 

progress in NLP (Natural Language Processing) 

tools for Torwali thou there is a digital Torwali 

dictionary available along with some structured 

data. This paper discusses an attempt to create a 

morphological analyzer using HFST from 

scratch. 

    In NLP, morphological analysis is used to 

identify the morpheme and affixes of words in a 

language and individual words are analyzed into 

their components. Apart from computational 

linguistics, there are other uses that require 

morphological analysis e.g text processing, 

information retrieval and user interfaces. 

    Morphologies nowadays are commonly writ-

ten by using special purpose languages based on 

finite state technology, one of them is HFST 

which is based on regular expressions. 

2 Goals 

The goal of this study is to create a baseline 

system that paves way for machine translation of 

Torwali which will cover: 

 POS tagging 

 Creating a lexc 

 Basic inflection rules using twol (two 
level rule)  

3 Unicode and input method 

Unicode UTF-8 encoding is used as an encoding 

scheme as XFST/HFST files are always treated 

as UTF-8. 

As an Input tool TRF phonetic keyboard (TRF 

2L V1.0) is used which is developed so that users 

can easily input texts without going on-screen.   

4 Morphological analysis using HFST 

HFST-Helsinki finite-state Technology is a 

framework for compiling and applying linguistic 

descriptions with finite state methods. Finite-

state transducers methods are useful for solving 

problems involving language identification via 

morphological processing and POS tagging. 

There are two principle files in a morphological 

transducer in HFST, a lexc file which is 

concerned with morphotactics i-e about the way 

morphemes are joined together in a word and

twol file is used to describe phonological and 

orthographical alternation rules i-e about what 

happened when the morphemes are joined 

together. 

For morphological analysis of Torwali 

HFST/finite state transducers are chosen because 

Torwali language is quite immature for statistical 

machine translation and also this implementation 

is done using Apertium, which is an open source 

machine translation platform in which HFST can 

be used. 

4.1 LEXC 

Lexicon Compiler or LEXC is a finite-state 

compiler also called a lexical transducer that 

reads set of morphemes and their morphotactic 

combinations in order to create finite-state 

transducer of a lexicon. LEXC contains 

morphemes grouped in sub-lexicon sets which in 

turn contain finite strings separated by ‘:’ and a 

continuation class (a lexicon name). 

4.2 TWOLC 

TWOLC, Two-Level Compiler is a two level 

rule compiler used for compiling grammars of 

two levels into finite state transducers sets. Two 

level rules are constraints on lexical word forms 

corresponding to surface forms, It describes 

morphological alternations such as ڙینگ:ڙینگو  

(weep: weeping), بن:بنو  (say: saying). It takes 

surface forms produced by LEXC and applies 

rules on them; the rules vary depending on 

morphological alteration of stem, 

morphologically or phonologically conditioned 

deletion of suffix, morphologically or 

phonologically conditioned insertion, 

morphologically or phonologically conditioned 

symbol change. 

 

5 Torwali Morphology 

Torwali has a unique morphology because it is 

basically a fusional language which uses several 

strategies like stem modification, reduplication 

and existence of words in inflected form, derived 

form, compound form and root form. The 

morphological analyzer separates root and suffix 

morphemes in all lexical entries i-e in أمیژیل and 

 .are suffixes  /یل/,/چا/ are roots and  /أمیژ/,/لن/ ,لناچا

The purpose of this section is to discuss Torwali 

morphology and its implementation in HFST for 

main grammatical categories of Torwali i-e 

nouns, verbs, adjectives and pronouns. 

   

5.1 Nouns 

In Torwali, nouns are inflected for number and 

case and the stem can be joined by an optional 

plural suffix and an optional oblique case marker. 

Torwali uses several strategies to mark plurality 

but the primary morphological method is tone 

along with verb agreement like for most of the 

singular nouns have a tone with rising pitch from 

low-to-high and their plural counterparts have a 

tone with low pitch. Due to the issue related to 

representing tone, Torwali words which use tone 

to mark plurality the following approach is used 

where singular/plural for masculine and feminine 

are handled in a single paradigm.

line/feminine

%<n%>%<m%>%<pl%>: # ; 
 

 

 

And, words are added in the lexicon in the 

following way: 

 
LEXICON NounRoot 

 
 ; N-M آن:آن

 ; N-F أر:أر

If we compile the lexicon with hfst-lexc and 

test it with hfst-fst2strings, it spits out the 

following result: 

 
  آن:<n><m><sg>آن     
  آن:<n><m><pl>آن   
 أر:<n><f><sg>أر   
 أر:<n><f><pl>آن   
 

The above output marks singularity and plurality 

for words having tonal change but have no de-

scription about the tone’s pitch. To make plural 

oblique of nouns a suffix /e/, /ے/ is added to the 

stem as in the words; /خارے/ ,/خار/ and /شان/, 

 ./شانے/

    Reduplication is another strategy to communi-

cate plurality and intensity but not in the same 

way as tone does. For instance, /میل گیل/ ,/گال مال/, 

/ ,/ُچن ُچن/ پہٹ   ./چٔی میٔ / ,/پہٹ 

    Torwali noun forms can be derived from ad-

jectives which can be implemented by adding the 

suffix /اچا/ making noun root follow a continua-

tion class:  
%<%n>%<nder%>%<m%>:%>اچا # ; 
%<%n>%<nder%>%<f%>:%>اچا # ; 

Where %<nder%> is tag for derived noun. 

    For noun inflection which undergoes stem 

modifications, there is a lot of complexity re-

garding standard rule formation for them; here is 

a general conclusion: 

For majority of masculine nouns the vowel 

changes form \a\ to \ə\ and for feminine nouns \a\ 

to \æ\ but some masculine and feminine nouns 

behave differently. For morphological alteration 

of the stem the following rules must be imple-

mented using twolc, taking the surface forms 

produced by lexc.  

 

 Delete  (a,ا) for making plurals of mascu-
line singular nouns, when )a, )ا   follows a 

consonant as in / دان   /ڙن/, /ڙان/ and /دن/, /

 Replace (a, ا  ) by (æ, أ  ) for making plurals 
of feminine nouns when the (a,ا) follows 

a consonant as in /بأت/ , /بات/ and /ڙات/ , 

 . /ڙأت/

 For noun inflections relating sizes; re-
place (a, ا  ) by (æ, أ  ) to mark small size of 

large-size nouns e.g.  /لہاڑ/ , لہأڑ// .  

     

5.2 Verbs 

Torwali verbs inflect for tense, aspect, mood and 

gender and most of the verb forms make gender 

and number distinction only, no distinction for 

person. Torwali has three tenses: present, past 

and future. The suffix /i/, /ی/ can be used to mark 

feminine singular forms and present tense on 

feminine singular forms, /u/, /و/ as masculine 

singular suffix and present tense on masculine 

singular forms with the suffix /i/, /ی/ being used 

for present tense on plural forms too. For infinite 

verbs the suffix /u/ is added to the stem. 

    To make a test, only present tense on 

masculine and feminine, infinitives, transitive 

and intransitive forms of verb are selected and in 

the continuation class the suffixes are added to 

mark inflection associated with each of them 

which are defined with suitable tags as shown 

below.

Now if we add some verbs,

 ; V ڙینگ:ڙینگ
 ; V-INF بن:بن
 ; VT ُسلُو:ُسلُو
 ; VI ُسوَرئ:ُسوَرئ

The analyzer analyses these verb forms in the 

following way when compiled with hfst-lexc 
and tested with hfst-fst2strings:  
 

$ hfst-fst2strings trw.lexc.hfst 
 

  ڙینگ:<v>ڙینگ
 و<بن:<v><inf>بن
 دو<بن:<v><m><pres>بن
 جی<بن:<v><f><pres>بن
  ؤ < ُسلُو:<v><vt>ُسلُو
   ہوؤ < ُسوَرئ:<v><vi>ُسوَرئ
 

    From the above output it is concluded that the 

following implementations can be done. These 

rules can be applied to verbs whose stem ends 

with a consonant.  

 Adding a suffix /دُد/ to represent past 
tense on infinitive verb. 

 Adding a suffix /نین/ to mark future tense 
on finite verb. 

 Adding suffix /سأت/ to mark inceptive of 
infinite verb.  

 For present perfective on masculine sin-
gular adding suffix /و/ and /ی/ for both 

plurals and feminine singular. 

 Suffix /ودو/ for masculine singular,  /یجی/ 
for feminine singular and /یدی/ for plurals 

to mark present perfective on finite verbs  

 Suffix /وشو/ for masculine singular and 
-for both feminine singular and plu /یشی/

rals to mark past perfective on finite 

verb. 

    Verbs ending with a vowel inflect differently 

they sometimes behave like verbs with consonant 

ending stems with a minor modification some 

plural forms tend to have /أ/with the stem before 

applying the plural suffix; however most of the 

verbs with vowel-final stem follow different con-

figurations.  

 

5.3  Adjectives, Pronouns, Adverbs and 
closed classes 

In a similar way Adjectives, Pronouns, Adverbs, 

Postpositions, Conjunctions and Interjections 

have been implemented with the same level of 

detail. 

6 Result and Conclusions 

This work presents a straight forward 

implementation of Towali morphology analyzer 

using HFST, which implemented the basic 

inflections of nouns, verbs and other POS like 

adjectives, adverbs, pronouns and postpositions 

being tagged. We found HFST a good choice for 

implementing Torwali Morphology for now as 

this is the first ever attempt to implement Torwali 

morphology using FST. However; to develop a 

full fledge Morphological analyzer more work 

has to be done. The major problem which we 

have to face is the random stem changes in 

nouns, variation in nouns using change of tone, 

distinct behavior of vowel ending verbs and 

nouns. There is a need to learn more about 

Torwali Morphology regarding the affixes and 

varying stems and more rules needs to be 

defined.   

7 Future work 

This work could further be enhanced to follow-

ing extensions depending upon the possibility: 

  Addition of missing diacritic marks to 
words 

 Technique to interpret tone of nouns to 
indentify singular/plural nouns by its 

tone. 

 Algorithms to differentiate phonetically 
similar words. 

 A comprehensive implementation of 
Torwali syntax.
