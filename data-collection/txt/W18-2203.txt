Abstract 

Machine translation is one of the important research directions in natural language pro-

cessing. In recent years, neural machine translation methods have surpassed traditional sta-

tistical machine translation methods in translation performance of most of language and 

have become the mainstream methods of machine translation. In this paper, we proposed 

syllable segmentation in Tibetan translation tasks for the first time and achieved better re-

sults than Tibetan word segmentation. Four kinds of neural machine translation methods, 

which are influential in recent years, are compared and analyzed in Tibetan-Chinese corpus. 

Experimental results showed that the translation model based on the complete self-attention 

mechanism performed best in the translation task of Tibetan-Chinese corpus, and perfor-

mance of the most of the neural machine translation methods surpassed performance of the 

traditional statistical machine translation methods.  

Key words: Tibetan-Chinese translation; Neural machine translation; Syllabe Segmentation 

1. Introduction 

Machine translation, studies on how to use computers to achieve the automatic translation 

between natural languages, is one of the important research directions in areas of artificial 

intelligence and natural language processing (Liu, 2017). Natural language processing (in-

cluding machine translation) is a discipline that crosses computer science and linguistics. 

Based on characteristics of this discipline, the system of machine translation can be divided 

into two categories, which are the rule-based methods and the corpus-based methods. Among 

them, corpus-based methods can be divided into statistics-based methods and example-based 

methods (Zhao et al., 2000). In recent years, with the development of internet technology, 

machine translation has achieved fruitful results both in academia and industry. 

Since the advent of the neural network in the 1940s, it has experienced the different 

stages of rising, low tide, and rising. Until 2006, Hinton et al. solved the historic problem of 

neural networks (Hinton et al., 2006), and the related researches of deep learning and neural 

network returned to people's attention again. Since then, with the deepening of theoretical 

research and improvement of computing speed of computers, neural networks have been 

gradually applied to various fields of artificial intelligence and have made major

breakthroughs. Researches about natural language processing have also made a rapid progress 

along with this tide. 

In 2012, With the Hinton research group participated in the ImageNet image 

recognition contest and won the championship, which opened the prelude of deep learning in 

the big bang in various fields of artificial intelligence. Neural machine translation (NMT) is 

also a machine translation method that is gradually emerging at this stage. The main processes 

of neural machine translation are as follows: Firstly, it uses neural networks (RNN, CNN, etc.) 

to encode the source language into word embedding. Secondly, the word-embedding  

generates the target language by decoding . Among them, in the neural network training, the 

problem of long distance dependence can be solved well by the proper joining of long-short 

term memory (LSTM) networks and attention mechanisms. 

Tibetan is a kind of pinyin character, and its syllables are composed of 34 vowel 

consonants, then Tibetan words are composed of syllables (Wei, 2015). A single character in 

a Tibetan text is a unit, and it is separated by a syllable separator "à¼‹" between words (Cai, 

2016). Based on the characteristics of Tibetan language, at present, the statistical machine 

translation model is mainly used in the research on Tibetan translation model, and the relevant 

theoretical research has basically stopped at the stage of word processing and other corpus 

preprocessing such as the phrase-based Tibetan-Chinese statistical machine translation system 

(Dong et al., 2012); besides, related tibetan preprocessing research (Hua, 2014; Wang, 2016; 

Wan et al., 2015) and so on. On the whole, compared with research on machine translation of 

other rich languages, the research on Tibetan-Chinese machine translation is obviously behind. 

There are few researches on using neural network model in Tibetan corpus (Li et al., 2017). 

Tibetan texts are all word segmentation pre-processed in traditional Tibetan machine 

translations (Guan, 2015). In this article, the traditional method of Tibetan word segmentation 

is completely abandoned, and Tibetan texts are directly divided by syllables. It gets a better 

performance than Tibetan word segmentation. 

In this paper, four kinds of influential machine translation models of neural networks 

are applied to the task of Tibetan-Chinese machine translation, and the final translation results 

are analyzed in detail. The experimental results show that the application of neural network 

machine translation model on Tibetan-Chinese machine translation has basically surpassed 

the performance of the traditional statistical machine translation model. By using the method 

of syllable segmentation in Tibetan machine translation tasks, it has a better translation 

performance than the method of  word segmentation. 

2. Neural Network Machine Translation Models 

2.1. Seq2Seq 

The Seq2Seq model is a sequence-to-sequence model. In many translation models in the past, 

a feature matrix was input during training, and each input corresponds to a row in the matrix. 

Therefore, these rows have the same dimension, which is not in accordance with the task of 

machine translation. Because, for machine translation tasks, we cannot guarantee that every 

sentence you input has the same number of words. Conversely, the input of the Seq2Seq mod-

el is a sequence, and the output is also a sequence. The length of the input sequence and the 

output sequence of this model is variable, which is the biggest difference between this model 

and the previous neural mahine translation model. 

The Seq2Seq model was presented in 2014, and two articles published by the Google 

Brain team (Ilya et al., 2014) and the Yoshua Bengio team (Cho et al., 2014) illustrate the 

basic idea of the model. The basic idea of solving the problem of the Seq2Seq model is to 

map an input sequence to an output sequence through one or more deep neural network 

models, which commonly known as LSTM --- Long short-term memories network (D'In-

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: LoResMT 2018 Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 22



 

 

formatique et al., 2001), and this process consists of two parts of encoding input and decoding 

output. 

In the encoder section, an input sequence X will be compiled into a vector C via an 

encoder built with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The vector C is usually the last hidden 

node in the RNN, or the weighted sum of multiple hidden nodes. 

In the decoder section, vector C will be decoded by the RNN decoder. The decoding 

process can be simply understood as using a series of algorithms to return the word with the 

highest probability corresponding to the input vector to get the optimal output sequence. 

2.2. RNNSearch 

In 2015, RNNSearch machine translation model was proposed by Bahdanau et al. (Bahdanau 

et al., 2014). This model adds the attention mechanism to the encoder-decoder structure, and 

the translation performance is greatly enhanced. In this model the attention mechanism is also 

used in natural language processing tasks for the first time. 

The Attention mechanism is added into the translation model, which breaks the limita-

tion that the traditional encoder-decoder structure, such as Seq2Seq model, relies on a fixed 

length vector in the process of decoding. The attention mechanism is achieved by preserving 

the intermediate output results of the input sequence encoded by the encoder and then retrain-

ing a new model to selectively learn these input sequences and associate the output sequence 

with the output of the model. In machine translation tasks, the model using the attention 

mechanism generates a word vector every time, and it finds one of the most relevant word sets 

in the input sequence, and then the model will predict the next target word generate based on 

the current context vectors and all previous generated words to achieve the best translation 

results. 

2.3. Fairseq 

Fairseq machine translation model was presented by the Facebook team in May 2017 

(Gehring, 2017). The traditional method of sequence to sequence learning is to map an input 

sequence to a variable length output sequence through one or more layers of RNN neural net-

work. The Fairseq model introduces an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural 

networks (CNNs). Compared with the recurrent neural network model, all calculations of the 

element sequence of Fairseq model in training are completely parallel, the number of nonline-

ar sequences is fixed and independent of the length of the input sequence.  

An important part of the Fairseq model in model structure is the multihop attention 

mechanism. The multihop alert mechanism is an enhanced version of attentional mechanics 

that allows the neural network to scan sentence sequences more often to produce better results 

and to influence each scan. Another important part of the model is the gating, which controls 

the flow of information in a neural network. Sentence sequences are transmitted downward 

through hidden units in a neural network, and the gating mechanism is used to precisely con-

trol the sequence information passed to the next unit, and the translation effect is greatly im-

proved. 

The research shows that in the same environment, the training time of Fairseq model is 

9 times faster than the translation model based on RNN network, and its accuracy is also 

higher than that of the model based on RNN network. 

2.4. Transformer 

Transformer machine translation model was proposed by the Google team in June 2017 

(Vaswani et al. 2017). Neural network is mostly used as the model basis of Encoder-Decoder 

in traditional neural network machine translation model. This model is based on the attention

mechanism and completely abandons the inherent model of the neural machine translation 

model without any neural network (CNN or RNN) structure. Experiments show that this 

model can run in parallel and greatly improve the speed of model training while improving 

machine translation performance.  

Transformer model requires only a small number of uninterrupted steps in the training 

process, at each step, it uses a self-note mechanism that can directly relate to all words in the 

sentence and the location of each word does not need to be considered, and model efficiency 

is also greatly enhanced while simplifying the model. Besides the improvement of 

computational performance and higher semantic understanding, the transformer model also 

provides a visual display of how words are processed and how the information travels across 

the network. 

Transformer model performs well in natural language processing tasks such as syntax 

analysis and semantic understanding, which is also a systematic breakthrough for natural 

language processing communities over decades.

3.3. Experimental setting 

In the experiment, in order to reflect the performance of neural machine translation, phrase-

based statistical machine translation model Nitutrans (Xiao T et al., 2012) developed by natu-

ral language processing laboratory in northeastern university (in china) is used in the statisti-

cal machine translation model. In this paper, four models of neural machine translation are 

consistent in the basic parameter settings (the vocabulary size of sub-words is set to 32000 

and the number of training iterations is 200000). Because each model has its own architecture, 

it is difficult to achieve consistent in terms of performance of parameters. In addition, with the 

language characteristics of the Tibetan-Chinese bilingual corpus, in this paper, based on each 

model, hyperparameters are adjusted to achieve maximum of translation performance. Bi-

lingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) is used as evaluation index in this paper (Papineni, 

2007). 

4. Experimental Results 

4.1. Corpus according to Character segmentation and word segmentation 

In order to verify the effect of the character segmentation (Tibetan syllables segmentation and 

Chinese characters segmentation) and the word segmentation (Tibetan word segmentation and 

Chinese word segmentation) of Tibetan corpus on the translation performance, Syllable seg-

mentation and Tibetan word segmentation of Tibetan-Chinese bilingual parallel corpus was 

conducted on the basis of the transformer model in the experiment. Among them, Tibetan 

word segmentation tool TIP-LAS is used in the Tibetan word segmentation (Li et al., 2015). 

THU-LAC software opened by Tsinghua university is used to conduct Chinese word segmen-

tation (Li et al., 2009). The experimental results of Tibetan-Chinese machine translation are 

shown in table 3. The experimental results of Chinese-Tibetan machine are shown in table 4.

The experimental results show that in neural machine translation, whether Tibetan is 

translated into Chinese or Chinese is translated into Tibetan, the effect of Character segmenta-

tion on corpus is obviously higher than that of word segmentation on corpus. This is the big-

gest difference between traditional machine translation corpus processing and machine trans-

lation corpus processing in this paper. 

4.2.  BPE impacting 

The problems of OOV (out of vocabulary) in neural machine translation and Rare Words are 

usually solved by back-off dictionaries. In 2016, Sennrich et al. (Sennrich, 2015) attempted a 

more simple and effective way (Subword Units) to represent open vocabularies inspired by 

translation strategies of the same root word, compound word, naming entity, and foreign lan-

guage. He considered that separating these rare words into a combination of "subword units" 

effectively alleviate the problem of translating OOV and rare words. The segmentation strate-

gy of subword unit here draws on a data compression algorithm: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) 

algorithm (Suarjaya, 2012; Shibata et al., 1999). In order to verify whether the corpus needs to 

be pre-processed by BPE before Tibetan-Chinese translation, we have a comparation between 

BPE processing and no BPE processing. The experimental results are shown in Table 5. 
Table 5 BPE impacting (Tibetan-Chinese)

The experimental results show that in the neural machine translation model, the trans-

lation effect will be improved when using BPE processing. 

 

4.3. Different Neural Networks with the Same Structure  

In order to verify the performance of different neural networks with the same model structure, 

experiments were conducted in RNNSearch and Fairseq models respectively. Both 

RNNSearch and Fairseq models are models based on the neural network and attention mecha-

nism. The only difference is that RNNSearch is a model based on cyclic neural networks, 

whereas Fairseq is a model based on convolutional neural networks. The experimental results 

are shown in Table 6. 
Table 6 Different Neural Networks with the Same Structure (Tibetan-Chinese) 

Model Network Corpus processing BLEU 

RNNSearch RNN Character 45.63 

Fairseq CNN Character 46.94 

 

The experimental results show that there are obvious differences in the translation per-

formance for different neural networks models with the same model structure, and because of 

its characteristics of the model based on CNN, training time greatly reduced and performance 

exceeds RNN-based neural network model. 

4.4. Different Neural Machine Translation Models in Tibetan-Chinese Corpus 

In order to verify the performance of different neural machine translation models on Tibetan-

Chinese translationï¼Œtraining of Tibetan-Chinese machine translation model was carried out 
in four different neural network models respectively in this experiment, meanwhile, the same 

corpus was trained in statistical machine translation model. Machine translation model Niut-

rans opened by the natural language processing laboratory of Northeastern University(in china) 

is used in the statistical machine translation model (use Chinese as monolingual data). The 

experimental results are shown in Table 7.

The experimental results show that there are obvious differences in the translation per-

formance of different neural machine translation models. Among them, Most neural machine 

translation models have better translation performance than statistical machine translation 

models; translation performance of the model Transformer based on complete self-attention 

mechanism is the best; the same machine translation model, translation performance of char-

acter-based processing is better than performance of word segmentation processing; training 

time of Fairseq model is the fastest. 

5. Conclusion 

In this paper, the four-influential neural machine translation models: the Seq2Seq model 

based on the RNN, the RNNSearch model based on RNN+Attention mechanism, the Fairseq 

model based on CNN + Attention mechanism, and the Transformer model based on self-

attention mechanism are compared in Tibetan-Chinese machine translation tasks. Through the 

comparison, it has the following findings: 

1. In Tibetan translation task, most of the translation performance of the machine translation 

model of neural network is better traditional statistical machine translation model; 

2. In the Tibetan translation (Tibetan-Chinese, Chinese-Tibetan) task, the translation perfor-

mance of character processing on the original corpus (Tibetan syllable segmentation, Chinese 

word segmentation) is better than that of word segmentation processing on the corpus; 

3. In the neural machine translation model, BPE processing on the original corpus can opti-

mize the translation performance; 

4. Different neural network with the same structure, the translation performance of CNN-

based neural network is better than the translation performance of RNN-based neural network, 

and the training speed of CNN-based machine translation model of neural network is much 

faster than that of RNN-based machine translation model of neural network; 

5. The translation performance of the Transformer model based on the completely self-

attention mechanism is the best in Tibetan translation tasks.
