ABSTRACT
Semantic Web aims to allow machines to make inferences using the explicit conceptualisa-
tions contained in ontologies. By pointing to ontologies, Semantic Web-based applications
are able to inter-operate and share common information easily. Nevertheless, multilin-
gual semantic applications are still rare, owing to the fact that most online ontologies are
monolingual in English. In order to solve this issue, techniques for ontology localisation
and translation are needed. However, traditional machine translation is difficult to apply
to ontologies, owing to the fact that ontology labels tend to be quite short in length and
linguistically different from the free text paradigm. In this paper, we propose an approach to
enhance machine translation of ontologies based on exploiting the well-structured concept
descriptions contained in the ontology. In particular, our approach leverages the seman-
tics contained in the ontology by using Cross Lingual Explicit Semantic Analysis (CLESA)
for context-based disambiguation in phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
The presented work is novel in the sense that application of CLESA in SMT has not been
performed earlier to the best of our knowledge.

1 Introduction

An ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization (Gruber, 1993). Since the
rise of Semantic Web, many ontology-based applications have been developed, for instance
in the fields of ontology-based information extraction (Buitelaar et al., 2008), semantic
search (Fernandez et al., 2008) and cross lingual information extraction (Embley et al.,
2011). Nevertheless, due to the fact that most of the ontologies have been documented
only in English and multilingual ontologies are rare, semantic applications that exploit
information across natural language barriers are uncommon. In order to cross such barriers,
a critical mass of multilingual ontologies is needed, as well as methods and techniques
for ontology localisation and translation. In fact, ontology localisation, or the adaptation
of an ontology to a particular language and culture (Espinoza et al., 2008a) has been
identified as one of the key challenges of the multilingual Semantic Web (Gracia et al., 2012).

Translation of an ontology documented in a source language into target language
is one of the most important steps in ontology localisation. Translating the ontology affects
the lexical layer of an ontology. This layer includes all the natural language description
including labels, comments, definitions, and associated documentation to make that
ontology understandable for humans (Cimiano et al., 2010).

Ideally, ontology translation has to be supported by automatic methods, as finding
domain experts knowing many languages is very difficult and expensive. It can be achieved
by using machine translation (MT) techniques. Unfortunately, the labels in the ontologies
pose extra challenges for standard practices in MT because of the different linguistic
structure and short text length of the ontology labels compared to the free text paradigm
(McCrae et al., 2011). In fact, ontology labels need not to be fully grammatically-correct
sentences. Thus, a single ontology label typically constitutes a poor context to disambiguate
the candidate translations of a lexical entry contained in that label.

It has been shown that performing word sense disambiguation (WSD) using the
surrounding words for disambiguating the possible translations improve machine translation
(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) (Chan et al., 2007). Following a similar intuition, such context
disambiguation can also be applied to the translation of ontologies (Espinoza et al., 2008a).
In that case, the ontology concepts are precisely defined and related to other concepts.
Thus, the context of a concept can be enriched with the labels and textual descriptions of its
connected concepts, and such context can be exploited for semantic disambiguation.

Therefore, we want to leverage the context from the ontology for improving the
translation of labels. In this work, we use Cross Lingual Explicit Semantic Analysis
(CLESA) based context disambiguation between the ontology context and the translation
candidates, to rank the candidates, in the phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) architecture. In our experiments, we use the labels of the connected entities of the
source label in the ontology as the ontological context for any lexical entry, which comes
from the source label.

This paper describes an approach that exploits ontological context from the ontol-
ogy for improving automatic translation of the ontology labels. In particular, we have
investigated the use of CLESA in SMT for this purpose. The remainder of this paper

is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses some background required for better
understanding of the rest of the paper. Section 3 describes the approach for using CLESA
based WSD in SMT for ontology translation. Section 4 explains the evaluation setup
and reports the experimental results. Section 5 describes some related work about the
translation of ontologies. Finally, conclusions and future work are reported in the final
section of the paper.

2 Background
In order to allow a better understanding of the rest of the paper, we briefly introduce here
some basic notions of the techniques used in our approach.

2.1 Statistical Machine Translation
The statistical machine translation model utilizes the standard source-channel approach for
statistically modeling the translation problem (Koehn et al., 2003) as follows:

ar gmax t g t P(t g t|src) = ar gmax t g t P(src|t g t) PLangModel(t g t) (1)
In equation 1, src and tgt refer to the source phrase and translated phrase respectively.
The heuristic-based search is performed by the machine translation decoder to deduce the
translation candidate with the maximum probability given the source phrase.

Phrase-based models generally perform better than word-based models as the phrase-based
model tries to learn more of the local context and reduces the restrictions of word-based
translation by translating whole sequences of words (Koehn et al., 2003). The phrases here
are a sequence of words with all possible n-grams rather than only the linguistically correct
phrases.

2.2 Cross Lingual Explicit Semantic Analysis
Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) was introduced by (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007),
and allows the semantic comparison of two texts with the help of explicitly defined
concepts. In contrast, other techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and
Foltz, 1998) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) build unsupervised concepts
considering the correlations of the terms in the data. ESA is an algebraic model in which
the text is represented with a vector of the explicit concepts as dimensions. The magnitude
of each dimension in the vector is the associativity weight of the text to that explicit
concept/dimension. To quantify this associativity, the textual content related to the explicit
concept/dimension is utilized. This weight can be calculated by considering different
methods, for instance, tf-idf score. A possible way of defining concepts in ESA is by means
of using the Wikipedia 1 titles as dimensions of the model and the corresponding articles
for calculating the associativity weight (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), thus taking
advantage of the vast coverage of the community-developed Wikipedia. A compelling
characteristic of Wikipedia is the large collective knowledge available in multiple languages,
which facilitates an extension of existing ESA for multiple languages called Cross-lingual

1http://www.wikipedia.org/

27



Explicit Semantic Analysis (CLESA) (Sorg and Cimiano, 2008). The articles in Wikipedia
are linked together across language, and this cross-lingual linked structure can provide a
mapping of a vector in one language to the other. Thus, Wikipedia provides the comparable
corpus in different languages, which is required by CLESA.

To understand CLESA, lets take two terms ts in source language and t t in the tar-
get language. As a first step, a concept vector for ts is created using the Wikipedia corpus in
the source language. Similarly, the concept vector for t t is created in the target language.
Then, one of the concept vectors can be converted to the other language by using the
cross-lingual mappings provided by Wikipedia. After obtaining both of the concept vectors
in one language, the relatedness of the terms ts and t t can be calculated by using cosine
product, similar to ESA. For better efficiency, we chose to make a multilingual index by
composing poly-lingual Wikipedia articles using the cross-lingual mappings. In such a case,
no conversion of the concept vector in one language to the other is required. It is possible
by representing the Wikipedia concept with some unique name common to all languages
such as, for instance, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the English Wikipedia.

3 CLESA with SMT for Translating Ontologies
SMT systems implicitly use the local context for a better lexical choice during the translation
(Carpuat and Wu, 2005). Accordingly, it is natural to assume that a focused WSD system
integrated with SMT system might produce better translations. We follow the direct
incorporation of WSD into SMT system as a multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation
system (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).

The WSD probability score calculated by using CLESA is added as an additional
feature in the log-linear translation model. The CLESA based score would depend on the
ontology in which the source label lies and ergo, the context of the ontology would be used
to disambiguate the translation candidates. Equation 2 shows the integration of WSD in the
standard phrase-based MT.

ar gmax t g t P(t g t|src, O) = ar gmax t g t PTranslat ion(src|t g t)PLangModel(t g t)PSemantic(t g t|O)
(2)

Here, the computation of equation 2 requires a heuristic search by the decoder to seek the
best translation given the ontology O and the source phrase. The factor PSemantic(t g t|O)
provides the probability score for a translation candidate given the ontology. This score
is found by calculating the CLESA based semantic relatedness between the ontological
context and the translation candidates. There can be several possibilities for selecting the
context from the ontology, including the option to use the structure of the ontology for
disambiguation (Espinoza et al., 2008a). For our experiments, the ontological context
consists of labels of the connected entities to the source label in the ontology. Thereupon,
we take a bag of words used in all the labels of the ontology and build the concept vector
for the ontology to compare it with the concept vector of the translation candidates.
We have employed Stanford Phrasal library (Cer et al., 2010), which is a phrase-based
SMT system, in our architecture. It easily allows the integration of new features into
the decoding model along with the already available features in the library (Cer et al., 2010).

28



Figure 1: Phrase-based SMT architecture with CLESA integration.

Fig.1 shows the architecture applied for translating the ontologies. As an example,
suppose that the SMT system has already been trained with some parallel corpus, for
instance, Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). It receives an example English label "Minimum
Finance Lease Payments" from a source ontology to translate it into German. The label
is broken into a phrase chunk list containing all the possible phrases by the Exhaustive
Phrase Chunker. As a next step, the Translation Source provides all the possible translation
candidates for each phrase chunk in the chunk list. Translation Source can be a phrase
table made from some parallel corpus like Europarl. Then, scores are assigned to all the
translation candidates based on several standard Translation Features exisiting in the Phrasal
library. As an additional feature, we introduce one more score based on the CLESA based
semantic relevance of the candidate against the source ontology context, which includes all
its labels. All these feature scores are combined by a log-linear model. The MERT Tuner
(Och, 2003) is just used once to learn the weights of various features used in the model
for a particular language pair. In the final step, the decoder performs search over all the
translation candidates given the scores from Translation Features and the Language Model,
and makes the German translation "Minimale Finanz-Leasing-Zahlungen".

For implementing CLESA, we followed an information retrieval based approach by
creating a Lucene 2 inverted index of a Wikipedia dump from Jan, 2012. As a preprocessing
step, all the Wikipedia namespace type articles such as mediaWiki, talk, help etc. were
removed. For creating the weighted vector of concepts for a translation candidate in the

2http://lucene.apache.org/core/

29



target language, the term is searched over the Wikipedia index of the respective language
to retrieve the top associated Wikipedia concepts and the Lucene ranking scores are taken
as the associativity weights of the concepts to the term. We took the top 2000 Wikipedia
concepts for our experiment as we found that increasing this number did not have any
major effect on the translation metrics, but it significantly increases the computational time.
As the ontological context for any phrase chunk, we use the source label along with the
labels from the connected entities to the source label in the ontology. Thus, the concept
vector for the ontological context is created by searching the ontological context in the
Wikipedia index of the source language.

4 Evaluation

To evaluate the integration of CLESA in the SMT architecture, we perform the translation
of several ontologies and compare the results, against reference translations, with the
translations performed by a baseline SMT system. We used widely accepted machine
translation metrics in our evaluation: WER (Popović and Ney, 2007), BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002), NIST(Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005). All the translations
were performed for English to Spanish, English to German and English to Dutch language
pairs.

4.1 Experimental Setup

To build a baseline SMT system, we used the Stanford Phrasal library trained on EuroParl
corpus (Koehn, 2005). In order to define our benchmark, we have used some multilingual
ontologies available online (See table 1). For tuning the SMT system using MERT tuner,
IFRS ontology was used as it contains 2757 labels (McCrae et al., 2011) for each language in
the consideration, which is quite large against the number of labels present in the ontologies
used for evaluation. We used a monolingual version of each ontology as input to the
evaluation process. Then, we used the labels in the target language as reference translations
and compared them to the translations obtained in the process. Finally, the evaluation
metrics were computed. To test the effect of CLESA-based disambiguation in SMT, we run
the experiments both with our SMT baseline system and with the CLESA integrated in the
baseline system.

4.2 Results and Discussions

Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results in our experiments for the English to German, English to
Spanish and English to Dutch language pairs respectively.

We can see that the metric scores are low, which could be mainly because of lower
word/phrase coverage. Although, the results show an improvement in BLEU-2, METEOR,
NIST and WER (WER is better if the score is low) but not in BLEU-4. This is the result of the
linguistic differences between free-text and ontology labels. Labels of an ontology generally
tend to be shorter in length, therefore BLEU-2 (BLEU with 2-grams) gives better correlation
with the reference translations than BLEU-4 (BLEU with 4-grams). It is probably because
the average number of tokens is less than 4 in the evaluated ontologies. These metrics

do not suit well to the task of ontology translation as they do in the free text paradigm
(McCrae et al., 2011). Therefore, there is a need for the development of new metrics for
evaluating the translation of ontologies.

From the result tables, we can see that the use of the CLESA ranker slightly im-
proves the baseline results in most of the cases. The improvement is little because the
integration of CLESA does not provide new translation candidates to the system, it just gives
more weightage to the ones which are semantically more related to the ontological context.

5 Related Work

Label-Translator, developed as a NEON plug-in (Espinoza et al., 2008b), is one of the initial
initiatives to automatically localize the ontology. It does not follow SMT-centered approach
(Espinoza et al., 2008a). As a first step, it collects the candidate translations for a label by
consulting different bilingual linguistic resources and translation services such as Google
Translate. Then, it performs WSD by using the ontological context of the label against the
candidates for selecting the best one. The context in which those candidates appear in
different domains is taken from various multilingual ontologies and linguistic resources
such as EuroWordnet (Vossen, 1998). One of the pre-requisites of Label-Translator is

that it relies on the existence of the candidate translations in EuroWordNet (or similar
resources) in order to operate. On the contrary, the CLESA-based approach does not suffer
such limitation. Our approach does not, therefore, depend on the availability of external
translation services. Furthermore, thanks to the wide language coverage of Wikipedia, the
extension of the CLESA-based approach to other language pairs is straightforward.

The problem of translating ontologies has already been discussed in the context of
SMT (McCrae et al., 2011), although, not much work has been done in actually experiment-
ing with WSD in a SMT system for translating ontologies.

Therefore, we integrated CLESA into a phrase-based SMT architecture for translat-
ing labels of the ontologies. CLESA is shown to perform better than the latent concept
models in the context of cross lingual information retrieval task (Cimiano et al., 2009),
which motivated us to use it in SMT also.

Conclusion
We have presented an approach for ontology translation that uses CLESA for leveraging the
ontological context in a Statistical Machine Translation process. Integration of CLESA based
disambiguation using all the ontology labels in SMT architecture, provides the selection
of the translation candidates given the ontological context, in contrast to the standard
phrase-based model, which considers only the local context in the label. The results show
little improvements over the baseline scores for most of the evaluation metrics, thus proving
that exploring the ontology context based disambiguation may be beneficial in the process
of translating the ontologies. Nevertheless, more research is needed in that direction
in order to attain better results. As future work, we plan to investigate better ways of
exploiting the ontological context for machine translation of labels and to compare our
system against the Label-Translator.
