Abstract
This paper presents the first description of the
motion subcorpus of ISO-SpaceBank (Mo-
tionBank) and discusses how motion-events
are represented in ISO-Space 1.5, a specifi-
cation language for the representation of spa-
tial information in language. We present data
from this subcorpus with examples from the
pilot annotation, focusing specifically on the
annotation of motion-events and their various
participants. These data inform further discus-
sion of outstanding issues concerning seman-
tic annotation, such as quantification and mea-
surement. We address these questions briefly
as they impact the design of ISO-Space.

1 Introduction

The goal of ISO-Space is to provide a specification
of an annotation language for encoding spatial and
spatiotemporal information as expressed in natural
language texts. Section 2 enumerates the elements
of syntax in ISO-Space 1.5. Section 3 presents data
from the MotionBank pilot annoation effort (a sub-
corpus of ISO-SpaceBank). In the subsequent dis-
cussion we focus specifically on relations pertaining
to motion, and discuss only limited aspects of topo-
logical, orientational, and measurement relations.
Section 4 contains discussion of outstanding issues
and how they may be tackled.

ISO-Space is being developed as a comprehensive
foundation for the annotation of spatial information
in natural language text. While there are clearly
many issues remaining, we have attempted to fol-
low a strict methodology of specification develop-
ment, as adopted by ISO TC37/SC4 and outlined in

(Bunt, 2010) and (Ide and Romary, 2004), and as
implemented with the development of ISO-TimeML
(Pustejovsky et al., 2005) and others in the family of
SemAF standards.

As reported in (Pustejovsky et al., 2013), ISO-
Space is designed to capture both spatial and spa-
tiotemporal information. While still in development,
it is clear that the conceptual inventory for spatial
language annotation must at least include the follow-
ing notions:

(1) a. Locations (regions, spatial objects):
Geographic and geopolitical places.

b. Entities participating in spatial relations.
c. Paths: routes, lines, turns, arcs.
d. Topological relations: in, connected.
e. Direction and Orientation: North, down.
f. Time and space measurements: 20 miles

away, for two hours.
g. Object properties: intrinsic orientation,

dimensionality.
h. Frames of Reference: absolute, intrinsic,

relative.
i. Motion: tracking objects over time.

In the following discussion, we report on the annota-
tion of motion-events and participants, as part of the
developing ISO-SpaceBank corpus, and discuss the
issues arising with incorporating movement within a
spatial representation language.

2 ISO-Space 1.5

In this section, we present a brief description of the
ISO-Space 1.5 specification. Note that examples are
annotated only with those syntactic elements and at-
tributes which are relevant to the discussion.

2.1 Location Tags
Place Tag The attributes for the PLACE tag are
largely inherited from SpatialML (Mani et al.,
2010), with some minor additions. This tag is used
to annotate geographic entities like lakes and moun-
tains, as well as administrative entities like towns
and counties.

(2) a. I camped next to the municipal [buildingpl1].
PLACE(id=pl1, form=NOM, dcl=FALSE,
countable=TRUE)

b. I traveled north to northern [Lago Maracaibopl2].
PLACE(id=pl2, form=NAM, dcl=FALSE,

countable=TRUE)

The form attribute distinguishes nominal forms
(2a) from regions with proper names (2b).

The ISO-Space mod attribute is included here be-
cause it is substantially different from its counterpart
in SpatialML (MITRE, 2007).1 The ISO-Space mod
attribute is intended to capture cases like tall build-
ing, long trail, or the higher observation deck, where
tall, long and higher do not constrain the location of
the entity but they do contribute spatial information.

ISO-Space locations tags includes a Document
Creation Location or dcl attribute. The DCL is a
special location that serves as the “narrative loca-
tion”. If a document includes a dcl, it is generally
specified at the beginning of the text, similarly to
the manner in which a Document Creation Time is
specified in TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).

The countable attribute is used to distinguish
regions referred to with countable sortals (cities,
lakes) and mass sortals (highlands, countryside).

Path Tag The PATH tag is used to capture loca-
tions where the focus is on the potential for traversal
or functions as a boundary. This includes common
nouns as in (3a) and (3b), as well as proper names as
in (3c). The attributes of the PATH tag are a subset
of the attributes of the PLACE tag, but with the addi-
tional beginID, endID, and midIDs attributes.
The PATH tag is intended to capture only non-
eventive paths, which are treated as inherently non-
directional. As such, the beginID and endID at-
tributes simply indicate bounding points rather than

1Given this discrepancy with SpatialML, it is likely that the
ISO-Space annotator will have to perform some “clean-up” of
the PLACE elements that are inherited from a SpatialML anno-
tation. This issue will be taken up in the annotation guidelines,
though, as it is not relevant to this specification.

directionality. Table 1 summarizes the attributes for
the PATH tag.

(3) a. . . . I arrived at the end of the [roadp1].
b. . . . a massive mountain [rangep2] that hugs the west

[coastp3] of Mexico.
c. I followed the [Pacific Coast Highwayp4] along the

coastal mountains . . .

Non-Consuming Location Tags It is often useful
to identify locations that are not mentioned explic-
itly in the text. In such cases, ISO-Space allows for
non-consuming location tags. For example, a non-
consuming PLACE tag would be necessary in the
case of John climbed to 9,000 feet where the eleva-
tion 9,000 feet indirectly references a location that is
not associated with any extent in the text.

2.2 Non-Location Tags
While location tags essentially designate a region of
space that can be related to other regions on space,
ISO-Space allows for non-location elements of a text
to be coerced into behaving like a region of space so
that they may participate in the same kinds of re-
lationships. There are three of these kinds of non-
location tags that may behave like locations in ISO-
Space: SPATIAL E, EVENT and MOTION.2

Spatial Entity The SPATIAL E (spatial entity) tag
is intended to capture any entity that is both located
in space and participates in an ISO-Space link tag,
as illustrated in (4). Attributes include: id, form,
mod, countable, and quant.

(4) [Davidse1] passed three [carsse2] on the road.
2Note that, depending on the annotation task, annotating

these tags may not be the responsibility of the ISO-Space an-
notator. Instead, capturing this kind of information may be left
to other annotation schemes and it will be left to the ISO-Space
annotator to recognize when such an element should participate
in an ISO-Space link tag.

26



Event The EVENT tag captures events that do not
involve a change of location but are directly related
to another ISO-Space element by way of a link.
Events are inherited directly from the ISO-TimeML
annotation scheme (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) and re-
quire no further specification in ISO-Space.

Spatial Signal The SPATIAL SIGNAL tag captures
relation words or phrases that supply information
to an ISO-Space link tag. Signals are typically
prepositions or other function words that specify the
particular relationship between two ISO-Space el-
ements. Attributes include: id, cluster, and
semantic type.

Adjunct The ADJUNCT tag captures additional
event-path or manner-of-motion information that is
not contributed directly by a motion verb, but rather
by a satellite word or phrase. PATH motion adjuncts
are often prepositions (e.g, to and from). Adjuncts of
type MANNER supply manner of motion information
(e.g., by car). Notice in (5d) that multiple adjuncts
may contribute to a single motion.

(5) a. John walked [toa1] the store.
b. John left [fora2] Boston.
c. John traveled [by cara3].
d. John arrived [by bikea4] [ata5] the trailhead.

Measure The MEASURE tag is used to capture dis-
tances and dimensions for use in an MLINK or to fill
the elevation attribute for a location tag. See
(Pustejovsky et al., 2013) for more details.

2.3 Spatial Relation Links
There are four relationship tags in ISO-Space de-
fined as follows:

(6) a. QSLINK – for qualitative spatial relations;
b. OLINK – for orientation relations;
c. MOVELINK – for movement relations;
d. MLINK – for dimensions of a region or the

distance between locations.

Qualitative Spatial Link QSLINKs are used in
ISO-Space to capture topological relationships be-
tween tag elements captured in the annotation. The
relType attribute values come from an extension
to the RCC8 set of relations that was first used by
SpatialML. The possible RCC8+ values include the
RCC8 values (Randell et al., 1992), in addition to IN,
a disjunction of TPP and NTPP (cf. Table 2).

Relation Description
DC Disconnected
EC External Connection
PO Partial Overlap
EQ Equal
TPP Tangential Proper Part
TPPi Inverse of TTP
NTTP Non-Tangential Proper Part
NTTPi Inverse of NTTP
IN Disjunction of TTP and NTTP

Table 2: RCC8+ Relations.

It is worth noting that while the QSLINK tag is used
exclusively for capturing topological relationships,
which are only possible between two regions, the
figure and ground attributes can accept IDs for
both PLACEs and PATHs, which are more traditional
regions, as well as SPATIAL Es, EVENTs, and MO-
TIONs. In the latter cases, it is actually the region
of space that is associated with the location of the
entity or event that participates in the QSLINK. That
is, the entity or event is coerced to a region for the
purposes of interpreting this link.

In practice, a QSLINK is triggered by a SPA-
TIAL SIGNAL with a semantic type of TOPO-
LOGICAL or DIR TOP (cf. (7) below).

(7) [The bookse1] is [ons1] [the tablese2].
SPATIAL SIGNAL(id=s1, cluster=“on-1”,
semantic type= DIR TOP)

QSLINK(id=qsl1, figure=sne1, ground=sne2,

trigger=s1, relType=EC)

Orientation Link Orientation links describe non-
topological relationships. A SPATIAL SIGNAL with
a DIRECTIONAL semantic type triggers such
a link. In contrast to qualitative spatial relations,
OLINK relations are built around a specific frame of
reference type and a reference point. The attributes
for OLINK are listed in Table 3.

The referencePt value depends on the
frame type of the link. The ABSOLUTE frame
type stipulates that the referencePt is a car-
dinal direction. For INTRINSIC OLINKs, the
referencePt is the same identifier that is given
in the ground attribute. For RELATIVE OLINKs,
the identifier for the viewer should be provided as to
the referencePt. If the viewer is not explicit in
the text, the special value “VIEWER” should be used.
Examples of this link are illustrated in (8).

(8) a. [Bostonpl1] is [north ofs1] [New York Citypl2].

Table 3: OLINK Attributes.

trigger=s1, relType=“NORTH”,
frame type=ABSOLUTE,
referencePt=“NORTH”,

b. [The dogse1] is [in front ofs2] [the couchse2].
OLINK(id=ol2, figure=sne1,

ground=sne2, trigger=s2,

relType=“FRONT”, frame type=INTRINSIC,

referencePt=sne2, projective=FALSE)

Measure Link Measurement relationships are
captured with the MLINK tag, as first proposed for
ISO-TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). Currently,
this tag describes either the relationship between two
spatial objects or the dimensions of a single object
(cf. Table 4).

Attribute Value
id ml1, ml2, ml3,. . .
figure ID of the location/entity/event event

that is being related to the ground
ground ID of the location/entity/event

that is being related to by the figure
relType DISTANCE, LENGTH, WIDTH,

HEIGHT, or GENERAL DIMENSION

NEAR, FAR, TALLER, SHORTER,
endPoint1 ID of a location/entity/event

at one end of a stative path
endPoint2 ID of a location/entity/event

at the other end of a stative path

Table 4: MLINK Attributes.

When an MLINK is used to capture an internal di-
mension of an object as in (9b) or (9c), the ID of
that object should appear in the figure attribute.
The annotator may either repeat the identifier in the
ground attribute or leave the ground unspecified.

(9) a. The new [tropical depressionse1] was about [430
milesme1] ([690 kilometersme2]) west of the
[southernmost Cape Verde Islandpl1], they said.
MLINK(id=ml1, relType=DISTANCE,
figure=sne1, ground=pl1, val=me1)

b. [The football fieldse2] is [100 yardsme2] long.
MLINK (id=ml2, relType=LENGTH,
figure=sne2, ground=sne2, val=me2)

c. I [rodem1] [30 milesme4] yesterday.
MLINK (id=ml6, relType=general dimen,

figure=m1, ground=m1, val=me4)

2.4 Movement
The treatment of movement in ISO-Space draws
heavily from the foundations of lexical semantics in
(Talmy, 1985) and the motion-event classifications
in (Muller, 1998) and (Pustejovsky and Moszkow-
icz, 2008). There are two ISO-Space tags which
capture movement: MOTION and MOVELINK.

Motion Tag The ISO-Space MOTION tag is a
species of TimeML event that involves a change of
location or spatial configuration. Table 5 lists the
attributes of the MOTION tag.

Attribute Value
id m1, m2, m3, . . .
motion type MANNER, PATH, COMPOUND
motion class MOVE, MOVE EXTERNAL,

MOVE INTERNAL, LEAVE,
REACH, DETACH, HIT, FOLLOW,
DEVIATE, CROSS, STAY

motion sense LITERAL, FICTIVE,
INTRINSIC CHANGE

Table 5: MOTION Tag Attributes.
The motion type attribute refers to the two

major strategies for expressing movement in lan-
guage: path and manner-of-motion constructions
(Talmy, 1985). This is illustrated in (10), where m
indicates a manner contributing component, and p
indicates a path contributing component. In the first
sentence, the motion verb specifies a path whereas
in the second the motion verb specifies the manner
of motion. The motions in these sentences are ac-
tually of the motion type COMPOUND since they
supply both path and manner information.

(10) a. John arrivedp [by foot]m.
b. John hoppedm [out of the room]p.

Motion classes are taken from (Pustejovsky and
Moszkowicz, 2008), which in turn are based on
those in (Muller, 1998). These classes are associ-
ated with a spatial event structure that specifies the

28



spatial relations between the arguments of the mo-
tion verb at different phases of the event. Table 6
lists the set of motion classes and their associated
motion-event structures.

The motion sense attribute distinguishes be-
tween different kinds of interpretations of motion-
events. The LITERAL sense covers motion-events
where the mover participant’s location changes over
time. The FICTIVE sense covers cases where the
event involves an atemporal, experiential change
in an extrinsic property (e.g., elevation or loca-
tion). The INTRINSIC CHANGE sense covers motion
verbs that describe change in some intrinsic, spa-
tial characteristic (e.g., height, width, length, shape,
etc.). The motivation here is to disambiguate lan-
guage like the balloon rose above the building from
the river rose above the levy, where a LITERAL
interpretation—the river’s elevation increased—is
inappropriate: the location of the eleavtion of the
river is supervenient on the change in the volume
of the river, therefore signaling an intrinsic change.3

The motion sense attribute also captures FIC-
TIVE motion interpretations such as, the mountain
rises above the valley, where there is no temporal
interpretation—the mountain’s elevation increasing
over time—but rather a purely spatial, atemporal in-
terpretaion predicating spatial characteristics of the
mountain over some region.

Movelink Tag MOVELINK tags, which are intro-
duced by MOTION tags, capture information about
the path or course a particular motion takes. Table 7
lists the attributes of the MOVELINK link.

The event structures for MOVE EXTERNAL and
MOVE INTERNAL motion-events require a ground
location relative to which the motion of the mover
participant occurs. This location is identified with
the ground attribute introduced in Table 7 and its
use is demonstrated in Example (11a).

Another attribute introduced in Table 7 is
adjunctID. This attribute takes the identifier
of an ATTRIBUTE tag that contributes path or
manner information about the event-path of the
MOVELINK’s triggering motion-event. The use of

3While this could be an instance of a metonymic sense ex-
tension, such as the kettle boiled (per a reviewer’s suggestion),
we believe this is more specific to the entailments associated
with an intrinsic change in an object’s spatial extent.

2.5 Annotation vs. Axioms
It is important to note that ISO-Space’s inventory of
explicit representations does not capture the whole
picture. Some representations are introduced at
the level of abstract syntax by specific axiomatic
rules. We introduce the assumed premises for mo-
tion briefly, and defer details to the final paper.

Mover Participants The first axiom pertaining to
motion in ISO-Space is that, for every motion-event,

midPoints, goal end[IN(mover, goal)]
STAY mover, ground begin...end[{{RCC8+},{OLINK}}(mover, ground)]

Table 6: Motion Class Event Structures

there exists an entity which fulfills the role of mover
for that event. The mover is that participant in the
motion-event which undergoes a change in its loca-
tion. That is to say:
(12) ∀e∃x[motion-event(e) → mover(x, e)]

Event Paths The other essential component of
ISO-Space that is generated axiomatically is the
event-path created by the mover associated with a
motion-event. That is to say:
(13) ∀e∃p[motion-event(e) → [event-path(p) ∧

loc(e, p)]]

Previous versions of the ISO-Space specification in-
cluded an event-path tag as part of the concrete syn-
tax, distinct from the non-eventive PATH tag. In fact,
the source, goal, midPoint and pathID
attributes of the MOVELINK tag presume an event-
path (although these attributes are often underspec-
ified). The primary motivation for the removal of
event-paths as their own category in the concrete
syntax is that our abstract syntax axiomatically in-
troduces an event-path for each motion-event.4

This decision simplifies the annotation task in that
annotators need only identify features of the event-
path if the language contributes information about
the path of traversal. A bare-manner motion verb,
as in David cycles seriously, for instance, introduces
a completely underspecified event-path. Thus, the
following annotation in 14 would be sufficient.

(14) [Davidse1] [cyclesm1] seriously.
SPATIAL E (id=sne1, text=“David”, form=NAM)
MOTION (id=m1, text=“cycles”,
motion type=MANNER, motion class=MOVE,
motion sense=LITERAL)

4Discussions from participants at ISA-7 and ISA-8 were in-
strumental in leading to this modification in the specification.

MOVELINK (id=mvl1, trigger=m1, source=∅,
goal=∅, midPoint=∅, mover=sne1, ground=∅,
goal reached=∅, pathID=∅, adjunctID=∅)

3 ISO-SpaceBank Subcorpus Data
The data in this section are tabulated from the pi-
lot annotation of MotionBank, a subcorpus of ISO-
SpaceBank consisting of 50 entries (20,877 word to-
kens) from a travel blog whose author cycled across
the Americas. Table 8 presents a breakdown of the
tag counts for each ISO-Space tag type. Table 9 lists
the counts for each class of motion over the same
subcorpus by frequency.

Table 8: Tag Counts
To best illustrate the annotation of motion and the

various participants, we present one detailed exam-
ple in full. Sentence (15) is spatially quite rich and it
is also notable for the figurative language that is em-
ployed. The first item of note is the non-consuming
place tag that has been created. In this case the MEA-
SURE ID of over 6,000 feet fills the elevation at-
tribute of the non-consuming place tag. The ID of
this PLACE tag is then used later to fill the goal lo-
cation for the MOVELINK triggered by m3 (climbs).

The second thing to note is that the
motion sense attributes for all the MOTION

4 Discussion

Several interesting issues arose during the initial mo-
tion annotation efforts with ISO-Space. The first
concerns how to handle ‘simulated’ motion-events.
Such events are the kind typical in direction-giving
language where a direction-giver may specify a path
that is intended to be followed without explicitly
specifying a mover participant: Walk 100 meters and
turn right after the store. Initially, this was dealt
with by providing an additional motion sense
value, called SIMULATED, in order to distinguish
such uses from the FICTIVE, LITERAL, and INTRIN-
SIC CHANGE motion senses. After further corpus
investigation, however, we have determined that this
is a narrative modality rather than a specific sense
distinction exploited for motion verbs. This deserves
further modeling and we are currently investigating
this topic.

Another issue that arises, although interestingly,
not represented in the present corpus, involves the
use of extent verbs (Gawron, 2009). This use is
seen in the following: Past the brook, the road nar-
rows. This shares semantic elements with the FIC-
TIVE sense, but introduces additional constraints not
accompanying those uses (as in the road climbs,
etc.). This is also currently under further investiga-
tion.

It is worth pointing out that quantification
presents itself again as an issue. ISO-Space 1.4 pro-
vides countable and quant attributes for loca-
tion tags, however these features alone remain in-
sufficient for a complete motion-events semantics.
Consider (16), for instance. The annotation cap-
tures the quantification over valley with the PATH tag
p1, and the MOVELINK (mvl1) triggered by passed
(m1) specifies p1 as a midPoint location.

MOVELINK (id=mvl1, trigger=m1,

For a proper semantic interpretation, it is essen-
tial to produce an interpretation for this sentence
where m1 falls under the scope of the quantifier ev-
ery. That is, for every valley, there exists a pass-
ing motion-event. A partial translation is as follows,
where through is a stand in for the appropriate QS-
LINK relation value.
(17) ∀p1∃m1[[valley(p1) ∧ small(p1) →

[pass(m1) ∧ through(m1, p1)]]
In addressing this issue, ISO-Space 1.5 draws from
TimeML’s treatment of event quantification in (Bunt
and Pustejovsky, 2010; Pustejovsky et al., 2010), to
handle examples such as John taught every Tuesday.
ISO-TimeML captures quantificational scoping re-
lations with a scopes(scoper, scopee) relation. We
propose to extend the tag attributes in the ISO-Space
with a scopes attribute to capture such relations.

Finally, another desideratum that has been made
evident by the pilot annotation data is the ability
to capture motion when it occurs in nominal form.
That is not to say that all motion-event nominals
ought to be treated as instances of motion. For ex-
ample, while a vacation to Mexico seems to entail
travel, a summer vacation may not. Additionnally,
the participants of motion-event nominals are of-
ten underspecified. The pilot annotation guidelines
did not sufficiently address the possibility of under-
specified mover participants, and consequently, the
EVENT tag was employed for nominalized motion-
events. Examples from MotionBank where this con-
fusion occurred are italicized in the sentences in Ex-
ample (18).

(18) a. The last few days of the trip were difficult, including
an 8,000 feet climb into the Andes.

b. According to Ricardo, bicycle use has increased 5
times in the city, and now there are probably between
300,000 and 400,000 trips made daily in Bogota by
bicycle.

c. Passing through more towns and more climbs and
descents on one lane dirt roads, I eventually climbed
into the Cordillera Blanca . . .

d. I also received a tour of the town from three high
school students . . .

e. I have now arrived in Yurimaguas, a small city in the
jungle, thus ending my two weeks of boat travel on
the world’s largest river system.

f. Many people I have stayed with on this trip live in
small houses, are poor, own no car, and have little
healthcare.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented an initial descrip-
tion of the motion subcorpus of the ISO-Space spec-
ification for spatiotemporal and spatial markup of
natural language text. Through this discussion we
hope to vet some of the remaining issues we have
encountered with annotating movement phenemona
in natural language. Our expectation is to release
the completed MotionBank sub-corpus in June 2013
and subsequently the full SpaceBank corpus in Jan-
uary 2014.
