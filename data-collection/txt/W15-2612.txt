Abstract

Distant supervision is a useful technique
for creating relation classifiers in the ab-
sence of labelled data. The approaches are
often evaluated using a held-out portion of
the distantly labelled data, thereby avoid-
ing the need for lablelled data entirely.
However, held-out evaluation means that
systems are tested against noisy data, mak-
ing it difficult to determine their true ac-
curacy. This paper examines the effec-
tiveness of using held-out data to evalu-
ate relation extraction systems by com-
paring the results that are produced with
those generated using manually labelled
versions of the same data. We train clas-
sifiers to detect two UMLS Metathesaurus
relations (may-treat and may-prevent) in
Medline abstracts. A new evaluation data
set for these relations is made available.
We show that evaluation against a distantly
labelled gold standard tends to overesti-
mate performance and that no direct con-
nection can be found between improved
performance against distantly and manu-
ally labelled gold standards.

1 Introduction

Relation extraction is a popular topic in the
biomedical domain and has been the subject of
several challenges (e.g. DDI challenge (Segura-
Bedmar et al., 2013), BioNLP Shared Task
(Nédellec et al., 2013)). Many approaches rely
on supervised learning techniques using manually
labelled training data. However, the creation of
annotated training data is time-consuming, expen-
sive and often requires expert knowledge.

Distant supervision (self-supervised learning) is
a widely applied technique for training relation ex-
traction systems (Wu and Weld, 2007; Krause et
al., 2012; Roth and Klakow, 2013; Ritter et al.,
2013; Vlachos and Clark, 2014) that avoids the
need for annotated training data. Training exam-
ples are annotated automatically using a knowl-
edge base. Facts from the knowledge base are
matched against text and used as training exam-
ples. For example, a knowledge base may as-
sert that the entity pair CONDITION(“hair loss”)-
DRUG(“paroxetine”) is an instance of the re-
lationship adverse-drug effect. Distant supervi-
sion approaches normally assume that sentences
containing both entities assert the relation be-
tween them and, consequently, the following sen-
tence would be used as a positive example of the
adverse-drug effect relation:

“Findings on discontinuation and
rechallenge supported the assumption
that the hair loss was a side effect of the
paroxetine.” (PMID=10442258)

However, this assumption does not always hold
which can lead to sentences containing entity pairs
being mistakenly identified as asserting a particu-
lar relation between them. For example, the fol-
lowing sentence contains the same entity pair but
does not assert the adverse-drug effect relation:

“There are a few case reports on
hair loss associated with tricyclic
antidepressants and serotonin selec-
tive reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but
none deal specifically with paroxetine.”
(PMID=10442258)

Consequently, data annotated using distant su-
pervision is noisy and unlikely to be of as high

97



quality as manually labelled data. Despite this dis-
tantly supervised relation extraction provides rea-
sonable results compared to those based on super-
vised learning (see e.g. in (Thomas et al., 2011)).

Distant supervision allows relation extraction
systems to be created without manually labelled
data. However, this raises the issue of how such
a system can be evaluated. Previous approaches
have carried out evaluation using existing data
sets labelled with examples of the target relation
(Bellare and Mccallum, 2007; Nguyen and Mos-
chitti, 2011; Min et al., 2013) or a similar relation
(Thomas et al., 2011; Roller and Stevenson, 2014).
However, in the majority of scenarios the best use
for any labeled data available is as training data.
Others, such as Craven and Kumlien (1999), gen-
erated their own gold standard to annotate relevant
relations of their knowledge base. But the effort
required to generate manually labelled evaluation
data somewhat negates the benefit of reduced de-
velopment time provided by distant supervision.

An alternative approach, which does not require
any labelled data, is held-out evaluation. This ap-
proach splits facts from the knowledge base into
two parts: one to generate distantly supervised
training data and the other to generate distantly
supervised evaluation data (Mintz et al., 2009;
Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2010; Roller
et al., 2015).

This approach is often combined with a man-
ual evaluation in which a subset of the predictions
is selected to be examined in more detail. For
example, Riedel et al. (2010) supplemented the
held-out evaluation of their distant supervision ap-
proach for Freebase by selecting the top 1000 facts
it predicted and evaluating them manually. Others
such as Surdeanu et al. (2012) and Intxaurrondo
et al. (2013) work with the same knowledge base
and are able to re-use the manually labelled data
generated by Riedel et al. (2010). However, this
data is only available for some Freebase relations
and evaluation data has to be generated for each
new relation. Approaches such as Takamatsu et al.
(2012), Zhang et al. (2013) and Augenstein et al.
(2014) combine a held-out evaluation with a man-
ual evaluation of a randomly chosen subset or the
top-k predictions. This technique is a more reli-
able evaluation method but requires more effort in-
cluding (potentially) domain knowledge and needs
to be repeated for each version of the classifier.

Held-out evaluation using distantly labelled

data is a simple and quick technique for estimat-
ing the accuracy of distantly supervised relation
extraction systems. However, this evaluation data
is noisy and it is unclear what effect this has on the
accuracy of performance estimates.

The issue is explored in this paper by evaluating
relation extraction systems for two biomedical re-
lations using both manually and distantly labelled
data. We automatically generate labelled held-out
data and then carry out a manual annotation to
allow direct comparison. A distantly supervised
classifier is trained and evaluated on both data sets.
Similar as in Xu et al. (2013) we show that a large
portion of the labels generated by distant super-
vision for the two relations are incorrect. How-
ever we find that evaluating classifiers using held-
out distantly supervised data tends to overestimate
performance compared to manually labelled data
and that improvements in performance observed
in evaluation against distantly supervised data are
not necessarily reflected in improved results when
measured against manually labelled data. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first direct com-
parison of evaluating distantly supervised classi-
fiers against distantly and manually labelled gold
standards. Analysis in previous work has been re-
stricted to determining the true labels for a set of
positively predicted labels.

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. The next section 2 describes the creation
of the distantly supervised data and a manually
labelled subset. A comparison of the automati-
cally and manually generated labels is carried out
in Section 3. Sections 4 evaluates a relation extrac-
tion system using different data sets and compares
the performance obtained. The paper concludes
with section 5.

2 Data Generation

A large set of distantly labelled examples was gen-
erated (Section 2.1). A small portion of these were
used as held-out test data. This data set was also
manually annotated (Section 2.2).

2.1 Distant labelling

Distantly labelled examples are generated using
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
Metathesaurus as a knowledge source. UMLS is a
large biomedical knowledge base which contains
information about millions of medical concepts
and the relations between them, making it well

Table 1: Comparison of manual and distantly labelled annotations

suited for distant supervision. Two biomedical re-
lations (may-treat and may-prevent) were selected
from UMLS. These relations describe connections
between a pharmacological substance (e.g. drug)
and a disease. For example, the following sentence
expresses a may-prevent relationship between the
entities fluoride and dental caries:

“Although fluoride is clearly a major
reason for the decline in the preva-
lence of dental caries, there are no
studies of the incremental benefit of
in-office fluoride treatments for low-
risk patients exposed to fluoridated wa-
ter and using fluoridated toothpaste.”
(PMID=10698247)

Training data for the two relations was gener-
ated from approximately 1 million biomedical ab-
stracts from Medline1 annotated with UMLS con-
cepts by MetaMap2 (Aronson and Lang, 2010).
Sentences containing concepts that are identified
as being related in the UMLS’s MRREL table were
selected and used as positive examples.3 Nega-
tive examples were generated using a closed word
assumption: pairs of concepts that are not listed
as being related in UMLS for a given relation are
considered to be negative examples of that rela-
tion. Such pairs are generated by considering all
possible pairs from a particular relation and creat-
ing new pairs from the set of entities.

2.2 Test Data
A set of 400 distantly labelled sentences were ran-
domly selected for each relation to generate held-
out test data. Although the distantly labelled data
contains more negatively labelled sentences than
positive ones, equal numbers of positive and neg-
ative examples (200 of each) are selected in order
to ensure that a sufficient number of positive in-
stances are included in the data set. The sentences

related Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs).

in this data set were selected so that none of the in-
stance pairs occur in the data used for training. We
refer to this data set as DL (Distantly Labelled).

The DL data set was then manually annotated.
Two annotators were recruited, both of whom
were studying graduate degrees in subjects related
to medicine at our institution. Given a sentence
with a highlighted pharmacological substance and
a highlighted disease, the annotators had to deter-
mine whether a sentence expresses the relation-
ship of interest between two presented entities or
not. The annotators were not shown the labels gen-
erated by the distant supervision process. The an-
notators were asked to only label sentences as pos-
itive if it contains a clear indication that the phar-
macological substance either treats or prevents the
disease. For example, the following sentence men-
tions that a study has been carried out to determine
whether the drug voriconazole treats paracoccid-
ioidomycosis:

“A pilot study was conducted to investi-
gate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
of voriconazole for the long-term treat-
ment of acute or chronic paracoccid-
ioidomycosis, with itraconazole as the
control treatment.” (PMID=17990229)

However, the sentence does not contain any indi-
cation that the drug successfully treats the disease
and should therefore be annotated as a negative ex-
ample of the relation.

The annotators were asked to label all 400 sen-
tences and then re-examine any for which there
was disagreement. Inter-annotator agreement (Co-
hen, 1960) after this stage was of κ = 0.91 for
may-treat and κ = 0.94 for may-prevent. Remain-
ing disagreements were resolved by one of the au-
thors based on comments provided by both anno-
tators and the annotation guidelines. The manually
annotated version of the data set is referred to as
ML (Manually Labelled).4

3 Label Comparison

Table 1 shows differences in the annotations for
the two techniques for labelling that data. The ML
data set for may-treat contains 173 positive and
227 negative examples, whereas the ML data set
for may-prevent contains 139 positives and 261
negatives examples. A comparison of the DL
and ML data sets shows that 40.25% of the la-
bels changed for may-treat and 39.75% for may-
prevent. The distant supervision process generated
more false positives than false negatives for both
relations.

If we assume that we have a classifier that is
able to identify the may-treat and may-prevent re-
lations with perfect accuracy then performance
on the ML data sets would be precision=1.0, re-
call=1.0 and f-score=1.0. However, the false la-
bels on the DL data sets would lead to perfor-
mance of the same classifiers being estimated as
precision=0.61, recall=0.53 and f-score=0.57 for
may-treat and precision=0.61, recall=0.43 and f-
score=0.50 for may-prevent. Hence, the two data
sets may provide quite different estimates of sys-
tem performance and we explore this in more de-
tail in the next section.

4 Relation Extraction

A distantly supervised relation classifier was eval-
uated using manually and distantly labelled ver-
sions of the test data. Classifiers were trained for
both relations and evaluated using both data sets
(DL and ML). The evaluation was carried out us-
ing entity level evaluation, i.e. precision and recall
are computed based on the proportion of correctly
identified entity pairs which occur in sentences la-
beled as positive examples (according to the anno-

tations contained within DL or ML). Entity level
evaluation is commonly used to evaluate distantly
supervised relation extraction systems. Similar re-
sults have been observed using the alternative ap-
proach of sentence level evaluation in which pre-
cision and recall are computed by examining the
prediction for each sentence.

We use MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2010), a multi-
instance learning system that has been shown to
provide state of the art results for distantly super-
vised relation extraction. The features used are
those described by Surdeanu et al. (2011). The
system is trained using distantly labelled examples
(Section 2.1) of the may-treat and may-prevent re-
lations containing equal numbers of positive and
negative instances. The number of training exam-
ples is varied from 2,000 to 16,000 in increments
of 2,000.

Results are shown in Table 2. Highlighted fig-
ures indicate the data set (DL or ML) against
which the highest score was obtained for each met-
ric (prec., rec. and f1) and configuration (relation
and number of training examples). In general in-
creasing the amount of training data leads to im-
proved results on the DL data. In particular an in-
crease in precision is observed when there is more
training data. However, a different pattern is ob-
served for the ML data and increasing the amount
of training data does not always lead to an im-
provement in the f1-score. Results also show that
the performance estimates obtained using the DL
and ML data sets are only loosely associated. The
results are similar for smaller training data sets but
diverge as the amount of training data increases.

The table also shows that for both relations the
performance estimates using the DL data are in
general higher than those obtained using ML. This

100



trend becomes more pronounced as the amount of
training data used increases. The most likely rea-
son for this difference is that the classifiers are
trained using distantly supervised data and there-
fore model the labels in the DL data set more
closely than those in found in ML.

These results demonstrate that evaluation using
distantly labelled gold standard data tends to over-
estimate performance. In some cases the discrep-
ancy is large (up to 18.58 for may-prevent and
13.76 for may-treat). However, it does not seem
to be consistent or particularly predictable. Con-
sequently, improving the performance of a rela-
tion extraction system relative to distantly labelled
evaluation data does not necessarily imply an in-
crease in performance when measured against a
manually annotated gold-standard.

5 Conclusion

This paper explored the effect of evaluating
biomedical relation extraction systems using held-
out test data annotated using distant supervision.
Test data for two biomedical relations was an-
notated using distant supervision and also man-
ually annotated. The manual and automatic la-
bels differed for a large portion of the sentences.
A distantly supervised relation extraction system
was also evaluated using both data sets. We
found that evaluation using held-out distantly su-
pervised data tended to overestimate performance
and that the connection between improved per-
formance against distantly and manually labelled
data was unclear. The use of held-out distantly la-
belled data is a cheap and efficient way to evalu-
ate relation extraction systems, however this anal-
ysis demonstrates that the results obtained should
be treated with some caution and, ideally, systems
should also be evaluated against manually labelled
data.

The results presented here were obtained for
two biomedical relations. In future we plan to ex-
tend our analysis to a wider set of relations.
