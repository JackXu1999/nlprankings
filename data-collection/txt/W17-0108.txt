1 Introduction 

In this paper we present a case study of how 
comprehensive, well-structured, and consistent 
lexical databases, one indicating the exact 
inflectional subtype of each word and another 
exhaustively listing the full paradigm for each 
inflectional subtype, can be quickly and reliably 
converted into a computational model of the 
finite-state transducer (FST) kind. As our 
example language, we will use (Northern) East 
Cree (Algonquian, ISO 639-3: crl), a 
morphologically complex Indigenous language. 
We will focus on modeling (Northern) East Cree 
verbs, as their paradigms represent the most 
richly inflected forms in this language.  

2 Background on East Cree 

East Cree is a Canadian Indigenous language 
spoken by over 12,000 people in nine 
communities situated in the James Bay region of 
Northern Quebec. It is still learned by children as 
their first language and fluently spoken in 
schools and in the communities overall, involved 
in most spheres of life as an oral language. 
Speakers have basic literacy in East Cree, but 
written communication tends to be in English or, 
to a lesser extent, French. The language is fairly 
well documented, with main resources available 
on a web site (www.eastcree.org) that includes 
multilingual dictionaries of two dialects (English, 
French, East Cree Northern and Southern 
dialects), thematic dictionaries, an interactive 
grammar, verb conjugation applets, oral stories, 
interactive lessons and exercises, a book 
catalogue, and other various resources like 
typing tools for the syllabics used, tutorials, 
spelling manuals, and so forth. 

3 Verb structure 

The verb in Northern East Cree follows the 
general Algonquian structure. Verbs fall into 
four major types according to transitivity and the 
animacy of the participants (intransitive with 
inanimate, or no, subject: II; intransitive with 
animate subject: AI; transitive with animate 
subject and inanimate object: TI; and transitive 
with animate subject and animate object: TA). 
Verbs are inflected for the person of the subject 
and/or object, and for modality. There are three 
major types of inflections, with their specific 
properties, known as orders: independent, 
conjunct, and imperative. As can be seen in the 
examples below, only the independent forms 
have person prefixes, while for conjunct and 
imperative forms person is only marked in the 
suffixes. 

The orders can be divided into sub-
paradigms according to how modality is marked 
in the post-verbal suffix complex. For Northern 
East Cree, a total of 15 distinct sub-paradigms 
have been identified, 7 for independent, 6 for 
conjunct, and 2 for imperative (Junker & 
MacKenzie, 2015), taking a classical Word-and-
Paradigm approach (Blevins, 2011). In addition, 
verb stems can be combined with several pre-
stem elements, known as preverbs, which can be 
divided into grammatical and lexical ones and 
which functionally correspond to auxiliary verbs 
or adverbials in English. For example, the 
preverb chî(h) indicates ‘past’ tense, wî ‘want’, 
and nitû ‘go and V’. These are illustrated in 
examples (1a-c) below.  

 

(1a) INDEPENDENT INDIRECT 
 chichî wî nitû mîchisunâtik 
 chi-chî wî nitû mîchisu-n-âtik 
 2-PAST WANT GO eat.AI-1/2SG-INDIRECT 
 ‘You wanted to go eating (so I was told)’

(1b)  CONJUNCT DUBITATIVE PRETERITE 
 châ sâchihîtiwâhchipinâ  
 châ sâchih-îti-w-âhch-ipin-â  
 FUT love.TA-INV-DUB-1PL→2(PL)-PRET-DUB 
 ‘If only we could love you’ 
 

(1c) IMPERATIVE IMMEDIATE  
 sâchihînân 
 sâchih-înân 
 love.TA-2(PL)→1PL 
 ‘(You [sg. or pl.]) love us!’ 
 

As for orthographical conventions, grammatical  
and lexical preverbs are separated from the rest 
of the verb construction by spaces, (though this 
is not followed consistently for lexical preverbs, 
sometimes written attached to the stem). 
Personal prefixes (in the case of independent 
order forms) are attached onto the first preverb or 
the verb stem, as can be seen in (1a) and (3a-b). 
Moreover, long vowels may be indicated with a 
circumflex, such as <â>, used throughout the 
examples in this paper, or by doubling the vowel 
graphemes, i.e. <â> could alternatively be 
written as <aa>. The double-vowel notation is 
used for long-vowels in the computational model 
to be discussed below. 

Morphophonology: While Northern 
East Cree (NEC) is fairly regularly agglutinative 
in its structure, there are some morpho-
phonological phenomena occurring at the stem-
suffix juncture, at the prefix-preverb/verb stem 
initial morpheme juncture, as well as within the 
suffix complex. For instance, a template 
morphology approach such as Collette (2014) 
presents 10 different suffix positions for the NEC 
verb. Furthermore, in the case of conjunct verb 
forms, the first syllable of the verbal complex, 
whether that of the first preverb or the stem, can 
undergo ablaut, known as Initial Change (IC), 
and resulting in a changed conjunct form. For 
example, the vowel -â- of the first syllable of the 
verb mâtû below (2a-c) changes to -iyâ- in the 
conjunct neutral form used in partial questions. 
Initial change of the verb stem only happens 
when there is no preverb before the verb stem, as 
preverbs can undergo initial change as well (cf. 
Junker, Salt & MacKenzie, 2015a). 

 

(2a) mâtu-u 
 cry.AI-3(INDEPENDENT) 

 ‘S/he is crying’ 
 

(2b)  âh mâtu-t 
when cry.AI-3(CONJUNCT) 

 ‘When s/he is crying’ 
 

(2c)  awân miyâtu-t 
who IC.cry-3(CONJUNCT) 
‘Who is crying?’ 

 

To account for stem-suffix juncture morpho-
phonological phenomena, Junker, Salt and 
MacKenzie (2015b) identify up to 19 stem 
types1. For example, t-/sh-stems alternate 
depending on person marking  (3a-b), and h-
stems trigger vowel i- lengthening (4).  
 

(3a) t/sh-stem: nâtâu 
chinâshin 
chi-nâsh-in 
2-come.to.TA- DIR.2SG(SUBJ)→1SG(OBJ) 
‘you [sg.] come to me’ 
 

(3b) t/sh-stem: nâtâu  
chinâtitin 
chi-nât-itin 
2-come.to.TA-INV.1SG(SUBJ)→2SG(OBJ) 
‘I come to you [sg.]’ 

 

(4) h-stem: sâchihâu 
chisâchihîtin 
chi-sâchih-îtin 
2-love.TA- INV.1SG(SUBJ)→2SG(OBJ) 
‘I love you [sg.]’ 

 

All the inflectional information above is encoded 
into two databases, (1) a verb paradigm database 
and (2) a dictionary database. The verb paradigm 
database, consisting of 9,457 entries, lists 
exhaustive paradigms for each inflectional 
subtype (19 in all), plus some partial paradigms 
as well. That is, all basic prefix and suffix 
sequence combinations, indicating the person 
and number of subject (for all verb classes) and 
object (for TA verbs) as well as the various 
possible types of modality, are identified for each 
inflectional paradigm subtype and verb class (II, 
AI, TI, TA). Each entry in the verb paradigm 
database is a fully inflected verb form, which is 
associated with the relevant set of morphological 
features (Table 1). Importantly, each entry is 
provided with several different orthographical 
representations and structural partitions for 
different usage purposes. In particular, in a field 
named ‘Search engine chunks’, not only are all 
the suffixes lumped together, but this word-final 
segment/chunk, which we can call the technical 
suffix, also includes the stem final vowel or 
consonant (h- here), leaving behind what we call

for II verbs, 6 for AI verbs, 1 for AI+O-verbs, and 2 
for TI verbs.

The dictionary database (15,614 entries) (Junker 
et al. 2012) determines the inflectional subtype 
for each verb. This allows for linking each verb 
with its entire paradigm according to a model 
verb for each inflectional subtype, as enumerated 
in the verb paradigm database. In addition, the 
aforementioned technical stem, in both its 
regular and changed (conjunct) form, is 
explicitly stored directly for each verb in the 
dictionary database. Using these technical stems 
and the corresponding word-final (and word-
initial) technical suffix chunks from the verb 
paradigm database, one can generate all the 
inflected forms by simple concatenation, without 
needing any morphophonological rules. 
Nevertheless, one needs to bear in mind that 
these technical stems and word-final technical 
suffix chunks have no morphological reality, but 
are simply representations of convenience (see 
Junker & Stewart, 2008). Furthermore, all 

grammatical and lexical preverbs are also 
included as their own entries in the dictionary 
database, and we are treating initial-changed 
forms of preverbs as separate entries labelled as 
conjunct preverbs. 

4 Computational modeling of the 
Northern East Cree verb 

As our computational modeling technology, we 
are using Finite-State Transducers (FST) (e.g. 
Beesley & Karttunen 2003), well-known 
computational data structures that are optimized 
for word form analysis and generation, with a 
calculus for powerful manipulations. FSTs are 
easily portable to different operating systems and 
platforms, and thus can be packaged and 
integrated with other software applications, like 
providing a spell-checking functionality within a 
word-processor. In designing a finite-state 
computational model, with a fairly regularly 
agglutinative language such as East Cree, one 
has to decide whether one models 
morphophonological alternations at stem+affix 
junctures by (1) dividing stems into subtypes 
which are each associated with their own 
inflectional affix sets that can simply be glued 
onto the stem, or whether (2) one models such 
morphophonological alternations using context-
based rewrite rules. Furthermore, one has to 
decide the extent to which one treats affix 
sequences by splitting these into their constituent 
morphemes, each associated with one 
morphosyntactic feature, or rather treats affixes 
as chunks which are associated with multiple 
morphosyntactic features (Arppe et al., in press). 
The more one splits affix sequences, the more 
one may need to develop and test rules for 
dealing with morphophonological alternations at 
these morpheme junctures, whereas in the case of 
chunking such alternations are precomposed 
within the chunk. In contrast, the more one uses 
chunks, the more one has to enumerate chunks 
based on the number of relevant inflectional 
subtypes. 

While the chunking strategy is not 
parsimonious and compact, in our experience it 
results in FST source code which is nevertheless 
structurally quite flat and easily comprehensible 
for scholars who are not specialists for the 
language in question. Importantly, current finite-
state compilers, e.g. XFST, HFST, or FOMA 
(Beesley and Karttunen 2003; Lindén et al. 2011; 
Hulden 2009), implement a minimization 
procedure on the finite-state model, so that 

54



 

recurring realizations of string-final character 
sequences and associated morphological features 
are systematically identified and merged, 
resulting in the end in a relatively compact model 
(that in practice might not be much larger, nor 
structurally substantially different, than a model 
compiled from source code implementing 
maximal splitting). On the other hand, if some 
aspect of the chunked morpheme sequences 
needs to be changed, with the chunking strategy 
these have to be implemented in potentially quite 
a large number of locations. 

For the Northern East Cree model, we 
decided to (1) split the pre-stem morphemes 
(personal prefixes for the independent order 
forms, and the regular and initial-changed forms 
of the grammatical and lexical preverbs), as there 
are very few morphophonological phenomena 
(initial change, epenthesis), and these are very 
regular. We deal with initial change by 
exhaustively listing the two alternative preverbs 
or stems (regular vs. changed); (2) entirely chunk 
the post-stem suffix morphemes, associating the 
chunks with multiple morphological feature tags; 
and (3) make maximal use of inflectional 
subtypes through using the aforementioned 
technical stems and post-stem word-final 
technical suffix chunks. Thus we will require no 
morphophonological rules for the stem-suffix 
morpheme juncture, and only two regular 
morphophonological rules in the pre-stem part.2 
These morphophonological rules are 
implemented using the TWOLC formalism 
within the FST framework. As to the rest, the 
LEXC formalism in the FST framework is used 
to define the concatenation of the morpheme 
sequences as treated above. For Independent 
order forms with subject (and object) person and 
number marked with a combination of a prefix 
and suffix (which can be understood to constitute 
a circumfix), agreement constraints between 
these affixes are implemented with the flag 
diacritic notation within the LEXC formalism. 

5 Model statistics and details 

The computational model currently includes 
stems and suffixes for AI, TI, and TA, but not for 
II verbs (which have the simplest paradigms). 
The LEXC source code for verb affixal 
morphology in its current form consists of 
16,590 lines, of which 68 concern the pre-stem 
 
2  (i) insertion of an epenthetic -t- between the 
personal prefix and a vowel-initial stem or preverb; 
and (ii) assimilation of i- before a stem-initial u-. 

component and 16,514 the post-stem technical 
suffix chunks.3 With minimization, its 
compilation with XFST takes 5.462 seconds with 
a 2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8MB of 
RAM, resulting in a 108 kB XFST model 
(1,084kB with HFST).4 
 

While this full enumeration of suffix 
chunks per each inflectional paradigm type 
results in a large number lines in the LEXC code, 
in comparison to a decompositional approach, 
the structure of the source code is quite flat and 
easy to grasp. As can be seen in Table 3 
presenting the source code for the Independent 
Neutral Indicative suffix chunks for Animate 
Intransitive verbs of the -aa paradigm type, the 
suffix chunk -aan, which requires a first person 
prefix ni- to have been observed at the very 
beginning of the verb construction, indicated by 
the flag-diacritic @U.person.NI@, is associated 
with three morphological tags +Indic, +Neu 
and +1Sg, corresponding to the morphological 
features INDICATIVE, NEUTRAL and FIRST 
PERSON SINGULAR actor, respectively. In 
addition, the numeric code +[01] is provided, 
indicating the paradigm subset for Regular (Non-
Relational) Independent Neutral Indicative verb 
forms.

This almost entirely concatenative modeling 
strategy described above is made possible thanks 
to the exhaustive listing of the technical stems 
(both regular and changed) for each verb in the 
dictionary database, and the likewise 
comprehensive enumeration of all inflected 
forms for each subtype in the verb paradigm 
database, with one of the representations of each 
inflected form providing a partitioning into the 
technical stem and a technical suffix chunk. All 
the forms in the verb paradigm database have 
been verified in countless sessions with fluent 
East Cree Elders over decades. 

Importantly, though the creation of the 
two databases has taken a substantial amount of 
meticulous human work and scrutiny, and while 
FST source code for the (relatively straight-
forward) pre-stem component has been written 
by hand, the FST source code for the suffix 
component is generated in its entirety from the 
underlying two lexical databases, minimizing the 
risk for human typing error (when the underlying 
databases are error-free). Equally importantly, 
the automatic generation allows for easy 
generation of revised versions, if changes need to 
be implemented. 

In terms of time required to create this 
this general FST architecture, the manual coding 
of the basic pre-stem morphology, and 
developing the scripts for automatically 
generating the post-stem FST source code has 
taken altogether 2 weeks of 3 people’s work. 

6 Conclusion 

Having comprehensive, well-structured resources 
such as those described above, and people with 
appropriate programming and linguistic skills, 
the brute-force listing strategy presented in this 
paper is a surprisingly fast and efficient way of 
creating a finite-state computational model, to 
form a basis for subsequent development of 
practical end-user applications.
