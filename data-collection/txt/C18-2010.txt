Abstract

For controversial topics, collecting argumentation-containing tweets which tend to be more con-
vincing will help researchers analyze public opinions. Meanwhile, claim is the heart of argumen-
tation. Hence, we present the first real-time claim retrieval system CRST that retrieves tweets
containing claims for a given topic from Twitter. We propose a claim-oriented ranking module
which can be divided into the offline topic-independent learning to rank model and the online
topic-dependent lexicon model. Our system outperforms previous claim retrieval system and ar-
gument mining system. Moreover, the claim-oriented ranking module can be easily adapted to
new topics without any manual process or external information, guaranteeing the practicability
of our system.

1 Introduction

When users search controversial topics in Twitter, they often tend to find some persuasive tweets. Ar-
gumentation is known as the most convincing structure, which usually consists of claim and evidence
(Toulmin, 1958; Palau and Moens, 2009). However, only when the claim confirmed, can the evidence
make sense. To help users swiftly obtain many pre-eminent claims about the query topic from Twitter,
we propose CRST, a system that can automatically retrieve claim-oriented tweets.

Given a topic, our task aims to retrieve a list of claim-oriented tweets. We assume a claim-oriented
tweet should meet three criteria: (1) the tweet should be topic-related; (2) the tweet clearly supports
or opposes the topic; (3) the tweet provides an arguable reason for its stance. For example, “@mmfa
Abortion is not a choice, abortion is the killing of an innocent life.@owillis” is a tweet related to the topic
of “abortion”. Moreover, it strongly opposes abortion and contains an arguable reason, “abortion is
the killing of an innocent life”. Therefore, it is a claim-oriented tweet.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of claim retrieval in Twitter. Most existing works
on argument mining in Twitter concentrate on detecting the evidence types (Dusmanu et al., 2017). And
the claim retrieval task on documents was first introduced by Roitman et al. (2016). However, due to
the short tweet content and specific conventions in Twitter as well as the ambiguous claims made by
tweeters, our task is harder than claim retrieval in documents.

CRST integrates search and re-ranking modules to (i) find topic-related tweets, and (ii) rank by the
degrees of containing claim. The core NLP part of our system is the claim-oriented ranking module (see
Section 2.2 for detail). It can be divided into the offline topic-independent learning to rank model and
the online topic-dependent lexicon model. Considering (1) some conventions in Twitter structure tweets
and this structuring can be a valuable hint for searching claim-oriented tweets; (2) some claims may be
expressed in a general pattern; we use a learning-to-rank framework to integrate Twitter structure infor-
mation and some general claim pattern features to build an offline topic-independent ranking model. In
addition, claims can not exist without topic, so we introduce the topic information to our claim-oriented
ranking module. To be more specific, we generate a topic-dependent claim-oriented lexicon online to

further elevate the retrieval performance. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other
systems on similar tasks.

2 Claim Retrieval System

2.1 System Overview

An overview of our system is shown in Figure 1. We first perform offline steps to process data and to
train the topic-independent model (Subfigure a). The online system is illustrated in Subfigure b. In the
remainder of this section, we briefly discuss these steps.

Offline Processing In order to build the system, we crawl and index about 60 million English tweets
using the Twitter API in 2016. Using these tweets we implement a search engine based on ElasticSearch.
Given a query topic, the search engine would present a list of relevant tweets ranked based on the BM25
score. We construct a annotated dataset by searching some selected topics on the search engine (see
Section 4.1 for detail). Then, we train a learning-to-rank framework which integrates different kinds of
topic-independent features as a topic-independent model.

Online Processing When a user gives a new query topic q, the system performs the following three
steps on the fly: (i) Retrieving related tweets with a real time Twitter search API, where Tweepy1 is
invoked to retrieve the top-n tweets that are most related to q; (ii) Ranking the tweets, where we automat-
ically construct topic-dependent claim-oriented lexicons online and combine it with the offline trained
topic-independent module as our Claim-oriented Ranking Module (elaborate in Section 2.2). (iii) Vi-
sualizing the results, where the visualization module presents the re-ranked tweets to the user within an
interactive graphical interface.

2.2 Claim-oriented Ranking Module

By and large, our retrieval model is a learning-to-rank framework which integrates topic-independent
features. Additionally, we use topic-dependent claim-oriented lexicons to further elevate the retrieval
performance. Given a query topic q, a list of related tweets T from the Twitter dataset D is calcu-
lated as T = Relevant(D, q)2. The final claim-oriented score function of a tweet t is defined as
FinalScore(t, q) = LTR(T, t) + λScoreLex(t, Lexq), where LTR(T, t) is a pairwise learning to
rank method3 and ScoreLex(t, Lexq) is a function4 using a claim-oriented lexicon Lexq to construct
an claim-oriented score for each tweet t. λ is a hyper parameter obtained through training. And we will
elaborate them in the following part.

Topic-independent Module We use learning to rank framework to build our topic-independent model.
Learning to rank is a data driven approach that effectively incorporates a bag of features into the retrieval

1http://www.tweepy.org/
2We used Okapi BM25 as a the Relevant function.
3We use rankSVM (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm\_light/svm\_rank.html) to train

our ranking model.
4We estimate the claim-oriented score of each tweet by calculating the average claim-oriented score over certain terms.

process. We use a linear kernel rankSVM for training and report results for the best setting of parameters.
There are three kinds of topic-independent features that we used. (i) Twitter structural features refer to
conventions that are only used in Twitter, such as “#”, “@”, “RT @”, URL and combinations of these
conventions. Meanwhile, we also consider whether a tweet is a reply as a feature. (ii) Author social
features contain followers, friends and status information, which also play an important role in social
media mining work (Luo et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2015). (iii) GenLex is a topic-independent claim-
oriented lexicon. We compute the information gain score of each word in tweets which contained in a
labeled dataset. Then we choose the top-N scored words to construct GenLex. These words, such as
“because”, “but”, “will”, are topic-independent words and can reveal general patterns of claim-oriented
tweets.

Topic-dependent Claim-oriented Lexicon Since it is impossible to train a supervised model for every
topic, we adopt the ScoreLex(t, Lexq) (mentioned above) by considering it as a topic-dependent prob-
lem. The topic-dependent claim-oriented lexiconLexq is constructed byMakeLex(GenLex, T ), where
we measure topic-dependent claim-oriented score of each word w in T , by calculating the co-occurrence
frequency of w with words in GenLex. Finally, the high scored words will be used to construct a claim-
oriented lexicon that refers to query topic q. For example, about topic “abortion”, the words in Lexq are
“kill”, “murder”, “dangerous”, etc.

2.3 System Usage

Our system is shown in Figure 2. The interface of our system is implemented using PyQt5. After
inputting the query topic q, users can choose to use a claim-oriented score order or time sort. In the
former model, our system automatically highlights the words in GenLex to blue, and the words in Lexq
to yellow. This can be seen as a basis for tweets to be considered as containing claims. Additionally, our
system allow users viewing details by clicking the tweet.

3 Experimental Result and Case Study

3.1 Evaluation

To evaluate our claim retrieval model, we construct a English Twitter dataset which consists of 2520
tweets from 30 controversial topics5. And 586 tweets are identified as containing claims. We use 10-fold
cross validation for evaluation, and use MAP as metric.

We use WikiClaim and TwitArgument as baselines. We adopt the features which are used
for retrieving claims in wikipedia documents in Roitman et al. (2016), and name it WikiClaim.

Table 1: Results of Baselines and our best

lines (for p < 0.01).

We also adopt the features which are used for
argument identification tasks in Twitter in Theo-
dosis Goudas and Karkaletsis (2015), and name it
TwitArgument. Considering topic related factor, we
combine BM25 with them. As shown in Table 1, our
best model (Best) which use both learning to rank
framework to integrate topic-independent features and
topic-dependent claim-oriented lexicon outperforms
the baselines significantly.

3.2 Case Study

In this section, we demonstrate a scenario of retrieving a query to prove the effectiveness of our system.
Table 2 shows the top 10 retrieval results returned by our system when searching for “abortion”.

As shown in Table 2, we can figure out that the tweets containing claims are in the top rank such as 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10. From these tweet, we can find that many claim-oriented tweets contains a re-tweet
feature “RT @”, it is very possible because of the high forward frequency of valuable claim. As for
the “reply” features appear many times, it may be because the argumentation always occurs during the
discuss or quarrel. At the same time, some structural features like URL which is often contained in news
or an advertisement rarely appear. In addition, these claim-oriented tweets contain words, like “kill”,
“life”, “murder”, which show our model can capture the topic-dependent claim-oriented information.

4 Conclusion

We present the first system that supports users to retrieve claim-containing tweets about controversial
topics in Twitter. We train a rankSVM for our learning-to-rank framework and the topic-dependent
lexicon is constructed using unlabeled topic-related tweets. Hence, our model can be easily adapted to
new emerging topics in Twitter. In addition, our system let the user intuitively obtain the claims, which
is certainly helpful in the development of public opinion research. The experimental results show that
our system outperforms the previous state-of-art document claim retrieval system and Twitter argument
mining system.
