Abstract 

WordNet is a large lexical resource express-
ing distinct concepts in a language. Synset is 
a basic building block of the WordNet. In this 
paper, we introduce a web based lexicogra-
pher's interface ‘Synskarta’ which is devel-
oped to create synsets from source language 
to target language with special reference to 
Sanskrit WordNet. We focus on introduction 
and implementation of Synskarta and how it 
can help to overcome the limitations of the 
existing system. Further, we highlight the fea-
tures, advantages, limitations and user evalua-
tions of the same. Finally, we mention the 
scope and enhancements to the Synskarta and 
its usefulness in the entire IndoWordNet 
community. 

1 Introduction 

WordNet is a lexical resource composed of synsets 
and semantic relations. Synsets are sets of 
synonyms. They are linked by semantic relations 
like hypernymy (is-a), meronymy (part-of), 
troponymy, etc. IndoWordNet1 is a linked structure 
of WordNets of major Indian languages from Indo-
Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan families 
(Bhattacharyya, 2010). WordNets are constructed 
by following the merge approach or the expansion 
approach (Vossen, 1998). IndoWordNet is 
constructed using expansion approach wherein 
Hindi is used as the source language; however, the 
Hindi WordNet2 is constructed using merge 
approach (Narayan et al., 2002).

In this paper, we have taken reference of San-
skrit WordNet3. Sanskrit is an Indo-Aryan lan-
guage and is one of the ancient languages. It has 
vast literature and a rich tradition of creating 
léxica. The roots of all languages in the Indo Euro-
pean family in India can be traced to Sanskrit 
(Kulkarni et al., 2010). Sanskrit WordNet is con-
structed using expansion approach where Hindi 
WordNet is used as a source (Kulkarni et al., 
2010). 

While developing Sanskrit WordNet, lexicogra-
phers create Sanskrit synsets by referring to Hindi 
synsets and by following the three principles of 
synset creation (Bhattacharyya, 2010). Since San-
skrit came into existence much before Hindi, it has 
many words which are not present in Hindi 
WordNet. These words are frequently used in the 
Sanskrit texts; hence, there was a need to create 
new Sanskrit synsets. In this case, the lexicogra-
pher creates new Sanskrit synsets by referring to 
electronic lexical resources such as Monier-
Williams Dictionary, Apte's Dictionary, Spoken 
Sanskrit Dictionary, etc. and linguistic resources 
such as Shabdakalpadruma and Vaacaspatyam, 
etc. (Kulkarni et al., 2010).  

The IndoWordNet community uses the IL-
Multidict tool to create synsets. This tool is de-
signed and developed by researchers at IIT Bom-
bay (Bhattacharyya, 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2010). 
Though this existing lexicographer's interface is 
popular and widely used, it has major limitations. 
Some of them are – it uses flat files, has chances of 
data redundancy, inconsistency, etc. To overcome 
these limitations, we developed a new web based 
synset creation tool – ‘Synskarta’. The features, 
advantages, limitations and user evaluations of 
Synskarta are detailed in this paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 describes the existing system – its ad-
vantages and disadvantages, section 3 describes 
Synskarta – its features, advantages, limitations 
and the user evaluations.  Subsequently, the con-
clusion, scope and enhancements to the tool are 
presented. 

2 Existing System  

2.1 IL Multidic Development Tool 

IL Multidict (Indian Language Multidict 
development tool) or the Offline Synset Creation 
tool is developed using Java and works with flat 
files. This tool, popularly known as the 
'Lexicographer's Interface' is an offline tool which 
helps in creating synsets using the expansion 
approach.  

The interface is vertically divided into the 
source language panel and the target language 
panel. At any given time, only the current source 
synset is displayed in the source language panel 
and its corresponding target synset is displayed in 
the target language panel. The source panel 
displays the details of the current synset of the 
source language such as number of records in 
source file, current synset id, its part-of-speech 
(POS) category, gloss or the concept definition, 
example(s) and synonym(s).  

Similarly, the target panel displays the target 
synset details such as total number of synsets in the 
target file, number of complete synsets, number of 
incomplete synsets and the current synset id 
(which is the same as source synset id). These 
fields are non-editable. There are also editable 
fields which allow editing of target synset details 
such as gloss, example(s) and synonym(s). The 
lexicographer translates the source language synset 
into the target language synset, while the validator 
uses same tool to validate these translated synsets.  

There is a navigation panel which allows a lexi-
cographer to navigate between synsets. The button 
‘Save & Next’ saves the current synset and moves 
to the next synset. The source and target synset 
data is extracted from source and target synset files 
respectively. These files are in Dictionary Standard 
Format (DSF) with extension '.syns'. Some of the 
features of the existing system are: search by 

synset id, search by word, generate synset count, 
generate word count, reference to quotations, 
commenting on a current synset and linkage to the 
corresponding English synset, etc.  

2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Ex-
isting System 

Some of the major advantages of the existing tool 
are: Firstly, it is a standalone tool. Hence it can be 
installed easily. Secondly, it is portable, i.e. the 
tool can be installed and used over different operat-
ing systems.  

Though the existing Lexicographer’s Interface 
has its own advantages and it is widely accepted by 
the IndoWordNet community, we can find several 
limitations with the system. Some of them are 
mentioned below: 
• Tool works with flat files hence there is a high 

possibility of data redundancy, data 
inconsistency, etc.  

• As the number of synsets increases, the 
processing time to perform various operations 
like searching, counting, synchronization, etc. 
increases.  

• Being a standalone tool, the installation and 
configuration time increases with increase in 
number of machines. 

• Merging data from different systems may lead 
to data loss, data redundancy as well as data 
inconsistency.  

• Synset data is not rendered properly in the 
interface if there is any formatting mistake in 
the source or target file. Also, if any special 
character is added in a file then the synsets are 
not loaded in the system. 

3 Developed System  

3.1 Synskarta 

The developed system, ‘Synskarta’ is an online 
interface for creating synsets by following the ex-
pansion approach. This web based tool is devel-
oped using PHP and MySQL which uses relational 
database management system to store and maintain 
the synset and related data. The IndoWordNet da-
tabase structure (Prabhu et al., 2012) is used for 
storing and maintaining the synset data while 

96



 

IndoWordNet APIs (Prabhugaonkar et al., 2012) 
are used for accessing and manipulating this data.  

Synskarta overcomes the limitations of the 
standalone offline tool. The look and feel of the 
interface is kept similar to that of the existing sys-
tem for ease of user adaptability. Most of the basic 
features of the existing system are incorporated in 
this developed system. Figure 1 shows the Lexi-
cographer’s Interface of the developed system. 

3.2 Features of Synskarta  

3.2.1 Features of Synskarta incorporated 
from the Existing System  

The features of the existing system which are im-
plemented with some improvements in Synskarta 
are as follows – 
• User Registration Module - This module 

allows the system administrator to create user 
profiles and provide necessary access 
privileges to user. The user can login using the 
access privileges provided to him and 
accordingly the user interface is displayed to 
that particular user.  

• Configuration Module – This module sets all 
the necessary parameters such as source 
language, target language and enables or 
disables certain features such as Source, 
Domain, Linking, Comment, References, etc. 

• Main Module – This module allows the user to 
enter data in the target language panel by 
referring to data in the source language panel. 
The source panel and the target panel vertically 
divide the main module into two equal sized 
panels. Following are the major components of 
this module:  
• Source language panel – This panel is 

placed on the left of the screen which has 
fields for synset id, POS category, gloss, 
example(s) and synonyms of the source 
language synset.  

• Target language panel – This panel is 
placed on the right of the screen. This 
panel has non-editable fields such as 
synset id, POS category and editable fields 
such as gloss, example(s) and synonym(s) 
of the target language synset. The user is 
expected to enter the data in these editable 

fields. 
• Search – User can search a synset either by 

entering 'synset id' or a 'word' in a synset.  
• Advanced Search – Here user is allowed to 

search synset data by entering various 
parameters such as POS category, words 
appearing in gloss or in example, etc.  

• Comment – User can comment on a 
particular synset being translated.  

• English Synset – User can check the 
corresponding English synset for better 
clarity in translation process.  

• Navigation Panel – This panel allows the 
user to navigate between synsets. Button 
‘Save & Next’ allows inserting or updating 
a current target synset and the data is 
directly stored in the IndoWordNet 
database. 

3.2.2 Features of Synskarta specific to San-
skrit Language 

Apart from the features of the existing system, 
there are features which are specific to the Sanskrit 
language. Some of these features can also be appli-
cable to other languages.  
    As far as Sanskrit is concerned, some of the fea-
tures can be specific to a particular word in the 
synset. These are given in table 1. To capture these 
word specific features, the ‘Word Options’ button 
is provided. This window has various features 
which users can set or unset for a selected word. 

Figure 1. The Developed System – Synskarta

 Table 1. Special Features of Synskarta specific 
to Sanskrit 

3.2.2.1 Noun Specific Features  

Noun specific features are displayed only if the 
POS category of the synset is NOUN. Figure 2 
shows a screenshot of the ‘Word Options’ window 
for noun synsets. Following are some of the noun 
specific features of a word in Sanskrit language – 
• Indication of Word Type (श�द �कार, śabda 

prakāra) – In Sanskrit, words can have वै
दक 
(vaidika) or लौकक (laukika) word types.  

• Indication of Accent (�वर, swara) – In San-
skrit, if a word has vaidika word type then it 
can have accents such as उदा�त (udaatta), 
अनुदा�त (anudaatta) or �व�रत (svarita). Again, 
udaata has sub-accents such as आ�युदा�त 
(aadyudaatta), म�योदा�त (madhyodātta) or 
अ�तोदा�त (antodaatta). It is needed particular-
ly in Sanskrit because the meaning of a word 
changes according to the place of accent.  

• Identification of Gender (�ल�ग, liṅga) – In 
Sanskrit, a gender can be masculine (पंुि!ल�ग, 
puṃlliṅga), feminine (�"ी�ल�ग, strīliṅga) or 
neutral (नपंुसक�ल�ग, napuṃsakaliṅga). For ex-
ample, a word तट (taṭa) has two genders, mas-

culine for तटः (taṭaḥ) and neuter for तटम ्
(taṭam). Hence, there is a need to store gender 
information for such type of words.  

• Indication of Preverbs (उपसग', upasarga) – In 
Sanskrit, there are 22 preverbs. Some of them 
are � (pra), परा (parā), अप (apa), etc. (Papke, 
2005; Ajotikar et al. 2012). For example, for a 
word ग�ध (gandha), if we add preverbs सु (su), 
दसु ् (dus) and उप (upa) we get words सुग�ध 
(sugandha), दगु'�ध (durgandha) and उपग�ध 
(upagandha) respectively.  

• Indication of Class (गण, gaṇa) – Certain words 
in Sanskrit language belong to प�रग)णत 
(parigaṇita) or आकृ,त (ākṛti) class type. Each 
of this class type has class names. For exam-
ple, a word �शव (śiva) belongs to parigaṇita 
class type having class name �शवा
द (śivādi) 
and a word शौ-ड (śauṇḍa) belongs to ākṛti 
class type having class name शौ-डा
द 
(śauṇḍādi). 

• Expectancy (/प, rūpa) – Certain words expect 
its related word to be in specific case(s). For 
example, a word अलम ् (alam, ‘enough’) ex-
pects its related word to be in ततृीया (tṛtīyā, 
‘instrumental case’) as अलं रोदनेन। (alaṁ 
rōdanēna, ‘enough of crying’).  

• Etymology (0यु�पि�त, vyutpatti) – Most of the 
words in Sanskrit have etymology. For exam-

Feature Details 
Word

utterance of any particular syllable.  

Class There are 10 classes of verbs in 
Sanskrit. They are bhvādi, adādi, 
juhotyādi, divādi, svādi, tudādi, 
rudhādi, tanādi, kryādi and curādi.  

Etymol
ogy 

It is the study of the origin of a word 
and historical development of its 
meaning. 

Pada There are padas for suffixes of a verb 
such as parasmaipada, ātmanepada 
or ubhayapada. 

Ittva Verb can be aniṭ, seṭ or veṭ.

ple, a word कूल�कषः (kūlaṅkaṣaḥ, ‘the sea’), 
कूलं कष,त इ,त। (kūlaṁ kaṣati iti, ‘one who cuts 
the shore’).  

3.2.2.2 Verb Specific Features  

Verb specific feature list is displayed only if the 
POS category of the synset is VERB. Figure 3 
shows the ‘Word Options’ window for verb 
synsets. Following are some of the verb specific fea-
tures of a word in Sanskrit language –  

• Indication of Word Type (श�द �कार, śabda 
prakāra) – Verbs can have वै
दक (vaidika) or 
लौकक (laukika) word types.  

• Indication of Accent (�वर, swara). 
• Indication of Transitivity (कम'क�व, karmakatva) 

– A verb can be सकम'क (sakarmaka, ‘active’) 
or अकम'क (akarmaka, ‘passive’).  

• Indication of Iṭtva (इ6�व, iṭtva) - A verb can be 
अ,न6 (aniṭ), से6 (seṭ) or वे6 (veṭ). 

• Indication of Class (गण, gaṇa) – In Sanskrit, 
there are 10 classes of verbs. Some of them are 
8वा
द (bhvādi), अदा
द (adādi), जुहो�या
द 
(juhotyādi), etc. 

• Indication of Pada (पद, pada) – In Sanskrit, 
there are padas for suffixes of a verb such as 
पर�मैपद (parasmaipada), आ�मनेपद 
(ātmanepada) or उभयपद (ubhayapada). 

• Indication of Preverbs (उपसग', upasarga,) – 
For verbs also there are 22 preverbs in San-
skrit. For example, when preverbs are attached 
to a root गम ्(gam, ‘to go’), we get verb forms 
such as आ√गम ् (ā√gam, ‘to come’), अनु√गम ्
(anu√gam, ‘to follow’), ,नर√्गम ् (nir√gam, ‘to 
go out’), <व√गम ्(vi√gam, ‘to go away’).  

• Indication of Verbal Root Types (धातु �कार, 
dhātu prakāra) – A verbal root can have types 
such as धातु (dhātu), सा=धतधातु (sādhitadhātu), 
वै
दकधातु (vaidikadhātu) and सौ"धातु 
(sautradhātu).  

• Expectancy (/प, rūpa) – Certain verbs expect 
its related word to be in specific case(s). For 
example, a root भी (bhī, ‘to fear’) expects its 

related word in प>चमी (pañcamī, ‘ablative 
case’) such as 0या@ात ् भीतः (vyāghrāt bhītaḥ, 
‘feared of tiger’).  

3.2.3 General Features not specific to any 
Language 

Some of the general features which are not specific 
to any particular language are also provided in 
Synskarta, they are as follows: 
• Vindication – This feature allows the user to 

record the special feature of a particular word 
in a current synset.  

• Source – This feature allows the user to record 
the information about source of the synset.  

• Domain – This feature allows the user to 
record the information about domain of the 
synset.  

• Linking – Many-to-Many linking of words is 
supported in this feature.  

• Quotations – The feature to add quotations as 
additional examples are supported.  

• Root Verb – This feature allows the user to 
enter the root verb of a given word. 

• Feedback – Feedback related to the tool and its 
features are captured here. 

3.3 Advantages and Limitations of Synskarta 

Major advantages of Synskarta are as follows: 
• Centralized system  
• No data redundancy and inconsistency.  

Figure 3. Word Options – Verb Specific Features 

99



 

• Online access from anywhere in the world  
• No text files to maintain data  
• Faster processing and updating  
• Multiple users can work at the same time  
• Can be used by all the language WordNets  

 
Synskarta has a few limitations. The major limi-

tation is that, it is heavily dependent on internet 
access or networking. Another limitation is that 
currently there are rendering issues depending on 
the device being used. 

3.4 User Evaluation 

The beta version of Synskarta was released to the 
Sanskrit WordNet creation team to capture users’ 
experiences and the feedback which are as follows: 
• Searching of synset from source as well as 

target language is faster.  
• User does not have to maintain files for source 

and target language. 
• Separate synchronization is not required. 

Everything is handled by the tool itself.  
• The system always shows the updated synsets. 
• User has to depend on the internet while using 

the system. 

4 Conclusion  

It has been observed that the existing system for 
synset creation activity is not up to the expecta-
tions of the user, as it uses text files for storage and 
processing. This may lead in creation of redundant 
synset data and hence, data maintenance becomes 
difficult. A web based tool ‘Synskarta’ is devel-
oped to overcome the limitations of the existing 
system. This is a centralized system which uses 
relational database to store and maintain data. The 
difficulty of maintaining data in flat files is taken 
care of. User feedback is found to be positive and 
this tool may prove essential for the IndoWordNet 
community. 

5 Future Scope and Enhancements  

In future, the tool can be expanded to link to the 
other Indian languages. This tool can have addi-
tional features such as capturing appropriate pro-
nunciation of the synset, features to capture video, 
images or documents related to the synset. Features 

such as automatic translation, transliteration, tran-
scription can also be implemented over the time. 
Further, there can be a feature to link 
IndoWordNet synsets to the foreign language 
WordNets. A feature to generate produced words 
can also be implemented. Link to FrameNet of 
Sanskrit verbs is an important work that will be 
undertaken in future. This will be useful in the 
light of development of dependency tree banks.
