Abstract

The automated comparison of points of view between two politicians is a very challenging task,
due not only to the lack of annotated resources, but also to the different dimensions participating
to the definition of agreement and disagreement. In order to shed light on this complex task, we
first carry out a pilot study to manually annotate the components involved in detecting agreement
and disagreement. Then, based on these findings, we implement different features to capture
them automatically via supervised classification. We do not focus on debates in dialogical form,
but we rather consider sets of documents, in which politicians may express their position with
respect to different topics in an implicit or explicit way, like during an electoral campaign. We
create and make available three different datasets.

1 Introduction

When it comes to evaluate whether the statements of two persons are in agreement or not about a topic,
several past works approach the problem by classifying the single statements as supporting or opposing
the topic, considering the task as a variant of sentiment analysis (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).

These approaches proved to be reliable in specific settings, where the goal of the statements was to
express support or opposition w.r.t. the topic. However, when applied to the political domain, they often
result into an oversimplified representation of the dynamics involved in the comparison of two positions.
In our view, several aspects contribute to the assessment of agreement and disagreement in the political
domain, requiring to be properly addressed. As an example, let us consider two excerpts uttered by
Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 about the situation in Cuba under the Castro regime:

Kennedy: “There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba, and I think it is unfortu-
nate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Castro to hold free, open
elections, so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice.”

Nixon: “What we must remember too is that the United States has the military power - and
Mr. Castro knows this - to throw him out of office tomorrow or the next day or any day that we
choose.”

The two examples show that neither Nixon nor Kennedy support the Castro regime and that they
both share the same negative sentiment about it in their speeches. But beside being on the same side
in contrasting the regime, their points of view on it are, from a pragmatic perspective, very different:
while Kennedy supports free elections, Nixon does not hesitate to remark United States military power
and the possibility to remove Castro in any moment. Overall, the two positions are in disagreement.
This example shows that the sentiment and the proposed solution are two relevant aspects to define a
politician’s attitude w.r.t. a topic, and that the contribution of these two aspects need to be better studied
when comparing different points of view: while one could argue that disagreement is expressed by

different sentiment and different semantic content, our pilot analysis shows that the boundaries are not
so clear-cut.

The main contribution of this work lies in the presentation of a first feasibility study on manually
annotated data from the political domain (Section 4), where we decompose the notion of agreement /
disagreement, and in the presentation of a novel system (Section 5), which takes into account the insight
gained during the feasibility study. We evaluate our approach on three datasets created for this task,
which we make freely available1, and show that our approach is effective on each of them: the one
created for the feasibility study presented in Section 4.1, an extended version of the same dataset, and a
larger one extracted from Debatepedia presented in Section 5.2.

2 Related Work

Given the highly polarized nature of political debates, we can find in the literature many works focused
on classifying political statements as supporting or opposing a debated topic. This classification can be
approached in different ways, for instance by emphasizing the role of sentiment polarity in a statement,
or using topic modeling to define each position.

In (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010) the authors propose a way to
classify stances. They gather posts on different topics from online forums, and classify the statements
from these debates as in favor or against the debated issue. They use the MPQA corpus to automatically
generate a lexicon of entries indicative of a positive and negative argument and add information about
the use of modal verbs and sentiment-based features. A similar task is proposed in Abbott et al. (2011)
to recognize disagreement in online political forums between quoted text and a given response. The goal
was achieved by using word-based features (for example discourse markers) as well as meta-information.
Another work investigating stance classification of online posts was presented in Anand et al. (2011):
there, the authors attempt to improve the unigram baseline by adding more cognitive-motivated features
such as contextual information and opinion dependencies to define the target of opinion words. The
results show that the use of these features improves classification results for many topics.

Another work from Gottipati et al. (2013) proposes to learn topics and support/opposition from dis-
cussions in Debatepedia by using a model based on the probabilistic distribution of the terms over the
topics and the sides of the debate. A similar work on Debatepedia has been proposed by Awadallah et al.
(2012), to classify quotes as belonging to a topic and supporting or opposing it.

Other approaches to classification rely on corpus-specific features, as in Thomas et al. (2006), who
detect support and opposition to legislation in congressional debates by using speech transcriptions as
well as records on voting, information about the speakers and the relations among them. Other works
focus on the identification of agreement and disagreement in dialogues, such as (Galley et al., 2004;
Hillard et al., 2003). They classify consecutive speech transcription segments produced by different
speakers as positive or negative with respect to the discussed topic by using lexical, structural, and
prosodic features.

Compared to previous works, our task is different in that we perform pairwise agreement/disagreement
detection between two points of view: our focus is on the relation between the two rather than the single
stance. Another difference lies in the types of textual units we want to classify: we do not work on single
statements but rather on longer snippets including several sentences, based on the assumption that in the
political domain a person’s position with respect to a topic may not be overtly expressed. Our goal is
to generalise over single statements and detect agreement and disagreement based on a broader, but not
necessarily explicit, textual context.

3 Task Description

In the political domain, public debates in which two opponents discuss their point of view on specific
topics, usually suggested by a moderator, are just one of several occasions in which political agendas
are described. If we consider an electoral campaign, for instance, candidates issue declarations, mostly
in the form of speeches, in which several topics are more or less explicitly discussed, and only towards

the end of the campaign a direct confrontation between opponents takes place. While past approaches
to detect direct support or opposition in dialogues (Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003) could be
appropriate to analyse such direct confrontations, they may fail to capture the complexity of other types
of statements. For example, the limited length of turns in dialogues, the presence of specific emphatic
expressions and the need to focus on one topic at a time all contribute to the automated detection of
agreement or disagreement in direct confrontations, but this information is not necessarily present when
we consider larger documents collections, containing the public declarations of a politician. This second
scenario is the focus of the present work. Specifically, given two document collections containing the
public declarations and speech transcriptions of two politicians, our goal is to assess whether the two
agree or not on a topic. In this scenario, we cannot assume that, each time a topic is mentioned, a
position is explicitly expressed, but rather that it can be understood given a set of statements related
to the topic. Besides, we cannot assume that two datasets representing two politicians contain direct
references or replies between the opponents on a given topic. In this complex scenario, we first define
a methodology to process the document collections and extract the text passages to be compared and
classified. Then, we propose an approach to classify such pairs based on supervised learning, that takes
into account features capturing the relevant dimensions analysed in the pilot study.

4 Pilot Study

To investigate which dimensions are involved in the perception of agreement and disagreement in the
political domain, we first perform an exploratory study by manually annotating a dataset created for the
task.

4.1 1960 Presidential Campaign Dataset

We collect the transcription of discourses and official declarations issued by Nixon and Kennedy during
1960 presidential campaign from The American Presidency Project2. The corpus includes 881 doc-
uments3 and more than 1,6 million tokens (around 830,000 tokens for Nixon and 815,000 tokens for
Kennedy).

We define 38 topics relevant to the electoral campaign with the help of a history scholar and we
represent them via a set of manually defined keywords (e.g. a topic about the Agricultural program
defined as [agricultural program, agricultural policy, farmer, farm], about Education [education, school]
or about Atomic energy [atomic energy, nuclear energy, atomic power, nuclear power]).

For each topic, for example Education, we extract from the two sets of documents all sentences con-
taining at least one of the keywords defining the topic, plus the previous and the following sentence. The
decision of extending the selection to three sentences is taken in order to have a more complete portion
of text about the topic. These three sentences correspond to a text excerpt.

For each topic, we finally pair five random excerpts from Kennedy with five random excerpts from
Nixon to create our snippets. We used this approach because the annotation task focused on general
questions that needed enough context to be answered, and single excerpts may not provide enough infor-
mation for the task.

4.2 Corpus Annotation

We build 350 snippets across all the topics and ask two independent annotators to annotate them using the
CrowdFlower web interface4. We did not open the task to the public, but we relied on trusted annotators.
For each pair, the following questions are asked:

1. Are Nixon’s and Kennedy’s statements about the topic in agreement, disagreement or neutral?

2. What is Kennedy’s sentiment with respect to the topic?

2463



3. What is Nixon’s sentiment with respect to the topic?

4. Are the solutions or initiatives proposed by Nixon and Kennedy similar or different?

For each pair, we collect i) a judgment about the agreement/disagreement relation between Nixon
and Kennedy on the topic (Question 1), ii) a judgment on Kennedy’s and Nixon’s sentiment w.r.t. the
topic (Question 2 and 3) being either Positive, Neutral or Negative and iii) a judgment on the solutions
proposed by the two candidates as similar, different or neutral, i.e. no solution proposed (Question 4).
The inter-annotator agreement as provided by Crowdflower is 73% for Question 1, 69% for Question 2,
70% for Question 3, and 78% for Question 4. Crowdflower re-assigns then each snippet for which there
is no agreement to one of the three categories based on a ‘confidence score’ (we could not obtain the
exact formula used to compute this value but we assume it takes into account annotators’ reliability).

4.3 Data Analysis

Based on the answers to Question 1, the dataset is composed by 203 pairs of snippets where Nixon
and Kennedy agree on the topic, 97 pairs in which they disagree and 50 pairs where they neither agree
nor disagree. We focus on the pairs in agreement or disagreement and further analyse the contribution
of sentiment and proposed solution to the perception of agreement. Results are reported in Table 1.
The analysis shows that being in agreement does not necessarily imply having the same sentiment or
suggesting the same solution (no solution is suggested in most of the cases). In cases of disagreement,
instead, a different sentiment and a different solution prevail.

Overall, if we cast the agreement / disagreement prediction on the basis of the sentiment, we can
correctly guess 221 pairs over 350 (63.1%). Similarly, if we cast the agreement / disagreement prediction
based on the fact that same or different solutions are proposed, we can correctly guess 173 pairs over
350 (49.4%). These values show that sharing the same sentiment, and proposing the same solution, per
se are not reliable indicators of agreement.

Same Sentiment Same Solution
Agreement Nixon-Kennedy (203 pairs) 134/203 (66.0%) 89/203 (43.8%)

Different Sentiment Different Solution
Disagreement Nixon-Kennedy (97 pairs) 87/97 (89.7%) 84/97 (86.5%)

Table 1: Correspondence between agreement/disagreement and similar/different sentiment or solution.

We further analyse the direct relation between the sentiment and the semantic content (i.e. solution
proposed) of the snippet pairs in the dataset with the help of Figure 1. The graph highlights that the pairs
in which the two politicians share the same sentiment (on the left side) are split in half between similar
and different solutions (on the right side). Instead, most of the pairs with a different sentiment (left side
of the graph) end to different solutions, but only half of the pairs with different solutions (right side of
the graph) derive from statements with a different sentiment.

tations from Question 4) in Nixon’s and Kennedy’s statements.

2464



The main findings of this pilot study can be summarised as follows: i) there is not a direct correspon-
dence between the fact that Nixon and Kennedy agree on a topic and the fact that they share the same
sentiment, ii) there is not a direct correspondence between the fact that Nixon and Kennedy agree on a
topic and the fact that they propose the same initiative or solution, and iii) the sentiment and semantic
content of the statements contribute both to defining agreement/disagreement between the two politi-
cians. This implies that automatically classifying agreement and disagreement in this scenario needs to
be addressed with appropriate features that can capture these different dimensions.

5 Experimental Setup

Based on the insight gained in the pilot study, we develop a system to automatically classify agreement
and disagreement between two politicians (see Question 1 in the annotation task) trying to integrate
information related to sentiment and semantic content of the statements (Questions 2-4). We classify
pairs of snippets, one for each politician. For the task we adopt a supervised machine learning approach
using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluate our
approach on the three datasets described in Section 5.2.

5.1 Features
We rely on three main categories of features. The contribution of speakers’ sentiment to their agree-
ment/disagreement is represented by a set of sentiment-based features (e.g. the sentiment of the state-
ments and sentiment of the topic). To capture the differences and similarities in the proposed solutions,
we use a set of semantic features (e.g word embeddings, cosine similarity and entailment), based on the
intuition that two texts proposing the same solution are more likely to be semantically similar than two
texts proposing different solutions. Finally, we add a set of surface features (e.g. the lexical overlap and
the use of negations) that we expect to bear some information on the relation between the two snippets.

Figure 2: Features Extraction Pipeline

Figure 2 shows the pipeline we implemented for feature extraction. After preprocessing, all the fea-
tures, except for word embeddings, are extracted at two different levels of granularity. In the first one, we
extract the features at snippet level, which provide more information about the context in which the topic
is used. In the second one, we focus only on the portion of text directly related to the topic. We use the
Stanford Parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) to extract from the sentences in the snippets all the subtrees
containing the keywords representing the topic, and then we extract the features from them. With this
pruning, we focus less on the context and more on the information which is directly related to the topic.

For each pair of snippets, we extract the following features:
Sentiment information: These features are inspired by previous works using sentiment information to

predict a speaker’s opinion on a topic (Pang and Lee, 2008; Abbasi et al., 2008). Each pair is represented
by four sentiment scores, two scores for each snippet in the pair. We rely on the sentiment analysis
module in the Stanford CoreNLP (Socher et al., 2013). We use a global sentiment score for each snippet
(obtained by the average of the sentiment score of each sentence in it), and a score for the sentiment in

2465



the subtrees related to the topic (obtained by the average of the sentiment score of each content word in
the subtrees).

Word embeddings: Past works showed that word embeddings are an effective tool to define ideolog-
ical positions in political documents (Iyyer et al., 2014). In our case, we do not focus on the sentence
level, but rather on the keywords defining the topics debated in our pairs. We treat each snippet separately
and we obtain two vectors for each pair: one vector representing the keywords of the topic in the first
snippet and one vector for the topic in the second snippet (e.g. a vector for Castro Regime in Kennedy
and a vector for Castro Regime in Nixon). The vectors are extracted using Word2vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) on each snippet (425 words on average with the topic occurring multiple times), with continuous
bag-of-word algorithm, a windows size of 8 and a vector dimensionality of 50. We use this feature as-
suming that, when two people agree (i.e. have a similar point of view) on a topic, their respective vectors
are more similar than when they are in disagreement.

Cosine similarity: In addition to the representation of the topics based on word embeddings, we use
a set of features to quantify the relatedness between the way the two speakers talk about the topic. From
each snippet in the pair, we extract two types of semantic vectors based on the co-occurrences (Turney
et al., 2010) of topic keywords: one is computed over the entire snippet, while the other considering
only the topic subtree. Co-occurrences are extracted from a window of 8 tokens and weighed using local
pointwise mutual information. We then compute the cosine similarity between the vectors of the two
sides of the snippet.

Entailment: The presence of entailment between the two snippets can be relevant to define if the
position expressed by a speaker is accepted by the other (Cabrio and Villata, 2012). For this feature, we
use the Excitement Open Platform (Magnini et al., 2014). For each pair, we use information about the
entailment between the two snippets (in both the directions) and between the text in the subtrees related
to the topic (in both the directions).

Lemma overlap: Past works showed that lexical overlap contributes to determining topical align-
ment between two texts (Somasundaran et al., 2009). Therefore, we compute lemma overlap of nouns,
verbs and adjectives between two snippets. Although lexical overlap is already integrated in the textual
entailment features, we believe that this information can provide useful information also in isolation.

Negation: For each snippet, we extract two features related to explicit negation cues (e.g. not, don’t,
never), adopting the list used in Councill et al. (2010). Using the parse tree of the snippets, we identify
the words under the scope of a negation, and then consider as features i) the number of negated words
in each snippet (normalized to its length) and ii) the percentage of the overlapping lemmas that in one
snippet are under a negation. We expect that, if the same words are negated in a snippet and not in the
other, this information can shed light on the relation between them.

5.2 Datasets

We evaluate our approach on three different datasets. The first is the 1960 Presidential Campaign dataset
presented in the pilot study (300 snippet pairs). Given the limited number of pairs in this dataset, we
create an extended version of it as follows: given a snippet pair related to a topic, we randomly replaced
in each snippet two of the five excerpts belonging to it with others from the same politician, on the
same topic, and with the same agreement/disagreement. By swapping random pairs of excerpts between
snippets, we generated new ones and we were also able to better balance the agreement/disagreement
proportion. Overall, the final dataset contains 1,400 pairs, balanced between the agreement/disagreement
classes.

We further wanted to measure the impact of our approach on a larger corpus, more suitable for machine
learning tasks. Therefore, we extract from Debatepedia5 pairs of snippets compliant with the structure
and the content of the two other datasets. We choose Debatepedia, an online encyclopedia of debates,
because it provides statements from two opposing sides debating on well-defined, controversial topics.
In particular, for each topic, Debatepedia gathers a set of relevant evidences and statements, mainly from
news, that are framed as being in favour or against a specific debate question, e.g. “Is the $700 billion

5http://www.debatepedia.org/

bailout for the 2008 US financial crisis a good idea?” (Figure 3). In this way we have a large amount of
snippets clustered into topics (e.g. individual rights, public safety, clean energy) and already structured
as in agreement or not.

Figure 3: The Debatepedia Structure: the list of statements supporting the topic are on the left side and
the list of statements opposing the topic on the right side. The solid arrows connect a pair in agreement,
while the dashed lines link pairs in disagreement.

We collect from Debatepedia 646 debates for a total of 17,055 unique statements. To simulate our task,
we need to organize the statements into pairs and associate each pair to a topic expressed by a keyword
appearing in both statements. The pairs were created as indicated in Figure 3, by coupling two snippets
being on the same side (for the agreement cases) or being on two opposite sides of the debate (for the
disagreement cases).

In order to identify a keyword shared between two paired snippets, we first select only the pairs sharing
at least one noun (74%). Then, we manually revised the 500 nouns most frequently overlapping, keeping
only those that are not too generic and are related to the given topic of the debate. This led to a final list
of 164 nouns, used as topics, for a total of 29,354 pairs. This final set of pairs, used in the classification
task, is still balanced, with 14,042 pairs marked as in agreement and 15,312 in disagreement.

6 Evaluation

We report in Table 2 the results obtained on the three datasets using SVM with radial kernel (10-fold cross
validation). A random baseline corresponding to the majority class is also reported. Beside evaluating
the classifier performance with all features, we also analysed the contribution of single features (i.e.
negation/overlap, entailment, sentiment, cosine, word embeddings) and their combinations to the task.
Finally, we perform another evaluation, adding to the features mentioned before the outcome of the
coreference resolution system in StanfordCoreNLP (Lee et al., 2011). Our intuition was that, since our
snippets usually include more than one sentence, resolving pronouns and coreferential expressions may
make the content more explicit, thus enabling a better agreement detection. However, results show that
this information causes a slight performance drop. This can be due to coreference resolution errors rather
than the feature itself, and we plan to further investigate this issue in the future.

Evaluation results confirm the findings suggested by the feasibility study: considering only sentiment-
based features, or those related to semantic content is not effective as combining the two information
layers (Sent+Entailment+Embeddings+Cosine). Surface features still have an impact on the outcome of
every run, although limited.

If we compare the results obtained on the three datasets, we observe that the limited size of the 1960
Elections dataset affects classification, because some configurations yield the same performance as the
random baseline. On the two other datasets, instead, the selected features are effective for classification,
with a better performance achieved on the Extended 1960 dataset. This is due to the fact that all snippets

Table 2: Classification results on the 1960 Elections dataset (300 pairs), Extended 1960 Elections dataset

are extracted from documents by Nixon and Kennedy, so that language and style are consistent across all
pairs. Debatepedia, instead, relies on a wide range of sources, thus language variation is much higher.

We finally run a last experiment to test our approach on a different task, i.e. the classification of
single statements as supporting or opposing a topic. We argue that, even if we chose our features with
a focus on pairwise comparison, some of them may be effective also for single snippets. We rely again
on Debatepedia, with the goal of classifying single arguments as supporting or opposing a topic. To this
purpose, we remove the features strictly related to the pairwise comparison (e.g. the lemma overlap or the
cosine similarity), and then classify each snippet belonging to one of the 29,354 pairs of our Debatepedia
dataset via 10-fold cross-validation. Using SVM, we yield an accuracy of 87.2%. This result shows that
the core set of features used to capture the point of view at snippet level are effective both to perform
comparisons and to detect support or opposition given a single statement and a topic. Gottipati et al.
(2013) perform the same task on Debatepedia data using a topic model-based approach, and achieve
86.0% accuracy. Although the two results are not directly comparable, since their dataset comprising
3,000 snippets is not available, we can conclude that our approach is a reliable solution also for single
argument classification and can generalise well over different tasks.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a study on the different dimensions which contribute to define agreement and
disagreement between points of view in the political domain. We presented a pilot study that highlights
how agreement w.r.t. a topic is derived both from the sentiment about it and the solution proposed. We
used then these two dimensions, complemented by other lexical features, to train a classifier that was
tested on data from the 1960 U.S Presidential Election and from Debatepedia. With this approach, we
were able to correctly classify agreement and disagreement with good accuracy.

In addition to SVM, we experimented also with Convolutional Neural Networks using the TensorFlow
implementation (Abadi et al., 2015), configured with 10 layers, 100 nodes and 100 iterations. So far,
the performance achieved with CNN is around 20% lower than with SVM on all datasets, therefore we
did not report the details in the experimental description. We plan to further investigate the motivations
behind this gap, and to continue experimenting with other TensorFlow configurations.

Another research direction that we plan to pursue is the role of neutral judgments when analysing
agreement and disagreement: we collected 50 neutral judgments during the pilot annotation, but we
discarded them because we wanted to focus on pairwise agreement or opposition. However, in a real
application scenario, it would be very important to add also this class. This extension is currently ongo-
ing. In the future, we also plan to include the module for agreement and disagreement detection in the
platform for the analysis of political speeches presented in Moretti et al. (2016).
