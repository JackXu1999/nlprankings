Abstract

The number of personal stories about sexual
harassment shared online has increased expo-
nentially in recent years. This is in part in-
spired by the #MeToo and #TimesUp move-
ments. Safecity is an online forum for peo-
ple who experienced or witnessed sexual ha-
rassment to share their personal experiences.
It has collected >10,000 stories so far. Sex-
ual harassment occurred in a variety of situ-
ations, and categorization of the stories and
extraction of their key elements will provide
great help for the related parties to understand
and address sexual harassment. In this study,
we manually annotated those stories with la-
bels in the dimensions of location, time, and
harassers’ characteristics, and marked the key
elements related to these dimensions. Further-
more, we applied natural language processing
technologies with joint learning schemes to
automatically categorize these stories in those
dimensions and extract key elements at the
same time. We also uncovered significant pat-
terns from the categorized sexual harassment
stories. We believe our annotated data set, pro-
posed algorithms, and analysis will help peo-
ple who have been harassed, authorities, re-
searchers and other related parties in various
ways, such as automatically filling reports, en-
lightening the public in order to prevent fu-
ture harassment, and enabling more effective,
faster action to be taken.

1 Introduction

Sexual violence, including harassment, is a perva-
sive, worldwide problem with a long history. This
global problem has finally become a mainstream
issue thanks to the efforts of survivors and advo-
cates. Statistics show that girls and women are put
at high risk of experiencing harassment. Women
have about a 3 in 5 chance of experiencing sexual
harassment, whereas men have slightly less than
1 in 5 chance (Quinnipiac, 2017; EEOC, 2018;

Goldstein, 2018). While women in developing
countries are facing distinct challenges with sexual
violence (Lea et al., 2017), however sexual vio-
lence is ubiquitous. In the United States, for exam-
ple, there are on average>300,000 people who are
sexually assaulted every year (Morgan and Tru-
man, 2018). Additionally, these numbers could be
underestimated, due to reasons like guilt, blame,
doubt and fear, which stopped many survivors
from reporting (Griffith, 2018). Social media can
be a more open and accessible channel for those
who have experienced harassment to be empow-
ered to freely share their traumatic experiences
and to raise awareness of the vast scale of sexual
harassment, which then allows us to understand
and actively address abusive behavior as part of
larger efforts to prevent future sexual harassment.
The deadly gang rape of a medical student on a
Delhi bus in 2012 was a catalyst for protest and ac-
tion, including the development of Safecity, which
uses online and mobile technology to work to-
wards ending sexual harassment and assault. More
recently, the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements,
further demonstrate how reporting personal stories
on social media can raise awareness and empower
women. Millions of people around the world have
come forward and shared their stories. Instead of
being bystanders, more and more people become
up-standers, who take action to protest against sex-
ual harassment online. The stories of people who
experienced harassment can be studied to identify
different patterns of sexual harassment, which can
enable solutions to be developed to make streets
safer and to keep women and girls more secure
when navigating city spaces (Karlekar and Bansal,
2018). In this paper, we demonstrated the appli-
cation of natural language processing (NLP) tech-
nologies to uncover harassment patterns from so-
cial media data. We made three key contributions:



2329

1. Safecity1 is the largest publicly-available on-
line forum for reporting sexual harassment (Kar-
lekar and Bansal, 2018). We annotated about
10,000 personal stories from Safecity with the key
elements, including information of harasser (i.e.
the words describing the harasser), time, location
and the trigger words (i.e. the phrases indicate the
harassment that occurred). The key elements are
important for studying the patterns of harassment
and victimology (Griffith, 2018; Ceccato, 2017).
Furthermore, we also associated each story with
five labels that characterize the story in multiple
dimensions (i.e. age of harasser, single/multiple
harasser(s), type of harasser, type of location and
time of day). The annotation data are available on-
line.2

2. We proposed joint learning NLP models
that use convolutional neural network (CNN) (Le-
cun and Bengio, 1995) and bi-directional long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) (Schuster and Pali-
wal, 1997; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) as
basic units. Our models can automatically ex-
tract the key elements from the sexual harass-
ment stories and at the same time categorize the
stories in different dimensions. The proposed
models outperformed the single task models, and
achieved higher than previously reported accuracy
in classifications of harassment forms (Karlekar
and Bansal, 2018).

3. We uncovered significant patterns from the
categorized sexual harassment stories.

2 Related Work

Conventional surveys and reports are often used to
study sexual harassment, but harassment on these
is usually under-reported (Goldstein, 2018; Grif-
fith, 2018). The high volume of social media data
available online can provide us a much larger col-
lection of firsthand stories of sexual harassment.
Social media data has already been used to an-
alyze and predict distinct societal and health is-
sues, in order to improve the understanding of
wide-reaching societal concerns, including men-
tal health, detecting domestic abuse, and cyberbul-
lying (Balani and De Choudhury, 2015; Schrad-
ing et al., 2015; Ziegele et al., 2018; Agrawal and
Awekar, 2018).

There are a very limited number of studies on

sexual harassment stories shared online. Kar-
lekar and Bansal (2018) were the first group to
our knowledge that applied NLP to analyze large
amount ( ∼10,000) of sexual harassment stories.
Although their CNN-RNN classification models
demonstrated high performance on classifying the
forms of harassment, only the top 3 majority forms
were studied. In order to study the details of
the sexual harassment, the trigger words are cru-
cial. Additionally, research indicated that both
situational factors and person (or individual dif-
ference) factors contribute to sexual harassment
(Hitlan et al., 2009). Therefore, the information
about perpetrators needs to be extracted as well
as the location and time of events. Karlekar and
Bansal (2018) applied several visualization tech-
niques in order to capture such information, but it
was not obtained explicitly. Our preliminary re-
search demonstrated automatic extraction of key
element and story classification in separate steps
(Liu et al., 2019). In this paper, we proposed joint
learning NLP models to directly extract the infor-
mation of the harasser, time, location and trigger
word as key elements and categorize the harass-
ment stories in five dimensions as well. Our ap-
proach can provide an avenue to automatically un-
cover nuanced circumstances informing sexual ha-
rassment from online stories.

3 Data Collection and Annotation

We obtained 9,892 stories of sexual harassment in-
cidents that was reported on Safecity. Those sto-
ries include a text description, along with tags of
the forms of harassment, e.g. commenting, ogling
and groping. A dataset of these stories was pub-
lished by Karlekar and Bansal (2018). In ad-
dition to the forms of harassment, we manually
annotated each story with the key elements (i.e.
“harasser”, “time”, “location”, “trigger”), because
they are essential to uncover the harassment pat-
terns. An example is shown in Figure 1. Further-
more, we also assigned each story classification
labels in five dimensions (Table 1). The detailed
definitions of classifications in all dimensions are
explained below.

Age of Harasser: Individual difference such as
age can affect harassment behaviors. Therefore,

we studied the harassers in two age groups, young
and adult. Young people in this paper refer to peo-
ple in the early 20s or younger.

Single/Multiple Harasser(s): Harassers may
behave differently in groups than they do alone.

Type of Harasser: Person factors in harass-
ment include the common relationships or titles of
the harassers. Additionally, the reactions of peo-
ple who experience harassment may vary with the
harassers’ relations to themselves (Griffith, 2018).
We defined 10 groups with respects to the ha-
rassers’ relationships or titles. We put conductors
and drivers in one group, as they both work on the
public transportation. Police and guards are put in
the same category, because they are employed to
provide security. Manager, supervisors, and col-
leagues are in the work-related group. The others
are described by their names.

Type of Location: It will be helpful to reveal
the places where harassment most frequently oc-
curs (Ceccato, 2017; Karlekar and Bansal, 2018).
We defined 14 types of locations. “Station/stop”
refers to places where people wait for public trans-
portation or buy tickets. Private places include sur-
vivors’ or harassers’ home, places of parties and
etc. The others are described by their names.

Time of Day: The time of an incident may be
reported as “in evening” or at a specific time, e.g.
“10 pm”. We considered that 5 am to 6 pm as day
time, and the rest of the day as the night.

Because many of the stories collected are short,
many do not contain all of the key elements. For
example, “A man came near to her tried to be
physical with her .”. The time and location are un-
known from the story. In addition, the harassers
were strangers to those they harassed in many
cases. For instance, “My friend was standing in
the queue to pay bill and was ogled by a group
of boys.”, we can only learn that there were mul-
tiple young harassers, but the type of harasser is

unclear. The missing information is hence marked
as “unspecified”. It is different from the label
“other”, which means the information is provided
but the number of them is too small to be repre-
sented by a group, for example, a “trader”.

All the data were labeled by two annotators with
training. Inter-rater agreement was measured by
Cohen’s kappa coefficient, ranging from 0.71 to
0.91 for classifications in different dimensions and
0.75 for key element extraction (details can refer to
Table 1 in supplementary file). The disagreements
were reviewed by a third annotator and a final de-
cision was made.

4 Proposed Models

The key elements can be very informative when
categorizing the incidents. For instance, in Fig-
ure 1, with identified key elements, one can eas-
ily categorize the incident in dimensions of “age
of harasser” (adult), “single/multiple harasser(s)”
(single), “type of harasser” (unspecified), “type of
location” (park) , “time of day” (day time). There-
fore, we proposed two joint learning schemes to
extract the key elements and categorize the inci-
dents together. In the models’ names, “J”, “A”,
“SA” stand for joint learning, attention, and super-
vised attention, respectively.

4.1 CNN Based Joint Learning Models

In Figure 2, the first proposed structure consists of
two layers of CNN modules.

J-CNN: To predict the type of key element,
it is essential for the CNN model to capture the
context information around each word. There-
fore, the word along with its surrounding con-
text of a fixed window size was converted into
a context sequence. Assuming a window size of
2l + 1 around the target word w0, the context se-
quence is [(w−l, w−l+1, ...w0, ...wl−1, wl)], where
wi(i ∈ [−l, l]) stands for the ith word from w0.



2331

Figure 2: CNN based Joint learning Model. WL and WR are the left and right context around each word.

Figure 3: BiLSM based Joint Learning Model. Here we use an input of five words as an example.

Because the context of the two consecutive
words in the original text are only off by one po-
sition, it will be difficult for the CNN model to
detect the difference. Therefore, the position of
each word in this context sequence is crucial in-
formation for the CNN model to make the correct
predictions (Nguyen and Grishman, 2015). That
position was embedded as a p dimensional vector,
where p is a hyperparameter. The position em-
beddings were learned at the training stage. Each
word in the original text was then converted into
a sequence of the concatenation of word and po-
sition embeddings. Such sequence was fed into
the CNN modules in the first layer of the model,
which output the high level word representation
(hi, i ∈ [0, n− 1], where n is the number of input
words). The high level word representation was
then passed into a fully connected layer, to pre-

dict the key element type for the word. The CNN
modules in this layer share the same parameters.

We input the sequence of high level word rep-
resentations (hi) from the first layer into another
layer of multiple CNN modules to categorize the
harassment incident in each dimension (Figure 2).
Inside each CNN module, the sequence of word
representations were first passed through a convo-
lution layer to generate a sequence of new feature
vectors (C = [c0, c1, ...cq]). This vector sequence
(C) was then fed into a max pooling layer. This
is followed by a fully connected layer. Modules in
this layer do not share parameters across classifi-
cation tasks.

J-ACNN: We also experimented with attentive
pooling, by replacing the max pooling layer. The
attention layer aggregates the sequence of feature
vectors (C) by measuring the contribution of each



2332

vector to form the high level representation of the
harassment story. Specifically,

ui = tanh(Wωci + bω) (1)

αi =
exp(uTi uω)∑
i exp(u

T
i uw)

(2)

v =
∑
i

αici (3)

That is, a fully connected layer with non-linear
activation was applied to each vector ci to get its
hidden representation ui. The similarity of ui with
a context vector uw was measured and get normal-
ized through a softmax function, as the importance
weight αi. The final representation of the incident
story v was an aggregation of all the feature vec-
tors weighted by αi. Wω, bω and uw were learned
during training.

The final representation (v) was passed into
one fully connected layer for each classification
task. We also applied different attention layers
for different classifications, because the classifica-
tion modules categorize the incident in different
dimensions, their focuses vary. For example, to
classify “time of day”, one needs to focus on the
time phrases, but pays more attention to harassers
when classifying “age of harasser”.

J-SACNN: To further exploit the information
of the key elements, we applied supervision (Zhao
et al., 2018) to the attentive pooling layer, with
the annotated key element types of the words as
ground truth. For instance, in classification of “age
of harasser”, the ground truth attention labels for
words with key element types of “harasser” are 1
and others are 0. To conform to the CNN structure,
we applied convolution to the sequence of ground
truth attention labels, with the same window size
(w) that was applied to the word sequence (Eq. 4).

α∗(t) =W ◦ [et : et+w−1] (4)

where ◦ is element-wise multiplication, et is the
ground truth attention label, and the W ∈ Rw×1
is a constant matrix with all elements equal to 1.
α∗ was normalized through a softmax function and
used as ground truth weight values of the vector
sequence (C) output from the convolution layer.
The loss was calculated between learned attention
α and α∗ (Eq. 5), and added to the total loss.

E(α, α∗) =

q∑
i=0

(αi − α∗i )2 (5)

4.2 BiLSTM Based Joint Learning Models
J-BiLSTM: The model input the sequence of
word embeddings to the BiLSTM layer. To extract
key elements, the hidden states from the forward
and backward LSTM cells were concatenated and
used as word representations to predict the key el-
ement types.

To classify the harassment story in different di-
mensions, concatenation of the forward and back-
ward final states of BiLSTM layer was used as
document level representation of the story.

J-ABiLSTM: We also experimented on BiL-
STM model with the attention layer to aggregate
the outputs from BiLSTM layer (Figure 3). The
aggregation of the outputs was used as document
level representation.

J-SABiLSTM: Similarly, we experimented
with the supervised attention.

In all the models, softmax function was used to
calculate the probabilities at the prediction step,
and the cross entropy losses from extraction and
classification tasks were added together. In case
of supervised attention, the loss defined in Eq.
5 was added to the total loss as well. We ap-
plied the stochastic gradient descent algorithm
with mini-batches and the AdaDelta update Rule
(rho=0.95 and epsilon=1e-6) (Zeiler, 2012; Feng
et al., 2016). The gradients were computed using
back-propagation. During training, we also opti-
mized the word and position embeddings.

5 Experiments and Results

5.1 Experimental Settings
Data Splits: We used the same splits of train, de-
velop, and test sets used by Karlekar and Bansal
(Karlekar and Bansal, 2018), with 7201, 990 and
1701 stories, respectively. In this study, we only
considered single label classifications.

Baseline Models: CNN and BiLSTM mod-
els that perform classification and extraction sepa-
rately were used as baseline models. In classifica-
tion, we also experimented with BiLSTM with the
attention layer. To demonstrate that the improve-
ment came from joint learning structure rather the
two layer structure in J-CNN, we investigated the
same model structure without training on key ele-
ment extraction. We use J-CNN* to denote it.

Preprocess: All the texts were converted to
lowercase and preprocessed by removing non-
alphanumeric characters, excluding “. ! ? ” . The
word embeddings were pre-trained using fastText



2333

(Bojanowski et al., 2016) with dimension equaling
100.

Hyperparameters: For the CNN model, the fil-
ter size was chosen to be (1,2,3,4), with 50 filters
per filter size. Batch size was set to 50 and the
dropout rate was 0.5. The BiLSTM model com-
prises two layers of one directional LSTM. Every
LSTM cell has 50 hidden units. The dropout rate
was 0.25. Attention size was 50.

5.2 Results and Discussions

We compared joint learning models with the sin-
gle task models. Results are averages from five
experiments. Although not much improvement
was achieved in key element extraction (Figure 2),
classification performance improved significantly
with joint learning schemes (Table 3). Signifi-
cance t-test results are shown in Table 2 in the sup-
plementary file.

BiLSTM Based Models: Joint learning BiL-
STM with attention outperformed single task BiL-
STM models. One reason is that it directed the at-
tention of the model to the correct part of the text.
For example,

S1: “when i was returning my home after fin-
ishing my class . i was in queue to get on the micro
bus and there was a girl opposite to me just then a
young man tried to touch her on the breast .”

S2: “when i was returning my home after fin-
ishing my class . i was in queue to get on the micro
bus and there was a girl opposite to me just then a
young man tried to touch her on the breast .”

S3: “when i was returning my home after fin-
ishing my class . i was in queue to get on the micro
bus and there was a girl opposite to me just then a
young man tried to touch her on the breast .”

In S1, the regular BiLSTM with attention model
for classification on “age of harasser” put some
attention on phrases other than the harasser, and
hence aggregated noise. This could explain why
the regular BiLSTM model got lower performance
than the CNN model. However, when train-
ing with key element extractions, it put almost
all attention on the harasser “young man” (S2),
which helped the model make correct prediction
of “young harasser”. When predicting the “type
of location” (S3), the joint learning model directed
its attention to “micro bus”.

CNN Based Models: Since CNN is efficient
for capturing the most useful information (Chen
et al., 2015), it is quite suitable for the classifica-

tion tasks in this study. It achieved better perfor-
mance than the BiLSTM model. The joint learn-
ing method boosted the performance even higher.
This is because the classifications are related to the
extracted key elements, and the word representa-
tion learned by the first layer of CNNs (Figure 2) is
more informative than word embedding. By plot-
ting of t-SNEs (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) of the
two kinds of word vectors, we can see the word
representations in the joint learning model made
the words more separable (Figure 1 in supplemen-
tary file). In addition, no improvement was found
with the J-CNN* model, which demonstrated the
joint learning with extraction is essential for the
improvement.

With supervised attentive pooling, the model
can get additional knowledge from key element la-
bels. It helped the model in cases when certain
location phrases were mentioned but the incidents
did not happen at those locations. For instance, “I

was followed on my way home .”, max pooling will
very likely to predict it as “private places”. But, it
is actually unknown. In other cases, with super-
vised attentive pooling, the model can distinguish
“metro” and “metro station”, which are “trans-
portation” and “stop/station” respectively. There-
fore, the model further improved on classifications
on “type of location” with supervised attention in
terms of macro F1. For some tasks, like “time of
day”, there are fewer cases with such disambigua-
tion and hence max pooling worked well. Super-
vised attention improved macro F1 in location and
harasser classifications, because it made more cor-
rect predictions in cases that mentioned location
and harasser. But the majority did not mention
them. Therefore, the accuracy of J-SACNN did
not increase, compared with the other models.

Classification on Harassment Forms: In Ta-
ble 4, we also compared the performance of bi-
nary classifications on harassment forms with the
results reported by Karlekar and Bansal (2018).
Joint learning models achieved higher accuracy.
In some harassment stories, the whole text or a
span of the text consists of trigger words of multi-
ple forms, such as “stare, whistles, start to sing,
commenting”. The supervised attention mecha-
nism will force the model to look at all such words
rather than just the one related to the harassment
form for classification and hence it can introduce
noise. This can explain why J-SACNN got lower
accuracy in two of the harassment form classifica-
tions, compared to J-ACNN. In addition, J-CNN
model did best in “ogling” classification.

6 Patterns of Sexual Harassment

We plotted the distribution of harassment incidents
in each categorization dimension (Figure 4). It dis-
plays statistics that provide important evidence as
to the scale of harassment and that can serve as the

Figure 4: Distributions of incidents. A) Distribu-
tions over age of harasser, B) over single/multiple ha-
rasser(s), C) over time of day, D) over type of harasser.
E) over type of location.

basis for more effective interventions to be devel-
oped by authorities ranging from advocacy orga-
nizations to policy makers. It provides evidence
to support some commonly assumed factors about
harassment: First, we demonstrate that harassment
occurred more frequently during the night time
than the day time. Second, it shows that besides
unspecified strangers (not shown in the figure),
conductors and drivers are top the list of identified
types of harassers, followed by friends and rela-
tives.

Furthermore, we uncovered that there exist
strong correlations between the age of perpetra-
tors and the location of harassment, between the
single/multiple harasser(s) and location, and be-
tween age and single/multiple harasser(s) (Figure
5). The significance of the correlation is tested
by chi-square independence with p value less than
0.05. Identifying these patterns will enable in-
terventions to be differentiated for and targeted
at specific populations. For instance, the young
harassers often engage in harassment activities as
groups. This points to the influence of peer pres-
sure and masculine behavioral norms for men and
boys on these activities. We also found that the
majority of young perpetrators engaged in harass-
ment behaviors on the streets. These findings sug-
gest that interventions with young men and boys,
who are readily influenced by peers, might be most
effective when education is done peer-to-peer. It
also points to the locations where such efforts

mensions. A) Distributions of incidents A) with
young/adult harassers at each location, B) with sin-
gle/multiple harasser(s) at each location, C) across
young/adult harassers and single/multiple harasser(s)

could be made, including both in schools and on
the streets. In contrast, we found that adult per-
petrators of sexual harassment are more likely to
act alone. Most of the adult harassers engaged in
harassment on public transportation. These differ-
ences in adult harassment activities and locations,
mean that interventions should be responsive to
these factors. For example, increasing the security
measures on transit at key times and locations.

In addition, we also found that the correlations
between the forms of harassment with the age,
single/multiple harasser, type of harasser, and lo-
cation (Figure 6). For example, young harassers
are more likely to engage in behaviors of ver-
bal harassment, rather than physical harassment
as compared to adults. It was a single perpetra-
tor that engaged in touching or groping more of-
ten, rather than groups of perpetrators. In contrast,
commenting happened more frequently when ha-
rassers were in groups. Last but not least, pub-
lic transportation is where people got indecently
touched most frequently both by fellow passengers
and by conductors and drivers. The nature and lo-
cation of the harassment are particularly signifi-
cant in developing strategies for those who are ha-
rassed or who witness the harassment to respond
and manage the everyday threat of harassment.
For example, some strategies will work best on
public transport, a particular closed, shared space
setting, while other strategies might be more ef-
fective on the open space of the street.

ment forms and different dimensions. Distributions

These results can provide valuable information
for all members of the public. Sharing stories of
harassment has been found by researchers to shift
people’s cognitive and emotional orientation to-
wards their traumatic experiences (Dimond et al.,
2013). Greater awareness of patterns and scale of
harassment experiences promises to ensure those
who have been subjected to this violence that they
are not alone, empowering others to report in-
cidents, and ensuring them that efforts are be-
ing made to prevent others from experiencing the
same harassment. These results also provide var-
ious authorities tools to identify potential harass-
ment patterns and to make more effective interven-
tions to prevent further harassment incidents. For
instance, the authorities can increase targeted edu-
cational efforts at youth and adults, and be guided
in utilizing limited resources the most effectively
to offer more safety measures, including policing
and community-based responses. For example, fo-
cusing efforts on highly populated public trans-
portation during the nighttime, when harassment
is found to be most likely to occur.

7 Conclusions

We provided a large number of annotated personal
stories of sexual harassment. Analyzing and iden-
tifying the social patterns of harassment behavior
is essential to changing these patterns and social
tolerance for them. We demonstrated the joint
learning NLP models with strong performances to



2336

automatically extract key elements and categorize
the stories. Potentiality, the approaches and mod-
els proposed in this study can be applied to sex-
ual harassment stories from other sources, which
can process and summarize the harassment stories
and help those who have experienced harassment
and authorities to work faster, such as by automat-
ically filing reports (Karlekar and Bansal, 2018).
Furthermore, we discovered meaningful patterns
in the situations where harassment commonly oc-
curred. The volume of social media data is huge,
and the more we can extract from these data, the
more powerful we can be as part of the efforts to
build a safer and more inclusive communities. Our
work can increase the understanding of sexual ha-
rassment in society, ease the processing of such
incidents by advocates and officials, and most im-
portantly, raise awareness of this urgent problem.
