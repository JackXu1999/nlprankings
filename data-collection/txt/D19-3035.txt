Abstract

Computational stylometry has become an in-
creasingly important aspect of literary criti-
cism, but many humanists lack the technical
expertise or language-specific NLP resources
required to exploit computational methods.
We demonstrate a stylometry toolkit for analy-
sis of Latin literary texts, which is freely avail-
able at www.qcrit.org/stylometry.
Our toolkit generates data for a diverse range
of literary features and has an intuitive point-
and-click interface. The features included
have proven effective for multiple literary
studies and are calculated using custom heuris-
tics without the need for syntactic parsing. As
such, the toolkit models one approach to the
user-friendly generation of stylometric data,
which could be extended to other premod-
ern and non-English languages underserved by
standard NLP resources.

1 Introduction

Stylometry, the quantitative analysis of writing
style, is an longstanding yet active area of re-
search in literary studies. Traditional applications
of stylometry in both classical and modern literary
scholarship have focused on authorship attribution
and establishing relative chronology (Mosteller
and Wallace, 1964; Marriott, 1979; Fitch, 1981;
Vickers, 2004; Jockers and Witten, 2010; Stover
et al., 2016). In recent years, new digital tools
and computational methods, especially machine
learning (Long and So, 2016; Dexter et al., 2017),
have allowed researchers to address more fine-
grained literary critical questions and have also
given rise to novel frameworks for literary anal-
ysis, such as ‘distant reading’ and ‘macroanaly-
sis’ (Moretti, 2013; Jockers, 2013; Piper, 2018;
Underwood, 2019).

Much research in computational stylometry has
focused on English literature due in part to the rich

NLP resources available for the English language,
especially high-quality syntactic parsing. NLP re-
sources for many premodern and non-English lan-
guages are, by contrast, at an earlier stage of de-
velopment or entirely lacking. Moreover, many
of the academic disciplines studying these lan-
guages are smaller than for English, and thus the
community of potential developers is correspond-
ingly reduced. These factors suggest the need for
user-friendly stylometric tools, which can provide
a wide range of literary data for under-resourced
languages and are suitable for use by humanists
lacking a computational background.

Syntactic parsing, which remains at an early
stage of development for Latin,1 is not a prereq-
uisite for the successful application of computa-
tional stylometry to literary problems. Our prior
work has shown that custom heuristics can enable
extraction of a wide range of features useful for
the study of Latin literature, in particular syntac-
tic markers, non-content words, and elements of
sound and rhythm (Dexter et al., 2017; Chaudhuri
et al., 2018). Here we report development of a
point-and-click stylometry toolkit to enable easy
generation of such data for a corpus containing al-
most all major classical Latin texts.

Other recently developed stylometry packages,
such as the “stylo” R package and Lexomics, are
aimed at audiences with a range of computational
expertise (Eder et al., 2016; Drout et al., 2007).
These packages, however, have typically been de-
veloped for general-purpose application to multi-
ple languages instead of a single language. Focus-
ing on the latter creates opportunities for targeting
language-specific features, which often play a cru-
cial role in literary style.

1See, for example, the recent progress of the Clas-
sical Language Toolkit (CLTK) (www.cltk.org) and
StanfordNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/
stanfordnlp/index.html).

The need for a point-and-click toolkit is partic-
ularly acute in classical studies. Although clas-
sical philologists have long applied stylometry to
shed light on questions of authorship, relatively
few studies have employed digital tools. Excep-
tions have tended to focus on a restricted set of
features, such as relative word frequency (Stover
et al., 2016) or average sentence length (Marriott,
1979; Clayman, 1981). Such limitations may be
due in part to the absence of an accurate method
for syntactic parsing, and in part to a more gen-
eral lack of collaboration to date between clas-
sical philologists and NLP specialists. By im-
proving the accessibility of rich philological data,
our toolkit should further promote the adoption
of quantitative approaches by literary critics. At
the same time, the toolkit bridges the gap between
classical studies and research on English, in which
computational approaches are more common and
are supported by a more extensive technical appa-
ratus.

2 Toolkit

Our toolkit provides researchers working with
Latin literature access to large-scale stylomet-
ric data difficult to acquire by non-computational
methods and enables humanists without specialist
digital training to construct custom datasets.

The design goal for the toolkit is to provide
an intuitive and easy-to-use interface hosted in a
web browser. The interface is point-and-click and
can be used by researchers with no prior program-
ming or NLP experience. Users can choose from
over 700 Latin texts, which comprise almost all
of the surviving corpus of classical Latin. The
texts were originally digitized by the Perseus Dig-
ital Library and further developed by the Tesserae
Project (Crane, 1996; Coffee et al., 2012). Texts
can be selected by author, text, or book (roughly
the ancient equivalent of a chapter). Searches can
be as fine-grained as examining a single book, or
as large-scale as analyzing the entire built-in cor-
pus in one go (Figure 1).

Next, users select the stylometric features to an-
alyze for their chosen corpus. They can run anal-
yses using any combination of the twenty-six fea-
tures (Figure 2 shows a sample output). The re-
sults are displayed on a spreadsheet in the web
browser and can be downloaded as a CSV file. In
addition, a user can produce simple visualizations
(e.g., a bar chart comparing the values of a partic-

ular feature across a set of texts) inside the toolkit.
The ease with which the toolkit can be used

does not limit its versatility. A user can create a
custom corpus of texts preselected from the ex-
isting database, which is close to comprehensive
for canonical material, or upload texts of their
own for analysis. This latter functionality is es-
pecially important for understudied texts, such as
those produced in Late Antiquity and during the
Renaissance, the sum total of which far exceeds
the quantity of extant classical Latin. While dig-
ital versions are available for many post-classical
texts, for the most part the later periods are not
well served by the prominent tools or repositories
in the field, which maintain a classical focus. Our
toolkit allows users to analyze any text available
in electronic form. Furthermore, if a work is not
available online, a user may upload a plain text file
or transcribe it directly into the upload interface.

3 Features

Our feature set comprises twenty-six stylometric
features across four broad syntactic and grammat-
ical categories (pronouns and non-content adjec-
tives, subordinate clauses, conjunctions, and mis-
cellaneous, as listed in Table 1) and is described in
detail in a previous publication (Chaudhuri et al.,
2018). Some features are lexical (e.g., preposi-
tions), while others are syntactic (e.g., sentence
length) or address semantic and rhetorical aspects
of the texts (e.g., superlatives and interrogative
sentences). Taken together, the features offer a
rich and diverse, albeit necessarily partial, profile
of Latin literary style.

An important aspect of our toolkit is that it
does not depend on syntactic parsing, named en-
tity recognition, or other NLP methods that have
not been developed fully for classical Latin (Erd-
mann et al., 2016). We employ three strate-
gies to circumvent current technical limitations.
The majority of features (Alius, Idem, Ipse, Iste,
Quidam, Demonstrative Pronouns, Personal Pro-
nouns, Third-Person Pronouns, Atque + Conso-
nant, Antequam, Cum, Dum, Priusquam, Quin,
Quominus, Ut, and Prepositions) are computed us-
ing hard-coded lists of almost all possible forms
of the relevant Latin words. While some features
(e.g., Quin or Dum) are frequencies of a single
form, others (e.g., Demonstrative Pronouns) in-
volve long lists of morphological variants. Other
features are estimated based on the frequency of a

signal n-gram. For instance, all regular superlative
adjectives include the n-gram -issim- (e.g., largis-
simus, “most abundant” or clarissima, “clearest”).
As this n-gram is extremely rare outside of su-
perlatives, we could curate a near-comprehensive
list of exclusions (e.g., dissimilis, “unlike”). We
use a similar strategy to capture the instances of
selected gerunds and gerundives, which contain
the n-grams -ndus, -ndum, -ndarum, or -ndorum.
A third class of features are determined using
punctuation (e.g., question marks to assess the fre-
quency of direct interrogative sentences or to filter
interrogative pronouns, which have many forms
in common with relative pronouns, from relative
clause counts).

The precision and recall of each of these heuris-
tics is discussed in detail in (Chaudhuri et al.,
2018). We emphasize that these approaches are
not intended as a substitute for NLP, but rather
as a stopgap for philologists until more substan-
tial resources become available for classical lan-

guages. We expect that the overall usefulness of
the toolkit will increase as our heuristics are ren-
dered obsolete by improvements in part-of-speech
tagging and dependency parsing for Latin.

Our features are drawn from a wide array of
sources in order to maximize the capture of infor-
mation pertinent to Latin literary style. Some fea-
tures, such as prepositions, are inspired by stud-
ies of other languages, where they have proven
useful for the characterization of genres or sub-
genres (Jockers, 2013). Most features, however,
are based on previous studies of Latin style and are
designed to capture aspects specific to the Latin
language (Adams, 1972; Adams et al., 2005). For
example, atque (“and”) followed by a word begin-
ning with a consonant is a stylistic feature that is
associated with certain influential figures writing
early in the tradition. When later authors employ
atque + consonant, they do so either in imitation of
these figures specifically, or to recall an archaizing
style more generally.

4 Literary Importance

The stylometric data generated by the toolkit sheds
light on a variety of literary problems. The sim-
plest type of analysis involves a single feature cal-
culated across a small number of texts. Past re-
search in Ancient Greek stylometry, for instance,
has shown that sentence length constitutes one
meaningful difference between the early Home-
ric hexameter tradition and the Hellenistic tradi-
tion, since later writers use longer sentences even
as they retain other core aspects such as formu-
laic language and meter (Clayman, 1981). Fig-
ure 3 shows the mean sentence length of most of
the surviving classical Latin epics as calculated
by the toolkit. Three texts, De Rerum Natura
by Lucretius, Astronomicon by Manilius, and the

Georgics by Vergil, have noticeably longer sen-
tences on average (mean length >140 characters,
compared to <125 characters for the other epics).
An attractive explanation for the three anomalous
texts is that they are all identified with a sub-
genre of epic known as “didactic,” a specific class
which purports to teach its readers philosophy or
a specialized technical skill, such as astrology or
farming. The sentences are longer plausibly be-
cause detailed treatment of intricate philosophi-
cal or technical issues requires more complex sen-
tences than typically more straightforward narra-
tive action or direct speech, which represent the
principal content of the other epics.

Figure 3: Mean sentence length of Latin epic poems (in
characters). Error bars denote one s.d. across the eight
poems.

The toolkit also reveals that Latin drama has a
higher frequency of personal pronouns than other
verse genres, as shown in Figure 4. This is no
doubt due to drama’s dialogic form: characters
speak to each other directly, often employing first
(“I” or “we”) and second person (“you”) pro-
nouns. Many other literary genres primarily em-
ploy a narrative structure in which a narrator de-
scribes the action. This narrative type often uses
third person pronouns (“he,”“she,” “it”), but rarely
uses first or second person pronouns. Accordingly,
the frequency of personal pronoun use is higher in
drama. While this difference may be intuitive to a
reader, the large-scale data generated by the toolkit
offers quantitative evidence of a genre’s formal
style, which would otherwise be difficult if not im-



209

possible to calculate by hand.

pronouns in the major genres of Latin literature. Er-
ror bars denote one s.d. across the texts within each of
the four genres.

Finally, the toolkit can also generate input data
for supervised and unsupervised machine learning
analyses. In our recent study of Latin prose and
verse, we trained a random forest classifier using
all 26 features to distinguish the two genres with
high (>97%) accuracy (Chaudhuri et al., 2018).
The underlying data can now be produced easily
using the toolkit, and similar datasets can be con-
structed for other machine learning applications.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper introduces a stylometry toolkit for
Latin literature, which incorporates a diverse fea-
ture set demonstrably useful for literary criticism.
The toolkit includes a point-and-click interface
to maximize usage among core domain special-
ists, principally researchers in the humanities, who
may not have specialized computational training.
Future versions of the toolkit will further diver-
sify the feature set, incorporating high-frequency
n-grams and sense-pauses alongside the existing
categories (Fitch, 1981; Dexter et al., 2017), and
will leverage expected advances in Latin NLP to
improve the methods for calculation of existing
features.

In related work, we have developed a similar
feature set for Ancient Greek, which has been used
to classify prose and verse and, at a more fine-
grained level, epic and drama (Gianitsos et al.,

2019). Our work on Old English has demonstrated
the utility of related features for various literary
and attribution studies (Neidorf et al., 2019). After
extension of the current toolkit to Ancient Greek
and Old English, we plan in due course to incor-
porate other underserved languages, in particular
Bengali.
