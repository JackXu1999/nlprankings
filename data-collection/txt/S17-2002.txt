Abstract

This paper introduces a new task on Multi-
lingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word
Similarity which measures the semantic
similarity of word pairs within and across
five languages: English, Farsi, German,
Italian and Spanish. High quality datasets
were manually curated for the five lan-
guages with high inter-annotator agree-
ments (consistently in the 0.9 ballpark).
These were used for semi-automatic con-
struction of ten cross-lingual datasets. 17
teams participated in the task, submitting
24 systems in subtask 1 and 14 systems in
subtask 2. Results show that systems that
combine statistical knowledge from text
corpora, in the form of word embeddings,
and external knowledge from lexical re-
sources are best performers in both sub-
tasks. More information can be found on

1 Introduction

Measuring the extent to which two words are se-
mantically similar is one of the most popular re-
search fields in lexical semantics, with a wide
range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) ap-
plications. Examples include Word Sense Disam-
biguation (Miller et al., 2012), Information Re-
trieval (Hliaoutakis et al., 2006), Machine Trans-
lation (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), Lexical Sub-
stitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009), Question
Answering (Mohler et al., 2011), Text Summa-
rization (Mohammad and Hirst, 2012), and On-
tology Alignment (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014).
Moreover, word similarity is generally accepted as
the most direct in-vitro evaluation framework for

word representation, a research field that has re-
cently received massive research attention mainly
as a result of the advancements in the use of neural
networks for learning dense low-dimensional se-
mantic representations, often referred to as word
embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington
et al., 2014). Almost any application in NLP that
deals with semantics can benefit from efficient se-
mantic representation of words (Turney and Pan-
tel, 2010).

However, research in semantic representation
has in the main focused on the English language
only. This is partly due to the limited availabil-
ity of word similarity benchmarks in languages
other than English. Given the central role of
similarity datasets in lexical semantics, and given
the importance of moving beyond the barriers of
the English language and developing language-
independent and multilingual techniques, we felt
that this was an appropriate time to conduct a task
that provides a reliable framework for evaluating
multilingual and cross-lingual semantic represen-
tation and similarity techniques. The task has
two related subtasks: multilingual semantic sim-
ilarity (Section 1.1), which focuses on representa-
tion learning for individual languages, and cross-
lingual semantic similarity (Section 1.2), which
provides a benchmark for multilingual research
that learns unified representations for multiple lan-
guages.

1.1 Subtask 1: Multilingual Semantic
Similarity

While the English community has been using
standard word similarity datasets as a common
evaluation benchmark, semantic representation for
other languages has generally proved difficult to
evaluate. A reliable multilingual word similar-
ity benchmark can be hugely beneficial in eval-
uating the robustness and reliability of semantic

15



representation techniques across languages. De-
spite this, very few word similarity datasets ex-
ist for languages other than English: The origi-
nal English RG-65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough,
1965) and WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002)
datasets have been translated into other languages,
either by experts (Gurevych, 2005; Joubarne and
Inkpen, 2011; Granada et al., 2014; Camacho-
Collados et al., 2015), or by means of crowdsourc-
ing (Leviant and Reichart, 2015), thereby creat-
ing equivalent datasets in languages other than En-
glish. However, the existing English word similar-
ity datasets suffer from various issues:

1. The similarity scale used for the annotation of
WordSim-353 and MEN (Bruni et al., 2014)
does not distinguish between similarity and
relatedness, and hence conflates these two.
As a result, the datasets contain pairs that
are judged to be highly similar even if they
are not of similar type or nature. For in-
stance, the WordSim-353 dataset contains the
pairs weather-forecast or clothes-closet with
assigned similarity scores of 8.34 and 8.00
(on the [0,10] scale), respectively. Clearly,
the words in the two pairs are (highly) re-
lated, but they are not similar.

2. The performance of state-of-the-art systems
have already surpassed the levels of human
inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for many
of the old datasets, e.g., for RG-65 and
WordSim-353. This makes these datasets
unreliable benchmarks for the evaluation of
newly-developed systems.

3. Conventional datasets such as RG-65, MC-
30 (Miller and Charles, 1991), and WS-Sim
(Agirre et al., 2009) (the similarity portion
of WordSim-353) are relatively small, con-
taining 65, 30, and 200 word pairs, respec-
tively. Hence, these benchmarks do not allow
reliable conclusions to be drawn, since per-
formance improvements have to be large to
be statistically significant (Batchkarov et al.,
2016).

4. The recent SimLex-999 dataset (Hill et al.,
2015) improves both the size and consistency
issues of the conventional datasets by provid-
ing word similarity scores for 999 word pairs
on a consistent scale that focuses on simi-
larity only (and not relatedness). However,

the dataset suffers from other issues. First,
given that SimLex-999 has been annotated
by turkers, and not by human experts, the
similarity scores assigned to individual word
pairs have a high variance, resulting in rela-
tively low IAA (Camacho-Collados and Nav-
igli, 2016). In fact, the reported IAA for this
dataset is 0.67 in terms of average pairwise
correlation, which is considerably lower than
conventional expert-based datasets whose
IAA are generally above 0.80 (Rubenstein
and Goodenough, 1965; Camacho-Collados
et al., 2015). Second, similarly to many of the
above-mentioned datasets, SimLex-999 does
not contain named entities (e.g., Microsoft),
or multiword expressions (e.g., black hole).
In fact, the dataset includes only words that
are defined in WordNet's vocabulary (Miller
et al., 1990), and therefore lacks the ability
to test the reliability of systems for WordNet
out-of-vocabulary words. Third, the dataset
contains a large number of antonymy pairs.
Indeed, several recent works have shown how
significant performance improvements can be
obtained on this dataset by simply tweaking
usual word embedding approaches to handle
antonymy (Schwartz et al., 2015; Pham et al.,
2015; Nguyen et al., 2016).

Since most existing multilingual word similar-
ity datasets are constructed on the basis of con-
ventional English datasets, any issues associated
with the latter tend simply to be transferred to
the former. This is the reason why we proposed
this task and constructed new challenging datasets
for five different languages (i.e., English, Farsi,
German, Italian, and Spanish) addressing all the
above-mentioned issues. Given that multiple large
and high-quality verb similarity datasets have been
created in recent years (Yang and Powers, 2006;
Baker et al., 2014; Gerz et al., 2016), we decided
to focus on nominal words.

1.2 Subtask 2: Cross-lingual Semantic
Similarity

Over the past few years multilingual embeddings
that represent lexical items from multiple lan-
guages in a unified semantic space have garnered
considerable research attention (Zou et al., 2013;
de Melo, 2015; Vulić and Moens, 2016; Ammar
et al., 2016; Upadhyay et al., 2016), while at
the same time cross-lingual applications have also

16



been increasingly studied (Xiao and Guo, 2014;
Franco-Salvador et al., 2016). However, there
have been very few reliable datasets for evaluat-
ing cross-lingual systems. Similarly to the case of
multilingual datasets, these cross-lingual datasets
have been constructed on the basis of conven-
tional English word similarity datasets: MC-30
and WordSim-353 (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2009),
and RG-65 (Camacho-Collados et al., 2015). As
a result, they inherit the issues affecting their par-
ent datasets mentioned in the previous subsection:
while MC-30 and RG-65 are composed of only
30 and 65 pairs, WordSim-353 conflates similarity
and relatedness in different languages. Moreover,
the datasets of Hassan and Mihalcea (2009) were
not re-scored after having been translated to the
other languages, thus ignoring possible semantic
shifts across languages and producing unreliable
scores for many translated word pairs.

For this subtask we provided ten high qual-
ity cross-lingual datasets, constructed according to
the procedure of Camacho-Collados et al. (2015),
in a semi-automatic manner exploiting the mono-
lingual datasets of subtask 1. These datasets con-
stitute a reliable evaluation framework across five
languages.

2 Task Data

Subtask 1, i.e., multilingual semantic similarity,
has five datasets for the five languages of the task,
i.e., English, Farsi, German, Italian, and Span-
ish. These datasets were manually created with the
help of trained annotators (as opposed to Mechan-
ical Turk) that were native or fluent speakers of
the target language. Based on these five datasets,
10 cross-lingual datasets were automatically gen-
erated (described in Section 2.2) for subtask 2, i.e.,
cross-lingual semantic similarity.

In this section we focus on the creation of the
evaluation test sets. We additionally created a set
of small trial datasets by following a similar pro-
cess. These datasets were used by some partici-
pants during system development.

2.1 Monolingual datasets

As for monolingual datasets, we opted for a size of
500 word pairs in order to provide a large enough
set to allow reliable evaluation and comparison of
the systems. The following procedure was used
for the construction of multilingual datasets: (1)
we first collected 500 English word pairs from a

wide range of domains (Section 2.1.1), (2) through
translation of these pairs, we obtained word pairs
for the other four languages (Section 2.1.2) and,
(3) all word pairs of each dataset were manually
scored by multiple annotators (Section 2.1.3).

2.1.1 English dataset creation
Seed set selection. The dataset creation started
with the selection of 500 English words. One of
the main objectives of the task was to provide an
evaluation framework that contains named enti-
ties and multiword expressions and covers a wide
range of domains. To achieve this, we considered
the 34 different domains available in BabelDo-
mains1 (Camacho-Collados and Navigli, 2017),
which in the main correspond to the domains of
the Wikipedia featured articles page2. Table 1
shows the list of all the 34 domains used for the
creation of the datasets. From each domain, 12
words were sampled in such a way as to have at
least one multiword expression and two named en-
tities. In order to include words that may not be-
long to any of the pre-defined domains, we added
92 extra words whose domain was not decided
beforehand. We also tried to sample these seed
words in such a way as to have a balanced set
across occurrence frequency.3 Of the 500 English
seed words, 84 (17%) and 83 were, respectively,
named entities and multiwords.

Similarity scale. For the annotation of the
datasets, we adopted the five-point Likert scale of
the SemEval-2014 task on Cross-Level Semantic

lation during the dataset construction.

4 Very similar The two words are synonyms (e.g., midday-noon or motherboard-mainboard).

3 Similar The two words share many of the important ideas of their meaning but include slightly different details.
They refer to similar but not identical concepts (e.g., lion-zebra or firefighter-policeman).

2 Slightly similar The two words do not have a very similar meaning, but share a common topic/domain/function and ideas
or concepts that are related (e.g., house-window or airplane-pilot).

1 Dissimilar The two words describe clearly dissimilar concepts, but may share some small details, a far relationship
or a domain in common and might be likely to be found together in a longer document on the same topic
(e.g., software-keyboard or driver-suspension).

0 Totally dissimilar
and unrelated

The two words do not mean the same thing and are not on the same topic (e.g., pencil-frog or PlayStation-
monarchy).

Similarity (Jurgens et al., 2014) which was de-
signed to systematically order a broad range of
semantic relations: synonymy, similarity, related-
ness, topical association, and unrelatedness. Table
2 describes the five points in the similarity scale
along with example word pairs.

Pairing word selection. Having the initial 500-
word seed set at hand, we selected a pair for each
word. The selection was carried out in such a
way as to ensure a uniform distribution of pairs
across the similarity scale. In order to do this, we
first assigned a random intended similarity to each
pair. The annotator then had to pick the second
word so as to match the intended score. In order
to allow the annotator to have a broader range of
candidate words, the intended score was consid-
ered as a similarity interval, one of [0-1], [1-2],
[2-3] and [3,4]. For instance, if the first word was
helicopter and the presumed similarity was [3-4],
the annotator had to pick a pairing word which
was “semantically similar” (see Table 2) to heli-
copter, e.g., plane. Of the 500 pairing words, 45
(9%) and 71 (14%) were named entities and mul-
tiwords, respectively. This resulted in an English
dataset comprising 500 word pairs, 105 (21%) and
112 (22%) of which have at least one named entity
and multiword, respectively.

2.1.2 Dataset translation

The remaining four multilingual datasets (i.e.,
Farsi, German, Italian, and Spanish) were con-
structed by translating words in the English dataset
to the target language. We had two goals in
mind while selecting translation as the construc-
tion strategy of these datasets (as opposed to inde-
pendent word samplings per language): (1) to have
comparable datasets across languages in terms
of domain coverage, multiword and named en-

tity distribution4 and (2) to enable an automatic
construction of cross-lingual datasets (see Section
2.2).

Each English word pair was translated by two
independent annotators. In the case of disagree-
ment, a third annotator was asked to pick the pre-
ferred translation. While translating, the annota-
tors were shown the word pair along with their
initial similarity score, which was provided to help
them in selecting the correct translation for the in-
tended meanings of the words.

2.1.3 Scoring
The annotators were instructed to follow the
guidelines, with special emphasis on distinguish-
ing between similarity and relatedness. Further-
more, although the similarity scale was originally
designed as a Likert scale, annotators were given
flexibility to assign values between the defined
points in the scale (with a step size of 0.25), in-
dicating a blend of two relations. As a result of
this procedure, we obtained 500 word pairs for
each of the five languages. The pairs in each lan-
guage were shuffled and their initial scores were
discarded. Three annotators were then asked to
assign a similarity score to each pair according to
our similarity scale (see Section 2.1.1).

Table 3 (first row) reports the average pairwise
Pearson correlation among the three annotators for
each of the five languages. Given the fact that our
word pairs spanned a wide range of domains, and
that there was a possibility for annotators to mis-
understand some words, we devised a procedure
to check the quality of the annotations and to im-
prove the reliability of the similarity scores. To
this end, for each dataset and for each annotator

4Apart from the German dataset in which the proportion
of multiwords significantly reduces (from 22% of English to
around 11%) due to the compounding nature of the German
language, other datasets maintain similar proportions of mul-
tiwords to those of the English dataset.

we picked the subset of pairs for which the dif-
ference between the assigned similarity score and
the average of the other two annotations was more
than 1.0, according to our similarity scale. The
annotator was then asked to revise this subset per-
forming a more careful investigation of the possi-
ble meanings of the word pairs contained therein,
and change the score if necessary. This procedure
resulted in considerable improvements in the con-
sistency of the scores. The second row in Table
3 (“Revised scores”) shows the average pairwise
Pearson correlation among the three revised sets
of scores for each of the five languages. The inter-
annotator agreement for all the datasets is consis-
tently in the 0.9 ballpark, which demonstrates the
high quality of our multilingual datasets thanks to
careful annotation of word pairs by experts.

2.2 Cross-lingual datasets

The cross-lingual datasets were automatically cre-
ated on the basis of the translations obtained with
the method described in Section 2.1.2 and using
the approach of Camacho-Collados et al. (2015).5

two languages (e.g., mind-brain in English and
mente-cerebro in Spanish), the approach creates
two cross-lingual pairs between the two languages
(mind-cerebro and brain-mente in the example).
The similarity scores for the constructed cross-
lingual pairs are computed as the average of
the corresponding language-specific scores in the
monolingual datasets. In order to avoid seman-
tic shifts between languages interfering in the pro-
cess, these pairs are only created if the differ-
ence between the corresponding language-specific
scores is lower than 1.0. The full details of the al-
gorithm can be found in Camacho-Collados et al.
(2015). The approach has been validated by hu-
man judges and shown to achieve agreements of
around 0.90 with human judges, which is similar
to inter-annotator agreements reported in Section
2.1.3. See Table 4 for some sample pairs in all
monolingual and cross-lingual datasets. Table 5
shows the final number of pairs for each language
pair.

3 Evaluation

We carried out the evaluation on the datasets de-
scribed in the previous section. The experimental
setting is described in Section 3.1 and the results
are presented in Section 3.2.

3.1 Experimental setting

3.1.1 Evaluation measures and official scores
Participating systems were evaluated according to
standard Pearson and Spearman correlation mea-

19



sures on all word similarity datasets, with the fi-
nal official score being calculated as the harmonic
mean of Pearson and Spearman correlations (Jur-
gens et al., 2014). Systems were allowed to partic-
ipate in either multilingual word similarity, cross-
lingual word similarity, or both. Each participat-
ing system was allowed to submit a maximum of
two runs.

For the multilingual word similarity subtask,
some systems were multilingual (applicable to dif-
ferent languages), whereas others were monolin-
gual (only applicable to a single language). While
monolingual approaches were evaluated in their
respective languages, multilingual and language-
independent approaches were additionally given a
global ranking provided that they tested their sys-
tems on at least four languages. The final score of
a system was calculated as the average harmonic
mean of Pearson and Spearman correlations of the
four languages on which it performed best.

Likewise, the participating systems of the cross-
lingual semantic similarity subtask were allowed
to provide a score for a single cross-lingual
dataset, but must have provided results for at least
six cross-lingual word similarity datasets in order
to be considered for the final ranking. For each
system, the global score was computed as the aver-
age harmonic mean of Pearson and Spearman cor-
relation on the six cross-lingual datasets on which
it provided the best performance.

3.1.2 Shared training corpus
We encouraged the participants to use a shared text
corpus for the training of their systems. The use
of the shared corpus was intended to mitigate the
influence that the underlying training corpus might
have upon the quality of obtained representations,
laying a common ground for a fair comparison of
the systems.

• Subtask 1. The common corpus for subtask
1 was the Wikipedia corpus of the target lan-
guage. Specifically, systems made use of the
Wikipedia dumps released by Al-Rfou et al.
(2013).6

• Subtask 2. The common corpus for subtask
2 was the Europarl parallel corpus7. This
corpus is available for all languages except

projects/polyglot

7http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/Europarl.
php

Farsi. For pairs involving Farsi, participants
were allowed to use the OpenSubtitles2016
parallel corpora8. Additionally, we proposed
a second type of multilingual corpus to al-
low the use of different techniques exploiting
comparable corpora. To this end, some par-
ticipants made use of Wikipedia.

3.1.3 Participating systems
This task was targeted at evaluating multilingual
and cross-lingual word similarity measurement
techniques. However, it was not only limited to
this area of research, as other fields such as se-
mantic representation consider word similarity as
one of their most direct benchmarks for evalua-
tion. All kinds of semantic representation tech-
niques and semantic similarity systems were en-
couraged to participate.

In the end we received a wide variety of par-
ticipants: proposing distributional semantic mod-
els learnt directly from raw corpora, using syn-
tactic features, exploiting knowledge from lexi-
cal resources, and hybrid approaches combining
corpus-based and knowledge-based clues. Due to
lack of space we cannot describe all the systems in
detail, but we recommend the reader to refer to the
system description papers for more information
about the individual systems: HCCL (He et al.,
2017), Citius (Gamallo, 2017), jmp8 (Melka and
Bernard, 2017), l2f (Fialho et al., 2017), QLUT

et al., 2017), SEW (Delli Bovi and Raganato,
2017) and Wild Devs (Rotari et al., 2017), and
OoO.

3.1.4 Baseline
As the baseline system we included the results of
the concept and entity embeddings of NASARI
(Camacho-Collados et al., 2016). These em-
beddings were obtained by exploiting knowledge
from Wikipedia and WordNet coupled with gen-
eral domain corpus-based Word2Vec embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013). We performed the eval-
uation with the 300-dimensional English embed-
ded vectors (version 3.0)9 and used them for
all languages. For the comparison within and

across languages NASARI relies on the lexicaliza-
tions provided by BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2012) for the concepts and entities in each lan-
guage. Then, the final score was computed
through the conventional closest senses strategy
(Resnik, 1995; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), using
cosine similarity as the comparison measure.

proved essential given the amount of rare words

scores for all pairs in the datasets, with OOV rates
close to 10% in some cases.

cross-lingual word similarity datasets (subtask 2).

Luminoso. In fact, most top performing systems
combined these two sources of information. For
Farsi, the best performing system was Mahtab,
which couples information from Word2Vec word
embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) and knowledge
resources, in this case FarsNet (Shamsfard et al.,
2010) and BabelNet. For English, the only system
that came close to Luminoso was QLUT, which
was the best-performing system that made use
of the shared Wikipedia corpus for training.
The best configuration of this system exploits
the Skip-Gram model of Word2Vec with an
additive compositional function for computing
the similarity of multiwords. However, Mahtab
and QLUT only performed their experiments in a
single language (Farsi and English, respectively).

For the systems that performed experiments in
at least four of the five languages we computed
a global score (see Section 3.1.1). Global rank-

ings and results are displayed in Table 7. Lumi-
noso clearly achieves the best overall results. The
second-best performing system was HCCL, which
also managed to outperform the baseline. HCCL
exploited the Skip-Gram model of Word2Vec
and performed hyperparameter tuning on existing
word similarity datasets. This system did not make
use of external resources apart from the shared
Wikipedia corpus for training. RUFINO, which
also made use of the Wikipedia corpus only, at-
tained the third overall position. The system ex-
ploits PMI and an association measure to capture
second-order relations between words based on
the Jaccard distance (Jimenez et al., 2016).

Wikipedia are marked with †. Luminoso, the best-
performing system in Subtask 1, also achieved
the best overall results on the ten cross-lingual
datasets. This shows that the combination of
knowledge from word embeddings and the Con-
ceptNet graph is equally effective in the cross-
lingual setting.

The global ranking for this subtask was com-
puted by averaging the results of the six datasets
on which each system performed best. The global
rankings are displayed in Table 9. Luminoso
was the only system outperforming the baseline,
achieving the best overall results. OoO achieved
the second best overall performance using an
extension of the Bilingual Bag-of-Words with-
out Alignments (BilBOWA) approach of Gouws
et al. (2015) on the shared Europarl corpus. The
third overall system was SEW, which leveraged
Wikipedia-based concept vectors (Raganato et al.,
2016) and pre-trained word embeddings for learn-
ing language-independent concept embeddings.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented the SemEval 2017
task on Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic
Word Similarity. We provided a reliable frame-
work to measure the similarity between nomi-
nal instances within and across five different lan-
guages (English, Farsi, German, Italian, and Span-
ish). We hope this framework will contribute
to the development of distributional semantics in
general and for languages other than English in
particular, with a special emphasis on multilin-

gual and cross-lingual approaches. All evaluation
datasets are available for download at http://
alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task2/.

The best overall system in both tasks was Lu-
minoso, which is a hybrid system that effectively
integrates word embeddings and information from
knowledge resources. In general, this combina-
tion proved effective in this task, as most other top
systems somehow combined knowledge from text
corpora and lexical resources.
