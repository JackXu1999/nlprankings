ABSTRACT
Traditional sentiment analysis has been focusing on inference of the sentiment polarity using
sentiment-bearing words. In this paper, we propose a new way of studying sentiment and
capturing ontological changes in a domain specific context in the perspective of computational
linguistics using affect proxies. We used Nexis service to create a domain specific corpus focusing
on banking sectors. We then created an affect dictionary from three kinds of lexica: sentiment
lexica as in the General Inquirer dictionary; news flow represented by domain entities such as
financial regulators and banks; and what we call contested term lexica, which consists of terms
whose semantic implication is inconsistent over time. Univariate and multivariate analysis
techniques such as factor analysis are used to explore the relationships and underlying patterns
among the three types of lexica. Analysis results suggest that citations of regulatory entities
show strong correlation with negative sentiments in the banking context. Also, a factor analysis
was conducted, which reveals several groups of variables in which the contested terms correlate
with positive and negative sentiments.

KEYWORDS: sentiment analysis, affect proxy, computational linguistics, factor analysis, con-
tested terms, ontological change.

1 An Introduction and the Case Study

In rapidly changing environments, for example the aftermath of the 2008 credit crunch, we
saw the advent of US and EU economic and financial stabilization schemes, changes in the
regulatory frameworks include major revisions of existing concepts (e.g. capital adequacy),
introduction of new concepts (e.g. novel regulatory pathways), and constraints on existing
concepts/practices (e.g. sub-prime loans). These changes are articulated in new or revised
governmental legislation and voluntary codes of practice over a period of time – there are
commentaries and interpretation of these changes. All these organisations produce prodigious
quantities of documents on a daily or even hourly basis and broadcast the documents using
data feeds and social media; there is a concomitant flow of new and revised keywords from the
compliance and regulatory agencies.

The post credit squeeze language of the regulators and that of the regulated is suffused with
negative affect – indeed the terms credit squeeze, credit freeze, zombie loans/banks are used to
express the negative evaluation of the state of leading economies and their financial institutions.
Times of change invariably involve the introduction of new terms, or more importantly old
terms are retrofitted with new meanings or nuances. Indeed, the early pioneers of sentiment
analysis, discussed the changing language of “American values” by an analysis of changes in the
language of the two major political parties in the USA – the Democratic and the Republican
parties (Namenwirth and Lasswell, 1970). The authors argue that the anti-slavery party (the
Republicans) became less inclusive (compared to the Democrats). This claim was based on an
analysis of “inclusivity” words in the election manifestos of the two parties between 1844-1864
and 1944-1964, the authors had used the General Inquirer system and the associated lexica
(Stone, 1966). This text analytic approach suggests that major changes in the attitudes within a
community can perhaps be discerned by examining the choice of words belonging to domain
terms (political and economic) and the affect terms (negative/positive evaluation, strength and
orientation). The question we ask in this paper is this: Are the changes in attitudes related to
changes in the ontological commitments of the community (e.g. from pro-slavery to anti-slavery,
from pro-federation to autonomous units in (Namenwirth and Lasswell, 1970)?.

Revert to the 2008 financial crisis: prior to the crisis, there was a vocal body of opinion that
was in favour of light-touch regulation, and compliance and governance issues were expected to
be dealt with within financial institutions. Things have changed considerably since 2008 what
with the ever complex national and international compliance frameworks, direct governmental
management of financial institutions, and a resurgence of regulators.

One iconic term which hallmarks the 2008 crisis is light-touch regulation: In the decade before
the crisis, the banks, the regulators, and indeed the media and governments, wished for and
implemented minimal (state) regulations, self-governance, and low-level of compliance, for
the financial services industry. Things have changed after the decade and light touch regulation
will be giving way to abundant regulation! A survey of associated sentiment with light touch
regulation using Google search engine and selecting one of first 10 most relevant documents for
the term sampled every two years from 2002 shows the contested nature of the headword –
regulation. Furthermore, the affect terms associated with light touch regulation for sentiment
evaluation changed polarity – from negative to positive (Table 1).

A large number of US government agencies and professional bodies, around 12 at the last
count, are involved in (a) monitoring financial institutions for compliance with existing laws
and codes of practice; (b) producing regulations and regulatory frameworks; and (c) examining

the governance of financial institutions. In itself, the involvement of agencies in (a)-(c), appears
a normal, routine matter in that business-critical institutions should by default comply with
laws, have good regulatory framework, and demonstrate exemplary governance. The fact
that concepts related to compliance, governance and regulation are still being contested in the
media is an interesting manifestation of regulatory change from light-touch regulation and/or
self-regulation to something else, e.g. smart regulation. The evidence of this continuing debate
can be perhaps seen in news reports relating to the key financial institutions – the banks and its
regulators.

It appears that a major shift in (inter-)national policies regarding an area of human enterprise,
that is a major change in the ontological basis of the enterprise, is accompanied by changes in
the use of domain specific terms including named entities in the domain, changes in evaluation
of the domain specific terms through a change in associated affect terms, and changes in what
we call contested terms. Contested terms generally include terms related to the basic operation
of an enterprise. For instance, banks to have to comply with existing law, banks should have
transparent governance structures, and banks have to be regulated well. But the question is to
what extent and by whom: lightly by the banks themselves or strictly by the regulators.

It is important to note that affect can be expressed at three different levels pragmatic description:
First, the number of news stories in a fixed interval of time can be used as a measure of affect
evaluation – the so-called news flow is an important affect proxy. Second, the changes in the
distribution of the contested terms can also be used as a proxy for changes in affect or sentiment.
And, third, the distribution of the domain independent affect terms, if computed accurately and
with appropriate degree of disambiguation, can be used as a more direct measure of sentiment.

All three measures of affect or sentiment, news flow and the distribution of the contested and
evaluation (positive/negative affect) terms closely follow the boom and bust within the world
economic system.

Sentiment analysis is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving computer scientist, linguists,
literature experts, cognitive psychologist and domain experts. One can argue that sentiment

analysis encompasses computational linguistics and has psychologists and domain experts
additionally. In this paper, we look at the analysis of sentiment by looking at dictionaries
compiled by psychologists and linguists. We begin by describing the design and implementation
of our corpus (c. 12 million words) and a specially designed lexica for dealing with affect and
affect proxies in Section 2. This is followed by a description of the method we used. The results
section comprises the results of univariate and multivariate analysis reported in Section 4 and
then we conclude.

2 Design of the Corpus and Affect Lexica

2.1 Corpus Design

Our analysis is targeted on a corpus comprising news articles related to 30 major banks around
the world as shown in Table 2. We have used the Nexis database of news and related documents
to collect the bank-related news over an 11 year period (2001-2011); our choice of this news
source was motivated by the availability of rich meta-level information that is used to annotate,
and subsequently retrieve each news document in Nexis. Our data set contains 22 sub-corpora
each comprising six months of news. For each of the six month period, a query is issued to
search the articles using the bank names as keywords over a pre-defined set of sources called
"Major World Newspapers (English)" within Nexis: the top 1000 most relevant articles returned
by the search are retained. We did not restrict our search to a particular news paper because
we believe the overall prospect of the banking sector might be better captured in a global
perspective. Our use of the relevance metric provided by Nexis was motivated by the thought
that the sampling process should remain consistent and largely free of any biases or framing
during manual selection of media sources 1.

The meta-level information was extracted automatically from raw text downloaded from Nexis
data base 2. The information can be used to extract the date of publication and news source.
The publication dates come with the documents allow us to aggregate the daily news stories
into lower frequency data – weekly, monthly or yearly. The news source information help us
to use all news from all sources or to dis-aggregate the news according to sources. The time
period aggregation and news source dis-aggregation can help capture the effect of time scale or
the news source.

1The duplication-removal option in Nexis was used, the actual amount of articles obtained per search is usually less
than 1000, but as the occurrences of duplication can be regarded as random events, we believe the corpus created this
way is consistent and representative.

2The raw documents downloaded are unstructured and a Java program was written to extract the meta-data
annotation from the text, which contain the date on which the news was published as well as the source of the news.

Table 3: Yearly breakdown of the corpus

For the 30 banks, Nexis yielded 20129 relevant articles over the 10 year period, which enabled
us to build a specialist corpus of 12.5 million words with a mean number of 1830 documents
per year and an average length of 623 tokens (Table 3).

2.2 Lexica Design

Three lexica were used in our analysis:

2.2.1 Domain Lexica: The Financial Regulator / Banking Dictionary

The motivation behind the creation of this dictionary is the assumption that frequent mentions
of financial regulators might imply the existence of inadequacy in regulatory enforcement,
making the announcement of such agencies a proxy to negative sentiments. The dictionary
contains 4 categories: US Regulators, UK Regulators, and Eurozone Regulators, with the fourth
category containing a list of prominent banks, as nominated in (Forbes, 2011).

2.2.2 Affect Lexica: Harvard Dictionary of Affect

Harold Lasswell (Lasswell, 1948) has used sentiment to convey the idea of an attitude permeated
by feeling rather than the undirected feeling itself. Such analyses of documents in the political
and economic domain were boosted by the use large digitized dictionaries, notably the GI
Dictionary also known as the Harvard Dictionary of Affect which formed the backbone for the
General Inquirer system (Stone, 1966). The GI Dictionary currently comprises over 11,000
words. Each word in the Dictionary has one or more “tags”. Some of these tags refer to the
connotative meaning of the word, whilst others to its cognitive orientation, and some to the
belongingness of the word to a specific domain. The words in the Dictionary have between one
and 12 of the 128 “tags”. These tags are divided into 28 or so categories.

The original, and linguistically rather dated Harvard Dictionary of Affect, has been used in our
analysis purely for the evaluation affect words – negative and positive. Note that the Harvard
Dictionary has affect tags associated with domain specific terms which can be misleading when
an affect count is carried out. For example, Harvard has the word competition tagged as negative
evaluation word, and the words share and company as positive evaluation words. This may

Table 4: Semantic identity and opposition of the contested term regulation

have been true in everyday language of the 1940’s and 50’s (the times when the Dictionary
was compiled), but today these words are used as keywords in the domains of economic and
finance.

The system used in our analysis has been so designed that when a token from a given document
is analyzed for its belongingness to affect categories, and if the token is found in a domain
specific dictionary then the system ignores the affect category.

2.2.3 Contested Term Lexica

The contested terms lexica are a hybrid of domain specific terms and words in an affect lexicon.
We use three ontological primitives – compliance, governance and regulation and populate the
hybrid lexicon with synonyms and antonyms of each of the three primitives. The hypothesis
we wish to test is the identity terms, especially synonyms of a given ontological primitive will
reinforce messages related to the unit whilst the opposition terms, especially antonyms, will
create a negative empr? of the primitive.

This population process can be accomplished by traversing a general thesaurus or a thesaurus
similar to WordNet “intelligently” and to scrape data from synonymous and antonymous rela-
tionships between synsets as demonstrated in a variant of WordNet – SentiWordNet (Baccianella
et al., 2010). For our study, we use a general language thesaurus that is freely available on-line
at this time3.

The dictionary is populated using an expansion algorithm, which starts with the three keywords,
governance, regulation and compliance. The algorithm then iteratively populates the dictionary
by assigning direct as well as indirect synonyms and antonyms of the three seed words to
appropriate. An example expansion from the seed word “regulation” is shown in Table 4. The
table demonstrates how the affect category regulation identity and regulation opposition are
populated using synonyms and antonyms of the seed word regulation. A synonym of a word is
considered to have the same affect evaluation as the word while an antonym of a word has the
opposite affect evaluation. This rule is also applied iteratively to synonyms and antonyms of
the seed word as well.

2.2.4 Merging Strategy

The above three dictionaries are merged together to form a single affect dictionary to be used
in the analysis. After the merge, the set of categories to which a word belongs is the union of

3The thesaurus used in our study is an on-line thesaurus at http://thesaurus.com. Synonyms and antonyms that are
shorter than four characters were excluded from the lexica to avoid common close-class words.

the original three sets of categories the word is associated with. A summary of the statistics of
the lexica is shown in Table 5.

3 Methodology

We employ a methodology similar to vector space model, where each document in the corpus is
represented by a vector of N dimensions. The difference lies in the semantics of the space – the
vectors measure affect strength rather than word frequency.

The merged dictionary created as described in Section 2.2 is used to transform documents to
vectors. The dictionary is essentially a many-to-many mapping between words and dictionary
categories, where each word in the dictionary is associated with one or more categories. The
documents in the corpus are then converted into vectors where each element in a vector
corresponds to the relative frequency of a specific affect category in that document.

The relative frequency of a category is computed as the sum of the absolute frequencies of
words belonging to the category over the total number of words in the document. Formally, the
strength of the category C in document D is given as Equation 1.

AffectStrength(C , D) =
Σd∈D |{w|w ∈ d ∧w ∈ C}|
Σd∈D |{w|w ∈ d}|

(1)

The next phase of the method is to aggregate the document vectors based on the time of
publication of the document. Vectors that associate with documents from the same time period
of interest are added together to form a single vector representing the affect characteristics of
the specific period. The result of this aggregation is a multivariate time series. For our analysis,
the documents are grouped into a monthly scale.

4 Analysis and Results

4.1 Univariate Analysis

4.1.1 News Flow

In text analytics in general, and in sentiment analysis in particular, news flow, typically number
of relevant articles published in a given time interval, is used as a sentiment or affect proxy –
see for instance Kim and Barnett’s work in international marketing (Kim and Barnett, 1996),
Cain’s in political science (Cain, 2012), and Hafez and Xie’s in finance (Hafez and Xie, 2012). A
study of the aggregated monthly news flow in our corpus shows that the coverage of banks in
news media during the three periods (c. 2001, 2002-2005, 2006-2011) is different: below the
mean news flow in the boom period and above the mean during crises.

105



Figure 1: Annual frequency of total number of tokens and two named entities,
banks and regulators, relative to 2001. (2001 frequencies – Ntokens = 1157837,
Nbanks = 11326, Nregulators = 593)

Three points to note here: (1) that following the dotcom boom (c. 2001) and until the first
signs of the credit crunch (c. 2007), the yearly average word count, 500 tokens/news story, was
much lower when compared with the pre-dotcom period, c. 600 tokens/news story, and the
post boom period (c. 700 tokens/news story 2008 – to date); 2) there was a significant increase
on the average length of articles talking about banks starting from 2005 and again another
boost around 2009. The increase in the average length of the article pertinent to banks might
be a result of the shift of public attentions towards banking sector during the financial crisis. A
further Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for unit root shows that the series is non-stationary, which
implies such shift must be structural rather than by chance.

The average frequency of the domain primitives, banks and regulators, i.e. the use of the
names of banks and the regulators, in our 12.5 million word corpus, is 1.25% and 0.06%
respectively. The annual distribution of the total number of tokens in our corpus is similar
to that of the frequency of use of bank related tokens – higher in bust periods and lower in
the boom periods (Figure 1); this is not surprising in that the corpus was created using the
names and abbreviations of banks listed in Table 2. However the asymmetry in the distribution
of bank related tokens and regulator related tokens is interesting in the sense that regulator
related terms showed a drop in pre-2005 period but then there is an almost linear increase in
the citations of regulators. Overall there is a 2.61% per annum increase in the regulator-related
tokens whereas that of banks is 1%; these increment figures were computed using the historical
return of the frequencies (logarithm of the ratio of this year’s frequency of usage over last
year’s).

4.1.2 Contested Term Flow

The average annual frequency of the tokens related to the contested terms, compliance, gov-
ernance and regulation, is 0.12%, 0.71% and 0.23% respectively in our 12.5m token banking
corpora. The peak usage of three terms was in 2004 (compliance), 2006 (governance) and 2008

106



Figure 2: Annual frequency of total number of tokens and two named entities,
banks and regulators, relative to 2001. (2001 frequencies – Ntokens = 1157837,
Nbanks = 11326, Nregulators = 593)

(regulation). The maximum usage of the three terms is within two standard deviation of the
mean for each of three contested terms over the 10 years (2001-2011), showing a degree of
stability of usage and perhaps our choice of the term and their synonyms and antonyms.

However, the distribution of the tokens related to synonyms and antonyms of the each of the
contested terms is asymmetric, with synonyms being more widely used than the antonyms in
each year of our observation. One can see the same effect in the language of general purposes:
we have looked at the very broad coverage Google search engine and the more restricted
American National Corpus (comprising 450 million words used in newspapers, fiction and other
texts published during 1990-2012) and found a similar asymmetry in the distribution of a token
and its antonyms.

What is interesting is the change in the asymmetry ratio over time: The average asymmetry for
the compliance-related synonyms and antonyms is 58%, however, the maximum is around 70%
(in 2002 and 2008) with a minimum of 40% in 2006. The ratio for the other two contested
terms, governance and regulation is around 10% for every synonym used 10 times the antonym
is used only once. The ratio again changes over our observation period (2001-2011) with a
peak (18%) in 2002 (and minimum of 8% in 2012) for regulation. The asymmetry ratio for
governance has a peak (13%) in 2010 (and a minimum of around 6% in 2005). The term
compliance appears to be more contested than the other two (Figure 2).

4.1.3 Sentiment Flow

Typically, in financial studies, the negative sentiment has been found to be the causal variable
that impacts the return on investment: Tetlock and colleagues have looked at a restricted set
of tokens associated with negative affect and found a correlation between the variance in the
frequency of such tokens and risk on the return. The author has argued that “high values of
media pessimism induce downward pressure on market prices” (Tetlock, 2007): by media he
means a financial gossip column in the Wall Street Journal and market “prices” refers to the
logarithmic return of the daily values Dow-Jones Industrial Average Index. Elsewhere, we have

107



noted that the historical volatility (proxied as standard deviation) of a negative affect time
series (Devitt and Ahmad, 2008).

We have looked at the annual frequency distribution of the negative and positive affect tokens
in our corpus, together with the logarithmic value of the ratio of the frequency of the current
year and the previous year – usually called return. The asymmetry of the average value of
the relative frequency, over the 10 years of our coverage, for negative and positive affect is
2:3, the values over the 10 year period for both affect series is within two standard deviation
of the mean. However, the average value of return is 0.1% for negative affect but -0.02% for
the positive affect: the volatility for negative affect is 5% whereas for positive affect 2% only.
The differences are even starker when we divide the series of affect values in “boom” years
(2002-2006) and “bust” period (2007-2011). The negative affect decreases overall in the boom
period and vice-versa for the positive affect; contrariwise is the case for the bust period. The
volatility of negative sentiment is much higher in the bust period.

4.2 Multivariate Analysis

The variables we have discussed thus far in the context of changing nature of(world-wide)
financial systems dealt with three inter-related categories of tokens: domain specific tokens,
contested tokens, and affect tokens. We have chosen to study not only the tokens but have
constructed a polar space where we have (a) banks and their regulators; and (b) not only
we have looked at contested issues, compliance, governance and regulations, but also at the
identities and opposites of these tokens. In this section we will look briefly at the correlation
between the distribution of the terms and attempt to identify combinations of these categories
account for the variance of frequency distribution of tokens within the categories.

4.2.1 Correlation Analysis

We have looked at the correlations between the three categories of tokens and correlations
across the categories. Correlations at 99% significance level appear between (a) negative
affect tokens and (synonyms of ) regulators, the correlation is positive, and (synonyms) of
compliance anti-correlate with negative affect; positive affect tokens correlate with (synonyms
of) governance and 90% significance level with the identities of compliance and regulation;
(b) the frequency distribution of regulators is correlated with compliance; (c) the identity
and opposites of compliance are positively correlated as are those of governance; the latter is
correlated with the synonyms of regulation. (See Table 6 for details).

4.2.2 Factor Analysis

Pair-wise correlations in some cases help to identify relationships between two variables.
However, the method makes it somehow difficult for human to gain insight into data, especially
in terms of relationships between groups of variables. To obtain a better understanding of the
overall picture between the variables, we performed a factor analysis on the data to explore
latent patterns that may dictate the observed behaviors of the affect categories4. Factor analysis
was initially developed in the discipline of psychology as a statistical approach to explain
correlated variables using reduced number of “factors”. In our study, we are mainly interested
in its capability of grouping variables so that they can be better understood.

4The principal component analysis and factor analysis was done using Minitab 16.

Table 7: Factor loadings from factor analysis

Firstly, a principal component analysis was carried in an attempt to determine the number of
factors that would appear in the factor analysis. The result indicates that the first five factors
combined explain 69 % of the variances, while the contribution of including the sixth factor
is negligible. The factor analysis was then carried out using 5 factors on 10 variables: two
variables each for both affect and the domain categories and two for each of the three contested
token categories. The resulting factor loadings are rotated using Varimax Rotation for better
interpretability. A total of 69% of the variances are explained by a combination of five factors
as expected from the previous principal component anlaysis. The variables are explained fairly
well, with seven of them having more than 65% of their variances explained by the factors
(Table 7).

We then tried to interpret the factors by labelling them with semantic descriptions.

Compliance Factor compliance+5, compliance-, Negativ and Regulators all have strong loadings
on Factor 1, where compliance topics load to the opposite of Negative sentiment and
regulator references. This conforms to what we observed in the correlation matrix in the
previous section, where Negativ positively correlates with regulators and the compliance
terms negatively correlates with Negativ as well as references to regulators. We suggest
that this factor to be labeled as “Compliance Factor”.

Positive Factor regulation+, governance+ and Positiv, as we can see from the factor loading
table, load heavily on Factor 2. Considering the supporting nature of the regulation+ and
governance+ variables, we believe it makes sense to label Factor 2 as “Positive Factor”.

Regulation Factor Factor 3 loads heavily on regulation, regulation- together with compliance-,
and to the opposite of Positiv category. This could suggest that Factor 3 is related to the
concept of regulation and compliance, while the concept generally occurs in a non-positive
context. Therefore we suggest that Factor 3 be labeled as “Regulation Factor”.

5compliance+ denotes the identity concepts of compliance while compliance- denotes the opposition concepts of
compliance. The same notion is applied to governance and governance to keep things concise.

Table 8: Variable clusters

Governance Factor The category of governance+ predominates Factor 4. The governance-
category, however, loads to the opposite of governance+. This suggests that the discussions
of governance are polarized – the contexts where governance are mentioned are either
supportive or non-supportive of the governance concept. Therefore, we suggest that the
Factor 4 be labeled as “Governance Factor”.

Bank Factor Factor 5 is almost entirely dedicated to the citations to banks, hence we named it
“Bank Factor”.

Figure 3 shows the plot of the variables against the top two factors that explained the variances
most, giving an intuitive representation of the distribution of the loadings. It can be seen fairly
easily that the variables form three clusters. Following this intuition, we conducted a further
analysis in which the variables are clustered according to their correlations6. Five clusters are
identified and reported in Table 8.

It is worth noting that factor analysis only reveals correlations rather than casual relationships
between the variables. In our case, the factors could be interpreted in two different ways. First,
it could be argued that the sentiment variables are the “consequences” while the domain ones

are the “causes”. For instance, in Factor 1, it might be reasonable to say that the contexts in
which the regulators were cited are mostly negative in sentiment. This interpretation conforms
with the conventional expectation from sentiment analyses, where we learn about the polarity
of opinions with regard to certain topics. The second perspective of seeing the factors are to
think the domain and contested variables as “proxies” or “indicators” of sentiment. Again, for
Factor 1, it may be inferred that excessive citations of financial regulators indicates there is
something “wrong” with the banking sector (thus negative).

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a hypothesis that the usages of domain entities (financial regulators
and banks) and contested terms (terms relating to concepts that had bear much debate) could
serve as proxies of ontological shifts in the general sentiment of the news in financial sectors.

We use a bag-of-words method for analyzing texts for computing the affect content. A univariate
analysis of the distribution of three different types of terms in a large corpus of news about banks
shows that the general level of negativity in the news about banks has increased. A multivariate
analysis, based on correlation and factor decomposition, shows references to regulatory bodies
strongly associated with negative affect, forming a heavily loaded factor in the analysis. We
believe this might be strong evidence supporting our argument that those terms other than
pure sentiment bearing words, for example, news flow and contested terms could possibly
serve as proxies to sentiments in domain context. This, perhaps, is due to the fact that frequent
discussions about a domain concept such as regulators or fierce debate over a contested term
might imply the absence of such concept, which, in our case, is the regulation of the financial
institutions. We have identified several other factors which could provide further insight to the
relationships between contested terms and sentiments: a “positive” factor which also loads with
pro-governance and pro-regulation terms; an anti-compliance and anti-regulation factor that
has opposite loadings on positivity; an anti-governance factor, and a bank factor. Interpretation
of the factors were attempted.

Our future work would focus on the refinement of contested term lexicon as well as exploring
techniques from time series analysis to model the changes of news flow, contested terms and
sentiments, which would help capturing the dynamics of the system better. We also plan to
leverage lexical information more in the future to enhance the accuracy of analysis.
