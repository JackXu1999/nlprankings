Abstract

Several recent studies have shown that textual
information of user posts and user behaviors
such as liking and sharing the specific posts
are useful for predicting the personality of so-
cial media users. However, less attention has
been paid to the textual information derived
from the user behaviors. In this paper, we in-
vestigate the effect of textual information on
user behaviors for personality prediction. Our
experiments on the personality prediction of
Twitter users show that the textual information
of user behaviors is more useful than the co-
occurrence information of the user behaviors.
They also show that taking user behaviors into
account is crucial for predicting the personal-
ity of users who do not post frequently.

1 Introduction

Personality information of social media users can
be used for various situations such as analyzing
crowd behaviors (Guy et al., 2011) and building
recommender systems (Wu et al., 2013). Many re-
searchers have focused on developing techniques
for predicting personalities and reported that mod-
els that use the textual information of target
user’s posts achieved relatively high performance
(Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008; Iacobelli et al.,
2011; Liu et al., 2017; Arnoux et al., 2017). How-
ever, some social media users frequently read oth-
ers’ posts but rarely post their own messages. Pre-
dicting the personalities of such users is generally
difficult, but a substantial portion of them often
express their opinion or preference through social
media activities such as liking and sharing.

Figure 1 shows tweet examples related to Hal-
loween. The upper tweet was posted by a user
who is hosting a Halloween party and thus this
user is considered to be extraverted. In contrast,
the lower tweet is a post consisting of Halloween
illustrations, which is considered to be posted by

a Halloween party and the lower tweet is about Hal-
loween illustrations.

an introverted user. In this way, user personalities
can be predicted from their posts. Moreover, users
who like or share such tweets are expected to have
a similar personality to the user who posted the
tweet. Henceforth, we collectively refer to likes
and shares as behaviors.

Several studies have leveraged the information
derived from the user behaviors for personality
prediction (Azucar et al., 2018). For example,
Kosinski et al. (2013) and Youyou et al. (2015)
proposed personality prediction models for Face-
book users that leveraged a user-like matrix, the
entries of which were set to 1 if there existed an
association between a user and a like and 0 oth-
erwise. Shen et al. (2015) considered the types of
the posts (e.g., photos, videos, or status updates)
that a target user likes or shares. However, these
studies do not take into account the textual in-
formation related to user behaviors. We consider
that the textual information of tweets that target
users have liked/retweeted (shared) contains use-
ful information for predicting their personalities.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the effect
of the textual information of the tweets that target
users liked/retweeted.

2 Related Work

Many studies on personality prediction for social
media users utilize the textual information derived
from the user’s posts. Luyckx and Daelemans
(2008) extract syntactic features like part-of-
speech n-grams to predict personality of es-
say authors. Iacobelli et al. (2011) test differ-
ent extraction settings with stop words and in-
verse document frequency for predicting per-
sonality in a large corpus of blogs using sup-
port vector machines (SVM) as a classifier.
Liu et al. (2017) use Twitter user posts and pro-
pose a deep-learning-based model utilizing a
character-level bi-directional recurrent neural net-
work. Arnoux et al. (2017) build a personal-
ity prediction model for Twitter users that uti-
lizes word embedding with Gaussian processes
(Rasmussen and Williams, 2005). Reasonably
good performance can be achieved by taking only
25 tweets into consideration.

Several studies have shown that user behaviors
such as likes and shares are also useful to pre-
dict user personalities. Kosinski et al. (2013) and
Youyou et al. (2015) used page likes on Facebook
to create a user-like matrix and proposed personal-
ity prediction models based on the matrix. While
Kosinski et al. (2013) and Youyou et al. (2015)
only use the binary information related to user
behaviors, Shen et al. (2015) proposed a person-
ality prediction model that considers the number
of likes and shares. Farnadi et al. (2013) focus on
network properties such as network size, density,
and transitivity, and time factors such as the fre-
quency of status updates per day and the number
of tweets per hour in addition to user posts.

For tasks other than personality prediction,
several studies leverage the textual informa-
tion derived from user behaviors in social me-
dia. Ding et al. (2017) applied texts that users
liked and posted to predict substance users such
as people who drink alcohol. They showed
that the distributed bag-of-words (DBOW) mod-
els (Le and Mikolov, 2014) achieve good perfor-
mance. Perdana and Pinandito (2018) used texts
that users liked, shared, and posted for sentiment
analysis. They convert them into weighted fea-
tures using tf-idf and applied Naı̈ve Bayes. They
reported that texts posted by a user lead to a better
performance than texts that the user liked/shared,
but that the best performance can be realized by
combining them.

3 Dataset

In this study, we predict the personalities of
Twitter users. As the personality model, we
use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
(Myers et al., 1990), one of the most widely
used personality models, as well as the Big Five
(Goldberg, 1990).

3.1 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

The MBTI recognizes 16 personality types
spanned by four dimensions. Extraverted and
Introverted (E/I) describe the preference of ap-
proaching the outer world of people and things
vs. the inner world of ideas; iNtuition and Sensing
(N/S) describe the preference of the intuition and
the possibilities in the future vs. the perception
of things of the present moment; Thinking and
Feeling (T/F) describe the preference of rational
decision making based on logic vs. subjective val-
ues; and Judging and Perceiving (J/P) describe
the preference for the control of external events
vs. the observation of these events.

The MBTI is often identified through a person-
ality analysis test that consists of selective ques-
tions. Several Web sites offer such personality
analysis tests, such as 16Personalities1 is one of
such websites, where users can determine their
MBTI type by answering 60 questions. The re-
sults are represented by 16 roles, such as Mediator
for INFP and Executive for ESTJ—one for each
combination of the four MBTI dimensions (e.g., I,
N, F, and P). The Web site has a function that lets
users post their results to Twitter with the hashtag
#16Personalities. Figure 2 shows an example of
such tweets. In this example, the user is analyzed
to be “Protagonist”, which corresponds to ENFJ
in the MBTI. We collected the tweets that contain
the hashtag #16Personalities and use them in the
experiments.

3.2 Data Collection from Twitter

We collected tweets written in Japanese. Twit-
ter Premium search APIs2 were used to find the
tweets containing the hashtag #16personalities and
listed 72,847 users who posted such tweets in 2017
and 2018. We refer to a tweet with #16personali-
ties as the gold standard tweet. Next, we collected
the latest 3,200 tweets for each user and then dis-
carded the tweets that were posted after the gold
standard tweet. Only the users with 1,024 or more
tweets were used in this study. The number of
such users was 20,364. Table 1 lists the statis-
tics of users for each personality dimension. We
can confirm that there are biases in the number of
users for all dimensions and that the bias for the
E/I dimension is particularly noticeable.

To build a model based on the text related
to user behaviors such as like and retweet, we
collected up to 1,024 liked tweets and 1,024
retweeted tweets for each user. Table 2 shows
the distribution of users based on the number of
likes or retweets. 14,735 out of 20,364 users liked
more than 1,023 tweets and 157 users liked no
tweets. Only 3,137 users retweeted more than
1,023 tweets and 162 users retweeted no tweets.

4 Personality Prediction Models

We treat personality prediction as a set of binary
classification tasks and build four binary classifiers
independently for each dimension of the MBTI.
We regard the personality of the users shown in

the tweets with #16personalities as the gold stan-
dard personality and attempt to predict it using the
SVM classifier. Figure 3 shows an overview of
the model. Specifically, we use linear SVM for
classification with two types of features: those de-
rived from the tweets that the target user likes or
retweets and those derived from the tweets that the
target user posts.

4.1 Features derived from User Behaviors

Use of co-occurrence information We build a
model similar to Kosinski et al. (2013). They
leveraged a co-occurrence matrix of users and
likes, the entries of which were set to 1 if there ex-
isted an association between a user and a like and
0 otherwise. Similarly, we create the binary matrix
of users and behaviors, the entries of which were
set to 1 if the user liked/retweeted a tweet, 0 oth-
erwise. For the sake of computational efficiency,
we consider tweets that are liked or retweeted by
at least ten users. Then, we apply singular value
decomposition (SVD) to the matrix and use the
dimension-reduced vectors as the features of the
SVM classifier.

Use of textual information We propose three
models that consider the textual information on
user behavior. All three models use MeCab3

with the IPA dictionary4 to perform morpholog-

ical analysis. The first and second models use
the 10,000 most frequent words. The first model
uses them as BOW features of the SVM classifier
and the second model further applies SVD. The
third model is a model using DBOW proposed by
Ding et al. (2017). This model uses words that
have appeared ten or more times. Henceforth, we
refer to these models as BOW, BOW w/ SVD, and
DBOW, respectively.

4.2 Features derived from User Posts

We apply a similar procedure to generate features
derived from user’s posts as BOW w/ SVD. We
first extract the 10,000 most frequent words and
make a user-word matrix. We then apply SVD to
the matrix and use the dimension-reduced vectors
as the features of SVM.

5 Experiments

5.1 Experimental Settings

We randomly split the users in our Twitter dataset
into three parts: training, development, and test
sets. Specifically, we used 5,000 users as the test
set, 5,000 users as the development set, and the
other 10,364 users as the training set. We adopted
the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate each
model.

5.2 Textual vs. Co-occurrence Information of
User Behaviors

We first compared the performance of the mod-
els using the textual information of user behav-
iors and the performance of the models using the
co-occurrence information of the user behaviors.
We built the BOW models, BOW w/ SVD, and
DBOW as the models using the textual informa-
tion. We report results on three settings: 1) con-
sidering only likes, 2) considering only retweets,
and 3) considering both likes and retweets for each
model. We varied the number of dimensions in the
reduced space of SVD with 50, 100, 200, 300, and
500, and the vector sizes for DBOW with 50, 100,
200, 300, and 500 and tuned them on the develop-
ment set. We also optimized SVM parameter C on
the development set.

Table 3 shows the experimental results. We
found that the models using the textual informa-
tion of user behaviors performed better than the
models using the co-occurrence information of

Models Likes Retweets L & R
BOW 0.6366 0.6348 0.6478
BOW w/ SVD 0.6453 0.6442 0.6576
DBOW 0.6412 0.6433 0.6534
Co-occurrence 0.5950 0.5956 0.6137

user behaviors. Among the textual information-
based models, BOW w/ SVD achieved the best
AUC scores. We thus adopt the BOW w/ SVD
model as the textual information model in the fol-
lowing subsections.

As for the types of behavior, the models
based on likes and the models based on retweets
achieved almost the same performance, and the
models that combine both of the features achieved
the best performance.

5.3 Effect of the Number of User Behaviors

We are interested in the relation between the per-
formance of the personality prediction and the
number of behaviors that the model takes into ac-
count. Thus, we performed experiments with vari-
ous sizes of user behaviors. We used the BOW w/
SVD model for this experiment.

Table 4 shows the experimental results for each
dimension. We can see that there is a strong corre-
lation between the performance and the number of
user behaviors taken into account. However, be-
cause the performance improvement between 256
and 1,024 was considerably small, we assume that
the performance of the models will not be largely
improved even if the models consider more be-
haviors. For each feature, as in the previous ex-
periment, the models of likes and the models of
retweets had almost the same performance, and
the models that combine both features achieved
the best performance.

5.4 Incorporating Textual Information of
User Posts and Behaviors

We compare the performance of the models based
only on the textual information of user posts and
the models that also leverage the textual informa-
tion of user behaviors. Specifically, we examined
the effect of the textual information derived from
user behaviors by changing the number of user
posts. The number of texts varied from 1 to 1,024
in multiples of four. We selected the same SVD
dimension for posts, likes, and retweets from 50,

100, 200, 300, and 500 and tuned the vector di-
mensions and SVM parameter C on the develop-
ment set. Note that we used all 1,024 behaviors to
make the features derived from user behaviors in
this experiment.

Table 5 shows the experimental results. We can
confirm that there is a strong correlation between
performance and the number of user posts taken
into account. When we used only a small amount
of a user’s posts, the performance was signifi-
cantly improved by taking the user behaviors into
account. However, when we used 1,024 of user’s
posts, we could not confirm any improvement by
taking the user behaviors into account. Therefore,
we conclude that utilizing user behavior is crucial
for predicting the personality of users who do not
post frequently—say, users who posted fewer than
256 tweets—but it is not useful when we can col-
lect a large number of tweets posted by the target

user.
When we focus on the performance of each di-

mension, we can find that the importance of the in-
formation derived from user behaviors, especially
likes, is relatively large for the N/S dimension. For
example, in the case of the N/S dimension, the
AUC score taking 1,024 liked tweets into account
(0.6786) was higher than that achieved by taking
256 user tweets into account (0.6765), unlike the
other dimensions.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we investigated the effects of con-
sidering user behaviors such as likes and retweets
for personality prediction. Through experiments
using Twitter data, we found that the textual in-
formation of user behaviors is beneficial to predict
the user’s personality and that utilizing user be-



182

haviors is crucial for predicting the personality of
users who do not post many tweets, e.g., less than
256, but that the effect of taking user behaviors
into account is very limited when we can collect
many tweets posted by the target user.

In the future, we plan to explore other use-
ful textual information for personality prediction,
such as text in a web page to which the target user
linked and public comments directed to the user
(as reported by Jurgens et al. (2017)). We can also
include replies to the target user’s tweets to see if
we can improve personality prediction.
