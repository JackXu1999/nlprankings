Abstract

This paper describes the LINA system
for the BUCC 2015 shared track. Fol-
lowing (Enright and Kondrak, 2007), our
system identify comparable documents by
collecting counts of hapax words. We ex-
tend this method by filtering out document
pairs sharing target documents using pi-
geonhole reasoning and cross-lingual in-
formation.

1 Introduction

Parallel corpora, that is, collections of documents
that are mutual translations, are used in many nat-
ural language processing applications, particularly
for statistical machine translation. Building such
resources is however exceedingly expensive, re-
quiring highly skilled annotators or professional
translators (Preiss, 2012). Comparable corpora,
that are sets of texts in two or more languages
without being translations of each other, are of-
ten considered as a solution for the lack of paral-
lel corpora, and many techniques have been pro-
posed to extract parallel sentences (Munteanu et
al., 2004; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009; Smith
et al., 2010), or mine word translations (Fung,
1995; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum,
2002; Morin et al., 2007; Vulić and Moens, 2012).

Identifying comparable resources in a large
amount of multilingual data remains a very chal-
lenging task. The purpose of the Building and
Using Comparable Corpora (BUCC) 2015 shared
task1 is to provide the first evaluation of ex-
isting approaches for identifying comparable re-
sources. More precisely, given a large collection
of Wikipedia pages in several languages, the task
is to identify the most similar pages across lan-
guages.

In this paper, we describe the system that we de-
veloped for the BUCC 2015 shared track and show
that a language agnostic approach can achieve
promising results.

2 Proposed Method

The method we propose is based on (Enright and
Kondrak, 2007)’s approach to parallel document
identification. Documents are treated as bags of
words, in which only blank separated strings that
are at least four characters long and that appear
only once in the document (hapax words) are in-
dexed. Given a document in language A, the doc-
ument in language B that share the largest number
of these words is considered as parallel.

Although very simple, this approach was shown
to perform very well in detecting parallel docu-
ments in Wikipedia (Patry and Langlais, 2011).
The reason for this is that most hapax words are in
practice proper nouns or numerical entities, which
are often cognates. An example of hapax words
extracted from a document is given in Table 1.
We purposely keep urls and special characters, as
these are useful clues for identifying translated
Wikipedia pages.

Here, we experiment with this approach for
detecting near-parallel (comparable) documents.
Following (Patry and Langlais, 2011), we first
search for the potential source-target document
pairs. To do so, we select for each document in
the source language, the N = 20 documents in
the target language that share the largest number
of hapax words (hereafter baseline).

Scoring each pair of documents independently
of other candidate pairs leads to several source
documents being paired to a same target docu-
ment. As indicated in Table 2, the percentage
of English articles that are paired with multiple
source documents is high (57.3% for French and
60.4% for German). To address this problem, we
remove potential multiple source documents by
keeping the document pairs with the highest num-
ber of shared words (hereafter pigeonhole). This
strategy greatly reduces the number of multiply
assigned source documents from roughly 60% to
10%. This in turn removes needlessly paired doc-
uments and greatly improves the effectiveness of
the method.

+ cross-lingual 3.7 3.4

Table 2: Percentage of English articles that are
paired with multiple French or German articles on
the training data.

In an attempt to break the remaining score ties
between document pairs, we further extend our
model to exploit cross-lingual information. When
multiple source documents are paired to a given
English document with the same score, we use
the paired documents in a third language to or-
der them (hereafter cross-lingual). Here we make
two assumptions that are valid for the BUCC 2015
shared Task: (1) we have access to comparable
documents in a third language, and (2) source doc-
uments should be paired 1-to-1 with target docu-
ments.

An example of two French documents (docfr 1
and docfr 2) being paired to the same English doc-
ument (docen) is given in Figure 1. We use the
German document (docde) paired with docen and
select the French document that shares the largest
number of hapax words, which for this example is

docfr 2. This strategy further reduces the number
of multiply assigned source documents from 10%
to less than 4%.

3 Experiments

3.1 Experimental settings

The BUCC 2015 shared task consists in returning
for each Wikipedia page in a source language, up
to five ranked suggestions to its linked page in En-
glish. Inter-language links, that is, links from a
page in one language to an equivalent page in an-
other language, are used to evaluate the effective-
ness of the systems. Here, we only focus on the
French-English and German-English pairs. Fol-
lowing the task guidelines, we use the following
evaluation measures investigate the effectiveness
of our method:

• Mean Average Precision (MAP). Average of
precisions computed at the point of each cor-
rectly paired document in the ranked list of
paired documents.

• Success (Succ.). Precision computed on the
first returned paired document.

• Precision at 5 (P@5). Precision computed on
the 5 topmost paired documents.

3.2 Results

Results are presented in Table 3. Overall, we ob-
serve that the two strategies that filter out multi-
ply assigned source documents improve the per-
formance of the method. The largest part of the
improvement comes from using pigeonhole rea-
soning. The use of cross-lingual information to

break ties between the remaining multiply as-
signed source documents only gives a small im-
provement. We assume that the limited number of
potential source-target document pairs we use in
our experiments (N = 20) is a reason for this.

Interestingly, results are consistent across lan-
guages and datasets (test and train). Our best
configuration, that is, with pigeonhole and cross-
lingual, achieves nearly 60% of success for the
first returned pair. Here we show that a sim-
ple and straightforward approach that requires no
language-specific resources still yields some inter-
esting results.

4 Discussion

In this paper we described the LINA system for
the BUCC 2015 shared track. We proposed to
extend (Enright and Kondrak, 2007)’s approach
to parallel document identification by filtering out
document pairs sharing target documents using pi-
geonhole reasoning and cross-lingual information.
Experimental results show that our system iden-
tifies comparable documents with a precision of
about 60%.

Scoring document pairs using the number of
shared hapax words was first intended to be a
baseline for comparison purposes. We tried a
finer grained scoring approach relying on bilin-
gual dictionaries and information retrieval weight-
ing schemes. For reasonable computation time,
we were unable to include low-frequency words in
our system. Partial results were very low and we
are still in the process of investigating the reasons
for this.
