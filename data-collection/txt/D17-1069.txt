Abstract

We present a feature vector forma-
tion technique for documents - Sparse
Composite Document Vector (SCDV) -
which overcomes several shortcomings of
the current distributional paragraph vec-
tor representations that are widely used for
text representation. In SCDV, word em-
beddings are clustered to capture multiple
semantic contexts in which words occur.
They are then chained together to form
document topic-vectors that can express
complex, multi-topic documents. Through
extensive experiments on multi-class and
multi-label classification tasks, we outper-
form the previous state-of-the-art method,
NTSG (Liu et al., 2015a). We also show
that SCDV embeddings perform well on
heterogeneous tasks like Topic Coherence,
context-sensitive Learning and Informa-
tion Retrieval. Moreover, we achieve sig-
nificant reduction in training and predic-
tion times compared to other representa-
tion methods. SCDV achieves best of both
worlds - better performance with lower
time and space complexity.

1 Introduction

Distributed word embeddings represent words as
dense, low-dimensional and real-valued vectors
that can capture their semantic and syntactic prop-
erties. These embeddings are used abundantly
by machine learning algorithms in tasks such as
text classification and clustering. Traditional bag-
of-word models that represent words as indices
into a vocabulary don’t account for word ordering
and long-distance semantic relations. Represen-
tations based on neural network language models

*Represents equal contribution

(Mikolov et al., 2013b) can overcome these flaws
and further reduce the dimensionality of the vec-
tors. The success of the method is recently math-
ematically explained using the random walk on
discourses model (Arora et al., 2016a). However,
there is a need to extend word embeddings to en-
tire paragraphs and documents for tasks such as
document and short-text classification.

Representing entire documents in a dense, low-
dimensional space is a challenge. A simple
weighted average of the word embeddings in a
large chunk of text ignores word ordering, while
a parse tree based combination of embeddings
(Socher et al., 2013) can only extend to sentences.
(Le and Mikolov, 2014) trains word and para-
graph vectors to predict context but shares word-
embeddings across paragraphs. However, words
can have different semantic meanings in different
contexts. Hence, vectors of two documents that
contain the same word in two distinct senses need
to account for this distinction for an accurate se-
mantic representation of the documents. (Ling
et al., 2015), (Liu et al., 2015a) map word em-
beddings to a latent topic space to capture differ-
ent senses in which words occur. However, they
represent complex documents in the same space
as words, reducing their expressive power. These
methods are also computationally intensive.

In this work, we propose the Sparse Compos-
ite Document Vector(SCDV) representation learn-
ing technique to address these challenges and cre-
ate efficient, accurate and robust semantic repre-
sentations of large texts for document classifica-
tion tasks. SCDV combines syntax and semantics
learnt by word embedding models together with a
latent topic model that can handle different senses
of words, thus enhancing the expressive power of
document vectors. The topic space is learnt effi-
ciently using a soft clustering technique over em-
beddings and the final document vectors are made

sparse for reduced time and space complexity in
tasks that consume these vectors.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 discusses related work in docu-
ment representations. Section 3 introduces and ex-
plains SCDV in detail. This is followed by exten-
sive and rigorous experiments together with anal-
ysis in section 4 and 5 respectively.

2 Related Work

(Le and Mikolov, 2014) proposed two models
for distributional representation of a document,
namely, Distributed Memory Model Paragraph
Vectors (PV-DM) and Distributed BoWs para-
graph vectors (PV-DBoW). In PV-DM, the model
is learned to predict the next context word us-
ing word and paragraph vectors. In PV-DBoW,
the paragraph vector is directly learned to predict
randomly sampled context words. In both mod-
els, word vectors are shared across paragraphs.
While word vectors capture semantics across dif-
ferent paragraphs of the text, documents vectors
are learned over context words generated from the
same paragraph and potentially capture only local
semantics (Singh and Mukerjee, 2015). Moreover,
a paragraph vector is embedded in the same space
as word vectors though it can contain multiple top-
ics and words with multiple senses. As a result,
doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) doesn’t perform
well on Information Retrieval as described in (Ai
et al., 2016a) and (Roy et al., 2016). Consequently,
we expect a paragraph vector to be embedded in a
higher dimensional space.

A paragraph vector also assumes all words con-
tribute equally, both quantitatively (weight) and
qualitatively (meaning). They ignore the impor-
tance and distinctiveness of a word across all doc-
uments (Singh and Mukerjee, 2015). Mukerjee
et al. (Singh and Mukerjee, 2015) proposed idf-
weighted averaging of word vectors to form doc-
ument vectors. This method tries to address the
above problem. However, it assumes that all
words within a document belong to the same se-
mantic topic. Intuitively, a paragraph often has
words originating from several semantically dif-
ferent topics. In fact, Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(Blei et al., 2003) models a document as a distri-
bution of multiple topics.

These shortcomings are addressed in three
novel composite document representations called
Topical word embedding (TWE-1,TWE-2 and

TWE-3) by (Liu et al., 2015a). TWE-1 learns word
and topic embeddings by considering each topic as
a pseudo word and builds the topical word embed-
ding for each word-topic assignment. Here, the
interaction between a word and the topic to which
it is assigned is not considered. TWE-2 learns a
topical word embedding for each word-topic as-
signment directly, by considering each word- topic
pair as a pseudo word. Here, the interaction be-
tween a word and its assigned topic is considered
but the vocabulary of pseudo-words blows up. For
each word and each topic, TWE-3 builds distinct
embeddings for the topic and word and concate-
nates them for each word-topic assignment. Here,
the word embeddings are influenced by the corre-
sponding topic embeddings, making words in the
same topic less discriminative.

(Liu et al., 2015a) proposed an architecture
called Neural tensor skip-gram model (NTSG-1,
NTSG-2, NTSG-3, NTSG-4), that learns multi-
prototype word embeddings and uses a tensor
layer to model the interaction of words and top-
ics to capture different senses. NTSG outper-
forms other embedding methods like TWE−1 on
the 20 newsgroup data-set by modeling context-
sensitive embeddings in addition to topical-word
embeddings. LTSG (Law et al., 2017) builds on
NTSG by jointly learning the latent topic space
and context-sensitive word embeddings. All three,
TWE, NTSG and LTSG use LDA and suf-
fer from computational issues like large training
time, prediction time and storage space. They
also embed document vectors in the same space
as terms. Other works that harness topic modeling
likeWTM (Fu et al., 2016),w2v−LDA (Nguyen
et al., 2015), TV + MeanWV (Li et al., 2016a),
LTSG (Law et al., 2017), Gaussian − LDA
(Das et al., 2015), Topic2V ec (Niu et al., 2015),
(Moody, 2016) andMvTM (Li et al., 2016b) also
suffer from similar issues.

(Gupta et al., 2016) proposed a method to form
a composite document vector using word embed-
dings and tf-idf values, called the Bag of Words
Vector (BoWV). In BoWV , each document is rep-
resented by a vector of dimensionD = K ∗d+K,
where K is the number of clusters and d is the
dimension of the word embeddings. The core
idea behind BoWV is that semantically different
words belong to different topics and their word
vectors should not be averaged. Further, BoWV
computes inverse cluster frequency of each clus-

660



ter (icf) by averaging the idf values of its mem-
ber terms to capture the importance of words in
the corpus. However,BoWV does hard clustering
using K-means algorithm, assigning each word to
only one cluster or semantic topic but a word can
belong to multiple topics. For example, the word
apple belongs to topic food as a fruit, and belongs
to topic Information Technology as an IT company.
Moreover, BoWV is a non-sparse, high dimen-
sional continuous vector and suffers from compu-
tational problems like large training time, predic-
tion time and storage requirements.

3 Sparse Composite Document Vectors

In this section, we present the proposed Sparse
Composite Document Vector (SCDV) representa-
tion as a novel document vector learning algo-
rithm. The feature formation algorithm can be di-
vided into three steps.

3.1 Word Vector Clustering
We begin by learning d dimensional word vec-
tor representations for every word in the vocab-
ulary V using the skip-gram algorithm with neg-
ative sampling (SGNS) (Mikolov et al., 2013a).
We then cluster these word embeddings using
the Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) (Reynolds,
2015) soft clustering technique. The number of
clusters, K, to be formed is a parameter of the
SCDV model. By inducing soft clusters, we en-
sure that each word belongs to every cluster with
some probability P (ck|wi).

p(ck = 1) = πk

p(ck = 1|w) = πkN (w|µk,Σk)ΣKj=1πjN (w|µj ,Σj)

3.2 Document Topic-vector Formation
For each word wi, we create K different word-
cluster vectors of d dimensions ( ~wcvik) by weight-
ing the word’s embedding with its probability dis-
tribution in the kth cluster, P (ck|wi). We then
concatenate all K word-cluster vectors ( ~wcvik)
into a K×d dimensional embedding and weight it
with inverse document frequency of wi to form a
word-topics vector ( ~wtvi). Finally, for all words
appearing in document Dn, we sum their word-
topic vectors ~wtvi to obtain the document vector
~dvDn .

~wcvik = ~wvi × P (ck|wi)

3.3 Sparse Document Vectors

After normalizing the vector, we observed that
most values in ~dvDn are very close to zero. Fig-
ure 3 verifies this observation. We utilize this fact
to make the document vector ~dvDn sparse by zero-
ing attribute values whose absolute value is close
to a threshold (specified as a parameter), which re-
sults in the Sparse Composite Document Vector

~SCDVDn .
In particular, let p be percentage sparsity thresh-

old parameter, ai the value of the ith attribute of
the non-Sparse Composite Document Vector and
n represent the nth document in the training set:

Vectors are shown in figure 1 and figure 2 respec-

4 Experiments

We perform multiple experiments to show the ef-
fectiveness of SCDV representations for multi-
class and multi-label text classification. For all ex-
periments and baselines, we use Intel(R) Xeon(R)
CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz, 40 working cores,
128GB RAM machine with Linux Ubuntu 14.4.
However, we utilize multiple cores only during
Word2Vec training and when we run the one-vs-
rest classifier for Reuters.

4.1 Baselines

We consider the following baselines: Bag-of-
Words (BoW) model (Harris, 1954), Bag of Word
Vector (BoWV) (Gupta et al., 2016) model, para-
graph vector models (Le and Mikolov, 2014),
Topical word embeddings (TWE-1) (Liu et al.,
2015b), Neural Tensor Skip-Gram Model (NTSG-
1 to NTSG-3) (Liu et al., 2015a), tf-idf weighted
average word-vector model (Singh and Mukerjee,
2015) and weighted Bag of Concepts (weight-
BoC) (Kim et al., 2017), where we build topic-
document vectors by counting the member words
in each topic.

We use the best parameter settings as reported in
all our baselines to generate their results. We use
200 dimensions for tf-idf weighted word-vector
model, 400 for paragraph vector model, 80 top-
ics and 400 dimensional vectors for TWE, NTSG,
LTSG and 60 topics and 200 dimensional word
vectors for BOWV. We also compare our results
with reported results of other topic modeling based
document embedding methods like WTM (Fu
et al., 2016), w2v − LDA (Nguyen et al., 2015),
LDA (Chen and Liu, 2014), TV + MeanWV
(Li et al., 2016a), LTSG (Law et al., 2017),
Gaussian−LDA (Das et al., 2015), Topic2V ec
(Niu et al., 2015), (Moody, 2016) andMvTM (Li
et al., 2016b). Implementation of SCDV and re-
lated experiments is available here 1.

4.2 Text Classification

We run multi-class experiments on 20NewsGroup
dataset 2 and multi-label classification experi-
ments on Reuters-21578 dataset 3. We use
the script4 for preprocessing the Reuters-21578
dataset. We use LinearSVM for multi-class classi-

fication and Logistic regression with OneVsRest
setting for multi-label classification in baselines
and SCDV.

For SCDV, we set the dimension of word-
embeddings to 200 and the number of mixture
components in GMM to 60. All mixture com-
ponents share the same spherical co-variance ma-
trix. We learn word vector embedding using Skip-
Gram with window size of 10, Negative Sampling
(SGNS) of 10 and minimum word frequency as
20. We use 5-fold cross-validation on F1 score to
tune parameter C of SVM and the sparsity thresh-
old for SCDV.

4.2.1 Multi-class classification
We evaluate classifier performance using standard
metrics like accuracy, macro-averaging precision,
recall and F-measure. Table 1 shows a compari-
son with the current state-of-art (NTSG) document
representations on the 20Newsgroup dataset. We
observe that SCDV outperforms all other current
models by fair margins. We also present the class-
wise precision and recall for 20Newsgroup on an
almost balanced dataset with SVM over Bag of
Words model and the SCDV embeddings in Table
2 and observe that SCDV improves consistently
over all classes.

4.2.2 Multi-label classification
We evaluate multi-label classification perfor-
mance using Precision@K, nDCG@k (Bhatia
et al., 2015), Coverage error, Label ranking av-
erage precision score (LRAPS)5 and F1-score.
All measures are extensively used for the multi-
label classification task. However, F1-score is
an appropriate metric for multi-label classifica-
tion as it considers label biases when train-test
splits are random. Table 3 show evaluation results
for multi-label text classification on the Reuters-
21578 dataset.

4.2.3 Effect of Hyper-Parameters
SCDV has three parameters: the number of clus-
ters, word vector dimension and sparsity threshold
parameter. We vary one parameter by keeping the
other two constant. Performance on varying all
three parameters in shown in Figure 4. We ob-
serve that performance improves as we increase
the number of clusters and saturates at 60. The
performance improves until a word vector dimen-
sion of 300 after which it saturates. Similarly,
we observe that the performance improves as we
increase p till 4 after which it declines. At 4%
thresholding, we reduce the storage space by 80%
compared to the dense vectors. We observe that
SCDV is robust to variations in training Word2Vec

and GMM. The performance metrics reported in
Tables 1, 3 are the average values obtained across
5 separate runs of SCDV , each run training a dif-
ferent Word2Vec and GMM model with identical
hyper-parameters.

4.3 Topic Coherence

We evaluate the topics generated by GMM cluster-
ing on 20NewsGroup for quantitative and qualita-
tive analysis. Instead of using perplexity (Chang
et al., 2011), which doesn’t correlate with seman-
tic coherence and human judgment of individ-
ual topics, we used the popular topic coherence
(Mimno et al., 2011), (Arora et al., 2013), (Chen
and Liu, 2014) measure. A higher topic coherence
score indicates a more coherent topic.

We used Bayes rule to compute the P (wk|ci)
for a given topic ci and given word wj and com-
pute the score of the top 10 words for each topic.

P (wk|ci) = P (ci|wk)P (wk)
P (ci)

where,

P (ci) =
K∑

i=1

P (ci|wk)P (wk)

P (wk) =
#(wk)∑V
i=1 #(wi)

Here, #(wk) denotes the number of times word
wk appears in the corpus and V represents vocab-
ulary size.

We calculated the topic coherence score for all
topics for SCDV , LDA and LTSG (Law et al.,
2017). Averaging the score of all 80 topics, GMM
clustering scores -85.23 compared to -108.72 of

LDA and -92.23 of LTSG. Thus, SCDV creates
more coherent topics than both LDA and LTSG.

Table 4 shows top 10 words of 3 topics from
GMM clustering, LDAmodel and LTSGmodel
on 20NewsGroup and SCDV shows higher topic
coherence. Words are ranked based on their prob-
ability distribution in each topic. Our results
also support the qualitative results of (Randhawa
et al., 2016), (Sridhar, 2015) paper, where k-
means, GMM was used respectively over word
vectors to find topics.

4.4 Context-Sensitive Learning
In order to demonstrate the effects of soft clus-
tering (GMM) during SCDV formation, we se-
lect some words (wj) with multiple senses from
20Newsgroup and their soft cluster assignments
to find the dominant clusters. We also select top
scoring words (wk) from each cluster (ci) to rep-
resent the meaning of that cluster. Table 5 shows
polysemic words and their dominant clusters with
assignment probabilities. This indicates that using
soft clustering to learn word vectors helps com-
bine multiple senses into a single embedding vec-
tor. (Arora et al., 2016b) also reported similar re-
sults for polysemous words.

4.5 Information Retrieval
(Ai et al., 2016b) used (Mikolov et al., 2013b)’s
paragraph vectors to enhance the basic language
model based retrieval model. The language
model(LM) probabilities are estimated from the
corpus and smoothed using a Dirichlet prior (Zhai
and Lafferty, 2004). In (Ai et al., 2016b), this
language model is then interpolated with the para-
graph vector (PV) language model as follows.

P (w|d) = (1− λ)PLM (w|d) + λPPV (w|d)

where,

PPV (w|d) = exp(~w.

i=1 exp( ~wi.~d)

and the score for document d and query string Q is
given by

score(q, d) =
∑
w∈Q

P (w)P (w|d)

where P (w) is obtained from the unigram query
model and score(q, d) is used to rank documents.
(Ai et al., 2016b) do not directly make use of
paragraph vectors for the retrieval task, but im-
prove the document language model. To di-
rectly make use of paragraph vectors and make
computations more tractable, we directly inter-
polate the language model query-document score
score(q, d) with the similarity score between the
normalized query and document vectors to gener-
ate scorePV (q, d), which is then used to rank doc-
uments.

scorePV (q, d) = (1− λ)score(q, d) + λ~q.~d

Directly evaluating the document similarity score
with the query paragraph vector rather than col-
lecting similarity scores for individual words in
the query helps avoid confusion amongst distinct
query topics and makes the interpolation operation
faster. In Table 6, we report Mean Average Pre-
cision(MAP) values for four datasets, Associated
Press 88-89 (topics 51-200), Wall Street Journal
(topics 51-200), San Jose Mercury (topics 51-150)
and Disks 4 & 5 (topics 301-450) in the TREC
collection. We learn λ on a held out set of topics.
We observe consistent improvement in MAP for
all datasets. We marginally improve the MAP re-
ported by (Ai et al., 2016b) on the Robust04 task.
In addition, we also report the improvements in
MAP score when Model based relevance feedback
(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001) is applied over the ini-
tially retrieved results from both models. Again,
we notice a consistent improvement in MAP.

5 Analysis and Discussion

SCDV overcomes several challenges encountered
while training document vectors, which we had
mentioned above.

1. Clustering word-embeddings to discover top-
ics improves performance of classification as
Figure 4 (left) indicates, while also gener-
ating coherent clusters of words (Table 4).
Figure 5 shows that clustering gives more
discriminative representations of documents
than paragraph vectors do since it uses K ×
d dimensions while paragraph vectors embed
documents and words in the same space. This
enables SCDV to represent complex docu-
ments. Fuzzy clustering allows words to
belong to multiple topics, thereby recogniz-
ing polysemic words, as Table 5 indicates.
Thus it mimics the word-context interaction
in NTSG and LTSG.

2. Semantically different words are assigned to
different topics. Moreover, a single docu-
ment can contain words from multiple differ-
ent topics. Instead of a weighted averaging
of word embeddings to form document vec-
tors, as in most previous work, concatenat-
ing word embeddings for each topic (cluster)
avoids merging of semantically different top-
ics.

3. It is well-known that in higher dimensions,
structural regularizers such as sparsity help
overcome the curse of dimensionality (Wain-
wright, 2014).Figure 3 demonstrates this,
since majority of the features are close to
zero. Sparsity also enables linear SVM to
scale to large dimensions. On 20News-
Groups, BoWV model takes up 1.1 GB while
SCDV takes up only 236MB( 80% decrease).
Since GMM assigns a non-zero probability to
every topic in the word embedding, noise can
accumulate when document vectors are cre-
ated and tip the scales in favor of an unrelated
topic. Sparsity helps to reduce this by zeroing
out very small values of probability.

4. SCDV uses Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
while TWE, NTSG and LTSG use LDA
for finding semantic topics respectively.
GMM time complexity is O(V NT 2) while
that of LDA is O(V 2NT ). Here, V = Vo-
cabulary size, N = number of documents
and T = number of topics. Since num-
ber of topics T < vocabulary size V, GMM
is faster. Empirically, compared to TWE,
SCDV reduces document vector formation,
training and prediction time significantly. Ta-
ble 7 shows training and prediction times for
BoWV, SCDV and TWE models.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a document feature for-
mation technique for topic-based document rep-
resentation. SCDV outperforms state-of-the-art
models in multi-class and multi-label classifica-
tion tasks. SCDV introduces sparsity in document
vectors to handle high dimensionality. Table 7 in-

dicates that SCDV shows considerable improve-
ments in feature formation, training and prediction
times for the 20NewsGroups dataset. We show
that fuzzy GMM clustering on word-vectors lead
to more coherent topic than LDA and can also be
used to detect Polysemic words. SCDV embed-
dings also provide a robust estimation of the query
and document language models, thus improving
the MAP of language model based retrieval sys-
tems. In conclusion, SCDV is simple, efficient and
creates a more accurate semantic representation of
documents.
