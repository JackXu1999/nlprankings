Abstract 

Incoherent discourse in schizophrenia has 

long been recognized as a dominant 

symptom of the mental disorder (Bleuler, 

1911/1950). Recent studies have used 

modern sentence and word embeddings to 

compute coherence metrics for 

spontaneous speech in schizophrenia. 

While clinical ratings always have a 

subjective element, computational 

linguistic methodology allows 

quantification of speech abnormalities. 

Clinical and empirical knowledge from 

psychiatry provide the theoretical and 

conceptual basis for modelling. Our study 

is an interdisciplinary attempt at improving 

coherence models in schizophrenia. Speech 

samples were obtained from healthy 

controls and patients with a diagnosis of 

schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 

and different severity of positive formal 

thought disorder. Interviews were 

transcribed and coherence metrics derived 

from different embeddings. One model 

found higher coherence metrics for 

controls than patients. All other models 

remained non-significant. More detailed 

analysis of the data motivates different 

approaches to improving coherence models 

in schizophrenia, e.g. by assessing 

referential abnormalities.   

1 Introduction 

Language impairments in schizophrenia are 

frequent (Kuperberg, 2010), can impede 

communication and social integration, and are 

usually a predictor for poorer outcome (Roche et 

al., 2015). They include difficulties with 

structural aspects and pragmatic use of language 

as well as deficits in cohesion (Abu-Akel, 1997; 

Bartolucci and Fine, 1987; Chaika and Lambe, 

1989) and semantic coherence (Bedi et al., 2015; 

Ditman and Kuperberg, 2010; Elvevag et al., 

2007; Iter et al., 2018). Although incoherent 

speech is a prominent symptom of schizophrenia 

(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; 

Andreasen, 1979a; Ditman and Kuperberg, 2010), 

there have been few collaborations of psychiatry 

and linguistics to analyze the symptom with 

linguistic quantitative methodology.  

In psychopathological terms, incoherent 

speech is usually not described as a language 

disorder but as one possible manifestation of 

formal thought disorder (FTD) – a symptom 

occurring in a wide range of disorders, albeit 

predominantly in psychosis (Andreasen and 

Grove, 1986; Mercado et al., 2011; Roche et al., 

2015). FTD comprises diverse abnormalities of 

speech and thought, such as neologisms, flight of 

ideas, rumination and perseveration, and negative 

symptoms like alogia (Broome et al., 2017; Roche 

et al., 2015) – all of which are not necessarily 

related to incoherent speech. For example, 

neologisms might impair coherence (Lecours and 

Vanier-Clément, 1976), but can also facilitate 

expressing ideas (Bleuler, 1911/1975; Covington 

et al., 2005). Another example is perseveration, 

where constant repetitions indicate speech 

abnormality but do not have to impede coherence 

(Liddle et al., 2002). Still, especially ratings of 

Coherence models in schizophrenia

positive FTD bear relevance to assessing 

incoherent speech. For example, in the Scale for 

the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), 

incoherent speech is defined as loss of 

associations within sentences which can result in 

incomprehensible “schizophasia” or “word salad” 

(Andreasen, 1979a). It is linked to other forms of 

positive FTD such as tangentiality (i.e. irrelevant 

responses to questions), derailment (i.e. loss of 

associations between larger units of speech), 

illogical, and indirect speech (Andreasen, 1984). 

It should be noted that incoherent speech varies 

across patients depending on the phase of illness 

and the presence and severity of other symptoms 

(Allen et al., 1993; Chaika, 1974; Roche et al., 

2015).  

In linguistics, incoherence refers to the deeper 

semantic sense of speech transcending the 

meaning of individual sentences. It is present 

locally, within and between sentences, as well as 

globally, as the overall topic or function of speech 

(Stede, 2007, p. 24f.). Rhetorical Structure 

Theory, for example, defines coherence through 

establishing relations between minimal discourse 

units and thereby building a structure which is 

reflective of the internal organization of discourse 

(Mann and Thompson, 1987). 

A linguistic, valid, reliable and objective 

measure of incoherent speech could serve to find a 

common language between psychiatry and 

linguistics and specify the definition of 

incoherence as part of FTD. This could be useful 

for further examining the concept and underlying 

mechanisms such as neurological correlates as well 

as for assessing prognosis and treatment 

responsiveness. 

1.1 Automated speech and coherence 
analysis 

Ditman and Kuperberg (2010) suggest that 

incoherent speech in schizophrenia appears to be 

connected to abnormal use of referential markers 

(see also Docherty et al. (1998), Rochester (2013) 

or Hinzen and Rosselló (2015)) and problems in 

“integrating meaning across clauses” (p. 7) which 

can lead to a lower similarity between sentences 

in schizophrenia. This latter observation invites 

for automated coherence analysis that models 

coherence as lexical cohesion or concept overlap. 

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and 

Dumais, 1997) is such a measure and has been 

tested in schizophrenia research (Bedi et al., 2015; 

Elvevag et al., 2007). In a recent study, Iter et al. 

(2018) could not distinguish between 

schizophrenia patients and healthy controls 

replicating the LSA-based models used in Bedi et 

al. (2015) and Elvevag et al. (2007). They point 

out three major shortcomings of the models: (1) 

the misinterpretation of verbal fillers as 

incoherent speech, (2) a bias to judging longer 

sentences as more coherent than short ones, as 

well as (3) a bias to judging repetitions as more 

coherent. Iter et al. (2018) were able to improve 

coherence models by Elvevag et al. (2007) and 

Bedi et al. (2015) by preprocessing their dataset 

and using modern word and sentence embedding 

techniques which have been shown to outperform 

LSA (Fang et al., 2016; Levy et al., 2015). 

Moreover, they credit the mentioned observations 

of referential problems in schizophrenia and 

propose a referential coherence model based on 

classifying ambiguous pronoun use to further 

improve the predictive value of their results.  

Our study aims to (1) assess whether the 

models used by Iter et al. (2018) can be 

transferred to the German language, and (2) to 

apply them to a larger sample of patients of 

varying stability. Specifically, we aim to examine 

(1) whether schizophrenia patients and controls 

can be differentiated based on automated 

coherence analysis, and (2) whether 

schizophrenia patients of varying stability can be 

differentiated not only based on clinical rating 

scales but also based on automated coherence 

analysis. (3) We aim to extend attempts by Iter et 

al. (2018) to further improve coherence models by 

quantifying idiosyncrasies of speech in 

schizophrenia.  

2 Method 

2.1 Participants 

N = 30 participants took part in this study (see 

Table 1 for characteristics of the sample). n = 10 

were patients from the Psychiatric University 

Clinic at St. Hedwig Hospital Berlin and n = 10 

patients were recruited from the pool of 

participants in the MPP-S study (clinical trials ID: 

NCT02576613). Participants were: (1) inpatients 

(n = 5) or outpatients (n = 15) with a diagnosis of 

schizophrenia (n = 15) or schizoaffective disorder 

(n = 5) according to Diagnostic and Statistical 

Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text 

Revision (DSM-IV-TR), confirmed by trained

clinicians; (2) showed native proficiency in 

German language; (3) had no organic mental 

disorder or relevant severe somatic disease; (4) no 

active substance dependence. The control group (n 

= 10) was recruited from the local community. 

Healthy controls were screened by experienced 

clinicians with the Mini-International 

Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) (Sheehan et 

al., 1998). 

The study was approved by the local ethics’ 

committee.  

2.2 Procedure 

Speech samples for automated analysis were 

obtained by trained clinicians with a short semi-

structured interview, the Narrative of Emotions 

Task (NET) (Buck et al., 2014). It includes three 

questions about four emotions: sadness, fear, 

anger and happiness: (1) What does this emotion 

mean to you? (2) Describe a situation where you 

felt this emotion. (3) Why do you think you felt 

this emotion in this situation? The interview is 

designed to prompt participants to define this 

range of simple emotions with the intention to 

“assess the richness and coherence with which 

one explains emotional and social events“ (Buck 

et al., 2014, p. 235). Semi-structured interviews 

have already been used in studies on automated 

speech analysis in schizophrenia (Elvevag et al., 

2007; Minor et al., 2019). The structured format 

of the NET interview allows direct comparison 

between subjects and open questions generate

larger samples of free speech. All NET interviews 

were recorded. They were transcribed by the first 

and third author. 

The assessment also included a test of verbal 

intelligence, the exploration of demographic data 

and the M.I.N.I. (Sheehan et al., 1998) for 

controls. After the session, interviewers rated 

patients for psychopathology. 

2.3 Measures 

Psychopathology: Psychopathology was rated by 

trained clinicians with common psychiatric rating 

scales: the Scale for the Assessment of Negative 

Symptoms (SANS) (Andreasen, 1989) and the 

Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms 

(SAPS) (Andreasen, 1984). Both scales have 

good psychometric properties and have frequently 

been used in schizophrenia research (Norman et 

al., 1996; van Erp et al., 2014). The patient sample 

was divided in two groups based on SAPS ratings 

of global positive FTD, including ratings of 

incoherence or tangentiality. The group with 

positive FTD was defined by SAPS ratings of at 

least mild (≥ 2) global positive FTD and at least 

mild incoherence or tangentiality (≥ 2).  

Severity of illness: The Clinical Global 

Impression – Severity Scale (CGI) (Guy, 2000) 

allows trained clinicians to assess the severity of 

a patient’s illness on a scale from 1 (not at all ill) 

to 7 (extremely severely ill).  

Verbal intelligence: “Crystallized” verbal 

intelligence was assessed with a German 

vocabulary test, the Wortschatztest (WST) 

(Schmidt and Metzler, 1992). 

3 Data Analysis 

3.1 Preparation of data 

The dataset consists of 241 min 51 sec of 30 

recorded NET interviews. Interview length 

ranged between 3 to 22 min, with an average 

length of 8 min. The interviewer’s speech has 

been left out of more complex analysis because 

the interviewer’s speech can be reduced to the 

questions mentioned above.  

However, questions have been used to 

categorize participants’ speech as definitions of 

emotions (question 1), descriptions of situations 

(questions 2) and reasoning why a situation 

evoked an emotion (question 3) (Buck et al., 

2014). When interviewers deviated from the NET 

interview, those remarks were removed to ensure 

comparability. After cleaning transcripts of 

interviewer’s speech, the dataset for baseline 

analysis consists of 21,668 words, ranging from 

137 to 2,641 words, with an average of 722.3 

words per participant.  

For the other coherence models, verbal fillers 

and sentences only containing stop words have 

also been excluded from analysis, because they 

have been shown to bias coherence measures (Iter 

et al., 2018). This reduced the dataset to 20,421 

words, ranging from 121 to 2,551 words, with an 

average of 680.7 words per participant (see 

Table 2).  

3.2 Speech analysis of transcripts 

All speech analysis uses models inspired by those 

of Iter et al. (2018) which they base on research 

by Elvevag et al. (2007) and Bedi et al. (2015). 

Iter et al. (2018) name these approaches the 

Tangentiality and the Incoherence model, 

following the above definitions in the SAPS 

(Andreasen, 1984). In the Incoherence Model 

(Bedi et al., 2015), the cosine similarity between 

pairs of adjacent sentences embeddings serves as 

a measure of coherence. The Tangentiality model 

(Elvevag et al., 2007) models coherence as the 

slope of a linear regression line for the cosine 

similarities between a question and a moving

fixed-sized window of the response. A steeper 

negative slope means that the response is 

becoming less similar to the question over time.  

A steeper positive slope indicates that the 

response is getting more similar to the question 

over time, i.e. what psychiatry calls a 

circumstantial response (Andreasen, 1984). In 

either case, incoherent responses are 

characterized by steeper slopes. The 

differentiation of positive and negative slopes and 

the following necessity to calculate with absolute 

values has not been emphasized by Elvevag et al. 

(2007) or Iter et al. (2018). 

Both the Incoherence and the Tangentiality 

model define coherence “as the concept overlap 

between two texts” (Iter et al., 2018) – either 

between utterances of the same speaker or 

between a question and the following response. 

These definitions reflect the intuition that, in 

order to be deemed coherent, a contribution to a 

verbal interaction is expected to adhere to the 

topic mutually established by the participants at 

any given stage of the conversation. The word 

distributions that form the basis for this kind of 

analysis are thus to be conceived of as a kind of 

epiphenomenon of more general principles of 

communication.  

Baseline coherence model: The first step of 

speech analysis aims to test the Incoherence and 

Tangentiality model on the raw dataset. No 

filtering of stop words or fillers was performed 

except for the unavoidable loss of words not 

covered by vocabulary of the respective models. 

Baseline models use mean vector sentence 

embeddings, i.e. the mean of all word vectors per 

sentence or window of tokens (Iter et al., 2018). 

The vectors are given by a word2vec model 

(Mikolov et al., 2013) and a GloVe model 

(Pennington et al., 2014) trained on German data. 

The Tangentiality model at baseline uses a fixed-

size window of four tokens. 

In contrast to Iter et al. (2018), we refrained 

from using LSA in our analysis due to the lack of 

availability of such a model that has not already 

performed a TF-IDF-weighting (Lintean et al., 

2010) at the stage of training. Additionally, the 

weighting scheme used at the training of the 

model at hand differs from that adopted by Iter et 

al. (2018). Consequently, in order to preserve a 

certain level of comparability, we decided not to 

use the available LSA model. However, the use of 

word2vec for our baseline is justifiable by the fact 

that the main improvement from baseline to any 

of the other embeddings is not so much the choice 

of model but rather the filtering of stop words and 

fillers as well as the different weighting schemes.  

New coherence models: Following Iter et al. 

(2018), we test mean of word vectors and three 

types of sentence embeddings on our 

preprocessed dataset: TF-IDF (Lintean et al., 

2010), Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) (Arora et 

al., 2016) and Sent2Vec (Pagliardini et al., 2018).  

For TF-IDF, we use the parameterization of 

Lintean et al. (2010), also used by Iter et al. 

(2018): multiplying each word embedding by the 

raw (non-logged) term frequency (#of times that 

word occurs in the sentence) and dividing by the 

(non-logged) document frequency (#of 

documents in which the term is used in a corpus). 

As a reference corpus for document frequencies 

we used a lemmatized dump of German 

Wikipedia (2011). Words not appearing in any 

document of the reference corpus were discarded, 

as closer investigation revealed them to be 

artifacts of the preprocessing steps rather than 

very uncommon and highly predictive words. 

Sent2Vec can be seen as an extension of 

Word2Vec in that its objective has been modified 

to encompass whole sentences rendering their 

embeddings predictive of the sentences 

surrounding them. Finally, SIF starts out by 

representing sentences by a weighted average of 

their word embeddings.  In a further step, the 

projections of the average vectors on their first 

singular vector are removed, the effect of which 

is intended to be the removal of biases along 

directions reflecting idiosyncrasies of the 

underlying data. The principal goal of such 

weighting schemes lies in reducing the influence 

of very common words that contribute little to 

nothing semantically to the overall meaning of the 

sentence.   

4 Results 

4.1 Sample characteristics 

Patient groups and controls did not differ 

significantly regarding age and verbal IQ. Patients 

with and without signs of positive FTD did not 

differ significantly regarding duration of illness. 

Patients with positive FTD were more often 

inpatients and rated to be more severely ill than 

those without positive FTD, as measured by CGI. 

As expected, patients with positive FTD had higher 



131

 

 

clinical ratings for a number of symptoms than 

patients without positive FTD, including SAPS 

global positive FTD, incoherence, and 

tangentiality. See Table 1 for an overview of ratings 

of psychopathology and significant differences.  

4.2 NET interviews 

Interview length and word count differed 

significantly between groups: Patients with 

positive FTD had longer interviews and used more 

words than controls. Patients without positive FTD 

had shorter interviews and used less words than 

controls. This difference persisted after cleaning 

transcripts of stop words. The amount of verbal 

fillers and sentences only containing stop words 

did not differ significantly between groups. The 

dataset is presented in Table 2. 

4.3 Coherence models 

Incoherence model: Mean values for cosine 

similarities were calculated per interview. Group 

means were compared by ANOVA after testing for 

normal distribution (results for all models are 

presented in Table 3, extended results can be found 

in Appendix A). Group differences were only 

significant for TF-IDF term weighting using GloVe 

word embeddings: healthy controls showed higher 

coherence scores than patients without ratings of 

positive FTD who in turn exhibited higher 

coherence scores than patients with ratings of 

positive FTD. Coherence metrics were 

significantly negatively correlated with SAPS 

ratings of various positive symptoms: clothing and 

appearance (r = -.62; p < .05), social and sexual 

behavior (r = -.5; p < .05), global severity of 

bizarre behavior (r = -.48; p < .05), and symptoms 

of positive FTD: derailment (r = -.5; p < .05), 

tangentiality, (r = -.4; p < .1), incoherence  

(r = -.45; p < .05), illogicality (r = -.48; p < .05), 

clanging (r = -.41; p < .1), and inappropriate affect 

(r = -.5; p < .05). SANS ratings of negative 

symptoms were not significantly correlated with 

coherence metrics. As Iter et al. (2018), we did not 

detect any significant group differences at baseline 

for the Incoherence model. Removing verbal fillers 

and sentences composed entirely of stop words did 

not change this result for mean vector sentence 

embeddings, which were also used at baseline. 

Sent2Vec and SIF embeddings, and TF-IDF 

weighting using word2vec word embeddings also 

did not yield significantly different coherence 

metrics between groups.  

Tangentiality model: First, absolute values of 

the computed slopes in the Tangentiality model 

were determined. This is necessary as high 

(negative or positive) values for slopes indicate 

incoherence. Thus, calculating means without 

absolute values could lead to false interpretations. 

Second, mean slopes were calculated per 

individual response, i.e. per question and emotion, 

yielding 12 values per interview. Those were 

further combined to mean values per each of the 

three questions and per each of the four emotions 

as well as to one overall mean slope per interview. 

Group means were compared by ANOVA after 

testing for normal distribution. Since results did not 

differ for comparisons of overall means versus 

means per question/emotion, we only report results 

for overall means. Overall mean slopes did not 

differ significantly between groups for any of the 

embeddings.

of ambiguous pronouns in the data into their 

means of classification. They define ambiguous 

pronouns as either referring cataphorically or not 

having a referent at all. In contrast to Iter et al. 

(2018), we refrained from using automated 

coreference resolution which appeared to be 

relatively error-prone. We believe the evaluation 

on the basis of manual annotation to be more 

informative. We therefore manually marked 

ambiguous pronouns throughout the interview 

transcripts which allowed for determining a total 

number of ambiguous pronouns per interview. 

The average number of ambiguous pronouns was 

significantly higher for patients with ratings of 

positive FTD than for the other two groups 

(F = 4.79; p < .05). There was no significant 

difference between controls and patients without 

ratings of positive FTD. However, since 

pressured speech and word count differed 

significantly between groups, we repeated the 

comparison controlling for word count by only 

analyzing a window of the first 120 words per 

transcript. With this adjustment, the significant 

difference disappeared. 

More detailed analysis of results revealed 

significant group differences in the amount of 

unknown words that were discarded before 

coherence metrics were computed because they 

were not contained in the respective model: 

patients with ratings of positive FTD used 

significantly more unknown words than patients 

without ratings of positive FTD or controls  

(F = 5.85; p < 0.05). When controlling for word 

count, this significant difference disappeared. 

However, it is worth differentiating unknown 

words: They can either be uncommon or quite 

specific actual words (e.g. exacerbation) or 

neologisms that are more or less intelligible (e.g. 

Rotwut: “red-rage”; e.g. vergehlich: approx. 

“fleeting”, no exact translation possible). While 

no control subject and only one patient without 

positive FTD used neologisms, five patients with 

ratings of positive FTD used neologisms  

(χ² = 8.75; p < .05). This difference remained 

significant after controlling for word count  

(χ² = 6.67; p < .05). 

Closer investigation of transcripts revealed that 

participants with high scores for the Incoherence 

model (TF-IDF, GloVe) often repeated target 

words such as “sad” or “fear”. Low scores 

coincided with less repetitions – in some but not 

all cases. This is a mere qualitative observation. 

5 Discussion 

This study tested different computational linguistic 

approaches to modeling coherence in 

schizophrenia. The Incoherence model, using TF-

IDF sentence embeddings and GloVe word 

embeddings, was able to distinguish between 

healthy controls and patients with or without 

ratings of positive FTD. Results from other 

approaches were not significant which demands 

for cautious interpretation. Although the 

significant group difference matches clinical 

impression, we argue to treat the result with 

caution. When judging the performance of a 

coherence model in schizophrenia, it might be 

misleading to merely base it on significant group 

differences. This approach by Iter et al. (2018) is 

based on the assumption that the speech of patients 

with schizophrenia contains less contextual 

overlap than the speech of healthy controls and that 

a model that detects this difference is correct and 

“outperforming” models that lack significant 

results. However, this basic assumption also 

requires critical evaluation. Perseveration poses 

one potential problem: This symptom of positive 

FTD involves constant repetitions and thus, 

influences models that are based on similarity 

between sets of key words, without actually 

accounting for whether the speech is intelligible 

(Iter et al., 2018). Since perseveration indicates 

speech abnormality but does not have to impede 

coherence (Liddle et al., 2002), it can bias 

automated coherence models. Future studies 

should clinically assess perseveration when 

recruiting patients to ensure that it is equally 

distributed. In comparison with controls though, 

the problem would remain. Based on our results, it 

remains unclear whether coherence modelled as 

context overlap differs significantly between 

patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.  

We would also like to emphasize that, while 

interpretation of the Incoherence model is intuitive, 

results in the Tangentiality model are substantially 

more complex. To our knowledge, the 

differentiation between negative and positive 

slopes has not been made in previous studies 

(Elvevag et al., 2007; Iter et al., 2018), albeit its 

relevance for interpretation. It remains open 

whether this measure accurately models incoherent 

features of speech in schizophrenia. 

It should be noted that another possibility for the 

lack of significant results might be the quality of 



133

 

 

the trained models. In contrast to other studies 

testing automated coherence analysis in 

schizophrenia (Bedi et al., 2015; Elvevag et al., 

2007; Iter et al., 2018), our models were trained on 

the German version of Wikipedia and may be 

inferior to models trained in English. Under the 

reasonable assumption that the English models 

were trained on the respective Wikipedia dump, the 

training data nearly triples that available for a 

German model.1 The resulting differences in 

representational quality are likely to be substantial.  

Additionally, German morphology may have to 

be taken into account as an aggravating factor as 

training was performed without any preprocessing 

beyond conversion to lower case letters. Being 

considerably richer than its English counterpart, it 

makes the demand for greater amounts of training 

data even more pressing, since the model has to 

generalize over a wider morphological spread. This 

problem is illustrated in Table 4 containing a 

sample of the cosine similarities computed with 

our GloVe model. Here the word pair anger/ 

happiness achieves a higher score than the noun 

anger and its derivate angry, and similarities are 

even lower between the inflections of the adjective 

angry. Furthermore, the grammar of German 

famously features a productive rule of noun 

composition that in some cases leads to the 

exacerbation of the problem of out-of-vocabulary-

words. For example, in one instance, 14 out of 31 

the words not covered by our model were instances 

of such compound nouns.  

More detailed analysis of our results inspires to 

improve coherence models by taking into account 

other ways of modelling coherence than context 

overlap and by controlling for possible 

confounding variables in the speech of patients 

with schizophrenia. We agree with Iter et al. (2018) 

that quantifying ambiguous pronoun use can be a 

valid approach to operationalizing a characteristic 

of incoherent speech in schizophrenia that has been 

frequently described (Ditman and Kuperberg, 

2010; Docherty et al., 1998; Hinzen and Rosselló, 

2015; Rochester, 2013). Moreover, unknown 

words that are automatically removed from 

analysis because they are not contained in the 

vocabulary of the coherence model might 

confound results. In our sample, patients with high 

                                                           
1 The English Wikipedia constitutes 11.7% of the articles of 

all language editions combined whereas the German version 

represents only 4.6%. 

(see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia) 

ratings of positive FTD did use more uncommon, 

specific or neologized words. While 

incomprehensible neologisms can be associated 

with “schizophasia” (Lecours and Vanier-

Clément, 1976), they are not necessarily a marker 

for incoherence. They can even enrich 

(therapeutic) discourse, e.g. as descriptions of 

novel, otherwise  inexpressible ideas  (Bleuler, 

1911/1975; Covington et al., 2005). Thus, 

discarding them without further analysis might 

over- or underestimate the coherence of speech of 

thought disordered patients. Plus, we point out the 

importance of controlling for word count when 

examining prevalence of speech abnormalities. Iter 

et al. (2018) missed the opportunity of this 

adjustment despite large differences in word count 

between patients and controls, thereby possibly 

overseeing a confounding variable. Pressured 

speech is a common symptom of positive FTD in 

schizophrenia and can be correlated with 

incoherence (Andreasen, 1979b, 1984) – still, mere 

higher production of speech is no sign of 

incoherence. This limited our analysis on the first 

120 words of responses – future research could test 

whether markers of incoherence vary depending on 

which part of the response is examined.  

In conclusion, while automated coherence 

models can further improve understanding of 

incoherent speech in schizophrenia, our results 

emphasize the importance of carefully analyzing 

the data at hand while considering potential 

relationships between incoherence and other 

relevant variables. Moreover, they underline the 

necessity for the establishment of some standard 

with regards to the vector models underlying 

analysis. Nevertheless, this interdisciplinary 

approach can enable mutual stimulation between 

linguistics and psychiatry.
