Abstract

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can be im-
proved by including document-level contex-
tual information. For this purpose, we propose
a hierarchical attention model to capture the
context in a structured and dynamic manner.
The model is integrated in the original NMT
architecture as another level of abstraction,
conditioning on the NMT model’s own previ-
ous hidden states. Experiments show that hi-
erarchical attention significantly improves the
BLEU score over a strong NMT baseline with
the state-of-the-art in context-aware methods,
and that both the encoder and decoder benefit
from context in complementary ways.

1 Introduction

Neural machine translation (NMT) (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017)
trains an encoder-decoder network on sentence
pairs to maximize the likelihood of predicting
a target-language sentence given the correspond-
ing source-language sentence, without consider-
ing the document context. By ignoring discourse
connections between sentences and other valuable
contextual information, this simplification poten-
tially degrades the coherence and cohesion of a
translated document (Hardmeier, 2012; Meyer and
Webber, 2013; Sim Smith, 2017). Recent studies
(Tiedemann and Scherrer, 2017; Jean et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018) have demon-
strated that adding contextual information to the
NMT model improves the general translation per-
formance, and more importantly, improves the co-
herence and cohesion of the translated text (Baw-
den et al., 2018; Lapshinova-Koltunski and Hard-
meier, 2017). Most of these methods use an ad-
ditional encoder (Jean et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2017) to extract contextual information from pre-
vious source-side sentences. However, this re-
quires additional parameters and it does not ex-

ploit the representations already learned by the
NMT encoder. More recently, Tu et al. (2018)
have shown that a cache-based memory network
performs better than the above encoder-based
methods. The cache-based memory keeps past
context as a set of words, where each cell cor-
responds to one unique word keeping the hidden
representations learned by the NMT while trans-
lating it. However, in this method, the word repre-
sentations are stored irrespective of the sentences
where they occur, and those vector representations
are disconnected from the original NMT network.

We propose to use a hierarchical attention net-
work (HAN) (Yang et al., 2016) to model the
contextual information in a structured manner us-
ing word-level and sentence-level abstractions. In
contrast to the hierarchical recurrent neural net-
work (HRNN) used by (Wang et al., 2017), here
the attention allows dynamic access to the context
by selectively focusing on different sentences and
words for each predicted word. In addition, we in-
tegrate two HANs in the NMT model to account
for target and source context. The HAN encoder
helps in the disambiguation of source-word repre-
sentations, while the HAN decoder improves the
target-side lexical cohesion and coherence. The
integration is done by (i) re-using the hidden rep-
resentations from both the encoder and decoder
of previous sentence translations and (ii) provid-
ing input to both the encoder and decoder for the
current translation. This integration method en-
ables it to jointly optimize for multiple-sentences.
Furthermore, we extend the original HAN with a
multi-head attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) to cap-
ture different types of discourse phenomena.

Our main contributions are the following:
(i) We propose a HAN framework for translation
to capture context and inter-sentence connections
in a structured and dynamic manner. (ii) We in-
tegrate the HAN in a very competitive NMT ar-



2948

chitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) and show signif-
icant improvement over two strong baselines on
multiple data sets. (iii) We perform an ablation
study of the contribution of each HAN configura-
tion, showing that contextual information obtained
from source and target sides are complementary.

2 The Proposed Approach

The goal of NMT is to maximize the likelihood
of a set of sentences in a target language repre-
sented as sequences of words y = (y1, ..., yt)
given a set of input sentences in a source language
x = (x1, ..., xm) as:

max
Θ

1

N

N∑
n=1

log(PΘ(y
n|xn)) (1)

so, the translation of a document D is made by
translating each of its sentences independently. In
this study, we introduce dependencies on the pre-
vious sentences from the source and target sides:

max
Θ

1

N

N∑
n=1

log(PΘ(y
n|xn,Dxn ,Dyn)) (2)

where Dxn = (xn−k, ...,xn−1) and Dyn =
(yn−k, ...,yn−1) denote the previous k sentences
from source and target sides respectively. The con-
texts Dxn and Dyn are modeled with HANs.

2.1 Hierarchical Attention Network

The proposed HAN has two levels of abstraction.
The word-level abstraction summarizes informa-
tion from each previous sentence j into a vector sj

as:
qw = fw(ht) (3)

sj = MultiHead
i

(qw, h
j
i ) (4)

where h denotes a hidden state of the NMT net-
work. In particular, ht is the last hidden state of
the word to be encoded, or decoded at time step
t, and hji is the last hidden state of the i-th word
of the j-th sentence of the context. The function
fw is a linear transformation to obtain the query
qw. We used the MultiHead attention function pro-
posed by (Vaswani et al., 2017) to capture differ-
ent types of relations among words. It matches the
query against each of the hidden representations
hji (used as value and key for the attention).

The sentence-level abstraction summarizes the
contextual information required at time t in dt as:

Figure 1: Integration of HAN during encoding at time
step t, h̃t is the context-aware hidden state of the word
xt. Similar architecture is used during decoding.

qs = fs(ht) (5)

dt = FFN(MultiHead
j

(qs, s
j)) (6)

where fs is a linear transformation, qs is the query
for the attention function, FFN is a position-wise
feed-forward layer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Each
layer is followed by a normalization layer (Lei Ba
et al., 2016).

2.2 Context Gating
We use a gate (Tu et al., 2018, 2017) to regulate the
information at sentence-level ht and the contextual
information at document-level dt. The intuition
is that different words require different amount of
context for translation:

λt = σ(Whht +Wddt) (7)

h̃t = λtht + (1− λt)dt (8)

where Wh,Wp are parameter matrices, and h̃t is
the final hidden representation for a word xt or yt.

2.3 Integrated Model
The context can be used during encoding or de-
coding a word, and it can be taken from previously
encoded source sentences, previously decoded tar-
get sentences, or from previous alignment vectors
(i.e. context vectors (Bahdanau et al., 2015)). The
different configurations will define the input query
and values of the attention function. In this work
we experiment with five of them: one at encod-
ing time, three at decoding time, and one combin-
ing both. At encoding time the query is a func-
tion of the hidden state hxt of the current word
to be encoded xt, and the values are the encoded
states of previous sentences hjxi (HAN encoder).
At decoding time, the query is a function of the
hidden state hyt of the current word to be decoded
yt, and the values can be (a) the encoded states
of previous sentences hjxi (HAN decoder source),



2949

(b) the decoded states of previous sentences hjyi
(HAN decoder), and (c) the alignment vectors cji
(HAN decoder alignment). Finally, we combine
complementary target-source sides of the context
by joining HAN encoder and HAN decoder. Fig-
ure 1 shows the integration of the HAN encoder
with the NMT model; a similar architecture is ap-
plied to the decoder. The output h̃t is used by the
NMT model as replacement of ht during the final
classification layer.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

We carry out experiments with Chinese-to-English
(Zh-En) and Spanish-to-English (Es-En) sets on
three different domains: talks, subtitles, and news.

TED Talks is part of the IWSLT 2014 and 2015
(Cettolo et al., 2012, 2015) evaluation campaigns1.
We use dev2010 for development; and tst2010-
2012 (Es-En), tst2010-2013 (Zh-En) for testing.
The Zh-En subtitles corpus is a compilation of TV
subtitles designed for research on context (Wang
et al., 2018). In contrast to the other sets, it has
three references to compare. The Es-En corpus is
a subset of OpenSubtitles2018 (Lison and Tiede-
mann, 2016)2. We randomly select two episodes
for development and testing each. Finally, we use
the Es-En News-Commentaries113 corpus which
has document-level delimitation. We evaluate on
WMT sets (Bojar et al., 2013): newstest2008 for
development, and newstest2009-2013 for testing.
A similar corpus for Zh-En is too small to be com-
parable. Table 2 shows the corpus statistics.

For evaluation, we use BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002) (multi-blue) on tokenized text, and we
measure significance with the paired bootstrap re-
sampling method proposed by Koehn (2004) (im-
plementations by Koehn et al. (2007)).

3.2 Model Configuration and Training

As baselines, we use a NMT transformer, and a
context-aware NMT transformer with cache mem-
ory which we implemented for comparison fol-
lowing the best model described by Tu et al.
(2018), with memory size of 25 words. We used
the OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) implementation
of the transformer network. The configuration is
the same as the model called “base model” in the
1https://wit3.fbk.eu
2http://www.opensubtitles.org
3http://opus.nlpl.eu/News-Commentary11.php

original paper (Vaswani et al., 2017). The encoder
and decoder are composed of 6 hidden layers each.
All hidden states have dimension of 512, dropout
of 0.1, and 8 heads for the multi-head attention.
The target and source vocabulary size is 30K. The
optimization and regularization methods were the
same as proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017). In-
spired by Tu et al. (2018) we trained the models
in two stages. First we optimize the parameters
for the NMT without the HAN, then we proceed
to optimize the parameters of the whole network.
We use k = 3 previous sentences, which gave the
best performance on the development set.

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Translation Performance

Table 1 shows the BLEU scores for different mod-
els. The baseline NMT transformer already has
better performance than previously published re-
sults on these datasets, and we replicate previous
previous improvements from the cache method
over the this stronger baseline. All of our proposed
HAN models perform at least as well as the cache
method. The best scores are obtained by the com-
bined encoder and decoder HAN model, which
is significantly better than the cache method on
all datasets without compromising training speed
(2.3K vs 2.6K tok/sec). An important portion of
the improvement comes from the HAN encoder,
which can be attributed to the fact that the source-
side always contains correct information, while
the target-side may contain erroneous predictions
at testing time. But combining HAN decoder with
HAN encoder further improves translation perfor-
mance, showing that they contribute complemen-
tary information. The three ways of incorporating
information into the decoder all perform similarly.

Table 3 shows the performance of our best HAN
model with a varying number k of previous sen-
tences in the test-set. We can see that the best per-
formance for TED talks and news is archived with
3, while for subtitles it is similar between 3 and 7.

4.2 Accuracy of Pronoun/Noun Translations

We evaluate coreference and anaphora using the
reference-based metric: accuracy of pronoun
translation (Miculicich Werlen and Popescu-Belis,
2017b), which can be extended for nouns. The list
of evaluated pronouns is predefined in the met-
ric, while the list of nouns was extracted using
NLTK POS tagging (Bird, 2006). The upper part

of Table 4 shows the results. For nouns, the joint
HAN achieves the best accuracy with a significant
improvement compared to other models, showing
that target and source contextual information are
complementary. Similarity for pronouns, the joint
model has the best result for TED talks and news.
However, HAN encoder alone is better in the case
of subtitles. Here HAN decoder produces mis-
takes by repeating past translated personal pro-
nouns. Subtitles is a challenging corpus for per-
sonal pronoun disambiguation because it usually
involves dialogue between multiple speakers.

4.3 Cohesion and Coherence Evaluation

We use the metric proposed by Wong and Kit
(2012) to evaluate lexical cohesion. It is defined as
the ratio between the number of repeated and lex-
ically similar content words over the total number
of content words in a target document. The lexi-
cal similarity is obtained using WordNet. Table 4
(bottom-left) displays the average ratio per tested
document. In some cases, HAN decoder achieves
the best score because it produces a larger quan-
tity of repetitions than other models. However,
as previously demonstrated in 4.2, repetitions do
not always make the translation better. Although
HAN boosts lexical cohesion, the scores are still
far from the human reference, so there is room for
improvement in this aspect.

For coherence, we use a metric based on Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Foltz et al., 1998). LSA
is used to obtain sentence representations, then co-
sine similarity is calculated from one sentence to

the next, and the results are averaged to get a doc-
ument score. We employed the pre-trained LSA
model Wiki-6 from (Stefanescu et al., 2014). Ta-
ble 4 (bottom-right) shows the average coherence
score of documents. The joint HAN model consis-
tently obtains the best coherence score, but close
to other HAN models. Most of the improvement
comes from the HAN decoder.

4.4 Qualitative Analysis

Table 5 shows an example where HAN helped
to generate the correct translation. The first box
shows the current sentence with the analyzed word
in bold; and the second, the past context at source
and target. For the context visualization we use
the toolkit provided by Pappas and Popescu-Belis
(2017). Red corresponds to sentences, and blue
to words. The intensity of color is proportional to
the weight. We see that HAN correctly translates
the ambiguous Spanish pronoun “su” into the En-
glish “his”. The HAN decoder highlighted a previ-
ous mention of “his”, and the HAN encoder high-
lighted the antecedent “Nathaniel”. This shows
that HAN can capture interpretable inter-sentence
connections. More samples with different atten-
tion heads are shown in the Appendix ??.

mann, 2010; Gong et al., 2011). However, most
of the work explicitly models discourse phe-
nomena (Sim Smith, 2017) such as lexical co-
hesion (Meyer and Popescu-Belis, 2012; Xiong
et al., 2013; Loáiciga and Grisot, 2016; Pu
et al., 2017; Mascarell, 2017), coherence (Born
et al., 2017), and coreference (Rios Gonzales and
Tuggener, 2017; Miculicich Werlen and Popescu-
Belis, 2017a). Hardmeier et al. (2013) introduced
the document-level SMT paradigm.
Sentence-level NMT Initial studies on NMT en-
hanced the sentence-level context by using mem-
ory networks (Wang et al., 2016), self-attention
(Miculicich Werlen et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,
2016), and latent variables (Yang et al., 2017).
Document-level NMT Tiedemann and Scherrer
(2017) use the concatenation of multiple sentences

as NMT’s input/output, Jean et al. (2017) add a
context encoder for the previous source sentence,
Wang et al. (2017) includes a HRNN to summa-
rize source-side context, and Tu et al. (2018) use
a dynamic cache memory to store representations
of previously translated words. Recently, Baw-
den et al. (2018) proposed test-sets for evaluating
discourse in NMT, Voita et al. (2018) shows that
context-aware NMT improves the of anaphoric
pronouns, and Maruf and Haffari (2018) proposed
a document-level NMT using memory-networks.

6 Conclusion

We proposed a hierarchical multi-head HAN NMT
model5 to capture inter-sentence connections. We
integrated context from source and target sides
by directly connecting representations from pre-
vious sentence translations into the current sen-
tence translation. The model significantly outper-
forms two competitive baselines, and the ablation
study shows that target and source context is com-
plementary. It also improves lexical cohesion and
coherence, and the translation of nouns and pro-
nouns. The qualitative analysis shows that the
model is able to identify important previous sen-
tences and words for the correct prediction. In fu-
ture work, we plan to explicitly model discourse
connections with the help of annotated data, which
may further improve translation quality.
