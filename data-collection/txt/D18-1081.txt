Abstract

BLEU is widely considered to be an informa-
tive metric for text-to-text generation, includ-
ing Text Simplification (TS). TS includes both
lexical and structural aspects. In this paper we
show that BLEU is not suitable for the evalua-
tion of sentence splitting, the major structural
simplification operation. We manually com-
piled a sentence splitting gold standard cor-
pus containing multiple structural paraphrases,
and performed a correlation analysis with hu-
man judgments.1 We find low or no correlation
between BLEU and the grammaticality and
meaning preservation parameters where sen-
tence splitting is involved. Moreover, BLEU
often negatively correlates with simplicity, es-
sentially penalizing simpler sentences.

1 Introduction

BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is an n-gram-
based evaluation metric, widely used for Ma-
chine Translation (MT) evaluation. BLEU has
also been applied to monolingual translation tasks,
such as grammatical error correction (Park and
Levy, 2011), summarization (Graham, 2015) and
text simplification (Narayan and Gardent, 2014;
Štajner et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016), i.e. the rewrit-
ing of a sentence as one or more simpler sentences.

Along with the application of parallel corpora
and MT techniques for TS (e.g., Zhu et al., 2010;
Wubben et al., 2012; Narayan and Gardent, 2014),
BLEU became the main automatic metric for TS,
despite its deficiencies (see §2). Indeed, focus-
ing on lexical simplification, Xu et al. (2016) ar-
gued that BLEU gives high scores to sentences
that are close or even identical to the input, espe-
cially when multiple references are used. In their
experiments, BLEU failed to predict simplicity,

but obtained a higher correlation with grammat-
icality and meaning preservation, relative to the
SARI metric they proposed.

In this paper, we further explore the appli-
cability of BLEU for TS evaluation, examining
BLEU’s informativeness where sentence splitting
is involved. Sentence splitting, namely the rewrit-
ing of a single sentence as multiple sentences
while preserving its meaning, is the main struc-
tural simplification operation. It has been shown
useful for MT preprocessing (Chandrasekar et al.,
1996; Mishra et al., 2014; Li and Nenkova, 2015)
and human comprehension (Mason and Kendall,
1979; Williams et al., 2003), independently from
other lexical and structural simplification opera-
tions. Sentence splitting is performed by many TS
systems (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata,
2011; Siddharthan and Angrosh, 2014; Narayan
and Gardent, 2014, 2016). For example, 63% and
80% of the test sentences are split by the systems
of Woodsend and Lapata (2011) and Zhu et al.
(2010), respectively (Narayan and Gardent, 2016).
Sentence splitting is also the focus of the recently
proposed Split-and Rephrase sub-task (Narayan
et al., 2017; Aharoni and Goldberg, 2018), in
which the automatic metric used is BLEU.

For exploring the effect of sentence splitting
on BLEU scores, we compile a human-generated
gold standard sentence splitting corpus – HSplit,
which will also be useful for future studies of split-
ting in TS, and perform correlation analyses with
human judgments. We consider two reference
sets. First, we experiment with the most common
set, proposed by Xu et al. (2016), evaluating a va-
riety of system outputs, as well as HSplit. The ref-
erences in this setting explicitly emphasize lexical
operations, and do not contain splitting or content
deletion.2 Second, we experiment with HSplit as

the reference set, evaluating systems that focus on
sentence splitting. The first setting allows assess-
ing whether BLEU with the standard reference set
is a reliable metric on systems that perform split-
ting. The second allows assessing whether BLEU
can be adapted to evaluate splitting, given a refer-
ence set so oriented.

We find that BLEU is often negatively corre-
lated with simplicity, even when evaluating out-
puts without splitting, and that when evaluating
outputs with splitting, it is less reliable than a
simple measure of similarity to the source (§4.2).
Moreover, we show that BLEU cannot be adapted
to assess sentence splitting, even where the refer-
ence set focuses on this operation (§4.3). We con-
clude that BLEU is not informative and is often
misleading for TS evaluation and for the related
Split and Rephrase task.

2 Related Work

The BLEU Metric. BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) is reference-based, where the use of mul-
tiple references is used to address cross-reference
variation. To address changes in word order,
BLEU uses n-gram precision, modified to elimi-
nate repetitions across the references. A brevity
term penalizes overly short sentences. Formally:

BLEU = BP× exp(
N∑

n=1

wnlog(pn))

where BP is the brevity penalty term, pn are the
modified precisions, and wn are the corresponding
weights, which are usually uniform in practice.

The experiments of Papineni et al. (2002)
showed that BLEU correlates with human judg-
ments in the ranking of five English-to-Chinese
MT systems and that it can distinguish human and
machine translations. Although BLEU is widely
used in MT, several works have pointed out its
shortcomings (e.g., Koehn and Monz, 2006). In
particular, Callison-Burch et al. (2006) showed
that BLEU may not correlate in some cases with
human judgments since a huge number of poten-
tial translations have the same BLEU score, and
that correlation decreases when translation quality
is low. Some of the reported shortcomings are rel-
evant to monolingual translation, such as the im-
possibility to capture synonyms and paraphrases
that are not in the reference set, or the uniform
weighting of words.

tural operations are involved (Nisioi et al., 2017; Sulem et al.,
2018b).

BLEU in TS. While BLEU is standardly used
for TS evaluation (e.g., Xu et al., 2016; Nisioi
et al., 2017; Zhang and Lapata, 2017; Ma and
Sun, 2017), only few works tested its correlation
with human judgments. Using 20 source sentences
from the PWKP test corpus (Zhu et al., 2010) with
5 simplified sentences for each of them, Wubben
et al. (2012) reported positive correlation of BLEU
with simplicity ratings, but no correlation with ad-
equacy. T-BLEU (Štajner et al., 2014), a vari-
ant of BLEU which uses lower n-grams when no
overlapping 4-grams are found, was tested on out-
puts that applied only structural modifications to
the source. It was found to have moderate posi-
tive correlation for meaning preservation, and pos-
itive but low correlation for grammaticality. Cor-
relation with simplicity was not considered in this
experiment. Xu et al. (2016) focused on lexical
simplification, finding that BLEU obtains reason-
able correlation for grammaticality and meaning
preservation but fails to capture simplicity, even
when multiple references are used. To our knowl-
edge, no previous work has examined the behavior
of BLEU on sentence splitting, which we inves-
tigate here using a manually compiled gold stan-
dard.

3 Gold-Standard Splitting Corpus

In order to investigate the effect of correctly split-
ting sentences on the automatic metric scores, we
build a parallel corpus, where each sentence is
modified by 4 annotators, according to specific
sentence splitting guidelines. We use the complex
side of the test corpus of Xu et al. (2016).3

While Narayan et al. (2017) recently pro-
posed the semi-automatically compiled WEB-
SPLIT dataset for training automatic sentence
splitting systems, here we generate a completely
manual corpus, without a-priori splitting points
nor do we pre-suppose that all sentences should
be split. This corpus enriches the set of references
focused on lexical operations that were collected
by Xu et al. (2016) for the same source sentences
and can also be used as an out-of-domain test set
for Split-and-Rephrase (Narayan et al., 2017).

We use two sets of guidelines. In Set 1, an-
notators are required to split the original as much
as possible, while preserving the sentence’s gram-

simplification includes the corpus, the SARI metric
and the SBMT-SARI system. The corpus comprises 359
sentences.

maticality, fluency and meaning. The guidelines
include two sentence splitting examples.4 In Set
2, annotators are encouraged to split only in cases
where it simplifies the original sentence. That is,
simplicity is implicit in Set 1 and explicit in Set 2.
In both sets, the annotators are instructed to leave
the source unchanged if splitting violates gram-
maticality, fluency or meaning preservation.5

Each set of guidelines is used by two annotators,
with native or native-like proficiency in English.
The obtained corpora are denoted by HSplit1,
HSplit2 (for Set 1), and HSplit3 and HSplit4 (for
Set 2), each containing 359 sentences. Table 1
presents statistics for the corpora. Both in terms
of the number of splits per sentence (# Sents) and
in terms of the proportion of input sentences that
have been split (SplitSents), we observe that the
average difference within each set is significantly
greater than the average difference between the
sets.6 This suggests that the number of splits is
less affected by the explicit mention of simplicity
than by the inter-annotator variability.

Metrics. In addition to BLEU,7 we also ex-
periment with (1) iBLEU (Sun and Zhou, 2012)
which was recently used for TS (Xu et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2017) and which takes into account
the BLEU scores of the output against the input
and against the references; (2) the Flesch-Kincaid
Grade Level (FK; Kincaid et al., 1975), computed
at the system level, which estimates the readabil-
ity of the text with a lower value indicating higher

readability;8 (3) SARI (Xu et al., 2016), which
compares the n-grams of the system output with
those of the input and the human references, sep-
arately evaluating the quality of words that are
added, deleted and kept by the systems. For
completeness, we also experiment with the neg-
ative Levenshtein distance to the source (-LDSC),
which serves as a measure of conservatism.9

We explore two settings. In one (“Standard Ref-
erence Setting”, §4.2), we use two sets of ref-
erences: the Simple Wikipedia reference (yield-
ing BLEU-1ref and iBLEU-1ref), and 8 refer-
ences obtained by crowdsourcing by Xu et al.
(2016) (yielding BLEU-8ref, iBLEU-8ref and
SARI-8ref). In the other (“HSplit as Reference
Setting”, §4.3), we use HSplit as the reference set.

Systems. For “Standard Reference Setting”, we
consider both a case where evaluated systems do
not perform any splittings on the test set (“Sys-
tems/Corpora without Splits”), and one where we
evaluate these systems, along with the HSplit cor-
pus, used in the role of system outputs (“All Sys-
tems/Corpora”). Systems include six MT-based
simplification systems, including outputs of the
state-of-the-art neural TS system of Nisioi et al.
(2017), in four variants: either default settings
or initialization by word2vec, for each both the
highest and the fourth ranked hypotheses in the
beam are considered.10 We further include Moses
(Koehn et al., 2007) and SBMT-SARI (Xu et al.,
2016), a syntax-based MT system tuned against
SARI, and the identity function (outputs are same
as inputs). The case which evaluates outputs with
sentence splitting additionally includes the four
HSplit corpora and the HSplit average scores.

For “HSplit as Reference Setting”, we con-
sider the outputs of six simplification systems
whose main simplification operation is sentence
splitting: DSS, DSSm, SEMoses, SEMosesm,
SEMosesLM and SEMosesmLM , taken from (Sulem
et al., 2018b).

Human Evaluation. We use the evaluation
benchmark provided by Sulem et al. (2018b),11

including system outputs and human evaluation
scores corresponding to the first 70 sentences of

10Taking the fourth hypothesis rather than the first has been
found to yield considerably less conservative TS systems.

the test corpus of Xu et al. (2016), and extend it to
apply to HSplit as well.

The evaluation of HSplit is carried out by 3
in-house native English annotators, who rated the
different input-output pairs for the different sys-
tems according to 4 parameters: Grammaticality
(G), Meaning preservation (M), Simplicity (S) and
Structural Simplicity (StS). G and M are measured
using a 1 to 5 scale. A -2 to +2 scale is used
for measuring simplicity and structural simplicity.
For computing the inter-annotator agreement of
the whole benchmark (including the system out-
puts and the HSplit corpora), we follow Pavlick
and Tetreault (2016) and randomly select, for each
sentence, one annotator’s rating to be the rating of
Annotator 1 and the rounded average rating of the
two other annotators to be the rating of Annotator
2. We then compute weighted quadratic κ (Co-
hen, 1968) between Annotator 1 and 2. Repeating
this process 1000 times, the obtained medians and
95% confidence intervals are 0.42 ± 0.002 for G,
0.77 ± 0.001 for M and 0.59 ± 0.002 for S and
StS.

4.2 Results with Standard Reference Setting

Description of the Human Evaluation Scores.
The human evaluation scores for each parame-
ter are obtained by averaging over the 3 annota-
tors. The scores at the system level are obtained
by averaging over the 70 sentences. In the ”All
systems/corpora” case of the ”Standard Reference
Setting”, where 12 systems/corpora are consid-
ered, the range of the average G scores at the sys-
tem level is from 3.71 to 4.80 (σ = 0.29). For
M, this max-min difference between the systems
is 1.23 (σ=0.40). For S and StS, the differences
are 0.53 (σ = 0.17) and 0.65 (σ = 0.20). At the
sentence level, considering 840 sentences (70 for

each of the system/corpora), the G and M scores
vary from 1 to 5 (σ equals 0.69 and 0.85 respec-
tively), and the S and StS scores from -1 to 2 (σ
equals 0.53 and 0.50).

In the ”Systems/corpora without Splits” case of
the ”Standard Reference Setting”, where 7 sys-
tems/corpora are considered, the max-min differ-
ence at the system level are again 1.09 (σ = 0.36)
and 1.23 (σ = 0.47) for G and M respectively. For
S and StS, the differences are 0.45 and 0.49 (σ =
0.18). At the sentence level, considering 490 sen-
tences (70 for each of the system/corpora), the G
and M scores vary from 1 to 5 (σ equals 0.78 and
1.01 respectively), and the S and StS scores from
-1 to 2 (σ equals 0.51 and 0.46).

Comparing HSplit to Identity. Comparing the
BLEU score on the input (the identity function)
and on the HSplit corpora, we observe that the
former yields much higher BLEU scores. Indeed,
BLEU-1ref obtains 59.85 for the input and 43.90
for the HSplit corpora (averaged over the 4 HSplit
corpora). BLEU-8ref obtains 94.63 for the input
and 73.03 for HSplit.12 The high scores obtained
for Identity, also observed by Xu et al. (2016),
indicate that BLEU is a not a good predictor for
relative simplicity to the input. The drop in the
BLEU scores for HSplit is not reflected by the
human evaluation scores for grammaticality (4.43
for AvgHSplit vs. 4.80 for Identity) and meaning
preservation (4.70 vs. 5.00), where the decrease
between Identity and HSplit is much more lim-
ited. For examining these tendencies in more de-
tail, we compute the correlations between the au-

12These scores concern the first 70 sentences of the corpus.
A similar phenomenon is observed on the whole corpus (359
sentences). BLEU-1ref obtains 59.23 for the input and 45.68
for HSplit. BLEU-8ref obtains 94.93 for the input and 75.68
for HSplit.

tomatic metrics and the human evaluation scores.
They are described in the following paragraph.

Correlation with Human Evaluation. The
system-level Spearman correlations between the
rankings of the automatic metrics and the human
judgments (see §4.1) are presented in Table 2.
We find that in all cases BLEU and iBLEU neg-
atively correlate with S and StS, indicating that
they fail to capture simplicity and structural sim-
plicity. Where gold standard splits are evaluated
as well, BLEU’s and iBLEU’s failure to capture
StS is even more pronounced. Moreover, BLEU’s
correlation with G and M in this case disappears.
In fact, BLEU’s correlation with M in this case is
considerably lower than that of -LDSC and its cor-
relation with G is comparable, suggesting BLEU
is inadequate even as a measure of G and M if
splitting is involved.

We examine the possibility that BLEU mostly
acts as a measure of conservatism, and com-
pute the Spearman correlation between -LDSC
and BLEU. The high correlations we obtain be-
tween the metrics indicate that this may be the
case. Specifically, BLEU-1ref obtains correlations
of 0.86 (p = 7 × 10−3) without splits and of 0.52
(p = 0.04) where splitting is involved. BLEU-8ref
obtains 0.82 (p = 0.01) and 0.55 (p = 0.03).

SARI obtains positive correlations with S,
of 0.52 (without splits) and 0.26 (all sys-
tems/corpora), but correlates with StS in neither
setting. This may stem from SARI’s focus on lex-
ical, rather than structural TS.

Similar trends are observed in the sentence-
level correlation for S, StS and M, whereas G
sometimes benefits in the sentence level from in-
cluding HSplit in the evaluation. For G and M, the
correlation with BLEU is lower than its correlation
with -LDSC in both cases.

4.3 Results with HSplit as Reference Setting

We turn to examining whether BLEU may be
adapted to address sentence splitting, if provided
with references that include splittings.

Description of the Human Evaluation Scores.
In the ”HSplit as Reference Reference Setting”,
where 6 systems are considered, the max-min dif-
ference at the system level is 0.16 (σ = 0.06) for
G, 0.37 for M (σ = 0.15), and 0.41 for S and StS
(σ equals 0.20 and 0.19 respectively). At the sen-
tence level, considering 420 sentences (70 for each
of the systems), the G and M scores vary from 1 to
5 (σ equals 0.99 and 0.88 respectively), and the S
and StS scores from -2 to 2 (σ equals 0.63).

Correlation with Human Evaluation. On
the system-level Spearman correlation between
BLEU and human judgments, we find that while
correlation with G is high (0.57, p = 0.1), it
is low for M (0.11, p = 0.4), and negative for
S (-0.70, p = 0.06) and StS (-0.60, p = 0.1).
Sentence-level correlations of BLEU and iBLEU
are positive, but they are lower than those obtained
by LDSC . See Table 3.

To recap, results in this section demonstrate that
even when evaluated against references that focus
on sentence splitting, BLEU fails to capture the
simplicity and structural simplicity of the output.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we argued that BLEU is not suitable
for TS evaluation, showing that (1) BLEU nega-
tively correlates with simplicity, and that (2) even
as a measure of grammaticality or meaning preser-
vation it is comparable to, or worse than -LDSC ,
which requires no references. Our findings sug-
gest that BLEU should not be used for the eval-
uation of TS in general and sentence splitting in
particular, and motivate the development of alter-
native methods for structural TS evaluation, such
as (Sulem et al., 2018a).
