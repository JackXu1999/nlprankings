Automatic text simplification is a special task of text-to-text generation, and it converts
a text into another text that is easier to read and understand, while the underlying
meaning and information remains the same. A text simplification system usually re-
places difficult or unknown phrases with simpler equivalents and transforms long
and syntactically complex sentences into shorter and less complex ones. Here is an
example from Siddharthan (2006). The first sentence contains two relative clauses and
one conjoined verb phrase, and the text below is the simplified version.

Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents report that
is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.

Research on automatic text simplification started 20 years ago, and it has become a
very important area in natural language processing (NLP) and attracted much attention
in recent years. Text simplification facilitates the adaptation of the textual material. It
also helps to make texts easier to process and use, thus making accessible information
for all a reality. However, it is not an easy task because it involves lexical, syntactic, and
semantic issues and possesses interesting challenges.

This book, written by Horacio Saggion, covers all key issues in text simplification,
including automatic readability assessment, lexical simplification, syntactic simplifi-
cation, machine learning–based simplification, and applications of text simplification.
Moreover, it describes several typical full text simplification systems, introduces text
simplification evaluation techniques, and offers available resources for research and
development. This book is written in an elegant way and I enjoyed reading it. It
consists of nine chapters, with each chapter focused on a single specific topic about text
simplification. Readers can easily choose one or several (almost) self-contained chapters
covering the topic(s) they are interested in.

Chapter 1 briefly introduces what automatic text simplification is and why we need
such a technology. It introduces two different text simplification tasks to address differ-
ent sub-problems: lexical simplification and syntactic simplification. Text simplification
tools will be very useful for a large range of users with reading difficulties (e.g., people
with aphasia or an autism spectrum disorder). Such tools can be used to create adapted
versions of texts for specific populations. I appreciate the text simplification task because
it is a promising NLP technology for social good.

Chapter 2 provides an overview of the topic of readability assessment, which is
relevant to many approaches to automatic text simplification. Readability assessment
techniques can be used to determine the complexity of a given text and thus compare the
outputs of different text simplification systems. It is not trivial to automatically assess
the readability level of a text. In this chapter, several classical readability formulas are
presented and discussed, including the Flesch Reading Ease Score, the Flesch-Kincaid
readability formula, the FOG readability score, and the SMOG readability score. Then
more robust methods relying on rich syntactic and semantic features are described,
along with a few typical classification or regression algorithms (e.g., SVM, kNN, logistic
regression) that have been used in these methods.

Chapter 3 covers techniques addressing the lexical simplification problem by re-
placing words and phrases with simpler equivalents. It introduces the first approach to
lexical simplification based on WordNet (Carroll et al. 1998) and then a Spanish lexical
simplification system based on word sense disambiguation. After that, approaches
based on comparable corpora and distributional lexical semantics are described, fol-
lowed by a description of a numerical expression simplification system. This chapter
also covers relevant evaluation challenges on complex word identification and lexical
simplification, which provide benchmark data sets for future research.

Chapter 4 covers techniques to address the syntactic simplification problem by
simplifying the syntactic structure of sentences and phrases. Note that this chapter
introduces only rule-based approaches, which do not require large annotated corpora.
It describes the first syntactic simplification approach targeting constructions such as
relative clauses and appositions (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Srinivas 1996) and the ap-
proach using typed dependencies, followed by a full rule-based simplification system
implemented as a pipeline with four main components. Other approaches relying on
information extraction and generation are also outlined. This chapter contains a few
examples of rules, which are very helpful for readers’ understanding.

Chapter 5 covers techniques to learn simplification from corpora. This chapter first
introduces methods that cast text simplification as monolingual machine translation
(Specia 2010), and then it surveys methods that use a statistical syntactic-tree translation
process. It also surveys optimization techniques for rule application and recent tech-
niques to incorporate semantic information into the simplification problem. With the
growth of computing power and data scale, learning-based simplification methods have
become prevalent. Neural network models, especially sequence-to-sequence models,
have been successfully applied on text simplification. Readers are encouraged to read
more recent papers to supplement this chapter.

Chapter 6 presents three fully fledged text simplification systems for different
readerships and languages: PSET for English (Carroll et al. 1998), Simplext for Spanish
(Saggion et al. 2011), and PorSimples for Brazilian Portuguese (Aluı́sio and Gasperin
2010). The systems have been designed for specific target populations (people with
aphasia, people with low literacy, and people with cognitive disabilities). The details
of the systems are described clearly, which will benefit practitioners to build their own
text simplification systems.

Book Review

Chapter 7 introduces various applications of automatic text simplification. This
chapter first introduces applications of text simplification for specific target populations
(not covered in Chapter 6) and then describes the use of text simplification to facilitate
other NLP tasks, including parsing, information extraction, and text summarization. I
personally like to see the usefulness of text simplification for other NLP tasks, and I also
expect to see a more extensive use of text simplification in the NLP field.

Chapter 8 covers two important topics for text simplification—the available data
sets for experimentation and the current evaluation techniques. This chapter introduces
lexical resources (English and Non-English corpora for text simplification) that are
very useful for building and testing text simplification models or systems. After that,
this chapter provides automatic evaluation metrics and methods, including machine
learning–based ones. Note that automatic evaluation is not accurate enough and human
evaluation is usually more reliable than automatic evaluation for text simplification.
How to develop more accurate automatic evaluation metrics or techniques is a research
direction in this area.

Chapter 9 concludes, with an overview of the field of text simplification and a
critical view of the current state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, Saggion’s book provides a comprehensive and in-depth introduction
to automatic text simplification, covering both methodologies and resources for text
simplification. It is worth noting that the materials for further reading at the end of each
chapter are also valuable resources. This book is recommended not only to researchers,
students, and practitioners who work in the area of text simplification, but also to a
wide range of readers who are interested in this area. There is still a long way to go in
this interesting area, and I look forward to seeing new approaches and resources of text
simplification.
