Abstract

Previous “wug” tests (Berko, 1958) on
Japanese verbal inflection have demonstrated
that Japanese speakers, both adults and chil-
dren, cannot inflect novel present tense forms
to “correct” past tense forms predicted by
rules of existent verbs (de Chene, 1982; Vance,
1987, 1991; Klafehn, 2003, 2013), indicating
that Japanese verbs are merely stored in the
mental lexicon. However, the implicit assump-
tion that present tense forms are bases for ver-
bal inflection should not be blindly extended to
morphologically rich languages like Japanese
in which both present and past tense forms are
morphologically complex without inherent di-
rection (Albright, 2002). Interestingly, there
are also independent observations in the acqui-
sition literature to suggest that past tense forms
may be bases for verbal inflection in Japanese
(Klafehn, 2003; Murasugi et al., 2010; Hirose,
2017; Tatsumi et al., 2018). In this paper,
we computationally simulate two directions
of verbal inflection in Japanese, Present 7→
Past and Past 7→ Present, with the rule-based
computational model called Minimal Gener-
alization Learner (MGL; Albright and Hayes,
2003) and experimentally evaluate the model
with the bidirectional “wug” test where hu-
mans inflect novel verbs in two opposite direc-
tions. We conclude that Japanese verbs can be
computed online via some generalizations and
those generalizations do depend on the direc-
tion of morphological inflection.

1 Introduction

In her seminal “wug” test, Berko (1958) demon-
strated that English speakers, both adults and chil-
dren, can inflect novel nouns (e.g. wug) and novel
verbs (e.g. rick) to “correct” plural forms (e.g.
wugs) and “correct” past tense forms (e.g. ricked),

respectively. This demonstration strongly sug-
gests that, since the novel words cannot be ex-
perienced before by the experimental participants
and thus accessed from the mental lexicon, the in-
flected forms must have been produced online via
some productive generalizations, whose nature has
been actively debated in the literature (O’Donnell,
2015; Yang, 2016).

Nevertheless, “wug” tests might be too easy to
“pass” in morphologically sparse languages like
English in which present tense forms are unsuf-
fixed and homonymous (except 3rd person singu-
lar) with infinitival forms, and past tense forms
are generated via simple affixation. In fact, previ-
ous “wug” tests on Japanese verbal inflection have
demonstrated that Japanese speakers, both adults
and children, cannot inflect novel present tense
forms to “correct” past tense forms predicted by
rules of existent verbs (de Chene, 1982; Vance,
1987, 1991; Klafehn, 2003, 2013). The results of
these previous “wug” tests have been taken to in-
dicate that Japanese verbs are merely stored in the
mental lexicon, not produced online via produc-
tive generalizations.

However, the implicit assumption that present
tense forms are bases for verbal inflection should
not be blindly extended to morphologically rich
languages like Japanese. As pointed out by Al-
bright (2002), various factors conspire to deter-
mine which cell of the paradigm should be iden-
tified as the base and, consequently, in which
direction morphological inflection should be im-
plemented. In particular, unlike English whose
present and past tense forms are asymmetrically
complex, both present and past tense forms are
suffixed in Japanese and thus morphologically
complex without inherent direction, as in Table 1:

Table 1: Japanese verbal inflection (McCawley, 1968)

Interestingly, there are independent observa-
tions in the acquisition literature to suggest that
past tense forms may be bases for verbal inflec-
tion in Japanese. First, Japanese children acquire
past tense forms around age 2 before present tense
forms (Clancy, 1985; Klafehn, 2003), unlike En-
glish children who acquire present tense or infini-
tival forms first (Brown, 1973). Second, Japanese
children exclusively produce past tense forms as
Root Infinitive analogues before age 2 (Murasugi
et al., 2010), unlike bona fide Root Infinitives in
English (Wexler, 1994). Third, Japanese chil-
dren overregularize present tense forms (e.g. sim-
u ‘die’; Hirose, 2017), but not past tense forms
like English (e.g. go-ed; Klafehn, 2003). Finally,
Japanese children seem to have an inductive bias
to prefer past tense forms to present tense forms
(Tatsumi et al., 2018). Those observations con-
verge on the hitherto unexplored hypothesis that
past tense forms are bases in Japanese.

In this paper, inspired by the acquisition liter-
ature (Klafehn, 2003; Murasugi et al., 2010; Hi-
rose, 2017; Tatsumi et al., 2018), we computation-
ally simulate two directions of verbal inflection
in Japanese, Present 7→ Past and Past 7→ Present,
with the rule-based computational model called
Minimal Generalization Learner (MGL; Albright
and Hayes, 2003) and experimentally evaluate the
model with the bidirectional “wug” test where hu-
mans inflect novel verbs in two opposite direc-
tions. The following questions will be addressed:

1. Which direction is computationally less com-
plex for the model?

2. Which direction is experimentally more ac-
curate for humans?

3. In which direction do the model and humans
correlate more strongly?

Model complexity will be measured via three
evaluation metrics derived from the confidence
scores of rules induced based on the lexicon of
existent verb pairs (Albright, 2002). In addi-
tion, human accuracy and the correlation between
the model and humans are explicitly evaluated
against the model, avoiding impressionistic inter-
pretations as in previous “wug” tests, where “the
meaning of the word ‘pass’ is a 60% or better
score” (Klafehn, 2013, p.182).

The organization of this paper is as follows.
Section 2 describes the methodological details of
the Minimal Generalization Learner, the bidirec-
tional “wug” test, and the statistical analyses to
compare the two. Section 3 presents the results of
model complexity, human accuracy, and the cor-
relation between the model and humans, corre-
sponding to the three questions above. Section 4
summarizes the results and discuss theoretical im-
plications. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Methods

2.1 Minimal Generalization Learner
Training: The rule-based computational model
called Minimal Generalization Learner (MGL;
Albright and Hayes, 2002, 2003) was employed
from the literature. The MGL was trained on the
lexicon of 1269 existent verb pairs (Suski, 1942)
in two directions (Present 7→ Past and Past 7→
Present), with V-V compounds and light verb con-
structions removed in order to avoid inflation of
the number of particular inflections. Then, rules
were induced through minimal generalization for
each direction. See Albright and Hayes (2002,
2003) for the rule induction algorithm.
Testing: Novel verbs were then fed into the
trained MGL as input and the inflected forms of
those verbs were produced as output with the reli-
ability and confidence scores defined below.
Reliability score: The reliability score of a rule,
p̂, is defined as Equation 1:

p̂ =
# forms correctly derived (= hits)

# forms potentially derived (= scope)
(1)

Confidence score: Since weak rules supported by
smaller data should be penalized (Mikheev, 1997),
the reliability score of a rule is transformed into
the confidence score, π, defined as Equation 2:

π = p̂∗ − z(1− α)/2×
√
p̂∗ × (1− p̂∗)

n
(2)



172

where p̂∗ is the smoothed reliability p̂∗ = hits+0.5scope+1 ,√
p̂∗×(1−p̂∗)

n is the estimated variance, and α is the
free parameter called confidence value (the higher
α, the greater penalty for weak rules) assumed
here as α = .75.
Mean confidence: Three evaluation metrics can
be derived from the confidence score (cf. Albright,
2002). First, the mean confidence score of win-
ning outputs is defined as Equation 3:

π̄ =
1

n

n∑
i∈I

max
o∈Oi

πo (3)

where I is the the set of all inputs, Oi is the set of
all outputs derived from the input i, and πo is the
confidence score of the output o. The higher mean
confidence, the more efficient grammar.
Mean margin: Second, the mean confidence mar-
gin of winning outputs is defined as Equation 4:

∆̄ =
1

n

n∑
i∈I

[max
o∈Oi

πo −max
s∈Si

(πs, 0)] (4)

where S is the subset of all outputs derived from
the input i without winning outputs. The higher
mean margin, the more efficient grammar.
Mean entropy: Finally, the mean confidence en-
tropy of possible outputs is defined as Equation 5:

H̄ =
1

n

n∑
i∈I

|Oi|∑
o∈Oi

πo log2 πo (5)

where the confidence scores of all outputs derived
from the input, O, are normalized, such that the
scores sum up to 1. Unlike the metrics above, the
lower mean entropy, the more efficient grammar.

2.2 Bidirectional “Wug” Test

Participants: The bidirectional “wug” test was
conducted with the within-participants design.
The experimental participants were 45 undergrad-
uate students at Waseda University in Japan. They
were given a U500 book coupon for their partic-
ipation. The 6 participants who were non-native
speakers of Japanese or misinterpreted the instruc-
tions were excluded from statistical analyses, re-
sulting in 39 participants in total.
Stimuli: Bisyllabic novel roots (“wug” roots)
were created by randomly combining two open
syllables (CV). The open syllables were extracted
from the lexicon of 1269 existent verb stems
(Suski, 1942), with V-V compounds and light verb
constructions removed, and only those with token

frequency ≥ 20 were included. The “wug” roots
that resemble actual Japanese words or contain
repetitions of the same segments were excluded.
Since the native Japanese words cannot generally
start with voiced obstruents (Tanaka and Yashima,
2013) or /r/ (Labrune, 2014), the “wug” roots start-
ing with those segments were also excluded. Then,
32 past tense forms of the “wug” roots were cre-
ated as target stimuli in the Past 7→ Present direc-
tion, by attaching (i) the V-final past tense endings
/ta/ to 16 “wug” roots (i.e. 8 ending with /e/ and
8 ending with /i/) and (ii) the 4 C-final past tense
endings (i.e. /tta/, /nda/, /ita/, and /ida/) to 4 “wug”
roots each, hence 16 V-final and 16 C-final past
tense forms. In the same vein, 32 present tense
forms of the “wug” roots were created as target
stimuli in the Present 7→ Past direction, by attach-
ing (i) the V-final present tense ending /ru/ to 16
“wug” roots (i.e. 8 ending with /e/ and 8 ending
with /i/) and (ii) the 8 C-final present tense end-
ings (i.e. /tu/, /u/, /mu/, /bu/, /nu/, /ku/, /su/, and
/gu/) to 2 “wug” roots each, hence 16 V-final and
16 C-final present tense forms. Note that the 4 V-
final past tense forms whose roots end with /hi/
and 2 C-final present tense forms ending with /nu/
turned out to be not attested in the training data
and thus excluded from the statistical analyses.

The 4 frames were also created in which the tar-
get stimuli are presented. Each frame consisted of
two sentences A and B. In the Present 7→ Past di-
rection, A sentences include present tense forms,
while B sentences contain a blank and elicit past
tense forms. In the Past 7→ Present direction, A
sentences include past tense forms, while B sen-
tences contain a blank and elicit present tense
forms. In order to make sure that the participants
produce target forms in B sentences, temporal ad-
verbs are placed at the sentence initial position to
maximally contrast sentences A and B. Specifi-
cally, A sentences constitute “Temporal Adverb
+ Proper Noun + Verb + Evidential”, whereas
B sentences “Temporal Adverb + Proper Noun +

+ Sentence Final Particle”, where the par-
ticipants are asked to inflect the Verb.

Procedure: The task was written production
“wug” test in the form of the questionnaire. At
the top of the questionnaire were some biograph-
ical questions such as (i) birthplaces of partici-
pants and their parents, (ii) whether participants
were born and grew up in Japan, and (iii) whether
parents spoke Japanese to participants at home.



173

The English translation of the original Japanese
instructions is reproduced below:

“This experiment examines your intu-
ition about Japanese. There are 2 blocks
and 48 questions in each block, where
both actual and novel verbs in Japanese
appear. For each question, please
change bold and underlined verbs of A
sentences to appropriate forms and com-
plete the underlined portion of B sen-
tences. Since there are no correct or in-
correct answers, please answer the ques-
tions based on your intuition without too
much reflection.”

The experiment was divided into two blocks,
corresponding to Present 7→ Past and Past 7→
Present directions, and the order of the two di-
rections was counterbalanced across participants.
At the beginning of each block were two example
questions with answers in B sentences completed,
one example with an actual verb and another with
a novel verb. The order of stimulus presentation
was randomized across participants by creating 2
random orders for each direction, hence 4 different
versions of randomization. The 16 actual verbs, 8
V-final and 8 C-final, were interspersed as fillers
in each block, on the condition that no more than
3 target stimuli were presented in sequence.

2.3 Statistical Analyses

Human accuracy: In contrast with the previous
“wug” tests, the human accuracies were explic-
itly evaluated against the MGL. The winning out-
puts with highest confidence scores were defined
as “correct” among possible outputs derived from
each input by the MGL. For example, suppose that
the MGL produced three possible outputs X, Y,
and Z for an input, among which X was the win-
ning output with the highest confidence score. If
the output X was produced by 30 participants, the
human accuracy would be 30/39 = .769.
Correlation between model and humans: The
correlation between model confidence scores and
human production probabilities were also ana-
lyzed (Albright and Hayes, 2003). The human
production probabilities can be simply computed
by dividing the frequencies of produced outputs by
the number of participants. Given the distribution
of human production probabilities being bimodal,
nonparametric Kendall’s rank correlation analyses

were performed in R between model confidence
scores and human production probabilities. The
outputs not produced by both model and humans
were not included in the correlation analyses.

3 Results

3.1 Model Complexity

The result of model complexity is summarized in
Table 2, where three model complexity metrics,
mean confidence score (π̄), mean confidence mar-
gin (∆̄), and mean confidence entropy (H̄), are
shown for each direction of verbal inflection:

Present 7→ Past Past 7→ Present
Mean confidence (π̄) .904 .959
Mean margin (∆̄) .724 .849
Mean entropy (H̄) .387 .294

Table 2: Result of model complexity

The three evaluation metrics all converge on the
conclusion that the Past 7→ Present direction is
computationally less complex than the Present 7→
Past direction: the mean confidence and margin
were higher, while the mean entropy was lower.
On closer inspection, the confidence scores of
possible outputs for /ru/-final present tense forms
were almost a tie in the Present 7→ Past direction,
which increased the mean entropy.

3.2 Human Accuracy

The result of human accuracy is summarized in
Table 3, where the accuracies of the current ex-
periment are shown for each direction of ver-
bal inflection and compared with six previous
“wug” tests (de Chene, 1982; Vance, 1987, 1991;
Klafehn, 2003, 2013):

Reference Modality Task Accuracy
de Chene (1982) oral production 46%
Vance (1987) written choice 51%
Vance (1991) written choice 63%
Klafehn (2003) written choice 53%
Klafehn (2013) oral production 32%
Present 7→ Past written production 48%
Past 7→ Present written production 72%

Table 3: Result of human accuracy

First, the accuracy of the Present 7→ Past direc-
tion (48%) is generally comparable to the litera-
ture, especially the oral production experiment by
(46%; de Chene, 1982), despite different partici-
pants and stimuli between the experiments. Sec-
ond, and more importantly, the accuracy of the



174

Past 7→ Present direction (72%) was significantly
higher than the literature, even the forced choice
experiments (Vance, 1987, 1991; Klafehn, 2003),
which would be regarded as “pass” on the assump-
tion that “the meaning of the word ‘pass’ is a 60%
or better score” (Klafehn, 2013).

3.3 Correlation Between Model and Humans

The result of correlation between the model and
humans is shown in Figure 1, where the x-axis is
the model confidence score computed by the MGL
(“Model confidence score”), whereas the y-axis
is the human production probability of the forms
produced by the experimental participants (“Hu-
man production probability”). Color represents
the Past 7→ Present (red) and Present 7→ Past (blue)
directions. Shape of the data points represents C-
final (circle; •) and V-final (triangle; N) roots. The
lines are the fitted linear models.

There were 1248 forms in total produced for
each direction (39 participants * 32 stimuli = 1248
forms). In the Past 7→ Present direction, 1225
forms were present tense forms, while 23 forms
were errors (i.e. non-present tense forms). Out of
the 1225 present tense forms, 956 forms were also
produced by the MGL. In the Present 7→ Past di-
rection, 1225 forms were past tense forms, while
23 forms were errors (i.e. non-past tense forms).
Out of the 1225 past tense forms, 821 forms were
also produced by the MGL. Kendall’s rank corre-
lation analyses revealed that the model confidence
scores and human production probabilities were
strongly correlated in the Past 7→ Present direc-
tion (z = 5.0618, τ = 0.534, p < 0.001***), but
only weakly in the Present 7→ Past direction (z =
2.3058, τ = 0.2448, p < 0.05*).

4 Discussion

In summary, the results demonstrated that (i) the
Past 7→ Present direction was computationally less
complex than the Present 7→ Past direction, (ii)
the Past 7→ Present direction was experimentally
more accurate than the Present 7→ Past direc-
tion, and (iii) the model and humans were cor-
related strongly in the Past 7→ Present direction,
but only weakly in the Present 7→ Past direc-
tion. The present work should be regarded as the
computational psycholinguistic approach to the
Paradigm Cell Filling Problem (Ackerman et al.,
2009) and, importantly, the result of model com-
plexity harmonizes well with the Low Entropy

Conjecture (Ackerman and Malouf, 2013), which
may in turn provides an insight into SIGMOR-
PHON Shared Task on morphological reinflection
(Cotterell et al., 2018). In the following, two the-
oretical implications will be discussed: the past
tense debate and language learning.

4.1 The Past Tense Debate

In the context of the past tense debate on rule
vs. analogy (Pinker and Ullman, 2002), three
logically possible models have been proposed in
the literature: the single route rule-based model
(Yang, 2002), the single route analogy-based
model (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986), and the
dual route model (Pinker and Prince, 1988). The
results above at least indicate that Japanese verbs
can be computed online via some generalizations
and those generalizations do depend on the direc-
tion of morphological inflection, contrary to the
conclusion of previous “wug” tests that Japanese
verbs are merely stored in the mental lexicon
(de Chene, 1982; Vance, 1987, 1991; Klafehn,
2003, 2013). However, although the MGL is
“rule-based”, the nature of those generalizations is
still an open question to be addressed via the sys-
tematic comparison with contemporary analogy-
based models such as Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN: Kirov and Cotterell, 2018) and Naive Dis-
criminative Learning (NDL: Baayen et al., 2011)
couched in Word and Paradigm models of mor-
phology (Stump, 2001; Blevins, 2006).

In addition, given the different strength of cor-
relation with the rule-based computational model
in two opposite directions, we can hypothesize
that the Past 7→ Present direction is rule-based,
while other directions including the Present 7→
Past direction is analogy-based. Then, follow-
ing the electroencephalography (EEG) experiment
by Kobayashi et al. (2012) who demonstrated that
rule and analogy are indexed by event-related po-
tential (ERP) components called LAN and N400,
respectively, we predict that the Past 7→ Present
direction is reflected by LAN, whereas the Present
7→ Past direction by N400. This prediction is sum-
marized in Table 4 and left for future research.

Past 7→ Present “pass” Symbolic Rule LAN
Present 7→ Past “fail” Neural Analogy N400

4.2 Human and Machine Language Learning

The results above further suggest that human
language learning can provide insights into ma-
chine language learning. Interestingly, the Past
7→ Present direction was motivated by not only
the language acquisition literature (Klafehn, 2003;
Murasugi et al., 2010; Hirose, 2017; Tatsumi et al.,
2018) but also artificial language learning by Yin
and White (2018) who show that humans have
an inductive bias against neutralization and ho-
mophony. In other words, the Past 7→ Present di-
rection is preferred to the Present 7→ Past direction
because the present tense forms of /r/, /t/, /w/-final
“wug” roots and /m/, /b/, /n/-final “wug” roots are
neutralized into the homonymous past tense forms
ending with /tta/ and /nda/, respectively.

Nevertheless, there were several limitations
with the current experiment. First, the assump-
tion that the training data is fed to the model in
pairs organized as paradigms is unrealistic due to
Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949), where paradigms are al-
most always incomplete in human language learn-
ing (Yang, 2017; Blevins et al., 2017). In or-
der to simulate realistic language learning, child-
directed speech (CDS) should be employed as the
training data, especially given that relative fre-
quencies of present and past tense forms seem

to be diverse (Tatsumi et al., 2018). Second,
the MGL is “rule-based” but learns only product-
oriented generalizations (Becker and Gouskova,
2016) in that present and past tense forms are
mapped to each other without underlying roots.
In order to test source-oriented generalizations
over underlying roots, morphological decompo-
sition must be implemented to retrieve the roots
from which present and past tense forms are de-
rived (Taft, 1979, 2004). Finally, different “wug”
roots were employed in two directions of verbal
inflection (though created similarly) so that differ-
ent results might be attributed to different roots,
which remains to be controlled in future.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, inspired by the acquisition litera-
ture (Klafehn, 2003; Murasugi et al., 2010; Hi-
rose, 2017; Tatsumi et al., 2018), we computa-
tionally simulated two directions of verbal inflec-
tion, Present 7→ Past and Past 7→ Present, with
the rule-based computational model called Mini-
mal Generalization Learner (MGL; Albright and
Hayes, 2003) and experimentally evaluated the
model with the bidirectional “wug” test where hu-
mans inflected novel verbs in two opposite direc-
tions, addressing the following questions:



176

1. Which direction is computationally less com-
plex for the model?

2. Which direction is experimentally more ac-
curate for humans?

3. In which direction do the model and humans
correlate more strongly?

The results revealed that (i) the Past 7→ Present
direction was computationally less complex than
the Present 7→ Past direction, (ii) the Past 7→
Present direction was experimentally more accu-
rate than the Present 7→ Past direction, and (iii)
the model and humans were correlated strongly in
the Past 7→ Present direction, but only weakly in
the Present 7→ Past direction. We conclude that
Japanese verbs can be computed online via some
generalizations (pace de Chene, 1982; Vance,
1987, 1991; Klafehn, 2003, 2013) and those gen-
eralizations do depend of the direction of morpho-
logical inflection.
