ABSTRACT
This paper provides an explicit, formal analysis of two not only interesting but also frequent
coordination phenomena: the coordination of unlike categories and the coordination of distinct
grammatical functions possibly belonging to entirely different levels of structure. The proposed
account of the former makes it possible to take full advantage of new generation valence
dictionaries which encode information about the possibility of such non-standard coordination,
creating new possibilities for existing grammar implementations. Furthermore, interactions
with complex phenomena such as case assignment are taken into consideration, providing a
solution which may be adopted for modelling similar phenomena in other languages. The other
variety of coordination addressed in this paper sheds some new light on coordination and how
it should be modelled. It demonstrates on the basis of attested data that coordination is subject
to fewer constraints than previously assumed and provides an elegant linguistically-motivated
solution employing currently available LFG mechanisms.

1 Introduction

During the last two decades of the previous millennium grammar engineering was solidly
placed within the core of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as also witnessed by the number
of papers devoted to this topic in COLING proceedings of 1980s and 1990s. While – in the
age of inductive NLP – this theme has almost disappeared from major conferences, grammar
engineering efforts, supported by new corpus-based methods, have continued, especially
within the HPSG1 and LFG2 communities, where large-scale multilingual grammar engineering
initiatives were set up: DELPH-IN (http://www.delph-in.net/) and PARGRAM (http:
//pargram.b.uib.no/). There has also been much progress during the last 15 years or
so in the theoretical linguistic foundations of these efforts, with flourishing HPSG and LFG
conferences and with analyses set up within these frameworks appearing in prestigious linguistic
journals.

One of the topics that has received much attention in formal theoretical linguistics is coordina-
tion, a phenomenon which is not only theoretically challenging, but also – due to its textual
frequency – crucial to grammar engineering. Unfortunately, as coordination remains difficult to
describe accurately and exhaustively, this theoretical interest is not fully reflected in existing
grammar implementations.

The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive implementation of constituent coordination,
a part of an ongoing effort to develop a wide-coverage LFG parser of Polish (Patejuk and
Przepiórkowski, 2012b). Polish is a good test-bed for the task at hand, as it offers a wide range
of interactions between coordination on one hand and various agreement, case assignment and
valence phenomena on the other.

One aspect of coordination that has remained especially elusive in grammar engineering is
the possibility to coordinate elements which are unlike in some sense. Polish offers a much
wider range of unlike constituent coordination than has been discussed in NLP, including the
so-called lexico-semantic coordination (Kallas 1993; Chaves and Paperno 2007; Gazdik 2010),
i.e., the coordination of very unlikes, where coordinated items do not even represent the same
grammatical function. While such cases go against any comprehensive analysis of coordination
we are aware of, they are textually frequent and therefore should be taken into account in any
wide-coverage grammar implementation effort.

Note that, for reasons of space, we do not provide here an analysis of non-constituent coordi-
nation, as in give a teacher an apple and a policeman a flower (Steedman, 2000, p.46).3 This
subtype of coordination has an elegant analysis in different versions of categorial grammars,
while it remains troublesome for many other grammatical theories. Within LFG, a compre-
hensive analysis of non-constituent coordination is offered in Maxwell and Manning 1996. In
fact, while the LFG analysis seems to cover roughly the same patch as categorial grammar
analyses, Maxwell and Manning (1996) claim that it is superior,4 as it provides more natural
accounts of cases such as You may call me directly or after 3pm through my secretary and She
put a lamp on the table, and on the ledge a large antique punchbowl, which are difficult because
coordinated elements are not only non-constituents, but they also differ in the number and order
of constituents. The analysis of the current paper may be extended to cover non-constituent

coordination along the lines of Maxwell and Manning 1996.

2 Basics: Coordination of ‘like’ categories

The usual intuition behind implementations of coordination is that, wherever some phrase type
XP (e.g., a nominal phrase) may occur, a coordination of XP-like elements (i.e., of nominal
phrases) may occur instead. In LFG, this intuition is expressed via constituency rules:

(1) XP → XP Conj XP
↓∈↑ ↓∈↑

LFG makes a distinction between c(onstituent)-structure and f(unctional)-structure (among
other linguistic levels). Annotations of elements of c-structure rules, such as ↓∈↑, are used to
construct corresponding f-structures. In this case, the two conjuncts are elements of the set
representing the mother. For example, when used to parse the Polish sentence (2), the above
rule constructs the set representation of the subject of the sentence, as in (3).5

(2) Idą
walk.PL

Jan
Jan.SG

i
and

Marysia.
Marysia.SG

‘Jan and Marysia walk.’

(3)
§h

PRED ‘JAN’
i
,
h

PRED ‘MARYSIA’
iª

This simple example also illustrates the immediate weakness of the basic intuition given above:
neither the singular Jan, nor the singular Marysia alone can directly replace the coordination
Jan i Marysia, as this would lead to number disagreement with the plural verb. Because of
such agreement facts, coordinate structures are represented in LFG as hybrid feature structures,
which contain sets such as (3), but may also contain their own features (Dalrymple and Kaplan,
2000); a fuller representation of the subject of (2) would be (4).

3 Basics: Coordination of ‘unlike’ categories

An influential paper that demonstrated that the assumption of ‘likeness’ of coordinated elements
is too strong is Sag et al. 1985, set within GPSG.6 Under their analysis, examples (5)–(7) are
grammatical because both conjuncts satisfy the underspecified requirements which hold for the
syntactic position they occupy.

(5) That was a rude remark and in very bad taste.

(6) We walked slowly and with great care.

(7) Pat became a republican and quite conservative.

5The attribute PRED stands for PREDICATE and represents the basic predicate-argument structure of a given element.
Here both predicates ‘JAN’ and ‘MARYSIA’ have no arguments.

6Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar; cf. Gazdar et al. 1985.

2193



(8) *Tracy has become a republican and of the opinion that we must place nuclear weapons
in Europe.

For example, the verb BE, as in (5), only requires that its complement be predicative, [PRD +],
and both conjuncts a rude remark and in very bad taste are [PRD +] (apart from being a noun
phrase and a prepositional phrase, respectively). Similarly, the adjunct in (6) is specified as
[MANNER +], and again both conjuncts, although categorially unlike, are [MANNER +]. On the
other hand, the verb BECOME puts stronger restrictions on its complement: not only should it
be predicative, but also nominal, [N +], in the sense that nouns and adjectives are nominal,
while prepositions and verbs are not (they are marked as [N −]). Hence, (7), involving two
predicative nominal conjuncts (a noun phrase and an adjectival phrase), is grammatical, while
(8), involving a [N −] conjunct (the prepositional of the opinion. . . ) is not.
In order for this analysis to work, the theory needs to implement a notion of feature structure
subsumption. In GPSG such a notion is hardwired into the Head Feature Convention (cf. Sag
et al. 1985, § 2.4). Attempts have also been made to carry over these subsumption-based
insights into HPSG, but they require certain extensions of the formal apparatus assumed within
HPSG; two such analyses are proposed in Sag 2002 and Yatabe 2004.

Despite the fact that LFG offers interesting analyses of various aspects of coordination (Maxwell
and Manning 1996 on non-constituent coordination; Dalrymple and Kaplan 2000 and Dalrymple
et al. 2009 on how coordination influences the representation of features such as person, gender
and case; Dalrymple and Nikolaeva 2006, Kuhn and Sadler 2007, and Dalrymple and Hristov
2010 on the interaction between coordination and agreement), there is surprisingly little explicit
discussion of coordination of unlike constituents. The assumption seems to be that, at the level
of c-structure, there are no categorial constraints on conjuncts, i.e., instead of (1) above, the
relevant rule would rather resemble (9) below (cf. Peterson 2004, p. 652).

(9) XP → YP Conj ZP
↓∈↑ ↓∈↑

In LFG, any appearances of categorial ‘likeness’ are a side effect of constraints imposed at the
functional level of representation. For example, in Polish, subjects are typically nominative (but
see below), a fact which may be expressed via (10).7

(10) (↑ SUBJ CASE) =c NOM
In fact, on standard LFG assumptions, nothing more is required to ensure that both conjuncts
in (2) are nominative. This is because LFG distinguishes between distributive features, such
as CASE, and non-distributive features, such as NUM(BER) (Dalrymple and Kaplan, 2000). The
former distribute over all elements of coordination, so the specification CASE = NOM for the
outer hybrid feature structure in (11) results in CASE = NOM on all conjuncts within the set.

7The constraining equation, expressed by ‘=c ’, verifies that the equality holds, rather than assigning a value, as in
case of the operator ‘=’.

2194



Using these mechanisms, it is simple to implement in LFG an analysis similar to that of Sag et al.
1985. For example, part of the lexical entry of the verb BE might be: (↑ OBJ PRD) = +. Assuming
that PRD8 is a distributive feature, the requirement that the object be predicative will percolate
to all conjuncts, without predetermining their categorial status, and thus accounting for (5).

4 Towards an LFG analysis of the coordination of unlikes

At the end of the paper, Sag et al. (1985) discuss cases of coordination of an NP with a clause
(p. 165):

(12) Pat remembered the appointment and that it was important to be on time.

(13) That Himmler appointed Heydrich and the implications thereof frightened many ob-
servers.

The analysis they propose is far from elegant and it involves, inter alia, the assumption that such
clauses are in a sense NPs. Apparently, they are attempting to avoid a disjunctive specification
of the verb’s argument, one that would state that, e.g., the object of the verb REMEMBER is either
an NP or a clause (or a coordination of such elements).

When other languages are taken into consideration, it turns out that such disjunctive specifica-
tions are inevitable. For example, Kosek 1999, pp. 43–44, cites the following:

(14) Owinął
wrapped

dziecko
baby

w
in

koc
blanket.ACC

i
and

ręcznikiem.
towel.INST

‘He wrapped the baby in a blanket and in a towel.’

(15) Nadajesz się
are fit

do
for

tej
this

pracy
job

i
and

na
for

dyrektora.
manager

‘You are fit for this job and for a manager.’

Prepositional phrases involved in these examples must be headed by the specific prepositions
W, DO and NA, and the NP in (14) must be in the instrumental case. It seems highly unlikely
that the intuitive disjunctive specifications ‘PP[w] ∨ NP[inst]’ (for (14)) and ‘PP[do] ∨ PP[na]’
(for (15)) could be replaced by non-disjunctive specifications capturing putative commonalities
between, for instance, PP[w] and NP[inst] (to the exclusion of other types of phrases).

It turns out that such disjunctive specifications are also problematic for LFG. The obvious way
to formalise the requirements of the verb OWINĄĆ ‘wrap’, as in (14), would be:9

(16) (↑ OBL CASE) = INST ∨ (↑ OBL PFORM) = W
Unfortunately, the statement (16) does not have the intended meaning. Because of the
distributivity of CASE (and, presumably, PFORM, which stands for ‘prepositional form’), the
statement, when applied to a coordinate complement, has the following effect: either all
conjuncts are instrumental, or all conjuncts have the prepositional form W. Making (any of)
these features non-distributive does not solve the problem, as it would only render the relevant
constraints inapplicable to individual conjuncts.

8Not to be confused with ‘PRED’.
9We use here ‘∨’ to mark disjunction, instead of the ‘|’ usual in the LFG literature; similarly, we explicitly mark

conjunction with ‘∧’ instead of leaving it implicit.

2195



There is, however, a solution which does not require extending the formal apparatus of LFG,
although it is based on a relatively rarely used LFG mechanism, namely, the so-called off-path
constraints (Dalrymple, 2001, p. 148).10

Off-path constraints make it possible to restrict the path (or, more importantly, its part) used by
other statements. For example, while the minimal feature structure satisfying (17) is that of
(18), the statement (19), with an off-path constraint added to the attribute A, specifies (20).11

(17) (↑ A B C) =c + (18)
�

A



(19) (↑ A B C) =c +
(← D) =c E

(20)

A

D E




More formally, ‘←’ denotes the f-structure which contains the attribute to which it is attached,
while ‘→’ denotes the f-structure which is the value of the attribute to which it is attached.
Hence, (21) (i.e., with ‘←’ above replaced by ‘→’) specifies the structure in (22).
(21) (↑ A B C) =c +

(→ D) =c E
(22)






The last piece of puzzle necessary to successfully analyse coordination of unlikes in LFG is the
standard possibility to require the existence of a certain feature (whatever its value) in a feature
structure: for example, (↑ PRED), without any equality sign, requires that the feature PRED be
present in the feature structure being described. Given that PRED is a distributive feature, this
specification forces all conjuncts to contain PRED (i.e., they must be semantically non-vacuous).

Returning to the failed attempt to formalise a disjunctive constraint in (16), let us note that the
problem occurs because the disjunction is understood too early: instead of being interpreted
as “for every conjunct, either. . . or. . . ”, it means: “either for every conjunct. . . , or for every
conjunct. . . ”. What is needed is a means of ‘smuggling’ the disjunction into conjuncts before it
is interpreted. Off-path constraints provide a mechanism to achieve this.

The relevant statement, replacing (16), is given below:

(23) (↑ OBL PRED )
(← CASE) =c INST ∨ (← PFORM) =c W

(23) ensures that – in Polish – there are no semantically vacuous (expletive) oblique comple-
ments, i.e., each such complement has a PRED value. This part of the statement is trivial. The
main import of the statement is given in the off-path constraint part: for each such PRED, either
the value of the CASE attribute (at the same level as the PRED) is instrumental, or the value of
PFORM (again, at the same level) is W. As a result, disjunction is interpreted independently for
each conjunct.

10We would like to thank Mary Dalrymple for suggesting to us that off-path constraints could be used to account for
the coordination of unlikes, namely, for Polish unlike category subjects. (The usual disclaimers apply.) Przepiórkowski
and Patejuk 2012 presents this analysis – and an alternative account – in more detail.

11Note that off-path constraints are placed below the attribute to which they apply.

2196



5 Interactions with case assignment

Polish is a morphologically rich language with 7 grammatical cases. While case values of some
arguments are stable and do not change with the syntactic environment (such case values
are said to be assigned lexically or inherently), other case values depend on the syntactic
context, e.g., the presence of negation or the categorial status of the argument. The syntactic
(or structural) case assignment facts may be partially summarised as follows:12

(24) a. subjects bearing structural case are in the nominative,

b. with the exception of numeral phrase subjects, headed by so-called governing
numerals (see below), which are in the accusative;

(25) a. objects bearing structural case are in the accusative,

b. unless they are in the syntactic scope of sentential negation, in which case they are
in the genitive (so-called Genitive of Negation, GoN).

It should be possible to model these facts in a straightforward way by case assignment statements
such as the following (for (24) above):13

(26) [(↑ SUBJ ACM) =c REC ∧ (↑ SUBJ CASE) =c ACC] ∨ (↑ SUBJ CASE) =c NOM
In this statement, ACM represents accommodability, a lexical feature introduced for Polish by
Bień and Saloni (1982) to distinguish numeral forms governing the genitive noun (the value of
ACM in such cases is REC) from numeral forms agreeing with the following noun.

Although, again, (26) does not have the intended meaning (its effect is that either all conjuncts
are accusative numeral phrases or they are all nominative), the following version does the trick:

(27) (↑ SUBJ PRED )
[(← ACM) =c REC ∧ (← CASE) =c ACC] ∨ (← CASE) =c NOM

Such statements are successful in handling coordinate arguments, as in the example below.14

(28) [Pan Mirosław]
Mr Mirosław.NOM.SG

i
and

[czternastu
fourteen.ACC.PL

ludzi]
man.GEN.PL

pracowało
worked.3.SG.N

dzień
day

i
and

noc.
night

‘Mr Mirosław and fourteen men worked night and day.’ (NKJP)

On the other hand, just as in English, some Polish verbs allow for either an NP or a clause (or
their coordination) in an argument position (here: subject); a relevant example is given below:

(29) Jana
Jan.ACC

dziwiło,
puzzled.3.SG.N

[że
that

Maria
Maria

wybiera
chooses

Piotra],
Piotr

i
and

[jej brak gustu].
her lack of taste.NOM.SG

‘(The fact) that Maria prefers Piotr and her lack of taste puzzled Jan.’
(Świdziński, 1992, 1993)

For such verbs, the following constraint holds:

12See Przepiórkowski 1999 for extensive justification. We limit our considerations to arguments of verbs here.
13Where necessary, square brackets are used for the purpose of grouping constraints.
14“NKJP” marks attested examples found in the National Corpus of Polish (http://nkjp.pl/; Przepiórkowski

et al. 2010, 2012).

2197



(30) (↑ SUBJ PRED )
[(← ACM) =c REC ∧ (← CASE) =c ACC] ∨
(← CASE) =c NOM ∨ (← COMP-FORM) =c ŻE

A similar account can be offered for syntactically case-assigned objects, which – for some verbs
– may be alternatively realised as clauses. Consider the following examples:

(31) Doradził
advised

mu
him

[wyjazd]
leave.ACC

i
and

[żeby
that

nie
NEG

wracał].
come back

‘He advised him to leave and not to come back.’ Kallas (1993)

(32) (Wcale)
not at all

nie
NEG

doradził
advised

mu
him

[wyjazdu]
leave.GEN

ani
nor
[żeby
that

nie
NEG

wracał].
come back

‘He did not advise him to leave nor not to come back.’

These examples illustrate the principles of structural case assignment in Polish referring to
objects (see (25) above): verbs assign accusative case to nominal objects in the absence of
negation, as in (31), while genitive is assigned if negation is present, see (32). This basic
principle is formalised in (33).

(33) (↑ OBJ PRED )
[¬((OBJ ←) NEG) ∧ (← CASE)=c ACC] ∨
[((OBJ ←) NEG)=c + ∧ (← CASE)=c GEN]

However, in case of verbs such as DORADZIĆ ‘advise’, as in (32), another disjunct must be added,
allowing for a clausal object:

(34) (↑ OBJ PRED )
[¬((OBJ ←) NEG) ∧ (← CASE)=c ACC] ∨
[((OBJ ←) NEG)=c + ∧ (← CASE)=c GEN] ∨

(← COMP-FORM) =c ŻEBY
Again, the distributive feature PRED is used as an anchor so that disjunctive off-path constraints
are checked against each element of OBJ independently (so, each conjunct under coordination).
Note that a combination of outside-in (used so far) and inside-out equations is employed
in (33)–(34). The former designate a path leading downwards into the f-structure, the latter
make it possible to construct a path leading in the opposite direction, namely to higher f-
structures; ‘(OBJ ←)’ creates a path starting from the f-structure designated by ‘←’, leading
to the one which contains OBJ. Paths constructed in this way may be used as designators in
outside-in equations as in the first disjunct of (33)–(34) which requires that the particular
OBJ f-structure be marked for accusative case and that there be no negation in the f-structure
containing OBJ (see ‘¬((OBJ ←) NEG)’). The second disjunct uses the same mechanisms to
ensure that a given OBJ f-structure be marked for genitive case and that there be negation in
the f-structure which contains OBJ (see ‘((OBJ ←) NEG)=c +’).15

6 Implications for valence lexicons

Any adequate account of coordination of unlike categories implies a certain organisation of the
valence dictionary, i.e., a lexicon recording information about arguments of predicates. Such a

15This solution may be extended to handle optional GoN under transferred negation in verb chains. This is achieved
using functional uncertainty in relevant off-path constraints.

2198



lexicon should make it clear whether arguments in the same position can be coordinated.

Note that it is not enough to know that various categorial kinds of arguments bear the same
grammatical function in relation to the predicate. For example, the Polish verb MÓWIĆ ‘say,
speak’ takes as its (passivisable) object the following categories, among others: oratio recta
(direct speech; marked as or below), prepositional phrase headed by O and requiring a locative
phrase (prepnp(o,loc)), subordinate finite clause introduced by the complementiser ŻE
(cp(»e)), embedded question (cp(intrel)), etc. While various of these possible objects may
be coordinated, apparently an oratio recta object cannot be coordinated with any other category.
This calls for postulating two different subcategorisation frames: one involving an oratio recta
object, and another involving other kinds of objects.

Valence dictionaries we are aware of, Polish or otherwise, do not include such ‘coordinatability’
information. However, a new valence dictionary, Walenty,16 is being developed for Polish which
encodes such information explicitly. In this valence dictionary, any frame allowing for the
coordination of unlikes is accompanied by an attested example, usually from the National
Corpus of Polish. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the application assisting in the creation of this
dictionary.

showing subcategorisation frames for MÓWIĆ ‘say, speak’: one involving an oratio recta object
(near the top), and another involving an object which may be realised as a prepositional phrase,
an embedded clause, etc. (in the bottom). An example from the National Corpus of Polish,
illustrating the possibility to coordinate prepnp(o,loc) and cp(intrel) is provided at the
very bottom.

7 Coordination of very unlikes

Standard coordination of unlike categories involves elements which bear the same grammatical
function. For example, in (12) above, both the appointment and that it was important to be on
time correspond to the direct object of remembered. However, in some languages and under
certain circumstances it is possible to coordinate elements bearing starkly different grammatical
functions, as in Polish (35), involving coordination of the subject and the direct object of the
verb uczył ‘teach’.

(35) Kto
who.NOM

i
and

kogo
who.ACC

będzie
will

uczył?
teach

‘Who will teach whom?’ (NKJP)

To the best of our knowledge, such cases, called in English – after Mel’čuk 1988, p. 40 – lexico-
semantic coordination or – as in Chaves and Paperno 2007, who provide a preliminary HPSG
analysis – hybrid coordination, were first described for Russian (and in Russian) in Sannikov
1979, 1980, and for Polish (and in Polish) in Kallas 1993. Similar data are also discussed for
French and Hungarian, and given the first LFG account, in Gazdik 2010 (only for wh-words,
though).

Examination of Polish data reveals that such coordination is more robust than previously
described in the literature. First of all, elements which enter lexico-semantic coordination are
not only wh-phrases, as in (35), but also phrases containing a pronoun expressing an existential
quantifier, a universal quantifier or phrases with n-words, as in (36), (37) and (38), respectively.

‘Nothing may excuse anybody.’ (NKJP)

Second, as already evidenced in (38), and contra theoretical assumptions of the HPSG and LFG
analyses mentioned above, the coordinated elements may be dependents of different predicates.
This is more clearly illustrated in (39), where skąd ‘where from’ is an adjunct of the verb
otrzymujemy ‘receive’ and jakie ‘what kind’ is a modifier of the noun informacje ‘information’.

(39) Skąd
whence

i
and

jakie
what

otrzymujemy
receive

informacje?
information

‘What information and where from do we receive?’ (NKJP)

While coordinated elements may be dependents of different heads, the semantics of (35)–(39)
is that of a single clause; for example, (35) may be translated into ‘Who will teach whom?’, and
not into ‘Who will teach (somebody) and whom will (somebody) teach?’. Moreover, when the
conjunction is i ‘and’, it may often be omitted, without any obvious change of meaning:

2200



(40) Kto
who.NOM

kogo
who.ACC

będzie
will

uczył?
teach

‘Who will teach whom?’

This is reflected in the implemented LFG analysis, where the main c-structure rule handling
lexico-semantic coordination is (41), where type is a parameter which may assume the following
values: WH (question word; cf. (35) and (39)), ANY (existential quantifier; cf. (36)), ALL
(universal quantifier; cf. (37)), NEG (n-word; cf. (38)).

(41) XPlexsem-monotype → XPextrtype [, XPextrtype]∗ CONJ XPextrtype
↑=↓ ↑=↓ ↑=↓

According to this rule, the f-structure of each extracted phrase of a given type is identified
with the f-structure of the mother. This is achieved using the ‘↑=↓’ annotation on all conjuncts
which treats them as co-heads: f-structure fragments built by particular conjuncts, see (42),
are unified in one top-level f-structure, resulting in (43). The latter, once it is unified with the
f-structure of the rest of the utterance, renders (44).

The complete analysis, which is not given here in detail for lack of space (e.g., the definition
of XPtype is omitted), also includes the rule (45) which, together with (46)–(47), encodes
appropriate locality (or island) constraints on the provenance of coordinated phrases.17 While
(46) defines the set of grammatical functions which may be assigned to a given element, (47)
defines the main extraction path of such elements: they may be extracted across any number of
infinitival complements (XCOMP) and, below that, across any number of grammatical functions
GF, but – crucially – not across finite sentential complements, etc.18 Since each conjunct resolves
its functional annotation independently, it is possible for every conjunct to bear entirely different
grammatical function and depend on different heads, as in (42a) vs (42b).

(45) XPextrtype → XPtype
(↑ PATH GF+)=↓

(46) GF ≡ {SUBJ|OBJ|OBJθ|OBL|ADJ ∈}
(47) PATH ≡ XCOMP∗

Let us finish this section with the observation that there is a subtype of lexico-semantic coordi-
nation which is not amenable to the above analysis:

17The complete analysis is presented in Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2012a.
18For wh-phrases (47) is extended to allow for extraction from sentential complements: PATH ≡ COMP∗ XCOMP∗, to

account for examples such as Kto i kogo chciałés, żeby zaprosił? ‘Who did you want to invite whom?’, lit.: ‘who and
whom you-wanted that invite.FIN’.

‘It was not clear whether and when (s)he would return.’ (NKJP)

As indicated by the asterisk and the parentheses, this example is ungrammatical once the
conjunction i is omitted. Moreover, the meaning of the embedded question is biclausal: ‘It was
not clear whether (s)he would return, and – if (s)he did – when (s)he would return.’ Such
cases, where the first conjunct in the lexico-semantic coordination is the question particle czy,
are handled by the following c-structure rule:19

(49) XPlexsem-biwh → PARTwh [, XPextrwh]∗ CONJ XPextrwh
↓∈↑ ↓∈↑ ↓∈↑

The crucial difference between (41) and (49) is that f-structures of the conjuncts in the latter
are not identified with the mother, but become elements of the set representation of the mother;
cf. the representation of the conjuncts in (50) and the resulting coordination in (51).

8 Towards evaluation

As mentioned in the Introduction, coordination is textually frequent, so any parser should be
able to handle it. But exactly how frequent is it?

There are two balanced subcorpora within the National Corpus of Polish: one – let us call
it NKJP1M – is manually annotated and contains around 1 million words, another one –
NKJP250M – contains 250 million words tagged automatically. As shown in Table 1, depending
on which subcorpus is used to gather statistics, between 37.5% and 38.7% of all sentences
involve coordination, which amply justifies the claim advanced in the Introduction.

It is considerably more difficult to estimate how many of these coordinate structures involve
unlike categories. Instead, let us concentrate on cases of lexico-semantic coordination, which
are easier to find automatically. Of these, undoubtedly the most frequent – and the ones most
readily noticed in the linguistic literature – are cases of coordination of wh-phrases, as in (35)
and (39) above. This subtype of lexico-semantic coordination is especially important in NLP, for
example, in question answering, where Polish users will naturally use such constructions.

19There are examples where the question particle is the last conjunct. Handling these requires simple modifications.

2202



# of sentences % of sentences

NKJP1M 85 663 44 841 32 147 37.5
NKJP250M 18 625 185 10 455 657 7 210 648 38.7

Table 1: The number of conjunctions and the percentage of sentences containing conjunctions
in balanced subcorpora of the National Corpus of Polish.

In NKJP250M, there are 272 results of the query ‘Kto [orth="i|lub|oraz|albo"]
[orth!=co/i]’, where kto means ‘who’ (nominative), i, lub, oraz and albo are the most
frequent conjunctions, and co means ‘what’ (nominative or accusative); the last part of this
query ensures that structures like Kto i co, i.e., possibly involving two nominative phrases, are
not among the reported results.20 Compared to over 18 million sentences of NKJP250M, this
number seems to be infinitesimal, but note that this is only one subtype of wh-lexico-semantic
coordination; Gdzie i. . . ‘where and. . . ’ occurs 157 times, Komu i. . . ‘who.DAT and’ occurs 47
times, etc.21 These numbers are sufficiently large to show that this is not a marginal construction
in Polish.

The LFG grammar of Polish (Patejuk and Przepiórkowski, 2012b), which includes the analysis
of coordination sketched above, is implemented in the XLE system developed at PARC.22 It
is based on two previous implemented grammars of Polish: its c-structure is based on a DCG
(Warren and Pereira, 1980) grammar used by the parser Świgra (Świdziński, 1992; Woliński,
2004, 2005), while its f-structure is inspired by an HPSG grammar (Przepiórkowski et al., 2002;
Marciniak et al., 2003). The quality of the grammar is ensured in a two-fold way: using treebank
testing, but also verifying the linguistic coverage against manually constructed testsuites.

The former takes the form of reparsing Składnica (Woliński et al., 2011), a treebank of Polish
containing parses for sentences extracted from the manually annotated subcorpus of the
National Corpus of Polish and parsed using Świgra. The treebank coverage of the LFG grammar
amounts to 90%. Unfortunately, the current version of Składnica contains sentences which were
relatively unproblematic for Świgra and for human annotators, i.e., it is skewed towards simple
and short sentences. In particular, coordination is underrepresented in general (1869 out of
8227 sentences, or 22.7%, contain conjunctions), and no cases of lexico-semantic coordination
were found by the authors.23 The complete NKJP1M, from which Składnica draws its sentences,
does contain instances of lexico-semantic coordination, e.g., Kto i dlaczego boi się prywatyzacji?
‘Who and why is afraid of privatisation?’.

While Składnica currently contains good parses for 8227 sentences, it contains many more
sentences for which human annotators could not identify a good parse among the trees

20The query syntax is described in more detail at http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/help/en.html.
21Also note that such queries only find cases of coordination of two wh-phrases, while – as expected – it is possible

to coordinate more of them, as in the attested (NKJP) Gdzie, jak i za ile będą się bawíc, lit. ‘Where, how and for how
much will they have fun’. Since the first word is capitalised, such queries also do not target embedded questions.

22Maxwell and Kaplan 1996; http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/xle/
23The treebank search engine available at http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl:8000/ui.xhtml has been employed,

and queries such as ‘[base = /kto/ & orth = /K.*/]’ were given, which should find any capitalised form of
the pronoun KTO ‘who’. Out of 39 sentences beginning with a form of KTO, 57 beginning with a form of CO ‘what’, 22
beginning with KIEDY ‘when’, 21 beginning with DLACZEGO ‘why’ and 5 beginning with GDZIE ‘where’, none contained
lexico-semantic coordination.

2203



generated by the DCG grammar. It is hoped that extensions related to coordination, including
the two described above, make it possible to parse sentences which have been rejected so far
due to the limitations of the previous grammar and its valence dictionary, which did not take
coordination of unlikes into consideration.

The other method of testing relies on constructed sentences: currently there are over 1200
items which provide a means of comprehensive grammar testing, making it possible to test a
wide range of phenomena, ensuring proper handling of fundamental issues, but also giving
an opportunity to test very sophisticated phenomena where complex interactions between
various areas of the grammar are involved. Also, while treebank testing is limited to positive
examples exclusively, there are numerous negative examples among constructed testsuite
items. This testsuite is currently being extended with examples of unlike and lexico-semantic
coordination, so no quantitative results can be cited here (they should be available by the
time of COLING 2012), but the grammar correctly parses any sentences involving such difficult
instances of coordination that we have come across.

Conclusion

While currently a niche activity in NLP, grammar engineering is actively pursued and finds
high-profile applications, such as the use of the English LFG grammar in Microsoft’s Bing search
engine.24 Since coordination is textually very frequent, any self-respecting grammar should
allow for a comprehensive treatment of this phenomenon. The analysis presented above, taking
into account not only run of the mill cases of coordination, but also coordination of unlike and
very unlike constituents, is implemented within a large LFG grammar of Polish.

It must be stressed, however, that – although the details of the interaction of coordination
with case assignment and other phenomena vary from language to language – the general
mechanisms described in sections 4–7 seem to be applicable to any language. In particular,
coordination of unlikes has been by now reported for many languages, syntactic case assignment
mechanisms which interact with coordination can be observed in Slavic, Baltic and Finno-Ugric
languages (to limit ourselves to European languages), and lexico-semantic coordination has
been described for French, Hungarian, Romanian and a number of Slavic languages.

Due to space constraints, many aspects of the implementation of coordination in the LFG
grammar of Polish have been omitted here. Probably the most important is agreement between
the verb (or, more generally, a predicate) and its coordinated subject, but also the interesting
phenomenon of single conjunct agreement. However, unlike coordination of unlikes, these
phenomena already have established accounts in the LFG literature, e.g., Dalrymple and
Nikolaeva 2006, Kuhn and Sadler 2007 and Dalrymple et al. 2009, and their standard analyses
are implemented in the current grammar. The first stable version of the grammar will be made
publicly available by the end of January 2013 at http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/LFG.
