Abstract 

Weibo messages sentiment polarity classifi-

cation towards given topics refers to that the 

machine automatically classifies whether the 

weibo message is of positive, negative, or 

neutral sentiment towards the given topic. 

The algorithm the sentiment analysis system 

CUCsas adopts to perform this task includes 

three steps: (1) whether there is an “exp” 

(short for “expression having evaluation 
meaning”) in the weibo message; (2) whether 
there is a semantic orientation relationship 

between the exp and topic; (3) the sentiment 

polarity classification of the exp. CUCsas 

completes step (1) based on the sentiment 

lexicon and sentiment value assignment rules, 

completes step (2) based on the topic extrac-

tion and sentiment polarity classification rule 

base, and completes step (3) based on the 

sentiment computing rules. Taking 20 given 

topics and a total of 19,469 weibo messages 

released by SIGHAN-2015 Bake-off as the 
test data, the overall F value of the rule-based 

system CUCsas is 0.69 in the unrestricted test. 

1 Algorithm Description 

The locutionary subjectivity denotes the locutio-

nary agent’s self-expression of cognition, feeling 

or perception in the use of language (John Lyons, 
1995). And the evaluation is one type of locutio-

nary subjectivity. An evaluation discourse con-

sists of four basic elements: E(s) = {sub, obj, exp, 
com}. Herein, “E(s)” represents an evaluation 

discourse, and “sub”, “obj”, “exp” and “com” 

refers to the subject of evaluation, the object of 

evaluation, an expression having evaluation 
meaning, and other discourse components re-

spectively (Zhou Hongzhao et al., 2014). The 

study of this paper is under the condition of 
knowing obj (= the given topic) in the weibo 

message, enabling the system automatically rec-

ognize whether there is an exp in the same weibo 

message. If there is not, the system will output 
result [topic: 0]; if there is, the system will make 

a further identification that whether there is a 

semantic orientation relationship between the 
exp and the given topic. If there is not, the sys-

tem will outputs result [topic 0]; if there is, the 

system will further classify the sentiment polarity 
of the exp. If it is positive, the system will output 

result [topic 1]; if it is negative, the system will 

output result [topic -1]; if it is neutral, the system 

will output result [topic 0]. Apparently, the algo-
rithm is different from some widely used ma-

chine learning sentiment polarity classification 

algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes, Max Entropy, 
Boosted Trees and Random Forest (Amit Gupte 

et al., 2014). Figure 1 shows the algorithm of the 

the system of rule-based weibo messages senti-
ment polarity classification towards given topics. 

Example (1) <weibo>:三星发布 Galaxy S6 和

S6 Edge，下月正式开卖。</weibo> (There is 

no exp in the weibo message. → Output: 0) 

149



Example (2) <weibo>:评论员手好丑,评论的

也很垃圾,不看了//【视频：三星 GALAXY S6

初体验】</weibo> (There are exps “好丑” and 

“垃圾” in the weibo message. → But there is no 
semantic orientation relationship between the 

exps and the given topic “三星 S6”. → Output: 0) 

Example (3) <weibo>:三星 s6 奇丑无比，边

框还仿苹果。</weibo> (There is an exp “奇丑

无比 ” in the weibo message. → There is a 
semantic orientation relationship between the 

exp and the given topic “三星 S6”. → The 
sentiment polarity of the exp is negative. → 
Output: -1) 

Example (4) <weibo>:HTC One M9 与三星

的 S6 哪个更惊艳？</weibo> (There is an exp 

“惊艳” in the weibo message. → There is a 
semantic orientation relationship between the 

exp and the given topic “三星 S6”. → The 
sentiment polarity of the exp is neutral in the 
weibo message context. → Output: 0)

Sentiment Polarity Classification 

2 The Automatic Recognition of the 
Exp in the Weibo Message 

From the perspective of linguistics, the exp can 

be divided into three broad categories, including 

six specific types.  

(1) Category one 
<1> Type one: the context-free evaluation 

word or phrase 

Feature: Independent of context, it expresses 

positive or negative evaluation meaning by itself. 

Sentiment marker: po or ne 

Examples: 漂亮、败类、狗仗人势 
Total in the sentiment lexicon: 26,042 

(2) Category two: the context-sensitive evalua-
tion word or phrase 

Feature: Whether it expresses evaluation 

meaning or not depends on the context. 
<2> Type two: the commendatory potential 

word 

Feature: When modified by the degree word, it 

can express positive evaluation meaning.  
Semantic marker: pxn 

Examples: 规范、人道、man 
Total in the semantic lexicon: 51 

<3> Type three: the derogatory potential word 

Feature: When modified by the degree word, it 

can express negative evaluation meaning.  
Semantic marker: nxn 

Examples: 封建、一般、2 
Total in the semantic lexicon: 18 

<4> Type four: the meaning-shifting noun 

Feature: When modified by the affirmative 

word such as 有 or 具有, it expresses positive 
evaluation meaning; when modified by the nega-

tive word such as 没有 or 毫无, it expresses neg-
ative evaluation meaning. 

Semantic marker: ypn 

Examples: 诚信、效率、素质 
Total in the semantic lexicon: 198 

<5> Type five: the adjective of weights and 
measures 

Feature: When combined with the product 

attribute or human character word, the adjective 

of weights and measures, such as 高、低、大、

小, can express evaluation meaning. 

Examples: 清晰度+高、油耗+低、辐射+大 
Total in the phrase rule base: 153 
(3)  Category three 

<6> Type six: Evaluation syntactical structure 

or distant collocation. 

Examples: 无法和……相比；引发……问题 
Total in the phrase rule base: 52 

2.1 The Storage and Formal Description of 
Different Types of Exps 

(1) Words and phrases of type one are stored in 

the sentiment lexicon SentiDic.txt in the form of 

entries. The lexicon format and entry samples are 

as follows: 

150



[Word or phrase Part of speech Positive 

sentiment intensity value Negative senti-

ment intensity value] 

漂亮  a 0.5 0 

鄙视  v 0 0.5 

败类  n 0 0.5 
(2) Words and phrases of type two, three and 

four are stored in the semantic dictionary Usr-
Di1.dic first. Then, corresponding sentiment val-

ue assignment rules for them are formulated in 

the phrase rule base PhraseRule.txt. 
The lexicon format and entry samples:  

[Word or phrase Semantic marker] 

规范  pxn 

封建  nxn 

诚信  ypn 
The sentiment value assignment rule samples: 

○1   */mopo + */pxn = #2:0.75 
The left part of = is the matching condition, 

the right part of = is the operation result. The 

symbol */mopo represents a degree modifier (e.g. 

很、非常、十分 ). The function of this rule: 
When there is a */mopo in front of */pxn, a 0.75 
sentiment value is assigned to */pxn. 

○2   */mone + */pxn = #2:-0.5 
The symbol */mone represents a negative 

modifier (e.g. 没有、毫无、缺乏). The function 
of this rule: When there is a */mone in front of 

*/pxn, a -0.5 sentiment value is assigned to 
*/pxn. 

(3) As to type five and six, corresponding senti-
ment value assignment rules are formulated in 

the phrase rule base PhraseRule.txt. The senti-

ment value assignment rule samples: 

○3   质量|性能|像素|分辨率|清晰度|安全系数

/% + #[*/!(w|mone)] + 高/a = #3:0.5 
The symbol #[*/!(w|mone)] means that the 

rule can cross arbitrary segmentations here ex-

cept the punctuation(w) or negative modifi-
er(mone) . 

Example (5) <weibo>:丰田车的安全系数的

确是低了点。</weibo> （It satisfies the match-

ing condition of rule ○3 , so a 0.5 sentiment value 

is assigned to the third item 低/a.） 

○4   无法|没法|不能|不可能/v + 和|跟|同|与/p 

+ #[*/!w] + 比|相比/% = #1:-0.5 

Example (6) <weibo>:三星 S6 的屏幕分辨率

根本无法和 iPhone6 相比。</weibo> （It satis-

fies the matching condition of rule ○4 , so a -0.5 

sentiment value is assigned to the first item 无法
/v. 

Based on the sentiment lexicon SentiDic and 
sentiment value assignment rules in PhraseRule, 

the system CUCsas realizes the automatic recog-

nition of whether there is an exp in the weibo 

discourse. Figure 2 shows the recognition proce-
dure: 

  
Figure 2. The Procedure of the Exp Recognition 

3 The Identification of Whether There 
Is a Semantic Orientation Relation-

ship between Exp-Topic 

The existence of an exp in the weibo message 

does not imply a semantic orientation relation-

ship between the exp and the topic. Because the 

evaluation object of the exp has two potential 
choices: topic or non-topic. The system CUCsas 

uses the method of combining syntactic structure 

and semantic features to build a topic extraction 
and polarity classification rule base. The essence 

of the rule base is using formal languages to de-

scribe the definite semantic direction relation-
ships between exp-topic, which are induced by 

analyzing the training corpus by us. The topic 

extraction and polarity classification rule base 

consists of 10 rule modules with a total of 36 
rules (see Table 1). 

Module 1 the exclusive method 

Explanation 
When the evaluation object of the exp is non-topic, the system will assign a 0 
sentiment value to the topic, so as to avoid the weibo message continuing to 

match the latter rule modules and cause errors. 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[*/!w|topic] + */(NP)&!(topic|vl) + #[*/!w|topic] + 是/% + #[*/!w] + 
*/topic + #[*/!w] + */vl&(n|in|ln) + #[*/!w] + */w|y|e|$ = N7:0 

Rule sample 

explanation 

(1) QSB: It is a macro definition symbol (including the punctuation, conjunction, 

evaluation-triggering word, time word or discourse maker) used as the initial 

151



item in this rule; (2) NP: It is a macro definition symbol (including the common 

noun or proper noun such as the name of a person, organization or product) 

representing a nominal element; (3) */topic: the given weibo topic; (4) */vl: an 

exp. 

Matching 

example 

Topic:雾霾  <weibo>:原来我一直以为汽车尾气排放是雾霾的罪魁祸首。

</weibo>  [output：雾霾 0] 
Rule number 1-7 

Module 2 the adversative compound sentence 

Explanation 

The content behind the adversative word is usually the semantic focus which the 

speaker wants to convey. Hence the rule only selects the exp appearing after the 
adversative word and semantically oriented to the topic as the output result, ig-

noring the other exps in the weibo message. 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[*/%] + */topic + #[!(；|;|。|.)/!NP] + ZZC/% + #[，|,/%] + #[!(,|，|；

|;|。|.|？|！|、)/!NP|xjc] + */vl&!hzv + #[!(?|？|吗|呢|么)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N8 

Rule sample 

explanation 

(1) ZZC: It is a macro definition symbol (including a total of  23 adversative 

words, such as 但、但是、可是、而是、然而、反而 、却); (2) =N3:N8: It 
means assigning the sentiment value of the eighth item */vl&!hzv to the third 

item */topic. 

Matching 

example 

Topic:三星 S6  <weibo>:本以为三星快不行的时候，S6 却震憾登场了。

</weibo>  [output：S6 1] 
Rule number 8-10 

Module 3 topic-exp co-occurrence in the same clause 

Explanation 

When the topic and the exp appear in the same clause, the rule will select the exp 

nearest to the topic as the one semantically oriented it.(The exception is that the 
topic is the subject of a sentence expressing a causing or obtaining meaning or 

with a “preposition + object” adverbial.) In addition, according to the Chinese 

pragmatic habit that the semantic focus is usually located at the end of the dis-
course, when exps appear both before and after the topic, i.e. exp1-topic-exp2, 

the rule will select exp2 only as the output result. 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[!(比|把)/!xjc] + */topic + #[*/!w|xjc|vl|nq] + */vl&(!hzv) + #[!(?|？|吗|

呢|么)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N5 

Rule sample 
explanation 

*/vl&(!hzv): The exp is arbitrary except for the backward-orientated sentiment 

verb(hzv) such as 喜爱、佩服 or 鄙视, because the evaluation object of the hzv 
is usually the component after it, not the topic before it. 

Matching 
example 

Topic:雾霾  <weibo>:我赞成中国雾霾问题非常严重。</weibo>  [output：雾

霾 -1] 
Rule number 11-17 

Module 4 the sentence expressing a causing or obtaining meaning 

Explanation 
When the topic is the subject of a sentence expressing a causing or obtaining 

meaning, the rule will select the last exp in the clause introduced by a word ex-

pressing a causing or obtaining meaning as the output result. 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!。/!NP|xjc] + TSC/% + #[*/!w|topic|xjc] + */vl 

+ #[!(?|？|吗|呢|么)/!xjc] + JSB = N3:N7 

Rule sample 

explanation 

TSC: It is a macro definition symbol (including a total of 31 words expressing a 

causing or obtaining meaning, such as 让、使得、引起、导致、成为 or 得到). 

Matching 
example 

Topic:中国人疯抢日本马桶  <weibo>:其中最为热销的产品竟然是智能马桶

盖，卖到几近断货，真是让人大跌眼镜。</weibo>  [output：马桶盖 -1] 
Rule number 18 
Module 5 the sentence with a “preposition + object” adverbial 

Explanation 
When the topic is the subject of a sentence with a “preposition + object” adver-

bial, the rule will select the exp in the central components modified by the ad-

verbial as the output result.

|.|？ |！ |：)/!topic|xjc] + */vl&!(hzv|xlv) + #[!(?|？ |吗 |呢 |么)/!xjc] + JSB = 
N3:N7 

Rule sample 

explanation 

*/vl&!(hzv|xlv): The exp is arbitrary except for the backward-orientated senti-

ment verb(hzv) or psychological sentiment verb(xlv), because the evaluation 

object of the hzv or xlv is usually the object of the preposition, not the topic as 
the subject of the sentence. 

Matching 

example 

Topic:央行降息  <weibo>:羊年第一个周末央行再度出手降息，对券商、保

险、地产等绝大多数品种构成较大利好。</weibo>   [output：降息 1] 
Rule number 19 
Module 6 the comparative sentence 

Explanation 

When the topic serves as the comparative subject in the comparative sentence, its 
sentiment vale = the sentiment value of the exp serving as the comparative re-

sult; when the topic serves as the comparative datum in the comparative sen-

tence, its sentiment vale = the sentiment value of the exp serving as the compara-
tive result× (-1) (Zhou Hongzhao et al., 2014). 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!(。|：|?|？)/!vl|xjc] + 比|相比|比起|对比/p + 

#[!(。|！|?|？|；)/!topic|xjc] + */vl + #[!(?|？|吗|呢|么)/!xjc|vl] + JSB = N3:N7 

Rule sample 

explanation 

The */topic (N3) is located before the comparative-marker word比|相比|比起|对

比/p(N5) .So it serves as the comparative subject and its sentiment vale = the 
sentiment value of the exp */vl(N7) serving as the comparative result. 

Matching 
example 

Topic:三星 S6  <weibo>:个人感觉 S6 前面板一如既往三星风格，背面更是

比 iPhone6 还难看。</weibo>   [output：S6 -1] 

Rule number 20-24 
Module 7 the causation compound sentence 

Explanation 
In the causation compound sentence, the exp may appear in the reason clause, 

while its evaluation object appears in the result clause.  

Rule sample */topic + #[!(。|？|！|；|;|：)/!xjc] + 因为/% + #[*/!w] + */vl = N1:N5 

Rule sample 

explanation 

In module 4, the topic is the reason, while the exp is the result. Here, the topic is 

the result, while the exp is the reason. The two rule modules complement each 

other. 

Matching 

example 

Topic:中国人疯抢日本马桶  <weibo>:终于明白为什么中国人都要去日本买

马桶盖了，因为好用到飙泪！</weibo>   [output：马桶盖 1] 
Rule number 25 

Module 8 
The topic and the exp are distributed in different clauses or sentences. Type 

one: topic + exp 

Explanation 

The topic appears first, and then the exp appears in the clause or sentence adja-
cent or nonadjacent to the clause or sentence the topic in. In this case, only the 

weibo message satisfies certain syntactic and semantic constraints, will the rule 

judge that the evaluation object of the exp is the topic. 

Rule sample 
QSB + #[*/!vl|xjc] + */topic + #[!。/!vl|xjc] + */w + #[!。/!xjc|NP] + */vl + 

#1:3[!(吗|呢|么)/u|y|e] + JSB = N3:N7 

Rule sample 
explanation 

Constraints of the rule sample: (1) There is no exp appearing together with the 
topic in the clause; (2) There is no NP appearing before the exp in the clause; (3) 

The word class after the exp is only auxiliary, modal or interjection, and three 

interrogative words 吗、呢 and 么 are forbidden.

example 

Topic:油价   <weibo>:涨油价的时候也不提消费税了，流氓啊</weibo>   

[output：油价 -1] 
Rule number 26-32 

Module 9 
The topic and the exp are distributed in different clauses or sentences. Type 

two: exp + topic 

153



Explanation 

The exp appears first, and then the topic appears in the clause or sentence adja-

cent or nonadjacent to the clause or sentence the exp in. In this situation, only the 

weibo message satisfies certain syntactic and semantic constraints, will the rule 

judge that the evaluation object of the exp is the topic. 

Rule sample */^ + #[*/!nq] + */na + #[*/!w] + */vl + #[*/!nq] + */topic&nq = N7:N5 

Rule sample 

explanation 

Constraints of the rule sample: (1) */^: The initial item of the rule is the weibo 

start marker; (2) #[*/!nq]: The word with a semantic marker of product name is 

forbidden; (3) */na: A word with the semantic marker of product attribute must 
appear; (4) */topic&nq: The topic word must is also a product name.

Rule number 33-35 

Module 10 anaphora resolution 

Explanation 
When the referent of a pronoun is the topic, the rule will assign the sentiment 

value of the exp semantically orientated to the pronoun to the topic.

Rule number 36 
Note:  

(1) The 36 rules of the 10 rule modules are sequentially arranged, forming the topic extraction 

and sentiment polarity classification rule base. 

(2) Matching procedure: The weibo message matches the rule base starting from the first rule. 

If the matching succeeds, the system will output a corresponding matching result; if fails, the 
weibo message will skip to the second rule to continue matching. If this matching succeeds, the 

system will output a corresponding matching result; or else the weibo message will skip to the 

next rule to continue matching……If the matching still fails at the end of the rule base (i.e. rule 
36), then the system will make a judgment that there is no semantic orientation relationship be-

tween the exp and the topic in this weibo message and output a corresponding result: topic 0. 

The next weibo message matches the rule base in the same way……until the last weibo message 

in the experimental data. 
Table 1. Topic Extraction and Sentiment Polarity Classification Rule Base

Based on the topic extraction and polarity 

classification rule base, the system CUCsas rea-
lizes the automatic identification of whether 

there is a semantic orientation relationship be-

tween the exp and the topic in the weibo message. 

If the weibo message matches the rule base un-
successfully, the system will output topic 0; if 

successfully, the system will assign the value of 

the corresponding exp to the topic. If the value > 
0, the system will output: topic 1; if the value < 0, 

the system will output: topic -1; if the value = 0, 

the system will output: topic 0. Figure 3 shows 
the general procedure:

and Sentiment Polarity Classification 

4 The Sentiment Polarity Classification 
of the Exp 

The term “corresponding result” in Figure 3 con-

tains double meanings: ⅰ The “corresponding” 

154



means that there is a semantic orientation rela-

tionship between the exp and the topic. ⅱ The 
“result” refers to the sentiment value and polarity 
of the exp in the weibo message context, not 

necessarily equals the value and polarity in the 

sentiment lexicon. ⅰ is guaranteed by 36 rules 

of 10 modules. ⅱ is obtained by sentiment com-
puting rules (see Table 2) in the PhraseRule.txt. 

Type 1 Contrary 

Description 

The sentiment polarity of the 

exp in the weibo message 

context is contrary to its sen-
timent polarity in the senti-

ment lexicon. 

Features 

(1) The exp is modified by 
the word with a negative se-

mantic marker “mone”; (2) 

The exp appears in a negative 

sentence pattern characte-

rized by words such as 难道 

or 怎么可能 ; (3) The exp 
appears in the special collo-

cation characterized by spe-

cific words. For instance, the 

sentiment polarity of 美化 is 
positive in the sentiment lex-
icon, but when it collocates 

with战争、侵略 or 历史, its 
sentiment polarity will turn 
negative.

Type 2 Dissolution 

Description 

The evaluation meaning of 

the exp is dissolved in the 
weibo message context. 

Features 

(1) The exp appears in the 

sentence introduced by the 

word with an evaluation dis-
solving marker “xjc” such as

如果、假如、祝愿、但

愿、能否、是否—30 in all;

Type 3 Consistency 

Description 

The polarity of the exp in the 

weibo message context is 
consistent with the sentiment 

lexicon. But the sentiment 

intensity can be unchanged, 

enhanced or weakened. 

Features 

(1) Features mentioned in 

type 1 and type 2 must not

Table 5. Using the Sentiment Lexicon  
Together with the Phrase Rule Base 

    Comparing Table 4 with Table 5, we can see 

the introduction of the phrase rule base improved 
the system overall performance, but only to a 

small extent. Comparing Table 5 with Table 3, 

we can see the introduction of the topic extrac-
tion and polarity classification rule base further 

improved the system overall performance to a 

large extent. 

At present, the overall F value of the system is 
about 0.69. Evaluation results in Table 3 suggest 

that the performance of the system is good in 

dealing with neutral sentiment weibo messages, 
but poor in dealing with positive sentiment wei-

bo messages (F+≈0.24) and negative sentiment 

weibo messages (F-≈0.44). 
Reasons and solving methods for poor Recall+ 

and Recall- : (1) The scale of the topic extraction 
and polarity classification rule base built accord-

ing to the training data is small (only 36 rules). 

Thus, the language phenomena having not ap-

peared in the training data can’t be covered. For 

instance, the module 10 —anaphora resolution 
neglects the case that the pronoun appears ahead 
of the topic. In the next stage, new rules will be 

added to the rule base to expand its coverage. (2) 

The sentiment lexicon and the sentiment phrase 

rule base are not incomplete so that many exps in 

the test data can’t be recognized. In the next 

stage, the system will improve the automatic rec-

ognition of unlisted exps. 
Reasons and solving methods for poor Preci-

sion+ and Precision-: (1) Some rules in the topic 

extraction and polarity classification rule base do 
not appropriately describe the semantically 

orientated relationship between topic-exp, which 

leads to the wrong extraction of exps. In the next 
stage, some rules will be revised based on the 

errors analysis. (2) Some “exps” in the sentiment 

lexicon actually do not have evaluation meaning. 

For example, the word 激烈 is not a sentiment 
word. However, it is listed in the sentiment lex-

icon as a negative word. Therefore, the sentiment 

polarity output result of Topic :水货客 in  <wei-

bo>:反水货客行动越趋激烈。</weibo> is 
wrong -1. In the next stage, the sentiment lexicon 

will be checked and non-sentiment words will be 

removed. 

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, firstly, we proposed the algorithm 

of rule-based weibo messages sentiment polarity 
classification towards given topics. Then, we 

adopted the rule methods to implement the re-

quirements of the algorithm procedures. Based 
on the sentiment lexicon SentiDic and sentiment 

value assignment rules in PhraseRule, the senti-

ment analysis system CUCsas realized the auto-

matic recognition of the exp in weibo messages. 
Based on the topic extraction and polarity classi-

fication rule base, the system realized the auto-

matic identification of whether there is a seman-
tic orientation relationship between the exp and 

the topic. And based on the sentiment computing 

rules in PhraseRule, the system realized the sen-
timent value calculation and polarity classifica-

tion of the exp in specific weibo message context. 

At present, the overall F value of the ruled-based 

sentiment analysis system CUCsas is about 0.69. 
In the future, the lexicon and rule base will be 

revised based on the errors analysis to improve 

the performance of the system.
