Poetic Organization within Oral Tradition

Abstract 

A procedure is described which is capable of 

detecting poetic organization within tran-

scribed oral tradition text. It consists of two 

components: An automated process which 

generates recurring n-gram patterns, and a 

verification process of manual review. Ap-

plied to a corpus of Tahitian and Mangarevan 

oral tradition, it has led to discovery of a va-

riety of uses of meter and parallelism; rang-

ing from the universally common to the unan-

ticipated. The procedure should be general-

izable to the study of other of the world’s oral 

poetries, having been designed to identify a 

wide range of organizational possibilities.  

1 Introduction 

Our knowledge of the many ways by which oral 

tradition may be organized poetically derives 

from an uneven study of mostly European, Mid-

dle-Eastern, and Asian traditions.  On a positive 

note, descriptions of the oral poetry of Indo-

European languages have been sufficient to 

spawn the field of comparative-historical poetics 

(see Watkins 1995).  Unfortunately, much less 

effort has been applied to the remainder of the 

world’s oral traditions, which tend to fade away 

well before their languages die off.  In a homog-

enizing era, unless these vulnerable data are col-

lected and their varied means of poetic organiza-

tion discovered, much of what could have been 

learned with regard to oral poetics universally 

might be forsaken. 

When venturing into the study of an un-

described poetic tradition, a purely manual ap-

proach is generally insufficient. The investigative 

path is likely to be lined with wide cognitive 

gaps from researcher prejudice as to what might 

be recognized as poetic.   

The procedure described here attempts to 

remedy potential bias by informing the research-

er of instances of parallelism which may not 

have been otherwise detected.  The procedure 

consists of two components: An automated pro-

cess which generates recurring n-gram patterns, 

and a verification process of manual review.  

Manual verification is recommended given that a 

tradition may employ many different organiza-

tional methods, but the corpora which contain 

them are often small. 

Some of the examples used below are drawn 

from application of the procedure to two sources 

of Polynesian oral tradition: A 50,000 word cor-

pus of early 19
th
 century Tahitian material repre-

senting multiple genres, and a 10,000 word cor-

pus of early 20
th
 century Mangarevan songs and 

chants.  Treatment of the complete Tahitian cor-

pus was successful at the discovery of two varie-

ties of counting meter (one of which may be 

unique to Tahiti), complex patterns of meter and 

sound parallelism, and many uses of syntactic 

and semantic parallelism (see Meyer 2011 and 

2013).  Analysis of the Mangarevan data is still 

underway. 

Due to space constraints, the automated pro-

cedure’s functionality has only been summarized 

here.  It is hoped that enough information will 

have been provided for the computational lin-

guist reader to be successful at his or her own 

implementation. 

2 Description of the Procedure 

As mentioned, the procedure consists of an au-

tomated process which generates recurring n-

gram patterns, followed by a verification process 

of manual review. 

With regard to former, computationally-

generated candidates consist of recurring n-

grams of linguistic features,
1
 any of which could 

potentially have application to poetic composi-

                                                 
1 Among the oral poetries of the world, a wide range of 

linguistic features have been found organized in un-

countable creative ways. With respect to the phoneme, 

for instance, poetic organization may be of the phoneme 

itself, of a class of phonemes (e.g. as in an assonant pat-

tern where only the vowels are significant), of a phone-

mic feature (e.g. a pattern of contrasting +acute and  

-acute), etc. The term linguistic feature here refers to 

any linguistic information detectable at the level of pho-

neme, syllable, word, or line that could serve to form a 

pattern of poetic meter or parallelism.

tion. The n-grams are sorted and counted, and 

then presented – in their original context – in 

multiple interactive reports as preparation for 

manual review.   

The automated component initially attempts 

to accommodate any linguistic feature a poet 

may wish to employ. After an initial round of 

manual analysis, however, it is desirable to pare 

the feature set down to just those which demon-

strate some degree of promise; in order to lighten 

the load of the overall endeavor.

  The list in ta-

ble 1, for example, contains the reduced linguis-

tic feature set which was ultimately selected for 

treatment of the Polynesian data.

It may also be necessary to re-apply the pro-

cedure were it discovered during manual review

2.4 below. 

that the oral tradition specialist’s poetic use of 

linguistic features differs from that of general 

language.
3
 

In its implementation, the automated process 

need not be restricted to observation of a single 

feature in isolation (single-feature pattern detec-

tion), but should attempt to be sufficiently ex-

pansive so as to detect an oral poet’s efforts to 

coordinate more than one feature (multi-feature 

pattern detection).  It should also be capable of 

detecting patterns of inverted parallelism.  Line,
4
 

word, and syllable boundaries may or may not be 

significant, and therefore all possibilities for 

boundary inclusion into a pattern should be per-

mitted. 

Concerning the raw output of candidate pat-

tern generation, it was found during manual re-

view of the Polynesian data that: 
 

1. Some patterns suggested poetic organization, how-

ever the majority – around 90% – held little or no 

interest. 

 

2. Some patterns pointed to a larger, more compre-

hensive pattern. 

 

3. Some patterns pointed to a pattern that might be 

detected better at a different level of analysis. 

 

Patterns demonstrating some degree of prom-

ise were filtered through the following criteria:
5
 

 

1. Similar types of pattern should be either non-

existent or significantly less frequent in prose. 

                                                 
3  For example, in the treatment of the Tahitian and 

Mangarevan passages which will be presented below, 

long and short vowels have been conflated, as it was 

discovered early on in manual analysis that patterns 

could be extended, or those near to each other joined, by 

permitting such an abstraction.  It was also discovered 

that the Tahitian and Mangarevan diphthong /ae/ is poet-

ically equivalent to /ai/, and the Tahitian /ao/ to /au/.  

Poetic equivalence of /ae/ to /ai/ has been similarly ob-

served by Jacob Love to apply to Samoan rhyme (Love 

1991:88).  Finally, the glottal stop phoneme /ʔ/ was de-

termined to serve no role in Tahitian poetic function. 
4 A tradition’s poetic line must be established before line 

boundary may be included as a pattern element.  Nigel 

Fabb suggests that the concept of line is a poetic univer-

sal (Fabb 2009:54-55).  It generally represents a syntac-

tic structure with a specific metrical count, although for 

some traditions it may be non-metrical, bounded by 

some indicator such as a pause or lengthened vowel.  Its 

identification, perhaps through trial and error, should be 

accomplished early on in the analysis.   
5 These criteria were empirically motivated mostly from 

analysis of the Polynesian data, and so may evolve after 

the described process has found application to a wider 

variety of traditions. 

93



2. A pattern should occur multiple times in the same 

text.  A longer pattern need only occur twice in the 

same text. 

 

3. The placement of the majority of a pattern’s occur-

rences should appear intentional; for example, as 

when found principally in the same segment of a text, 

or when placement suggested some higher degree of 

coordination. 

 

4. Similar types of pattern should be found in at least 

two other texts of the same genre, in order to filter out 

patterns which might be unrepresentative of the poetic 

tradition, or which were perhaps merely the result of 

chance occurrence. 

 

Poetic intent might subsequently be asserted 

if either of the following were satisfied: 

 
1. The candidate pattern was found to match any 

method of poetic organization documented for other 

of the world’s poetic traditions. 

 

2. For promising pattern types unspecified in the liter-

ature, a pattern might be esteemed to self-justify as 

poetic were it found to be sufficiently complex or 

repetitive so as to eliminate the likelihood of chance. 

 

The following sections will discuss single-

feature pattern detection, multi-feature pattern 

detection, and detection of inverted parallelism.  

Examples will be provided of application of the 

procedure to a passage from a familiar English 

children’s poem, and to extracts from several of 

the transcribed Tahitian and Mangarevan oral 

texts. 

2.1 Single-Feature Pattern Detection 

In single-feature pattern detection, only one lin-

guistic feature is analyzed at a time.  As with the 

other detection methods, the possibility exists of 

poetic intent whenever an n-gram token recurs.   

The first four lines of the well-known chil-

dren’s poem Mary had a little lamb will serve to 

initially demonstrate this type of analysis. The 

passage in (1) has been tagged for three word-

level linguistic features: IPA word form, simple 

part-of-speech, and word syllable count. 
 

(1) Passage from Mary had a little lamb tagged for 

word form, simple part-of-speech, and word syllable 

count

2. whose  fleece  was  white  as   snow

  FUNC  NOUN VERB MODIF FUNC NOUN 

  1     1     1    1     1    1 

 

3. and   everywhere  that   Mary  went 

  ænd   ɛvɹiwɛɹ    ðæt   mɛɹɪ   wɛnt 

  FUNC  NOUN    FUNC  NOUN VERB

4. her   lamb   was   sure   to   go 

  hɚ   læm   wǝz   ʃɚ    tu   goʊ 

  FUNC NOUN VERB  MODIF FUNC VERB 

  1    1     1     1     1    1 

 

The list of bi-gram word form tokens from 

this passage would begin: 

 

mɛɹɪ-hæd 

hæd-ǝ 

etc. 

 

The list of 4-gram simple part-of-speech to-

kens would begin: 

 

NOUN-VERB-FUNC-MODIF 

VERB-FUNC-MODIF-NOUN 

etc. 

 

From a tally of matching simple part-of-

speech bigrams, we note in (2) below four occur-

rences of NOUN-VERB.

lamb passage

With prior knowledge that English is an SVO 

language, however, the NOUN-VERB pattern

candidate is dismissed during manual review as 

being common as well to English prose.

In (3) below, we find repetition of the word

corresponding to a little lamb | whose fleece was 

white as snow |, and that Mary went | her lamb 

was sure to go |.

passage

4. her  lamb  was sure to go 

  1   1    1   1   1  1 

 

It may be that parallelism of such a long pat-

tern is metrically significant, although this would 

be difficult to confirm given just one recurrence. 

It should be reiterated that while patterns which 

emerge out of a single text are not always con-

clusively poetic, when compared with similar 

pattern organization in other texts, poetic intent 

often becomes clear. 

In (4), we turn to analysis at the syllable level. 

Here, we discover the apparent end-rhyming bi-

gram /oʊ/-| of snow |, and go |.  
 

(4) Some bigram repetition in the Mary had a little 

lamb passage 

Level of analysis: Syllable 

Linguistic feature: Syllable rhyme 

Boundary relevance: Line boundary is significant.  

Minimum pattern occurrences = 2 

   

1. Mary had a  little  lamb 

   ɛ  ɪ   æd  ǝ   ɪ  əl   æm 

 

2. whose fleece was white as snow 

    uːz  iːs    ǝz    aɪt  æz   oʊ 

                                                 
6 With regard to languages for which common patterns 

of prose – part-of-speech or otherwise – are unknown, 

the analysis process should be applied as well to a prose 

corpus, and its findings subtracted, either by automated 

or manual means, from poetry analysis results. 
7 To ease readability, line-boundary is indicated in some 

pattern descriptions as a vertical bar |. 

3. and  everywhere that Mary went 

  ænd  ɛv   i   ɛɹ    æt    ɛ  ɪ     ɛnt 

 

4. her  lamb  was sure to go 

    ɚ   æm      ǝz    ɚ    u  oʊ 

 
With prior knowledge that end-rhyme on al-

ternating lines is common to English, French, 

and several other poetic traditions, we conclude 

that the intent here is poetic. 

In (5), we encounter a passage of a Mangare-

van song
8
 which consists of a repeated syntactic 

frame, with the four nouns vai, kukau, aʔi, and 

inaina and the two adjectives rito and ka serving 

as its variable elements.  We observe end-rhyme 

in lines 1 and 5 with the syllable rhyme pattern 

a-i| (in bold) corresponding to the nouns vai and 

aʔi, and note that a-i as a bigram is also con-

tained within the name of the song’s subject, the 

young woman Tai-tinaku-toro.  We additionally 

observe assonant matching between the syllable 

rhyme bigram a-u (in bold underlined) of the 

noun ku.ka.u and the syllables na.ku of the wom-

an’s name.  Finally, we note a match between the 

syllable rhyme bigram I-A (in bold small caps) of 

the noun i.na~i.na and the syllables ti.na of the 

woman’s name.

8 In Tahitian and Mangarevan song, adjacent vowels are 

not heard to form diphthongs, and so the second vowel 

of each diphthong in this passage is treated as its own 

syllable.

If similar use of assonance were discovered in 

several other texts of the same genre, such 

should warrant a claim that assonant matching 

between a syntactic frame’s variable elements 

and the poem’s theme is a method of Mangare-

van poetic organization. 

2.2 Multi-Feature Pattern Detection 

In multi-feature analysis, n-gram patterns are 

comprised of cross-level linguistic feature infor-

mation. This is motivated by a desire to be suffi-

ciently expansive so as to detect a poet’s efforts 

to coordinate more than one feature.

In the Mary had a little lamb passage, the ad-

dition of a bit of manual semantic tagging reveals 

the following multi-feature tri-gram: 

 
Semantics: lamb-part - 

Word form: wǝz - 

Part-of-speech: MODIF 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
9 Multi-feature detection was originally inspired by the 

bag of trees approach used by Data-Oriented Parsing, 

which permits assembling syntactic patterns from dif-

ferent levels of tree structure (see Bod 1998). 

The tri-gram token is provided in context in 

(6):

had a little lamb passage 

Level of analysis: Word 

Linguistic features: Word form, simple part-of-

speech, and “Mary-part” and “lamb-part” semantic 

tagging  

Boundary relevance: All boundaries are ignored. 

Minimum pattern occurrences = 2

  hɚ   læm   wǝz   ʃɚ     tu   goʊ 

  FUNC NOUN VERB  MODIF  FUNC VERB 

      lamb-part  

 

Whether or not the recurrence of this tri-gram 

might be interpreted as poetic, it should be rec-

ognized that it would not have been detected by 

single-feature analysis. 

From the Tahitian corpus, we find an 11-gram 

multi-feature token which combines information 

relevant to word form, syllable count, and word 

vowel: 
 

Line boundary - 

Word form: e - 

Word form: noho - 

Line boundary - 

Syllable count: 1 - 

Syllable count: 2 -

This token appears initially in lines 1 through 

3 and then repeats in lines 4 through 6 of (7) be-

low:

It might be best to re-interpret this complex n-

gram as simply providing evidence of two over-

lapping methods of organization: A 3-3-5 pattern 

of syllabic counting meter alongside an a-o-a 

pattern of end-rhyme.  During manual review, an 

attempt should always be made to re-analyse 

candidates into more generalizable patterns. 

From the Mangarevan material, we find a 15-

gram multi-feature token which combines infor-

mation relevant to word form, syllable form, syl-

lable onset, and syllable rhyme: 
 

Line boundary - 

Word_form: ena - 

Word_form: ʔana -

The repeated word forms within this 15-gram 

perhaps serve to bracket the sound parallelism 

which occurs between its variable elements.   

It should be noted that, with regard to the 

Polynesian data, the discovery of poetic organi-

zation was generally achievable through single-

feature analysis. Patterns only detectable through 

multi-feature analysis were uncommon. 

2.3 Inverted Parallelism 

In some poetic traditions, patterns of linguistic 

features are not always repeated as is, but rather 

by means of an inverted ordering.  An example is 

chiasmus, which is an inversion of repeated se-

mantic elements; very common to the Ancient 

Hebrew of the Old Testament.   

Automated detection of inverted parallelism 

is accomplished by a simply comparing the lin-

guistic feature n-grams of a given document with 

the n-grams generated from a reverse ordering of 

those features.  As before, matching n-grams are 

sorted and counted, and then presented within the 

context of the non-reversed material.  

In the Tahitian example given in (9) below, 

we find the 7-gram pattern of syllabic counting 

meter 6-4-5-3-3-3-4 which is followed, after a 5 

count, by its inverted match 4-3-3-3-5-4-6.

Due to the detection as well of many other 

patterns of inverted meter in the corpus, inver-

sion of the patterns which govern syllabic count-

ing meter was deemed to self-justify, under crite-

ria mentioned above, as a method of Tahitian 

poetic organization. 

2.4 Concerning Combinatorial Explosion 

Inherent to the automated process is a combina-

torial explosion of n-grams – particularly true 

with regard to multi-feature analysis. The total 

number of single- and multi-feature n-gram to-

kens generated for a given text may be deter-

mined as described in figure 1. 

The number of word-level n-grams generated 

from a typical 1,000 word text, after restricting 

analysis to 10 layers of linguistic feature tagging, 

is the quite large 6.82 x 10
501.  By reducing the 

number of tagged layers to four and maximum n 

to 10, however, the final count diminishes to a 

much more tractable 1.39 billion. It should be 

mentioned that foregoing multi-level analysis 

would permit maximum n to be set much higher. 

It follows that a reduction in the interaction of 

linguistic features for a given pass would result 

in some patterns being missed by the automated  

Figure 1. Calculation for all single- and multi-feature 

n-gram tokens of a text.

Given: 

 

C = The count of all single- and multi-feature n-gram 

tokens which might be generated from a text at a giv-

en level of analysis (e.g. word level, syllable level). 

  

E = The number of linguistic elements in the text (e.g. 

in the passage from Mary had a little lamb, we ana-

lysed at the word level where there are 22 words and 

5 instances of line boundary, for a total of 27 word-

level elements). 

 

N = The current n-gram n number. 

  

Max N = The n number of the largest desired n-gram. 

For an n-gram token to be able to occur at least twice, 

and thereby potentially demonstrate a pattern, max n 

should not exceed half the total number of linguistic 

elements (e.g. for word-level analysis of the passage 

from Mary had a little lamb, it would not be useful 

for n to be larger than 13). 

  

F = The number of tagged linguistic features (e.g. the 

passage from Mary had a little lamb in (1) is tagged 

for three features). 

  

            Max  N  

C =  ∑ ( E – ( N – 1 )) · F N 
       N=1 

 

 

process. Therefore, a certain degree of trial and 

error must be pursued in order to determine 

which combinations of four features at a time 

yield the best candidates. Furthermore, with a 

maximum n of just 10, it may become necessary 

to stitch together – either manually or through an 

automated process – adjacent and overlapping 

patterns. 

3 Conclusion 

Alongside grammatical description, dictionary 

compilation, language pedagogy, and the other 

efforts typically undertaken to assist in the 

preservation of an endangered language, it is im-

portant that documentation of a language com-

munity’s oral tradition, and the poetics common-

ly embedded therein, be awarded full considera-

tion as well.  Both of these serve a significant 

role in language identity, and the realm of verbal 

                                                 
12 To arrive at the count needed to include analysis of 

inverted parallelism as well, simply double the C result.

art is enriched through their study.  Relevant to 

the level of detail required for such research, 

John Miles Foley asserts that “We must give the 

idiosyncratic aspects of each tradition their due, 

for only when we perceive sameness against the 

background of rigorously examined individual-

ized traits can we claim a true comparison of oral 

traditions” (Foley 1981:275). 

The procedure which has been described here 

is admittedly labor-intensive; especially with 

regard to its manual component.  However, it is 

probably necessary that it be so in order to suc-

ceed at documenting the majority of a poetic tra-

dition’s individualized traits.  Relevant to the 

Tahitian material, the procedure was successful 

at the detection of a syllabic counting meter 

based upon word stress (see Meyer 2013:88-

105).  Such was previously unattested among 

world poetries, and with its discovery our under-

standing of what is universally possible for meter 

became expanded.
