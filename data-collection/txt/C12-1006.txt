ABSTRACT 

Unknown words, or out of vocabulary words (OOV), cause a significant problem to 

morphological analysers, syntactic parses, MT systems and other NLP applications. Unknown 

words make up 29 % of the word types in in a large Arabic corpus used in this study. With 

today's corpus sizes exceeding 10
9
 words, it becomes impossible to manually check corpora for 

new words to be included in a lexicon. We develop a finite-state morphological guesser and 

integrate it with a machine-learning-based pre-annotation tool in a pipeline architecture for 

extracting unknown words, lemmatizing them, and giving them a priority weight for inclusion in 

a lexical database. The processing is performed on a corpus of contemporary Arabic of 

1,089,111,204 words. Our method is tested on a manually-annotated gold standard and yields 

encouraging results despite the complexity of the task. Our work shows the usability of a highly 

non-deterministic morphological guesser in a practical and complex application.

1 Introduction 

Due to the complexity and semi-algorithmic nature of Arabic morphology (that employs 

numerous rules and constraints on inflection, derivation and cliticization), it has been a challenge 

for computational processing and analysis (Kiraz, 2001; Beesley 2003). A lexicon is an 

indispensable part of a morphological analyser (Dichy and Farghaly, 2003; Attia, 2006; 

Buckwalter, 2004; Beesley, 2001), and the coverage of the lexical database is a key factor in the 

coverage of the morphological analyser, and limitations in the lexicon will cascade through to 

higher levels of processing. Moreover, out of vocabulary words (or OOVs) have impact 

negatively on the performance of parsers (Attia et al., 2010) and MT applications (Huang et al. 

2010). This is why an automatic method for updating a lexical database and dealing with 

unknown words is crucially important. 

We present the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to address the lemmatization (rather 

than stemming) of Arabic unknown words. The problem with lemmatizing unknown words is 

that they cannot be matched against a morphological lexicon. Furthermore, the specific problem 

with lemmatizing Arabic words is the richness and complexity of Arabic morphological 

derivational and inflectional processes. For the purposes of this paper, unknown words are words 

not found by the SAMA morphological analyser (Maamouri et al., 2010) but accepted by the 

Microsoft Spell Checker. We develop a rule-based finite-state morphological guesser and use a 

machine learning based disambiguator, MADA (Roth et al., 2008), in a pipeline-based approach 

to lemmatization.  

We test our method against a manually created gold standard of 1,310 types (unique words) and 

show a significant improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, we devise a novel algorithm for 

weighting and prioritizing new words for inclusion in a lexicon depending on three factors: 

number of form variations of the lemmas, cumulative frequency of the forms, and the type of 

POS (part of speech) tag. 

This paper is structured as follows. The remainder of the introduction provides more details on 

the complexity of the lemmatization process in Arabic, why dealing with unknown words is 

important, previous work on the topic, and the data used in our experiments. Section 2 presents 

the methodology we follow in extracting and analysing unknown words. Section 3 provides 

details on the morphological guesser we develop to help deal with the problem. Section 4 

presents and discusses the evaluation results,  and Section 5 concludes. 

1.1 Complexity of Lemmatization in Arabic 

Arabic is an inflectionally rich language with nouns specified for number, gender and case; and 

verbs specified for tense, number, gender, person, voice and mood. These inflectional processes 

entail complex alterations on base forms. Arabic is also a clitic language. Clitics are morphemes 

that have the syntactic characteristics of a word but are morphologically bound to other words 

(Crystal, 1980). In Arabic, many coordinating conjunctions, the definite article, many 

prepositions and particles, and a class of pronouns are all clitics that attach themselves either to 

the start or end of words, and subsequently change the base form according to alteration rules 

which include assimilation and deletion. These facts complicate the process of lemmatization, or 

returning the base form given the inflected form. 

84



For English, one can reasonably assume that new words appear very often in their base forms, or 

the lexical look-up forms. Lindén (2008) indicates that about 86 % of the new words in English 

appear in their base form. However, in Arabic, which is highly inflectional in nature, only 45 % 

of new token types in our test set appear in their base form. Moreover, 36 % of the unknown 

types do not appear in their base form at all in the entire corpus. 

1.2 Why Deal with Unknown Words? 

Sinclair (1987) introduced the term “Floating Dictionary”, a self-updating dictionary that is able 

to automatically monitor language change. “It would, so to speak, float on top of a corpus, rather 

like a jelly-fish, its tendrils constantly sensing the state of the language.” We think that an 

electronic ‘floating dictionary’ should be able to perform at least three major tasks. It should be 

able to tell which words are not is use anymore, which words have newly appeared in a language,  

and which word usages or senses have changed based on contemporary data. In this paper we 

explain our methodology for automatically detecting new words in Arabic, lemmatizing such 

new words in order to relate multiple surface forms to their base underlying representations, 

deciding on the word POS tag, collecting statistics on the frequency of use, and modelling human 

decisions on whether to include the new words in a lexicon or not. 

New words are constantly finding their way into any living human language. These new words 

are either coined or borrowed, or they can be transliterations of proper nouns from other 

languages. The inclusion of new words in a lexicon is a non-trivial task as it needs to address two 

important problems. First, there is the problem of detection, or how do we know that a new word 

has appeared? Second, there is the problem of reaching a decision on the new word, or how do 

we judge whether the new word is worth adding to the lexicon or not? This is usually done by 

looking at whether the word is frequent enough, whether it appears in various forms and 

inflections, and whether it is well-distributed in a corpus. This enables us to determine whether 

the word constitutes a core lexical item or the usage of the word is just accidental or 

idiosyncratic. 

We address this issue by developing an automatic technique to recognize unknown words and 

reduce them to their lemmas, predict their POS, and rank them in their order of importance. 

1.3 Previous Work 

Lemmatization of unknown words has been addressed for Slovene in (Erjavec and Džerosk, 

2004), for Hebrew in (Adler at al., 2008) and for English, Finnish, Swedish and Swahili in 

(Lindén, 2008). Apart from the language involved, our work is different in that we incorporate a 

finite state guesser in the process. Lemmatization of Arabic words has been addressed in (Roth et 

al., 2008; Dichy, 2001). The idea of finding and stemming unknown Arabic words has been 

utilized by Diab et al, (2004). While Diab et al. do not mention unknown words specifically, the 

fact that they use a character-based classification model and tokenization indicates that they can 

handle unknown words and perform stemming on them. However, they do not present any 

evaluation on unknown words specifically. Mohamed and Kübler (2010) handle unknown words 

explicitly and provide results for known and unknown words in both word segmentation 

(stemming) and part of speech tagging. They reach a stemming accuracy of 81.39 % on unknown 

words and over 99 % on known words. 

85



Diab et al.’s and Mohammed and Kübler’s work focuses on stemming rather than lemmatization, 

which are quite distinct albeit frequently confused. The difference between stemming and 

lemmatization is that stemming strips off prefixes and suffixes and leaves the bare stem, while 

lemmatization returns the canonical base form. To illustrate this with an example, take the Arabic 

verb form يقولون ‘yqwlwn’ “they say”. Stemming will remove the present prefix ‘y’ and the plural 

suffix ‘wn’ and leave قول ‘qwl’ which is a non-word in Arabic. By contrast, full lemmatization 

will reveal that the word has gone through an alteration process and return the canonical قال ‘qAl’ 

“to say” as the base form. 

Lemmatization reduces surface forms to their canonical base representations (or dictionary look-

up form), i.e, words before undergoing any inflection, which, in Arabic, means verbs in their 

perfective, indicative, 3rd person, masculine, singular forms, such as  ََشَكر $akara “to thank”; and 

nominals (the term used for both nouns and adjectives) in their nominative, singular, masculine 

forms, such as طالِب TAlib “student”; and nominative plural for pluralia tantum nouns (or nouns 

that appear only in the plural form and are not derived from a singular form) , such as ناس nAs 

“people”. 

1.4 Data Used 

In our work we use a large-scale corpus of 1,089,111,204 words, consisting of the Arabic 

Gigaword Fourth Edition (Parker et al., 2009) with 925,461,707 words, in addition to 

163,649,497 words from news articles crawled from the Al-Jazeera web site.  In this corpus, 

unknown words appear at a rate between 2 % of word tokens (when we ignore possible spelling 

variants) and 9 % of word tokens (when possible spelling variants are included). In this context 

spelling variants refer to alternative (sub-standard) spellings recognized by SAMA which are 

mostly related to the possible overlap between orthographically similar letters, such as the 

various shapes of hamzahs (أ إ ا آ), taa’ marboutah and haa’ (ه ة), and yaa’ and alif maqsoura 

 .(ي ى)

2 Methodology 

To deal with unknown (or out-of-vocabulary) words, we use a pipeline approach which predicts 

part-of-speech tags and morpho-syntactic features before lemmatization. In the first stage of the 

pipeline, we use MADA (Roth et al., 2008), an SVM-based tool that relies on the word context to 

assign POS tags and morpho-syntactic features. MADA internally uses the SAMA morphological 

analyser (Maamouri et al., 2010), an updated version of Buckalter morphology (Buckwalter, 

2004). Second, we develop a finite-state morphological guesser that can provide all the possible 

interpretations of a given word. The morphological guesser first takes an Arabic surface form as a 

whole and then strips all possible affixes and clitics off one by one until all possible analyses are 

exhausted. The morphological guesser is highly non-deterministic as it outputs a large number of 

solutions. To counteract this non-determinism, all the solutions are matched against the POS and 

morpho-syntactic tag output for the full surface token by MADA and the analysis with the closest 

resemblance (i.e. the analysis with the largest number of matching morphological features) is 

selected. 

Beside the complexity of lemmatization described in Section 1.1, the problem is further 

compounded when dealing with unknown words that cannot be matched by existing lexicons. 

This requires the development of a finite-state guesser to list all the possible interpretations of an 

unknown string of letters (explained in detail in Section 3). 

86



To identify, extract and lemmatize unknown Arabic words we use the following sequence of 

processing steps (Figure 1): 

 A corpus of 1,089,111,204 tokens (7,348,173 types) is analysed with MADA. 

 The number of types for which MADA could not find an analysis in the Buckwalter 

morphological analyser is 2,116,180 (about 29 % of the types).  

 

FIGURE 1 – Lemmatization process 

 These unknown types were spell checked by the Microsoft Arabic spell checker using 

MS Office 2010. Among the unknown types of 2,116,180, the number of types accepted 

as correct is 208,188. The advantage of using spell checking at this stage is that it 

provides significant filtration of the forms (almost 90 % reduction) and retains a more 

compact, more manageable, and better quality list of entries to deal with in further 

processing. The disadvantage is that there is no guarantee that all word forms not 

accepted by the MS speller are actually spelling mistakes (or that all the ones accepted 

are correct). 

 We select types with frequency of 10 or more of the types accepted by the MS spell 

checker. This results in a total of 40,277 types. 

 We use the full POS tags and morpho-syntactic features produced by MADA. 

 We use the finite-state morphological guesser to produce all possible morphological 

interpretations and relevant lemmatizations. 

 We compare the POS tags and morphosyntactic features in MADA output with the 

output of the morphological guesser and choose the one with the highest matching score. 

For testing and evaluation we gold annotate 1,310 words randomly selected from the 40,277 

types, providing the gold lemma, the gold POS and lexicographic preference for inclusion in a 

dictionary. It is to be noted that working with the 2,116,180 types before filtering out possible 

spelling errors will require annotating a much larger gold standard.

3 Morphological Guesser 

Arabic morphotactics allows words to be concatenated with a comparatively large number of 

clitics (Attia, 2006). Clitics themselves can be concatenated one after the other. Furthermore, 

clitics undergo assimilation with word stems and with each other, which makes them even harder 

to handle using surface features only. A verb can comprise up to four tokens (a conjunction, 

complementizer, verb stem and object pronoun) as illustrated in Table 1. Moreover the verb stem 

can be prefixed and suffixed with bound morphemes that mark the morpho-syntactic features of 

tense, number, gender, person, voice and mood. The lemma resides as a nucleus inside layers of 

proclitics, prefixes, suffixes and enclitics. A verb lemma like شكر ‘$akara’ “to thank” can 

generate up to 9,552 different valid forms.

TABLE 2 – Proclitics, enclitics, prefixes and suffixes with Arabic nouns 

Similarly a noun stem can be attached to up to three clitics as shown in Table 2. Although Table 

2 shows four clitics, we note that the definite article and the genitive (or possessive) pronoun are 

mutually exclusive. Nominal stems can also be suffixed with bound morphemes that mark the 

morpho-syntactic features of number, gender and case. a typical noun like معلم ‘muEal~im’ 

‘teacher’, generates 519 valid forms. 

88



We develop a finite state (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003; Hulden, 2009) morphological 
guesser for Arabic that can analyse unknown words with all possible clitics, morpho-
syntactic affixes and all relevant alteration operations that include insertion, assimilation, 
and deletion. Beesley and Karttunen (2003) give some advice on how to create a basic 
guesser. The core idea of a guesser is to assume that a stem is composed of any arbitrary 
sequence of non-numeric characters, and this stem can be prefixed and/or suffixed with a 
predefined set of prefixes, suffixes or clitics. The guesser marks clitic boundaries and tries 
to return the stem to its default unmarked form, the lemma. Due to the nondeterministic 
nature of the guesser, there will be a multitude of possible lemmas for each form. The 
Arabic FST guesser consists of three parts: a lexc file, alteration rules and an XFST 
compilation file. First, there is the lexc file (Figure 2) with lexicons and continuation classes 
for the Arabic guesser. The lexc file specifies that there is an optional conjunction, followed 
by an optional preposition, followed by an optional definite article before the Arabic noun.

FIGURE 2 – Snapshot of the Arabic lexc file 

Second, there are the alteration rules which handle the morphological processes of assimilation 

and deletion. In our system there are about 130 replace rules to handle alterations that affect 

verbs, nouns, adjectives and function words when they undergo inflections or are attached to 

affixes and clitics. They take the form of XFST replace rules: 

 
A -> w || "+pres" Alphabet _ Alphabet 

 

89



The example rule indicates that ‘A’ changes to ‘w’ under the condition of having the left context 

‘+pres’ and a single alphabetical character and the right context of another alphabetical character. 

Following this rule the verb قال qAl “to say” will change to يقول yaqwl in the present tense form. 

 

Third, there are the XFST compilation rules which bind components together. They replace 
the multivariable words ‘GUESSNOUNSTEM’ and ‘GUESSVERBSTEM’ with the relevant 
alphabet using the ‘substitute defined’ command. The XFST commands in our guesser are 
stated as follows.  

 
define Alphabet 
define PossNounStem [[Alphabet]^{2,24}] "+Guess":0; 
define PossVerbStem [[Alphabet]^{2,6}] "+Guess":0; 
substitute defined PossNounStem for "^GUESSNOUNSTEM^" 
substitute defined PossVerbStem for "^GUESSVERBSTEM^" 
 

This states that a possible noun stem is defined as any sequence of Arabic non-numeric 
characters of length between 2 and 24 characters.  A possible verb stem is between 2 and 6 
characters. This word stem is surrounded by prefixes, suffixes, proclitics and enclitics. 
Clitics are considered as independent tokens and are separated by the ‘@’ sign, while 
prefixes and suffixes are considered as morpho-syntactic features and are interpreted with 
tags preceded by the ‘+’ sign. Below we present the analysis of the noun ََقون -wa-Al والُمَسوِّ
musaw~iquwna “and-the-marketers”, and the verb َسيَأُْخُذنا sa-ya'xu*unA “will-take-us”.

For a list of 40,277 unknown word types, the morphological guesser produces an average of 12.6 

possible interpretations per word. This is highly non-deterministic when compared to the finite 

state morphological analyser (Attia et al., 2011) which has an average of 2.1 solutions per known 

word. We also note that 97 % of the gold lemmas in our test set are found among the finite-state 

guesser's choices, which indicates the high performance of the guesser. 

4 Testing and Evaluation 

To evaluate our methodology we create a manually annotated gold standard test suite of 

randomly selected surface form types as mentioned in Section 2. For these surface forms, the 

gold lemma and part of speech are manually provided. In addition, a human annotator indicates a 

preference on whether or not to include the entry in a dictionary, that is whether a lemmatized 

form makes a valid dictionary entry or not. We noticed that most of the forms marked by the 

annotator as not fitting for inclusion in a dictionary were proper nouns, misspelled words, 

colloquial words, and words that form a part of a multiword expression. By contrast, nouns, verbs 

adjectives, and proper nouns with significantly high frequency were marked for inclusion in the 

lexical database. It is to be mentioned that proper nouns in Arabic are not orthographically 

distinguished from other words, i.e. there is no capitalization in Arabic as is the case in European 

languages. This feature of lexicographic preference helps to evaluate our lemma weighting 

algorithm discussed in Section 4.2. The size of the test suite is 1,310 word form types.  

We observe that proper nouns are the most frequent category (45 %) among the unknown words 

types in the data, and they also cover about 61 % of the unknown token instances in the gold 

annotated dataset. The POS distribution of the unknown token types of our annotated data is 

shown in Table 3. As expected, most unknown words are open class words: proper names, nouns, 

adjectives, and, to a lesser degree, verbs.

4.1 Evaluating Lemmatization 

In the evaluation experiment we measure accuracy calculated as the number of correct tags 

divided by the count of all tags. The baseline is given by the assumption that new words appear 

in their base form, i.e., we do not need to lemmatize them. The baseline accuracy is 45 %. The 

POS tagging baseline proposes the most frequent tag (proper name) for all unknown words. In 

our test data accuracy stands also at 45 %. We notice that MADA POS tagging accuracy for 

unknown words is unexpectedly low (60 %) as shown in Table 4. We use Voted POS Tagging, 

that is we choose the POS tag assigned most frequently in the data to a lemma. This method has 

improved the tagging results significantly (Table 4). 

As for the lemmatization process, our first experiment in the pipeline-based lemmatization 

approach obtains a higher score (54 %) than the baseline (45 %) as shown in Table 5.

1 POS Tagging baseline 45 % 

2 MADA POS tagging 60 % 

3 Voted POS Tagging 69 % 

TABLE 4 – Evaluation of POS tagging of unknown words 

Examining the data further, we notice that when a proper noun is prefixed with the definite article 

“Al”, the definite article is not stripped off in the gold annotation and is considered as part of the 

lemma, such as القشيري ‘Al-qu$ayriy’. In MADA morpho-syntactic tagging, the definite article is 

considered as a clitic and not part of the lemma. When this difference is ignored in the second 

experiment, the lemmatization accuracy increases from 54 % to 63 %. A more detailed error 

analysis will help devise better heuristics to increase the accuracy of the pipeline-based 

lemmatization. For example, in the gold annotation some regular feminine and masculine plural 

forms are considered as pluralia tantum, while in the automatic lemmatization they are reduced 

to their singular forms, such as حجوزات HujuwzAt “bookings”.

The test results indicate significant improvements over the baseline. However, we expect that 

substantial further improvements can be obtained through further extensive error analysis and 

developing refined heuristics. 

4.2 Evaluating Lemma Weighting 

We create a weighting algorithm for ranking and prioritizing unknown words in Arabic so that 

important words that are valid for inclusion in a lexicon are pushed up the list and less interesting 

words (from a lexicographic point of view) are pushed down. This is meant to facilitate the effort 

of manual revision by making sure that the top part of the stack contains the words with highest 

priority.  

In our case we have 40,277 unknown token types. After lemmatization they are reduced to 

18,399 types (that is 54 % reduction of the surface forms). This number is still too big for manual 

validation. In order to address this issue we devise a weighting algorithm for ranking so that the 

top n number of words will include the most lexicographically relevant words. We call surface 

forms that share the same lemma ‘sister forms’, and we call the lemma that they share the 

‘mother lemma’. The weighting algorithm is based on three criteria: number of sister forms, 

cumulative frequency of the sister forms, and a POS factor. The POS factor gives 50 extra points 

to verbs, 30 to to nouns and adjectives, and nothing to proper nouns. This is meant to penalize 

proper nouns due to their high frequency which is disproportionate to other categories. The 

parameters of the weighting algorithm have been tuned through several rounds of 

experimentation. 

Word Weight = ((number of sister forms * 800) +  

         cumulative sum of frequencies of sister forms) / 2 +  

       POS factor 

We use the gold annotated data for the evaluation of the lemma weighting  criteria, as shown in 

Table 6. We notice that the combined criteria gives the best balance between increasing the 

number of lexicographically-relevant words in the top 100 words and reducing the number of 

lexicographically-relevant words in the bottom 100 words.

TABLE 7 – Sample entries selected from the unknown words lexicon 

As the corpus is composed mainly of news articles, we assume that the distribution of proper 

nouns is artificial and arbitrary as it depends, to a large extent, on the specific date and time of an 

event or series of events that occupies the news for a certain (short-term or long-term) duration. 

For example, as Table 7 shows, Obama and Sarkozy ranked top of the list of unknown words, but 

94



now as Sarkozy is no longer the French president and the fate of Obama will be determined in the 

next presidential election in America, whether these names will continue to maintain the same 

level of frequency is questionable. This is why verbs, adjectives and nouns constitute the core of 

the language lexicon, while proper nouns are, to some extent, temporal and transient and the 

frequency of their use tends to shift from time to time. 

Conclusion 

We have developed a methodology for automatically updating an Arabic dictionary by extracting 

unknown words from data and lemmatizing them in order to relate multiple surface forms to their 

canonical underlying representation using a finite-state guesser and a machine learning tool for 

disambiguation. We have developed a weighting mechanism for simulating a human decision on 

whether or not to include new words in a general-domain lexical database. We have shown the 

feasibility of a highly non-deterministic finite state guesser in an essential application. Out of a 

word list of 40,255 unknown words we created a lexicon of 18,399 lemmatized, POS-tagged and 

weighted entries. We have made our unknown word lexicon available as a free open source 

resource (http://arabic-unknowns.sourceforge.net/).
