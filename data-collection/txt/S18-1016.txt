Abstract

This paper presents an emotion classification
system for English tweets, submitted for the
SemEval shared task on Affect in Tweets, sub-
task 5: Detecting Emotions. The system com-
bines lexicon, n-gram, style, syntactic and se-
mantic features. For this multi-class multi-
label problem, we created a classifier chain.
This is an ensemble of eleven binary classi-
fiers, one for each possible emotion category,
where each model gets the predictions of the
preceding models as additional features. The
predicted labels are combined to get a multi-
label representation of the predictions. Our
system was ranked eleventh among thirty five
participating teams, with a Jaccard accuracy
of 52.0% and macro- and micro-average F1-
scores of 49.3% and 64.0%, respectively.

1 Introduction

Most research in the domain of sentiment analy-
sis focuses on the automatic prediction of polar-
ity or valence in text, but also the detection of
emotions has attracted growing interest in the last
couple of years (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez,
2017). Although emotion detection is a rather new
research focus in NLP, the study of emotions has
a long history in fields like psychology and neuro-
imaging. Many different frameworks exist, but the
specific emotion approach, in which emotions are
classified as specific discrete categories, predomi-
nates. In a lot of those approaches, some emotions
are considered more basic than others, with Ek-
man’s theory of six basic emotions (joy, sadness,
anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) (Ekman, 1992)
as the most well-known. Another popular theory is
Plutchik’s wheel of emotions (Plutchik, 1980), in
which joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise,
trust, and anticipation are considered most basic.

Emotion analysis in NLP makes use of the
frameworks developed by psychologists, mostly

by employing categorical models of (basic) emo-
tions. In traditional emotion classification tasks, a
‘document’ or sentence is classified under one or
more emotion classes (or classified as neutral/no
class when no emotions are present). Such emo-
tion classification systems have been developed
and tested on different kinds of data, including
fairy tales (Alm et al., 2005), newspaper head-
lines (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), chat mes-
sages (e.g. Holzman and Pottenger, 2003; Brooks
et al., 2013), and tweets (e.g. Mohammad, 2012;
Wang et al., 2012). The big advantage of using
tweet datasets is the relative ease with which twit-
ter data can be collected and the possibility of us-
ing hashtags as emotion labels (distant supervision
approach).

For this paper, we used the data that was col-
lected for the SemEval shared task on Affect in
Tweets (Mohammad et al., 2018), a collection of
tweets annotated for eleven emotions: anger, an-
ticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pes-
simism, sadness, surprise, and trust (Mohammad
and Kiritchenko, 2018). We participated in Sub-
task 5: Detecting Emotions (English emotion clas-
sification).

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: in Section 2 we describe how we first ana-
lyzed the data in order to get more insight in the
task. Section 3 discusses how the data was pre-
processed and which information sources were ex-
tracted. Next, in Section 4 the actual experimental
setup and results are discussed and we end this pa-
per with a conclusion in Section 5.

2 Data analysis

We first analyzed the training data provided by the
task organizers, which consisted of 6838 tweets.
We found that disgust, anger and joy were present
in the largest numbers (present in about 35 to 40%

specified emotion is present (%).

Figure 2: Proportion of training tweets in which a spe-
cific amount of emotion classes is present (%).

of the tweets), while surprise and trust only occur
in around 5% of the tweets (Figure 1). Only three
percent of the tweets was annotated as neutral.

As can be derived from Figure 2, most tweets
contained two or three emotions (together 70%),
and in only about 1% of the tweets five or more
(max six) emotions were present. We also cal-
culated the correlations and found ten emotion
pairs that were moderately or highly correlated
(‖phi‖ ≥ 0.30 for moderate correlation, ‖phi‖ ≥
0.50 for high correlation, according to Cohen’s
conventions on effect size (Cohen, 1988)). The
correlated pairs are shown in Table 1 and suggest
that the classification performance can be boosted
when correlations between emotion categories are
implemented in the model.

In order to get more insight into the data, we re-
annotated a subset of 500 tweets from the training
set. In Table 2, inter-annotator agreement (IAA)
scores per emotion class between the gold labels
and our annotations are presented. Except for
anger and joy these scores are rather low. Overall,
we assigned less emotion classes to a tweet than
the official annotators. We often disagreed with
the gold labels and had the feeling that the anno-

tators of the official labels focused too much on
lexical clues instead of keeping the context and the
perspective of the writer of the tweet in mind. This
leads us to presume that the threshold to assign an
emotion label to a tweet when two out of seven
annotators agreed (Mohammad and Kiritchenko,
2018) might have been a bit too generous.

We further noticed that some tweets appeared
twice in the data set, but not completely identi-
cally: we suspect that one of them was the original
tweet with emotion hashtag and the other one with
the hashtag removed. An example:

(1) a. Whatever you decide to do make sure it
makes you #happy.

b. Whatever you decide to do make sure it
makes you .

Since labels differed depending on the presence
or absence of the emotion hashtag, we decided to
keep both variants in our training set.

3 Preprocessing & Feature Extraction

3.1 Preprocessing
While we did not remove the ‘almost identical’
tweets from the data set, there were also some
tweets in the training set that were completely
identical but had been assigned other emotion la-
bels. For those tweets, we took the majority class
for each binary emotion category, and removed
all other instances. This reduced our training set
from 6838 to 6782 tweets. No duplicates were
present in the development set, so the amount of

124



886 tweets was preserved. In the updated training
set, as well as in the development and test set, all
user names were replaced with the generic @ID.

All tweets were processed with Weka (Witten
et al., 2016) using the Affective Tweets pack-
age (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017), in
order to extract lexicon and word embedding fea-
tures. We used the default preprocessing set-
tings for each filter. For the other features, we
performed word and sentence tokenization (us-
ing NLTK), stemming (using spaCy), lowercas-
ing, and POS-tagging (simple and detailed, cor-
responding to spaCy’s POS and Tag function).

3.2 Feature extraction

For our supervised classification system, we em-
ployed features that measure different aspects of
the tweet. These can be subsumed under five dif-
ferent categories: lexicon features (see Table 3 for
an overview), n-gram features (binary, n equal to
3, 4 and 5 for characters and n equal to 1 or 2 for
tokens), and various style, syntactic and semantic
features (see Table 4).

Regarding the latter category, both features
from traditional and distributional semantics were
integrated. We first took the synset depth (dis-
tance to root) of all content words (calculated
with WordNet (Miller, 1995)) and averaged the
scores to get a mean synset depth for the tweet.
Furthermore, we included two types of features
from distributional semantics, namely word em-
beddings and word clusters. The word embed-
dings were extracted with Weka Affective Tweets,
using pre-trained embeddings from 10 million
tweets taken from the Edinburgh Twitter Cor-
pus (Petrovic et al., 2010). For the word clusters,
we downloaded a subset of around 1.5M tweets
from the SemEval 2018 AIT DISC corpus (Mo-
hammad et al., 2018). We first created word em-
beddings with word2vec using both skipgram and
continuous bow and afterwards applied k-means
clustering on the resulting word vectors. We ex-
perimented with various cluster sizes (800 of size
100, 1000 of size 100 and 800 of size 300). These
clusters were implemented as binary features.

4 Experiments & Results

4.1 Baseline & Binary Experiments

We trained different models on the training set and
tested them on the development set, using scikit-
learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). For the baseline ex-

periments, we used an SVM classifier with linear
kernel (LinearSVC) and used the lexicon features
from the Weka Affective Tweets package. The re-
sults for each binary classifier are shown in Table
5 (second column). Combining the predictions of
these eleven binary classifiers resulted in a jaccard
accuracy of 42.7%.

Before optimizing the separate classifiers, we
took a more detailed look at the lexicon features
and the clusters to assess whether it is beneficial
to use only a part of the lexicons (e.g. only the
emotion lexicons) or whether it is better to use
all lexicons (even polarity lexicons). We found
that the combination of all lexicons (including
the valence-arousal-dominance lexicon of War-
riner et al. (2013)) gave the highest performance.
As regards the clusters, we tried all cluster types
on each emotion category and picked the cluster
that gave the highest performance on that particu-
lar category.

For every emotion category, we tested different
classifiers on different combinations of features.
The classifiers we used, were SVM, SGD (linear
SVM with stochastic gradient descent learning),
Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Table
5 shows the F1-scores (in bold) on the positive
class for the best performing classifiers and feature
combinations, which are significantly higher than
the baseline results. We joined the predictions of
these optimized binary classifiers, and achieved a
jaccard accuracy of 47.7%.

4.2 Classifier Chain

Because the emotion categories are highly corre-
lated (see Section 2), we envisaged to implement
these relations in the model by using a classifier
chain. We combined the best performing classifier
per emotion category in a chain that passes pre-
dicted labels on to the next classifiers. We ordered
the classifiers by performance on the positive class
F1-score on the baseline (the emotion that is eas-
iest to predict first, the emotion that is the most
difficult to predict last). On the development set,
this classifier chain approach led to a jaccard accu-
racy of 52.37%, which is significantly higher than
the score without classifier chain (47.7%, see Sec-
tion 4.1).

In our final model, the training and develop-
ment data were joined, resulting in a combined
training set of 7668 tweets. During the evalua-
tion period, we achieved 52.0% jaccard accuracy,
64.0% micro-avg F1-score and 49.3% macro-avg
F1-score on the held-out test set (see Table 6).

4.3 Discussion

As can be derived from Table 7 the number of false
positives is rather low for all emotion classes (be-

low 20% for most emotions). The model had most
trouble with recognizing positive instances of sur-
prise, pessimism, and trust, but also love and an-
ticipation were more challenging. For these cate-
gories, the false negative rate was thus very high.
We assume that these bad results are mostly due
to a lack of sufficient training data for these cate-
gories.

We evaluated all features by computing the
ANOVA F-values, and extracted the hundred most
predictive features for each emotion category. For
all emotions, the top 100 features consisted exclu-
sively of lexical information. In none of the emo-
tion categories, style or syntactic features occurred
in this top 100. However, features regarding la-
bels of preceding classifiers belonged to the most
predictive features for all emotions except for op-
timism and surprise.

5 Conclusion

Our emotion classification system for English
tweets achieved 52.0% jaccard accuracy on the
held-out test set. We started from binary classi-
fiers which we optimized for each emotion cate-
gory separately, and combined them in a classifier
chain. We proved that passing on labels from pre-
viously predicted emotions categories improves
the performance significantly. For future work,
it would be interesting to investigate the model’s
performance on other datasets than twitter data.
