Abstract

We introduce SOCIAL IQA, the first large-
scale benchmark for commonsense reasoning
about social situations. SOCIAL IQA contains
38,000 multiple choice questions for prob-
ing emotional and social intelligence in a va-
riety of everyday situations (e.g., Q: “Jor-
dan wanted to tell Tracy a secret, so Jor-
dan leaned towards Tracy. Why did Jordan
do this?” A: “Make sure no one else could
hear”). Through crowdsourcing, we collect
commonsense questions along with correct
and incorrect answers about social interac-
tions, using a new framework that mitigates
stylistic artifacts in incorrect answers by ask-
ing workers to provide the right answer to a
different but related question. Empirical re-
sults show that our benchmark is challenging
for existing question-answering models based
on pretrained language models, compared to
human performance (>20% gap). Notably,
we further establish SOCIAL IQA as a re-
source for transfer learning of commonsense
knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on multiple commonsense reasoning
tasks (Winograd Schemas, COPA).

1 Introduction

Social and emotional intelligence enables humans
to reason about the mental states of others and
their likely actions (Ganaie and Mudasir, 2015).
For example, when someone spills food all over
the floor, we can infer that they will likely want to
clean up the mess, rather than taste the food off the
floor or run around in the mess (Figure 1, middle).
This example illustrates how Theory of Mind, i.e.,
the ability to reason about the implied emotions
and behavior of others, enables humans to nav-
igate social situations ranging from simple con-
versations with friends to complex negotiations in
courtrooms (Apperly, 2010).

? Both authors contributed equally.

REASONING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

(a) taste the food
(b) mop up ✔
(c) run around in the mess

What will Alex 
want to do next? A

Alex spilled the food she just prepared all over 
the floor and it made a huge mess.

Q

REASONING ABOUT EMOTIONAL REACTIONS

(a) sorry for the villain
(b) hopeful that Robin 

will succeed ✔
(c) like Robin should lose

How would others 
feel afterwards?

In the school play, Robin played a hero in the 
struggle to the death with the angry villain.

AQ

REASONING ABOUT MOTIVATION

Why did Tracy 
do this?

Tracy had accidentally pressed upon Austin in 
the small elevator and it was awkward.

(a) get very close to Austin
(b) squeeze into the 

elevator ✔
(c) get flirty with Austin

AQ

Figure 1: Three context-question-answers triples from
SOCIAL IQA, along with the type of reasoning required
to answer them. In the top example, humans can triv-
ially infer that Tracy pressed upon Austin because there
was no room in the elevator. Similarly, in the bottom
example, commonsense tells us that people typically
root for the hero, not the villain.

While humans trivially acquire and develop
such social reasoning skills (Moore, 2013), this
is still a challenge for machine learning models,
in part due to the lack of large-scale resources
to train and evaluate modern AI systems’ social
and emotional intelligence. Although recent ad-
vances in pretraining large language models have
yielded promising improvements on several com-
monsense inference tasks, these models still strug-
gle to reason about social situations, as shown
in this and previous work (Davis and Marcus,



4464

2015; Nematzadeh et al., 2018; Talmor et al.,
2019). This is partly due to language models being
trained on written text corpora, where reporting
bias of knowledge limits the scope of common-
sense knowledge that can be learned (Gordon and
Van Durme, 2013; Lucy and Gauthier, 2017).

In this work, we introduce Social Intelligence
QA (SOCIAL IQA), the first large-scale resource
to learn and measure social and emotional intel-
ligence in computational models.1 SOCIAL IQA
contains 38k multiple choice questions regard-
ing the pragmatic implications of everyday, social
events (see Figure 1). To collect this data, we de-
sign a crowdsourcing framework to gather con-
texts and questions that explicitly address social
commonsense reasoning. Additionally, by com-
bining handwritten negative answers with adver-
sarial question-switched answers (Section 3.3), we
minimize annotation artifacts that can arise from
crowdsourcing incorrect answers (Schwartz et al.,
2017; Gururangan et al., 2018).

This dataset remains challenging for AI sys-
tems, with our best performing baseline reaching
64.5% (BERT-large), significantly lower than hu-
man performance. We further establish SOCIAL
IQA as a resource that enables transfer learning
for other commonsense challenges, through se-
quential finetuning of a pretrained language model
on SOCIAL IQA before other tasks. Specifically,
we use SOCIAL IQA to set a new state-of-the-art
on three commonsense challenge datasets: COPA
(Roemmele et al., 2011) (83.4%), the original
Winograd (Levesque, 2011) (72.5%), and the ex-
tended Winograd dataset from Rahman and Ng
(2012) (84.0%).

Our contributions are as follows: (1) We cre-
ate SOCIAL IQA, the first large-scale QA dataset
aimed at testing social and emotional intelligence,
containing over 38k QA pairs. (2) We introduce
question-switching, a technique to collect incor-
rect answers that minimizes stylistic artifacts due
to annotator cognitive biases. (3) We establish
baseline performance on our dataset, with BERT-
large performing at 64.5%, well below human per-
formance. (4) We achieve new state-of-the-art ac-
curacies on COPA and Winograd through sequen-
tial finetuning on SOCIAL IQA, which implicitly
endows models with social commonsense knowl-
edge.

2 Task description

SOCIAL IQA aims to measure the social and
emotional intelligence of computational models
through multiple choice question answering (QA).
In our setup, models are confronted with a ques-
tion explicitly pertaining to an observed context,
where the correct answer can be found among
three competing options.

By design, the questions require inferential rea-
soning about the social causes and effects of situa-
tions, in line with the type of intelligence required
for an AI assistant to interact with human users
(e.g., know to call for help when an elderly per-
son falls; Pollack, 2005). As seen in Figure 1,
correctly answering questions requires reasoning
about motivations, emotional reactions, or likely
preceding and following actions. Performing these
inferences is what makes us experts at navigat-
ing social situations, and is closely related to The-
ory of Mind, i.e., the ability to reason about the
beliefs, motivations, and needs of others (Baron-
Cohen et al., 1985).2 Endowing machines with
this type of intelligence has been a longstanding
but elusive goal of AI (Gunning, 2018).

2 Theory of Mind is well developed in most neurotypical
adults (Ganaie and Mudasir, 2015), but can be influenced by
age, culture, or developmental disorders (Korkmaz, 2011).

ATOMIC
As a starting point for our task creation, we
draw upon social commonsense knowledge from
ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) to seed our contexts
and question types. ATOMIC is a large knowledge
graph that contains inferential knowledge about
the causes and effects of 24k short events. Each
triple in ATOMIC consists of an event phrase with
person-centric variables, one of nine inference di-
mensions, and an inference object (e.g., “PersonX
pays for PersonY’s ”, “xAttrib”, “generous”).
The nine inference dimensions in ATOMIC cover
causes of an event (e.g., “X needs money”), its ef-
fects on the agent (e.g., “X will get thanked”) and
its effect on other participants (e.g., “Y will want
to see X again”); see Sap et al. (2019) for details.

Given this base, we generate natural language
contexts that represent specific instantiations of
the event phrases found in the knowledge graph.
Furthermore, the questions created probe the com-
monsense reasoning required to navigate such
contexts. Critically, since these contexts are based
off of ATOMIC, they explore a diverse range of
motivations and reactions, as well as likely pre-
ceding or following actions.

3 Dataset creation

SOCIAL IQA contains 37,588 multiple choice
questions with three answer choices per question.
Questions and answers are gathered through three
phases of crowdsourcing aimed to collect the con-
text, the question, and a set of positive and negative
answers. We run crowdsourcing tasks on Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to create each of
the three components, as described below.

3.1 Event Rewriting
In order to cover a variety of social situations, we
use the base events from ATOMIC as prompts for
context creation. As a pre-processing step, we
run an MTurk task that asks workers to turn an
ATOMIC event (e.g., “PersonX spills all over
the floor”) into a sentence by adding names, fixing
potential grammar errors, and filling in placehold-
ers (e.g., “Alex spilled food all over the floor.”).3

3.2 Context, Question, & Answer Creation
Next, we run a task where annotators create
full context-question-answers triples. We auto-
matically generate question templates covering

want to do next?

lected as the correct answers to the wrong question that

about what happens before instead of after an event).

the nine commonsense inference dimensions in
ATOMIC.4 Crowdsourcers are prompted with an
event sentence and an inference question to turn
into a more detailed context5 (e.g. “Alex spilled
food all over the floor and it made a huge mess.”)
and an edited version of the question if needed for
improved specificity (e.g. “What will Alex want
to do next?”). Workers are also asked to contribute
two potential correct answers.

3.3 Negative Answers

In addition to correct answers, we collect four in-
correct answer options, of which we filter out two.
To create incorrect options that are adversarial for
models but easy for humans, we use two different
approaches to the collection process. These two
methods are specifically designed to avoid differ-
ent types of annotation artifacts, thus making it
more difficult for models to rely on data biases.
We integrate and filter answer options and validate
final QA tuples with human rating tasks.

Handwritten Incorrect Answers (HIA) The
first method involves eliciting handwritten incor-
rect answers that require reasoning about the con-
text. These answers are handwritten to be similar
to the correct answers in terms of topic, length,
and style but are subtly incorrect. Two of these
answers are collected during the same MTurk task
as the original context, questions, and correct an-
swers. We will refer to these negative responses as
handwritten incorrect answers (HIA).

Question-Switching Answers (QSA) We col-
lect a second set of negative (incorrect) answer

4We do not generate templates if the ATOMIC dimension
is annotated as “none.”

5Workers were asked to contribute a context 7-25 words
longer than the event sentence.

(e.g., What will Kai want to do next?)
(e.g., How would Robin feel 

afterwards?)
(e.g., How would 

you describe Alex?)
(e.g., Why did 

Sydney do this?)

(e.g., What does 
Remy need to 

do before this?)

happen to 

Sasha?)

Figure 3: SOCIAL IQA contains several question types which cover different types of inferential reasoning. Ques-
tion types are derived from ATOMIC inference dimensions.

candidates by switching the questions asked about
the context, as shown in Figure 2. We do this to
avoid cognitive biases and annotation artifacts in
the answer candidates, such as those caused by
writing incorrect answers or negations (Schwartz
et al., 2017; Gururangan et al., 2018). In this
crowdsourcing task, we provide the same context
as the original question, as well as a question au-
tomatically generated from a different but similar
ATOMIC dimension,6 and ask workers to write
two correct answers. We refer to these negative
responses as question-switching answers (QSA).

By including answers to a different question
about the same context, we ensure that these ad-
versarial responses have the stylistic qualities of
correct answers and strongly relate to the con-
text topic, while still being incorrect, making it
difficult for models to simply perform pattern-
matching. To verify this, we compare valence,
arousal, and dominance (VAD) levels across an-
swer types, computed using the VAD lexicon by
Mohammad (2018). Figure 4 shows effect sizes
(Cohen’s d) of the differences in VAD means,
where the magnitude of effect size indicates how
different the answer types are stylistically. Indeed,
QSA and correct answers differ substantially less
than HIA answers (|d|≤.1).7

3.4 QA Tuple Creation
As the final step of the pipeline, we aggregate the
data into three-way multiple choice questions. For
each created context-question pair contributed by
crowdsourced workers, we select a random cor-
rect answer and the incorrect answers that are least
entailed by the correct one, following inspiration
from Zellers et al. (2019a).

For the training data, we validate our QA tu-
ples through a multiple-choice crowdsourcing task
where three workers are asked to select the right

sions: {xWant, oWant, xNeed, xIntent}, {xReact oReact,
xAttr}, and {xEffect, oEffect}.

7Cohen’s |d|<.20 is considered small (Sawilowsky,
2009). We find similarly small effect sizes using other senti-
ment/emotion lexicons.

three answer types have comparable levels of arousal

answer to the question provided.8 In order to en-
sure even higher quality, we validate the dev and
test data a second time with five workers. Our final
dataset contains questions for which the correct
answer was determined by human majority vot-
ing, discarding cases without a majority vote. We
also apply a lightweight form of adversarial filter-
ing to make the task more challenging by using a
deep stylistic classifier to remove easier examples
on the dev and test sets (Sakaguchi et al., 2019).9

To obtain human performance, we run a sepa-
rate task asking three new workers to select the
correct answer on a random subset of 900 dev and
900 test examples. Human performance on these
subsets is 87% and 84%, respectively.

3.5 Data Statistics

To keep contexts separate across train/dev/test
sets, we assign SOCIAL IQA contexts to the same
partition as the ATOMIC event the context was
based on. Shown in Table 1 (top), this yields a

ing set but found it did not significantly change performance.

total set of around 33k training, 2k dev, and 2k
test tuples. We additionally include statistics on
word counts and vocabulary of the training data.
We report the averages of correct and incorrect an-
swers in terms of: token length, number of unique
tokens, and number of times a unique answer ap-
pears in the dataset. Note that due to our three-way
multiple choice setup, there are twice as many in-
correct answers which influences these statistics.

We also include a breakdown (Figure 3) across
question types, which we derive from ATOMIC
inference dimensions.10 In general, questions re-
lating to what someone will feel afterwards or
what they will likely do next are more common
in SOCIAL IQA. Conversely, questions pertaining
to (potentially involuntary) effects of situations on
people are less frequent.

4 Methods

We establish baseline performance on SOCIAL
IQA, using large pretrained language models
based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani
et al., 2017). Namely, we finetune OpenAI-GPT
(Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019), which have both shown remarkable im-
provements on a variety of tasks. OpenAI-GPT
is a uni-directional language model trained on the
BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), whereas BERT is
a bidirectional language model trained on both the
BookCorpus and English Wikipedia. As per pre-
vious work, we finetune the language model rep-
resentations but fully learn the classifier specific
parameters described below.

Multiple choice classification To classify
sequences using these language models, we
follow the multiple-choice setup implementation
by the respective authors, as described below.
First, we concatenate the context, question, and
answer, using the model specific separator tokens.
For OpenAI-GPT, the format becomes start
<context> <question> delimiter
<answer> classify , where start ,
delimiter , and classify are special

function tokens. For BERT, the format is similar,
but the classifier token comes before the context.11

For each triple, we then compute a score l by

10We group agent and theme ATOMIC dimensions to-
gether (e.g., “xReact” and “oReact” become the “reactions”
question type).

where W1 ∈ RH×H , b1 ∈ RH and W2 ∈ R1×H .
Finally, we normalize scores across all triples for a
given context-question pair using a softmax layer.
The model’s predicted answer corresponds to the
triple with the highest probability.

5 Experiments

5.1 Experimental Set-up

We train our models on the 33k SOCIAL IQA train-
ing instances, selecting hyperparameters based on
the best performing model on our dev set, for
which we then report test results. Specifically, we
perform finetuning through a grid search over the
hyper-parameter settings (with a learning rate in
{1e−5, 2e−5, 3e−5}, a batch size in {3, 4, 8}, and
a number of epochs in {3, 4, 10}) and report the
maximum performance.

Models used in our experiments vary in sizes:
OpenAI-GPT (117M parameters) has a hid-
den size H=768, BERT-base (110M params)
and BERT-large (340M params) hidden sizes of
H=768 and H=1024, respectively. We train us-
ing the HuggingFace PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017)
implementation.12

Table 3: Example CQA triples from the SOCIAL IQA dev set with BERT-large’s predictions ( : BERT’s predic-
tion, X: true correct answer). The model predicts correctly in (1) and (2) and incorrectly in the other four examples
shown here. Examples (3) and (4) illustrate the model choosing answers that might have happened before, or that
might happen much later after the context, as opposed to right after the context situation. In Examples (5) and (6),
the model chooses answers that may apply to people other than the ones being asked about.

5.2 Results

Our results (Table 2) show that SOCIAL IQA is
still a challenging benchmark for existing com-
putational models, compared to human perfor-
mance. Our best performing model, BERT-large,
outperforms other models by several points on the
dev and test set. We additionally ablate our best
model’s representation by removing the context
and question from the input, confirming that rea-
soning over both is necessary for this task.

Learning Curve To better understand the ef-
fect of dataset scale on model performance on
our task, we simulate training situations with lim-
ited knowledge. We present the learning curve
of BERT-large’s performance on the dev set as
it is trained on more training set examples (Fig-
ure 5). Although the model does significantly im-
prove over a random baseline of 33% with only
a few hundred examples, the performance only
starts to converge after around 20k examples, pro-
viding evidence that large-scale benchmarks are
required for this type of reasoning.

Error Analysis We include a breakdown of our
best model’s performance on various question
types in Figure 6 and specific examples of errors
in the last four rows of Table 3. Overall, questions
related to pre-conditions of the context (people’s
motivations, actions needed before the context) are
less challenging for the model. Conversely, the
model seems to struggle more with questions re-
lating to (potentially involuntary) effects, stative
descriptions, and what people will want to do next.

Examples of errors in Table 3 further indicate
that, instead of doing advanced reasoning about
situations, models may only be learning lexical as-
sociations between the context, question, and an-
swers, as hinted at by Marcus (2018) and Zellers
et al. (2019b). This leads the model to select
answers with incorrect timing (examples 3 and
4) or answers pertaining to the wrong partici-
pants (examples 5 and 6), despite being trained on
large amounts of examples that specifically distin-
guish proper timing and participants. For instance,
in (3) and (4), the model selects answers which

are incorrectly timed with respect to the context
and question (e.g., “arrive at a hotel” is some-
thing Remy likely did before checking in with
the concierge, not afterwards). Additionally, the
model often chooses answers related to a person
other than the one asked about. In (6), after the
arm wrestling, though it is likely that Aubrey will
feel ashamed, the question relates to what Alex
might feel–not Aubrey.

Overall, our results illustrate how reasoning
about social situations still remains a challenge for
these models, compared to humans who can triv-
ially reason about the causes and effects for mul-
tiple participants. We expect that this task would
benefit from models capable of more complex rea-
soning about entity state, or models that are more
explicitly endowed with commonsense (e.g., from
knowledge graphs like ATOMIC).

6 SOCIAL IQA for Transfer Learning

In addition to being the first large-scale bench-
mark for social commonsense, we also show that
SOCIAL IQA can improve performance on down-
stream tasks that require commonsense, namely
the Winograd Schema Challenge and the Choice
of Plausible Alternatives task. We achieve state of
the art performance on both tasks by sequentially
finetuning on SOCIAL IQA before the task itself.

COPA The Choice of Plausible Alternatives
task (COPA; Roemmele et al., 2011) is a two-
way multiple choice task which aims to measure
commonsense reasoning abilities of models. The
dataset contains 1,000 questions (500 dev, 500
test) that ask about the causes and effects of a
premise. This has been a challenging task for

computational systems, partially due to the limited
amount of training data available. As done previ-
ously (Goodwin et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2016), we
finetune our models on the dev set, and report per-
formance only on the test set.

Winograd Schema The Winograd Schema
Challenge (WSC; Levesque, 2011) is a well-
known commonsense knowledge challenge
framed as a coreference resolution task. It
contains a collection of 273 short sentences in
which a pronoun must be resolved to one of
two antecedents (e.g., in “The city councilmen
refused the demonstrators a permit because they
feared violence”, they refers to the councilmen).
Because of data scarcity in WSC, Rahman and Ng
(2012) created 943 Winograd-style sentence pairs
(1886 sentences in total), henceforth referred to
as DPR, which has been shown to be slightly less
challenging than WSC for computational models.

We evaluate on these two benchmarks. While
the DPR dataset is split into train and test sets
(Rahman and Ng, 2012), the WSC dataset con-
tains a single (test) set of only 273 instances for
evaluation purposes only. Therefore, we use the
DPR dataset as training set when evaluating on the
WSC dataset.

6.1 Sequential Finetuning

We first finetune BERT-large on SOCIAL IQA,
which reaches 66% on our dev set (Table 2).
We then finetune that model further on the task-
specific datasets, considering the same set of hy-
perparameters as in §5.1. On each of the test sets,

we report best, mean, and standard deviation of all
models, and compare sequential finetuning results
to a BERT-large baseline.

Results Shown in Table 4, sequential finetun-
ing on SOCIAL IQA yields substantial improve-
ments over the BERT-only baseline (between 2.6
and 5.5% max performance increases), as well as
the general increase in performance stability (i.e.,
lower standard deviations). As hinted at by Phang
et al. (2019), this suggests that BERT-large can
benefit from both the large scale and the QA for-
mat of commonsense knowledge in SOCIAL IQA,
which it struggles to learn from small benchmarks
only. Notably, we find that sequentially finetuned
BERT-SOCIAL IQA achieves state-of-the-art re-
sults on all three tasks, showing improvements of
previous best performing models.13

Effect of scale and knowledge type To bet-
ter understand these improvements in downstream
task performance, we investigate the impact on
COPA performance of sequential finetuning on
less SOCIAL IQA training data (Figure 7), as well
as the impact of the type of commonsense knowl-
edge used in sequential finetuning. As expected,
the downstream performance on COPA improves
when using a model pretrained on more of SO-
CIAL IQA, indicating that the scale of the dataset

on COPA, but that result was not published, nor discussed in
the OpenAI-GPT white paper (Radford et al., 2018).

is one factor that helps in the fine-tuning. How-
ever, when using SWAG (a similarly sized dataset)
instead of SOCIAL IQA for sequential finetuning,
the downstream performance on COPA is lower
(76.2%). This indicates that, in addition to its
large scale, the social and emotional nature of the
knowledge in SOCIAL IQA enables improvements
on these downstream tasks.

Commonsense Benchmarks: Commonsense
benchmark creation has been well-studied by
previous work. Notably, the WinoGrad Schema
Challenge (WSC; Levesque, 2011) and the
Choice Of Plausible Alternatives dataset (COPA;
Roemmele et al., 2011) are expert-curated collec-
tions of commonsense QA pairs that are trivial
for humans to solve. Whereas WSC requires
physical and social commonsense knowledge to
solve, COPA targets the knowledge of causes
and effects surrounding social situations. While
both benchmarks are of high-quality and created
by experts, their small scale (150 and 1,000
examples, respectively) poses a challenge for
modern modelling techniques, which require
many training instances.

More recently, Talmor et al. (2019) intro-
duce CommonsenseQA, containing 12k multiple-
choice questions. Crowdsourced using Concept-
Net (Speer and Havasi, 2012), these questions
mostly probe knowledge related to factual and
physical commonsense (e.g., “Where would I not
want a fox?”). In contrast, SOCIAL IQA explicitly
separates contexts from questions, and focuses on
the types of commonsense inferences humans per-
form when navigating social situations.

Commonsense Knowledge Bases: In addition
to large-scale benchmarks, there is a wealth of
work aimed at creating commonsense knowledge
repositories (Speer and Havasi, 2012; Sap et al.,
2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Lenat, 1995; Espinosa
and Lieberman, 2005; Gordon and Hobbs, 2017)
that can be used as resources in downstream rea-
soning tasks. While SOCIAL IQA is formatted as
a natural language QA benchmark, rather than a
taxonomic knowledge base, it also can be used as
a resource for external tasks, as we have demon-
strated experimentally.

Constrained or Adversarial Data Collection:
Various work has investigated ways to circumvent
annotation artifacts that result from crowdsourc-
ing. Sharma et al. (2018) extend the Story Cloze
data by severely restricting the incorrect story end-
ing generation task, reducing the sentiment and
negation artifacts. Rajpurkar et al. (2018) create
an adversarial version of the extractive question-
answering challenge, SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016), by creating 50k unanswerable questions.
Instead of using human-generated incorrect an-
swers, Zellers et al. (2018, 2019b) use adversarial
filtering of machine generated incorrect answers to
minimize surface patterns. Our dataset also aims
to reduce annotation artifacts by using a multi-
stage annotation pipeline in which we collect neg-
ative responses from multiple methods including a
unique adversarial question-switching technique.

8 Conclusion

We present SOCIAL IQA, the first large-scale
benchmark for social commonsense. Consisting
of 38k multiple-choice questions, SOCIAL IQA
covers various types of inference about people’s
actions being described in situational contexts.
We design a crowdsourcing framework for col-
lecting QA pairs that reduces stylistic artifacts of
negative answers through an adversarial question-
switching method. Despite human performance
of close to 90%, computational approaches based
on large pretrained language models only achieve
accuracies up to 65%, suggesting that these so-
cial inferences are still a challenge for AI systems.
In addition to providing a new benchmark, we
demonstrate how transfer learning from SOCIAL
IQA to other commonsense challenges can yield
significant improvements, achieving new state-of-
the-art performance on both COPA and Winograd
Schema Challenge datasets.
