Abstract 

This paper shows how a lexicon grammar dictionary of English phrasal verbs (PV) can be trans-

formed into an electronic dictionary, in order to accurately identify PV in large corpora within 

the linguistic development environment, NooJ.  The NooJ program is an alternative to statistical 

methods commonly used in NLP:  all PV are listed in a dictionary and then located by means of 

a PV grammar in both continuous and discontinuous format.  Results are then refined with a 

series of dictionaries, disambiguating grammars, filters, and other linguistics resources.  The 

main advantage of such a program is that all PV can be identified in any corpus.  The only 

drawback is that PV not listed in the dictionary (e.g., archaic forms, recent neologisms) are not 

identified; however, new PV can easily be added to the electronic dictionary, which is freely 

available to all.  

1 Introduction  

Although described as early as the 1700’s, English phrasal verbs (PV) or verb-particle combinations, 

such as figure out, look up, turn on, etc. have long been considered a characteristic trait of the English 

language and are to this day one of the most difficult features of English to master for non-native speak-

ers.  PV began attracting the attention of linguists in the early 1900’s with Kennedy’s (1920) classic 

study.  Many have reiterated his historical analysis, such as Konishi (1958:122), who also finds a steady 

growth of these combinations after Old English, a slight drop during the Age of Reason – with authors 

such as Dryden and Johnson who avoided such “grammatical irregularities” – followed by a new ex-

pansion in the 19th century.  

A renewal of interest in PV arose in the 1970’s, with the works of Bolinger (1971:xi), who associated 

PV with a “creativeness that surpasses anything else in our language” and Fraser (1976), who first pre-

sented detailed descriptions of PV transformations.  In particular, he studied constraints on particle po-

sition.  Although many PV allow movement (figure out the answer, figure the answer out), if the direct 

object is a pronoun, it can only appear before the particle (figure it out, *figure out it).  Fraser (1976:19) 

also showed that some PV idioms prohibit particle movement (e.g., dance up a storm, *dance a storm 

up) whereas others permit movement (e.g., turn back the clock or turn the clock back).   

More recently, Hampe (2002), in her corpus-based study of semantic redundancy in English, suggests 

that compositional PV can function as an “index of emotional involvement of the speaker,” and today, 

linguists and computer scientists debate the status of compositional vs. idiomatic PV.  Whereas idiomatic 

PV, such break up the audience “cause to laugh” or burn out the teacher “exhaust,” cannot be derived 

from the meaning of the verb plus particle and must be clearly listed in the lexicon, compositional PV, 

such as drink up the milk or boot up the computer, can be derived from the meaning of the regular verb.  

In this case, the particle simply functions as an intensifier (e.g., rev up the engine), aspect marker (e.g., 

lock up the car), or an adverbial noting direction (e.g., drive up prices).  Although these are strong 

arguments in favor of separating compositional from idiomatic PV, Machonis (2009) suggests a disad-

vantage of treating compositional PV separately from frozen ones in that simple verb entries can become 

enormously complex when all English particles – Fraser (1976) lists fifteen different particles – are 

taken into account.

PV present one of the thorniest problems for Natural Language Processing; in fact, Sag et al. (2002: 

14) state multiword expressions “constitute a key problem that must be resolved in order for linguisti-

cally precise NLP to succeed.”  This paper shows how a lexicon grammar dictionary can be transformed 

into an electronic dictionary, in order to correctly identify PV, both continuous and discontinuous, in 

large corpora, using multiple algorithms and filters within the linguistic development environment, NooJ 

(Silberztein, 2016).  

2 Using NooJ for Automatic PV Recognition 

2.1 Previous Work 

Previous studies using NooJ (Machonis, 2010; 2012; 2016), showed that the automatic recognition of 

PV proved to be far more complex than for other multiword expressions due to three main factors:  (1) 

their possible discontinuous nature (e.g., let out the dogs  let the dogs out), (2) their confusion with 

verbs followed by simple prepositions (e.g., Do you remember what I asked you in Rome? (verb + 

prepositional phrase) vs. Did you ask the prince in when he arrived? (PV)), and (3) genuine ambiguity 

only resolvable from context (e.g., Her neighbor was looking over the broken fence, which can mean 

either “looking above the fence” (preposition) or “examining the fence” (PV)).  Even with disambigu-

ating grammars, adverbial and adjectival expression filters, and idiom dictionaries, our previous PV 

studies using NooJ achieved only 88% precision with written texts and 78% precision with an oral cor-

pus, with most of the noise coming from the particles in and on, which are fairly tricky to distinguish 

automatically from prepositions (e.g. had a strange smile on her thin lips vs. had her hat and jacket 

on), even with the disambiguation grammars, filters, and extra dictionaries mentioned above.   

2.2 Using Lexicon Grammar Tables in Tandem with NooJ 

The NooJ platform is a freeware linguistic development environment that can be downloaded from 

http://www.nooj4nlp.net/, which allows linguists to describe several levels of linguistic phenomena and 

then apply formalized descriptions to any corpus of texts.  Instead of relying on a part of speech tagger 

that obligatorily produces a certain percentage of tagging mistakes, NooJ uses a Text Annotation Struc-

ture (TAS) that holds all unsolved ambiguities. Furthermore, these annotations, as opposed to tags, can 

represent discontinuous linguistic units, such as PV (Silberztein, 2016). 

Lexicon grammar (Gross, 1994; 1996) accentuates the reproducibility of linguistic data in the form 

of exhaustive tables or matrices, which contain both lexical and syntactic information.  For example, 

each verb in a table would be discussed by a team of linguists and marked as plus (+) or minus (-) for 

all possible complements and relevant transformations. This descriptive approach to syntax showed the 

enormous complexity of language and challenged the Chomskian model (Gross, 1979).  

 Our original PV tables included 700 entries of transitive and neutral PV1 with the particle up, 200 

with out, and 300 entries with other particles, such as away, back, down, in, off, on, over (300 entries).  

These tables are manually constructed and a sample is given in Table 1. The first two columns represent 

potential subjects, N0, which can be human, non-human, or both. This is followed by the verb, the par-

ticle, and an example of a direct object, N1.  The direct object is also classified as human, non-human, 

or both, although only one example is given.  The next column, N0 V N1, takes into consideration cases 

where the verb can have a similar meaning, even if the particle is not used.  A plus indicates that the PV 

can be used without the particle:  e.g., The chef beat up the eggs  The chef beat the eggs.   These 

would be considered compositional PV, since the verb keeps its regular meaning, but the particle is 

merely viewed as an intensifier or aspect marker, as explained in the introduction.  The next column, N1 

V Part, identifies neutral verbs, with a plus in that column indicating that the verb has both a transitive 

and intransitive linked use:  e.g., She booted up the computer  The computer booted up.  Finally, a 

plus in the N1 V column signifies that the verb can be neutral, even if the particle is not expressed:  e.g., 

The building blew, The water boiled, The computer booted.  The last column gives a synonym for the 

PV.  Note that different meanings of the same PV (e.g., beat up, blow up, bolster up) necessitate different 

values in the lexicon grammar. 

                                                      
1 Transitive PV take a direct object and have no intransitive:  e.g., The bully beat up the child, but not *The bully beat up nor 

*The child beat up.  Neutral PV (also referred to as ergative PV) take a direct object, which could also function as the subject:  

e.g., The terrorists blew up the building  The building blew up).  For more information on neutral or ergative verbs within a 

lexicon grammar framework, see Machonis (1997).

Table 1: Sample Lexicon Grammar Table:  Phrasal Verbs with the Particle up 

 

Figure 1 below is a sample of the NooJ PV Dictionary, which mirrors all of the syntactic information 

contained within the highlighted area of the lexicon grammar entry in Table 1 above. As can be seen, 

there is also a French translation of the English PV in the NooJ dictionary.  The NooJ PV Grammar in 

Figure 2 works in tandem with this dictionary to annotate PV in large corpora. The bottom portion of 

the graph represents the path for continuous PV, while the top portion of the graph represents the path 

for identifying discontinuous PV, i.e., with a noun phrase and optional adverb inserted between the verb 

and the particle.  The noun phrase has an embedded NP structure, which is explained further in 3.1.  

Most importantly, the PV grammar uses the NooJ functionality $THIS=$V$Part, which assures that a 

particular particle must be associated with a specific verb in the PV dictionary in order for it to be 

recognized as a PV.  That is, NooJ only recognizes verb-particle combinations listed in the PV dictionary, 

not simply any verb that can be part of a PV followed by any particle.   

 

 
 

Figure 1: NooJ PV Dictionary Showing Highlighted Area of Lexicon Grammar in Table 1 

 

In addition to the PV grammar and dictionary that work together to identify PV in large corpora, we 

had to add other types of resources to remove noise.  These include three disambiguation grammars, 

which examine the immediately preceding and following environments of potential PV, and eliminate 

nouns that are mistaken for verbs (e.g., take a run down to Spain ≠ run down, his hands still in his 

pockets ≠ hand in), prepositions that are identified as PV (what a comfort I take in it ≠ take in), and 



21

prepositions that introduce locative expressions (asked you in Rome).  We have also written adverbial 

and adjectival expression filters and idiom dictionaries that identify certain fixed expressions as “unam-

biguous” and thus cannot be given the TAS of PV (e.g., asked in a low tone ≠ ask in, put on one’s guard 

≠ put on, take an interest in ≠ take in).  The underlined expressions in the examples represent fixed 

expressions, which consequently cannot be part of a candidate PV string.  The goal of these extra gram-

mars and dictionaries is to remove noise without creating silence.  More details on these resources are 

described in Machonis (2016).    

 

 
 

Figure 2: NooJ PV Grammar 

 
This PV Grammar is fairly accurate, and with the recent improvements made (see section 3), can now 

correctly identify many discontinuous PV involving two, three, or four word forms, such as the follow-

ing from our sample corpora – the 1881 Henry James novel The Portrait of a Lady (233,102 word forms) 

and an oral corpus consisting of 25 transcribed Larry King Live programs from January 2000 (228,950 

word forms): 

 
She had reasoned the matter well out, (Portrait of a Lady) 

Shall I show the gentleman up, ma’am? 

Mayor Ed Koch has a great new book out (Larry King Live) 

We now know that they tracked it all the way down and then back up 

That really turned the national economy around  

3 Improvements to Original Grammar 

To improve precision while avoiding noise, refinements were made to the original 2010 NooJ PV gram-

mar.  In this section, we present some of these enhancements.   

3.1 PV Grammar 

One of the first things we did was to limit the embedded NP node in the PV grammar (Figure 2).  While 

the original NP node (Figure 3) could accept a variety of noun phrases, the refined NP node (Figure 4) 

and DET node (Figure 5) within the present grammar restrict the type of NP allowed.  For example, the 

sentence he had found out was previously annotated as a PV2, i.e., had NP out, as in the example above, 

has a great new book out.  Now, since found does not have an article associated with the singular form, 

the verb in the sentence he had found out is no longer annotated as a PV, while the phrase has a great 

new book out, where the singular NP is introduced with a determiner, still is.  The new NP node is also 

able to identify PV originally overlooked, such as the following from our oral corpus:  and I checked 

all this out.  Other PV noise removed by the new grammar includes the following from Portrait of a 

Lady:   

 

with Pansy’s little figure marching up the middle of 

the band of tapestry Pansy had left on the table.  

on the contrary, he had only let out sail.  

                                                      
2 Although found is generally the past tense or past participle of the verb find, it can also be the present tense of the verb 

found, an adjective (found materials), or a noun (they earn so much a week and found “food and lodging in addition to pay”).  

NooJ recognizes all of these possibilities in the TAS.   



22

The expression let out, however, is correctly identified as a PV in this last example.  While disambig-

uation grammars and idiom dictionaries are able to remove noise automatically in NooJ, avoiding im-

proper noun phrases is an important first step.  In fact, the original 2010 PV grammar used a punctuation 

node after the particle to identify all discontinuous PV, which severely limited the recall of discontinuous 

PV.  This new grammar without the punctuation node, however, had the disadvantage of identifying 

many prepositional phrases involving overlapping particles and prepositions as PV, which created a real 

difficulty for processing PV.  Consequently, we added a series of disambiguation grammars.

3.2 Disambiguation Grammars  

After a PV analysis, the TAS can be automatically modified by any of three PV disambiguation gram-

mars, described in more detail in Machonis (2016), which specify certain structures that are not to be 

assigned PV status.  The first grammar examines the environment to the right of a candidate PV string.  

This syntactically motivated grammar states that if the PV occurs with a pronoun object, the PV must 

be in the discontinuous format (e.g., figure it out, look him up, take them away). Thus if an object pro-

noun follows a supposed particle, it must be a preposition, as in the following:  what sort of pressure is 

put on them back in Cuba.  The first disambiguation grammar specifies that this instance of put on (e.g., 

put on my T-shirt) is not a PV.  The PV put on is very common is our oral corpus (e.g., put on nine 

pounds, put on my wedding dress, put on a prayer shawl, put my jeans on), yet shows enormous potential 

for overlapping with prepositional phrases.   

The second disambiguation grammar identifies verbs that are nouns by examining the environment 

to the left of a hypothetical PV.  In essence, if a determiner or adjective appears immediately before the 

hypothetical PV, then this second disambiguation grammar correctly assumes that it is a noun and re-

moves the PV status from the TAS.  This grammar successfully eliminates much noise derived from PV 

that overlap with nouns, such as break in, check out, cheer up, figure out, hand in, head up, play out, 

sort out, take up, time in. etc.   

Our third disambiguation grammar examines the environment to the right of a candidate PV string, 

but specifically focuses on prepositions introducing locative prepositional phrases that are clearly not 

part of a PV.  This third disambiguation grammar makes use of a supplemental Locative Dictionary, 

which contains some frequent locatives found in our corpora, such as church, library, sitting-room, as 

well as place names such as London, Paris, Rome.  These nouns are all marked as N+Loc and the PV 

status is automatically removed from the TAS by this grammar.  For example, the place names China 

and New Hampshire, recently added to the Locative Dictionary, assure that the following sentences are 

not considered PV:   

 

We will be doing it again in New Hampshire.  

The Democrats have a big dispute on China.   

 

Not all locative expressions have to be added to the dictionary, since some noise is already avoided 

by means of the new NP node in the PV grammar mentioned in 3.1 above.  For example, the following 

represent cases of noise recently removed from our transcribed Larry King Live corpus.  That is, the 

singular noun place does not have a determiner and the potential PV take something in is no longer 

recognized as a PV in these cases: 

 

that trial is going to take place in Albany 

process that’s about to take place in Florida,  

effort that will have to take place in the Pacific Ocean 

3.3 Avoiding Idiom / Phrasal Verb Overlap 

Although PV, as multiword expressions, are idioms in themselves, another problem we face in trying to 

accurately identify PV in large corpora is the overlap of certain idiomatic expressions with PV.  For 

example, idioms that contain prepositions, such as in, off, and on, can easily be mistaken for PV in our 

corpora: 

 

asked her in a low tone ≠  PV ask in 

put the girl on her guard   ≠  PV put on 

take an interest in her   ≠  PV take in 

 

Among the additional lexical resources incorporated into NooJ, we have an Adverbials Grammar 

which identifies expressions such as at one time, in a low tone, in her lap, on one’s mind, etc. as unam-

biguous adverbs (ADV+UNAMB).  Consequently, neither the noun/verb (time), nor the preposition (in, 

on) can be associated with a PV.   



24

Another grammar identifies a few idioms that also appear with certain support verbs such as have, 

put, and take, but can create noise when they are identified as PV (e.g., have NP on, put NP on, take NP 

off).  This Adjectivals Grammar labels certain expressions as unambiguous adjectives (A+UNAMB) and 

consequently eliminates PV noise from sentences such as: 

 

she had been much on her guard 

the airport has already put grief counselors on duty here 

was waiting to take him off his guard. 

 

We have also incorporated into our PV analysis a larger dictionary of simple Prep C1 idioms that do 

not have multiple modifiers, such as in a haze, in the clouds, off duty, on a collision course, out of the 

question, over the top, etc.  These are assigned the notation A+PrepC1+UNAMB, thus avoiding noise 

with potential PV using the particles in, off, on, out, over.  For example, the expression on pins and 

needles is no longer confused with the PV keep something on in the following sentence from Portrait of 

a Lady:  Your relations with him, while he was here, kept me on pins and needles.    

Finally, there are two dictionaries that work in tandem with grammars that target more complex idio-

matic expressions such as  keep an eye on, take an interest in, take great pleasure in, have an opinion 

on, put blame on, take part in, etc. where the frozen noun can take a variety of determiners and modifiers 

(Idiom1).  Another dictionary lists expressions such as turn one’s back on, turn one’s back against, etc. 

(Idiom2).  These two dictionaries work together with grammars that first identify these idioms.  For 

example, the Idiom1 Grammar in Figure 6 annotates the expression put the blame on as V+Idiom1, DET, 

N+Idiom, PREP+Idiom.  Then the Idiom Disambiguation Grammar (Figure 7) removes any potential 

PV from the TAS with the “this is not a PV” notation <!V+PV>, thus avoiding noise with the true PV 

put something on.   

 

 
 

Figure 6: Verbal Idiom1 Grammar 

 

 
 

Figure 7: Idiom Disambiguation Grammar 



25

As can be seen, most of the potential noise created by idiomatic expressions comes from the preposi-

tions in and on, especially when used with high frequency verbs such as keep, have, put, take, and turn.   

4 Results and Future Work 

In Table 2, we present an indication of improvements made to our overall PV analysis using the two 

sample texts – the 1881 novel The Portrait of a Lady (233,102 word forms) and the 2000 oral corpus of 

transcribed Larry King Live programs (228,950 word forms).  The year 2010 represents the output of 

our original grammar with punctuation node that overlooked many discontinuous PV.  The year 2016 

represents results when the punctuation node was removed from the PV Grammar and the three disam-

biguation grammars were added.  The 2018 results represent more recent modifications to the PV Gram-

mar, along with fine-tuning of the adverbial and adjectival expression filters and auxiliary dictionaries 

within NooJ. The first column represents the overall number of PV strings identified by NooJ.  If a PV 

was automatically removed by a disambiguation grammar or other filter, it was not counted.  Of the 

potential PV strings identified, the next two columns represent correct continuous and discontinuous PV 

manually verified.  The next two columns represent noise, either prepositions that were incorrectly an-

notated as particles and part of a PV, or other PV misidentifications due to nouns mistaken for verbs 

(e.g., I should spend the evening out), verbs for nouns (to make her reach out a hand), etc.  The last 

column represents precision:  True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).   

As can be seen, the number of PV automatically identified by NooJ has grown since we first started 

this long-term project, mainly because many discontinuous PV were not annotated due to the punctua-

tion node requirement of the initial grammar.  If this change also created much noise (false positives, 

incorrect PV) in our 2016 analysis, with recent changes to the PV Grammar, the addition of idiom dic-

tionaries, and the tweaking of disambiguating grammars and other linguistics resources, precision has 

greatly improved, especially with our literature sample.  Precision is still a major problem with our oral 

corpus, however, chiefly due to the noise created by the prepositions in and on.  In fact, precision can be 

greatly improved by removing all PV with the particles in and on from the NooJ dictionary. While this 

does not accomplish the main NLP goal of annotating every PV in a large corpus, our resource could 

serve as a springboard for a purely linguistic endeavor, such as analyzing the evolution of PV throughout 

the history of the English language.

particular the 19th century – has received.” “Most of the 19th century is not covered at all,” he states.  A 

work in progress actually involves reducing the NooJ dictionary to include only six particles (out, up,

down, away, back, off) instead of twelve, which has helped us achieve 98% precision in an analysis of 

The Portrait of a Lady.  In order to get a better idea of the evolution of PV in Late Modern English, we 

plan to use the NooJ PV Grammar, with a limited PV Dictionary, to analyze numerous 19th century texts 

from a variety of authors, both American (Herman Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Ir-

ving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Edith Wharton) and British (Charles 

Dickens, Jane Austen, Walter Scott, the Bronte sisters, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Oscar Wilde).    

Previously, Hiltunen (1994:135) examined English texts limiting his searches to these six typical par-

ticles representing three levels of PV frequency:  high (out, up), mid (down, away), and low (back, off).  

By doing the same, we could get an accurate snapshot of PV usage, although limited to these six parti-

cles, in numerous 19th century novels with improved precision.  In fact, our dictionary and grammar 

could become very useful instruments to automatically measure PV usage in different genres – novels, 

plays, nonfiction, technical material, daily life texts (e.g., news articles, blogs), etc. – and at different 

periods in the history of the English language.   

In conclusion, the NooJ PV dictionary and grammar are great resources for identifying this most 

difficult, characteristic feature of the English language.  While PV are indeed a “pain in the neck for 

NLP,” what we have described is a reliable first step in accurately identifying them in large corpora, 

while automatically removing as much noise as possible.  As we have seen in this paper, incorporating 

other idioms in an NLP analysis greatly helps to alleviate this noise.  And although certain prepositions 

still create a fair amount of noise, many of these problems can eventually be resolved when we are able 

to build a NooJ grammar to recognize entire English sentences, another future goal.
