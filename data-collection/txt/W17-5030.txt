Abstract

Eye tracking studies from the past few
decades have shaped the way we think
of word complexity and cognitive load:
words that are long, rare and ambiguous
are more difficult to read. However, online
processing techniques have been scarcely
applied to investigating the reading dif-
ficulties of people with autism and what
vocabulary is challenging for them. We
present parallel gaze data obtained from
adult readers with autism and a control
group of neurotypical readers and show
that the former required higher cognitive
effort to comprehend the texts as evi-
denced by three gaze-based measures. We
divide all words into four classes based on
their viewing times for both groups and in-
vestigate the relationship between longer
viewing times and word length, word fre-
quency, and four cognitively-based mea-
sures (word concreteness, familiarity, age
of acquisition and imagability).

1 Introduction

Online methodologies such as eye tracking and
event-related potentials have been extensively
used to investigate word processing among neu-
rotypical readers (Rayner et al., 2012; Dehaene
and Cohen, 2011). The idea that the duration of
gaze fixations and revisits (go-back fixations to a
previously fixated object) could be used as a proxy
for measuring cognitive load dates back to the
strong eye-mind hypothesis by Just and Carpenter
(1980), according to which, “there is no apprecia-
ble lag between what is fixated and what is pro-
cessed” (Just and Carpenter, 1980). That is, when
a subject looks at something, he/she also processes
it cognitively and the amount of time the subject

spends on processing the particular object is equal
to the amount of time his/her gaze stays fixated on
this object. According to this hypothesis, gaze du-
ration metrics allow measuring the cognitive load
imposed on the reader by certain words, clauses
and sentences (Just and Carpenter, 1980).

A series of studies investigating the effects of
word frequency, verb complexity and lexical am-
biguity (Juhasz and Rayner, 2003; Rayner et al.,
2012), as well as contextual effects on word per-
ception (Ehrlich and Rayner, 1981) concluded that
long, rare and ambiguous words are more likely
to be fixated longer and their processing requires
more cognitive effort from the reader. These are
also words that are likely to be replaced with
shorter and more frequent ones during lexical sim-
plification aimed at making text more accessible
to wider populations (Bott et al., 2012; Glavaš and
Štajner, 2015).

Eye tracking has also been extensively used for
the investigation of reading-related disorders ow-
ing to its capacity to provide information about
the online processing of the text. For example,
aphasic readers show “qualitatively different gaze
fixation patterns” when answering comprehension
questions (Dickey et al., 2007) and readers with
dyslexia have been found to exhibit longer fixation
durations and less efficient scanning techniques
(Kim and Lombardino, 2016).

In spite of the decades-long tradition of using
gaze data to investigate word processing among
neurotypical readers and readers with reading-
related disorders, this methodology has been
scarcely used to investigate reading among people
with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). People
with ASD have been shown to experience compre-
hension difficulties at lexical, syntactic and prag-
matic level (Frith and Snowling, 1983; Happe,
1997; O‘Connor and Klein, 2004; Happé and
Frith, 2006; Whyte et al., 2014) and thus studies

employing online processing techniques have the
potential to cast light on the particular linguistic
constructions which people with autism find chal-
lenging.

1.1 Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurode-
velopmental disorder characterised by impairment
in communication and social interaction (Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association, 2013). A majority of
children on the spectrum experience language de-
lay, which results in reading comprehension dif-
ficulties later on in their lives, such as resolving
ambiguity in meaning (Frith and Snowling, 1983;
Happé and Frith, 2006), syntax processing of long
sentences (Whyte et al., 2014) and identifying pro-
noun referents (O‘Connor and Klein, 2004).

Unlike people with other developmental con-
ditions such as dyslexia, autistic readers are not
considered to have deficits in word decoding, suc-
cessfully applying both lexical (look-and-say) and
phonological (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion)
strategies for reading words (Frith and Snowling,
1983; Smith Gabig, 2010). This implies that in the
case of readers with autism, decoding difficulties
are unlikely to be the reason for longer fixation
times. However, while decoding skills are consid-
ered intact, there is an evidence of semantic deficit
in ASD (Henderson et al., 2011; Löfkvist et al.,
2014), and more specifically in word comprehen-
sion rather than word production (Charman et al.,
2003; Luyster et al., 2008). This suggests that a
difficulty with accessing and integrating the se-
mantic representation of words could pose higher
cognitive load on readers with autism.

This hypothesis is supported through an online
measurement of word processing using gaze data.
Sansosti et al. (2013) provide evidence for sig-
nificant differences between the total fixation du-
rations, number of fixations and number of re-
gressions between autistic and non-autistic ado-
lescents while reading individual sentences, sug-
gesting that the reading task imposed an overall
heavier cognitive load on the participants from the
ASD group.

Brock et al. (2008) also used gaze data1 and
showed that both the ASD and the control partici-
pants were able to use context to successfully dis-

data produced during a reading task. Instead, the participants
were asked to look at an image on the screen which was either
relevant or irrelevant to the target word they were hearing.

ambiguate the ambiguous target words. The stud-
ies by Sansosti et al. (2013) and Brock et al. (2008)
are, to the best of our knowledge, the only two ex-
isting studies investigating reading among people
with autism using gaze data; we advance this by i)
using a larger dataset from a natural reading task
as opposed to individual sentences, ii) identifying
which words impose heavier cognitive load on the
participants and what their lexical properties are.

1.2 Complex Word Identification

Complex Word Identification (CWI) task received
high attention only recently, with findings suggest-
ing that using a CWI module at the beginning of
a lexical simplification (LS) pipeline significantly
improves performances of LS systems (Paetzold
and Specia, 2016c) and with the recently organ-
ised SemEval-2016 CWI shared task.2 The goal of
the shared task was building CWI systems which
would identify challenging words for non-native
English speakers. The dataset consisted of sen-
tences (without context), each with one content
word (noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) marked as
a target word. The training dataset contained 200
sentences, where each target word was annotated
by 20 non-native English speakers as ‘easy’ or
‘complex’, depending on whether they understood
its meaning or not. The participants were asked
to mark the word as ‘complex’ even if they un-
derstood the meaning of the sentence as a whole,
as long as they did not understand the word itself.
The test set consisted of 9,000 sentences, this time
each sentence annotated only by one non-native
speaker (300 different annotators in total). The
main goal of the task was to predict potentially
complex words for a non-native English speaker
based on the annotations collected from 20 non-
native speakers. The analysis of the crowdsourced
annotations revealed that ‘complex’ words are on
average shorter, less ambiguous, and less frequent
in Simple English Wikipedia3. The results of the
shared task (Paetzold and Specia, 2016b) showed
that the use of features focused only on isolated
words and not their context lead to best performing
CWI systems. Among many investigated lexical
and syntactic features, some of them taking into
account the context of the target word and some
not, the word frequency of the target word in Sim-
ple English Wikipedia was identified as the best

feature (Wróbel, 2016).
In an earlier organised shared task on English

Lexical Substitution at SemEval-2012,4 which had
the aim of providing a framework for evaluation of
lexical simplification systems, for each given sen-
tence containing one target ‘complex’ word and
four substitution candidates, participating systems
were competing in ranking the four given substi-
tution candidates according to their simplicity, i.e.
how easy they are to be understood by fluent but
non-native English speakers. The best perform-
ing system (Jauhar and Specia, 2012) used a com-
bination of collocational features and four psy-
cholinguistic measures extracted from the MRC
(Machine Readable Dictionary) Psycholinguistic
Database (Coltheart, 1981):

• Concreteness – the level of abstraction asso-
ciated with the concept a word describes.

• Imageability – the ability of a given word to
arouse mental images.

• Familiarity – the frequency of exposure to a
word.

• Age of Acquisition – the age at which a given
word is appropriated by a speaker.

1.3 Study Aims and Contributions
We advance previous approaches to CWI by fo-
cusing on a new, less-studied population of target
readers with autism, and by using a more sophisti-
cated approach based on eye tracking data.

In this study, we use parallel gaze data to study
the differences in word processing between par-
ticipants with autism and a control group of neu-
rotypical (non-autistic) participants in a natural
reading task. Our aim is to find out which words
could potentially be considered challenging for
both groups of readers for the purposes of au-
tomatic text simplification (ATS) and to explore
which lexical properties underpin the differences
in word processing. The contributions of this
study are as follows.

We first show that in spite of the fact that both
groups achieved similar level of reading compre-
hension, the reading task imposed significantly
heavier cognitive load on the participants with
autism as measured by three different gaze mea-
sures (Section 3). This finding is consistent with
the results of Sansosti et al. (2013) (Section 1.1).

4https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-
2012/task1/index.html

Next, we identify which particular words (in
their specific contexts) impose heavier cognitive
load on each group of participants by clustering
them as challenging or not, based on viewing time
of each participant individually (Section 4.1), and
then classifying them into four classes depending
on the number of participants who found them
challenging (Section 4.2).

Finally, we investigate the lexical properties
which underpin the different processing times for
the different word classes in two groups of par-
ticipants, using both statistical (word frequency
and length) and cognitively-based (familiarity, age
of acquisition, concreteness, and imagability) fea-
tures. To account for the context in which the
words appear, we treat the same word in different
contexts as different entries in our clustering and
classification tasks, i.e. we are actually clustering
and classifying the Areas of Interest (AOIs) and
not the words (Section 4.3).

Identifying such lexical properties has both the-
oretical and practical implications. On one hand,
understanding into what makes a word challeng-
ing for a reader with autism could inform fu-
ture writing guidelines for easy-to-read content
and the design of exams and test items for stu-
dents with autism (Elliott et al., 2010). On the
other hand, as shown is Section 1.2, the identifi-
cation of challenging words based on their lexi-
cal properties is on a high demand in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the pur-
pose of automated text simplification for people
with autism and other disorders (Martos et al.,
2013; Siddharthan, 2014) as well as for non-native
speakers.

2 Data Collection

An experimental group of participants with a diag-
nosis of autism and a control group of non-autistic
participants were asked to read 20 texts while their
eye movements were recorded by an eye tracker.
In order to explore between-group differences in
reading patterns, the groups were matched based
on their reading comprehension, as follows. It
was important to ensure that i) all participants had
understood the presented texts at a similar level
and ii) that they read for meaning as opposed to
simply skimming through the text, which is why
they were asked to answer three multiple-choice
(MCQ) questions per passage with three possible
answers each. The questions assessed both literal

and inferential reading comprehension and were
developed following the taxonomy and guidelines
of Day and Park 2005. Gaze data from both groups
were collected for 3,636 words.

Materials: A total of 20 text passages with
varying complexity were obtained from the Web5.
The registers were miscellaneous, covering ed-
ucational (7 documents), news (10 documents)
and general informational articles (3 documents).
Each text passage was self-contained and coher-
ent (did not refer to information given in the rest
of the article and could be comprehended inde-
pendently of it), did not require specific cultural
background to be comprehended and did not con-
tain highly specialised terms, unless they were ex-
plained within the text. The average number of
words per text was 156 with a standard devia-
tion of 49.94 (min = 74 words and max = 242
words). The texts covered a range of readabil-
ity levels, with an average Flesch Reading Ease
score6 (Flesch, 1948) of 65.07 and a standard de-
viation (SD) of 13.71 (min = 40.66, max = 95).

Participants: All participants were native
speakers of English, had no diagnosed conditions
affecting reading (other than autism in the ASD
group) and no diagnosed developmental delay.
The participants from the two groups had similar
age and similar number of years spent in formal
education (Table 1). All participants had normal
or corrected vision.

The participants with autism had a confirmed
clinical diagnosis obtained in the UK after a refer-
ral from a general practitioner and based on the the
ADOS diagnostic criteria (Gotham et al., 2007).
Out of a total of 27 participants in the ASD group,
11 had a diagnosis of ASD and 15 had a diagnosis

of Asperger’s syndrome (obtained before the in-
troduction of DSM-5 in 2013). Some participants
were diagnosed also with depression (four in ASD
group; one in control group) and anxiety (six in
ASD group).

The gaze recordings were obtained in three cy-
cles of data collection and the 20 text passages
were initially read by a total of 27 different peo-
ple with a formal diagnosis of autism (texts 1-9
by 20 people, texts 10-17 by 18 people and texts
18-20 by 18 people) and by 31 different neurotyp-
ical participants (texts 1-9 by 20 people, texts 10-
17 by 18 people and texts 18-20 by 14 people).
Participants who performed poorly on comprehen-
sion testing, had missing or inaccurate gaze data
or were unable to calibrate the eye tracker, were
subsequently excluded from the study. The final
number of participants whose data was retained
and analysed were 21 participants with autism and
19 participants without autism.

Apparatus and Procedure: Texts were pre-
sented on a 19 LCD monitor. The device used for
recording the gaze of the participants was a Gaze-
point GP3 video-based eye tracker7 (60Hz sam-
pling rate and accuracy of 0.5 - 1 degree of visual
angle). The eye tracker was calibrated individu-
ally for each participant using a 9-point calibration
procedure. The distance between each participant
and the eye tracker was controlled by a sensor in-
tegrated within the Gazepoint software, and was
approximately 65 cm. The software randomised
both the order of presentation of the texts and the
questions pertaining to texts for each participant,
to avoid bias. Participants were instructed about
the purpose and the procedure of the experiment,
signed a consent form and then read all texts and
answered all questions, taking breaks if needed.
At the end of the experiment, demographic data
was collected and participants were debriefed.

was defined as an Area of Interest (AOI) using the
in-built Gazepoint analysis software. The output
contains three gaze based measures for a total of
3,636 words for each participant separately: Time
Viewed (TV) (the time an AOI was viewed, mea-
sured in seconds), Fixations (F) (the number of
gaze fixations in a given AOI) and Revisits (R) (the
number of go-back fixations in a given AOI, after
the eyes have left the AOI and have moved to the
right). Cognitive load is usually studied through
the temporal aspects of the gaze data. In this pa-
per, we identify challenging words by using the
late measure of time viewed per word as opposed
to early processing measures such as first fixation
duration. This is done in order to account for the
overall cognitive load rather than the individual
stages of visual word recognition.

3 Between-group Differences in
Comprehension and Cognitive Effort

In this section we compare the level of compre-
hension of the two groups, as well as the dura-
tion and number of their fixations and revisits for
each word for each participant. A chi-square test
for independence revealed that there was no sta-
tistically significant association between the group
type (ASD vs. Control) and the level of compre-
hension (χ2(1) = 3.442; p = 0.064). Never-
theless, while both groups achieved similar levels
of text comprehension, it took significantly more
cognitive effort for the ASD participants to com-
prehend the text, as shown by all three gaze-based
measures (Table 2).8 This means that identifica-
tion and simplification of words which pose higher
cognitive load on readers with autism could poten-
tially reduce the time and effort required for read-
ing a text, completing an exam, etc.

In order to gain some preliminary insights into
the between-group differences we examined the
box-plots with outliers and extreme values for TV
for each of the 20 texts. We observed that the par-
ticipants with ASD were more heterogeneous than
the control group participants in the words that
they viewed extremely long. In contrast, within

8Differences in means between the fixations of the two
groups of participants for each word were found statistically
significant on all three gaze measures using the two-tailed
t-test for equality of means in independent samples, where
equal variances are not assumed (for TV: t = 19.842, df=
61652.575, p = 0.000 with 95% CI (0.035, 0.042); for F:
t = 20.781, df= 64963.384, p = 0.000 with 95% CI (0.229,
0.277); and for R: t = 22.666, df= 63955.256, p = 0.000 with
95% CI (0.263, 0.313)).

Table 2: Eye-tracking data statistics

the control group, the words with extreme TV val-
ues were similar for most participants, suggest-
ing that the existing differences between the two
groups were not merely based on individual dif-
ferences between the participants.

To better understand the reasons behind certain
words been viewed so long and differences be-
tween the two groups of participants, we took a
systematic approach. We classified all words into
four classes using the procedure explained in the
next section and then explored the lexical proper-
ties of each word class and for each group of par-
ticipants separately.

4 Between-group Differences in Words
Found Challenging

Motivated by the need of automatically recognis-
ing potentially challenging words (i.e. CWI task)
which should then be replaced by their simpler
synonyms in the task of automated text simplifi-
cation, and the need for ranking substitution can-
didates according to their simplicity for intended
reader (Section 1.2), we wanted to classify all
AOIs into different classes according to their po-
tential challenge to the intended reader. Taking
into account that different readers might find dif-
ferent words challenging, instead of just classify-
ing words into challenging or not, we wanted to
have more fine-grained classes depending on how
many readers found them challenging. Therefore,
we had a two-step procedure:

1. We divided the words into challenging and
not challenging, according to the TV feature,
for each reader separately.

2. We divided the words into four classes, de-
pending on how many readers found them
challenging.

4.1 Challenging vs. Not Challenging
The division of words into challenging and not
challenging according to the time viewed could be
done in different ways, e.g. by finding a cut-off

275



Group Mean SD Var. Min. Max.

Table 3: Percentage of words clustered as chal-
lenging (per participant-session combination)

point based on the feature distribution and stan-
dard deviation, or by using a parameter-free clus-
tering approach. As there have been no previ-
ous studies trying to divide words into those two
groups according to the time viewed, and thus no
evidence on which approach is better, we opted for
the second approach which is parameter-free.

We thus clustered the words from 20 texts into
two clusters (challenging vs. not challenging) for
each participant-session combination separately
by applying the K-Means algorithm in SPSS, tak-
ing only into consideration the TV feature. We
applied the iterative KMeans algorithm with two
clusters (until convergence, i.e. no change in clus-
ter centers). In a few cases, where there was an ex-
treme outlier (extremely long gazed word) in the
given participant-session combination, the clus-
tering resulted in two clusters where one cluster
contained only the outlier and the other all other
words. In such cases, we applied the K-Means
with three clusters, which resulted in having one
cluster with not challenging words, another with
challenging words, and the third one with the out-
lier. We then added the outlier to the cluster of
challenging words and retained the two resulting
clusters.

The average percentage of challenging AOIs
(out of all words read) was lower, on average,
within the ASD group than within the Control
group (Table 3).9 Although this might seem
contradictory to the overall higher cognitive load
(viewing time) in the ASD group, it is actually a
result of the significantly stronger skewness of the
TV in the ASD group (Table 2); the participants in
the ASD group find fewer AOIs challenging, but
they focus on them longer.

4.2 Word Classes
In the second step, for each AOI-id and for each
group of participants separately, we assigned one

9The between-group differences in percentage of words
found challenging were statistically significant using the two-
tailed t-test for equality of means in independent samples,
where equal variances are not assumed (t = −2.084; df =
45.252; p = 0.043 with 95% CI (−4.184,−0.072)).

Table 4: Distribution of classes

of the following four classes:

• EXTREMELY CHALLENGING (E-CH) if
that AOI-id was clustered as challenging for
all participants;

• CHALLENGING (CH) if that AOI-id was
clustered as challenging for at least half of the
participants (in the case of the texts read by
an odd number of participants, the half was
the mean value rounded to the lower integer)
but not for all;

• POTENTIALLY CHALLENGING (P-CH) if
that AOI-id was clustered as challenging for
at least two participants, but less than a half
of the participants;

• NOT CHALLENGING (NOT) if none of above
(i.e. that AOI-id was clustered as challenging
for one participant at the most).

The number of AOIs found in each class for
each group of participants is presented in Table 4.
The distribution of AOIs among classes was simi-
lar for both groups of participants, while the num-
bers supported our hypothesis that the participants
in the ASD group are more heterogeneous in the
AOIs they find challenging (i.e. the AOIs they
viewed long), which results in a lower overlap of
challenging AOIs among the participants (i.e. the
lower number of POTENTIALLY CHALLENGING
(P-CH) and CHALLENGING (CH) AOIs than in the
Control group).

Extremely challenging words (E-CH) for the
Control group were: conservative, Academicians,
and iconoclasm, whereas for the ASD group it was
only the word acquaitance.

4.3 Importance of Context
In order to account for the influence that the con-
text can have on certain word requiring greater
cognitive effort, we were classifying AOIs, allow-
ing thus for the same word (but different AOI) to
be classified in different classes.

Among the total of 3398 AOIs, 1495 were
unique words. Out of those 1495, 1048 appeared
only once in the whole corpus (20 texts), 224 ap-
peared twice, 187 appeared between three and ten
times, while 36 words appeared more than ten
times (stop words only).

For each of the two groups of participants, we
closely examined all words that appeared more

in different contexts) were classified in different

CHALLENGING and CHALLENGING).

In the case of non-autistic readers, out of 347
words which appeared more than once in the pre-
sented texts, 175 were placed always in the same
level of difficulty (irrespective of their context), 18
of them (which repeated at least three times) were
placed in three different classes (three neighbour-
ing classes – NOT CHALLENGING, POTENTIALLY
CHALLENGING, and CHALLENGING), whereas
six words (comes, won, Foxes, provides, artists,
computer) were placed in two non-neighbouring
difficulty levels (NOT CHALLENGING and CHAL-
LENGING).

Two examples of the same words (but differ-
ent AOIs) classified into two non-neighbouring
classes are presented in Table 5 together with con-
texts.

4.4 Analysis of Word Classes

The mean value with the standard deviation of the
cognitively-based features (age of acquisition, fa-
miliarity, imagability, and concreteness) in each
word class are presented in Tables 6 and 7.

Given that the manually created MRC psy-
cholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981) covered
only 4.76% of words in our texts, we used the
bootstrapped larger version of it (Paetzold and
Specia, 2016a) which covered 95% of the words.10

While the cognitively-based features (age of
aquisition, familiarity, imagability and concrete-
ness) were obtained from non-ASD college stu-
dents, we argue that these properties transfer be-
tween subject groups. The reason for this is that
our participants were all high-functioning (none
of them attended a specialised school) and thus
they have all been exposed to a similar vocabu-
lary by going through the national curricula. In
addition, both groups understood the texts equally
well and we did not observe large between-group
differences in the correlation of these metrics with
the gaze data.

No significant differences between the values
obtained for the same word classes between the
two groups of participants were observed. How-
ever, it is interesting to note that the extremely

database (Paetzold and Specia, 2016a) were excluded from
the analysis.

Table 8: Length and frequency of words in different classes (mean ± standard deviation)

challenging words (E-CH) for the Control group
had lower imagability and concreteness than the
words classified as less challenging (Table 7).
Moreover, the imagability and concreteness val-
ues seem to have the opposite correlations with
the “challenging” classifications; i.e. the average
imagability and concreteness values increase from
the NOT to the CH groups. These results imply
that the imagability and concreteness may not be
well correlated with the cognitive load measured
as TV.

The mean value with the standard deviation of
the statistically-based measures (length in charac-
ters and frequency in Simple Wikipedia) in each
word class are presented in Table 8. It is inter-
esting to note that the relative word frequencies
in Simple Wikipedia had extremely high standard
deviations (Table 8), thus implicating that this fea-
ture is not the main characteristic of whether the
word is challenging or not.

4.5 Correlation of TV and Word Classes with
Lexical Complexity Features

Finally, for each group of participants separately,
we tested how the time viewed (taking each
participant-AOI combination as a separate data
point) and word classes are correlated (using the
Spearman’s rho coefficient) with both statistical
and cognitively-based lexical properties of the
words (Table 9).

As can be observed, all investigated lexical
properties are better correlated with the word
classes than with the raw viewing times (TV). This

Table 9: Correlation (Spearman’s rho) of TV and
word classes with lexical complexity features (all
statistically significant at a 0.001 level of signifi-
cance)

is probably due to the fact that word classes elim-
inate the influences of individual differences in
reading speed among the participants, which di-
lute the correlations with the TV.

5 Discussion

We collected parallel gaze data to study the dif-
ferences in word processing between participants
with autism and a control group of neurotypical
participants in a natural reading task.

The presented results indicated that even though
both groups understood the texts at a similar level,
participants with autism had significantly longer
viewing times, more fixations and more revisits
per word, indicative of heavier cognitive load.
Even when individuals on the spectrum appear
highly able and achieve comprehension similar to
their peers, they put more cognitive effort into do-

278



ing so. Another possible explanation of this re-
sult could be that the pattern of results observed
in the ASD readers reflects a different, perhaps
more cautious reading strategy rather than reflect-
ing greater cognitive load associated with lexical
processing. In other words, it is possible that given
the same instructions, readers with ASD are more
careful than control participants to ensure that they
have read the text thoroughly and understood the
sentences completely. Under this alternative, its
not that ASD readers are spending more time and
making more fixations because reading is chal-
lenging, but instead because they are simply read-
ing more cautiously. Whichever one of these in-
terpretations of the result is valid, this finding pro-
vides experimental evidence for the need to allow
extra time for exams and for rewriting texts in a
way that reduces cognitive load. Both of these ac-
commodations are important steps towards the in-
clusion of students with ASD.

Although the readers with ASD had signifi-
cantly longer viewing times, they did not fixate
long on as many words as the control participants
did. Their overall longer viewing times were heav-
ily skewed towards the words they find challeng-
ing. This result reveals differences in the reading
patterns between the two groups.

Finally, other than word length which is natu-
rally highly correlated with viewing time, the age
of acquisition (AoA) seems to be an important fac-
tor related to the viewing times of both groups,
followed by frequency and familiarity. This re-
sult is consistent with Juhasz and Rayner (2003),
who also reported that the effect age of acquisition
had on fixation duration was above and beyond the
effect of word frequency. Furthermore, the large
standard deviation in the word frequency implies
that this measure is not suitable for choosing alter-
native words for lexical substitution in text simpli-
fication. Based on our data, an improved strategy
for lexical simplification would be basing the word
substitutes on the age of acquisition or familiarity
ratings. Concreteness and imagability were only
weakly related to viewing time. There were no
between-group differences observed with regards
to the importance of lexical features.

Another important conclusion of this study is
that the absolute measures such as concreteness
and imagability, which were obtained based on
rating of individual words, might not be suitable
for complex word identification task, as the gaze

data showed that the same word presented in dif-
ferent contexts could be identified as both chal-
lenging or not.

One limitation of this study is the fact that it
explores only the lexical effects on viewing times
and does not explore the effect of contextual fea-
tures. While we acknowledge the high importance
of context for the duration of gaze fixations, the fo-
cus on the lexical component in the present study
allows for future comparisons between lexical and
context-based effects on viewing times. Another
limitation is the low speed of the eye tracker used
for data collection, which reduces the precision of
the recordings and does not allow for comparison
of early and late gaze features. However, the data
used in this study is the only existing resource of
its kind to date and it would be interesting to com-
pare the results obtained from this study with fu-
ture results based on more sophisticated sets of
text and gaze features.

6 Conclusion

This paper presented a study investigating which
words are found challenging by readers with high-
functioning autism and a control group of non-
autistic readers based on gaze data from a nat-
ural reading task. We fist showed that even
though there were no differences between the
level of comprehension of the texts between the
two groups, the analysis of the gaze data showed
that the readers with autism produced significantly
more fixations and revisits, as well as longer view-
ing times per word. We then clustered the view-
ing times for each participant-session combination
and classified the words into four classes of dif-
ficulty based on the gaze data. Finally, we in-
vestigated the relationship between those classes
and cognitively-based features commonly used in
text simplification such as age of acquisition, fa-
miliarity, imagability, concreteness, and word fre-
quency and length. Our results showed that re-
lying on such absolute measures for the complex
word identification task is not always justified be-
cause a given word could be perceived as challeng-
ing or not based on the surrounding context.
