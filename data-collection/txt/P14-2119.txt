Abstract

Distant supervision usually utilizes only
unlabeled data and existing knowledge
bases to learn relation extraction models.
However, in some cases a small amount
of human labeled data is available. In this
paper, we demonstrate how a state-of-the-
art multi-instance multi-label model can
be modified to make use of these reli-
able sentence-level labels in addition to
the relation-level distant supervision from
a database. Experiments show that our ap-
proach achieves a statistically significant
increase of 13.5% in F-score and 37% in
area under the precision recall curve.

1 Introduction
Relation extraction is the task of tagging semantic
relations between pairs of entities from free text.
Recently, distant supervision has emerged as an
important technique for relation extraction and has
attracted increasing attention because of its effec-
tive use of readily available databases (Mintz et
al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Snyder and
Barzilay, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007). It automat-
ically labels its own training data by heuristically
aligning a knowledge base of facts with an unla-
beled corpus. The intuition is that any sentence
which mentions a pair of entities (e1 and e2) that
participate in a relation, r, is likely to express the
fact r(e1,e2) and thus forms a positive training ex-
ample of r.

One of most crucial problems in distant super-
vision is the inherent errors in the automatically
generated training data (Roth et al., 2013). Ta-
ble 1 illustrates this problem with a toy exam-
ple. Sophisticated multi-instance learning algo-
rithms (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011;

∗ Most of the work was done when this author was at
New York University

Surdeanu et al., 2012) have been proposed to ad-
dress the issue by loosening the distant supervision
assumption. These approaches consider all men-
tions of the same pair (e1,e2) and assume that at-
least-one mention actually expresses the relation.
On top of that, researchers further improved per-
formance by explicitly adding preprocessing steps
(Takamatsu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013) or addi-
tional layers inside the model (Ritter et al., 2013;
Min et al., 2013) to reduce the effect of training
noise.

ated by a toy knowledge base of only one entry

However, the potential of these previously pro-
posed approaches is limited by the inevitable
gap between the relation-level knowledge and the
instance-level extraction task. In this paper, we
present the first effective approach, Guided DS
(distant supervision), to incorporate labeled data
into distant supervision for extracting relations
from sentences. In contrast to simply taking the
union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus la-
beled by distant supervision as in the previous
work by Zhang et al. (2012), we generalize the
labeled data through feature selection and model
this additional information directly in the latent
variable approaches. Aside from previous semi-
supervised work that employs labeled and unla-
beled data (Yarowsky, 2013; Blum and Mitchell,
1998; Collins and Singer, 2011; Nigam, 2001, and
others), this is a learning scheme that combines
unlabeled text and two training sources whose
quantity and quality are radically different (Liang
et al., 2009).

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-

posed approach, we extend MIML (Surdeanu et
al., 2012), a state-of-the-art distant supervision
model and show a significant improvement of
13.5% in F-score on the relation extraction bench-
mark TAC-KBP (Ji and Grishman, 2011) dataset.
While prior work employed tens of thousands of
human labeled examples (Zhang et al., 2012) and
only got a 6.5% increase in F-score over a logistic
regression baseline, our approach uses much less
labeled data (about 1/8) but achieves much higher
improvement on performance over stronger base-
lines.

2 The Challenge

Simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data
and the corpus labeled by distant supervision is not
effective since hand-labeled data will be swamped
by a larger amount of distantly labeled data. An
effective approach must recognize that the hand-
labeled data is more reliable than the automatically
labeled data and so must take precedence in cases
of conflict. Conflicts cannot be limited to those
cases where all the features in two examples are
the same; this would almost never occur, because
of the dozens of features used by a typical relation
extractor (Zhou et al., 2005). Instead we propose
to perform feature selection to generalize human
labeled data into training guidelines, and integrate
them into latent variable model.

2.1 Guidelines

The sparse nature of feature space dilutes the dis-
criminative capability of useful features. Given
the small amount of hand-labeled data, it is im-
portant to identify a small set of features that are
general enough while being capable of predicting
quite accurately the type of relation that may hold
between two entities.

We experimentally tested alternative feature
sets by building supervised Maximum Entropy
(MaxEnt) models using the hand-labeled data (Ta-
ble 3), and selected an effective combination of
three features from the full feature set used by Sur-
deanu et al., (2011):

• the semantic types of the two arguments (e.g.
person, organization, location, date, title, ...)
• the sequence of dependency relations along the

path connecting the heads of the two arguments
in the dependency tree.
• a word in the sentence between the two argu-

ments

These three features are strong indicators of the
type of relation between two entities. In some
cases the semantic types of the arguments alone
narrows the possibilities to one or two relation
types. For example, entity types such as person
and title often implies the relation personTitle.
Some lexical items are clear indicators of partic-
ular relations, such as “brother” and “sister” for a
sibling relationship

We extract guidelines from hand-labeled data.
Each guideline g={gi|i=1,2,3} consists of a pair
of semantic types, a dependency path, and option-
ally a span word and is associated with a partic-
ular relation r(g). We keep only those guidelines

al., 2011) vs using a subset of two (types of en-

which make the correct prediction for all and at
least k=3 examples in the training corpus (thresh-
old 3 was obtained by running experiments on the
development dataset). Table 2 shows some exam-
ples in the final set G of extracted guidelines.

3 Guided DS
Our goal is to jointly model human-labeled ground
truth and structured data from a knowledge base
in distant supervision. To do this, we extend the
MIML model (Surdeanu et al., 2012) by adding a
new layer as shown in Figure 1.

The input to the model consists of (1) distantly
supervised data, represented as a list of n bags1

with a vector yi of binary gold-standard labels, ei-
ther Positive(P ) or Negative(N) for each rela-
tion r∈R; (2) generalized human-labeled ground
truth, represented as a set G of feature conjunc-
tions g={gi|i=1,2,3} associated with a unique re-
lation r(g). Given a bag of sentences, xi, which
mention an ith entity pair (e1, e2), our goal is to
correctly predict which relation is mentioned in
each sentence, or NR if none of the relations under
consideration are mentioned. The vector zi con-
tains the latent mention-level classifications for the
ith entity pair. We introduce a set of latent vari-
ables hi which model human ground truth for each
mention in the ith bag and take precedence over
the current model assignment zi.

Figure 1: Plate diagram of Guided DS

Let i, j be the index in the bag and the men-
tion level, respectively. We model mention-
level extraction p(zij |xij ;wz), human relabel-
ing hij(xij , zij) and multi-label aggregation
p(yri |hi;wy). We define:
• yri ∈{P,N} : r holds for the ith bag or not.
• xij is the feature representation of the jth rela-

tion mention in the ith bag. We use the same set
of features as in Surdeanu et al. (2012).
1A bag is a set of mentions sharing same entity pair.

• zij∈R ∪ NR: a latent variable that denotes the
relation of the jth mention in the ith bag
• hij ∈R ∪NR: a latent variable that denotes the

refined relation of the mention xij

We define relabeled relations hij as following:

hij(xij , zij)=
{
r(g), if ∃!g∈G s.t.g={gk}⊆{xij}
zij , otherwise

Thus, relation r(g) is assigned to hij iff there
exists a unique guideline g ∈ G, such that the
feature vector xij contains all constituents of g,
i.e. entity types, a dependency path and maybe a
span word, if g has one. We use mention relation
zij inferred by the model only in case no such a
guideline exists or there is more than one match-
ing guideline. We also define:
• wz is the weight vector for the multi-class rela-

tion mention-level classifier2

• wry is the weight vector for the rth binary top-
level aggregation classifier (from mention labels
to bag-level prediction). We use wy to represent
w1y,w

Our approach is aimed at improving the mention-
level classifier, while keeping the multi-instance
multi-label framework to allow for joint modeling.

4 Training
We use a hard expectation maximization algorithm
to train the model. Our objective function is to
maximize log-likelihood of the data:

LL(wy,wz) =

where the last equality is due to conditional
independence. Because of the non-convexity
of LL(wy,wz) we approximate and maximize
the joint log-probability p(yi,hi|xi,wy,wz,G) for
each entity pair in the database:

log p(yi,hi|xi,wy,wz,G)

=
|hi|∑
j=1

log p(hij |xij ,wz,G)+
∑

gistic regression with Stanford CoreNLP package.

The pseudocode is presented as algorithm 1.

The following approximation is used for infer-
ence at step 6:

p(zij |xi,yi,wz,wy) ∝ p(yi, zij |xi,wy,wz)
≈ p(zij |xij ,wz)p(yi|h′i,wy)
= p(zij |xij ,wz)

p(yri |h′i,wry),

where h′i contains previously inferred and
maybe further relabeled mention labels for group
i (steps 5-10), with the exception of component j
whose label is replaced by zij . In the M-step (lines
12-15) we optimize model parameters wz,wy,
given the current assignment of mention-level la-
bels hi.

Experiments show that Guided DS efficiently
learns new model, resulting in a drastically de-
creasing number of needed relabelings for further
iterations (Table 4). At the inference step we first
classify all mentions:

z∗ij = argmaxz∈R∪NR p(z|xij ,wz)
Then final relation labels for ith entity tuple are

obtained via the top-level classifiers:
yr∗i = argmaxy∈{P,N} p(y|z∗i ,wry)

5 Experiments

5.1 Data

We use the KBP (Ji and Grishman, 2011) dataset3

which is preprocessed by Surdeanu et al. (2011)
using the Stanford parser4 (Klein and Manning,
2003). This dataset is generated by mapping
Wikipedia infoboxes into a large unlabeled corpus
that consists of 1.5M documents from KBP source
corpus and a complete snapshot of Wikipedia.

The KBP 2010 and 2011 data includes 200
query named entities with the relations they are
involved in. We used 40 queries as development
set and the rest 160 queries (3334 entity pairs that
express a relation) as the test set. The official KBP
evaluation is performed by pooling the system re-
sponses and manually reviewing each response,
producing a hand-checked assessment data. We
used KBP 2012 assessment data to generate guide-
lines since queries from different years do not
overlap. It contains about 2500 labeled sentences
of 41 relations, which is less than 0.09% of the
size of the distantly labeled dataset of 2M sen-
tences. The final set G consists of 99 guidelines
(section 2.1).

5.2 Models

We implement Guided DS on top of the MIML
(Surdeanu et al., 2012) code base5. Training
MIML on a simple fusion of distantly-labeled
and human-labeled datasets does not improve the
maximum F-score since this hand-labeled data is
swamped by a much larger amount of distant-
supervised data of much lower quality. Upsam-
pling the labeled data did not improve the perfor-
mance either. We experimented with different up-
sampling ratios and report best results using ratio
1:1 in Figure 2.

et al., 2011), MIML (Surdeanu et al., 2012)

Our baselines: 1) MaxEnt is a supervised maxi-
mum entropy baseline trained on a human-labeled
data; 2) DS+upsampling is an upsampling ex-
periment, where MIML was trained on a mix of
a distantly-labeled and human-labeled data; 3)
Semi-MIML is a recent semi-supervised exten-
sion. We also compare Guided DS with three
state-of-the-art models: 1) MultiR and 2) MIML
are two distant supervision models that support
multi-instance learning and overlapping relations;
3) Mintz++ is a single-instance learning algorithm
for distant supervision. The difference between
Guided DS and all other systems is significant
with p-value less than 0.05 according to a paired
t-test assuming a normal distribution.

5.3 Results

We scored our model against all 41 relations and
thus replicated the actual KBP evaluation. Figure
2 shows that our model consistently outperforms
all six algorithms at almost all recall levels and im-
proves the maximum F -score by more than 13.5%
relative to MIML (from 28.35% to 32.19%) as well
as increases the area under precision-recall curve
by more than 37% (from 11.74 to 16.1). Also,
Guided DS improves the overall recall by more
than 9% absolute (from 30.9% to 39.93%) at a
comparable level of precision (24.35% for MIML
vs 23.64% for Guided DS), while increases the
running time of MIML by only 3%. Thus, our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art model for
relation extraction using much less labeled data
that was used by Zhang et al., (2012) to outper-

form logistic regression baseline. Performance
of Guided DS also compares favorably with best
scored hand-coded systems for a similar task such
as Sun et al., (2011) system for KBP 2011, which
reports an F-score of 25.7%.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
We show that relation extractors trained with dis-
tant supervision can benefit significantly from a
small number of human labeled examples. We
propose a strategy to generate and select guide-
lines so that they are more generalized forms of
labeled instances. We show how to incorporate
these guidelines into an existing state-of-art model
for relation extraction. Our approach significantly
improves performance in practice and thus opens
up many opportunities for further research in RE
where only a very limited amount of labeled train-
ing data is available.
