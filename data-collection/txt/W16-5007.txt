Abstract

This paper discusses the need for a dictionary of affixal negations and regular antonyms to fa-
cilitate their automatic detection in text. Without such a dictionary, affixal negations are very
difficult to detect. In addition, we show that the set of affixal negations is not homogeneous,
and that different NLP tasks may require different subsets. A dictionary can store the subtypes
of affixal negations, making it possible to select a certain subset or to make inferences on the
basis of these subtypes. We take a first step towards creating an affixal negation dictionary by
annotating all direct antonym pairs in WordNet using an existing typology of affixal negations.
By highlighting some of the issues that were encountered in this annotation experiment, we hope
to provide some insights into the necessary steps of building a negation dictionary.

1 Introduction

Affixal negations can be defined as words marked with a negative affix (in English, either the prefixes
un-, in-, dis-, a-, an-, non-, im-, il-, ir-, or the suffix -less). As they typically flag the absence of par-
ticular features, detecting affixal negations is very useful for natural language processing tasks such as
text mining, recognizing textual entailment, paraphrasing, or question answering. Despite their simple
definition, affixal negations are very difficult to detect automatically without a substantial false positive
rate. Blanco and Moldovan (2011) note:

“No simple search could unequivocally distinguish between a negated word such as ineffective
and the words that just happen to begin with the letters of a negative prefix, such as invite.
The problem could be partially solved by checking if, after removal of the prefix, the word
is still valid. This method mismarks inform as negation because form is a valid word. To
complicate matters further, some words are valid both as negated base words and as words
in their own right: The adjective invalid means not valid, while the noun invalid describes a
disabled person.” (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011, p. 232)

Blanco and Moldavan conclude that the field might be best served by a dictionary-based approach;
once we have a list of affixal negations (ideally along with their antonyms), it becomes trivial to detect
this kind of negation through a simple string-matching algorithm. Before we can produce such a list,
however, we first need to agree on a set of annotation guidelines describing what constitutes an affixal
negation, and what does not. This paper aims to highlight some of the main issues to be considered when
building a negation dictionary, and reports on a first attempt to build one.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we explore the full range of lexical negation, explain-
ing how regular antonyms and affixal negations are two sides of the same coin. We show that there are
different semantic categories of lexical negation and argue that their relevance is determined by the task to
be solved. Section 3 reports on an annotation experiment in which all antonym pairs in WordNet (Miller,
1995; Fellbaum, 1998b) were annotated with the subtypes of affixal negations defined by Joshi (2012).

Section 4 provides a follow-up discussion on the requirements of a negation dictionary (based on what
we learned from the annotation experiment) and its limits for automatic detection. Finally, we conclude
our paper in Section 5.

2 Defining lexical negation

This section aims to define affixal negation from a broad natural language processing perspective. We
first discuss the Conan Doyle negation corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2012), which has a narrow
definition of ‘affixal negation’. We argue that this definition is the result of the task that Morante and
Daelemans (2012) envisioned for their corpus. Following this observation, we explore the range of
lexical negations. First, in Section 2.2, we argue that there’s hardly any semantic reason to not to study
antonyms along with affixal negation, since both are marked and express an opposition to something
else. Then, in Section 2.3, we review some literature on semantic categorization of lexical negation,
revealing that there is a rich landscape of affixal negations beyond the commonly studied subclass of
direct negations.

2.1 Affixal negation
Affixal negation can be defined as a type of negation that is marked by the presence of a negative affix.
However, not every affixal negation is relevant for each task; its relevance is determined by the semantics
of the affixal negation and the goal of the task at hand. For example, Morante and Daelemans (2012)
included affixal negations as part of their annotations of negation information at sentence level in two
Conan Doyle stories. In the guidelines that were provided for these annotations, Morante et al. (2011)
describe their main goal as follows:

In these guidelines we aim at describing how to annotate the words that express negation and
the part of a sentence that is affected by the negation words. The words that express negation
are called negation cues and the part of the sentence that is affected by a negation cue is called
the scope. [...] The final goal of annotating negation cues and their scope is to determine which
events in the sentence are affected by the negation. (Morante et al., 2011, p. 3-4)

Morante et al. (2011) use a narrow definition of affixal negation, in which not all negative affixes are
negation cues. According to the guidelines, a word with a negative affix is only considered an affixal
negation if the meaning of the affixed word is a direct antonym of its non-affixed counterpart. So unclear
is an affixal negation, because its meaning is the opposite of clear. This can be contrasted with examples
such as unspoken (which does not mean ‘not spoken’, but ‘understood without the need for words’) and
disappear (which does not mean ‘not appear’, but ‘to pass out of sight; vanish’). Despite these words
having some negative meaning component, they are not considered affixal negations.

The choice of what type of affixal negation to include in a dictionary or annotation task depends
on the goal of the task to be solved. The narrow definition used by Morante et al. (2011) is a direct
consequence of their main goal: to annotate information relative to the negative polarity of an event.
The resulting corpus is meant to support the development of a system that can distinguish between facts
and counterfacts. Therefore, they focus exclusively on negations that turn an event into a negated event,
disregarding any expression that does not meet this criterion. As a consequence, affixal negations are
only annotated if the affix negates the event or property expressed by its base. For other tasks, however,
it may be relevant to include other kinds of affixal negations. In the context of sentiment analysis it
all depends on whether or not the affixal derivative or its base is opinionated; words like flawless or
disqualify should be included in a polarity lexicon (Wiegand et al., 2010), whereas words like untie or
backless would be irrelevant. In the context of question answering, however, knowing what the word
backless entails is essential to know the answer to the question does the dress have a closed back?

2.2 Regular antonyms
In the previous subsection we have argued that, depending on its goal, the task to be solved may require
a certain subset of affixal negations. On the other hand, the full set of affixal negations may still not

50



be sufficient if the task requires taking all sorts of opposites into account. That is, regular antonyms
might have to be considered in addition to affixal negations. After all, the difference between the two
categories is only morphological. The items in (1) illustrate our point; all entail the falsehood of their
positive counterpart (tasteful, delicious, great):

(1) a. distasteful (a ‘true’ affixal negation)
b. disgusting (only etymologically an affixal negation)
c. dead (a regular antonym)

Moreover, we might consider these items as points on a continuous scale going from explicitly (1a) to
implicitly (1c) marked lexical items.1 Joshi (2012) uses the term lexical negation to denote both affixal
negations and antonyms, leading to the taxonomy in Figure 1 (the difference between direct and indirect
negation will be discussed in the next section). This taxonomy, we argue, shows the full picture that NLP
researchers interested in negation ought to consider.

Negation

Regular antonyms

Affixal negation Indirect negation
Direct negation

Clausal & phrasal negation

Figure 1: Taxonomy of negations, based on (Joshi, 2012).

To some extent, WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998b) and thesauri such as Roget’s (Roget, 1911)
already provide a collection of lexical negations. In WordNet, antonymy is defined as a lexical relation
between individual lexemes that have clear opposite meanings (rather than between concepts, i.e. all the
members of a synset). These ‘direct antonym’ pairs, such as wet:dry or long:short, are psychologically
salient and have a strong associative bond between them resulting from their frequent co-occurrence
(Fellbaum, 1998a). ‘Indirect antonyms’, then, result from similarity relations defined for the members of
these direct antonym pairs. For example, moist and humid are classified as semantically similar to wet,
and are therefore indirect antonyms of the lexeme dry. See Figure 2 for a schematic representation of
these similarity and antonymy relations in WordNet. However, these resources do not further character-
ize the relations between the members of an antonymous pair. Mohammad et al. (2008) point out that
WordNet does not encode the degree of antonymy between words; in this paper we aim to show that it
is not so much the degree that should be encoded (we think that the distinction between direct and indi-
rect antonyms already covers this for the most part), but semantic categories that enable distinguishing
between, for example, clear:unclear and appear:disappear.

negations and antonyms.

2.3 Semantic categories of lexical negation

As the examples in Section 2.1 illustrate, the set of affixal negations is not homogeneous. Joshi (2012)
proposes grouping affixal negations into two main groups: direct and indirect. Direct negation expresses
a direct opposition with its positive counterpart and “is characterized by the NOT-element in the derivative
with respect to its base” (Joshi, 2012, p. 20). For example, unhappy can be paraphrased as not happy.
Indirect negation, on the other hand, does not logically negate the existence of its base, yet still maintains
a negative connotation (e.g. dismount, debug). Joshi (2012) further subcategorizes indirect negation
into the types presented in Table 1. Knowledge of these subtypes is useful for making inferences about
sentences containing indirect affixal negations. For example, the subtypes ‘reversal of action’ (e.g. in she
unlocked the door) and ‘removal‘ (e.g. in dislodging a stone from the wall) allow for inferences about
previous states.

Category Definition Examples

Reversal of direction (ROD) Indicating movement in an opposite direction (without
negating the concept of movement indicated by the base).

diverge, decrease

Reversal of action (ROA) Indicates an action performed to reverse another previous
action.

untie, disconnect

Inferiority (INF) Indicates a lower value or quality (without negating the
existence of its base).

hypoacid, hypotension

Insufficiency (INS) Gives a precision about the level, taken as negative in
some contexts.

subnormal, underestimate

Badness/wrong (WRO) Gives a precise description of someone’s behaviour in a
negative way.

miscalculate, misjudge

Over-abundance (OVA) Indicates an excessive and undesired quantity of activity. hyperactive, overrate
Pejorative (PEJ) Pejorative indication of excessive behaviour. drunkard, braggart
Opposition (OPP) Indicates an opposition in notion, action, ideology, etc. anti-terrorist, antimatter
Removal (REM) Indicates the removal of something. debug, dislodge

Table 1: Subtypes of indirect negation from (Joshi, 2012, p. 27). Definitions have been slightly reworded
for clarity and some examples have been changed from Sanskrit or French to English for more uniformity.

Joshi’s categorization system is organized in terms of the relation between the affix and the base. This
can be contrasted with the taxonomy of Cruse (1986), which offers a characterization of the full domain
of opposition relations between lexical items. Table 2 illustrates this, with a selection of opposition rela-
tions identified by Cruse. The overarching goal of (Cruse, 1986) is to describe the structural properties
of the lexicon. Despite the differences between Joshi’s and Cruse’s approaches, we can also observe
some similarities. For example, Cruse’s category of ‘reversives’ strongly relates to Joshi’s subtypes of
‘reversal of action/direction’ and ‘removal’.

3 Building a negation dictionary

As noted by Blanco and Moldovan (2011), dealing with affixal negations seems to require a dictionary-
based approach. We have shown that having a list of affixal negations may not be enough; we also need
to specify the relation between the affix and the base in order to know what a word like backless or
miscalculate entails. Furthermore, we have shown that affixal negations are part of a larger phenomenon
that might either be called lexical negation (Joshi) or lexical opposition (Cruse). Ultimately, it seems to
us that a dictionary-based approach should capture negation/opposition at this level, but creating such a
dictionary goes beyond the scope of this paper. We will however take a step in this direction by testing
the feasibility of creating a negation dictionary using Joshi’s typology.

As a starting point for our negation dictionary, we have taken all pairs of direct antonyms from Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998b), which include both affixal negations and regular antonyms (WordNet does not
make an explicit distinction between them). The full set comprises 3,557 antonym pairs and includes
verbs, nouns, (satellite) adjectives and adverbs.2

dicate potential paths, which, if followed by two mov-
ing lines, would result in their moving in opposite direc-
tions.”

3.1 Annotation tasks
We included the following information from WordNet about the antonym pairs in our dictionary: (1) the
lemmas of both antonyms, (2) the lemma identifiers of both antonyms, (3) the definitions of both
antonyms, and (4) the part of speech. Then, we performed the following three annotation steps to enrich
the entries:

1. Affixal or non-affixal: For each antonym pair, we annotated whether the antonym pair contained
an affixal negation or not. If applicable, the negative and the positive affixes were annotated as well.

2. Direct or indirect: For each affixal negation, we indicated whether it was a direct or an indirect
negation according to the definitions provided by Joshi (2012).

3. Subtype: Each indirect affixal negation was classified into one of the nine subtypes defined by
Joshi (2012): ROD, ROA, INF, INS, WRO, OVA, PEJ, OPP, or REM (see Table 1). In addition, we
introduced a label LAC for affixal negations that indicate that some characteristic is lacking.

Table 3 shows a few simplified examples of the resulting entries in the dictionary. The tasks were
performed by two annotators. A set of 500 randomly selected antonym pairs was annotated by both
annotators in order to measure inter-annotator agreement.

Positive element Negative element POS Positive affix Negative affix Direct/indirect Subtype

structured unstructured a NA un- direct NA
inshore offshore a in- off- indirect ROD
colonize decolonize v NA de- indirect ROA
revolutionary counter-revolutionary a NA counter- indirect OPP
used misused a NA mis- indirect WRO
humerously humerlessly r -ous -less indirect LAC

definitions are excluded for reasons of space).

3.2 Evaluation
Inter-annotator agreement was measured using Cohen’s kappa for each of the three annotation tasks. For
subtask (1), determining whether the antonym pair contained an affixal negation or not, we measured an
IAA score of 0.80 (n=500). Most of the disagreements (58%) on this task were caused by mistakes of the
annotators. The remaining 42% consisted of pairs where it was a bit more difficult to determine whether
it should be considered an affixal negation or not. Examples are onstage:offstage, intrusive:extrusive,
concealing:revealing. For subtask (2), indicating whether the affixal negation was direct or indirect, a
rather low IAA score of 0.55 was obtained (n=268). Finally, we achieved an IAA of 0.76 (n=43) for
subtask (3), the classification of indirect negations into their subtypes.

Table 4 represents the confusion matrix for the annotation of the subtypes; the ‘direct’ label is also
included to show the disagreements between this label and each of the subtypes of indirect negation as
well. What we can see from this confusion matrix is that one annotator annotated 35 antonym pairs as
‘direct negation’, whereas the other annotated these pairs as an indirect negation of the subtype ‘oppo-
sition’. It appeared that it was not exactly clear what types of negation are covered by the ‘opposition‘
type; although the definition provided by Joshi (2012) (“opposition in notion, action, ideology, etc.”)
can be understood in a very broad sense and seems similar to direct negation, the examples illustrating
this subtype in (Joshi, 2012) are more specific (anti-terrorist, antimatter). Most of the disagreements
(29/35) caused by this uncertainty regarding the definition of ‘opposition‘ were on antonym pairs with
an affixal negation starting with the prefix non-, such as modern:non-modern, fictional:non-fictional,
competitive:non-competitive.

LAC direct OPP OVA/INS ROA ROD WRO
INS 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
LAC 18 0 0 0 0 1 0
direct 0 179 35 0 3 1 0
OPP 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
OVA/INS 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
REM 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
ROA 0 6 0 0 12 1 0
ROD 0 0 1 0 2 2 0
WRO 0 0 0 0 0 0 2

Table 4: Confusion matrix for the annotation of subtypes

There was also some confusion between ‘direct negation‘ and the subtype ‘reversal of action’, but
most of them appeared to be mistakes (incorrectly annotated as ‘direct‘). Finally, the antonym pairs
where both annotators recognized an indirect affixal negation but disagreed on the subtype were:

Antonym pair Annotator 1 Annotator 2

arming:disarming removal reversal of action
content:discontent reversal of direction reversal of action
pressurise:depressurise reversal of direction reversal of action
conjunctive:disjunctive reversal of direction opposition
attachable:detachable reversal of action reversal of direction
merit:demerit lack reversal of direction
fluency:disfluency insufficiency lack

the subtype.

4 Discussion

4.1 Annotating the relation between lexical items, or between affix and the base
Some words raised doubts for both annotators during the annotation process. One of these cases was
the difference between the characterizations of verbal affixal negations and their inflected forms. For
example, the antonym pair fasten (“become fixed or fastened”) and unfasten (“become undone or untied”)

54



is a clear example of reversal of action. However, unfastened (“not closed or secured”) seems more of
a direct negation with respect to its base fastened (“firmly closed or secured”). The difficulty with
participles like this one, which are stored as adjectives in WordNet, is that they indicate a state that can
be interpreted as a result of the action expressed by its verbal base (e.g. unfasten) - but not necessarily
(it might never have been fastened at all). Similar doubts were raised regarding antonym pairs such as
spinous (“having spines”) and spineless (“lacking spiny processes”). Even though the affix -less clearly
expresses the lack of something and both annotators annotated these cases as LAC, spineless is just a
direct negation (“not having spines”) in relation to its antonym spinous.

Both examples are related to the question: are we annotating the relation between the affix and
its base (spine:spineless), or the oppositional relation between the two members of an antonym pair
(spinous:spineless)? And if we are annotating the relation between the affix and its base, what exactly
should be considered the base? The simple, uninflected form (fasten) or the lexeme with just the negative
affix stripped off (fastened)? These are questions that were not explicitly answered for the annotation
reported in this paper, but should in fact play a central role in any future effort to build a negation dictio-
nary.

4.2 Coverage

As with any lexical resource, a negation dictionary is only as good as its coverage. And since affixal
negation is a productive phenomenon, we can ask ourselves: what would be a good fallback strategy
to detect and reason about affixal negations? As noted by Blanco and Moldovan (2011), cited in the
introduction of this paper, simple string matching algorithms will produce many false positives. One
way to reduce those false positives and increase coverage might be to train a classifier (using either
word-level (Mikolov et al., 2013) or character-level (Kim et al., 2016) representations) to recognize (1)
whether a word has a negative component, and (2) what kind of relation exists between the affix and the
base. Training such a classifier still requires us to annotate negations, however, and to think about the
relations that the classifier should learn.

5 Conclusion

We have argued that many NLP tasks could benefit from a negation dictionary, since this would solve
some of the problems that are currently encountered when detecting negations in text. One of these
problems is that it is difficult to distinguish between affixal negations and words that just happen to
begin with the letters of a negative prefix. However, we have shown that a simple list of affixal negations
would not suffice; there is a range of different kinds of affixal negations, and which of these are relevant to
include depends on the NLP task that is to be supported by the list. In addition, we have noted that, from
a semantic point of view, affixal negations are not that different from negative adjectives. A dictionary
that is supposed to cover the complete spectrum of lexical negation should therefore include both affixal
negations and antonyms. This paper does not offer the final solution to building the perfect negation
dictionary. Nevertheless, we hope that it contributes its share to the discussion by highlighting some of
the main issues to be considered when building one and by proposing some elements that we think such
a dictionary should minimally include: the opposing pair of lexical items with their definitions, the type
of relation between them, and what affix is used (if applicable).
