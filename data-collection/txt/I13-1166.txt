Abstract

Previous research on quality estimation
for machine translation has demonstrated
the possibility of predicting the transla-
tion quality of well-formed data. We
present a first study on estimating the
translation quality of user-generated con-
tent. Our dataset contains English tech-
nical forum comments which were trans-
lated into French by three automatic sys-
tems. These translations were rated in
terms of both comprehensibility and fi-
delity by human annotators. Our exper-
iments show that tried-and-tested quality
estimation features work well on this type
of data but that extending this set can be
beneficial. We also show that the perfor-
mance of particular types of features de-
pends on the type of system used to pro-
duce the translation.

1 Introduction

Quality Estimation (QE) involves judging the cor-
rectness of a system output given an input with-
out any output reference. Substantial progress has
been made on QE for Machine Translation (MT),
but research has been mainly conducted on well-
formed, edited text (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing
et al., 2003; Raybaud et al., 2009; Specia et al.,
2009). We turn our attention to estimating the
quality of user-generated content (UGC) transla-
tion – a particularly relevant use of QE since the
translation process is likely to be affected by the
noisy nature of the input, particularly if the MT
system is trained on well-formed text.

The source language content is collected from
an IT Web forum in English and translated into
French by three automatic systems. For each
MT system, the produced translation is manually
evaluated following two criteria: the translation

comprehensibility and fidelity. We evaluate sev-
eral feature sets on the UGC dataset including the
baseline suggested by the organisers of the WMT
2012 QE for MT shared task (Callison-Burch et
al., 2012) and a feature set designed to model typ-
ical characteristics of forum text.

The novel contributions of the paper are: 1)
testing the WMT QE for MT Shared Task base-
line feature set on the UGC dataset and demon-
strating its portability, 2) introducing new features
which contribute to significant performance gains
on both QE tasks, and 3) building three different
QE systems using three different MT systems and
showing that the usefulness of a feature type de-
pends on the MT system although better perfor-
mance can be achieved by training a QE system
on the combined output of the three systems.

The paper is organised as follows. Related work
on QE for MT is described in Section 2, followed
in Section 3 by a description of the dataset. We de-
scribe the QE features in Section 4 and present the
results of our experiments in Section 5. A discus-
sion of the results, as well as a comparison with
previous work, are presented in Section 6. Finally,
we conclude and suggest future work in Section 7.

2 Background

The main approach for QE in MT is based on es-
timating how correct MT output is through char-
acteristic elements extracted from the source and
the target texts and the MT system involved in the
translation process. These elements, or features,
are seen as predictive parameters that can be com-
bined with machine learning methods to estimate
binary, multi-class, or continuous scores. First
applied at the word level (Gandrabur and Foster,
2003; Ueffing et al., 2003), QE for MT was then
extended to the sentence level during a workshop
in the same year (Blatz et al., 2003).

Many different feature sources have been used
including surface features (segment length, punc-

1167



tuation marks, etc.), language model features
(perplexity, log-probability, etc.), word or phrase
alignment features, n-best list features, internal
MT system scores (Quirk, 2004; Ueffing and Ney,
2004), and linguistic features (Gamon et al., 2005;
Specia and Gimenez, 2010). In a recent study, fea-
tures based on the intra-language mutual informa-
tion between words and backward language mod-
els were introduced (Raybaud et al., 2011). Other
studies evaluate the gain brought by features ex-
tracted from MT output back-translation (Albrecht
and Hwa, 2007), pseudo-references in the form
of output from other MT systems for the same
source sentence (Soricut et al., 2012), and topic
models (Rubino et al., 2012).

Previous studies also differ on the labels to
predict: binary scores (Quirk, 2004) or continu-
ous scores such as those given by automatic met-
rics (Bojar et al., 2013) or averaged human evalu-
ations (Specia et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al.,
2012). As regards the learning algorithms used,
several have been tried, with support vector ma-
chine and decision tree learning proving popu-
lar (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).

3 Dataset

We use the dataset presented in Roturier and Ben-
sadoun (2011), which was obtained by machine-
translating 694 English segments, harvested from
the Symantec English Norton forum1, into French
using three different translators (MOSES (Koehn
et al., 2007), MICROSOFT2 (MS) and SYSTRAN).
The translations were then evaluated in terms of
comprehensibility (1 to 5 scale) and fidelity (bi-
nary scale) by human annotators. The source side
of this data set represents user-generated content –
see Banerjee et al. (2012) for a detailed descrip-
tion of the characteristics of this type of data and
see Table 2 for some examples. For each of the
three translators, we extract 500 segments from
this dataset to build our training sets. The re-
maining 194 segments per translator are used as
test sets. The distribution of the comprehensibility
and fidelity classes over the three MT systems are
shown in Table 1.

4 Quality Estimation Features

In this section, we describe the features which we
added to the 17 baseline features provided by the

WMT12 QE shared task organisers to make our
“extended” feature set. We then introduce a set of
37 features which relate specifically to the user-
generated-content aspect of our data.

4.1 Extended Feature Set

- 15 Surface Features Average target word
length, average source word occurrence, number
of uppercased letters and the ratio of all source
and target surface features.
- 180 Language Model Features Source and
target n-gram (n ∈ [1; 5]) log-probabilities and
perplexities on two LMs built on the seventh
version of Europarl and the eighth version of
News-Commentary (30 features). The same
number of features are extracted from a backward
version of these two LMs (Duchateau et al.,
2002). We repeat this feature extraction process
using four LMs built on the Symantec Translation
Memories (TMs)3 and four LMs built on the
monolingual Symantec forum data4.
- 15 MT Output Language Model Features
A MOSES English-French PB-SMT system is
trained on the Symantec TMs and the same target
LM used to extract the baseline LM features. The
English side of the Symantec Norton monolingual
forum data is translated by this system and the
output is used to build a 5-gram LM. Target
features are then extracted in a similar way as the
standard LM features.
- 4 Word Alignment Features Using
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and the Symantec
TMs, word alignment probabilities are extracted
from the source and target segments.
- 78 n-gram Frequency Features The number
of source and target segments unigrams seen in a
reference corpus plus the percentage of n-grams
in frequency quartiles (n ∈ [1; 5]). The reference
corpus is the same corpus used to extract the LM
features.

3∼ 1.6M aligned segments in English and French.
4∼ 3M segments in English and ∼ 40k segments in

French.

Table 2: Processing challenges associated with forum text: some examples.

- 9 Back-translation Features We translate the
target segments back into the source language
using 3 different MT systems: MS, SYSTRAN
and a MOSES PB-SMT system (trained on the
Symantec TMs) and we measure the distance
between the original source segments and the
back-translated ones using BLEU, TER and
Levenshtein.
- 23 Topic Features Following Rubino et
al. (2012; 2013), a bilingual topic model based on
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) is
built using the Symantec TMs. 20 features are the
source and target segment distributions over the
10-dimensional topic space and 3 features are the
distances between these distributions, using the
cosine, euclidean distance and city-block metrics.
- 16 Pseudo-reference Features Following Sori-
cut et al. (2012), we compare each MT system
output to the two others using sentence-level
BLEU, error information provided by TER (no.
of insertions, deletions, etc.) and Levenshtein.
- 3 Part-of-Speech Features We count the
number of POS tag types in the source and target
segments, extracted from trees produced by the
Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). The
ratio of these two values is also included.

4.2 UGC-related Features

We also experiment with features that capture the
noisy nature of UGC. Some are related to the in-
consistent use of character case, some to non-
standard punctuation, some to spelling mistakes
and some to the tendency of sentence splitters to
underperform on this type of text. From each
source-target pair, we extract the following infor-
mation (in the form of one feature for the source
segment, one for the target segment and, where ap-
propriate, one for the ratio between the two):
- 11 Case Features the number of upper and
lowercased words, the number of fully upper-
cased words, the number of mixed-case words and
whether or not the segment begins with an upper-
case letter.
- 13 Punctuation Features the ratio between
punctuation characters and other characters, the

number of words containing a full stop, the num-
ber of sentences produced by an off-the-shelf
sentence splitter for each segment (included in
NLTK (Bird, 2006)), whether or not the segment
contains a dash, an ellipsis, and whether or not the
segment ends with a punctuation symbol.
- 9 Acronym and Emotion Features the number
of web and IT-domain acronyms and the number
of emoticons.
- 4 Linguistic Features the number of spelling
mistakes flagged by the spellchecker LANGUAGE-
TOOL5 and whether or not the segment starts with
a verb (indicating imperatives or questions).

5 Experiments

Classification models are built using the C-SVC
implementation in LIBSVM (Chang and Lin,
2011) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.
Optimal hyper-parameters C and γ are found by
grid-search with a 5-fold cross-validation on the
training set (optimising for accuracy). For evalua-
tion, we measure the accuracy, Mean Absolute Er-
ror (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
All the results are compared to the baseline for sig-
nificance testing using bootstrap resampling. We
present the results on the comprehensibility task
first, followed by the results on the fidelity task.
In order to remove noisy and redundant features
we also experiment with feature selection. We try
several approaches6 and report results with the ap-
proach that performs best during cross-validation
on the training set.

5.1 Translation Comprehensibility Results

The full set of comprehensibility estimation re-
sults are presented in Table 3. We see that a higher
classification accuracy does not necessarily im-
ply lower MAE and RMSE, e.g. the MOSES and

5http://www.languagetool.org/
6These include information gain univariate filtering,

correlation-based multivariate filtering , a naive Bayes wrap-
per approach and principal component analysis. All are im-
plemented in the WEKA machine learning toolkit (Hall et al.,
2009). Of the approaches tried, none stood out as clearly su-
perior to the others and the choice seems to depend on the
task and the MT system.

SYSTRAN experiments show that the extended set
leads to a higher classification accuracy compared
to the baseline, while the two error scores are
lower on the baseline compared to the extended
set. This discrepancy can happen because the ac-
curacy measure is not sensitive to differences be-
tween comprehensibility scores whereas the error
measures are – the error measures will prefer a
system which gives a 5-scoring translation a score
of 4 than one which gives it a score of 1. Statistical
significance tests show that the extended feature
set outperforms the baseline significantly only for
the system trained on MS translations. The UGC
feature set seems to add useful information only
for the system trained on MOSES translations.

To evaluate the impact of different types of fea-
tures, we conduct an evaluation by feature subset
(see Figure 1). The results show that the best-
performing features vary across the MT systems.
The pseudo-reference and POS features are par-
ticularly useful for the system trained on MOSES
translations. For the system trained on MS transla-
tions, the n-gram frequency features based on the
Symantec TMs are clearly outperforming all the
other feature types, with an accuracy of 42.8%.
For the system trained on SYSTRAN translations,

score of 56.7%, which outperforms the extended
set. The system trained on MS translations does
not benefit from the pseudo-reference features as
much as the two other QE systems. Perhaps this
is because these features provide a reliable indi-
cation of translation quality when the two MT
systems being compared are trained on similar
data – MOSES was trained using the domain- and
genre-specific data and SYSTRAN is optimized us-
ing a domain-specific lexicon, which increases the
proximity of the translations generated by these
two systems. LM features appear to be very use-
ful for the three MT systems: the backward LM
built on the TMs leads to the best accuracy results
amongst the LM-based features for MS, while
SYSTRAN and MOSES benefit from features ex-
tracted using a backward LM built on forum data.

According to the results in Fig. 1, several fea-
ture types individually outperform the baseline
and the extended sets, which indicates that un-
suited features are included in these two sets and
motivates the application of feature selection. The
feature selection algorithms are applied in two
ways: on the extended set and on each feature
type individually. For this second approach, the
reduced feature types are combined to form the
final set. The results obtained with the first and
second feature selection methods are presented in
the fourth and fifth rows of Table 3 respectively.
The systems trained on MS and SYSTRAN transla-
tions clearly benefit from the feature selection pro-
cess with significant improvement over the base-
line. For the system trained on the MOSES transla-
tions, only the accuracy scores are improved over
the baseline. The choice of which of the two meth-
ods of applying feature selection to use also de-
pends on MT system.

As the training set for each MT system is small
(500 instances), we combine these training sets
and build a mixed-translator classification model
(last row in Table 3). Note that this means that
each training source segment will appear three
times (one for each of the MT systems). We use
the Extended+UGC feature set to build the mixed-
translator model. Comparing to the results in the
third row (individual MT classification model), we
observe that it is generally beneficial to combine
the translations into one larger model.

5.2 Translation Fidelity Results
The fidelity results are presented in Table 4.7

MOSES MS SYSTRAN
Baseline 81.4 62.9 68.0
Extended 81.4 63.4 76.8
Extended+UGC 80.4 65.5 73.7
Extended+sel. 77.3 64.4 72.2
Type+sel. 82.0 69.1 74.2
Mixed-Translator: Ext+UGC 82.0 66.5 76.3

Table 4: Accuracy for fidelity estimation, best re-
sults are in bold.

According to the results for the extended fea-
ture set, the baseline result for the system trained
on MOSES translations appears to be very diffi-
cult to improve upon. For this system, adding
the UGC features actually degraded the accuracy
scores, while it helps the system trained on MS
translations. The extended set reaches the best ac-
curacy scores (76.8%) for the system trained on
SYSTRAN translations with a 8.8pt absolute im-
provement over the baseline set. However, statis-
tical significance testing show that none of the im-
provements over the baseline are statistically sig-
nificant.

As with the comprehensibility results, the im-
pact of the feature sets depends on the MT system
(see Figure 2). Again, the pseudo-reference fea-
tures lead to the highest accuracy score for the sys-
tem trained on MOSES translations (+2.1pts abso-
lute compared to the baseline and extended sets)
and the system trained on SYSTRAN translations
(equal to the extended set), while it is not the case
for the system trained on MS translations. For this
latter system, the n-gram frequency features based
on the forum data reach 66.0% accuracy. The ac-
curacy results per feature type show a larger di-
vergence compared to the results obtained on the

scores prediction because it is a binary classification task.

comprehensibility task. Some feature types appear
to be particularly noisy for the fidelity task, for in-
stance the surface features for MOSES, the back-
translation for MS and the word-alignment for
SYSTRAN. To tackle this issue, the same feature
selection methods previously used for the compre-
hensibility task are applied. The fourth and fifth
rows in Table 4 show the results for the two meth-
ods of applying feature selection. We can see that
selecting features within individual feature types
leads to better results compared to applying fea-
ture selection to the full set.

As with the comprehensibility task, we build a
mixed-translator fidelity estimator using the Ex-
tended+UGC feature set (last row in Table 4) and
we observe here also that it is beneficial to com-
bine the training data compared to training indi-
vidual models.

6 Analysis

Adding features to the baseline set does not neces-
sarily lead to better QE. Perhaps the baseline fea-
ture set is already diverse enough (surface, LM,
word alignment, etc.). However, an error analysis
shows that including the UGC features does bring
useful information, especially when the source
segments contain URLs, as shown in Table 5. In
the case of untranslated elements, the spellchecker
sometimes provides important information to the
classifier about the MT output quality.

When we compare the QE results over the three
MT systems, there is substantial variation. One
possible explanation for this variation is the class
distributions for the three sets of translations. The
set whose quality is hardest to predict (MS) is
the one with a more balanced distribution over the
classes for both tasks (see Table 1). As classifiers

can be biased towards the majority class, the QE
task appears to be more difficult with a balanced
dataset with a high standard deviation.

The best-performing feature type varies
amongst the MT systems. For instance, the
features built on the domain-specific translation
memories (LMs and n-gram counts) bring more
useful information when estimating the transla-
tion comprehensibility of the MS translations.
It is possible that this is happening because the
MOSES and SYSTRAN systems were trained on
domain-specific data while the MS system was
not. Domain-specific features may be particularly
helpful in estimating the quality of the output of a
general-purpose, non-domain-tuned MT system.

Although the MS translations represent the
most difficult set for the QE task, they are the best
translations according to BLEU score (0.39 com-
pared to 0.37 for MOSES and 0.35 for SYSTRAN).
However it is not possible to conclude from this
that there is a negative correlation between MT
and QE performance since there are only three
MT systems and the differences between them are
small. Whether or not this points to a general
trend requires further experimentation with other
QE datasets, feature sets and MT systems.

To test the portability of our feature set and fea-
ture selection methods, we evaluate them on the
WMT 2012 shared task dataset. The feature set
contains the same features as the Extended set,
apart from the ones which could not be extracted
from the training data provided by the shared task
organisers, such as forum and Symantec TM LMs
and n-gram features. We report the results in Ta-
ble 6. We do not outperform the baseline features
in terms of RMSE but we do with MAE. Fea-
ture selection does not bring any improvement in
MAE, but RMSE is slightly improved when selec-
tion is carried out at the level of individual feature
type. Our system lags behind the top-ranked sys-
tem (Soricut et al., 2012) – more feature selection
experimentation is required in order to narrow this
gap. It would also be interesting to see how the
top-ranked system performs on our UGC dataset.

7 Conclusion

We have conducted a series of quality estimation
experiments on English-French user-generated
content, estimating both translation comprehensi-
bility and fidelity, and training systems on the out-
put of three individual MT systems. The experi-
ments show that the information brought by a type
of feature can be more or less useful depending on
the MT system used. We show that the baseline
suggested by the WMT12 QE shared task organ-
isers leads to respectable results on user-generated
content but we also show that there is sometimes
some modest benefit to be found in extending this
feature set. The features that are designed specif-
ically to take into account that our data is user-
generated content did not perform as well as other
new features. However, we cannot conclude from
this that modelling the forum characteristics of our
data is unnecessary since the LM features trained
on forum text perform well. In the future we plan
to apply QE at the level of forum post rather than
segment.
