Abstract 
In Machine Translation, divergence is one of the major barriers which plays a deciding role in determining 
the efficiency of the system at hand. Translation divergences originate when there is structural 
discrepancies between the input and the output languages. It can be of various types based on the issues 
we are addressing to such as linguistic, cultural, communicative and so on. Owing to the fact that two 
languages owe their origin to different language families, linguistic divergences emerge. The present 
study attempts at categorizing different types of linguistic divergences: the lexical-semantic and syntactic. 
In addition, it also helps identify and resolve the divergent linguistic features between English as source 
language and Bhojpuri as target language pair. Dorr’s theoretical framework (1994, 1994a) has been 
followed in the classification and resolution procedure. Furthermore, so far as the methodology is 
concerned, we have adhered to the Dorr’s Lexical Conceptual Structure for the resolution of divergences. 
This research will prove to be beneficial for developing efficient MT systems if the mentioned factors are 
incorporated considering the inherent structural constraints between source and target languages. 

1 Overview 
The terminology ‘divergence’ refers to the concept of structural or ‘parametric variation’ between a 
source language (SL) and a target language (TL) pair in Machine Translation (MT). In other words, it 
emerges when the decoded output content lacks ‘well-formedness’ because of the inherent linguistic 
constraints. According to Dorr (1993), “translation divergence arises when the natural translation of 
one language into another results in a very different form than that of the original.” Therefore, it is 
pertinent for the identification of divergences as it facilitates and builds a blueprint towards the 
architectural design and implementation of MT platforms (Parameswari, 2015). So far, the availability 
of literature in divergence is meagre with regard to the less-resourced languages like Bhojpuri. In 
English-Indian languages, research on divergence has been conducted in around 9 languages: Sanskrit 
(Shukla et al., 2010), Hindi (Gupta & Chatterjee, 2003; Sinha & Thakur, 2005; Sinha & Thakur, 2005a), 
Urdu (Saboor & Khan, 2010; Muzaffar et al., 2016), Marathi (Dave et al., 2001; Kulkarni et al., 2013), 
Punjabi (Bhalla, 2014), Bengali (Das, 2013), Hindi-Nepali (Manger, 2014), Telugu (Ithagni, 2014), & 
Sindhi (Nainwani, 2015). 

Dorr (1993) has classified various divergences broadly into two primary categories: syntactic and 
lexical-semantic. Dorr’s classification of divergences is based on the Government and Binding 
framework as proposed and explained by (Chomsky, 1981; Jackendoff, 1990) of linguistic theory which 
attempts at capturing surface structure variations by deep structure. The deep structure provides a 
background as the universal structure which may possibly be applicable to all languages. Therefore, it 
can however be posited that both the classification and resolution of translation divergences are 
explained from the perspective of the universal grammar formalism.  
1.1. The Areal Features of English and Bhojpuri 
Bhojpuri belongs to the Indo-Aryan or Indian language family whereas English owes its origin to the 
Germanic family. There are a lot of incompatible, divergent and linguistically-grounded features 
pertaining to morphology, syntax and semantics (Muzaffar et al., 2016) between English and Bhojpuri.

Like most of the Indo-Aryan languages, Bhojpuri (Ojha et al., 2015; Singh, 2014; Singh, 2015; Singh, 
2015a) is also a morphologically rich and non-configurational language, unlike English. In addition, 
English applies expletives, existential subjects and no verbal honorific agreement. Besides, Bhojpuri as 
a South Asian language has some atypical constructions: complex predicates, serial verb constructions, 
non-nominative subjects, conjunctive participle and so on (Subbārāo, 2008 & 2012).  
2 Dorr’s LCS for Dealing with Divergences 
The Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS)2 is the semantic representation of predicate argument 
structures through decomposition of their features.  
Give: [CAUSE (x, [GO (y, [TO (z)])])] 

In the theoretical specification demonstrated above, the verb ‘give’ can be decomposed as having 
three predicates viz. CAUSE, GO, and TO, as per the intuition that a sentence i.e. ‘Rohit gave Sita a 
pencil’ means that Rohit (which equals to x) caused the pencil (=y) to go to Sita (=z). In other words, 
agent is Rohit, patient is the pencil and the beneficiary is Sita. Hence, the LCS theoretical specification 
can be fit into any natural language having this type of structural specifications. As a result, it becomes 
language independent in nature and the issue of divergences can be addressed applying this concept. 
Divergences can be approached from two points of views: syntax (the syntactic structure) and semantics 
(lexical semantics). 
2.1 The Syntactic Structure 
Constituents in the sentence are grouped on the basis of their relevance and position in the hierarchy. 
The convention applied in the bracketing is based partially on the Government and Binding theory with 
some modifications in notation for simplification of the concepts.  

● CP: it is the complementizer phrase such as ‘that’ in English and ‘kI’ in Hindi which augments 
a subordinate clause in a sentence. 

● IP: it stands for the inflectional phrase which encapsulates the auxiliaries (modal and be verbs) 
in English. 

● Some other notation conventions are nominal phrase (NP or DP), verbal phrase (VP), 
prepositional phrase (PP), adverbial phrase (ADVP), adjectival phrase (ADJP) etc. 

The instance “I came quickly” is considerable here. The structural representation of the given 
sentence syntactically is provided below. 
[CP [IP [NP I]  

[VP [VP [V came] [ADV quickly]] [PP from [NP [DET the] [N market]]]]] 
[CP [IP [NP hama]  

[VP [PP [N bajaare] [PP se]] [VP [ADVP [ADV jaldiya] [PP se]] [V aagailI]]]]] 
In this above instantiated example, [V aagailI] is the syntactic head of the sentence whereas [NP 

hama] is the syntactic subject and [ADV jaldiya] is the adverb which makes an ADVP including an ad-
position [PP se] in Bhojpuri. On the other hand, English sentence contains [V came] as the head of the 
sentence, [NP I] as the subject and [ADV quickly] as the ADVP.  
 

 
                                                
2  For more basics on notation convention please refer to Dorr, 1994; Gupta and Chatterjee, 2003 and Muzaffar et al., 2016

2.2 The Lexical Semantics 
The syntactic constituents are analyzed for providing an intermediate representation in a form known 
as the LCS. The LCS may be acquired with the unification of Root Lexical Conceptual Structure 
(RLCS) of the constituent words in the given sentence. It is a modified and adapted version of the 
representation as proposed by Jackendoff (1983, 1990) which conforms to the following form:  
[T(X') X' ([T(W') W’], [T(Z’1) Z’1]…[T(Z'n) Z’n] [T(Q'1) Q'1]…[T(Q'm) Q'm])]  

In addition, this representation is compositional with decompositional features, language 
independent in nature and provides a theoretical framework for the representation of a sentence with 
the help of semantics. The sentence “I came from the market quickly” is represented in the LCS as the 
following.  
[Event COMELoc   

([Thing I],    
[Path FROMLOC ([Position ATLOC [Thing I] [Location THE MARKET])])]    

[manner QUICKLY])]  
Where COMELoc is the head of LCS, ‘I’ pronominal is the LCS subject, FROMLOC is the LCS 

object, QUICKLY is the LCS modifier. The Root Lexical Conceptual Structure (RLCS) is ‘an 
uninstantiated LCS’ (Dorr, 1994) which is associated with the definition of a word in the lexicon. For 
instance, the RLCS of the verb ‘come’ is as follows.  
[Event COMELoc     

([Thing X],  
[Path FROM/TOLoc ([Position ATLoc ([Thing X], [Thing Z])])])]  

To get a composed (CLCS) we unify RLCSs for ‘come’ and ‘I’. Generalized Linking Routine 
(GLR) correlates the constituent words of the syntactic representations to those of the LCS by the 
mappings as demonstrated in the following. 
❏ V’ ⇔ V ([GOLoc] ⇔ [V came])   
❏ S’ ⇔ S ([RAHIM] ⇔ [NP I])   
❏ O’ ⇔ O ([TOLOC] ⇔ [PP from …])   
❏ M’ ⇔ M ([FAST] ⇔ [ADV quickly])  
Lastly, the lexical-semantic items are related in a systematic manner to their corresponding 

syntactic categories by applying Canonical Syntactic Realization (CSR): For instance: 

LCS Types Syntactic Categories 

Event, State V (verb) 

Thing N (noun) 

Property Adj (adjective) 

Path, Position P (preposition) 

Location, Time, manner, Intensifier and 
Purpose 

ADV (adverbial) 

Table. 1 The LCS Types and Notation Conventions 
3 Categorization of Divergences 
Dorr (1993) has classified various divergences broadly into two primary categories: syntactic and 
lexical-semantic. Furthermore, each of the classes has been sub-categorized and the corresponding 
instances have been drawn as in the following.  
3.1 Syntactic Divergences 
This set of divergences, which are based on the syntax of concerned languages, has been sub-
categorized into seven lower-level types: constituent order, adjunction, preposition-stranding, 
movement, null-subject, dative subject and pleonastic. These are some of the universal parametric 
variations atypical to English as an SL and any natural language as the TL. 

105



3.1.1 Constituent Order 
This divergence pertains to the word-ordering of the concerned SL and TL languages. It emerges when 
there is mismatch between the word order patterns of SL and TL. On one hand, English is a 
configurational language which follows a rigid pattern (SVO) and is unmarked. On the other hand, 
Bhojpuri being an Indic language allows relatively free word order patterns viz. SOV (unmarked), SVO 
and OVS (marked). However, both the types of patterns are acceptable syntactically in Bhojpuri.  
For instance, 
The boys are playing Cricket. 
laikana    krikeTa   khela-taaDana. 
Boys.M.PL.3.NOM       cricket    play.PRS.PL.IPFV.M.   
S O V 
laikana    khela-taaDana   krikeTa. 
Boys.M.PL.3.NOM  play.PRS.PL.IPFV.M. cricket 
S V  O 
krikeTa   khela-taaDana   laikana. 
Cricket  play.PRS.PL.IPFV.M.  Boys.M.PL.3.NOM  
O V  S 
3.1.2 Adjunction 
Adjunction divergence concerns with the difference of mapping in complements (prepositional, non-
finite verbal complements etc.) and adjuncts (prepositional phrases, participial constructions etc.) 
between two languages. In the English input sentence, the infinitival adjunction is translated as 
prepositional complement ‘badanaama kare ke kosIs’ in Bhojpuri. 
He tried to defame me. 
u     hamake  badanaama   kare ke kosIs kailasa 
he.NOM.SG.3.NHON           me.DAT     defame        do    of   try    do.PST.PRF.NHON.3 
He came here after having food. 
u     khaanaa    khaile  ke baada     ihaaN aayal. 
he.NOM.SG.3.NHON              food       eat.PST.PRF.    after          here   come.PST.PRF.NHON.3 
3.1.3 Preposition-stranding 
Preposition-stranding, otherwise called as P-stranding, is one of the syntactic constructions where the 
preposition occurs somewhere in the sentence (generally at the end) other than its canonical position; 
adjacent to its object. This construction is quite alien to most of the South-Asian languages which 
includes Bhojpuri. As a result parametric variation emerges between a pair of languages. 
For instance, 
Where are you coming from? 
kahaaN tu  aava-ta  hauaa  se? 
where You. come.PRS.   be.PROG.PRS.3. from 
3.1.4 Movement  
When we try to move certain constituents in English input sentence, they cannot be moved as freely as 
Bhojpuri. This accounts for the fact that Indian languages are relatively free so far as the process of 
scrambling is concerned. If we shuffle the word order of the following input sentence, it becomes 
grammatically acceptable but semantically not well-formed. Because ‘the book’ semantically cannot 
buy ‘Ram’. In other words, the inanimate object cannot play the role of an animate subject which is 
logical. 
For Example, 
Ram purchased a book. *A book purchased Ram 
raama      ekhe/ekthe kitaaba  kharidalana 

106



Ram.NOM.PST.3.HON     a  book     buy.PST.IPFV.3.HON       
ekhe/ekthe  kitaaba  raama     kharidalana. 
a                    book      Ram.NOM.PST.3.HON              buy.PST.IPFV.3.HON 
3.1.5 Null-subject 
When the position of the subject is either left implicit or attributed by some pronouns such as ‘there’ in 
English it is called a null-subject. When there is a covert subject the agreement features are generally 
marked with the verb when there is S-V agreement. So, in the example mentioned below there is no 
equivalent translation for the existential ‘there’ in Bhojpuri. Consequently, this divergence crops up 
which proves to be a barrier in MT. 
Example, 
There was a lion in the forest. 
jangala  meN  ekhe baagha rahala. 
Forest   in.LOC  a     tiger     be.PST.PRF.3.  
3.1.6 Dative Subject 
This construction is otherwise known as the non-nominative construction which is atypical to South 
Asian languages. The psychological predicates such as ‘hunger’, ‘thirst’ and so on are expressed with 
the addition of a dative subject postpositional marker in Indian languages (here ‘ke’).  
I have fever. 
ham-ke   bokhaara  hava/baa 
I.DAT.SG.1.                fever          be.PRS.1.IPFV 
3.1.7 Pleonastic 
Pleonastic pronoun or dummy pronoun is a pronoun which lacks meaning and is used when the 
argument is irrelevant, non-existent or reduntant. In the input sentence, ‘it’ is considered to be 
impersonal semantically and intransitive syntactically. On the other hand, with the absence of the 
pleonastic subject, ‘water’ becomes the subject of the intransitive verb ‘rain’ /barasata/. 
It is raining. 
paanii  barasata       hava 
water   rain.PRS.PROG   be.PRS. 
3.2 The Lexical-Semantic Divergences 
On the basis of lexical-semantics of the given languages, the lexical-semantic divergences have been 
sub-classified into seven sub-divisions: thematic, promotional, structural, inflational, conflational, 
categorial and lexical.  
3.2.1 Thematic 
This categorization is based on the principle of the thematic roles of the arguments of the verbs. For 
instance the role of the agent (Ham-ke DAT) is realized as the dative subject in Bhojpuri whereas the 
English counterpart has nominative case (I-NOM) marker on the agentive subject and accusative on the 
other argument. As a result owing to the fact that Bhojpuri allows an oblique subject where the object 
gets co-indexed with the verb which is not true so far as English is concerned. 
I had fever. 
ham-ke  bokhaara rahala 
I.DAT.  fever         be.PST. 

107



3.2.2 Promotional 
This divergence occurs when one constituent in a given language having a lower position in the 
hierarchy gets promoted to a higher position in the target language. In this case, the category of adverb 
(‘on’ in English) which has a lower position (modifier of the verb) in the hierarchy gets promoted to 
the higher status of verb (chalata hava) in Bhojpuri counterpart.  
The fan is on. 
pankhaa   chalata    hava. 
Fan         run.PROG         be.PRS 
 

 
3.2.3 Structural 
It occurs when there is difference between languages on the basis of structure or syntax. For instance, 
the nominal phrase argument in English is translated as the prepositional adjunct in the target language. 
This divergence generally originates when there is phrase-level parametric variations which becomes a 
barrier for MT. So, the NP, which is an argument of the verb ‘face’ in English, is translated as an 
adjunctive PP (musIbata kaa saamanaa) in Bhojpuri.   
For instance, 
I face difficulties. 
hamke  musIbata  ka  saamanaa  kare(ke)   paDala. 
I.DAT difficulty   of   face          do           have.PST.PRF. 
 

 
 

3.2.4 Inflational & Conflational 
On one hand, when on linguistic element in SL is inflated as the realization of more than one element 
in the TL it is called as the inflational divergence. On the other hand, when two or more linguistic 
elements in SL are conflated to be realized as one word in TL it is known as conflational divergence. 
In the inflational example below, the SL ‘suggested’ gets realized in the TL as having two elements 
‘salaaha dehalana’. In the conflational instance, phrasal verb “looked for’ gets translated in Bhojpuri as 
having only one word i.e. ‘khojalasa’.  
He suggested me on this matter. 
 
 

108



u      hamake  I  maamalaa  meN  salaaha   dehalana. 
he.NOM.3   me.DAT.OBJ. this matter   in.OBL  advise   give.PST.PRF.3 
 
He looked for a room. 
u   ekhe  makaana  khojalasa  
he.NOM.3 a         house  search.PST.PRF.3 
 

 
 

3.2.5 Categorial 
When there is a change in the very grammatical category of a linguistic element in TL it is known as 
the categorial divergence. In the example instantiated below the predicative adjective ‘hungry’ in 
English gets translated as the nominal phrase in Bhojpuri. Thus there is a change in the parts of speech 
categories from adjective to noun.  
I am hungry. 
ham-ke       bhukha  lagala          hava 
I.DAT.3       hunger  seem.PRF   be.PRS. 
 

 
 
3.2.6 Lexical 
This divergence occurs when two or more divergence types combine or because of the unavailability 
of the exact equivalent translation. Thus, in the following example, there is no equivalent translation 
for the expression ‘see you’ in Indian languages like Bhojpuri. There is fair amount of lexical 
divergences between a pair of languages that are responsible for creating divergence issues in MT.  
See you!

4 The Identification and Resolution Procedure 
This section provides the systematic method for the identification and probable solution of the lexical-
semantic divergences between English and Bhojpuri. 
4.1 Thematic 
This divergence emerges when the GLR invokes the following steps of relation (Dorr, 1990a). 
Firstly, one needs to relate the syntactic object with the LCS subject ⇒ O′⇔ S  
Secondly, one needs to have the relation between the syntactic subject to the LCS object ⇒ S′⇔ O 
The syntactic structure and the corresponding CLCS are provided in the following.  

[CP [IP [NP I] [VP [V had] [N fever]]]] 
⇔ [State BEIIdent ([Thing I],   

[Position ATIdent ([Thing I], [Thing FEVER])],    
 [manner SEVERELY])]  

⇔ [CP [IP [NP Ham-ke] [VP [N bokhaara] [V rahala]]]] 
In the above instantiated example, the subject gets the thematic roles of a nominative agentive 

subject in English and concedes the role of impersonal and non-agentive subject with dative case 
marker. 
4.2 Promotional 
In this divergence the GLR augments in the following manner.  
On needs to consider the following steps: 

1. One needs to relate the LCS verb with the syntactic object ⇒ V′⇔ S 
2. Promote the LCS modifier (adverb) position to the position of verb ⇒ M′⇔ V 

The syntactic structure and the respective CLCS are demonstrated below. 
[CP [IP [NP [DET The] [N fan]] [VP [V is] [ADV on]]]] 

   ⇔ [State BEIIdent ([Thing THE FAN],   
[Position ATIdent ([Thing THE FAN],    

 [manner OFF])]  
⇔ [CP [IP [NP pankhaa] [VP [V chalata] [AUX hava]]]] 

 
4.3 Structural 
This divergence is quite different from the above two types of divergences in so far as the alternation 
of the position of the constituents is concerned. But it changes the nature of the relation between various 
positions. 
The syntactic structure and CLCS are provided below. 
 
 

110



[CP [IP [NP I] [VP [V face] [N difficulties]]]] 
⇔ [Event GOLoc   

([Thing I],      
[Path TOLoc (Position INLoc ([Thing I], [Thing DIFFICULTIES])])])] 

⇔ [CP [IP [NP ham-ke] [VP [NP [N musIbata] [NP [GEN kaa] [N saamanaa]]] [VP 
[V kare] [AUX paDala]]]]] 

One of the arguments of the verb in English is translated as the prepositional phrase in Bhojpuri 
which creates complexity for automatic translation. 
4.4 Inflational & Conflational 
In the bracketing representation demonstrated following, it is quite obvious that the one-word token 
verbal element i.e. ‘suggested’ is translated as having two tokens i.e. “salaaha dehalana” in Bhojpuri 
and is a quintessential example of inflational divergence. It is completely based on the economy of 
usage of strings in both the concerned languages. When the economically inflated expressions in the 
SL are reduced to a conflated expression in the TL counterpart, it is called as conflational divergence. 
The syntactic structure and the CLCS are demonstrated in the following. 
[CP [IP [NP He] [VP [VP [V suggested] [PRP me]] [PP [Prep on] [NP [DET this] matter]]]]] 

⇔ [Event GOLoc   
([Thing HE],      

[Path TOLoc (Position INLoc ([Thing HE], [Thing ME], ([Thing THE 
MATTER])])])])] 

⇔ [CP [IP [NP U] [VP [NP [N hamke] [PP [NP [DET I] [N maamalaa]] [Prep meN]]] 
[VP [NN salaaha] [V dehalana]]]]] 

4.5 Categorial 
In this divergence, there is no identicality in the relationship between the syntactic category and the 
concerned lexical-semantic item.  
[CP [IP [NP I] [VP [V am] [JJ hungry]]]] 

⇔ [State BEIIdent   
([Thing I],[Position ATIdent ([Thing I], [property HUNGRY])] 

⇔ [CP [IP [NP Ham-ke] [VP [NP bhukha] [VP [V lagala] [AUX hava]]]]] 
In the examples mentioned above the divergence owes to the fact that adjectival parts of speech category 
in English is translated into a nominal category in Bhojpuri counterpart. 
4.6 Lexical 
This divergence is considered to be one of the by-products of any of the above-described combination 
of divergences. In addition, the unavailability of the proper translation in the target language is also 
encapsulated in this category.  
[CP [IP [VP See] [NP [you]]]] 
[CP [IP [VP [ADV Phira] [VP [V milala] [AUX [jaayIM]]]]]] 
5 Conclusion 
The successful implementation of any MT platform solely depends upon how well an instance of 
translation is retrieved from a plethora of data and modified to cater to the demand of the desired 
translation output. Although the heuristic linguistic rules are capable of dealing with several errors but 
are not sufficient for tackling the exceptional cases of linguistic divergences (Gupta & Chatterjee, 
2003). Therefore, our rationale for dealing with the divergence patterns between English and Bhojpuri 
language pair is to bring out various types of divergent, incompatible or incongruent features.  

In this study, we have focused light on classifying various divergences between English and 
Bhojpuri translations. The theoretical framework for classification is based on Dorr’s classification of 
divergences from syntactic and lexical-semantic points of views. So far as the identification and 
resolution are concerned, we have adhered to the LCS schema. This analytical study on divergence 

111



between English and Bhojpuri language pair can prove to be fruitful for any IA language in general and 
less-resourced languages in particular to develop efficient and qualitative Machine Translation 
platforms.
