Abstract

A significant number of neural architec-
tures for reading comprehension have re-
cently been developed and evaluated on
large cloze-style datasets. We present
experiments supporting the emergence of
“predication structure” in the hidden state
vectors of these readers. More specifi-
cally, we provide evidence that the hid-
den state vectors represent atomic formu-
las Φ[c] where Φ is a semantic property
(predicate) and c is a constant symbol en-
tity identifier.

1 Introduction

Reading comprehension is a type of question an-
swering task where the answer is to be found
in a passage about particular entities and events.
In particular, the entities and events should not
be mentioned in structured databases of general
knowledge. Reading comprehension problems are
intended to measure a system’s ability to extract
semantic information about entities and relations
directly from unstructured text.

Several large scale reading comprehension
datasets have been introduced recently, includ-
ing the CNN & Daily Mail datasets (Hermann
et al., 2015), the Children’s Book Test (CBT) (Hill
et al., 2016), and the Who-did-What dataset (On-
ishi et al., 2016). The large sizes of these datasets
enable the application of deep learning. These are
all cloze-style datasets where a question is con-
structed by deleting a word or phrase from an ar-
ticle summary (in CNN/Daily Mail), from a sen-
tence in a children’s story (in CBT), or by deleting
a person from the first sentence of a different news
article on the same entities and events (in Who-
did-What).

∗Authors contributed equally.

In this paper we present empirical evidence for
the emergence of predication structure in a certain
class of neural readers. To understand predication
structure, it is helpful to review the anonymization
performed in the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. In this
dataset named entities are replaced by anonymous
entity identifiers such as “entity37”. The passage
might contain “entity52 gave entity24 a rousing
applause” and the question might be “X received
a rounding applause from entity52”. The task is to
fill in X from a given multiple choice list of can-
didate entity identifiers. A fixed relatively small
set of the same entity identifiers are used over all
the problems and the same problem is presented
many times with different entity identifiers shuf-
fled. This prevents a given entity identifier from
having any semantically meaningful vector em-
bedding. The embeddings of the entity identifiers
are presumably just pointers to semantics-free to-
kens. We will write entity identifiers as logical
constant symbols such as c rather than strings such
as “entity37”.

“Aggregation” readers, including Memory Net-
works (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al.,
2015), the Attentive Reader (Hermann et al.,
2015), and the Stanford Reader (Chen et al.,
2016), use bidirectional LSTMs or GRUs to con-
struct a contextual embedding ht of each position
t in the passage and also an embedding hq of the
question q. They then select an answer c using a
criterion similar to

argmax
c

∑
t

< ht, hq > < ht, e(c) > (1)

where e(c) is the vector embedding of the constant
symbol (entity identifier) c. In practice the inner-
product < ht, hq > is normalized over t using a
softmax to yield attention weights αt over t and

26



(1) becomes

argmax
c

< e(c),
∑
t

αtht > . (2)

Here
∑

t αtht can be viewed as a vector represen-
tation of the passage.

We argue that for aggregation readers, roughly
defined by (2), the hidden state ht of the passage
at position (or word) t can be viewed as a vector
concatenation ht = [s(Φt), s(ct)] where Φt is a
property (or statement or predicate) being stated
of a particular constant symbol ct. Here s(Φt) and
s(ct) are unknown emergent embeddings of Φt
and ct respectively. A logician might write this as
ht = Φt[ct]. Furthermore, the question can be in-
terpreted as having the form Ψ[x] where the prob-
lem is to find a constant symbol c such that the pas-
sage implies Ψ[c]. Assuming ht = [s(Φt), s(ct)],
hq = [s(Ψ), 0], and e(c) = [0, s(c)], we can
rewrite (1) as

argmax
c

∑
t

< s(Φt), s(Ψ) > < s(ct), s(c) > .

(3)
The first inner product in (3) is interpreted as mea-
suring the extent to which Φt[x] implies Ψ[x] for
any x. The second inner product is interpreted as
restricting t to positions talking about the constant
symbol c.

Note that the posited decomposition of ht is
not explicit in (2) but instead must emerge during
training. We present empirical evidence that this
structure does emerge. The empirical evidence is
somewhat tricky as the direct sum structure that di-
vides ht into its two parts need not be axis aligned
and therefore need not literally correspond to vec-
tor concatenation.

We also consider a second class of neural read-
ers that we call “explicit reference” readers. Ex-
plicit reference readers avoid (2) and instead use

argmax
c

∑
t∈R(c)

αt (4)

whereR(c) is the subset of the positions where the
constant symbol (entity identifier) c occurs. Note
that if we identify αt with < s(Φt), s(Ψ) > and
assume that < s(c), s(ct) > is either 0 or 1 de-
pending on whether c = ct, then (3) and (4) agree.
In explicit reference readers the hidden state ht
need not carry a pointer to ct as the restriction on
t is independent of learned representations. Ex-
plicit reference readers include the Attention Sum

Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016), the Gated Attention
Reader (Dhingra et al., 2017), and the Attention-
over-Attention Reader (Cui et al., 2017).

So far we have only considered anonymized
datasets that require the handling of semantics-
free constant symbols. However, even for non-
anonymized datasets such as Who-did-What, it is
helpful to add features which indicate which posi-
tions in the passage are referring to which candi-
date answers. This indicates, not surprisingly, that
reference is important in question answering. The
fact that explicit reference features are needed in
aggregation readers on non-anonymized data in-
dicates that reference is not being solved by the
aggregation readers. However, as reference seems
to be important for cloze-style question answer-
ing, these problems may ultimately provide train-
ing data from which reference resolution can be
learned.

Sections 2 and 3 review various existing
datasets and models respectively. In the CNN
dataset the vector embeddings of entity identi-
fiers such as “entity32” are clearly interpretable as
vector representations of semantics-free constant
symbols. However, to the best of our knowledge
the emergent decomposition of the hidden state
vectors into a concatenation of a property vector
and an entity vector has not been previously de-
scribed or empirically investigated in the litera-
ture. Section 4 presents the logical structure in-
terpretation of aggregation readers in more detail
and the empirical evidence supporting it. Section 5
proposes new models that enforce the direct sum
structure of the hidden state vectors. It is shown
that these new models perform well on the Who-
did-What dataset provided that reference annota-
tions are added as input features. Section 5 also
describes additional linguistic features that can be
added to the input embeddings and show that these
improve the performance of existing models re-
sulting in the best single-model performance to
date on the Who-did-What dataset.

2 A Brief Survey of Datasets

Before presenting various models for machine
comprehension we give a general formulation of
the machine comprehension task. We take an in-
stance of the task to be a four tuple (q, p, a,A),
where q is a question given as a sequence of words
containing a special token for a “blank” to be filled
in, p is a document consisting of a sequence of

27



words, A is a set of possible answers and a ∈ A
is the ground truth answer. All words are drawn
from a vocabulary V . We assume that all possi-
ble answers are words from the vocabulary, that is
A ⊆ V , and that the ground truth answer appears
in the document, that is a ∈ p. The problem can
be described as that of selecting the answer a ∈ A
that answers question q based on information from
p. We now briefly summarize important features
of the related datasets in reading comprehension.

CNN & Daily Mail: Hermann et al. (2015)
constructed these datasets from a large number of
news articles from the CNN and Daily Mail news
websites. The main article is used as the con-
text, while the cloze style question is formed from
one short article summary sentence appearing in
conjunction with the published article. To avoid
the model using external world knowledge when
answering the question, the named entities in the
entire dataset were replaced by anonymous entity
IDs which were then further shuffled for each ex-
ample. This forces models to rely on the con-
text document to answer each question. In this
anonymized corpus the entity identifiers are taken
to be a part of the vocabulary and the answer set
A consists of the entity identifiers occurring in the
passage.

Who-did-What (WDW): The Who-did-What
dataset (Onishi et al., 2016) contains 127,000 mul-
tiple choice cloze questions constructed from the
LDC English Gigaword newswire corpus (David
and Cieri, 2003). In contrast with CNN and
Daily Mail, WDW avoids using article summaries
for question formation. Instead, each problem
is formed from two independent articles: one is
given as the passage to be read and a different arti-
cle on the same entities and events is used to form
the question. Further, WDW avoids anonymiza-
tion — each choice is a person named entity. In
this dataset the answer set A consists of the per-
son named entities occurring in the passage. Fi-
nally, the problems have been filtered to remove
a fraction that are easily solved by simple base-
lines. It has two training sets. The larger training
set (“relaxed”) is created using less baseline filter-
ing, while the smaller training set (“strict”) uses
the same filtering as the validation and test sets.

Other Related Datasets. It is also worth men-
tioning several related datasets. The MCTest
dataset (Richardson et al., 2013) consists of chil-
dren’s stories and questions written by crowd-

sourced workers. The dataset only contains 660
documents and is too small to train deep mod-
els. The bAbI dataset (Weston et al., 2016)
is constructed automatically using synthetic text
generation and can be perfectly answered by
hand-written algorithms (Lee et al., 2016). The
SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) consists
of passage-question pairs where the passage is a
Wikipedia article and the questions are written via
crowdsourcing. The dataset contains over 100,000
problems, but the answer is often a word sequence
which is difficult to handle with the reader mod-
els considered here. The Children’s Book Test
(CBT) (Hill et al., 2016) takes any sequence of
21 consecutive sentences from a children’s book:
the first 20 sentences are used as the passage, and
the goal is to infer a missing word in the 21st sen-
tence. The task complexity varies with the type of
the omitted word (verb, preposition, named entity,
or common noun). The LAMBADA dataset (Pa-
perno et al., 2016) is a word prediction dataset
which requires a broad discourse context, though
the correct answer might not actually be contained
in the context. Nevertheless, when the correct an-
swer is in the context, neural readers can be ap-
plied effectively (Chu et al., 2017).

3 Aggregation Readers and Explicit
Reference Readers

As outlined in the introduction, here we clas-
sify readers into aggregation readers and ex-
plicit reference readers. Aggregation readers ap-
peared first in the literature and include Mem-
ory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar
et al., 2015), the Attentive Reader (Hermann
et al., 2015), and the Stanford Reader (Chen
et al., 2016). In this section we define ag-
gregation readers more specifically by equations
(7) and (9) below. Explicit reference read-
ers include the Attention-Sum Reader (Kadlec
et al., 2016), the Gated-Attention Reader (Dhin-
gra et al., 2017), and the Attention-over-Attention
Reader (Cui et al., 2017). In this section we de-
fine explicit reference readers more specifically by
equation (13) below. We first present the Stanford
Reader as a paradigmatic aggregation reader and
the Attention-Sum Reader as a paradigmatic ex-
plicit reference reader.

28



3.1 Aggregation Readers
Stanford Reader. The Stanford Reader (Chen
et al., 2016) computes a bidirectional LSTM rep-
resentation of both the passage and the question.

h = biLSTM(e(p)) (5)
hq = [fLSTM(e(q))|q|, bLSTM(e(q))1] (6)

In equations (5) and (6) we have that e(p) is the
sequence of word embeddings e(wi) for wi ∈ p
and similarly for e(q). The expression biLSTM(s)
denotes the sequence of hidden state vectors re-
sulting from running a bidirectional LSTM on the
vector sequence s. We write biLSTM(s)i for the
ith vector in this sequence. Similarly fLSTM(s)
and bLSTM(s) denote the sequence of vectors re-
sulting from running a forward LSTM and a back-
ward LSTM respectively and [·, ·] denotes vector
concatenation. The Stanford Reader, and various
other readers, then compute a bilinear attention
over the passage which is used to construct a sin-
gle weighted vector representation of the passage.

αt = softmax
t

h>t Wα hq o =
∑
t

αtht (7)

Finally, they compute a probability distribution P
over the answers:

P (·|d, q,A) = softmax
a∈A

eo(a)>o (8)

â = argmax
a∈A

eo(a)>o (9)

Here eo(a) is the “output embedding” of the an-
swer a. On the CNN dataset the Stanford Reader
trains an output embedding for each of the roughly
550 entity identifiers used in the dataset. For
datasets in which the answer might be any word
in V , output embeddings must be trained for the
entire vocabulary.

The reader is trained with log-loss
− logP (a|p, q,A) where a is the correct an-
swer. At test time the reader is scored on the
percentage of problems where â = a.

Memory Networks. Memory Networks (We-
ston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) use
(7) and (9) but have more elaborate methods of
constructing “memory vectors” ht not involving
LSTMs. Memory networks use (7) and (9) but re-
place (8) with

P (·|p, q,A) = P (·|p, q) = softmax
w∈V

eo(w)>o.

(10)

It should be noted that (10) trains output vectors
over the whole vocabulary rather than just those
items occurring in the choice setA. This is empir-
ically significant in non-anonymized datasets such
as CBT and Who-did-What where choices at test
time may never have occurred as choices in the
training data.

Attentive Reader. The Stanford Reader was
derived from the Attentive Reader (Hermann
et al., 2015). The Attentive Reader uses αt =
softmaxt MLP([ht, hq]) instead of (7). Here
MLP(x) is the output of a multi layer perceptron
given input x. Also, the answer distribution in the
Attentive Reader is defined over the full vocabu-
lary rather than just the candidate answer set A:

P (·|p, q,A) = softmax
w∈V

eo(w)>MLP([o, hq])

(11)
Equation (11) is similar to (10) in that it leads
to the training of output vectors for the full vo-
cabulary rather than just those items appearing in
choice sets in the training data. As in memory net-
works, this leads to improved performance on non-
anonymized datasets.

3.2 Explicit Reference Readers
Attention-Sum Reader. In the Attention-Sum
Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016), h and q are com-
puted with equations (5) and (6) as in the Stanford
Reader but using GRUs rather than LSTMs. The
attention αt is computed similarly to (7) but us-
ing a simple inner product αt = softmaxt h>t hq
rather than a trained bilinear form. Most signifi-
cantly, however, equations (8) and (9) are replaced
by the following where t ∈ R(a, p) indicates that a
reference to candidate answer a occurs at position
t in p.

P (a|p, q,A) =
∑

t∈R(a,p)
αt (12)

â = argmax
a

∑
t∈R(a,p)

αt (13)

Here we think of R(a, p) as the set of references
to a in the passage p. It is important to note that
(12) is an equality and that P (a|p, q,A) is not nor-
malized to the members ofR(a, p). When training
with the log-loss objective this drives the attention
αt to be normalized — to have support only on the
positions t with t ∈ R(a, p) for some a. See the
heat maps in the supplementary material.

29



Gated-Attention Reader. The Gated-Attention
Reader (Dhingra et al., 2017) involves a K-layer
biGRU architecture defined by the following equa-
tions.

h`q = [fGRU(e(q))|q|, bGRU(e(q))1] 1 ≤ ` ≤ K
h1 = biGRU(e(p))

h` = biGRU(h`−1 � h`−1q ) 2 ≤ ` ≤ K

Here the question embeddings h`q for different val-
ues of ` are computed with different GRU model
parameters. Here h� hq abbreviates the sequence
h1�hq, h2�hq, . . . h|p|�hq. Note that forK = 1
we have only h1q and h

1 as in the attention-sum
reader. An attention is then computed over the fi-
nal layer hK with αt = softmaxt (hKt )

> hKq in
the Attention-Sum Reader. This reader uses (12)
and (13).

Attention-over-Attention Reader. The
Attention-over-Attention Reader (Cui et al., 2017)
uses a more elaborate method to compute the
attention αt. We will use t to range over positions
in the passage and j to range over positions in
the question. The model is then defined by the
following equations.

h = biGRU(e(p)) hq = biGRU(e(q))

αt,j = softmaxt h>t hq,j βt,j = softmaxj h>t hq,j

βj = 1|p|
∑

t βt,j αt =
∑

j βjαt,j

Note that the final equation defining αt can be in-
terpreted as applying the attention βj to the atten-
tions αt,j . This reader uses (12) and (13).

4 Emergent Predication Structure

As discussed in the introduction the entity iden-
tifiers such as “entity37” introduced in the
CNN/Daily Mail datasets cannot be assigned any
semantics other than their identity. We should
think of them as pointers or semantics-free con-
stant symbols. Despite this undermining of se-
mantics, aggregation readers using (7) and (9) are
able to perform well. Here we posit that this is
due to an emergent predication structure in the
hidden vectors ht. Intuitively we want to think
of the hidden state vector ht as a concatenation
[s(Φt), s(at)] where Φt is a property being as-
serted of entity at at the positon t in the passage.
Here s(Φt) and s(at) are emergent embeddings of
the property and entity respectively, We also think

of the vector representation q of the question as
having the form [s(Ψ), 0] and the vector embed-
ding eo(a) as having the form [0, s(a)].

Unfortunately, the decomposition of ht into this
predication structure need not be axis aligned.
Rather than posit an axis-aligned concatenation
we posit that the hidden vector space H is a possi-
bly non-aligned direct sum

H = S ⊕ E (14)

where S is a subspace of “statement vectors” and
E is an orthogonal subspace of “entity pointers”.
Each hidden state vector h ∈ H then has a unique
decomposition as h = Ψ+e for Ψ ∈ S and e ∈ E.
This is equivalent to saying that the hidden vector
space H is some rotation of a concatenation of the
vector spaces S and E. In this non-axis aligned
model we also assume emergent embeddings s(Φ)
and s(a) with s(Φ) ∈ S and s(a) ∈ E. We will
also assume that the latent spaces are learned in
such a way that explicit entity output embeddings
satisfy eo(a) ∈ E.

We now present empirical evidence for this
decomposition structure. This structure implies
eo(a)>ht equals eo(a)>s(at). This suggests the
following for some fixed positive constant c.

eo(a)>ht =
{
c if t ∈ R(a, p)
0 otherwise

(15)

We note that if eo(a)>s(a) was different for dif-
ferent constant a then answers would be biased
toward constant symbols where this product was
larger. But we need to have that all constant sym-
bols are equivalent. We note that (15) gives

argmax

eo(a)>o = argmax

∑
t

αtht

= argmax
a

∑
t

αt eo(a)>ht = argmax
a

∑
t∈R(a,p)

αt

and hence (9) and (13) agree — the aggregation
readers and the explicit reference readers are using
essentially the same answer selection criterion.

Empirical evidence for (15) is given in the first
three rows of Table 1. The first row empiri-
cally measures the constant c in (15) by measur-
ing e0(a)>ht for those cases where t ∈ R(a, p).
The second row measures “0” in (15) by measur-
ing eo(a)>ht in those cases where t 6∈ R(a, p).
The third row shows that this inner product falls
off significantly just one word before or after the

position of the answer word. Additional evidence
for (15) is given in Figure 1 showing that the out-
put vectors eo(a) for different entity identifiers a
are nearly orthogonal. Orthogonality of the output
vectors is required by (15) provided that each out-
put vector eo(a) is in the span of the hidden state
vectors ht,p for which t ∈ R(a, p). Intuitively, the
mean of all vectors ht,p with t ∈ R(a, p) should
be approximately equal to eo(a). Empirically this
will only be approximately true.

Equation (15) would suggest that the vector em-
bedding of the constant symbols should have di-
mension at least as large as the number of distinct
constants. However, in practice it is sufficient that
e0(a)>s(a′) is small for a 6= a′. This allows the
vector embeddings of the constants to have dimen-
sion much smaller than the number of constants.
We have experimented with two-sparse constant
symbol embeddings where the number of embed-
ding vectors in dimension d is 2d(d−1) (d choose
2 times the four ways of setting the signs of the
non-zero coordinates). Although we do not report
results here, these designed and untrained constant
embeddings worked reasonably well.

As further support for (15) we give heat maps
for eo(a)>ht for different identifiers a and heat
maps for αt for different readers in the supplemen-
tary material.

As another testable predication we note that the
posited decomposition of the hidden state vectors
implies

h>q (hi + eo(a)) = h
>
q hi. (16)

This equation is equivalent to h>q eo(a) = 0. Ex-
perimentally, however, we cannot expect h>q eo(a)
to be exactly zero and (16) seems to provides a
more experimentally meaningful test. Empirical
evidence for (16) is given in the fourth and fifth
rows of Table 1. The fourth row measures the

hq and the hidden state ht averaged over passage
positions t at which some entity identifier occurs.
The fifth row measures the cosine of the angle be-
tween hq and eo(a) averaged over the entity iden-
tifiers a.

A question asks for a value of x such that a
statement Ψ[x] is implied by the passage. For a
question Ψ we might even suggest the following
vectorial interpretation of entailment.

Φ[x] implies Ψ[x] iff Φ>Ψ ≥ ||Ψ||1.

This interpretation is exactly correct if some of the
dimensions of the vector space correspond to pred-
icates, Ψ is a 0-1 vector representing a conjunction
predicates, and Φ is also 0-1 on these dimensions
indicating whether a predicate is implied by the
context. Of course in practice one expects the di-
mension to be smaller than the number of possible
predicates.

5 Pointer Annotation Readers

It is of course important to note that
anonymization provides reference information—
anonymization assumes that one can determine
coreference so as to replace coreferent phrases
with the same entity identifier. Anonymization
allows the reference set R(a, p) to be directly
read off of the passage. Still, an aggregation
reader must learn to recover this explicit reference
structure.

Aggregation readers can have difficulty when
anonymization is not done. The Stanford Reader
achieves just better than 45% on the Who-did-
What dataset while the Attention-Sum Reader can
get near 60% (see Table 2). But if we anonymize
the Who-did-What dataset and then re-train the
Stanford Reader, the accuracy jumps to near 65%.
Anonymization greatly reduces the number of out-
put word embeddings eo(a) to be learned. We
need to learn only output embeddings for the rel-
atively small number of entity identifiers needed
for the question. Anonymization suppresses the
semantics of the reference phrases and leaves only
a semantics-free entity identifier. This suppres-
sion of semantics may facilitate the separation of
the hidden state vector space H into a direct sum
S ⊕ E with s(Φ) ∈ S and eo(a), s(a) ∈ E.

A third, and perhaps more important effect of
anonymization is to provide reference informa-
tion. Anonymization explicitly marks positions of
candidate answers and establishes coreference. A
natural question is whether this information can
be provided without anonymization by simply
adding additional coreference features to the
input. Here we evaluate two architectures inspired
by this question. This evaluation is done on the
Who-did-What dataset which is not anonymized.
In each architecture we add features to the input to
mark the occurrences of candidate answers. These
models are simpler than the Stanford Reader but
perform comparably. This comparable perfor-
mance in Table 2 further supports our analysis of
logical structure in aggregation readers.

One-Hot Pointer Reader: The Stanford Reader
uses input embeddings of words and output em-
beddings of entity identifiers. In the Who-did-
What dataset each problem has at most five
choices in the multiple choice answer list. This
means that we need only five entity identifiers and
we can use a five dimensional one-hot vector rep-

resentation for answer identifiers.
If an answer choice exists at position t in the

passage let it be the index of that choice on the
answer choice list. If no answer choice occurs at
position t we let it be zero. We define e′(i) to
be the zero vector if i = 0 and otherwise to be the
one-hot vector for i (i.e., the five-dimensional vec-
tor with zeroes at all positions except with a one at
position i). We define “pointer annotation” to be
the result of concatenating e′(it) as additional fea-
tures to the word embedding e(wt) for token wt in
the passage:

ē(wt) = [e(wt), e′(it)] (17)

We feed the new ē(wt) to the readers for each to-
ken wt. We define a “one-hot pointer reader” by
designating the last five dimensions of the hidden
state as indicators of the answer and take the prob-
ability of choice i to be defined as

p(i|d, q) = softmax
i∈A

oi (18)

where o is computed by (7) and oi is the ith-to-last
dimension of vector o. Table 2 shows results using
this reader, showing performance comparable to
the Stanford Reader with anonymization.

General Pointer Reader: In the CNN dataset
there are roughly 550 entity identifiers and a one-
hot representation may not be desirable because it
would enlarge the embedding space too much. In-
stead we can let e′(i) be a fixed set of “pointer
vectors”—vectors distributed widely on the unit
sphere so that for i 6= j we have that e′(i)>e′(j) is
small. We again use (17) but replace (18) with

p(i|d, q) = softmax
i

[0, e′(i)]>o (19)

where “0” stands for a sufficient number of zeroes
in order to make the dimensions match. We re-
fer to this as a “general pointer reader”. In this
reader, the pointer embeddings e′(i) are held fixed
and not trained. Even though not shown here, in
preliminary experiments, this reader yield similar
performance to the one hot pointer reader while
permitting smaller embedding dimensionality.
Linguistic Features: Each model can be modified
to include additional input features for each input
token in the question and passage. More specifi-
cally we can add the following features to the word
embeddings: whether the current token occurs in
the question; the frequency of the current token in

32



the passage; the position of the token’s first occur-
rence in the passage as a percentage of the passage
length; and whether the text surrounding the to-
ken matches the text surrounding the placeholder
in the question. More details of the experimental
setup are provided in the appendix.

Table 2 shows results when adding these fea-
tures to the Gated-Attention Reader, Stanford
Reader, and One-Hot Pointer Reader, showing
large improvements to all readers and leading to
the best single-model performance reported to-
date on the Who-did-What dataset.

6 Discussion

Explicit reference architectures rely on reference
resolution—a specification of which phrases in the
given passage refer to candidate answers. Our ex-
periments indicate that all existing readers bene-
fit greatly from this externally provided informa-
tion. Aggregation readers seem to demonstrate
a stronger learning ability in that they essentially
learn to mimic explicit reference readers by iden-
tifying reference annotation and using it appro-
priately. This is done most clearly in the pointer
reader architectures. Furthermore, we have ar-
gued for, and given experimental evidence for,
an interpretation of aggregation readers as learn-
ing emergent predication structure—a factoring of
neural representations into a direct sum of a state-
ment (predicate) representation and an entity (ar-
gument) representation.

At a very high level our analysis and experi-
ments support a central role for reference resolu-
tion in reading comprehension. Automating refer-
ence resolution in neural models, and demonstrat-
ing its value on appropriate datasets, would seem
to be an important area for future research.

There is great interest in learning representa-
tions for natural language understanding. The cur-
rent state of the art in reading comprehension is
such that systems still benefit from externally pro-
vided linguistic features including externally an-
notated reference resolution. It would be interest-
ing to develop fully automated neural readers that
perform as well as readers using externally pro-
vided annotations.

A Supplemental Material

A.1 Experiment Details
We implemented the neural readers using
Theano (Bastien et al., 2012) and Blocks (van
Merrienboer et al., 2015) and train them on
a single NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU. Negative
log-likelihood is employed as training criterion.
We used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with
the Adam update rule (Kingma and Ba, 2015) and
set the learning rate to 0.0005.

For the Stanford Reader and One-Hot Pointer
Reader, we use the Stanford Reader’s default set-
tings. For the Gated-Attention reader, the lookup
table was initialized using pre-trained GloVe (Jef-
frey et al., 2014) vectors.1 Input to hidden state
weights were initialized by random orthogonal
matrices (Saxe et al., 2013) and biases were ini-
tialized to zero. Hidden to hidden state weights
were initialized by identity matrices to force the
model to remember longer information. To com-
pute the attention weight, we use αt = h>t Wαhq
and initialize Wα with random uniform distribu-
tion. We also use gradient clipping (Razvan et al.,
2013) with a threshold of 10 and mini-batches of
size 32.

During training we randomly shuffle all exam-
ples within each epoch. To speed up training,
we always pre-fetch 10 batches worth of exam-
ples and sort them according to document length
as done by Kadlec et al. (2016). When using
anonymization, we randomly reshuffle the entity
identifier to match the procedure proposed by Her-
mann et al. (2015).

During training we evaluate the accuracy after
each epoch and stop training when the accuracy
on the validation set starts decreasing. We tried
limiting the vocabulary to the most frequent tokens
but did not observe any performance improvement
compared with using all distinct tokens as the vo-
cabulary. Since part of our experiments need to
check word embedding assignment issues, we fi-
nally use all the distinct tokens as vocabulary. To
find the optimal embedding and hidden state di-
mension, we tried several groups of different com-
binations, and the optimal values were 200 and
384, respectively.

When anonymizing the Who-did-What dataset,
we can either use simple string matching to re-
place answers in the question and passage with en-

1http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.
6B.zip

tity identifiers, or we can use the Stanford named
entity recognizer (NER)2 to detect named entities
and replace the answer named entities in the ques-
tion and passage with entity identifiers. We found
the latter to bring 2% improvement compared with
simple string matching.

A.2 Heat Maps for Stanford Reader for
Different Answer Candidates

We randomly choose one article from the CNN
dataset and show softmax(eo(a)>ht) for t ∈
[0, |p|] for each answer candidate a in Figures 2-6.
Red color indicates larger probability and orange
indicates smaller probability and the remaining in-
dicates very low probability that can be ignored.
From these figures, we can see that our assump-
tion that eo(a) is used to pick up its occurrence is
reasonable.
