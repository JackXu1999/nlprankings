Abstract

Emotion lexicons play a crucial role in sen-
timent analysis and opinion mining. In this
paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware
LDA (EaLDA) model to build a domain-
specific lexicon for predefined emotions
that include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sad-
ness, surprise. The model uses a mini-
mal set of domain-independent seed words
as prior knowledge to discover a domain-
specific lexicon, learning a fine-grained
emotion lexicon much richer and adap-
tive to a specific domain. By comprehen-
sive experiments, we show that our model
can generate a high-quality fine-grained
domain-specific emotion lexicon.

1 Introduction

Due to the popularity of opinion-rich resources
(e.g., online review sites, forums, blogs and the
microblogging websites), automatic extraction of
opinions, emotions and sentiments in text is of
great significance to obtain useful information for
social and security studies. Various opinion min-
ing applications have been proposed by different
researchers, such as question answering, opinion
mining, sentiment summarization, etc. As the fine-
grained annotated data are expensive to get, the un-
supervised approaches are preferred andmore used
in reality. Usually, a high quality emotion lexi-
con play a significant role when apply the unsuper-
vised approaches for fine-grained emotion classi-
fication.

Thus far, most lexicon construction approaches
focus on constructing general-purpose emotion
lexicons (Stone et al., 1966; Hu and Liu, 2004;
Wilson et al., 2005; Dong and Dong, 2006). How-
ever, since a specific word can carry various emo-
tions in different domains, a general-purpose emo-
tion lexicon is less accurate and less informative
than a domain-specific lexicon (Baccianella et al.,
2010). In addition, in previous work, most of the
lexicons label the words on coarse-grained dimen-
sions (positive, negative and neutrality). Such lex-
icons cannot accurately reflect the complexity of
human emotions and sentiments. Lastly, previous
emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on
many manually constructed resources (e.g., emo-
tion lexicon, parsers, etc.). This limits the applica-
bility of these methods to a broader range of tasks
and languages.

To meet the challenges mentioned above, we
propose a novel EaLDA model to construct a
domain-specific emotion lexicon consisting of six
primary emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness and surprise). The proposed EaLDA
model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) model by employ-
ing a small set of seeds to guide the model gener-
ating topics. Hence, the topics consequently group
semantically related words into a same emotion
category. The lexicon is thus able to best meet the
user’s specific needs. Our approach is a weakly su-
pervised approach since only some seeds emotion
sentiment words are needed to lanch the process
of lexicon construction. In practical applications,
asking users to provide some seeds is easy as they
usually have a good knowledge what are important
in their domains.

Extensive experiments are carried out to evalu-
ate our model both qualitatively and quantitatively
using benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate
that our EaLDA model improves the quality and
the coverage of state-of-the-art fine-grained lexi-
con.

2 Related Work

Emotion lexicon plays an important role in opin-
ion mining and sentiment analysis. In order to
build such a lexicon, many researchers have in-
vestigated various kinds of approaches. However,
these methods could roughly be classified into two
categories in terms of the used information. The
first kind of approaches is based on thesaurus that
utilizes synonyms or glosses to determine the sen-
timent orientation of a word. The availability of
the WordNet (Miller, 1995) database is an impor-
tant starting point for many thesaurus-based ap-
proaches (Kamps et al., 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004;
Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). The second kind of
approaches is based on an idea that emotion words
co-occurring with each others are likely to convey
the same polarity. There are numerous studies in
this field (Turney and Littman, 2003; Wiebe and
Riloff, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Barbosa
and Feng, 2010).
Most of the previous studies for emotion lexi-

con construction are limited to positive and nega-
tive emotions. Recently, to enhance the increas-
ingly emotional data, a few researches have been
done to identity the fine-grained emotion of words
(Strapparava andMihalcea, 2007; Gill et al., 2008;
Rao et al., 2012). For example, Gill et al. (2008)
utilize computational linguistic tools to identity the
emotions of the words (such as, joy, sadness, ac-
ceptance, disgust, fear, anger, surprise and antici-
pation). While, this approach is mainly for pub-
lic use in general domains. Rao et al. (2012)
propose an method of automatically building the
word-emotion mapping dictionary for social emo-
tion detection. However, the emtion lexicon is not
outputed explicitly in this paper, and the approach
is fully unsupervised which may be difficult to be
adjusted to fit the personalized data set.
Our approach relates most closely to the method

proposed by Xie and Li (2012) for the construction
of lexicon annotated for polarity based on LDA
model. Our approach differs from (Xie and Li,
2012) in two important ways: first, we do not ad-
dress the task of polarity lexicon construction, but

instead we focus on building fine-grained emotion
lexicon. Second, we don’t assume that every word
in documents is subjective, which is impractical in
real world corpus.

3 Algorithm

In this section, we rigorously define the emotion-
aware LDA model and its learning algorithm. We
descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sam-
pling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and
finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on
the model output.

3.1 Model Description
Like the standard LDA model, EaLDA is a gen-
erative model. To prevent conceptual confusion,
we use a superscript “(e)” to indicate variables re-
lated to emotion topics, and use a superscript “(n)”
to indicate variables of non-emotion topics. We as-
sume that each document has two classes of topics:
M emotion topics (corresponding to M different
emotions) andK non-emotion topics (correspond-
ing to topics that are not associated with any emo-
tion). Each topic is represented by a multinomial
distribution over words. In addition, we assume
that the corpus vocabulary consists of V distinct
words indexed by {1, . . . , V }.
For emotion topics, the EaLDA model draws

the word distribution from a biased Dirichlet prior
Dir(β(e)k ). The vector β

(e)
k ∈ RV is constructed

with β(e)k := γ
(e)
0 (1

V − Ωk) + γ(e)1 Ωk, for k ∈
{1, . . . ,M}. Ωk,w = 1 if and only if word w is a
seed word for emotion k, otherwiseΩk,w = 0. The
scalars γ(e)0 and γ

(e)
1 are hyperparameters of the

model. Intuitively, when γ(e)1 > γ
(e)
0 , the biased

prior ensures that the seed words are more proba-
bly drawn from the associated emotion topic.
The generative process of word distributions for

non-emotion topics follows the standard LDA def-
inition with a scalar hyperparameter β(n).
For each word in the document, we decide

whether its topic is an emotion topic or a non-
emotion topic by flipping a coin with head-
tail probability (p(e), p(n)), where (p(e), p(n)) ∼
Dir(α). The emotion (or non-emotion) topic is
sampled according to a multinomial distribution
Mult(θ(e)) (or Mult(θ(n))). Here, both θ(e) and
θ(n) are document-level latent variables. They
are generated from Dirichlet priors Dir(α(e)) and
Dir(α(n)) with α(s) and α(n) being hyperparame-
ters.

422



We summarize the generative process of the
EaLDA model as below:

1. for each emotion topic k ∈ {1, . . . , M}, draw
ϕ

(e)
k ∼ Dir(β(e)k )

2. for each non-emotion topic k ∈ {1, . . . , K},
draw ϕ(n)k ∼ Dir(β(n))

3. for each document

(a) draw θ(e) ∼ Dir(α(e))
(b) draw θ(n) ∼ Dir(α(n))
(c) draw (p(e), p(n)) ∼ Dir(α)
(d) for each word in document

i. draw topic class indicator s ∼
Bernoulli(ps)

ii. if s = “emotion topic”
A. draw z(e) ∼ Mult(θ(e))
B. draw w ∼ Mult(ϕ(e)

z(e)
) , emit word

w
iii. otherwise
A. draw z(n) ∼ Mult(θ(n))
B. draw w ∼ Mult(ϕ(n)

3.2 Inference Algorithm
Assuming hyperparametersα, α(e), α(n), and β(e),
β(n), we develop a collapsed Gibbs sampling algo-
rithm to estimate the latent variables in the EaLDA
model. The algorithm iteratively takes a word w

from a document and sample the topic that this
word belongs to.
Let the whole corpus excluding the current word

be denoted by D. Let n(e)i,w (or n
(n)
j,w) indicate

the number of occurrences of topic i(e) (or topic
j(n)) with word w in the whole corpus. Let m(e)i
(or m(n)j ) indicate the number of occurrence of
topic i(e) (or topic j(n)) in the current document.
All these counts are defined excluding the current
word. Using the definition of the EaLDA model
and the Bayes Rule, we find that the joint density
of these random variables are equal to

Pr
(
p(e), p(n), θ(e), ϕ(e), θ(n), ϕ(n)|D

)
∝ Pr

(
p(e), p(n), θ(e), ϕ(e), θ(n), ϕ(n)

According to equation (1), we see that

{p(e), p(n)}, {θ(e)i , θ(n)j }, {ϕ(e)i,w} and {ϕ(n)j,w}
are mutually independent sets of random vari-
ables. Each of these random variables satisfies
Dirichlet distribution with a specific set of param-
eters. By the mutual independence, we decompose
the probability of the topic z for the current word
as

Pr
(
z = i(e)|D

)
∝ E[p(e)] · E[θ(e)i ] · E[ϕ(e)i,w] (2)

Pr
(
z = j(n)|D

)
∝ E[p(n)] ·E[θ(n)i ] ·E[ϕ(n)j,w] (3)

Then, by examining the property of Dirichlet
distribution, we can compute expectations on the
right hand side of equation (2) and equation (3) by

Using the above equations, we can sample the
topic z for each word iteratively and estimate all
latent random variables.

3.3 Constructing Emotion Lexicon

Our final step is to construct the domain-specific
emotion lexicon from the estimates ϕ(e) and ϕ(n)
that we obtained from the EaLDA model.
For each word w in the vocabulary, we com-

pare the M + 1 values {ϕ(e)1,w, . . . , ϕ(e)M,w} and
1
K

∑K
i=1 ϕ

(n)
i,w . If ϕ

(e)
i,w is the largest, then the word

w is added to the emotion dictionary for the ith
emotion. Otherwise, 1K

∑K
i=1 ϕ

(n)
i,w is the largest

among the M + 1 values, which suggests that
the word w is more probably drawn from a non-
emotion topic. Thus, the word is considered neu-
tral and not included in the emotion dictionary.

4 Experiments

In this section, we report empirical evaluations of
our proposed model. Since there is no metric ex-
plicitly measuring the quality of an emotion lexi-
con, we demonstrate the performance of our algo-
rithm in two ways: (1) we perform a case study for
the lexicon generated by our algorithm, and (2) we
compare the results of solving emotion classifica-
tion task using our lexicon against different meth-
ods, and demonstrate the advantage of our lexicon
over other lexicons and other emotion classifica-
tion systems.

4.1 Datasets

We conduct experiments to evaluate the effective-
ness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset. This
is an gold-standard English dataset used in the 14th
task of the SemEval-2007workshopwhich focuses
on classification of emotions in the text. The at-
tributes include the news headlines, the score of

emotions of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sad and sur-
prise normalizing from 0 to 100. Two data sets
are available: a training data set consisting of 250
records, and a test data set with 1000 records. Fol-
lowing the strategy used in (Strapparava and Mi-
halcea, 2007), the task was carried out in an unsu-
pervised setting for experiments.
In experiments, data preprocessing is performed

on the data set. First, the texts are tokenized with
a natural language toolkit NLTK1. Then, we re-
move non-alphabet characters, numbers, pronoun,
punctuation and stop words from the texts. Finally,
Snowball stemmer2 is applied so as to reduce the
vocabulary size and settle the issue of data spare-
ness.

4.2 Emotion Lexicon Construction

We first settle down the implementation details for
the EaLDAmodel, specifying the hyperparameters
that we choose for the experiment. We set topic
numberM = 6,K = 4, and hyperparametersα =
0.75, α(e) = α(n) = 0.45, β(n) = 0.5. The vector
β(e) is constructed from the seed dictionary using
γ = (0.25, 0.95).
As mentioned, we use a few domain-

independent seed words as prior information
for our model. To be specific, the seed words list
contains 8 to 12 emotional words for each of the
six emotion categories.3 However, it is important
to note that the proposed models are flexible and
do not need to have seeds for every topic.
Example words for each emotion generated

from the SemEval-2007 dataset are reported in Ta-
ble 1. The judgment is to some extent subjective.
What we reported here are based on our judgments
what are appropriate and what are not for each
emotion topic. From Table 1, we observe that the
generated words are informative and coherent. For
example, the words “flu” and “cancer” are seem-
ingly neutral by its surface meaning, actually ex-
pressing fear emotion for SemEval dataset. These
domain-specific words are mostly not included in
any other existing general-purpose emotion lexi-
cons. The experimental results show that our al-
gorithm can successfully construct a fine-grained
domain-specific emotion lexicon for this corpus
that is able to understand the connotation of the
words that may not be obvious without the context.

4.3 Document-level Emotion Classification

We compare the performance between a popular
emotion lexiconWordNet-Affect (Strapparava and
Valitutti, 2004) and our approach for emotion clas-
sification task. We also compare our results with
those obtained by three systems participating in the
SemEval-2007 emotion annotation task: SWAT,
UPAR7 andUA. The emotion classification results
is evaluated for each emotion category separately.
For each emotion category, we evaluates it as a bi-
nary classification problem. In the evaluation of
emotion lexicons, the binary classification is per-
formed in a very simple way. For each emotion
category and each text, we compare the number of
words within this emotion category, and the aver-
age number of words within other emotion cate-
gories, to output a binary prediction of 1 or 0. This
simple approach is chosen to evaluate the robust-
ness of our emotion lexicon.
In the experiments, performance is evaluated in

terms of F1-score. We summarize the results in
Table 2. As an easy observation, the emotion lex-
icon generated by the EaLDA model consistently
and significantly outperforms the WordNet-Affect
emotion lexicon and other three emotion classifi-
cation systems. In particular, we are able to obtain
an overall F1-score of 10.52% for disgust classifi-
cation task which is difficult to work out using pre-

viously proposed methods. The advantage of our
model may come from its capability of exploring
domain-specific emotions which include not only
explicit emotion words, but also implicit ones.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have presented a novel emotion-
aware LDA model that is able to quickly build a
fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for
languages without many manually constructed re-
sources. The proposed EaLDA model extends the
standard LDAmodel by accepting a set of domain-
independent emotion words as prior knowledge,
and guiding to group semantically related words
into the same emotion category. Thus, it makes
the emotion lexicon containing much richer and
adaptive domain-specific emotion words. Exper-
imental results showed that the emotional lexicons
generated by our algorithm is of high quality, and
can assist emotion classification task.
For future works, we hope to extend the pro-

posed EaLDA model by exploiting discourse
structure knowledge, which has been shown sig-
nificant in identifying the polarity of content-
aware words.
