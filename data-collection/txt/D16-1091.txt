Abstract

Temporal common sense has applications in
AI tasks such as QA, multi-document summa-
rization, and human-AI communication. We
propose the task of sequencing – given a jum-
bled set of aligned image-caption pairs that
belong to a story, the task is to sort them
such that the output sequence forms a coher-
ent story. We present multiple approaches,
via unary (position) and pairwise (order) pre-
dictions, and their ensemble-based combina-
tions, achieving strong results on this task. We
use both text-based and image-based features,
which depict complementary improvements.
Using qualitative examples, we demonstrate
that our models have learnt interesting aspects
of temporal common sense.

1 Introduction

Sequencing is a task for children that is aimed at im-
proving understanding of the temporal occurrence of
a sequence of events. The task is, given a jumbled
set of images (and maybe captions) that belong to
a single story, sort them into the correct order so
that they form a coherent story. Our motivation in
this work is to enable AI systems to better under-
stand and predict the temporal nature of events in
the world. To this end, we train machine learning
models to perform the task of “sequencing”.

Temporal reasoning has a number of applications
such as multi-document summarization of multiple
sources of, say, news information where the relative
order of events can be useful to accurately merge
information in a temporally consistent manner. In
question answering tasks (Richardson et al., 2013;

∗Denotes equal contribution.
†Part of this work was done during an internship at TTIC.

Figure 1: (a) The input is a jumbled set of aligned
image-caption pairs. (b) Actual output of the system
– an ordered sequence of image-caption pairs that
form a coherent story.

Fader et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2015; Ren et al.,
2015), answering questions related to when an event
occurs, or what events occurred prior to a particular
event require temporal reasoning. A good temporal
model of events in everyday life, i.e., a “temporal
common sense”, could also improve the quality of
communication between AI systems and humans.

Stories are a form of narrative sequences that have
an inherent temporal common sense structure. We
propose the use of visual stories depicting personal
events to learn temporal common sense. We use
stories from the Sequential Image Narrative Dataset
(SIND) (Ting-Hao Huang, 2016) in which a set of
5 aligned image-caption pairs together form a co-
herent story. Given an input story that is jumbled
(Fig. 1(a)), we train machine learning models to sort
them into a coherent story (Fig. 1(b)).1

1Note that ‘jumbled’ here refers to the loss of temporal or-
dering; image-caption pairs are still aligned.

Our contributions are as follows:
– We propose the task of visual story sequencing.
– We implement two approaches to solve the task:
one based on individual story elements to predict
position, and the other based on pairwise story ele-
ments to predict relative order of story elements. We
also combine these approaches in a voting scheme
that outperforms the individual methods.
– As features, we represent a story element as both
text-based features from the caption and image-
based features, and show that they provide comple-
mentary improvements. For text-based features, we
use both sentence context and relative order based
distributed representations.
– We show qualitative examples of our models learn-
ing temporal common sense.

2 Related Work

Temporal ordering has a rich history in NLP re-
search. Scripts (Schank and Abelson, 2013), and
more recently, narrative chains (Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2008) contain information about the partic-
ipants and causal relationships between events that
enable the understanding of stories. A number of
works (Mani and Schiffman, 2005; Mani et al.,
2006; Boguraev and Ando, 2005) learn temporal re-
lations and properties of news events from the dense,
expert-annotated TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et
al., 2003). In our work, however, we use multi-
modal story data that has no temporal annotations.

A number of works also reason about temporal
ordering by using manually defined linguistic cues
(Webber, 1988; Passonneau, 1988; Lapata and Las-
carides, 2006; Hitzeman et al., 1995; Kehler, 2000).
Our approach uses neural networks to avoid feature
design for learning temporal ordering.

Recent works (Modi and Titov, 2014; Modi,
2016) learn distributed representations for predi-
cates in a sentence for the tasks of event ordering and
cloze evaluation. Unlike their work, our approach
makes use of multi-modal data with free-form nat-
ural language text to learn event embeddings. Fur-
ther, our models are trained end-to-end while their
pipelined approach involves parsing and extracting
verb frames from each sentence, where errors may
propagate from one module to the next (as discussed
in Section 4.3).

Chen et al. (2009) use a generalized Mallows
model for modeling sequences for coherence within
single documents. Their approach may also be ap-
plicable to our task. Recently, Mostafazadeh et al.
(2016) presented the “ROCStories” dataset of 5-
sentence stories with stereotypical causal and tem-
poral relations between events. In our work though,
we make use of a multi-modal story-dataset that con-
tains both images and associated story-like captions.

Some works in vision (Pickup et al., 2014; Basha
et al., 2012) also temporally order images; typically
by finding correspondences between multiple im-
ages of the same scene using geometry-based ap-
proaches. Similarly, Choi et al. (2016) compose a
story out of multiple short video clips. They define
metrics based on scene dynamics and coherence,
and use dense optical flow and patch-matching. In
contrast, our work deals with stories containing po-
tentially visually dissimilar but semantically coher-
ent set of images and captions.

A few other recent works (Kim et al., 2015; Kim
et al., 2014; Kim and Xing, 2014; Sigurdsson et al.,
2016; Bosselut et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) sum-
marize hundreds of individual streams of informa-
tion (images, text, videos) from the web that deal
with a single concept or event, to learn a common
theme or storyline or for timeline summarization.
Our task, however, is to predict the correct sorting
of a given story, which is different from summa-
rization or retrieval. Ramanathan et al. (2015) at-
tempt to learn temporal embeddings of video frames
in complex events. While their motivation is similar
to ours, they deal with sampled frames from a video
while we attempt to learn temporal common sense
from multi-modal stories consisting of a sequence
of aligned image-caption pairs.

3 Approach

In this section, we first describe the two components
in our approach: unary scores that do not use con-
text, and pairwise scores that encode relative order-
ings of elements. Next, we describe how we com-
bine these scores through a voting scheme.

3.1 Unary Models
Let σ ∈ Σn denote a permutation of n elements
(image-caption pairs). We use σi to denote the posi-
tion of element i in the permutation σ. A unary score

926



Su(σ) captures the appropriateness of each story el-
ement i in position σi:

Su(σ) =
n∑

i=1

P (σi|i) (1)

where P (σi|i) denotes the probability of the ele-
ment i being present in position σi, which is the
output from an n-way softmax layer in a deep
neural network. We experiment with 2 networks –
(1) A language-alone unary model (Skip-
Thought+MLP) that uses a Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) proposed by Cho et al. (2014) to embed
a caption into a vector space. We use the Skip-
Thought (Kiros et al., 2015) GRU, which is trained
on the BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) to predict the
context (preceding and following sentences) of a
given sentence. These embeddings are fed as input
into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
(2) A language+vision unary model (Skip-
Thought+CNN+MLP) that embeds the caption
as above and embeds the image via a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). We use the activations
from the penultimate layer of the 19-layer VGG-
net (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), which have
been shown to generalize well. Both embeddings
are concatenated and fed as input to an MLP.

In both cases, the best ordering of
the story elements (optimal permutation)
σ∗ = arg maxσ∈Σn Su(σ) can be found effi-
ciently in O(n3) time with the Hungarian algo-
rithm (Munkres, 1957). Since these unary scores
are not influenced by other elements in the story,
they capture the semantics and linguistic structures
associated with specific positions of stories e.g., the
beginning, the middle, and the end.

3.2 Pairwise Models

Similar to learning to rank approaches (Hang, 2011),
we develop pairwise scoring models that given a pair
of elements (i, j), learn to assign a score:
S([[σi < σj ]] | i, j) indicating whether element i
should be placed before element j in the permutation
σ. Here, [[·]] indicates the Iverson bracket (which is
1 if the input argument is true and 0 otherwise). We
develop and experiment with the following 3 pair-
wise models:
(1) A language-alone pairwise model (Skip-

Thought+MLP) that takes as input a pair of Skip-
Thought embeddings and trains an MLP (with
hinge-loss) that outputs S([[σi < σj ]] | i, j), the
score for placing i before j.
(2) A language+vision pairwise model (Skip-
Thought+CNN+MLP) that concatenates the Skip-
Thought and CNN embeddings for i and j and trains
a similar MLP as above.
(3) A language-alone neural position embedding
(NPE) model. Instead of using frozen Skip-Thought
embeddings, we learn a task-aware ordered dis-
tributed embedding for sentences. Specifically,
each sentence in the story is embedded X =
(x1, . . . ,xn), xi ∈ Rd+, via an LSTM (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997) with ReLU non-linearities.
Similar to the max-margin loss that is applied to neg-
ative examples by Vendrov et al. (2016), we use an
asymmetric penalty that encourages sentences ap-
pearing early in the story to be placed closer to the
origin than sentences appearing later in the story.

Lij =
∥∥∥max(0, α− (xj − xi))

∥∥∥
2

Loss =
∑

1<=i<j=n

Lij
(2)

At train time, the parameters of the LSTM are
learned end-to-end to minimize this asymmetric or-
dered loss (as measured over the gold-standard se-
quences). At test time, we use S([[σi < σj ]] | i, j) =
Lij . Thus, as we move away from the origin in the
embedding space, we traverse through the sentences
in a story. Each of these three pairwise approaches
assigns a score S(σi, σj |i, j) to an ordered pair of
elements (i,j), which is used to construct a pairwise
scoring model:

Sp(σ) =
∑

1<=i<j<=n

{
S([[σi < σj ]])− S([[σj < σi]])

}
,

(3)
by summing over the scores for all possible ordered
pairs in the permutation. This pairwise score cap-
tures local contextual information in stories. Find-
ing the best permutation σ∗ = arg maxσ∈Σn Sp(σ)
under this pairwise model is NP-hard so approxi-
mations will be required. In our experiments, we
study short sequences (n = 5), where the space of
permutations is easily enumerable (5! = 120). For
longer sequences, we can utilize integer program-
ming methods or well-studied spectral relaxations
for this problem.

927



3.3 Voting-based Ensemble

To combine the complementary information cap-
tured by the unary (Su) and pairwise models (Sp),
we use a voting-based ensemble. For each method
in the ensemble, we find the top three permuta-
tions. Each of these permutations (σk) then vote
for a particular element to be placed at a particu-
lar position. Let V be a vote matrix such that Vij
stores the number of votes for ith element to oc-
cur at jth position, i.e. Vij =

∑
k[[σ

k
i == j]]).

We use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal
permutation that maximizes the votes assigned, i.e.
σ∗vote = arg maxσ∈Σn

∑n
i=1

∑n
j=1 Vij · [[σi == j]].

We experimented with a number of model voting
combinations and found the combination of pairwise
Skip-Thought+CNN+MLP and neural position em-
beddings to work best (based on a validation set).

4 Experiments

4.1 Data

We train and evaluate our model on personal multi-
modal stories from the SIND (Sequential Image
Narrative Dataset) (Ting-Hao Huang, 2016), where
each story is a sequence of 5 images and correspond-
ing story-like captions. The narrative captions in this
dataset, e.g., “friends having a good time” (as op-
posed to “people sitting next to each other”) capture
a sequential, conversational language, which is char-
acteristic of stories. We use 40,155 stories for train-
ing, 4990 for validation and 5055 stories for testing.

4.2 Metrics

We evaluate the performance of our model at cor-
rectly ordering a jumbled set of story elements using
the following 3 metrics:
Spearman’s rank correlation (Sp.) (Spearman,
1904) measures if the ranking of story elements in
the predicted and ground truth orders are monotoni-
cally related (higher is better).
Pairwise accuracy (Pairw.) measures the fraction
of pairs of elements whose predicted relative order-
ing is the same as the ground truth order (higher is
better).
Average Distance (Dist.) measures the average
change in position of all elements in the predicted

story from their respective positions in the ground
truth story (lower is better).

4.3 Results

Pairwise Models vs Unary Models As shown in
Table 1, the pairwise models based on Skip-Thought
features outperform the unary models in our task.
However, the Pairwise Order Model performs worse
than the unary Skip-Thought model, suggesting that
the Skip-Thought features, which encode context of
a sentence, also provide a crucial signal for temporal
ordering of story sentences.

Contribution of Image Features Augmenting the
text features with image features results in a visible
performance improvement of both the model trained
with unary features and the model trained with pair-
wise features. While image features by themselves
result in poor performance on this task, they seem to
capture temporal information that is complementary
to the text features.

Ensemble Voting To exploit the fact that unary
and pairwise models, as well as text and image fea-
tures, capture different aspects of the story, we com-
bine them using a voting ensemble. Based on the
validation set, we found that combining the Pair-
wise Order model and the Pairwise model with both
Skip-Thought and Image (CNN) features performs
the best. This voting based method achieves the
best performance on all three metrics. This shows
that our different approaches indeed capture comple-
mentary information regarding feasible orderings of
caption-image pairs to form a coherent story.

For comparison to existing related work, we tried

(d) Fourth Position (e) Fifth Position

Figure 2: Word cloud corresponding to most discriminative words for each position.

to duplicate the pipelined approach of Modi and
Titov (2014). For this, we first parse our story
sentences to extract SVO (subject, verb, object) tu-
ples (using the Stanford Parser (Chen and Manning,
2014)). However, this step succeeds for only 60%
of our test data. Now even if we consider a perfect
downstream algorithm that always makes the cor-
rect position prediction given SVO tuples, the over-
all performance is still a Spearman correlation of
just 0.473, i.e., the upper bound performance of this
pipelined approach is lower than the performance
of our text-only end-to-end model (correlation of
0.546) in Table 1.

4.4 Qualitative Analysis

Visualizations of position predictions from our
model demonstrate that it has learnt the three act
structure (Trottier, 1998) in stories – the setup, the
middle and the climax. We also present success and
failure examples of our sorting model’s predictions.
See the supplementary for more details and figures.

We visualize our model’s temporal common
sense, in Fig. 2. The word clouds show discrim-
inative words – the words that the model believes
are indicative of sentence positions in a story. The
size of a word is proportional to the ratio of its fre-
quency of occurring in that position to other po-
sitions. Some words like ‘party’, ‘wedding’, etc.,
probably because our model believes that the start
the story describes the setup – the occasion or event.
People often tend to describe meeting friends or
family members which probably results in the dis-
criminative words such as ‘people’, ‘friend’, ‘every-
one’ in the second and the third sentences. More-

over, the model believes that people tend to conclude
the stories using words like ‘finally’, ‘afterwards’,
tend to talk about ‘great day’, group ‘pictures’ with
everyone, etc.

5 Conclusion

We propose the task of “sequencing” in a set of
image-caption pairs, with the motivation of learn-
ing temporal common sense. We implement multi-
ple neural network models based on individual and
pairwise element-based predictions (and their en-
semble), and utilize both image and text features,
to achieve strong performance on the task. Our
best system, on average, predicts the ordering of
sentences to within a distance error of 0.8 (out of
5) positions. We also analyze our predictions and
show qualitative examples that demonstrate tempo-
ral common sense.
