Abstract 

In recent years, detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in early stages based on natural language 

processing (NLP) has drawn much attention. To date, vocabulary size, grammatical complexi-

ty, and fluency have been studied using NLP metrics. However, the content analysis of AD 

narratives is still unreachable for NLP. This study investigates features of the words that AD 

patients use in their spoken language. After recruiting 18 examinees of 53–90 years old (mean: 

76.89), they were divided into two groups based on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 

scores. The AD group comprised 9 examinees with scores of 21 or lower. The healthy control 

group comprised 9 examinees with scores of 22 or higher. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 

(LIWC). The word frequency was found from observation. Significant differences were con-

firmed for the usage of impersonal pronouns in the AD group. This result demonstrated the 

basic feasibility of the proposed NLP-based Alzheimer’s disease detection approach. 

1 Introduction 

The increasing life expectancy has led to severe health and social problems. Among them, the most 

severe problem is the rising frequency of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Wortmann 2015) among the popu-

lation. Japan is especially faced with a crisis posed by AD. Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and 

Welfare reported that more than 1 in 4 control individuals would soon be afflicted with mild cognitive 

impairment (MCI) or AD. If all afflicted people were treated for MCI and AD, then the cost is esti-

mated to be as high as 10 trillion dollars per year. As the number of patients with AD increases, the 

needs of these individuals might eventually exceed the current capacity of the national healthcare sys-

tem, requiring various methods to detect the early stages of AD, prevent further deterioration, and al-

leviate requirements for care. Natural language processing (NLP) has also drawn much attention as a 

novel and simple method to detect AD using language. 

Roark et al. indicated that a spoken narrative recall task can discriminate between healthy control 

people and those with MCI (Roark, Mitchell et al. 2011). Tanaka et al. proposed a computer avatar 

based approach to detect dementia in very early stages (Tanaka et al. 2016). Aramaki et al. also specif-

ically examined  the patients’ narratives during a test (Aramaki et al. 2016). Year by year, MCI and 

AD narratives have been newly analyzed using NLP. 

Although the details of the methods differ among them, they share the same approach, examining 

functional features (such as audio and transcript of narrative recall task by Roark et al. ), spoken dialog 

by Tanaka et al. and transcriptions written and spoken narratives and vocabulary size by Aramaki et 

 

78



al. ) (Aramaki et al. 2016)) to detect and characterize patients with a disease. They did not deal with 

the contents of the narratives. In contrast, this paper presents a new method to detect AD based the 

categories of words patients use in spoken narratives. The word categories are classified by Linguistic 

Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary for text analysis. 

To date, it has generally been pointed out that words from people with AD differ from those of 

healthy control people, including slowed speech, word-finding hesitation, sentences with abnormal 

words, and using words that are mispronounced or incomprehensible
1
. Especially, it is often said that 

AD patients more frequently use pronouns (e.g. it, that) than healthy control people. An example is 

presented in Figure 1. The sample includes much silence, repeating similar utterances, and pronouns. 

Using the LIWC, this study empirically investigates the proportion of word categories between AD 

and healthy control people. Our review of the literature indicates that this report is the first quantitative 

study investigating the word categories associated with AD in Japanese. The statistics is presented in 

Table 1.

Contributions of this study can be summarized as shown below. 

 A LIWC analysis is conducted for narratives uttered by people suspected of having AD. 
 This study also examines a proposed method for LIWC translation. 

2 Related Work 

Recent studies of early detection methods such as blood testing and detailed memory testing have re-

vealed vast improvements in detection capabilities (Mapstone et al. 2014). However, most of these 

methods are physically or mentally invasive, which has led to anticipation of less-invasive or even 

non-invasive detection methods. Dementia symptoms include degenerative cognitive decline, as well 

as behavioral and functional disorders. The disease also results in the deterioration of various execu-

tive functions, reasoning, and language abilities. Among these, language deficits have been shown to 

be more apparent from the early stages of dementia (Snowdon et al. 1996). These deficits include 

naming disorders, auditory and written comprehension impairment, fluent but empty speech, and se-

mantic paraphasia. However, repetition capabilities and articulation are often preserved (Appell et al. 

1982). Reportedly, the impairment of language abilities in dementia patients is often inconsistent be-

cause semantic and pragmatic language abilities are likely to become more impaired, whereas syntax 

and phonology demonstrate better preservation (Schwartz et al. 1979). Semantic errors reportedly are

the most common and distinct language deficit because dementia patients tend to substitute target 

names with superordinate category names or demonstrate circumlocutory speech with impaired nam-

ing (Emery 2000). Other reports have also described unrelated errors (Moreaud et al. 2001), phonolog-

ical errors (Croot et al. 2000), and visual errors (Croot et al. 2000). However, these are often depend-

ent on the type of picture confrontation naming task, the severity or stage of the disease, or other 

unique patient-level circumstances (Geda 2012). MCI, part of which constitutes a pre-stage of demen-

tia, might indicate a boundary between aging-related non-dementia reduction in cognition and demen-

tia on the spectrum of cognitive function. 

Using the above characteristics, various dementia screening methods have been proposed to date. 
Table 2 shows the summary of previous screening studies. Well-known studies were those conducted 

by Roark et al. (Roark et al. 2007; Roark et al. 2011), which analyzed the lexical features and syntactic 

feature from transcripts of spoken narrative such as neuropsychological approaches (Moriyama et al. 

2015) and automatic speech analysis approaches (König et al. 2015). Some of them used automatic 

speech recognition (Tóth et al. 2015). Aramaki et al. specifically examined vocabulary size in speech 

transcription (Aramaki et al. 2016). Tanaka et al. proposed a novel approach using computer avatars 

(Tanaka et al. 2016). In addition Orimaye et al. (Orimaye et al. 2014) used machine learning algo-

rithms to build diagnostic models using syntactic and lexical features and Jarrold et al. used LIWC for 

aided diagnosis of Dementia (Jarrold et al. 2014).

3 Materials 

We have collected narratives of hospital patients to build the corpus. 

3.1 Research field  

Criteria used for the experiment are the following. 

[Inclusion criterion] 

 AD group (AD): Patients with Alzheimer’s disease between light MCI and middle class MCI 
(MMSE below 21 points). 

 Healthy control group (HC): Patients without AD. Healthy control people group members 
are age-matched with AD group members (MMSE over 22 points)

3.2 Ethics Statement 

The experiment is explained to patients (or their family). If they cannot understand the explanation, 

then we exclude them. We do not reward the patients. The use of these data for research purposes was 

approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University (approval NO. E2525). 

3.3 MMSE – based Patient Classification 

The goal of this study is to detect important features that can classify AD and others by analyzing their 

spoken narratives. Thus, we determine a person is AD or not (MCI and normal) based on Mini Mental 

State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE is a simple inspection method for a subject suspected as AD. 

In this test, a patient is asked 11 questions; their answers are judged by the score (max 30; min 0). The 

MMSE scores between 30 and 27 points are normal; those between 26 and 22 points might be MCI; 

and those below 21 points might be AD. 

4 Language Resource LIWC 

4.1 What is LIWC 

We use Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) as a language resource for classifying words into 

corresponding categories. LIWC has been developed by researchers who are interested in social, clini-

cal, health, and cognitive psychology. We can classify people’s social and psychological states using 

LIWC. However because LIWC is only for English, it is difficult to apply to Japanese texts. Our re-

view of literature indicates that no resource for Japanese is comparable with LIWC. 

Therefore, we make Japanese LIWC by translating English LIWC. We arrange categories for Japa-

nese LIWC by considering a gap depending on the language differences. Table 4 shows 64 categories 

in English LIWC. Then we extract 22 categories related to diseases by the judgment of the authors, as 

shown in Table 5. We remove categories that are not related to our target disease (e.g. <Body>). We 

also remove categories that are not translatable to Japanese. (e.g. <Article>).  

<Funct> <Ipron> <Sad> <Incl> <Adverbs> <Family> <Body> <Work>

<Pronoun> <Article> <CogMech> <Excl> <Prep> <Friends> <Health> <Achiev>

<Ppron> <Verbs> <Insight> <Percept> <Conj> <Humans> <Sexual> <Leisure>

 <I> <AuxVb> <Cause> <See> <Negate> <Affect> <Ingest> <Home>

4.2 LIWC Translation Procedure 

We translate LIWC into Japanese to produce Japanese LIWC as shown below. 

 Step 1: All words in English LIWC were translated using EDICT (an electric dictionary produced 
by EDP and JimBreen

3
). 

 Step 2: One worker searched mistakenly translated words by sight and deleted them. As a result, 
5,534 words out of 6,211 words remained. 

 Step 3: If a duplicated pairs of a Japanese word and its category are found, then we put them to-
gether such that 4,769 words out of 5,534 words remained. 

 Step 4: When conducting morphological analysis for Japanese, we ignore words in the category 

<Past>. Then the words of verbs belonging to the category <Present> is changed to 

<Verbs>. We remove three categories <We>, <SheHe>, and <They> and words belonging to 

these because it was determined that these categories have no correlation with disease. 

 Therefore, the number of categories are reduced from 22 to 19. 

 Step 5: Words in multiple categories are assigned to the most appropriate category by one worker. 

In Japanese, it is difficult to distinguish between words related to <Time> and those related to 

<Space>. Therefore, we define a new category called <TimeSpace>. The number of catego-

ries becomes 20. We apply these steps to 2,700 words. 

5 Experiments 

5.1 Procedure 

We analyze the corpus as explained below. 

 Step 1: Texts are analyzed morphologically and stemmed using a Japanese morphological ana-
lyzer (Kurohashi and Nagao 2003). 

 Step 2: The results are consulted by Japanese LIWC. We then count the LIWC word in the corpus. 
 Step 3: We investigate the ratio of LIWC word frequency for each category. 

5.2 Results 

The results of t-test are presented in Table 6. In order to the examine the difference between speech of 

AD group and HC group in a statistical manner. Note that we investigated the difference of the aver-

age values in AD and HC group. As shown in Table 6, no significant difference was found between 

AD and HC in any categories, except for four: <Social>, impersonal pronoun <Ipron>, anxiety 

<Anx>, <Verbs>, and <Present>. As for <Anx>, HC’s value is 0. Figure 2 presents results of the 

category frequency of AD and HC.

Figure 2: Category frequency of AD (green) and HC (red). Significant differences were found for 

<Ipron>, <Anx>, <Verbs>, <Present>, and <Social>. 

6 Discussion 

First, we discuss the findings based on quantitative evidence obtained from a previous study (Sec. 6.1). 

Then we examine the results by using machine learning (Sec. 6.2). 

6.1 Findings: Quantitative Evidence of Previous Study 

We discuss categories for which significant differences between AD and HC are observed. The values 

of <Social> in AD group were significantly lower than those in HC group. Generally, it is said that 

participating in social activities is effective to prevent AD progression. In other words, a person with 

little social contact tends to develop AD. Consequently, this result corresponds with AD features. The 

values of <Ipron> in AD group were significantly higher than those in HC group. AD patients be-

come forgetful. Therefore, they use many impersonal pronouns (Almor et al. 1999). Viewed from a 

grammatical perspective, ellipses of a subject or objects of a verb are not allowed. They often appear 

as a pronoun in English, but the ellipsis of them is allowed in the Japanese language. Considering this 

feature, it is possible that the use of impersonal pronouns becomes more frequent in the condition of 

AD, particularly for Japanese speakers. Similarly, it corresponds with general AD features. The values 

of <Verbs> and <Present> in AD group were also significantly larger than those in HC group. 

However, it is difficult to understand why these results were obtained. Therefore, in future work, it 

will be necessary to investigate the words in these categories in detail. 

Consequently, some observed results supported the previous findings on AD. Although most of the 

previous studies have been based on subjective observations, our findings provide quantitative evi-

dence for their claims, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. 

83



6.2 Decision Tree 

In order to the most important clue to classify patients into AD and HC, a decision tree is constructed 

as shown in Figure 3. It has feature values representing probabilities to be classified into AD or HC in 

categories.  
<Ipron> <= 0.0298

n = 18

AD: 9 HC: 9

<Space> <= 0.0285

n = 11

AD: 8 HC: 3

n = 1

AD: 1 HC: 0

<Posemo> <= 0.0046
n = 7

AD: 1 HC: 6

n = 6

AD: 0 HC: 6

n = 2

AD: 0 HC: 2

<Posemo> <= 0.0025

n = 9

AD: 8 HC: 1

n = 8

AD: 8 HC: 0

n = 1

AD: 0 HC: 1

Yes No

 
Figure 3: Decision tree results for AD screening. 

 

Figure 3 shows that there are two cases for a person to be diagnosed as AD. The first case is that of 

using words in <Ipron> below 0.0298 and the value using words in <Posemo> below 0.0046. The 

probability is 100% to be classified into AD. The other case is that the percentage of impersonal pro-

nouns <Ipron> is higher than 0.0298, the percentage of Space <Space> is less than 0.0285 and the 

percentage of Positive emotion <Posemo> is higher than 0.0025. The probability is also 100% for 

classification into AD. Results demonstrate that the values of appearance of words of <Ipron>, 

<Space> and <Posemo> in conversation are important for AD screening. 

7 Conclusion 

This study investigated features of the words that AD patients used in their utterances. 18 examinees 

of 53–90 years old (mean: 76.89) were recruited and divided into two groups based on their MMSE 

scores. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) classified words were used to categorize the words 

that the examinees used. Then their frequency was ascertained. This report is the first of a quantitative 

study that investigated the word categories of AD. Significant differences were found for the AD 

group in the usage of several LIWC categories, including impersonal pronouns, which suggests that 

this simple method can be used for dementia screening.
