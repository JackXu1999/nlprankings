Abstract
This paper reports on the development of 
the  prototype  African  Wordnet  (AWN)  
which currently includes four languages.  
The  resource  has  been  developed  by  
translating Common Base Concepts from 
English, and currently holds roughly 42  
000 synsets. We describe here how some 
language specific and technical challenges 
have been overcome and discuss efforts to 
localise the content of the wordnet and  
quality assurance methods. A comparison 
of the number of synsets per language is 
given  before  concluding  with  plans  to  
fast-track  the  development  and  for  
dissemination of the resource.  

1 Introduction

Wordnets  for  African  languages  were 
introduced  with  a  training  workshop  for 
linguists,  lexicographers  and  computer 
scientists facilitated by international experts in 
2007. The development of wordnet prototypes 
for  four  official  South  African  languages 
started in 2008 as the African Wordnet Project. 
This  project  was  based  on  collaboration 
between the Department of African Languages 
at the University of South Africa (UNISA) and 
the Centre for Text Technology (CTexT) at the 
North-West  University  (NWU),  as  well  as 
support from the developers of the DEBVisDic 
tools at the Masaryk University1. The initiative 
resulted  in  first  versions  of  wordnets  for 
isiZulu  [zul],  isiXhosa  [xho],  Setswana  [tsn] 
and  Sesotho  sa  Leboa  (Sepedi)  [nso]2,  all 
members  of  the  Bantu  language  family.  An 
expansion of the African Wordnet followed in 
2011,  and  currently  the  development  has 
entered a third phase that aims at solidifying 
the  African  Wordnets  as  a  valued  resource 
with  formal  quality  assurance,  as  well  as

further  expansion  of  the  synsets,  definitions 
and  usage  examples.  Figure  1  gives  an 
overview of  the  development,  as  well  as  the 
deliverables in each phase.

   In  this  paper,  we  reflect  critically  on  the 
previous  phases  in  development  including 
challenges  faced  and   solutions  to  some 
common  problems.  Section  3  gives  a  brief 
report  on the current  standing of the African 
wordnets  and  sections  4  and  5  give  details 
regarding future work.

2 Status quo after the first 2 phases 

During  the  first  phase  (2008-2010),  linguists 
who  had  participated  in  the  introductory 
workshop  were  invited  to  partake  in  the 
project.  Linguists  representing  the  four 
languages  mentioned  above,  volunteered  and 
since then, the development has been constant 
with  two phases  completed.  Table  1  gives  a

summary of  the  total  number  of  synsets  and 
definitions that have been developed thus far.

Table 1. Total number of synsets and definitions 
developed for four African languages.

As will be mentioned in section 3, the team 
faced many challenges and had to apply some 
creative problem solving at times. During the 
first  two  phases,  important  fundamental 
training and development had to be done, for 
instance a second workshop, again facilitated 
by international  wordnet  experts  was  held  at 
the beginning of 2011, followed by training on 
more  technical  aspects  of  wordnet 
development  such  as  automated  quality 
control,  in  2012.  The  core  project  team has 
stayed largely unchanged and renewed funding 
for a third phase of development contributed to 
the continued growth of the African Wordnets. 

3 Challenges  to  the  development  of 
African Wordnets

3.1 Availability of resources
The languages  in  this  project  are  considered 
resource  scarce  compared  to  most  other 
languages  listed  in  The  Global  WordNet 
Organization3 in  the  sense  that  lexical 
resources  are  relatively  limited.  The  four 
languages  included  in  the  project  so  far, 
however, each have at least one or two paper 
dictionaries  available,  ranging  from 
monolingual  to  bilingual  general  purpose  or 
learners’ dictionaries.  Apart from a basic on-
line  dictionary  for  Sesotho  sa  Leboa4 and 
isiZulu.net5, which is an online isiZulu-English 
dictionary  that  anyone  can  contribute  to, 
containing  bidirectional  lookups  as  well  as 
basic  morphological  decomposition, there  are 
no  online  or  machine-readable  lexicons 
available for any of the languages. 
 Currently  only  relatively  restricted 
unannotated and not freely accessible corpora 
are available. For example, the University of 
3 See http://globalwordnet.org/?

5 See http://isizulu.net/

Pretoria  Corpora (Prinsloo  &  de  Schryver, 
2005:101)  range  from approximately  two to 
nine  million  tokens  for  the  various  South 
African  languages.  Three  types  of  corpora 
have  been  collected,  viz.  general  purpose 
(LGP) corpora, special-purpose (LSP) corpora 
and  true  parallel  corpora.  The  main 
characteristics  of  the  eleven  South  African 
LGP  corpora,  which  are  the  biggest  of  the 
three types built, are shown in Table 2. 

Table 2. Pretoria LPG corpora.

 Smaller,  unannotated parallel  corpora  are 
freely  available  from  the  newly  established 
Resource  Management  Agency  (RMA). 
Recently the NLP Group of the University of 
Leipzig has also made corpora for most of the 
languages  in  the  African  Wordnet  project, 
freely  available  (Wortschatz  Universität 
Leipzig,  2013).  Although  these  corpora  are 
unannotated  and  still  relatively  small,  the 
development work seems promising.

 The  agglutinating  nature  of  the  African 
languages  belonging  to  the  Bantu  language 
family,  particularly  for  those  with  a 
conjunctive  orthography  e.g.  isiZulu  and 
isiXhosa,  call  for  morphological  annotation 
for the purposes of accurate corpus searches. 
Although  prototypes  of  rule-based 
morphological analysers have been developed 
for the mentioned two languages, these are not 
freely available  yet  (cf.  Bosch et  al.,  2008).

Due  to  the  limited  availability  of 
lexicographic  and  basic  language  resources 
for  the  African  languages,  wordnet 
construction thus  presents  a  challenging and 
time-consuming task for the linguists.

3.2 Language specific challenges
A  number  of  language  specific  challenges 
anticipated at the beginning of the project are 
discussed in Le Roux et al. (2007) and will not 
be  repeated  here.  However,  a  number  of 
additional challenges were encountered, some 
of  which  are  dealt  with  in  more  detail  in  a 
parallel  paper  (cf.  Mojapelo,  2014).  For 
example,  consider  the  following  synset  for 
“breaststroke”6: 

{00572097}  <noun.act>[04]  S:  (n) 
breaststroke#1  (a  swimming  stroke; 
the arms are extended together in front 
of the head and swept back on either 
side accompanied by a frog kick)

    A whole discussion arose around the isiZulu 
version of the above synset since a dictionary 
entry  of   the  verb  -gwedla (swim  by 
breaststroke  OR paddle/row)  was  found in  a 
bilingual  dictionary  (Doke  &  Vilakazi, 
1964:285).  The  debate  among  linguists  was 
whether  -gwedla in  the  infinitive,  i.e. 
ukugwedla (lit. to swim by breaststroke) would 
be a suitable representation in isiZulu.  Some 
felt that -gwedla is more commonly used in the 
context  of  ‘rowing  an  actual  boat’.   To 
complicate  matters,  no  equivalents  for  other 
swimming  strokes  such  as  butterfly, 
backstroke,  freestyle  etc.  are  lexicalised  in 
isiZulu, or for that matter, any of the languages 
in the project. 

3.3 Technical challenges 
One  of  the  major  worries  for  the  African 
Wordnets  team,  was  securing  continual 
funding for the very important base work. Not 
only was funding needed to provide technical 
assistance and project management, but also to 
reimburse  linguists  for  the  linguistic 
development  of  the  wordnets.   All  of  the 
linguists  involved  with  this  project  are 
employed  full  time  at  academic  institutions 
and  are  not  able  to  devote  much  of  their 
workday  to  development  of  the  wordnets,

7=1&o5=1&o9=&o6=1&o3=1&o4=1&i=0&h=10
000&s=breaststroke

slowing  progress  almost  to  a  standstill.  The 
BalkaNet  project,  for  instance,  also 
incentivised  or  contracted  the  initial 
development of wordnets for Bulgarian, Greek, 
Romanian,  Serbian  and  Turkish.  The  core 
wordnets  delivered  at  the  end  of  the  3  year 
project  contained  roughly  8000  synsets, 
developed in 3 years – comparative to our 10 
000 synsets in each of our African wordnets. 
The Serbian team then continued development 
on a voluntary basis  and in the next  2 years 
(2006  –  2008)  could  only  add  another  2240 
synsets (Krstev et al., 2008). This supports our 
decision  to  apply  for  further  funding  and 
continue  incentivising  the  development  in 
order to speed up the process to a point that the 
wordnets are a truly useful tool for the creation 
of other NLP applications (where an excess of 
200  000  synsets  have  proven  to  make  a 
considerable  difference  in  the  quality  those 
applications can deliver).

     A number of problems with the connection 
to  the  server  were  reported  by the  linguists. 
These  problems  related  mainly  to  the  high 
level of network security and restricted access 
at the universities involved. The project team 
was  dependent  on  collaboration  of  IT-
departments from three universities, as we had 
no  direct  control  over  security  policies, 
firewalls,  etc.  The  distance  between  the 
linguists (mostly at UNISA in Pretoria, South 
Africa)  and  the  support  team  (NWU  in 
Potchefstroom, some 160 km away) also posed 
a  threat  to  project  progress.  This  risk  was 
managed  through  an  intent  focus  on  regular 
communication  between  the  sites,  and  the 
implementation  of  a  backup  plan,  namely 
reverting  to  working  on  Microsoft®  Excel 
spreadsheets  during  ‘down-time’,  and  then 
importing  them  to  the  database  and  online 
DEBVisDic  environment  afterwards.  Some 
linguists also experienced regular interruptions 
in  internet  connectivity  due  to  a  weaker 
infrastructure  in  the  whole  of  South  Africa. 
Being  able  to  revert  to  this  offline  method, 
meant that they could continue working from 
home  without  needing  a  constant  internet 
connection.

     Human capital development also took time 
and since this is the first project of its kind for 
African  languages,  new technical  skills,  like 
working with the DEBVisDic tools, had to be 
learnt. Because of the slow progress in the first 
project, the project team had to include more

linguists  in  the  development  of  synsets  and 
definitions  than  initially  planned.  The 
advantages of this were twofold. Not only did 
the  progress  speed up significantly and were 
we  able  to  deliver  the  contracted  number  of 
new synsets and definitions on time, but more 
South  African  linguists  were  trained  in 
development of wordnets.    

4 Current development

4.1 Introducing the third phase
The  aim  of  the  current  third  project  is  an 
extended scope of the African Wordnet Project 
which gained considerable momentum over the 
past 4 years. Our primary aim is to develop at 
least  15  000 new synsets  and  definitions,  to 
add usage examples to existing synsets and to 
do  continual  quality  assurance  on  the 
wordnets.  Most  importantly,  a  5th African 
language,  Tshivenda [ven],  is  being added to 
the  project.  From  the  previous  phases,  it 
became clear that a stronger emphasis needs to 
be placed on localisation of the wordnet. It was 
found  that  many  synsets  in  the  English 
wordnet  are  not  concepts  that  belong  in  the 
African  environment  (lexicalised  items). 
During this phase, greater care will be taken to 
ensure that truly African synsets are included. 

4.2 Quality  assessment  and  semi-
automatic assistance
As  mentioned  earlier,  very  few  core 
technologies  exist  for  the  resource  scarce 
African  languages.  For  this  reason,  many  of 
the  internationally  proven  methods  to  do 
quality assessment  on wordnets could not  be 
applied (cf. Smrz, 2004 and Kotzé, 2008). The 
team did  have  access  to  proprietary  spelling 
checkers  developed  for  Microsoft®  Office. 
These  spelling  checkers  can  be  seen  as  so 
called first generation technologies, since very 
little language analysis  like with grammar or 
morphological analysers is available and they 
rely strongly on lexicon lookup. 

     The Excel sheets and online versions of the 
wordnets were consolidated in a single XML 
file  per  language  before  three  categories  of 
possible  errors  were  identified  automatically. 
Cells  with  potential  problems  were  indicated 
with  coloured  formatting  and  linguists  were 
asked  to  pay  special  attention  while  doing 
quality  assessment  to  these  cells.  The  error 
categories are: 

• Possible spelling errors, 

• Empty (critical) fields, and 

• Formatting  errors  (i.e.  missing  or 
invalid  sense  numbers,  English  IDs 
and  SUMO/MILO  relations, 
recognised with a simple Perl script).

4.3 Localisation of the base concepts
Most  of  the  initial  decisions  made  regarding 
the design of the African wordnets, were based 
on the experiences of 2 international projects, 
namely the BalkaNet project and the EuroNet 
Project.  In  both  these  successful  endeavours, 
the project teams drew up an initial list of the 
most important concepts to use as seed terms 
to  start  building  wordnets.  These  so-called 
Base  Concepts  are  regarded  as  “the 
fundamental  building  blocks  for  establishing 
the relations in a wordnet and give information 
about  the  dominant  lexicalization  patterns  in 
languages” (GWA, 2013). The list of Common 
Base Concepts created in the EuroNet project 
contains roughly 1024 synsets. These Common 
Base Concepts were extended to 5000 synsets 
and mapped to the Princeton WordNet 2.0 in 
the BalkaNet project, using a similar approach, 
but  applied  to  other  (mostly  European) 
languages. 
     During the first 2 phases, we followed the 
guidance given in the extended Common Base 
Concepts  lists.  It  soon  became  clear  that  a 
more  localised approach  was  needed,  as  this 
and the Princeton Core Concepts list7 contain 
concepts  that  do  not  accurately  describe  the 
African context.  Linguists  were spending too 
much time on foreign concepts and especially 
the less experienced linguists did not have the 
confidence to venture off this list too far. Table 
3 gives some examples of nouns that are not 
lexicalised in the African languages.

standards.

When adding  the  new Tshivenda wordnet  to 
this project, we decided to take a careful look 
at the concepts we use as the seed terms. Our 
premise  was that  more localised terms might 
be extracted from real-world parallel corpora. 
To  examine  the  difference,  a  multilingual 
parallel  corpus,  including  English,  Setswana, 
isiZulu,  isiXhosa,  Sesotho  sa  Leboa  and 
Tshivenda equivalents was acquired from the 
RMA.   The  English  version  of  the  parallel 
corpus contained 50 000 tokens and was used 
to compare the African languages data to the 
Princeton core concepts.
     From the multilingual corpus, we extracted 
a frequency list  for Tshivenda and Setswana. 
The next step was to compare the 5000 most 
frequent Tshivenda and Setswana words in the 
multilingual  African  wordlist  to  the  list  of 
(English)  base  and  core  concepts  mentioned 
above.  Table  4  below  shows  some  of  the 
concepts unique to the African language list. 
The  frequency  of  the  word   is  given  in 
brackets.

Table 4. Frequent nouns from a large multilingual 
African language corpus.

     It is clear that our frequency list includes 
concepts that reflect unique African language 
usage. The Princeton and EuroNets lists both 
include concepts that might not be completely 
unknown  in  an  African  context,  but  that 
certainly are less commonly used.  
     The new approach proposed in this third 
phase of the African Wordnets project entails 
extracting  a  subset  of  concepts  that  were 
present  in  this  list.  We  now  have  a  list  of 
concepts that are both internationally regarded 
and frequent in African corpora. This new list 
of roughly 1000 concepts was shared with the 
linguists as a starting point for Tshivenda. For 
the other four languages, we extracted the list 
of concepts that were not added in the previous 
projects  to  use  as  a  starting  point  for  new 
development in this phase. 

5 Conclusion and future work

5.1 Comparing  development  in  the  4 
languages
Figures 2 and 3 represent the total number of 
synsets  and  definitions  for  each  language 
combination. This comparative review gives a 
clear  indication  of  fast-tracking  possibilities 
for  each  language  by  using  the 
synsets/definitions  of  its  closely  related 
counterpart language. For example, synsets or 
definitions  developed for  isiZulu and not  for 
isiXhosa,  can  be  fast-tracked  for  the  latter 
since  both  languages  belong  to  the  Nguni 
language group, and vice versa. On the other 
hand,  synsets  or  definitions  developed  for 
Setswana  and  not  for  Sesotho  sa  Leboa 
(Sepedi), can be fast-tracked for the latter since 
both languages belong to the Sotho language 
group, and vice versa.

endeavours, it is essential that it be accessible 
to  all  researchers  in  the  field.  After  quality 
assurance (see section 4.2)  the wordnets will 
be included in the repository of the RMA, who 
will advertise and make available the wordnets 
for  others  to  use.  The  appropriate  licensing 
options and usage rights (most probably under 
one of the Creative Commons licenses8), will 
also  be  determined  in  conjunction  with  the 
RMA. 

5.3 Conclusion
The African Wordnet project is unique in its 
approach  to  create  wordnets  for  several 
languages  in  parallel,  resulting  in  a  very 
important  language  resource.   This  approach 
allows  team  members  to  share  experiences 
during the process and thus build the lexicon 
more  effectively.  It  also  allows  for  a 
multilingual  resource  that  can  be  applied  in 
various  other  technologies,  such  as  for 
machine  translation,  extracting  content  for 
learner's  dictionaries  and  other  teaching 
material, but also as a reference for linguists. 
There  is  still  much work to  be done,  but  by 
learning  from previous  projects  and  keeping 
the ultimate goal of a rich linguistc resource in 
mind,  we  trust  that  this  work  will  fill  many 
gaps in NLP in South Africa and Africa as a 
whole.
