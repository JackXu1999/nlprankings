Abstract

Monitoring patients in ICU is a challenging
and high-cost task. Hence, predicting the con-
dition of patients during their ICU stay can
help provide better acute care and plan the
hospital’s resources. There has been continu-
ous progress in machine learning research for
ICU management, and most of this work has
focused on using time series signals recorded
by ICU instruments. In our work, we show
that adding clinical notes as another modal-
ity improves the performance of the model
for three benchmark tasks: in-hospital mor-
tality prediction, modeling decompensation,
and length of stay forecasting that play an
important role in ICU management. While
the time-series data is measured at regular
intervals, doctor notes are charted at irreg-
ular times, making it challenging to model
them together. We propose a method to
model them jointly, achieving considerable
improvement across benchmark tasks over
baseline time-series model. Our implemen-
tation can be found at https://github.

1 Introduction

With the advancement of medical technology, pa-
tients admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU)
are monitored by different instruments on their
bedside, which measure different vital signals
about patient’s health. During their stay, doc-
tors visit the patient intermittently for check-ups
and make clinical notes about the patient’s health
and physiological progress. These notes can be
perceived as summarized expert knowledge about
the patient’s state. All these data about instru-
ment readings, procedures, lab events, and clin-
ical notes are recorded for reference. Availabil-
ity of ICU data and enormous progress in ma-
chine learning have opened up new possibilities
for health care research. Monitoring patients in
ICU is a challenging and high-cost task. Hence,

predicting the condition of patients during their
ICU stay can help plan better resource usage for
patients that need it most in a cost-effective way.
Prior works (Harutyunyan et al., 2019; Ghassemi
et al., 2015; Suresh et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018;
Caballero Barajas and Akella, 2015) have focused
exclusively on modeling the problem using the
time series signals from medical instruments. Ex-
pert knowledge from doctor’s notes has been ig-
nored in the literature.

In this work, we use clinical notes in addition
to the time-series data for improved prediction on
benchmark ICU management tasks (Harutyunyan
et al., 2019). While the time-series data is mea-
sured continuously, the doctor notes are charted at
intermittent times. This creates a new challenge
to model continuous time series and discrete-time
note events jointly. We propose such a multi-
modal deep neural network that comprises of re-
current units for the time-series and convolution
network for the clinical notes. We demonstrate
that adding clinical notes improves the perfor-
mance on in-hospital mortality prediction, model-
ing decompensation, and length of stay forecast-
ing tasks.

2 Related Work

We provide a review of machine learning ap-
proaches for clinical prediction tasks.

Biomedical natural language processing The
recent developments in deep learning-based tech-
niques for NLP have been adapted for clinical
notes. Convolutional neural networks have been
used to predict ICD codes from clinical texts (Mul-
lenbach et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Gangavarapu
et al., 2019). Rios and Kavuluru (2015) and Baker
et al. (2016) used convolutional neural networks
to classify various biomedical articles. Pre-trained
word and sentence embeddings have also shown
good results for sentence similarity tasks (Chen

et al., 2018). Recently, there is an interest in the
community to use clinical notes for ICU related
tasks (Jin et al., 2018; Boag et al., 2018; Liu et al.,
2019; Huang et al., 2019). Given the long struc-
tured nature of the clinical text, we prefer convo-
lutional neural networks over recurrent networks,
as demonstrated in previous studies (Zhang et al.,
2016; Boag et al., 2018). The work closest to ours
is Jin et al. (2018), who use an aggregated word
embeddings of clinical notes for in-hospital mor-
tality prediction.

ICU management related literature ICU man-
agement literature has focused exclusively on us-
ing time-series measurements for the prediction
tasks Harutyunyan et al. (2019); Ghassemi et al.
(2015); Suresh et al. (2018); Song et al. (2018);
Caballero Barajas and Akella (2015). Recurrent
neural networks have been models of choice for
these recent works, with additional gains from us-
ing attention or multi-task learning (Song et al.
(2018)). Xu et al. (2018) accommodated supple-
mental information like diagnosis, medications,
and lab events to improve model performance. We
use RNNs for modeling time-series in this work,
utilizing the setup identical to Harutyunyan et al.
(2019).

Multi-modal learning has shown success in
speech, natural language, and computer vision
(Ngiam et al. (2011), Mao et al. (2014)). Recently,
a lot of work has been done using images/videos
with natural language text (Elliott et al. (2016)).
We use a similar intuition for utilizing clinical
notes with time-series data for ICU management
tasks. In the next section, we define the three
benchmark tasks we evaluate in this work.

3 Prediction Tasks

We use the definitions of the benchmark tasks de-
fined by Harutyunyan et al. (2019) as the following
three problems:

1. In-hospital Mortality: This is a binary clas-
sification problem to predict whether a pa-
tient dies before being discharged from the
first two days of ICU data.

2. Decompensation: Focus is to detect patients
who are physiologically declining. Decom-
pensation is defined as a sequential prediction
task where the model has to predict at each
hour after ICU admission. Target at each
hour is to predict the mortality of the patient
within a 24 hour time window.

3. Length of Stay Forecasting (LOS): The
benchmark defines LOS as a prediction of
bucketed remaining ICU stay with a multi-
class classification problem. Remaining ICU
stay time is discretized into 10 buckets: {0−
1, 1− 2, 2− 3, 3− 4, 4− 5, 5− 6, 6− 7, 7−
8, 8− 14, 14+} days where first bucket, cov-
ers the patients staying for less than a day (24
hours) in ICU and so on. This is only done
for the patients that did not die in ICU.

These tasks have been identified as key perfor-
mance indicators of models that can be beneficial
in ICU management in the literature. Most of the
recent work has focused on using RNN to model
the temporal dependency of the instrument time
series signals for these tasks (Harutyunyan et al.
(2019), Song et al. (2018)).

4 Methods

In this section, we describe the models used in this
study. We start by introducing the notations used,
then describe the baseline architecture, and finally
present our proposed multimodal network.

For a patient’s length of ICU stay of T hours,
we have time series observations, xt at each time
step t (1 hour interval) measured by instruments
along with doctor’s note ni recorded at irregular
time stamps. Formally, for each patient’s ICU



6434

stay, we have time series data [xt]Tt=1 of length
T , and K doctor notes [Ni]Ki=1 charted at time
[TC(i)]Ki=1, where K is generally much smaller
than T . For in-hospital mortality prediction, m
is a binary label at t = 48 hours, which indi-
cates whether the person dies in ICU before be-
ing discharged. For decompensation prediction
performed hourly, [dt]Tt=5 are the binary labels at
each time step t, which indicates whether the per-
son dies in ICU within the next 24 hours. For
LOS forecasting also performed hourly, [lt]Tt=5 are
multi-class labels defined by buckets of the re-
maining length of stay of the patient in ICU. Fi-
nally, we denote NT as the concatenated doctor’s
note during the ICU stay of the patient (i.e.,, from
t = 1 to t = T ).

4.1 Baseline: Time-Series LSTM Model

Our baseline model is similar to the models de-
fined by Harutyunyan et al. (2019). For all the
three tasks, we used a Long Short Term Mem-
ory or LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)
network to model the temporal dependencies be-
tween the time series observations, [xt]Tt=1. At
each step, the LSTM composes the current in-
put xt with its previous hidden state ht−1 to gen-
erate its current hidden state ht; that is, ht =
LSTM(xt, ht−1) for t = 1 to t = T . The predic-
tions for the three tasks are then performed with
the corresponding hidden states as follows:

m̂ = sigmoid(Wmh48 + bm)

d̂t = sigmoid(Wdht + bd) for t = 5 . . . T

l̂t = softmax(Wlht + bl) for t = 5 . . . T

(1)

where m̂, d̂t, and l̂t are the probabilities for in-
hospital mortality, decompensation, and LOS, re-
spectively, andWm,Wd, andWl are the respective
weights of the fully-connected (FC) layer. Notice
that the in-hospital mortality is predicted at end of
48 hours, while the predictions for decompensa-
tion and LOS tasks are done at each time step after
first four hours of ICU stay. We trained the models
using cross entropy (CE) loss defined as below.

4.2 Multi-Modal Neural Network
In our multimodal model, our goal is to improve
the predictions by taking both the time series data
xt and the doctor notes ni as input to the network.

Convolutional Feature Extractor for Doctor
Notes. As shown in Fig. 2, we adopt a convo-
lutional approach similar to Kim (2014) to extract
the textual features from the doctor’s notes. For a
piece of clinical note N , our CNN takes the word
embeddings e = (e1, e2, . . . , en) as input and ap-
plies 1D convolution operations, followed by max-
pooling over time to generate a p dimensional fea-
ture vector ẑ, which is fed to the fully connected
layer along side the LSTM output from time series
signal (described in the next paragraph) for further
processing. From now onwards, we denote the 1D
convolution over note N as ẑ = Conv1D(N).

Model for In-Hospital Mortality. This model
takes the time series signals [xt]Tt=1 and all notes
[Ni]

K
i=1 to predict the mortality label m at t = T

(T = 48). For this, [xt]Tt=1 is processed through
an LSTM layer just like the baseline model in Sec.
4.1, and for the notes, we concatenate (⊗) all the
notes N1 to NK charted between t = 1 to t = T
to generate a single documentNT . More formally,

NT = N1 ⊗N2 ⊗ · · · ⊗NK
ht = LSTM(xt, ht−1) for t = 1 . . . T
ẑ = Conv1D(NT )
m̂ = sigmoid(W1h48 +W2ẑ + b)

We use pre-trained word2vec embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013) trained on both MIMIC-III
clinical notes and PubMed articles to initialize
our methods as it outperforms other embeddings
as shown in (Chen et al., 2018). We also freeze
the embedding layer parameters, as we did not
observe any improvement by fine-tuning them.

Model for Decompensation and Length of Stay.
Being sequential prediction problems, modeling
decompensation and length-of-stay requires spe-
cial technique to align the discrete text events to
continuous time series signals, measured at 1 event
per hour. Unlike in-hospital mortality, here we ex-
tract feature maps zi by processing each note Ni
independently using 1D convolution operations.
For each time step t = 1, 2 . . . T , let zt denote
the extracted text feature map to be used for pre-
diction at time step t. We compute zt as follows.

zi = Conv1D(Ni) for i = 1 . . .K
w(t, i) = exp[−λ ∗ (t− CT (i))]

zt =

whereM is the number of doctor notes seen before
time-step t, and λ is a decay hyperparameter tuned
on a validation data. Notice that zt is computed as
a weighted sum of the feature vectors, where the
weights are computed with an exponential decay
function. The intuition behind using a decay is
to give preference to recent notes as they better
describe the current state of the patient.

The time series data xt is modeled using an
LSTM as before. We concatenate the attenuated
output from the CNN with the LSTM output for
the prediction tasks as follows:

ht = LSTM(xt, ht−1)

d̂t = sigmoid(W 1d ht +W
2
d zt + b)

l̂t = softmax(W 1l ht +W
2
l zt + b)

(5)

Both our baselines and multimodal networks are
regularized using dropout and weight decay. We
used Adam Optimizer to train all our models.

5 Experiments

We used MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016) dataset
for all our experiments following Harutyunyan
et al. (2019)’s benchmark setup for processing the
time series signals from ICU instruments. We
use the same test-set defined in the benchmark
and 15% of remaining data as validation set. For
in-hospital mortality task, only those patients are
considered who were admitted in the ICU for at
least 48 hours. However, we dropped all clini-
cal notes which doesn’t have any chart time as-
sociated and also dropped all the patients with-
out any notes. Owing to this step, our results are
not directly comparable to the numbers reported
by Harutyunyan et al. (2019). Notes which have
been charted before ICU admission are concate-
nated and treated as one note at t = 1. After pre-
processing, the number of patients for in-hospital
mortality is 11,579 and 22,353 for the other two
tasks.

For in-hospital mortality task, best performing
baseline and multimodal network have 256 hidden
units LSTM cell. For convolution operation, we
used 256 filters for each of kernel size 2, 3 and
4. For decompensation and LOS prediction, we
used 64 hidden units for LSTM and 128 filters for
each 2,3 and 4 size convolution filters. The best
decay factor λ for text features was 0.01. We im-
plement our methods with TensorFlow Abadi et al.
(2015)1. All our models were regularized using
0.2 dropout and 0.01 weight decay coefficient. We
run the experiments 5 times with different initial-
ization and report the mean and standard devia-
tions.

6 Results

We use Area Under Precision-Recall (AUCPR)
metric for in-hospital mortality and decompensa-
tion tasks as they suffer from class imbalance with
only 10% patients suffering mortality, following
the benchmark. Davis and Goadrich (2006) sug-
gest AUCPR for imbalanced class problems. We
use Cohen’s linear weighted kappa, which mea-
sures the correlation between predicted and actual
multi-class buckets to evaluate LOS in accordance
with with Harutyunyan et al. (2019).

We compared the multimodal network with the
baseline time series LSTM models for all three
tasks. Results from our experiments are docu-
mented in Table 1. Our proposed multimodal net-

work outperforms the time series models for all
three tasks. For in-hospital mortality prediction,
we see an improvement of around 7.8% over the
baseline time series LSTM model. The other two
problems were more challenging itself than the
first task, and modeling the notes for the sequential
task was difficult. With our multimodal network,
we saw an improvement of around 6% and 3.5%
for decompensation and LOS, respectively.

We did not observe a change in perfor-
mance with respect to results reported in bench-
mark (Harutyunyan et al., 2019) study despite
dropping patients with no notes or chart time. In
order to understand the predictive power of clin-
ical notes, we also train text only models using
CNN part from our proposed model. Additionally,
we try average word embedding without CNN as
another method to extract feature from the text
as a baseline. Text-only-models perform poorly
compared to time-series baseline. Hence, text can
only provide additional predictive power on top of
time-series data.

7 Conclusion

Identifying the patient’s condition in advance is of
critical importance for acute care and ICU man-
agement. Literature has exclusively focused on

using time-series measurements from ICU instru-
ments to this end. In this work, we demonstrate
that utilizing clinical notes along with time-series
data can improve the prediction performance sig-
nificantly. In the future, we expect to improve
more using advanced models for the clinical notes
since text summarizes expert knowledge about a
patient’s condition.
