Abstract

We present an initial version of the Univer-
sal Dependencies (UD) treebank for Shipibo-
Konibo, the first South American, Amazonian,
Panoan and Peruvian language with a resource
built under UD. We describe the linguistic as-
pects of how the tagset was defined and the
treebank was annotated; in addition we present
our specific treatment of linguistic units called
clitics. Although the treebank is still under de-
velopment, it allowed us to perform a typolog-
ical comparison against Spanish, the predomi-
nant language in Peru, and dependency syntax
parsing experiments in both monolingual and
cross-lingual approaches.

1 Introduction and Background

Shipibo-Konibo is a language of the Panoan fam-
ily spoken by around 35,000 native speakers in the
Amazon region of Peru. It is a language with ag-
glutinative processes, with a majority presence of
suffixes and some clitics (neither a word nor an af-
fix). Additionally, it presents word orders different
from the dominant Spanish language.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no other
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks for an in-
digenous language of South America, as surveyed
by Mager et al. (2018). The closest resource is a
treebank developed for a Quechuan variant; how-
ever, it was not designed under the UD guide-
lines (Rios et al., 2008). Another related case is
the application of UD for the annotation of the
native North American language Arapaho (Algo-
nquian) (Wagner et al., 2016). Thus, Shipibo-
Konibo would be the first South American indige-
nous language with this kind of computational re-
source1.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) efforts for
Shipibo-Konibo have developed a POS-tagger, a

1The treebank will be available for the next UD release

lemmatizer, a spell-checker, and a machine trans-
lation prototype with Spanish as the paired lan-
guage (Mager et al., 2018). Each functionality has
been published alongside its annotated corpus. A
UD treebank would enhance the NLP toolkit for
the language, as it is the core element for being
able to train a dependency parser.

This paper describes the steps and decisions
made towards a UD treebank for Shipibo-Konibo.
First, §2 presents the annotation process. Then,
§3 details the information of the UD treebank it-
self, such as the POS tags, morphological features
and dependency relations, including the specific
ones for Shipibo-Konibo. Moreover, it describes
relevant decisions regarding clitics and word seg-
mentation, including an analysis of the generated
multiword tokens. Finally, we take advantage of
the built treebank, and perform a typological com-
parison against Spanish in §4, as well as depen-
dency parsing tests for monolingual and cross-
lingual scenarios in §5.

2 Treebank Annotation

The annotation workflow of the Universal Depen-
dencies (UD) treebank for Shipibo-Konibo is de-
scribed in §2.1. In particular, specific consider-
ation has been given for word segmentation with
respect to clitics, which is detailed in §2.2.

2.1 Annotation Workflow

Annotation followed a sequential flow:

1. To annotate Shipibo-Konibo corpus in
ChAnot (Mercado et al., 2018) and
BRAT (Stenetorp et al., 2012). The for-
mer tool was specifically used for the
morpheme segmentation of raw text into
prefixes, root morphemes and suffixes in ap-
propriate morphological detail. The provided
interface with BRAT allows the graphical



152

annotation of syntactic information over
the segmentation. We used part of speech
and relation names determined prior to the
decision to conform to UD v2.0.

2. To compile segmented corpus into UD v2.0
format: Gather all annotations from ChAnot
and BRAT into single file in UD v2.0 format.
Compress detail segmentation of prefixes and
suffixes to only segment on clitic boundaries.
Add clitic features, and convert non-standard
to UD v2.0 standard universal POS and de-
pendency relation notation.

2.2 Clitics and Segmentation

In terms of its morphological profile, Shipibo-
Konibo favors synthetic word formations. That is,
in Shipibo-Konibo, words are often composed of a
root and one or more bound morphemes. Some of
these morphemes may be considered clitics, lin-
guistic elements that do not fit either the proto-
type of word or that of affix. Similar elements
are labelled particles in the Universal Dependen-
cies tradition, but we prefer clitics, following the
arguments presented in Zwicky (1977, 1985). In
the Panoan literature, these intermediate linguis-
tic units have also been called clitics (Fleck, 2013;
Valenzuela, 2003; Zariquiey, 2015), so we con-
sider it appropriate to follow this terminology in
the development of our Shipibo-Konibo treebank.

As clitics, these linguistic units exhibit some
features that resemble those attested in words.
This intermediate nature clashes with the di-
chotomic division between morphology and syn-
tax, in which linguistic units belong to one of
these domains (see Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002);
Haspelmath (2011) for discussion).

Taking all this into consideration, we have made
the methodological decision of treating clitics as
independent syntactic words. Therefore, the rela-
tionships between words and clitics is rendered as
syntactic and is annotated by means of the appro-
priate dependency. All clitics in Shipibo-Konibo
are phrasal in nature and treating them as indepen-
dent words captures this in a more precise way (al-
though annotation may be more time-consuming).
In section 2.3 we present some examples.

Furthermore, following the principles for tok-
enizing a surface word into multiple inflectional
groups (IGs) proposed by Çöltekin (2016, p. 2),
we segment clitics as independent words because
they and their host may participate in different

syntactic relations. For instance, in the Shipibo-
Konibo sentence ea=ra joke (I came), ea is the
pronoun (I) in a dependency of nsubj from the
verb joke (came), whereas =ra is an evidential
clitic in the dependency of aux:valid.

Languages with similar morphological profiles
have treebanks in Universal Dependencies, such as
Finnish (Pyysalo et al., 2015), Turkish (Sulubacak
et al., 2016) or Kazakh (Tyers and Washington,
2015). Nevertheless, those treebanks do not tend
to systematically label bound morphemes as inde-
pendent words, as we aim to do in the development
of our treebank because of the reasons mentioned
above.

2.3 Language Examples

We present two Shipibo-Konibo sentences in an-
ticipation of further discussion.

The sentence Jatianra en ja maxko bake pan-
shin kírika menike (So, I give this little boy a yel-
low book) in Figure 1 presents a ditransitive verb
with direct and indirect objects. The clitic =ra has
an evidential function, hence it projects the de-
pendency relation aux:valid to the main verb
menike (gave). The clitic =n expresses nominal
case and projects to the token’s core word. In
Shipibo-Konibo, adjectives tend to precede nomi-
nal heads, with determiners preceding both adjec-
tives and nominal heads as shown in the phrase ja
maxko bake.

The sentence Joninronki yoyo aká iki: “Jen,
enra moa onanke” (They say the man said, "Ah,
I already knew that") in Figure 2 presents a direct
speech construction showing two main verbs, each
one with a evidentiality clitic. There are two mul-
tiword tokens with three syntactic words each, joni
=n =ronki and e =n =ra.

3 Shipibo-Konibo Treebank

Our current Shipibo-Konibo treebank is the result
of the syntactic annotation of 407 sentences ex-
tracted from parallel Shipibo-Konibo and Span-
ish educational materials and storybooks – com-
plemented with elicited sentences produced and
translated by the Shipibo-Konibo members of our
team. This is a small treebank with work still on-
going (Table 1).

3.1 Typological features of Shipibo-Konibo

stituent order (Figures 1 & 2), but it exhibits other

pragmatically conditioned orders. NP-modifiers
often precede their head (Figure 1) and verbs do
not show either subject or object cross-reference.

As this is first treebank for any South-American
indigenous language, there could well be novel
grammatical features of Shipibo-Konibo not in-
cluded in any other treebanks.

3.2 Universal Part of Speech (POS) Tags

Universal Dependencies (UD) introduces a tagset
of 17 POS tags, mainly based in the Google uni-
versal part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2012). All
of them have been employed in the development of
the Shipibo-Konibo treebank. The POS tags and
frequencies in the treebank are shown in table 2.

The POS tag X is used for labelling ono-
matopoeia, which is a relevant POS in var-
ious Panoan languages, including Shipibo-
Konibo (Valenzuela, 2003; Zariquiey, 2015,
2011). UD does not have an onomatopoeia POS
tag. Hence, we opted to use X to label it. In
other treebanks, onomatopoeias were ascribed
to different POS tags. For example, Badmaeva
(2016) in her “Universal Dependencies for
Buryat” states that “the case of onomatopoeia
is also an interjection” (2016, p. 40). However,

onomatopoeias in Shipibo-Konibo are members
of a special closed part of speech. They are used
in combination with semantically generic verbs
or auxiliaries as a productive strategy in order
to form new words. Therefore, we considered
it appropriate to label them as a different and
independent POS.

As discussed in §2.2, Shipibo-Konibo clitics are
a special type of linguistic unit that ought to be
treated as an independent POS. Since Universal
Dependencies does not present a clitic POS tag,
but it does present a particle POS tag, PART, we
opted to treat the Shipibo-Konibo clitics as parti-
cles, since clitics are often called particles (§2.2).
These linguistic units are divided into three dif-
ferent categories: nominal clitic (expressing case
and only used with nominal phrases), second po-
sition clitics (mainly expressing evidentiality and
following the first constituent of a sentence), and
less-fixed clitics (expressing adverbial value and
used with any kind of POS). In this sense, it is im-
portant to remark that we are not considering them
as adpositions ADP, since they belong to a closed
set of items that occur before (preposition) or after
(postposition) a complement composed of a noun
phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as
a noun phrase. Thus, they form a single struc-
ture with the complement to express its grammat-
ical and semantic relation to another unit within a
clause.

The high PART frequency noted in table 2 could
impact performance in tasks as part-of-speech tag-
ging or even syntax dependency parsing if it would
require prior POS tag information. This was dis-



154

cussed and analyzed by Endresen et al. (2016) in
a Russian corpus. We believe it will be important
to measure whether the impact would be positive
or negative in morphosyntactic tasks for Shipibo-
Konibo as well, and thus, we would like to extend
the discussion to a multilingual approach as fur-
ther work.

3.3 Universal Morphological Features

The universal morphological features of UD are
based on Zeman (2008)’s “Reusable tagset con-
version using tagset drivers” with the concept of
an expandable feature structure that could sup-
port any tagset. Tagset labels aim to “distinguish
additional lexical and grammatical properties of
words, not covered by the POS tags” (Nivre et al.,
2017). A list of the morphological features and
values used in the Shipibo-Konibo treebank anno-
tation are given in Table 3; most are already de-
fined in Universal Dependencies. The few mor-
phological features of Shipibo-Konibo that require
labels not currently in Universal Dependencies are
underlined in Table 3.

The new morphological features are further de-
fined below.

motion, going (andative) versus coming (ven-
itive). Although there is literature arguing
that associated motion should be treated as an
independent grammatical category, the inter-
action between associated motion and aspect
is well known (Guillaume, 2009).

Case=Chez Valenzuela defines a chezative case,
which can be translated as “to/at the place
where X is/lives” (2003, p. 232). Shipibo-
Konibo encodes this case with the clitic -ibá
∼ -ibat.

Mood=Int Questions in Shipibo-Konibo are
encoded by bound morphemes which
are labeled by the dependency relation
aux:valid (see §3.4.1).

Tense=Past1, Past2, Past3, Past4, Past5, Past6
Shipibo-Konibo presents six productive
past categories. These tense categories are
expressed by verbal bound morphemes.
These features are presented in Table 4.

Tense=Fut1, Fut2 Shipibo-Konibo also has two
different classes of future tense, expressed by
bound morphemes. These features are also
presented in Table 4.

Clitic=Nomcl, Spcl, Lfcl In §3.2 we introduced
clitics with the PART POS tag, while also
defining the three clitic categories as nom-
inal clitic (Nomcl), second position clitic
(Spcl), and less-fixed clitic (Lfcl).

Features currently annotated in the Shipibo-
Konibo treebank are shown in Table 5. These

3.4 Dependency Relations

UD defines a set of 37 dependency relations,
mainly based on “Universal Stanford Dependen-
cies: A cross-linguistic typology” by Marneffe
et al. (2014). Thirty-one of these 37 relations were
employed in our Shipibo-Konibo treebank. One of
the main characteristics of UD is that relations link
content words rather than abstract nodes, i.e., lex-
icalism (Nivre et al., 2017). Dependency relations
and frequencies in the treebank are reported in Ta-
ble 6. It is worth mentioning that the frequency of
acl and ccomp relation labels is low due to the
choice of annotated sentences rather than a spe-
cific property of the language.

Shipibo-Konibo specific relations

While UD aims to provide “a universal inven-
tory of categories and guidelines to facilitate con-
sistent annotation of similar constructions across
languages” (Nivre et al., 2017), it also allows
language-specific subtype relation labels when
necessary. For the Shipibo-Konibo treebank, we
considered the inclusion of two new subtype rela-
tion labels: aux:valid and compound:onom.

Table 6: Dependency Relations

3.4.1 Relation subtype - aux:valid
An auxiliary is an element that may express differ-
ent grammatical categories such as time, aspect,
mood, voice and evidentiality. In Shipibo-Konibo,
evidentiality and mood are expressed through a
subset of clitics. These clitics are ascribed to the
relation aux, but in order to distinguish them from
verbal auxiliaries, they receive the subtype relation
label val. This subcategory refers to the notion of
validator, as defined by Cerrón-Palomino (2008,
p. 166) for Quechua. For example, the sentence
Enra yapa yoá akai (I cook fish) uses the first-hand
evidentiality clitic =ra (Valenzuela, 2003, p. 534)
to express that the speaker witnessed the event.
See Figures 1 & 2 for more examples.

Note the high frequency of use for aux:valid
shown in Table 6. At 176 instances, 5.6% of all
syntactic words, almost half of Shipibo-Konibo
sentences would include an expression of eviden-
tiality (given seldom more than one aux:valid
is used per sentence). This high frequency expres-
sion of evidentiality is an intriguing linguistic phe-



156

nomenon and worth further study.

3.4.2 Relation subtype - compound:onom
Similar to other languages of the Panoan lan-
guage family, in Shipibo-Konibo, onomatopoeias
are considered as a closed word class (Valenzuela,
2003). In this language there are constructions that
include two semantically generic verbs: ati (do) or
iti (be) (Valenzuela, 2003, p. 83). These elements
may be combined with onomatopoeias in order to
create a type of compound verb.

We decided to use the subtype relation la-
bel compound:onom for those specific types
of compound verbs. For example, the verb
yoyo iti (to speak) corresponds to a compound
formed by the verb iti (be) and the onomatopoeia
yoyo (speech noise). In spite of the fact that they
are two differentiated entities, both elements con-
stitute a unit at the semantic level, and therefore
are compounds in Universal Dependencies. See
Figure 2 as another example.

There is a significant use of compounds, 46 in-
stances and 1.5% of syntactic words (Table 6),
but only a few are due to onomatopoeia. While
deemed important in the language, onomatopoeias
have low frequency representation in the current
instance of the treebank.

3.5 Segmentation and Multiword Tokens

Our decision to split orthographic tokens on clitic
boundaries in §2.2 results in an abundance of mul-
tiple syntactic word tokens (Table 7) with 402
multiword tokens (MWTs) of 2706 total tokens.
The clitic of second position, Spcl, invokes the
dependency relation aux:valid typically with
the clausal head and not with the core word of the
MWT. The nominal clitic, Nomcl, invokes the de-
pendency relation case with the core word of the
MWT.

The cases where a token contains multiple cli-
tics, the Spcl comes later. This has the effect of
preserving projectivity. We continue to follow this
issue of multiple clitic MWTs and projectivity.

3.6 Multiword Tokens vs Other Languages

Indeed, Shipibo-konibo has proportionally many
more Multiword tokens (MWTs) than Spanish or
Turkish, a language considered agglutinative, but
less than Hebrew. Table 8 shows the differences
where ∼15% of Shipibo-Konibo tokens are multi-
word versus ∼3% for Turkish, much less for Span-
ish, and ∼32% for Hebrew.

Num words 3 40

Table 7: Multiword Tokens

The big differences in MWT relative frequency
is surprising given the UD documentation’s ex-
plicit encouragement to use MWTs for annotat-
ing clitics (Universal Dependencies contributors,
2018). Our decision to segment tokens by phrasal
clitic boundaries likely explains part of this large
difference versus even other agglutinative lan-
guages.

4 Word Order vs Spanish

We examined word order differences between the
dominant Spanish and Shipibo-Konibo. Span-
ish results are from the training set of the Es-
Ancora treebank (Martínez Alonso and Zeman,
2017), while Shipibo-Konibo results are from our
treebank. Table 9 reports counts and relative fre-
quencies of a constituent preceding its head. Con-
stituents are reported either by their dependency
relation with their head or POS in the case of
single syntactic word constituents. Relative fre-
quency of following the head is just the comple-
ment of that of preceding the head.

Direct and oblique objects usually follow the
head (typically a verb) in Spanish and precede
the head in Shipibo-konibo. Auxiliary verbs usu-
ally precede the head in Spanish and follow the



157

head in Shipibo-Konibo. Spanish uses preposi-
tions and Shipibo-Konibo postpositions, but de-
terminers precede their heads in both languages.
Similar differences and similarities follow for the
less common constituents as well.

Table 9: Phrase or word order - Shipibo vs Spanish

Full confirmation of Shipibo-Konibo features
versus the WALS database (Dryer and Haspel-
math, 2013) awaits further progress. But a re-
view of word order from Table 9 versus WALS
largely confirms comparable word order features
in WALS. An exception is adjective and noun
head order. Our corpus shows ∼75% adjective
preceding head (∼80% for adjective preceding
noun head). So adjective precedes noun head or-
der dominates versus the earlier finding by Faust
(1973) reported in WALS of no dominant order.

5 Parsing for Shipibo-Konibo

Dependency syntax parsing is a complex task that
usually requires a lot of annotated data, thus we
decided to perform experiments in two different
scenarios. The first one treats the treebank as
an isolated corpus using monolingual methods,
whereas the second one presents a cross-lingual
experiment to identify which other languages from
the UD v2.0 collection can support the parsing
task for Shipibo-Konibo.

5.1 Monolingual Parsing

A straightforward test was performed using a
greedy transition-based parser (Parsito) (Straka
et al., 2015) from UDPipe (Straka and Straková,
2017) and the Yara Parser (Rasooli and Tetreault,
2015), which is also a transition-based method but
uses beam search. The obtained results with 10-
fold cross-validation are presented in Table 10,
where we perform parses with POS gold annota-
tions and raw text.

Input Parser UAS LAS
Gold

Parsito 83.66±4.12 77.81±4.33

Parsito 37.68±1.23 30.39±1.34
Yara 42.15±6.20 29.19±3.90

Table 10: Monolingual parsing accuracy for un-
labeled (UAS) and labeled (LAS) attachment with
gold POS tags and raw text as inputs

With the gold annotations, UAS and LAS scores
from Parsito are greater than the language average
of 78.59% and 72.81%, respectively, from Straka
and Straková (2017); and the Yara Parser provides
slightly better results in most cases. The low dif-
ference may be caused by the different search ap-
proaches (greedy versus global beam search) in
the transition-based parsers. Meanwhile, parsing
raw text scored much worse, which was expected
for the corpus size. However, most of the cross-
validation results has presented high variance; and
thus, these results must not be treated as definitive
ones, and only as a reference, as there could be
overfitting and scarcity issues.

5.2 Cross-Lingual Parsing

We conducted an experiment with single-source
cross-lingual delexicalized parser transfer from
the UD v2.0 source languages into Shipibo-
Konibo as the target language, in the vein of Ze-
man and Resnik (2008).

In the experiment, we used the mate-tools
graph-based parser by Bohnet (2010) with default
settings. The entire Shipibo-Konibo treebank was
our test set. We tagged the treebank for POS using
MarMoT (Mueller et al., 2013) via 10-fold cross-
validation with a mean accuracy of 93.94±1.38
(s.d.). As we performed delexicalized transfer,
all training and test data used only the following
CoNLL-U features: ID, POS, HEAD, and DE-

Table 11: Cross-lingual parsing accuracy (UAS)
for single-source delexicalized transfer parsers
with Shipibo-Konibo as the target language. The
source treebanks and their codes are from UD
v2.0.

PREL. Yet, to avoid any dependency label incon-
sistencies since our treebank is small, we evalu-
ated for UAS only. We excluded all multiword
tokens from the experiment, while retaining their
respective syntactic words. A single delexicalized
parser was trained for each UD v2.0 source tree-
bank and applied on the Shipibo-Konibo test data.

Table 11 presents the results of the trans-
fer parsing experiment. We achieve by far the
best parsing results via the Kazakh delexicalized
parser (66% UAS), closely followed by Japanese
(63%), Basque and Turkish (ca 59%), and then
Tamil, Persian, and Hindi (57%). Specifically,
Kazakh presents morphosyntactic features simi-
lar to Shipibo-Konibo, such as SOV word or-
der, high presence of agglutinative suffixes and
head-final directionality (Mukhamedova, 2015).
Moreover, the results are interesting as the top-
performing cluster of sources for Shipibo-Konibo
comprises languages that mainly feature as out-
liers in most cross-lingual parsing research, ow-
ing to the strong mainstream bias towards exper-
imenting with resource-rich languages, as argued
by Agić et al. (2016).

To further support our findings, we correlate
the cross-lingual parsing UAS scores with lan-
guage similarity of UD v2.0 source languages
to Shipibo-Konibo. We express language sim-
ilarity as pairwise Hamming distance between
WALS vectors (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)
for Shipibo-Konibo and the respective UD v2.0
source languages similar to Agić (2017). We de-
pict this set of results in Figure 3, where we show
a moderate negative correlation (Spearman’s ρ =
−0.43) between UAS and WALS distance, that

is unlikely to be random at p < 0.05. In other
words, the source languages that are more simi-
lar to Shipibo-Konibo in terms of WALS are more
likely to provide Shipibo-Konibo with good delex-
icalized parsers. That said, some of the best source
parsers are outliers in the figure: Kazakh and
Basque yield good parsers for Shipibo-Konibo,
but their WALS distance to it is large. This is due
to the sparsity of WALS features for these lan-
guages: for example, 183 of 202 WALS features
are null for Kazakh, and 188 for Basque, but only
41 for Japanese. Fixing these WALS feature de-
ficiencies would in turn arguably strengthen the
correlations to further support our findings. Be-
sides, this analysis could be complemented by us-
ing a subset of WALS features that are generally
available, as well as by inferring empty Kazakh
features from related languages in the Kypchak
group.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We’ve presented Shipibo-Konibo from the Ama-
zon region of Peru and our ample progress in
building a treebank conforming to Universal De-
pendencies v2.0. We argued for segmenting syn-
tactic words (versus tokens) along phrasal clitic
boundaries and provided parse examples of this.

While our treebank is still a work in progress
with 407 sentences, we’ve learned much already



159

about what distinguishes us from other languages
and treebanks. Segmenting on phrasal clitics and
POS tagging as PART resulted in a phenomenal
14% of clitics tagged as PART in our treebank, fol-
lowing only PUNCT, NOUN, VERB in popularity.

Several morphological features were added to
account for past and future verb tenses, And and
Ven aspects, Chez case, and Nomcl, Spcl, and
Lfcl clitics. Each of these additions matters in
the meaningful annotation of Shipibo-Konibo.

We considered two new dependency relation
subtypes: aux:valid and compound:onom.
The aux:valid relation occurred 176 times
(5.6% of words and almost half of sentences). This
high use evidentiality function invites further lin-
guistic study.

By segmenting on phrasal clitics Shipibo-
Konibo stands out in its use of multiword to-
kens (MWTs) including both two and three word
MWTs. The Spcl clitic usually projects to the
verbal head, but since it succeeds other clitics,
projectivity is preserved. Shipibo-Konibo has a
huge fives times as many MWTs (∼15% versus
∼3% for Turkish) versus other (agglutinative) lan-
guages.

Word order of Shipibo-Konibo versus Spanish
reveals dramatic differences, which informs our
work on machine translation between them. We
largely confirmed WALS word order features for
Shipibo-Konibo, except for our finding that adjec-
tive precedes noun is dominant as opposed to no
dominant order as reported in WALS.

Results on a monolingual parser show promise
with better than the language average performance
for gold POS tags. Delexicalized cross-lingual
parsing using parsers trained on all UD v2.0 tree-
banks, showed a maximum 66% unlabeled attach-
ment score (UAS) for Kazakh, a language with
similar morphosyntactic features, followed closely
by Japanese at 63%. A plot of UAS versus Ham-
ming distance from WALS vectors reveals the
expected inverse correlation between WALS dis-
tance and UAS (lesser WALS distance related to
higher UAS). Japanese showed a low WALS dis-
tance and a high UAS, but Kazakh showed both
high WALS distance and high UAS (seemingly an
outlier).

As future work, we will increase the size of
the UD treebank, as well as annotate the morpho-
logical features in a semi-supervised way. There
has been developed an FSM-based morphologi-

cal analyzer (Cardenas Acosta and Zeman, 2018)
that could support the annotation for that purpose.
Moreover, as Shipibo-Konibo is one of many in
the Panoan linguistic family, the next step would
be the definition of the UD tagsets and guidelines
for closely related languages, such as Iskonawa or
Amawaka. We hope these efforts could extend
language technologies development for minority
languages in Peru.
