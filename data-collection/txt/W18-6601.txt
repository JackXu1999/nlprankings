Abstract

This paper is an introduction to The 3rd
Workshop on Computational Creativity in
Language Generation (CC-NLG 2018),
collocated with The 11th International
Conference on Natural Language Gener-
ation (INLG 2018). The workshop acts as
an overview of projects from the Compu-
tational Creativity field present within the
general field of Natural Language Genera-
tion, and references further reviews within
the area. Accepted papers to the work-
shop will use contemporary NLG meth-
ods or approach NLG problems from a
creative perspective. The workshop in-
tends to showcase creative applications as
a worthwhile and meaningful pursuit to
other NLG researchers.

1 Introduction

This short paper will introduce the workshop
Computational Creativity in Natural Language
Generation (CCNLG), and point to a limited por-
tion of the field that surrounds it. CCNLG is
intended as a discussion of recent advancements
within Computational Creativity (CC) that are rel-
evant to the field of Natural Language Gener-
ation (NLG), or utilize NLG methods. Collo-
cated with The International Conference on Natu-
ral Language Generation (INLG), it also attempts
to showcase how creative applications can utilise
innovative NLG methods toward novel applica-
tions. This paper acts as brief introduction for re-
searchers from outside the CC field.
Language has sat at the core of CC research
since the field’s origins. NLG projects by Mee-
han, Gervas, Colton, and Veale are key exam-
ples of CC, as well as methodological corner-
stones to researchers finding their way in a theo-

retically nuanced arena. In turn, language genera-
tion projects have become key reference points to
CC researchers working in other application areas.
In short, Computational Creativity within Natural
Language Generation is by no means an under-
developed research trajectory; however, research
comes from a broad range of venues and events,
and there is a lack of discussion for concerns spe-
cific to the field itself. Conferences that have
hosted CCNLG research include, INLG, The con-
ferences of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (ACl, nAC-ACL, EACL), the Inter-
national Conference on Computational Creativity
(ICCC), as well as its predecessor workshops at
ECAI, IJCAI, ECCBR and ICCBR, various AISB
symposia on creativity and poetry, Computational
models of Narrative workshop, International Con-
ference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, the In-
telligent Narrative Technologies workshop series.
In recent years NLG has become relevant to the
general public through creative application in dia-
logues systems, chatbots, and twitter bots. These
widely available tasks have thrown creative lan-
guage generation into the public eye, opening up
a broad base of possible users. Typically though,
NLG has been used by CC researchers in three
formal areas; story generation, poetry generation,
and joke generation. That said, CC researchers
have used NLG in many applications from recipe
to lyric generation. As well as introducing appli-
cation within CC in NLG, this paper will also ref-
erence relevant literature reviews that support the
workshop.

2 Story Generation

Stories are a fundamental part of creative writing,
and have been generated by CC researchers for
decades [3]. Furthermore, narratives are a crucial
part of language outside of formal stories, and re-

searchers have used NLG to produce informal sto-
ries [4].
An early example of creative story generation
is TALE-SPIN, which generated Aesop’s Fa-
bles based on the user’s input (Meehan, 1977).
The user was asked a series a questions during
creation, that TALE-SPIN combined with prior
knowledge on story attributes to generate a tale.
The user could also chose from a set of morals,
like “never trust flatterers”, which the system
would then attempt to communicate through the
story. In essence, TALE-SPIN was a goal based
problem solving system, that saw the attributes
of the proposed Aesop fable as a problem, that it
could solve via the inclusion of the correct knowl-
edge pieces in a story. Also using a knowledge
based approach, Universe by Michaeal Lebowitz
draws on a database of character definitions and
plot outlines to create stories around a user pro-
posed theme [10]. McIntyre and Lapata devel-
oped one of the first search-based narrative sys-
tems that used user-input to search a database for
relating phrases [12]. Gervas 2009 gives a detailed
overview of story generation advancements from
1974 to 2009 [8].

3 Poetry Generation

Poems are an important part of how humans use
language to be creative. Outside of formal poetry,
from metaphor to analogy, poetic language litters
our public and personal communication. The ear-
liest examples of autonomous poetry can be traced
back to Oulipo’s lo-fi assemblages of text from ex-
isting poems. But it is with Manarung, Gervas,
and Colton at the turn of the century that systems
used fundamentally poetic properties, like rhyme
and meter, to move beyond the experimental and
arbitrary combination of language [5, 7, 11]. For
an expanded review of poetry generation, look to
Gonçalo Oliveira 2017 [9].

4 Joke Generation

Joke generation has been one of the most fervent
areas of NLG within CC. Researchers initially fo-
cused on pun generation, where knowledge inten-
sive protocols were used to align contrary antithe-
ses and comparisons (Binsted and Ritchie, 1994;
Shah, 2016)[1, 13]. In more recent years re-
searchers have moved on to broader and more so-
phisticated levels or humoristic language, where
structure is less forgiving [2, 13]. Also falling

under joke generation, Oliveira’s meme genera-
tor exploits the formalities of the medium within
a working system.[9]. For a survey of joke gen-
eration, look to Section 6 of Gatt and Krahmer’s
2017 book chapter, which is also a valuable study
of NLG more broadly, and highlights the value in
connections between CC and NLG [6].

5 Conclusion

CCNLG is a recently initiated workshop within
the shifting field of NLG, that serves to expose
macro trajectories for creative projects, and dis-
cuss their merit on formal and theoretical levels.
At a juncture of two fields, CCNLG sits in a chal-
lenging yet interesting location, where researchers
can take advantage of a broad set of innovative
methods and perplexing applications. However,
the end tasks – joke, story, or poetry generation –
hold established bodies of literature and rich his-
tories; it is therefore crucial that we are aware of
this work as we look forward.
