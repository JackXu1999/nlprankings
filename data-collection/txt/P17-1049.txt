Abstract

Translation has played an important role
in trade, law, commerce, politics, and lit-
erature for thousands of years. Transla-
tors have always tried to be invisible; ideal
translations should look as if they were
written originally in the target language.
We show that traces of the source lan-
guage remain in the translation product to
the extent that it is possible to uncover the
history of the source language by looking
only at the translation. Specifically, we au-
tomatically reconstruct phylogenetic lan-
guage trees from monolingual texts (trans-
lated from several source languages). The
signal of the source language is so power-
ful that it is retained even after two phases
of translation. This strongly indicates that
source language interference is the most
dominant characteristic of translated texts,
overshadowing the more subtle signals of
universal properties of translation.

1 Introduction

Translation has played a major role in human civ-
ilization since the rise of law, religion, and trade
in multilingual societies. Evidence of scribe trans-
lations goes as far back as four millennia ago, to
the time of Hammurabi; this practice is also men-
tioned in the Bible (Esther 1:22; 8:9). For thou-
sands of years, translators have tried to remain in-
visible, setting a standard according to which the
act of translation should be seamless, and its prod-
uct should look as if it were written originally in
the target language. Cicero (106-43 BC) com-
mented on his translation ethics, “I did not hold
it necessary to render word for word, but I pre-
served the general style and force of the language.”
These words were echoed 500 years later by St.

Jerome (347-420 CE), also known as the patron
saint of translators, who wrote, “I render, not word
for word, but sense for sense.” Translator tendency
for invisibility has peaked in the past 150 years
in the English speaking world (Venuti, 2008), in
spite of some calls for “foreignization” in trans-
lations, e.g., the German Romanticists, especially
the translations from Greek by Friedrich Hölderlin
(Steiner, 1975) and Nabokov’s translation of Eu-
gene Onegin. These, however, as both Steiner
(1975) and Venuti (2008) argue, are the exception
to the rule. In fact, in recent years, the quality of
translations has been standardized (ISO 17100).
Importantly, the translations we studied in our
work conform to this standard.

Despite the continuous efforts of translators,
translations are known to feature unique character-
istics that set them apart from non-translated texts,
referred to as originals here (Toury, 1980, 1995;
Frawley, 1984; Baker, 1993). This is not the re-
sult of poor translation, but rather a statistical phe-
nomenon: various features distribute differently in
originals than in translations (Gellerstam, 1986).

Several factors may account for the differences
between originals and translations; many are clas-
sified as universal features of translation. Cog-
nitively speaking, all translations, regardless of
the source and target language, are susceptible to
the same constraints. Therefore, translation prod-
ucts are expected to share similar artifacts. Such
universals include simplification: the tendency to
make complex source structures simpler in the tar-
get (Blum-Kulka and Levenston, 1983; Vander-
auwerea, 1985); standardization: the tendency to
over-conform to target language standards (Toury,
1995); and explicitation: the tendency to render
implicit source structures more explicit in the tar-
get language (Blum-Kulka, 1986; Øverås, 1998).

In contrast to translation universals, interfer-
ence reflects the “fingerprints” of the source lan-

530

guage on the translation product. Toury (1995)
defines interference as “phenomena pertaining to
the make-up of the source text tend to be trans-
ferred to the target text”. Interference, by def-
inition, is a language-pair specific phenomenon;
isomorphic structures shared by the source and
target languages can easily replace one another,
thereby manifesting the underlying process of
cross-linguistic influence of the source language
on the translation outcome. Pym (2008) points out
that interference is a set of both segmentational
and macrostructural features.

Our main hypothesis is that, due to interference,
languages with shared isomorphic structures are
likely to share more features in the target language
of a translation. Consequently, the distance be-
tween two languages, when assessed using such
features, can be retained to some extent in trans-
lations from these two languages to a third one.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that by extracting
structures from translated texts, we can generate a
phylogenetic tree that reflects the “true” distances
among the source languages. Finally, we conjec-
ture that the quality of such trees will improve
when constructed using features that better corre-
spond to interference phenomena, and will deteri-
orate using more universal features of translation.

The main contribution of this paper is thus
the demonstration that interference phenomena in
translation are powerful to an extent that facilitates
clustering source languages into families and (par-
tially) reconstructing intra-families ties; so much
so, that these results hold even after two rounds of
translation. Moreover, we perform analysis of var-
ious linguistic phenomena in the source languages,
laying out quantitative grounds for the language
typology reconstruction results.

2 Related work

A number of works in historical linguistics have
applied methods from the field of bioinformat-
ics, in particular algorithms for generating phylo-
genetic trees (Ringe et al., 2002; Nakhleh et al.,
2005a,b; Ellison and Kirby, 2006; Boc et al.,
2010). Most of them rely on lists of cognates,
words in multiple languages with a common origin
that share a similar meaning and a similar pronun-
ciation (Dyen et al., 1992; Rexová et al., 2003).
These works all rely on multilingual data, whereas
we construct phylogenetic trees from texts in a sin-
gle language.

The claim that translations exhibit unique prop-
erties is well established in translation studies lit-
erature (Toury, 1980; Frawley, 1984; Baker, 1993;
Toury, 1995). Based on this assumption, sev-
eral works use text classification techniques em-
ploying supervised, and recently also unsuper-
vised, machine learning approaches, to distinguish
between originals and translations (Baroni and
Bernardini, 2006; Ilisei et al., 2010; Koppel and
Ordan, 2011; Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich
and Wintner, 2015; Avner et al., 2016). The fea-
tures used in these studies reflect both universal
and interference-related traits. Along the way, in-
terference was proven to be a robust phenomenon,
operating in every single sentence, even on the
morpheme level (Avner et al., 2016). Interference
can also be studied on pairs of source- and target
languages and focus, for example, on word order
(Eetemadi and Toutanova, 2014).

The powerful signal of interference is evident,
e.g., by the finding that a classifier trained to dis-
tinguish between originals and translations from
one language, exhibits lower accuracy when tested
on translations from another language, and this ac-
curacy deteriorates proportionally to the distance
between the source and target languages (Koppel
and Ordan, 2011). Consequently, it is possible
to accurately distinguish among translations from
various source languages (van Halteren, 2008).

A related task, identifying the native tongue
of English language students based only on their
writing in English, has been the subject of recent
interest (Tetreault et al., 2013). The relations be-
tween this task and identification of the source lan-
guage of translation has been emphazied, e.g., by
Tsvetkov et al. (2013). English texts produced
by native speakers of a variety of languages have
been used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, with
varying degrees of success (Nagata and Whittaker,
2013; Berzak et al., 2014). In contrast to lan-
guage learners, however, translators translate into
their mother tongue, so the texts we studied were
written by highly competent native speakers. Our
work is the first to construct phylogenetic trees
from translations.

3 Methodology

3.1 Dataset

This corpus-based study uses Europarl (Koehn,
2005), the proceedings of the European Parlia-
ment and their translations into all the official Eu-

531



ropean Union (EU) languages. Europarl is one of
the most popular parallel resources in natural lan-
guage processing, and has been used extensively
in machine translation. We use a version of Eu-
roparl spanning the years 1999 through 2011, in
which the direction of translation has been estab-
lished through a comprehensive cross-lingual val-
idation of the speakers’ original language (Rabi-
novich et al., 2015).

All parliament speeches were translated1 from
the original language into all other EU languages
(21 at the time) using English as an intermediate,
pivot language. We thus refer to translations into
English as direct, while translations into all other
languages, via English as a third language, are in-
direct. We hypothesize that indirect translation
will obscure the markers of the original language
in the final translation. Nevertheless, we expect
(weakened) fingerprints of the source language to
be identifiable in the target despite the pivot, pre-
sumably resulting in somewhat poorer phyloge-
netic trees.

We focus on 17 source languages, grouped into
3 language families: Germanic, Romance, and
Balto-Slavic.2 These include translations to En-
glish and to French from Bulgarian (BG), Czech
(CS), Danish (DA), Dutch (NL), English (EN),
French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Latvian
(LV), Lithuanian (LT), Polish (PL), Portuguese
(PT), Romanian (RO), Slovak (SK), Slovenian
(SL), Spanish (ES), and Swedish (SV). We also
included texts written originally in English and
French.

All datasets were split on sentence boundary,
cleaned (empty lines removed), tokenized, and an-
notated for part-of-speech (POS) using the Stan-
ford tools (Manning et al., 2014). In all the tree re-
construction experiments, we sampled equal-sized
chunks from each source language, using as much
data as available for all languages. This yielded
27, 000 tokens from translations to English, and
30, 000 tokens from translations into French.

1The common practice is that one translates into one’s na-
tive language; in particular, this practice is strictly imposed in
the EU parliament where a translator must have perfect profi-
ciency in the target language, meeting very high standards of
accuracy.

2We excluded source languages with insufficient amounts
of data, along with Greek, which is the only representative of
the Hellenic family.

3.2 Features

Following standard practice (Volansky et al.,
2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015), we repre-
sented both original and translated texts as fea-
ture vectors, where the choice of features de-
termines the extent to which we expect source-
language interference to be present in the transla-
tion product. Crucially, the features abstract away
from the contents of the texts and focus on their
structure, reflecting, among other things, morpho-
logical and syntactic patterns. We use the fol-
lowing feature sets: 1. The top-1,000 most fre-
quent POS trigrams, reflecting shallow syntactic
structure. 2. Function words (FW), words known
to reflect grammar of texts in numerous classifi-
cation tasks, as they include non-content words
such as articles, prepositions, etc. (Koppel and Or-
dan, 2011).3 3. Cohesive markers (Hinkel, 2001);
these words and phrases are assumed to be over-
represented in translated texts, where, for exam-
ple, an implicit contrast in the original is made ex-
plicit in the target text with words such as ‘but’ or
‘however’.4 Note that the first two feature sets are
strongly associated with interference, whereas the
third is assumed to be universal and an instance
of explicitation. We therefore expect trees based
on the first two feature sets to be much better than
those based on the third.

3.3 The Indo-European phylogenetic tree

The last few decades produced a large body of re-
search on the evolution of individual languages
and language families. While the existence of
the Indo-European (IE) family of languages is
an established fact, its history and origins are
still a matter of much controversy (Pereltsvaig
and Lewis, 2015). Furthermore, the actual sub-
groupings of languages within this family are not
clear-cut (Ringe et al., 2002). Consequently, algo-
rithms that attempt to reconstruct the IE languages
tree face a serious evaluation challenge (Ringe
et al., 2002; Rexová et al., 2003; Nakhleh et al.,
2005a).

To evaluate the quality of the reconstructed
trees, we define a metric to accurately assess their
distance from the “true” tree. The tree that we
use as ground truth (Serva and Petroni, 2008) has

3For French we used the list of FW available at https:

several advantages. First, it is similar to a well-
accepted tree (Gray and Atkinson, 2003) (which
is not insusceptible to criticism (Pereltsvaig and
Lewis, 2015)). The differences between the two
are mostly irrelevant for the group of languages
that we address in this research. Second, it is a bi-
nary tree, facilitating comparison with the trees we
produce, which are also binary branching. Third,
its branches are decorated with the approximate
year in which splitting occurred. This provides a
way to induce the distance between two languages,
modeled as lengths of paths in the tree, based on
chronological information.

We projected the gold tree (Serva and Petroni,
2008) onto the set of 17 languages we considered
in this work, preserving branch lengths. Figure 1
depicts the resulting gold-standard subtree.

Figure 1: Gold standard tree, pruned

We reconstructed phylogenetic language trees
by performing agglomerative (hierarchical) clus-
tering of feature vectors extracted separately from
English and French translations. We performed
clustering using the variance minimization algo-
rithm (Ward Jr, 1963) with Euclidean distance (the
implementation available in the Python SciPy li-
brary). All feature values were normalized to a
zero-one scale prior to clustering.

3.4 Evaluation methodology

To evaluate the quality of the trees we generate, we
compute their similarity to the gold standard via
two metrics: unweighted, assessing only structural
(topological) similarity, and weighted, estimating
similarity based on both structure and branching
length.

Several methods have been proposed for eval-
uating the quality of phylogenetic language trees
(Pompei et al., 2011; Wichmann and Grant, 2012;
Nouri and Yangarber, 2016). A popular metric is
the Robinson-Foulds (RF) methodology (Robin-
son and Foulds, 1981), which is based on the sym-
metric difference in the number of bi-partitions,
the ways in which an edge can split the leaves of a
tree into two sets. The distance between two trees
is then defined as the number of splits induced by
one of the trees, but not the other. Despite its
popularity, the RF metric has well-known short-
comings; for example, relocating a single leaf can
result in a tree maximally distant from the origi-
nal one (Böcker et al., 2013). Additional method-
ologies for evaluating phylogenetic trees include
branch score distance (Kuhner and Felsenstein,
1994), enhancing RF with branch lengths, purity
score (Heller and Ghahramani, 2005), and subtree
score (Teh et al., 2009). The latter two ignore
branch lengths and only consider structural simi-
larities for evaluation.

We opted for a simple yet powerful adaptation
of the L2-norm to leaf-pair distance, inherently
suitable for both unweighted and weighted eval-
uation. Given a tree of N leaves, li, i ∈ [1..N ],
the weighted distance between two leaves li, lj in a
tree τ , denotedDτ (li, lj), is the sum of the weights
of all edges on the shortest path between li and lj .
The unweighted distance sums up the number of
the edges in this path (i.e., all weights are equal
to 1). The distance Dist(τ, g) between a gener-
ated tree τ and the gold tree g is then calculated by
summing the square differences between all leaf-
pair distances (whether weighted or unweighted)
in the two trees:

Dist(τ, g) =
∑

i,j∈[1..N ];i 6=j
(Dτ (li, lj)−Dg(li, lj))2

4 Detection of Translations and their
Source Language

4.1 Identification of translation
We first reconfirmed that originals and translations
are easily separable, extending results of super-
vised classification of O vs. T (where O refers to
original English texts, and T to translated English)
(Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; van Halteren, 2008;
Volansky et al., 2015) to the 16 original languages
considered in this work. We also conducted sim-
ilar experiments with French originals and trans-
lations. We used 200 chunks of approximately 2K

533



tokens (respecting sentence boundaries) from both
O and T, and normalized the values of lexical fea-
tures by the number of tokens in each chunk. For
classification, we used Platt’s sequential minimal
optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001; Hall
et al., 2009) to train support vector machine clas-
sifiers with the default linear kernel. We evaluated
the results with 10-fold cross-validation.

Table 1 presents the classification accuracy of
(English and French) O vs. T using each feature
set. In line with previous works (Ilisei et al.,
2010; Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wint-
ner, 2015), the binary classification results are
highly accurate, achieving over 95% accuracy us-
ing POS-trigrams and function words for both En-
glish and French, and above 85% using cohesive
markers.

Function words 96.45 95.15
Cohesive markers 86.50 85.25

and French O vs. T

4.2 Identification of source language
Identifying the source language of translated texts
is a task in which machines clearly outperform
humans (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006). Koppel
and Ordan (2011) performed 5-way classification
of texts translated from Italian, French, Span-
ish, German, and Finnish, achieving an accuracy
of 92.7%. Furthermore, misclassified instances
were more frequently assigned to genetically re-
lated languages.

We extended this experiment to 14 languages
representing 3 language families (the number of
languages was limited by the amount of data avail-
able). We extracted 100 chunks of 1,000 tokens
each from each source language and classified the
translated English (and, separately, French) texts
into 14 classes using the best performing POS-
trigrams feature set. Cross-validation evaluation
yielded an accuracy of 75.61% on English transla-
tions (note that the baseline is 100/14 = 7.14%).

The corresponding confusion matrix, presented
in Figure 2 (left), reveals interesting phenomena:
much of the confusion resides within language
families, framed by the bold line in the figure. For
example, instances of Germanic languages are al-
most perfectly classified as Germanic, with only

a few chunks assigned to other language fami-
lies. The evident intra-family linguistic ties ex-
posed by this experiment support the intuition that
cross-linguistic transfer in translation is governed
by typological properties of the source language.
That is, translations from related sources tend to
resemble each other to a greater extent than trans-
lations from more distant languages.

This observation is further supported by the
evaluation of a three-way classification task,
where the goal is to only identify the language
family (Germanic, Romance, or Balto-Slavic): the
accuracy of this task is 90.62%. Note also that
the mis-classified instances of both Romance and
Germanic languages are nearly never attributed to
Balto-Slavic languages, since Germanic and Ro-
mance are much closer to each other than to Balto-
Slavic.

Figure 2 (right) displays a similar confusion ma-
trix, the only difference being that French trans-
lations are classified. We attribute the lower
cross-validation accuracy (48.92%, reflected also
by the lower number of correctly assigned in-
stances on the matrix diagonal, compared to En-
glish) to the intervention of the pivot language
in the translation process. Nevertheless, the con-
fusion is still mainly constrained to intra-family
boundaries.

5 Reconstruction of Phylogenetic
Language Trees

5.1 Reconstructing language typology

Inspired by the results reported in Section 4.2, we
generated phylogenetic language trees from both
English and French texts translated from the other
European languages. We hypothesized that inter-
ference from the source language was present in
the translation product to an extent that would fa-
cilitate the construction of a tree sufficiently simi-
lar to the gold IE tree (Figure 1).

The best trees, those closest to the gold stan-
dard, were generated using POS-trigrams: these
are the features that are most closely associ-
ated with source-language interference (see Sec-
tion 3.2). Figure 3 depicts the trees produced
from English and French translations using POS-
trigrams. Both trees reasonably group individual
languages into three language-family branches. In
particular, they cluster the Germanic and Romance
languages closer than the Balto-Slavic. Capturing
the more subtle intra-family ties turned out to be

more challenging, although English outperformed
its French counterpart on this task by almost per-
fectly reconstructing the Germanic sub-tree.

We repeated the clustering experiments with
various feature sets. For each feature set, we
randomly sampled equally-sized subsets of the
dataset (translated from each of the source lan-
guages), represented the data as feature vectors,
generated a tree by clustering the feature vectors,
and then computed the weighted and unweighted
distances between the generated tree and the gold
standard. We repeated this procedure 50 times for
each feature set, and then averaged the resulting
distances. We report this average and the standard
deviation.5

length) and phylograms (with branch lengths proportional to

5.2 Evaluation results

The unweighted evaluation results are listed in Ta-
ble 2. For comparison, we also present the dis-
tance obtained for a random tree, generated by
sampling a random distance matrix from the uni-
form (0, 1) distribution. The reported random tree
evaluation score is averaged over 1000 experi-
ments. Similarly, we present weighted evaluation
results in Table 3. All distances are normalized to
a zero-one scale, where the bounds – zero and one
– represent the identical and the most distant tree
w.r.t. the gold standard, respectively.

The results reveal several interesting observa-
tions. First, as expected, POS-trigrams induce

trees closest to the gold standard among distinct
feature sets. This corroborates our hypothesis that
this feature set carries over interference of the
source language to a considerable extent (see Sec-
tion 1). Furthermore, function words achieve more
moderate results, but still much better than ran-
dom. This reflects the fact that these features carry
over some grammatical constructs of the source
language into the translation product.

Finally, in all cases, the least accurate tree,
nearly random, is produced by cohesive mark-
ers; this is an evidence that this feature is source-
language agnostic and reflects the universal ef-
fect of explicitation (see Section 3.2). While co-
hesive markers are a good indicator of transla-
tions, they reflect properties that are not indica-
tive of the source language. The combination of
POS-trigrams and FW yields the best tree in three
out of four cases, implying that these feature sets
capture different, complementary aspects of the
source-language interference.

Surprisingly, reasonably good trees were also
generated from French translations; yet, these
trees are systematically worse than their English
counterparts. The original signal of the source lan-
guage is distorted twice: first via a Germanic lan-
guage (English) and then via a Romance language
(French). However, the signal is strong enough to

yield a clear phylogenetic tree of the source lan-
guages. Interference is thus revealed to be an ex-
tremely powerful force, partially resistant to inter-
mediate distortions.

6 Analysis

We demonstrated that source-language traces are
dominant in translation products to an extent that
facilitates reconstruction of the history of the
source languages. We now inspect some of these
phenomena in more detail to better understand the
prominent characteristics of interference. For each
phenomenon, we computed the frequencies of pat-
terns that reflect it in texts translated to English
from each individual language, and averaged the
measures over each language family (Germanic,
Romance, and Balto-Slavic). Figure 4 depicts the
results.

6.1 Definite articles

Languages vary greatly in their use of articles.
Like other Germanic languages, English has both
definite (‘a’ ) and indefinite (‘the’ ) articles. How-
ever, many languages only have definite articles
and some only have indefinite articles. Romance
languages, and in particular the five Romance lan-
guages of our dataset, have definite articles that
can sometimes be omitted, but not as commonly
as in English. Balto-Slavic languages typically do
not have any articles.

Mastering the use of articles in English is noto-
riously hard, leading to errors in non-native speak-
ers (Han et al., 2006). For example, native speak-
ers of Slavic languages tend to overuse definite ar-
ticles in German (Hirschmann et al., 2013). Sim-
ilarly, we expect translations from Balto-Slavic
languages to overuse ‘the’. We computed the fre-
quencies of ‘the’ in translations to English from
each of the three language families. The results
show a significant overuse of ‘the’ in translations
from Balto-Slavic languages, and some overuse in
translations from Romance languages.

6.2 Possessive constructions

Languages also vary in the way they mark posses-
sion. English marks it in three ways: with the clitic
‘’s’ (‘the guest’s room’ ), with a prepositional
phrase containing ‘of’ (‘the room of the guest’ ),
and, like in other Germanic languages, with noun
compounds (‘guest room’ ). Compounds are con-
siderably less frequent in Romance languages

(Swan and Smith, 2001); Balto-Slavic indicates
possession using case-marking. Languages also
vary with respect to whether or not possession is
head-marked. In Balto-Slavic languages, the geni-
tive case is head-marked, which reverses the order
of the two nouns with respect to the common En-
glish ‘’s’ construction. Since copying word order,
if possible across languages, is one of the major
features of interference (Eetemadi and Toutanova,
2014), we anticipated that Balto-Slavic languages
will exhibit the highest rate of noun-‘of’ -NP con-
structions. This would be followed by Romance
languages, in which this construction is highly
common, and then by Germanic languages, where
noun compounds can often be copied as such. The
results are consistent with our expectations.

6.3 Verb-particle constructions
Verb-particle constructions (e.g., ‘turn down’ )
consist of verbs that combine with a particle to cre-
ate a new meaning (Dehé et al., 2002). Such con-
structions are much more common in Germanic
languages (Iacobini and Masini, 2005), hence we
expect to encounter their equivalents in English
translations more frequently. We computed the
frequencies of these constructions in the data;
the results show a clear overuse of verb-particle
constructions in translations from Germanic, and
an underuse of such constructions in translations
from Balto-Slavic.

6.4 Tense and aspect
Tense and aspect are expressed in different ways
across languages. English, like other Germanic
languages, uses a full system of aspectual dis-
tinctions, expressed via perfect and progressive
forms (with the auxiliary verbs ‘have’ or ‘be’ ).
Balto-Slavic, in contrast, has no such system, and
the distinction is marked lexically, by having two

types of verbs. Romance languages are in be-
tween, with both lexical and grammatical distinc-
tions. We computed the frequencies of perfect
forms (defined as the auxiliary ‘have’ followed
by the past participle form), and the progressive
forms (defined as the auxiliary ‘be’ plus a present
participle form). Indeed, Germanic overuses the
perfect aspect significantly; the use of the pro-
gressive aspect also varies across language fam-
ilies, exhibiting the lowest frequency in transla-
tions from Balto-Slavic.

7 Conclusion

Translations may be considered distortions of the
original text, but this distortion is far from ran-
dom. It depicts a very clear picture, reflecting lan-
guage typology to the extent that disregarding the
sources altogether, a phylogenetic tree can be re-
constructed from a monolingual corpus consisting
of multiple translations. This holds for the prod-
uct of highly professional translators, who con-
form to a common standard, and whose products
are edited by native speakers, like themselves. It
even holds after two phases of translations. We are
presently trying to extend these results to transla-
tions in a different domain (literary texts) into a
very different language (Hebrew).

Postulated universals in linguistics (Greenberg,
1963) were confronted with much contradicting
evidence in recent years (Evans and Levinson,
2009), and the long quest for translation univer-
sals (Mauranen and Kujamäki, 2004) should now
be viewed in light of our finding: more than any-
thing else, translations are typified by interference.
This does not undermine the force of translation
universals: we demonstrated how explicitation, in
the form of cohesive markers, can help identify
translations. It may be possible to define classi-

537



fiers implementing other universal facets of trans-
lation, e.g., simplification, which will yield good
separation between O and T. However, explicita-
tion fails in the reproduction of language typology,
whereas interference-based features produce trees
of considerable quality.

Remarkably, translations to contemporary En-
glish and French capture part of the millennium-
old history of the source languages from which
the translations were made. Our trees reflect some
of the historical connections among the languages,
but of course they are related in other ways, too
(whether incidental, areal, etc.). This may explain
the case of Romanian in our reconstructed trees: it
has been isolated for many years from other Ro-
mance languages and was under heavy influence
from Balto-Slavic languages.

Very little research has been done in historical
linguistics on how translations impact the evolve-
ment of languages. The major trends relate to loan
translations (Jahr, 1999), or the impact of canoni-
cal texts, such as Luther’s translation of the Bible
to German (Russ, 1994) or the case of the King
James translation to English (Crystal, 2010). It
has been attested that for certain languages, up to
30% of published materials are mediated through
translation (Pym and Chrupała, 2005). Given the
fingerprints left on target language texts, transla-
tions very likely play a role in language change.
We leave this as a direction for future research.
