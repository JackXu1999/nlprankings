Abstract

In this paper, we present pilot work
on characterising the documentation of
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the
United States Veterans Administration
Electronic Health Record. The Veterans
Health Administration is the largest health
care system in the United States with
1,233 health care facilities nationwide,
serving 8.9 million veterans per year. We
identified a random sample of 2000 Veter-
ans Administration patients, coded as cur-
rent tobacco users, from 2008 to 2014. Us-
ing simple keyword matching techniques
combined with qualitative analysis, we
investigated the prevalence and distribu-
tion of e-cigarette terms in these clinical
notes, discovering that for current smok-
ers, 11.9% of patient records contain an e-
cigarette related term.

1 Introduction

Electronic cigarettes — e-cigarettes — were de-
veloped in China in the early 2000s and first in-
troduced to the US market in 2007. Once es-
tablished in the US, the product experienced ex-
plosive growth, with the number of e-cigarette
users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012
(Grana et al., 2014). In 2012 it was estimated that
75% of US adults had heard of e-cigarettes, and

8.1% had tried them (Zhu et al., 2013). By 2014,
the proportion of adult Americans who had tried
e-cigarettes increased to 12.6% (Schoenborn and
Gindi, 2015).

Public health practitioners, government regula-
tory authorities, professional associations, the me-
dia, as well as individual clinicians and health
workers are divided as to whether e-cigarettes rep-
resent an exciting new smoking cessation oppor-
tunity (Green et al., 2016; McNeill et al., 2015;
Caponnetto et al., 2013) or are an untested, poten-
tially dangerous technology that risks undermin-
ing recent successes in “denormalising” smoking
(Choi et al., 2012; Etter et al., 2011; Gornall, 2015;
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2016; Department of Health and Human Services,
2014).

Currently, little is known about how clinicians
“on-the-ground” advise patients who use, or are
considering using, e-cigarettes. While Winden
et al. (2015) has gone some way to describing
e-cigarette Electronic Health Record (EHR) doc-
umentation behaviour in the context of a med-
ical system in Vermont, national patterns in e-
cigarette documentation have not been explored.
In this paper, we present pilot work on charac-
terising the documentation of e-cigarettes in the
United States Veterans Administration Electronic
Health Record. The Veterans Health Administra-
tion (VA) is the largest health care system in the



United States with 1,233 health care facilities na-
tionwide, serving 8.9 million veterans per year.
VA EHR data provides the opportunity for nation-
wide population-health surveillance of e-cigarette
use.

The remainder of this document consists of five
sections. Following a discussion of related work
in Section 2, Section 3 describes both our cohort
selection procedure, and our method of identifying
e-cigarette documentation in clinical notes, while
Sections 4 and 5 present the results of out analysis,
and some discussion of those results. The final
section outlines some broad conclusions.

2 Background

The VA collects data about patient smoking his-
tory and status using several approaches at the
time of a patient encounter. Most patient clin-
ical encounters have an associated health factor
(i.e. semi-structured data that describes patient
smoking status or smoking history (Barnett et al.,
2014)). In addition, if the veteran has received
dental care, the VA dental data contains descrip-
tions of patient smoking status as a coded database
field. However, neither of these data sources can
be used to define what type of tobacco the patient
uses and more specifically, if the patient uses e-
cigarettes. This information is only found embed-
ded in clinical text.

Given the rapid rise in popularity of e-
cigarettes, and the lack of adequate public health
surveillance systems currently focussing on these
novel tobacco products, various methods and data
sources have been used to understand changes
in e-cigarette prevalence and usage patterns, in-
cluding analysing search engine queries relevant
to e-cigarettes (Ayers et al., 2011), mining so-
cial media data (Myslı́n et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2015), and — the focus of this paper — analysing
EHR data for e-cigarette related documentation
(Winden et al., 2015).

Previous work on smoking status identification
in the EHR context has focussed on structured
data (e.g. Wiley et al. (2013) used ICD-9 codes
successfully to identify current smokers in the
Vanderbilt Medical Center EHR), semi-structured
data (e.g. McGinnis et al. (2011) used VA EHR
health factors to reliably identify current smok-
ers), and unstructured data (e.g. Clark et al.
(2008); Savova et al. (2008); Da Silva et al. (2011)
applied natural language processing methods to

EHR clinical notes to identify smoking status).
EHR corpus analysis has been the focus of sev-

eral research efforts in the tobacco domain. For
example, Chen et al. (2014) investigated the docu-
mentation of general tobacco use in clinical notes
from Vermont’s Fletcher Allen Health Center, dis-
covering that free-text clinical notes are frequently
used to document amount of tobacco used, to-
bacco use frequency, and start and end dates of
tobacco use (i.e. important clinical information
that is difficult to represent with structured data).
In follow-up work focussing specifically on e-
cigarettes rather than general tobacco use, Winden
et al. (2015), again using EHR data from Fletcher
Allen Health Center, developed a sophisticated an-
notation scheme to code e-cigarette documenta-
tion, with categories including dose, device type,
frequency, and use for smoking cessation. One re-
sult of particular note garnered from this research
is the observation that less than 1% of patients had
e-cigarette mentions in their note.

In this pilot study, our aim is to complete an ini-
tial corpus analysis of VA patient record data with
the goal of quantifying the frequency with which
e-cigarette usage is documented within the VA pa-
tient record.

3 Materials and Methods

We queried the VA dental record data found in
the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to identify a
national cohort of all Veterans Affairs patients
with a coded history of current (or current and
past) smoking between the years 2008-2014. Den-
tal records were chosen as a data source as they
are believed to be the most reliable indicators of
smoking status in the VA context. From these data
we identified 87,392 unique patients (77,491 cur-
rent smokers, 9,901 current and past smokers). We
then selected a random sample of 2,000 patients
and extracted their associated clinical notes yield-
ing 154,991 clinical notes. Note types include
progress notes, consultation notes, consent docu-
ments, instructions, triage notes, history and phys-
ical notes, amongst others.

Based on an iterative process of corpus explo-
ration, along with insights gleaned from previ-
ous work on e-cigarette related natural language
processing (Myslı́n et al., 2013; Winden et al.,
2015), we identified twenty e-cigarette related
terms (listed in Table 1), and — using these terms
— performed a keyword search within the pa-



tient clinical notes. We reviewed each e-cigarette
term instance in its context to ascertain whether
the e-cigarette term instance actually referred to e-
cigarette usage.

We report the precision of each e-cigarette term
defined as the proportion of term match instances
actually referencing e-cigarette usage of all term
matches.

ranked by precision

We analysed notes from 2,000 VA patients.
From these notes, we observed 238 patients
(11.9%) with one or more e-cigarette mentions
within their notes (see Figure 1). In total, there
were 601 mentions, with 436 notes containing
more than one mention. Of these 601 mentions,
199 (33.1%) mentions described true e-cigarette
usage (Table 1) as ascertained by manual inspec-
tion. The most frequent e-cigarette term matches
included variants of the term vapor (vapor: 241,
vaporizer: 192, Vapor: 73). These terms were also
the most frequent sources of false positives (va-
por: 160, vaporizer: 156, and Vapor: 69). Thir-
teen of the twenty terms yielded precision scores
greater than 0.500. Of these high-precision terms,

the most prevalent terms included vape: 19, ecig:
14, and electronic cig: 10.

5 Discussion

We observed a variety of linguistic contexts de-
scribing e-cigarette usage. Patients report use
of e-cigarettes with other tobacco products (e.g.,
“smokes 10 tobacco cigs per day and uses vape”).
Similar to tobacco cessation, clinicians report pro-
viding encouragement and counselling for patients
to stop e-cigarette use. Patients often contem-
plate e-cigarettes as an alternative to tobacco us-
age (e.g., “thinking about switching to ecig”) or
as an approach to tobacco cessation (e.g., “uses
nicotine vaporizer and hasn’t smoked tobacco in
6 mos”). This was not a surprising finding given
that, according to the Centers for Disease Control,
“among current cigarette smokers who had tried
to quit smoking in the past year, more than one-
half had ever tried an e-cigarette and 20.3% were
current e-cigarette users” (Schoenborn and Gindi,
2015). Patients reported differing experiences of
using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, with
one patient stating directly that e-cigarettes were
an ineffective tool in his struggle to quit smoking.
Consistent with current uncertainty regarding the
safety of e-cigarettes and their utility as a smoking
cessation aid, not all clinicians support the use of
e-cigarettes as a safe alternative to tobacco usage
(e.g., “I do not recommend ecig/vapor”).

Analogous to the “packs-per-day” metric used
by clinicians to document volume of com-
bustable tobacco use, patients report their fre-
quency of e-cigarette use in volume over time
(e.g., “6mg/day”). E-cigarette usage goals are of-
ten set by both clinicians (“reducing consumption
from 9 grams to 3 with goal of quitting”) and
patients (“using e cig and cutting back by half”)
alike. One clinician reported a patient’s use of e-
cigarettes with “no side effects with current meds”
suggesting that clinicians are aware that known
side effects with medication use is a possibility.

Although most of the twenty e-cigarette terms
used in this study yielded precision scores greater
than 0.500, we also observed a substantial propor-
tion of term matches that did not indicate actual
e-cigarette usage. Many false positives occurred
due to the ambiguous nature of the word vapor-
izer and its variants. For example, the domestic
use of a vaporizer to increase room humidity, the
treatment of patients with over-the-counter sinus

relief (“Vicks vapor rub”), or the use of vaporis-
ers to ingest medical marijuana (“MJ via vapor-
izer”). These non-relevant mentions of e-cigarette
related terms are most frequently found in anaes-
thesia consent notes (n=185 mentions).

From notes containing matched e-cigarette vari-
ants, we discovered several co-occurring terms
which could improve the term’s precision, with
examples including nicotine vaporizer, vapor-
nicotine, vapor cig, vapor cigarettes, vapor pens,
vapor cigarets, methonol vapor, and vapor nico-
tine.

The pilot work described in this short paper has
several limitations. First, our list of e-cigarette
related keywords was limited to twenty. As in-
dicated above, there may well be additional high
precision e-cigarette related terms that we did not
use in this work. Second, unlike Winden et al.
(2015) we have not conducted a large scale anno-
tation effort or mapped to an annotation scheme.
Finally, while the VA is the largest integrated med-
ical system in the United States, and the only na-
tionwide system, VA patients are not necessarily
representative of the general population. It is par-
ticularly important to note that approximately 92%
of veterans are male (National Center for Veterans
Analysis and Statistics, 2013).

6 Conclusion

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that for
current smokers, e-cigarette terms are present in
11.9% (238) of VA patient records. Of this 11.9%

of patients, it is estimated that around two thirds of
e-cigarette mentions are false positives, suggest-
ing that around 4% of smokers have e-cigarette use
documented in their clinical notes.
