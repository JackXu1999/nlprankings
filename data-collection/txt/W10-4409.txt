Abstract

This paper provides an account for inverse
scope restrictions with nominal quantifiers
using synchronous tree adjoining grammar.
It aims to provide an alternative account to
Beghelli & Stowell’s (1997) work on similar
data.

1 Introduction

Recent work in the study of the syntax-semantics in-
terface [Nesson and Shieber, 2006, 2007, 2008] us-
ing synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (STAGs)
has attempted to cover a broad range of empirical
issues with respect to scopal interactions (control
verbs, relative clauses, inverse linking). The major-
ity of this work has attempted to relax the locality
restrictions enough to be able to derive possible in-
terpretations while remaining as restricted as possi-
ble.

These analyses however are unable to account
for asymmetries in the scopal interaction of nomi-
nal quantifiers (see §2). This paper aims to explain
these asymmetries through two novel mechanisms:
(1) Operations on an elementary tree must proceed
in the opposite order of the prominence ordering of
the nodes on the tree (to be explained in §3). (2)
Different classes of quantifiers, represented as multi-
component sets, differ in their derivation procedure,
where some classes must combine simultaneously in
an elementary tree while other classes’ scopal tree is
able to adjoin later in the derivation.

This paper gives an alternative analysis to
Beghelli and Stowell’s (henceforth B&S) (1997)

analysis of quantifier scope in English. In partic-
ular this paper examines the restriction on inverse
scope readings in English when the object quantifier
is a count quantifier as compared to the the ability
to have inverse scope readings when the quantifier is
a universal quantifier. Additionally, these same re-
strictions will be shown to hold in the double object
constructions in English.

This paper will then extend this analysis to quanti-
fier scope puzzles in Mandarin Chinese and Hungar-
ian. Quantifier scope in both Mandarin and Hungar-
ian is said to correspond to the hierarchical positions
of the nominal quantifiers, allowing no scopal ambi-
guities. Yet it has been observed that there are cer-
tain constructions in both languages where there are
scopal ambiguities. Mandarin “passive” sentences
and Hungarian sentences where both quantifiers fol-
low the verb are known to allow inverse scope read-
ings as well as surface scope readings. Previous
analyses of these phenomena in conjunction with the
constraints proposed in this paper derive the ambi-
guity in these constructions while keeping the other
constructions unambiguous in their scope readings.

The organization of the paper will be as fol-
lows: §2 will describe the restrictions on inverse
scope reading in English sentences with two nom-
inal quantifiers. §3 will explain the derivational con-
straints utilized for the English analysis. §4 will
show how these constraints derive the right scope
readings in the examples described in §2. §5 will
describe and analyze the Mandarin and Hungarian
extensions to the analysis. §6 will conclude the pa-
per, offering some further areas for exploration.

2 Data

2.1 English Nominal Quantifiers

As discussed in Beghelli and Stowell [1997], cer-
tain classes of nominal quantifiers are able to scope
over quantificational subjects when in object posi-
tion, while other classes may not. This is exempli-
fied in (1) and (2).

(1) Every student read 2 papers. (∀ > 2, 2 > ∀)

(2) Every student read more than 2 papers.
(∀ > 2+, 2+ ≯ ∀)

The examples in (1) and (2) show that quanti-
fiers like 2 (called group-denoting quantifier phrases
(GQPs) by B&S) can take wide scope while in
object position while quantifiers like more than 2
(called count quantifier phrases (CQPs) by B&S)
cannot. Universal quantifiers (DQPs) also pattern
with GQPs by being able to scope over the deno-
tation of the subject NP, as shown in (3).

(3) 2 students read every book. (∀ > 2, 2 > ∀)

2.2 English Double Object Construction

Double object constructions in English also seem to
follow the same pattern where DQPs seem to be able
to take scope over other quantifiers when in a hi-
erarchically lower position, while CQPs are unable
to (as in (4)1. The pattern of scope rigidity versus
scope ambiguity is exhibited in both double object
and prepositional dative constructions in (4) and (5).

(4) a. John assigned more than 2 students every
paper on the syllabus. (∀ > 2+, 2+ > ∀)

b. John assigned every student more than 2 pa-
pers on the syllabus. (∀ > 2+)

(5) a. John assigned more than 2 papers on the
syllabus to every student. (∀ > 2+, 2+ > ∀)

b. John assigned every paper on the syllabus to
more than 2 students. (∀ > 2+)

1Some speakers consider this construction to be unambigu-
ous. An analysis of this dialectal difference is outside the scope
of this paper and awaits future work.

3 Restricting Inverse Scope

3.1 Inverse Scope in STAG

Common to many STAG analyses is the use of
multiple adjunction [Schabes and Shieber, 1994] to
get inverse scope. With multiple adjunction, the sco-
pal part of all QPs are able to adjoin at the same node
in the course of the derivation. A further convention
states that the later combined tree adjoins above the
earlier combined tree. Inverse scope is derived be-
cause either quantifier is able to adjoin first. This
type of analysis runs into problems accounting for
the data in §2 because the only restriction on scopal
parts of two clausemate quantifiers is that they both
appear within the semantic tree associated with the
verb of which they are both arguments. As a result, it
fails to distinguish among different classes of quan-
tifiers and also between the scopal possibilities when
the quantifiers are in subject and object position.

3.2 Beghelli & Stowell

B&S obtain the differences in scope possibilities
(developed within the minimalist framework) by
positing a series of functional projections above VP.
They argue that different sets of quantifiers have dif-
ferent features that need to be checked and this leads
to movement at LF where the QPs move to a func-
tional projection that satisfies some feature. They
categorize quantifier phrases into five groups: Inter-
rogative QPs, Negative QPs, Group-denoting QPs,
Distributive QPs, and Count QPs. Each group is de-
noted by a shared semantic feature: WhQPs intro-
duce questions, NQPs negate, GQPs denote groups
(and plural individuals), DQPs distribute over sets
and are universally quantified, and CQPs count indi-
viduals with a certain property. The different scope
possibilities are constrained by the positions each
class of quantifier can move to. The different func-
tional projects (hierarchically ordered) with the as-
sociated QP class that moves to the specifier position
of the functional projection are in (6).

(6) RefP(GQP) > CP(WhQP) > AgrSP(CQP) >
DistP(DQP) > ShareP(GQP) > NegP(NQP) >
AgrOP(CQP)

B&S’s solution to why CQPs can’t scope over the
subject quantifier while in object position is that a
CQP in object position is only able to move to the

specifier of AgrOP while GQPs and DQPs move to
a position higher in the structure. The c-command
relationship then determines the scope relation.

Although this style of analysis may be available
in a STAG, this paper aims to provide an alterna-
tive account. An alternative account is preferable
because (a) this type of analysis seems to go against
the spirit of STAG where syntactic and semantic el-
ements combine synchronously; and (b) it is worth
while to see if this approach can be simplified within
STAG. Complexities that arise in the B&S analysis
include the notion that quantifiers must be ambigu-
ous as to their feature specifications, and that a large
number of functional projections are necessary for
any verbal tree. For instance they analyze ‘every’
as a DQP or a GQP, this would entail three differ-
ent possible landing spots for ‘every’ and thus three
different lexical items.

3.3 Current Proposal

Our proposed analysis assumes a synchronous
derivation [Shieber and Schabes, 1990], multi-
component trees (MCTAG) [Joshi, 1987], and mul-
tiple adjunction. Also following the literature on
multiple adjunction, I will assume that the tree that
is adjoined later in the derivation scopes over the
previously adjoined structure [Schabes and Shieber,
1994].

The analysis aims to capture the intuition that the
derivation of the sentence reflects the sentence struc-
ture and that a different structure stems at least par-
tially from a different derivation. For the present
data this assumes that there is a structural differ-
ence between the two different scope readings. In
the present analysis this will manifest itself in the
semantic trees.

3.4 Hierarchy in Derivation Order

Traditionally, TAGs do not specify the order of
derivation among the substitution and adjoining op-
erations that target a given elementary tree. One way
in which to limit the inverse scope possibilities is to
restrict the ordering of such operations in the fol-
lowing fashion: The order of operations on an ele-
mentary tree must proceed in the opposite order of
the asymmetrical c-command (ACC) and irreflexive
dominance (DOM) ordering of the nodes of the tree.
More formally we define a relation PROM in (7) and

then impose the following restriction in (8).

(7) PROMdef = {(x,y)|(x,y) ∈ DOMirr ∪ ACC}

(8) PROMINENCE RESTRICTION ON DERIVA-
TION (PROD)
If node a in syntactic tree T is targeted (by sub-
stitution or adjoining) prior to node b in T, then
(a,b) must not be in PROM

This constraint ensures that a hierarchically lower
node is targeted before a higher one. The dominance
relation applies in sentences like (9) where the ad-
verb that adjoins to S scopes over the adverb that
scope over VP.

(9) a. Intentionally, John knocked twice.

b. Twice, John knocked intentionally

The c-command relation applies in the cases of nom-
inal quantifiers discussed in §2. Since the subject
of a transitive sentence c-commands its object, the
object quantifier must combine into the elementary
tree first in the derivation. Since the combination of
the syntactic and semantic trees is synchronous, this
restriction does not allow scope ambiguity in these
cases.

3.5 Relaxing Derivation Order

Different applications of MCTAG have assumed that
the properties of all instances of multicomponent ad-
joining in a grammar behave in a uniform fashion,
whether restricted to being tree-local, set-local, or
non-local. In particular MCTAG [Joshi, 1987] as-
sumes that all members of a tree set combine with
a target tree simultaneously and VTAG [Rambow,
1994, Nesson and Shieber, 2008] assumes that that
there is no simultaneity constraint on members of a
tree set. I propose instead that a tree set can specify
derivational restrictions on its use during a deriva-
tion. In particular, I will consider two possibilities
for a given set, which interact with my proposal con-
cerning derivational order:

1. Simultaneous combination (SC): the integra-
tion of the trees within a tree-set must take a
single point in a derivation.

71



2. Delayed combination (DC): the integration of
the trees within a tree-set may take place at dif-
ferent points during the derivation.

Only the variable-trees must be derived follow-
ing the hierarchical order (as in vector-TAG [Ram-
bow, 1994, Nesson and Shieber, 2008]). I argue
that the different classes of quantifiers differ along
the SC/DC dimension. Specifically, the tree-set of
CQPs is SC, while the other QP classes are DC. For
present purposes, it will suffice for me to assume
that all quantifier trees are constrained to adjoin in
a tree-local fashion. Note that non-local derivation
in combination with SC will be equivalent to non-
local MC-TAG and is NP-hard to parse[Rambow
and Satta, 1992, Champollion, 2007].2

3.6 English Nominal Quantifiers

With these preliminaries in place, we can now turn
to the analysis of the scopal asymmetries in (1) and
(2). Since the object QP in (1) is DC, two possible
derivations are available (using the trees in Figure
1). In the first of these, the object quantifier 2 pa-
pers is combined first, following the PROMINENCE
RESTRICTION ON DERIVATION order. On the se-
mantic side, this means that the variable tree must
be substituted into the read tree. At this point, the
scopal component is also free to adjoin to the t* root
of the read tree. If it does this, the subsequent in-
tegration of the subject quantifier every student will
result in the scope of the universal being outside of
the numeral (as in figure 1). In the other derivation,
the DC property of the universal quantifier tree is ex-
ploited. The scope portion of the numeral quantifier
is not adjoined immediately. Instead, the derivation
proceeds through the integration of the subject quan-
tifier, including its scope, and then the scope of the
object quantifier is finally adjoined. This yields wide
scope for the object quantifier (as in figure 1).

For example (2), in which the object quantifier, in
virtue of being a CQP, is SC, only the first of these
derivations is possible: the scope of more than 2
books must adjoin to t* at the point that the variable
is substituted, resulting in obligatory narrow scope
for the object quantifier.

Note that when CQPs are in subject position, they
nonetheless show scope ambiguity with respect to

object quantifiers, as in (10).

(10) More than 2 students read every book.
(2+ > ∀)

This possibility is predicted by the current analy-
sis: the flexibility of the object quantifier to adjoin
at t* either before or after the subject quantifier will
permit the generation of either scope, even in the
face of a SC requirement on the subject quantifier.

The double object construction described in §2
also can be explained using the c-command con-
straint and delayed combination. Adopting the Lar-
sonion VP-shell analysis [Larson, 1988] as in fig-
ure 2, the node that is targeted by the goal object
c-commands the node that is targeted by the theme
object. Theme object quantifiers that have the DC
property are able to take scope over the theme ob-
ject quantifier, while ones that have the SC property
are unable to. The prepositional dative case works
analogously, where only when the lower goal object
has the DC property does inverse scope take place.

4 Extending the Analysis

The behavior of nominal quantifiers in various other
languages differs from the English case described
above. Both Mandarin and Hungarian are purported
to have their scope ordering match surface structure
very closely. “Active” Mandarin sentences and Hun-
garian sentences where both quantifiers are in the
pre-verbal field only have surface scope readings.
This corresponds with all the quantifiers in both lan-
guages having the SC feature. Yet there are con-
structions in both languages where scope ambiguity
does arise. This section aims to show how the con-
straints in this analysis are able to account for the
varying scopal behavior in these languages without
DC.

4.1 Data

4.1.1 Mandarin Chinese Passives

Aoun and Li [1993] observes that there is a dis-
tinction in the scope possibilities between (11) and
(12). In (11), the subject QP must scope over the
object QP. This contrasts with the sentence in (12)
where the inverse scope reading is possible. Tradi-
tionally (11) has been categorized as an active sen-
tence and (12) as the passive with BEI being alter-

4.1.2 Hungarian Scope

In Hungarian, transitive sentences with two quan-
tifiers can be in a number of different word orders.
When both quantifiers precede the verb the scope or-
dering is strict and no inverse scope reading is possi-
ble, as in (13). When both quantifiers are unstressed
and follow the verb inverse scope readings are pos-
sible, as in (14).

4.2 Extending the Analysis

The syntactic trees chosen for the Mandarin and
Hungarian data in figures 3 and 4 are chosen based
on previous analyses of this data. Aoun and Li
[1993] argue that the trace allows either scope read-
ing because each quantifier c-commands the other.
Kiss [2002] argues that the structure of Hungarian
has a hierarchical preverbal field and a flat structure
in the VP field. Ambiguous scope is available when
the quantifiers are in the VP field because neither c-
commands the other, yet while they are above VP

there is surface scope because one quantifier will
c-command the other. Both of these analyses base
their analysis off of the idea that c-command rela-
tions derive scope relations [May, 1977].

These cases force us to complicate the analysis
given in §3. In both the Hungarian and Mandarin
cases quantifiers are represented by MC-sets. As
such, there are cases where a MC-set both com-
mands and is c-commanded by some other tree (set).
The current definition of PROM when utilized by
PROD leads to paradox as two different nodes can-
not be be targeted until the other one has been tar-
geted. The definition of PROM needs to be refined
by accounting for this configuration. To do this a
new relation PROM’ will be defined in (7).

(15) PROM’def = {(x,y)|(x,y) ∈ PROM, no z such
that (1) (y,z) ∈ PROM, (x,z) is targeted by a
MC-set or (2) (z,x) ∈ PROM, (z,y) is targeted
by a MC-set.}

The definition of PROM’ eliminates from PROM
pairs (a,b),(b,c) where a and b are targeted by differ-
ent MC-sets (a,c) and (b); and (a,b) and (b,c) are in
PROM. In these cases there is no possible ordering
between the two sets based on their hierarchical po-
sition. PROM’ then replaces PROM in the PROD.

The Mandarin data falls out from this revised
PROD. First, the restriction against inverse scope
in the “active” sentences can be explained if Man-
darin quantifiers all obey simultaneous combination.
The interaction of the quantifiers in the syntactic tree
explains the scope ambiguity in the “passive” sen-
tences. The higher surface quantifier is analyzed as
a multi-component set. The lexical tree substitutes
into the higher DP and the trace tree substitutes into
the lower DP. In transformational terms the trace-
tree occupies the base position and the lexical tree
occupies the surface (moved-to) position. Between
these two positions is the other quantifier. It is repre-
sented by a singleton tree set. The asymmetrical c-
command relations between the three nodes that the
quantifiers occupy are the following: The lexical-
tree of the higher quantifier c-commands the lower
quantifier and the lower quantifier c-commands the
trace-tree. Since both quantifiers c-command each
other they are not in PROM’ and there is no restric-
tion in their derivation because neither derivation or-
der violates the PRoD. This allows either quantifier

to take wide scope during the derivation of the se-
mantic tree. This produces the scope ambiguity, and
does so without delayed combination. Thus, both
the strict scope behaviour and ambiguous scope be-
haviour can be derived.

The Hungarian data also can be derived given the
revised PROD. The ambiguous scope cases are de-
rived because the nodes the quantifiers substitute
into are not in a PROM relation with respect to one
another. Thus either DP is able to combine first and
on the semantic side either scopal tree is able to then
adjoin first. The unambiguous case is derived be-
cause the highest DP node is in a PROM’ relation
with a DP under VP. Thus the tree-set that targets
the DP under FP2 must combine first with the ele-
mentary tree. On the semantics side the scopal tree
must attach before the scopal tree for the other quan-
tifier. This produces the surface scope reading only.

5 Conclusions and Further Ideas

5.1 Summary

This paper has explored one method of restricting
scope relations in S-TAG. The two mechanisms dis-
cussed in the paper have been shown to predict the
correct scope possibilities in English sentences with
subject and object quantifiers (and object quantifiers
in the double object construction), in Mandarin Chi-
nese “active” and “passive” constructions, and the
different Hungarian configurations. The former uti-
lized both the PROM constraint on derivation and
delayed combination while the latter two utilized
only a revised PROM constraint.

5.2 Further Work

Further work on this topic involves a more indepth
look at the scopal possibilities in the English, Man-
darin, and Hungarian. Notably a comparison to
Szabolcsi [1997] for Hungarian would be advanta-
geous. Further work on this analysis involves see-
ing how the constraints proposed in this paper in-
teract with other scopal elements. For instance how
does this paper’s analysis affect the scopal possibil-
ities between negative markers, questions, or inten-
tional operators, and nominal quantifiers. Phenom-
ena from other languages should also be explored: It
might prove interesting to see what languages utilize
DC and which don’t and whether DC varies cross-

linguistically in what lexical items possess it. Evi-
dence for this type of analysis may be borne out of
a coherent typology. Another avenue of exploration
would be to seek out an alternative to the PROM’
relation that is less complex and independently mo-
tivated.
