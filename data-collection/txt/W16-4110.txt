Abstract

In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of statistically predictive syntactic features of
complexity and the treatment of these features by humans when simplifying texts. To that end,
we have used a list of the most five statistically predictive features obtained automatically and
the Corpus of Basque Simplified Texts (CBST) to analyse how the syntactic phenomena in these
features have been manually simplified. Our aim is to go beyond the descriptions of operations
found in the corpus and relate the multidisciplinary findings to understand text complexity from
different points of view. We also present some issues that can be important when analysing
linguistic complexity.

1 Introduction and Related Work

Linguistic complexity has gained a lot of attention in the last years from different points of view. In
Natural Language Processing (NLP), for example, there are two main research lines that deal with text
complexity: readability assessment (RA) and automatic text simplification (ATS). RA seeks to analyse
the complexity of the texts to classify them according to a level by means of analysis of linguistic features
and machine learning techniques (DuBay, 2004; Benjamin, 2012; Zamanian and Heydari, 2012). On the
other hand, ATS deals with the complexity of the texts in order to give a more accessible and simple
equivalent version by reducing its lexical and syntactic complexity (Shardlow, 2014; Siddharthan, 2014).
In the last years, parallel corpora of original and simplified texts have also been created in order to study
the phenomena considered as complex and the changes performed when simplifying (Caseli et al., 2009;
Bott and Saggion, 2014; Brunato et al., 2015).

In Basque, linguistic complexity has been studied from both neurolinguistic and computational points
of view. From a neurolinguistic point of view, the internal word ordering (Laka and Erdozia, 2010), the
relative clauses (Carreiras et al., 2010), and the effect of phrasal length on sentence word order (Ros et
al., 2015) have been analysed. From the computational point of view, text complexity has been studied
for readability assessment (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2014) or automatic text simplification (Aranzabe et al.,
2012).

In this paper, from the computational point of view, we want to see if the syntactic features that are sta-
tistically predictive of readability have been considered by humans when simplifying texts and how they
have been treated. To that end, we analyse the phenomena involved in the most five predictive syntactic
features (the ratios of conditional, concessive, purpose, temporal and relative clauses) in the Corpus of
Basque Simplified Texts (CBST) (Gonzalez-Dios, 2016) in the two simplification approaches contained
(structural and intuitive). This way, we want to make a linguistic analysis of the simplified texts beyond
the description of the corpus and relate them to computational and neurolinguistic studies when possible.
So, we want to start understanding the grounds of linguistic complexity from a multidisciplinary point
of view.

This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the resources and the methodology we
have followed in this analysis and in Section 3 we show the treatment of the of the phenomena in the

corpus CBST. In Section 4 we show how the phenomena have been simplified and in Section 5 we expose
some issues that are necessary to keep on with the analysis of text complexity. Finally, we conclude and
outline the future work in Section 6.

2 Resources and Experimental Set Up

To analyse wheater the syntactic phenomena considered in the statistically predictive features have been
treated by humans, we have used two resources: a list of predictive features and a corpus of simplified
texts. To get the list of predictive features, we have based on the experiments carried out to assess the
readability of Basque texts (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2014). In these experiments, in addition to create a
model to classify texts as simple or complex, a list with most predictive features or linguistic ratios was
created using the data mining software Weka (Hall et al., 2009) and the rankers Chi Square Ranker and
InfoGain Ranker. The features in the list are classified according to their linguistic type: global, lexical,
morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic and pragmatic.

To train the readability assessment model and get the list of predictive features, two corpora of sci-
entific popularisation domain were used: 1) the Elhuyar (T-comp) corpus, which contains 200 texts for
adults which, was considered as a complex corpus and 2) the Zernola (T-simp) corpus, containing 200
texts for children, was considered as simple. These corpora were analysed with the framework for the
automatic analysis of Basque (Aduriz and Dı́az de Ilarraza, 2003), the sentence and clause boundary
detector (Aranzabe et al., 2013) and the apposition detector (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2013).

The second resource is the Corpus of Basque Simplified Texts (CBST) (Gonzalez-Dios, 2016). This
corpus compiles 227 original sentences1 of the Elhuyar (T-comp) corpus that have been simplified by
two language experts following the structural and intuitive approaches. The structural approach was
performed by a court translator that followed easy-to-read guidelines inspired by Mitkov and Štajner
(2014) such as use simple and short sentences with only a finite verb in each, use high frequency words,
use always the same word to refer to same concept, keep logical and chronological ordering, recover
elided arguments and verbs, and resolve anaphora. She was also given a set of operations performed
in a previous phase of the corpus that included operations such as substitute synonyms, split clauses or
reorder clauses. The intuitive approach was performed by a teacher following her experience on teaching
Basque as foreign language and her intuition. In both approaches the target audience was open.

So, to see how the phenomena contained in the most predictive syntactic features have been treated in
the CBST corpus, we have followed this methodology:

1. We have extracted the syntactic features from the list of predictive features and their significance
according to the two rankers (Table 1).

Ratio Chi square InfoGain
Conditional clauses / clauses 249.9054 0.7057
Concessive clauses / clauses 189.0847 0.5338

Purpose clauses / clauses 148.062 0.3808

Modal clauses / clauses 60.4716 0.1657

Completive clauses / clauses 54.202 0.1632

Table 1: Most predictive syntactic features.

2. We have extracted automatically the clauses related to the five most predictive features (conditional
clauses, concessive clauses, purpose clauses, temporal clauses and relative clauses, henceforth target
clauses) from the CBST corpus.

1In total, there are 785 sentences and 13 303 words.

3. Following the annotation of the corpus, we have performed the analysis of the target clauses by
tagging manually if they have been treated or not (binary classification) and how they have been
simplified. In the case of the relative clauses, we have added complementary information: we have
annotated if the elided element is the object or subject to be able to compare if the treatment of
clauses suits to the findings by Carreiras et al. (2010).

The results of the treatment are shown in Section 3

3 Treatment of the Predictive Syntactic Features in the CBST

In the CBST there are 114 clauses (89 sentences) that contain the target clauses. In Table 2 we show the
percentages of the target clauses that have been treated in both simplification approaches. In parentheses
we show the raw numbers.

Clause type Quantity Structural approach Intuitive approach
Conditional clauses 17 82.35 (14) 35.29 (6)
Concessive clauses 5 100.00 (5) 80.00 (4)

Purpose clauses 22 22.73 (5) 22.73 (5)
Temporal clauses 17 52.94 (9) 58.82 (10)
Relative clauses 53 79.25 (42) 52.83 (28)

Total 114 85.50 (75) 71.82 (63)

Table 2: Percentages of simplified clauses in both structural and intuitive approaches.

Looking at the results of the conditional clauses, we see that there is a big difference depending on the
approach. While in the structural approach 82.35 % has been simplified, 35.29 % has been treated in the
intuitive. The percentages of both approaches are closer in the case of the temporal clauses (structural:
52.94 %; intuitive: 58.82 %), but they also differ in the relative clauses (structural: 79.25 %; intuitive:
52.83 %). The treatment of the purpose clauses has been slight in both approaches, and we do not
have enough data for the analysis of the concessive clauses. According to the simplification approach in
general, we see that there have been more simplified target clauses in the structural approach (85.50 %)
than in the intuitive (71.82 %).

In Section 4 we present how these target sentences have been manually simplified.

4 Simplification of the Target Clauses the CBST

As we also want to know how the simplification is carried out in the target clauses, we analyse the
macro-operations that have been performed. Eight macro-operations2 are defined in the annotation
scheme of the CBST: delete, merge, split, transformation, insert, reordering, no operation and other.
The most found macro-operations in the target clauses are split and transformations. In the split oper-
ations sentences are divided, and in the transformation operations different changes are performed in
words, phrases or clauses. Transformations can be lexical, morphological, syntactic, discursive, correc-
tions and reformulations. The detailed description of each macro-operation and the operations involved
is found in Gonzalez-Dios (2016).

In the following subsections, we present the results according to the macro-operations mainly per-
formed. These macro-operations are split, transformation, split and transformation together in the same
clause and only others (delete, insert or reordering). We illustrate the results with examples of original
and simplified versions in both approaches.

4.1 Conditional Clauses
In the conditional clauses (Table 3), the most applied macro-operation has been the transformation in
both approaches. The syntactic transformations that have been applied are a) the change of the syntac-
tic connective, b) transforming a clause into a phrase, c) transforming a subordinate clause into a main

clause or d) changing the finite verb with a non finite. There have also been morphological transforma-
tions like changing the verb mood from potential or conditional to present or past indicative and lexical
transformations.

Intuitive 6 0.00 (0) 66.67 (4) 33.33 (2) 0.00 (0)

Table 3: Macro-operations performed in conditional clauses.

In Table 4 we show two examples of conditional clauses. In the first sentence, a split, an insert
and a change in the verb mood and tense (from hypothetic to present potential) have been performed
in the structural approach while in the intuitive approach only the change in the verb mood and tense
(form hypothetic to past indicative) has been carried out. In the second sentence, no operation has
been performed in the structural approach but the syntactic connective has been changed (conditional to
causal). There has been a reordering too.

4.2 Purpose Clauses

In the purpose clauses (Table 5) the reordering (exactly, the operation named change of the order of
clauses) has also been used in the intuitive approach. The transformations that have been applied in both
approaches are a) the conversion of subordinate clauses into main or coordinate clauses at syntactic level,
b) lexical transformations and c) reformulations.

In Table 6 we show the simplified versions of two purpose clauses. In the first clause, a split has been
performed in the structural approach while no operation was performed in the intuitive (not treated).
The second clause was not treated in the structural approach while the ordering of clauses was altered
(reordering) in the intuitive.

4.3 Temporal Clauses

In the temporal clauses (Table 7), the transformation has also been the most used macro-operation. The
syntactic transformations that have been carried out are similar to those found in the conditional sen-
tences: a) the change of the syntactic connective, b) transforming a clause into a phrase, c) transforming
a subordinate clause into a main clause or d) changing the finite verb with a non finite). There have also
been morphological transformations (e.g. change the persons of the verb) and reformulations.

Table 7: Macro-operations performed in temporal clauses.

In Table 8 we show an example of a temporal clause which has undergone a split and a reordering of
phrases and clauses in both approaches. As we see, although the operations performed are the same, the
output text is different.

Table 8: Example of simplifications of temporal clauses.

4.4 Relative Clauses

In the relative clauses (Table 9), although the transformation has been the most used macro-operation,
the split has also been important above all in the structural approach. The transformations that have been
carried out are, as in the conditional and temporal clauses, a) the change of of the syntactic connective, b)

93



transforming a clause into a phrase, c) transforming a subordinate clause into a main clause or d) chang-
ing the finite verb with a non finite. There have also been lexical transformations and reformulations.
The other macro-operations involved are the insertion of non required phrases, the reordering of phrases
and clauses and the deletion of the phrases.

In the sentence of Table 10 the same transformation has been performed in both approaches: the finite
verb “eusten dien” (that keeps them) has transformed into the non-finite verb “eusteko” (to keep).

Table 10: Example of simplifications of relative clauses.

As relative clauses have also been studied from a neurolinguistic point of view by Carreiras et al.
(2010), now we compare our findings. They claim that Basque subject relative clauses are harder to
process than object relative clauses. So, we want to see if the relative clauses where the subject has been
elided have been mainly treated in both approaches. These results are shown in Table 11.

Approach Subject relative clause Object relative clause
Structural 80.95 (34/42) 81.82 (9/11)
Intuitive 69.04 (29/42) 9.09 (1/11)

Table 11: Simplification of subject and object relative clauses.

In the case of the structural approach, more than 80 % of the subject and object relative clauses have
been simplified. In the intuitive approach, on the other hand, almost 70 % of the subject clauses relative
clauses have been simplified while the object relative clauses have hardly been. So, we see that in the
case of the intuitive approach the results are consequent to the findings by Carreiras et al. (2010). In the
structural approach, however, we think that the guidelines have influenced these results.

5 Discussion

While carrying out these experiments and performing the data analysis, we have found some issues we
want to point out. The aim of this analysis is to guide a future study and make a reflection of the data
and resources.

The first main issue is the data scarcity problem since in some cases e.g. the concessive clauses we
were not able to analyse the results. However, we think that it is important to perform preliminary studies
that can raise other questions while bigger corpora are created or compiled.

After having detected contradictory results when comparing the treatment by human editors to the
statistically predictive features, we decided to carry out a deeper analysis of other phenomena that are
found in the sentences of our target clauses. In this analysis, we want to see e.g. if in the sentences
containing purpose clauses there are other phenomena that have been simplified. For example, in Table
12, we present a sentence containing a purpose clause where the relative clause also found has been
reformulated.

recall that the raw numbers are shown in parentheses.

Table 13: Applied operations in the sentences containing the target clauses.

The combination of the simplification carried out in other phenomena is not, however, homogeneous
in all the cases. It is noticeable in the case of purpose clauses, but it is not so noticeable in the rest. To
study how different phenomena may affect each other will be our next step. In fact, as we have 114 target
clauses in 89 sentences, we find that in 28.09 % of the sentences there is more than one target clause. So,
we think that other phenomena in the sentences can be important. To enlarge this analysis, based on our
manual analysis, we consider that in the future we should also take into account other parameters such as
the length of the target clause or its subordination depth to get to know why a clause has been simplified
and not the other.

Another interesting issue is the comparison of approaches, as we have seen that depending on the
approach the results vary a lot. The guidelines and the target audience human editors had in mind has
influenced their simplification decisions. This has been seen in the case of conditional and relative
clauses where the results differ the most. We think that the guideline ’use simple and short sentences
with only a finite verb in each’3 has been important when performing the simplification in the structural
approach and according to the intuition this guideline may not be needed. Moreover, in the case of the
relative clauses we have seen that it can be sufficient to treat only subject relative clauses as performed
in the intuitive approach and also corroborated by the neurolinguistic studies. The ideal situation will
be to based on the neurolinguistic works to write simplification guidelines and that is why we think that
multidisciplinary work should be encouraged.

As conclusion of the operations performed, we want to point out that both splitting and syntactic
transformations such as a) changing the syntactic connective, b) transforming a clause into a phrase, c)
transforming a subordinate clause into a main clause or d) changing the finite verb with a non finite seem
to be important operations together with e) lexical operations and f) reformulations. These operations
should be taken into account in the Basque ATS system although some of them are not feasible or require

a deeper analysis.
We have also seen in Table 8 that the mere description of the operations is not enough to capture all

the changes performed in the sentences. This should lead to a re-thinking of the annotation scheme or
annotation methodology.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have presented the treatment that the phenomena in the statistical predictive syntactic
features have undergone in the CBST corpus with the aim of contrasting machine and human perspec-
tives. We have seen that in the structural approach there is a tendency to treat these phenomena, while the
data in the intuitive approach is more diverse. In the case of relative clauses, we have related our findings
to a neurolinguistic study and we have seen that the results of the intuitive approach agree. Looking at the
simplifications macro-operations, we have corroborated the importance of the split and transformation
operations in both approaches.

In the future, we would like to carry out an analysis the combination of the phenomena at sentence
level to see how they may affect each other and to broaden this study when the CBST corpus be enlarged.
In fact, data scarcity has been a problem to draw conclusions about the results, but we want to open a way
to analyse the corpora based on different approaches. We also plan to reanalyse and compare our results
as new neurolinguistic study are carried out and published, since we consider that multidisciplinary
approaches can be helpful to get to understand linguistic complexity.
