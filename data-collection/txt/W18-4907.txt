Abstract 

This paper presents the results of two experiments carried out within the framework of compu-

tational construction grammar. Starting from the constructionist point of view that there are just 

constructions in language, including lexical ones, we tested the validity of a clustering algorithm 

that was primarily designed for MWE extraction, the cpr-score (Colson, 2017), on Chinese word 

segmentation. Our results indicate a striking recall rate of 75 percent without any special adap-

tation to Chinese or to the lexicon, which confirms that there is some similarity between extract-

ing MWEs and CWS. Our second experiment also suggests that the same methodology might 

be used for extracting more schematic or abstract constructions, thereby providing evidence for 

the statistical foundation of construction grammar.  

 

1 Introduction 

In many respects, constructionist approaches have led to a new paradigm in the description of language 

structure. Building on Langacker’s cognitive grammar (Langacker, 2008), the different versions of con-

struction grammar (CxG) converge on the notion of constructions, defined as Saussurean signs, i.e. 

“conventional, learned form-function pairings at varying levels of complexity and abstraction” (Gold-

berg, 2013: 17). A construction may be a word in the traditional sense (e.g. book), a bound morpheme 

(pre-, -ing), an idiom (spill the beans, take the rough with the smooth), a partially filled idiom (take X 

into account), but also an abstract construction such as the ditransitive construction or the passive. As 

the famous quotation goes (Goldberg, 2006: 18), “It’s constructions all the way down”, i.e. language 

structure is made of nothing else than constructions, at various degrees of abstraction and schematicity. 

Schematic slots are the positions in the constructions allowing for several choices (e.g. X in take X into 

account), whereas specific (or substantive) slots are fixed (e.g. into and account in the same construc-

tion). 

The continuum between lexicon and syntax plays a key role in CxG: there is no strict borderline 

between grammar on the one hand and the lexicon on the other, and this cline has been called the con-

structicon (Fillmore, 1988; Goldberg, 2003). Thus, the constructicon includes all types of constructions, 

be they of a more syntactic, morphological, phonological, phraseological, pragmatic or lexical nature. 

As a general theory of language, CxG has far-reaching consequences for corpus and computational 

linguistics. In particular, it sheds a new light on multiword expressions (MWEs), in the general sense of 

all word combinations displaying lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncra-

sies. Indeed, all constructions are per definition partly idiosyncratic and in that sense partly idiomatic: 

“What may license referring to some constructions as idioms and not others is merely a reflection of the 

fact that effects of idiomatic variation are best observable in partially schematic complex constructions 

– however, this does not make them fundamentally different in nature from other constructions.” (Wulff, 

2013: 285) 

It is worth noting that constructions are seen as a complex network, ranging from abstract to specific, 

from simple to complex and from schematic to idiomatic constructions. Crucially, this network of con-

structions is thought to be of a probabilistic nature (Croft, 2013; Stefanowitsch, 2013).

Although there may be different ways of adhering to the constructionist approach, we think that (at 

least) two major theoretical claims of CxG have practical consequences for any computational analysis 

of MWEs: 

1. As morphemes are also constructions, MWEs should rather be studied as MMEs (multimor-
phemic expressions). This makes it possible to apply the notion of constructions to the diversity 

of languages (Croft, 2001), and to be coherent with the constructicon. It indeed follows from the 

notion of constructicon that morphology and syntax are two sides of the same coin. For Booij 

(2013), exactly the same principles apply to schematic and idiomatic constructions at morpho-

logical and syntactic level. Thus, “A constructional idiom is a (syntactic or morphological) 

schema in which at least one position is lexically fixed, and at least one position is variable” 

(Booij, 2013: 258).  
2. The network of constructions is of a probabilistic nature, so that statistical associations should 

not (only) be measured between the component parts of MWEs, but also at various levels of 

schematicity and abstraction.  
 

From a practical point of view, point 1 makes it necessary to question the validity of traditional corpus 

analysis based on tokens (the traditional strings of letters separated by a blank). Constructionist mor-

phology (Booij, 2013) suggests that associations between morphemes should be studied in the same way 

as syntactic associations between words, which means that using algorithms based on simple tokens will 

yield incomplete results. Besides, point 2 implies that statistical associations may exist between sche-

matic and specific slots of constructions, which makes it necessary to adapt the corpus data by means of 

POS-tagging or more sophisticated representations. Some promising results have already been achieved 

by collostructional analysis (Gries and Stefanowitsch, 2004; Stefanowitsch, 2013), a methodology that 

makes it possible to quantify association strength in constructions, and is derived from collocational 

approaches used in corpus linguistics. Key findings are the statistical association between verbs and 

argument structure constructions, and the probabilistic relation between abstract grammatical construc-

tions and concrete lexical constructions, the traditional words of the language. By having recourse to 

statistical measures and to linguistic corpora, collostructional analysis confirms that there is a cline from 

grammar to lexicon, and that the global network of all constructions may (largely) be governed by prob-

abilistic principles.  

For all these reasons, the implications of CxG for corpus and computational linguistics should not be 

underestimated, and a number of common practices of both disciplines should be adapted if we apply 

the principles of CxG: 

- Tokenization: the traditional tokens should be questioned and cross-token measures should also 
be tested if we take morphological constructions into account 

- Lemmatization: if morphemes are considered as constructions (Booij, 2013), lemmas should be 
considered as conventional units of meaning, and their concrete realizations (with different af-

fixes) may be as important as the lemmatized form 

- Phonological features: most corpora do not take phonological features into account (intonation, 
word stress), but these are an integral part of the construction. To give just one example, not will 

in most cases be treated as a simple substantive construction inheriting from the abstract NEG-

construction (negation), but it can also be a complex idiomatic construction in cases such as This 

book is excellent. Not! (an ironical way of expressing the opposite of the preceding clause, with 

rising intonation). In this example, the idiomatic construction will have a rising intonation as one 

of its defining features, which should ideally be rendered by corpus annotation.  

 

According to Gries (2013), the automatic extraction of collocations (in the general sense of MWEs) 

from corpora has been going on for over 50 years, but has produced very mixed results. If we add one 

level of complexity, that of constructions as defined by CxG, the situation may get even worse. Most 

studies dedicated to the extraction of MWEs face the problem of the validity of the gold standard. The 

very notion of MWEs may receive slightly different definitions, and it co-exists with other terms such 

as collocations, set phrases, idioms, phraseological units, to name just a few. Finally, formulaic lan-

guage (Wray, 2008) has shed new light on the importance of all kinds of MWEs in the development and 

psychological background of language. 



43

For the reasons set out above, improving the automatic extraction of MWEs from linguistic corpora, 

while integrating the fresh insights gained from CxG, appears at best as a daunting challenge. However, 

we will argue that CxG provides us with the following clues as to the extraction of meaningful structures 

in language: 

1. According to CxG, the whole network of constructions is of a probabilistic nature. 
2. As a consequence, the same statistical method should yield comparable results at the various 

levels of abstraction and specificity. 

3. Improving the extraction algorithm at one point of the probabilistic network (for instance, for the 
extraction of MWEs) should therefore be useful as well for other types of constructions. 

 

It is noteworthy that the continuum from syntax to lexicon, one of the tenets of CxG, poses another 

major problem to the extraction of MWEs. As in information retrieval, precision and recall play a central 

role in automatic extraction of collocations and MWEs, but these two notions can only be tested with 

reference to a gold standard: native speakers provide the researcher with manual results, for instance a 

list of the MWEs or a subcategorization of them. However, the cline from syntax to lexicon and from 

abstract to specific constructions implies that such a task is nigh on impossible, because of the very high 

number of borderline cases between all categories of constructions. 

In this paper, we will argue that working from Chinese word segmentation may offer fresh insights 

into the organization of the probabilistic network of constructions mentioned by CxG. Mandarin Chinese 

is an unsegmented language (words are not separated by a blank). This offers the advantage of a linguis-

tic material that can be analyzed along the whole continuum of constructions, from simple and complex 

words to idioms and proverbs. 

2 Related work 

The very notion of word remains controversial in Mandarin Chinese (Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2002). 

Experiments show that native speakers of Chinese not only disagree among themselves as to the exact 

segmentation of all sentences, but are often unable to replicate their own previous decisions (Bassetti, 

2005). It is generally accepted that there is an agreement of about 75 % among native speakers as to 

the correct segmentation of a Chinese text into words (Sproat et al., 1996; Ying Xu et al., 2010). From 

the point of view of construction grammar, Chinese is therefore an excellent example of the continuum 

between syntax and lexicon, as even native speakers are sometimes confronted with the fuzzy borderline 

between constructions, phrases and words, which results in unclear segmentation.  

In computational linguistics and information retrieval (IR), the state-of-the art method for Chinese 

word segmentation (CWS) is to tokenize an input text by using a monolingual supervised  model trained 

on hand-annotated data, e.g. the Chinese treebank (Xue et al., 2005). It should be emphasized that such 

a method is not quite compatible with construction grammar, as it relies, for segmenting constructions, 

on decisions made by native speakers and dictionaries: this means that the cline from syntax to lexicon, 

and the description of constructions as a whole will depend on elements of linguistic representation 

rather than on evidence gained from corpora.  

A full data-driven and statistical approach to the segmentation of Chinese has been taken by Xu et al. 

(2009), who propose the Tightness Continuum Measure. Their approach is based on document frequen-

cies for segmentation patterns in corpora, and has been tested for 4-grams (in this case 4 Chinese char-

acters or hans). Their results confirm the continuum of ‘tightness and looseness’ (Xu et al., 2009: 9) for 

Chinese strings, but the authors do not mention the fact that this actually corroborates one of the basic 

assumption of construction grammar, viz. the cline from syntax to lexicon. The Tightness Continuum 

Measure has been applied to Chinese information retrieval (CIR) by Xu et al. (2010). Their results show, 

again with the example of Chinese 4-grams, that a segmentation based on the Tightness Continuum 

performs better for CIR. It should be noted, however, that the better scores obtained with the Tightness 

Continuum were measured with scores used in IR and not against manually segmented texts.  

More recent attempts to achieve or improve CWS on the basis of algorithms involve bilingual con-

straints in statistical machine translation (Zeng et al., 2014) or neural networks (Cai and Zhao, 2016).  

It has also been pointed out that there is a high degree of similarity between CWS and MWE extrac-

tion (Xu et al., 2010). This should come as no surprise, if we take the constructionist view that language 

is made up of a complex and probabilistic network of constructions, in which there is no clear border 



44

between (free) syntax and MWEs.  Any progress made in data-driven CWS may therefore have a posi-

tive impact on MWE extraction, and vice versa.  

However, the problem with existing studies is that they are almost always of limited scope, and do 

not deal with both phenomena on a large scale, with recourse to huge linguistic corpora in several lan-

guages. An attempt to fill this gap has been proposed by the IdiomSearch project (Colson, 2017). A 

provisional web application has been designed1 in order to test the automatic extraction of MWEs in the 

broadest sense from large linguistic corpora in English, Spanish, French and (simplified) Mandarin Chi-

nese. The statistical score used is the cpr-score (Colson, 2017), an adaptation of a well-known technique 

used in IR, metric clusters (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). From a mathematical point of view, 

the cpr-score may be described as follows. 

Let a given n-gram of length n be represented as (w1, w2,…,wn), with each wi belonging to the lexicon 

of a given language (for example the 3-gram “spill the beans”). We denote the gram appearing at posi-

tion t in the corpus by the variable xt. Thus, xt = wi means that the gram wi  (e.g. beans), from the n-gram 

(w1, w2,…,wn), is present at position t (represented by a long integer) in the corpus file. 

 We further denote as 

 

𝑛(𝑤1, 𝑤2, … , 𝑤𝑛) ≜ 𝑛(𝑥𝑡 = 𝑤1, 𝑥𝑡+1 = 𝑤2, … , 𝑥𝑡+𝑛−1 = 𝑤𝑛)    (1) 
 

the number of occurrences (frequency) of the exact n-gram (w1, w2,…,wn), for instance the frequency of 

spill the beans, in the whole corpus, with no other token between the component grams (excluding e.g. 

spill the proverbial beans). As indicated in the right-hand side of Equation (1), it aims to count the 

number of occurrences of the event (𝑥𝑡 = 𝑤1, 𝑥𝑡+1 = 𝑤2, … , 𝑥𝑡+𝑛−1 = 𝑤𝑛) in the corpus. 
Moreover, the expression 

 

𝑛(𝑥𝑡1 = 𝑤1, 𝑥𝑡2 = 𝑤2, … , 𝑥𝑡𝑛 =  𝑤𝑛 | max(𝑡𝑖+1 – 𝑡𝑖) ≤ 𝑊;  𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 − 1)  (2) 

 
counts the total number of occurrences of the component grams (e.g. spill, the and beans), appearing 

sequentially at some positions t1 < t2 … < tn, in the corpus but with the constraint that they should be 

separated by a window of less than W + 1 positions (the maximum gap window is less or equal to W). 

The constant variable W (maximum window length) has been experimentally set at an integer value 

corresponding to a distance of 20 to 50 tokens, according to the corpus and the language. For English, 

it is typically set at a value representing a distance of about 20 words (as tokens). 

Thus, (1) will give the exact frequency of the n-gram with no window between the component grams, 

while (2) allows for a maximal window (corresponding to up to 50 tokens) between each gram. The 

final expression used to measure the cpr-score is simply the ratio between (1) and (2): 

 

𝑐𝑝𝑟 =
𝑛(𝑤1, 𝑤2, … , 𝑤𝑛)

𝑛(𝑥𝑡1 = 𝑤1, 𝑥𝑡2 = 𝑤2, … , 𝑥𝑡𝑛 =  𝑤𝑛 | max(𝑡𝑖+1 – 𝑡𝑖) ≤ 𝑊;  𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 − 1)
 

 

Figure 1. The cpr-score 
 

As in the case of metric clusters, the geometric distance between relevant elements of meaning is 

crucial in this approach. The implementation of the cpr-score can be achieved by several computational 

techniques, for instance by measuring the position of the strings in the whole file, by having recourse to 

regular expressions, or by complex indexation systems. The fastest results have been obtained by im-

plementing a query likelihood model (Manning et al., 2009) such as the Lemur Project.2 The Indri Re-

trieval Model included in this project can thus be parameterized to compute cpr-scores on pre-indexed 

corpora. Preliminary results obtained with the cpr-score indicate a level of precision higher than 95 

percent if measured on a list of MWEs from dictionaries. Measuring precision and recall for MWEs of 

length 2 to 12 in real texts, however, poses the thorny theoretical issue of what can be objectively called 

a MWE or an idiomatic construction. It is also worthy of note that the cpr-score, deriving from metric 

clusters, is not fundamentally different from the above mentioned Tightness Continuum (Xu et al., 2010),

based on document frequencies. We would argue that the use of document frequencies is precisely an-

other way of introducing a windowing technique, which can therefore be seen as another variant of 

metric clusters.  

3 An experiment in Chinese word segmentation (CWS) based on MWE recognition 

As we have seen in section 1, construction grammar claims that there is a cline from syntax to lexicon, 

and that the structure of language therefore consists of a complex network of interrelated constructions. 

If this theoretical claim is correct, algorithms that are designed to extract MWEs should also be able to 

extract lexical constructions, provided that the corpus is adapted to that purpose. For European lan-

guages, it will for instance be necessary to start from morphemes instead of (conventional) words. In 

the case of Chinese, construction grammar predicts that looking for larger elements of meaning against 

the backdrop of a network of constructions will bring segmentation (CWS) and MWE recognition very 

close to each other.  

In this paper we report the first results of an innovative experiment designed to test this general hy-

pothesis. 

  

3.1 Methodology 

As this experiment is an extension of the IdiomSearch Project, we used as a reference corpus the same 

Mandarin Chinese corpus: a web-based general corpus, compiled by the WebBootCat tool provided by 

the Sketch Engine.3 The methodology for compiling a general web corpus on the basis of seed words is 

fully described in Baroni et al. (2009). The likewise assembled corpus of (simplified) Mandarin Chinese 

comprises about 1 billion Chinese characters; as most Chinese words found in dictionaries consist of 2 

characters, and some of 3 characters or more, we can estimate about 300 million words in the reference 

corpus. The corpus was indexed using the Lemur toolkit mentioned in section 2.  

As we wanted to test the validity of a general purpose statistical score designed for MWE extraction 

at various levels (from bigrams to 12-grams), we implemented the cpr-score on the indexed corpus, by 

means of a Perl script. As there are some limitations inherent to very frequent records on a query likeli-

hood model, all request yielding the maximum frequency of 50,000 were treated by another section of 

the script, in which a regular expression implemented the cpr-score on a non-indexed version of the 

same corpus. The average processing time for every request was 0.07 second on the indexed corpus, and 

1.5 second on the non-indexed corpus (running on a pc with Linux).  

In order to measure the performance of the cpr-score for CWS, we used the well-known MSR dataset, 

from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005). For computing 

recall, precision and F-score of the segmented text, we used the standard scoring program (Perl script) 

provided by the Bakeoff.4  

As in the case of the Tightness Continuum (Xu et al., 2010), the methodology for segmenting the input 

text was purely statistical, and used no list of training words or dictionaries of any kind. It should be 

stressed that such a methodology is purely data-driven, and rests upon the theoretical assumption that 

language structure itself includes recurrent patterns of meaning that can be captured by an algorithm, 

with no human intervention or any decision based on linguistic norm or culture.  

Our computer program implementing the cpr-score proceeds as follows. Each Chinese character (han) 

is added one at a time, and the score is computed on the reference corpus. Let us take a simple example: 

the Chinese word5 高等教育 (gāoděng jiàoyù, higher education). Our algorithm first considers the bi-

gram 高等 and checks its cpr-score on the reference corpus: 0.64. The cpr-score ranges from 0 to 1, and 

the high significance threshold has been experimentally set at 0.40 (Colson, 2017). Then, the third gram 

is added, 教, and the score for the trigram 高等教 is measured: 0.84. As the score is going up, the trigram 

is left unsegmented. Finally, the last gram 育 is added, and the score for the fourgram 高等教育 is 

computed, which yields 0.90. Again, the score is going up, so that the whole fourgram is left unseg-

mented.

3.2 Results and discussion 

Table 1 presents the results obtained by our experimental segmenter based on the cpr-score (Seg-cpr) 

and by a state-of-the-art segmenter, the Stanford segmenter6, for the MSR dataset.

Stanford-segmenter 0.882 0.843 0.862 

Table 1: Results of CWS by means of Seg-cpr and Stanford-segmenter. 

 

As shown in Table 1, the results obtained by our experimental segmenter based on the cpr-score are 

obviously less good than those of the Stanford segmenter, but this hardly comes as a surprise, as the cpr-

score was not designed for CWS in the first place. We have also stressed in section 3.1. that our meth-

odology, contrary to state-of-the-art segmenters such as the Stanford segmenter, does not rely on seg-

mented corpora or on dictionaries, but only on statistical attraction as measured by the cpr-score. Con-

trary to most segmenters, it is not a mirror of how language users tend to segment the language, but of 

how the language itself contains statistically significant elements of meaning. 

It is besides quite striking that the recall rate obtained by Seg-cpr (0.749) comes very close to the 

average rate of segmentation agreement among native speakers of Chinese (0.75, as mentioned in sec-

tion 1). Contrary to manually segmented corpora, or to segmenters based on dictionary learning or seg-

mentation pattern learning, our results are objectively measured by the algorithm on an unsegmented 

reference corpus. For this reason alone, a recall of 0.749 computed from the gold standard established 

by Chinese native speakers is quite high. 

A fine-tuned analysis makes these results even more intriguing. In 5 to 10 percent of the cases, wrong 

segmentation by Seg-cpr was simply due to the fact that the n-gram was not used a single time on the 

reference corpus of about 250-300 million words. As the cpr-score, on which the tool is based, requires 

a frequency of at least 3 occurrences, the absence of an n-gram / word from the reference corpus inevi-

tably leads to wrong segmentation, but this is to be blamed on the corpus size, not on the algorithm.  

Taking a closer look at cases of obviously wrong segmentation by Seg-cpr raises other intriguing 

questions. One has to do with discontinuous sequences, a central issue in construction grammar as well. 

As a matter of fact, another 5 to 10 percent of the instances of wrong segmentation by Seg-cpr is due to 

discontiuous statistical association. Let us take the example of a Chinese fivegram from the MSR da-

taset, considered as one word by the gold standard, 个人计算机 (gèrén jìsuànjī, personal computer). 
Table 2 shows the cpr-score and the frequency of the different levels of grams in our reference corpus. 

 

 Cpr-score Frequency 

个人 0.63 97,167 

个人计 0.18 171 

个人计算 0.55 140 

个人计算机 0.73 122 

Table 2: cpr-score and frequency of the component grams of 个人计算机 (gèrén jìsuànjī).  

 
As shown in table 2, the fivegram 个人计算机 (gèrén jìsuànjī, personal computer), is identified as a 
whole as a very significant  statistical association (cpr-score > 0.40), but working with one gram (in this 

case, a Chinese han) at a time reveals that the score goes down at the level of the trigram, and then up 

again. This is a clear example of a discontinuous association between successive Chinese characters, 

and is by no means an exception. The same situation occurs within several Chinese idioms in the source 

text, e.g. 付之东流 (fùzhīdōngliú, to lose sth irrevocably), and this also holds true of many foreign words 

that are transliterated into Chinese, e.g. 马克思主义 (mǎkèsīzhǔyì, Marxism) or 卡斯帕罗夫 
(kǎsīpàluōfū, Kasparov). In all those cases, our experimental methodology worked gram per gram, and 

the cpr-score was therefore unable to segment correctly. A further elaboration of the methodology should

address this complex issue. Results such as these are actually a confirmation of the global statistical 

association, as measured by the cpr-score, between elements of meaning in Chinese (words, colloca-

tions, idioms). They also mean that the results of our experimental Seg-cpr tool (with already a recall of 

0.749 for the MSR dataset) could be further improved by introducing a more complex algorithm taking 

discontinuous cases into consideration. It should further be pointed out that similar cases of discontinu-

ous association measured by the cpr-score have been noted for idiomatic constructions in English (Col-

son, 2017), e.g. long time no see or the next thing I knew.  

All in all, the results of this experiment confirm our hypothesis that MWE extraction and CWS are 

closely related. The cpr-score was designed in the first place for MWE extraction, and yields convincing 

results for English, Spanish and French. In this experiment, we have used it for Chinese segmentation 

in a simplistic way, by adding one gram at a time. Even then, the overall recall rate is pretty high (0.749) 

and reaches the average rate of agreement between Chinese native speakers. Besides, a closer analysis 

reveals that taking discontinuous association into account would further increase recall and precision. 

From a theoretical point of view, such a complex network of probabilistic associations is quite compat-

ible with construction grammar. The interesting cases of discontinuous associations may even provide 

us with some clues about the possible extraction of more complex constructions, as we will see in the 

following section. 

 

3.3 Clues as to automatic extraction of constructions 

As stated above, a statistical extraction method that is fully compatible with construction grammar 

should be able to deal with all constructions: lexical constructions (as in the case of Chinese word seg-

mentation), idiomatic ones (e.g. MWEs), but also constructions with more schematic slots (e.g. X take 

Y into account), and maybe even abstract constructions such as the ditransitive construction. 
Our clustering method (the cpr-score) already yields promising results for CWS and MWE extraction, 

but we may wish to test it further on more schematic or abstract constructions. This may indeed be 

beneficial to the improvement of grammatical material selection in language teaching, and may contrib-

ute to providing more evidence for the statistical grounding of construction grammar. 
As a simple clustering algorithm, the cpr-score is non-parametric and can therefore be easily extended 

to longer sequences. Besides, it allows for complex implementations in databases using a query likeli-

hood model, but also very simple ones in the form of regular expressions (regexes). The recourse to 

complex regexes makes it possible to check the cpr-score for schematic or abstract constructions, pro-

vided that the corpus annotation contains information on the construction under investigation. 
The crux of the matter is indeed to extract constructions from corpora containing sufficient annotation 

techniques. As stated in section 1, a corpus used for the extraction of complex constructions should 

ideally include information related to intonation. In the meantime, using large POS-tagged corpora al-

ready provides us with a lot of testable material with respect to schematic constructions. Let us start 
from the fairly simple construction the more… the more. If construction grammar is right, corpora should 

be able to reveal that there is statistical association between them, even though the length of the window 

may vary. We may easily test it with the cpr-score by choosing a window of 8 words between the two 

parts of the construction, and by using our experimental program Construction Extractor, based on re-

gexes.7 In this case, the cpr-score obtained with a randomly selected portion (200 million tokens) of the 

ukWac corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) reaches 0.64 for a frequency of 1332: as might have been expected, 

there is indeed a measurable association between the more and the more, even with as many as 8 words 

between them.  
Our aim was to test more complex constructions on a tagged corpus of about 100 million tokens. For 

this purpose, we used another randomly selected portion of the ukWac corpus (Baroni et al., 2009), and 

we had recourse to the Stanford POS tagger8 for tagging it. According to CxG, the probabilistic network 

of constructions is valid at various levels of abstraction and schematicity. As a matter of fact, part of that 

complex interplay between morpho-syntactic features can easily be captured by considering the tagged 

                                                      
7 The simple implementation of the cpr-score by means of regexes involves a division between resp. the frequency with the 

smaller window (in this case, 8 words) and the larger window (which we set on the basis of previous experiments at 10 times 

the smaller window). In Perl syntax, the regex for the frequency with the larger window may simply look like this: 

/the\smore\s(\S+\s){0,80}the\smore/i

corpus as a geometrical space in which metric clustering can be measured. In other words, the statistical 

clustering algorithm (in this case the cpr-score) will just be looking for the association between parts of 

constructions and specific tags, as shown in table 3. 

 
 Cpr-score Frequency Window (w) 

it is w ADJ w what 0.12 428 4 

it is w amazing w what  0.52 11 4 

Table 3: cpr-score and frequency of a schematic construction and a derived MWE.9 

 

Table 3 displays the cpr-score and the frequency for the MWE it is amazing what on the 100 million 

word part of the ukWac corpus, tagged by the Stanford POS tagger, given a maximal window of 4 words 

before and after the adjective amazing. This MWE, a specific lexical (and partly idiomatic) construction 

actually inherits (in CxG parlance) from the more schematic construction it is ADJ what. As shown in 

table 3, we can measure a weaker association at this more schematic level as well. The lowest signifi-

cance threshold of the cpr-score has been (experimentally) set at 0.065, so that a score of 0.12 is suffi-

cient to detect such a degree of association prevailing within more schematic constructions.  

Other examples of schematic constructions that were extensively studied in the literature on CxG 

(Hoffmann and Trousdale, 2013) include the Ditransitive construction (e.g. give a book to someone) and 

the All-cleft /Wh-cleft construction (as in all he had to do was to arrive on time). As illustrated by table 

4, our POS-tagged corpus also yields association scores for these constructions. 

 

 

 Cpr-score Frequency Window (w) 

NOUN VERB w NOUN w NOUN10 0.27 163979 5 

all PRONOUN w VERBPast w VERBPast11 0.29 460 7 

 

Table 4: cpr-score and frequency for the Ditransitive and All-cleft construction 

 

Table 4 displays in the first line an approximation of the ditransitive construction in the tagged corpus, 

just taking into account nouns followed by a verb, followed by two nouns, with windows of 5 words in 

both cases. Even at this level of abstraction, it is noteworthy that the cpr-score implemented by a simple 

regex is able to measure some statistical attraction. The same holds true of the All-cleft construction in 

the second line of table 4. In this case, we restricted the search to the presence of two verbs in the past 

within a window of seven words. The regex in footnote 11 was of course checked for its validity, and it 

yields sentences (with the Stanford POS tags) such as All DT he PRP did VBD the DT whole JJ time NN 

was VBD tell VB me PRP about IN, or All DT he PRP had VBD really RB expected VBN was VBD now 

RB propped VBN up RP on IN his PRP$ bedside NN table NN. As predicted by CxG, there is indeed a 

measurable statistical attraction in the very structure of the All-cleft itself, as the cpr-score reaches 

a significant level of 0.29.  

Our preliminary research yields similar levels of attraction for other cases of schematic constructions. 

For instance, the Verb Object Prep construction (as in take a lot of effort) yields a cpr-score of 0.31 for 

a frequency of 212 001, with a window of 3 words; similarly, the As-Noun comparison construction 

(e.g. as bright as stars) displays a score of 0.53 for a frequency of 429, with a window of 2 words.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                      
9 The output of the Stanford POS tagger was adapted by a Perl script, replacing the underscore signs by blanks, so that a sim-

ple regex could be used for measuring the cpr-score: /it\sPRP\sis\sVBZ\s(\S+\s){0,40}\S+\sJJ\s(\S+\s){0,40}what\sWP/i 
10 Regex used: /NN\s\S+\sV\S*\s(\S+\s){0,50}NN\s(\S+\s){0,50}NN/  
11 Regex used: /all\sDT\S+\sPRP\s(\S+\s){0,70}VBD\s(\S+\s){0,70}VBD/i

4 Conclusions 

 

Starting from CxG’s claim that there is a cline from syntax to lexicon and a complex network of con-

structions in language, at various levels of abstraction and schematicity, we have performed a first ex-

periment on Chinese Word Segmentation. Algorithms used in CWS are usually trained on hand-anno-

tated data, and are therefore a reflection of culture and tradition. However, we wanted to test to what 

extent an algorithm (the cpr-score) used for MWE extraction would yield results for CWS. For the 

reference text used, our algorithm reached a recall of 0.749 measured automatically from a gold standard 

established by native speakers. This may hardly be due to chance, as our segmentation method implied 

a binary choice at every single Chinese character. Besides, our recall score reaches the average degree 

of agreement between native speakers of Chinese. An analysis of the wrong cases of segmentation re-

veals that a discontinuous methodology may still improve the overall score on the basis of the same 

algorithm.  

Our aim was not to provide a better segmenter for Chinese, because state-of-the-art tools trained on 

annotated data will inevitably reach higher scores measured on the same type of annotated data. We just 

wanted to test the hypothesis that CWS displays many similarities with MWE. The fact that a simple 

implementation of the cpr-score, designed in the first place for MWE extraction in European languages, 

reaches acceptable rates for CWS is a striking conclusion, that seems only compatible with one of the 

tenets of CxG: words are expressions and vice versa, as all language structure is just a network of con-

structions.  

Building on these findings, we carried out a second experiment devoted to the extraction of more 

schematic or abstract constructions. Our preliminary results suggest that what is valid at the level of 

words and expressions will also be applicable to more schematic levels, so that the cpr-score or other 

clustering algorithms may be used for identifying constructions. The next application of this methodol-

ogy may be the automatic extraction of the most fixed and recurrent schematic / partly schematic / 

idiomatic / abstract contexts of frequent verbs or nouns, based on the same algorithm.
