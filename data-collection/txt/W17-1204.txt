Abstract

This paper investigates diatopic variation
in a historical corpus of German. Based on
equivalent word forms from different lan-
guage areas, replacement rules and map-
pings are derived which describe the re-
lations between these word forms. These
rules and mappings are then interpreted as
reflections of morphological, phonological
or graphemic variation. Based on sample
rules and mappings, we show that our ap-
proach can replicate results from historical
linguistics. While previous studies were
restricted to predefined word lists, or con-
fined to single authors or texts, our ap-
proach uses a much wider range of data
available in historical corpora.

1 Introduction

In this paper we give an outline of our joint
endeavor—combining computational and German
historical linguistics—to develop a set of meth-
ods with the goal of uncovering and investigat-
ing the whole range of variation on the word level
in a large scale corpus of historical texts. This
is in contrast to traditional approaches in histori-
cal linguistics, who often use a predefined list of
carefully-selected words for comparing linguistic
variation.

In recent years, an increasing number of corpora
of historical German has been built and published,
including reference corpora of historical German,
some still under construction (Donhauser, 2015;
Klein et al., 2016; Schmitz et al., 2013; Peters
and Nagel, 2014). Data from texts of historical
and thus non-standard German is always strongly
characterized by variation on every level of the
language system. Hence, designing methods to
gather and analyze the scope and scale of variation

present in these corpora is a hot topic as well as a
methodological challenge. Purely manual analysis
is ruled out by the large amount of data provided
by these corpora, necessitating the application of
automatic methods.

We address the challenge of dealing with such
data by way of systematic and exhaustive com-
parison of words that are variants of each other.
To test and develop the comparative methods pre-
sented here we use the Anselm Corpus (Dipper and
Schultz-Balluff, 2013).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 ad-
dresses prior work done in this area. In Section 3,
we introduce the Anselm Corpus that we used in
our comparison. Sections 4 and 5 present the com-
parison and its results, followed by a conclusion in
Section 6.

2 Related Work

In recent years, spelling variation in non-standard
data, such as historical texts or texts from social
media, has come into focus in Natural Language
Processing. Most often, variation is dealt with
by normalization, i.e. mapping variants to some
standard form (for historical data, see Piotrowski
(2012, chap. 6)). The main focus of this research
has been on how to automatize the normalization
process, which is often a preparatory step to facili-
tate further processing of historical language data,
e.g. by search tools or taggers (e.g. Jurish (2010),
Bollmann (2012)). Some work addresses the ex-
tent of variance found in the data (e.g. Baron et
al. (2009)). However, the derived mappings them-
selves that map historical to modern word forms
are usually not in the focus of interest (but see
Barteld et al. (2016)).

In contrast, theoretical linguists researching lan-
guage evolution and language varieties are in-
terested in these mappings, which highlight the

36



differences between the languages. Tradition-
ally, historical linguistic research is mainly based
on morphological and phonological properties.
For instance, the relationships between the Indo-
European languages have been established on the
base of shared inflectional properties and phonetic
relations, such as the first and second Germanic
consonant shift. Similarly, dialect classification
mainly depends on phonological and morpholog-
ical features, with syntactic properties playing a
minor role.

Language comparison in this spirit is based on
specific language data: for sound-based compari-
son, lists of parallel words in different languages
or language stages are usually used, such as the
classical Swadesh list (Swadesh, 1955) or lists that
have been compiled more recently for various lan-
guages (see, e.g., the data used in Jäger et al.
(2017)). The challenge is then to identify related
words, such as cognates and loan words, and unre-
lated words. The number of cognates between two
languages serves as a measure of relatedness. In
some approaches, no distinction is made between
“real cognates”, which are etymologically related,
and words that are related due to some process
other than strict inheritance.

In contrast to these approaches, we do not
restrict our comparisons to single words from
carefully-compiled word lists but aim at using as
much data as possible from available corpora.

3 The Data

The data we use to test and refine our method
has been extracted from the Anselm Corpus, which
consists of about 50 versions of the medieval text
Interrogatio Sancti Anselmi de Passione Domini
(‘Questions by Saint Anselm about the Lord’s Pas-
sion’). The text is a dialogue between St. Anselm
and the Virgin Mary, who recounts the events of
the passion. The versions are from different lan-
guage areas and time periods from Early New
High German (1350–1600). Since they deal with
the same topic, the overlap in content and vocab-
ulary is large. Hence, the data provides a perfect
basis for diatopic research. The map in Figure 1
gives an impression of the wide distribution of
the different versions across the German language
area.

Each word form in the Anselm Corpus has
been manually annotated by its modern German
translation (Bollmann et al., 2012). We define

Figure 1: Distribution of the Anselm texts
across the German-speaking area. Each
marker represents one text (map taken from
https://www.linguistics.rub.de/
anselm/corpus/map.html).

as shared or equivalent all historical word forms
whose modern translations are identical. For in-
stance, vffston in an Alemannic text and vpstain in
a Ripuarian text are considered equivalent because
they both correspond to modern German aufstehen
‘stand up’. The investigations we present in this
paper are based on such shared, equivalent word
forms occurring in different texts.

Table 1 gives an overview of the temporal and
regional distribution of shared words in the Anselm
data.1 The table shows that the Anselm Corpus
has a good coverage of the 15th century, and that
mbair is the best-documented language area.

We selected seven texts from different language
areas for diatopic comparison. The comparison
starts with texts written in the same language area

114 means ‘14th century’, 14.1 means ‘first half of the
14th century’ (i.e. 1300–1350), etc. The language areas are:
alem: Alemannic, hchalem: High Alemannic, mbair: Central
Bavarian, nbair: North Bavarian, obs: Upper Saxon, rhfrk:
Rhine-Franconian, rip: ‘Ripuarian’, schwaeb: ‘Swabian’;
thuer: ‘Thuringian’.

adjacent language areas that belong to the same
major dialect (mbair→ nbair). Finally, texts from
different dialects are compared, which are sepa-
rated by the Speyer line, an isogloss separating the
language areas called ‘Central German’ and ‘Up-
per German’ (rhfrk→ schwaeb/bair).

Table 2 shows the overlap between the texts that
we compared.2

4 Diatopic Comparison

As mentioned above, the diatopic comparisons are
based on equivalent word forms. This section de-
scribes how these forms are found and how they
form the base of comparison.

2The identifiers used here (M4 etc.) are the sigla of
the individual texts, as defined in the Anselm corpus, see
https://www.linguistics.ruhr-uni-bochum.
de/anselm/corpus/german.html for a list. The
sigla are derived from the respective repositories, e.g. M4 is
stored in Munich (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek).

Text 1 Text 2 Normalization
M4: bedürfen M3: pedurffen bedürfen ‘require’
Ba2: pitten B3: biten bitten ‘ask’
St: uch D4: aüch euch ‘you (pl)’

Table 3: Examples of equivalent word forms.

4.1 Finding Equivalent Word Forms

All original word forms in the Anselm Corpus
have been manually normalized to the correspond-
ing modern German word forms (Bollmann et al.,
2012). All word forms with identical normaliza-
tions are considered equivalent.3 For each pair of
texts, equivalent word forms were collected and
paired. Table 3 shows some sample pairs.

4.2 Deriving Rewrite Rules and
Levenshtein-based Mappings

Similarities and differences between the equiva-
lent word forms are modeled by means of ‘Rewrite
rules’ and Levenshtein-based mappings (for de-
tailed description and comparison of both meth-
ods, see Bollmann (2012)).

Rewrite rules Given a pair of equivalent word
forms, both forms are first aligned at the character
level, see (1a) which aligns the equivalent word
forms biten and pitten (bitten, ‘ask’) (for details,
see Bollmann et al. (2011)). (1b) is an alternative
representation of the alignments. In the following,

3In order to diminish data sparseness, word forms with
identical normalization but differing morphological proper-
ties were also considered equivalent, e.g. chrawcze (M3,
mostly dative case) and creucz (B3, any case), both normal-
ized as kreuz ‘cross’.

38



the format of (1b) is used in the presentation of
examples.

(1) a.
B3 b i t e n

Ba2 p i t t e n

b. |b=p|i=i|t=t|=t|e=e|n=n|

From these character alignments, rewrite rules
are derived that replace characters from the first
word to arrive at the second word. The word pair
in (1) gives rise to the context-aware replacement
rules shown in (2). ‘#’ indicates word boundaries,
‘E’ represents the empty string.

(2) a. b → p | # _ i
“Replace word-initial ‘b’ by ‘p’, if fol-
lowed by ‘i”’

b. E → t | i _ t
“Insert ‘t’ between ‘i’ and ‘t”’

In addition to the replacement rules, “identity
rules” are derived, recording the characters that are
identical in both word forms, see (3) and (4) for the
identity rules derived from (1).4

(3) a. i → i | p _ t
b. t → t | t _ e
c. e → e | t _ e
d. n → n | e _ #

(4) a. E → E | # _ p
b. E → E | p _ i
c. E → E | t _ e
d. E → E | e _ n
e. E → E | n _ #

The rules derived from a text pair are collected
and counted. Table 4 shows the top five identity
and non-identity rules with their frequencies, as
derived from the equivalent word forms of B3 and
Ba2. The interpretation of these rules is addressed
below.

4The left context is checked against the target word form,
the right context against the source form. The rules can also
map sequences of characters, thus considering larger context.
For details see Bollmann et al. (2011).
The rules in (4) prevent the insertion of characters at specific
positions.

19 E → e | r _ n
17 n → E | a _ n
16 j → i | # _ o
14 j → i | # _ u

0.202549 ei → ai
0.220936 te → tte
0.227544 enn → en

Table 5: Least weighted mappings derived from
B3→ Ba2.

Levenshtein-based mappings Another way of
modeling the relation between both word forms
is by means of weighted Levenshtein-based map-
pings, which map character sequences of varying
length. The more often a certain mapping has been
observed in the data, the smaller its weight or cost.
According to Levenshtein, identity mappings are
the cheapest mappings with zero costs.

Some sample mappings derived from the exam-
ple pair in (1a) are provided in (5). Table 5 shows
the top five cheapest mappings derived from B3
and Ba2.

b. bi → pi

c. te → tte

d. t → tt

4.3 Interpreting the Rules and Mappings

The notation of the rules and mappings makes use
of ‘→’, implying that there is a directed relation
between the two word forms, which takes one of
the forms as the input and produces the other form

Rule Analysis
c → E | # _ z Graphemic variation: <cz> or <z> representing /ts/ in initial position
E → e | r _ n Syncope (loss) of <e> representing /@/ before final <n>
n → E | a _ n <n> or <nn> representing /n/
j → i | # _ o Graphemic variation: <j> or <i> in initial position
j → i | # _ u

as the output. This interpretation may seem ad-
equate for diachronic changes where we can say
that the later form evolves out of the former form.
For diatopic relations, a bidirectional interpreta-
tion seems more sensible, simply stating that a cer-
tain character (or character sequence) in one lan-
guage area corresponds to another one in the other
language area.

The (non-identity) rules and mappings often en-
code interesting relations, such as b → p, which
indicates (de)voicing of plosives. In the next sec-
tion, we go through a set of selected rules and
mappings, discussing the range of phenomena that
can be observed.

Ultimately we aim at using the rules and map-
pings for automatic clustering of texts relating to
the crucial factors in language variation, language
area and time, as well as other parameters—if they
are included in the metadata the corpus provides—
such as text type/function. Speaking from the per-
spective of historical linguistics, we hope to fur-
ther enhance methodology by facilitating exhaus-
tive analyses of larger corpora. Of course, this ap-
proach must be able to bear comparison to pre-
vious non-exhaustive approaches. It should be
able to reflect previous, well-substantiated find-
ings, such as the results of the High German con-
sonant shift, but it should also be able to allow for
new insights and eventually to draw a more de-
tailed picture. The examples discussed in the next
section were selected in a way to show that our
approach will be able to satisfy both criteria.

5 First Results

Before discussing some results in detail, we would
like to begin this section by giving an impression
of how to interpret the replacement rules extracted
by the method described above.

Table 6 gives linguistic analyses for the top non-
identity rules of the pairing B3 → Ba2 (listed in
Table 4).

The interpretation of the rewrite rules has to

take into account which texts have been paired, in
particular their spatial and temporal relation. In
the example, we have paired two texts from the
same period and the same area (Bavarian), but
from different regions: Ba2 is a North Bavarian
text, and B3 a Central Bavarian text, so we do not
expect to see any diachronic variation here, and
diatopic variation only to some extent.

The rules derived from the corpus show vari-
ants which are related to different levels of linguis-
tic variation on the word level: to morphological,
phonological and graphemic variation. To clas-
sify the rules as morphological, phonological or
graphemic, the underlying word forms have to be
consulted. As an example, see the list of 26 align-
ments in Table 7 that the rule in (6) has been de-
rived from. The list of alignments shows all word
forms starting with an inital affricate /ts/, which is
encoded by <cz> in B3 on the one hand and by
<z> in Ba2 on the other hand. As can be seen, the
graphematic variation <cz>/<z> concerns a vari-
ety of different lemmas but becomes visible as a
pattern through the rewrite rule.

(6) B3→ Ba2: c → E | # _ z

In some cases (9 instances), Ba2 also uses <cz>,
like B3, triggering an identity rule, (7).

(7) B3→ Ba2: c → c | # _ z

Morphological variation When pairing a Cen-
tral German text, St (from the Rhine-Franconian
area (Mainz)) with any of the Bavarian Upper Ger-
man texts (Ba2, M4, M3, B3) from the same time
period—the latter in order to rule out diachronic
variation—the rule shown in (8) sticks out in all
comparisons, see Table 8. To give an impres-
sion of the type of rules and their frequencies that
have been derived, the table provides the three top-
ranked (non-identity) rules for each pairing.

Table 8: Three top-ranked replacement rules, as
derived from pairing a Central German text (St)
with different Upper German texts.

This rule is triggered mainly by varying inflec-
tional verb forms, such as gaben vs. gabent ‘(they)
gave’, haben vs. habent ‘(they) have’, kommen
vs. komment ‘(they) come’, glauben vs. glaubent
‘(they) believe’, etc.

Rule (8) reflects a well-known case of dia-
topic morphological variation in the Early New
High German period: Upper German strongly
tends towards -ent as inflectional marker for plu-
ral verb forms, whereas Central German prefers
-en (Dammers et al., 1988, §74ff.).

The Levenshtein-based mappings confirm the
picture. Table 9 shows the top mappings for three
of the pairings in Table 8. Only with the pairing
St → B3 (mbair), there is no respective mapping
among the top-ranked ones.

B2 is another text from the Rhine-Franconian
area but has been located further south than St (see
Figure 2). If B2 is paired with the same Upper Ger-
man texts (Ba2, M4, M3, B3), the results do not
contain rule (8) at all, or their frequency is much
lower. This also reflects the findings presented in
Dammers et al. (1988, §76ff.), who show that the
distribution of the variants -ent vs. -en does not co-
incide completely with the isoglosse(s) separating
Upper from Central German, and -ent is instead
common farther to the north.

These examples show that the method proposed
in this paper is able to confirm results of previous
research, i.e. it is possible to derive constraints on
the localization of these texts by means of their
‘linguistic footprint’ as mirrored in these rules.

Phonological variation We next look at a rule
that is related to the High German consonant shift,
see (9).

(9) St→ D4: E → f | #p _ e
example: penning vs. pfenni(n)g

The rule in (9)5 has been derived from pairing St
with a Swabian text, D4. D4 is a borderline case,
i.e. located on the border between Upper and Cen-
tral German, which is indicated by the isoglosse
called Germersheim Line. This line marks the shift
of Germanic /p/ to affricate /pf/ in initial position,
see Figure 2. Rule (9) locates D4 south of the Ger-
mersheim Line.

Another example of phonologically-based vari-
ation is the rule in (10)6. This rule clearly iden-
tifies St as a Rhine-Franconian text, showing /d/
instead of Upper German /t/ in initial or medial
position, see Table 10.

variation, especially when it comes to graphemic
variation.

Suitable examples come from pairing neigh-
boring texts, e.g. Ba2 → M4, two texts from
North Bavaria (nbair). This pairing generates
rules which correspond mainly to graphemic vari-
ation, in contrast to pairings of different language
areas, as in the previous section, see the examples
in Table 11.

In applying the method proposed in this pa-
per systematically and exhaustively, a highly nu-
anced picture of graphemic variation will become
observable. In systematically assessing the re-
placement rules derived from a balanced corpus
of historical texts we hope to be able to ascer-
tain a complete picture of graphemic variation, i.e.
which variants were available and were preferred
by scribes in different areas.

6 Conclusion

We hope that our approach will help filling re-
search gaps in historical linguistics. Thus far, re-
search had to cope with a lack of corpora on the
one hand, and the restrictedness of retrieval meth-
ods on the other hand. Therefore, previous stud-
ies in historical graphematics were inevitably re-
stricted and of a merely exemplary nature.

Of course, the exemplary segments these stud-
ies have been focussing on—copies of one text
in Glaser (1985), texts by one and the same au-
thor in Wiesinger (1996), German prints of the
bible translated by Martin Luther in Rieke (1998),
texts originating from one scribal office in Moser
(1977) and texts from one specific place (Duis-
burg) in Mihm (2004) and Elmentaler (1998;
2001; 2003)—have been selected applying expe-
dient criteria. The studies have been able to pro-

vide insight into a very small, if significant area,
leaving the rest of the map to remain blank.

This is where our approach comes in. The
characteristics of the bundle of methods described
above is that we aim at capturing the whole range
of variation documented in historical corpora, and
that we do so by ‘joining forces’ and mustering ex-
pertise from NLP as well as from German histori-
cal linguistics. In this way we make sure that the
results delivered by the computational methods fit
the requirements of actual variation analysis and
are therefore to be considered not only usable, but
beneficial for future corpus-based historical lin-
guistics. Our approach will be applicable to cor-
pora with a normalization layer—which is the case
for the reference corpora of historical German.

As Table 1 shows, the Anselm Corpus does
not allow for comprehensive diachronic analyses.
When applied to a corpus which covers a larger
time period than the Anselm Corpus, we expect
the proposed method to discover both diachronic
and diatopic variation. Language change never
occurs as a sudden change or replacement of one
variant by the other but involves a period of co-
existences of multiple variants. Hence, language
change will become visible as changes in fre-
quency of the variants involved (cf. Wegera and
Waldenberger (2012, 25)), starting out with an in-
creasing number of instances of the new variant
and—if the process is successful—resulting in a
decrease of the older variant. Such changes in fre-
quency will translate into the rewrite rules gener-
ated by our method, specifically into the ratio be-
tween non-identity rules and their corresponding
identity rules.
