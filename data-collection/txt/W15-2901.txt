Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphors 

Dr. Zornitsa Kozareva – Yahoo!  

 

Abstract: Understanding metaphor rich texts like "Her lawyer is a shark", "Time is 

money”, “We need to construct a strong argument” and the affect associated with 

them is a challenging problem, which has been of interest to the research 

community for a long time. One crucial challenge is to build an automated system 

that can identify the polarity and valence associated with metaphors and create 

multilingual platform for that. In this talk, I will introduce the task of multilingual 

sentiment analysis of metaphors and will present novel algorithms that integrate 

affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. 

Finally, by running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Farsi and Russian, I 

will show that the method is portable and works equally well when applied to 

different languages.
