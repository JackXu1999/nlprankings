ABSTRACT 

Current mobile devices do not support Bangla (or Bengali) Input method. Due to this many 

Bangla language speakers have to write Bangla in mobile phone using English alphabets. During 

this time they used to write English foreign words using English spelling. This tendency also 

exists when writing in computer using phonetically input methods, which cause many typing 

mistakes. In this scenario, computer transliteration input method need to correct the foreign 

words written using English spelling. In this paper, we proposed a transliteration input method 

for Bangla language. For English foreign words, the system used International-Phonetic-

Alphabet(IPA)-based transliteration method for Bangla language. Our proposed approach 

improved the quality of Bangla transliteration input method by 14 points.

1 Introduction 

Bengali or Bangla is the official language of Bangladesh. Currently Bangladesh has 72.963 

million mobile phone users. It is important to have Bengali input method for this huge number of 

Bengali language speakers. Although Bangladesh government declared standard keyboard layout 

for both computer and mobile device, currently there is no national standard for transliteration 

using English alphabets. Due to this there are many ambiguities in mapping 50 Bengali letters 

using 26 English letters. Different people have different assumptions on phonetic input system 

for Bengali language using English letters. These ambiguities effect the human communication, 

using mobile or emails, where people had no other choice except using English letters to write 

Bengali messages.   

In this kind of scenario most people used to write English foreign words using English 

spelling. These ambiguities effect the human communication using SMS or email.  In this kind of 

scenario most people used to write English foreign words using English spelling. To understand 

this kind of message needs a sophisticated phonetic input method for mobile devices. Bengali 

also needs a standard transliteration mechanism considering these issues. Such a transliteration 

scheme should be simple rule-base to minimize the computational resources. 

In this paper, we propose a phonetic Bengali input method for computer and mobile devices. 

Our approach is a pattern-based transliteration mechanism. For handling foreign words, we used 

International-Phonetic-Alphabet(IPA)-based transliteration. Proposed system first tries to find if 

the word exists in English IPA diction-ary. If the word is not available in the English dictionary it 

uses the mechanism as proposed with Akkhor Bangla Software and a Bengali lexicon database to 

transliterate meaningful words. Our proposed approach improved the quality of Bangla 

transliteration input method by 14 points.

2 Related Works  

There were several attempts in building Bengali transliteration systems. The first available free 

transliteration system from Bangladesh was Akkhor Bangla Software1. Akkhor was first released 

on 2003 which became very popular among computer users.  

Zaman et. al. (2006) presented a phonetics based transliteration system for English to Bangla 

which produces intermediate code strings that facilitate matching pronunciations of input and 

desired output. They have used table-driven direct mapping techniques between the English 

alphabet and the Bangla alphabet, and a phonetic lexicon–enabled mapping. However they did 

not consider about transliterating foreign words. Most of the foreign words cannot be mapped 

using their mechanism. 

Rahman et. al. (2007) compared different phonetic input methods for Bengali. Following Akkhor, 

many other software started offering Bengali transliteration. But none of these works considered 

about transliterating foreign words using IPA based approach. 

Amitava Das et. Al. (2010) proposed a comprehensive transliteration method for Indic languages 

including Bengali. They also reported IPA based approach improved the performance for Bengali 

language. 

3 Transliteration Architecture 

In this paper, we propose a transliteration input method for Bangla language with 
special handling of foreign words. For transliterating we considered only English 
foreign words and simple rule-base mechanism. For foreign words, we used 
International-Phonetic-Alphabet (IPA) based transliteration.

Figure 1 shows the Bengali transliteration process in a flow chart. Proposed system 
first tries to find if the word exists in English IPA dictionary to detect foreign 
words. For these foreign words, it uses IPA based transliteration. If the word is not 
available in the English dictionary, it uses Akkhor transliteration mechanism.   
As Bengali language accepts many English foreign words, transliterating the 
English word into Bengali alphabet makes that a Bengali foreign word. In our 
assumption, when writing Bengali message people write English foreign words 
using English spelling. To identify such input words, the system first checks for a 
word for foreign (English) origin by looking up at the English IPA dictionary. If the 
word is not available in the English IPA dictionary, the system uses the 
transliteration mechanism as proposed with Akkhor Bangla Software and a Bengali 
lexicon database to transliterate Bengali words.  

4 IPA Based Transliteration 

From English IPA dictionary the system can obtain the English words pronunciations in IPA 

format. Output for this step is the Bengali word transliterated from the IPA of the English word. 

In this step, we use following English-Bengali Transliteration map to transliterate the IPA into 

Bengali alphabet.

Table 3. English-Bengali IPA chart for consonants 

Table 1, 2 and 3 shows our proposed English-Bengali IPA chart for vowels, diphthongs and 

consonants. Using rule-base we transliterate the English IPA into Bangla alphabets. The 
above IPA charts leaves out many IPA as we are considering about translating from 
English only. To translate from other language such as Japanese to Banglawe need to 
create Japanese specific IPA transliteration chart. Using the above English-Bangla IPA 
chart we produced transliteration from the English IPA dictionary. For examples: 
pan(pæn): পযান; ban(bæn): বযান; might(maIt): মাইট .

Akkhor Bangla Software first implemented Bangla phonetic input method for computers. As a 

result this phonetic mapping become very popular among Bangladeshi computer users. However 

initially Akkhor did not consider about using Bangla Lexicon database. In this research we used 

Akkhor phonetic mapping with Bangla Lexicon database. Table 4 shows the phonetic mapping 

for Bengali alphabets. 

Because of the ambiguities in mapping 50 Bengali letters using 26 English letters, any fixed 

Bengali Phonetic mapping is debatable. As a result different people have different assumptions 

on phonetic input system for Bengali language using English letters. To overcome this problem 

we used Bengali Lexicon which includes the IPA for each Bengali words. The system produces 

the Bengali transliteration by ranking the words using IPA string edit distance. 

5.1 IPA String Edit Distance  

IPA string edit distance assign a score to a sequence of acoustic observations X for a 

hypothesized string of phones P, but rely on different distributions for P (Droppo et. al. 2010). 

From these IPA string edit distance scores, we choose the highest scored transliteration and show 

the word candidates in descending order. 

6 Experiment 

Based on the above method we implemented the phonetic Bengali input method for computer and 

mobile devices. We evaluated the produced transliteration for our test-set including 200 words. 

This test-set mainly covered the foreign words from different domains. We have taken these 

words by averaging across multiple users’ behaviour.  

Table 5 shows our evaluation result, where we compared our proposed phonetic input method 

with the Akkhor Baseline. We manually checked the produced transliteration quality and 

assigned each test-set entry as wrong (W), correct (C) or neutral (N). Neutral refers to such words 

which can be correct in different context and it depends on the user intention. For example, ban 

can refer to both Bengali word বান and বযান. Therefore, we assign such ambiguous words as 
neutral or N. In our experiment, our proposed approach improved the quality of Bangla 

transliteration input method by 14 points. The proposed phonetic input method could correclt 

transliterate 68% of the test-set words.

Table 5. Comparison between Akkhor transliteration and proposed phonetic input method 

For example, Table 6 shows 3 sample transliterations produced by Akkhor Baseline and our 

proposed Phonetic Input Method. As we can see for first two examples Akkhor produced wrong 

(W) transliteration and our proposed phonetic input method produced correct (C) transliteration.

In third case, both are marked as neutral (N), because both words is correct in different context 

and it depends on the user intention.

7 Conclusion 

We proposed a phonetic Bengali input method which is useful for computer and mobile devices 

by transliteration mechanism. Our proposed solution is effective especially for mobile devices 

due to low computational resources. For English foreign words, the system used International-

Phonetic-Alphabet(IPA)-based transliteration method for Bangla language. Our proposed 

approach improved the quality of Bangla transliteration input method by 14 points. In future, this 

method can be expanded to consider about handling foreign words in other Indian languages.
