Summary

To an ever-increasing extent, web-based services are providing a frontline for healthcare in-

formation in Europe. They help citizens find answers to their questions and help them under-
stand and find the local services they need. However, due to the number of languages spoken

in Europe, and the mobility of its population, there is a high demand for these services to be
available in many languages. In order to satisfy this demand, we need to rely on automatic

translation, as it is infeasible to manually translate into all languages requested. The aim of
HimL is to use recent advances in machine translation to create and deploy a system for the

automatic translation of public health information, with a special focus on meaning preserva-
tion. In particular, we will include recent work on domain adaptation, translation into morpho-

logically rich languages, terminology management, and semantically enhanced machine trans-
lation to build reliable machine translation for the health domain. The aim will be to create us -

able, reliable, fully automatic translation of public health information, initially testing with
translation from English into Czech, Polish, Romanian and German. In the HimL project we

will iterate cycles of incorporating improvements into the MT systems, with careful evaluation
and user acceptance testing.
