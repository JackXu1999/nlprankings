Abstract 
 
This paper considers gapping data through the 
lens of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) 
as developed in Steedman (1990, 2000). It 
analyzes CCG’s predictive power in managing 
a wide variety of cross-clausal gapping data. 
CCG predicts the typing of the rightmost 
subject in cross-clausal gapping data as an 
object; evidence from Case supports this 
hypothesis. Reflexive binding in cross-clausal 
structures favors the Szabolcsi (1989) binding 
proposal, in which binding occurs at the level 
of the surface structure. Additionally, facts from 
Chinese buttress the CCG analysis, as its NP 
category-assignment offers a natural explanation 
for the ungrammaticality of gapping sentences 
containing non-quantified NP objects: they are 
unable to undergo type-shifting. 

1 Setting the stage 

Ross (1967) gave the name gapping to the 
following phenomenon: 

 (1) Harry eats beans, and Fred, potatoes. 
Since Ross (1967), gapping has received varied 
accounts; I will center the present discussion on 
the theoretical problems posed by attempting to 
describe the data in the context of combinatory 
categorial grammar (CCG) as developed in 
Steedman (1990, 2000). 

 The paper will proceed as follows. First, I 
review the basic facts for which any theory of 
gapping must provide an account. Next, I 
describe the basic mechanics of gapping in CCG. 
I continue on to discuss data that proves 
problematic for the CCG account of gapping; I 
focus on the means by which CCG is able to 
predict many of the initially problematic data, 
thereby lending support for an intermediate 
theory of gapping – one that combines a 
syntactic and a semantic account. Further 
support for the CCG analysis comes in the form 
of apparent instances of gapping in Chinese, as 
CCG offers a principled account of the 
alternations between sentences containing 
quantified and non-quantified NP objects. 

2 Gapping: preliminary facts 

To begin, let us define gapping as a construction 
involving (at least) two similar clauses that 
surface in a contrastive relationship. In (1), we 
see a contrast between the left conjunct Harry 
eats beans and the right one, Fred, potatoes. 
The two conjuncts are joined through 
coordination; many theories take coordination 
to be a foundational property of gapping, but the 
story is not so simple. English gapping, for 
example, also occurs in comparatives: 

(2) Harry eats more beans than Fred,    
   potatoes. 

It is clear from (2) that gapping is not limited to 
syntactic coordination. Even gapping sentences 
with coordination need not be marked through 
the presence of an overt coordinator: 

(3) Some ate natto; others, rice. 
Cases like (2-3) show that attempts to consider 
gapping as a uniquely syntactic phenomenon 
involving the overtly marked coordination of 
constituents will inevitably fall flat.  

Gapping generally involves only one gap, and 
the item that is “gapped” is at least the main 
verb, if not additional material: 

(4) Harry eats beans, and Fred (eats) potatoes. 
The content of the additional material may 
vary; in many cases, it is part of the verb phrase: 

(5) John bought a book at the store, and Bill,  
   online. 

The above example shows that not only is the 
main verb bought gapped, but the object a book 
is gapped, as well. In most cases, there may be 
only one gap – sentences containing multiple 
gaps are often ungrammatical: 

(6) *I gave Mary a flower yesterday, and you,  
   Bill, today. 

In the above example, there are two gaps: first, 
the main verb gave is deleted, followed by a 
second, discontinuous gap in which the object a 
flower is deleted. As shown in (5), it is possible 
for both a verb and an object to be deleted (or 
“gapped”), so the problem is not the fact that

both items are deleted, but that they are deleted 
discontinuously. One gap is composed of the 
main verb gave, and the other, discontinuous gap 
contains the NP a flower. The dative NP Bill 
intervenes between the two gaps, which results in 
ungrammaticality. Yet if the dative object 
surfaces in a prepositional phrase in a right 
peripheral position in the clause, the sentence is 
grammatical, and its meaning is preserved: 

(7) I gave a book to Mary yesterday, and  
you, to Bill, three weeks ago. 

The contrast between (6) and (7) points to a 
preference for placing focused material at 
peripheral positions within the clause. Thus, 
discontinuous gaps are not generally permitted 
either because they delete focused elements or 
they fail to delete non-focused material. 

The disparity in grammaticality of (6-7) hints 
at another general property of gapping: the 
items in the gapped conjunct must be tied to 
some material that is sufficiently salient in the 
discourse to deliver an apparent contrast 
between the two (or more) conjuncts. This 
property is represented below (with (1) reprinted 
as (8a)): 

(8) a. Harry eats beans, and Fred, potatoes. 
      b.  A eats B, and C, D. 

Schematically, we see the contrastive 
relationship set up between the pairs A,B and 
C,D, in which the one element of each pair is 
contrasted with the corresponding element of 
the other; that is, A contrasts with C, and B with 
D. This relationship must be made clear within 
the discourse, and sentences uttered in contexts 
in which such a contrast is absent will be 
ungrammatical. 

These facts are ones that any theory of 
gapping must be able to explain. What follows is 
a discussion of CCG’s ability to account for this 
data and for other, similar gapping phenomena.  

3 Gapping in CCG 

Gapping viewed through the lens of CCG offers 
an intermediate stage between strongly syntactic 
and strongly semantic accounts of gapping. The 
syntactic categories assigned to each lexical item 
reflect the notion of the gap, and a semantic 
focus constraint serves to limit gapping to 
sufficiently salient discourse contexts.  

In CCG, there is no underlying syntactic 
structure, or in fact any deleted structure at all. 
CCG carries a comparatively free notion of 
constituency, which allows for surface-level 

combination between string-adjacent elements 
into increasingly large, concatenated 
constituents. In some sense, CCG’s idea of 
constituency, which allows even (traditionally 
“discontinuous”) elements like Fred, potatoes to 
be considered constituents, resembles Ross’s 
(1970) proposal that gapping and VP-ellipsis 
target and then elide “context variables” that 
range over strings regardless of constituency. In 
CCG, the decomposition of elements in the left 
conjunct allows us to pick out the verb and 
identify a non-continuous string in the left 
conjunct, which may then combine with a non-
continuous string in the right conjunct to derive 
a licit sentence. The intuition that gapping 
targets strings of lexical items that in many 
cases are either discontinuous or non-standard 
constituents is one easily captured by CCG; its 
lexical category assignment, combined with its 
finite set of combinatory rules, permits the 
derivation of non-standard constituents without 
appealing to other levels of structure. Thus, 
even though Ross’s (1970) proposal deals with 
strings that are deleted – and CCG lacks any 
notion of underlying structure – the shared 
intuition is one of non-standard constituency, 
which may be targeted in instances of VP-ellipsis 
and (important for present purposes) gapping. 

Steedman’s (1990, 2000) CCG account of 
gapping relies on a notion of constituency that 
is fundamentally different from that of abstract 
approaches. In CCG, a constituent refers to any 
entity within the grammar that fulfills two 
criteria: it must be interpretable, and 
grammatical rules must be allowed to operate on 
it (see Steedman 1990 for further discussion). 
CCG assigns a category to each lexical item; a 
combinatory rule operates on a pair of string-
adjacent lexical items. The derivability of a 
sentence is determined by the categories of the 
lexical items and their (in)ability to combine 
according to CCG’s finite set of combinatory 
rules. One basic rule is function application: 

(9) Function Application (> or <) 
         a.   X/Y    Y     →   X 
          b.    Y    X\Y   →   X 

X and Y may be thought of as variables 
corresponding to categories; directionality of the 
function is indicated by the direction of the slash 
(a forward-slash is right-looking, and a backward-
slash is left-looking). Function application 
allows string-adjacent lexical items of the 
appropriate type to combine. Other rules are 
necessary for the derivation of sentences

containing non-traditional constituents (e.g. 
cooked and might eat). Function composition 
allows such combination: 

(10) Forward Composition (>B) 
      a.   X/Y   Y/Z →B  X/Z 

Without forward composition, the sentence I 

cooked, and might eat, the beans would be 

underivable as a complete sentence: 

(11) a. I             cooked,       and     might          eat,          the beans 
       NP           (S\NP)/NP  conj  (S\NP)/VP    VP/NP           NP 

                                                      --------------------> 

                         VP 

      -------------------------->        --------------------------> 

            S\NP                  S\NP 

               --------------------->&  

           [S\NP]& 
           --------------------------------> 

          S\NP 

 

   b.  I        cooked,        and      might          eat,          the beans 

       NP          (S\NP)/NP        conj  (S\NP)/VP     VP/NP           NP 

                                       ---------------------------->B 
                     (S\NP)/NP 

                           ----------------------------->& 
                         [(S\NP)/NP]& 
                  --------------------------------------------<& 
                     (S\NP)/NP 

                     -------------------------------------------------------------> 

                   S\NP 

        --------------------------------------------< 

           S 

In (11b) above, the non-traditional constituent 
might eat may be derived through forward 
composition. Similarly, in CCG any item – word, 
phrase or non-canonical combination of words – 
may rightly be considered a constituent. Thus, as 
Steedman notes, a string like Mary might is as 
much a constituent as the predicate eat the cake 
would be in many abstract accounts. This relaxed 
notion of constituency is articulated in CCG’s 
rules, which allow the concatenation of words 
into such “non-standard” constituents – 
including, crucially, the subject/object pairs found 
in the derivation of gapping sentences (whose 
analysis is outlined below). Because the second 
conjunct in gapping sentences is a constituent, 
coordination may apply to it. Steedman’s 
formulation of CCG thus maintains the idea that 
gapping respects constituency, by loosening 
constituency’s requirements. 

Three additional rules – type-raising, forward 
mixing composition and decomposition – make 
possible the derivation of gapping sentences. I 
will offer a brief treatment of each, though the 
reader is directed to Steedman (1990, 2000) for 
a fuller discussion.  

Type-raising, along with forward mixing 
composition, is necessary in order to combine 
the subject/object remnants in the right conjunct 
of gapping sentences. Type-raising turns 
arguments of functions into functions-over-

such-functions-over-arguments (e.g. one 
normally thinks of nouns as arguments of verbs; 
in CCG, a type-raised noun becomes a function 
taking a verb as its argument). A general type-
raising schema is shown below: 

(12) Type-Raising: 
A →T  B/(B\A) or B\(B/A) 

When applied to subject NPs, type-raising is 
instantiated as follows: 

 (13) Subject Type-Raising (>T) 
         NP →T  S/(S\NP) 

As NP objects of a transitive verb, the type-
raised category for English objects is that of a 
function taking a transitive verb as its input and 
returning a one-argument verb: 

 (14) Object Type-Raising (<T) 
  NP →T  (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP) 

Type-raising, like other rules in CCG, allows for 
greater combinatory possibilities and is necessary 
for the derivation of gapping sentences (among 
other phenomena). Taking our simple gapping 
sentence, type-raising gives us the following: 

(15) …Fred,                potatoes. 
            NP                       NP 
          --------->T   -----------------------<T 
         S/(S\NP)        (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP) 
       ----------------------------------------------* 

After undergoing type-raising, Fred receives the 
designation S/(S\NP) – namely, that of a lexical 
item looking to its right for a verb seeking a 
subject to its left. In effect, Fred becomes a 
function over a one-argument verb. Similarly, 
potatoes receives the typing of an object looking 
to its left for a two-argument verb seeking an 
object to its right. However, combination of the 
two items is still blocked without the rule of 
forward mixing composition, which is shown 
below: 

 (16) Forward Mixing Composition  (>Bx) 
         [X/Y]&   Y\Z →B  [X\Z]& 
         where Y = S\NP 

Given this rule, the subject and object in the 
right conjunct may now combine to form a 
category of the type S\((S\NP)/NP): 

(17)   Fred,            potatoes. 
  NP                       NP 

       --------->T   -----------------------<T 
       S/(S\NP)      (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP) 
       ------------------------------------>Bx 
                    S\((S\NP)/NP) 

(Note: Marking the subject NP Fred for 
conjunction, which would have occurred prior to

(17), is not represented in the derivation.

) 

Yet again, however, the derivation is blocked; 
with the category S on one side of the derivation 
– Harry eats beans – and the category 
S\((S\NP)/NP) on the other, there is no means 
by which the two conjuncts may combine 
(assuming the right conjunct is marked for 
coordination). In order to allow such 
combination, and in order to take into account 
semantic constraints on gapping, Steedman 
(1990) posits a rule of decomposition: 

(18) Decomposition (<decompose)  
        X  Y X\Y 

where X = S 
        and Y = given(X) 

Decomposition requires that the category of the 
decomposed element be S, and that the other be 
provided in the discourse. This semantic 
discourse-sensitivity helps to limit the Y 
category in (18) to one that is relevant to a 
particular context. Without the decomposition 
rule, gapping sentences would be otherwise 
underivable in CCG; with the rule, we may finally 
derive the entire gapping sentence: 

(19) Harry eats beans,                and     Fred,           potatoes. 
          ----------------------                  conj     NP                 NP 

       S                   --------->T  -----------------------<T 

    S/(S\NP)    (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP)  

   -------------------->& 

      [S/(S\NP)]& 

     ----------------------------------------------->Bx 

                                    [S\((S\NP)/NP)]& 

         =================<decompose 

         (S\NP)/NP S\((S\NP)/NP) 

                         -------------------------------------------------------------<& 

                   S\((S\NP)/NP) 

          ---------------------------------------------------------< 

           S 

When decomposition of the left conjunct 
occurs, the verb is separated out from the subject 
and object (or, as I will show, the embedded 
subject). The decomposition rule applied to the 
left conjunct of a canonical gapping sentence 
(e.g. Harry eats beans) splits that conjunct into 
two constituents (S\NP)/NP and S\((S\NP)/NP). 

                                                
1
 The rule shown in (17) requires that coordination apply only 

to the lexical item to its right – and not to the composed Fred, 

potatoes constituent – in order to prevent the derivation of 

ungrammatical forms like the following, as noted by Steedman 

(1990): 

i. *Eats   Fred,            potatoes.               

((S\NP)/NP)   NP                       NP            

--------->T   -----------------------<T 

         S/(S\NP)      (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP) 

         -------------------------------------->Bx 

                             S\((S\NP)/NP) 

 ---------------------------------------------< 

      S    

The second of these constituents can be 
conjoined with the right conjunct since it is of 
identical type to produce another constituent of 
the same type. Finally, the result of 
coordination serves as the argument to the first 
of the decomposed constituents. The CCG 
analysis of gapping thus reflects the intuition 
that the verb (i.e., the (S\NP)/NP derived using 
decomposition) takes scope over both conjuncts. 

4 Cross-clausal gapping 

I will now consider data that pose a potential 
problem for most existing theories of gapping. 
Most of the data involves instances of what I 
term cross-clausal gapping, in which a gap ranges 
across an embedded clause, targeting the matrix 
and embedded verbs and leaving the subjects of 
both clauses as remnants. The relation in such 
gaps is thus one of subject/subject, rather than 
the typical subject/object relationship found in 
canonical instances of gapping. Two typical 
examples are produced below: 

(20) a. John hopes the Bills win, and Fred,  
   the Colts. 
b. Robin knows a lot of reasons why dogs  

are good pets, and Leslie, cats. (C&J 
2005:273) 

We see, in both cases, that the sentence-final 
remnant is a subject – the Colts in (20a), and cats 
in (20b) – rather than an object, which causes 
the CCG derivation to break down. If the phrases 
in the second conjunct receive the typing of a 
traditional subject, namely, NP or, when type-
raised, S/(S\NP), we are left with no means of 
saving the derivation. If we type both subjects in 
the right conjunct with nominative Case (i.e. 
with the typical type-raised subject category), 
then the derivation fails as shown in (21): 

(21) John hopes the Bills win,   and         Fred,             the Colts. 
      ------------------------------           conj         NP                   NP 

     S                     --------->T        -------------<T 

                          S/(S\NP)         S/(S\NP) 

                        -------------------->& 

                           [S/(S\NP)]& 

                 --------------------------------------------* 
The pair of string-adjacent subjects in the right 
conjunct cannot combine: even though the 
subjects have identical typing, and the subject 
Fred is marked for coordination, Steedman’s 
coordination rule cannot save the derivation. As 
the forward coordination rule has already applied 
to mark Fred for coordination, the left-looking 
backward coordination rule must then apply; if 
both subjects in the right conjunct are typed with 
nominative Case, the derivation fails.

However, CCG’s machinery is fully capable of 
describing the data if we allow one crucial 
assumption: that the cross-clausal, sentence-final 
constituent in the second conjunct is typed as an 
object – just as CCG would predict for the 
sentence to be derived successfully.  

Though this assumption may initially seem 
somewhat ad hoc, evidence from Case lends 
support for this view. In English gapping 
sentences, there is a tendency to favor 
accusative pronominals in the second conjunct. 
Take the following data: 

(22) a. John thinks (that) Mary will win, and  
    Fredi, himj/*hej/me/*I.

2
 

        b. I hope (that) Mary wins, and you,  
    him/me. 

        c. John delivered a speech on why the  
   Giants will win, and Fred, the Bills. 

In (22a-b), the rightmost element in the right 
conjunct may only surface as a pronoun marked 
for accusative Case – the Case of a traditional 
object in English. To account for the possibility 
of subject extraction when that is not present in 
such examples, Steedman suggests that subjects 
can in some cases be analyzed as objects of the 
higher predicate. One might be tempted, 
therefore, to treat (22a) in this fashion, with the 
embedded subject in the left conjunct Mary 
analyzed as an object of thinks. There is reason 
to doubt this, however: In example (22c) the 
embedded subject cannot, in fact, be plausibly 
analyzed as the object of the higher verb. I 
follow Steedman in assuming that type raising is 
a reflection of case marking. When one type-
raises a subject, for example, the resulting 
category is an S/(S\NP), which effectively shifts 
the subject from being the argument of a verb 
phrase to instead being a function over a 
function over the argument of a verb phrase – 
that is, the subject becomes a function that takes 
a left-looking verb phrase as its own argument.  

I posit that the typing of the sentence-final 
subject as an object points to a requirement that 
it bear accusative Case. The grammar permits 
the combination of a type-raised subject and 
object in CCG; we see quite clearly via empirical 
gapping data that such an allowance is necessary, 
both in English and in e.g. German (see 
Steedman 2000 for further discussion). A sample 
derivation, parallel to those of canonical English 
gapping sentences, is shown below:

 Where him refers to another discourse-given individual. 

Example (22b) makes this relationship more apparent.

S 

The syntactic apparatus of CCG predicts that 
the rightmost element in an instance of cross-
clausal subject/subject gapping must be typed as 
an object for the derivation to proceed. Thus, it 
should not be surprising for us to find the 
rightmost NP to surface with accusative Case – a 
surface representation of the fact that the 
rightmost element should receive object typing.   

The account seems more plausible when one 
considers other, clearly ungrammatical cross-
clausal gapping constructions. Oftentimes, the 
accusative-Case pronoun is required:  

(24) a. John hopes (that) you win, and Fred,  
   me/*I/him/her/*he/*she. 

      b. John delivered a speech on why Fred  
resigned, and Bill, 
me/I*/him/her/*he/she*. 

In each of the examples above, the sentence-
final remnant – interpreted in (24a) as the 
subject of the string ____ win(s), and in (24b) as 
the subject of ____ resigned – may only appear 
in accusative Case.  

One might argue that the appearance of 
accusative Case is simply due to the general 
unlikelihood of finding sentence-final subjects in 
English. Much past research (e.g. Schutze 2001) 
has commented on the status of accusative Case 
as default Case in English, and some would 
thereby conclude that this fact renders the 
analysis moot – that is, that the final subject 
defaults to accusative Case in the absence of an 
overt nominative Case assigner.

3
 However, I 

contend that even if the default Case of English 
is accusative, or even if English favors 
accusative Case for sentence-final NPs, the 
analysis still follows: the tendency of English to

 An additional object of study would be the presence (or lack 

therof) of cross-clausal gapping in languages that necessarily 

mark nominative Case overtly, particularly in languages in 

which default Case is not accusative; if the analysis for 

English translates crosslinguistically, one would expect that 

the sentence-final subjects surface in accusative Case, both in 

instances of pronominals and in non-pronominal NPs.

5 Binding in cross-clausal gapping 

Cross-clausal gapping sentences show an 
interesting property with respect to reflexive 
binding. Typically, a matrix subject cannot bind 
an embedded reflexive. However, cross-clausal 
gapping sentences like (25a-b) demonstrate the 
necessity of long-distance reflexive binding:  

(25) a. *Johni thinks that Mary is in love with  
himselfi. 

b. Johni thinks that Maryj is in love with  
Fredk, and Billl, with  
himself??i/??k/l//herself?j/him*l/her*j.   

As shown in (25a), in normal (non-gapping) 
circumstances, the matrix subject cannot bind 
the embedded reflexive. The most salient reading 
of sentence (25b) is the one in which Bill thinks 
that Mary loves him.

4
 Under this cross-clausal 

reading, only the reflexive himself, referring to 
Bill, is completely acceptable. The use of her to 
refer to Mary is also ungrammatical. In the 
surface structure, there are no clause boundaries 
separating Mary from her – it is a Condition B 
violation. With CCG, there is no underlying 
syntactic structure or representation. The CCG 
notion of surface structure is essentially, ‘what 
you see is what you get,’ and the syntax builds up 
canonically non-standard constituents alongside 
a corresponding semantic interpretation. Even if 
the surface structure does not reflect the 
iteration of Mary that one would expect to be 
present underlyingly in an abstract account (i.e. 
in the second conjunct, as part of the deleted 
material), the presence of Mary in the first 
conjunct, together with the lack of a surface-
level clause boundary, causes the non-reflexive 
her to be ungrammatical.  

Thus, not only is long-distance reflexive 
binding available, it is in fact a necessity, as the 
unavailability of co-reference between Bill and 
him in (25b) indicates. Additional data provide 
further support for this picture: 

(26) a. Fred thinks (that) Mary will win, and  
   John, himselfi/??himi/*hei.    

        b. Fred believes (that) Mary loves John,  
    and Billi, himselfi/*himi. 

                                                
4
 Example (25b) requires some prosodic contrast (in which 

John and Fred receive emphasis, then Bill and himself) to 

make the cross-clausal reading completely clear, but the same 

is true for most gapping sentences. 

       c. Mary said (that) the stone had fallen  
    on Sue, and Billi, on himselfi/*himi. 

Examples (26a-c) provide a different sort of 
evidence. As discussed previously, the rightmost 
element receives accusative case. We see that if 
this element is interpreted as coreferential with 
the leftmost element in the gapped constituent, 
the former must be a reflexive and not a 
pronoun. This is in contrast to what one would 
expect if the gapped material were 
reconstructed. Taking (26c) as an example, if 
binding occurs at the semantics, then some level 
of reconstruction of the gapped clause should be 
possible – and the reflexive should be 
dispreferred, because of the presence of a clause 
boundary intervening between Fred and 
him/himself. Yet, because the reflexive reading is 
not only available, but is in fact required, we 
receive evidence that the binding occurs at the 
level of the surface syntax, where Fred and 
him/himself are string-adjacent and fall within 
the same binding domain. 

In practice, how might one represent binding 
in the syntax? Steedman (1996) treats binding at 
the level of predicate-argument structure. He 
assumes that bound anaphors receive a treatment 
that is syntactically identical to other NPs; the 
only difference is that they are marked with a 
+ANA feature. At the level of interpretation, 
which is built up simultaneously with the 
syntactic structure, reflexives are interpreted as 
a function of the type self' – the representation 
of himself is shown below: 

(27) himself := NP+ANA,3SM : self' 
The Steedman approach is similar to the account 
of reflexives provided by Reinhart and Reuland 
(1993), in which the reflexive-marking is 
reflected on the verb. Given the above definition 
of the -self anaphor, the reflexivization of a 
transitive verb is thus represented with the 
following rule (from Steedman 1996): 

(28) (S\NPagr)/NP : f → (S\NPagr)/NP+ANA,agr : λg.λy.g f (ana'y)y 

In such a rule, the resulting predicate-argument 
structure is the function gf(ana'y)y, in which the 
variable g takes as its range the anaphoric 
interpretation of self'. It should be fairly plain to 
see how syntactic combination of verb and 
anaphor occurs derivationally – it proceeds as 
expected. In the interpretation structure, the 
semantic construction builds up parallel to its 
syntactic counterpart. This process restricts 
anaphoric binding to local domains, but it 

disallows the application of the λ-calculus to an 

already-composed constituent.

Normally, this would not pose a problem – 
except in cases like those shown above, in which 
the cross-clausal gapping sentences demonstrate 
long-distance reflexive binding. Examples like 
(26a) require that binding occur at the level of 
the surface structure, which the Steedman 
account does not allow. Steedman’s rule (28) 
could account for the cross-clausal cases, if it 
were able to apply following application of the 
decomposition rule (18) in the left conjunct; 
however, the rule (28) is strictly a lexical one 
and thus cannot apply following decomposition. 
Counterproposals exist that feature a different 
sort of reflexive binding – namely, one in which 
the reflexive is itself marked (rather than the 

verb) as a λ-operator that turns a two-argument 

function into a one-argument function, in effect 
reversing the normal function/argument 
structure. In such proposals, e.g. Szabolcsi 
(1989), the reflexive W is essentially a type-
raised NP that causes an identity relation 
between arguments of a verb; this process is 
shown below (adapted from Szabolcsi 1989): 

(29) W =λf.λx.fxx 

(30) Assuming a transitive verb with  

interpretation λy.λz.f (yz), 

  λf.λx.[fxx](λy.λz.g [yz]) = λx[gxx] 

This account differs crucially from the Steedman 
one in that it is the reflexive itself, and not the 
verb, on which reflexivization is marked. When 
building up cross-clausal gapping structures that 
contain long-distance reflexive binding, the 
Szabolcsi proposal would allow us to derive the 
proper binding facts for cross-clausal gapping 

structures; the result of combining the λ-terms 

for John, himself is a function that if given a 
transitive verb, will return a verb applied to both 
John and himself – precisely the intuitive 
reading of (26a).  

Unfortunately, the Szabolcsi proposal runs 
into problems of its own. Given that it allows for 
long-distance reflexive binding, the Szabolcsi 
account overgenerates and permits the 
derivation of ungrammatical English sentences. 
If we type reflexives in the same way as other 
NPs in the syntax, then the proposal derives 
ungrammatical forms like the following: 

(31) *Johni thinks that Mary likes himselfi. 
The Szabolcsi proposal allows reflexive binding 

to apply the λ-calculus to composed 

constituents; without restrictions on the 
application of binding to composed constituents, 
examples like (31) are predicted to be 

grammatical. Thus, although a proposal like the 
Szabolcsi one is necessary to account for the 
facts of cross-clausal gapping, it predicts that 
other long-distance binding will be grammatical, 
as well. As such, although the Szabolcsi theory is 
better able to capture the cross-clausal facts than 
the Steedman one, it fails to earn an unqualified 
endorsement as a preferred proposal overall. 

6 Chinese type-raising 

The previous discussion has centered almost 
exclusively on gapping in English. In the 
following section, the discussion shifts to a range 
of data in Chinese that can bring something to 
bear on the present analysis of gapping.  

Wu (2002) adduces a class of gapping-like 
constructions in Chinese that display interesting 
behavior. Specifically, Wu shows that instances 
of gapping in Chinese are restricted to NP 
objects that carry some form of quantificational 
force, generally as part of a classifier phrase (a 
phenomenon also discussed in Li 1988 and Paul 
1999). The alternation in grammaticality 
between quantified NP objects and bare nouns is 
shown below: 

(32)a. Zhangsan chi-le san-ge pingguo, Lisi chi-le si-ge   juzi.  
           Zhangsan  ate  three-CL  apple     Lisi ate  four-CL orange  

        ‘Zhangsan ate three apples and Lisi four oranges.’   

(Li 1988:41) 
         b. Zhangsan xihuan pingguo, Lisi *(xihuan) juzi.  

         Zhangsan like      apple      Lisi    like        orange  
           ‘Zhangsan likes apples and Lisi oranges.’ (Wu 2002:3) 

I take this restriction to demonstrate that type-
raising in Chinese is restricted to a specific set of 
words and phrases, i.e. those carrying 
quantificational force. Throughout the 
development of CCG, type-raising has been 
accepted to occur relatively freely; however, I 
contend that the alternations in grammaticality 
in Chinese, and the impermissibility of gapping 
in sentences where the object lacks 
quantificational force, support the conclusion 
that type-raising in Chinese is in fact restricted. 
Given such a restriction, the facts of gapping in 
Chinese fall out naturally. Looking to (32a), we 
see that the object juzi “orange” is preceded by 
si-ge “four,” also marked as a classifier phrase. 
The alternation in grammaticality between 
(32a), with a quantified object, and (32b), which 
contains the bare NP object juzi, is striking, and 
it provides a minimal pair for the analysis. 
Simply, when the object is not preceded by a 
quantificational element – in this case, a 
classifier phrase – gapping is unavailable.

 Representing this fact in CCG is simple. 
Lexical items are assigned specific categories, 
and the derivation of gapping sentences requires 
a highly specific category assignment that allows 
for the combination of subject and object in the 
right conjunct via forward crossing composition. 
In order for the subject and object to combine, 
each item must be type-shifted from an 
argument to a function-over-functions-over-
arguments. A parametric constraint on the type-
shifting of bare NP objects means that in 
examples like (32b), the subject and object 
cannot combine, and the derivation crashes. 
This derivational crash is shown below

5
: 

(33) *Zhangsan xihuan pingguo,         Lisi          juzi. 
              Zhangsan   like       apple              Lisi          orange 
          --------------------------------- (conj) NP            NP 

            S                                     --------->T  --------* 
     S/(S\NP)  

The method for deriving the licit Chinese 
example (32a) should by now be equally 
apparent (shown on the next page): 

(34) Zhangsan chi-le san-ge     pingguo, Lisi    chi-le  si-ge        juzi.  
          Zhangsan ate     three-CL apple        Lisi     ate     four-CL  orange 

          -----------------------------------------  (conj)   NP                           NP 

      S          --------->T    -----------------------<T 

              S/(S\NP)     (S\NP)\((S\NP)/NP) 

              ------------------>& 

     [S/(S\NP)]& 

     ----------------------------------------------->Bx 

      =================<decompose    [S\((S\NP)/NP)]& 

         (S\NP)/NP   S\((S\NP)/NP) 

     --------------------------------------------------------------<& 

S\((S\NP)/NP) 

         ---------------------------------------------------------< 

      S 

Due to the presence of the classifier phrase, the 
NP object juzi may type-shift. It combines with 
the subject Lisi to produce a subject-object 
constituent, which subsequently combines with 
the result of the decomposition in the left 
conjunct. The decomposition separates out the 
verb from the subject-object constituent, which 
is then coordinated with the analogous subject-
object constituent in the right conjunct. Finally, 
the coordinated subject-object constituent 
combines with the transitive verb through 
function application, and the result is a well-
formed sentence. Gapping in Chinese thus 
depends on the expression of the NP object and 
its (in)ability to type-shift. 

The notion of crosslinguistic variation in the 
range of NP interpretations is not a new one; 

                                                
5
 I assume the presence of coordination on some (perhaps 

syntactic) level; similar examples, in which a coordinator fails 

to surface overtly, are also found in English (see example (3)). 

Such examples have long been noted (see Sag 1976), and I see 

them as posing no real threat to the CCG analysis of gapping. 

Chierchia (1998) established a system for 
defining languages in terms of the availability of 
mass and count nouns, and the expression of 
each. Chierchia described two features – 
±argument and ±predicate – to define the 
expression of nouns. In some instances, all 
nouns are arguments (meaning that bare nouns 
occur freely, as in Chinese); in others, all nouns 
are predicates (bare nouns are practically, if not 
totally, excluded, as in French); finally, in still 
other instances nouns may be either predicates 
or arguments. This final category (which 
includes English) allows for greater freedom in 
type-shifting of phrasal projections. Chierchia 
applies this expression of type-shifting 
specifically to mass/count noun distinctions, but 
the same principle informs our conception of 
type-shifting in CCG – some languages, like 
English, do allow type-shifting to occur freely. 
In others, e.g. Chinese, type-shifting is 
restricted; simply, bare NPs cannot type-shift. 

Chinese allows type-raising only in case there 
is some quantificational force inherent in the 
DP; with this single observation, we see that the 
facts of gapping in Chinese, and the 
environments in which it is permissible, follow 
as a natural consequence of the CCG theory.  

7 Conclusion 

In this paper, I have outlined a number of facts 
that any theory of gapping must analyze. The 
CCG proposal of Steedman (1990, 2000), carries 
a high degree of predictive power in managing 
the wide variety of cross-clausal gapping data 
contained herein. CCG predicts the typing of the 
rightmost subject in cross-clausal gapping data as 
an object; evidence from Case supports this 
hypothesis. Reflexive binding in cross-clausal 
structures favors the Szabolcsi (1989) proposal, 
in which binding occurs at the level of the 
surface structure. Additionally, facts from 
Chinese buttress the CCG analysis, as its NP 
category-assignment delivers a straightforward 
explanation for the ungrammaticality of gapping 
sentences containing non-quantified NP objects: 
simply, they are unable to undergo type-shifting.
