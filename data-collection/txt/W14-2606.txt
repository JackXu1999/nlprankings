Abstract of the talk 

Consumers increasingly inform their purchase de-

cisions with opinions and other information found 

on the Web. Unfortunately, the ease of posting 

content online, potentially anonymously, com-

bined with the public's trust and growing reliance 

on this content, creates opportunities and incen-

tives for abuse. This is especially worrisome in the 

case of online reviews of products and services, 

where businesses may feel pressure to post decep-

tive opinion spam---fictitious reviews disguised to 

look like authentic customer reviews. 

 

In recent years, several approaches have been pro-

posed to identify deceptive opinion spam based on 

linguistic cues in a review's text. In this talk I will 

summarize a few of these approaches. I will addi-

tionally discuss some of the challenges research-

ers face when studying this problem, including the 

difficulty of obtaining labeled data, uncertainties 

surrounding the prevalence of deception, and how 

linguistic cues to deceptive opinion spam vary 

with the text's sentiment (e.g., 5-star vs 1- and 2-

star reviews), domain (e.g., hotel vs. restaurant re-

views) and the domain expertise of the author 

(e.g., crowdsourced vs. employee-written decep-

tive opinion spam).
