Abstract

We empirically investigate learning from
partial feedback in neural machine transla-
tion (NMT), when partial feedback is col-
lected by asking users to highlight a cor-
rect chunk of a translation. We propose a
simple and effective way of utilizing such
feedback in NMT training. We demon-
strate how the common machine trans-
lation problem of domain mismatch be-
tween training and deployment can be re-
duced solely based on chunk-level user
feedback. We conduct a series of sim-
ulation experiments to test the effective-
ness of the proposed method. Our re-
sults show that chunk-level feedback out-
performs sentence based feedback by up to
2.61% BLEU absolute.

1 Introduction

In recent years, machine translation (MT) quality
improved rapidly, especially because of advances
in neural machine translation (NMT). Most of re-
maining MT errors arguably come from domain,
style, or terminology mismatch between the data
on which the MT was trained on and data which
it has to translate. It is hard to alleviate this mis-
match since usually only limited amounts of rele-
vant training data are available. Yet MT systems
deployed on-line in e.g. e-commerce websites or
social networks can benefit from user feedback for
overcoming this mismatch. Whereas MT users are
usually not bilingual, they likely have a good com-
mand of the target language and are able to spot
severe MT errors in a given translated sentence,
sometimes with the help of e.g. an accompanying
image, video, or simply prior knowledge.

A common approach to get user feedback for
MT is explicit ratings of translations on an n-point

Likert scale. The main problem of such methods
is that users are not qualified enough to provide re-
liable feedback for the whole sentence. Since dif-
ferent users do not adhere to a single set of guide-
lines, their ratings may be influenced by various
factors, such as user expectations, user knowledge,
or user satisfaction with the platform. In (Kreutzer
et al., 2018), the authors investigate the reliability
and validity of real user ratings by re-evaluating
five-star ratings by three independent human anno-
tators, however the inter-annotator agreement be-
tween experts was relatively low and no correla-
tion to the averaged user rating was found.

Instead of providing a rating, a user might be
asked to correct the generated translation, in a
process called post-editing. Using corrected sen-
tences for training an NMT system brings larger
improvements, but this method requires significant
effort and expertise from the user.

Alternatively, feedback can be collected by ask-
ing users to mark correct parts (chunks) of the
translation (Marie and Max, 2015). It can be seen
as the middle ground between quick sentence level
rating and more expensive post-editing. We hy-
pothesize that collecting feedback in this form im-
plicitly forces guidelines on the user, making it
less susceptible to various user-dependent factors.
We expect marking of correct chunks in a trans-
lation to be simple enough for non-experts to do
quickly and precisely and also be more intuitive
than providing a numerical rating.

In this paper, we investigate the empirical hy-
pothesis that NMT is able to learn from the good
chunks of a noisy sentence and describe a sim-
ple way of utilizing such chunk-level feedback in
NMT training. To the best of our knowledge, no
dataset with human feedback recorded in this form
is available, therefore we experiment with user
feedback that was artificially created from paral-
lel data.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
In Section 2 we review related work. We describe
our partial feedback approach in Section 3. Next
we present our experimental results in Section 4,
followed by the conclusion in Section 5.

2 Related work

Integrating user ratings in NMT has been stud-
ied in (Kreutzer et al., 2017), who view this as
a bandit structured prediction task. They demon-
strate how the user feedback can be integrated into
NMT training and perform a series of experiments
using GLEU (Wu et al., 2016) to simulate user
feedback. Nguyen et al. (2017) have also studied
this problem and adapted an actor-critic approach
(Mnih et al., 2016) which has shown to be robust
to skewed, high variance feedback from real users.

(Lam et al., 2018) extended the work of
(Nguyen et al., 2017) by asking users to provide
feedback for partial hypotheses to iteratively gen-
erate the translation, their goal is to minimize the
required human involvement. They performed
simulated experiments using chrF (Popovic, 2015)
as simulated feedback.

In all previous works feedback needs to be gen-
erated on-line during the training process, however
in this paper we focus on the case where there
might be a significant time lag between genera-
tion of translation and acquiring of the feedback.
Lawrence et al. (2017) have proposed a method to
leverage user feedback that is available only for
logged translated data for a phrase-based statisti-
cal machine translation system.

(Kreutzer et al., 2018) have experimented with
sentence level star ratings collected from real users
of an e-commerce site for logged translation data,
but found the feedback to be too noisy to gain im-
provements. They also proposed using implicit
word level task feedback based on query match-
ing in an e-commerce application to improve both
translation quality and task specific metrics.

Marie and Max (2015) have proposed an in-
teractive framework which iteratively improves
translation generated by the phrase-based system
by asking users to select correct parts. Domingo et
al. (2016) extended this idea to also include word
deletions and substitutions with the goal of reduc-
ing human effort in translation.

Grangier and Auli (2017) have studied the task
of paraphrasing an already generated translation
by excluding words that the user has marked as

incorrect. They modify NMT model to also ac-
cept the marked target sentence as input and train
it to produce similar sentences that do not contain
marked words.

(Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) have pro-
posed sentence level weighting method for domain
adaptation in NMT.

3 Method

In this work we use the encoder-decoder NMT ar-
chitecture with attention, proposed by (Bahdanau
et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014). NMT model
is trained to maximize the conditional likelihood
of a target sentence eI1 : e1, . . . , eI given a source
sentence fJ1 : f1, . . . , fJ from a parallel dataset
D:

L =
∑

fJ1 ,e
I
1∈D

I∑
i=1

log p(ei|ei−11 , f
J
1 ). (1)

Training objective (1) is appropriate when the tar-
get sentence eI1 comes from real data. However,
we would like to benefit from model-generated
sentences ẽI1 by introducing partial feedback.

We assume that partial feedback for a sentence
ẽI1 is given as a sequence of binary values w

I
1 :

w1, . . . , wI , such that wi = 1 if the word ẽi is
marked as correct, wi = 0 if it is unrated or incor-
rect. We propose a simple modification to the loss
in Equation (1):

LPF =
∑

fJ1 ,ẽ
I
1,w

I
1∈D

I∑
i=1

wi log p(ẽi|ẽi−11 , f
J
1 ) (2)

Considering the definition of the binary partial
feedback, the model would be trained to predict
correct target words, while ignoring unrated and
incorrect ones. However, incorrect words are still
used as inputs to the model and influence the pre-
diction context of correct words.

While partial feedback is gathered in a binary
form (selected/not selected), word weights wi can
take any real value, depending on the weight as-
signment scheme.

Our training objective can be seen as a general-
ization of sentence level weighting method (Chen
et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). The special case
of sentence level weight can be expressed as wi =
w,∀i , where w is the weight for sentence ẽI1.



328

We differentiate between two practical methods
of obtaining the partial feedback data. First, gath-
ering the feedback from humans, by presenting
them with translations and asking to highlight cor-
rect words. This method is expected to produce
high quality feedback, but is relatively expensive
and, to the best of our knowledge, no such dataset
is publicly available.

Another method is to generate partial feedback
automatically using heuristics or statistical mod-
els. This type of feedback would be cheap to ob-
tain, but is unlikely to be of high quality.

In this paper, to show the effectiveness of high
quality chunk feedback, we generate artificial
feedback by comparing model predictions to refer-
ence translations using heuristic methods. This ap-
proach is cheap, produces high quality feedback,
but is not practically useful, because it requires ac-
cess to reference human translation.

We have experimented with several methods of
extracting artificial feedback. A simple match-
ing method assigns wi = 1 if predicted word ẽi
is present in reference translation at any position,
and wi = 0 otherwise. A slightly more sophisti-
cated method is to find the longest common sub-
string (LCS) between the predicted and reference
translations and set the weights for words which
belong to the LCS to 1, and to 0 otherwise. In
our experiments we have found the latter method
to perform slightly better.

4 Experiments

In this section, we conduct a series of experiments
to study how well an NMT system is able to learn
only from partial user feedback when this feed-
back is given for in-domain translations, whereas
the baseline system is trained on out-of-domain
data.

4.1 Datasets

We report results on two datasets: WMT 2017
German to English news translation task (Bojar
et al., 2017) and an in-house English to Spanish
dataset in the e-commerce domain. On all data we
apply byte-pair encoding (Sennrich et al., 2016)
with 40,000 merge operations learned separately
for each language.

For each dataset we separate the larger out-
of-domain and smaller in-domain training data.
For De-En we use 1.8M sentence pairs randomly
sampled from available parallel corpora as out-

of-domain data and 800K sentence pairs sampled
from back-translated monolingual and unused par-
allel corpora as in-domain data. For En-Es we
have 2.7M out-of-domain and 1.5M in-domain
sentence pairs. We evaluate our models on new-
stest2016 (2999 sentence pairs) for the De-En task
and an in-house test set of 1000 sentence pairs for
the En-Es task using case-insensitive BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006).

We have implemented our NMT model using
TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) library. Our en-
coder is a bidirectional LSTM with a layer size of
512; our decoder is an LSTM with 2 layers of the
same size. We also use embedding size of 512 and
MLP attention layer. We train our networks using
SGD with a learning rate schedule that starts grad-
ually decaying to 0.01 after the initial 4 epochs. As
regularization we use dropout on the RNN inputs
with dropping probability of 0.2.

4.2 Results

We pre-train baseline NMT models on parallel
out-of-domain data for 15 epochs. We then use the
pre-trained model to generate translations from the
source side of parallel in-domain corpus. Using
heuristics described in Section 3 and the reference
target side of the in-domain corpus we generate ar-
tificial partial feedback to simulate real user input.
Then we continue training with a small learning
rate for another 10 epochs on in-domain data with
or without user feedback.

In Table 1, we show the effect of different types
of feedback on translation performance. First, we
see that even using no feedback slightly improves
the model due to self-training on automatically
translated in-domain data.

Introducing sentence level feedback improves
De-En and En-Es models by at most 0.2% and
0.6% absolute BLEU, respectively. Sentence level
feedback is artificially generated from parallel cor-
pora using heuristics, similar to the ones described
in Section 3, but wi,∀i are set to the same sen-
tence weight w. For example, we have tried using
sentence BLEU (sBLEU) and a binary rule, which
outputs 1 if more than 33% of predicted words
were marked as correct, and 0 otherwise (binary).
We have also experimented with other heuristics,
but did not achieve better results.

Finally, chunk-based feedback approach based
on LCS improves on top of sentence level feed-
back by another 0.7% and 2.6% BLEU for De-

lent to having no feedback or setting all wi = 1, ∀i

and sent-binary are sentence-level methods with

fined as in Section 4.2. chunk-match and chunk-
lcs-level feedback refers to assigning wi using
simple matching or LCS method described in Sec-
tion 3.

En and En-Es, respectively. We also note a sig-
nificant improvement of 1.3% and 3.1% in TER.
Chunk-based approach based on simple matching
also outperforms sentence level methods, but not
by as much as lcs-based, which suggests that this
method benefits more from consecutive segments,
rather than single correct words.

We believe that the success of the partial feed-
back approach can be explained by the fact that of-
ten a sentence can be split into chunks which can
be translated independently of the context. Re-
inforcement of the correct translation of such a
chunk in one training example seems to positively
affect translations of such chunks in other, differ-
ent sentences. By focusing on the good and mask-
ing out erroneous chunks, partial feedback acts as
a precise noise reduction method.

We have also trained the models using fine-
tuning (Luong and Manning, 2015) on the ref-
erence target in-domain data, which further im-
proved translation by 2% and 3.8% BLEU on
De-En and En-Es compared to using chunk-based
feedback. We note that by using partial feedback
we are able to recover between 30% and 45% of
improvements that come from in-domain adapta-
tion.

4.3 Robustness

back is very precise as it does not introduce any

back. In the last row, 10% of marked words are
actually incorrect and the total number of marked
words is 25% less compared to system in row 1.

type of noise in marking of good chunks. For
example, on the En-Es dataset artificial methods
mark 40% of all words as correct. However, a user
might not mark all the correct words in a sentence,
but select only a few.

Furthermore, artificially generated partial feed-
back does not contain noise, given that the refer-
ence translation is adequate. However, users may
make mistakes in selection. We differentiate two
types of errors that a user can make: under selec-
tion, when a correct word was not marked; and
incorrect selection, when an incorrect word was
marked as correct.

To anticipate the impact of these mistakes we
experiment with deliberately impairing the feed-
back in Table 2. We see that randomly dropping
25% of the selection has very little effect on the
model, while dropping 50% and more decreases
the translation performance significantly, yet still
performing at the same level or better than self-
training system.

When selection contains noise, the impact al-
ready becomes noticeable at 10%. Increasing the
amount of noise up to 25% decreases the perfor-



330

mance by 1.6% BLEU in En-Es task. At 50%
noise level, which is similar to random selection,
there is no improvement from using feedback at
all. While we expect users to provide mostly
clean feedback, this result indicates the necessity
of cleaning user feedback data, e.g. by aggregat-
ing feedback from multiple users.

We have also experimented with replacing uns-
elected words by random noise and saw only small
decrease in translation performance, which sug-
gests that our approach is able to benefit from very
poor translations, as long as the selected chunk is
correct.

4.4 Example

An example where the NMT system with chunk-
based feedback yields a better translation in com-
parison to other systems is the German sentence
“Die Krise ist vorüber.” (“The crisis is over.“).
The German word “vorüber” is rare and ambigu-
ous, especially after the BPE-based splitting. The
system with self-training translates the sentence as
“The crisis is above all.”, whereas the system with
chunk-based feedback exactly matches the refer-
ence translation. We have analyzed the feedback
training set: in that data, out of nine occurrences
of the word “vorüber” with the reference transla-
tion “over”, the baseline system got it right three
times, getting rewards for the chunks “is over ...”,
“is over”, “is over .”

5 Conclusion and future work

In this work, we have proposed a simple way to
integrate partial chunk-based feedback into NMT
training. We have experimented with artificially
created partial feedback and shown that using par-
tial feedback results in significant improvements
of MT quality in terms of BLEU and TER. We
have shown that chunk-level feedback can be used
more effectively than sentence-level feedback. We
have studied the robustness of our approach and
observed that our model is robust against a moder-
ate amount of noise.

We argue that collecting partial feedback by
asking users to highlight correct parts of a transla-
tion is more intuitive for users than sentence level
ratings and leads to less variation and errors.

In the future, we plan to investigate how to in-
tegrate negative partial user feedback, as well as
automatic feedback generation methods which do
not rely on existing parallel data.
