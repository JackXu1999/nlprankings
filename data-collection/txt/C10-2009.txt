Abstract

This paper presents a framework for com-
bining semantic relations extracted from
text to reveal even more semantics that
otherwise would be missed. A set of 26 re-
lations is introduced, with their arguments
deﬁned on an ontology of sorts. A seman-
tic parser is used to extract these relations
from noun phrases and verb argument
structures. The method was successfully
used in two applications: rapid customiza-
tion of semantic relations to arbitrary do-
mains and recognizing entailments.

1 Introduction

Semantic representation of text facilitates infer-
ences, reasoning, and greatly improves the per-
formance of Question Answering, Information
Extraction, Machine Translation and other NLP
applications. Broadly speaking, semantic rela-
tions are unidirectional underlying connections
between concepts. For example, the noun phrase
the car engine encodes a PART-WHOLE relation:
the engine is a part of the car.

Semantic relations are the building blocks for
creating a semantic structure of a sentence. There
is a growing interest in text semantics fueled by
the new wave of semantic technologies and on-
tologies that aim at transforming unstructured text
into structured knowledge. More and more enter-
prises and academic organizations have adopted
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Re-
source Description Framework (RDF) speciﬁca-
tion as a standard representation of text knowl-
edge. This is based on semantic triples, which can
be used to represent semantic relations.

The work reported in this paper aims at extract-
ing as many semantic relations from text as possi-

ble. Semantic parsers (SP) extract semantic rela-
tions from text. Typically they detect relations be-
tween adjacent concepts or verb argument struc-
tures, leaving considerable semantics unrevealed.
For example, given John is a rich man, a typical
SP extracts John is a man and man is rich, but not
John is rich. The third relation can be extracted
by combining the two relations detected by the
parser. The observation that combining elemen-
tary semantic relations yields more relations is the
starting point and the motivation for this work.

2 Related Work

In Computational Linguistics, WordNet (Miller,
1995), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and Prop-
Bank (Palmer et al., 2005) are probably the most
used semantic resources. Like our approach and
unlike PropBank, FrameNet annotates semantics
between concepts regardless of their position in a
parse tree. Unlike us, they use a predeﬁned set of
frames to be ﬁlled. PropBank adds semantic an-
notation on top of the Penn TreeBank and it con-
tains only annotations between a verb and its ar-
guments. Moreover, the semantics of a given label
depends on the verb. For example, ARG2 is used
for INSTRUMENT and VALUE.

Copious work has been done lately on seman-
tic roles (M`arquez et al., 2008). Approaches to
detect semantic relations usually focus on partic-
ular lexical and syntactic patterns or kind of ar-
guments. There are both unsupervised (Turney,
2006) and supervised approaches. The SemEval-
2007 Task 4 (Girju et al., 2007) focused on rela-
tions between nominals. Work has been done on
detecting relations between noun phrases (Davi-
dov and Rappoport, 2008; Moldovan et al., 2004),
named entities (Hirano et al., 2007), and clauses
(Szpakowicz et al., 1995). There have been pro-

73

posals to detect a particular relation, e.g., CAUSE
(Chang and Choi, 2006), INTENT (Tatu, 2005) and
PART-WHOLE (Girju et al., 2006).

Researchers have also worked on combining se-
mantic relations. Harabagiu and Moldovan (1998)
combine WordNet relations and Helbig (2005)
transforms chains of relations into theoretical ax-
ioms. Some use logic as the underlying formal-
ism (Lakoff, 1970; S´anchez Valencia, 1991), more
ideas can be found in (Copestake et al., 2001).

3 Approach

In contrast to First Order Logic used in AI to rep-
resent text knowledge, we believe text semantics
should be represented using a ﬁxed set of rela-
tions. This facilitates a more standard represen-
tation and extraction automation which in turn al-
lows reasoning. The fewer the relation types, the
easier it is to reason and perform inferences. Thus,
a compromise has to be made between having
enough relation types to adequately represent text
knowledge and yet keeping the number small for
making the extraction and manipulation feasible.
The main contributions of this paper are: (i) an
extended deﬁnition of a set of 26 semantic rela-
tions resulted after many iterations and pragmatic
considerations; (ii) deﬁnition of a semantic calcu-
lus, a framework to manipulate and compose se-
mantic relations (CSR); (iii) use of CSR to rapidly
customize a set of semantic relations; and (iv) use
of CSR to detect entailments. The adoption of
CSR to other semantic projects does not require
any modiﬁcation of existing tools while being able
to detect relations ignored by such tools.

4 Semantic Relations

Formally, a semantic relation is represented as
R(x, y), where R is the relation type and x and
y the ﬁrst and second argument. R(x, y) should be
read as xis R of y. The sentence “John painted his
truck” yields AGENT(John, painted), THEME(his
truck, painted) and POSSESSION(truck, John).
Extended deﬁnition Given a semantic relation R,
DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R) are deﬁned as the set
of sorts of concepts that can be part of the ﬁrst
and second argument. A semantic relation R(x,
y) is deﬁned by its: (i) relation type R; (ii) DO-

MAIN(R); and (iii) RANGE(R). Stating restric-
tions for DOMAIN and RANGE has several advan-
tages: it (i) helps distinguishing between relations,
e.g., [tall]ql and [John]aco can be linked through
VALUE, but not POSSESSION; (ii) helps discard-
ing potential relations that do not hold, e.g., ab-
stract objects do not have INTENT; and (iii) helps
combining semantic relations (Section 5).
Ontology of Sorts In order to deﬁne DOMAIN(R)
and RANGE(R), we use a customized ontology
of sorts (Figure 1) modiﬁed from (Helbig, 2005).
The root corresponds to entities, which refers to all
things about which something can be said.

Objects can be either concrete or abstract. The
former occupy space, are touchable and tangi-
ble. The latter are intangible; they are somehow a
product of human reasoning. Concrete objects are
further divided into animate or inanimate. The for-
mer have life, vigor or spirit; the later are dull,
without life. Abstract objects are divided into tem-
poral or non temporal. The ﬁrst corresponds to ab-
stractions regarding points or periods of time (e.g.
July, last week); the second to any other abstrac-
tion (e.g. disease, justice). Abstract objects can be
sensually perceived, e.g., pain, odor.

Situations are anything that happens at a time
and place. Simply put, if one can think of the time
and location of an entity, it is a situation. Events
(e.g. mix, grow) imply a change in the status of
other entities, states (e.g.
standing next to the
door) do not. Situations can be expressed by verbs
(e.g. move, print) or nouns (e.g. party, hurricane).
Descriptors complement entities by stating prop-
erties about their spatial or temporal context. They
are composed of an optional non-content word
signaling the local or temporal context and another
entity. Local descriptors are further composed of
a concrete object or situation, e.g., [above]prep [the
roof]co; temporal descriptors by a temporal abstract
object or situation, e.g., [during]prep [the party]ev.
The non-content word signaling the local or tempo-
ral context is usually present, but not always, e.g.,
“The [birthplace]ev of his mother is [Ankara]loc”.
Qualities represent characteristics than can be
assigned to entities. They can be quantiﬁable like
tall and heavy, or unquantiﬁable like difﬁcult and
sleepy. Quantities represent quantitative character-
istics of concepts, e.g., a few pounds, 22 yards.

4.1 Semantic Relation Types

This work focuses on the set of 26 semantic rela-
tions depicted in Table 1. We found this set spe-
ciﬁc enough to capture the most frequent seman-
tics of text without bringing unnecessary overspe-
cialization. The set is inspired by several pre-
vious proposals. Fillmore introduced the notion
of case frames and proposed a set of nine roles:
AGENT, EXPERIENCER, INSTRUMENT, OBJECT,
SOURCE, GOAL, LOCATION, TIME and PATH
(Fillmore, 1971). Fillmore’s work was extended
to FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).
PropBank
(Palmer et al., 2005) annotates a set of 17 seman-
tic roles in a per-verb basis.

We aim to encode relations not only between
a verb and its arguments, but also between and
within noun phrases and adjective phrases. There-
fore, more relations are added to the set.
It

in WordNet (Miller,
includes relations present
1995), such as IS-A, PART-WHOLE and CAUSE.
Szpakowicz et al. (1995) proposed a set of nine
relations and Turney (2006) a set of ﬁve. Rosario
and Hearst (2004) proposed a set of 38 relations
including standard case roles and a set of speciﬁc
relations for medical domain. Helbig (2005) pro-
posed a set of 89 relations, including ANTONYMY
and several TEMPORAL relations, e.g. SUCCES-
SION, EXTENSION, END.

Our set clusters some of the previous propos-
als (e.g. we only consider AT-TIME) and discards
relations proposed elsewhere when they did not
occur frequently enough in our experiments. For
example, even though ANTONYMY and ENTAIL-
MENT are semantically grounded, they are very
infrequent and we do not deal with them. Our
pragmatic goal is to capture as many semantics as
possible with as few relations as possible. How-

75

ever, we show (Section 7.1) that our set can be
easily customized to a speciﬁc domain.

The 26 relations are clustered such that rela-
tions belonging to the same cluster are close in
meaning. Working with clusters is useful because
it allows us to: (i) map to other proposed relations,
justifying the chosen set of relations; (ii) work
with different levels of speciﬁcity; and (iii) reason
with the relations in a per cluster basis.

The reason cluster includes relations between a
concept having a direct impact on another. CAU(x,
y) holds if y would not hold if x did not happen.
JST(x, y) encodes a moral cause, motive or so-
cially convened norm. If IFL(x, y), x affects the
intensity of y, but it does not affect its occurrence.
INT(x,
y) encodes intended consequences, which are vo-
litional. PRP(x, y) is a broader relation and can be
deﬁned for inanimate objects.

The goal cluster includes INT and PRP.

The object modiﬁers cluster encodes descriptions
of objects and situations: SRC(x, y) holds if x ex-
presses the origin of y. VAL(x, y) holds for any
other attribute, e.g. heavy, handsome.

The syntactic subjects cluster includes relations
linking a syntactic subject and a situation. The dif-
ferences rely on the characteristics of the subject
and the connection per se. AGT(x, y) encodes an
intentional doer, x must be volitional. If EXP(x,
y), x does not change the situation, it only expe-
riences y; it does not participate intentionally in y
either. If INS(x, y), x is used to perform y, x is a
tool or device that facilitates y.

The direct objects cluster includes relations en-
coding syntactic direct objects. THM(x, y) holds
if x is affected or directly involved by y. TPC(x, y)
holds if y is a communication verb, like talk and
argue. STI(x, y) holds if y is a perception verb
and x a stimulus that makes y happen.

The association cluster includes ASO and KIN.
ASO is a broad relation between any pair of enti-
ties; KIN encodes a relation between relatives.

The rest of the relations do not fall into any
cluster.
ISA, PW, SYN, AT-L and AT-T have been
widely studied in the literature. MAK(x, y) holds
if y makes or produces x; POS(x, y) holds if y
owns x; MNR encodes the way a situation occurs.
RCP captures the connection between an event and
an object which is the receiver of the event. PRO

describes links between a situation or object and
its characteristics, e.g., height, age. Values to the
characteristics are given through VAL. QNT(x, y)
holds if y is quantitatively determined by x.

Relations can also be classiﬁed depending on
the kind of concepts they describe and their in-
tra or inter nature into: (i) Intra-Object; (ii) Inter-
Objects; (iii) Intra-Situation; (iv) Inter-Situations;
and (v) for Object and Situation description.

4.2 Detection of Semantic Relations

Relations are extracted by an in-house SP from
a wide variety of syntactic realizations. For ex-
ample, the compound nominal steel knife con-
tains PW(steel, knife), whereas carving knife con-
tains PRP(carving, knife); the genitive Mary’s toy
contains POS(toy, Mary), whereas Mary’s brother
contains KIN(brother, Mary), and eyes of the baby
contains a PW(eyes, baby). Relations are also ex-
tracted from a verb and its arguments (NP verb,
verb NP, verb PP, verb ADVP and verb S), adjec-
tive phrases and adjective clauses.

The SP ﬁrst uses a combination of state-of-the-
art text processing tools, namely, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, syntactic pars-
ing and word sense disambiguation. After a can-
didate syntactic pattern has been found, a series of
machine learning classiﬁers are applied to decide
if a relation holds. Four different algorithms are
used: decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM and Se-
mantic Scattering combined in a hybrid approach.
Some algorithms use a per-relation approach (i.e.,
decide whether or not a given relation holds) and
others a per-pattern approach (i.e., which relation,
if any, holds for a particular pattern). Additionally,
human-coded rules are used for a few unambigu-
ous cases. The SP participated in the SemEval
2007 Task 4 (Badulescu and Srikanth, 2007).

5 Composition of Semantic Relations

The goal of semantic calculus (SC) is to provide
a formal framework for manipulating semantic re-
lations. CSR is a part of this, its goal is to apply
inference axioms over already identiﬁed relations
in text in order to infer more relations.

Semantic Calculus: Operators and Properties
The composition operator is represented by the

76

(R−1)−1 = R
Ri ◦ Rj = (Rj−1 ◦ Ri−1)−1
R−1 inherits all the properties of R
⊥−1 = ⊥
∀i: ⊥ ⊲⊳ Ri
R is reﬂexive iff ∀x: R(x, x)
R is symmetric iff R(x, y) = R(y, x)
R is transitive iff R(x, y) ◦ R(y, z) → R(x, z)
Ri ⊲ Rj ↔ Ri−1 ⊳ Rj−1
Ri ⊲⊳ Rj ↔ Ri−1 ⊲⊳ Rj−1
If Ri is symmetric and Ri ⊲⊳ Rj, Ri−1 ⊲⊳ Rj
If Rj is symmetric and Ri ⊲⊳ Rj, Ri ⊲⊳ Rj−1

Table 2: Semantic calculus properties

symbol ◦.
It combines two relations and yields
a third one. Formally, we denote R1 ◦ R2 → R3.
The inverse of R is denoted R−1 and can be ob-
tained by simply switching its arguments. Given
R(x, y), R−1(y, x) always holds. The easiest way
to read R−1(y, x) is xis R of y.

R1 left dominates R2, denoted by R1 ⊲ R2,
iff the composition of R1 and R2 yields R1, i.e.,
R1 ⊲ R2 iff R1 ◦ R2 → R1. R1 right dominates R2,
denoted by R1 ⊳ R2, iff the composition of R2 and
R1 yields R1, i.e., R1 ⊳ R2 iff R2 ◦ R1 → R1. R1
completely dominates R2, denoted by R1 ⊲⊳ R2, iff
R1 ⊲ R2 and R1 ⊳ R2, i.e., R1 ⊲⊳ R2 iff R1 ◦ R2 →
R1 and R2 ◦ R1 → R1.
An OTHER (⊥) relation holds between x and y
if no relation from the given set holds. Formally,
⊥(x, y) iff ¬∃Ri such that Ri(x, y).
picted in Table 2 follow.

Using the notation above, the properties de-

Necessary conditions for Combining Relations
Axioms can be deﬁned only for compatible rela-
tions as premises. R1 and R2 are compatible if it
is possible, from a theoretical point of view, to ap-
ply the composition operator to them. Formally,
RANGE(R1) ∩ DOMAIN(R2) 6= ∅
If R1 and R2 are compatible but not equal a
restriction occurs. Let us denote RANGE(R1) ∩
DOMAIN(R2) = I. A backward restriction takes
place if RANGE(R1) 6= I and a forward restric-
In the former case
tion if DOMAIN(R2) 6= I.
RANGE(R1) is reduced; in the later DOMAIN(R2)
is reduced. A forward and backward restriction
can be found with the same pair of relations.

It is important to note that two compatible rela-
tions may not be the premises for a valid axiom.

For example, KIN and AT-L are compatible but do
not yield any valid inference.

Another necessary condition for combining two
relations R1(x, y) and R2(y, z) is that they have to
have a common argument, y.

5.1 Unique axioms
An axiom is deﬁned as a set of relations called
premises and a conclusion. Given the premises it
unequivocally yields a relation that holds as con-
clusion. The composition operator is the basic
way of combining two relations to form an axiom.

In general, for n relations there are (cid:0)n

n(n−1)
different pairs. For each pair, taking into
account the two relations and their inverses, there
are 4 × 4 = 16 different possible combinations.
Applying property Ri ◦ Rj = (Rj−1 ◦ Ri−1)−1,
only 10 combinations are unique: (i) 4 combine
R1, R2 and their inverses; (ii) 3 combine R1 and
R1−1; and (iii) 3 combine R2 and R2−1. The most
interesting axioms fall into category (i), since the
other two can be resolved by the transitivity prop-
erty of a relation and its inverse.

2(cid:1) =

For n relations there are 2n2 + n potential ax-

ioms:(cid:0)n

2(cid:1)×4+3n = 2×n(n−1)+3n = 2n2+n.

For n = 26, there are 1300 potential axioms in (i),
820 of which are compatible.

The number can be further reduced. After man-
ual examination of combinations of ASO and KIN
with other relations, we conclude that they do not
yield any valid inferences, invalidating 150 poten-
tial axioms. This is due to the broad meaning of
these relations. QNT can be discarded as well, in-
validating 45 more potential axioms.

Some axioms can be easily validated. Because
synonymous concepts are interchangeable, SYN is
easily combined with any other relation: SYN(x,
y) ◦ R(y, z) → R(x, z) and R(x, y) ◦ SYN(y, z) →
R(x, z). Because hyponyms inherit relations from
their hypernyms, ISA(x, y) ◦ R(y, z) → R(x, z)
and R(x, y) ◦ ISA−1(y, z) → R(x, z) hold. These
observations allow us to validate 138 of the 625
potential axioms left, still leaving 487.

As noted before, relations belonging to the
same cluster tend to behave similarly. This is es-
pecially true for the reason and goal clusters due
to their semantic motivation. Working with these
two clusters instead of the relations brings the

number of axioms to be examined down to 370.

Out of the 370 axioms left, we have extensively
analyzed and deﬁned the 35 involving AT-L, the
43 involving reason and the 58 involving goal. Be-
cause of space constraints, in this paper we only
fully introduce the axioms for reason and goal
(Section 6), as well as a variety of axioms useful
to recognize textual entailments (Section 7.2).

6 Case Study: Reason and Goal

In this section, we present the four unique axioms
for reason and goal relations (Table 3).

event is inﬂuenced by the reason of its goal.

(1) REA(x, y) ◦ GOA(y, z) → IFL(x, z): an
For example: Bill saves money because he is
unemployed; he spends far less than he used to.
Therefore, being unemployed can lead to spend
far less.

P

REA(beunemployed, savemoney)
GOA(savemoney, spendfarless)

C IFL(beunemployed, spendfarless)

(2) REA−1(x, y) ◦ GOA(y, z) → PRP(x, z):
events have as their purpose the effects of their
goals. This is a strong relation.

For example: Since they have a better view,
they can see the mountain range. They cut the tree
to have a better view. Therefore, they cut the tree
to see the mountain range.

P

REA−1(seethemountainrange, betterview)
GOA(betterview, cutthetree)

C PRP(seethemountainrange, cutthetree)
Note that possible unintended effects of cutting
the tree (e.g. homeowners’ association complains)
are caused by the event cutthetree, not by its ef-
fect getabetterview.

Events inﬂuence the goals of its effects.

(4) GOA(x, y) ◦ REA−1(y, z) → IFL−1(x, z).
For example: Jane exercises to lose weight. She
exercised because of the good weather. Therefore,
good weather helps to lose weight.

P

GOA(loseweight, exercise)
REA−1(exercise, goodweather)

C IFL−1(loseweight, goodweather)
The axioms have been evaluated using manu-
ally annotated data. PropBank CAU and PNC are
used as reason and goal. Reason annotation is fur-
ther collected from a corpus which adds causal
annotation to the Penn TreeBank (Bethard et al.,
2008). A total of 5 and 29 instances for axioms
3 and 4 were found. For all of them, the ax-
ioms yield a valid inference. For example, Buick
[approached]y American express about [a joint
promotion]x because [its card holders generally
have a good credit history]z. PropBank annota-
tion states GOA(x, y) and REA−1(y, z), axiom 4
makes the implicit relation IFL−1(x, z) explicit.

7 Applications and Results

7.1 Customization of Semantic Relations
Problem There is no agreement on a set of rela-
tions that best represent text semantics. This is
rightfully so since different applications and do-
mains call for different relations. CSR can be used
to rapidly customize a set of relations without hav-
ing to train a new SP or modify any other tool.
Given a text, the SP extracts 26 elementary se-
mantic relations. Axioms within the framework
of CSR yield n new relations, resulting in a richer
semantic representation (Figure 2).
CSR axioms Two ways to get new relations are:
(i) Direct mapping. This is the easiest case and
it is equivalent to rename a relation. For example,
we can map POS to BELONG or IS-OWNER-OF.

(ii) Combinations of two elementary relations
yield new specialized relations. In this case, re-
strictions on the arguments must be fulﬁlled.

Consider we need the new relation AR-
RESTED(x, y), which encodes the relation be-
tween two animate concrete objects x and y, where
x arrested y. We can infer this relation by using

the following axiom: AGENT(x, y) ◦ THEME−1(y,
z) → ARRESTED(x, z) provided that y is an ar-
rested concept. A simple way of checking if a
given concept is of a certain kind is to check
WordNet. Collecting all the words belonging the
the synset arrest.v.1, we get the following list of
arrested concepts: collar, nail, apprehend, pick
up, nab and cop. Using lexical chains the list
could be further improved.

More examples of axioms for generating cus-
tomized semantic relations are shown in Table 4.
Results Virtually any domain could be covered
by applying customization over the set of 26
relations. The set has been successfully cus-
tomized to a law enforcement domain. Ax-

ioms for a total of 37 new relations were de-
ﬁned and implemented. Among others, ax-
ioms to infer IS-EMPLOYER, IS-COWORKER, IS-
PARAMOUR, IS-INTERPRETER, WAS-ASSASSIN,
ATTENDS-SCHOOL-AT, JAILED-AT, COHABITS-
WITH, AFFILIATED-TO, MARRIED-TO, RENTED-
BY, KIDNAPPED-BY and the relations in Table 4
were deﬁned. Note that a relation can be inferred
by several axioms. This customization effort to
add 37 new specialized relations took a person
only a few days and without modifying the SP.

7.2 Textual Entailment
Problem An application of CSR is recognizing
entailments. Given text T and hypothesis H, the
task consists on determining whether or not H can
be inferred by T (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).
CSR axioms Several examples of the RTE3 chal-
lenge can be solved by applying CSR (Table 5).
The rest of this section depicts the axioms in-
volved in detecting entailment for each pair.

Pair 113 is a simple one. A perfect match
for H in T can be obtained by an axiom reading
all concepts inherit the semantic relations of their
hypernyms. Formally, ISA(x, y) ◦ THM(y, z) →
THM(x, z), T 2 and T 4 are the premises and the
conclusion matches H2. T 1 matches H1.

Pair 429 can be solved by an axiom read-
ing agents are values for their themes. Formally,
AGT(x, y) ◦ THM−1(y, z) → VAL(x, z); T 1 and
T 2 yield VAL(Hindu, Ganga), which combined
with T 3 results in a match between T and H.

Pair 445 follows a similar pattern, but the way
an EXP combines with its THM differs from the
way an AGT does. The theme is a value of the
experiencer, THM(x, y) ◦ EXP−1(y, z) → VAL(x,
z). Given T 2 and T 3,
the axiom yields T 4:
VAL(video, site). Assuming that SYN(site, web-
site), T 1 and T 4 match H.

Pair 716 also requires only one inference step.
Using T 3 and T 2, an axiom reading situations
have as their purpose the purpose of its theme in-
fers H2, yielding a perfect match between T and
H. Formally, PRP(x, y) ◦ THM(y, z) → PRP(x, z).
Pair 771 Using as premises T 1 and T 2, an ax-
iom reading an agent performs the purposes of its
actions infers H1. Using T 3 and T 5, and T 4
and T 5 as premises, an axiom reading synony-

mous concepts are interchangeable infers H2 and
H3, resulting in a perfect match between T and
H. Formally, AGT(x, y) ◦ PRP−1(y, z) → AGT(x,
z), RCP−1(x, y) ◦ SYN(y, z) → RCP−1(x, z) and
QNT(x, y) ◦ SYN(y, z) → QNT(x, z).
Results We conducted two experiments to quan-
tify the impact of CSR in detecting entailments.

First, 60 pairs were randomly selected from the
RTE3 challenge and parsed with the SP. 14 of
them (23%) could be solved by simply matching
the elementary relations in T and H. After apply-
ing CSR, 21 more pairs (35%) were solved. Thus,
adding CSR on top of the SP clearly improves en-
tailment detection. Out of the 25 pairs not solved,
5 (8%) need coreference resolution and 20 (34%)
require commonsense knowledge or fairly com-
plicated reasoning methods (e.g. a shipwreck is a
ship that sank).

CSR has also been added to a state of the art
system for detecting textual entailment (Tatu and
Moldovan, 2007). Prior to the addition, the sys-
tem made 222 errors consisting of 46 false nega-
tives (examples in Table 5) and 176 false positives.
CSR was able to correctly solve 18 (39%) of the
46 false negatives.

8 Conclusions

Although the idea of chaining semantic relations
has been proposed before, this paper provides a
formal framework establishing necessary condi-
tions for composition of semantic relations. The
CSR presented here can be used to rapidly cus-
tomize a set of relations to any arbitrary domain.
In addition to the customization of an informa-
tion extraction tool and recognizing textual entail-
ments, CSR has the potential to contribute to other
applications. For example, it can help improve a
semantic parser, it can be used to acquire com-
monsense knowledge axioms and more.

When an axiom that results from combining
two relations does not always hold, it may be pos-
sible to add constraints that limit the arguments of
the premises to only some concepts.

This work stems from the need to automate the
extraction of deep semantics from text and repre-
senting text as semantic triples. The paper demon-
strates that CSR is able to extract more relations
than a normal semantic parser would.
