Complexity of Dependency Representations for Natural Languages

Most of the formal issues about the complexity of dependency representations are studied via various types of
phrase structure grammars and their capabilities for representing dependencies. We will consider a particular
kind of phrase structure grammar, well suited to describe various levels of complexity in the context of
dependencies. We will relate these representations to some key linguistic issues and the corresponding parsing
complexities. We hope that this work will give some further insight into the limits of dependency representations
as well as the associated processing complexities.
