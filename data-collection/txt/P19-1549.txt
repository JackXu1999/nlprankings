Abstract
Multi-turn conversations consist of complex
semantic structures, and it is still a challenge
to generate coherent and diverse responses
given previous utterances. It’s practical that a
conversation takes place under a background,
meanwhile, the query and response are usu-
ally most related and they are consistent in
topic but also different in content. However,
little work focuses on such hierarchical rela-
tionship among utterances. To address this
problem, we propose a Conversational Seman-
tic Relationship RNN (CSRR) model to con-
struct the dependency explicitly. The model
contains latent variables in three hierarchies.
The discourse-level one captures the global
background, the pair-level one stands for the
common topic information between query and
response, and the utterance-level ones try to
represent differences in content. Experimen-
tal results show that our model significantly
improves the quality of responses in terms of
fluency, coherence and diversity compared to
baseline methods.

1 Introduction

Inspired by the observation that real-world human
conversations are usually multi-turn, some stud-
ies have focused on multi-turn conversations and
taken context (history utterances in previous turns)
into account for response generation. How to
model the relationship between the response and
context is essential to generate coherent and logi-
cal conversations. Currently, the researchers em-
ploy some hierarchical architectures to model the
relationship. Serban et al. (2016) use a context
RNN to integrate historical information, Tian et al.
(2017) sum up all utterances weighted by the sim-
ilarity score between an utterance and the query,
while Zhang et al. (2018) apply attention mecha-
nism on history utterances. Besides, Xing et al.

(2018) add a word-level attention to capture fine-
grained features.

In practice, we usually need to understand the
meaning of utterances and capture their semantic
dependency, not just word-level alignments (Luo
et al., 2018). As shown in Table 1, this short con-
versation is about speaker A asks the current sit-
uation of speaker B. At the beginning, they talk
about B’s position. Then in the last two utter-
ances, both speakers think about the way for B
to come back. A mentions “umbrella”, while B
wants A to “pick him/her up”. What’s more, there
is no “word-to-word” matching in query and re-
sponse. Unfortunately, the aforementioned hierar-
chical architectures do not model the meaning of
each utterance explicitly and has to summarize the
meaning of utterances on the fly during generat-
ing the response, and hence there is no guarantee
that the inferred meaning is adequate to the origi-
nal utterance. To address this problem, variational
autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2014)
are introduced to learn the meaning of utterances
explicitly and a reconstruction loss is employed to
make sure the learned meaning is faithful to the
corresponding utterance. Besides, more variations
are imported into utterance level to help generate
more diverse responses.

A: Where are you?
B: I’m stuck in my office with rain.
A: Didn’t you bring your umbrella?
B: No. Please come and pick me up.

multi-turn conversation.

However, all these frameworks ignore the prac-
tical situation that a conversation usually takes
place under a background with two speakers com-
municating interactively and query is the most rel-
evant utterance to the response. Hence we need

to pay more attention to the relationship between
query and response. To generate a coherent and
engaging conversation, query and response should
be consistent in topic and have some differences
in content, the logical connection between which
makes sure the conversation can go on smoothly.

On these grounds, we propose a novel Conver-
sational Semantic Relationship RNN (CSRR) to
explicitly learn the semantic dependency in multi-
turn conversations. CSRR employs hierarchical
latent variables based on VAEs to represent the
meaning of utterances and meanwhile learns the
relationship between query and response. Specif-
ically, CSRR draws the background of the con-
versation with a discourse-level latent variable
and then models the consistent semantics between
query and response, e.g. the topic, with a com-
mon latent variable shared by the query and re-
sponse pair, and finally models the specific mean-
ing of the query and the response with a certain
latent variable for each of them to capture the con-
tent difference. With these latent variables, we
can learn the relationship between utterances hi-
erarchically, especially the logical connection be-
tween the query and response. What is the most
important, the latent variables are constrained to
reconstruct the original utterances according to the
hierarchical structure we define, making sure the
semantics flow through the latent variables with-
out any loss. Experimental results on two public
datasets show that our model outperforms baseline
methods in generating high-quality responses.

2 Approach

Given n input messages {ut}n−1t=0 , we consider the
last one un−1 as query and others as context. un
denotes corresponding response.

The proposed model is shown in Figure 1. We
add latent variables in three hierarchies to HRED
(Serban et al., 2016). zc is used to control the
whole background in which the conversation takes
place, zp is for the consistency of topic between
query and response pair, zq and zr try to model
the content difference in each of them, respec-
tively. For simplicity of equation description, we
use n− 1 and n as the substitution of q and r.

2.1 Context Representation
Each utterance ut is encoded into a vector vt by a
bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), futtθ :

vt = f
utt
θ (ut) (1)

Figure 1: Graphical model of CSRR. ut is the t-th ut-
terance, hct encodes context information up to time t.

For the inter-utterance representation, we follow
the way proposed by Park et al. (2018), which is
calculated as:

hct =

{
MLPθ(zc), if t = 0

f ctxθ (hct−1 ,vt−1, z
c), otherwise

(2)

f ctxθ (·) is the activation function of GRU. zc is
the discourse-level latent variable with a standard
Gaussian distribution as its prior distribution, that
is:

pθ(z
c) = N (z|0, I) (3)

For the inference of zc, we use a BiGRU f c to run
over all utterance vectors {vt}nt=0 in training set.
({vt}n−1t=0 in test set):

qφ(z
c|v0, ...,vn) = N (z|µc,σcI) (4)

where vc = f c(v0, ...,vn) (5)

µc = MLPφ(vc) (6)

σc = Softplus(MLPφ(vc)) (7)

MLP(·) is a feed-forward network, and Softplus
function is a smooth approximation to the ReLU
function and can be used to ensure positiveness
(Park et al., 2018; Serban et al., 2017; Chung et al.,
2015).

2.2 Query-Response Relationship Modeling
According to VAEs, texts can be generated from
latent variables (Shen et al., 2017). Motivated by
this, we add two kinds of latent variables: pair-
level and also utterance-level ones for query and
response.

As depicted in Figure 1, hcn−1 encodes all con-
text information from utterance u0 to un−2. We
use zp to model the topic in query and response
pair. Under the same topic, there are always
some differences in content between query and re-
sponse, which is represented by zq and zr, respec-
tively. We first define the prior distribution of zp



5499

as follows:

pθ(z
p|u<n−1, zc) = N (z|µn−1,σn−1I) (8)

u<n−1 denotes utterances {ui}n−2i=0 , µn−1 and
σn−1 are calculated as:

µn−1 = MLPθ(hcn−1 , z
c) (9)

σn−1 = Softplus(MLPθ(hcn−1 , z
c)) (10)

Since zq(zn−1) and zr(zn) are also under the con-
trol of zp, we define the prior distributions of them
as:

pθ(z
i|u<i, zc, zp) = N (z|µi,σiI) (11)

Here, i = n− 1 or n. The means and the diagonal
variances are computed as:

µi = MLPθ(hci , z
c, zp) (12)

σi = Softplus(MLPθ(hci , z
c, zp)) (13)

The posterior distributions are:

qφ(z
p|u≤n−1, zc) = N (z|µ

′
n−1,σ

′
n−1I) (14)

qφ(z
i|u≤i, zc, zp) = N (z|µ

′
i,σ

′
iI) (15)

qφ(·) is a recognition model used to approximate
the intractable true posterior distribution. The
means and the diagonal variances are defined as:

µ
′
n−1 = MLPφ(vn−1,vn,hcn−1 , z

c) (16)

σ
′
n−1 = Softplus(MLPφ(vn−1,vn,hcn−1 , z

c))
(17)

µ
′
i = MLPφ(vi,hci , z

c, zp) (18)

σ
′
i = Softplus(MLPφ(vi,hci , z

c, zp)) (19)

Note that in Equation 16 and 17, both vn−1 and
vn are taken into consideration, while Equation 18
and 19 use zp and corresponding vi.

2.3 Training
Because of the existence of latent variables in
query-response pair, we use decoder fdecθ to gen-
erate un−1 and un:

pθ(ui|u<i) = fdecθ (ui|hci , zc, zp, zi) (20)

The training objective is to maximize the fol-
lowing variational lower-bound:

log pθ(un−1,un|u0, ...,un−2) ≥
Eqφ [log pθ(ui|z

c, zp, zi,u<i)]

−DKL(qφ(zc|u≤n)||pθ(zc))
−DKL(qφ(zp|u≤n)||pθ(zp|u<n−1))

−
n∑

i=n−1
DKL(qφ(z

i|u≤i)||pθ(zi|u<i))

(21)

Equation 21 consists of two parts: the reconstruc-
tion term and KL divergence terms based on three
kinds of latent variables.

3 Experiment

3.1 Experimental Settings

Datasets: We conduct our experiment on Ubuntu
Dialog Corpus (Lowe et al., 2015) and Cornell
Movie Dialog Corpus (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
and Lee, 2011). As Cornell Movie Dialog does
not provide a separate test set, we randomly split
the corpus with the ratio 8:1:1. For each dataset,
we keep conversations with more than 3 utter-
ances. The number of multi-turn conversations
in train/valid/test set is 898142/19560/18920 for
Ubuntu Dialog, and 36004/4501/4501 for Cornell
Movie Dialog.
Hyper-parameters: In our model and all base-
lines, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al.,
2014) is selected as the fundamental cell in en-
coder and decoder layers, and the hidden dimen-
sion is 1,000. We set the word embedding di-
mension to 500, and all latent variables have a di-
mension of 100. For optimization, we use Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2015) with gradient clipping.
The sentence padding length is set to 15, and the
max conversation length is 10. In order to alle-
viate degeneration problem of variational frame-
work (Bowman et al., 2016), we also apply KL
annealing (Bowman et al., 2016) in all models
with latent variables. The KL annealing steps are
15,000 for Cornell Movie Dialog and 250,000 for
Ubuntu Dialog.
Baseline Models: We compare our model with
three baselines. They all focus on multi-turn con-
versations, and the third one is a state-of-the-
art variational model. 1) Hierarchical recurrent
encoder-decoder (HRED) (Serban et al., 2016).
2) Variational HRED (VHRED) (Serban et al.,
2017) with word drop (w.d) and KL annealing
(Bowman et al., 2016), the word drop ratio equals
to 0.25. 3) Variational Hierarchical Conversa-
tion RNN (VHCR) with utterance drop (u.d) (Park
et al., 2018) and KL annealing, the utterance drop
ratio equals to 0.25.

3.2 Evaluation Design

Open-domain response generation does not have
a standard criterion for automatic evaluation, like
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for machine transla-
tion. Our model is designed to improve the co-

herence/relevance and diversity of generated re-
sponses. To measure the performance effectively,
we use 5 automatic evaluation metrics along with
human evaluation.
Average, Greedy and Extrema: Rather than cal-
culating the token-level or n-gram similarity as
the perplexity and BLEU, these three metrics are
embedding-based and measure the semantic simi-
larity between the words in the generated response
and the ground truth (Serban et al., 2017; Liu et al.,
2016). We use word2vec embeddings trained on
the Google News Corpus 1 in this section. Please
refer to Serban et al. (2017) for more details.
Dist-1 and Dist-2: Following the work of Li et al.
(2016), we apply Distinct to report the degree of
diversity. Dist-1/2 is defined as the ratio of unique
uni/bi-grams over all uni/bi-grams in generated re-
sponses.
Human Evaluation: Since automatic evaluation
results may not be fully consistent with human
judgements (Liu et al., 2016), human evaluation
is necessary. Inspired by Luo et al. (2018), we
use following three criteria. Fluency measures
whether the generated responses have grammati-
cal errors. Coherence denotes the semantic con-
sistency and relevance between a response and its
context. Informativeness indicates whether the
response is meaningful and good at word usage.
A general reply should have the lowest Informa-
tiveness score. Each of these measurement scores
ranges from 1 to 5. We randomly sample 100
examples from test set and generate total 400 re-
sponses using models mentioned above. All gen-
erated responses are scored by 7 annotators, who
are postgraduate students and not involved in other
parts of the experiment.

3.3 Results of Automatic Evaluation
The left part of Table 2 is about automatic eval-
uation on test set. The proposed CSRR model
significantly outperforms other baselines on three
embedding-based metrics on both datasets. The
improvement of our model indicates our seman-
tic relationship modeling better reflects the struc-
ture of real-world conversations, and the responses
generated by our models are more relevant to con-
text. As for diversity, CSRR also gets the highest
Dist-1 and Dist-2 scores.

For Ubuntu Dialog dataset, VHRED+w.d is the
worst. With the help of discourse-level latent vari-
able and utterance drop, VHCR+u.d leads to bet-
ter performance. However, HRED is the worst
on the Cornell Movie dataset. Park et al. (2018)
empirically explained the difference based on that
Cornell Movie Dialog dataset is small in size, but
very diverse and complex in content and style, and
models like HRED often fail to generate appropri-
ate responses for the context.

3.4 Results of Human Evaluation
The right part of Table 2 is about human evaluation
results on 400 (100×4) responses. First, it is clear
that CSRR model receives the best evaluation on
three aspects, which proves the effectiveness of
CSRR on generating high quality responses. Sec-
ond, because of the existence of discourse-level
and pair-level latent variables, responses are more
coherent. Since these two kinds of variables learn
high level semantic information, utterance-level
ones serve better on expression diversion, also im-
prove sentence fluency and informativeness.

3.5 Case Study and Ablation Study
Table 3 shows the examples generated by CSRR
model and other baseline models. For some

Example 1:
Context: how’s sleeping beauty? 7→ still sleeping. 7→
kiss him, maybe he’ll turn into a frog.
HRED: he’s a good man.
VHRED+w.d: what?
VHCR+u.d: maybe he’s dead.
CSRR: Really? I won’t try.
Example 2:
Context: tried installing the driver from nvidia, but funny
thing is i’ve installed 7→ what is the problem you are hav-
ing exactly 7→ at this point driver activated but not in use
HRED: what card do you have?
VHRED+w.d: are you using the nvidia driver? or from
the command line?
VHCR+u.d: i have no idea what you are talking about, i
just know that
CSRR: you need to install the nvidia driver from the
nvidia site.
Example 3:
Context: hi wondering whether to use 32 or 64 bit 7→
how much ram does the pc have? more than 2 gb you
might 7→ definitely? because, i’ ve heard that ubuntu rec-
ommends 32 bit and
HRED: it’s a bit more than a 32 bit version of a 32bit
system.
VHRED+w.d: i have no idea , but it doesn’t matter.
VHCR+u.d: i don’t know, but i haven’t used it much.
CSRR: yes, but you can use 64 bit or 32 bit.
Example 4:
Context: how can i narrow down an issue i’m having? i
am running 7→ check out the system logs in var logs ... in
particular kern.log, syslog 7→ thank you very much.
HRED: no problem.
VHRED+w.d: i’m glad to hear that, don’t know why.
VHCR+u.d: i’m not sure what you mean by ‘ <unk> ’.
CSRR: you’re welcome. i don’t know if that’s the case.

Table 3: Examples generated by CSRR model and
other baselines. The first example is from Cornell
Movie Dialog, while the bottom three rows are from
Ubuntu Dialog.

easy questions, like greeting (Example 4), both
HRED and CSRR perform well. In contrast,
VHRED+w.d and VHCR+u.d tend to generate
general and meaningless responses. For hard
questions, like some technical ones (Example 1
to 3), the proposed CSRR obviously outperforms
other baselines. Note that VHCR is to show the
effectiveness of zc and it can also be considered
as the ablation study of CSRR to illustrate the va-
lidity of zp. From above cases, we empirically
find that with the help of zp, response generated
by CSRR are not only relevant and consistent to
context, but also informative and meaningful.

4 Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we propose a Conversational Seman-
tic Relationship RNN model to learn the semantic
dependency in multi-turn conversations. We ap-

ply hierarchical strategy to obtain context infor-
mation, and add three-hierarchy latent variables to
capture semantic relationship. According to auto-
matic evaluation and human evaluation, our model
significantly improves the quality of generated re-
sponses, especially in coherence, sentence fluency
and language diversity.

In the future, we will model the semantic rela-
tionship in previous turns, and also import rein-
forcement learning to control the process of topic
changes.
