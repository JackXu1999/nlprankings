Abstract

A large amount of recent research has
focused on tasks that combine language
and vision, resulting in a proliferation of
datasets and methods. One such task
is action recognition, whose applications
include image annotation, scene under-
standing and image retrieval. In this
survey, we categorize the existing ap-
proaches based on how they conceptualize
this problem and provide a detailed review
of existing datasets, highlighting their di-
versity as well as advantages and disad-
vantages. We focus on recently devel-
oped datasets which link visual informa-
tion with linguistic resources and provide
a fine-grained syntactic and semantic anal-
ysis of actions in images.

1 Introduction

Action recognition is the task of identifying the
action being depicted in a video or still image.
The task is useful for a range of applications such
as generating descriptions, image/video retrieval,
surveillance, and human–computer interaction. It
has been widely studied in computer vision, of-
ten on videos (Nagel, 1994; Forsyth et al., 2005),
where motion and temporal information provide
cues for recognizing actions (Taylor et al., 2010).
However, many actions are recognizable from still
images, see the examples in Figure 1. Due to the
absence of motion cues and temporal features (Ik-
izler et al., 2008) action recognition from stills is
more challenging. Most of the existing work can
be categorized into four tasks: (a) action classi-
fication (AC); (b) determining human–object in-
teraction (HOI); (c) visual verb sense disambigua-
tion (VSD); and (d) visual semantic role labeling
(VSRL). In Figure 2 we illustrate each of these

tasks and show how they are related to each other.
Until recently, action recognition was studied as

action classification on small-scale datasets with a
limited number of predefined actions labels (Iki-
zler et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2009; Yao and Fei-
Fei, 2010; Everingham et al., 2010; Yao et al.,
2011). Often the labels in action classification
tasks are verb phrases or a combination of verb
and object such as playing baseball, riding horse.
These datasets have helped in building models and
understanding which aspects of an image are im-
portant for classifying actions, but most methods
are not scalable to larger numbers of actions (Ra-
manathan et al., 2015). Action classification mod-
els are trained on images annotated with mutually
exclusive labels, i.e., the assumption is that only
a single label is relevant for a given image. This
ignores the fact that actions such as holding bicy-
cle and riding bicycle can co-occur in the same
image. To address these issues and also to under-
stand the range of possible interactions between
humans and objects, the human–object interaction
(HOI) detection task has been proposed, in which
all possible interactions between a human and a
given object have to be identified (Le et al., 2014;
Chao et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016).

However, both action classification and HOI de-
tection do not consider the ambiguity that arises
when verbs are used as labels, e.g., the verb play
has multiple meanings in different contexts. On
the other hand, action labels consisting of verb-
object pairs can miss important generalizations:

riding horse and riding elephant both instanti-
ate the same verb semantics, i.e., riding animal.
Thirdly, existing action labels miss generaliza-
tions across verbs, e.g., the fact that fixing bike
and repairing bike are semantically equivalent, in
spite of the use of different verbs. These observa-
tions have led authors to argue that actions should
be analyzed at the level of verb senses. Gella
et al. (2016) propose the new task of visual verb
sense disambiguation (VSD), in which a verb–
image pair is annotated with a verb sense taken
from an existing lexical database (OntoNotes in
this case). While VSD handles distinction be-
tween different verb senses, it does not identify or
localize the objects that participate in the action
denoted by the verb. Recent work (Gupta and Ma-
lik, 2015; Yatskar et al., 2016) has filled this gap
by proposing the task of visual semantic role la-
beling (VSRL), in which images are labeled with
verb frames, and the objects that fill the semantic
roles of the frame are identified in the image.

In this paper, we provide a unified view of ac-
tion recognition tasks, pointing out their strengths
and weaknesses. We survey existing literature and
provide insights into existing datasets and models
for action recognition tasks.

2 Datasets for Action Recognition

We give an overview of commonly used datasets
for action recognition tasks in Table 1 and group
them according to subtask. We observe that the
number of verbs covered in these datasets is often
smaller than the number of action labels reported
(see Table 1, columns #V and #L) and in many
cases the action label involves object reference. A
few of the first action recognition datasets such
as the Ikizler and Willow datasets (Ikizler et al.,

2008; Delaitre et al., 2010) had action labels such
as throwing and running; they were taken from
the sports domain and exhibited diversity in cam-
era view point, background and resolution. Then
datasets were created to capture variation in hu-
man poses in the sports domain for actions such
as tennis serve and cricket bowling; typically fea-
tures based on poses and body parts were used to
build models (Gupta et al., 2009). Further datasets
were created based on the intuition that object
information helps in modeling action recognition
(Li and Fei-Fei, 2007; Ikizler-Cinbis and Sclaroff,
2010), which resulted in the use of action labels
such as riding horse or riding bike (Everingham
et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011). Not only were most
of these datasets domain specific, but the labels
were also manually selected and mutually exclu-
sive, i.e., two actions cannot co-occur in the same
image. Also, most of these datasets do not localize
objects or identify their semantic roles.

2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses

The limitations with early datasets (small scale,
domain specificity, and the use of ad-hoc labels
that combine verb and object) have been recently
addressed in a number of broad-coverage datasets
that offer linguistically motivated labels. Of-
ten these datasets use existing linguistic resources
such as VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), OntoNotes
(Hovy et al., 2006) and FrameNet (Baker et al.,
1998) to classify verbs and their senses. This al-
lows for a more general, semantically motivated
treatment of verbs and verb phrases, and also takes
into account that not all verbs are depictable. For
example, abstract verbs such as presuming and ac-
quiring are not depictable at all, while other verbs
have both depictable and non-depictable senses:
play is non-depictable in playing with emotions,
but depictable in playing instrument and play-
ing sport. The process of identifying depictable
verbs or verb senses is used by Ronchi and Perona
(2015), Gella et al. (2016) and Yatskar et al. (2016)
to identify visual verbs, visual verb senses, and the
semantic roles of the participating objects respec-
tively. In all the cases the process of identifying
visual verbs or senses is carried out by human an-
notators via crowd-sourcing platforms. Visualness
labels for 935 OntoNotes verb senses correspond-
ing to 154 verbs is provided by Gella et al. (2016),
while Yatskar et al. (2016) provides visualness la-
bels for 9683 FrameNet verbs.

2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification
Over the last few years tasks that combine lan-
guage and vision such as image description and
visual question answering have gained much at-
tention. This has led to the creation of new, large
datasets such as MSCOCO (Chen et al., 2015) and
the VQA dataset (Antol et al., 2015). Although
these datasets are not created for action recogni-
tion, a number of attempts have been made to use
the verbs present in image descriptions to annotate
actions. The COCO-a, VerSe and VCOCO-SRL
datasets all use the MSCOCO image descriptions
to annotate fine-grained aspects of interaction and
semantic roles.

HICO: The HICO dataset has 47.8k images an-
notated with 600 categories of human-object in-
teractions with 111 verbs applying to 80 object
categories of MSCOCO. It is annotated to include
diverse interactions for objects and has an aver-
age of 6.5 distinct interactions per object category.
Unlike other HOI datasets such as TUHOI which
label interactions as verbs and ignore senses, the
HOI categories of HICO are based on WordNet
(Miller, 1995) verb senses. The HICO dataset also
has multiple annotations per object and it incorpo-
rates the information that certain interactions such
as riding a bike and holding a bike often co-occur.
However, it fails to include annotations to distin-
guish between multiple senses of a verb.

Visual Genome: The dataset created by Krishna
et al. (2016) has dense annotations of objects, at-

tributes, and relationships between objects. The
Visual Genome dataset contains 105k images with
40k unique relationships between objects. Unlike
other HOI datasets such as HICO, visual genome
relationships also include prepositions, compara-
tive and prepositional phrases such as near and
taller than, making the visual relationship task
more generic than action recognition. Krishna
et al. (2016) combine all the annotations of ob-
jects, relationships, and attributes into directed
graphs known as scene graphs.

COCO-a: Ronchi and Perona (2015) present
Visual VerbNet (VVN), a list of 140 common vi-
sual verbs manually mined from English VerbNet
(Schuler, 2005). The coverage of visual verbs
in this dataset is not complete, as many visual
verbs such as dive, perform and shoot are not in-
cluded. This also highlights a bias in this dataset
as the authors relied on occurrence in MSCOCO
as a verification step to consider a verb as vi-
sual. They annotated 10k images containing hu-
man subjects with one of the 140 visual verbs, for
80 MSCOCO objects. This dataset has better cov-
erage of human-object interactions than the HICO
dataset despite of missing many visual verbs.

VerSe: Gella et al. (2016) created a dataset of
3.5k images sampled from the MSCOCO and
TUHOI datasets and annotated it with 90 verbs
and their OntoNotes senses to distinguish differ-
ent verb senses using visual context. This is the
first dataset that aims to annotate all visual senses

66



of a verb. However, the total number of images
annotated and number of images for some senses
is relatively small, which makes it difficult to use
this dataset to train models. The authors further
divided their 90 verbs into motion and non-motion
verbs according to Levin (1993) verb classes and
analyzed visual ambiguity in the task of visual
sense disambiguation.

VCOCO-SRL: Gupta and Malik (2015) anno-
tated a dataset of 16k person instances in 10k im-
ages with 26 verbs and associated objects in the
scene with the semantic roles for each action. The
main aim of the dataset is to build models for vi-
sual semantic role labeling in images. This task
involves identifying the actions depicted in an im-
age, along with the people and objects that in-
stantiate the semantic roles of the actions. In the
VCOCO-SRL dataset, each person instance is an-
notated with a mean of 2.8 actions simultaneously.

imSitu: Yatskar et al. (2016) annotated a large
dataset of 125k images with 504 verbs, 1.7k se-
mantic roles and 11k objects. They used FrameNet
verbs, frames and associated objects or scenes
with roles to develop the dataset. They annotate
every image with a single verb and the semantic
roles of the objects present in the image. VCOCO-
SRL the is dataset most similar to imSitu, however
VCOCO-SRL includes localization information of
agents and all objects and provides multiple action
annotations per image. On the other hand, imSitu
is the dataset that covers highest number of verbs,
while also omitting many commonly studied poly-
semous verbs such as play.

2.3 Diversity in Datasets
With the exception of a few datasets such as
COCO-a, VerSe, imSitu all action recognition
datasets have manually picked labels or focus
on covering actions in specific domains such as
sports. Alternatively, many datasets only cover
actions relevant to specific object categories such
as musical instruments, animals and vehicles. In
the real world, people interact with many more
objects and perform actions relevant to a wide
range of domains such as personal care, house-
hold activities, or socializing. This limits the di-
versity and coverage of existing action recogni-
tion datasets. Recently proposed datasets partly
handle this issue by using generic linguistic re-
sources to extend the vocabulary of verbs in ac-
tion labels. The diversity issue has also been high-

lighted and addressed in recent video action recog-
nition datasets (Caba Heilbron et al., 2015; Sig-
urdsson et al., 2016), which include generic house-
hold activities. An analysis of various image de-
scription and question answering datasets by Fer-
raro et al. (2015) shows the bias in the distribution
of word categories. Image description datasets
have a higher distribution of nouns compared to
other word categories, indicating that the descrip-
tions are object specific, limiting their usefulness
for action-based tasks.

3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks

Template based description generation systems
for both videos and images rely on identifying
subject–verb–object triples and use language mod-
eling to generate or rank descriptions (Yang et al.,
2011; Thomason et al., 2014; Bernardi et al.,
2016). Understanding actions also plays an impor-
tant role in question answering, especially when
the question is pertaining to an action depicted in
the image. There are some specifically curated
question answering datasets which target human
activities or relationships between a pair of objects
(Yu et al., 2015). Mallya and Lazebnik (2016)
have shown that systems trained on action recog-
nition datasets could be used to improve the ac-
curacy of visual question answering systems that
handle questions related to human activity and
human–object relationships. Action recognition
datasets could be used to learn actions that are vi-
sually similar such as interacting with panda and
feeding a panda or tickling a baby and calming
a baby, which cannot be learned from text alone
(Ramanathan et al., 2015). Visual semantic role
labeling is a crucial step for grounding actions in
the physical world (Yang et al., 2016).

4 Action Recognition Models

Most of the models proposed for action classifi-
cation and human–object interaction tasks rely on
identifying higher-level visual cues present in the
image, including human bodies or body parts (Ik-
izler et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2009; Yao et al.,
2011; Andriluka et al., 2014), objects (Gupta et al.,
2009), and scenes (Li and Fei-Fei, 2007). Higher-
level visual cues are obtained through low-level
features extracted from the image such as Scale In-
variant Feature Transforms (SIFT), Histogram of
Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Spatial Envelopes
(Gist) features (Lowe, 1999; Dalal and Triggs,

67



2005). These are useful in identifying key points,
detecting humans, and scene or background infor-
mation in images, respectively. In addition to iden-
tifying humans and objects, the relative position
or angle between a human and an object is useful
in learning human–object interactions (Le et al.,
2014). Most of the existing approaches rely on
learning supervised classifiers over low-level fea-
tures to predict action labels.

More recent approaches are based on end-to-
end convolutional neural network architectures
which learn visual cues such as objects and im-
age features for action recognition (Chao et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2016; Mallya and Lazebnik,
2016). While most of the action classification
models rely solely on visual information, mod-
els proposed for human–object interaction or vi-
sual relationship detection sometimes combine hu-
man and object identification (using visual fea-
tures) with linguistic knowledge (Le et al., 2014;
Krishna et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2016). Other work
on identifying actions, especially methods that fo-
cus on relationships that are infrequent or unseen,
utilize word vectors learned on large text corpora
as an additional source of information (Lu et al.,
2016). Similarly, Gella et al. (2016) show that em-
beddings generated from textual data associated
with images (object labels, image descriptions) is
useful for visual verb sense disambiguation, and is
complementary to visual information.

5 Discussion

Linguistic resources such as WordNet, OntoNotes,
and FrameNet play a key role in textual sense
disambiguation and semantic role labeling. The
visual action disambiguation and visual semantic
role labeling tasks are extensions of their textual
counterparts, where context is provided as an im-
age instead of as text. Linguistic resources there-
fore have to play a key role if we are to make
rapid progress in these language and vision tasks.
However, as we have shown in this paper, only a
few of the existing datasets for action recognition
and related tasks are based on linguistic resources
(Chao et al., 2015; Gella et al., 2016; Yatskar et al.,
2016). This is despite the fact that the WordNet
noun hierarchy (for example) has played an impor-
tant role in recent progress in object recognition,
by virtue of underlying the ImageNet database, the
de-facto standard for this task (Russakovsky et al.,
2015). The success of ImageNet for objects has

in turn helped NLP tasks such as bilingual lexi-
con induction (Vulić et al., 2016). In our view,
language and vision datasets that are based on the
WordNet, OntoNotes, or FrameNet verb sense in-
ventories can play a similar role for tasks such as
action recognition or visual semantic role labeling,
and ultimately be useful also for more distantly re-
lated tasks such as language grounding.

Another argument for linking language and vi-
sion datasets with linguistic resources is that this
enables us to deploy the datasets in a multilingual
setting. For example a polysemous verb such as
ride in English has multiple translations in Ger-
man and Spanish, depending on the context and
the objects involved. Riding a horse is trans-
lated as reiten in German and cabalgar in Span-
ish, whereas riding a bicycle is translated as fahren
in German and pedalear in Spanish. In contrast,
some polysemous verb (e.g., English play) are
always translated as the same verb, independent
of sense (spielen in German). Such sense map-
pings are discoverable from multilingual lexical
resources (e.g., BabelNet, Navigli and Ponzetto
2010), which makes it possible to construct lan-
guage and vision models that are applicable to
multiple languages. This opportunity is lost if lan-
guage and vision dataset are constructed in isola-
tion, instead of using existing linguistic resources.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have shown the evolution of
action recognition datasets and tasks from sim-
ple ad-hoc labels to the fine-grained annotation
of verb semantics. It is encouraging to see the
recent increase in datasets that deal with sense
ambiguity and annotate semantic roles, while us-
ing standard linguistic resources. One major re-
maining issue with existing datasets is their lim-
ited coverage, and the skewed distribution of verbs
or verb senses. Another challenge is the incon-
sistency in annotation schemes and task defini-
tions across datasets. For example Chao et al.
(2015) used WordNet senses as interaction labels,
while Gella et al. (2016) used the more coarse-
grained OntoNotes senses. Yatskar et al. (2016)
used FrameNet frames for semantic role annota-
tion, while Gupta and Malik (2015) used manually
curated roles. If we are to develop robust, domain
independent models, then we need to standardize
annotation schemes and use the same linguistic re-
sources across datasets.
