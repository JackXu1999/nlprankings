Abstract

This paper proposes an elaboration of
the Generative Lexicon (GL) in Puste-
jovsky (1995) based on a survey of BC-
CWJ (2009). I manually classified the
Japanese NP1-no NP2 “NP1’s NP2” con-
struction in accordance with semantic re-
lations between the two nominals. The re-
sult indicates the need for the expansion of
GL for computing the meaning of the NP1-
no NP2 construction by incorporating ref-
erential module, as I call, that predicates
temporary location, time, and manner of
the referent. For example, in ima-no nihon
“the present Japan,” ima-no modifies the
time of the event argument in the referen-
tial module.

1 Generative Lexicon Theory

Generative Lexicon (GL) is a theory proposed in
Pustejovsky (1995). GL reduces lexical ambigu-
ity and avoids multiple lexical entries by allowing
semantic type-shifts based on the detailed lexical
information. For example, instead of considering
book as lexically ambiguous, the Qualia Structure
enables semantic type-shifting of book; this pro-
vides means for solving a type-mismatch between
finish and a book in (1b).

(1) a. Sue finished reading a book.

b. Sue finished a book.

Most likely, the meanings of (1a) and (1b) are
alike; (1a) expresses the action more explicitly
than (1b), that is, Sue finished reading a book ac-
cording to a highly probable reading. The correct
interpretation of (1b) that Sue finished reading a
book, rather than swallowing a book or something
else, is obtained by means of the lexical knowl-
edge that books are made to be read—the purpose

or the telic role of the book is to have its readers.
The reading activity contains an event argument
inside and the agent of the event argument is real-
ized as the sentential subject Sue.

Such “purpose” or TELIC role is encoded in the
lexical knowledge in GL (Pustejovsky 1995). Ac-
cording to Pustejovsky who based his theory on
Moravcsik (1975), the following four qualia that
originate from Aristotle’s concept of matters rep-
resent four inherent properties of the referent.

(2) CONSTITUTIVE part-whole relation, ma-
terial, weight

FORMAL orientation, magnitude, shape,
dimensionality, color, position, ontolog-
ical category

TELIC purpose, function

AGENTIVE origin, creator, artifact, natural
kind, causal chain

2 Problems with Deriving Possessive
Relations

In formal semantics, Pustevjosky’s qualia struc-
ture has been applied for deriving possessive re-
lations by means of the type-shifting mechanism.
Vikner and Jensen (2002) type-shift the possessor
noun using one of the qualia roles to explain the
meaning of the genitive phrases following Partee
(1997).

Possessive relations are ambiguous in both
English and Japanese. For example, there is
more than one interpretation for Tanaka-no hon
“Tanaka’s book.” Tanaka’s book may refer to the
book that Tanaka owns or the book that Tanaka
wrote (Barker 1995, 87).

In view of such ambiguity, Langacker (1993)
considers ownership to be the prototypical mean-
ing of the possessive construction and other rela-
tions to be the instantiations. Partee (1997) as-
sumes two syntactic types for John’s depending on



2
whether or not the following noun is inherently re-
lational.

According to Partee, if the following noun is
a non-relational common noun (CN) such as car,
John’s composes with car which is a regular (e, t)
type predicate, namely, a function from individu-
als to truth-values (Montague 1973), and the rela-
tion between John and car is contextually supplied
as shown in (3a).

On the contrary, when John is followed by in-
herently relational nouns such as brother, em-
ployee, and enemy, which are (e, (e, t)) type with
an extra argument slot (a function from individu-
als to another function from individuals to truth-
values), the relation between John and his brother
in John’s brother inherits kinship from the two-
place predicate brother in (3b). (4) exemplifies
the computation related to another relational noun,
friend.

(3) a. Free R type:

Syntax: [John’s]NP/CN

Semantics: λQλP[NP’(λz [∃x[∀y[[Q(y)
∧ R(y)(z)] ↔ y = x] ∧ P(x)]])]

b. Inherent relation type: inherited from re-
lational nouns:

Syntax: [John’s]NP/TCN (TCN: transi-
tive common noun)

Semantics: λRλP[NP’(λz [∃x[∀y[R(z)(y)
↔ y = x] ∧ P(x)]])]

(4) Syntax: [[John’s]NP/TCN [friend]TCN ]NP
Semantics: λRλP[John’(λz.∃x[∀y[R(z)(y)
↔ y = x] ∧ P(x)]](friend-of’)
= λP[John’s(λz.∃x[∀y[friend-of’(z)(y) ↔ y
= x] ∧ P(x)]]

If we apply Partee’s theory to Japanese exam-
ples, most of the possessive relations are unpre-
dictable, and there is no way to disambiguate the
contextually supplied relation R.

Vikner and Jensen (2002) apply the qualia struc-
ture of the possessee noun and type-shift the pos-
sessee noun into a relational noun. For example,
John’s poem, that is, a possessive + CN, can be
interpreted as the poem that John composed be-
cause the internal semantic structure of poem con-
tains an author-of relation, which is the agentive
role. According to Vikner and Jensen (2002), the
meaning-shifting operator QA raises a one-place

holder poem in (5a) into a two-place holder as in
(5b). The type-shifted poem can now combine
with the possessive NP, which has a uniform type
((e, (e, t)), ((e, t), t)), so that the authorship rela-
tion is inherited from NP poem, and R is no longer
a free variable.

(5) a. [[poem]] = λx.[poem’(x)]

b. QA(poem) = λxλy[poem’(x) ∧ com-
pose’(x)(y)]

Similarly, the girl’s teacher can be explained by
their mechanism. The purpose of teachers is to
teach; therefore, the TELIC role of teachers is to
teach someone. Now, the telic quale in the qualia
structure of teacher raises the semantic type of a
common noun teacher into the one of a relational
noun as given in (6). Teacher is always someone’s
teacher so that teacher is a function from individ-
uals to another function from individuals to truth-
values.

(6) a. [[teacher]] = λx.teacher’(x)

b. QT (teacher) = λxλy[teacher’(x) ∧
teach’(y)(x)]

Such a mechanism has dramatically reduced the
ambiguity of possessive relations.

3 Limit to GL

Table 1 manually classifies the 3030 examples
containing the NP1-no NP2 “NP1-GEN NP2” con-
struction in Japanese, such as Fuji-no rendora “a
soap opera by Fuji TV,” according to the seman-
tic relations between the two noun phrases. The
examples were sorted out of the core data of the
Yahoo! Chiebukuro portion of BCCWJ (2009) by
using ChaKi.NET 1.2β.

The survey indicates that the qualia structure
plays an important role in disambiguating the
meaning of the genitive marker no in Japanese.
29% of all instances are examples that NP1 selec-
tively binds, or modifies the qualia structure of the
lexical meaning of the NP2. For example, Fuji-
no rendora “a soap opera by Fuji TV” is a soap
opera created by Fuji TV, i.e., the agentive relation
between the Fuji TV and a soap opera substitutes
the relation between the two. In windows-no CM
“TV commercial for the Windows,” the CM is for
the Windows; therefore, the meaning of no inher-
its the telic role of CM. In Gandamu-no kao “the

Crucially, the survey demonstrated that the GL
needs to be expanded to include not only inher-
ent properties but also referential descriptions, be-
cause 8% of the data involved the modification
of the temporary elements, such as location, time,
and manner of the referent of NP2 (e.g., Operaza-
no Kaijin “Phantom of the Opera”, that is, Phan-
tom in the Opera) (Nishiguchi 2012) . As the re-
lation between the Phantom and the Opera does
not involve any of the inherent qualia structure—
Phantom of the Opera was not born in the Opera
(agentive), the Phantom is not made for the Opera
(telic), the Phantom is not any part of the Opera
(constitutive), or does not form any shape of the
Opera (formal), none of the relations among the
qualia structure Pustejovsky (1995) cannot substi-
tute for the relation between the two.

4 Extended GL

Even though Pustejovsky’s four qualia express in-
herent properties of referents, I propose supple-
menting lexical semantics with information about
the referents. Besides type, argument, event, and

qualia structures in GL (cf. Johnston and Busa
1996, 79), the referential module (REF) has sub-
categories of TIME, LOC, and MANNER roles.

For example, Operaza-no “of the Opera” in
operaza-no kaijin “the Phantom of the Opera” in
(10a) and mayonaka-no “midnight” in mayonaka-
no kaigan “the midnight beach/the beach in mid-
night” in (11a) modify referential modules of the
Phantom and the beach. In baiku-no karera “those



4
on scooters” in (12a), scooter-riding is one of the
temporary properties of the referents, so that it is
MANNER role modification.

As a result, selective binding not only applies
to qualia structure but also to a referential mod-
ule, which enables the computation of the mean-
ing of the NP1-no NP2 construction. For example,
Operaza-no “of the Opera” specifies the location
of the Phantom as the Opera, mayonaka-no “mid-
night” modifies time and baiku-no “on scooters”
fills the manner role as shown in (10b), (11b) and
(12b).

(10) a. Operaza-no kaijin
The Opera-GEN phantom
“The Phantom of the Opera

b. [[The Phantom of the Opera]] =
λx[phantom(x) ∧ [REF = ∃e[be-
phantom(e) & theme(e) = x ∧
location(e) = The Opera]]]

(11) a. Mayonaka-no
midnight-GEN

kaigan-e
beach-GOAL

it-te
go-and

sakende-kudasai.

“Go to beach during midnight and
shout there.”

(BCCWJ 2011, oc 104343)

b. [[midnight beach]] = λx[beach(x) &
[REF = ∃e[be-beach(e) ∧ theme(e) = x
∧ time(e) = midnight]]]

(12) a. Baiku-no
scooter-GEN

karera-mo
they-also

kekkona
high

ritsu-de
freuency-by

te-o
hand-ACC

agete-kure-ta
raise-BENEF-PAST

“Those on scooters also raised their
hands often.”

(BCCWJ 2011, oc 56711)

b. [[those on scooters]]g =λx[g(1) = x
& [REF = ∃e[born(e) & manner(e) =
with-scooter]]]

(13) a. kinjo-no
neighborhood-GEN

seikeigeka-ni-wa
orthopidics-DAT-TOP

iki-mashi-ta
go-HON-PAST

“I visited the orthopedics in neighbor-
hood.”

(BCCWJ 2011, oc 97196)

b. [[neighborhood − GEN orthopedics]]
= λx[orthopedics(x) ∧ [REF =
∃e[location(e) = neighborhood ∧
theme(e) = x]]]

Kinjo-no “in the neighborhood” in (13a) and
mayonaka-no “midnight” in (11a) represent the
temporary location and time of the referents
of seikeigeka “orthopedic clinic” and kaigan
“beach.”

Therefore, I propose the addition of a referen-
tial module to the lexical meaning in GL, for in-
corporating temporary location, time, manner and
others of referents, in addition to the qualia struc-
ture. The possessive or genitive phrases NP1-no in
these examples modify the referential modules of
NP2 which cannot be captured within the frame-
work of the already existing GL.

5 EGL Database

I have made a small database of fifty lexical items
taken from BCCWJ (2009) in the format of the
Extended GL.

6 Conclusion

A quantitative survey of the meaning of the NP1-
no NP2 construction in Japanese revealed the need
for the expansion of the GL for the computation of
the meaning, although many examples were of the
qualia structure modification in GL.
