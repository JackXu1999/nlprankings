Highly frequent in language and communication, metaphor represents a significant challenge
for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Computational work on metaphor has
traditionally evolved around the use of hand-coded knowledge, making the systems hard to scale.
Recent years have witnessed a rise in statistical approaches to metaphor processing. How-
ever, these approaches often require extensive human annotation effort and are predominantly
evaluated within a limited domain. In contrast, we experiment with weakly supervised and
unsupervised techniques—with little or no annotation—to generalize higher-level mechanisms
of metaphor from distributional properties of concepts. We investigate different levels and types
of supervision (learning from linguistic examples vs. learning from a given set of metaphorical
mappings vs. learning without annotation) in flat and hierarchical, unconstrained and con-
strained clustering settings. Our aim is to identify the optimal type of supervision for a learning
algorithm that discovers patterns of metaphorical association from text. In order to investigate

the scalability and adaptability of our models, we applied them to data in three languages from
different language groups—English, Spanish, and Russian—achieving state-of-the-art results
with little supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that statistical methods can facilitate and scale
up cross-linguistic research on metaphor.

1. Introduction

Metaphor brings vividness, distinction, and clarity to our thought and communica-
tion. At the same time, it plays an important structural role in our cognition, helping
us to organize and project knowledge (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Feldman 2006) and
guide our reasoning (Thibodeau and Boroditsky 2011). Metaphors arise from system-
atic associations between distinct, and seemingly unrelated, concepts. For instance,
when we talk about “the turning wheels of a political regime,” “rebuilding the campaign
machinery” or “mending foreign policy,” we view politics and political systems in terms of
mechanisms—they can function, break, be mended, have wheels, and so forth. The existence
of this association allows us to transfer knowledge and inferences from the domain of
mechanisms to that of political systems. As a result, we reason about political systems in
terms of mechanisms and discuss them using the mechanism terminology in a variety of
metaphorical expressions. The view of metaphor as a mapping between two distinct
domains was echoed by numerous theories in the field (Black 1962; Hesse 1966; Lakoff
and Johnson 1980; Gentner 1983). The most influential of these was the Conceptual
Metaphor Theory of Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Lakoff and Johnson claimed that
metaphor is not merely a property of language, but rather a cognitive mechanism
that structures our conceptual system in a certain way. They coined the term concep-
tual metaphor to describe the mapping between the target concept (e.g., politics) and
the source concept (e.g., mechanism), and linguistic metaphor to describe the resulting
metaphorical expressions. Other examples of common metaphorical mappings include:
TIME IS MONEY (e.g., “That flat tire cost me an hour”); IDEAS ARE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
(e.g., “I can not grasp his way of thinking”); VIOLENCE IS FIRE (e.g., “violence flares
amid curfew”); EMOTIONS ARE VEHICLES (e.g., “[...] she was transported with pleasure”);
FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS (e.g., “[...] all of this stirred an unfathomable excitement in her”);
LIFE IS A JOURNEY (e.g., “He arrived at the end of his life with very little emotional
baggage”).

Manifestations of metaphor are pervasive in language and reasoning, making its
computational processing an imperative task within Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Explaining up to 20% of all word meanings according to corpus studies (Shutova
and Teufel 2010; Steen et al. 2010), metaphor is currently a bottleneck, particularly in
semantic tasks. An accurate and scalable metaphor processing system would become an
important component of many practical NLP applications. These include, for instance,
machine translation (MT): A large number of metaphorical expressions are culture-
specific and therefore represent a considerable challenge in translation (Schäffner 2004;
Zhou, Yang, and Huang 2007). Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen (2013) conducted a
study of metaphor translation in MT. Using Google Translate,1 a state-of-the-art MT
system, they found that as many as 44% of metaphorical expressions in their data set
were translated incorrectly, resulting in semantically infelicitous sentences. A metaphor

processing component could help to avoid such errors. Other applications of metaphor
processing include, for instance, opinion mining: metaphorical expressions tend to
contain a strong emotional component (e.g., compare the metaphor “Government loos-
ened its stranglehold on business” and its literal counterpart “Government deregulated
business” [Narayanan 1999]); or information retrieval: non-literal language without
appropriate disambiguation may lead to false positives in information retrieval (e.g.,
documents describing “old school gentlemen” should not be returned for the query
“school” [Korkontzelos et al. 2013]); and many others.

Because the metaphors we use are also known to be indicative of our under-
lying viewpoints, metaphor processing is likely to be fruitful in determining political
affiliation from text or pinning down cross-cultural and cross-population differences,
and thus become a useful tool in data mining. In social science, metaphor is exten-
sively studied as a way to frame cultural and moral models, and to predict social
choice (Landau, Sullivan, and Greenberg 2009; Thibodeau and Boroditsky 2011; Lakoff
and Wehling 2012). Metaphor is also widely viewed as a creative tool. Its knowl-
edge projection mechanisms help us to grasp new concepts and generate innovative
ideas. This opens many avenues for the creation of computational tools that foster
creativity (Veale 2011, 2014) and support assessment in education (Burstein et al.
2013).

For many years, computational work on metaphor evolved around the use
of hand-coded knowledge and rules to model metaphorical associations, making
the systems hard to scale. Recent years have seen a growing interest in statistical
modeling of metaphor (Mason 2004; Gedigian et al. 2006; Shutova 2010; Shutova,
Sun, and Korhonen 2010; Turney et al. 2011; Heintz et al. 2013; Hovy et al. 2013;
Li, Zhu, and Wang 2013; Mohler et al. 2013; Shutova and Sun 2013; Strzalkowski
et al. 2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman 2013; Beigman Klebanov et al.
2014; Mohler et al. 2014), with many new techniques opening routes for improving
system accuracy and robustness. A wide range of methods have been proposed
and investigated by the community, including supervised classification (Gedigian
et al. 2006; Dunn 2013a; Hovy et al. 2013; Mohler et al. 2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel,
and Gershman 2013), unsupervised learning (Heintz et al. 2013; Shutova and
Sun 2013), distributional approaches (Shutova 2010; Shutova, Van de Cruys,
and Korhonen 2012; Shutova 2013; Mohler et al. 2014), lexical resource-based methods
(Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007; Wilks et al. 2013), psycholinguistic features (Turney
et al. 2011; Gandy et al. 2013; Neuman et al. 2013; Strzalkowski et al. 2013), and
Web search using lexico-syntactic patterns (Veale and Hao 2008; Bollegala and
Shutova 2013; Li, Zhu, and Wang 2013). However, even the statistical methods have
been predominantly applied in limited-domain, small-scale experiments. This is
mainly due to the lack of general-domain corpora annotated for metaphor that are
sufficiently large for training wide-coverage supervised systems. In addition,
supervised methods tend to rely on lexical resources and ontologies for feature
extraction, which limits the robustness of the features themselves and makes the
methods dependent on the coverage (and the availability) of these resources. This
also makes these methods difficult to port to new languages, for which such lexical
resources or corpora may not exist. In contrast, we experiment with minimally
supervised and unsupervised learning methods that require little or no annotation;
and use robust, dynamically mined lexico-syntactic features that are well suited for
metaphor processing. This makes our methods scalable to new data and portable across
languages, domains, and tasks, bringing metaphor processing technology a step closer
to a possibility of integration with real-world NLP.

Our methods use distributional clustering techniques to investigate how meta-
phorical cross-domain mappings partition the semantic space in three different
languages—English, Russian, and Spanish. In a distributional semantic space, each
word is represented as a vector of contexts in which it occurs in a text corpus.2

Because of the high frequency and systematicity with which metaphor is used in
language, it is naturally and systematically reflected in the distributional space. As
a result of metaphorical cross-domain mappings, the words’ context vectors tend to
be non-homogeneous in structure and to contain vocabulary from different domains.
For instance, the context vector for the noun idea would contain a set of literally used
terms (e.g., understand [an idea]) and a set of metaphorically used terms, describing ideas
as PHYSICAL OBJECTS (e.g., grasp [an idea], throw [an idea]), LIQUIDS (e.g., [ideas] flow),
or FOOD (e.g., digest [an idea]), and so on. Similarly, the context vector for politics would
contain MECHANISM terms (e.g., operate or refuel [politics]), GAME terms (e.g., play or
dominate [politics]), SPACE terms (e.g., enter or leave [politics]), as well as the literally used
terms (e.g., explain or understand [politics]), as shown in Figure 1. This demonstrates
how metaphorical usages, abundant in the data, structure the distributional space. As
a result, the context vectors of different concepts contain a certain degree of cross-
domain overlap, thus implicitly encoding cross-domain mappings. Figure 1 shows such
a term overlap in the direct object vectors for the concepts of GAME and POLITICS. We
exploit such composition of the context vectors to induce information about metaphori-
cal mappings directly from the words’ distributional behavior in an unsupervised or
a minimally supervised way. We then use this information to identify metaphorical
language. Clustering methods model modularity in the structure of the semantic space,
and thus naturally provide a suitable framework to capture metaphorical information.
To our knowledge, the metaphorical cross-domain structure of the distributional space
has not yet been explicitly exploited in wider NLP. Instead, most NLP approaches tend
to treat all types of distributional features as identical, thus possibly losing important
conceptual information that is naturally encoded in the distributional semantic space.

The focus of our experiments is on the identification of metaphorical expressions
in verb–subject and verb–object constructions, where the verb is used metaphorically.
In the first set of experiments, we apply a flat clustering algorithm, spectral clustering
(Ng et al. 2002), to learn metaphorical associations from text. The system clusters
verbs and nouns to create representations of source and target domains. The verb
clustering is used to harvest source domain vocabulary and the noun clustering is used
to identify groups of target concepts associated with the same source. For instance,
the nouns democracy and marriage are clustered together (in the target noun cluster),
because both are metaphorically associated with (for example) mechanisms or games
and, as such, appear with mechanism and game terms in the corpus (the source verb
cluster). The obtained clusters represent source and target concepts between which
metaphorical associations hold. We first experiment with the unconstrained version
of spectral clustering using the method of Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010), where
metaphorical patterns are derived from the distributional information alone and the
clustering process is fully unsupervised. We then extend this method to perform con-
strained clustering, where a small number of example metaphorical mappings are used
to guide the learning process, with the expectation of changing the cluster structure
towards capturing metaphorically associated concepts. We then analyze and compare

2 In our experiments we use a syntax-aware distributional space, where the vectors are constructed using
the words’ grammatical relations.

the structure of the clusters obtained with or without the use of constraints. The learning
of metaphorical associations is then boosted from a small set of example metaphorical
expressions that are used to connect the verb and noun clusters. Finally, the acquired
set of associations is used to identify new, unseen metaphorical expressions in a large
corpus.

Although we believe that these methods would capture a substantial amount of
information about metaphorical associations from distributional properties of concepts,
they are still dependent on the seed expressions to identify new metaphorical language.
In our second set of experiments, we investigate to what extent it is possible to ac-
quire information about metaphor from distributional properties of concepts alone,
without any need for labeled examples. For this purpose, we apply the hierarchical
clustering method of Shutova and Sun (2013) to identify both metaphorical associations
and metaphorical expressions in a fully unsupervised way. We use hierarchical graph
factorization clustering (Yu, Yu, and Tresp 2006) of nouns to create a network (or a
graph) of concepts and to quantify the strength of association between concepts in
this graph. The metaphorical mappings are then identified based on the association
patterns between concepts in the graph. The mappings are represented as cross-level,
one-directional connections between clusters in the graph. The system then uses salient
features of the metaphorically connected clusters to identify metaphorical expressions
in text. Given a source domain, the method outputs a set of target concepts associated
with this source, as well as the corresponding metaphorical expressions.

We then compare the ability of these methods (that require different kinds and
levels of supervision) to identify metaphor. In order to investigate the scalability and
adaptability of the methods, we applied them to unrestricted, general-domain text in
three typologically different languages—English, Spanish, and Russian. We evaluated
the performance of the systems with the aid of human judges in precision- and recall-
oriented settings, achieving state-of-the-art results with little supervision. Finally, we
analyze the differences in the use of metaphor across languages, as discovered by the

systems, and demonstrate that statistical methods can facilitate and scale up cross-
linguistic research on metaphor.

2.1 Metaphor Annotation Studies

Metaphor annotation studies have typically been corpus-based and involved either
continuous annotation of metaphorical language (i.e., distinguishing between literal
and metaphorical uses of words in a given text), or search for instances of a specific
metaphor in a corpus and an analysis thereof. The majority of corpus-linguistic studies
were concerned with metaphorical expressions and mappings within a limited domain,
for example, WAR, BUSINESS, FOOD, or PLANT metaphors (Santa Ana 1999; Izwaini 2003;
Koller 2004; Skorczynska Sznajder and Pique-Angordans 2004; Hardie et al. 2007; Lu
and Ahrens 2008; Low et al. 2010), or in a particular genre or type of discourse, such as
financial (Charteris-Black and Ennis 2001; Martin 2006), political (Lu and Ahrens 2008),
or educational (Cameron 2003; Beigman Klebanov and Flor 2013) discourse.

Two studies (Steen et al. 2010; Shutova and Teufel 2010) moved away from in-
vestigating particular domains to a more general study of how metaphor behaves in
unrestricted continuous text. Steen and colleagues (Pragglejaz Group 2007; Steen et al.
2010) proposed a metaphor identification procedure (MIP), in which every word is
tagged as literal or metaphorical, based on whether it has a “more basic meaning” in
other contexts than the current one. The basic meaning was defined as “more concrete;
related to bodily action; more precise (as opposed to vague); historically older” and
its identification was guided by dictionary definitions. The resulting VU Amsterdam
Metaphor Corpus3 is a 200,000-word subset of the British National Corpus (BNC)
(Burnard 2007) annotated for linguistic metaphor. The corpus has already found ap-
plication in computational metaphor processing research (Dunn 2013b; Niculae and
Yaneva 2013; Beigman Klebanov et al. 2014), as well as inspiring metaphor annotation
efforts in other languages (Badryzlova et al. 2013). Shutova and Teufel (2010) extended
MIP to the identification of conceptual metaphors along with the linguistic ones.
Following MIP, the annotators were asked to identify the more basic sense of the word,
and then label the context in which the word occurs in the basic sense as the source
domain, and the current context as the target. Shutova and Teufel’s corpus is a 13,000-
word subset of the BNC sampling a range of genres, and it has served as a testbed in
a number of computational experiments (Shutova 2010; Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen
2010; Bollegala and Shutova 2013).

Lönneker (2004) investigated metaphor annotation in lexical resources. The result-
ing Hamburg Metaphor Database contains examples of metaphorical expressions in
German and French, which are mapped to senses from EuroWordNet4 and annotated
with source-target domain mappings.

2.2 Computational Approaches to Metaphor Identification

Early computational work on metaphor tended to be theory-driven and utilized
hand-coded descriptions of concepts and domains to identify and interpret metaphor.

Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

The system of Fass (1991), for instance, was an implementation of the selectional
preference violation view of metaphor (Wilks 1978) and detected metaphor and meto-
nymy as a violation of a common preference of a predicate by a given argument.
Another branch of approaches (Martin 1990; Narayanan 1997; Barnden and Lee 2002)
implemented some aspects of the conceptual metaphor theory (Lakoff and Johnson
1980), reasoning over hand-crafted representations of source and target domains. The
system of Martin (1990) explained linguistic metaphors through finding the correspond-
ing metaphorical mapping. The systems of Narayanan (1997) and Barnden and Lee
(2002) performed inferences about entities and events in the source and target domains
in order to interpret a given metaphor. The reasoning processes relied on manually
coded knowledge about the world and operated mainly in the source domain. The
results were then projected onto the target domain using the conceptual mapping
representation.

The reliance on task- and domain-specific hand-coded knowledge makes these
systems difficult to scale to real-world text. Later research thus turned to general-
domain lexical resources and ontologies, as well as statistical methods, in order to
design more scalable solutions. Mason (2004) introduced the use of statistical techniques
for metaphor processing; however, his approach had a considerable reliance on Word-
Net (Fellbaum 1998). His CorMet system discovered source–target domain mappings
automatically, by searching for systematic variations in domain-specific verb prefer-
ences. For example, pour is a characteristic verb in both LAB and FINANCE domains.
In the LAB domain it has a strong preference for liquids and in the FINANCE domain for
money. From this information, Mason’s system inferred the domain mapping FINANCE–
LAB and the concept mapping money–liquid. The system of Krishnakumaran and Zhu
(2007) used hyponymy relations in WordNet and word bigram counts to predict verbal,
nominal, and adjectival metaphors. For instance, given an IS-A construction (e.g., “The
world is a stage”) the system verified that the two nouns were in hyponymy relation
in WordNet, and if this was not the case the expression was tagged as metaphori-
cal. Given a verb–noun or an adjective–noun pair (such as “planting ideas” or “fertile
imagination”), the system computed the bigram probability of this pair (including the
hyponyms/hypernyms of the noun) and if the combination was not observed in the
data with sufficient frequency, it was tagged as metaphorical.

These systems have demonstrated that statistical methods, when combined with
broad-coverage lexical resources, can be successfully used to model at least some as-
pects of metaphor, increasing the system coverage. As statistical NLP, lexical semantics,
and lexical acquisition techniques developed over the years, it has become possible
to build larger-scale statistical metaphor processing systems that promise a step for-
ward both in accuracy and robustness. Numerous approaches (Li and Sporleder 2010;
Shutova 2010; Turney et al. 2011; Hovy et al. 2013; Shutova and Sun 2013; Shutova,
Teufel, and Korhonen 2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman 2013) used machine
learning and statistical techniques to address a wider range of metaphorical language in
general-domain text. For instance, the method of Turney et al. (2011) classified verbs and
adjectives as literal or metaphorical based on their level of concreteness or abstractness
in relation to the noun they appear with. They learned concreteness rankings for words
automatically (starting from a set of examples) and then searched for expressions where
a concrete adjective or verb was used with an abstract noun (e.g., “dark humor” was
tagged as a metaphor and dark hair was not). The method of Turney et al. (2011) has
served as a foundation for the later approaches of Neuman et al. (2013) and Gandy et al.
(2013), who extended it through the use of selectional preferences and the identification
of source domains, respectively.

Another branch of research focused on applying statistical learning to the problem
of metaphor identification (Gedigian et al. 2006; Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen 2010;
Dunn 2013a; Heintz et al. 2013; Hovy et al. 2013; Mohler et al. 2013; Shutova and Sun
2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman 2013; Beigman Klebanov et al. 2014). The
learning techniques they have investigated include supervised classification, clustering,
and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. We review these methods in
more detail subsequently.

2.2.1 Metaphor Identification as Supervised Classification. A number of approaches trained
classifiers on manually annotated data to recognize metaphor (Gedigian et al. 2006;
Dunn 2013a; Hovy et al. 2013; Mohler et al. 2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman
2013; Beigman Klebanov et al. 2014). The method of Gedigian et al. (2006), for instance,
discriminated between literal and metaphorical uses of the verbs of MOTION and CURE
using a maximum entropy classifier. The authors obtained their data by extracting the
lexical items whose frames are related to MOTION and CURE from FrameNet (Fillmore,
Johnson, and Petruck 2003). To construct their training and test sets, they searched
the PropBank Wall Street Journal corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002) for sentences
containing such lexical items and manually annotated them for metaphoricity. They
used PropBank annotation (arguments and their semantic types) as features to train
the classifier and reported an accuracy of 95.12%. This result was, however, only a
little higher than the performance of the naive baseline assigning majority class to all
instances (92.90%).

Dunn (2013a, 2013b) presented an ontology-based domain interaction approach that
identified metaphorical expressions at the utterance level. Dunn’s system first mapped
the lexical items in the given utterance to concepts from SUMO ontology (Niles and
Pease 2001, 2003), assuming that each lexical item was used in its default sense—that
is, no sense disambiguation was performed. The system then extracted the proper-
ties of concepts from the ontology, such as their domain type (ABSTRACT, PHYSICAL,
SOCIAL, MENTAL) and event status (PROCESS, STATE, OBJECT). Those properties were
then combined into feature-vector representations of the utterances. Dunn trained a
logistic regression classifier using these features to perform metaphor identification,
reporting an F-score of 0.58 on general-domain data.

Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman (2013) experimented with metaphor identifica-
tion in English and Russian, first training a classifier on English data only, and then
projecting the trained model to Russian using a dictionary. They abstracted from the
words in English data to their higher-level features, such as concreteness, animate-
ness, named-entity labels, and coarse-grained WordNet categories (corresponding to
WN lexicographer files,5 [e.g., noun.artifact, noun.body, verb.motion, verb.cognition]). The
authors used a logistic regression classifier and a combination of the listed features
to annotate metaphor at the sentence level. The model was trained on the TroFi data
set (Birke and Sarkar 2006) of 1,298 sentences containing literal and metaphorical uses
of 25 verbs. Tsvetkov and colleagues evaluated their method on self-constructed data
sets of 98 sentences for English and 140 sentences for Russian, attaining F-scores of
0.78 and 0.76, respectively. The results are encouraging and show that porting coarse-
grained semantic knowledge across languages is feasible. However, it should be noted
that the generalization to coarse semantic features is likely to focus on shallow proper-
ties of metaphorical language and to bypass conceptual information. Corpus-linguistic

Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

research (Charteris-Black and Ennis 2001; Kovecses 2005; Diaz-Vera and Caballero 2013)
suggests that there is considerable variation in metaphorical language across cultures,
which makes training only on one language and translating the model problematic for
modeling conceptual structure behind metaphor.

The approach of Mohler et al. (2013) relied on the concept of semantic signature of
a text, defined as a set of highly related and interlinked WordNet senses. They induced
domain-sensitive semantic signatures of texts and then trained a set of classifiers to
detect metaphoricity within a text by comparing its semantic signature to a set of known
metaphors. The intuition behind this approach was that the texts whose semantic sig-
nature closely matched the signature of a known metaphor would be likely to contain
an instance of the same conceptual metaphor. Mohler and colleagues conducted their
experiments within a limited domain (the target domain of governance) and manually
constructed an index of known metaphors for this domain. They then automatically
created the target domain signature and a signature for each source domain among
the known metaphors in the index. This was done by means of semantic expansion
of domain terms using WordNet, Wikipedia links, and corpus co-occurrence statistics.
Given an input text their method first identified all target domain terms using the target
domain signature, then disambiguated the remaining terms using sense clustering and
classified them according to their proximity to the source domains listed in the index.
For the latter purpose, the authors experimented with a set of classifiers, including
maximum entropy classifier, unpruned decision tree classifier, support vector machines,
random forest classifier, as well as the combination thereof. They evaluated their system
on a balanced data set containing 241 metaphorical and 241 literal examples, and
obtained the highest F-score of 0.70 using the decision tree classifier.

Hovy et al. (2013) trained a support vector machine classifier (Cortes and Vapnik
1995) with tree kernels (Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili 2006) to capture the compositional
properties of metaphorical language. Their hypothesis was that unusual semantic com-
positions in the data would be indicative of the use of metaphor. The system was trained
on labeled examples of literal and metaphorical uses of 329 words (3,872 sentences in
total), with an expectation to learn the differences in their compositional behavior in
the given lexico-syntactic contexts. The choice of dependency-tree kernels helped to
capture such compositional properties, according to the authors. Hovy et al. used word
vectors, as well as lexical, part-of-speech tags and WordNet supersense representations
of sentence trees as features. They report encouraging results, F-score = 0.75, which is an
indication of the importance of syntactic information and compositionality in metaphor
identification.

The key question that supervised classification poses is, what features are indica-
tive of metaphor and how can one abstract from individual expressions to its high-
level mechanisms? The described approaches experimented with a number of features,
including lexical and syntactic information and higher-level features such as semantic
roles, WordNet supersenses, and domain types extracted from ontologies. The results
that came out of these studies suggest that in order to reliably capture the patterns
of the use of metaphor in the data on a large scale, one needs to address conceptual
properties of metaphor, along with the surface ones. Thus the model would need to
make generalizations at the level of metaphorical mappings and coarse-grained classes
of concepts, in essence representing different domains (such as politics or machines).
Although our intention in this article is to model such domain structure in a minimally
supervised or unsupervised way and to learn it from the data directly, the clusters
produced by our models provide a representation of conceptual domains that could
also be a useful feature within a supervised classification framework.

2.2.2 The Use of Clustering for Metaphor Processing. We first introduced the use of cluster-
ing techniques to learn metaphorical associations in our earlier work (Shutova, Sun, and
Korhonen 2010; Shutova and Sun 2013). The metaphor identification system of Shutova,
Sun, and Korhonen (2010) starts from a small seed set of metaphorical expressions,
learns the analogies involved in their production, and extends the set of analogies by
means of spectral clustering of verbs and nouns. Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010)
introduced the hypothesis of “clustering by association,” stating that in the course of
distributional noun clustering, abstract concepts tend to cluster together if they are
associated with the same source domain, whereas concrete concepts cluster by meaning
similarity. In the course of distributional clustering, concrete concepts (e.g., water, coffee,
beer, liquid) tend to be clustered together when they have similar meanings. In contrast,
abstract concepts (e.g., marriage, democracy, cooperation) tend to be clustered together
when they are metaphorically associated with the same source domain(s) (e.g., both
marriage and democracy can be viewed as mechanisms or games). Because of this shared
association structure they share common contexts in the corpus. For instance, Figure 2
shows a more concrete cluster of mechanisms and a more abstract cluster containing
both marriage and democracy, along with their associated verb cluster. Such clustering
patterns allow the system to discover new, previously unseen conceptual and linguistic
metaphors starting from a small set of examples, or seed metaphors. For instance,
having seen the seed metaphor “mend marriage” it infers that “the functioning of democ-
racy” is also used metaphorically, since mend and function are both MECHANISM verbs
and marriage and democracy are in the same cluster. This is how the system expands
from a small set of seed metaphorical expressions to cover new concepts and new
metaphors.

Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010) experimented with unconstrained spectral clus-
tering and applied their system to English data. In this article, we extend their method
to perform constrained clustering, and thus investigate the effectiveness of additional
supervision in the form of annotated metaphorical mappings. We then also apply the

that are various kinds of mechanisms; at the bottom is a cluster containing verbs co-occurring

original unconstrained method and its new constrained variant to three languages—
English, Spanish, and Russian—thus testing the approach in a multilingual setting.

The second set of experiments in this article are based on the method of Shutova and
Sun (2013), which is inspired by the same observation about distributional clustering.
Through the use of hierarchical soft clustering techniques, Shutova and Sun (2013) de-
rive a network of concepts in which metaphorical associations are exhibited at different
levels of granularity. If, in the method of Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010), the source
and target domain clusters were connected through the use of the seed expressions, the
method of Shutova and Sun (2013) learns both the clusters and the connections between
them automatically from the data, in a fully unsupervised fashion. Because one of the
aims of this article is to investigate the level and type of supervision optimally required
to generalize metaphorical mechanisms from text, we adapt and apply the method of
Shutova and Sun (2013) to our languages of interest and compare its performance to
that of the spectral clustering based methods across languages. We thus also test the
method, which has been previously evaluated only on English data, in a multilingual
setting.

Clustering techniques have also been previously used in metaphor processing re-
search in a more traditional sense (i.e., to identify linguistic expressions with a simi-
lar or related meaning). Mason (2004) performed WordNet sense clustering to obtain
selectional preference classes, and Mohler et al. (2013) used it to determine similarity
between concepts and to link them in semantic signatures. Strzalkowski et al. (2013)
and Gandy et al. (2013) clustered metaphorically used terms to form potential source
domains. Birke and Sarkar (2006) clustered sentences containing metaphorical and
literal uses of verbs. Their core assumption was that all instances of the verb in se-
mantically similar sentences have the same sense, either the literal or the metaphorical
one. However, the latter approaches did not investigate how metaphorical associations
structure the distributional semantic space, which is what we focus on in this article.

2.2.3 LDA Topic Modeling. Heintz et al. (2013) applied LDA topic modeling (Blei, Ng,
and Jordan 2003) to the problem of metaphor identification in experiments with English
and Spanish. Their hypothesis was that if a sentence contained both source and target
domain vocabulary, it contained a metaphor. The authors focused on the target domain
of governance and manually compiled a set of source concepts with which governance
could be associated. They used LDA topics as proxies for source and target concepts: If
vocabulary from both source and target topics was present in a sentence, this sentence
was tagged as containing a metaphor. The topics were learned from Wikipedia and
then aligned to source and target concepts using sets of human-created seed words.
When the metaphorical sentences were retrieved, the source topics that are common in
the document were excluded. This ensured that the source vocabulary was transferred
from a new domain. The authors collected the data for their experiments from news
Web sites and governance-related blogs in English and Spanish. They ran their system
on these data, and output a ranked set of metaphorical examples. They carried out two
types of evaluation: (1) top five linguistic examples for each conceptual metaphor were
judged by two annotators, yielding an F-score of 0.59 for English (κ = 0.48); and (2) 250
top-ranked examples in system output were annotated for metaphoricity using Amazon
Mechanical Turk, yielding a mean metaphoricity of 0.41 (standard deviation = 0.33) in
English and 0.33 (standard deviation = 0.23) in Spanish.

The method of Heintz et al. (2013) relies on the ideas of the Conceptual Metaphor
Theory, in that metaphorical language can be generalized using information about
source and target domains. Many supervised classification approaches (e.g., Mohler

81



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

et al. 2013; Tsvetkov, Mukomel, and Gershman 2013), as well as our own approach, share
this intuition. However, our methods are different in their aims. If the method of Heintz
et al. (2013) learned information about the internal domain structure from the data
(through the use of LDA), our methods aim to learn information about cross-domain
mappings, as well as the internal domain structure, from the words’ distributional
behavior.

In addition, in contrast to most of the systems described in this section, we experi-
ment with minimally supervised and unsupervised techniques that require little or no
annotated training data, and thus can be easily adapted to new domains and languages.
Unlike most previous approaches, we also experiment with metaphor identification in
a general-domain setting.

3. Data Sets and Feature Extraction

Because our approach involves distributional learning from large collections of text, the
choice of an appropriate text corpus plays an important role in the experiments and the
interpretation of results. We have selected comparably large, wide-coverage corpora in
our three languages to train the systems. The corpora were then parsed using a depen-
dency parser and VERB–SUBJECT, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT, and VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT
relations were extracted from the parser output. Following previous semantic noun and
verb clustering experiments (Pantel and Lin 2002; Bergsma, Lin, and Goebel 2008; Sun
and Korhonen 2009), we use these grammatical relations (GRs) as features for clustering.
The features used for noun clustering consisted of the verb lemmas occurring in VERB–
SUBJECT, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT, and VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT relations with the nouns
in our data set, indexed by relation type. The features used for verb clustering were
the noun lemmas, occurring in the above GRs with the verbs in the data set, also
indexed by relation type. The feature values were the relative frequencies of the features.
For instance, the feature vector for democracy in English would contain the follow-
ing entries: {restore-dobj n1, establish-dobj n2, build-dobj n3, ... , vote in-iobj
ni, call for-iobj ni+1, ... , survive-subj nk, emerge-subj nk+1, ...}, where n is the
frequency of the feature.

3.1 English Data

The English verb and noun data sets used for clustering contain the 2,000 most frequent
verbs and the 2,000 most frequent nouns in the BNC (Burnard 2007), respectively. The
BNC is balanced with respect to topic and genre, which makes it appropriate for the
selection of a data set of most common source and target concepts and their linguistic
realizations. The features for clustering were, however, extracted from the English
Gigaword corpus (Graff et al. 2003), which is more suitable for feature extraction be-
cause of its large size. The Gigaword corpus was first parsed using the RASP parser
(Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson 2006) and the VERB–SUBJECT, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT,
and VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT relations were then extracted from the GR output of the
parser, from which the feature vectors were formed.

3.2 Spanish Data

The Spanish data were extracted from the Spanish Gigaword corpus (Mendonca
et al. 2011). The verb and noun data sets used for clustering consisted of the 2,000

82



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

most frequent verbs and 2,000 most frequent nouns in this corpus. The corpus was
parsed using the Spanish Malt parser (Nivre et al. 2007; Ballesteros et al. 2010).
VERB–SUBJECT, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT, and VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT relations were then
extracted from the output of the parser and the feature vectors were constructed
for all verbs and nouns in the data set in a similar manner to the English system.
For example, the feature vector for the noun democracia included the following en-
tries: {destruir-dobj n1, reinstaurar-dobj n2, proteger-dobj n3, ... , elegir a-iobj
ni, comprometer con-iobj ni+1, ... , florecer-subj nk, funcionar-subj nk+1, ...}.

3.3 Russian Data

The Russian data were extracted from the RU-WaC corpus (Sharoff 2006), a two-billion-
word representative collection of text from the Russian Web. The corpus was parsed
using the Malt dependency parser for Russian (Sharoff and Nivre 2011), and the VERB–
SUBJECT, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT, and VERB–INDIRECT OBJECT relations were extracted
to create the feature vectors. Similarly to the English and Spanish experiments, the
2,000 most frequent verbs and 2,000 most frequent nouns, according to the RU-WaC,
constituted the verb and noun data sets used for clustering.

4. Semi-Supervised Metaphor Identification Experiments

We first experiment with a flat clustering solution, where metaphorical patterns are
learned by means of hard clustering of verbs and nouns at one level of generality.6

This approach to metaphor identification is based on the hypothesis of clustering by
association, which we first introduced in Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010). Our
expectation is that clustering by association would allow us to learn numerous new
target domains that are associated with the same source domain from the data in a
minimally supervised way. Following Shutova, Sun, and Korhonen (2010), we also use
clustering techniques to collect source domain vocabulary.

We perform verb and noun clustering using the spectral clustering algorithm, which
has proven to be effective in lexical acquisition tasks (Brew and Schulte im Walde 2002;
Sun and Korhonen 2009) and is suitable for high-dimensional data (Chen et al. 2006). We
experiment with its unconstrained and constrained versions. The unconstrained algorithm
performs clustering (and thus identifies metaphorical patterns) in a fully unsupervised
way, relying on the information contained in the data alone. The constrained version
uses a small set of example metaphorical mappings as constraints to reinforce clustering
by association. We then investigate to what extent adding metaphorical constraints
affects the resulting partition of the semantic space as a whole. Further details of these
two methods are provided subsequently. Once the clusters have been created in either
the unconstrained or constrained setting, the identification of metaphorical expressions
is boosted from a small number of linguistic examples—the seed expressions.

The seed expressions in our experiments are verb–subject and verb–direct object
metaphors, in which the verb metaphorically describes the noun (e.g., “mend mar-
riage”). Note that these are linguistic metaphors; their corresponding metaphorical
mappings are not annotated. The seed expressions are then used to establish a link
between the verb cluster that contains source domain vocabulary and the noun cluster

6 Hard clustering produces a partition where every object belongs to one cluster only.

83



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

that contains diverse target concepts associated with that source domain. This link then
allows the system to identify a large number of new metaphorical expressions in a
text corpus. In summary, the system (1) performs noun clustering in order to harvest
target concepts associated with the same source domain; (2) creates a source domain
verb lexicon by means of verb clustering; (3) uses seed expressions to connect source
(verb) and target (noun) clusters between which metaphorical associations hold; and
(4) searches the corpus for metaphorical expressions describing the target domain
concepts using the verbs from the source domain lexicon.

4.1 Clustering Methods
4.1.1 Spectral Clustering. Spectral clustering partitions objects relying on their similarity
matrix. Given a set of data points, the similarity matrix W ∈ RN×N records similarities
wij between all pairs of points. We construct similarity matrices using the Jensen-
Shannon divergence as a measure. Jensen-Shannon divergence between two feature
vectors qi and qj is defined as follows:

JSD(qi, qj) = 12D(qi||m) +
1
2D(qj||m) (1)

where D is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and m is the average of the qi and qj. We
then use the following similarity wij between i and j as defined in Sun and Korhonen
(2009):

wij = e−JSD(qi,qj ) (2)

The similarity matrix W encodes a weighted undirected graph G := (V, E), by providing
its adjacency weights. We can think of the points we are going to cluster as the vertices
of the graph, and their similarities wij as connection weights on the edges of the graph.
Spectral clustering attempts to find a partitioning of the graph into clusters that are
minimally connected to vertices in other clusters, but which are of roughly equal sizes
(Shi and Malik 2000). This is important for metaphor identification, as our aim is to
identify clusters of target concepts associated with the same source domain on one hand
and to ensure that different metaphorical mappings are separated from each other in
the overall partition on the other hand. In particular, we use the NJW spectral clustering
algorithm introduced by Ng et al. (2002).7

In our case, each vertex vi represents a word indexed by i ∈ 1, ..., N. The weight
between vertices vi and vj is denoted by wij ≥ 0 and represents the similarity or adja-
cency between vi and vj, taken from the adjacency matrix W. If wij = 0, we say vertices
vi and vj are unconnected. Because G is taken to be undirected, W must be symmetric—
this explains our use of Jensen-Shannon divergence rather than the more well-known
Kullback-Leibler divergence in constructing our similarity matrix W.8 We denote the
degree of a vertex vi by di :=

∑N
j=1 wij. The degree represents the weighted connectivity

of vi to the rest of the graph. Finally, we define the graph Laplacian of G as L := D−W;
the role of the graph Laplacian will become apparent subsequently.

7 For a comprehensive review of spectral clustering algorithms see Von Luxburg (2007). Our description of
spectral clustering here is largely based on this review.

8 Note that any symmetric matrix with non-negative, real-valued elements can therefore be taken to
represent a weighted, undirected graph.

84



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

Recall that our goal is to minimize similarities (weights) between clusters while
producing clusters of roughly equal sizes. Denote the sum of weights between cluster A
and points not in cluster A as W(A,−A) := ∑i∈A,j/∈A wij. The NCUT objective function
introduced by Shi and Malik (2000) incorporates a tradeoff between these two objec-
tives as:

NCut(A1, ..., AK ) :=
K∑

k=1

W(Ak,−Ak)∑
v`∈Ak d`

(3)

We can now recast our goal as finding the partitioning A1, ... AK that minimizes this
objective function. We can achieve some clarity about this objective function by
rewriting it using linear algebra. If we define the normalized indicator vectors hk :=
(h1k, ..., hNk)T where we set

hi,k :=





1√∑
v`∈Ak d`

if vi ∈ Ak

0 otherwise

(4)

then some straightforward computations reveal that:

hTk Lhk =
1
2

∑

i∈Ak,j/∈Ak

wij =
W(Ak,−Ak)∑

v`∈Ak d`
(5)

Therefore, if we collect the vectors h1, ..., hK into a matrix H = (h1, ..., hK ), then hTk Lhk =
(HTLH)kk, and minimizing Equation (3) is equivalent to the following minimization
problem on the graph Laplacian:

min
H

Tr(HTLH) where H is subject to constraint 4 (6)

If we could find the optimal H, it would be straightforward to find the cluster mem-
berships from H, since hik is nonzero if and only if vi is in cluster Ak. Unfortunately,
solving this minimization problem is NP hard (Wagner and Wagner 1993; Von Luxburg
2007). However, an approximate solution can be found by relaxing the constraints on the
elements of H in constraint 4. Thus, we must relax our optimization problem somewhat.
One entailment of constraint 4 is that the matrix D1/2H is a matrix of orthonormal
vectors—that is, (D1/2H)T(D1/2H) = HTDH = I. Ng et al. (2002) proceed by dropping
the constraint that hik be either 0 or 1/

√∑
v`∈Ak d`, but keeping the orthonormality

constraint. Thus, they seek to solve the following problem:

min
H∈RN×K

Tr(HTLH) subject to HTDH = I (7)

85



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

By setting T := D1/2H, this can be rewritten as

min
T∈RN×K

Tr(TTD−1/2LD−1/2T) subject to TTT = I (8)

This problem is tractable because it is equivalent to the problem of finding the first K

eigenvectors of D−1/2LD−1/2.
Because we have dropped the constraint that hi,k be nonzero if and only if vi is in cluster
Ak from Equation (4), then we can no longer infer the cluster memberships directly from
H or T. Instead, Ng et al. (2002) approximately infer cluster memberships by clustering
in the eigenspace defined by T using a clustering algorithm such as K-MEANS. The
algorithm of Ng et al. (2002) is summarized as Algorithm 1.

4.1.2 Spectral Clustering with Constraints. Constrained clustering methods incorporate
prior knowledge about which words belong in the same clusters. In our experiments,
we sought methods that were well-behaved when given only positive constraints (i.e.,
two words belong in the same cluster) rather than both positive and negative constraints
(i.e., two words do not belong in the same cluster). Because we have no hard-and-fast
constraints that must be satisfied, but rather subjective information that we believe
should influence the constraints, it was also important that our methods not strictly
enforce constraints, but rather be capable of weighing the constraints against informa-
tion available in the similarity matrix over the set of words.

In the constrained spectral clustering algorithm introduced by Ji, Xu, and Zhu
(2006), constraints are introduced by a simple modification of the objective function
of NCUT. Suppose we have C pairs of constraints indicating that two words belong to
the same cluster, and we have N words overall. For each pair c of words i and j that
belong to the same cluster, we create an N-dimensional vector uc = [uc1, uc2, ..., ucN]T

where uci = 1, ucj = −1, and the rest of the elements are equal to zero. We then collect
these vectors into the C×N constraint matrix UT = [u1, u2, ..., uN].

Suppose that we form the matrix H using the constraints on hik in Equation (4), as
before. Then if all of the constraints encoded in U are correctly specified, we have that
UH = 0 and therefore the spectral norm ‖UH‖2 = Tr((UH)TUH) = 0. As more and more
of the constraints encoded in U are violated by H, ‖UH‖ will grow. This motivates Ji,

Xu, and Zhu (2006) to modify the objective function in Equation (6) by adding a term
that penalizes a large norm for UH:

min
H

Tr(HTLH) + β‖UH‖2 where H is subject to constraint 4 (9)

Here, β governs how strongly the constraints encoded in U should be enforced. As
before, we now relax contraint 4 and set T = D1/2H to yield:

min
T∈RN×K

Tr(TTD−1/2LD−1/2T + β‖UD−1/2T‖2) subject to TTT = I (10)

Note that β‖UD−1/2T‖2 = βTr(TTD−1/2UTUD−1/2T). Therefore by collecting terms we
can rewrite the objective function as:

min
T∈RN×K

Tr(TTD−1/2(L + βUTU)D−1/2T) subject to TTT = I (11)

Therefore, we can find the optimal T as the first K eigenvectors of (L + βUTU), and we
can assign cluster memberships using K-MEANS in a manner analogous to algorithm
NJW. The pseudocode for the JXZ algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2.

4.2 Clustering Experiments
4.2.1 Unconstrained Setting. We first applied the unconstrained version of spectral clus-
tering algorithm to our data. We experimented with different clustering granularities
(producing 100, 200, 300, and 400 clusters), examined the obtained clusters, and deter-
mined that the number of clusters set to 200 is the optimal setting for both nouns and
verbs in our task, across the three languages. This was done by means of qualitative
analysis of the clusters as representations of source and target domains—that is, by
judging how complete and homogeneous the verb clusters were as lists of potential
source domain vocabulary and how many new target domains associated with the same
source domain were found correctly in the noun clusters. This analysis was performed
on 10 randomly selected clusters taken from different granularity settings and none of
the seed expressions were used for it. Examples of clusters generated with this setting
are shown in Figures 3 (nouns) and 4 (verbs) for English; Figures 5 (nouns) and 6 (verbs)
for Spanish; and Figures 7 (nouns) and 8 (verbs) for Russian. The noun clusters represent

We created 30 st and 30 tt constraint pairs following this procedure. Constraints were selected and
validated by the authors (who are native speakers of the respective languages) without taking the
output of the unconstrained clustering step into account. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show some examples of
st and tt constraints for the three languages. One pair of constraints (relationship& trade (tt) and
relationship & vehicle (st)) was excluded from the set, since relationship can only be translated
into Spanish and Russian by a plural form (e.g. relaciónes). We thus used 29 tt constraints and 29
st constraints in our experiments.

Our expectation is that the tt constraints are better suited to aid metaphor discovery, as the
noun clusters tend to naturally contain distinct target domains associated with the same source.
The tt constraints are designed to reinforce this principle. However, introducing the st type
of constraints allows us to investigate to what extent explicitly reinforcing the source domain
features in clustering allows to harvest more target domains associated with the source.

We experimented with different constraint enforcement parameter settings (β =
0.25; 1.0; 4.0) in order to investigate the effect of the constraints on the overall partition
of the semantic space. The positive effects of the constraints were most strongly observed with
β = 4.0 and we thus used this setting in our experiments. Examples of clusters generated with
the use of constraints in the three languages are shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11. Our analysis of the
clusters has confirmed that the use of tt constraints resulted in clusters containing more diverse
target concepts associated with the same source. Compare, for instance, the unconstrained and
tt constrained clusters in Figure 9. The unconstrained cluster predominantly contains concepts
related to politics, such as profession and ideology, albeit also capturing other target domains,
such as religion and education. Adding the constraint marriage & politics, however, further

source domain (e.g., marriage and democracy). The constraints were generated according
to the following procedure:

1. TS constraints:r Select 30 target concepts.r For each of the target concepts select a source concept that it is

3. Constraints should satisfy the following criteria:r Constraints represent metaphorical mappings that hold in all three
languages, as validated by native speakers.r Each concept should appear in the set of constraints only once.10

We created 30 TS and 30 TT constraint pairs following this procedure. The source and
target concepts in the constraints were selected from the lists of 2,000 nouns that we
clustered in the three languages. Constraints were selected and validated by the authors
(who are native speakers of the respective languages) without taking the output of
the unconstrained clustering step into account (i.e., prior to having seen it). The lists
of constraints were first created through individual introspection, and then finalized
through discussion. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show some examples of TS and TT constraints
for the three languages. One pair of constraints (relationship & trade [TT] and relationship
& vehicle [TS]) was excluded from the set, because relationship is usually translated into
Spanish and Russian by a plural form (e.g., relaciones). We thus used 29 TT constraints
and 29 TS constraints in our experiments.

Our expectation is that the TT constraints are better suited to aid metaphor dis-
covery, as the noun clusters tend to naturally contain distinct target domains associ-
ated with the same source. The TT constraints are designed to reinforce this principle.
However, introducing the TS type of constraint allows us to investigate to what extent
explicitly reinforcing the source domain features in clustering allows us to harvest more
target domains associated with the source.

We experimented with different constraint enforcement parameter settings (β =
0.25, 1.0, 4.0) in order to investigate the effect of the constraints on the overall partition of

10 This applies to both the source and the target concepts. This requirement was imposed to ensure that the
constraints are enforced pairwise during clustering.

languages are shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11. Our analysis of the clusters has confirmed that
the use of tt constraints resulted in clusters containing more diverse target concepts associated
with the same source. Compare, for instance, the unconstrained and tt constrained clusters in
Figure 9. The unconstrained cluster predominantly contains concepts related to politics, such
as profession and ideology, albeit also capturing other target domains, such as religion and
education. Adding the constraint marriage & politics, however, further increases the domain
diversity of the cluster, adding such target concepts as life, hope, dream and economy. The
Spanish tt constrained clustering in Figure 10 shows the wider effects of constrained clustering
throughout the whole noun space. Although none of the constraints is explicitly manifested
in this cluster, one can see that this cluster nonetheless contains a more diverse set of target
concepts associated with the same source, as compared to the original unconstrained cluster (see
Figure 10). The ts constraints, as expected, highlighted the source domain features of the target
word, resulting in e.g. assigning politics to the same cluster as game terms, such as round and
match in English (given the ts constraint politics & game). This type of constraints are thus

constraints were most strongly manifested with β = 4.0, and we thus used this setting
in our further experiments. Examples of clusters generated with the use of constraints in
the three languages are shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11. Our analysis of the clusters has
confirmed that the use of TT constraints resulted in clusters containing more diverse tar-
get concepts associated with the same source. Compare, for instance, the unconstrained
and TT constrained clusters in Figure 9. The unconstrained cluster predominantly con-
tains concepts related to politics, such as profession and ideology, albeit also capturing
other target domains, such as religion and education. Adding the constraint MARRIAGE

These trends were evident across the three languages, as demonstrated by the examples in the
respective figures.

4.3 Identification of metaphorical expressions
4.3.1 Seed expressions. Once the clusters have been obtained, we then used a set of seed
metaphorical expressions to connect the source and target clusters, thus enabling the system
to recognise new metaphorical expressions. The seed expressions in the three languages were
extracted from naturally-occurring text, manually annotated for linguistic metaphor.

English seed expressions The seed examples used in the English experiments were extracted
from the metaphor corpus created by Shutova and Teufel (2010). Their corpus is a subset of
the BNC covering a range of genres: fiction, news articles, essays on politics, international
relations and history, radio broadcast (transcribed speech). As such, the corpus provides a suitable
platform for testing the metaphor processing system on real-world general-domain expressions
in contemporary English. We extracted verb - subject and verb - direct object metaphorical
expressions from this corpus. All phrases were included unless they fell in one of the following
categories:

target concepts as life, hope, dream, and economy. The Spanish TT constrained clustering in
Figure 10 shows the wider effects of constrained clustering throughout the whole noun
space. Although none of the constraints is explicitly manifested in this cluster, one can
see that this cluster nonetheless contains a more diverse set of target concepts associated
with the same source, as compared to the original unconstrained cluster (see Figure 10).
The TS constraints, as expected, highlighted the source domain features of the target
word, resulting in (for example) assigning politics to the same cluster as game terms,
such as round and match in English (given the TS constraint POLITICS & GAME). These
types of constraints are thus less likely to be suitable for metaphor identification, where
purely target clusters are desired. These trends were evident across the three languages,
as demonstrated by the examples in the respective figures.

the system to recognize new metaphorical expressions. The seed expressions in the
three languages were extracted from naturally occurring text, manually annotated for
linguistic metaphor.

English seed expressions The seed examples used in the English experiments were
extracted from the metaphor corpus created by Shutova and Teufel (2010). Their corpus
is a subset of the BNC covering a range of genres: fiction; news articles; essays on
politics, international relations, and history; and radio broadcast (transcribed speech).
As such, the corpus provides a suitable platform for testing the metaphor-processing
system on real-world general-domain expressions in contemporary English. We ex-
tracted verb–subject and verb–direct object metaphorical expressions from this corpus.
All phrases were included unless they fell into one of the following categories:r Phrases where the subject or object referent is unknown (e.g., containing

pronouns such as “in which they [changes] operated”) or represented by a
named entity (e.g., “Then Hillary leapt into the conversation”).r Phrases whose metaphorical meaning is realized solely in passive
constructions (e.g., “sociologists have been inclined to [..]”).r Multi-word metaphors (e.g., “go on pilgrimage with Raleigh or put out to sea
with Tennyson”), because these are beyond the scope of our experiments.

The resulting data set consists of 62 phrases that are different single-word metaphors
representing verb–subject and verb–direct object relations, where a verb is used meta-
phorically. The phrases include, for instance, “stir excitement,” “reflect enthusiasm,”
“grasp theory,” “cast doubt,” “suppress memory,” “throw remark” (verb–direct object con-
structions); and “campaign surged,” “factor shaped [...],” “tension mounted,” “ideology
embraces,” “example illustrates” (subject–verb constructions). The phrases in the seed set
were manually annotated for grammatical relations.

Russian and Spanish seed expressions We have collected a set of texts in Russian and
Spanish, following the genre distribution of the English corpus of Shutova and Teufel
(2010), insofar as possible. Native speakers of Russian and Spanish then annotated lin-
guistic metaphors in these corpora, following the annotation procedures and guidelines
of Shutova and Teufel. We then extracted the metaphorical expressions in verb–subject
and verb–direct object constructions from these data, according to the same criteria used
to create the English seed set. This resulted in 72 seed expressions for Spanish and
85 seed expressions for Russian. The Spanish seed set includes, for instance, the fol-
lowing examples: “vender influencia,” “inundar mercado,” “empapelar ciudad,” “labrarse
futuro,” contagiar estado” (verb–direct object constructions); and “violencia salpicó,”
“debate tropezó,” “alegrı́a brota,” “historia gira,” “corazón saltó” (subject–verb construc-
tions). The expressions in the seed sets were manually annotated for the corresponding
grammatical relations.

4.3.2 Corpus Search. Each individual seed expression implies a connection between
a source domain (through the source domain verb; e.g., mend) and a target domain
(through the target domain noun; e.g., marriage). The seed expressions are thus used to
connect source and target clusters between which metaphorical associations hold. The
system then proceeds to search the respective corpus for source and target domain terms
from the connected clusters within a single grammatical relation. Specifically, the system
classifies verb–direct object and verb–subject relations in the corpus as metaphorical

if the lexical items in the grammatical relation appear in the linked source (verb) and
target (noun) clusters. Consider the following example sentence extracted from the BNC
for English.

(1) Few would deny that in the nineteenth century change was greatly accelerated.

The relevant GRs identified by the parser are presented in Figure 12. The relation
between the verb accelerate and its semantic object change is expressed in the passive
voice and is, therefore, tagged by RASP as an ncsubj GR. Because this GR contains
terminology from associated source (MOTION) and target (CHANGE) domains, it is
marked as metaphorical and so is the term accelerate, which belongs to the source
domain. The search space for metaphor identification was the BNC parsed by RASP
for English; the Spanish Gigaword corpus parsed by the Spanish Malt parser for
Spanish; and the RuWaC parsed by the Russian Malt parser for Russian. The search
was performed similarly in the three languages: The system searched the corpus for the
source and target domain vocabulary within a particular grammatical relation (verb–
direct object or verb–subject). Some examples of retrieved metaphorical expressions are
presented in Figures 13, 14, and 15.

English) and asked human annotators to decide whether these were metaphorical or
not.

degree.
Materials We randomly sampled 100 sentences from the output of the UNCON-

expression annotated by the respective system. We then also extracted 100 random

sentences containing verbs in direct object and subject relations from corpora for each
language. These examples were used as distractors in the experiments. The subjects
were thus presented with a set of 500 sentences for English (UNCONSTRAINED, TT and
TS CONSTRAINED, baseline, distractors) and 400 sentences for Russian and Spanish
(UNCONSTRAINED, TT and TS CONSTRAINED, distractors). The sentences in the sets were
randomized. An example of the sentence annotation format is given in Figure 19.
Task and guidelines The participants were asked to mark which of the expressions
were metaphorical in their judgment. They were encouraged to rely on their own
intuition of what a metaphor is in the annotation process. However, additional guidance
in the form of the following definition of metaphor (Pragglejaz Group 2007) was also
provided:

1. For each verb establish its meaning in context and try to imagine a more
basic meaning of this verb in other contexts. Basic meanings normally are:
(1) more concrete; (2) related to bodily action; (3) more precise (as opposed
to vague); (4) historically older.

2. If you can establish a basic meaning that is distinct from the meaning of
the verb in this context, the verb is likely to be used metaphorically.

Interannotator agreement We assessed the reliability of the annotations in terms
of kappa (Siegel and Castellan 1988). The interannotator agreement was measured
at κ = 0.62 (n = 2, N = 500, k = 2) in the English experiments (substantial agreement);
κ = 0.58 (n = 2, N = 400, k = 2) in the Spanish experiments (moderate agreement); and
κ = 0.64 (n = 2, N = 400, k = 2) in the Russian experiments (substantial agreement).
The data suggest that the main source of disagreement between the annotators was the
presence of highly conventional metaphors (e.g., verbs such as impose, convey, decline).
According to previous studies (Gibbs 1984; Pragglejaz Group 2007; Shutova and Teufel
2010) such metaphors are deeply ingrained in our everyday use of language and thus
are perceived by some annotators as literal expressions.

annotator individually and the average precision across annotators for a given language
is reported. The results are presented in Table 4. These results demonstrate that the
method is portable across languages, with the UNCONSTRAINED system achieving a
high precision of 0.77 in English, 0.74 in Spanish, and 0.67 in Russian. As we expected,
TT constraints outperformed the TS constraints in all languages. This is likely to be
the result of the explicit emphasis on the source domain features in TS-constrained
clustering, which led to a number of literal expressions (containing the source domain
noun) being tagged as metaphorical (e.g., approach a barrier). The effect of TT constraints
is not as pronounced as we expected in English and Spanish. In Russian, however,
TT constraints led to a considerable improvement of 6 percentage points in system
performance, yielding the highest precision.

The CONSTRAINED and UNCONSTRAINED variants of our method harvested a
comparable number of metaphorical expressions. Table 5 shows the number of seeds
used in our experiments in each language, the number of unique metaphorical ex-
pressions identified by the unconstrained systems for these seeds, and the total number
of sentences containing these expressions as retrieved in the respective corpus.12 These
statistics demonstrate that the systems expand considerably over the small seed sets
they use as training data and identify a large number of new metaphorical expressions
in corpora. It should be noted, however, that the output of the systems exhibits sig-
nificant overlap in the CONSTRAINED and UNCONSTRAINED settings (e.g., 68% overlap
in TS-constrained and unconstrained settings, and 73% in TT-constrained and uncon-
strained settings in English).

12 Note that the English BNC is smaller in size than the Spanish Gigaword or the Russian RuWaC, leading
to fewer English sentences retrieved.

4.5 Discussion and Error Analysis

We have shown that the method leads to a considerable expansion over the seed set
and operates with a high precision—that is, produces high quality annotations—in the
three languages. It identifies new metaphorical expressions relying on the patterns of
metaphorical use that it learns automatically through clustering. We have conducted
a data analysis to compare the UNCONSTRAINED and CONSTRAINED variants of our
method and to gain insights about the effects of metaphorical constraints. Although at
first glance the performance of the systems appeared not to be strongly influenced by
the use of TT constraints (except in the case of Russian), the analysis of the identified
expressions revealed interesting qualitative differences. According to our qualitative
analysis, the TT constrained clusters exhibited a higher diversity with respect to the
target domains they contained in all languages, leading to the system capturing a higher
number of new metaphorical patterns, as compared to the unconstrained clusters. As
a result, it discovered a more diverse set of metaphorical expressions given the same
seeds. Such examples include “mend world” (given the seed “mend marriage”); “frame
rule” (given the seed “glimpse duty”); or “lodge service,” “fuel life,” “probe world,” “found
science,” or “fuel economy” (given the seed “base career”). Overall, our analysis has
shown that even a small number of metaphorical constraints (such as 29 in our case)
has global effects throughout the cluster space, that is, influences the structure of all
clusters. The fact that the TT constrained method yielded a performance similar to the
unconstrained method in English and Spanish and a considerably better performance
in Russian suggests that such effects are desirable for metaphor processing. Another
consideration that has arisen from the analysis of the system output is that the TT
clustering setting may benefit from a larger cluster size in order to incorporate both
similar and diverse target concepts.

The TS constrained clusters exhibit the same trend with respect to cluster diversity.
However, the explicit pairing of source and target concepts (that occasionally leads
to them being assigned to the same cluster) produces a number of false positives,
decreasing the system precision. For instance, in the case of the constraint DIFFICULTY
& BARRIER, these two nouns are clustered together. As a result, given the seed “confront
problem,” the system falsely tags expressions such as approach barrier or face barrier as
metaphorical.

The comparison of the English system output to that of a WordNet baseline shows
that the clusters in all clustering settings capture diverse concepts, rather than merely
the synonymous ones, as in the case of WordNet synsets. The clusters thus provide
generalizations over the source and target domains, leading to a wider coverage and ac-
quisition of a diverse set of metaphors. The observed discrepancy in precision between
the clustering methods and the baseline (i.e., as high as 37%) can be explained by the
fact that a large number of metaphorical senses are included in WordNet. This means
that in WordNet synsets, source domain verbs appear together with more abstract
terms. For instance, the metaphorical sense of shape in the phrase “shape opinion” is
part of the synset “(determine, shape, mold, influence, regulate).” This results in the
low precision of the baseline system, because it tags literal expressions (e.g., influence
opinion) as metaphorical, assuming that all verbs from the synset belong to the source
domain.

System errors were of similar nature across the three languages and had the fol-
lowing key sources: (1) metaphor conventionality and (2) general polysemy. Because a
number of metaphorical uses of verbs are highly conventional (such as those in “hold
views, adopt traditions, tackle a problem”), such verbs tend to be clustered together

99



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

with the verbs that would be literal in the same context. For instance, the verb tackle
is found in a cluster with solve, resolve, handle, confront, face, and so on. This results in
the system tagging resolve a problem as metaphorical if it has seen “tackle a problem” as
a seed expression. However, the errors of this type do not occur nearly as frequently as
in the case of the baseline.

A number of system errors were due to cases of general polysemy and homonymy
of both verbs and nouns. For example, the noun passage can mean both “the act of
passing from one state or place to the next” and “a section of text; particularly a section
of medium length,” as defined in WordNet. Our method performs hard clustering, that
is, it does not distinguish between different word senses. Hence the noun passage oc-
curred in only one cluster, containing concepts such as thought, word, sentence, expression,
reference, address, description, and so on. This cluster models the latter meaning of passage.
Given the seed phrase “she blocked the thought,” the system then tags a number of false
positives such as block passage, impede passage, obstruct passage, and speed passage.

Russian exhibited an interesting difference from English and Spanish in the
organization of its word space. This is likely to be due to its rich derivational
morphology. In other words, in Russian, more lexical items can be used to refer
to the same concept than in English or Spanish, highlighting slightly different
aspects of meaning. In English and Spanish, the same meaning differences tend
to be expressed at the phrase level rather than at word level. For instance, the
English verb to pour can be translated into Russian by at least five different verbs:
lit, nalit, slit, otlit, vilit, roughly meaning to pour, to pour into, to pour out, to pour
only a small amount, to pour all of the liquid out, to pour some of the liquid out, etc.13

As a result, some Russian words tend to naturally form highly dense clusters
essentially referring to a single concept (as in case of the verbs of pouring), while
at the same time sharing similar distributional features with other, related but
different concepts (such as sip or spill). This property suggests that it may be
necessary to cluster a larger number of Russian nouns or verbs (into the same or
lower number of clusters) in order to achieve the cluster coverage and diversity
comparable to the English system. With respect to our experiments, this phenome-
non has led to the unconstrained clusters containing more near-synonyms (such as
the many variations of pouring), and the metaphorical constraints had a stronger
effect in diversifying the clusters, thus allowing us to better capture new metaphorical
associations.

Although the diversity of the noun clusters is central to the acquisition of metaphor-
ical patterns, it is also worth noting that in many cases the system benefits not only
from dissimilar concepts within the noun clusters, but also from dissimilar concepts in
the verb clusters. Verb clusters produced automatically relying on contextual features
may contain lexical items with distinct, or even opposite meanings (e.g., throw and catch,
take off and land). However, they tend to belong to the same semantic domain. It is the
diversity of verb meanings within the domain cluster that allows the generalization
from a limited number of seed expressions to a broader spectrum of previously unseen
metaphors, non-synonymous to those in the seed set.

The fact that our approach is seed-dependent is one of its possible limitations,
affecting the coverage of the system. Wide coverage is essential for the practical use
of the system. In order to obtain full coverage, a large and representative seed set is

13 Similar examples can be found in other languages with a highly productive derivational morphology,
such as German.

100



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

necessary. Although it is difficult to capture the whole variety of metaphorical language
in a limited set of examples, it is possible to compile a seed set representative of common
source-target domain mappings. The learning capabilities of the system can then be
used to expand from those to the whole range of conventional metaphorical mappings
and expressions. In addition, because the precision of the system was measured on
the data set produced by expanding individual seed expressions, we would expect
the expansion of new seed expressions to yield a comparable quality of annotations.
Incorporating new seed expressions is thus likely to increase the recall of the system
without a considerable loss in precision. However, creating seed sets for new languages
may not always be practical. We thus further experiment with fully unsupervised
metaphor identification techniques.

5. Unsupervised Metaphor Identification Experiments

The focus of our experiments so far has been mainly on metaphorical expressions, and
metaphorical associations were modeled implicitly within the system. In addition, both
the CONSTRAINED and the UNCONSTRAINED methods relied on a small amount of
supervision in the form of seed expressions to identify new metaphorical language. In
our next set of experiments, we investigate whether it is possible to learn metaphorical
connections between the clusters from the data directly (without the use of metaphorical
seeds for supervision) and thus to acquire a large set of explicit metaphorical associa-
tions and derive the corresponding metaphorical expressions in a fully unsupervised
fashion.

This approach is theoretically grounded in cognitive science findings suggesting
that abstract and concrete concepts are organized differently in the human brain (Binder
et al. 2005; Crutch and Warrington 2005, 2010; Huang, Lee, and Federmeier 2010;
Wiemer-Hastings and Xu 2005; Adorni and Proverbio 2012). According to Crutch and
Warrington (2005), these differences emerge from their general patterns of relation with
other concepts. In this section, we present a method that learns such different patterns
of association of abstract and concrete concepts with other concepts automatically. Our
system performs soft hierarchical clustering of nouns to create a network (or a graph)
of concepts at multiple levels of generality and to determine the strength of association
between the concepts in this graph. We expect that, whereas concrete concepts would
tend to naturally organize into a tree-like structure (with more specific terms descending
from the more general terms), abstract concepts would exhibit a more complex pattern
of association. Consider the example in Figure 20. The figure schematically shows a
small portion of the graph describing the concepts of mechanism (concrete), political
system, and relationship (abstract) at two levels of generality. One can see from this graph
that concrete concepts, such as bike or engine, tend to be strongly associated with one
concept at the higher level in the hierarchy (mechanism). In contrast, abstract concepts
may have multiple higher-level associates: the literal ones and the metaphorical ones.
For instance, the abstract concept of democracy is literally associated with the more
general concept of political system, as well as metaphorically associated with the concept
of mechanism. Such multiple associations are due to the fact that political systems are
metaphorically viewed as mechanisms; they can function, break, they can be oiled, and
so forth. We often discuss concepts such as democracy or dictatorship using mechanism
terminology, and thus a distributional learning approach would learn that they share
features with political systems (from their literal uses), as well as with mechanisms (from
their metaphorical uses, as shown next to the respective graph edges in the figure). Our

system discovers such association patterns within the graph and uses them to identify
metaphorical connections between concepts.

The graph of concepts is built using hierarchical graph factorization clustering
(HGFC) (Yu, Yu, and Tresp 2006) of nouns, yielding a network of clusters with differ-
ent levels of generality. The weights on the edges of the graph indicate the level of
association between the clusters (concepts). The system then traverses the graph to find
metaphorical associations between clusters using the weights on the edges of the graph.
It then generates lists of salient features for the metaphorically connected clusters and
searches the corpus for metaphorical expressions describing the target domain concepts,
using the verbs from the set of salient features.

5.1 Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering

In contrast to flat clustering, which produces a partition at one level of generality, the
goal of hierarchical clustering is to organize the objects into a hierarchy of clusters
with different granularities. Traditional hierarchical clustering methods widely used in
NLP (such as agglomerative clustering [Schulte im Walde and Brew 2001; Stevenson
and Joanis 2003; Ferrer 2004; Devereux and Costello 2005]) take decisions about
cluster membership at the level of individual clusters when these are merged. As Sun
and Korhonen (2011) pointed out, such algorithms suffer from two problems—error
propagation and local pairwise merging—because the clustering solution is not globally
optimized. In addition, they are designed to perform hard clustering of objects at each
level, by successively merging the clusters. This makes them unsuitable to model
multi-way associations between concepts within the hierarchy, albeit such association
patterns exist in language and reasoning (Crutch and Warrington 2005; Hill, Korhonen,
and Bentz 2014). As opposed to this, HGFC allows modeling of multiple relations
between concepts simultaneously via a soft clustering solution. It successively derives
probabilistic bipartite graphs for every level in the hierarchy. The algorithm delays
the decisions about cluster membership of individual words until the overall graph
structure has been computed, which allows it to globally optimize the assignment of
words to clusters. In addition, HGFC can detect the number of levels and the number
of clusters at each level of the hierarchical graph automatically. This is essential for our
task as these settings are difficult to pre-define for a general-purpose concept graph.

The algorithm starts from a similarity matrix that encodes similarities between the
objects. Given a set of nouns, V = {vn}Nn=1, we construct their similarity matrix W,

102



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

using Jensen-Shannon Divergence as a similarity measure (as in the spectral clustering
experiments). The matrix W in turn encodes an undirected similarity graph G, where
the nouns are mapped to vertices and their similarities represent the weights wij on
the edges between vertices i and j. Such a similarity graph is schematically shown in
Figure 21(a). The clustering problem can now be formulated as partitioning of the graph
G and deriving the cluster structure from it.

The graph G and the cluster structure can be represented by a bipartite graph
K(V, U), where V are the vertices on G and U = {up}mp=1 represent the hidden m clusters.
For example, as shown in Figure 21(b), V on G can be grouped into three clusters: u1, u2,
and u3. The matrix B denotes the n×m adjacency matrix, with bip being the connection
weight between the vertex vi and the cluster up. Thus, B represents the connections
between clusters at an upper and lower level of clustering. In order to derive the
clustering structure, we first need to compute B from the original similarity matrix. The
similarities wij in W can be interpreted as the probabilities of direct transition between
vi and vj: wij = p(vi, vj). The bipartite graph K also induces a similarity (W′) between vi
and vj, with all the paths from vi to vj going through vertices in U. This means that the
similarities w′ij are to be computed via the weights bip = p(vi, up).

We optimized this cost function by alternately updating h and λ.

A flat clustering algorithm can be induced by computing B and assigning a lower
level node to the parent node that has the largest connection weight. The number of
clusters at any level can be determined by only counting the number of non-empty
nodes (namely, the nodes that have at least one lower level node associated). To create
a hierarchical graph we need to repeat this process to successively add levels of clusters
to the graph. To create a bipartite graph for the next level, we first need to compute a

14 See Yu, Yu, and Tresp (2006) for the full proof.

104

new similarity matrix for the clusters U. The similarity between clusters p(up, uq) can be
induced from B, as follows:

p(up, uq) = p(up)p(up|uq) = (BTD−1B)pq (18)

D = diag(d1, ..., dn) where di =
m∑

p=1

bip

We can then construct a new graph G1 (Figure 21(d)) with the clusters U as vertices,
and the cluster similarities p(up, uq) as the connection weights. The clustering algorithm
can now be applied again (Figure 21(e)). This process can go on iteratively, leading to a
hierarchical graph.

The number of levels (L) and the number of clusters (m`) are detected automatically,
using the method of Sun and Korhonen (2011). Clustering starts with an initial setting
of number of clusters (m0) for the first level. In our experiment, we set the value of m0 to
800. For the subsequent levels, m` is set to the number of non-empty clusters (bipartite
graph nodes) on the parent level – 1. The matrix B is initialized randomly. We found
that the actual initialization values have little impact on the final result. The rows in
B are normalized after the initialization so the values in each row add up to one.

For a word vi, the probability of assigning it to cluster x

p ∈ X` at level ` is given by

p(x(`)p |vi) =

m` can then be determined as the number of clusters with at least one member noun
according to Equation (19). Because of the random walk property of the graph, m`
is non-increasing for higher levels (Sun and Korhonen 2011). The algorithm can thus
terminate when all nouns are assigned to one cluster. We run 1,000 iterations of updates
of h and λ (Equations (16) and (17)) for each two adjacent levels.

The whole algorithm can be summarized as follows.

The resulting graph is composed of a set of bipartite graphs defined by
B`, B`−1, ..., B1. A bipartite graph has a similar structure to the one shown in Figure 20.
For a given noun, we can rank the clusters at any level according to the soft assignment

105

probability (Equation (19)). The clusters that have no member noun were hidden from
the ranking because they do not explicitly represent any concept. However, these clus-
ters are still part of the organization of the conceptual space within the model and they
contribute to the probability for the clusters at upper levels (Equation (19)). We call the
view of the hierarchical graph where these empty clusters are hidden an explicit graph.

5.2 Identification of Metaphorical Associations

Once we obtain the explicit graph of concepts, we can now identify metaphorical
associations based on the weights connecting the clusters at different levels. Taking
a single noun (e.g., fire) as input, the system computes the probability of its cluster
membership for each cluster at each level, using the weights on the edges of the graph
(Equation (19)). We expect the cluster membership probabilities to indicate the level of
association of the input noun with the clusters. The system can then rank the clusters at
each level based on these probabilities. We chose level 3 as the optimal level of generality
for our experiments, based on our qualitative analysis of the graph.15 The system selects
six top-ranked clusters from this level (we expect an average source concept to have no
more than five typical target associates) and excludes the literal cluster containing the
input concept (e.g., fire flame blaze). The remaining clusters represent the target concepts
associated with the input source concept.

Example output for the input concepts of fire and disease in English is shown in
Figure 22. One can see from the figure that each of the noun-to-cluster mappings
represents a new conceptual metaphor (e.g., EMOTION is FIRE, VIOLENCE is FIRE, CRIME
is a DISEASE). These mappings are exemplified in language by a number of metaphorical
expressions (e.g., “His anger will burn him,” “violence flared again,” “it’s time they
found a cure for corruption”). Figures 23 and 24 show metaphorical associations iden-
tified by the Spanish and Russian systems for the same source concepts. As we can
see from the figures, FEELINGS tend to be associated with FIRE in all three languages.
Unsurprisingly, however, many of the identified metaphors differ across languages.
For instance, VICTORY, SUCCESS, and LOOKS are viewed as FIRE in Russian, whereas
IMMIGRANTS and PRISONERS have a stronger association with FIRE in English and
Spanish, according to the systems. All of the languages exhibit CRIME IS A DISEASE
metaphor, with Russian and Spanish also generalizing it to VIOLENCE IS A DISEASE.
Interestingly, throughout our data set, Spanish data tends to exhibit more negative
metaphors about CORPORATIONS, as it is demonstrated by the DISEASE example in
Figure 23. Although we do not claim that this output is exhaustively representative of
all conceptual metaphors present in a particular culture, we believe that these examples
showcase some interesting differences in the use of metaphor across languages that can
be discovered via large-scale statistical processing.

5.3 Identification of Metaphorical Expressions

After extracting the source–target domain mappings, we now move on to the iden-
tification of the corresponding metaphorical expressions. The system does this by
harvesting the salient features that lead to the input noun being strongly associated
with the extracted clusters. The salient features are selected by ranking the features
according to the joint probability of the feature ( f ) occurring both with the input

15 However, the level of granularity can be adapted depending on the task and application in mind.

source noun (w) and the target cluster (c). Under a simplified independence assumption,
p(w, c| f ) = p(w| f )× p(c| f ). p(w| f ) and p(c| f ) are calculated as the ratio of the frequency
of the feature f to the total frequency of the input noun and the cluster, respectively. The
features ranked higher are expected to represent the source domain vocabulary that can
be used to metaphorically describe the target concepts. Example features (verbs and
their grammatical relations) extracted for the source domain noun fire and the violence
cluster in English are shown in Figure 25.

We then refined the lists of features by means of selectional preference (SP) filtering.
Many features that co-occur with the source noun and the target cluster may be general,
that is, they can describe many different domains rather than being characteristic of the
source domain. For example, the verb start, which is a common feature for both the
fire and the violence cluster (e.g., start a war, start a fire) also co-occurs with many other
arguments in a large corpus. We use SPs to quantify how well the extracted features
describe the source domain (e.g., fire) by measuring how characteristic the domain word
is as an argument of the verb. This allows us to filter out non-characteristic verbs, such
as start in our example. We extracted nominal argument distributions of the verbs in

relations. We used the algorithm of Sun and Korhonen (2009) to create SP classes and the
measure of Resnik (1993) to quantify how well a particular argument class fits the verb.
Sun and Korhonen (2009) create SP classes by distributional clustering of nouns with
lexico-syntactic features (i.e., the verbs they co-occur with in a large corpus and their
corresponding grammatical relations). Resnik measures selectional preference strength
SR(v) of a predicate as a Kullback-Leibler distance between two distributions: the prior
probability of the noun class P(c) and the conditional probability of the noun class given
the verb P(c|v).

SR(v) = D(P(c|v)||P(c)) =
∑

c

P(c|v) log P(c|v)P(c) (20)

In order to quantify how well a particular argument class fits the verb, Resnik defines
selectional association as

AR(v, c) = 1SR(v)
P(c|v) log P(c|v)P(c) (21)

We rank the nominal arguments of the verbs in our feature lists using their selectional
association with the verb, and then only retain the features whose top five arguments
contain the source concept. For example, the verb start, which is a common feature
for both fire and the violence cluster, would be filtered out in this way because its top
five argument classes do not contain fire or any of the nouns in the violence cluster.

108



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

In contrast, the verbs flare or blaze would be retained as descriptive source domain
vocabulary.

Similarly to the spectral clustering experiments, we then search the parsed corpus
for grammatical relations, in which the nouns from the target domain cluster appear
with the verbs from the source domain vocabulary (e.g., “war blazed” (subj), “to fuel vio-

D(P (c|v)||P (c)) = ∑c P (c|v) log P (c|v)P (c) . In order to quantify how well a particular argument
class fits the verb, Resnik defines selectional association as AR(v, c) = 1SR(v)P (c|v) log

P (c|v)
P (c) .

We rank the nominal arguments of the verbs in our feature lists using their selectional association
with the verb, and then only retain the features whose top 5 arguments contain the source concept.
For example, the verb start, that is a common feature for both fire and the violence cluster (e.g.
``start a war'', ``start a fire''), would be filtered out in this way, whereas the verbs flare or blaze
would be retained as descriptive source domain vocabulary.

Similarly to the spectral clustering experiments, we then search the parsed corpus for gram-
matical relations, in which the nouns from the target domain cluster appear with the verbs from
the source domain vocabulary (e.g. ``war blazed'' (subj), ``to fuel violence'' (dobj) for the mapping
violence is fire in English). The system thus annotates metaphorical expressions in text, as well
as the corresponding conceptual metaphors, as shown in Figure 26. Metaphorical expressions
identified by the Spanish and Russian systems are shown in Figures 27 and 28 respectively.

5.4 Evaluation

We evaluated the quality of metaphorical mappings and metaphorical expressions identified by
the system against human judgements, as follows: (1) the human judges were presented with a
random sample of system-produced metaphorical mappings and metaphorical expressions, and
asked to mark the ones they considered valid as correct; (2) the human annotators were presented
with a set of source domain concepts and asked to write down all target concepts they associated
with a given source, thus creating a gold standard.

5.4 Evaluation

Because there is no large and comprehensive gold standard of metaphorical map-
pings available, we evaluated the quality of metaphorical mappings and metaphorical
expressions identified by the system against human judgments. We conducted two
types of evaluation: (1) precision-oriented, for both metaphorical mappings and
metaphorical expressions; and (2) recall-oriented, for metaphorical expressions. In the
first setting, the human judges were presented with a random sample of system-
produced metaphorical mappings and metaphorical expressions, and asked to mark
the ones they considered valid as correct. In the second setting, the human annotators
were presented with a set of source domain concepts and asked to write down all target
concepts they associated with a given source, thus creating a gold standard.

5.4.1 Baselines. We compared the system performance with that of two baseline systems:
an unsupervised agglomerative clustering baseline (AGG) for the three languages and a
supervised baseline built upon Wordnet (WN) for English.
AGG: We constructed the agglomerative clustering baseline using SciPy implementation
(Oliphant 2007) of Ward’s linkage method (Ward 1963). The output tree was cut accord-
ing to the number of levels and the number of clusters of the explicit graph detected
by HGFC. The resulting tree was then converted into a graph by adding connections
from each cluster to all the clusters one level above. We computed the connection
weights as cluster distances measured using Jensen-Shannon Divergence between the
cluster centroids. This graph was then used in place of the HGFC graph in the metaphor
identification experiments.
WN: In the WN baseline, the WordNet hierarchy was used as the underlying graph of
concepts to which the metaphor extraction method was applied. Given a source concept,
the system extracted all its sense-1 hypernyms two levels above and subsequently all of
their sister terms. The hypernyms themselves were considered to represent the literal
sense of the source noun and were therefore removed. The sister terms were kept as
potential target domains.

5.4.2 Evaluation of Metaphorical Associations. To create our data set, we extracted 10
common source concepts that map to multiple targets from the Master Metaphor List
(Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991) and linguistic analyses of metaphor (Lakoff and
Johnson 1980; Shutova and Teufel 2010). These included FIRE, CHILD, SPEED, WAR,
DISEASE, BREAKDOWN, CONSTRUCTION, VEHICLE, SYSTEM, BUSINESS. We then trans-
lated them into Spanish and Russian. Each of the systems and the baselines identified
50 source–target domain mappings for the given source domains. This resulted in a set
of 150 conceptual metaphors for English (HGFC,AGG,WN), 100 for Spanish (HGFC,AGG),
and 100 for Russian (HGFC,AGG). Each of these conceptual mappings represents a
number of submappings since all the target concepts are clusters or synsets. These were
then evaluated against human judgments in two different experimental settings.
Setting 1
Task and guidelines The judges were presented with a set of conceptual metaphors
identified by the three systems, randomized. They were asked to annotate the mappings
they considered valid as correct. In all our experiments, the judges were encouraged to
rely on their own intuition of metaphor, but they also reviewed the metaphor annotation
guidelines of Shutova and Teufel (2010) at the beginning of the experiment.

Participants Two judges per language, who were native speakers of English, Russian,
and Spanish participated in this experiment. All of them held at least a bachelor’s
degree.
Interannotator agreement The agreement on this task was measured at κ = 0.60
(n = 2, N = 150, k = 2) for English, κ = 0.59 (n = 2, N = 100, k = 2) for Spanish, and
κ = 0.55 (n = 2, N = 100, k = 2) for Russian. The main differences in the annotators’
judgments stem from the fact that some metaphorical associations are less obvious
and common than others, and thus need more context (or imaginative effort) to estab-
lish. Such examples where the judges disagreed included metaphorical mappings such
as INTENSITY is SPEED, GOAL is a CHILD, COLLECTION is a SYSTEM, and ILLNESS is a
BREAKDOWN.
Results The system performance was then evaluated against these judgments in terms
of precision (P), i.e., the proportion of the valid metaphorical mappings among those
identified. We calculated system precision (in all experiments) as an average over both
annotations. The results across the three languages are presented in Table 6.
Setting 2
To measure recall, R, of the systems we asked two annotators per language (native
speakers with a background in metaphor, different from Setting 1) to write down up to
five target concepts they strongly associated with each of the 10 source concepts. Their
annotations were then aggregated into a single metaphor association gold standard,
including all of the mappings listed by the annotators. The gold standard consisted of
63 mappings for English, 70 mappings for Spanish, and 68 mappings for Russian. The
recall of the systems was measured against this gold standard. The results are shown in
Table 6.

5.4.3 Evaluation of Metaphorical Expressions. For each of the identified conceptual meta-
phors, the systems extracted a number of metaphorical expressions from the corpus. For
the purposes of this evaluation, we selected the top 50 features from the ranked feature
list (as described in Section 5.3) and searched the corpus for expressions where the verbs
from the feature list co-occurred with the nouns from the target cluster. Figure 29 shows
example sentences annotated by HGFC for English. The identification of metaphorical
expressions was also evaluated against human judgments.
Materials The judges were presented with a set of randomly sampled sentences
containing metaphorical expressions as annotated by the systems and by the baselines
(200 each). This resulted in a data set of 600 sentences for English (HGFC, AGG, WN), 400
sentences for Spanish (HGFC, AGG), and 400 sentences for Russian (HGFC, AGG). The
order of the presented sentences was randomized.

Task and guidelines The judges were asked to mark the expressions that were
metaphorical in their judgment as correct, following the same guidelines as in the
spectral clustering evaluation.
Participants Two judges per language, who were native speakers of English, Russian,
and Spanish, participated in this experiment. All of them held at least a bachelor’s
degree.
Interannotator agreement Their agreement on the task was measured at κ = 0.56 (n =
2, N = 600, k = 2) for English, κ = 0.52 (n = 2, N = 400, k = 2) for Spanish, and κ = 0.55
(n = 2, N = 400, k = 2) for Russian.
Results The system performance was measured against these annotations in terms
of an average precision across judges. The results are presented in Table 7. HGFC out-
performs both AGG and WN, yielding a precision of 0.65 in English, 0.54 in Spanish,
and 0.59 in Russian.

5.5 Discussion and Error Analysis

As expected, HGFC outperforms both AGG and WN baselines in all evaluation settings.
AGG has been previously shown to be less accurate than HGFC in the verb clustering task
(Sun and Korhonen 2011). Our analysis of the noun clusters indicated that HGFC tends
to produce more pure and complete clusters than AGG. Another important reason AGG
fails is that it by definition organizes all concepts into a tree and optimizes its solution
locally, taking into account a small number of clusters at a time. However, being able
to discover connections between more distant domains and optimizing globally over
all concepts is crucial for metaphor identification. This makes AGG less suitable for the
task, as demonstrated by our results. However, AGG identified a number of interesting
mappings missed by HGFC (e.g. CAREER IS A CHILD, LANGUAGE IS A SYSTEM, CORRUP-
TION IS A VEHICLE, EMPIRE IS A CONSTRUCTION), as well as a number of mappings in

common with HGFC (e.g. DEBATE IS A WAR, DESTRUCTION IS A DISEASE). The fact that
both HGFC and AGG identified valid metaphorical mappings across languages confirms
our hypothesis that clustering techniques are well suited to detect metaphorical patterns
in a distributional word space.

The WN system also identified a few interesting metaphorical mappings (e.g., COG-
NITION IS FIRE, EDUCATION IS CONSTRUCTION), but its output is largely dominated
by the concepts similar to the source noun and contains some unrelated concepts.
The comparison of HGFC to WN shows that HGFC identifies meaningful properties
and relations of abstract concepts that cannot be captured in a tree-like classification
(even an accurate, manually created one such as WordNet). The latter is more appro-
priate for concrete concepts, and a more flexible representation is needed to model
abstract concepts. The fact that both baselines identified some valid metaphorical asso-
ciations, relying on less suitable conceptual graphs, suggests that our way of travers-
ing the graph is a viable approach to identification of metaphorical associations in
principle.

HGFC identifies valid metaphorical associations for a range of source concepts. One
of them (CRIME IS A DISEASE, or CRIME IS A VIRUS) happened to have been already
validated in behavioral experiments with English speakers (Thibodeau and Boroditsky
2011). The most frequent type of error of HGFC across the three languages is the pres-
ence of target clusters similar or closely related to the source noun. For instance, the
source noun CHILD tends to be linked to other “human” clusters across languages—
for example, the parent cluster for English; the student, resident, and worker clusters in
Spanish, and the crowd, journalist, and emperor clusters in Russian. The clusters from the
same domain can, however, be filtered out if their nouns frequently occur in the same
documents with the source noun (in a large corpus), that is, by topical similarity. The
latter is less likely to be the case for the metaphorically associated nouns. However, we
leave such an experiment to future work.

The system errors in the identification of metaphorical expressions stem from
multiple word senses of the salient features or the source and target sharing some
physical properties (e.g., one can “die from crime” and “die from a disease,” an error that
manifested itself in all three languages). Some identified expressions invoke a chain
of mappings (e.g., ABUSE IS A DISEASE, DISEASE IS AN ENEMY for “combat abuse”);
however, such chains are not yet incorporated into the system. In some cases, the same
salient feature could be used metaphorically both in the source and target domain (e.g.,
“to open fire” vs. “to open one’s heart” in Russian). In this example the expression is cor-
rectly tagged as metaphorical, although representing a different conceptual metaphor
than FEELING IS FIRE. The performance of AGG in the identification of metaphorical
expressions is higher than in the identification of metaphorical associations, because
it outputs only few expressions for the incorrect associations. In contrast, WN tagged
a large number of literal expressions due to the incorrect prior identification of the
underlying associations.

The performance of the Russian and Spanish systems is slightly lower than that
of the English system. This is likely to be due to errors from the data preprocessing
step (i.e., parsing). The quality of parser output in English is likely to be higher than
in Russian or Spanish, for which fewer parsers exist. Another important difference lies
in the corpora used. Whereas the English and Spanish systems have been trained on
English and Spanish Gigaword corpora (containing data extracted from news sources),
the Russian system has been trained on RuWaC, which is a Web corpus containing
a greater amount of noisy text (including misspellings, slang, etc.) The difference in
corpora is also likely to have an impact on the mappings identified—that is, different

113

target domains and different metaphorical mappings may be prevalent in different
types of data. However, because our goal is to test the capability of clustering techniques
to identify metaphorical associations and expressions in principle, the specific types
of metaphors identified from different corpora (e.g., the domains covered) are less
relevant.

Importantly, our results show that the method is portable across languages. This is
an encouraging result, particularly because HGFC is unsupervised, making metaphor
processing technology available to a large number of languages for which metaphor-
annotated data sets and lexical resources do not exist.

6. Cross-Linguistic Analysis and Metaphor Variation

By automatically discovering metaphors in a data-driven way, our methods allow us to
investigate and compare the semantic spaces of different languages and gain insights for
cross-linguistic research on metaphor. The contrastive study of differences in metaphor
is important for several reasons. Understanding how metaphor varies across languages
could provide clues about the roles of metaphor and cognition in structuring each
other (Kövecses 2004). Contrastive differences in metaphor also have implications for
second-language learning (Barcelona 2001), and thus a systematic understanding of
variation of metaphor across languages would benefit educational applications. From
an engineering perspective, metaphor poses a challenge for machine translation systems
(Zhou, Yang, and Huang 2007; Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen 2013), and can even be
difficult for human translators (Schäffner 2004).

Although some aspects of the way that metaphor structures language may be
widely shared and near-universal (Kövecses 2004), there are significant differences in
how conventionalized and pervasive different metaphors are in different languages and
cultures. The earliest analyses of cross-lingual metaphorical differences were essentially
qualitative.16 In these studies, the authors typically produce examples of metaphors
that they argue are routine and widely used in one language, but unconventionalized
or unattested in another language. Languages that have been studied in such a way
include Spanish (Barcelona 2001), Chinese (Yu 1998), Japanese (Matsuki 1995), and
Zulu (Taylor and Mbense 1998). One drawback of these studies is that they rely on the
judgment of the authors, who may not be representative of the speakers of the language
at large. They also do not allow for subtler differences in metaphor use across languages
to be exposed. One possibility for addressing these shortcomings involves manually
searching corpora in two languages and counting all instances of a metaphorical map-
ping. This is the approach taken by Charteris-Black and Ennis (2001) with respect to
financial metaphors in English and Spanish. They find several metaphors that are much
more common in one language than in the other. However, the process of manually
identifying instances is time-consuming and expensive, limiting the size of corpora and
the scope of metaphors that can be analyzed in a given time frame. As a result, it can be
difficult to draw broad conclusions from these studies.

Our systems present a step towards a large-scale data-driven analysis of linguistic
variation in the use of metaphor. In order to investigate whether statistically learned
patterns of metaphor can capture such variation, we conducted an analysis of the meta-
phors identified by our systems in the three languages. We ran the HGFC systems with
a larger set of source domains taken from the literature on metaphor and conducted a

16 See Kövecses (2004) for a review.

114



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

qualitative analysis of the resulting metaphorical mappings to identify the similarities
and the differences across languages. As one might expect, the majority of metaphor-
ical mappings identified by the systems are present across languages. For instance,
VIOLENCE and FEELINGS are associated with FIRE in all three languages, DEBATE or
ARGUMENT are associated with WAR, CRIME is universally associated with DISEASE,
MONEY with LIQUID, and so on. However, although the instances of a conceptual
metaphor may be present in all three languages, interestingly, it is often the case that the
same conceptual metaphor is lexicalized differently in different languages. For instance,
although FEELINGS are generally associated with LIQUIDS in both English and Russian,
the expression “stir excitement” is English-specific and cannot be used in Russian. At the
same time, the expression “mixed feelings” (another instantiation of the same conceptual
metaphor) is common in both languages. Our systems allow us to trace such variation
through the different metaphorical expressions that they identify for the same or similar
conceptual metaphors.

Importantly, besides the linguistic variation our methods are also able to capture
and generalize conceptual differences in metaphorical use in the three languages. For
instance, they exposed some interesting cross-linguistic differences pertaining to the
target domains of business and finance. The Spanish conceptual metaphor output man-
ifested rather negative metaphors about business, market, and commerce: BUSINESS
was typically associated with BOMB, FIRE, WAR, DISEASE, and ENEMY. Although it is
the case that BUSINESS is typically discussed in terms of a WAR or a RACE in English
and Russian, the other four Spanish metaphors are uncommon. Russian, in fact, has
rather positive metaphors for the related concepts of MONEY and WEALTH, which are
strongly associated with SUN, LIGHT, STAR, and FOOD, possibly indicating that money
is viewed primarily as a way to improve one’s own life. An example of the linguistic
instantiations of the Russian MONEY is LIGHT metaphor and their corresponding word-
for-word English translations is shown in Figure 30. We have validated that the word-
for-word English translations of the Russian expressions in the Figure are not typically
used in English by searching the BNC, where none of the expressions were found. In
contrast, in English, MONEY is frequently discussed as a WEAPON, that is, a means
to achieve a goal or win a struggle (which is directly related to BUSINESS IS A WAR
metaphor). At the same time, the English data exhibit positive metaphors for POWER
and INFLUENCE, which are viewed as LIGHT, SUN, or WING. In Russian, on the contrary,

Figure 30
Linguistic instantiations of MONEY IS LIGHT metaphor in Russian.

115



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

POWER is associated with BOMB and BULLET, perhaps linking it to the concepts of
physical strength and domination. The concepts of FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE were
also associated with a WING, WEAPON, and STRENGTH in the Russian data, however.
English and Spanish data also exhibited interesting differences with respect to the topic
of immigration. According to the system output, in English IMMIGRANTS tend to be
viewed as FIRE or ENEMIES, possibly indicating danger. In Spanish, on the other hand,
IMMIGRANTS and, more specifically, undocumented people have a stronger association
with ANIMALS, which is likely a reference to them as victims, being treated like animals.

Although these differences may be a direct result of the contemporary socio-
economic context and political rhetoric, and are likely to change over time, other
conceptual differences have a deeper grounding in our culture and way of life. For
instance, the concept of BIRTH tends to be strongly associated with LIGHT in Spanish
and BATTLE in Russian, each metaphor highlighting a different aspect of birth. The
differences that stem from highly conventional metaphors seem to be even more deeply
entrenched in the conceptual system of the speakers of a language. For instance, our
analysis of system-produced data revealed systematic differences in discussing quantity
and intensity in the three languages. Let us consider, for instance, the concept of heat.
In English, heat intensity is typically measured on a vertical scale; for example, it is
common to say “low heat” and “high heat.” In Russian, heat intensity is rather thought
of in terms of strength; for example, one would say “strong heat” or “weak fire.” As
opposed to this, Spanish speakers talk about heat in terms of its speed; for example,
“fuego lento” (literally “slow fire”) refers to “low heat” (on the stove). This metaphor
also appears to generalize to other phenomena whose level or quantity can be assessed
(e.g., INTELLIGENCE is also discussed in terms of SPEED in Spanish, HEIGHT in English,
and STRENGTH in Russian). Such a systematic variation provides new insights for the
study of cognition of quantity, intensity, and scale. Statistical methods provide a tool to
expose such variation through automatic analysis of large quantities of linguistic data.

More generally, such systematic cross-linguistic differences in the use of metaphor
have significance beyond language and can be associated with contrastive behavioral
patterns across the different linguistic communities (Casasanto and Boroditsky 2008;
Fuhrman et al. 2011). Psychologists Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011) investigated how
the metaphors we use affect our decision-making. They presented two groups of human
subjects with two different texts about crime. In the first text, crime was metaphorically
portrayed as a virus and in the second as a beast. The two groups were then asked a set
of questions on how to tackle crime in the city. As a result, the first group tended to opt
for preventive measures in tackling crime (e.g., stronger social policies), whereas the
second group converged on punishment- or restraint-oriented measures. According to
the researchers, their results demonstrate that metaphors have profound influence on
how we conceptualize and act with respect to societal issues. Although Thibodeau and
Boroditsky’s study did not investigate cross-linguistic contrasts in the use of metaphor,
it still suggests that metaphor-induced differences in decision-making may manifest
themselves across communities. Applying data-driven methods such as ours to investi-
gate variation in the use of metaphor across (linguistic) communities would allow this
research to be scaled-up, using statistical patterns learned from linguistic data to inform
experimental psychology.

7. Conclusions and Future Directions

We have presented three methods for metaphor identification that acquire metaphor-
ical patterns from distributional properties of concepts. All of the methods

116



Shutova et al. Multilingual Metaphor Processing

(UNCONSTRAINED, CONSTRAINED, HGFC) are based on distributional word clustering
using lexico-syntactic features. The methods are minimally supervised and unsuper-
vised and, as our experiments have shown, they can be successfully ported across
languages. Despite requiring little supervision, their performance is competitive even
in comparison to fully supervised systems.17 In addition, the methods identify a large
number of new metaphorical expressions in corpora (e.g., given the English seed “ac-
celerate change,” the UNCONSTRAINED method identifies as many as 113 new, different
metaphors in the BNC), enabling large-scale cross-linguistic analyses of metaphor.

Our experimental results have demonstrated that lexico-syntactic features are ef-
fective for clustering and metaphor identification in all three languages. However, we
have also identified important differences in the structure of the semantic spaces across
languages. For instance, in Russian, a morphologically rich language, the semantic
space is structured differently from English or Spanish. Because of its highly productive
derivational morphology, Russian exhibits a higher number of near-synonyms (often
originating from the same stem) for both verbs and nouns. This has an impact on cluster-
ing, in that (1) more nouns or verbs need to be clustered in order to represent a concept
with sufficient coverage and (2) the clusters need to be larger, often containing tight sub-
clusters of derivational word forms. While playing a role in metaphor identification, this
finding may also have implications for other multilingual NLP tasks beyond metaphor
research.

Importantly, our results confirm the hypothesis that metaphor and cross-domain
vocabulary projection are naturally encoded in the distributional semantic spaces in
all three languages. As a result, metaphorical mappings could be learned from distri-
butional properties of concepts using clustering techniques. The differences in perfor-
mance across languages are mainly explained by the differences in the quality of the
data and pre-processing tools available for them. However, both our quantitative results
and the analysis of the system output confirm that all systems successfully discover
metaphorical patterns from distributional information.

We have investigated different kinds of supervision: learning from a small set
of metaphorical expressions, metaphorical mappings, and without supervision. Al-
though both minimally supervised (UNCONSTRAINED, CONSTRAINED) and unsuper-
vised (HGFC) methods successfully discover new metaphorical patterns from the data,
our results indicate that minimally supervised methods achieve a higher precision. The
use of annotated metaphorical mappings for supervision at the clustering stage does not
significantly alter the performance of the system, because their patterns are already to a
certain extent encoded in the data and can be learned. However, metaphorical expres-
sions are a good starting point in learning metaphorical generalizations in conjunction
with clustering techniques.

Despite its comparatively lower performance, we believe that HGFC may prove
to be a practically useful tool for NLP applications. Because it does not require any
metaphor annotation, it can be easily applied to a new language (including low resource
languages) for which a large enough corpus and a shallow syntactic parser are avail-
able. In addition, whereas the semi-supervised CONSTRAINED and UNCONSTRAINED
methods discover metaphorical expressions somewhat related to the seeds, the range of
metaphors discovered by HGFC is unrestricted and thus considerably wider. Since the
two types of methods differ in their precision vs. their coverage, one may also consider a

17 The precision typically reported for supervised metaphor identification is in the range of 0.56–0.78, with
the highest performing systems frequently evaluated within a limited domain (Shutova 2015).

117

combination of these methods when designing a metaphor processing component for a
real-world application—or, depending on the needs of the application, one may choose
a more suitable one.

In the future, the models need to be extended to identify not only verb–subject and
verb–object metaphors, but also metaphorical expressions in other syntactic construc-
tions (e.g., adjectival or nominal metaphors). Previous distributional clustering and
lexical acquisition research has shown that it is possible to model the meanings of a
range of word classes using similar techniques (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993;
Boleda Torrent and Alonso i Alemany 2003; Brockmann and Lapata 2003; Zapirain,
Agirre, and Màrquez 2009). We thus expect our methods to be equally applicable to
metaphorical uses of other word classes and syntactic constructions. For spectral clus-
tering systems, such an extension would require incorporation of adjectival and nom-
inal modifier features in clustering, clustering adjectives, and adding seed expressions
representing a variety of syntactic constructions. The extension of HGFC would be more
straightforward, only requiring ranking additional adjectival and nominal features that
the metaphorically associated clusters in the graph share.

The results of our HGFC experiments also offer support to the cognitive science
findings on the differences in organization of abstract and concrete concepts in the
human brain (Crutch and Warrington 2005; Wiemer-Hastings and Xu 2005; Huang, Lee,
and Federmeier 2010; Adorni and Proverbio 2012). Specifically, our experiments have
shown that abstract concepts exhibit both within-domain and cross-domain association
patterns (i.e., the literal ones and the metaphorical ones) and that the respective patterns
can be successfully learned from linguistic data via the words’ distributional properties.
The metaphorical patterns that the system is able to acquire (for different languages or
different data sets) can in turn be used to guide further cognitive science and psychol-
ogy research on metaphor and concept representation more generally. In addition, we
believe that the presented techniques may have applications in NLP beyond metaphor
processing and would impact a number of tasks in computational semantics that model
the properties of and relations between concepts in a distributional space.
