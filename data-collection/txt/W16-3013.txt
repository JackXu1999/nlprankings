Abstract 

We participate in the BB3 and GE4 tasks of BioNLP-

ST 2016. In the BB3 task, we adopt word 

representation methods to improve the feature-based 

Biomedical Event Extraction System, and take the 4th 

place. In the GE4 task, based on the Uturku system, a 

two-stage method is proposed for trigger detection, 

which divides trigger detection into recognition stage 

and classification stage, using different features in 

each stage. In the edge detection, we adopt Passive-

aggressive (PA) online algorithm, then we constitute 

events by post-processing of TEES. 

1 Method 

In the BB3 task, we improve the performance of 

the biomedical event extraction by word repre-

sentation methods, which include distributed 

word representation, and Brown clusters repre-

sentation. The framework of the proposed system 

includes input data, preprocessing, feature extrac-

tion, learning & classification and output data. 

The system preprocesses the input data from 

Medline literature and BB'16, and then extracts 

the features including word representation feature, 

common feature and Brown clusters feature, 

based on SVM classifier to learn and classify. 

In the GE4 task, the system has three main 

components: trigger detection, edge detection and 

post-processing. During the trigger detection, we 

propose a two-stage method, which divides trig-

ger detection into recognition stage and classifi-

cation stage. During the recognition stage, we 

just discern the words which are trigger words, 

selecting the features that are more suitable for 

recognition; in the classification stage, we classi-

fy the triggers which are identified already, se-

lecting the features that are more helpful to clas-

sification. In the edge detection, a muti-class PA 

algorithm is used, finally the events are obtained 

by post-processing of TEES.

2 Experimental Results  

In the BB3 task, the system achieves an F-score 

of 56.38% on the development set, which is 4.38 

percentage points higher than the baseline. On the 

test set, it achieves an F-score of 47.4% on the 

BB3 event task, the result is shown as table 1. 

   In the GE4 task, the performance of our system 

is evaluated on the test dataset of the BioNLP’16 

with online evaluation. The results related to 

event extraction are listed on Table 2 and Table 3.

3 Conclusion  

In the BB3 task, our system applies distributed 

word representation and Brown clusters represen-

tation methods, and obtains better performance 

than baseline, achieving the 4th place. In the GE4 

task, we adopt a two-stage method for trigger de-

tection, which effectively avoids the situation that 

excessive negative samples are classified into 

positive samples, and the performance of the sys-

tem is improved. In addition, we select different 

features in each stage.
