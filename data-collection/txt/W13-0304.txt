Abstract 

This paper reports an effort to annotate 

modality in the Penn Chinese Treebank. 

We introduce the modals and features that 

were annotated, and describe the phases of 

our working process. Along with this, we 

address the issues in the preparation of 

annotation guidelines, and present the 

preliminary results of the first pass. Finally, 

we analyze the types of disagreement, and 

propose directions to improve consistency. 

1 Introduction 

Since its release to the public in 2000, the Penn 

Chinese Treebank (Xia et al.1999) has been 

annotated with several layers of semantic 

information such as predicate-argument structures 

and discourse connectives (Xue 2003, 2005). Our 

effort, as a part of a larger cross linguistic 

annotation project, aims to expand this body of 

work with modal annotation. 

Modality is the aspect of meaning that expresses 

states of affairs beyond the actual (Hacquard 

2011). Distinguishing between the actual versus 

modal information is necessary for a wide range of 

natural language processing (NLP) applications 

such as sentiment analysis (Wiebe et al. 2005), 

question answering (Saur   et al 2006), medical 

information extraction (Mowery et al. 2012), etc. 

In recent years, many efforts have been made to 

create resources of manually annotated modality 

information. These resources vary greatly in terms 

of what aspects of modality are annotated and how 

the features are marked. The diverse goals and 

backgrounds of the researchers determined this 

variety of annotation schemes. Hacquard and 

Wellwood (2012), for example, annotated the 

interpretation (root vs. epistemic) of modal words 

in a range of embedded contexts. Their goal is to 

answer a particular formal semantic question--

whether epistemic modals contribute to sentence 

meaning, and consequently can be embedded in 

various environments. Mowery et al. (2012) on the 

other hand, targets a particular practical problem, 

namely distinguishing negated, affirmed and 

uncertain information in medical texts. Their 

project annotated the polarity (positive vs. 

negative) of sentences, and the degree of certainty 

(moderate vs. high) associated with a statement. 

Hendrickx et al. (2012) did yet another type of 

work, which is motivated from a theoretical 

perspective, but tries to facilitate potential NLP 

research as well. Their scheme not only covers 

more semantic properties of modality (what is the 

trigger, what is its target, who is the source of the 

modality, etc.), but also has a more fine-grained 

distinction of modal values (eight main values and 

several sub-values).  

The goal of our annotation is similar to that of 

Hendrickx et al. We aim to create a resource that 

provides detailed semantic analyses to a set of 

prototypical modal expressions in Mandarin. The 

produced corpus will allow for both linguistic 

studies (e.g. the ranges of constructions a certain 

modal expression occurs) and various machine 

learning experiments.  

A secondary goal of our project is to test the 

cross-linguistic adaptability of the schema we 

adopt, which is originally developed by Rubinstein 



et al. (2013). This schema is supposed to be 

language-independent, and we applied it to 

Mandarin with minimum modification.  

Started in the fall of 2012, we have so far 

completed the first pass of annotation on 200 files 

in the Treebank which are articles from Xinhua 

newswire
[1]

. In this process, several goals are 

achieved:  

 

 We created a first draft of annotation 
guidelines by modifying the guidelines 

designed for the parallel English 

annotation task. 

 

 We calculated agreement measures for 
different granularities of various annotated 

features.  

 

 We learned of the difficulties involved in 
annotation of individual features.   

 

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we 

provide an overview of the project by outlining the 

modal inventory, the features annotated, and the 

working process. In section 3, we discuss the 

issues involved in developing guidelines. Section 4 

presents the results of the first pass of annotation, 

and section 5 discusses the disagreement patterns 

revealed by these results. Finally, we conclude the 

paper in section 6. 

2 Overview 

The annotation is carried out with MMAX2 

(Müller & Strube 2006), with a scheme of ten 

features, and an evolving modal-list. Two 

annotators are involved, and they are also 

responsible for the creation of guidelines and 

quality control.  

2.1 Working process 

Expecting constant modification of guidelines as 

well as human errors that need to be corrected 

regularly, we break the process into small rounds.  

Each round consists of around 200 files and is 

divided into four phases, (i) preprocessing of files, 

(ii) a blind double annotation, (iii) an evaluation, 

and (iv) a revision. In preprocessing, files to be 

                                                           
[1] We completed blind double annotation and evaluation, but 

have not finished error correction and guidelines revision. 

annotated are prepared, and modals in the modal-

list are pre-highlighted for the annotators. In the 

second phase, the two annotators work 

independently without discussion. In the next 

phase, disagreement is measured and analyzed. 

The inconsistent instances are retrieved and 

reconsidered. The two annotators work together to 

resolve the disagreement. In the meantime, 

guidelines are revised to account for newly 

encountered issues, while true ambiguities 

(Rubinstein 2012) will be embraced by keeping 

both annotations. After revision, the result is re-

evaluated then re-revised, until the consistency 

achieves a pre-decided threshold.

2.2 Modal list 

The initial modal-list contains 11 entries collected 

from linguistic literature, most of which are 

auxiliary verbs. In the first pass, some adverbs are 

discovered and added to the modal inventory. The 

updated modal-list is shown in Table 2; the cells 

containing the acquired modals are shaded.  

2.3 Features 

Annotators mark not only modality type but also 

the relation between a modal and various 

components of the sentence. The annotated 

features are enumerated in Table 3.

Table 4: examples of modality types 

 

Following the hierarchical classification of 

modal flavors proposed by Portner (2009), we 

consider six atomic values for modality type: 

                                                           
＊

 We have not encountered any instance both annotators mark 

as bouletic. The example is from Portner (2009), p133. 



epistemic, circumstantial, ability, deontic, bouletic 

and teleological. The last three values are subtypes 

of priority modal, while circumstantial and ability 

are subtypes of dynamic modal
*
. In cases where 

fine-grained decisions cannot be made, coarser 

categories are available for selection. For priority 

modals, in addition to the super-type priority, there 

is an option bouletic_teleological. For non-priority 

modals, there are epistemic_circumstantial and 

ability_circumstantial. These collapsed values are 

created on the basis of a pilot study run on 

Amazon‟s Mechanical Turk. (Rubinstein et al 

2012). 

    Table 4 provides descriptions and examples for 

the atomic values; instances of the coarse classes 

are shown in (2a-c):

  „Advanced stage of hepatitis B can often 

        turn to cancer.‟ 

 

Modal tokens rarely appear with all ten features. 

At minimum, modality type is specified for each 

modal, and in most cases, the prejacent of modals 

is marked as well. Other frequent features include 

background and environmental attitude. (3) 

illustrates how these features are annotated.

3 Development of Guidelines  

Because this effort is part of a larger cross 

linguistic annotation, in order to maintain 

consistency with the other project, we started by 

applying the guidelines that were originally created 

for English annotations to the Chinese annotation. 

It worked well for purely semantic features such as 

modality type and environmental polarity, but 

difficulties arise when it comes to the features 

within the syntax-semantics interface such as span 

of prejacent.  

In cases where no instructions are applicable, we 

added new specifications. In updating the 

guidelines, real examples are always included 

along with the rules. In what follows, we provide 



examples of the problems we have encountered 

and the treatments proposed.  

Modals with A-not-A forms:  In Chinese, a 

polarity question can be formed by alternating the 

main predicate of a sentence with its positive form 

(full form or the first syllable only) followed by its 

negative form. This kind of question is called an 

A-not-A question, and the form of the predicate is 

A-not-A form (Huang et al. 2009). Take (4) for 

example:  

 

(4)   Qingshaonian   ke-bu-keyi       xiyan    

        juvenile            may-not-may smoke 

„May juveniles smoke or not? „ 

 

There are two possible annotations for A-not-A 

forms. One way is to treat an A-not-A form as one 

modal. The problem of this proposal is that if it is 

one markable, then the polarity of then sentence 

will be neither negative nor positive, and thus is 

illogical. The other solution is to divide A-not-A 

into two independent modals. The drawback of this 

approach is redundancy. Since the positive and 

negative modal will share the same set of features, 

the annotation is doubled. 

    After evaluating both approaches, we adopt the 

first, i.e. A-not-A is one modal, with a minor 

modification of the scheme, namely, adding a new 

value, A-not-A, to the polarity feature.  

Potential complement: Potential complement 

construction is marked by the particle de (得), 
which appears “inside the so-called verb-result 

construction (dongjie shi) or verb-direction 

construction (dongqu shi)”. This construction “has 

a modal interpretation” (Xie 2012). The negation 

of a potential complement is formed by replacing 

de with the negation word bu (不). Compare (5) 
and (6):   
 

(5)    Zhangsan ban de  qilai  na   xiang      shu
[1] 

         Zhangsan lift DE up     that box(CL) book  

„Zhangsan can lift up the box of books.‟ 

 

(6)    Zhangsan ban bu  qilai  na   xiang      shu
 

         Zhangsan lift  not  up     that box(CL) book  

„Zhangsan cannot lift up the box of books.‟ 

 

Because the modal interpretation contributes to the 

whole construction rather than to individual 

                                                           
[1]The example is modified form Xie (2012), (1). 

components, we treat the whole form “verb de/bu 
complement” as the modal that needs to be 

annotated. Bu is also marked as the item indicating 
the negative polarity of the sentence.  

Relative clauses: The original guidelines for 

annotating modals in relative clauses specify that 

the relativizer should be included in the prejacent 

of the modal; the head noun that the relative clause 

modifies should not. Consider (7): 
 

(7)    The person [ that we might see ] is John. 

 

Relative clauses have a different structure in 

Chinese. They precede the head noun, and do not 

have a relativizer. Instead, there is a structural 

particle de which connects the relative clause to the 

nominal head.  

    We decided to exclude the particle de from the 

span of the prejacent, since it is not a part of the 

relative clause both syntactically and semantically. 

See (8): 

 

(8)  Gongsi      jueding   jiang   ke   [yingli  baiwan         

       company  decide    prep.  can  profit   million        

       yuan yishang ] de  yi    zheng tao ruanjian dui  

       yuan above     DE one whole set software  to 

       yonghu kaifang.  

       users open  

„The company decided to make open-source 

the whole set of software which can earn a 

profit of more than one million yuan.‟ 

Temporal phrases: In many cases, a temporal 

phrase is contained in the syntactic scope of a 

modal's prejacent.  Take (9) as an illustration: 

 

(9)  [Shanghai jin-nian quan nian chukou] keyi  

        shanghai this year  all   year export  may  

       [chaoguo yi bai sis hi wu yi meiyuan.] 

         exceed      14.5 billion          dollar  

 

„This year, the annual export of Shanghai may 

exceed 14.5 billion dollars.‟ 

When marking the prejacent, we do not separate 

temporal phrases, whether they are inside or 

outside the scope of the modal. The reason for this 

is because singling out temporal phrases will make 

the prejacent more fragmented than necessary.. 

You ( 有 )-X-modal-Y construction: As 
illustrated in (10), the modal-Y part expresses 

certain properties of X, and the verb you „have‟ 



expresses the existence of X. For example, in you-

fa-ke-yi, ke-yi „can-abide‟ modifies the preceding 

noun fa „law‟; and the whole phrase means „to 

have laws to abide by‟. We did not annotate the 

modals in this construction, because there is no 

settled view about its syntactic analysis: It could be 

a productive morphological template, or it could be 

a case of postposed relative clause.  

 

(10)    a. shi     women [you   fa    ke  yi] 

              make  we        have law can abide  

 „to make us have laws that we can abide by   

  (have laws to abide by)‟ 

 

          b. Ta  jintian  [you  gongzuo   yao   zuo] 

  he  today    have   work   need to do  

  „He has work that he needs to do today.‟ 

4 Results 

As described in 2.1, we will have multiple cycles 

of evaluation and revision to control the quality of 

the annotation. This section presents the result of 

the first round of evaluation.  
 

4.1 Measures of agreement 
 

We calculated inter-annotator agreement on four 

features: modality type, prejacent, background, and 

degree modifier. Other features will be evaluated 

the next step. Two measures, κ score (Cohen 1960) 

and percentage of agreed instances, are provided. 

Also note that the annotated instances vary across 

features.  

 
    FEATURE           %  OF                    κ            ANNOTATED

    Prejacent      66.5  N/A 406 (270) 

 

Table 5: agreement: multiple features 
 

We set a minimum threshold of 0.6 (Carletta 

1996) for kappa scores for the purpose of quality 

control. As shown in Table 3, the kappa scores are 

all lower than the threshold. It indicates that all the 

four features are hard to annotate, and validates the

necessity of cyclic evaluation followed by revision. 

Table 4 provides kappa scores on the agreement 

of modality type. It presents them before and after 

category collapsing per individual modal. Possible 

values of modality type are listed in Table 5.

modality types is relatively low for most of the 

modals. The majority of the scores cluster around 

0.3, while the extreme scores (=1.0 or < 0) are 

attested with low-occurrence modals. The kappa 

scores are generally improved after collapsing. 

However, some scores are still below the 0.6 

threshold. We will discuss these cases in section 5. 

Table 8 is the confusion matrix for modality 

type as marked by both annotators. We point out 

two obvious differences between Annotator A 

(columns) and Annotator B (rows):  
 

 Among the priority types, Annotator A 
prefers deontic over teleological (64:13), 

while Annotator B does not have a strong 



preference (34:30) between them.  

 

 Annotator A selects the coarse type 
epistemic_circumstantial much more often 

than Annotator B (31 vs. 3). In cases 

where the epistemic_circumstantial is 

chosen by Annotator A, Annotator B 

tended to mark the type as circumstantial 

(23/31).

5 Discussions 

To better understand annotator disagreement, we 

retrieved the full list of sentences where any of the 

four features evaluated did not agree among the 

annotators. Roughly, these instances fall into four 

classes in terms of the reason for disagreement: 

 

a) Human error: Some features are 
accidentally overlooked by one of the 

annotators, yielding disagreement. 
 

b) Vague guidelines: Lack of specification in 
the guidelines causes divergent 

annotations. The low κ of the degree 

modifier feature can mainly be attributed 

to vagueness.  

 

c) Annotator's deviation from guidelines: 
Annotators do not always correctly 

remember the individual instructions in the 

guidelines, and thus do not always follow 

them. This type of disagreement is 

commonly found in the annotation of 

background and prejacent. 

 

d) High ambiguity of the target word: we 
pointed out in the previous section that 

even with collapsed modality type, the κ 

scores of some modals are still relatively 

low. This is because they have a broader 

spectrum of meaning.

Table 9: semantic spectrums of modal inventory 

.    

Table 9 shows the distribution of modality types 

annotated for each expression. The cell is shaded if 

the corresponding type is chosen by at least one 

annotator. The darker grey cells are the majority 

types preferred by each annotator. In some cases 

the types preferred by the two annotators overlap, 



but mostly they do not. From Table 9 we can 

generalize: 

a). It is more difficult to achieve high agreement 

on the annotation of a modal‟s flavor when the 

modal has many possible interpretations. This 

coincides with naïve intuitions.   

b). If an item has both modal and non-modal 

usages (yao, hui, jiang, ke, neng), then it is likely 

that the annotation of the item will arrive at a low 

kappa score.  

Take yao and hui for illustration. These two 

words have both a modal usage and some other 

usages. The word yao can be used as an attitude 

verb meaning „want to‟. Similarly, hui can be used 

as a pure future marker without any obvious modal 

content. (11a-b) provides cases where one of the 

annotators marked the modality type of the target 

as not_set, i.e. not a modal expression. Table 10 

summarizes how often the two tokens are marked 

as non-modal by each annotator.

The effect of modal/non-modal distinction 

seems to be more significant than the distinction 

between different flavors of modality. Yet this 

observation needs to be tested with a larger data 

set.  

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, we described our effort to annotate 

various aspects of modals in Penn Chinese 

Treebank, and reported the preliminary results of 

the first pass of annotation. The results show that it 

is hard for two annotators to achieve high 

agreement not only for modality type, but also for 

prejacent, background, and degree modifier. 

Therefore, multiple cycles of evaluation and 

revision are necessary for quality control. In effect, 

our project shows that, with minor adjustments, it 

is possible to use one scheme and set of guidelines 

for cross-linguistic annotation.
