Abstract

News headlines exhibit stylistic
peculiarities. The goal of our translation
engine ‘Making Headlines in Hindi’
is to achieve automatic translation of
English news headlines to Hindi while
retaining the Hindi news headline styles.
There are two central modules of our
engine: the modified translation unit
based on Moses and a co-occurrence-
based post-processing unit. The modified
translation unit provides two machine
translation (MT) models: phrase-based
and factor-based (both using in-domain
data). In addition, a co-occurrence-based
post-processing option may be turned
on by a user. Our evaluation shows
that this engine handles some linguistic
phenomena observed in Hindi news
headlines.

1 Introduction

‘Making Headlines in Hindi’ is a web-based
translation engine for English to Hindi news
headline translation. Hindi1 is a widely
spoken Indian language and has several news
publications. The aim of our translation engine
is to translate English news headlines to Hindi
preserving the content as well as Hindi news
headline structure to the extent possible. The
engine is based on Moses2 and has two central
parts: modified translation unit and a co-
occurrence based post-processing unit. The
modified translation unit consists of phrase-
based MT (Koehn et al., 2003)) and factor-
based MT (Koehn et al., 2007). The automatic
post-processing module performs co-occurrence-
based replacement for correct sense translation

of words by replacing translation of a word
with the most frequently co-occurring translation
candidate. This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents challenges of translating
news headlines. Section 3 describes the UI
layout. Section 4 discusses technical details
of the modified translation unit while section 5
describes the post-processing module that uses co-
occurrence-based replacement of words. Finally,
Section 6 presents an evaluation of the engine
while section 7 concludes our work.

2 Challenges of News Headline
Translation

Hindi news headlines have stylistic features that
pose challenges to translation as follows:

1. S-V-O order: Hindi news headlines often
follow the S-V-O order as opposed to S-
O-V as commonly seen in Hindi sentences.
A common news headline is ‘ab EthAw
j�l m�\ Eb-k� V bnAe\g� cOVAlA (ab tihaaD
jel mein biskooT banayenge chauTala;
Now Chautala will make biscuits in Tihar
jail)’ where the verb ‘bnAe\g� (banayenge;
will make)’ preceeds the object ‘cOVAlA
(chauTala; Chautala)’.

2. Numbers for people: Use of numbers to
indicate a group of people, like in the case of
English news headlines, is also common in
Hindi news headlines. For example, the word
‘Five’ in ‘Five held for molesting woman’
stands for five people.

3. Preferred choice of words: Words that are
commonly used in news headlines are often
different from accurate translations. For
example, ‘RBI’ (abbreviation for ‘Reserve
Bank of India’) is common in English news
headlines - however, instead of using its
transliterated form, news headlines tend to

21



translate it to ‘Er)v b{\k (rizarv bank;
Reserve Bank)’ in Hindi news headlines.

4. Missing verbs: Often, verbs are also dropped
as in the case of ‘mhAk� \B m�\ a)b -g)b
s\to kF BFw (mahakumbh mein ajab-gajab
santon kii bheeD; Herds of fascinating saints
in Mahakumbh (fair))’ where a form of the
word ‘be’ has been dropped.

Output

3 UI Layout

The interface of the engine is divided into two
vertical blocks for clarity: one for input and
another for output. The input to the translation
engine consists of:

(a) Text area for English news headline(s),

(b) Option to select Phrase-based v/s Factor-based
model,

(c) Checkboxes for co-occurrence based
replacement, transliteration for OOVs
and displaying alignment table for the output:
Each of these options can be turned on/off.

While one out of the two options in (b) must
be selected, check-boxes in (c) are optional. Each
of the components stated above are described in
Section 4.

The output consists of:

(a) The best five translations obtained in Hindi

(b) A color-coded alignment table in case the
option to display the alignment table : This
helps to understand how each word got
translated and then reordered.

(c) Time taken for translation

Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the UI. Moses-
Baseline indicates the naive translation engine
while Moses-MLM-Dict is the modified phrase
model.

4 Modified Translation Unit

We implemented two translation models: phrase-
based and factor-based. The training corpus
consisted of parallel corpus obtained from (a)
Gyan-nidhi3 consisting of 2,27,123 sentences
and (b) Mahashabdkosh4 consisting of 46,825
judicial sentences. To transliterate out-of-
vocabulary words, we modified transliteration
engine provided by Chinnakotla et al. (2010). The
original transliteration was trained for Hindi to
English transliteration. For the purpose of our
engine, we re-trained this model for English to
Hindi transliteration. This section describes each
of these components.

4.1 Phrase-based Model

The Phrase-based MT model was trained using
Moses by (Koehn et al., 2007). In order to improve
the quality of translation, we modify different
components of the model in two ways. To preserve
sentence order, we use a modified language
model - a language model trained using in-domain
data consisting of 20,220 news headlines from
BBC Hindi website5 and 2,02,335 news headlines
from Dainik Bhaskar6 archives of 2010 and 2011.
The fact that this modified language model is a
better fit to the target data is highlighted by the
perplexity value obtained using SRILM toolkit
by (Stolcke, 2002). For bi-grams, the perplexity
of the Dainik Bhaskar corpus with a test news
headline corpus was 434.06 while the perplexity
of corpus consisting of tourism documents was
1205.58. Similar trend was observed in case of
tri-grams. To enrich the translation mapping table
available, we added a bilingual dictionary to the
parallel corpus used for training the translation

model. This bilingual dictionary was downloaded
from CFILT, IIT Bombay7. This dictionary
contains a total of 1,28,240 mappings and includes
words as well as phrases. The fact that this
dictionary enriches translations is observed in the
case of a news headline containing the word
‘catch-22’. This word does not occur in the
parallel news headlines. However, it gets correctly
translated to ‘jEVl (jaTil)’ according to the entry
in the dictionary.

4.2 Factor-based Model
Our Factor-based MT model uses a set of factors
along with words for translation. The factors used
on source and target side are as follows.
1) On the source side, we use POS, lemma,
tense and number. The POS tags are obtained
from Stanford POS tagger8 while the lemma are
obtained from MIT Wordnet stemmer9. Tense and
number are derived from POS tags.
2) On the target side, we use CFILT hybrid POS
tagger10 to obtain POS tags.
The factors are combined using options available
in Moses. The lemma, tense and number on the
source side generate the translated word on the
target side. On the target side, words generate POS
features. By generating best possible translations
using a POS-based target language model, we
hope to obtain translations in a POS order best
suited to the news headline domain.

5 Post-processing: Co-occurrence-based
Replacement

The engine provides an optional co-occurrence
based replacement strategy to post-process the
output. A manual evaluation showed that 14
out of 50 headlines were incorrect because of
incorrect sense of one or more words. To
overcome this problem, we implemented a post-
processing strategy that automatically edits output
obtained from the MT model using co-occurrence
statistics as found in the in-domain news headline
corpus. To elaborate how this works, consider
the English news headline ‘crpf jawan held on
molestation charge’. The translation obtained was
‘sFaArpFe' jvAn pr aAyoEjt u(pFwn
cAj (crpf jawaan par aayojit utpiDan chaarj;

morph/WordnetStemmer.html

molestation charge organized on crpf jawan)’.
The word ‘held’ gets translated to ‘aAyoEjt
(aayojit; organized/conducted)’ as opposed to
‘Egr�tAr (giraftar; arrested)’. The language
model relies on n-grams and hence, does not
take into account the correct sense of words in
cases where the words do not occur together. For
this purpose, we implemented a post-processing
strategy that considers co-occurrence statistics of
a target word with all other words in the sentence
to find the best sense translation. In case of
the above example, using the co-occurrences in a
news headline corpus, we select the sense of ‘held’
in Hindi which occurs most frequently with other
words and replace the word with this translation.
We do not consider co-occurrence statistics for
function words. We understand that the above
strategy does not work in the case of inflected
forms of words in Hindi.

6 Evaluation

We evaluated the engine using a test set of
787 headlines downloaded from the website of a
popular English daily, The Hindu11 and manually
translated into Hindi by native speakers. A
BLEU score of 13.40 is obtained for phrase-based
MT and 5.73 for factor-based MT. In order to
understand how the engine performs for different
kinds of linguistic phenomena, we also performed
a qualititative evaluation of the output. The
following are examples of output from our engine.
They handle different linguistic phenomena as
follows:

1. Ambiguity:
Input: Industrialist remembered
Output: uogpEt ko yAd EkyA
(udyogpati ko yaad kiyaa;

Industrialist remembered)
The input sentence in domains other than
news headlines is ambiguous as it could mean
that either an industrialist was remembered
or an industrialist remembered something. In
case of news headline, however, the former
holds true. This is correctly reflected in the
Hindi translation.

2. S-V-O order:
Input: Now Jaganmohan will make biscuits in jail
Output: ab jgmohn kr�\g� Eb-k� V j�l m�\
(ab jaganmohan karenge biskoot jel mein;

Now Jaganmohan will do biscuits in jail)

The verb ‘will do’ gets placed correctly in
the target sentence thus preserving the verb
order. However, the translation ‘karenge (will
do)’ is incorrect and must be ‘banaange (will
make)’.

3. Numbers for people:
Input: Five killed in bomb blast
Output: pA\c bm Ev-PoV m�\ mAr� gy�
(paanch bum visfot mein maare gaye;

Five killed in bomb blast)
The output sentence is a perfect translation
and correctly translates ‘five’ as ‘paanch’.
However, the news headline order is not
retained in this case.

4. Missing verbs:
Input: Veteran journalist dead
Output: Ed`gj p/kAr m� t
(diggaj patrakaar mrut;

Veteran journalist dead)
The output sentence is a perfect translation
although a form of ‘be’ is absent in the source
sentence.

5. Translation of idioms:
Input: Croatia and Serbia bury the hatchet
Output: oEVyA aOr sEbyA )gwA �tm krnA
(kroatia aur serbia jhagDa khatam karna;

Croatia and Serbia do-end-quarrel)
The idiom ‘bury the hatchet’ gets correctly
translated to ‘)gwA �tm krnA; jhagDa
khatam karna; to end a quarrel’ as a
complete entity. This is a direct mapping
from the bilingual dictionary and does not
have the correct inflection.

6. Sense correction due to co-occurrence
based replacement:

Input: No hike in AMU tuition fees
Moses-MLM-Dict: amu a@yApn 'Fs m�\ koI v� E
nhF\

(amu adhyaapan fees mein koi pad-yaatra;

hike (trek) in AMU tuition fees)

Moses-CoOcc: amu Ef"Z "�/ m�\ koI v� E nhF\
(amu shikshan fees mein koi vriddhi;

hike (increase) in AMU tuition fees)
We observe that our post-processing unit
improves the output in some cases. The
original output translates ‘hike’ as ‘pdyA/A
(pad-yaatra ; hike)’. The co-occurrence-
based replacement unit identifies and corrects
the sense to ‘v� E (vriddhi; increase)’. We

understand that the ‘no’ gets missed out in
the translation.

7 Conclusion & Future Work

We presented ‘Making headlines in Hindi’, a
translation engine that aims to translate English
news headlines to Hindi while preserving news
headline styles in the target language. Our
engine includes a phrase-based model and a
factor-based model. The phrase-based model uses
an in-domain language model and a bilingual
dictionary. The factor-based model uses factors
like POS, lemma, tense and number. In addition,
we also described our post-processing strategy
that performs co-occurrence-based replacement of
words to obtain correct sense of target language
words. An evaluation of the output of our
translation engine shows that it performs well
for many linguistic styles used in Hindi news
headlines.

The co-occurrence-based strategy is naive. As
a future work, co-occurrence-based strategy can
be improved to incorporate inflections of words.
Also, other approaches to improve translation
quality may be considered.
