Abstract      

 

Semi-automatic analysis of digital speech collections is transforming the science of phonetics, 

and offers interesting opportunities to researchers in other fields. Convenient search and analysis 

of large published bodies of recordings, transcripts, metadata, and annotations – as much as three 

or four orders of magnitude larger than a few decades ago – has created a trend towards “cor-

pus phonetics,” whose benefits include greatly increased researcher productivity, better coverage 

of variation in speech patterns, and essential support for reproducibility.  

The results of this work include insight into theoretical questions at all levels of linguistic 

analysis, as well as applications in fields as diverse as psychology, sociology, medicine, and 

poetics, as well as within phonetics itself. Crucially, analytic inputs include annotation or cate-

gorization of speech recordings along many dimensions, from words and phrase structures to 

discourse structures, speaker attitudes, speaker demographics, and speech styles. Among the 

many near-term opportunities in this area we can single out the possibility of improving parsing 

algorithms by incorporating features from speech as well as text. 

Biography 

Mark Liberman is the Christopher H. Browne Professor of Linguistics at the University of Pennsyl-

vania, as well as Professor of Computer and Information Science, Faculty Director of Ware College 

House, and Director of the Linguistic Data Consortium. Before moving to Penn, he was member of 

technical staff and head of the Linguistics Research Department at AT&T Bell Laboratories from 1975 

to 1990. He is a fellow of the Linguistic Society of America and the American Association for the Ad-

vancement of Science, and co-editor of the Annual Review of Linguistics.  

He received the Antonio Zampolli Prize from the European Language Resources Association in 2010, 

and the IEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award in 2017.  

His current research focuses on features of speech, language, and communicative interaction that are 

associated with neuropsychological categories and with relevant dimensions of variation in the popula-

tion at large.
