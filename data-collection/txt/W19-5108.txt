Abstract

A substantial body of research has demon-
strated that native speakers are sensitive to the
frequencies of multiword sequences (MWS).
Here, we ask whether and to what extent
intermediate-advanced L2 speakers of English
can also develop the sensitivity to the statistics
of MWS. To this end, we aimed to replicate
the MWS frequency effects found for adult na-
tive language speakers based on evidence from
self-paced reading and sentence recall tasks
in an ecologically more valid eye-tracking
study. L2 speakers’ sensitivity to MWS fre-
quency was evaluated using generalized linear
mixed-effects regression with separate mod-
els fitted for each of the four dependent mea-
sures. Mixed-effects modeling revealed sig-
nificantly faster processing of sentences con-
taining MWS compared to sentences contain-
ing equivalent control items across all eye-
tracking measures. Taken together, these find-
ings suggest that, in line with emergentist ap-
proaches, MWS are important building blocks
of language and that similar mechanisms un-
derlie both native and non-native language
processing.

1 Introduction

1.1 Emergentist approaches and statistical
learning

A widely held assumption in the language sci-
ences, including psycholinguistics, has long been
the ‘words and rules’ view (Levelt, 1993; Jackend-
off and Jackendoff, 2002; Pinker, 1999): In this
view, speakers/writers generate sentences by com-
bining words according to the grammatical rules
of their language, and listeners/readers compre-
hend sentences by looking up words in their men-
tal lexicon and combining them using the same
rules. This view has been challenged recently by
an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating
that language users are highly sensitive not only to

the frequencies of individual words but also to the
frequencies of word sequences (see, e.g., Chris-
tiansen and Arnon, 2017, for a recent overview).
This questions the strict compartmentalization be-
tween the lexicon as a storage of individual words
and a grammar as a set of rules or constrained used
to combine them.

Moving away from the traditional ‘words and
rules’ approach, emergentist approaches have put
forward alternative theoretical models of lan-
guage. Following the literature (see, e.g. Arnon
and Snider, 2010; Kidd et al., 2017; MacWhin-
ney and O’Grady, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2013),
we use the term ‘emergentist’ as a cover term
for a broad class of approaches to language in-
cluding usage-based (a.k.a. experience-based)
models, constraint-based approaches, exemplar-
based models and connectionist models (for more
general overviews, see, e.g., Beckner et al.,
2009; Christiansen and Chater, 2016a,b; Ellis and
Larsen-Freeman, 2006; Ellis, 2019; MacWhin-
ney, 2012; McClelland et al., 2010). Distinct
from nativist/generative approaches, emergentist
approaches share the folowing two central as-
sumptions: First, emergentist approaches eschew
the existence of Universal Grammar and instead
emphasize that language is learnable via general
cognitive mechanisms. Second, these approaches
put the emphasis on usage and/or experience with
language and assume a direct and immediate re-
lationship between processing and learning, con-
ceiving of them as inseparable rather than gov-
erned by different mechanisms (‘two sides of the
same coin’). In these approaches, language acqui-
sition is viewed as learning how to process effi-
ciently (see, the ‘learning-as-processing’ assump-
tion, Chang, Dell, and Bock, 2006; see also ‘lan-
guage acquisition as skill learning’ Chater and
Christiansen, 2018). One of the major advances
in the language sciences across theoretical orienta-



61

tions has been the recognition that language con-
sists of complex, highly variable patterns occur-
ring in sequence, and as such can be described
in terms of statistical or distributional relations
among language units (see, e.g., Redington and
Chater, 1997). Thus, learning a language heav-
ily involves figuring out the statistics inherent in
language input. This is supported by a large body
of evidence from the literature on statistical learn-
ing. Statistical learning – defined as the mecha-
nism by which language users discover the pat-
terns inherent in the language input based on its
distributional properties – has been shown to facil-
itate the acquisition of various aspects of language
knowledge, including phonological learning (e.g.,
Maye et al., 2008; Thiessen and Saffran, 2003),
word segmentation (e.g., Onnis et al., 2008; Saf-
fran et al., 1996), learning the graphotactic and
morphological regularities of written words (e.g.,
Pacton et al., 2005), learning to form syntactic and
semantic categories and structures (e.g., Lany and
Saffran, 2010; Saffran and Wilson, 2003; Thomp-
son and Newport, 2007). Furthermore, an impres-
sive body of evidence has been accumulating over
the last years indicating a close relationship be-
tween individual differences in statistical learning
ability and variation in native language learning in
both child and adult L1 populations (e.g., Conway
et al., 2010; Kidd and Arciuli, 2016; Misyak and
Christiansen, 2012; Siegelman and Frost, 2015),
and in adult L2 populations (e.g., Ettlinger et al.,
2016; Frost et al., 2013; Onnis et al., 2016). Thus,
from an emergentist perspective, language acqui-
sition is essentially an ‘intuitive statistical learning
problem’ (Ellis, 2008, p. 376).

Emergentist approaches have developed a grow-
ing interest in the role of multiword sequences
(henceforth MWS), also commonly referred to as
’formulaic sequences’ (Wray, 2013). MWS are
succinctly defined as variably-sized compositional
recurring sequence patterns comprised of multiple
words (for a recent overview, see Arnon and Chris-
tiansen, 2017). Three mechanisms that have been
proposed to underpin frequency effects specifi-
cally in learning word sequences are described as
follows (Diessel, 2007): [1] increased frequency
causes the strengthening of linguistic representa-
tions, [2] increased frequency causes the strength-
ening of expectations and [3] increased frequency
leads to the automatization of chunks. The fre-
quency with which building blocks of language

occur is thus a driving force behind chunking and,
all else being equal, each exposure to a given se-
quence of words (sounds or graphemes) will affect
its subsequent processing. But why is there a need
for chunking? To ameliorate the effects of the
‘real-time’ constraints on language processing im-
posed by the limitations of human sensory system
and human memory in combination with the con-
tinual deluge of language input (cf., Christiansen
and Chater, 2016a,b, for the ‘Now-or-Never bot-
tleneck’), through constant exposure to (both au-
ditory and visual) language input, humans learn
to rapidly and efficiently recode incoming infor-
mation into larger sequences. The fact that lan-
guage is abundant in statistical regularities at mul-
tiple levels of language representations and that
humans are able to detect such regularities via sta-
tistical learning allows for such chunking to take
place. The by-products of statistical learning and
chunking enable anticipatory language processing
humans rely on to integrate the greatest possible
amount of available information as fast as pos-
sible. Processing a MWS as a chunk will min-
imize memory load and speed up integration of
the MWS with prior context (see, a chunk-based
computational model presented in a recent study
by McCauley and Christiansen, 2019).

1.2 MultiWord Frequency Effects in Online
Processing

There is now an extensive body of evidence
demonstrating that language users are sensitive
to the input frequency across all levels of lin-
guistic analysis (Ellis, 2002; Diessel, 2007; Juraf-
sky, 2003). An accumulating body of evidence
now suggests that frequency effects also extend
to the processing of MWS. Children and adults
are shown to be sensitive to the statistics of MWS
and rely on knowledge of such statistics to facil-
itate language processing and boost their acquisi-
tion (for overviews, see, Christiansen and Arnon,
2017; Shaoul and Westbury, 2011).

In the area of native language processing, a
number of comprehension and production stud-
ies have provided evidence of processing advan-
tages for MWS over non-MWS (see, e.g., Arnon
and Snider, 2010; Bannard and Matthews, 2008;
Conklin and Schmitt, 2012; Durrant and Doherty,
2010; Tremblay et al., 2011). Many of these
studies follow an approach where the target stim-
uli are restricted to a certain frequency thresh-



62

old. The threshold-approach studies aimed to de-
termine whether and to what extent MWS – i.e.,
more precisely ‘lexical bundles’ (LB)– are pro-
cessed faster over less frequent counterparts (non-
LB). The stimulus material is typically derived
from language corpora based on predefined fre-
quency criteria, while sequences differing in fre-
quency matched on other properties were created
as control stimuli. Biber and Conrad (1999) pro-
posed that for a sequence of words to be con-
sidered to be considered a MWS, it must occur
at least ten times per million in a corpus for se-
quences between two and four words long, and at
least five times per million for longer sequences.
Among these studies, (Tremblay et al., 2011) is the
most relevant for the purposes of the present study.
They created a dichotomous category for their
stimuli based on Biber’s threshold criteria. Their
sequences were matched on words in non-final
position. Rather than presenting isolated phrases
they embedded their sequences in the full senten-
tial context, as in I sat in the middle of the bullet
train. To examine sequence reading performance
Tremblay et al. conducted three self-paced reading
experiments: word-by-word reading, portion-by-
portion reading and whole sentence reading. The
three self-paced reading experiments showed that
LBs have an online processing facilitatory effects
over equivalent NLBs, i.e. in all of these exper-
iments, sentences with LB were read faster than
those with non-LB. The magnitude of the whole-
string frequency effect increased with the length
of the presentation window (i.e. word-by-word:
∼ 50 − 65ms; portion-by-portion: ∼ 120ms;
sentence-by-sentence: ∼ 380ms). The authors in-
terpreted this incremental facilitatory effect as be-
ing linked to an increased opportunity to “skip”
words.
While there has been an increased interest in the
role of MWS in L2 online processing, most of
the available research has focused on either non-
compositional phrases, i.e. idioms (e.g. kick
the bucket) or shorter compositional MWS includ-
ing binomials (e.g. bride and groom) or collo-
cations,, i.e. frequently recurring two-word se-
quences (e.g. perfectly natural) (see, Conklin and
Schmitt, 2012, for a review). However, much
less is known whether and to what extent adult
L2 speakers can develop sensitivities to the fre-
quency of compositional – i.e. syntactically reg-
ular and semantically transparent – MWS larger

than two words. The few existing studies have
produced inconsistent results: Some studies found
frequency effects in processing of MWS in non-
native speakers (e.g. Jiang and Nekrasova, 2007),
whereas other studies found no such effects (e.g.
Babaei et al., 2015). In addition, these previ-
ous studies have demonstrated frequency effects
of MWS in a lexical (phrasal) decision task and/or
acceptability judgment tasks using a self-paced
reading paradigm.

1.3 The Present Study

As reviewed above, a processing advantage for
MWS in native speakers is well attested. However,
much less is known whether this extends to non-
native (L2) speakers. The few existing L2 studies
that have addressed this question have produced
mixed results. The main goal of the present study
is to replicate the processing advantage of MWS
found for adult native language speakers based on
evidence from self-paced reading and sentence re-
call tasks (Tremblay et al., 2011) in an ecologi-
cally more valid eye-tracking study in a group of
L2 speakers. Eye movements of thirty participants
were recorded using both early and late measures
(first fixation duration, first-pass reading time, to-
tal reading time and fixation count). In line with
emergentist accounts we predict that L2 speakers
are sensitive to the statistics of MWS – to the fre-
quencies of lexical bundles (LBs) – as evident in
faster reading times across these four eye-tracking
measures.

2 Method

2.1 Participants

Thirty L1 German L2 speakers of English (27 fe-
male) at the RWTH Aachen University partici-
pated in the study. There were 27 female and 3
male (mean age = 24.5; SD = 5.1). All par-
ticipants had normal or corrected to normal vi-
sion. The L2 speakers were classified as having
a Common European Framework (CEF) English
proficiency level of upper intermediate (CEF =
B2) or lower advanced (CEF = C1) based on their
institutional status (educational background) and
their scores on Lexical Test for Advanced Learners
of English (LexTALE; Lemhöfer and Broersma,
2012): an English vocabulary size test that is of-
ten used to estimate the CEF proficiency level.
In addition, our participants completed the Lan-
guage Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire



63

(LEAP-Q; Marian et al., 2007). Table 1 reports de-
tails on age of English acquisition, exposure, and
proficiency of the L2 speakers group. The tested
L2 group reached an average LexTALE score of
79.68, supporting their classification as interme-
diate to advanced. Regarding their English ac-
quisition, the L2 speakers started learning En-
glish around the age of 9 and reported to have ac-
quired fluency at around 15 years of age. On aver-
age, their current experience with English comes
mainly from reading (mean score of 8.32 out of
10), watching TV (mean score of 7.61 out of 10)
and listening to music (mean score of 6.55 out of
10). Self-ratings of their English language profi-
ciency based on a 10-point scale were relatively
high (all mean scores greater 7.5).

2.2 Material
We used the same stimulus material as in Trem-
blay et al. (2011). This material comprised of pairs
of short sentences (mean length of sentences = 8.5
words (SD = 0.7)) that differed in exactly one
word. An example of such a pair is presented in
(1a) and (1b):

1a I sat in the middle of the bullet train.

1b I sat in the front of the bullet train.

The underlined portions in the sentences mark
an MWS of either four or five words. The words
in bold print are the words that distinguish MWS
that are lexical bundles (LBs) – here in the mid-
dle of the – from those that are not (NLBs) – here
in the front of the. Following Biber and Conrad
(1999), the distinction of ‘lexical bundlehood’ was
based on the frequencies of the MWS obtained
from the spoken subcorpus of the BNC with fre-
quency thresholds set to at least 10 occurrences
per million words (for four-grams) and 5 occur-
rences per million (for five-grams). As shown in
(1a) and (b), the MWS – LBs or NLBs – were em-
bedded after the second word of the sentence and
were followed by two more words. The frequency
of the words occurring before and after the MWS
were controlled. The sentence material comprised
a total of 20 such pairs – 40 sentences containing
LBs and NLBs – as well as 40 filler sentences (20
of which made sense and 20 were nonsensical).
The sentence material was split into two counter-
balanced lists, list A and list B, each of which con-
tained 10 sentences that contained LBs, 10 sen-
tences that contained NLBs, 10 filler sentences
that were meaningful, and 10 filler sentences that
were nonsensical. A complete list of the stimulus
material can be found in Tremblay et al. (2011).

2.3 Procedure

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
groups. Group one was first presented list A, fol-
lowed by a thirty minute break, followed by list
B. Group 2 was presented with the two lists in
reversed order. The sentences were presented on
a 23-inch TFT monitor (resolution: 1920 x 1080
pixels) in pseudorandomised order, i.e. order of
presentation was randomly determined but then
kept constant across groups. Participants were in-
structed to read the sentences for comprehension
silently and at their own pace. Each trial consisted
of the following steps. The participants saw an as-
terisk in the center of the screen (font: Arial bold;
size: 100). When ready, the participants pressed a
key to see the first sentence, which was then dis-
played in a single line with black 30-point font
characters on a white background at the centre.
Once they had finished reading the sentence, par-
ticipants pressed a key to see the next one. Each
trial ended with a simple yes-no question specific
to the sentence to ensure that the participants ac-



64

tually read and processed the material. Eye move-
ments were recorded using a Tobii Tx300 remote
eye tracker that records binocular gaze data at
300 Hz and filtered with the Tobii fixation filter
with standard settings (velocity threshold = 30 pix-
els/sample; distance threshold). The experiment
took about 15 minutes (incl. calibration and ex-
planation).

2.4 Statistical analysis

Eye movements were analyzed based on data col-
lected from four measures: (1) first fixation du-
ration (FFD), i.e. time spent initially fixating the
MWS region, (2) first pass reading time (FPRT),
i.e. sum of all the fixations made in the MWS re-
gion until the point of fixation leaves the region,
(3) total reading time (TRT), i.e. sums all fix-
ation times made within a MWS region, includ-
ing those fixations made when re-reading the re-
gion and (4) the number of regressive saccades
into the MWS region (COUNT).1 L2 speakers’
sensitivity to MWS frequency was evaluated us-
ing mixed-effect regression models implemented
with the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2014) in the
R environment (R Core Team, 2018). Separate
models were fitted for each of the four dependent
measures gathered in the eye-tracking experiment
(FFD, FPRT, TRT, COUNT). Fixation times were
logged (natural log) to reduce the nonnormality
of their distributions. In each model, the depen-
dent measure was regressed onto the predictor lex-
ical bundlehood (dummy coded: LB vs. NLB).
In addition, two control variables (length of MWS
(in characters) and participants’ LexTALE scores,
a measure of L2 vocabulary size) were entered
into each model as fixed effects. All models had
the maximal random-effects structure justified by
the design (Barr et al., 2013), which included by-
subject random intercepts and slopes for lexical
bundlehood as well as random intercepts for items.

3 Results

Prior to the analyses, – for each eye tracking mea-
sure – all trials that were more than 2 standard
deviations above or below the participant’s mean

1FFD and FPRT are ‘early measures’ that are indicative
of early processes during reading (e.g. familiarity checks,
access to orthographic/phonological information and lexical
meaning, cf. Reichle et al., 1998). TRT and COUNT are ‘late
measures’ taken to reflect later processes (e.g. reanalysis of
information, integration of information in discourse and re-
covery from processing difficulties; cf. Rayner, 1998).

score were removed. This led to a loss of data of
about 5% (4.9% for FFD, 4.4% for FPRT, 4.7%
for TTR, and 4.8% for COUNT). Figure 1 shows
the distributions of all four eye-tracking depen-
dent measures for multiword sequences (MWS)
that are lexical bundles (LB; left) and those that
are not lexical bundles (NLB; right). The plots in
Figure 1 suggest a processing advantage of MWS
that are LB over those that are NLB for three
out of the four eye tracking measures. On av-
erage, participants exhibited shorter total reading
times (TRT) (LB: M = 1397.59, SD = 672.38,
Median = 1283.00; NLB: M = 1752.64,
SD = 730.06, Median = 1681.50), shorter first
pass reading times (FPRT) (LB: M = 800.75,
SD = 374.76, Median = 766; NLB: M =
1002.61, SD = 490.85, Median = 943) and
a smaller number of regressive saccades to the
region of interest (COUNT) (LB: M = 6.46,
SD = 3.04, Median = 6; NLB: M = 7.82,
SD = 3.36, Median = 8). The duration of
first fixation (FFD) was about the same across LBs
and NLBs (LB : M = 222.44, SD = 63.04,
Median = 219; NLB: M = 232.38, SD =
62.25, Median = 221.92).

The results of the mixed effects models are pre-
sented in Table 2. The top part of Table 2 presents
the information regarding the effects of our key
predictor variable, lexical bundlehood, and the two
control variables, MWS length (in characters) and
LexTALE scores. The ‘Intercept’ row lists the
mean fixation times (for the TRT, FPRT and FFD
measures) and regressive saccade count (for the
COUNT measure) for LBs on the log scale. The
‘NLB’ row indicates the difference in log fixation
times – or, in the case of the COUNT model, re-
gressive saccade counts – between LBs and NLBs.
The results show that – for all dependent vari-
ables except FFD, which only approached sig-
nificance – lexical bundlehood was found to be
a significant predictor of eye movements, even
after controlling for the effects of MWS length
and LexTALE scores: Participants were signif-
icantly faster in processing sentences containing
LBs compared to sentences containing equivalent
control items with NLBs NLBTRT : estimate =
0.33, SE = 0.09, t = 3.9, p < 0.001). After
accounting for the effects of length and L2 pro-
ficiency and adjusting for the individual variation
between subjects and items, sentences with LBs
were read (exp(6.76 + 0.33)− exp(6.76) =) 339

ms faster on average. In comparison, (Tremblay
et al., 2011) report a processing advantage of LB
of 380ms in their self-paced reading time study
(sentence-by-sentence presentation) on native En-
glish speakers . First pass reading times (FPRT)
of LBs were (exp(6.13 + 0.33) − exp(6.13) =)
181 ms faster (NLBFPRT : estimate = 0.33,
SE = 0.08, t = 4.41, p < .001). Re-
garding the COUNT measure, the model pre-
dicted an average increase of (exp(1.544 + 0.281)
-exp(1.544)=) 1.52 regressive saccades for NLBs
relative to LBs (NLBCOUNT : estimate = 0.28,
SE = 0.08, t = 3.58, p < .001). The
difference in first fixation duration between LBs
and NLB was just over (exp(5.316 + 0.056) −
exp(5.316) =) 11ms, which was marginally sig-
nificant (NLBFFD: estimate = 0.06, SE =
0.01, t = 1.81, p = 0.07)). The bottom part of
Table 2 presents the variability in the data that is
attributable to random effects (e.g. some partic-
ipants exhibited overall faster reading times than
others). We found that – across the four eye track-
ing measures - there was a relatively large amount
of variability in reading speed between partici-
pants (TRT: SD = 0.47, FPRT: SD = 0.39;
FFD: SD = 0.09; COUNT: 0.42) and relatively
little between items (TRT: SD = 0.16, FPRT:
SD = 0.0.09; FFD: SD = 0; COUNT: 0.15).
The standard deviation for the by-subject random
slopes for lexical bundlehood were minimal (all
SD < 0.2), indicating that the LB effect was con-
sistent across subjects. This pattern of results is
line with the results reported in (Tremblay et al.,
2011).

4 Discussion

The main goal of the present study was to de-
termine whether non-native (L2) speakers can
develop sensitivity to the statistics of composi-

tional multiword sequences (MWS) larger than
two words. To this end, the study aimed to repli-
cate the processing advantage of such sequences
found for native speakers (Tremblay et al., 2011)
in a group of L2 speakers of English. As re-
viewed in Section 1, (Tremblay et al., 2011)per-
formed three self-paced reading studies to inves-
tigate the facilitatory effects of lexical bundles
(LBs) and found that the magnitude of the whole-
string frequency effect increased with the length
of the presentation window. We were able to
replicate the MWS frequency effects using eye-
tracking methodology: Mixed-effects modeling
revealed that lexical bundlehood was a significant
predictor of eye movements, even after controlling
for the effects of MWS length and LexTale scores
and after adjusting for the individual variation be-
tween subjects and items: Participants were signif-
icantly faster in processing sentences containing
LBs compared to sentences containing equivalent
control items with NLBs for all dependent vari-
ables except first fixation duration (FFD), which
approached significance (p < 0.1). Similar results
were reported in a recent eye-tracking study on
the online processing of multiword sequences in
Chinese (see, Yi et al., 2017) where significant or
marginally significant effects of MWS frequency
were found in the eye movement measures also in-
vestigated in the present study. Like the present
study, (Yi et al., 2017) found that the effect of
FFD on reading times was marginally significant.
The findings reported here are thus consistent with
the results reported in previous L2 studies (El-
lis, 2008; Durrant and Schmitt, 2009; Hernández
et al., 2016; Jiang and Nekrasova, 2007; Kerz
and Wiechmann, 2017; Siyanova-Chanturia et al.,
2011). Our study thus provides additional evi-
dence in support of the hypothesis that similarly
to native speakers, non-native speakers can also

develop the sensitivity to the statistics of MWS.
At a more general theoretical level, the results of
the present study are consistent with emergentist
accounts that challenge dual-system views of lan-
guage and instead argue for single-systems of lan-
guage. More importantly, the results indicate that
similarities between L1 and late L2 learning are
more striking than the differences and, therefore,
that unified theoretical models rather than separate
ones are needed to account for the mechanisms
used for L1 and L2 learning (see, e.g., MacWhin-
ney, 2017). Emergentist accounts have proposed
such mechanisms, namely that of statistical learn-
ing and chunking (see Section 1.1 for more de-
tails). Sensitivity to the statistics of multiword
sequences facilitates chunking - required to inte-
grate the greatest possible amount of available in-
formation as fast as possible so at to overcome the
fleeting nature of linguistic input and the limited
nature of our memory for sequences of linguistic
input (Now-or-Never bottleneck, see Christiansen
and Chater, 2016a).

Some of the questions left open by the current
study may provide interesting avenues for future
work. First, we investigated sensitivity to ‘sim-
ple statistics‘ – i.e. corpus-derived frequencies –
of MWS in non-native speakers. The question
arises whether similar results could be obtained
for ‘more complex’ distributional statistics using
association measures, such as transitional proba-
bility or mutual information or using information-
theoretic measures, such as entropy as well as
measures that capture the variability of MWS.
Second, the stimulus material used in this study
was derived from a corpus representing spoken
language. In the light of growing evidence that the
statistics of written input play a crucial role in the
development of linguistic knowledge – as it pro-
vides a source of substantial change in the statis-
tics of an individual’s language experience (Sei-
denberg and MacDonald, 2018) – it would be im-
portant to determine whether language users can
’tune to’ multiple statistics inherent in different
registers/genres. And, third, it would be impor-
tant to determine whether the ability to tune to the
statistics of MWS is subject to individual differ-
ences, and if so, to what extent these differences
are linked to a host of experience-related, cogni-
tive and affective factors.
