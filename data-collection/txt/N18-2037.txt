Abstract

Semantic Verbal Fluency tests have been used
in the detection of certain clinical conditions,
like Dementia. In particular, given a sequence
of semantically related words, a large num-
ber of switches from one semantic class to an-
other has been linked to clinical conditions.
In this work, we investigate three similarity
measures for automatically identify switches
in semantic chains: semantic similarity from
a manually constructed resource, and word as-
sociation strength and semantic relatedness,
both calculated from corpora. This informa-
tion is used for building classifiers to distin-
guish healthy controls from clinical cases with
early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild
Cognitive Deficits. The overall results indi-
cate that for clinical conditions the classifiers
that use these similarity measures outperform
those that use a gold standard taxonomy.

1 Introduction
In the diagnosis of clinical conditions, language pro-
duction along with socio-educational and cognitive fac-
tors have been regarded as providing important clues
about the health of the semantic memory and of the
mental lexicon (Troyer et al., 1998). Some neuropsy-
chiatric protocols for the assessment of clinical condi-
tions like Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cogni-
tive Deficits (MCD) often adopt Semantic Verbal Flu-
ency (SVF) (Zhao et al., 2013), since linguistic impair-
ments in such conditions are most likely located at the
semantic level (Taler and Phillips, 2008). In these tests
participants are asked to produce words related to a
given theme (e.g. animals or supermarket items) in a
short period of time (e.g. one minute) avoiding repe-
titions. The answers tend to contain subgroups (Bous-
field and Sedgewick, 1944), referred to as clusters and
their borders as switches. For instance, a sequence like
dog, mouse, cat, horse, pig, and cow could be divided
into two clusters with a switch: pets (dog, mouse, and
cat) and farm animals (horse and pig). Clues like the
size of semantic clusters and the number of switches
(Troyer et al., 1998) have been correlated with clinical

conditions (Murphy et al., 2006; Pekkala et al., 2008;
Price et al., 2012; Bertola et al., 2014b), and, in some
cases, data derived from SVF tests have indicated de-
mentia five years before its onset (Raoux et al., 2008).

The analysis of clusters and switches requires man-
ual annotation by specialists, based on preexisting man-
ually constructed taxonomies, in a process that can be
very time consuming and prone to coverage limitations.
In this paper we investigate three similarity measures
for detecting switches in word sequences: semantic
similarity using a manually constructed resource, as
well as word association strength and semantic relat-
edness both calculated from corpora. We then apply
this information to distinguish different clinical groups
using classifiers in a fully automated way. This paper is
structured as follows: in §2, we review the detection of
neuropsychiatric diseases with SVF tests. In §3 we dis-
cuss the data and the switch detection strategies. In §4
reports results. We finish with conclusions and future
work.

2 Related Works
The cluster and switch dynamic is a classic source of
information for separating clinical groups in SVF tests,
due to their deep connections to executive functions
and semantic memory (Troyer et al., 1998). Clinical
detection approaches are widely based on SVF tests
and analyze word productivity (Murphy et al., 2006),
word repetitions (Raoux et al., 2008; Pekkala et al.,
2008; Henry and Phillips, 2006), and number of clus-
ters and switches (Gocer March and Pattison, 2006;
Price et al., 2012).

Computational approaches for prediction of switches
in SVFs have used information about semantic related-
ness from distributional semantic models (Linz et al.,
2017). Prediction of semantic clusters has been done
with clustering algorithms using LSA similarity be-
tween pairs of words. These clusters were then used to
detect bipolarity and schizophrenia (Rosenstein et al.,
2015).

SVF tests have also been computationally modeled
in terms of graphs with nodes corresponding to words
and edges to the temporal connections between them.
Topological measures, such as, the number of nodes
and edges, shortest path, diameter, and density were

231



used to distinguish the control from clinical groups di-
agnosed with schizophrenia and manic depression dis-
order (Mota et al., 2012), AD and MCD (Bertola et al.,
2014b).

In this work we use similarity measures based on
the association strength between two words, their se-
mantic similarity and their semantic relatedness for
detecting switches in SVFs involving AD and MCD
groups.1

3 Methods
3.1 SVF Dataset
The SVF dataset (Bertola et al., 2014a) contains the re-
sponses of 100 participants (mean age of 75.78, sd =
7.13) of both genders and of similar levels of education.
The participants are classified into four groups of 25 in-
dividuals. One is a control group with normal cognitive
performance, and three are groups with clinical con-
ditions according to assessment guidelines (de Paula
et al., 2013; McKhann et al., 1984; Winblad et al.,
2004): Amnestic Mild Cognitive Deficit (aMCD),
Multi-domain Mild Cognitive Deficit (mMCD) and
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Since the groups are ho-
mogeneous, there is no significant differences between
members of the same group. Additionally, we also
considered a fifth group, the Cognitively Impaired
(CI) group, that includes randomly selected partici-
pants from the three clinical groups. The responses of
each participant are annotated following the guidelines
adopted by Troyer et al. (1998); Bertola et al. (2014b).

3.2 Switch identification
In this paper we explore different types of similarity
for detecting switches in SVF. An SVF can be divided
in semantic chains, which we define as sequences of
consecutive words whose similarity falls above a cer-
tain threshold (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Pakhomov and
Hemmy, 2014). Different semantic chains are sepa-
rated by switches2. Switches form the basis for train-
ing classifiers to distinguish control from clinical cases
in the SVF dataset (Bertola et al., 2014a). We use
Random Forest classifiers (Breiman, 2001) trained with
the following features: the number of switches, n; the
largest chain size, cmax = max(ca); the average chain

length, c̄ = 1n+1
n+1∑
a=1

ca; the fraction of occurrence of

the smallest chain, fmin = #(cmin)/(n + 1), where
#(c) indicates the number of chains of size c in the
SVF test of a participant.

Results are reported in terms of average area under
the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) from

1Although lexical and distributional characteristics of
SVFs, like the total number of words and their frequencies,
may be effective indicators of clinical conditions, in this pa-
per we focus on switch information and how it can be approx-
imated.

2For simplicity sake we consider that a chain may have a
single word in which case it has length one.

10 times 10-fold-cross validation.3

To determine the effectiveness of different types of
similarity measures for switch identification we exam-
ine semantic similarity from a manually constructed
resource, as well as two measures derived from cor-
pora: word association strength, and semantic relat-
edness. Semantic similarity is determined from the
shortest path that connects two words according to the
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Perkins, 2010) hypernym
taxonomy. The association strength is calculated us-
ing the positive value of the Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), and the seman-
tic relatedness using the cosine similarity between two
GloVe word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).‘

WordNet provides a high quality manual resource
but is not available for all languages. In this work
we translated the SVF responses from Brazilian Por-
tuguese to English.4 Similarity using association
strength and semantic relatedness can be constructed
from raw corpora, which makes them an attractive al-
ternative for low-resourced languages like Portuguese.
In this work we used a corpus built from the Portuguese
Wikipedia5, which was lemmatized and had high fre-
quency function words removed. After preprocessing,
the corpus contained more than 118 million tokens, and
44,000 types. PMI for word pairs was calculated using
a sliding window of size 7 over the corpus. GloVe6

word embeddings were constructed using default pa-
rameters, with the exception of the window size and
vector dimension which were set to 7 and 300, respec-
tively.

Formally the switch is a binary function
ψ(xi) that operates on the sequence of N words
(w1, w2, · · · , wN ) produced by a subject in the SVF
test. There is a switch between consecutive words wi
and wi+1 when their similarity xi = s(wi, wi+1) falls
below a threshold, in which case ψ(xi) = 1, otherwise
ψ(xi) = 0. In this paper we explore three heuristics
for the switch function:
Detection based on the global mean. The threshold is
given by the average similarity of the list.

ψglobal(xi) = H


 1
N − 1

N−1∑

j=1

xj − xi




where H(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0 and H(x) = 0 otherwise.
Detection based in the local mean. The threshold is
given by the average similarity of the last k pairs of
words.

ψk(xi) = H


1
k

k∑

j=1

xi−j − xi




3The models were trained with the Caret Package:
topepo.github.io/caret

4Given the limitations in WordNet coverage, animals that
were not found were replaced by similar animals found in
WordNet and with the same frequency profile.

Hibrid detection. We combine the local and global ap-
proach in a voting system where a switch is considered
if it receives at least v votes from previously switch cri-
teria. Here we consider a combination of global with
locals k = 2 and 3:

ψvotv (xi) = H(ψglobal(xi) + ψ2(xi) + ψ3(xi)− v)

where v can be 1, 2 (majority voting), and 3 (total
agreement).

4 Results
Evaluation is carried out at two levels of granularity: a
rough-grained classification for the detection of a clin-
ical condition in general (control vs. CI group), and
a fine-grained classification for one of the three con-
ditions (aMCD, mMCD and AD groups). Table 3.2
displays the average AUC per heuristic for the dif-
ferent sources, with the highest scores shown in bold
along with other scores that are not statistically differ-
ent, considering p-values adjusted with the Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
The last line of each subtable shows the scores obtained
by training the classifiers with the gold standard man-
ual annotation with the taxonomy used by Troyer et al.
(1998) (GS in the tables).

Overall, in terms of the type of similarity both
the semantic similarity (WordNet) and word associa-
tion strength (PMI) were significantly better than the
gold standard manual annotation for the rough-grained
classification and for two of the three clinical cases
(mMCD was the exception). This indicates the comple-
mentary nature of these additional types of similarity
beyond what the smaller and possibly stricter GS tax-
onomy can offer. Examining the specific groups, the
lower scores for aMCD and mMCD also seem to re-
flect the potential progression of these condition from
the control to the more severe impairments of the AD
group (aMCD < mMCD < AD).

Among the different measures, the strict total agree-
ment voting (ψvot3 ) provides the best results with as-
sociation strength for the rough-grained classification
(Table3.2(a)), and for the fine-grained classifications of
the mMCD (Table3.2(c)) and AD groups (Table3.2(d)).
These results suggest that a more conservative identifi-
cation of switches leading to larger chains provides a
better approximation for these three groups.

For the two intermediate clinical groups, aMCD and
mMCD, the use of local average information from a
small window including only the previous word (ψ1)
also produces good results. However, there is no con-
sensus regarding the source of switch identification,
as for aMCD both semantic similarity and association
strength were effective, and for mMCD it was seman-
tic relatedness that provided a better characterization of
the groups.

Finally, for the AD group various combinations of
measures and sources of semantic information lead
to effective distinction from the control group, with

the best results using the strict total agreement voting.
These results are indicative of AD as the clinical group
with strongest cognitive impairment in relation to the
control.

For a qualitative assessment of the results, we also
examine the vocabulary overlap among the groups,
using the Jaccard index as shown in Table 4, which
presents the average Jaccard index between subjects
across all groups. It shows a higher agreement among
the control than among the other groups. This is com-
patible with the discussion by Brandt and Manning
(2009) who identified a more systematic strategy for
vocabulary exploration in the control than in ‘the clini-
cal groups.

Given that the switches derived by our best mod-
els were more effective for the detection of the clini-
cal conditions than the gold standard, we explored the
idea that maybe the human annotation could be fur-
ther improved. To test that, we asked subjects to re-
annotate 594 pairs of words for which there was dis-
agreement between the gold standard and the predicted
switches. Each pair was annotated by an average of
8.1 annotators (sd = 2.28) using four context words.
When compared with the gold standard, the new anno-
tation resulted in a change of judgment for 12.7% of the
word pairs, with higher agreement with the switches
predicted by our heuristics. For instance, for ψvot3(xi)
it increased agreement in 11% for WordNet similarity,
15% for GloVe relatedness, and 16% for PMI word as-
sociation strength.

These results confirm the effectiveness of semantic
similarity and association strength as indicators of clin-
ical conditions. Moreover, the results suggest that these
measures also capture the progression of these condi-
tions and changes in strategies adopted for vocabulary
production (Brandt and Manning, 2009), since aMCD
can progress to mMCD, which may evolves to others,
such as AD and Parkinson disease.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we examined the use of three similar-
ity measures (association strength, semantic similarity,
and semantic relatedness) for detection of switches in
SVF tests, and their effectiveness in detecting clini-
cal conditions. Random forest classifiers trained using
the predicted switches were able to successfully iden-
tify clinical conditions, and in a fine-grained evalua-
tion were particularly effective for distinguishing the
control from clinical group. Our results also outper-
formed the graph-based approach used by Bertola et al.
(2014b) over the same dataset.

Future work includes investigation of the accuracy
of these methods for different clinical conditions, and
languages. However, the results obtained here show the
potential of the method as a tool to help health profes-
sionals in diagnosing clinical groups.
