Abstract

In this paper, we present the task of gen-
erating image descriptions with gold stan-
dard visual detections as input, rather than
directly from an image. This allows the
Natural Language Generation community
to focus on the text generation process,
rather than dealing with the noise and
complications arising from the visual de-
tection process. We propose a fine-grained
evaluation metric specifically for evaluat-
ing the content selection capabilities of
image description generation systems. To
demonstrate the evaluation metric on the
task, several baselines are presented us-
ing bounding box information and textual
information as priors for content selec-
tion. The baselines are evaluated using
the proposed metric, showing that the fine-
grained metric is useful for evaluating the
content selection phase of an image de-
scription generation system.

1 Introduction

There has been increased interest in the task of
automatically generating full-sentence natural lan-
guage image descriptions in recent years. Com-
pared to earlier work that annotates images with
isolated concept labels (Duygulu et al., 2002),
such detailed annotations are much more informa-
tive and discriminating, and are important for im-
proved text and image retrieval. They also pose an
interesting and difficult challenge for natural lan-
guage generation.

Previous work on generating image descriptions
concentrates on solving the problem ‘end-to-end’,
that is to generate a description given an image as
input (Yao et al., 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang
et al., 2011). Recent advances in large scale vi-
sual object recognition, especially in deep learning

techniques, have reached a reasonably high level
of accuracy in the last few years. For the task of
classifying an image into one of 1,000 object cat-
egories (i.e. does the image contain an object of
category X, yes or no?) on the ImageNet Large
Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC’14)
dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2014), the state-of-
the-art currently performs at a 4.82% top-5 error
rate (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) comparable to the
5.1% error rate of a human annotator who trained
himself to recognise the object categories (Rus-
sakovsky et al., 2014). For the more challenging
object category detection task (i.e. draw a bound-
ing box around each instance of objects of the
given categories), the state-of-the-art achieved a
mean average precision of 43.9%. However, even
at this level of performance, the errors from the
visual output are still problematic when used as
input to an image description generation system,
especially when considering a large pool of candi-
date object categories to be mentioned in the de-
scription.

What if we were to assume that visual object
recognisers have already achieved close to perfect
detection rates, and that the object instances have
already been identified and localised in an image?
This then raises many interesting questions with
regards to generating a description for an image,
including: (i) how do we decide which objects are
to be mentioned? (ii) how should these objects
be ordered in the description? (iii) how do we
infer and describe activities or actions? (iv) how
to we describe spatial relations between objects?
(v) how and when do we describe the object at-
tributes? Many of these questions could be ex-
plored if we had a ‘perfect’ visual input to our im-
age description generator.

To be able to begin to answer these questions,
we proposed a pilot task, which has formed part of
the ImageCLEF 2015 Scalable Image Annotation,
Localization and Sentence Generation task bench-

Figure 1: We present the task of generating textual
descriptions given gold standard labelled bound-
ing boxes as input. This allows researchers to
focus on the text generation aspects of the im-
age description generation task, rather than deal-
ing with the noise arising from visual detection.
This task also allows us to evaluate specific phases
of the conventional generation pipeline, providing
insights into which specific phases of the genera-
tion pipeline contribute to the performance of an
image description generation system.

marking challenge (Villegas et al., 2015; Gilbert
et al., 2015). More specifically, we assume that
perfectly labelled object instances and their local-
isations are available to image description genera-
tion systems, as done in Elliott and Keller (2013)
and Yatskar et al. (2014). Given this knowledge,
we would like to evaluate how well image descrip-
tion generation systems perform through the vari-
ous stages of Natural Language Generation (Reiter
and Dale, 2000): content determination (what ob-
jects to describe), microplanning (how to describe
objects) and realisation (generating the complete
sentence). This pilot task is an attempt at en-
couraging fine-grained evaluation specifically for
image descriptions, compared to general-purpose
metrics like METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie,
2014) that evaluates text at a global, coarse-
grained level. For our pilot, we concentrated on
just one fine-grained metric: a content selection
measure to evaluate how well a text generation
system selects the correct object instances to be
mentioned in the resulting image description.

A dataset has been introduced for this partic-
ular challenge. This paper will not discuss in
great detail how the dataset has been collected and
annotated; we instead refer readers to Gilbert et
al. (2015) for more details about the challenge.

The main purpose of this paper, instead, is to: (i)
present and discuss the task of generating image
descriptions with a gold standard visual input; (ii)
propose a fine-grained metric specifically for eval-
uating the content selection capabilities of image
description generation systems; (iii) introduce sev-
eral baselines for this task and evaluate the base-
lines using the proposed fine-grained metric.

Overview. In section 2, we discuss the motiva-
tions for introducing the pilot task and the fine-
grained metric in the ImageCLEF 2015 challenge,
positioning them in relation to existing work. In
section 3, we describe the task of generating im-
age descriptions given gold standard visual inputs,
along with a discussion on evaluating image de-
scription generation systems with regards to their
content selection abilities. Section 4 presents sev-
eral baselines for this task, while section 5 eval-
uates these baselines using the proposed content
selection metric. Finally, we discuss further chal-
lenges with the proposed task, and introduce pos-
sible fine-grained metrics to be considered in the
future.

2 Motivation and Related Work

There are currently three main groups of ap-
proaches to generating image descriptions. The
most common and intuitive paradigm is the
knowledge-based, generative approach that takes
an image as input, detects instances of pre-defined
object categories in the image using a visual recog-
niser, and then reasons about the detected objects
to generate a novel textual description (Yao et al.,
2010; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011;
Li et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2012). However,
these approaches are constrained to a limited num-
ber of categories, for example 20 in Kulkarni et al.
(2011). We found that these approaches are gener-
ally sensitive to errors from visual input detection,
as such errors tend to propagate and accumulate
through the generation pipeline. The problem is
accentuated when scaling up to a larger number
of categories (e.g. 1000), where it becomes diffi-
cult to reason about what to describe amongst the
candidate instances produced by the noisy visual
detectors. Thus, generating image descriptions
with gold standard visual input allows researchers
to concentrate on the sentence generation aspects
without being bogged down by the complications
of the vision aspects of the task.

The second group of work revolves around de-

Figure 2: An example image and its seven corresponding textual descriptions from the development
dataset, with bounding box annotations labelled with WordNet concepts, and the correspondence of
bounding boxes to entity mentions in the descriptions. For example, [woman]2 in the first sentence
refers to bounding box ID [2] in the image, and [dress]0 corresponds to bounding box ID [0]. Correspon-
dence is annotated at word level rather than at phrase level to avoid possible complications with multiple
correspondences within the same phrase (woman in a white dress).

scription generation by retrieving existing textual
descriptions from similar images. A common ap-
proach would be to map text and images to a com-
mon meaning space (Farhadi et al., 2010; Ho-
dosh et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2014) or by using
some similarity measure (Ordonez et al., 2011).
Although such methods produce descriptions that
are more expressive, they rely on a large amount
of training data, and are unable to produce novel
sentences. There have been attempts at retrieving
only text fragments and combining them to gen-
erate novel descriptions (Kuznetsova et al., 2012;
Kuznetsova et al., 2014) or by pruning irrelevant
fragments for better generalisation (Kuznetsova et
al., 2013). However, the resulting descriptions
may still be pure ‘guesswork’ and may reference
text fragments that are irrelevant to image content.

Most recently, work using deep learning
approaches has produced state-of-the-art re-
sults (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015; Donahue et al.,
2015; Vinyals et al., 2015), by utilising Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (CNN) (Krizhevsky et
al., 2012; Razavian et al., 2014) as image features,
and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (Mikolov
et al., 2010) for language modelling, and learning
to generate descriptions jointly from images and
their descriptions. The advantages of such models
are that they cope better with noisy visual detec-
tions, and that the RNN language models are ca-

pable of modelling long range dependencies. The
main disadvantages are (i) it is difficult to inspect
what has been learnt by the model and hence to
gain insight into what is working or not working
in the system; (ii) these methods are dependent on
image datasets aligned with sentences as learning
is performed in a joint manner. The latter limita-
tion means new datasets need to be produced even
for small changes in the task, such as generating
descriptions that are more or less detailed, or in
more or less simplified language (e.g. for chil-
dren) or have a specific information focus (say, fo-
cussing on buildings versus people in an image for
a particular application). Thus, knowledge-based,
generative approaches may have an advantage in
this respect, as there is no need for aligned image-
text datasets, since visual detection and sentence
generation are independent, allowing the language
model to be tuned at surface realisation stages.

Image description generation with gold stan-
dard input. As discussed, knowledge-based,
generative approaches are sensitive to visual de-
tection input errors. Therefore, previous work has
proposed circumventing the problem by provid-
ing gold standard annotations as input to descrip-
tion generation systems. Elliott and Keller (2013)
provide region annotations along with spatial re-
lations between region instances. Yatskar et al.
(2014) also provide gold standard region anno-

119



tations, as well as fine-grained region properties
such as attributes, parts, and activities. Zitnick and
Parikh (2013) take a unique approach of generat-
ing scenes from clipart as an abstraction to real
world images to address the issue of noisy input.
Our work takes a similar direction as Elliott and
Keller (2013) and Yatskar et al. (2014), but with
bounding boxes as gold standard input, and with
an emphasis on fine-grained evaluation of image
description generation systems.

Evaluation of image description generation
systems. Existing image description generation
systems are most commonly evaluated using au-
tomatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) and most
recently CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015). How-
ever, such global measures only allow evalua-
tion of image description generation systems as
a whole, without being able to ascertain which
parts of the generation process, or components of
the generation system, are responsible for perfor-
mance gains or losses. Although evaluations based
on human judgments could provide a more fine-
grained metric (Yang et al., 2011; Mitchell et al.,
2012; Kuznetsova et al., 2012), they are expensive
and difficult to scale. We propose instead to ex-
ploit the pipeline of knowledge-based, generative
approaches to generation, allowing us to inspect
specific capabilities of image generation systems
by means of evaluation with fine-grained metrics.
Rather than just evaluating image description gen-
eration extrinsically with a global evaluation mea-
sure, we isolate evaluation of different phases of
description generation, and treat each phase as a
first-class citizen.

3 Task and Evaluation Measure

As mentioned above, we introduced as a bench-
marking challenge the task of generating image
descriptions for 450 test images given gold stan-
dard, labelled bounding box annotations as input
(Figure 1). The category labels were restricted to
251 WordNet synsets selected specifically for the
challenge. To enable evaluation with our proposed
fine-grained metric, participants were also asked
to annotate, within their generated descriptions,
the bounding box ID to which a term in the de-
scription corresponds. A development dataset of
500 images was provided with labelled bounding
box annotations and correspondence annotations

between textual terms and bounding boxes. Fig-
ure 2 shows an example annotation of bounding
boxes and the correspondences between bound-
ing box instances and terms in the image descrip-
tions. Note that correspondence was annotated at
word level (unigram) rather than at phrase level
(higher-order n-grams) to avoid possible compli-
cations with multiple correspondences within the
same phrase (woman in a white dress).

3.1 Fine-grained Evaluation Metric

As a pilot, we propose a fine-grained metric to
evaluate the content selection capabilities of an
image description system. This content selection
metric is the F1 score averaged across all 450 test
images, where each F1 score is computed from the
precision and recall averaged over all gold stan-
dard descriptions for the image.

Formally, let I = {I1, I2, ...IN} be the set of
test images. Let GIi = {GIi1 , GIi2 , ..., GIiM} be
the set of gold standard descriptions for image Ii,
where each GIim is the set of unique bounding box
instances referenced in gold standard description
m of image Ii. Let SIi be the set of unique bound-
ing box instances referenced by the participant’s
generated sentence for image Ii. The precision
P Ii for test image Ii is computed as:

P Ii =
1

M

M∑

m

|GIim ∩ SIi |
|SIi | (1)

where |GIim ∩ SIi | is the number of unique
bounding box instances referenced in both the
gold standard description and the generated sen-
tence, and M is the number of gold standard de-
scriptions for image Ii.

Similarly, the recall RIi for test image Ii is com-
puted as:

RIi =
1

M

M∑

m

|GIim ∩ SIi |
|GIim|

(2)

The content selection score for image Ii, F Ii , is
computed as the harmonic mean of P Ii and RIi :

F Ii = 2× P
Ii ×RIi

P Ii +RIi
(3)

The final P , R and F scores are computed as the
mean P , R and F scores across all test images.

The advantage of the macro-averaging process
in equations (1) and (2) is that it implicitly cap-
tures the relative importance of the bounding box

120



instances based on how frequently they occur
across the gold standard descriptions. For exam-
ple, in Figure 2, both woman and car are ref-
erenced in all seven gold standard descriptions,
while boot is mentioned four times and dress
twice. Thus, a generated description that refer-
ences woman and car will naturally result in a
higher score than one that references only woman
and dress.

Note that for this metric, we are only concerned
with evaluating the generation system’s content
selection capabilities, rather than its referring ex-
pression generation. As such, systems are free
to generate any referring expression for each se-
lected bounding box instance. We consider the
evaluation of referring expressions as a potentially
separate fine-grained evaluation task to be intro-
duced in the future. In addition, we do not evalu-
ate terms outside those that refer to bounding box
instances, and as for the pilot task of the challenge
use the global METEOR metric to cover evalua-
tion of other aspects of image description genera-
tion.

4 Generating Descriptions: Baselines

We propose a set of baselines for the image de-
scription generation task, or more specifically the
content selection task. These allow us to test
the proposed fine-grained content selection met-
ric (Section 3.1) and to gain some insights into
what features might inform content selection. The
baselines use visual and textual cues to select the
bounding box instances to be described in the text
to be generated.

4.1 Generation based on Visual Cues

Stratos et al. (2012) found that the size and posi-
tion of visual entities in an image, to a certain ex-
tent, plays a part in determining what is mentioned
in the corresponding description. As such, we con-
sider two baselines based on different visual cues:
(i) bounding box size (bigger objects have higher
likelihood of being mentioned); (ii) distance of the
centroid of the bounding box to the centre of the
image (central objects have higher likelihood of
being mentioned). For each test image, bounding
boxes instances are sorted based on these visual
cues, and a fixed threshold used to limit the num-
ber of instances to be selected for sentence gener-
ation. We will explore different thresholds in our
experiments in Section 5.

included in Table 1.

4.2 Generation based on Textual Priors

We also consider baselines based on textual pri-
ors, as Stratos et al. (2012) also showed that the
category of the object play a role in determining
whether it will be mentioned in the corresponding
textual description.

For the first baseline, we consider as a prior uni-
gram counts of concepts that have been referenced
to a bounding box in the gold standard descrip-
tions from the development set. For each test im-
age, bounding boxes are sorted by the frequency
of their concept labels in the development set, i.e.
frequently mentioned concepts have higher prece-
dence.

We also consider a more sophisticated baseline
based on bigram sequences, where a concept is se-
lected based on how likely it is to be referenced
immediately after another concept, i.e. there are
no other terms referencing a bounding box in be-
tween. For instance, for the first sentence in Fig-
ure 2, we consider woman to be followed by dress,
dress followed by boot, and boot followed by car,
but not woman followed by car or boot. Con-
cept selection is performed in a greedy fashion,
by choosing from the pool of bounding boxes for
each image, the concept that is most likely to occur
first in a sentence, followed by the concept that is
most likely to occur given the previously selected
concept. The selection process terminates when
no remaining concept from the candidate pool is
likely to follow the previously selected concept.

at varying levels of k. Again, error bars are omitted for clarity, but are included in Table 1.

For all baselines, we select the first term among
the synonyms of the WordNet synset to generate
the referring expression for each concept.

4.3 Function Words

Our metric only evaluates the content selection
process and ignores everything else. However,
for completeness and in the spirit of generating
complete descriptions, we attempt to connect se-
lected concept terms with randomly selected func-
tion words or phrases. The phrases are selected to
be a random word from a predefined list of prepo-
sitions and conjunctions, followed by an optional
article the.

5 Experimental Results

The generation systems described in Section 4
were evaluated using the proposed content selec-
tion metric (Section 3.1). We also compared the
proposed systems to a baseline that selects bound-
ing boxes at random, up to a pre-defined thresh-
old k of the maximum allowed number of bound-
ing boxes per image. We explore different values
of this threshold by varying k from 1 to 15. We
take min(k,Nbox) for images with fewer than k
bounding boxes, where Nbox is the total number
of bounding boxes for the image.

As an upper bound to how well humans perform
content selection, we evaluated the gold standard
descriptions by evaluating one description against
the other descriptions of the image and repeating
the process for all descriptions. The upper bound
is computed to be F = 0.74 ± 0.12, with P =
0.77± 0.11 and R = 0.77± 0.11.

Figure 3 shows the F -scores of our proposed
generation systems. Firstly, we examine the ef-
fects of varying the threshold k on the number of
instances to be selected. The F -score peaks at k
between 3 and 4 across all systems except the ran-
dom baseline, and then drops or remains stagnant
beyond that. Figure 4 gives an insight about this
observation when the precision P and recall R are
examined separately. As expected, P decreases
while R increases when k is increased. The two
graphs intersect at about k between 3 to 4, sug-
gesting that these values are an optimal tradeoff
between precision and recall (the mean number of
unique instances per description is 2.89 in the de-
velopment dataset).

Comparing the baselines based on visual and
textual cues, the F -score in Figure 3 suggests that
baselines using textual cues perform better when
k is small, and visual cues perform better with
larger k’s. However, Figure 4 gives a clearer pic-
ture, where the bigram-based system obtained the
best precision regardless of k (Figure 4a), while
the systems based on bounding box cues relied on
the increased recall when increasing k to obtain a
high F -score (Figure 4b). Note that the bigram-
based generation system is less sensitive to larger
k’s as the model itself contains an internal stop-
ping criterion when no suitable concept is likely
to follow a selected concept, resulting in a lower
but stable recall rate compared to other systems,
when k is increased. Figure 5 shows some exam-
ple sentences generated by our baseline systems,
for k=3.

We can infer from the results that (i) using prior

122



knowledge on the ordering of concepts (i.e. bi-
grams) is helpful for concept selection; (ii) fre-
quency of concepts (i.e. unigrams) are helpful
when there are only one or two instances to be
described, possibly because the remaining objects
are not mentioned as frequently as the main actors;
(iii) visual cues are helpful for concept selection,
although the precision is reduced as k increases.

5.1 Combining Textual and Visual Priors

We also explored combining textual priors and
visual cues, which could potentially produce a
stronger baseline. This is done by re-ranking the
bounding boxes, for each image, by the average
rank from both systems. In the case of the bigram-
based system, bounding boxes that are not selected
are all assigned an equal rank: 0.5 × ((Nbox +
1) − Ns) + Ns, where Nbox is the number of all
bounding boxes for the image and Ns the number
of bounding boxes selected by the bigram-based
system. For example, if only 3 out of 9 bound-
ing boxes are selected (and assigned ranks 1, 2
and 3 respectively), then the remaining 6 bound-
ing boxes are all assigned equal rank 6.5. Fig-
ure 6 compares the F -scores of systems combin-
ing textual priors (unigram or bigram) and visual
cues (bounding box position) at k=3 and k=4; we
omitted bounding box size as the results are simi-
lar to bounding box position. Combining unigram
and bounding box position did not significantly
improve the F -score compared to using bound-
ing box position alone, at k=3 and k=4. As seen
earlier, the performance of the unigram-based sys-
tem at these k’s is much lower than systems based
on visual cues. The combination of bigram and
bounding box position, however, seems to yield
slightly improved performance at these k’s. This
is likely due to the bigram-based system providing
higher precision and the system based on visual
cues providing better recall. This shows that com-
bining textual and visual priors may be beneficial
when they complement each other.

6 Discussion and Future Work

We presented the task of generating image de-
scriptions from gold standard labelled bounding
boxes as input to a text generation system. We also
proposed a fine-grained evaluation metric specifi-
cally to evaluate the content selection capabilities
of the image description generation system, which
measures how well the system selects the concepts

on the task. We found that selecting a maximum of
3 to 4 instances is optimal for this dataset, and that
both text and visual cues play a part in the content
selection process.

Further challenges can be observed for the pro-
posed generation task based solely on gold stan-
dard visual inputs:

Bounding boxes. Bounding boxes labelled with
concepts may be a good starting point for a ‘clean’
input task, but may be somewhat uninformative as
important visual information is discarded in the
process that might prove useful for the genera-
tion process. A possible solution would be to en-
rich the bounding box inputs with more informa-
tion, either as attributes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or
directly using visual features. However, manu-
ally annotating such fine-grained information is an
onerous task.

Suitability of metrics. Another possible issue
with the proposed task is that it might be prob-
lematic to assume that all image description gen-
eration systems will be using a common pipeline.
With the large variation in how image description
generation systems are constructed, it may be dif-
ficult to constrain and expect systems to be using
the same architecture that will enable us to evalu-

ate them with such fine-grained metrics.

Future work with fine-grained metrics. Al-
though we only consider one metric to evalua-
tion the content selection capabilities of genera-
tion systems, further fine-grained metrics can be
introduced to evaluate different components of
the generation pipeline. Some examples include
content ordering, lexicalisation or referring ex-
pression generation of concepts (and/or their at-
tributes), evaluating the appropriateness of verbs,
predicates and prepositions, and surface realisa-
tion.

Future work on image description generation.
In this paper, we presented several baselines based
on different textual and visual priors, and also ex-
plored combining cues from both text and vision.
Future work on image description generation
could involve stronger cues, for example from
co-occurrences and spatial relationships between
multiple objects.

We believe that the introduction of a fine-
grained approach to evaluating image description

generation tasks can encourage further growth in
this area, linking further research between com-
puter vision and natural language generation.
