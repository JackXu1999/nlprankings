Abstract

A large percentage of medical information is
in unstructured text format in electronic med-
ical record systems. Manual extraction of
information from clinical notes is extremely
time consuming. Natural language process-
ing has been widely used in recent years for
automatic information extraction from med-
ical texts. However, algorithms trained on
data from a single healthcare provider are not
generalizable and error-prone due to the het-
erogeneity and uniqueness of medical docu-
ments. We develop a two-stage federated nat-
ural language processing method that enables
utilization of clinical notes from different hos-
pitals or clinics without moving the data, and
demonstrate its performance using obesity and
comorbities phenotyping as medical task. This
approach not only improves the quality of a
specific clinical task but also facilitates knowl-
edge progression in the whole healthcare sys-
tem, which is an essential part of learning
health system. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first application of federated ma-
chine learning in clinical NLP.

1 Introduction

Clinical notes and other unstructured data in plain
text are valuable resources for medical informat-
ics studies and machine learning applications in
healthcare. In clinical settings, more than 70% of
information are stored as unstructured text. Con-
verting the unstructured data into useful structured
representations will not only help data analysis but
also improve efficiency in clinical practice (Jagan-
nathan et al., 2009; Kreimeyer et al., 2017; Ford
et al., 2016; Demner-Fushman et al., 2009; Murff
et al., 2011; Friedman et al., 2004). Manual ex-
traction of information from the vast volume of
notes from electronic health record (EHR) systems
is too time consuming.

To automatically retrieve information from
unstructured notes, natural language processing
(NLP) has been widely used. NLP is a subfield
of computer science, that has been developing
for more than 50 years, focusing on intelligent
processing of human languages (Manning et al.,
1999). A combination of hard-coded rules and
machine learning methods have been used in the
field, with machine learning currently being the
dominant paradigm.

Automatic phenotyping is a task in clinical NLP
that aims to identify cohorts of patients that match
a predefined set of criteria. Supervised machine
learning is curently the main approach to pheno-
typing, but availability of annotated data hinders
the progress for this task. In this work, we con-
sider a scenario where multiple instituitions have
access to relatively small amounts of annotated
data for a particular phenotype and this amount is
not sufficient for training an accurate classifier. On
the other hand, combining data from these institu-
tions can lead to a high accuracy classifier, but di-
rect data sharing is not possible due to operational
and privacy concerns.

Another problem we are considering is learn-
ing patient representations that can be used to train
accurate phenotyping classifiers. The goal of pa-
tient representation learning is mapping the text of
notes for a patient to a fixed-length dense vector
(embedding). Patient representation learning has
been done in a supervised (Dligach and Miller,
2018) and unsupervised (Miotto et al., 2016) set-
ting. In both cases, patient representation learn-
ing requires massive amounts of data. As in the
scenario we outlined in the previous paragraph,
combining data from several institutions can lead
to higher quality patient representations, which
in turn will improve the accuracy of phenotyping
classifiers. However, direct data sharing, again, is
difficult or impossible.



284

To tackle the challenges we mentioned above,
we developed a federated machine learning
method to utilize clinical notes from multiple
sources, both for learning patient representations
and phenotype classifiers.

Federated machine learning is a concept that
machine learning models are trained in a dis-
tributed and collaborative manner without cen-
tralised data (Liu et al., 2018a; McMahan et al.,
2016; Bonawitz et al., 2019; Konečnỳ et al., 2016;
Huang et al., 2018; Huang and Liu, 2019). The
strategy of federated learning has been recently
adopted in the medical field in structured data-
based machine learning tasks (Liu et al., 2018a;
Huang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b). However,
to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
time a federated learning strategy has been used in
medical NLP.

We developed our two-stage federated natu-
ral language processing method based on previ-
ous work on patient representation (Dligach and
Miller, 2018). The first stage of our proposed fed-
erated learning scheme is supervised patient rep-
resentation learning. Machine learning models are
trained using medical notes from a large number of
hospitals or clinics without moving or aggregating
the notes. The notes used in this stage need not be
directly relevant to a specific medical task of in-
terest. At the second stage, representations from
the clinical notes directly related to the phenotyp-
ing task are extracted using the algorithm obtained
from stage 1 and a machine learning model spe-
cific to the medical task is trained.

Clinicians spend a significant amount of time
reviewing clinical notes. This time can be saved
or reduced with reasonably designed NLP tech-
nologies. One such task is phenotying from med-
ical notes. In this study, we demonstrated, using
phenotyping from clinical note as a clinical task
(Conway et al., 2011; Dligach and Miller, 2018),
that the method we developed will make it possi-
ble to utilize notes from a wide range of hospitals
without moving the data.

The ability to utilize clinical notes distributed
at different healthcare providers not only benefits
a specific clinical practice task but also facilitates
building a learning healthcare system, in which
meaningful use of knowledge in distributed clin-
ical notes will speed up progression of medical
knowledge to translational research, tool develop-
ment, and healthcare quality assessment (Fried-

man et al., 2010; Blumenthal and Tavenner, 2010).
Without the needs of data movement, the speed of
information flow can approach real time and make
a rapid learning healthcare system possible (Slut-
sky, 2007; Friedman et al., 2014; Abernethy et al.,
2010).

2 Methods

2.1 Study Cohorts

Two datasets were used in this study. The MIMIC-
III corpus (Johnson et al., 2016) was used for
representation learning. This corpus contains in-
formation for more than 58,000 admissions for
more than 45,000 patients admitted to Beth Is-
rael Deaconess Medical Center in Boston between
2001 and 2012. Relevant to this study, MIMIC-
III includes clinical notes, ICD9 diagnostic codes,
ICD9 procedure codes, and CPT codes. The
notes were processed with cTAKES1 to extract
UMLS2 unique concept identifiers (CUIs). Fol-
lowing the cohort selection protocol from (Dligach
and Miller, 2018), patients with over 10,000 CUIs
were excluded from this study. We obtained a co-
hort of 44,211 patients in total.

The Informatics for Integrating Biology to the
Bedside (i2b2) Obesity challenge dataset was used
to train phenotyping models (Uzuner, 2009). The
dataset consists of 1237 discharge summaries from
Partners HealthCare in Boston. Patients in this co-
hort were annotated with respect to obesity and
its comorbidities. In this study we consider the
more challenging intuitive version of the task. The
discharge summaries were annotated with obe-
sity and its 15 most common comorbidities, the
presence, absence or uncertainty (questionable) of
which were used as ground truth label in the phe-
notyping task in this study. Table 1 shows the
number of examples of each class for each phe-
notype. Thus, we build phenotyping models for
16 different diseases.

2.2 Data Extraction and feature choice

At the representation learning stage (stage 1), all
notes for a patient were aggregated into a single
document. CUIs extracted from the text were used
as input features. ICD-9 and CPT codes for the
patient were used as labels for supervised repre-
sentation learning.

At the phenotyping stage (stage 2), CUIs ex-
tracted from the discharge summaries were used as
input features. Annotations of being present, ab-
sent, or questionable for each of the 16 diagnoses
for each patient were used as multi-class classifi-
cation labels.

2.3 Two-stage federated natural language
processing of clinical notes

We envision that clinical textual data can be use-
ful in at least two ways: (1) for pre-training patient
representation models, and (2) for training pheno-
typing models.

In this study, a patient representation refers to a
fixed-length vector derived from clinical notes that
encodes all essential information about the patient.
A patient representation model trained on massive
amounts of text data can be useful for a wide range
of clinical applications. A phenotyping model, on
the other hand, captures the way a specific medical
condition works, by learning the function that can
predict a disease (e.g., asthma) from the text of the
notes.

Until recently, phenotyping models have been
trained from scratch, omitting stage (1), but recent
work (Dligach and Miller, 2018) included a pre-
training step, which derived dense patient repre-
sentations from data linking large amounts of pa-
tient notes to ICD codes. Their work showed that
including the pre-training step led to learning pa-
tient representations that were more accurate for a

number of phenotyping tasks.
Our goal here is to develop methods for feder-

ated learning for both (1) pre-training patient rep-
resentations, and (2) phenotyping tasks. These
methods will allow researchers and clinicans to
utilize data from multiple health care providers,
without the need to share the data directly, obvi-
ating issues related to data transfer and privacy.

To achieve this goal, we design a two-stage fed-
erated NLP approach (Figure 1). In the first stage,
following (Dligach and Miller, 2018), we pre-train
a patient representation model by training an arti-
ficial neural network (ANN) to predict ICD and
CPT codes from the text of the notes. We extend
the methods from (Dligach and Miller, 2018) to
facilitate federated training.

In the second stage, a phenotyping machine
learning model is trained in a federated manner us-
ing clinical notes that are distributed across multi-
ple sites for the target phenotype. In this stage, the
notes mapped to fixed-length representations from
stage (1) are used as input features and whether
the patient has a certain disease is used as a label
with one of the three classes: presence, absence or
questionable.

In the following sections, we first describe a
simple notes pre-processing step. We then discuss
the method for pre-training patient representations
and the method for training phenotyping models.
Finally, we describe our framework for perform-
ing the latter two steps in a federated manner.



286

Figure 1: Two stage federated natural language processing for clinical notes phenotyping. In the first stage, a
patient representation model was trained using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict ICD and CPT codes
from the text of the notes from a wide range of healthcare providers. The model without output layer was then used
as ”representation extractor” in the next stage. In the second stage, a phenotyping support vector machine model
was trained in a federated manner using clinical notes for the target phenotype distributed across multiple silos.

2.4 Pre-processing

All of our models rely on standardized medical vo-
cabulary automatically extracted from the text of
the notes rather than on raw text.

To obtain medically relevant information from
clinical notes, Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS) concept unique identifiers (CUIs) were
extracted from each note using Apache cTAKES
(https://ctakes.apache.org). UMLS is a resource
that brings together many health and biomedical
vocabularies and standardizes them to enable in-
teroperability between computer systems.

The Metathesaurus is a large, multi-purpose,
and multi-lingual vocabulary that contains in-
formation about biomedical and health related
concepts, their various names, and the relation-
ships among them. The Metathesaurus structure
has four layers, Concept Unique Identifies(CUIs),
Lexical (term) Unique Identifiers (LUI), String
Unique Identifiers (SUI) and Atom Unique Iden-

tifiers (AUI). In this study, we focus on CUIs, in
which a concept is a medical meaning. Our mod-
els use UMLS CUIs as input.

2.5 Representation learning

We adapted the architecture from (Dligach and
Miller, 2018) for pre-training patient representa-
tions. A deep averaging network (DAN) that con-
sists of an embedding layer, an average pooling
layer, a dense layer, and multiple sigmoid outputs,
where each output corresponds to an ICD or CPT
code being predicted.

This architecture takes CUIs as input and is
trained using binary cross-entropy loss function to
predict ICD and CPT codes. After the model is
trained, the dense layer can be used to represent a
patient as follows: the model weights are frozen
and the notes of a new patient are fed into the net-
work; the patient representation is collected from
the values of the units of the dense layer. Thus, the

2.6 Phenotyping
A linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM)
taking input from representations generated using
the pre-trained model from stage 1 was used as
the classifer for each phenotype of interest. No
regularization was used for the SVM and stochas-
tic gradient descent was used as the optimization
algorithm.

2.7 Federated machine learning learning on
clinical notes

To train the ANN model in either stage 1 or stage
2, we simulated sending out models with identi-
cal initial parameters to all sites such as hospi-
tals or clinics. At each site, a model was trained
using only data form that site. Only model pa-

rameters of the models were then sent back to
the analyzer for aggregation but not the original
training data. An updated model is generated by
averaging the parameters of models distributively
trained, weighted by sample size (Konečnỳ et al.,
2016; McMahan et al., 2016). In this study, sam-
ple size is defined as the number of patients.

After model aggregation, the updated model
was sent out to all sites again to repeat the global
training cycle (Algorithm 1). Formally, the weight
update is specified by:

W tag =

where Wag is the parameter of aggregated

samples across all sites, and Wi is the parameters
learned from the ith data site alone. t is the global

learning model such as artificial neural network
or SVM.Codes that accompany this article can be

3 Experiments

To imitate real world medical setting where data
are distributed with different healthcare providers,
we randomly split patients in MIMIC-III data into
10 sites for stage 1 (federated representation learn-
ing). The training data of i2b2 was split into 3
sites for stage 2 (phenotype learning) to mimic
obesity related notes distributed with three differ-
ent healthcare providers. i2b2 notes were not in-
cluded in the representation learning as in clinic
settings information exchange routes for disease-
specific records are often not the same as general
medical information and ICD/CPT codes were not
available for i2b2 dataset.

Experiments were designed to answer three
questions:

1. Whether clinical notes distributed in different
silos can be utilized for patient representation
learning without data sharing

2. Whether utilizing data from a wide range
of sources will help improve performance of
phenotyping from clinical notes

3. Whether models trained in a two-stage fed-
erated manner will have inferior performance
to models trained with centralized data.

To answer these questions, two-stage NLP al-
gorithms were trained. Performance of models
trained using only i2b2 notes from one of the

3https://github.com/kaiyuanmifen/
FederatedNLP

three sites were compared with two-stage fed-
erated NLP results. Furthermore, performance
of machine learning models using distributed or
centralized data at patient representation learning
stage or phenotyping stage were compared.

4 Results

4.1 Two-stage federated natural language
processing improves performance of
automatic phenotyping

We looked at the scenarios where no represen-
tation learning was performed. In those cases,
the standard TF-IDF weighted sparse bag-of-CUIs
vectors were used to represent i2b2 notes. The
sparse vectors were used as input into the pheno-
typing SVM model. We also looked at the scenar-
ios where representation learning was performed
by predicting ICD codes. For each of these con-
ditions, we trained our phenotyping models us-
ing centralized vs. federated learning. Finally,
we considered a scenario where the phenotyping
model was trained using the notes from a single
site (the metrics we report were averaged across
three sites).

To summarize, seven experiments were con-
ducted:

1. No representation learning + centralized phe-
notyping learning

2. No representation learning + federated phe-
notyping learning where i2b2 training data
were randomly split into 3 silos

3. No representation learning + single source
phenotyping learning, where i2b2 data were
randomly split into 3 silos, but phenotyping
algorithm was only trained using data from
one of the silos

4. Centralized representation learning + central-
ized phenotyping learning

5. Centralized representation learning + feder-
ated phenotyping learning

6. Federated representation learning + central-
ized phenotyping learning,where MIMIC-III
data were randomly split into 10 silos

7. Federated representation learning + federated
phenotyping learning, where MIMIC-III data
were randomly split into 10 silos and i2b2
data into 3 silos (Table 2).

The results of our experiments are shown in Ta-
ble 3. First of all, we looked at whether phe-
notyping model training can be conducted in a
federated manner without compromising perfor-
mance. When only i2b2 data from one of three si-
los was used for phenotyping training (experiment
3), the F1 score of 0.542 was achieved. When data
from all three i2b2 sites were used for phenotyp-
ing model training (experiment 1) the F1 score im-
proved to 0.634, which suggests that more data did
improve the model. If we assume data from the
three i2b2 silos can not be moved and aggregated
together, the model trained in a federated manner
(experiment 2) achieved a comparable F1 score of
0.632. This suggested federated learning worked
for phenotyping model training.

Previous work showed that using learned rep-

resentations from clinical notes from a different
source using a transfer learning strategy helps
to improve the performance of phenotyping NLP
models (Dligach and Miller, 2018). When patient
representations learned from centralized MIMIC-
III notes were used as features and centralized
phenotyping training was conducted (experiment
4), the phenotyping performance increased signif-
icantly with F1 score of 0.714, which was consis-
tent with previous findings (Dligach and Miller,
2018).

When a federated approach was applied in both
representation learning and phenotyping stages,
the algorithm achieved F1 score of 0.724. It is
worth pointing out that F1 scores from experi-
ment 7 , where both representation and phenotyp-
ing training were conducted in a federated man-
ner, were not statistically different from F1 scores
of experiment 4 over multiple rounds of experi-
ment using different data shuffling and initializa-
tion. In comparison, when only data from a sin-
gle simulated silo was used, the average F1 score
0.634. When the centralized approach was taken
at both stages, the precision, recall and F1 score
were 0.718, 0.711 and 0.714 respectively. These
results suggested utilizing clinical notes from dif-
ferent silos in a federated manner did improve ac-
curacy of the phenotyping NLP algorithm, and the
performance is comparable to NLP trained on cen-
tralized data. The performance of federated NLP
on each single obesity commodity were shown in
Table 3. It is necessary to point out that it was im-
practical to conduct federated phenotyping train-
ing when the number of “questionable” cases for
many diseases are small (Table 1). This is true
for many diseases in the i2b2 dataset. In such sit-
uation, “questionable” cases were excluded from
the training and testing process. Instead of 3-class
classification, a 2-class binary classification of
“presence” or “absence” were conducted. There-



290

fore, the performance metrics can not be directly
compared with results in the original i2b2 chal-
lenge, though the scores were similar.

5 Conclusion

In this article, we presented a two-stage method
that conducts patient representation learning and
obesity comorbidity phenotyping, both in a feder-
ated manner. The experimental results suggest that
federated training of machine learning models on
distributed datasets does improve performance of
NLP on clinical notes compared with algorithms
trained on data from a single site. In this study, we
used CUIs as input features into machine learning
models, but the same federated learning strategies
can also be applied to raw text.
