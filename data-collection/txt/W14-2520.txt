“I Want to Talk About, Again, My Record On Energy ...”: Modeling
Agendas and Framing in Political Debates and Other Conversations

Abstract

Computational social science has been emerging over the last several years as a hotbed of in-
teresting work, taking advantage of, to quote Lazer et al. (Science, v.323), ”digital traces that
can be compiled into comprehensive pictures of both individual and group behavior, with the
potential to transform our understanding of our lives, organizations, and societies.” Within that
larger setting, I’m interested in how language is used to influence people, with an emphasis on
computational modeling of agendas (who is most effectively directing attention, and toward what
topics?), framing or ”spin” (what underlying perspective does this language seek to encourage?),
and sentiment (how does someone feel, as evidenced in the language they use)? These questions
are particularly salient in political discourse. In this talk, I’ll present recent work looking at po-
litical debates and other conversations using Bayesian models to capture relevant aspects of the
conversational dynamics, as well as new methods for collecting people’s reactions to speeches,
debates, and other public conversations on a large scale.

This talk includes work done in collaboration with Jordan Boyd-Graber, Viet-An Nguyen, Deb-
orah Cai, Amber Boydstun, Rebecca Glazier, Matthew Pietryka, Tim Jurka, and Kris Miler.
