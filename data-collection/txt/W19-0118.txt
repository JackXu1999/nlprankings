Abstract

This paper proposes a methodology for com-
paring grammatical contrasts across categories
with the tools of distributional semantics. Af-
ter outlining why such a comparison is rele-
vant to current theoretical work on gender and
other morphosyntactic features, we present in-
trinsic and extrinsic predictability as instru-
ments for analyzing semantic contrasts be-
tween pairs of words. We then apply our
method to a dataset of gender pairs of French
nouns and adjectives. We find that, while the
distributional effect of gender is overall less
predictable for nouns than for adjectives, it is
heavily influenced by semantic properties of
the adjectives.

1 Introduction

Grammatical gender (henceforth g-gender) is the
phenomenon by which some languages group
nouns in classes that exhibit different behavior in
agreement, as in French uneF petiteF table ‘a small
table’ vs. unM petitM bureau ‘a small desk’ (Hock-
ett, 1958). In languages that have such a system, g-
gender entertains a complex relationship with the
social gender of referents (henceforth s-gender).
On the one hand, the assignment of g-gender to
nouns is often arbitrary. This is massively the case
in languages like French, which have only two
genders, and need to assign all inanimate nouns to
either masculine or feminine. On the other hand,
as Corbett (1991) highlights, all g-gender assign-
ment systems have a semantic core, which usually
entails lexicalizing different nouns for male and
female referents, and assigning them to a match-
ing g-gender (uneF petiteF fille ‘a small girl’ vs.
unM petitM garçon ‘a small boy’) to masculine g-
gender (Corbett, 2013). While this not a categori-
cal rule (some nouns refer to either men or women

while having a single gender, e.g. personne ‘per-
son’ is always feminine), it is a very strong ten-
dency.

In this paper we focus on pairs of
morphologically-related nouns such as candidat,
candidate where g-gender signals s-gender1;
Table 1 exhibits a few relevant examples. The
nature of the relationship between such nouns is
an understudied but pressing issue for morpho-
logical theory. One position holds that candidat
and candidate are two separate lexical items or
lexemes (Matthews, 1974), related by derivational
morphology (Zwanenburg, 1988). Under such
a view, the relationship between the two nouns
is similar to that between danser ‘to dance’ and
danseur ‘dancer’. The opposite view holds that
candidat and candidate are forms of the same lex-
eme, related by inflectional morphology (Bonami
and Boyé, in press). Under such a view, the
relation between the a masculine and a feminine

1More precisely, Burnett and Bonami (in press(a);
in press(b)) argue that g-gender carries social meaning rather
than denotational meaning: using a feminine signals the
speaker’s perception of gender-stereotypical properties of the
referent, leading to a situation where g-gender and s-gender
will mostly match but differ in principled ways in some situ-
ations.

noun (candidat vs. candidate) is similar to that
between a singular and a plural noun (candidat
vs. candidats) or a masculine and feminine forms
of an adjective (petit and petite).

While these two views make different theoreti-
cal predictions on the nature of g-gender systems,
they are remarkably difficult to tease apart empir-
ically, given the elusiveness of the empirical di-
vide between inflection and derivation (see e.g.
Dressler 1989; Corbett 2010; Spencer 2013). In
this paper we build on the well-known observa-
tion that inflection is semantically more regular
than derivation (Robins, 1959; Matthews, 1974;
Wurzel, 1989; Stump, 1998). While the meaning
of the English 3SG verb form dines can readily
be predicted from the meaning of its base form
dine, the range of meanings of diner (including
a particular kind of restaurant) is unpredictable.
Bonami and Paperno (forthcoming) operationalize
this idea by quantifying the diversity of seman-
tic contrasts between pairs of morphologically-
related words, and found, consistently with the
theoretical literature, that pairs of words in deriva-
tional relations contrast in more diverse ways than
pairs of word forms related by inflection.

It is not immediately obvious how diverse
the semantic contrasts between pairs of gender-
contrasting human nouns are. On the one hand,
these are systematic enough that dictionaries do
not list separate entries for masculine and femi-
nine nouns. On the other hand, the existence of
gender biases does lead to some interesting unpre-
dictable differences. For instance, until very re-
cently, masculine nouns referring to a stereotyp-
ically male occupation (e.g. ambassadeur ‘am-
bassador’) were often paired with a feminine noun
(e.g. ambassadrice) referring to the wife of a man
with that occupation, rather than to a woman with
that occupation. While social change towards gen-
der equality led to a change in usage in this partic-
ular case, the pervasiveness of gender biases leads
one to expect differences in meaning or in us-
age between masculine vs. feminine nouns which
have comparable meanings otherwise; cf. Boluk-
basi et al. (2016), who highlighted the omnipres-
ence of gender stereotypes in the distribution of
English nouns.

This paper compares of the semantic import of
g-gender contrasts in human nouns, as illustrated
in Table 1, as opposed to g-gender contrasts in ad-
jectives (Table 2). We ask two kinds of questions:

1. Are the semantic contrasts between human
nouns more diverse than the contrasts be-
tween adjectives?

2. Are the semantic contrasts between human
nouns similar to the semantic contrasts be-
tween adjectives?

Different views on the nature of g-gender lead
to contradictory predictions as to the answers to
questions 1 and 2. Under a naive view of g-
gender assignment as completely arbitrary, we
would expect to find semantic contrasts among
neither nouns nor adjectives, leading to a nega-
tive answer to the first question and a positive an-
swer to the second.2 On the other hand, if g-
gender on human nouns does signal s-gender of
the referent, then the different takes on the rela-
tionship between paired nouns will lead to dis-
tinct expectation. If the relation is inflectional, we
expect little or no difference between nouns and
adjectives, and hence a negative answer to ques-
tion 1. If it is derivational, following Bonami and
Paperno (forthcoming), we expect more irregular-
ity among nouns, and hence a positive answer to
question 1. As to question 2, if g-gender signals
s-gender, we expect similar contrasts for human
nouns and adjectives that modify a nominal ex-
pression with human reference. However, we have
no such expectation of similarity for those adjec-
tive instances that modify an inanimate nominal
expression; hence the answer to question 2 should
be different for different subsets of adjective us-
ages.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents our new methodology to study mor-
phological contrasts. In Section 3, we test the va-
lidity of our methodology by applying it to the
study of grammatical gender contrasts in French
human nouns (HNs) and adjectives and report what
differences are observed between these categories.
In Section 4, we probe the variability of contrast
among adjectives, and in Section 5 we specifi-
cally investigate the differences between usages
of adjectives to qualify human nouns (HQAs) vs.
usages of adjectives to qualify non-human nouns
(NHQAs). Our findings are summarized in Sec-
tion 6.

2In a distributional operationalization, we expect small,
erratic differences that cancel each other on average.

2 Methodology

2.1 Framework

In distributional semantics (Lenci, 2018), the
meaning of a word is represented in the mathe-
matical form of a vector computed on the basis
of the word’s contexts of occurrence in a large
text corpus. Distributional vectors have a num-
ber of applications, ranging from predicting se-
mantic relatedness judgments (Agirre et al., 2009)
to initializing neural machine translation systems
(Artetxe et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2017). Among
the wide range of theoretical and practical applica-
tions, distributional semantic modeling has been
used in two domains of direct relevance to the
present study. First, on the basis of German data,
Dye et al. study the relation of distributional sim-
ilarity and g-gender assigment. Second, distribu-
tional methods have been used to characterize nat-
ural language morphology, including the issue of
semantic transparency in derivation (Marelli and
Baroni, 2015), analysis of morphological variation
(Varvara, 2017), as well as the nature of the in-
flectional and derivational relations (Bonami and
Paperno, forthcoming).

Our method is closely related to the latter work,
and is based on two assumptions. First, following
Mikolov et al.’s (2013b) model for solving propor-
tional semantic analogy, we assume that a seman-
tic contrast between two words is represented by
the shift between the corresponding word vectors,
so that words in identical relations are expected
to have similar shifts3. The second assumption is
that the semantics of a morphological relation can
be approached by averaging vector differences for
multiple word pairs in the relation. This has the
double benefit of cancelling out some of the noise
inherent in distributional vectors and evening out
variation in the contrast between pairs of words
entering the same relation.

Other authors have stressed that some rela-
tions were not accurately represented using vector
shifts. For instance, Gladkova et al. (2016) have
highlighted that “derivational and lexicographic
relations remain a major challenge”; Levy and
Goldberg (2014) and Linzen (2016) both stress
that simple additive models do not suffice to model

3The utility of vector shifts as inputs to word relation clas-
sification –Jameel et al. (2018) showed that difference vectors
achieve a performance just slightly lower than specialized
representations learned for this task– further confirms that, to
some extent, they can be used to represent lexical relations.

relations. However, we do expect that even if a lin-
ear shift is an imperfect approximation of the rela-
tion in a distributional vector space, the regularity
of such an approximation still corresponds to the
semantic regularity of a specific relation. There-
fore we do not make any strong claim regarding
the correct representation of a relation in a DSM,
but we do assume that the more regular a relation
is, the more akin to a linear function – ie. a vector
offset – its representation will be. More generally,
the aim of this work is not to discuss how to accu-
rately capture lexical relations between words, but
rather to assess the relative regularity of different
relations.

Therefore, although we use an evaluation setup
similar to Mikolov et al.’s, our goal here is not to
solve the propositional analogy task, but to ana-
lyze and assess the predictability of different rela-
tions. Hence, we emphasize that we mention in-
trinsic and extrinsic ‘predictions’ of word vector
values only for the sake of convenience, which is
also the reason why we do not employ various im-
provements on the vector shift method proposed in
the literature such as the multiplicative method of
Levy and Goldberg (2014), and stick to the sim-
plest, most transparent option suitable for our pur-
poses. Likewise, as we are not attempting to solve
the analogy task but merely measuring the relative
regularity of different relations, we do not report
predictive strength.

2.2 Experimental Procedure

The framework and assumptions we adopt natu-
rally dictate how one can predict the vector of a
word from information about a related word. The
prediction is based on the computation of the mean
shift vector for a morphological relation, as illus-
trated in Figures 1 and 2. First, we compute the
difference between the vectors representing each
pair of related words, e.g. ~candidate � ~candidat;
these shift vectors are shown in red for adjectives
and in blue for nouns in Figure 1. A shift vector
can be seen as a functional representation of the
semantic contrast that holds between two words.
Second, for each morphological relation, we com-
pute the average of all shift vectors. This gives rise
to the mean shift vectors ~mA for adjective pairs
and ~mN for noun pairs in Figure 2. The mean
shift vectors thus represent the average semantic
contrast between pairs of words in the relation.

The next step is to use these mean shift vectors

as prediction functions. The basic scenario, which
we label intrinsic prediction (illustrated in Fig-
ure 3), can be used to address question 1 above.
Given a word w1 (e.g. the masculine noun marc-
hand) participating in some morphological rela-
tion R, we add to the vector representation ~w1 of
w1 the mean shift vector for R (here ~mN ). This
gives us the predicted vector for the morpholog-
ical alternant w2 (in this example, the feminine
noun marchande). We may now assess how far
the predicted vector ~w1 + ~mN falls from the ac-
tual observed vector ~w2 of the morphological al-
ternant. Various measures can be used to quantify
predictability in this case. In this paper we use
two: the Euclidean distance between the predicted
and observed vectors for the alternant, and the log
rank of the actual vector in terms of distance from
the predicted vector within the vector space.

The more diverse the shifts within a relation,
the less accurate this intrinsic prediction will be
on average. To address question 1, we will there-
fore compare the quality of intrinsic prediction for
pairs of nouns and pairs of adjectives: the answer
to it will be positive if prediction is less accurate
for nouns than for adjectives.

A different procedure, which we call extrinsic

prediction, allows us to address question 2 above,
and is illustrated in Figure 4. Informally, we test
to what extent two relations have the same distri-
butional footprint. Given a word w1 (e.g. the mas-
culine noun marchand) participating in morpho-
logical relation R, we add to the vector represen-
tation of that word the mean shift vector for the
other relation R0 (here ~mA). If relations R and R0

are semantically equivalent (i.e., g-gender alterna-
tion has the same effects for nouns and adjectives),
then extrinsic prediction should be just as accurate
as intrinsic prediction. If, on the other hand, the
two relations are not equivalent, we expect extrin-
sic prediction to be less accurate.

3 Experiment 1: Overall comparison of
HNs and adjectives

We start by addressing questions 1 and 2 in broad
terms, and will proceed with a more fine-grained
analysis of adjectives in subsequent sections.

3.1 Stability of contrast

Research Question The first question addressed
in our paper concerns the relative degrees of se-
mantic regularity of gender alternation in human
nouns vs. adjectives. We compare the quality of

Materials The corpus used in our experiments
is the concatenation of FRWAC (Baroni et al.,
2009), FRCOW (Schäfer, 2015) and a dump of
French Wikipedia, a total of 14 bln tokens, an-
notated with Coavoux’s (2017) parser. FRWAC
was cleaned to remove sentences containing char-
acters not belonging to standard French and dupli-
cate sentences. This corpus was used to compute a
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a) model (param-
eters: CBOW, negative sampling, window of 5),
referred to as M1, where feminine and masculine
homographs as well as noun and adjective homo-
graphs were disambiguated. HNs were selected
from the GLAWI database (Hathout et al., 2014),
enriched with information from the Lexeur lexicon
(Fabre et al., 2004). To obtain a sample of homo-
geneous frequency, we only selected word forms
occurring between 100 and 1000 times in our cor-
pus. These constraints resulted in 120 HN pairs
and 4874 adjective pairs.

Statistical Results We compute the discrepancy
between predicted vector and observed vector us-
ing both log-normalized rank and euclidean dis-
tance4. The predictions were compared using a
Welch t-test, cf. Table 3. We find that, in terms of
distance, adjective predictions are closer to their
respective targets than HN predictions.

Discussion The observed difference between
adjectives and HNs provides evidence that the se-
mantic relationships between masculine and femi-
nine nouns are less predictable than those between
masculine and feminine adjectives. This is coher-
ent with the hypothesis that masculine and fem-
inine nouns are related by derivation, and hence
entertain a less regular relation than inflectionally
related masculine and feminine adjectives.

4We preferred testing both rank and distance measure-
ments over the more widespread cosine similarity measure
so as to take into account neighborhood structure (Linzen,
2016).

3.2 Similarity of Semantic Effects

Research Question Turning to question 2, we
test whether gender alternations in nouns and ad-
jectives have the same semantic effect. We do so
by comparing the intrinsic and the extrinsic pre-
dictions for adjectives, and the intrinsic and the
extrinsic predictions for HNs.

Statistical Results Using the same materials as
previously, we test whether the two processes
yield similar outputs for the same input. Table 4
presents the Welch t-test results for HNs, and Table
5 reports those for adjectives. All tests highlight a
significant statistical difference between the intrin-
sic and the extrinsic predictions: intrinsic predic-
tions always yield lower measurements.

Discussion Comparing predictability measures
allows us to test the similarity of the semantic ef-
fects of g-gender alternation in HNs and in ad-
jectives. The morphological and syntactic simi-
larity of these processes does not logically imply
a semantic identity; the measurements described
above provide evidence for the opposite.

Perhaps this decline in predictability indicates
a difference between the meaning of g-gender for
nouns and adjectives. However, it might also be
due to an imbalance in the data: we compared hu-
man nouns, where g-gender plausibly signals s-
gender, with all adjectives, despite the fact that
many adjective tokens describe inanimate enti-
ties and hence cannot receive any interpretation in
terms of s-gender. To assess this, we need to exam-
ine how the human reference of entities described
by adjectives influences their distributional prop-
erties.

178



4 Experiment 2: Differences among
adjectives

Research Question Adjectives describing pri-
marily humans might be more similar to HNs than
other adjectives: they should mostly share the
same context and convey similar s-gender infor-
mation. If so, the more an adjective is used to
qualify HNs rather than other nouns, the more sim-
ilar its gender shift will be to the mean shift of
HNs. Adjective shifts can then be expected to ex-
press a continuous trend from adjectives primar-
ily used to describe humans (e.g. talentueux, tal-
entueuse, ‘talented’) to those not necessarily de-
scribing humans (e.g. grand, grande, ‘tall’), and
to those (almost) never describing human referents
(e.g. plénier, plénière, ‘plenary’).

Materials We compute the mean HN gender
shift and compare it to the shift vector for each pair
of adjectives. The same set of HNs extracted from
GLAWI and Lexeur was used as in the previous ex-
periment. We only considered HNs occurring at
least 50 times to compute this mean shift. Ad-
jectives were extracted from the GLAWI database;
for each adjective we also computed its number of
occurrences (in either gender) as the modifier of
a HN on the basis of the dependency annotation
by Coavoux’s (2017) parser. When divided by the
total number of occurrences of the adjective, this
defines a ratio of usage as qualifying a HN. As
with HNs, we only considered adjective forms oc-
curring more than 50 times in our corpus for this
experiment, resulting in a total of 15624 adjective
pairs.

Statistical Results The hypothesis was tested
using a mixed-effects model. Linear effects in-
clude log-frequency and shift size (factors of sta-
tistical noise), as well as the human qualification
ratio. The lexical identity of the adjective was
used as a random effect. To obtain a normal dis-
tribution, the dependent variable was transformed
to � log(log( 1

cos( ~Aif � ~Aim, ~mN )
)) with ~Aif � ~Aim

the shift for a given adjective and ~mN the mean
noun shift, then rescaled between 0 and 1 for inter-
pretabilty purposes. Note that the dependent vari-
able is monotonic with respect to cosine similarity.

The model was run using the R-Studio LME4
library (Bates et al., 2015), and converged to the
results described in 6. All predictors were deemed
significant. An analysis of residuals showed that

10.20 < 10�15

Shift size �0.0140 �40.38 < 10�15

Table 6: Fixed effects for model of homogeneity of
gender contrast in adjectives

the model is sound and accurate. The quantita-
tively most important effect is associated with the
ratio, which contributes to higher cosine values.

Discussion The model highlights the impor-
tance of the type of nouns that the adjective quali-
fies to the semantic effect of the g-gender alterna-
tion. It stresses that regularity of gender alterna-
tion does not hold in an absolute fashion, and that
the semantic contrasts between two related words
is modulated by their common lexical semantics.

The precise nature of the sub-regularity indi-
cates that adjective g-gender alternation in some
cases resembles that of nouns. This provides an
objective basis to disambiguate adjectives accord-
ing to their usage. We can now use this informa-
tion to tease apart adjectives which are semanti-
cally comparable to human nouns from those that
are not.

5 Experiment 3: Comparing HNs to two
classes of adjectives

The next experiment aims at studying g-gender al-
ternation within three groups: human noun qual-
ifying adjectives (HQAs), non-human noun quali-
fying adjectives (NHQAs), and HNs.

5.1 Stability of contrast

Research Question We first compare intrinsic
predictions pairwise to assess the relative regular-
ity of our three classes. Since NHQAs modify inan-
imate or abstract nouns, which do not possess an
s-gender, we expect a different degree of regularity
within NHQAs than within HQAs.

Materials We extract from the GLAWI database
nouns which can only refer to humans, as well as
nouns which never refer to humans. We define
NHQAs as the adjectives which only qualify nouns
that never refer to humans, and HQAs as the adjec-
tives which only qualify nouns that always refer to
humans.

Predictors diff. Adj. p-val.
HNs vs. HQAs �0.00783 0.79589
HNs vs. NHQAs 0.04846 0.00741
NHQAs vs. HQAs �0.05629 0.00005

Table 7: Tukey HSD test results for distance mea-
surements of intrinsic predictions in model M2

A new model, dubbed M2, is computed so as
to provide a distinct representation for HNs, HQAs
and NHQAs. We once again use a word2vec model
(CBOW, 5 negative samples, window of 5). In this
M2 model, we disambiguate feminine vs. mascu-
line, adjectives vs. nouns, and HQAs vs. NHQAs vs.
ambiguous usages of adjectives.

Consistently with our first experiment, we only
consider items occurring between 100 and 1000
times. However, this constraint resulted in sets
of very different sizes: 118 noun pairs, 481 HQA
pairs and 5074 NHQA pairs. Our NHQA sample is
an order of magnitude bigger than the other classes
and, more importantly, constitutes less of a natural
class semantically. Such a disbalance might im-
pact the results, therefore it was necessary to select
the most cohesive group of NHQAs. This was done
by retrieving the bottom-most cluster containing
enough samples from UPGMA hierarchical cluster-
ing5 and resulted in a set of 101 NHQA pairs.

Statistical Results We compare three morpho-
logical processes simultaneously, conducting an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to see if a given
measure could discriminate the different pro-
cesses; if it does, we apply Tukey’s Honest Signif-
icant Difference (HSD) test to provide estimated
factor and adjusted probabilities for each pair of
processes. In all the case studies shown here,
ANOVAs give strong evidence for differences with
the processes (p < 10�4, both for Euclidian dis-
tance and log rank). We report only HSD test re-
sults in the interest of space.

The adjusted p-values for distance of the Tukey
HSD test in Table 7 underscore no significant dif-
ference between nouns and HQAs, but NHQAs are
shown to yield lower measurements than HQAs
and HNs; both p-values are under 0.05. This sug-

5 We tested using a Tukey HSD test whether class influ-
enced pairwise distances measures within groups of distinct
gender and class. NHQAs initially introduced a difference of
ten times what we observed for other classes. With clustering,
we observed a variation of means of 0.016 ± 0.008. Apply-
ing the same constraint to HQAs as well made HQAs overly
cohesive but did not substantially affect the results.

Predictors Diff. Adj. p-val.
HNs vs. HQAs �0.62057 0.04685
HNs vs. NHQAs 0.85721 0.03510
NHQAs vs. HQAs �1.47778 < 10�15

Table 8: Tukey HSD test results for log rank mea-
surements of intrinsic predictions in model M2

gests that in terms of distance NHQAs are more
regular than nouns and HQAs, and that nouns and
HQAs cannot be really distinguished from one an-
other in terms of regularity.

Rank measurements, cf. Table 8, accordingly
highlight the same difference between NHQAs on
the one hand and nouns and HQAs on the other.
Moreover, adjusted p-values indicate that there is
a significant difference in measurements not only
when comparing nouns and HQAs to NHQAs, but
also when comparing nouns to HQAs. This sug-
gests that NHQAs embody the most regular pro-
cess, followed by HNs, and that HQAs correspond
to the least regular process.

Discussion The hypotheses that this experiment
tested were that HQA g-gender alternation was
more similar to HN g-gender alternation than
NHQA due to similarity in lexical meaning, and
that NHQA pairs exhibited more regular shifts than
HQA pairs.

A significant difference between the two pro-
cesses was found: NHQAs yield lower rank and
distance measurements than HQAs. It is however
noteworthy that the difference between the mea-
surements for the two processes is very small, so
the distinction it introduces is subtle.

Another point of interest is that HN pairs ex-
hibit more regularity than HQAs, but less than
NHQAs. This suggests that, when compared to
semantically comparable adjectives, human nouns
fall within the scope of semantic regularity ex-
pected for inflectional alternations. This more
careful experiment hence disproves the tentative
conclusions reached after experiment 1: if any-
thing, distributional evidence points to an inflec-
tional status for g-gender alternations in human
nouns.

5.2 Similarity of Semantic Effects
Research Question We now turn to the com-
parison of extrinsic and intrinsic predictions. The
expectation is that g-gender alternation of HNs is
more similar to that of HQAs than to the alterna-

tion of NHQAs, due to their greater semantic relat-
edness; moreover, if g-gender alternation in nouns
is indeed derivational, we expect nouns to diverge
significantly from adjectives.

Statistical Results We start with examining pre-
dictions for HNs. An ANOVA shows that both dis-
tance and log-scaled rank measurements highlight
a variation among the different prediction setups.
We thus perform Tukey HSD tests, summarized in
Table 9, to study more precisely what these dif-
ferences in distance and log rank entail. From
distance measurements (cf. 9a), we see that using
information from either HQA g-gender alternation
or NHQA g-gender alternation clearly deteriorates
the measurements for HNs. Moreover, no signif-
icant statistical effect is attested when comparing
the two extrinsic predictions.

When studying log rank measurements (cf. 9b),
the same deterioration can be observed. However,
log rank measurements also reveal a significant
difference when comparing the two extrinsic pre-
dictions: NHQAs yield even higher measurements
than HQAs, suggesting that the semantics of HQA
alternation are more similar to that of HNs than the
gender alternation of NHQAs.

The second group of extrinsic predictions con-
cerns HQAs. Tukey HSD tests in Table 10 display
the same results as with nouns, both in terms of
distance (cf. 10a) and in terms of log-rank (cf. 10b)
which clearly indicate that noun-based extrinsic
predictions are a better fit than NHQA-based ex-
trinsic predictions. This might entail that there is
a gradation of semantic effects’ similarity: HNs
would be more similar to HQAs than NHQAs.

The last group of extrinsic predictions are those

for NHQAs. As previously, after an ANOVA, a
Tukey HSD test is conducted for each pair of mea-
surements; the results are summarized in Table
11. When studying either distance (cf. 11a) or
log-rank (cf. 11b) variation, we observe both that
intrinsic prediction performs better than extrinsic
predictions, and that the extrinsic prediction based
on HNs yields better measurements than the one
based on HQAs. This implies that the semantic ef-
fects of NHQAs are more similar to those of HNs
than to those of HQAs.

Discussion Intrinsic prediction is systematically
better than any of the extrinsic predictions, high-
lighting that all three groups embody different se-
mantic processes. We, however, observe a gra-
dient: gender alternations for HQAs and HNs are
more similar to each other than to NHQAs, and
HNs are somewhere in between the two classes of
adjectives. HNs and HQAs form a more cohesive
group from which NHQAs differ systematically.

Although the cohesiveness of HNs and HQAs
might be explained by the mechanics of distri-
butional semantics, this in and of itself does not
suffice to explain the gradient effect we observe.
One could tentatively conclude from these facts
that s-gender plays a greater role for HQAs com-
pared to HNs. The concreteness of HNs may en-
tail that all speakers agree on their semantics: a
woman manning a checkout desk shall necessar-
ily be une caissière; on the other hand, whether to
use a specific adjective, such as délicat, to qualify
a human referent, depends on the speaker’s judg-
ment which can be sensitive to s-gender. In other
words, the person at the cash register is objectively
a cashier regardless of their s-gender, but the stan-
dards of being delicate can be different for men
and women, which in turn might explain the rela-
tively idiosyncratic character of g-gender alterna-
tion in HQAs.

6 General Discussion

In this paper, we have detailed a data-driven
methodology which enables a comparison of the
distributional effects of a grammatical feature
across categories. This methodology has allowed
us to make several observations on g-gender alter-
nation in HNs and adjectives.

In the first set of experiments, we compared the
grammatical gender feature of French HNs to its
counterpart in adjectives. We observed a greater
semantic regularity in adjectives, which we ten-
tatively attributed to the status of the gender dis-
tinction in nouns vs. adjectives: pairs of nouns are
related by derivation, but pairs of adjectives are
related by inflection. In addition, the comparison
of intrinsic and extrinsic predictions highlighted a
clear semantic difference between g-gender con-
trasts in nouns and adjectives.

Experiment 2 showed that another factor comes
into play: the shift for an average adjective pair is
more likely to resemble that of nouns, when the
adjective pair itself is used to qualify HNs. This
lead us to compare HNs with HQAs and NHQAs in
the following section.

In the last set of experiments, g-gender variation
in HNs was shown to be more semantically regular
than in HQAs. Hence the provisional conclusion
of the first set of experiments was disproved: the
apparent semantic irregularity of HNs was due to
comparing them with a semantically discommen-
surate class of adjectives. On the other hand, the

experiment still highlighted that all three groups
constituted distinct processes.

Although all three types of gender shifts sig-
nificantly differed from one another, we observed
that HQAs and HNs formed a more cohesive group.
We can derive two conclusions from this. First,
g-gender alternation within a category (adjec-
tives) can vary more than across categories (adjec-
tives vs. nouns); second, correlation with s-gender
in both nouns and adjectives lead to a greater
commonality in gender alternations. This result
corroborates, on the basis of distributional data,
the mounting sociolinguistic (McConnell-Ginet,
2013, a.o.) and psycholinguistic (Gygax et al.,
2012, a.o.) evidence that, when referring to hu-
mans, g-gender always has some interpretive ef-
fects. In addition, we have shown that g-gender
alternation of HNs is more regular than that of
some adjectives. Given that inflection is assumed
to be more semantically regular than derivation
(Robins, 1959; Dressler, 1989), this suggests that
gender alternations in nouns should be seen as in-
flectional, as argued on independent grounds by
(Bonami and Boyé, in press).

This work has addressed theoretical issues re-
garding one grammatical feature from a data-
driven perspective. Future research will determine
to what extent our results are specific to gender
or generalize to other grammatical features such
as number. Complementarily, we plan to look in
more detail at the specific contribution of gender
in languages where the relationship between g-
gender and s-gender is different than in French. Fi-
nally, we plan to test the potential impact of social
bias on the usage of gender forms of HQAs, which
was suggested in the preceding section, both from
the distributional and from the psycholinguistic
point of view.
