Abstract 

Starting from an existing lexical-conceptual structure (LCS) Verb Database of 500 verb classes 

(containing a total of 9525 verb entries), we automatically derived a resource that supports ar-

gument identification for language understanding and argument realization for language gene-

ration. The extended resource, called STYLUS (SysTematicallY Derived Language USage), 

supports constraints at the syntax-semantics interface through the inclusion of components of 

meaning and collocations. We show that the resulting resource covers three cases of language 

usage patterns both for spatially oriented applications such as dialogue management for robot 

navigation and for non-spatial applications such as generation of cyber-related notifications. 

1 Introduction* 

This paper presents a derivative resource, called STYLUS (SysTematicallY Derived Language US-

age), produced through extraction of a set of argument realizations from lexical-semantic representati-

ons for a range of different verb classes (Appendix A). Prior work (Jackendoff, 1996; Levin, 1993; 

Olsen, 1994; Kipper et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2017) has suggested a close relation between un-

derlying lexicalsemantic structures of predicates and their syntactic argument structure. Subsequent 

work (Dorr and Voss, 2018) argued that regular patterns of language usage can be systematically deri-

ved from lexicalsemantic representations and used in applications such as dialogue management for 

robot navigation. The latter investigation focused on the spatial dimension, e.g., motion and direction. 

We adopt the view that this systematicity also holds for verbs in the non-spatial dimension, includ-

ing those that have been metaphorically related to the spatial dimension by a range of corpus-based 

techniques (Dorr and Olsen, 2018). We consider one example of a non-spatial application: generation 

of cyber-related textual notifications. We argue that this application requires knowledge at the syn-

taxsemantics interface that is analogous to spatial knowledge for robot navigation. A recent survey of 

narrative generation techniques (Kybartas and Bidarra, 2017) highlights several important components 

of narrative generation (including a story, plot, space, and discourse for telling the story), leaving open 

the means for surface-realization of arguments from an underlying lexical-semantic structure. 

STYLUS is designed to accommodate mechanisms for filling this gap. 

STYLUS extends an existing Lexical-Conceptual Structure Verb Database (LVD) (Dorr et al., 2001) 

that includes 500 verb classes (9525 verb entries) with structurally-specified information about realiza-

tion of arguments for both spatial and non-spatial verbs. STYLUS was produced through systematic 

derivation of regular patterns of language usage (Block, Overlap, Fill) without requiring manual anno-

tation. The next section reviews related work, starting with the spatial underpinnings of the original 

LVD. Following this, we describe our extensions and present examples for two applications: natural 

language processing for robot navigation and generation of cyber-related notifications. 

2 Background 

2.1 Spatial Language Understanding 

Spatial language understanding has made great strides in recent years, with the emergence of language 

resources and standards for capturing spatial information, e.g., (ISO-24617-7, 2014), which provide 

guidelines for annotating spatial information in English language texts (Pustejovsky and Lee, 2017;

Pustejovsky and Yocum, 2014). This work differs from the perspective adopted for STYLUS in that it 

provides annotation guidelines for training systems for spatial information extraction, and so it does 

not focus on generalized mappings at the syntax-semantics interface. 

The Semantic Annotation Framework (semAF) identifies places, paths, spatial entities, and spatial 

relations that can be used to associate sequences of processes and events in news articles (Pustejovsky 

et al., 2011). Prepositions and particles (near, off) and verbs of position and movement (lean, swim) 

have corresponding components of meanings and collocations adopted in this paper. 

Spatial role labeling using holistic spatial semantics (i.e., analysis at the level of the full utterance) 

has been used for identifying spatial relations between objects (Kordjamshidi et al., 2011). The associ-

ation between thematic roles and their corresponding surface realizations has been investigated pre-

viously, including in the LCS formalism (described next), but Kordjamshidi et al’s approach also ties 

into deeper notions such as region of space and frame of reference. 

2.2 Lexical-Conceptual Structure Verb Database (LVD) 

Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; Dorr, 1993; Dowty, 1979; 

Guerssel et al., 1985) has been used for wide-ranging applications, including interlingual machine 

translation (Voss and Dorr, 1995; Habash and Dorr, 2002), lexical acquisition (Habash et al., 2006), 

crosslanguage information retrieval (Levow et al., 2000), language generation (Traum and Habash, 

2000), and intelligent language tutoring (Dorr, 1997). 

LCS incorporates primitives whose combination captures syntactic generalities, i.e., actions and en-

tities must be systematically related to a syntactic structure: GO, STAY, BE, GO-EXT, ORIENT, and 

also an ACT primitive developed by Dorr and Olsen (1997). LCS is grounded in the spatial domain 

and is naturally extended to non-spatial domains, as specified by fields. For example, the spatial di-

mension of the LCS representation corresponds to the (Loc)ational field, which underlies the meaning 

of John traveled from Chicago to Boston in the LCS [John GOLoc [From Chicago] [To Boston]]. This 

is straightforwardly extended to the (Temp)oral field to represent analogous meanings such as The me-

eting went from 7pm to 9pm in the LCS [Meeting GOTemp [From 7pm] [To 9pm]]. 

The LVD developed in prior work (Dorr et al., 2001) includes a set of LCS templates classified ac-

cording to an extension of Levin (1993)’s 192 classes to a total of 500 classes covering 9525 verb en-

tries (an additional 5500+ verb entries beyond the original 4000+ verb entries). The first 44 classes 

were added beyond the original set of semantic classes (Dorr and Jones, 1996). The remaining classes 

were derived through aspectual distinctions to yield a set of LCS classes that were finer-grained than 

the original Levin classes (Olsen et al., 1997). Each LCS class consists of a set of verbs and, in several 

cases, the classes included non-Levin words (those not in Levin (1993)), derived semi-automatically 

(Dorr, 1997). 

The original LVD provides a mapping of lexical-semantic structures to their surface realization. 

This mapping serves as a foundation for the enrichments that yield STYLUS. The new resource bene-

fits from decades of prior study that led to the LVD. Specifically, Levin’s classes are based on signifi-

cant corpus analysis and have been validated in numerous within-language studies (Levin and Rappa-

port Hovav, 1995; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 1998) and cross-language studies (Guerssel et al., 

1985; Levin, 2015). Thus, STYLUS is expected to have an important downstream impact, in both 

depth and breadth, for future linguistic investigations and computational applications. 

2.3 Syntax-Semantics Interface 

Prior work (Jackendoff, 1996; Levin, 1993; Dorr and Voss, 1993; Voss and Dorr, 1995; Kipper et al., 

2004; Kipper et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2017) suggests that there is a close relation between un-

derlying lexical-semantic structures of verbs and nominal predicates and their syntactic argument 

structure. VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2004) reinforces the view in this resource paper, that prepositions 

and their relation with verb classes serve as significant predictors of semantic content, but does not 

leverage an inner structure of events for compositional derivation of argument realizations. 

FrameNet also sits at the syntax-semantics interface (Fillmore, 2002), with linking generalizations 

based on valency to map semantic frames (events and participants) to their corresponding surface 

structure. Osswald and Van Valin (2014) point out that such generalizations are hindered by bottom-

up/datadriven frames and they argue for a richer frame representation with an inner structure of an e-

vent. This notion of “inner structure” is seen in the work of Voss et al. (1998) and Dorr and Voss 



59

(2018), which suggests that the generation of a preposition (in English) is dependent on both the inter-

nal semantics of the predicate and structural idiosyncracies at the syntax-semantics interface. As such, 

the following two definitions are fundamental to the syntax-semantics mappings adopted in STYLUS1: 

• Component of meaning: Implicit semantic unit, such as UPWARD for the verb elevate 

• Collocation: Explicit juxtaposition of a particular word, such as up for the verb lift in “lift up” 

Leveraging these definitions, Section 3 describes the enrichments necessary to produce STYLUS 

without requiring training on annotated data. 

3 Addition of Components of Meaning and Collocations to LVD Classes 

We investigate the systematic derivation of language usage patterns for both understanding and gener-

ation of language and leverage this investigation to simplify and enrich the LVD presented in Section 

2. The resulting resource, STYLUS (downloadable as described in Appendix 5), relies on lexically 

implicit components of meaning and lexically explicit collocations (as defined above) to cover three 

cases of language usage patterns applicable to language understanding and generation: 

• Block refers to components of meaning that do not co-occur with their collocational counter-
parts, e.g., elevate and ascend include the UPWARD component and thus do not co-occur with 

the collocation up; 

• Overlap refers to components of meaning that optionally co-occur with their collocational 
counterparts, e.g., lift and raise include the UPWARD component but optionally co-occur with 

the collocation up; 

• Fill refers to underspecified components of meaning that fall into one of two cases:  

- Oblig: obligatory co-occurrence with collocations, e.g., the verb put does not specify a direc-
tion and thus always co-occurs with a collocation such as up; 

- Opt: optional co-occurrence with collocations, e.g., the motion verb move does not specify a 
direction but optionally co-occurs with a collocation such as up. 

STYLUS contains simplified verb classes from the LVD, omitting the full LCS structures and the-

matic roles while adding prepositional collocations and components of meaning. For example, in the 

LVD Verbs of inherently directed motion (Class 51.1.a in (Levin, 1993)), the verb leave need not co-

occur with a prepositional collocate (e.g., leave the room) whereas the verb depart can co-occur with 

from (e.g., departed from the room). For either case, the component of meaning is uniformly “GO TO 

(outside the room) FROM (inside of the room),” and the collocation from is optional: 

LVD Class Entry: 

(:NUMBER "51.1.a" 

 :NAME "Verbs Inherently Directed Motion / -from/to" 

 :WORDS (advance arrive ascend climb come depart descend enter escape  

     exit fall flee go leave plunge recede return rise tumble) 
:NON_LEVIN_WORDS (approach come! defect head) 

:LCS (go loc (* thing 2) 

((* from 3) loc (thing 2) (at loc (thing 2) (thing 4))) 

((* to 5) loc (thing 2) ([at] loc (thing 2) (thing 6))) 

(!!+ingly 26)) 

:THETA_ROLES ((1 "_th,src(from),goal(towards)") 

(1 "_th,goal,src(from)") 

(1 "_th,src(from),goal(to)"))) 

Derivation of components of meaning and collocations, along with their obligatoriness or optionali-

ty, was achieved by a simple automated procedure, without manual annotation. Components of mean-

                                                 
1 Teletype font is used for components of meaning such as UPWARD. Several examples throughout this paper were purposely 

selected to illustrate the full range of syntactic realizations for the concept of “upwardness.” Other verbs and collocations 

could easily have been selected (e.g., lower with the collocation down), but a varied selection of lexical distinctions would 

confound the illustration of more general distinctions at the syntax-semantics interface. 



60

ing were derived either from the LCS structure or from verb-prepositions pairs in a “Categorial Varia-

tion” database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). For example, the LCS above (from the :LCS slot) includes a 

sublexical component of meaning, ((* from 3) loc (thing 2) (at loc (thing 2) (thing 4))), that maps op-

tionally to a preposition from in the surface form (as in exit (from) the room). Prepositional colloca-

tions (such as from) were derived from the thematic roles (in the :THETA ROLES slot) of the original 

LVD. These prepositions are specified in parentheses, and are preceded either by a comma (,) for op-

tional collocations or by underscore (_) for obligatory collocations. In the example above, the theme is 

obligatory (_th), whereas the source (,src) and goal (,goal) are optional. Verbs are thus paired 

with their corresponding prepositions by virtue of their class membership in the final STYLUS re-

source2: 

STYLUS Class Entry: 

(:NUMBER "51.1.a" 

 :NAME "Verbs Inherently Directed Motion / -from/to" 

 :WORDS (advance arrive ascend climb come depart descend enter escape  

     exit fall flee go leave plunge recede return rise tumble) 

 :NON_LEVIN_WORDS (approach come! defect head) 

 :COLLOCATIONS ("from" "to" "towards") 

 :COMPONENT_OF_MEANING (FROM, AWAY_FROM, OUT_OF, OR, UP_TO, UP,      

  BEFORE, INTO, TO)) ;; Fill-Opt <<SPATIAL>> 

The derivative collocations and components of meaning obviate the need for spelling out the full 

LCS, thus ensuring a more compact representation of the original LVD. In addition, the Block, Over-

lap, Fill-Oblig, and Fill-Opt designations were easily derived automatically from the 

:COLLOCATIONS and :COMPONENT OF MEANING slots according to the four rules below: 

(1)  Tag Block if :COMPONENT OF MEANING filled and :COLLOCATIONS not filled, e.g., Face the doorway; 

(2)  Tag Overlap if :COMPONENT OF MEANING and :COLLOCATIONS both filled, and use of comma (,)  

 in front of the corresponding thematic role, e.g., “,src(behind)” for Follow (behind) the car; 

(3)  Tag Fill-Oblig if :COMPONENT OF MEANING and :COLLOCATIONS both filled, and use of undersco- 

 re (_) in front of the corresponding thematic role, e.g., “_goal(to))” for Put the box onto the table; 

(4)  Tag Fill-Opt if :COMPONENT OF MEANING not filled and either :COLLOCATIONS not filled or use of  

       comma (,) in front of a modifier role, as in Move the box (to the table). 

Finally, each entry was automatically tagged <<SPATIAL>> if the LCS indicated a Loc(ational) or 

Poss(essional) field in association with the underlying primitive (GO, BE, etc.). All non-spatial entries 

were automatically tagged <<NON-SPATIAL>>. 

4 STYLUS: Spatial and Non-Spatial Subset of LVD Classes 

The number of classes associated with the language usage patterns introduced above is in the table 

below, with tallies for the full set of LVD classes, the spatial subset, and non-spatial subset.3 Repre-

sentative examples of verbs in both the spatial subset (e.g., for robot navigation) and the non-spatial 

subset (e.g., cyber-notification generation) are provided in Table 1. 

Interestingly, the Spatial Subset of classes is sizeable (44% of the entire set). However, STYLUS 

development has yielded generalizations beyond prior LCS-inspired work that focused strictly on spa-

tial verbs (Voss et al., 1998). Most notably, the Block, Overlap and Fill patterns are generalizable to a 

high number of LCS classes that are non-spatial as well. The obvious cases are those with non-zero 

values in Table 1 (Overlap and Fill): e.g., tread on (Overlap), cram for (Fill-Oblig), and blend together 

(Fill-Opt). However, although the number of non-spatial Block cases appears to be 0, the correspond-

ing 7 spatial usages also extend to metaphorical extensions, e.g., in the phrase elevated her spirits, the 

use of “up” is blocked. Although STYLUS encodes elevate as a spatial verb, this same lexico-semantic 

                                                 
2 In the original LVD, the :SPATIAL COMPONENT OF MEANING field name was used. More recently, such components 

have been determined to be useful for non-spatial verbs as well. For example, admire (in class 31.2.c) has a toward compo-

nent of meaning, whereas abhor has an away-from component of meaning. Thus, the more general :COMPONENT OF 

MEANING field name has been subsequently adopted. 
3 N/A refers to verb classes whose members take bare NP or S arguments. Intrans refers to Intransitive verbs. 



61

property applies for its non-spatial (metaphorical) usage. Analogously, STYLUS encodes the con-

trasting verb lift as a spatial verb, designated as Overlap, to enable lifted up her hand. A metaphorical 

(non-spatial) usage would be lift up her spirits. Such cases indicate that Block, Overlap, and Fill apply 

even more broadly than was conceived in the original LVD—which means that the numbers in the 

Non-Spatial Subset column above are understated and would benefit from additional analysis of meta-

phorical extensions.

Table 1: Language Usage Patterns for Spatial and Non-Spatial Verbs with Representative Examples 

To explore the broader applicability of the Block, Overlap, and Fill patterns, we first examined 

verbs in the Spatial Subset and determined that many of them are among those relevant to robot navi-

gation, e.g., move, go, advance, drive, return, rotate, and turn. Others are easily accommodated by 

extending classes—without modification to the spatial language usage patterns described above. For 

example, back up matches the class template containing advance, and pivot matches the class template 

containing rotate. We then considered the Non-Spatial Subset for generation of cyber-related notifica-

tions, a sub-task of an ongoing cyber-attack prediction project (Dalton et al., 2017). We determined 

that the Fill, Overlap, and Block patterns apply to members of the same classes that were relevant to 

robot navigation. Specifically, we examined the four classes shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Class-Based Patterns for Robot Navigation and Cyber Notification 

Note that Block, Overlap, and Fill can be applied as validity constraints on language usage patterns 

in the spatial domain of human-robot commands (for understanding and generation).4 Corresponding-

ly, for the non-spatial domain of cyber notification generation, these same four classes included other 

class members (e.g., for 9.8 and 9.1) or meaning extensions of the same class members (e.g., for 

47.8.1 and 11.2) that exhibited the same language usage patterns as their robot navigation counterparts. 

5 Conclusion and Future Work 

STYLUS provides the basis for both understanding and generation in the spatial robot navigation do-

main and for generation in the non-spatial cyber notification domain. A larger scale application and 

evaluation of the effectiveness of STYLUS for understanding and generation in these two domains is a 

                                                 
4 An asterisk at the start of a sentence indicates an invalid generated form. Verbs in the designated class are italicized. 



62

future area of study. A starting point is an ongoing Bot Language project (Marge et al., 2017) that has 

heretofore focused on dialogue annotation (Traum et al., 2018) and has not yet incorporated lexicon-

based knowledge necessary for automatically detecting incomplete, vague, or implicit navigation 

commands. 

Another avenue for exploration is the enhancement of cyber notifications through systematic deri-

vation of mappings to surface realizations for other parts of speech. This work will involve access to a 

“Categorial Variation” database (CatVar) (Habash and Dorr, 2003) to map verbs in the LCS classes to 

their nominalized and adjectivalized forms. For example, the CatVar entry for infect includes the nom-

inalized form infection, which provides additional options that may be more fluent in cyber-related 

notifications, e.g., viral infection of system might be considered less stilted than virus will infect sys-

tem. 

Although STYLUS is strictly for English, the lexical-semantic foundation from which it is derived 

has been investigated for a range of multilingual applications (Habash et al., 2006; Cabezas et al., 

2001; Levow et al., 2000). Future work will examine the derivation of this resource for non-English 

languages.

Appendices 

Appendix A. Supplemental Material: STYLUS 

STYLUS (SysTematicallY Derived Language USage) is a simplified and extended version of Lexical 

Conceptual Structure Verb Database (LVD) (Dorr et al., 2001) with 500 classes of verbs that incorpo-

rate components of meaning and prepositional collocations (in ascii .txt format). The classes include 

over 9500 verb entries—about 5500 entries beyond the original 4000+ entries in Levin 1993. This re-
