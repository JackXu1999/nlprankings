Abstract 

Over the last few years, machine translation (MT) has transformed from an academic research 
platform into a productivity or gisting tool adopted by several end users. In this talk, I will describe 
some of the business and technical MT-related challenges faced by language service providers 
nowadays. I will describe the approach we take at bmmt GmbH to create innovative industry solutions 
driven by MT.
