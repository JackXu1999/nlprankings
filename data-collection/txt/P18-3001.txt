Abstract

In recent years, the number of texts has
grown rapidly. For example, most review-
based portals, like Yelp or Amazon, con-
tain thousands of user-generated reviews.
It is impossible for any human reader to
process even the most relevant of these
documents. The most promising tool to
solve this task is a text summarization.
Most existing approaches, however, work
on small, homogeneous, English datasets,
and do not account to multi-linguality,
opinion shift, and domain effects. In
this paper, we introduce our research plan
to use neural networks on user-generated
travel reviews to generate summaries that
take into account shifting opinions over
time. We outline future directions in sum-
marization to address all of these issues.
By resolving the existing problems, we
will make it easier for users of review-sites
to make more informed decisions.

1 Introduction

In recent years, amount of available text corpora
has been growing rapidly with increasing popular-
ity of web. Users produce a huge amount of text
every day. With a larger amount of text and infor-
mation included within it, it becomes impossible
for people to read all the texts and it leads to in-
formation overload. For a common human, it is
not possible to read all the available text even if he
reads only all the most relevant ones. The task
of text summarization is known for a very long
period. In late 50s Luhn (Luhn, 1958) tried to
create abstract of documents automatically. Over
decades there have been many summarization sys-
tems dealing with different forms of summariza-
tion. This task belongs to one of the most chal-

lenging tasks in natural language processing. The
task of text summarization can be particularly im-
portant for decision making or relevance judg-
ments (Nenkova and McKeown, 2011).

Automatic text summarization became very
useful and also important tool to help the user ob-
tain as much information as possible without the
necessity to read all the original documents. Many
definitions of text summarization exist. Text sum-
mary can be defined as a text produced from one
or more texts that contains the same information as
the original text and is no longer than half of the
original text (Hovy and Lin, 1998). Mani (Mani,
2001) defined the goal of summarization as a pro-
cess of finding the source of information, extract-
ing content from it and presenting the most impor-
tant content to the user in a concise form and in a
manner sensitive to needs of user’s application.

We can divide techniques of summarization into
two categories: abstractive and extractive summa-
rization (Gambhir and Gupta, 2017). Extractive
summarization aims to choose parts of the original
document such as sentence part, whole sentence
or paragraph. Abstractive summarization wants
to get paraphrase content of the original docu-
ment with respect to cohesion and concise of out-
put summary. Selection of the text section in ex-
tractive summarization leads to a partial loss of an
output cohesion, which abstractive summarization
tries to accomplish.

In last few years, approaches based on neural
networks became very popular for summarization
task (Rush et al., 2015). A specific branch of
text summarization is a summarization of opinions
from the human-generated text. We can summa-
rize opinions from customer reviews or comments
on social networks. This problem differs from a
standard summarization task due to a number of
repetitive and redundant information. There can
be also a problem with polarity of opinions be-



2

tween different users. This types of summary can
be very useful for both a customer of products and
a product owner. Opinion summarization can be
particularly important for decision making (Yuan
et al., 2015). This summarization type can also
show trends in opinions collected from comments
on social networks, especially when a number of
text entries grows very fast.

In this work, we also discuss analysis of spe-
cific aspect of opinion summarization: sentiment
analysis of customer reviews. In summarization
task, sentiment information can be viewed as one
of the inputs along with text corpora itself. A dif-
ference between sentiment of text fragments and
sentiment of whole summarization is a very inter-
esting aspect to consider.

The expected contributions of our research are:
(1) overview of a recent development in opin-
ion summarization, (2) assembly of a reason-
ably big dataset for opinion summarization (from
travel based portals), (3) a novel method for opin-
ion summarization based on state-of-the-art neural
network architectures.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 explains recent advances in text summa-
rization. In Section 3, we focus on possibilities in
the area of opinion mining and summarization of
opinions. Future directions in summarization are
drawn in Section 4. The research proposal includ-
ing opinion summarization along with a possible
dataset and a planned experiment are described in
Section 5. Final observations and conclusions are
mentioned in Section 6.

2 Text Summarization

In recent years, text summarization has been fo-
cusing on the abstractive summarization with a use
of neural models. In (Rush et al., 2015), the au-
thors showed a way to use a neural network based
on encoder-decoder architecture for creating ab-
stractive summarization on the sentence level. Us-
ing this type of model originates from a task of
machine translation where these models were used
before. The approach presented in (Chopra et al.,
2016) can be considered as a follower of the pre-
vious work. Instead of a feed-forward neural net-
work a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used.
RNN emphasizes the order of input words. The
authors presented conditional RNN with convolu-
tional attention-based encoder.

Ferreira et al. presented a sentence clustering

algorithm to deal with the redundancy and infor-
mation diversity problems (Ferreira et al., 2014).
The algorithm uses the text representation to con-
vert input text into graph model along with four
types of relations between sentences.

A specific yet not very widely used technique is
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). For text
summarization, a framework for abstractive sum-
marization based on the recent development of a
treebank for AMR (Liu et al., 2015) can be em-
ployed. This framework parses source text into a
set of AMR graphs, then the graph is transformed
into a summary graph from which the output sum-
mary is generated.

The use of neural architecture from machine
translation became widely popular and many au-
thors made research in this area. Nallapati et al.
(Nallapati et al., 2016) presented a neural model
for abstractive summarization along with the in-
troduction of a whole new dataset for evaluation
of summarization.

The use of attention mechanism in neural net-
works became widely spread and very popular.
Many works showed usefulness of this mechanism
in other tasks. In summarization task, a work
proposed by See et al. (See et al., 2017) intro-
duced a method based on the principle of encoder-
decoder along with attention distribution of input
text. They used hybrid pointer-generator architec-
ture with a use of the coverage. The pointer mech-
anism tries to solve problem of choosing words ei-
ther to use original word or generate a new one.
The coverage part ensures minimizing repetition
during the text generation in the later parts of the
output. Interesting modification was introduced
by Paulus et al. (Paulus et al., 2017). Their
mechanism modifies standard attention mecha-
nism and also objective function with a combi-
nation of maximum likelihood and cross-entropy
loss. This mechanism is used in a phase of rein-
forcement learning. Tan et al. (Tan et al., 2017)
proposed another modification of attention mech-
anism and their graph-based attention mechanism
was used in a sequence-to-sequence framework.
The goal of the encoder is mapping the input doc-
uments to the vector representation. Then decoder
is used to generate the output sentences. Novelty
of their method lies in using graph-based atten-
tion mechanism in a hierarchical encoder-decoder
framework.

Neural models are widely used for both abstrac-



3

tive and extractive summarization. Nallapati et al.
(Nallapati et al., 2017) presented a neural sequen-
tial model for the extractive summarization of doc-
uments. Visualizing impact of a particular parts of
the input text to output summarization we can con-
sider as other contribution of this paper.

Similarly to other tasks of natural language
processing, convolutional neural networks can be
used for summarization. Yasunaga et al. (Ya-
sunaga et al., 2017) incorporates sentence rela-
tions using Graph Convolutional Network on re-
lation graphs along with the sentence embeddings
obtained from RNN, which were taken as input
node features. This system tries to exploit a repre-
sentational power of neural networks and sentence
relation information which can be encoded in the
graph representation of document clusters.

Much research has been conducted in this field
in recent years. Other interesting modification
can employ latent structure modeling presented in
a framework based on sequence-to-sequence ori-
ented encoder-decoder model which incorporates
a latent structure modeling component (Li et al.,
2017). This model generates abstractive summary
of the latent variables but also of the the discrimi-
native deterministic states.

All aforementioned summarization works were
primarily aimed at summarization of news arti-
cles. There can be also other summarization types
like a summarization of emails (Carenini et al.,
2008; Yousefi-Azar and Hamey, 2017), event-
based summarization (Glavaš and Šnajder, 2014;
Kedzie et al., 2015), personalized summarization
(Díaz and Gervás, 2007; Moro and Bielikova,
2012) and also sentiment-based or opinion sum-
marization described in the next section.

3 Opinion Mining and Summarization

Summarization of opinions is a special type of
summarization. Product and services along with
comments on social networks could consist of
hundreds of entries and could lead to information
overload. Repetition of opinions is one of the ma-
jor differences that contrasts with the summariza-
tion of news. User-generated text often remark-
ably differentiate from news text which is com-
monly widely revised.

3.1 Summarization of Customer Opinions

Summarization of opinions from product reviews
is the most common example of opinion summa-

rization. These reviews often come from stores of
electronics like Amazon. Yuan et al. (Yuan et al.,
2015) presented user study how opinion summa-
rization can help in decision making before con-
sumer purchase.

One of the first works in opinion summarization
could be considered the work of Hu and Liu (Hu
and Liu, 2004). They proposed a set of techniques
for mining and summarizing product reviews. The
main goal of their opinion summarization system
is to provide a feature-based summary.

Tadano et al. proposed method based on evalu-
ative sentence extraction where aspects are judged
by their ratings, tf-idf value and number of men-
tions with similar topic (Tadano et al., 2010).

Summarization approach based on the topical
structure was introduced by Zhan et al. (Zhan
et al., 2009). They presented a topical structure
as a list of significant topics related from a docu-
ment set. To reduce redundancy of sentences they
implemented a method of maximal marginal rele-
vance.

The Opinosis project presented a graph-based
summarization framework (Ganesan et al., 2010).
This framework tries to generate abstractive sum-
marization of highly redundant opinions. Authors
showed that their summaries have better agree-
ment with human summaries compared to the
baseline extractive methods.

Dalal and Zaveri presented application of a
multi-step approach for automatic opinion min-
ing consisting of various phases (Dalal and Za-
veri, 2013). Authors showed that this multi-step
feature-based semi-supervised opinion mining ap-
proach can be successful in identification of opin-
ionated sentences from user reviews.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis can help to
produce a structured summary based on positive
and negative opinion about features of the prod-
uct (Kansal and Toshniwal, 2014). The system
takes into consideration not only sentence infor-
mation, but also pieces of information from other
sentences or reviews called contextual informa-
tion. The authors also showed that polarity of
words can be different even within one domain.

Kurian and Asokan presented a method with
the cross-domain sentiment classification along
with the distributional similarity of opinion words
(Kurian and Asokan, 2015). This method helps
to classify and summarize product reviews and, in
contrast with other methods, it does not require la-



4

beled data from the target domain or other lexical
resources.

Unlike other opinion summarization systems
dealing with sentiment polarity, another study for-
mulated opinion summarization as a community
leader detection problem (Zhu et al., 2015). Au-
thors proposed a graph-based method to identify
informative sentences and evaluated method on
product reviews. The study proposed algorithms
for leaders detection in the sentence graph.

A system named Gist (Lovinger et al., 2017) in-
tends to deal with a large amount of text and au-
tomatically summarizes it into informative and ac-
tionable key sentences. Gist tries to summarize
original reviews into the short text consisting of
a few key sentences that will capture the overall
sentiment about the product.

A kind of opinion summarization could be a
summarization of travel reviews to give feedback
for quality of hotels, restaurants or other services.
A clustering based method for summarization of
hotel reviews was proposed by Hu et al. (Hu et al.,
2017). They also showed additional information
as author’s reputation or creation date could have
a huge impact on relevant summary creation. Raut
et al. (Raut and Londhe, 2014) presented machine
learning and Senti-WordNet method for mining
opinions from hotel reviews and also a method for
sentence relevant scoring.

3.2 Summarization of Community Answers

Along with the summarization of customer re-
views, a very important summarization type con-
siders comments on social networks or answers in
question answering (QA) systems as input entries.
Investigation in this forms of text entries can lead
to easier decision making.

A sub-modular function-based framework was
presented by Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2014). This
framework can be used for query-focused opinion
summarization. Authors evaluated this framework
in QA and blog dataset. Statistically learned sen-
tence relevance along with information coverage
with respect to diverse topics are encoded as sub-
modular functions.

Work of Lloret et al. (Lloret et al., 2015) deals
both with the summarization of opinions in social
networks and opinions in product reviews. Their
method can be characterized with an integration
of sentence simplification, but also regeneration of
sentence and also internal concept representation

in the summarization task. The method tries to be
able to generate abstractive summaries.

There are many topics in this area which can
lead to very interesting observations. Guo et al.
(Guo et al., 2015) proposed a model for opin-
ion summarization of highly contrastive opinions
particularly for controversial issues. They inte-
grated expert opinions with ordinary opinions to
create an output of contrastive sentence pairs. The
study also presented this method as a unified way
for users to better summarize opinions concerning
controversial issues.

Another study explores opinion summarization
of the spontaneous conversation (Wang and Liu,
2015). Phone conversation corpus was annotated
in this study and authors investigated two methods
of extractive summarization, graph-based with in-
corporating topic and sentiment information and
supervised method which cast this problem as a
classification problem.

A study from Li et al. deals also with opinion
summarization in blogging (Li et al., 2016). They
proposed a convolutional neural network for opin-
ion summarization based on recent deep-learning
research. Maximal marginal relevance is used for
extraction of representative opinion sentences.

A very important problem of the volume and
volatility of opinionated data published in social
media was presented by Tsirakis et al. (Tsirakis
et al., 2016). They discussed that most of methods
deal only with a small volume of data, where they
are quite effective, but usually do not scale up.

4 Future Directions

As presented in the previous sections, many chal-
lenges are still present in summarization. Stan-
dard text summarization usually applied to news
articles deals still with the problem of abstractive
summarization. Text summarization techniques
can be on a different level of abstraction and usu-
ally are not fully abstractive (See et al., 2017).

Another big challenge lies in summarization of
text in languages other than English. Most of
methods were evaluated only on English and inter-
esting could be an evaluation in other ones along
with their specifics. Another aspect could be sum-
marization over multiple languages where input
text does not need to be in only one language.

Summarization of user-generated content has to
deal with a problem of the noisy and ungram-
matical documents but also with very diverse and



5

conflicting opinions included within these docu-
ments (Murray et al., 2017). This problem is even
more protuberant in minor languages where opin-
ion mining and sentiment analysis is not well de-
veloped (Krchnavy and Simko, 2017).

In opinion summarization with thousands of in-
put entries a researcher should deal with a change
of opinions during the time. When summarizing
customer reviews for services like hotels or restau-
rants, change of quality should be considered. It
can lead to a specific time-based summary which
considers progress of opinions over the time. This
problem is also relevant in summarization of text
in social networks, especially with controversial
topics reports to the specific mood in society or
can be effected by community leaders. Lack of
available large datasets for this task is other cru-
cial subject of research in next years, since most
of research was evaluated only on small ones.

A significant problem is present in the evalu-
ation phase. Automatic evaluation can be quite
controversial as there exist not only one correct
summarization. Automatic evaluation measures
like ROUGE and its modifications (Lin, 2004) can
partially deal with these problems using n-grams,
but still do not handle a use of synonyms. Same
problems based on multiple formulation of ground
truth can cause problems with human evaluation
as well. Experiments evaluated with more human
participants have to deal with an agreement be-
tween users which can be quite low.

In next few years, we expect the opinion sum-
marization to deal with the domain specifics and
also with the user satisfaction. The growth of user-
generated content in the future can lead to focus on
reduction of information overload and also to text
summarization itself.

5 Research Proposal

As we described earlier, we would like to focus
on a specific type of summarization: creation of
opinion summaries. Nowadays, travel sites in-
clude thousands of reviews from users which vis-
ited one of reviewed places. These reviews are
very important in decision making of future pos-
sible customers but also for owners of services.
With tens of new reviews every day it is impossible
to read all the reviews and it is often very difficult
to choose only the relevant ones. For owners, it is
not possible to manually read all the reviews that
could be very helpful in service improvement.

Recent advances in neural networks and also
in the text summarization showed that employing
encoder-decoder architecture can be very useful.
The problem of summarization of customer re-
views differs from standard single document sum-
marization where the models were applied before.
In this task, we should consider multi-modular
framework.

The main idea of this proposal lies in getting
better user satisfaction with review summary and
also in examining of time aspect on opinion sum-
marization. Opinion summarization should pro-
cess in several phases:

1. aspect detection,

2. clustering opinionated features,

3. sentence generation.

The first step of our proposal lies in the detec-
tion of aspects. Before creation of any summary,
we need to identify aspects discussed in these re-
views. Another mechanism would be needed to
distinguish similarity of aspects. A taxonomy of
aspects could be a very useful tool to avoid a sepa-
ration of similar aspects but other approaches uti-
lizing a distributional and vector space should be
also examined. We plan to use a bidirectional
LSTM neural network with convolutional atten-
tion mechanism to identify aspects within text and
also to determine polarity of each aspect.

In the second step, we have to cluster opinion-
ated sentences by aspects they talk about. In each
cluster, a sentiment and polarity of opinions need
to be determined. Whereas in the task of senti-
ment analysis only overall or average sentiment is
typically provided, in the summarization all polar-
ity opinions should be included in the output sum-
mary. To reach this goal, all the opinionated sen-
tences and opinions should be identified.

In the final phase, we would like to employ neu-
ral network architecture to generate output sen-
tences from collected aspect-oriented information.
In this phase, we need to generate sentence to out-
put summary based on clustered aspects and also
use the polarity of aspects. We plan to use LSTM
network for this stage and generate sentence from
extracted aspects and their polarity.

There is also another important point of inter-
est in task of summarization that has not been dis-
cussed yet. The time horizon is often a neglected
feature which should be considered in opinion



6

summarization of customer reviews, as opinions
of customers can develop over the time in a posi-
tive, but also a negative way. We plan to include
information about created time to process of clus-
tering opinions along with other information about
the reviewer, what can lead to better accuracy of
summarization as well as resulting user satisfac-
tion with an output summary.

Another significant point to discuss is employ-
ing end-to-end deep learning in the task of opinion
summarization. The major problem is lack of large
dataset which is necessary for such learning. Cre-
ation of this kind of dataset is expensive and could
take hundreds of hours, if performed manually.

5.1 Dataset

To create an appropriate dataset, we plan to gather
customer reviews from large travel portals (e.g.,
TripAdvisor, Booking.com). All reviews come
along with other useful information such as score
ranking, which should be included too. However
any public information about reviewers could be
very useful too as it shows reviewer relevance and
also importance.

5.2 Experiments

To evaluate the quality of generated summaries a
few experiments are required. We will have to cre-
ate our ground truth or reference summaries to au-
tomatically evaluate quality of summary. As we
mentioned before, it is not a sufficient way for
evaluation and other experiments including human
evaluation would be needed. As this type of eval-
uation is very time consuming and difficult for
resources, a posteriori evaluation is more feasi-
ble way to assess the quality of generated sum-
maries. Very interesting view for opinion sum-
maries is comparison of the sentiment of gener-
ated summaries and the sentiment of original input
reviews. In human evaluation, we would like to
provide users a list of original reviews, generated
summary and ask about their satisfaction. We also
plan to use some other automatic measures like
ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and compare generated sum-
mary with summary created by humans. Another
important measure is aspect coverage and ratio of
included aspect in generated summaries from orig-
inal reviews.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we described the background for
summarization task. More importantly, we de-
scribed recent contributions and development in
this area with many problems the research deals
with. We emphasized the main problems and fu-
ture research directions in process of summariza-
tion and also particularly for opinion summariza-
tion. We also introduced our future research inten-
tions along with a design of the first experiments
and possible model and dataset. We demonstrated
that summarization task and especially opinion
summarization still have big open issues will be
researched in the next few years.
