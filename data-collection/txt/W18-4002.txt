Abstract

In this study, we develop content features for an automated scoring system of non-native En-
glish speakers’ spontaneous speech. The features calculate the lexical similarity between the
question text and the ASR word hypothesis of the spoken response, based on traditional word
vector models or word embeddings. The proposed features do not require any sample training
responses for each question, and this is a strong advantage since collecting question-specific data
is an expensive task, and sometimes even impossible due to concerns about question exposure.
We explore the impact of these new features on the automated scoring of two different question
types: (a) providing opinions on familiar topics and (b) answering a question about a stimulus
material. The proposed features showed statistically significant correlations with the oral profi-
ciency scores, and the combination of new features with the speech-driven features achieved a
small but significant further improvement for the latter question type. Further analyses suggested
that the new features were effective in assigning more accurate scores for responses with serious
content issues.

1 Introduction

This study aims to develop new features to score the content of non-native speakers’ spontaneous speech
as a part of an automated oral proficiency scoring system. The system provides holistic proficiency
scores using audio files and their transcriptions generated by an automated speech recognition (ASR)
system. Previously, studies in automated speech scoring have mainly focused on assessment of fluency
(Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Zechner et al., 2009), pronunciation (Witt and Young, 1997), and intonation
and rhythm (Lai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015). More recently, researchers started exploring assessment
of grammar (Chen and Zechner, 2011; Bhat and Yoon, 2015) and vocabulary(Yoon et al., 2012).

To date, limited studies have explored approaches to evaluating the content of spoken responses. Xie
et al. (2012) explored content features based on the lexical similarity between the response and a set
of sample responses for each question. A content-scoring component based on word vectors was also
part of the automated scoring engine described by Cheng et al. (2014). In both of these studies, content
features were developed to supplement other features measuring various aspects of speaking proficiency.
Neither study reported the relative contributions of content and speech features to the system perfor-
mance. Loukina et al. (2017) considered a content-scoring engine based on many sparse features such
as unigrams and bigrams and trained on a large corpus of existing responses. They showed that this
approach achieved performance comparable to that based on fluency and pronunciation, but there was
only little improvement from combining the two sets of features.

Approaches like those above require a sizable amount of response data for each question, and collect-
ing question-specific data is an expensive and difficult task. Furthermore, for high-stakes assessment this
can be impossible due to concerns about question exposure. A content feature that does not require any
test takers’ responses for new questions has a strong advantage when scoring a large scale operational
assessment.

To address this issue, Higgins et al. (2006) developed a system for scoring off-topic essays without the
need for question-specific responses; the system was based on similarity features between the question
text and the test response. The performance of this system was lower than the benchmark system trained
on question-specific responses, but it achieved a substantial improvement over a majority-based baseline.
Louis and Higgins (2010) further improved this system by expanding question texts to include synonyms,
inflected forms, and distributionally similar words to the question content. The performance of Louis and
Higgins (2010) showed a substantial improvement for questions consisting of only a small amount of
text. More recently, Evanini et al. (2013) developed a set of content features based on both the questions
and listening and reading materials for automated speech scoring and reported significant correlations
between these content features and the proficiency scores.

Various approaches based on deep-neural networks (DNN) and word-embeddings trained on large
corpora have showed promising performance in various NLP tasks, such as document similarity detection
(Kusner et al., 2015; Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016; Neculoiu et al., 2016). In contrast to traditional
similarity features, which are limited to a reliance on exact word matching, these new approaches have
the advantage of capturing topically relevant words that are not identical. Yoon et al. (2017) and Rei and
Cummins (2016) applied this approach to the task of off-topic detection in spoken responses and essays,
respectively, and achieved substantial improvements over systems that only use word-matching.

In this study, we combine the approach suggested by Evanini et al. (2013) and with more recent
advances in word embeddings and develop a new set of low-resource content features: these features
are trained using the prompt text expanded with word-embeddings without relying on any pre-existing
responses to a given question. We conducted the following research:

• Using the prompt texts included in each question, we developed two sets of content features: fea-
tures based on the traditional content vector analysis (CVA) approach and features based on word
embeddings.

• We trained automated scoring models using traditional speech-driven features and new content fea-
tures and compared the performance of the models.

• We investigated the impact of question types on the performance of the content features and the
automated scoring models. We provided an in-depth discussion about what aspects of the content
can be assessed by these new content features.

2 Data

We used a large collection of spoken responses from an assessment of English proficiency for academic
purposes1. The speaking section of the assessment was composed of 6 questions in which speakers were
prompted to provide responses lasting between 45 and 60 seconds per question, resulting in approxi-
mately 5.5 minutes of speech per speaker. All questions extracted spontaneous speech.

Among the 6 questions, two questions (hereafter, Independent questions) asked examinees to provide
information or opinions on familiar topics based on their personal experience or background knowledge.
These questions were short and typically consisted of just a few sentences. The questions were designed
to elicit responses based on personal experience or views on specific topics. Thus, the responses differed
widely in their content. For the four remaining questions (hereafter, Integrated questions), test takers
read and/or listened to stimulus materials and then answered a question relevant to the passage. We used
49 Independent questions and 98 Integrated questions in this study.

All responses were scored by trained raters using a 4-point scoring scale, where 1 indicates low speak-
ing proficiency and 4 indicates high speaking proficiency. The rubrics consist of three major perfor-
mance categories: delivery (pronunciation, intonation, rhythm, and fluency), language use (diversity,
sophistication, and precision of vocabulary, and range, complexity, and accuracy of grammar), and topic
development (progression of ideas, the degree of elaboration and completeness). We used the TOEFL
iBT Speaking Test Rubrics, which provide descriptions about the typical characteristics of candidate

performance for each score level. Approximately 10% of data set was double-scored, and an estimation
of the inter-rater agreement was obtained from this dobule-scored sub-set. Both Pearson correlation and
weighted kappa were 0.54 for Independent questions and 0.61 for Integrated questions.

We used 103, 868 and 49, 281 responses for training and evaluation of automated scoring models,
respectively. In addition, 154, 992 responses were used to obtain an inverse-document frequency (idf )
model for content features. The proposed features in this study did not use any question-specific sample
responses for content model training, and thus, the idf Train set did not contain any responses answering
the questions used in the scoring models. Finally, we used 73, 500 responses to train question-specific
content models as a benchmark. The size of the data sets is summarized in Table 1.

There were no overlaps among all datasets. There was a strong bias towards the middle scores (score
2 and 3); the most frequent score was 3 (50%) and followed by 2 (37%) with approximately 87% of the
responses belonging to these two score levels. The percentages of responses with score 4 and score 1
were 9% and 4%, respectively.

3 Features

3.1 Content features

We developed two sets of content features using the prompt texts. The prompt texts consisted of the
question sentences and optional listening and reading materials.

The first feature was a tf − idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) weighted cosine simi-
larity score between the prompt text and the response (hereafter, prompt-based CVA). First, we obtained
an idf model using the idf Train set which covered a wide range of questions except the 147 questions
used in Scoring Model Train and Evaluation set. For each word in the idf Train set, we calculated the
total number of responses divided by the number of responses containing it. Next, we built a question-
specific tf model for each question. We converted the prompt text into a single vector and counted the
number of the occurrences for each word.

The second set of features were features based on word-embeddings. Using the publicly available
word embedding vectors trained on the Google News corpus by Mikolov et al. (2013), we developed the
following two features used for the off-topic essay detection in Rei and Cummins (2016):

• averaged word embeddings: we created a vector for each question by mapping each word in the
question text to a corresponding word embedding vector and averaging them. Next, we created
a vector for a test response using the same process. Finally, we calculated the cosine similarity
between the question vector and the response vector.

• idf weighted word embeddings: we calculated an idf weighted word embedding feature by scaling
each word embedding vector by the corresponding idf weight and averaging the scaled vectors for
the prompt and the response, separately. We calculated the cosine similarity between these two
weighted vectors.



15

As a benchmark, we compare the proposed features, which are based only on the prompt materials,
to a feature trained on the test takers’ sample responses to the 147 questions (hereafter, response-based
CVA). First, we obtained the ASR-based transcriptions for responses in the Question-specific Content
Model Train set. All responses that answer the same question were converted into a single vector and
a question-specific tf was built from this vector using the same process as the prompt-based tf model.
Finally, we calculated a tf − idf weighted cosine similarity score between a test response vector and the
question-specific tf vector.

3.2 Speech-driven features
We used 35 features generated by an automated proficiency scoring system for non-native speakers’
spontaneous speech. For a given spoken response, the system performs speech processing, including
speech recognition, forced-alignment, pitch and power analysis, and generates a word hypotheses and
time stamps. Given the word hypotheses and descriptive features of pitch/power, it generates the follow-
ing five groups of features that capture information relevant to fluency and pronunciation. The numbers
in parentheses are the number of features that belong to each group.

• Speech rate features (3): These features compute the words spoken per minute with and without
trailing and leading pauses. Speech rate has been consistently identified as one of the major co-
variates of language proficiency and the features in this group have some of the highest correlations
with the overall human score.

• Segmental quality features (6): These features measure how much the pronunciation of individual
segments deviates from the pronunciation that would be expected from a proficient speaker. Features
are derived from the confidence scores of the ASR system or acoustic scores of the forced alignment
system. For instance, the normalized confidence score of the ASR system belongs to this group.

• Pause pattern features (9): These features capture pausing patterns in the response, such as mean
duration of pauses, mean number of words between two pauses, and the ratio of pauses to speech.

• Prosody features (11): These features measure patterns of variation in the time intervals between
stressed syllables as well as the number of syllables between adjacent stressed syllables (Zechner et
al., 2011).

• Timing features (6): These features capture variation in the duration of vowels and consonants.
This category includes features such as relative proportion of vocalic intervals or variability in ad-
jacent consonantal intervals (Lai et al., 2013) as well as features which compare vowel duration to
reference models trained on native speakers (Chen et al., 2009).

4 Experiment 1

4.1 Feature Generation
We first generated word hypotheses for each response in Table 1 using an ASR system. A gender in-
dependent acoustic model (AM) was trained on 800 hours of spoken responses extracted from the same
English proficiency test using the Kaldi toolkit (Povey et al., 2011). The AM training dataset consisted of
52,200 spoken responses from 8,700 speakers. It was based on a 5-layer DNN with p-norm nonlinearity
using layer-wise supervised backpropagation training. The language model (LM) was a trigram model
trained using the same dataset used for AM training. This ASR system achieved a Word Error Rate of
23% on 600 held-out responses. Detailed information about the ASR system is provided in (Tao et al.,
2016).

Next, we normalized both the prompt texts and the ASR-based transcriptions of the responses; all
words were tokenized, and stop words and disfluencies were removed from the texts. The length of the
original and the processed texts after removing stop words and disfluencies are summarized in Table 2.

The average lengths of the Independent prompts and the Integrated prompts were 41.0 and 341.6 words
respectively; thus the Integrated prompts were approximately 8 times longer than Independent prompts.

Table 2: Descriptive analysis of the number of words in prompt texts and responses

After removing stop words and fillers, the texts were approximately 2/3 of the original texts. The re-
sponses contained an average of 97 words for the Independent responses and 129 words for Integrated re-
sponses, but there were large variations across different responses. After the normalization process, the
length of the responses was 40% of the original responses on average. The responses were shortened
in larger proportion than the prompts because the responses contained disfluencies such as ‘uh’, ‘um’,
which were removed.

From these normalized transcriptions, we created four content features as described in Section 3. In
addition, 35 speech-driven features were generated using the original wave files and the same ASR word
hypotheses.

4.2 Results

First, we conducted correlation analyses between features and human scores using the Scoring Model
Train set. Table 3 presents Pearson correlation coefficients. For speech-driven features, the minimum
and maximum for each group are presented.

Table 3: Pearson Correlation Coefficients between features considered in this study and human scores
for Independent and Integrated questions.

The correlations of content features were largely influenced by the question types. In general, the
correlations for Integrated questions were substantially higher than those for Independent questions. The
best performing feature was idf weighted embedding, and the correlation coefficients were 0.240 and
0.455, respectively.

In contrast to the content features, the differences between Independent questions and Integrated ques-
tions among the speech-based features were relatively small. There were large variations in the corre-
lations among the features, and the lowest performing features in each group showed weak correlations
with human scores, while the best performing features showed correlations over 0.50 with the exception



17

of pause pattern group (0.494 for Independent questions). Among all features, the normalized acoustic
model score in the Segmental quality group showed the best correlation with human scores with coeff-
cients of 0.546 for Independent and 0.586 for Integrated.

We next considered whether adding content features to speech features improves performance of the
automated scoring model. We trained multiple linear regression (MLR) models using both speech-driven
and content features as the independent variables and the human score as the dependent variable. In
order to compare the performance of the new features with the speech-driven features and investigate the
impact of adding them to the existing model, we trained three models: speech (model based on 35 speech-
driven features), content (model based on 3 prompt-based content features), and combination (model
based on both speech-driven and content features, 38 features in total). In order to investigate the impact
of the question types on the performance of content features, we trained each model for Independent and
Integrated questions separately, yielding a total of 6 models. The models were trained on the Scoring
Model Train partition using RSMTool (Madnani et al., 2017). Table 4 shows the performance of all
models in terms of agreement between automated and human scores.

Table 4: Correlations, weighted kappas and root mean squared error (RMSE) between the automated

We observed the following points:

• The performance of content models was strongly influenced by question type; the model perfor-
mance for the Integrated questions was consistently better than that for the Independent questions.

• The speech models outperformed the content models for both question types.

• The combination of content features and speech-driven features (feature-level fusion) achieved a
further improvement for Integrated questions; both correlations and weighted kappas increased ap-
proximately 0.008 in absolute value. Based on the Steigers Z-test for dependent correlations, this
improvement was statistically significant at 0.01 level (p < 0.01).

4.3 Discussion

While adding content features lead to a statistically significant improvement in model performance for
Integrated questions, this improvement was small and the scores from the two models were highly cor-
related with r = 0.986. Content features also received very low coefficients in the linear regression.
However, the result is consistent with previous studies; Loukina and Cahill (2016) observed that con-
tent features such as unigrams or bigrams trained on question-specific sample responses achieved little
improvement when combined with speech-driven features. They further argued that the majority of
speakers who perform well along one dimension of language proficiency are also likely to perform well
along other dimensions (see also Xi (2007), who reports similar results for human analytic scores). Con-
sequently, the gain in performance from combining different systems is small or non-existent.

To explore this further, we conducted a further analysis using responses to Integrated questions and
explored what types of responses benefited from the addition of content features. First of all, we ob-
served that the content features were best at differentiating between low proficiency responses and the
other responses. Figure 1 shows that the automated scores generated by the speech model consistently
make distinctions across all score points as assigned by human raters. While for content models, the
distinctions were clear for score points 1 and 2, but not for score points 3 and 4. The average automated
scores for score point 3 and 4 were 2.73 and 2.88 respectively, and the difference was small.

RMSE between the human scores and automated scores generated by the ‘Combination’ model, and the
difference in RMSE between the two models.

We calculated RMSE between human scores and automated scores and averaged them for each human
score level (see Table 5). Adding content features to speech features improved the model performance
on low-proficiency responses: the decrease in RMSE was largest for score point 1 where it decreased
from 0.86 to 0.84. Since less than 5% of the responses received score 1, this improvement had very little
impact on overall model performance.

5 Experiment2

In Experiment 1, we found that new content features could reduce the automated score errors for the
lowest score point. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that the new features could identify
responses with substantial content issues and assign more accurate scores than the model based only on
the speech-driven features for these responses. In order to examine this hypothesis, we artificially created
a dataset with content issues by pairing responses with mismatched prompts for feature calculation.

5.1 Data

We first randomly selected 438 questions that did not overlap with the 147 questions used for the Scoring
Model Train and Evaluation sets. Each question in our assessment was designed to elicit content that was
substantially different from other questions, and therefore, mismatched responses have substantial con-
tent issues. For each question in the set of 147, we randomly selected 100 responses from the responses
to the 438 questions. A total of 14, 700 responses (4, 900 responses for Independent questions and 9, 800
responses for Integrated questions) were selected (hereafter, content-abnormality dataset). The average
of the original human scores was 2.73 for Independent questions and 2.66 for Integrated questions. We
did not re-score these responses as answers for the new question we randomly assigned. However, re-
sponses contained content inappropriate for the new questions, and the holistic proficiency scores were
expected to be lower than the original scores due to this content issue.



19

5.2 Method

For each response in the content-abnormality dataset, we generated both speech-driven features and con-
tent features. For the content features, we did not use the original prompt text that elicited the response,
but instead we used the new prompt text that was one of the 147 questions randomly selected as de-
scribed in Section 5.1. Next, we generated three automated scores using the automated models described
in Section 4.

5.3 Results

Table 6 presents the average of the automated scores of the content abnormality dataset.

Independent Integrated
Speech 2.70 2.63
Content 2.38 1.70
Combination 2.67 2.37

Table 6: Comparison of the automated scores for responses with content abnormality

The average scores of the speech models were 2.70 for Independent questions and 2.63 for Inte-
grated questions, and they were similar to the average of the original human scores. In contrast, the
average scores of the content models were lower than those of the speech models, and this trend was par-
ticularly salient for the Integrated questions. Finally, the models based on both features assigned lower
scores than speech models on average, but the differences were relatively small; it was 0.03 for Inde-
pendent questions and 0.26 for Integrated questions. This may be due to the low coefficients assigned
to the content features in the linear regression models; the coefficients for Independent questions were
lower than Integrated questions, and the difference of Independent questions was even smaller than that
of Integrated questions.

Next, we further analyzed the automated scores for Integrated questions. Figure 2 shows the relation-
ships between the automated scores and the original human scores.

Figure 2: Average predicted scores of the models based on speech features (blue), content features
(orange), and both feature sets (gray) conditioned by human scores.

In general, the automated scores of the content model were consistently lower than those of the other
two models across all human score points. As the original human scores increased, the content scores
also slightly increased, but the average scores for all score points were lower than 2.0. In contrast, as the
original human scores increased, the scores of the speech model increased substantially, and the average
scores except score point 1 were higher than 2.0. The high scores of the speech model was expected
since it did not include any features to capture the content abnormality, and the automated scores may be
inflated when the responses demonstrated good delivery skills (e.g., pronunciation and fluency) in spite of



20

the content abnormality. In contrast, the content model consistently assigned lower scores for responses
with the content abnormality. This result supports that the new content features are sensitive to the severe
content issues and predict a more accurate score, which penalizes the content issues appropriately.

5.4 Discussion

Experiment 1 showed that the new content features improved the scoring accuracy for the responses
with the lowest proficiency score. Furthermore, experiment 2 showed that these features could prevent
the inflation of automated scores for responses with the critical content abnormality that caused a severe
mismatch between delivery and content. However, we did not uncover evidence that new content features
can improve score accuracy for responses with subtle and complicated content issues. These results
are expected considering the nature of the proposed content features. The features were based on word
unigrams and therefore may be able to make distinctions between responses with or without key concepts.
However, they would not be able to differentiate whether the combination of these individual words
conveys an appropriate meaning or not, which may be a key point for differentiating proficiency levels
between the intermediate and advanced learners. Further qualitative review of a small set of responses
was consistent with this conclusion: the scores of the content model were more accurate than those of the
speech model when scoring responses with good coverage of the key words but low fluency. However,
both models assigned high scores to responses that could be described as a continuous stream of mostly
intelligible and relevant words but incoherent in terms of the content.

The holistic proficiency scores were not only based on the content, but raters also took into account
other aspects of speaking proficiency, such as pronunciation, fluency, grammar, and vocabulary. How-
ever, if a test taker has comparable skills across all performance categories, then the score based on only
one performance category may be comparable to the holistic proficiency score. For instance, if a re-
sponse shows comparable skills for both the delivery and content, then the delivery-based score may be
similar to the holistic proficiency score. If the majority of responses belong to this type, automated scores
only measuring limited performance categories may show strong correlations with the experts’ holistic
proficiency scores. In this study, correlations between the automated scores based solely on speech fea-
tures and the scores based on the combination of the content and speech features were very high, and two
scores were seemingly identical. However, when scoring responses with severe content abnormality, the
two scoring models showed different behaviors, and the scores based on both content and speech features
correctly reflected the content abnormality. This result illustrates the importance of the coverage of the
performance categories that automated scoring models assess; when scoring responses with mismatched
proficiency levels in different performance categories, automated scoring systems assessing with limited
coverage may show sub-optimal performance.

6 Conclusions

In this study, we proposed content features for an automated scoring system of non-native speakers’
spontaneous speech. The content features calculated the similarity between the prompt texts and the ASR
hypothesis of test responses, and therefore do not require any sample responses for each item during the
training. The inclusion of new features achieved a small but statistically significant improvement for
Integrated questions over the existing model based on speech-driven features solely assessing delivery
skill. A further experiment using responses with artificially induced content abnormality showed that the
inclusion of the new features may increase the validity of the automated scores by preventing the system
from generating inflated scores for responses with good delivery skills but severe content issues.
