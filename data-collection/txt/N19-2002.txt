Abstract

In this paper, we introduce an approach for
leveraging available data across multiple lo-
cales sharing the same language to 1) improve
domain classification model accuracy in Spo-
ken Language Understanding and user expe-
rience even if new locales do not have suf-
ficient data and 2) reduce the cost of scaling
the domain classifier to a large number of lo-
cales. We propose a locale-agnostic universal
domain classification model based on selec-
tive multi-task learning that learns a joint rep-
resentation of an utterance over locales with
different sets of domains and allows locales
to share knowledge selectively depending on
the domains. The experimental results demon-
strate the effectiveness of our approach on do-
main classification task in the scenario of mul-
tiple locales with imbalanced data and dis-
parate domain sets. The proposed approach
outperforms other baselines models especially
when classifying locale-specific domains and
also low-resourced domains.

1 Introduction
Recent success of intelligent personal digital assis-
tants (IPDA) such as Amazon Alexa, Google As-
sistant, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana (Sarikaya,
2017; Sarikaya et al., 2016) in USA has led to
their expansion to multiple locales and languages.
Some of those virtual assistant systems have been
released in the United States (US), the United
Kingdom (GB), Canada (CA), India (IN), and so
on. Such expansion typically leads to building a
separate domain classification model for each new
locale, and it brings two challenging issues: 1)
having a separate model per locale becomes a bot-
tleneck for rapid scaling of virtual assistant due to
the resource and maintenance costs that grow lin-
early with the number of locales, and 2) new lo-
cales typically comes without much training data
and cannot take full advantage of useful data avail-

able in other mature locales to achieve the high
model accuracy.

In this study, we propose a new approach that
reduces the cost of scaling natural language un-
derstanding to a large number of locales, given the
sufficient amount of data in one of the locales of
that language, while achieving high domain clas-
sification accuracy over all locales. The approach
is based on a multi-task learning framework that
aims to share available data to learn a joint rep-
resentation, and we introduce a way to selectively
share knowledge across locales while considering
locale-specificity in the joint learning. Multi-task
learning has been widely used to tackle the prob-
lem of low-resource tasks or leveraging data be-
tween correlated targets (Liu et al., 2017; Ruder
and Plank, 2018; Augenstein et al., 2018; Peters
et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017b), but none of them
consider locale-specificity when sharing knowl-
edge to learn a joint representation.

We evaluate our proposed approach on the real-
world utterance data spoken by customers to an
intelligent personal digital assistant across dif-
ferent locales. The experimental results empir-
ically demonstrate that the proposed universal
model scales to multiple locales, while achieving
higher domain classification accuracy compared
to competing locale-unified models as well as
per-locale separate models. The proposed model
named universal model is able to successfully pre-
dict domains for locale-specific utterances while
sharing common knowledge across locales with-
out sacrificing the accuracy of predicting locale-
independent domains.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we discuss several design considerations that mo-
tivate our model design. In Section 3, we define
the problem of domain classification with multi-
ple locales that have different domain sets, and
then introduce a novel universal domain classifi-



10

cation model with several technical details. We
present our experimental observations over differ-
ent approaches on the Amazon Alexa dataset in
Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Sec-
tion 5.

2 Motivations
2.1 Locale/Domain-Maturity

Let the term maturity be defined by how long it
has been since a service or model was deployed
in a locale and/or how much data have been col-
lected. Every locale has different degrees of ma-
turity. That is, while some locales have spent time
long enough to collect sufficient data to train mod-
els, others may suffer from the lack of data (see
more details of data statistics in Section 4). In ad-
dition to that, domains that are commonly avail-
able in multiple locales have different levels of
maturity for each locale. Those two dimensions
of maturity are not always aligned with each other.
In other words, there could exist domains that have
more data in immature locales than in mature lo-
cales, depending on targeted users, regional prop-
erties of domains, and so forth.

2.2 Locale-Specificity

When an SLU service is deployed in multiple lo-
cales, each of the locales has its own domain set
and there can exist overlapping domains between
locales. Such domains may share the same schema
including intents and slots and thus they should be
able to handle the same patterns of utterances re-
gardless of locales. It allows locales to share the
knowledge of common domains with each other,
which eventually helps immature locales to over-
come the lack of data. A special case that needs
to be carefully considered is that a domain could
be locale-specific. Even though a domain is com-
mon across different locales, it may be defined
with different intents/slots. For example, the do-
main OpenTable, which is capable of restaurant
reservation, is available in both US and GB, but
the slot values including restaurant names are to-
tally different between the two locales. That is,
the utterance “Make a reservation for The Fox
Club London” can be handled by OpenTable
in GB locale, but probably not in US locale, be-
cause the restaurant The Fox Club London is lo-
cated in London. If we have different locales share
the same utterance patterns between them even for
such locale-specific domains, then it will cause
confusion on the models. We thus identify locale-

specific domains in advance of model training and
do not allow input utterances of such domain to be
shared by different locales. We need to handle do-
mains in a similar way that are available only in a
particular locale.

3 Universal Model
In this section, we describe our proposed model
illustrated in Figure 1 in detail. Suppose that
given k locales, {li|i = 1, 2, . . . , k}, each locale
li is associated with its own domain set Di =
{dij |j = 1, 2, . . . , |Di|}. There could exist over-
lapping domains between locales and some of the
overlapping domains may share exactly the same
intents/slots while others may have different in-
tents/slots across locales. The main task is that
given an input utterance from locale li the model
should be able to correctly classify the utterance
into a domain dij ∈ Di that can best handle the
utterance. Here we assume that all locales use the
same language, English, but have different domain
sets. Our deep neural model, as a proposed solu-
tion to the task, is comprised of two layers. The
first layer includes a BiLSTM shared encoder and
k BiLSTM locale-specific encoders. The second
layer consists of a set of k locale-specific predic-
tion layers.

3.1 Shared and Locale-specific Encoders

Given an input utterance that forms a word se-
quence, an encoder makes a vector representation
of the entire utterance by using word embeddings
for English language in general. We use Bidirec-
tional LSTM (BiLSTM) to encode an input ut-
terance and consider it to be a mapping function
F that consumes a sequence of word embeddings
and then produces an embedding vector given by
concatenating the outputs of the ends of the word
sequences from the forward LSTM and the back-
ward LSTM. While different locales share com-
mon domains and utterances, each of them also
should be able to learn certain patterns observed
from domains available only in the locale. In other
words, there exist both global and local patterns in
the entire domain set. In order to effectively cap-
ture both patterns and avoid confusion between lo-
cales, we use a shared encoder Fs and multiple
locale-specific encoders Fli for ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , k,
each of which corresponds to a particular locale li,
as similarly adopted in (Kim et al., 2017a, 2016c).
While the shared encoder Fs learns global pat-
terns of utterances commonly observable across

different locales, each of the locale-specific en-
coders Fli , which corresponds to one of the lo-
cales li, learns local patterns of utterances that are
observed specifically in the locale li.

3.2 Adversarial Locale Prediction Loss

Intuitively, the shared encoderFs is expected to be
able to better capture common utterance patterns
over all locales rather than to learn patterns that are
seen in only some particular locales. Thus, Fs can
be further tuned to be locale-invariant by adding a
locale prediction layer with negative gradient flow,
as similarly proposed in (Kim et al., 2017c; Ganin
et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). Let xs denote an
encoded vector for an input utterance produced by
the shared encoderFs. xs is then fed into a single-
layer neural network to make a prediction for its
corresponding locale li. Formally,

zadv = softmax(Wadv · xs + badv) (1)

where Wadv and badv are a weight matrix and
a bias term for the locale prediction layer of the
feed-forward network. Since we aim to make the
shared encoder Fs to be locale-invariant, the ad-
versarial locale prediction loss is given by the pos-

itive log-likelihood:

Ladv =
k∑
i=1

ti log[zadv]
i (2)

where ti is a binary indicator if locale li is the cor-
rect prediction or not.

3.3 Supervised Locale Attention

In order to allow the locale-specific encoders to
share knowledge about common domains across
locales, we give a chance to learn an input utter-
ance to any locale-specific encoders Fli as long as
its associated domain is in Di, except the case of
locale-specific domains (i.e., OpenTable). Sup-
pose Sdij = {lw|dij ∈ Dw, ∀w = 1, 2, · · · , k}
if dij is not locale-specific, otherwise Sdij =
{li}. That is, depending on which locales a given
domain is available in and whether or not it is
locale-specific, its utterance needs to be selec-
tively routed to locale-specific encoders Fli where
li ∈ Sdij . However, we do not know a ground-
truth domain associated with an input utterance
during inference and it means that there is no way
to do such selective routing unfortunately. Instead,
we can use supervised attention mechanism to ap-
proximate the locales in which a domain is avail-
able. During training, we have each of the locale-
specific encoder outputs attend each other and pro-



12

vide them with information about which locales
should be highly attended, as explained in the fol-
lowing.

Let H = [hl1 ,hl2 , . . . ,hlk ] ∈ Rdh×k denote
a matrix of encoded vectors generated by Fli for
∀i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then, the attention weights are
obtained as follows,

a = logistic(w · tanh(V ·H)) (3)

where w ∈ Rda and V ∈ Rda×dh are learn-
able weight parameters, and da is a hyperparam-
eter we can set arbitraily. The resulted vector a
contains attention weights in the range between
0 and 1 over the encoded vectors hl1 , . . . ,hlk .
Then a locale-aware encoded vector xl can be
achieved by taking a weighted linear combination
of hl1 , . . . ,hlk :

xl = a ·H> (4)

The final vector representation y ∈ R2·dh for
the input utterance is the concatenation of two en-
coded vectors xs and xl that are produced fromFs
and Fl, respectively. Note we have to make sure
that the proper encoders that correspond to Sdij al-
ways get high attention weights. Thus, instead of
just letting V and w be optimized during training
the model, we can optimize them in a supervised
way. That is, in training time, the model is aware
of locales where a ground-truth domain is avail-
able. In other words, we can reward or penalize
the attention weights depending on whether or not
their corresponding locales have the domain of an
input utterance. Therefore, the loss function for
the attention weights is defined as,

Lloc = −
( ∑
l∈Sdij

log(al) +
∑

l′ /∈Sdij

log(1− al′)
)
(5)

3.4 Domain Classification

Once we obtain an encoded vector y that repre-
sents an input utterance, we feed it into predic-
tion layers, consisting of feed forward networks,
to make predictions. Since the availability of do-
mains depends on locales, the prediction layers
use the locale information associated with the ut-
terance to route the encoded vector to only a sub-
set of prediction layers in which the domain of the
utterance is available. Then, the output vector pro-

duced by the prediction layer specifically for the
locale li is

zi = W
2
i · σ(W1i · y + b1i ) + b2i (6)

where Wi and bi are the weight and bias param-
eters used by the li specific prediction layer, and
σ is an activation function for non-linearity. Since
our model is structured with a multi-task learning
framework to learn a joint representation across
locales, we calculate zi for all li ∈ Sdij and then
the predictions are made independently. Then the
prediction loss is

Lpos = − log p(dij |zi) (7)

Lneg = −
∑
d̂ij∈Di
d̂ij 6=dij

log p(d̂ij |zi) (8)

Lpred =
1

|Sdij |
∑

li∈Sdij

(Lpos + Lneg) (9)

Note that the prediction loss must be normalized
by the number of locales in Sdij because the size
of the set changes depending on how many locales
has the domain associated with an input utterance
and thus the number of the final prediction layer
Then, the final objective function looks as follows,

argmin
θFs ,θFl ,V,w,W,b

Ladv + Lloc + Lpred (10)

where θFs and θFl are the LSTM weight parame-
ters in the shared encoder and the locale-specific
encoders, respectively.

4 Experiments

4.1 Dataset

We use a subset of the Amazon Alexa dataset that
consists of utterances spoken to Alexa by real cus-
tomers over four different English locales includ-
ing US (United States), GB (United Kingdom),
CA (Canda), IN (India). Each of the utterances is
labeled with a ground-truth domain. The main ob-
jective of this experiment should be to show the ef-
fectiveness of various approaches on domain clas-
sification task under the situation where there ex-
ist multiple locales that have imbalanced data and
disparate domain sets. Thus, we consider the fol-
lowing two aspects: 1) how differently various do-
main classification approaches behave depending

the challenging issues discussed in Section 1. To
this end, we categorize all domains in the dataset
into four different groups.

• Locale-specific A set of domains which are
defined with different intents/slots across lo-
cales.

• Locale-independent A set of domains which
have exactly the same intent/slot lists across
locales.

• Single-locale A set of domains which are
available in only a single locale.

• Small A set of domains that lack data in a lo-
cale but have sufficient data in other locales.

Table 1 shows its brief statistics per locale, Ta-
ble 2 presents the number of domains for each
of four different domain categories, and Table 3
shows how many domains are overlapping be-
tween locales.

4.2 Competing Models

We compare the performances of the following
five models.

• single A standard BiLSTM based encoder
trained with only data in a particular locale.

• union An extension of ‘single’ trained with
US data additionally.

• constrained A BiLSTM encoder trained with
all locales data. It uses the locale information

associated with the utterance to route the en-
coded utterance to only a subset of domains
available in the constrained output space for
the locale to make prediction (Kim et al.,
2016b,a).

• universal This is our main contribution
model described throughout the paper.

• universal + adv An extension of ‘universal’
incorporating the adversarial locale predic-
tion loss as discussed in Section 3.2.

4.3 Domain Classification

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model ar-
chitecture especially on domains with insufficient
data and/or locale-dependency, we report the clas-
sification performances of all competing models
on several subsets of the dataset (four different
groups presented in Section 4.1) as well as the
entire data. We use classification accuracy as
our main evaluation metric. The experimental re-
sults in Table 4 clearly show two major points:
1) our proposed universal model outperforms all
other baselines over all locales and all domain
sets, and 2) the baseline models achieve very
poor accuracy especially when leveraging avail-
able data in other locales is of critical importance
or when there needs to selectively share knowl-
edge depending on the locale-specificity of a do-
main. If a model that shares knowledge across
locales does not handle locale-specific domains
carefully, its performance would deteriorate due
to confusion on locale-specific patterns. The ‘con-
strained’ model uses a shared encoder and allows
locales to shares its prediction layer, but it does not
determine whether or not to share knowledge for
each domain. As a result, its classification accu-
racy is only 44% for locale-specific domains and
25% for single-locale domains in the IN dataset
with lack of data. Also, ‘single’ and ‘union’
models do not have any chance to learn a joint
representation while sharing knowledge and thus
they totally fail to make predictions correctly for
locale-specific, single-locale, and small domains.
In contrast, our universal model is very robust to
domains with insufficient data and domains with
locale-specific patterns over all locales. It proves
that our approach is very effective for capturing
both global and local patterns by selectively shar-
ing domain knowledge across locales. Also, the
adversarial locale prediction is only helpful for

locale-specific and single-locale domains. That
is probably because the effect of adversarial loss
paradoxically makes the model rely on only the
locale-specific encoders which are well-optimized
for locale-specific/single-locale domains. There
needs deep analysis about why it does not affect
the GB locale, and we leave it as future works.

4.4 Implementation Details

All the models were optimized using a minibatch
size of 64 and trained for 20 epochs by the Adam
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with initial pa-
rameter values η = 1 × 10−3, β1 = 0.9, β2 =
0.999. We picked the weight parameter values
that achieved the best classification accuracy on
the validation set to report the test set accuracy
presented in Table 4. We used pre-trained word
embeddings with 100 dimensionality, generated
by GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014). The dimen-
sionality of each hidden output of LSTMs is 100
for both the shared encoder Fs and the locale-
specific encoder Fli , and the hidden outputs of
both forward LSTM and backward LSTM are con-
catenated, thereby the output of each BLSTM for
each time step is 200. The inputs and the outputs
of the BLSTMs are regularized with dropout rate
0.5 (Pham et al., 2014).

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning
based locale-agnostic universal model for domain
classification task that dynamically chooses sub-
sets of locale-specific components depending on

input data. It leverages available data across lo-
cales sharing the same language to reduce the cost
of scaling the domain classification model to a
larger number of locales and maximize model per-
formance even for new locales without sufficient
data. The experimental results show that the uni-
versal model effectively exploits both global and
local patterns and allows locales selectively share
knowledge with each other. Especially, its clas-
sification performance is notable on immature lo-
cales/domains with insufficient data and locale-
specific domains.

For future work, we consider adopting the pro-
posed model architecture to multi-lingual scenario
as well. The proposed model architecture is
limited to supporting multiple locales using the
same language only (e.g.., English in our exper-
iments). However, voice-driven virtual assistant
systems are becoming more and more popular
around the world while expanding to non-English
locales such as France, Italy, Spain and so on, and
there could be a lot of domains built with multiple
supported languages. It will definitely make the
rapid scaling of a domain classification model to a
large number of locales much more challenging in
the future. We plan to address several issues, in-
cluding but not limited to: 1) how can we capture
and share knowledge of common patterns of utter-
ances belonging to the same domain but written
in different languages across different locales? 2)
how can we prevent a locale from interfering with
other locales using different language for learning
linguistic context of utterances?
