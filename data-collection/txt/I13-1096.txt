Abstract

Chinese time entity is quite complex. In
this paper, we give a comprehensive lin-
guistic study on it. Based on the analy-
sis, we present a rule system which on-
ly considers the inner structure of Chinese
time entities for the recognition. Exper-
iments on Sinica and TempEval-2 corpus
show that the rule system performs much
better than the CRFs model. When using
the rules as features within a CRFs mod-
el, the performance could be further im-
proved.

1 Introduction

In SemEval-2010 competition, there is a sub task
for temporal entity identification, which includes
a Chinese corpus. The final goal of the task is to
associate a temporal expression to a certain even-
t. It is very important to extract all the elements
for events in that it will be useful for event track-
ing. By identifying the time information of events
will enable us to make inference on the temporal
relation of different events.

In this paper, we will make a comprehensive s-
tudy on Chinese time entities from a linguistic per-
spective and then present a rule system for recog-
nizing them. Chinese temporal entity is very com-
plex due to the flexible grammar of Chinese and
the existence of many different time systems, such
as Gregorian system, the Chinese lunar system, the
Chinese tian-gan & di-zhi (GZ) time system.

Based on our linguistic analysis, we formal-
ize a set of temporal elements that are the
blocks used to construct time entities, such as
century, year,month, day, hour etc. We then
build a rule system that actually describe the topol-
ogy of the temporal elements. For example, year
follows century; month follows year. So, the
model of our system is a directed graph, while a

valid temporal expression is a path from one cer-
tain node to another node. The longer the path is,
the more confident the recognition will be.

CTEMP (Wu et al., 2005) also used linguis-
tic rules for Chinese temporal entity recognition.
However, the focus of this work differs from them
in that we aims to identify Chinese time entities
which could be described with a limited set of
rules and can be easily translated into a structured
format, such as TIMEX3(Pustejovsky et al., 2010)
standard. For this part, the set of rules in this work
are more comprehensive than (Wu et al., 2005).
However, we don’t include events that are used
as time entities, since events intrinsically are not
time entities. According to the Generative Lexi-
con Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995), this is a case of
type coercion.

In Section 2, we will give a linguistic study
on Chinese time entity expressions. In Section 3,
we will construct a rule system which is mainly
based on our linguistic study. In Section 4, we
test rule system on Sinica and TempEval-2 corpo-
ra and give a discussion on the experimental result.
Section 5 is the conclusion.

2 Chinese time entity: A linguistic study

We refer to Y.R. Chao’s book (Chao, 1968) as a
starting point of our study. In China, there are
different time systems, including the lunar sys-
tem, TianGan-DiZhi (GZ) system, etc. In ancient
China, people used the emperor’s reign to count
time. When a new emperor appeared, a new peri-
od would then started.

In another perspective, people try to divide the
time axis by different levels of granularity. Rough-
ly, the whole axis can be divided into three peri-
ods: guo-qu (past), xian-zai (present) and jiang-
lai (future). Smaller granularity includes century
(shi-ji), year (nian), season (ji-jie), month (yue),
day (ri), hour (shi), minute (fen), second (miao).
Week (zhou) is a granularity that is independen-

795



t to year, season and month. In China, there are
also jie-qi (JQ) that divides one year into 24 d-
ifferent periods. One month can also be divided
into 3 periods (XUN): the first ten days (shang-
xun), the second ten days (zhong-xun) and the
left days (xia-xun). One day can also be divid-
ed into different vague phases (DP), e.g. be-
fore dawn (ling-chen), early morning (zao-shang),
morning (shang-wu), noon (zhong-wu), afternoon
(xia-wu), evening and night (wan-shang), mid-
night (wu-ye).

To compile rules for the automatic recognition
of Chinese time entities, one important issue is to
find out the construction regularity for each tem-
poral element and the relations among the ele-
ments, which is also the inner structure of Chinese
time entities.

2.1 Gregorian system and Chinese lunar
system

Gregorian system starts from the year of Christ’s
birth. Before this year, B.C. (gong-yuan-qian) is
used with a number to denote time on the time
axis. After this year, A.D. (gong-yuan) is used,
which is also the default value. Chinese support-
s this sytem. For example, 2013-08-08 09:01:01
is said in Chinese (gong yuan) er-ling-yi-san-nian
ba-yue ba-ri jiu-dian ling-yi-fen ling-yi-miao.

One hour can also be divided into four quarter-
s (ke). However, only yi-ke (fifteen) and san-ke
(forty five) are valid expressions. For the half of
an hour, ban (half) is used. zheng (right) will be
used as the right start of an hour. So, zheng, yi-
ke, ban, san-ke are the four possible values for the
KE element.

One year can be divided into four quarters (ji-
du:JD) or (ji-jie:season). An ordinal number will
be used to refer to a certain JD, such as di-yi ji-
du (the first quarter). The ordinal marker di could
be omitted. So, yi ji-du is also a valid expression.
Each season has its own name: spring (chun-ji),
summer (xia-ji), autumn (qiu-ji) and winter (dong-
ji).

For hours, day phases (DP) could be added be-
fore them. The DP is usually placed before hour,
such as ling-chen san-dian (3:00am), wu-ye shi-
er-dian (0:00). However, the boundaries of differ-
ent phases are not clear, such as xia-wu/wan-shang
liu-dian (6:00 in the afternoon/evening) .

Century (shi-ji) can be followed by decade
(nian-dai), such as er-shi-shi-ji jiu-shi-nian-dai

(the 90s of 20th century). The first decade is usu-
ally called ling-ling-nian-dai (00s) or tou-shi-nian
(first ten years).

If gong-yuan (A.D.) or gong-yuan-qian (B.C)
is used before century or year, then the numbers
will be written as the pronunciation of the num-
ber rather than a sequence of digits. For example,
gong-yuan liang-qian-ling-yi-shi-san nian is simi-
lar to be said as two thousand and thirteenth years
A.D. in English. Otherwise, year 2013 will be
written as er-ling-yi-san-nian (two-zero-one-three
year).

Chinese lunar time system uses a similar way
to denote time as the Gregorian system. Howev-
er, it refers to the movement of the moon to count
months. So the start of one year in lunar system
is different from the Gregorian system. We can
use a flag ‘&’ (nong-li) to denote the lunar system,
such as & 2013-08-08. In addition, the lunar sys-
tem uses chu before the day number for the first
ten days of a month in order to make up of two
syllables, while the day marker ri is usually omit-
ted. For example, Aug. 8th is said ba-yue chu-ba,
Aug. 11th is said ba-yue shi-yi. The lunar label
nong-li can also be placed before the subsequence
of year-month-day, such as nong-li wu-yue chu-
wu (& 05-05), nong-li chu-wu (& 05)’ etc.

2.2 TianGan-DiZhi system

This system was invented in Ancient China based
on a the Chinese traditional philosophical theory.
There are ten heavenly stems (tian gan: TG): jia,
yi, bing, ding, wu, ji, geng, xin, ren, gui and twelve
mundane branches (di zhi: DZ): zi, chou, yin, mao,
chen, si, wu, wei, shen, you, xu, hai. Then, one
year is denoted by a combination of two differ-
ent elements circularly, which generates sixty d-
ifferent denotations. If we use a sequence num-
ber to denote the two elements, i.e. TG0−9 and
DZ0−11, then the ith year of a circulation is de-
fined as yi = TGi%10DZi%12, where 0 ≤ i < 60
and % is the mod operation. For example, gui-
si-nian (2013) can be formally denoted as year
TG9DZ5, or simply GZ9,5. Similarly, month, day
and the Chinese hour can also be denoted like this.

The twelve DZ items are also associated with
twelve animals (sheng xiao: SX): shu (mouse), ni-
u (cattle), hu (tiger), tu (rabbit), long (dragon), she
(snake), ma (house), yang (sheep), hou (monkey),
ji (chick), gou (dog), zhu (pig). So, one year can
also be simplified as [animal] nian. For example,

796



year 2013 can be also called as she-nian (year of s-
nake), or formally denoted as SX5. However, this
kind of expression can only be said alone. It can
rarely be said with month and day, such as *she-
nian wu-yue (the 5th month of year of snake).

2.3 Jie-Qi
As we have mentioned, there are also twenty
four Jie-Qi (JQ) within one year: li-chun, yu-
shui, jing-zhe, chun-fen, qing-ming, gu-yu, li-xia,
xiao-man, mang-zhong, xia-zhi, xiao-shu, da-shu,
li-qiu, chu-shu, bai-lu, qiu-fen, han-lu, shuang-
jiang, li-dong, xiao-xue, da-xue, dong-zhi, xiao-
han, da-han. Every six JQs corresponds to and di-
vide one season. The JQs are actually time words
and included in Chinese dictionaries. JQ usually
follows year element, such as er-ling-yi-san-nian
qiu-fen (qiu-fen of 2013).

2.4 Regnal year system
Ancient Chinese people have seen a new emper-
or as a starting point of a new period. A num-
ber is used to count the following years after that
year. The first year is called yuan-nian, the second
year is called er-nian (2nd year), etc. For exam-
ple, QianLong yuan-nian stands for the year when
QianLong became the emperor. However, there
are hundreds of emperors in the history of China,
and many of them are not recorded at all. So, the
list of emperors is hard to be complete. Usually,
the most used regnal years refer to the Qing Dy-
nasty.

2.5 Weekdays
Weekdays (xing-qi) are expressed by xing-qi plus
a number from one to six. Sunday doesn’t use sev-
en, but ri/tian (day). Formally, they can be written
as XQ0−6. xing-qi is also called zhou (week) or li-
bai (go to church) that is borrowed from religious
activities. However, when we use zhou, Sunday
cannot be said as *zhou-tian. Week days are usu-
ally placed after day and before hour as a paren-
thesis, such as 2013-10-15 (Tuesday) 3:00pm.

2.6 Festivals and Events
Some days or day sequences are named as festi-
vals. Festivals are usually based on Gregorian sys-
tem, such as the national day (guo-qing). In China,
there are some festivals that are based on lunar sys-
tem, such as the autumn day (zhong-qiu), which is
& 08-16. Some JQs are also regarded as festivals,
especially when there are vacations for them, such

as qing-ming festival. Festivals are usually used
independently to other temporal elements. Mean-
while, most of the festivals have been lexicalized
and included in dictionaries.

Some festivals’ dates are dynamic. For ex-
ample, Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday of
November in the United States. For such festival-
s, we need to construct a function to automatical-
ly select a certain day in the year of context, e.g.
select(Thursday, 4, November, $Y ear). From
this point of view, we need to build ontology for
translating festivals into the TIMEX3 standard.

An event can denote a time, such as hun-qian
(before marriage), shi fa dang tian (the day when
it happened) etc. Sometimes, a time operator can
explicitly change the event into a time entity, such
as qian (before), hou (after) etc. However, such ex-
pressions are hardly to be complete, and we don’t
deal with events in this system.

2.7 Referential time

The demonstrative, such as zhe (this) and na (that),
can be placed before some temporal elements
to form a referential time (ref). For example,
zhe-yi-nian (this one year), ben-shi-ji (this cen-
tury). The general pattern of such construction
is [zhe/na]+[number]+[classifier]. There are al-
so some lexicalized referential time expressions,
such as jin-nian (this year), ming-tian (tomorrow)
etc.

2.8 Durations

Duration is an interval of two time spots, i.e. the
starting time and the ending time, connected by
dao/zhi (to). cong (from) can also be placed in
front. For example, (cong) shi-yue shi-wu-ri dao
shi-yue shi-qi-ri (Oct. 15th - Oct. 17th). When
there is only one temporal element in the starting
and ending time, which means that their parent el-
ements are the same, the first time marker can be
omitted. For example, shi-yue shi-wu(-ri) dao shi-
qi-ri (Oct. 15-17). Sometimes, only the length
information is expressed, such as liang-nian (two
years), which is made up of a Chinese number plus
a classifier.

2.9 Period phases

When talking about a specific time period, we can
refer to its different phases, e.g. its starting period
(chu-qi), middle period(zhong-qi) and final period
(mo-qi/hou-qi). Period is different from duration

797



in that duration emphasizes the length, while peri-
od not. So, ’*liang-nian chu-qi’ (the start of two
years) is an invalid expression.

3 A rule system for Chinese time entity
recognition

So far, we have discussed 24 temporal ele-
ments: century, decade, year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, season, XUN , JQ,
JD, DP , SX , lunar, GZyear, SXyear,
GZmonth, GZday, GZhour, regnalyear,
weekday, festival, periodphase. Since festi-
vals are lexical time expressions and it is hard
to provide a complete list of festivals, we don’t
recognize festivals in this version. However, it
is possible to build festival ontology which could
be use to translate them into Gregorian calen-
dar. We also add a limited set for the refer-
ential time expressions such as jin-tian (today),
ben-shi-ji (this century) etc. This introduces
9 elements: refcentury, refyear, refmonth,
refday, refhour, refminute, refsecond,
refJD, refdecade.

The rule system is actually trying to describe
the topological relations of the elements. The final
model is a directed graph, containing 32 nodes and
50 edges. Table 1 shows a subset of the edges as
demonstration. There are three different symbols
in the rules. A-B means B follows A. > and <
means ‘stick to’. For example, A > B means A
follows and depends on B. In other words, A can-
not be used alone. A <> B means that they stick
to each other. We should note that <> doesn’t
mean that they must appear together. For exam-
ple, if there is another rule A <> C, then A can
appear together either with B or C.

century - decade refcentury - decade
year - jq refyear - jq
year - jd refyear - jd
year - month refyear - month

month - xun refmonth - xun
month - day refmonth - day

hour<ke gzhour<ke
lunar>year lunar>month
lunar>gzyear gzyear - gzmonth

day - dp dp - hour
hour<minute minute<second

Table 1: Topological Relation of Temporal Ele-
ments.

The recognition of time expressions includes t-
wo phases: identify the temporal elements and
then concatenate the elements to get sequences
based on the topological relations of them and the
constrains described in Table 1. The recognition of
temporal elements are implemented by regular ex-
pressions. The topological relation could be mod-
eled as an acyclic graph.

3.1 Convert to TIMEX3 format

In Chinese, the numbers in each temporal elemen-
t can be a sequence of either Chinese or Arabic
digits. For example, er-ling-ling-san-nian (year
2003) can also be written as 2003-nian. For this
kind of expressions, we need a parser to get the
Chinese numbers first, which has been embedded
in our system. Meanwhile, it can also parse them
into machine readable integers.

In Chinese, we can also use Arabic numbers.
In our system, we build a parser that could trans-
late both Arabic and Chinese number into machine
readable integers. However, due to the space limi-
tation, we will not describe the parser here. Once
we get numbers for each element. Some heuris-
tic rules can be used to filter some false positive
examples. For instance, er-shi-san-dian (23:00)
is a legal time expression, while er-shi-wu-dian
(25:00) is illegal. It appears in text because it can
also mean (25 points). We add constraint on the
value of month(1, 12), day(1, 31), hour(0, 24)
etc.

Based on our rule system, the converting to
TIMEX3 format is quite straightforward since the
rules are based on the inner structures of Chinese
time entities. In cases of referential temporal el-
ements, such as refyear, refday, we can first
place a variable for further processing, since the
resolution of such references is an independen-
t task. However, this will be our future work. For
festivals, as we mentioned that most festivals have
fixed date. So, a festival dictionary will be needed.

Nevertheless, translating time entities into ma-
chine readable format is a great advantage of rule
systems. Even though statical methods can give
higher performance on recognition, there is no ob-
vious way how to convert the time entities into ma-
chine readable format unless conversion rules are
complied, which then will resort to the inner struc-
ture of the entities which is then the work done by
our rule system.

Table 2: Corpus Information.

4 Experiments

We use two different corpora: Sinica (Chen et al.,
1996) and TempEval-2 from SemEval-2010 com-
petition (Pustejovsky and Verhagen., 2009). Sini-
ca Corpus contains 10M words and the total num-
ber of time entity is 88K as shown in Table 2. The
time words are tagged as ‘Nd’. However, there is
no entity information. So, when an entity is rec-
ognized by our system, we first separate it into el-
ements and then calculate the performance. Dura-
tions are labeled as number + classifier in Sini-
ca, which are not time words. So, we don’t recog-
nize durations in Sinica. For regnal year system,
we only include a list of emperors of the Qing dy-
nasty. We don’t deal with festivals as most of them
are already lexicalized and are beyond the scope
of entities. In other words, they can be recognized
with a dictionary in a general word segmentation
task.

TempEval-2 corpus includes training and test
parts, as shown in Table 2 We analyse the anno-
tation scheme based on training data and then add
some additional rules on durations, such as shi-
nian (ten years), shi-tian (ten days), and some ap-
proximate expressions, e.g. shi-ji-nian (more than
then years) and so on. Meanwhile, we add three
new elements: past (guo-qu), present (xian-zai),
future (jiang-lai). Each element includes a list of
Chinese words.

4.1 Experimental results and Discussion
Table 3 shows the overall performance on Sinica
and TempEval-2 corpora. Our rule system gives
a high performance. Table 4 shows the precision
and the number of recalled entities for some se-
lected frequent patterns from 91 patterns identified
from Sinica. Some long patterns give 1.0 preci-
sion. Some patterns are quite ambiguous, such as
hour-minute. This is due to fact that dian means
both the point in float numbers and time hour, and
fen means both minute and score point in Chinese.
For example, san dian wu fen means both 3:05 and
3.5 points. Regarding the different performances
of different patterns, we can assign a confidence

mainly due to the annotation errors that have split
certain temporal elements into number-classifier
construction in Sinica Corpus. For example, er-
shi-wu-ri (the 25th) is annotated as er-shi-wu (25)
plus ri (day).

Most ambiguous patterns contain one elemen-
t, such as year and day. They can be both
a date and a duration when the number is ex-
pressed in Chinese or Arabic digits. For exam-
ple, 13 nian (13 year: year 2013) could also be
thirteen years. In Sinica, durations are labeled as
number + classifier, which are not time words.
In TempEval-2 corpus, both date and duration are
entities. So, it will not be a problem for detection
on this corpus. The ambiguity of such patterns in-
troduced most of the false positive examples.

Table 5 and Table 6 show the identified pattern-
s and their precision and the number of recalled
entities. Compared to Sinica corpus, TempEval-2
corpus is quite sparse, and the element refyear
such as jin-nian (this year) and present such as
mu-qian (currently), take up a large part of the en-
tities. This problem will affect the evaluation re-
sult in that the identification of time words e.g.
refyear and present will be important to the
overall performance.

pus. The features used are shown in Table 7. To
study whether the rule system could help the sta-
tistical model, we also use the recognition results
of our rule system as pattern features. The result
is shown in Table 8. We can see that the rule sys-
tem gives a much higher performance than CRFs
without using the patterns as features, i.e. 0.8564
v.s. 0.7787.

we also conduct experiment to test the statistical
model based on characters with features shown in
Table 9. This setting is actually more reasonable
than word based, since word segmentation and en-
tity recognition are overlap tasks. The result is
shown in Table 10. We can see that, compared
to word based setting, the performance increased

ing the patterns in CRFs model, the performance
could be slightly improved. Overall, we can say
that the inner structure of Chinese time entity is
more important than context features.

The false negative examples of the rule system
in Sinica includes some patterns that are not in-
cluded in our system, some of which we think
is not normal constructions of time expressions.
For example, an Arabic digit sequence without the
year marker nian, such as 2013, is also possibly a
year element. Another one is the regnal year pat-
tern, i.e. the min-guo period established in 1912
after Qing dynasty. However, there are many ex-
amples like ba-shi-ba-nian (88th years) with min-
guo omitted.

The false negative examples of the rule sys-
tem in TempEval-2 includes some time word-

s that are not encoded in the rules. Some enti-
ties contains weekdays as a parenthesis, such as
jin-ri (xing-qi-er) meaning today (Tuesday) will
be treated as two entities. Some durations such
as san-[pause punctuation]-wu-nian (three to five
years). These are also not included in our system.
The bare-number year is also a problem in this cor-
pus.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we made a linguistic study on Chi-
nese time entities and presented a rule system for
automatic recognition. We compare our system
with CRFs model and the experiments on two dif-
ferent corpora showed that it gave a higher perfor-
mance than the baseline system based on a CRFs
model. When combining the rules with CRFs, the
performance could be improved.
