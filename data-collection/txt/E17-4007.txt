Abstract

Headlines play a crucial role in attract-
ing audiences’ attention to online artefacts
(e.g. news articles, videos, blogs). The
ability to carry out an automatic, large-
scale analysis of headlines is critical to
facilitate the selection and prioritisation
of a large volume of digital content. In
journalism studies news content has been
extensively studied using manually anno-
tated news values – factors used implic-
itly and explicitly when making decisions
on the selection and prioritisation of news
items. This paper presents the first at-
tempt at a fully automatic extraction of
news values from headline text. The news
values extraction methods are applied on
a large headlines corpus collected from
The Guardian, and evaluated by compar-
ing it with a manually annotated gold stan-
dard. A crowdsourcing survey indicates
that news values affect people’s decisions
to click on a headline, supporting the need
for an automatic news values detection.

1 Introduction

In this digital age, where “the widening gap be-
tween limitless media and limited attention makes
it a challenge for anything to attract an audience”
(Webster, 2014), headlines play a special role.
Their main function is to draw attention and act
as the visual entry point to online digital con-
tent (Leckner, 2012). This is intensified on so-
cial media, where in cases of indirect engagement
(e.g. with retweeted news articles) headlines are
often the only visible part of the main content.
Liu (2005) found that compared to print media,
digital readers spend more time browsing, scan-
ning, and keyword spotting. Various studies con-
ducted by Chartbeat found that 38% of users leave

a website immediately after accessing it1, and that
an average reader will spend only 15 seconds on
a website2. An American Press Institute study
found that roughly six in ten people acknowledge
that they are “headline-gazers” checking only the
headline and not reading the full article 3.

Therefore, automatic processing of headlines is
needed to facilitate the selection and prioritisation
of large volumes of digital content. This has been
studied in the journalism field by considering news
values. These are aspects of an event determining
whether and to what extent it is reported, therefore
guiding editorial selection. Recent journalism re-
search (O’Neill and Harcup, 2009, p.171) suggests
that news values can also be applied to the audi-
ence reception perspective, thus helping to analyse
what attracts audiences to certain headlines.

The automatic extraction of news values from
headlines can be a central tool for a range of ap-
plications. Automatically extracted news values
scores can be correlated with online attention met-
rics, such as pageviews, to investigate which head-
line aspects influence online popularity. They can
play a key role in content-based recommender sys-
tems, especially when a user model is not avail-
able (the so-called ‘cold start’ problem). Headline
newsworthiness insights can be incorporated into
online content publishing, e.g. YouTube4 to guide
authors on how to compose the headline text to at-
tract audiences’ attention. Furthermore, digital hu-
manities researchers can conduct large-scale com-
parisons of news values across digital outlet types,
genres, demographics, etc.

Despite the importance of headline news val-
ues, there are no automatic computational means
to extract them from headline text. This requires
advanced text processing to compute appropriate

features that can be related to news values. It
makes for a challenging problem, because news
values often involve tacit knowledge. There are
no precise definitions of news values which can
be used for automatic text processing, which is
further aggravated by the nature of headline text.
Critically, there are no studies to inform how to as-
sociate news values with various features that can
be automatically extracted from headline text.

To address these challenges we utilise state-of-
the-art techniques to develop a method for auto-
matic extraction of news values from headline text.
Our solution includes several NLP methods, such
as wikification, sentiment analysis, and language
modeling. We further combine them with other
AI methods, including a burst detection algorithm
to propose new techniques for estimating entities’
prominence. The approach is applied and evalu-
ated on a large corpus of news headlines from a
prominent news source – The Guardian.

Focusing on headline news values, the paper
presents a new perspective on processing digi-
tal content and contributes to text analytics by:
(i) providing the first computational method for
a fully automatic extraction of news values from
headlines which combines relevant NLP tech-
niques; (ii) evaluating the news values feature en-
gineering by applying the computational method
to a large corpus of news headlines and comparing
the automatic annotation to a gold standard devel-
oped for this task, (iii) confirming through a user
crowdsourcing study that people’s choices to click
on news items are influenced by news values in the
headlines, indicating the significance of automatic
news values detection.

2 Related Work

Headlines are gaining ground in the NLP com-
munity as a text type to be studied separately.
This follows research suggesting that headlines
can function autonomously from the full text. Ac-
cording to Dor (2003) the reader receives “the
best deal in reading the headline itself”. Empir-
ical studies seem to support this – Gabielkov et al.
(2016) found that 59% of shared news content on
Twitter is not clicked on, i.e. has not been read
before being shared. This makes headlines key for
sharing content on social media. In the journal-
ism community, the importance of headlines has
already been acknowledged. For example, Althaus
et al. (2001) looked at substitutes for full article

text including headlines and their impact on con-
tent analysis. Tenenboim and Cohen (2013) con-
ducted a study on the effect of headline content on
clicking and commenting. However, these efforts
included a manual annotation, which limited their
scope. More recently, NLP researchers also fo-
cused on headlines, including headline generation
(Gatti et al., 2016) and keyword selection for pop-
ularising content (Szymanski et al., 2016). We add
to this ongoing NLP research by proposing news
values to analyse headlines.

News values originated in the journalism stud-
ies field with the work by Galtung and Ruge
(1965). Since then a variety of taxonomies of news
values have been proposed: Bell (1991), Harcup
and O’Neill (2001), Johnson-Cartee (2005) and
Bednarek and Caple (2012). Regardless of differ-
ences in granularity and definitions, there is a con-
siderable overlap between all these taxonomies.
This allows us to select the news values which are
most frequently mentioned and most relevant to
headline text. These include: prominence, sen-
timent, superlativeness, proximity, surprise, and
uniqueness. We offer a systematic and fully repli-
cable method of an automatic extraction of these
news values from headlines. Furthermore, we
show that these news values influence people’s de-
cisions to click on a headline.

News values have been widely used in jour-
nalism studies, however researchers still mainly
rely on manual annotation. For example, news
values were used by Bednarek and Caple (2014)
to analyse news discourse, while Kepplinger and
Ehmig (2006) used them to predict the newswor-
thiness of news articles. Since news values need
to be annotated manually, large-scale analyses of
news articles in journalism studies have focused
on aspects that are readily available through arti-
cle metadata (e.g. topics in Bastos (2014)). There
have been some limited attempts at using compu-
tational methods to enable large-scale annotation
of news values from text, however these can be
described at most as semi-automatic. For exam-
ple, Potts et al. (2015) manually choose news val-
ues indicators from a preprocessed corpus; more-
over, the approach relies on keywords and is topic-
dependent. This paper presents the first attempt at
a fully automatic and topic-independent extraction
of news values which is applied and validated on
headlines from a ‘broadsheet’ news source. Our
news values detection is largely not news-specific

65



and can be extended to titles in other genres.
From an NLP perspective headlines pose an

engineering challenge. This includes linguistic
aspects like unusual use of tenses (Chovanec,
2014) and deliberate ambiguity (Brône and Coul-
son, 2010). There are also some domain-specific
phenomena like click-baiting (Blom and Hansen,
2015). Headlines are typically short, which limits
the amount of context that many NLP tools rely
on. While feature engineering from headlines is
less studied, there are research efforts that specif-
ically address short texts. Tweets have attracted
considerable attention, leading to the development
of some Twitter-specific tools (e.g. TweetNLP5).
Tan et al. (2014) is an example of feature engineer-
ing from tweets that looks specifically at wording
and its effect on popularity. Another example of
a text closely related to headlines are online con-
tent titles, e.g. image titles on Reddit (Lakkaraju
et al., 2013). Many approaches include features
like ratios for various parts of speech, sentiment,
and similarity to a language model. However,
they need to be adjusted to work with headlines.
For example, since headlines offer limited con-
text, sentiment analysis carried out on word-level
is more appropriate (cf. Tan et al. (2014), Gatti
et al. (2016), Szymanski et al. (2016)). For each
news value we either re-implement the most ap-
propriate state-of-the-art methods, or implement
new techniques that work well with headlines.

3 Extraction of News Values

We present feature engineering methods for six
news values. These six were selected, because
they occur frequently in news values taxonomies
(cf. Section 2). The feature computation methods
are summarised in Table 2. Although our goal is a
generic framework, we are inspired by research in
the news domain. Consequently, the features are
informed by news values related to news content.

Preprocessing. All headlines are part-of-
speech tagged (Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova
et al., 2003)) and parsed (Stanford Parser (Klein
and Manning, 2003)). Wikification (a method
of linking keywords in text to relevant Wikipedia
pages; e.g. Mihalcea and Csomai (2007)) is used
to identify entities in the text. Headlines are wiki-
fied using the TagMe API6, a tool meant for short
texts, making it suitable for headlines.

5http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ ark/TweetNLP/
6http://tagme.di.unipi.it/

Notation. We see the headline H as a set of
tokens obtained from the POS tagger. We denote
the set of content words in H as C and the set of
entities in H as E (cf. Table 1).

Table 1: Preprocessing: H (set of tokens), C (set
of content words), E (set of wikified entities)

“Emma Watson’s makeup tweets highlight the com-
modification of beauty”
H ={ Emma, Watson, ’s, makeup, tweets, highlight, the,

commodification, of, beauty}
C ={makeup, tweets, highlight, commodification, beauty }
E ={ EMMA WATSON, COMMODIFICATION }

NV1: Prominence. Reference to prominent en-
tities (elite nations and people (Galtung and Ruge,
1965), and more recently celebrities (Harcup and
O’Neill, 2001)) is one of the key news values.

We approximate prominence as the amount of
online attention an entity gets. As online promi-
nence varies with time we consider long-term vs.
recent prominence and burstiness. We extend pre-
vious work by using wikification for obtaining en-
tities and considering their burstiness.

For an entity e, we denote as
pageviewse,d−m,d−n the median number of
Wikipedia daily page views7 for that entity
between days d−m and d−n. Day numbering is
determined in reference to the article publication
day d. Wikipedia long-term prominence is
calculated over one year (pageviewse,d−365,d−1),
and Wikipedia recent prominence on the day
before publication (pageviewse,d−1,d−1).

8 For a
news-centric perspective of prominence, we also
calculate the sum of e’s mentions in the news
source headlines in the week before publication
day, denoted as newsmentionse,d−7,d−1 .

As entities exhibit different temporal patterns
of prominence, we differentiate between entities
which have a steady prominence (e.g. SILICONE)
and entities which become bursty, i.e. suddenly
prominent for a short period of time (e.g. EBOLA
VIRUS). To identify bursty entities, we imple-
ment the burst detection algorithm by Vlachos et
al. (2004) (cf. Algorithm 1). An entity is defined
as being in a burst if its moving average in a given
time frame is above the cut-off point (cf. Figure 1).
We use entity bursts in two ways. Firstly, bursti-
ness indicates the number of days that e was in
a burst over a year (daysburste,d−365,d−1). Sec-

8We found the previous day’s prominence to be closest to

the actual on-the-day prominence.

Figure 1: Time series plots of Wikipedia page
views moving averages (MA) for two entities:
non-bursty SILICONE (top) and bursty EBOLA
VIRUS DISEASE (bottom). The dashed line shows
the burst cut-off line.

ondly, current burst size indicates how many stan-
dard deviations above MAe is any e which is in a
burst day before publication (daysburste,d−1,d−1
returns 1 if e is in a burst, 0 if not). We are the first
to consider burstiness for popularity prediction.

Algorithm 1 Burst detection algorithm adapted
from Vlachos et al. (2004). Following experimen-
tation, moving average was set to three days and
the cut-off point to two times standard deviation.
1: Calculate moving average of length 3 for entity e (MAe)

for sequence d−365, ...d−1.
2: Set cutoff = mean(MAe) + 2× SD(MAe)
3: Bursts = di|MAe(i) > cutoff

As a headline can have multiple entities, all
prominence measures are aggregated via summa-
tion over all entities in H (see Table 2).

NV2: Sentiment. This refers to sentiment-
charged events (Johnson-Cartee, 2005) and using
sentiment-charged language (Bednarek and Caple,
2012). Features relating to sentiment and emotion-
ality have been shown to influence a news article’s
virality (Berger and Milkman, 2012). However,
this effect has not been studied for headlines.

As direct measures of sentiment, we combine
SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) positivity
and negativity scores of content words, and calcu-
late sentiment and polarity scores following Ku-
cuktunc et al. (2012). Sentiment can also be in-
direct. Firstly, a word may be in itself objective,
but carry a negative connotation (e.g. scream). We
therefore measure the percentage of content words

in a headline with a positive or negative conno-
tation (using a connotations lexicon (Feng et al.,
2013)). Secondly, we measure the percentage of
biased content words (using a bias lexicon (Re-
casens et al., 2013)). For example, the same po-
litical organisation can be described as far-right,
nationalist, or fascist, each of these words indicat-
ing a bias towards a certain reading.

NV3: Superlativeness. The size (Johnson-
Cartee, 2005, p.128), or magnitude (Harcup and
O’Neill, 2001) of an event is considered to influ-
ence news selection.

We focus on explicit linguistic indicators of
event size: comparatives and superlatives (indi-
cated by part-of-speech tags), and amplifiers (in-
dicated with intensifiers and downtoners). For the
latter, we combine the lists in Quirk et al. (1985)
and Biber (1991), obtaining wordlists of 248 in-
tensifiers and 39 downtoners.

NV4: Proximity. This news value has been
interpreted as both geographical (Johnson-Cartee,
2005, p.128) and cultural proximity (Galtung and
Ruge, 1965) of the event to the news source or the
reader (Caple and Bednarek, 2013).

Following an assumption that readers from the
country of a news outlet constitute the main part
of its readership, we focus on geographic proxim-
ity to the news source. We use a binary feature that
indicates whether a headline refers to an entity that
is geographically close to the news source, and
manually create a wordlist including names for the
country, regions, capital city (17 UK-related terms
in total). We then look for matches in the head-
line text (“London smog warning as Saharan sand
sweeps southern England”) or the Wikipedia cat-
egories of each entity supplied in the TagMe out-
put (category POSTAL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED
KINGDOM for headline “Undervaluing Royal Mail
shares cost taxpayers £750m in one day”).

NV5: Surprise. Events which involve “sur-
prise and/or contrast” (Harcup and O’Neill, 2001)
make news. Surprise in headlines can be implicit
(“Denver Post hires Whoopi Goldberg to write for
marijuana blog”), which requires world knowl-
edge to identify it, or explicit (“Beekeeper creates
coat of living bees”), where it arises from unusual
word combinations.

We target explicit surprise by calculating the
commonness of phrases in headlines with refer-
ence to a large corpus. We first extract phrases of
following types: SUBJ-V, V-OBJ, ADV-V, ADJ-

their inflected forms (e.g. man drinks → man

tain a count from a Wikipedia corpus9 and sum
the counts for each phrase and calculate its log-
likelihood (LL). The feature value is given the
lowest LL in the headline (as we are looking for
the most surprising phrase)10.

NV6: Uniqueness. News has to be new – ”any
new comment or circumstance [. . . ] adds to the
debate” (Conley and Lamble, 2006). An analy-
sis of several storylines in the headlines corpus
showed that of two very similar headlines, the lat-
ter tends to be less popular (“Ferry disaster: South
Korean prime minister resigns” was more popu-
lar than the later “South Korean prime minister re-
signs over ferry sinking”).

For a headline H we select past headlines from
72 hours beforeH’s publication and which have at
least one TagMe entity overlapping or neither has
any entities11. For a pair of H and pastH vectors
(created using a tf-idf weighted Gigaword corpus)
we calculate their cosine similarity. The highest
cosine similarity is assigned as the feature value.

9http://www.nlp.cs.nyu.edu/wikipedia-data
10We experimented with other corpora and metrics and

found Wikipedia and log-likelihood to give best results.
11Entity overlap helps with ensuring that the headlines are

part of the same storyline; including headlines with no enti-
ties ensures more coverage. Collecting headlines from previ-
ous 72 hours works better than other cutoff points.

4 Application and Evaluation

We applied the feature extraction methods on a
corpus of headlines from The Guardian, a major
British newspaper. This provides a wide cover-
age of various topics and genres, allowing a good
exploration of news values. The automatic extrac-
tion of news values was compared to a manually
annotated gold standard.

Headline corpus. The headlines corpus was
built using the Guardian Content API12. We down-
loaded all headlines published during April 2014,
yielding a corpus of 11,980 headlines.

Automatic annotation. Feature values were
calculated for each headline. Statistics for the ex-
tracted features in The Guardian corpus are re-
ported in Table 2 (Median, Max, Prevalence).

Manually annotated gold standard. For each
news value we selected 20 headlines from the
headlines corpus. In order to use the clear-
est examples for a more accurate annotation,
we randomly selected 10 headlines from the top
quartile values and 10 from the bottom quar-
tile. For news values that are split into multi-
ple features (NV1:Prominence, NV2:Sentiment,
NV3:Superlativeness), the feature group vectors
were ordered to obtain quartiles. Overall, a total
of 120 headlines were selected for manual anno-
tation. Three expert annotators, PhD students in
linguistics, annotated each headline as positive or

12http://www.theguardian.com/open-platform

68



negative (Y/N) for the first five news values (cf.
Table 3). For NV6:Uniqueness, annotators were
presented with 20 headlines from the corpus and
further 20 past headlines with highest and lowest
headline uniqueness scores (which were randomly
sampled). The annotators indicated whether any
of the past headlines were very similar (i.e. highly
related) to a given headline.

Inter-annotator agreement. The inter-
annotator agreement was calculated using
Fleiss’s Kappa. It ranges from substantial for
NV1:Prominence (.76) and NV6:Uniqueness
(.73), through moderate for NV3:Superlativeness
(.43), NV5:Surprise (.48), and NV4:Proximity
(.55), to fair for NV2:Sentiment (.22). The
annotators remarked that sometimes they chose
‘on instinct’ and their responses might vary from
day to day. This highlights the challenge of an
automatic detection of news values, as news
values are somehow tacitly understood. The
annotators’ judgments were aggregated using a
majority vote, creating the gold standard.

Comparison with gold standard. We calcu-
lated pairwise comparisons between each feature
and the relevant manual label (e.g. number of en-
tities and Prominence, bias and Sentiment). The
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine whether
the differences in feature values for the two man-
ual annotation labels (Y/N) were significant (cf.
column KW in Table 2). These results indicate
whether the value calculated for a given feature
correctly reflects the presence of a news value in
the gold standard produced by the human experts.
The findings of the evaluation are discussed below.

5 Discussion of Feature Extraction

We use a news corpus that is representative of a
wide range of news publications under the um-
brella of ‘broadsheet’ (as opposed to tabloid news-
papers which differ in style and tone). The
Guardian corpus is a freely available resource, al-
lowing replication of methods and study findings.
While the evaluation of feature extraction is con-
ducted over one corpus, we also applied this ap-
proach to another publicly available ‘broadsheet’
corpus – New York Times (cf. Appendix A). We
will discuss below the findings from The Guardian
evaluation study, and will refer to feature extrac-
tion outputs from New York Times to illustrate fea-
ture behaviour on two corpora.

NV1: Prominence is one of the most preva-

lent news values and our approach using wikifi-
cation proves very reliable. It occurs quite fre-
quently – most headlines in The Guardian corpus
have at least one entity (median number of entities
= 1), which attracts a fair amount of online atten-
tion (median Wikipedia long-term prominence =
1,342 pageviews). Some headlines include very
prominent entities (max. Wikipedia day-before
prominence = 1,031,722). The outputs from New
York Times are similar – every headline is asso-
ciated with at least one Wikipedia entity (100%
prevalence for number of entities); and Wikipedia
burstiness, long-term, and day-before prominence
have non-zero scores in 66% of headlines. This
shows that Wikipedia provides a wide coverage
for the computation of prominence. Wikipedia
current burst size is a rare feature (12% in The
Guardian and 10% in NYT), because capturing an
entity in a burst is uncommon, since bursts do not
apply to all entities and do not happen frequently.

The IAA for Prominence is the highest (κ=.76)
and nearly all features reach p<0.001 when com-
pared to the manual annotations. This strongly
supports our implementation of Prominence, in
particular the use of wikification and Wikipedia
as a prominence source. Burstiness presents a
new way of looking at Prominence. While bursti-
ness (i.e. how many times in a year an entity had
pageviews significantly higher than its average) is
a reliable feature, current burst size (i.e. size of the
burst on the day before article publication) is not
significantly correlated with the gold standard.

NV2: Sentiment is among the most challeng-
ing news values to implement, since it is not typ-
ical for broadsheets and sentiment-charged lan-
guage in headlines does not always accurately re-
flect the true sentiment or emotion. Headlines
in broadsheet newspapers tend to be quite neutral
(median sentiment = -2; median polarity = 0.5).
This is also the case for the New York Times (senti-
ment = -2; polarity = 0). However, most headlines
contain at least one connotated or biased word
(connotations prevalence = 92%, bias prevalence
= 61%; slightly lower in NYT: 78% and 51%).

The IAA was fair, at κ=.22. The fact that many
headlines are neutral can explain the low agree-
ment, since the neutral cases are where experts
are more likely to disagree. Furthermore, while
manual annotation for one aspect of Sentiment like
positivity/negativity can achieve substantial agree-
ment (.76 agreement between experts in Snow et

al. (2008)), our definition of Sentiment is broader.
The annotators pointed out an interesting charac-
teristic of expressing Sentiment. On one hand,
there were highly evocative headlines that describe
some tragic news events (+sentiment, +emotion).
On the other hand, some headlines use sentiment-
charged language, but were not evocative to the
same extent (+sentiment, -emotion). For exam-
ple, comedy (E5 in Table 3) has positive senti-
ment, but does not evoke positive emotion. When
compared to the manual annotations, two out of
four Sentiment features reach significance levels,
so our implementation does capture some aspects
of Sentiment. Extracting Sentiment from head-
lines proves a challenge, since they are short texts
with limited context and often the sentiment is im-
plied or requires world knowledge to identify (e.g.
“Guinea’s Ebola outbreak: what is the virus and
what’s being done?”). Disentangling sentiment
and emotion might paint a clearer picture.

NV3: Superlativeness is rare, but reliably ex-
tracted. It is the least prevalent news value (be-
tween 4-10%; between 3-6% in NYT). The me-
dian values are also all zero. Our narrower defini-
tion of could be the reason, however we decided
to focus on explicit linguistic indicators of event
size (e.g. very, hardly) to keep the implementation
topic-independent and more easily generalisable.

The IAA was moderate (κ=.43). Two out of
three features were significant at p<0.001. This
confirms that our approach that relies on POS tags
and wordlists does capture this news value. The
only feature not to reach a significance level was
downtoners. Downtoners are a class of words
which aim to diminish the word they describe (e.g.
nearly, barely, just). They are not only rare (preva-
lence is 4%), but also require specific knowledge
to identify them (we identified 39 downtoners,
compared to 248 intensifiers). Bearing in mind

that downtoners might have more impact if their
coverage increases with a more comprehensive
wordlist, the other Superlativeness features (com-
parative/superlative and intensifiers) can be reli-
ably used for headlines.

NV4: Proximity is not frequent, but our ap-
proach using a wordlist and Wikipedia categories
proves very reliable. This news values occurs in
35% of headlines. This is not surprising, consider-
ing that The Guardian has a global audience, so
the majority of news is not UK-specific (preva-
lence in NYT is similar at 32%).

The IAA is moderate (κ=.55). The feature
reaches significance at p<0.001, so our method
of capturing Proximity is well-supported. Us-
ing entity categories ensures wider coverage and
less manual effort than just using a wordlist.
This is turn depends on the reliability of the
NER/wikification tools. In some cases an en-
tity might be missed (cf. E1 in Table 3, where
EE/Orange was missed and consequently both
Prominence and Proximity scores are zero). It is
important to note that Proximity covers both ge-
ographic and cultural proximity. Our annotators
were UK residents, familiar with The Guardian,
but demographics of the reader will probably in-
fluence their familiarity with some entities. In our
future work we will include some demographics
data to deepen the implementation for Proximity.

NV5: Surprise is difficult to implement due
to peculiarities of headline text, but our ap-
proach which targets surprising phrasing using a
Wikipedia-based language model does capture it.
The median log-likelihood for this features is rel-
atively low (4.15; 4.04 for NYT), which means
that most headlines have fairly surprising phras-
ing. This might be because headlines do not tend
to strictly follow the conventions of everyday lan-
guage (e.g. frequent use of untensed verbs and

70



noun clusters). When using a corpus which is not
specifically for headlines (we used Wikipedia), the
log-likelihood will tend to be lower.

The IAA was moderate at κ=.48 and the fea-
ture is significant (p<0.05). This shows that using
a count-based method captures this news value.
In other genres where surprise might play a big-
ger role, this method can be extended by using
a headline-specific corpus or building language
model that takes into account syntactic structure.

NV6: Uniqueness, or rather a lack of it, is
fairly rare, but our implementation reliably iden-
tities such instances. The prevalence is quite low
(15%; but slightly higher at 34% in New York
Times), which follows the basic journalistic prin-
ciple that news have to be novel.

IAA was substantial with κ=.73 and the feature
was significant (p<0.05), so we can be sure that
any similar headlines are identified. An analysis
of headlines with non-zero Uniqueness values re-
veals that most of them are either part of a reg-
ular feature (e.g. “Reviews roundup”), or part of
continuing storylines about the same event (often
featuring some media like video).

Overall, the results of the evaluation are en-
couraging: for every news value the majority of
features significantly differentiates between the
manual annotation labels. This means that our
approach successfully identified and quantified at
least some aspects of every news value.

The study also indicated open issues requiring
further investigation. Firstly, the findings high-
light the importance of world knowledge when
analysing headlines. For example, for the well-
established NLP topic like sentiment analysis, we
find that although purely linguistic methods can
capture most phenomena in headlines, they fall
short to recognise sentiment within entities (e.g.
Ebola). Similarly, a more generic approach for
Proximity would require world knowledge to de-
tect that an entity is related to the reader’s loca-
tion. We are addressing this in our future work.
Secondly, it will be interesting to explore how the
proposed methods can be applied to other types of
news sources (e.g. tabloids) and to genres other
than news. With the exception of news source
prominence and uniqueness, our features are not
news-specific. Titles for other types of digital con-
tent (blogs, videos) also include prominent enti-
ties, sentiment or intensifiers. News values de-
tection offers a new perspective for their analysis.

Thirdly, our methods can be adapted to other lan-
guages, provided that certain NLP resources ex-
ist (POS tagger, NER, sentiment lexicon). This
would enable large-scale analyses of headlines
along multiple axes, like language and genre.

6 Do News Values Influence People’s
Choice of Headlines?

To show the importance of the automatic news
value extraction for a range of applications (cf.
Section 1), we examined whether news values
matter for general audiences. This was explored
with a crowdsourcing study.

Survey content. The survey consisted of
five short sections for news values NV1 to
NV5 (NV6:Uniqueness was not included, be-
cause we decided to focus on news values which
are expressed within a single headline, whereas
the Uniqueness feature requires comparing head-
lines). In each section participants were presented
with a short definition and several examples. Then
they were asked the following: ”I personally con-
sider this news value when clicking on headlines”
and given five Likert scale responses (cf. Figure
2). Standard demographics information (age, gen-
der, country of residence, native language, news
reading habits) was collected.

Participants. The crowdsourcing platform
CrowdFlower was used to recruit participants for
the survey, allowing us to collect responses glob-
ally, thus reflecting the global nature of audiences
of online news outlets. The survey took approx-
imately 10 minutes to complete and participants
were paid $2 for taking part. Out of 100 collected
responses, 96 were recorded as complete. While
quality of responses was generally quite high, we
carried out some quality control. We removed any
responses where more than 75% of answers were
neutral, as well as responses where time to com-
plete was in the bottom quartile (to ensure that
participants had taken time to understand the con-
cepts). After the quality control measures, 71 re-
sponses were selected: 48 participants were 34 or
younger and 23 were 35 or older; 17 were female,
54 were male; 30 were native English speakers and
41 were non-native English speakers; 44 partici-
pants read news daily, 27 weekly.

Results and discussion. Results are presented
in Fig. 2. The overall impact that news values
have on survey participants has been indicated as
very positive. NV1:Prominence, NV4:Proximity,

71

sonally consider this news value when clicking on
headlines” (N=71). Percentages show aggregated
positive, neutral, and negative responses.

and NV2:Sentiment had the highest proportions
of positive answers (77%, 76%, and 68%, re-
spectively). This follows the journalism stud-
ies literature, where these three news values at-
tract perhaps the most focus. Comparison with
the gold standard confirmed that our implementa-
tion for NV1:Prominence and NV4:Proximity re-
flects the experts’ judgments. Since this survey
highlighted the role of Sentiment, we are moti-
vated to develop it further to capture its full ex-
tent. NV3:Superlativeness had the most neutral
responses (37%). On one hand, this could be be-
cause this news value is slightly more difficult to
understand13. On the other hand, Superlativeness
might have been deemed to play a lesser role, since
its main function is more supportive (to embellish
or diminish content). Finally, NV5:Surprise had
the most negative responses (25%). This might be
because surprising headlines could be perceived as
less informative, or more ambiguous. As people
often read only headlines to get their news (Ga-
bielkov et al., 2016), surprise would not support
the headlines’ function as summaries.

Overall, results of this survey highlight the im-
portance of news values in headlines. We also
found that news values play a role for both native
and non-native speakers of English (our sample
has roughly equal numbers of both). This is im-
portant, since most major news outlets nowadays
have a more global reach.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

The work presented here is the first step in a larger
project to predict the popularity of news articles
using headlines. Our focus on headlines is moti-
vated by their role in the everyday online experi-
ence, characterised by limited audience attention

1357% of native English speakers judged Superlativeness
positively compared to 44% of non-native speakers.

and the frequent use of social media websites.
We proposed an automatic extraction method

for news values, which have been posited in jour-
nalism studies and offer a new perspective on
characterising digital content. We broke novel
ground by developing fully automatic and topic-
independent methods for identifying news values
in headlines. An evaluation using manual annota-
tions shows that for all news values the output of
the automatic extraction corresponds to the gold
standard. The results from a crowdsourced sur-
vey indicated that news values influence people’s
decisions to click on a headline. This supports
the wider adoption of the automatic method of
analysing headlines in a range of applications con-
cerning human choices (e.g. prediction models,
recommender systems, intelligent assistants).

Our current and future work includes several
stages. Firstly, we have collected a second cor-
pus (New York Times) to apply our news values
extraction methods. Secondly, the extracted news
values scores are being correlated with popularity
of headlines on social media and applied in a pop-
ularity prediction model using machine learning
methods. The results from the manual annotations
and the crowdsourced survey will also be used to
inform the weights of features in the prediction
model. Furthermore, another survey will target the
direct engagement with headlines (i.e. whether a
reader would click the headline) and compare it
to the social media popularity metrics we have al-
ready collected. Finally, using both data from the
crowdsourced surveys and publicly available Twit-
ter data we will look at whether demographics, in
particular the country of residence, have impact on
the news values of Prominence and Proximity. We
will use the data on the entities we identified from
knowledge bases like Wikidata and BabelNet to
enrich the implementations of these news values.
