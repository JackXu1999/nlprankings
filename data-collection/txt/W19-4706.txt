Abstract

I survey some recent approaches to studying
change in the lexicon, particularly change in
meaning across phylogenies. I briefly sketch
an evolutionary approach to language change
and point out some issues in recent approaches
to studying semantic change that rely on tem-
porally stratified word embeddings. I draw
illustrations from lexical cognate models in
Pama-Nyungan to identify meaning classes
most appropriate for lexical phylogenetic in-
ference, particularly highlighting the impor-
tance of variation in studying change over
time.

1 Introduction

All aspects of all languages are changing all the
time. And for most of human history, for most of
the world’s languages, this change is not recorded.
Therefore, in order to understand language change
adequately, we need methods which allow us to
extrapolate back beyond what is identifiable in the
written record, which is both shallow and geo-
graphically sparse. In this paper, I discuss how
evolutionary approaches to language change allow
the modeling of cognate evolution. I show how
such models can be used to study semantic change
at the macro-level, and finally how we can make
use of existing data to refine meaning categories
for use in inferring language splits. I focus on the-
oretical models of change.

I begin with a brief outline of contemporary
language change, particularly as studied quanti-
tatively (Bowern 2018 provides more context).
I then discuss issues of reconstructing meaning
and identifying meaning change, before present-
ing two case studies: one on studying semantic
change across a phylogeny, the other about identi-
fying lexical stability.

1.1 What is language change
Much contemporary work on historical linguistics
aims to answer one or more of three key questions
for the nature of language change:

1. What forms have changed?

2. How does change work?

3. Why does it work the way it does?

The first aspect of diachrony involves establish-
ing the “facts”: that is, identifying differences be-
tween languages at various stages of their history
(or differences between related languages) and es-
tablishing which of those differences are due to
change in the system, and which are artefacts of
data gathering or sampling. Research of this type
includes how language informs our study of pre-
history. Questions of this type include “Where
was the homeland of speakers of Proto-Pama-
Nyungan?” (Bouckaert et al., 2018) or “What is
the origin of the Latin ablative case?”

The second question – how does change work
– seeks to establish the general properties of
change. These are “mode and tempo” type ques-
tions (Greenhill et al., 2010), regarding which
items in language change more rapidly than oth-
ers, what features change into which others, and
which features are stable across centuries and mil-
lennia. Work in this area include Hamilton et al.
(2016b) on semantic change, Wedel et al. (2013)
on sound change, Van Gelderen (2018) on change
in argument structure, and indeed much work of
recent years (Bowern and Evans, 2014).

The third question – the why of language change
– has received less attention. Until recently, it has
been difficult to study changes at the scale neces-
sary, and with the precision necessary, to do more
than speculate. Moreover, the focus in histori-
cal linguistics on language-internal explanations
has made it difficult to grapple with the obvious



49

fact that languages change in large part because
of the way people acquire and use them (see fur-
ther §1.2). One example of modeling a ‘why’ of
change in meaning comes from Ahern and Clark
(2017), which argues that one type of semantic
change occurs because of psychological tenden-
cies for interlocutors to assume exaggeration.

What

How Why

Figure 1: Key questions

All of these questions are related to one another,
and the answers to one inform the others. We
cannot make plausible inferences about processes
without a theory, any more than we can work on a
theory of change without data to test it with. The
what provides us with observations; the why pro-
vides us with a theory that explains those observa-
tions, and the how provides us with a framework
to structure those observations, and to predict and
evaluate implications of the theory.

Language change can be studied at different
scales. Phylogenetic approaches typically look
across millennia (Bowern, 2018; Greenhill et al.,
2010) and concentrate on areas that are assumed
to be stable. Other methods look at micro-levels
of change; for example, Yao et al. (2018); Hamil-
ton et al. (2016b) and Eisenstein et al. (2014) study
change at the range of decades and weeks respec-
tively.

1.2 Traditional explanations of language
change

The current ‘received view of language change can
be summarized as follows (necessarily with much
loss of nuance; see further Hock and Joseph 1996).
Language change begins with an innovation in a
single language user. That innovation catches on
and spreads through a community, over time re-
placing older forms. Because not all members
of a language community interact with each other
all the time, innovations spread at different rates,
and to different extents, across a language area.
Thus dialects form, and those dialects eventually
become sufficiently different that they come to be
regarded as different languages. Innovations may

also be introduced when speakers/signers of a lan-
guage come into contact with a different language
or dialect and adopt some of its features.

Most generative approaches to change assume
that the point at which languages change is when
children are acquiring language (Lightfoot, 1991;
Hale, 2007), a model that goes back ultimately to
Paul (1880). Yet we know that language acquisi-
tion is not the main driver of all language change.
Language change in the historical record happens
too fast for children to be solely involved.1 The
evidence is overwhelming that childrens role is
minimal (Aitchison, 2003) in the spread of inno-
vations. The errors that children make are not the
main types of change we see in the record. More-
over, innovations are spread through social net-
works, and children acquiring language have pe-
ripheral positions in such networks.

The key questions model of change summarized
in Figure 1, though fairly common in evolutionary
anthropology and in phylogenetic approaches, is
not the way historical linguistics has been concep-
tualized traditionally. Weinreich et al. (1968) or
Labov (2001), Lightfoot (1991), and others in the
generative tradition have often conceptualized the
nature of the task of historical linguistics is being
about the differences between two stages of a lan-
guage. That is a simpler problem, since it reduces
language change to problem of edit distances. But
it does not answer the questions we posed above,
except inasmuch as identifying the differences –
that is, figuring out that something happened – is
just Stage 0 in understanding what happened, how
it happened, and why.

1.3 Evolutionary views of change

An alternative approach is a framework which
treats language as a complex evolutionary system
(e.g. Bowern, 2018; Mesoudi, 2011; Wedel, 2006).
This views language as a Darwinian system where
changes are modeled through the key properties of
variation, selection, and transmission.

In an evolutionary system, change is modeled
as follows. The unit of study is the population; for
language, our ‘population’ could be a speech com-
munity or members of an ethno-linguistic group
(Marlowe, 2005). Such communities are inher-
ently variable: we know that not everyone speaks
the same way, and that variation has social mean-

1Compare the arguments in D’Arcy (2017) for the recent
spread of ‘like’ as a discourse particle.

in an evolutionary framework

ing. Systems which contain no variation cannot be
modeled in an evolutionary framework.

Much linguistic variation can be described in
terms of social variables such as age, gender,
socioeconomic class, geography, ethnicity, patri-
group, moiety, and the like (though of course, not
all of these variables explain linguistic variation).
Speakers do not use these variables deterministi-
cally, but with them index aspects of social iden-
tity (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005). Other inputs to the
pool of variation include psychological and phys-
iological aspects of language production and per-
ception. For example, the fundamental frequency
(or ‘pitch’) of speech partly varies physiologi-
cally (taller people have deeper voices), partly so-
cially (higher and lower pitch can index femininity
and masculinity, respectively), and partly gram-
matically (for example, the difference between a
declarative statement and a question can be sig-
naled solely by an intonational rise at the end of
the clause).

Some of these variants are under selection (pos-
itive or negative). Not all variants have equal
chances of spreading within a community. Not all
variants are under positive or negative selection;
those that are are likely to change faster. Selec-
tion can be models as a set of bias biases in lan-
guage transmission which inhibit or faciliate trans-
mission. Such biases include acquisition, cogni-
tive/physiological biases, and social biases.

Over time, these biases affect the input that chil-
dren are exposed to, as well as the ways adults use
language. We see the results reflected over genera-
tions as “change” propagated through the linguis-
tic record.

Conceptualizing language change in this way
has consequences for how change is studied. In-
stead of looking across a system to extract gener-
alizations, we are looking within a system for the

points at which features vary. That is, we are not
just comparing differences across points in time,
but examining variation within a system and how
that variation changes over time. Contrast seman-
tic change studied by word embeddings, for exam-
ple, where words are treated as discrete and uni-
form entities at each time point. As such, they are
unable to distinguish between relative shifts in fre-
quency of use among subsenses, and the spread of
genuine innovations. The former may be a precur-
sor to the latter, but the processes are not identical.

Moreover, studying change in this way (cor-
rectly) entails that we not conceptualize change
as ‘facilitating efficient communication’. This is a
teleological view. Instead, biases and synchronic
features of language make some changes more or
less likely (cf. Blevins, 2004).

Finally, the transmission mechanism for lan-
guage need not be strictly intergenerational. Tak-
ing an evolutionary view of language change does
not entail that it be studied with direct and concrete
analogues to biological replication and speciation.
A evolutionary view requires that there be a mod-
eled transmission mechanism, not that the trans-
mission mechanism exclusively involves transfer
of material from parents to their children.

2 Lexical replacement models

2.1 Types of lexical replacement
With that background, let us now consider
‘change’ specifically as applied to the lexicon.
Like other parts of language, the lexicon is also
constantly changing. The lexicon can be viewed
as a set of mappings between forms, meanings,
and the world. For example, the form we write as
cat maps to a concept, which relates to language
users’ knowledge of this animal in the real world.

The following points summarize the types of
lexical replacement that are possible in spoken and
signed languages. Numerous works on seman-
tic change have typologized the relationships be-
tween words and concepts at different stages in
time (cf. Traugott and Dasher, 2002). Terms such
as subjectification, meronymy, and amelioration
all describe different relationships between words
across time. Such points are, in this typology, all
contained under the concept of “semantic change”.

1. Semantic change: that is, change in mappings
between a lexical item, concepts, and world

2. Borrowing from other languages



51

3. Creation of words de novo

4. (Loss)

As Bender (2019) has noted, because of the
heavy emphasis on English in NLP, the distinc-
tion between words and concepts is sometimes ob-
scured. Yet it is vital when considering how con-
cepts change. For example, if I describe a move-
ment as catlike, I am evoking aspects of the con-
cept ‘cat’, not a literal cat. (Someone can walk in
a catlike fashion without, for example, being furry
or having a tail.)

An emphasis on typologically similar and
closely related languages is also problematic for
studying tendencies. For example, Hamilton et al.
(2016a) argue as an absolute that nouns are more
likely to undergo irregular cultural shifts (e.g. ex-
pansion due to technological innovations) while
verbs are more likely to show regular processes of
change, such as drift. Such a view does not take
into account that verb numbers differ extensively
across languages, and the functional load, levels
of polysemy, and lexicalization patterns for events
also differ – points that Hamilton et al. (2016b)
showed were important in assessing likelihood of
change. Technological innovation, while excep-
tionally salient to those who work in NLP, is un-
likely to have been the same driving factor in se-
mantic change across most of human history. And
indeed, it plays a small role in the literature on
lexical replacement, where euphemism, metaphor-
ical extension, and bleaching play more important
roles.

A further type of lexical replacement involves
borrowing (Haspelmath and Tadmor, 2009). Both
borrowing and creation of words from new re-
sources involve the innovation of mappings be-
tween words and concepts within a linguistic sys-
tem. In the former, lexical material is adapted
from another language, while in the latter, it is
created from language-internal resources or inno-
vated from scratch. Languages differ in the ex-
tent to which novel word formation is utilized, and
the strategies, from compounding to acronyms to
blends, also vary greatly. Furthermore, there is
variation in the extent to which language users
borrow words (see further Bowern et al. 2011),
but there are regularities in which words are more
likely to be borrowed. Word creation has played
a role in NLP approaches to semantic change be-
cause of the focus on named entity identification,
but it is a small part of change overall.

2.2 Evolutionary semantic change
Such changes can be modeled in an evolutionary
framework. Some variation is neutral (not under
selection). For example, speakers of American
English have several distinct systems of contrast
in the meanings of the words ‘cobweb’ and ‘spi-
derweb’:2

• The two words are synonymous;

• Spiderwebs are spiral or wheel-shaped, cob-
webs are collapsed;

• Spiderwebs have spiders in them, other items
are cobwebs (including abandoned but intact
wheel webs);

• Spiderwebs have spiders, while cobwebs are
synonymous with dirt or dust bunnies (detri-
tus that is cleaned when cleaning a house).
That is, cobwebs are not necessarily old spi-
derwebs but could be from other material.

Speakers are unaware of these differences in se-
mantic distinctions, and the variants do not clearly
pattern by age, gender, or geography. Such vari-
ation is not under selection and is below the level
of consciousness. It is, however, very hard to de-
tect (not least because it is usually also invisible to
researchers).

Other selectional pressures skew change. Such
biases include (but are not limited to) meaning
transmission failure and speaker attitudes. For
example, there is a bias against using words
with novel denotations. Meaning is convention-
alized, which is what prevents English speak-
ers from calling a ‘?’ a ‘sun’. However, lan-
guage users do make creative and novel associa-
tions between objects, which do over time end up
as change. For example, several Pama-Nyungan
subgroups have words for ‘eye’ which are ety-
mologically connected to ‘seeds’ (compare Wati
and Pama-Maric languages, which have indepen-
dently shifted *kuru ‘seed’ to ‘eye’; the Yolngu
language Yan-nhanu has a single term manutji,
which means ‘eye’, ‘well’, and ‘seed’. To study
such changes, it is vital to have a good empirical
basis for the possibilities for polysemy and shift.
List et al. (2013) provides an example using trans-
lation equivalents across languages from different
families.

2The source of this observation is 4 years of polling his-
torical linguistics students at Yale.



52

Finally, words can also fall out of use. They
may be tabooed through necronym replacement or
protective euphemism, or lost when the knowledge
of the concepts they represent is also lost (such as
ethnobiological knowledge in many urban English
speakers).

In summary, semantic change can be modeled
in an evolutionary framework, where meanings
vary, have positive or negative selectional biases,
and are transmitted through language use. If a
word is not used, it is not transmitted. Such a view
provides a clue to Hamilton et al.’s findings about
polysemy and and frequency. Words are more
likely to change if they have low frequency, be-
cause speakers have less information about mean-
ing, making them more vulnerable to reinterpre-
tation or replacement (further eroding their fre-
quency). Words are also more likely to change if
they exhibit high polysemy, perhaps because they
are both more ambiguous and more likely to be
further extended.

2.3 Word embeddings

With this theoretical background, let us now turn
to an evaluation of methods. Word embeddings
(Turney and Pantel, 2010; Kulkarni et al., 2015)
are an increasingly common tool for studying
change in vocabulary over time. They rely on the
intuition that “you can know a word by the com-
pany it keeps” (Firth, 1957, 11), and by studying
the changes in word use it is possible to quantify
and further study language change.

Critiques of the effectiveness of using word em-
beddings to study change are well known. Du-
bossarsky et al. (2017) and Tahmasebi et al. (2018)
have pointed out issues that limit the utility of em-
beddings for studying change, such as the neces-
sity for large corpora, the brittleness of results, and
the lack of ability to study word senses indepen-
dently. This latter point is particularly important
for theories of meaning change, since as argued
above, understanding variation is a prerequisite to
an adequate modeling of the evolution of linguistic
systems over time.

Embeddings across massive corpora assume
that all speakers have the same knowledge of
the vocabulary of their language. That is sim-
ply not true, as illustrated by the simple example
in §2.2 above. Not all speakers/signers know all
the words of their languages. Using embeddings
across many speakers and documents also con-

flates real-world knowledge (e.g. Linnaean classi-
fication) with linguistic knowledge. For example,
I do not need to know that a koala is a member of
the genus Phascolarctos to know what a koala is,
any more than the etymology (from Daruk kula)
is part of the meaning. Yet because word em-
bedding models use encyclopedic corpora such as
Wikipedia, they tend to be skewed towards such
information.

Finally, embedding changes conflate changes in
frequency of a word with conceptual changes, fur-
ther obscuring mechanisms of change. Yao et al.
(2018) identify shifts in frequency and use this as
a diagnostic for language change. They use the
example of ‘apple’s vectorization changing over
time from being more similar to other fruit to be-
ing more similar to computer equipment and soft-
ware. However, just because apple is now more
associated in their corpus with software than with
fruit, it doesn’t entail that the meaning of the word
has actually changed over that time period. It is a
possible precursor to a change where a word goes
through a period of variation and polysemy (an A,
A∼B, B change), but that is not the only type of
change. For a similar problem, see Kulkarni et al.
(2015) on word usage time series, and for a more
nuanced view, Kutuzov et al. 2018. If we are to
study change, we can’t just abstract away from
variation in the data as “noise”. Variation leads
to change, and not all differences are changes.

3 Lexical replacement and phylogenetics

3.1 Stability and meaning

So far, I have concentrated discussion on variation
and change. However, for studying change at the
macro-level, across phylogenetic time, we require
items which have high semantic stability. Evolu-
tionary approaches to language split use lexical re-
placement to model language evolution. That is,
they take presumed stable (but nonetheless vary-
ing) meaning categories and use the variation in
the realization of those meanings to build a model
of language split, from which the phylogeny is re-
covered. Such work is now well established in
the literature on language change and the reader
is referred to Dunn (2014) and Bowern (2018) for
summaries. State of the art methods use Bayesian
inference; see Bouckaert et al. (2018) for expla-
nation and details of priors, cognate models, and
data treatment.

Such methods can be used to study semantic



53

change over a phylogeny. They are particularly
useful for studying the lexicalization of opposi-
tions within a small semantic space. For exam-
ple, Haynie and Bowern (2016) used such methods
to see how color terms changed across the Aus-
tralian family Pama-Nyungan. The visible color
spectrum is modeled as partitioned by vocabulary
(Regier et al., 2005). These partitions obey evolu-
tionary principles. There is variation (people don’t
have full agreement in the assignment of lexicon to
the visible spectrum, and color terms vary across
languages); transmission (color terms are acquired
and transmitted with other aspects of language)
and selection (there are physiological constraints
on perception (which are also variable), for exam-
ple, and visual exemplars which tend to lexical-
ize as color terms; cf. ‘orange’). Keeping the con-
ceptual space constant and varying the partitioning
avoids the problem that other types of change are
happening simultaneously. That is, we can’t study
the evolution of particular words in many domains
because the words fall out of use or are replaced
too many times across the tree.

These models require cognate evolution mod-
els. Currently, the main one is Brownian Motion
(that is, random change across a tree). Such mod-
els fit these types of change well, and allow us to
evaluate the effectiveness of such models as well
as probabilistically reconstructing ancestral states.

3.2 Lexical replacement in phylogenetics
A final illustration of evolutionary methods for
meaning change and lexical replacement concerns
a practical issue for phylogenetics: the ‘legacy
problem’ of Swadesh wordlists. Since (Swadesh,
1952, 1955), linguists have been using similar
lists of so-called ‘basic vocabulary’ to construct
cognate evolutionary matrices.3 These wordlists
are now a sample of convenience, as lexical re-
source collection has prioritized vocabulary from
Swadesh lists. Other work (McMahon and McMa-
hon, 2006) has reduced the number of comparison
items even further. Rama and Wichmann (2018)
estimate the number of items needed for small

3A ‘cognate’ is a a word which shares an evolutionary his-
tory of descent with other words. English ‘fish’ and German
‘Fisch’ are cognate, because they continue the same form-
meaning correspondence from an ancestor language. English
‘much’ and Spanish ‘mucho’ are not cognate, despite their
similarity in form, because they continue different lexical
roots. ‘Much’ continues Old English mickel (ultimately from
an Indo-European root meaning ‘big, great’, while Spanish
mucho continues Latin multus ‘much, many’, ultimately from
a root meaning ‘crumpled’.

phylogenies; however, they do not take stability
into account. Their estimate concludes approx-
imately 30 data points per language in the phy-
logeny. However, the number of such data points
varies with both the number of meaning classes
and their stability. To illustrate for 300 Pama-
Nyungan languages, the number of cognates per
meaning class in the Swadesh 200 list ranges from
40 to 199, and the number of languages with a sin-
gleton cognate in a meaning class ranges from 20
(for the second person plural pronoun) to 126 (for
translations of the concept ‘small’).

The effect of the choice of vocabulary on phy-
logeny is not well studied. Bouckaert et al. (2018)
point out that the difference between Bowern and
Atkinson (2012) and their phylogeny includes ad-
ditional words; using an additional 20 vocabu-
lary items changed the classification of some lan-
guages to be more in line with established sub-
grouping based on grammatical features. We
know that loan rates affect suitability for phylo-
genetic inference, and that loan rates in basic vo-
cabulary vary. We are left with Swadesh lists be-
ing the default instrument for inference, yet they
are based on a list whose membership was deter-
mined by, to put it bluntly, one person’s sugges-
tion of what might be useful to diagnose remote
relationships 70 years ago, not on a principled de-
cision of stability in meaning classes.

Many factors contribute to go into making a
meaning class a good or poor choice for phylo-
genetics. If the meaning class is too stable, there



54

is not sufficient variation to recover and date phy-
logenetic splits. If a word is widely loaned, that
will make the evolutionary history harder to un-
cover and reduce phylogenetic signal. If an item
changes too fast, or there are too many singleton
reflexes, there is less informative signal higher in
the tree. Homoplasy (convergent evolution) is also
problematic, as it it difficult to detect and can lead
to false language groupings. In order to evalu-
ate the suitability of individual meaning classes, I
coded cognate sets in the material used in Bouck-
aert et al. (2018) and Bowern et al. (2011) for
number of loan events, informativeness of phy-
logenetic signal (D statistic; see Fritz and Purvis
2010), number of singletons, amount of missing
data, and mean and maximum meaning class size
(that is, how many languages attest a particular
cognate in that meaning class). Figure 3 plots the
first two PCA and clusters meaning classes based
on these variables, using the fviz cluster() function
in the Factoextra package in R (Kassambara and
Mundt, 2017). The largest factor contributing to
dimension 1 is how much data is missing, while
dimension 2’s largest contribution is the number
of singleton cognates per meaning class. Meaning
classes which score relatively highly on dimension
1 and relatively low on dimension 2 are most likely
to be optimal for phylogenetic analysis. However,
items solely taken from the southeast quadrant are
the most stable, and therefore likely to lead to un-
derestimates of splits.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion, evolutionary approaches to lan-
guage change provide explicit ways of modeling
semantic shifts and lexical replacement. They pro-
vide researchers with a structure for examining the
facts of language differences, the mode and tempo
of language change, and a way of framing ques-
tions to lead to an understanding of why languages
change the way they do. In all this, however, vari-
ation is key – it provides the seeds of change, al-
lows the identification of change in progress, and
the absence of variation makes it possible to study
stability and shift across millennia.
