Abstract

Statistical machine translation (SMT) suf-
fers from various problems which are ex-
acerbated where training data is in short
supply. In this paper we address the data
sparsity problem in the Farsi (Persian) lan-
guage and introduce a new parallel cor-
pus, TEP++. Compared to previous re-
sults the new dataset is more efficient for
Farsi SMT engines and yields better out-
put. In our experiments using TEP++ as
bilingual training data and BLEU as a met-
ric, we achieved improvements of +11.17
(60%) and +7.76 (63.92%) in the Farsi–
English and English–Farsi directions, re-
spectively. Furthermore we describe an
engine (SF2FF) to translate between for-
mal and informal Farsi which in terms of
syntax and terminology can be seen as
different languages. The SF2FF engine
also works as an intelligent normalizer for
Farsi texts. To demonstrate its use, SF2FF
was used to clean the IWSLT–2013 dataset
to produce normalized data, which gave
improvements in translation quality over
FBK’s Farsi engine when used as training
data.

1 Introduction

In SMT (Koehn et al., 2003), where the bilingual
knowledge comes from parallel corpora, having
large datasets is crucial. This issue is compounded
when working with low-resource languages, such
as Farsi. The poor performance of existing systems

for the Farsi–English pair confirms the necessity
of developing a large and representative dataset.
Clearly all the existing problems do not originate
solely from the data, but not having a reliable train-
ing set prevents us from investigating Farsi SMT to
the best extent possible.

Generating datasets is a time-consuming and
expensive process, especially for SMT, in which
massive amount of aligned bilingual sentences are
required. Accordingly instead of starting from
scratch we enriched and refined the existing corpus
TEP (Pilevar et al., 2011).1 Despite having a larger
alternative (the Mizan2 corpus), TEP was selected
as the basis of our work that we clarify further in
Section 3 and 4.1. TEP is a collection of film subti-
tles in spoken/informal Farsi (SF) that have distinct
structures from formal/journalistic Farsi (FF). Ac-
cordingly, training an MT engine using this type
of data might provide unsatisfactory results when
working with FF which is the dominant language
of Farsi texts. For this reason TEP was firstly re-
fined both manually and automatically, which Sec-
tion 3 explains in detail. TEP++ is the refined ver-
sion of TEP that is much closer to FF and con-
siderably cleaner. Using both TEP and TEP++ we
trained several engines for bidirectional translation
of the Farsi–English pair, as well as an engine to
translate between FF and SF (SF2FF). The next
sections explain the challenges of dealing with SF
and describe the data preparation process in detail.
The structure of paper is as follows. Section 2 dis-
cusses background of MT, addressing existing sys-
tems (§2.1) and available corpora (§2.2). Section
3 explains TEP++ and our development process.
Experimental results are reported in Section 4 in-

cluding a comparison of the various MT systems
and a study of the impact of SF2FF in Farsi SMT.
Finally the last section concludes the paper along
with some avenues for future works.

2 Background

Building an SMT engine for Farsi is difficult due
to its rich morphology and inconsistent orthogra-
phy (Rasooli et al., 2013). Not only these chal-
lenges but also the complex syntax and several ex-
ceptional rules in the grammar make the process
considerably complex. The lack of data is another
obstacle in this field. Nevertheless there have been
some previous attempts at Farsi SMT. In this sec-
tion we briefly review previous works encompass-
ing systems in the first section, as well as available
resources in the second section.

2.1 Farsi MT Systems
There are a limited number of SMT systems for
Farsi. Some instances translate in one direction
and some others are working bidirectionally. The
Pars translator3 is a commercial rule-based engine
for English–Farsi translation. It contains 1.5 mil-
lion words in its database and includes specific dic-
tionaries for 33 different fields of science. Another
English–Farsi MT system was developed by the
Iran Supreme Council of Information.4 Postchi5 is
a bidirectional system listed among the EuroMa-
trix6 systems for the Farsi language. These sys-
tems are not terribly robust or precise examples of
Farsi SMT and are usually the by-products of re-
search or commercial projects. The only system
that has officially been reported for the purpose of
Farsi SMT is FBK’s system (Bertoldi et al., 2013).
It was tested on a publicly available dataset and
from this viewpoint is the most important system
for our purposes.7

2.2 Parallel Corpora for Farsi SMT
The first attempts at generating Farsi–English par-
allel corpora are documented in the Shiraz project
(Zajac et al., 2000). The authors constructed a cor-
pus of 3000 parallel sentences, which were trans-
lated manually from monolingual online Farsi doc-

5http://www.postchi.com/
6http://matrix.statmt.org/resources/pair?l1=fa&l2=en#pair
7However other Farsi MT engines like the Shiraz system
(Amtrup et al., 2000) or that of Mohaghegh (2012) use their
own in-house datasets. As we are not able to replicate them
we do not include them in our comparisons.

uments at New Mexico State University. More
recently Qasemizadeh et al. (2007) participated
in the Farsi part of MULTEXT-EAST8 project
(Erjavec, 2010) and developed about 6000 sen-
tences. There is also a corpus available in ELRA9

consisting of about 3,500,000 English and Farsi
words aligned at sentence level (about 100,000
sentences). This is a mixed domain dataset in-
cluding a variety of text types such as art, law,
culture, literature, poetry, proverbs, religion etc.
PEN (Parallel English–Persian News corpus) is
another small corpus (Farajian, 2011) generated
semi-automatically. It includes almost 30,000 sen-
tences. Farajian developed a method to find sim-
ilar sentence pairs and for quality assurance used
Google Translate.10 All these corpora are rela-
tively small-scale datasets. However, there are
two other large-scale collections, namely Mizan
and TEP, that are more interesting for our pur-
poses. Mizan is a bilingual Farsi–English cor-
pus of more than one million aligned sentences,
which was developed by the Dadegan research
group.11 Sentences are gathered from classical lit-
erature with an average length of 15 words each.
Despite comprising a large amount of sentences,
the results obtained from using Mizan as a train-
ing set are less satisfactory. We will discuss the
structure of Mizan and analyse some translation
errors that ensue in the next section. The final
corpus that is the basis of our work is TEP (Pil-
evar et al., 2011), which consists of more than
600,000 aligned Farsi–English sentences gathered
from film subtitles. Experimental results show that
TEP works better than Mizan as a training corpus
for SMT.

3 TEP++

TEP++ is a refined version of TEP. TEP is a quite
noisy corpus and it triggers several failures in the
Farsi SMT pipeline. Besides the problem of noise
because it was gathered from film subtitles, it is in
SF. Accordingly it would be inappropriate to use
an SMT system trained on SF data for the trans-
lation of FF. Unfortunately discrepancies between
formal and informal Farsi structures are quite con-

siderable. In what follows we show some of these
cases and try to illustrate the main challenges with
refinements to TEP.

In terms of orthography, Farsi is one of the hard-
est languages. It is written with the Perso-Arabic
script. Unlike Arabic, some Persian words have
inter-word zero-width non-joiner spaces (or semi-
spaces) (Rasooli et al., 2013). Usually semi-spaces
are incorrectly written as regular space charac-
ter (U+0020 and U+200c are the Unicode for
space and semi-space, respectively) that can easily
change the meaning of the constituent and even the
syntax of the whole sentence. As an example the
right form of the word greedy is �� ��� �������

�
�≡ /āstin-

derāz/12 with a semi-space character (between n
sound and d sound). If it is written with a space
as in �� ��� �������

�
� ≡ /āstin e derāz/, it means long

sleeve, a completely different meaning which will
mislead the SMT engine. Another problem is the
presence of multiple writing forms for some char-
acters. For the character � ≡ /y/ all forms of �,
�� and �� are common. This inconsistent writing
style exists similarly for several other characters.
The diacritic problem is another issue. Words can
appear both with and without diacritics, like

�
���� ���

or ���� ��� ≡ /axiran/ (recently). Clearly, these prob-
lems should be resolved in preprocessing.

In addition, SF has its own specific problems,
one being lexical variation. Some words oc-
cur in SF texts that do not have any counter-
part in FF e.g. ����� ≡ /eyval/ (good job). Syn-
tax in SF is also a problem. Farsi is an SOV
language but in SF, versions of sentences with
SVO and VOS order are both common. For ex-
ample, �������� �� ��� �� ��� ≡ /æli nāme ro bex-
oun/ (Ali, read the letter) is a standard SOV sen-
tence, but both VOS (��� �� ��� �� ��������) and SVO
(�� ��� �� �������� ���) forms are very normal; even
in SF these look more natural than the SOV vari-
ant. In TEP++, we tried to correct the order and
syntax of the sentences as much as possible which
was very challenging. Not only the order but also
the internal constituents of the sentences had to
be changed. For example the verb �������� ≡ /bex-
oun/ (read) in SF is ��������� ≡ /bexān/ in FF or ��

�
�

12We used Wikipedia phonetic chart to show the spellings of
Farsi words and - character to show the semi-space.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian phonology

≡ /āmad/ (came) is the formal version of ���� ≡
/oumad/. These types of changes do not just hap-
pen to verbs. Other cases are even worse, e.g
the right form of ”for them” in FF is �� ��

�
� �����

≡ /barāye ānhā/ which is written as ��� ������ ≡
/barāšoun/ in SF (two FF words are packed in a
single SF word). SF suffers from word ambigu-
ity problem as well. A word like ��� ≡ /to/ (you)
which in formal texts is translated only into ”you”
(3rd-singular person), can mean both ”you” (1st

and 3rd-singular person) and ”inside” in SF.
Problems with SF are not limited to those dis-

cussed. However as a solution we cleaned the
TEP data both automatically and manually. As
a mandatory prerequisite of the refinement phase
we applied knowledge of Farsi linguistics and
developed a rule-based system for some of the
cases. The rule-based system includes 17 general
rules/templates. For the remainder a team of 20
native speaker of Farsi, manually edited the cor-
pus. The result is TEP++ with 578,251 aligned
sentences, with an average length of 7 for the En-
glish side and 9 for Farsi. It includes 4,963,693 En-
glish tokens (62,185 unique tokens) and 5,065,434
Farsi tokens (122,432 unique tokens). TEP++ cov-
ers 94% of the TEP and we neglected the remain-
ing 6% because of the bad quality of the original
TEP data.

4 Experiments

This section is divided into 3 subsections. The
first part reports the BLEU scores for three main
Farsi corpora, Mizan, TEP and TEP++. We also
discuss the problems with Mizan in Section 4.1
and perform error analysis on the output transla-
tions, where it is used as the SMT training data. In
the second part using TEP and TEP++ we carry
out monolingual translation between SF and FF
(SF2FF) and discuss some use-cases for this type
of translation task. Finally in the last part we show
how SF2FF boosts the SMT quality for Farsi and
report our results on the IWSLT–2013 dataset pro-
viding a comparison with FBK’s system.

4.1 Mizan, TEP and TEP++

To test the performance of our engines, they were
trained using Mizan, TEP and TEP++. We used
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) with the default con-
figuration for phrase-based translation. For the
language modeling, SRILM (Stolcke and others,

84



2002) was used. The evaluation measure is BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002) and to tune the models, we
applied MERT (Och, 2003). Table 1 summarizes
our experimental results for the Mizan dataset. We
evaluated with two types of language models, 3-
gram (LM3) and 5-gram (LM5). Numbers for both
before and after tuning are reported. For all ex-
periments training, tuning and test sets were se-
lected randomly from the main corpus. The size
of the test set is 1,000 and the tuning set is 2000
sentences. Training set sizes are reported in ta-
bles. For all experiments BLEU scores for Google
Translate are reported as a baseline.

Table 1: Experimental Results for Mizan

From a system that is trained on almost 1M sen-
tences, we might expect better performance. To
try to gain some insight into the nature of the prob-
lem, we randomly selected 100 Farsi translations
and compared them with the reference sentences.
Based on the statistics of the error analysis for the
subset of 100 translations, 3 main reasons of the
failures present themselves:

1. In more than half of the cases (59%) the de-
coder does not find the correct translation of a
given word. Wrong lexical choice is the most
common problem for the translation.

2. Due to the rich morphology of Farsi 41% of
the words are generally translated with slight
errors in their forms. The problem, therefore,
is wrong word formation on the target side
(Farsi). To give an example translating verbs
into the wrong tense or with the wrong af-
fixes.

3. 33% of the constituents have reordering prob-
lems. Some times the translations are correct
but are not in their right positions.

Such deficiencies do not only apply for Mizan;
they are common in Farsi SMT (and SMT in gen-
eral even), no matter what training data is. Study-

ing the results of translation error analysis, Farzi
and Faili (2015) confirm our findings.

Another issue which should be considered about
the Farsi SMT evaluation is that Farsi is a free
word-order language. When compiling the results
of our experiments, we only had a single refer-
ence available against which the output from our
various systems could be compared. Computing
automatic evaluation scores when translating into
a free word-order language in the single-reference
scenario is somewhat arbitrary. We would expect a
manual evaluation on a subset of sentences to con-
firm that the output translations are somewhat bet-
ter than the automatic evaluation scores suggest.

Similar to Mizan we repeated the same experi-
ments for the TEP and TEP++. Table 2 and Table 3
show the results of these related experiments. Two
engines were trained using the TEP and TEP++
corpora. In order to provide a comparison between
the two corpora used, tuning and test sets were se-
lected in a way which mirror each other in both
datasets, i.e. TEP sentences and their counterparts
in TEP++.

13The best performance using TEP for FA–EN is 18.57, the
best for TEP++ is 29.74 and the improvement of FA–EN di-
rection is 60%

85



Another achievement is that even where using less
data, the TEP++ engine performs better. TEP++
includes 94% of the TEP (§3) so even with about
33K fewer sentences pairs in the training set we
obtained better results. The BLEU scores of
TEP++ still are significantly better than the base-
line (TEP) considering the results of paired boot-
strap resampling (Koehn, 2004).14

This improvement is not odd and we were ex-
pecting such numbers. As it was studied in Rasooli
at al. (2013) and Bertoldi et al. (2013) preprocess-
ing and normalization have a considerable effect
in Farsi SMT, as we explained in §3. Results from
Google Translate is another confirmation to this is-
sue. SF (the language of TEP) is an almost un-
known language for Google Translate hence trans-
lation from/into this language will provide inap-
propriate results. Results are slightly better for
TEP++ because the sentences are cleaner and more
formal which are close to that of Google Translate.
Finally it should be mentioned that Moses gener-
ally works much better than Google Translate for
Farsi MT and the quality of Google Translate sig-
nificantly decreases for long sentences.

4.2 SF2FF Results
Doing the refinements on TEP to produce TEP++
that as explained in §3, was very laborious. The
by-product was a pair of corpora, one in SF and
one in FF. We trained a phrase-based translation
engine using these corpora in order to translate
from SF into FF. The benefit of having such an en-
gine is to produce the cleaned FF for free, as the
TEP refinement was a costly process. Moreover,
having a knowledge of Farsi linguistics was a pre-
requisite. This engine provides the same function-
ality with less cost and without applying linguistic
knowledge. The trained engine works like a black
box and carries out all the refinements. Similar
to ours, Fancellu et al. (2014) have also worked
on monolingual SMT between Brazilian and Eu-
ropean Portuguese.

In the SF–FF direction we obtained 88.94
BLEU points and in the opposite direction sys-
tems works with BLEU score of 81.62. This pro-
cess –more than an MT task– is a transformation
in which words are converted into the normal-
ized/correct forms and the order of constituents are
changed in some cases. Accordingly BLEU num-

cance testing for 1000 samples with 0.05 parameter

bers are high. SF2FF engine helps us to stablish
a fully automated pipeline to make a large-scale
bilingual Farsi corpus. Any type of data can be
taken from the internet such as film subtitles or
tweets that are usually noisy with informal writing
conventions. SF2FF can normalize them. and the
normalized version is good enough to be aligned
with the English side (or any other language).
To show the application of SF2FF and its perfor-
mance, it was fed a test set from TEP (the same
dataset we used in the TEP experiment). The data
was normalized by SF2FF. Normalization helps to
provide a more precise translation. The pipeline
is illustrated in Figure 1. Selected sentences are
in SF and the BLEU score for their translation by
TEP is 18.57. If SF2FF translates them into FF
they would be cleaner and much closer to the lan-
guage of TEP++ and consequently the results of
SMT would be better. Sentences in the two sets
are counterpart of each other. The TEP++ en-
gine obtains a BLEU score of 29.72 on the for-
mal/clean version of the same sentences. If the
noisy data is cleaned by SF2FF and is then trans-
lated by TEP++, the BLEU score rises to 25.36, i.e.
SF2FF provides +6.79-point improvement. The
BLEU score obtained the normalized data is sig-
nificantly better and is 36% higher than that of the
original data which demonstrates the efficiency of
SF2FF.

4.3 Comparison of SMT Performance

The only system that has been tested on a standard
dataset and published is FBK’s Farsi translation
engine. It was reported in Bertoldi et al. (2013)
and tested on the IWSLT–2013 dataset. The data
has been made available by (Cettolo et al., 2012)
and includes TED talk translations. In their paper,

86



the FBK team explained that Farsi online data (in-
cluding the IWSLT–2013 dataset) is very noisy and
using requires some preprocessing, so they tried
to normalize the data. Therefore, for the transla-
tion task, they used a normalized version of the
IWSLT–2013 dataset along with an in-house cor-
pus for language modeling. They also mentioned
that using existing Farsi corpora such as TEP does
not enhance translation quality. To compare our
engines with FBK’s system we firstly normalized
the same dataset with SF2FF engine, and to make
the language model we used the TEP++ corpus.
The results for baseline,15 FBK’s system and ours
(DCU) are shown in Table 4. For the FA–EN di-

rection FBK obtained +2.0 points (16%) improve-
ment in BLEU score, while for the same direction
our improvement is +3.74 (29%). For the opposite
direction we also outperform FBK, with a +1.10
difference in BLEU. The BLEU score for the EN–
FA direction by DCU is 11.42, 2.29 points higher
than the baseline (25%).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First
we developed a new corpus namely TEP++ and
trained a translation engine. We showed that
TEP++ works better than its predecessor TEP. Sec-
ond we developed an engine to translate between
FF and SF. SF2FF works like an intelligent prepro-
cessor/normalizer and translates SF into FF that is
a big credit for Farsi SMT. Finally we obtained bet-
ter results in comparison to other reported results
so far.

At the moment, in Farsi SMT data scarcity is
the main challenge despite the fact that large vol-
umes of textual data is available via the internet.
Stored data on the internet for Farsi is in most cases
are very noisy and also appears in SF forms. Our
SF2FF engine can help to clean the internet data
to generate reliable Farsi corpora. In the next step
by normalizing existing Farsi corpora and aggre-
gating them we will release a large-scale, reliable
dataset for Farsi SMT. TEP++ also will be publicly
available shortly. We also intended to carry out a
15https://wit3.fbk.eu/score.php?release=2013-01

human evaluation to investigate the correlation be-
tween the automatic score and manual findings.
