Abstract

Attention in neural machine translation
provides the possibility to encode relevant
parts of the source sentence at each trans-
lation step. As a result, attention is con-
sidered to be an alignment model as well.
However, there is no work that specifically
studies attention and provides analysis of
what is being learned by attention mod-
els. Thus, the question still remains that
how attention is similar or different from
the traditional alignment. In this paper, we
provide detailed analysis of attention and
compare it to traditional alignment. We
answer the question of whether attention
is only capable of modelling translational
equivalent or it captures more information.
We show that attention is different from
alignment in some cases and is capturing
useful information other than alignments.

1 Introduction

Neural machine translation (NMT) has gained a
lot of attention recently due to its substantial im-
provements in machine translation quality achiev-
ing state-of-the-art performance for several lan-
guages (Luong et al., 2015b; Jean et al., 2015;
Wu et al., 2016). The core architecture of neural
machine translation models is based on the gen-
eral encoder-decoder approach (Sutskever et al.,
2014). Neural machine translation is an end-to-
end approach that learns to encode source sen-
tences into distributed representations and decode
these representations into sentences in the target
language. Among the different neural MT models,
attentional NMT (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong
et al., 2015a) has become popular due to its capa-
bility to use the most relevant parts of the source
sentence at each translation step. This capability

also makes the attentional model superior in trans-
lating longer sentences (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Lu-
ong et al., 2015a).

Figure 1: Visualization of the attention paid to the
relevant parts of the source sentence for each gen-
erated word of a translation example. See how
the attention is ‘smeared out’ over multiple source
words in the case of “would” and “like”.

Figure 1 shows an example of how attention
uses the most relevant source words to generate
a target word at each step of the translation. In
this paper we focus on studying the relevance of
the attended parts, especially cases where atten-
tion is ‘smeared out’ over multiple source words
where their relevance is not entirely obvious, see,
e.g., “would” and “like” in Figure 1. Here, we
ask whether these are due to errors of the attention
mechanism or are a desired behavior of the model.

Since the introduction of attention models in
neural machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015)
various modifications have been proposed (Lu-
ong et al., 2015a; Cohn et al., 2016; Liu et al.,
2016). However, to the best of our knowledge

30



there is no study that provides an analysis of what
kind of phenomena is being captured by atten-
tion. There are some works that have looked to
attention as being similar to traditional word align-
ment (Alkhouli et al., 2016; Cohn et al., 2016;
Liu et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016). Some of
these approaches also experimented with train-
ing the attention model using traditional align-
ments (Alkhouli et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Chen
et al., 2016). Liu et al. (2016) have shown that at-
tention could be seen as a reordering model as well
as an alignment model.

In this paper, we focus on investigating the
differences between attention and alignment and
what is being captured by the attention mechanism
in general. The questions that we are aiming to
answer include: Is the attention model only capa-
ble of modelling alignment? And how similar is
attention to alignment in different syntactic phe-
nomena?

Our analysis shows that attention models tradi-
tional alignment in some cases more closely while
it captures information beyond alignment in oth-
ers. For instance, attention agrees with traditional
alignments to a high degree in the case of nouns.
However, it captures other information rather than
only the translational equivalent in the case of
verbs.

This paper makes the following contributions:
1) We provide a detailed comparison of attention
in NMT and word alignment. 2) We show that
while different attention mechanisms can lead to
different degrees of compliance with respect to
word alignments, global compliance is not always
helpful for word prediction. 3) We show that at-
tention follows different patterns depending on the
type of the word being generated. 4) We demon-
strate that attention does not always comply with
alignment. We provide evidence showing that the
difference between attention and alignment is due
to attention model capability to attend the context
words influencing the current word translation.

2 Related Work

Liu et al. (2016) investigate how training the at-
tention model in a supervised manner can bene-
fit machine translation quality. To this end they
use traditional alignments obtained by running au-
tomatic alignment tools (GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003) and fast align (Dyer et al., 2013)) on the
training data and feed it as ground truth to the

attention network. They report some improve-
ments in translation quality arguing that the atten-
tion model has learned to better align source and
target words. The approach of training attention
using traditional alignments has also been pro-
posed by others (Chen et al., 2016; Alkhouli et al.,
2016). Chen et al. (2016) show that guided atten-
tion with traditional alignment helps in the domain
of e-commerce data which includes lots of out of
vocabulary (OOV) product names and placehold-
ers, but not much in the other domains. Alkhouli
et al. (2016) have separated the alignment model
and translation model, reasoning that this avoids
propagation of errors from one model to the other
as well as providing more flexibility in the model
types and training of the models. They use a
feed-forward neural network as their alignment
model that learns to model jumps in the source
side using HMM/IBM alignments obtained by us-
ing GIZA++.

Shi et al. (2016) show that various kinds of syn-
tactic information are being learned and encoded
in the output hidden states of the encoder. The
neural system for their experimental analysis is
not an attentional model and they argue that at-
tention does not have any impact for learning syn-
tactic information. However, performing the same
analysis for morphological information, Belinkov
et al. (2017) show that attention has also some ef-
fect on the information that the encoder of neural
machine translation system encodes in its output
hidden states. As part of their analysis they show
that a neural machine translation system that has
an attention model can learn the POS tags of the
source side more efficiently than a system without
attention.

Recently, Koehn and Knowles (2017) carried
out a brief analysis of how much attention and
alignment match in different languages by mea-
suring the probability mass that attention gives to
alignments obtained from an automatic alignment
tool. They also report differences based on the
most attended words.

The mixed results reported by Chen et al.
(2016); Alkhouli et al. (2016); Liu et al. (2016)
on optimizing attention with respect to alignments
motivates a more thorough analysis of attention
models in NMT.

3 Attention Models

This section provides a short background on at-
tention and discusses two most popular attention
models which are also used in this paper. The first
model is a non-recurrent attention model which is
equivalent to the “global attention” method pro-
posed by Luong et al. (2015a). The second at-
tention model that we use in our investigation is
an input-feeding model similar to the attention
model first proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015)
and turned to a more general one and called input-
feeding by Luong et al. (2015a). Below we de-
scribe the details of both models.

Both non-recurrent and input-feeding models
compute a context vector ci at each time step. Sub-
sequently, they concatenate the context vector to
the hidden state of decoder and pass it through a
non-linearity before it is fed into the softmax out-
put layer of the translation network.

h̃t = tanh(Wc[ct;h′t]) (1)

The difference of the two models lays in the
way they compute the context vector. In the non-
recurrent model, the hidden state of the decoder is
compared to each hidden state of the encoder. Of-
ten, this comparison is realized as the dot product
of vectors. Then the comparison result is fed to a
softmax layer to compute the attention weight.

et,i = hTi h
′
t (2)

αt,i =
exp(et,i)∑|x|

j=1 exp(et,j)
(3)

Here h′t is the hidden state of the decoder at time
t, hi is ith hidden state of the encoder and |x| is the
length of the source sentence. Then the computed
alignment weights are used to compute a weighted
sum over the encoder hidden states which results
in the context vector mentioned above:

ci =
|x|∑
i=1

αt,ihi (4)

The input-feeding model changes the context
vector computation in a way that at each step t the
context vector is aware of the previously computed
context ct−1. To this end, the input-feeding model
feeds back its own h̃t−1 to the network and uses
the resulting hidden state instead of the context-
independent h′t, to compare to the hidden states of

the encoder. This is defined in the following equa-
tions:

h′′t = f(W [h̃t−1; yt−1]) (5)

et,i = hTi h
′′
t (6)

Here, f is the function that the stacked LSTM
applies to the input, yt−1 is the last generated tar-
get word, and h̃t−1 is the output of previous time
step of the input-feeding network itself, meaning
the output of Equation 1 in the case that context
vector has been computed using et,i from Equa-
tion 6.

4 Comparing Attention with Alignment

As mentioned above, it is a commonly held as-
sumption that attention corresponds to word align-
ments. To verify this, we investigate whether
higher consistency between attention and align-
ment leads to better translations.

4.1 Measuring Attention-Alignment
Accuracy

In order to compare attentions of multiple systems
as well as to measure the difference between at-
tention and word alignment, we convert the hard
word alignments into soft ones and use cross en-
tropy between attention and soft alignment as a
loss function. For this purpose, we use manual
alignments provided by RWTH German-English
dataset as the hard alignments. The statistics of
the data are given in Table 1. We convert the hard
alignments to soft alignments using Equation 7.
For unaligned words, we first assume that they
have been aligned to all the words in the source
side and then do the conversion.

Al(xi, yt) =

{
1
|Ayt | if xi ∈ Ayt
0 otherwise

(7)

Here Ayt is the set of source words aligned to
target word yt and |Ayt | is the number of source
words in the set.

32



After conversion of the hard alignments to soft
ones, we compute the attention loss as follows:

LAt(yt) = −
|x|∑
i=1

Al(xi, yt) log(At(xi, yt)) (8)

Here x is the source sentence and Al(xi, yt) is
the weight of the alignment link between source
word xi and the target word (see Equation 7).
At(xi, yt) is the attention weight αt,i (see Equa-
tion 3) of the source word xi, when generating the
target word yt .

In our analysis, we also look into the relation
between translation quality and the quality of the
attention with respect to the alignments. For mea-
suring the quality of attention, we use the atten-
tion loss defined in Equation 8. As a measure of
translation quality, we choose the loss between the
output of our NMT system and the reference trans-
lation at each translation step, which we call word
prediction loss. The word prediction loss for word
yt is logarithm of the probability given in Equa-
tion 9.

pnmt(yt | y<t, x) = softmax(Woh̃t) (9)

Here x is the source sentence, yt is target word
at time step t, y<t is the target history given by the
reference translation and h̃t is given by Equation 1
for either non-recurrent or input-feeding attention
models.

Spearman’s rank correlation is used to compute
the correlation between attention loss and word
prediction loss:

ρ =
Cov(RLAt , RLWP )
σRLAtσRLWP

(10)

where RLAt and RLWP are the ranks of the at-
tention losses and word prediction losses, respec-
tively, Cov is the covariance between two input
variables, and σRLAt and σRLWP are the standard
deviations of RLAt and RLWP .

If there is a close relationship between word
prediction quality and consistency of attention ver-
sus alignment, then there should be high correla-
tion between word prediction loss and attention
loss. Figure 2 shows an example with differ-
ent levels of consistency between attention and
word alignments. For the target words “will”
and “come” the attention is not focused on the

Figure 2: An example of inconsistent attention
and alignment. The outlined cells show the man-
ual alignments from the RWTH dataset (see Ta-
ble 1). See how attention is deviated from align-
ment points in the case of “will” and “come”.

manually aligned word but distributed between
the aligned word and other words. The focus
of this paper is examining cases where attention
does not follow alignment, answering the ques-
tions whether those cases represent errors or de-
sirable behavior of the attention model.

4.2 Measuring Attention Concentration

As another informative variable in our analysis,
we look into the attention concentration. While
most word alignments only involve one or a few
words, attention can be distributed more freely.
We measure the concentration of attention by
computing the entropy of the attention distribu-
tion:

EAt(yt) = −
|x|∑
i=1

At(xi, yt) log(At(xi, yt))

(11)

5 Empirical Analysis of Attention
Behaviour

We conduct our analysis using the two different
attention models described in Section 3. Our first
attention model is the global model without input-
feeding as introduced by Luong et al. (2015a). The
second model is the input-feeding model (Luong
et al., 2015a), which uses recurrent attention. Our

system as described in (Luong et al., 2015a), using
4 recurrent layers.

We trained the systems with dimension size of
1,000 and batch size of 80 for 20 epochs. The vo-
cabulary for both source and target side is set to be
the 30K most common words. The learning rate
is set to be 1 and a maximum gradient norm of 5
has been used. We also use a dropout rate of 0.3
to avoid overfitting.

5.1 Impact of Attention Mechanism

We train both of the systems on the WMT15
German-to-English training data, see Table 3 for
some statistics. Table 2 shows the BLEU scores
(Papineni et al., 2002) for both systems on differ-
ent test sets.

Since we use POS tags and dependency roles in
our analysis, both of which are based on words,
we chose not to use BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016)
which operates at the sub-word level.

the systems with input-feeding and non-recurrent
attention models. We use the most attended source
word for each target word as the aligned word. The
last column shows the AER for the alignment gen-
erated by GIZA++.

We report alignment error rate (AER) (Och and
Ney, 2000), which is commonly used to measure
alignment quality, in Table 4 to show the differ-
ence between attentions and human alignments
provided by RWTH German-English dataset. To
compute AER over attentions, we follow Luong

et al. (2015a) to produce hard alignments from
attentions by choosing the most attended source
word for each target word. We also use GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003) to produce automatic align-
ments over the data set to allow for a comparison
between automatically generated alignments and
the attentions generated by our systems. GIZA++
is run in both directions and alignments are sym-
metrized using the grow-diag-final-and refined
alignment heuristic.

As shown in Table 4, the input-feeding system
not only achieves a higher BLEU score, but also
uses attentions that are closer to the human align-
ments.

Table 5 compares input-feeding and non-
recurrent attention in terms of attention loss com-
puted using Equation 8. Here the losses between
the attention produced by each system and the hu-
man alignments is reported. As expected, the dif-
ference in attention losses are in line with AER.

The difference between these comparisons is
that AER only takes the most attended word into
account while attention loss considers the entire
attention distribution.

5.2 Alignment Quality Impact on Translation

Based on the results in Section 5.1, one might be
inclined to conclude that the closer the attention is
to the word alignments the better the translation.
However, Chen et al. (2016); Liu et al. (2016);
Alkhouli et al. (2016) report mixed results by op-
timizing their NMT system with respect to word
prediction and alignment quality. These findings
warrant a more fine-grained analysis of attention.
To this end, we include POS tags in our analysis
and study the patterns of attention based on POS
tags of the target words. We choose POS tags be-

cause they exhibit some simple syntactic charac-
teristics. We use the coarse grained universal POS
tags (Petrov et al., 2012) given in Table 6.

To better understand how attention accuracy af-
fects translation quality, we analyse the relation-
ship between attention loss and word prediction
loss for individual part-of-speech classes. Fig-
ure 3a shows how attention loss differs when gen-
erating different POS tags. One can see that atten-
tion loss varies substantially across different POS
tags. In particular, we focus on the cases of NOUN
and VERB which are the most frequent POS tags
in the dataset. As shown, the attention of NOUN
is the closest to alignments on average. But the av-
erage attention loss for VERB is almost two times
larger than the loss for NOUN.

Considering this difference and the observations
in Section 5.1, a natural follow-up would be to fo-
cus on getting the attention of verbs to be closer

to alignments. However, Figure 3b shows that the
average word prediction loss for verbs is actually
smaller compared to the loss for nouns. In other
words, although the attention for verbs is substan-
tially more inconsistent with the word alignments
than for nouns, the NMT system translates verbs
more accurately than nouns on average.

Figure 4: Correlation between word prediction
loss and attention loss for the input-feeding model.

To formalize this relationship we compute
Spearman’s rank correlation between word predic-
tion loss and attention loss, based on the POS tags
of the target side, for the input-feeding model, see
Figure 4.

The low correlation for verbs confirms that at-
tention to other parts of source sentence rather
than the aligned word is necessary for translating
verbs and that attention does not necessarily have
to follow alignments. However, the higher correla-

tion for nouns means that consistency of attention
with alignments is more desirable. This could, in a
way, explain the mixed result reported for training
attention using alignments (Chen et al., 2016; Liu
et al., 2016; Alkhouli et al., 2016). Especially the
results by Chen et al. (2016) in which large im-
provements are achieved for the e-commerce do-
main which contains many OOV product names
and placeholders, but no or very weak improve-
ments were achieved over common domains.

5.3 Attention Concentration

In word alignment, most target words are aligned
to one source word. The average number of source
words aligned to nouns and verbs is 1.1 and 1.2 re-
spectively. To investigate to what extent this also
holds for attention we measure the attention con-
centration by computing the entropy of the atten-
tion distribution, see Equation 11.

Figure 5a shows the average entropy of atten-
tion based on POS tags. As shown, nouns have one
of the lowest entropies meaning that on average
the attention for nouns tends to be concentrated.
This also explains the closeness of the attention
to alignments for nouns. In addition, the correla-
tion between attention entropy and attention loss
in case of nouns is high as shown in Figure 5b.
This means that attention entropy can be used as a
measure of closeness of attention to alignment in
the case of nouns.

The higher attention entropy for verbs, in Fig-
ure 5a, shows that the attention is more distributed
compared to nouns. The low correlation between
attention entropy and word prediction loss (see

Figure 6) shows that attention concentration is not
required when translating into verbs. This also
confirms that the correct translation of verbs re-
quires the systems to pay attention to different
parts of the source sentence.

Figure 6: Correlation of attention entropy and
word prediction loss for the input-feeding system.

Another interesting observation here is the low
correlation for pronouns (PRON) and particles
(PRT), see Figure 6. As can be seen in Figure 5a,
these tags have more distributed attention compar-
ing to nouns, for example. This could either mean
that the attention model does not know where to
focus or it deliberately pays attention to multiple,
somehow relevant, places to be able to produce a
better translation. The latter is supported by the
relatively low word prediction losses, shown in the
Figure 3b.

5.4 Attention Distribution

To further understand under which conditions at-
tention is paid to words other than the aligned
words, we study the distribution of attention over
the source words. First, we measure how much at-
tention is paid to the aligned words for each POS
tag, on average. To this end, we compute the per-
centage of the probability mass that the attention
model has assigned to aligned words for each POS
tag, see Table 8.

the POS tags. To examine how the rest of at-
tention in each case has been distributed over the
source sentence we measure the attention distri-
bution over dependency roles in the source side.
We first parse the source side of RWTH data using
the ParZu parser (Sennrich et al., 2013). Then we
compute how the attention probability mass given
to the words other than the alignment points, is
distributed over dependency roles. Table 7 gives
the most attended roles for each POS tag. Here,
we focus on POS tags discussed earlier. One can
see that the most attended roles when translating
to nouns include adjectives and determiners and in
the case of translating to verbs, it includes auxil-
iary verbs, adverbs (including negation), subjects,
and objects.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have studied attention in neu-
ral machine translation and provided an analysis
of the relation between attention and word align-
ment. We have shown that attention agrees with
traditional alignment to a certain extent. How-
ever, this differs substantially by attention mech-
anism and the type of the word being generated.
We have shown that attention has different pat-
terns based on the POS tag of the target word.
The concentrated pattern of attention and the rela-
tively high correlations for nouns show that train-
ing the attention with explicit alignment labels is
useful for generating nouns. However, this is not
the case for verbs, since the large portion of at-
tention being paid to words other than alignment
points, is already capturing other relevant infor-
mation. Training attention with alignments in this

37



case will force the attention model to forget these
useful information. This explains the mixed re-
sults reported when guiding attention to comply
with alignments (Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al.,
2016; Alkhouli et al., 2016).
