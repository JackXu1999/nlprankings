ABSTRACT 

Speech based interface can play a vital role for the successful implementation of 
computerized systems for masses. As a tool for this purpose, effort has been made for the 
development of a Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system for Punjabi language written in 
Gurmukhi script. Concatenative method has been used to develop this TTS system. 
Syllables have been reported as good choice of speech unit for speech databases of many 
languages. Since Punjabi is a syllabic language, so syllables has been selected as the basic 
speech unit for this TTS system, which preserves within unit co-articulation effects. 
System involves development of algorithms for pre-processing, schwa deletion and 
syllabification of the input Punjabi text, as well as speech database for Punjabi. A syllable 
based Punjabi speech database has been developed that stores articulations of syllable 
sounds at starting, middle and end positions of the word for producing natural sounding 
synthesized speech.

Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system has extensive range of applications in everyday 
life. In order to make the computerized systems more interactive and helpful to the users, 
especially physically and visibly impaired and illiterate masses, the TTS synthesis systems 
are in  great demand for the Indian languages. Concatenative speech synthesis technique 
has been used for the development of this system. Punjabi is a syllabic language (Singh, 
2002), so syllables has been selected as the basic speech units and output waveform is 
generated by concatenating the syllable sounds, which preserves within unit co-
articulation effects (Raghavendra, Desai, Yegnanarayana, Black, & Prahallad, 200 8; 
Narayana & Ramakrishnan, 2007). Syllable sounds in different contexts have been 
marked in pre-recorded sound file and stored in the speech database to get natural 
sounding synthesized speech.

1.1.1 Pun jabi lan guage  

Punjabi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than hundred million people those 
are inhabitants of the historical Punjab region (in north western India and Pakistan) and 
in the Diasporas particularly Britain, Canada, North America, East Africa and Australia. It  
is written from left to right using Gurmukhi (an abugida derived from the Laṇḍā script 
and ultimately descended from Brahmi script) as well as Shahmukhi (a version of the 
Arabic script) scripts. This TTS system for Punjabi language has been developed for 
Gurmukhi script. In Gurmukhi script, which follows the “one sound-one sym bol” 
principle, the Punjabi language has thirty eight consonants, ten non-nasal vowels and 
same numbers of nasal vowels   (see Figure 1) (Singh & Lehal, 2010). 
 
 

  

 
 
 
 
 
 

1.1.2  Pun jabi s yllable s  

Defining syllable in  a language is a complex task. There are many theories available in 
phonetics and phonology to define syllable. In phonetics, the syllables are defined based 
upon the articulation (Krakow, 1999). However in phonological approach, the syllables 
are defined by the different sequences of the phonemes. So, combination of phonemes 
gives rise to next higher unit called syllable. Further, combination of syllables produces 
larger units like morphemes and words. So, syllable is a unit of sound which is larger than 
phoneme and smaller than word. In every language, certain sequences of phonemes and 
hence syllables are recognized. Using these phonetic sequences and hence structures, all 
possible syllables can be formed those have been discovered so far in ancient and recent 

410



literary works. In addition, all theoretically possible syllables can be composed that may 
or may not yet be used in a language, but valid in  the sense that these follow rendering 
rules for the language at present (J oshi, Shoff, & Mudur, 2003). A syllable must have a 
vowel, without vowel, syllable cannot exist. In  Punjabi seven types of syllables are 
recognized (Singh, 20 02) –  V, VC, CV, VCC, CVC, CVCC and CCVC (where V and C 
represents vowel and consonant respectively), which combine in turn to produce words. 
The occurrence of syllables of last type CCVC is very rare, and has not been considered in  
the present work. 

Punjabi language has thirty eight consonants, ten non-nasal vowels and same numbers of 
nasal vowels; so, the above said seven syllable types results 11,27,090  syllables in Punjabi 
with non-nasal vowels and the same number of syllables with nasal vowels and thus 
giving total of 22,54,180  syllables in  Punjabi. 

1.1.3  Schw a de le tio n  in  Pu n jabi lan gu age  

Schwa is a mid-central vowel that occurs in unstressed syllables. Phonetically, it is a very 
short neutral vowel sound, and like all vowels, its precise quality varies depending on its 
adjacent consonants. Each consonant in Punjabi (written in Gurmukhi script) is 
associated with one of the vowels. Other vowels, except schwa (‘ਅ’ the third character of 
Punjabi alphabet and written as [ə] in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) 
transcription), are overtly written diacritically or non-diacritically around the consonant; 
however schwa vowel is not explicitly represented in orthography. The orthographical 
representation of any language does not provide any implicit information about its 
pronunciation and is mostly ambiguous and indeterminate with respect to its exact 
pronunciation. The problem in many of the languages is mainly due to the existence of 
schwa vowel that is sometimes pronounced and sometimes not, depending upon certain  
morphological factors. In order to determine the proper pronunciation of words, it is 
necessary to identify which schwas are to be deleted and which are to be retained. Schw a 
deletion  is a phonological phenomenon where schwa is absent in the pronunciation of a 
particular word, although ideally it should have been pronounced (Choudhury, Basu, & 
Sarkar, 2004).  The process of schwa deletion is one of the complex and important issue 
for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, which in turn is required for the development of a 
high quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizer. In order to produce natural and intelligible 
speech, the orthographic representation of input has to be augmented with additional 
morphological and phonological information in order to correctly specify the contexts in  
which schwa vowel is to be deleted or retained (Narasimhan, Sproat, & Kiraz, 20 0 4). 

Mostly phonological schwa deletion rules have been proposed in literature for Indian 
languages. These rules take into account morpheme-internal as well as across morpheme-
boundary information to explain this phenomenon (Narayana & Ramakrishnan, 2007). 
The morphological analysis can improve the accuracy of schwa deletion algorithm which 
is a diachronic and sociolinguistic phenomenon (Singh, 20 02; Singh & Lehal, 2010). The 
syllable structure and stress assignment in  conjunction with morphological analysis can 
also be used to predict the presence and absence of schwa (Tyson & Nagar, 200 9). 

Vowels, except schwa ([ਅ]), are represented diacritically when these come along with 
consonants (known as half vowels), otherwise as such. The consonant sound varies 
according to the vowel attached to consonant. For example, consonant [ਸ] conjoined with 

411



vowel [ਈ] (having diacritic ◌ੀ) results a single orthographic unit “ਸੀ”, having 
pronunciation of a consonant-vowel sequence / ਸ+ਈ/  (/ si/ ) however when this consonant 
comes with vowel [ਆ] the resulting single unit [ਸਾ] will be pronounced as / ਸ+ਆ/  (/ sā/ ). 
Consonants represented in  orthography without any attached diacritic, basically have the 
associated inherent schwa vowel that is not represented diacritically. While pronouncing 
any written word, the speaker retains the intervening schwa vowel associated with a 
consonant where required and eliminate it from pronunciation where it  is not required. 
In Punjabi, inherent schwa following the last consonant of word is elided. For example, 
Punjabi word “ਸੜਕ” ([sədəkə] means road) pronounced as \  ਸ ਅ ੜ ਕ \  (\ s ə d k\ ) is 
represented orthographically with only the consonant characters [ਸ], [ੜ] and [ਕ]. Schwa 
following the last consonant [ਕ] is deleted as per rule said above and deletion of schwa 
following the second consonant [ੜ] makes the word monosyllabic of type CVCC 
(Consonant-Schwa-Consonant-Consonant). 

2  Im ple m e ntatio n  

The working of this Punjabi TTS system can be divided into two modules: Offline Process 
and Online Process. These two subparts are discussed in the following subsections. 

2 .1 Offlin e  pro ce s s  

Offline process of this TTS system involved development of the Punjabi speech database. 
In order to minimize the size of speech database, effort has been made to select a minimal 
set of syllables covering almost whole Punjabi word set. To accomplish this all Punjabi 
syllables have been statistically analyzed on the Punjabi corpus having more than 
hundred million words. Interesting and very important results have been obtained from 
this analysis those helped to select a relatively smaller syllable set (about first ten 
thousand syllables (0 .86% of total syllables)) of most frequently occurring syllables 
having cumulative frequency of occurrence less than 99.81%, out of 1156740  total 
available syllables (Singh & Lehal, 2010). An algorithm has been developed based on the 
set covering problem for selecting the minimum number of sentences containing above 
selected syllables for recording of sound file in which syllable positions are marked. The 
developed Punjabi speech database is having starting and end positions of the selected 
syllable-sounds labeled carefully in pre-recorded sound file. As the pronunciation of a 
syllable varies depending on its position (starting, middle or end) in  the word, so separate 
entries for these three positions has been made in the database for each syllable. In order 
to increase the naturalness of the system a good number of most frequently occurring 
words of corpus have been stored in the database as such. 

2 .2  On lin e  pro ce s s  

Online process is responsible for pre-processing of the input text, schwa deletion, 
syllabification and then searching the syllables in speech database. First module, Pre-
processing  involves expansion of abbreviations, numeric figures and special symbols etc. 
present in the input text to the full word form, so that these should be spoken correctly. 

Second module, Schw a Deletion is an important step for the development of a high 

412



quality Text-To-Speech synthesis system. During utterance of words not every schwa 
following a consonant is pronounced. For proper pronunciation of word, schwas which 
are not to be uttered have to be identified in the orthographic form of word for deletion. A 
rule based schwa deletion algorithm has been developed for Punjabi. These rules are 
based on mainly three parameters: grammatical constraints, inflectional rules and 
morphotactics of Punjabi language, which play important role for identification of schwa 
to be deleted for correct pronunciation of input word. For example, the vowel-consonant 
pattern for Punjabi word “ਮਰਦ” ([mərədə] means man) is CCC. Grammatically, there 
must be schwa vowel following each consonant in Punjabi but the word’s pronunciation 
specifies the existence of schwa [ə] / ਅ/  sound after the first consonant only. So, schwa 
following the first consonant [ਮ] will be retained, however schwa vowels following the 
second [ਰ] and third [ਦ] consonants will be deleted. The accuracy of developed schwa 
deletion algorithm is about 98.27% (Singh & Lehal, 2011). 

Third module, Syllabification  of the words of input text is a challenging task. A universal 
tendency for syllables to have onsets has long been claimed in  phonological theory. This 
preference is built into rule based approaches to syllabification formulated, for example, 
as the onset first principle (Kahn) or the core syllabification principle (Clements) 
(Chiosain , Welby & Espesser, 2012). A rule based syllabification algorithm has been 
developed, which syllabifies the input word into the corresponding syllables. 
Syllabification rules are mostly language specific. For syllabification the phonotactic 
constraints of Punjabi have been followed. So, rules have been devised based on the 
position of vowels and consonants in a word, to segment input word into corresponding 
syllables. For example, table 1 below shows syllabification of some words; where C, V and 
n stands for consonant, vowel and nasal respectively. 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

TABLE 1 –  Output of the syllabification module. 

The developed syllabification module has been tested on about first 10 ,00 0  most 
frequently used words of Punjabi, selected from a Punjabi corpus having about 
1,04,42,574 total words and 2,32,565 unique words. It has been found that accuracy of 
the syllabification module is about 97.89%. 

Syllables of input text are first searched in the Punjabi speech database for corresponding 
syllable-sound positions in recorded sound file and then these syllable sounds are

concatenated. Normalization of the synthesized Punjabi sound is done in order to remove 
discontinuities at the concatenation points and hence producing smooth and natural 
sound. Synchronous-OverLap-Add (SOLA) method is used to achieve a shorter or longer 
playback time than original waveform. A good quality sound is being produced by this 
TTS system for Punjabi language. 

Co n clus io n s  

A fairly good quality Punjabi Text-To-Speech synthesis system has been developed for 
Punjabi. During the development of this TTS system, it has been observed that for a 
concatenative speech synthesis system, the important features that must be taken care of 
are: selection of basic speech unit for concatenation, statistical analysis of selected speech 
units on corpus, corpus must be carefully selected and unbiased; and marking of the 
speech units in recorded sound file. The last one is most important and quality of the 
output speech depends, how carefully speech units are marked in  recorded sound file. 
Correct schwa deletion is very important for  natural pronunciation of the output 
synthesized speech. Schwa basically controls articulation of the sound wave and hence 
pronunciation. Syllabification process is language specific and involves grammatical rules 
of the language as well as knowledge of how local inhabitants syllabify a word during its 
utterance in a natural way. Syllabification with good accuracy is providing a strong base 
for high quality of the output synthesized speech.
