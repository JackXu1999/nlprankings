Abstract

This paper describes the collection and clas-
sification of a multi-dialectal corpus of Ara-
bic based on the geographical information of
tweets. We mapped information of user lo-
cations to one of the Arab countries, and
extracted tweets that have dialectal word(s).
Manual evaluation of the extracted corpus
shows that the accuracy of assignment of
tweets to some countries (like Saudi Arabia
and Egypt) is above 93% while the accuracy
for other countries, such Algeria and Syria is
below 70%.

1 Introduction

Arabic is a morphologically complex lan-
guage (Holes, 2004). With more than 380
million people whose mother tongue is Arabic, it
is the fifth most widely spoken language. Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the lingua franca
amongst Arabic native speakers, and is used in
formal communications, such as newspaper, official
speeches, and news broadcasts. However, MSA is
rarely used in day to day communication. Nearly
all the Arabic speakers use dialectal Arabic (DA)
in everyday communication (Cotterell et al., 2014).
DA may differ from MSA in morphology and
phonology (Habash et al., 2012). These dialects
may differ also in vocabulary and spelling from
MSA and most do not have standard spellings.
There is often large lexical overlap between di-
alects and MSA. Performing proper Arabic dialect
identification may positively impact many Natural
Language Processing (NLP) application. For exam-
ple, transcribing dialectal speech or automatically
translating into a particular dialect would be aided
by the use of targeted language models that are
trained on texts in that dialect. This has led to recent

interest in the automatic collection large dialectal
corpora and the identification of different Arabic
dialects (Al-Mannai et al., 2014; Elfardy et al.,
2013; Cotterell et al., 2014; Zaidan et al., 2014).

There are many varieties of dialectal Arabic dis-
tributed over the 22 countries in the Arabic world.
There are often several variants of a dialect within
the same country. There is also the difference be-
tween Bedouin and Sedentary speech, which runs
across all Arabic countries. However, in natural
language processing, researchers have merged di-
alectal Arabic into five regional language groups,
namely: Egyptian, Maghrebi, Gulf (Arabian Penin-
sula), Iraqi, and Levantine (Cotterell et al., 2014; Al-
Sabbagh and Girju, 2012).

In this paper, we use geographical information in
user Twitter profiles to collect a dialectal corpus for
different Arab countries. The contributions of this
paper are:

1. We show that we can use Twitter as a source
for collecting dialectal corpra for specific Arab
countries with reasonable accuracy.

2. We show that most Arabic dialectal words are
used in more than one country, and cannot be
used separately to collect a dialectal corpus per
country.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sur-
veys pervious work on dialect classification; Sec-
tion 3 describes dialectal Arabic and some of the
possible ways to breakdown Arabic dialects; sec-
tion 4 describes how tweets are collected and classi-
fied; section 4 shows how to extract dialectal words
and shows that many of them are used in more than
one country; Section 5 describes our evaluation ap-
proach and reports on evaluation results; and Sec-
tion 6 contains conclusion and future work.

2 Previous Work

Previous work on Arabic dialect identification uses
n-gram based features at both word-level and
character-level to identify dialectal sentences (El-
fardy et al., 2013; Cotterell et al., 2014; Zaidan et al.,
2011; Zaidan et al., 2014). Zaidan et al. (2011) cre-
ated a dataset of dialectal Arabic. They performed
cross-validation experiments for dialect identifica-
tion using word n-gram based features. Elfardy
et al. (2013) built a system to distinguish between
Egyptian and MSA. They used word n-gram features
combined with core (token-based and perplexity-
based features) and meta features for training. Their
system showed a 5% improvement over the system
of Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011). Later, Zaidan
et al. (2014) used several word n-gram based and
character n-gram based features for dialect identifi-
cation. The system trained on word unigram-based
feature performed the best with character five-gram-
based feature being second best. A similar result is
shown by Cotterell et al. (2014) where word unigram
model performs the best. Recent work by Darwish
et al. (2014) indicates that using a dialectal word list
to identify dialectal Egyptian tweets is better than
training on one of the existing dialect corpora.

All of the previous work except Cotterell et
al. (2014)1 evaluated their systems using cross-
validation. These models heavily rely on the cover-
age of training data to achieve better identification.
This limits the robustness of identification to gen-
res inline with the training data. In this paper, we
exploit geographic information supplied by users to
properly identify the dialect of tweets.

There is also increasing interest in the literature to
geotag tweets due to its importance for some appli-
cations such as event detection, local search, news
recommendation and targeted advertising. For ex-
ample, Mahmud et el. (2012) (Mahmud et al., 2012)
presented a new algoritm for inferring home loca-
tions of Twitter users by collecting tweets from the
top 100 US cities using the geo-tag filter option of
Twitter and latitude and longitude for each city us-
ing Googles geo-coding API. Bo Han et al. (2014)
(Han et al., 2014) presented an integrated geolo-
cation prediction framework and investigated what

1Zaidan et al. (2014) applied their classifier to a different
genre but did not evaluate it’s performance.

factors impact on prediction accuracy. They ex-
ploited the tweets and profile information of a given
user to infer their primary city-level location.

3 Dialectal Arabic (DA)

DA refers to the spoken language used for
daily communication in Arab countries. There
are considerable geographical distinctions be-
tween DAs within countries, across country bor-
ders, and even between cities and villages as
shown in Figure 1. According to Ethnologue
(http://www.ethnologue.com/browse/names), there
are 34 variations of spoken Arabic or dialects in
Arabic countries in addition to the Modern Standard
Arabic (MSA).

Some recent works (Zbib et al., 2012; Cotterell
et al., 2014) are based on a coarser classification of
Arabic dialects into five groups namely: Egyptian
(EGY), Gulf (GLF), Maghrebi (MGR), Levantine
(LEV), and Iraqi (IRQ). Other dialects are classified
as OTHER.

Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2014) mentioned that
this is one possible breakdown but it is relatively
coarse and can be further divided into more dialect
groups, especially in large regions such as Maghreb.
The goal of this paper is to collect a large, clean cor-
pus for each country and study empirically if some
of these dialects can be merged together.

We found that there are very few dialectal words
that are used in a country and not used in any other
country. For example, we took the most frequent
Egyptian dialectal words in the Arabic Online Com-
mentary Dataset (AOCD) described in Zaidan and
Callison-Burch (2014) according to what they call
the dialectness factor, which is akin to mutual in-
formation. The AOCD contains comments from
newspapers from dialect groups and these comments
were classified into different dialects using crowd
souring. We examined whether they appear in dif-
ferent dialects or not. As shown in Table 1, most
Egyptian dialectal words are being used in different
dialects.

With this finding, we realized that unique dialec-
tal words for each country are not common in the
sense that they are few and in the sense that relying
on them to filter tweets would likely yield a small
number of tweets. Thus, we opted not to use such

words to extract tweets for each dialect. From the
AOCD, we extracted all unique uni-grams, bigrams,
and trigrams, and counted the occurrence of these n-
grams from the comments that were marked to be-
long to different dialects and also in a large MSA
corpus composed of 10 years worth of Aljazeera ar-
ticles, containing 114M tokens 2. We retained the n-
grams that appeared at least 3 or more times in either
the dialectal comments. In all, we extracted roughly
45,000 n-grams. The n-grams were manually judged
as dialectal or not, and also to which dialect they are
most commonly used in. The judgments were per-
formed by one person who is a native Arabic speaker
with good exposure to different dialects.

Table 2 lists some words along with their frequen-
cies and to which dialect (or MSA) they belong.
Since MSA words compose more than 50% of the

2http://aljazeera.net

words in dialectal text, it is not surprising that words
that appear frequently in the corpora of different di-
alects are indeed MSA. Further, we found that Al-
jazeera articles contain many dialectal words. Upon
further investigation, we found the articles contain
transcripts of interviews, where often times the in-
terviewees used dialects, and quotes within articles,
where the quoted persons used dialectal utterances.
We also found that this was not unique to Aljazeera
articles.

When we examined the Arabic GigaWord cor-
pus 3, which is a commonly used MSA corpus, we
found that it contains many dialectal words as well.
For example, the word èY» (kdh) is mentioned 2,574
times and the word 	àA � Ê « (El$An) is mentioned
974 times). This was the main motivating factor for
manually judging n-grams as dialectal or not. Of the
n-grams we manually tagged, approximately 2,500

were dialectal. We assumed that if a sentence con-
tained one of these n-grams, then the sentence is di-
alectal. This assumption is consistent with recent
published work by Darwish et al. (2014). The dis-
tribution of these dialectal n-grams was: 54% uni-
grams like �Ó (m$), 39% bigrams like ÈðX Ñë (hm
dwl), and 7% trigrams such as

>nA EArf). We plan to make the list of dialectal
n-grams available to the research community.

Based on interaction with people at Twitter, the
estimated number of Arabic microblogs on Twitter
is in excess of 15 million per day. The ubiquity of
Arabic tweets has been one of the strongest motiva-
tions for us to investigate the building of an Arabic
dialectal corpus from tweets. Also, tweets are more
similar to verbal utterances than formal text, which
may be helpful in building language models that are
better suited for dialectal Arabic speech recognition.

4 Collecting and Classifying Tweets

4.1 Tweets Collection
We collected 175 M Arabic tweets in March 2014
(5.6M tweets per day) by issuing the query lang:ar
against Twitter API 4. Each tweet has a user ID, and
following this ID we can extract the following in-
formation from users profile: user name, user time
zone, and user location. The user location has the
user declared geographical location. This could be
in the form of a city name, country name, landmark
name, country nickname, etc. Such information is
available for roughly 70% of tweets. Precise geo-
tagging of tweets, namely latitude and longitude,
was available for a very small percentage of tweets.
Further, due to the fact that some countries, partic-
ularly in the Gulf region, have large expat commu-
nities, geo-tagging of tweets only indicate where the
tweet is authored but cannot reliably indicate the di-
alect. By retaining tweets where the user declared a
location, we were left with 123M tweets, i.e. 70%
of the tweets.

4.2 Tweet Normalization
Tweets and user locations were normalized and
cleaned in the manner described in Darwish et
al. (2012) by mapping frequent non-Arabic charac-
ters and decoration to their mappings, handling re-
peated characters, etc. Below in an example that
shows a tweet before and after normalization:

 ¼ðQ�.Ó mbrwk yA bA$A.
Translation: Congratulations sir.

4.3 User Locations

By looking at user locations, we found that the top
unique 10K user locations cover 92M tweets. This
is approximately 75% of tweets that have user lo-
cations. We used the GeoNames 5 geographical
database, which contains eight million place names
for each country, to initially assign a user location to
one of the Arab countries.

GeoNames has many places without Arabic
transliteration, and also users write their locations in
Arabic or English, in full or abbreviated forms, and
using formal or informal writings. Thus, we manu-
ally revised mapping that matched in GeoNames and
attempted to map non-matching ones to countries.
Examples of such mappings are shown in Table 3.

There were some cases where we could not map
a user location to a single Arab country because it is
not unique to a particular Arab country or it is not
indicative of any country. Such examples include:
Q�
J.ºË@ ú
G. QªË@

	á£ñË@ “Great Arab Homeland,” �èQK
 	Qm.Ì'@
�é J
 K. Q ª Ë@ “Arabian Peninsula,” or �é J
 �̄Qå� Ë @ “the East-
ern.” In all, approximately 3,500 user locations were
mapped to specific countries and the remaining were
not. By excluding tweets with non-deterministic
user locations, we were left with 62M tweets that
have deterministic mappings between user locations
and Arab countries. We plan to make the manually
reviewed list of user locations publicly available.

4.4 Filtering on Dialectal Words

We used the aforementioned list of dialectal n-grams
that we manually extracted to filter the tweets, by re-
taining those that contain at least one of the n-grams.
By doing so, we extracted 6.5M tweets (i.e. 3.7% of

5http://www.geonames.org/

the original tweets). Their by-country breakdown is
as follows: 3.99M (61%) from Saudi Arabia (SA),
880K (13%) from Egypt (EG), 707K (11%) from
Kuwait (KW), 302K (5%) from United Arab Emi-
rates (AE), 65k (2%) from Qatar (QA), and the re-
maining (8%) from other countries such as Morocco
and Sudan. The distribution of tweets per-country is
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Dialectal Tweets Distribution

5 Evaluation of Dialectal Tweets

To evaluate the accuracy of tweets belonging to the
dialect commonly spoken in the different countries
that they were assigned to, we randomly extracted
100 tweets per dialect to be manually tagged for di-
alect.

We used CrowdFlower crowd-sourcing website 6

to evaluate the dialects of tweets. We asked people
from the countries associated with each of the as-
sociated tweet to judge whether the tweets indeed
match the dialect in their country or not. We asked
for 3 judgments per tweet. We utilized 20 chal-
lenge questions to verify that the judges were doing
a good job. We were able to get a sufficient number
of judges to finish task for some countries but not
all. For example, we were not able to find judges
from Qatar and Bahrain. Table 4 lists the accuracy
of classification using dialectal words filter and user
location.

Errors occurred because some words are mostly
used in dialects but less frequently used in MSA

Table 3: Mapping User Location to Arab Countries

(like © Ê ¢ �� (tTlE)), and the second reason is
sometimes a user profile has user location that was
mapped to an Arab country, but the user writes
tweets using another dialect that is different than one
for the stated country.

Examples of tweets that were tagged as Egyptian
correctly and incorrectly are shown in table 5.

6 Conclusion

Twitter can be used to collect dialectal tweets for
each Arab country with high accuracy for some
countries and average accuracy for other countries
using the geographical information associated with
Twitter user profiles. We were able to find dialec-
tal tweets belonging to different dialects with good
accuracy by identifying tweets where users used di-
alectal word n-grams and declared their user loca-
tions to belong to particular countries. We tabulated
a list of roughly 2,500 dialectal n-grams and 3,500
countries/user locations pairs that we used for iden-
tification. We plan to release them publicly. Also,
we showed that cross-dialect dialectal words overlap
is common, which adds to the complexity of identi-
fying tweets that belong to specific dialects. Thus,
using geographical information can greatly enhance
dialect identification.

For future work, we plan to analyze the correct-
ness of users’ claims on their locations by different
methods like tweet geographical information (lati-

tude and longitude), collecting dialectal words for
each country, etc. Also, we plan to empirically reex-
amine the dialect conflation schemes that are com-
monly used in the literature. Existing schemes for
example tend to conflate dialects of all Gulf coun-
tries, include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,
United Arab Emirates, and Oman. We believe that
the dialect spoken in the Western part of Saudi Ara-
bia is sufficiently different from that in Kuwait for
example. We would like to study the overlap be-
tween dialects spoken in different countries to ascer-
tain dialects of which countries can be safely con-
flated.
