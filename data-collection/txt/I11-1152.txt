Abstract

We demonstrate that statistical machine
translation (SMT) can be improved sub-
stantially by imposing clause-based re-
ordering constraints during decoding. Our
analysis of clause-wise translation of dif-
ferent types of clauses shows that it is ben-
eficial to apply these constraints for finite
clauses, but not for non-finite clauses. In
our experiments in English-Hindi trans-
lation with an SMT system (DTM2), on
a test corpus containing around 850 sen-
tences with manually annotated clause
boundaries, BLEU improves to 20.4 from
the baseline score of 19.4. This statisti-
cally significant improvement is also con-
firmed by subjective (human) evaluation.
We also report preliminary work on au-
tomatically identifying the kind of clause
boundaries appropriate for enforcing re-
ordering constraints.

1 Introduction

It has been recognized widely that reordering is
the Achilles’ heel of most SMT models (Birch
et al., 2009; Hoang and Koehn, 2009), espe-
cially when applied to languages with large syn-
tactic differences. In our experiments in English-
Hindi SMT, we observe that it is quite frequent
in multi-clause sentences for phrases to move out
of their respective clauses due to incorrect re-
ordering. While such mistakes can be avoided
by restricting reordering over clause boundaries,
this paper demonstrates that such a strategy works
well only for finite clauses, and not for non-finite
clauses.

Clause-wise or part-by-part translation has been
a standard approach in traditional transfer-based
systems. In Systran, as described by Hutchins
and Somers (1992), conjunct and relative clauses

were segmented in a preprocessing step. Simi-
lar methods were used in the the Stanford Ma-
chine Translation project (Wilks, 1973). Chan-
drasekar (1994) applies a sentence simplification
method to machine translation, where sentences
are split at conjunctions, relative pronouns, etc.,
before translation. Rao et al. (2000) describe a
clause-wise translation strategy within an English-
Hindi transfer-based MT system.

In the context of SMT, Koehn and
Knight (2003) use a dedicated noun phrase
(NP) translation subsystem to obtain significant
improvements in German-English translation.
Other similar work includes (Watanabe et al.,
2003) for Japanese-English SMT and (Hewavitha-
rana et al., 2007) for Arabic-English. Sudoh et
al. (2010) propose methods to perform clause-
level alignment of the parallel corpus, and to
translate clauses (all clauses identified by a syn-
tactic parser) as a unit to improve long-distance
reordering in a specialized domain – English-
Japanese translation of research paper abstracts in
the medical domain.

While our approach draws from many of the
above, it is novel in the following ways: (i) We
provide an analysis of different clause types in
translation – we show that only some kinds of
clauses benefit from the use of reordering con-
straints, and (ii) We demonstrate significant im-
provements using this strategy for English-Hindi
SMT in a general domain.

2 Problem Statement

We analyzed a set of 225 sentences translated
through the baseline system. Of the 120 sentences
in this set which had more than one clause, 45
sentences were found to have inter-clause reorder-
ing problems; that is, some words or phrases are
wrongly placed in a clause where they do not be-
long. Such long-range reordering problems obvi-
ously have a serious detrimental effect on transla-

1351



tion quality, and it is quite likely that even limiting
the reordering problems to the respective clauses
will aid comprehensibility.

3 Analysis of Clause Types in Translation

We will now look at how finite and non-finite
clauses behave in translation. Finite clauses are
basically tensed clauses, while non-finite clauses
are untensed.

• Finite clauses: Finite clauses appear most
commonly in conjunct or relative construc-
tions. In such cases, each finite clause can be
translated separately and glued together us-
ing the correct translation of the conjunction
or the relative pronoun. While this strategy
works very well for conjunct clauses, in rela-
tive clauses the resulting translation is some-
times not completely natural, but it is never-
theless always clearly understandable. Con-
sider the following example:

Input: The boy, who stays in Delhi, won the
match.

Using a clause-wise translation approach,
this would be translated as,

lXkA , jo Ed¥F m�\ r�htA h{ , m{c jFt
gyA.

ladakaa, jo dillii men rehtaa hai, match jiita
gayaa

Gloss:boy, who Delhi in stays, match won

However, a more natural translation would be
using correlatives:

jo lXkA Ed¥F m�\ r�htA h{ , vo m{c jFt
gyA.

jo ladakaa dillii men rehtaa hai, vo match ji-
ita gayaa

Gloss:which boy Delhi in stays, he match
won

Certain kinds of nominal clauses also result
in similar disfluencies. For example, in the
sentence “The playground is where the statue
is situated”, putting a reordering constraint
around the clause “where the statue is situ-
ated” results in an unnatural translation.

• Non-finite clauses: Compared to finite
clauses, the translation of a non-finite clause
is much more dependent on its role within the

sentence. There are two main issues: (i) all
or part of the non-finite clause could get re-
ordered with the surrounding clause, or (ii)
the overall meaning is conveyed by a phrase
or group of words from the non-finite clause
and a surrounding or neighbouring clause.

Taking to-infinitives as the example category,
consider the following constructions:

a. To-infinitive clause in raising construc-
tions: Here the embedded clause with the
raised element is translated as a finite clause
with that as a complementizer. For example,

Input: John is certain to win,

which is translated as “It is certain that John
will win”:

yh ty h{ Ek jA�n jFt�gA.

yaha tay hai ki John jiitega

Gloss:it certain is that John will-win

It is the combination of “certain” (or similar
word) and the to-infinitive that results in this
translation.

b. To-infinitive with a copular verb: In such
cases, the infinitive is inflected with a kr
(kara) ending to indicate sequentiality:

Input: John was happy to see him

jA�n us� d�Kkr K� f h� aA.

John use dekhakara khusha huaa

Gloss:John him-to seen-having happy
was/became

Here, the non-finite clause “to see him”, gets
reordered into the main clause, something
that will not be possible if reordering con-
straints are applied.

Similarly, there are differences in the way
other non-finite clauses (with -ed and -ing
participles) are treated. The point being
made here is that handling these differences
is crucial to the correct meaning being con-
veyed. In other words, simply translating
non-finite clauses separately with reordering
constraints around them, will not lead to good
translation, because the translation of these
clauses is often dependent on the superor-
dinate clause, and also there is reordering
between these clauses and the superordinate
clause.

Table 2: Automatically identified finite clauses

Based on the above analysis, we are encouraged
to test the hypothesis that it is helpful to put re-
ordering constraints around finite clauses, but not
around non-finite clauses.

Finiteness is one broad dimension along which
clauses may be categorized. Subordinate clauses
can be further classified based on the position in
which they occur in the sentence – that is, whether
they occur in the complement position, the speci-
fier position, or the adjunct position. We may also
classify clauses based on whether they play an ad-
jectival, nominal, or adverbial role in the sentence.
The focus of the present work, however, is only on
the finiteness aspect.

4 Experiments

In this section, we first describe briefly our base-
line system and our approach to handling clauses
within this system. We then summarize the
datasets used and our evaluation methodology, be-
fore describing the results of various experiments.

4.1 Approach

The baseline system we use is DTM2 (a direct
translation model) (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007).
The word-alignments were done using an HMM
aligner. We used the best-performing parameter
setting in the decoder 1.

A beam search decoder (Ittycheriah and
Roukos, 2007) similar to other phrase-based de-
coders (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) is used for trans-
lation. The reordering restriction is applied by
treating the relevant clause-boundaries as barriers,
and putting a hard constraint on reordering across

1Specifically, the skip-length (distortion limit) was set to
8. Lower skip-lengths led to much poorer performance. For
example, with a skip-length of 4, the BLEU score dropped by
around 2 points compared to a skip-length of 8

barriers – that is, during decoding, if a new hy-
pothesis requires reordering over a barrier, the hy-
pothesis is discarded.

We experiment with clause boundaries identi-
fied in three ways: (i) manually (section 4.3.1),
(ii) automatically using a constituency parser (sec-
tion 4.3.2), and (iii) automatically using a CRF-
based clause-boundary classifer using part-of-
speech and parser features (section 4.3.3).

4.2 Data and Evaluation

The system was trained on a parallel corpus with
289k sentences (combining the LDC English-
Hindi parallel texts with internal datasets) consist-
ing of various domains including news, and tested
on 844 sentences. The language model was trained
on around 1.5 million sentences.

Automatic evaluation was done using
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) with a single
reference translation per sentence. Statistical
significance of the test results with BLEU
was computed using paired bootstrap resam-
pling (Koehn, 2004). Subjective evaluation
was performed on hundred randomly selected
multi-clause sentences, using a five-point scale.

4.3 Results

4.3.1 Manual annotation: finite vs. non-finite
clauses

For this experiment, the sentences in the test sets
were manually annotated with finite and non-finite
clause boundaries. The results in table 1 indicate
that reordering constraints around finite clauses
work much better than around non-finite clauses.

finite (auto) 35 17
non-finite (manual) 17 10
finite + non-finite (manual) 19 11

4.3.2 Automatic clause identification using a
parser

The goal of this experiment was to determine
whether clauses obtained from a parser could be
used for the purpose of imposing clause-based
constraints. We performed the experiment by us-
ing a state-of-the-art maxent parser (Ratnaparkhi,
1999) to mark all clause boundaries (clause-level
nodes based on the Penn Treebank II Style brack-
eting guidelines – S, S-BAR, SQ, SBARQ, and
SINV). The results were negative (table 2 – row
titled parser), indicating that straightforward use
of a parser is not sufficient to help in identifying
clauses suitable for reordering constraints. The
column titled ACI accuracy has the F-measure
for automatic clause-boundary identification mea-
sured over the entire test corpus.

4.3.3 Automatic clause identification using a
CRF classifier

We annotated a set of 1500 English sentences with
finite-clause boundaries, and used this to train a
CRF-based clause-boundary classifier (Ram and
Devi, 2008; Tjong et al., 2001). Unigram and bi-
gram word features, unigram, bigram and trigram
POS features, and the POS of the following verb
group were used in the model (Kashioka et al.,
2003) 2. We see (table 2) that a reasonable gain
is obtained using the classifier, though not nearly
as much as with manual annotation.

5 Discussion

The subjective evaluation scores reveal that only a
few translations degrade in quality when reorder-
ing constraints are used with finite clauses (largely
due to fluency issues of the kind described in sec-
tion 3). Table 3 shows the number of translations
that improved (i.e., the average adequacy and flu-
ency score increased) due to clause-based transla-
tion, and the number which degraded, among the
hundred sentences taken up for subjective evalua-

2Adding clause-boundary information from the parser as
features in the classifier resulted in a lower F-measure of 0.65

tion. The following is an illustration of the kind of
improvements clause-based translation brings:

Input: America claims that Iran wants to con-
tinue its nuclear programme, and secretly builds
atomic weapons.

Baseline translation: amrFkA kA dAvA h{ Ek
usk� prmAZ� kAym rhnA cAht� h{\ aOr̂ IrAn
prmAZ� hETyAr EnmAZ krtA h{.

amerika kaa daavaa hai ki usake paramaanu
kaaryakrama rahanaa caahate hain aur iraana
paramaanu hathiyaara nirmaana karataa hai

Gloss: America’s claim is that their nuclear pro-
gramme continue want and Iran nuclear weapons
builds

Clause-based translation: amrFkA kA dAvA
h{ Ek IrAn apn� prmAZ� kAym ko jArF
rKnA cAhtA h{ aOr prmAZ� hETyAr EnmAZ
krtA h{.

amerika kaa daavaa hai ki iran apane para-
maanu kaaryakrama ko jaarii rakhanaa caahataa
hai aura paramaanu hathiyaara nirmaana kartaa
hai

Gloss: America’s claim is that Iran its nu-
clear programme to continue wants and nuclear
weapons builds

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We have shown that the quality of English-Hindi
statistical machine translation can be improved by
performing clause-wise translation. An impor-
tant finding in our work is that, in general, finite
clauses are more directly suited for such transla-
tion compared to non-finite clauses.

Possible directions of future work include: (i)
using clause-based constraints also in training,
(ii) learning from word-alignments, the kinds of
clauses that can benefit from reordering con-
straints, (iii) analyzing the impact of finer-grained
clause types (as mentioned in section 3) on transla-
tion, (iv) comparing with other SMT models (Gal-
ley and Manning, 2010; Chiang, 2005), and (v)
using soft constraints instead of hard constraints
for reordering (Marton and Resnik, 2008).
