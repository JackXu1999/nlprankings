Abstract 

Term normalization is frequently used in in-

formation retrieval task to reduce variant 

word forms to a common form. The most 

general term normalization technique used 

in practice is stemming, however it has been 

found to not be completely reliable.  Here 

we present PubTermVariants, a high-quality 

data-driven resource of term variant pairs 

that can improve search results in PubMed. 

For a given pair, we consider two terms to 

be variants if they stem to the same form, 

pass the hypergeometric test, and pass the 

morpho-semantic test. We perform manual 

evaluation of a subset of PubTermVariants 

that confirms the high quality of the candi-

date pairs. We further present experiments 

that demonstrate their usefulness for Pub-

Med search. 

1 Introduction 

Information retrieval, and biomedical text pro-

cessing in general, profoundly depend on sensitive 

techniques for term normalization. Frequently, the 

link between a query and a document is not estab-

lished because they use different forms of a term. 

These differences may be morphological (related by 

derivation or inflection) variations of a word, (e.g. 

autoimmune, autoimmunities, autoimmunity), syn-

onyms (e.g. kidney disease and renal disease), ab-

breviations, etc. It is to the problem of 

morphological term variations that we wish to give 

attention here. Specifically, the goal of this study is 

to find pairs of string variants that have the same 

meaning and when used interchangeably benefit 

PubMed search. 

Stemming (Porter 1980) is frequently used for the 

string normalization task to conflate different forms 

of a word that have the same meaning. This has been 

found useful in the task of information retrieval and 

has been shown to yield small improvements on typ-

ical test collections (Hull 1996, Hollink, Kamps et 

al. 2004, Manning, Raghavan et al. 2009, Moral, de 

Antonio et al. 2014). Since stemming is not com-

pletely reliable, different methods have been ap-

plied in an attempt to improve the final results of 

stemming such as limiting the results to forms found 

together in a lexicon (Krovetz 1993). This latter ap-

proach however is quite limiting and (Xu and Croft 

1998) developed a method that uses a mutual infor-

mation measure of the co-occurrence of two word 

forms to estimate how related they are and to put 

them in the same equivalence class if the infor-

mation is above a threshold. This is done with the 

aim of improving the equivalence classes of forms 

with a common stem produced by the original ap-

plication of the stemmer.  

A study of morpho-semantic relationships in 

Medline (Wilbur and Smith 2013) identifies mor-

phologically related tokens in Medline by using 

character n-grams as features and then computes the 

probability that two strings are related based on the 

context. This approach infers the morphological re-

latedness of two strings in a way more general than 

141



stemming, but based on certain substrings of char-

acters on which they match. 

We take what we would describe as a more prag-

matic approach. We define two terms to be variants 

of each other if they can be used interchangeably at 

the query stage. With the goal to obtain a reliable 

list of variants, we first find pairs of terms that stem 

to the same form and have common document in 

which they appear. We then apply the hypergeomet-

ric (HG) test (Larson 1982) to decide whether the 

observed co-occurrence for a particular pair of 

terms is above random. For the pairs that pass the 

HG test, we compute the morpho-semantic similar-

ity score following (Wilbur and Smith 2013) and 

only retain the pairs that score above the threshold. 

When all these conditions hold, we view the two 

forms as a good candidate term variant pair. We be-

lieve this is a less aggressive and clearly safer way 

to use stemming for query expansion that results in 

a conservative list of term variants.  

In the next section we provide more details on 

how we generate term variants. We then present the 

results of manual evaluation of a randomly selected 

set of candidate term variant pairs. Further we de-

scribe two experiments that reveal how PubMed 

document retrieval is affected when term variants 

are used. In these experiments we consider both 

zero-result and nonzero-result queries.  

2 Computing Term Variants 

Stemming. To begin our processing, we first ex-

tracted space-separated tokens that appeared in ten 

or more PubMed articles. We stemmed every token 

with the Porter stemmer (Porter 1980) and collected 

pairs of tokens with the same stem. This process re-

sulted in 201,219 unique pairs of tokens.  

The Hypergeometric Test. Here we used the hy-

pergeometric distribution and the p-value test for 

every pair of words in a group. Let 𝑵𝒔 and 𝑵𝒕 be the 
number of documents in Medline that contain terms 

s and t respectively, let 𝑵 be the size of Medline, 
and 𝑵𝒔𝒕 be the number of documents in Medline 
containing both terms s and t. The random variable 

Y representing a number of documents containing 

both terms s and t is a hypergeometric random vari-

able with parameters 𝑵𝒔, 𝑵𝒕 and N (Larson 1982) if 
s is randomly assigned to the  𝑵𝒔 documents. The 
probability distribution of Y is: 

𝑷(𝒚) = (
𝑵𝒕
𝒚
) (

𝑵 − 𝑵𝒕
𝑵𝒕 − 𝒚

) (
𝑵

𝑵𝒔
)⁄ . 

From 𝑁𝑠𝑡 we compute the p-value, i.e. the proba-
bility of the observed 𝑁𝑠𝑡 or a higher frequency aris-
ing by chance as follows: 

p-value = ∑ 𝑷(𝒚).

𝐦𝐢𝐧⁡(𝑵𝒔,𝑵𝒕)

𝒚=𝑵𝒔𝒕

 

The p-value reflects the significance of two 

words co-occurring in 𝑁𝑠𝑡 documents given the fre-
quencies of individual words and the size of the da-

tabase. A low p-value indicates that the co-

occurrence of the two words in not likely to be by 

chance, but because the words are closely related. 

By applying the HG test to these pairs at the 0.01 

level, we obtain 124,548 word pairs that we will re-

fer to as set StemHG.  

The Morpho-Semantic Analysis. Finally, we 

make use of the study of morpho-semantic relation-

ships in Medline (Wilbur and Smith 2013). For a 

candidate pair of strings the approach assigns a 

probability that the strings are semantically related. 

Using every candidate pair from the above 124,548 

pairs, we retain only the pairs for which the proba-

bility of being related is 0.9 or higher. This analysis 

results in a collection of 82,216 term variant pairs 

that we will refer to as PubTermVariants. There are 

about 109,725K unique terms in PubTermVariants, 

since a term may be paired with multiple variants. 

Because of the HG and the morpho-semantic tests, 

the relationships between term variants are not tran-

sitive.  

In the next section we confirm that this collection 

is of high quality by manual evaluation of a random 

sample and present experiments designed to demon-

strate their usefulness.  

3 Experimental Evaluation and Results 

We evaluate the quality of PubTermVariants by per-

forming manual evaluation of random pairs sam-

pled from the collection. The manual evaluation 

reveals the high quality of the variants in the collec-

tion. Our further experiments are designed to prove 

their usefulness for PubMed search. 

3.1 Manual Evaluation 

Here we report a manual analysis of PubTermVari-

ants with the goal to confirm that two variants are 

142



indeed word forms that carry the same meaning and 

can be safely interchanged in a query. 

As mentioned earlier, PubTermVariants is a col-

lection of 82,216 candidate term variant pairs. In ad-

dition to PubTermVariants we have 42,332 term 

pairs in the set StemHG\PubTermVariants that po-

tentially may be enriched in term variants. We be-

lieve that the quality of term variants in 

PubTermVariants is attributable to the effect of in-

dependently applying different statistical methods.  

We assessed the quality of proposed term variant 

pairs by manually evaluating 200 random pairs from 

PubTermVariants, as well as 200 random pairs from 

StemHG\PubTermVariants. The 400 pairs were 

shuffled and each pair presented to two annotators. 

Eight annotators reviewed 100 pairs each, so that 

each pair was evaluated by two different people. 

The annotators involved in the manual evaluation 

all have backgrounds in biomedical information re-

trieval. 

A web-based tool was developed to carry out this 

evaluation process and this tool was designed to 

show the term pair, two PubMed abstracts that con-

tained one variant but not the other, and one Pub-

Med abstract that contained both word forms. The 

annotators were asked to judge whether the two 

word forms could be used interchangeably. This de-

cision was made by judging the displayed abstracts 

and deciding whether all of them should be retrieved 

regardless of which term is being used. 

 At this round pairs of annotators agreed on 329 

of 400 instances considered. All individual evalua-

tions were compared and each pair of annotators 

met separately to discuss the discrepancies on the 

remaining 71 pairs. This was later followed by a 

meeting where all annotators were present, and all 

remaining cases were discussed. The annotation ex-

periment found that 89% of pairs in PubTermVari-

ants were true variants of the same concept, while 

only 81.5% of pairs in StemHG\PubTermVariants 

were true variants, presented in Table 1.  

We further examined the quality of term variants 

as a function of token length, as shown in Figures 1 

and 2. We find that tokens of length 3 are typically 

abbreviations and therefore not good term variant 

candidates in the absence of context. For example, 

a pair of terms ohd and ohds is labeled negative, be-

cause, while ohd/ohds could be used interchangea-

bly as singular and plural forms of the abbreviation 

for “occupational health departments”, ohds may 

also stand for “hydroxylase deficiency syndrome”. 

Consequently, of 22 pairs from PubTermVariants 

that were labeled negative 12 pairs include 3 letter 

abbreviations. We also observe that the distribution 

of errors in StemHG\PubTermVariants is more uni-

form as a function of string length. 

3.2 Effect of Term Variants on PubMed 
Search. 

With the goal to understand the usefulness of these 

term pairs in a real-world setting, we examined the 

queries in PubMed logs and performed the follow-

ing analyses: 

1. We analyzed zero-result queries and identi-
fied real user queries that could have re-

turned results by using PubTermVariants. 

2. We analyzed a subset of result-producing 
queries and identified the difference in the 

result set had PubTermVariants been used. 

 

Table 1. Results of manual annotation of 200 ran-

dom pairs from PubTermVariants and 200 pairs 

from StemHG\PubTermVariants. 89% of pairs in 

PubTermVariants and 81.5% of pairs in 

StemHG\PubTermVariants were found to be true 

variants.

of token length in StemHG\PubTermVariants. 
 

For these experiments we collected PubMed log 

data for 2015. We find that about 76% of PubMed 

queries contain a term from PubTermVariants. 

Effect of using PubTermVariants on zero-result 

queries 

Some PubMed queries do not produce a result. We 

call these queries zero-result queries. We ask 

whether using PubTermVariants could lead to re-

sults being retrieved for these queries.  

In order to answer this question we chose a ran-

dom day of PubMed logs in 2015. We preprocessed 

the data and kept only multi-term queries that con-

tained alphanumeric characters, dashes and com-

mas. We also removed queries that did not contain 

a term from PubTermVariants. For each query, we 

verified that if a term variant is removed, the query 

consisting of the remaining tokens retrieved a set of 

PubMed articles. This set contained 55,496 unique 

queries.  

For each of these queries, we replaced a term with 

its variant from the PubTermVariants list. Since 

some terms have multiple variants, this process re-

sulted in 110,103 queries which are now used to 

query PubMed and report results. We call the use of 

the term variants successful if at least one of the var-

iant queries resulted in a successful search. For ex-

ample, term monoubiquitination is mapped in our 

collection to terms monoubiquitin, monoubiqui-

tinate, monoubiquitinated, and monoubiquitinates. 

For a given query hdm2 monoubiquitination, one 

substitution to hdm2 monoubiquitinated is found to 

be successful, and so we call that substitution suc-

cessful. Articles were retrieved for 8.83% (4,902 

queries) of the original 55,496 queries. This per-

centage, however, represents a lower bound of suc-

cess because for every query only one term was 

considered for replacement. Queries can have sev-

eral candidate terms for replacement. 

Effect of using PubTermVariants on result-pro-

ducing queries 

Since PubMed is quite successful at producing rele-

vant results for most queries, we wanted to examine 

the effect of the variants in PubTermVariants on 

these searches. For this experiment we randomly se-

lected 1,000 user queries that contained a term listed 

in PubTermVariants and where the number of Pub-

Med results for each of these queries was between 1 

and 20. For each of these queries we produced only 

one variant query so that the original term variant 

was replaced with one of its paired variants in the 

PubTermVariants list, randomly selected. The re-

sulting variant queries were used to query PubMed 

and we retrieved results for 480 of these queries. We 

compared the results set for the original user queries 

with their variant queries and found that the average 

number of results for the original queries was 6.8, 

however, if we combine the results with the results 

of the variant queries this number increases to 8.5. 

Furthermore, 38% variant queries retrieve addi-

tional relevant PubMed articles without overwhelm-

ing the search results. Similar to the zero result case, 

this percentage represents a lower bound. 

4 Conclusions 

We presented a high-quality list of biomedical term 

variants which we call PubTermVariants. The Pub-

TermVariants resource is generated in a data-driven 

way by applying two statistical tests to pairs of to-

kens that stem to the same form. Both, the hyperge-

ometric and the morpho-semantic tests, provide a 

useful tool for deciding whether terms in the pair are 

related or not.  

PubTermVariants provides a clean and reliable 

high-quality collection of terms that can be used in-

terchangeably in PubMed queries. The manual ex-

amination revealed that 89% of the pairs are true 

variants, and removing three letter tokens results in 

higher quality. Our experiments on PubMed log 

data demonstrated that some zero-result queries that 

contain a term variant can return results by applying 

a substitution from PubTermVariants. Our other ex-

144



periments revealed that when a term variant is ap-

plied to create a variant query, in 38% of the cases 

the result set was enriched with articles which were 

not present in the initial request, thus increasing re-

call. 

PubTermVariants is available for other 

applications of biomedical term variants from
