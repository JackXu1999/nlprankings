Abstract
We have developed a cohesive extraction based single document summarizer (COHSUM) based on
coreference links in a document. The sentences providing the most references to other sentences and
that other sentences are referring to, are considered the most important and are therefore extracted.
Additionally, before evaluations of summary quality, a corpus analysis was performed on the original
documents in the dataset in order to investigate the distribution of coreferences. The quality of the
summaries is evaluated in terms of content coverage and cohesion. Content coverage is measured
by comparing the summaries to manually created gold standards and cohesion is measured by
calculating the amount of broken and intact coreferences in the summary compared to the original
texts. The summarizer is compared to the summarizers from DUC 2002 and a baseline consisting
of the first 100 words. The results show that COHSUM, aimed only at maintaining a cohesive text,
performed better regarding text cohesion compared to the other summarizers and on par with the
other summarizers and the baseline regarding content coverage.

1 Introduction

Extraction based summarizers are often prone to create texts that are fragmented, where sentences
are extracted without considering the context, resulting in for instance broken anaphoric references.
As pointed out by Nenkova (2006), the linguistic quality of automatically generated summaries
can be improved a lot. For current popular measures summarizers often score relatively well
on measures regarding content coverage that incorporates a comparison to humanly created gold
standard summaries. The cohesiveness of the summaries is often left out in the evaluations since
the measures favor inclusion of certain information, disregarding how well the text fits together.
Brandow et al. (1995) revealed that summaries of news articles consisting only of the lead sentences
are difficult to beat; when it comes to newspaper articles this type of summary fits well since the
structure of the text is built around first presenting the gist in the lead sentences and then focusing
the rest of the article on elaborating the information. These texts will of course also be cohesive
since the sentences are extracted in the order they were written.

Barzilay and Elhadad (1999) proposed to improve cohesion in summaries by using lexical chains to
decide which sentences to extract and Bergler et al. (2003) used coreference chains. Other attempts
propose the use of a variety of revisions to the text based on cohesion and discourse relations (Mani
et al., 1998; Otterbacher et al., 2002) or using both revisions and lexical chains (Alonso i Alemany
and Fuentes Fort, 2003). Such approaches require a thesaurus, e.g. WordNet (Barzilay and Elhadad,
1999). Boguraev and Neff (2000) show that cohesion can be improved by utilizing lexical repetition.
Coreference information has also been used, for instance, for creating summaries with a focus on
answering queries on a text (Baldwin and Morton, 1998).

Pitler et al. (2010) attempted to develop and validate methods for automatic evaluation of linguistic
quality in text summarization. They concluded that the topics of Referential clarity and Struc-
ture/Coherence seems to be most important when dealing with extraction based single document
summarization. Furthermore, anaphoric expressions are important for a text’s cohesion (Mani
et al., 1998). Errors regarding broken anaphoric references are, however, common in extraction
based summaries, especially (not surprisingly) in short summaries (Kaspersson et al., 2012), and in
particular for summarizers that focus on content coverage and disregard how sentences are related
to each other.

In this paper, we focus on cohesion and referential clarity, creating summaries that hopefully are
more readable in that they maintain text cohesion. This can be contrasted to summarizers that are
focused only on extracting the most important information in the text, without taking into account
cohesion e.g. (DUC, 2002; Smith and Jönsson, 2011b; Chatterjee and Mohan, 2007; Hassel and
Sjöbergh, 2007; Gong, 2001; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Such summarizers have performed well
when compared to gold standards, the studies lack however results on how cohesive the summaries
are. The hypothesis is that a summarizer focused on creating a cohesive text without regarding
content coverage will score well on cohesive measures while scoring worse at measures aimed at
summary content, and vice versa.

2 Coreferences in Newspaper Texts

Coreferences are commonly used as a feature when evaluating cohesion and coherence (Graesser
et al., 2004; Pitler et al., 2010) and we therefore conducted experiments on the distribution of
coreferences in summaries. We analyzed the 533 news paper texts used for single text summarization
at the 2002 Document Understanding Conference (DUC, 2002). The original documents were

The Y-axis shows the frequency for each number of coreferents for all 533 news paper texts. For
example, most of the coreferents are between two sentences (one representative mention and one
refererent).

tagged for coreference using the Stanford CoreNLP package (Lee et al., 2011)1. The coreference
resolution system first extracts mentions together with relevant information such as gender and
number. These mentions are processed in multiple steps (sieves), which are sorted from highest
to lowest precision. For example, the first sieve (i.e., highest precision) requires an exact string
match between a mention and its antecedent, whereas the last one (i.e., lowest precision) implements
pronominal coreference resolution. At this stage, noun phrases, possessive pronouns and named
entities have been considered for reference. In the last step, after coreference resolution has been
done, a post-processing step is performed where singletons are removed. The results from the
experiments are summarized in Figures 1, 2, and 3.

Figure 1 shows the length of the coreference chains (the number of sentences in the chains) that
are most frequent. Note, however, that most sentences, 7281, does not have a reference at all
(not included in the figure). Most references, 2185, are between two sentences; one with the
representative mention and one additional mention. Approximately 1200 reference chains include
three sentences and so on. There are very few reference chains of length 10 or more.

Figure 2 shows the average distance of the coreferences, that is, how many sentence indices are
between a current sentence and the sentence it references. The X-axis shows the sentence index and
the Y-axis shows the distance or number of sentences between the referents. In the beginning of the
document the distance between referring sentences is around 4, increasing until index (sentence) 20
where the distance is approximately 8, probably because they refer to the first sentences. Then the

long distances in middle sentences and a shorter distance again concerning sentences further into
the document.

distance decreases rapidly.

Figure 3 shows a plot where the sentence indices are on the X- and Y-axis and the size of the circle
depicts the number of times a coreference exists in a given sentence pair. This figure shows that
sentences early in the document have the most coreferences and that they corefer to each other. In
the later parts of the document the sentences are mostly referring to the sentence before. Looking
back at Figure 2 we see that long distance references occur mostly in the middle (around sentence
number 20) of the document and is referring to the beginning of the document.

To summarize, the results reveal that, for news texts, the beginning of the document is terse with
sentences coreferring each other. In the middle of the document, sentences are most often coreferring
to the sentence before. Also, in the middle of the document, there is a longer average coreference
distance, meaning that the sentences in the middle probably refers to the beginning of the document.
This means that many of the coreferences can not be captured by, for instance, picking the previous
sentence in an effort to glue together a summary to increase its cohesion.

3 The Summarizer
Based on the results from our investigations of coreferences in news paper texts presented above,
we have developed a summarizer (COHSUM) that takes into account the distribution of coreferences
indirectly, by calculating a rank for the sentences based on how many out-links (how many other
sentences are a representative sentence referring to) and in-links (how many sentences are referring
to a current sentence). To calculate the ranks, a variant of PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is used,
similar to TextRank (Mihalcea, 2004). Mihalcea (2004) further notes that the nature of PageRank
is probably enough for summaries to exhibit some kind of coherence, since sentences that contain

similar information will be extracted. In COHSUM we take this one step further and extract coreferring
sentences only. Coreferences have, as previously discussed, been used when creating summaries,
however, using coreference chains in graph based ranking algorithms for summarization has not
been done to our knowledge.

Each document that was to be summarized was first parsed and tagged using the CoreNLP-toolkit for
coreference resolution. The coreference chains provided by the parser were used to create a graph,
were each sentence is a node and all sentences having a referential relation to the sentence being
in-/out links in the graph. In more detail; for each sentence, check if it exists in any coreference
chain. For every coreference chain it exists in, count the number of sentences it refers to (with
regards to noun phrases, possessive pronouns and named entities as mention earlier). Let these be
the number of links. A reference consists, in the simplest case, of a two-way link, that is, if sentence
A is referencing sentence B, then sentence A is also referenced by sentence B. A sentence can exist
in multiple coreference chains but possible references within a sentence are not considered.

It is also possible for the parser to select the representative mention. In COHSUM mentions headed
by proper nouns are preferred to mentions headed by common nouns, and nominal mentions are
preferred to pronominal ones. In case of ties, the longer string is selected. The representative
mention in the coreference chain can be considered as the preferred mention, or the most elaborate.
The edges in the graph are weighted to prefer sentences with representative mentions; only sentences
with representative mentions can be considered to have out links. Thus, sentences in a coreference
chain that does not have the representative mention, will have 0 out links and X in-links, where X is
the number of sentences in the chain minus one.

1165



The sentences were ranked according to the number of links provided by the coreference chains
using Equation 1, c.f. PageRank, which recursively calculates the number of links for a number
of iterations (50 in our experiments, with d set to .85, c.f. Smith and Jönsson (2011a)). For our
purposes, sentences containing the representative mention contain out-links while sentences lacking
representative mentions only have in-links. Sentences with representative mentions referencing a
high number of other sentences that are also referenced by a high number of sentences will thus
receive a high rank. This means that sentences existing in multiple coreference chains will receive a
higher rank, especially if that sentence has the representative mention for several chains.

From the graph, weighted using Equation 1, COHSUM extracted the highest ranked sentences one
sentence at a time until the summary consisted of roughly 100 words, to match the output from
other systems and models. Focus was thus not for the summaries to retain the highest amount of
coreference chains, but to be in comparable size to the resource data.

4 Evaluation
The summaries were evaluated using two measures; content coverage and cohesion. Content
coverage is used to compare our summarizer with the systems from DUC (2002) as well as a baseline
consisting of the first part of the documents. For evaluation of content coverage, ROUGE 1-gram
F-measure (Lin, 2004) was used to compare summaries created by COHSUM to the summarization
systems from DUC 2002. Other ROUGE measures are possible, but for this part of the DUC
2002 dataset (single document, 100 word summaries), ROUGE-1 has been shown not to differ
significantly from other ROUGE measures. In total 533 texts were used2, summarized by all 13
systems from DUC (concerned with producing single document 100 word abstracts), COHSUM and
the baseline, FIRST, consisting of the first 100 words.

Cohesion is meant to be contrasted to content coverage; if content coverage is up to par, how
cohesive are the texts? Looking at summaries as cohesive units and measuring the cohesion in them
based on first parsing them with current parsers may be erroneous (Pitler et al., 2010). Current
metrics may work for texts that are produced the way they are supposed to be read; in its entirety.
Measures utilizing parsers (a common way of measuring cohesion, e.g through coreferences) used
directly on summaries might not provide expected results, since the parsers expect the input texts to
be correct. Thus, we have chosen to compare the summaries to the original documents. To calculate
text cohesion when summarizing them, the coreferences in the summaries were logged in terms of
what sentences coreferenced each other in the original documents. Depending on what sentences
were retained in the summary, a coreference in the original document could be intact or broken:

Intact The amount of intact coreferences, that is, the amount of sentences that were retained in the
summary that are coreferencing in the original document.

Broken Broken coreferences, sentences not extracted that contain the representative mention in the
coreference chains. This case often leaves dangling anaphoric expressions without antecedent,
leading to less cohesion.

2Duplicate texts from the corpus were removed.

1166



Using the Stanford CoreNLP-toolkit, the original documents were parsed, followed by the DUC
summaries, the 100 word summary, and the summaries created by COHSUM. The parser was used
for the summaries even though coreference information from the summaries were not. This was to
ensure that comparable outputs from the original documents and the summaries were created. By
calculating the number of sentences in the summaries compared to the coreference chains in the
original texts, we achieve a measure on how much of the cohesion that has been retained, given our
measures of cohesion.

5 Results
Table 1 shows the results from running the DUC summarizers, FIRST, and COHSUM on the 533
DUC 2002 news paper texts. The table shows the systems and their performance on gold standard
comparison (Content) and cohesion (Intact and Broken). The blanks in the table are due to the
systems 25 and 30 altering the summaries3, making a coreference comparison fruitless.

We see that COHSUM is the fifth best system compared to FIRST and the DUC summarizers with
regards to content coverage. The systems 28, 19, COHSUM 21, 29, 27 and FIRST perform best and
compared to COHSUM no significant difference is obtained. COHSUM however, performs significantly
better (p < .05) than the rest of the systems, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 25, 30, and 31, with regards to
content coverage.

Comparing COHSUM to the DUC-systems with regards to coreference chains, reveals that one
system’s summary has fewer coreference chain breaks than COHSUM, no. 17. Compared to COHSUM
there is a significant difference to all systems except systems 31, 18 and 17 with regards to broken
coreferences (p < .05). Again, systems that perform significantly worse than COHSUM are marked
as bold in Table 1. COHSUM has the most intact coreferences compared to the DUC systems. The
number of intact coreferences is significantly higher in COHSUM than in all other summarisers
(p < .05). FIRST is significantly better than all summarizers on both number of broken coreferences
and intact coreferences.

3System 25 was a multi-document summarizer that was also tried on the single document summarization task, while
system 30 focused on producing informative headlines.

6 Discussion
The performance on content coverage for COHSUM is surprisingly on par to the systems from the
DUC 2002 competition (Table 1). Actually, most systems perform well on content coverage, the
differences between the top systems were not significant. While performing on par with the DUC
systems, the COHSUM summaries also have the highest amount of intact coreferences, and the second
fewest breaks of coreference chains. The system with least broken coreferences, number 17, scores,
however, low on content coverage. This indicates that by only taking into account the coreferences
in a newspaper text, a summary that contains a high degree of important information can be created
that also have a more cohesive structure in that they have fewer breaks in the coreference chains
compared to other systems.

The baseline, FIRST, is still the clear winner. The nature in which newspaper articles are produced
(where the gist of the story is presented first, with the rest of the article containing more detailed
explanations, quotes and general development of the text) makes this kind of summary function
well. COHSUM, making use of coreferences, will also often extract the beginning of the document,
since this is where most of the coreferences are (c.f. Figure 3). The sentences in a document is
often referring to the sentence before, however, most of the content seems to be introduced in the
beginning which later parts of the document refer to. Thus, only doing a flat pick of the sentence
before when trying to improve cohesion on a summary is not feasible (Smith et al., 2012).

The coreferences used in COHSUM are not weighted in any way, all sentences with coreferences
are possible candidate sentences for inclusion in the summary. An informed decision on the type
of coreference that should be allowed/weighted might affect the results. Our simplistic approach
does not make this distinction since we were interested in sentences "being about" other sentences
regardless of type. Currently all coreferences are considered as both in- and out-links if they contain
a representative mention. The type of coreference could be further used to decide whether a link
should be in one direction or another.

Using news texts has its limitations, as also pointed out by Over et al. (2007), but this is where most
current research is conducted, and is, thus, important for benchmarking. It is, however, time for
a new single text summarization competition where other text types are considered, texts that are
important for the public to read and understand but where e.g. persons with reading disabilities have
difficulties, such as authority texts and information texts, but also academic texts. Summarizing
such texts (in Swedish) is in our focus of research, c.f. Smith and Jönsson (2011a) and our next step
is to use COHSUM on these texts.

When it comes to other text types, the beginning of the document might not be as important. We
have carried out some initial experiments on a variety of other text types. Looking at plots of the
distribution of coreferences, similar to Figure 3, for other genres we find that scientific texts and
financial publications seem even more terse with coreferences across the entire document, even
though the first couple of sentences seem to contain a lot of coreferences in all the genres. This
indicates that for these genres, the distribution of coreferences is different and taking for instance
the lead sentences will break more coreferences and thus cohesion of the texts.

To summarize, COHSUM performs comparatively well with regards to content coverage, not signifi-
cantly beaten by any system or the baseline but it has significantly fewer broken coreference chains
and more intact coreferences compared to the other summarizers. It, thus, seems that coreferences
are an important factor that can be tied to important sentences when summarizing news texts.
