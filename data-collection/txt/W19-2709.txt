Abstract

Development of discourse parsers to annotate
the relational discourse structure of a text is
crucial for many downstream tasks. However,
most of the existing work focuses on English,
assuming a quite large dataset. Discourse data
have been annotated for Basque, but training a
system on these data is challenging since the
corpus is very small. In this paper, we create
the first parser based on RST for Basque, and
we investigate the use of data in another lan-
guage to improve the performance of a Basque
discourse parser. More precisely, we build a
monolingual system using the small set of data
available and investigate the use of multilin-
gual word embeddings to train a system for
Basque using data annotated for another lan-
guage. We found that our approach to building
a system limited to the small set of data avail-
able for Basque allowed us to get an improve-
ment over previous approaches making use of
many data annotated in other languages. At
best, we get 34.78 in F1 for the full discourse
structure. More data annotation is necessary
in order to improve the results obtained with
these techniques. We also describe which re-
lations match with the gold standard, in order
to understand these results.

1 Introduction

Several theoretical frameworks exist for dis-
course analysis, and automatic discourse analyzers
(ADA) have been developed within each frame-
work, but mostly for English texts: i) under
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and
Thompson, 1988): see for example (Liu and La-
pata, 2017; Yu et al., 2018) ii) under Segmented
Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher
and Lascarides, 2003), as the one developed by
(Afantenos et al., 2015) iii) or Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB) style (Prasad et al., 2008) as the

one described in (Lin et al., 2014).1

Within RST, discourse parsing is done in two
steps: (i) Linear discourse segmentation: The text
is divided into EDUs (Elementary Discourse Unit)
; (ii) Rhetorical annotation: All the EDUs are
linked following tree structure (RS-tree). Iruski-
eta et al. (2014) proposed to carry out an interme-
diate phase, between segmentation and rhetorical
labelling, the annotation of the central unit (CU
annotation).

Although several ADAs exist, researchers have
still face important issues:
− ADAs are not easy to test unless an online

version exists.
− Most of them were developed for English or

languages with a considerable amount of re-
sources.

− The evaluation methods do not demonstrate
robustness and reliability of the systems.

Moreover, when working on low resourced lan-
guages such as Basque, with few resources avail-
able, one has to deal with additional difficulties:
− Information obtained from automatic tools

(e.g. PoS tags) are often less accurate, or are
even sometimes not available.

− The terminology and discourse markers (or
signals) are not standardised since students
have developed the domain or topic.2

− Even in academic texts, language standards
are not known nor established, and there are
more writing errors.

− Finding reliable and third parties annotated
corpora is challenging.

Due to these difficulties, the way to get an ADA
for some languages was done step by step, follow-

ing a partial labelling strategy, such as:3 focus-
ing on segmentation, as done for French (Afan-
tenos et al., 2010), for Spanish (da Cunha et al.,
2012) and for Basque (Iruskieta and Beñat, 2015),
or on the detection of centrals units, as done for
Basque (Bengoetxea et al., 2017) and for Span-
ish (Bengoetxea and Iruskieta, 2017). Moreover,
a system has been developed for identifying nu-
clearity and intra-sentential relations for Spanish
(da Cunha et al., 2012), and a rule-based discourse
parser exist for Brazilian Portuguese (Pardo and
Nunes, 2008; Maziero et al., 2011). The first ver-
sions of these tools were developed mostly follow-
ing simple techniques (i.e. a rule-based approach)
and, later, that results were improved using more
complicated techniques, more amount of data or
machine learning techniques.

Recently, from a different perspective, using a
cross-lingual discourse parsing approach, Braud
et al. (2017) carried out a discourse parser which
includes several languages: English, Basque,
Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and German.

For Basque, Braud et al. (2017) report at best
29.5% in F1 for the full discourse structure using
training data from other languages. However, we
want to underline that Braud et al. (2017) do not
use specific materials (e.g. word embeddings) for
Basque, and they do not report results for a system
trained on Basque data only. When experiment-
ing on a low-resourced language (i.e., less that 100
document in total), such as Basque, they only re-
port results with a union of all the training data for
the other languages, possibly using some held-out
documents to tune the hyper-parameters of their
model.

In this paper, we investigate the use of data in
another language to improve the performance of
a discourse parser for Basque, an under-resourced
language. Moreover, we create and evaluate the
first parser for Basque, and investigate the follow-
ing questions:
− Can we learn from other languages and im-

prove the performance of a parser?
− What differences emerge between the human

and machine annotation?
− Is the parser confident about same rhetorical

relations as humans?
As we mentioned, a limit of this work is that

more annotation data is necessary, in order to im-
prove the results of the Basque parser.

3All of them can be tested online.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2, Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5
present the system of the Basque discourse parser,
the approach and the settings of the system. Sec-
tion 6 lays out the evaluation of the results. Fi-
nally, section 7 sets out the conclusions, the limi-
tations and the future work.

2 System

We use the discourse parser described in Braud
et al. (2017), that has proved to give state-of-the-
art results on English, and was used for the first
cross-lingual experiments for discourse parsing.

This parser can take pre-trained embeddings as
input, for words and for any other features mapped
to real-valued vectors. The parser is based on a
transition-based constituent parser (Coavoux and
Crabbé, 2016) that uses a lexicalized shift-reduce
transition system, here used in the static oracle
setting. The optimization is done using averaged
stochastic gradient descent algorithm (Polyak and
Juditsky, 1992). At inference time, we used beam-
search to find the best-scoring tree. 4

3 Approach

We report results for monolingual systems, us-
ing only the data available for Basque, and cross-
lingual systems using both data for Basque and for
other available languages. Contrary to Braud et al.
(2017), we have access to word embeddings for
Basque, and thus report results using pre-trained
word embeddings (see Section 5).

Monolingual systems: Since the number of
documents avalaible is limited in the monolingual
setting, we optimize the hyper-parameters of our
systems based on cross-validation on the develop-
ment set, keeping the test set separated.5 Then,
we report results with systems trained on the full
development set and evaluated on the test set.

Cross-lingual systems: We evaluate two strate-
gies: first, we build systems trained on the data
available for a source language (i.e. English,
Spanish and Portuguese) and evaluated on the
Basque test set. In this setting, called ‘Src Only’,

4The code is available at https://gitlab.inria.
fr/andiamo/eusdisparser.

5We use the same split of the data as in Braud et al. (2017),
in order to compare results and improvements. In this study,
authors split the available documents into a development set
and a test set.

we use the Basque development set to choose the
best values for the hyper-parameters.

The second strategy is to set the values of the
hyper-parameters via cross-validation (i.e. we
keep the best values obtained in the monolingual
setting), then we can train a model using the train-
ing data of a source language and the data avail-
able in the Basque development set. In this set-
ting, called ‘Src+Tgt’, we evaluate the possible
gains when including some data of the target lan-
guage within our training set. Comparing this two
strategies allows us to investigate the difference
between corpora for discourse annotated for dif-
ferent languages. In both cases, we report final
results on the Basque test set.

In the cross-lingual setting, we can use more
data at training time than when only using mono-
lingual data, but we need a method to represent our
input into the same space (here, multilingual word
embeddings, see Section 5). Also, note that the
datasets annotated within RST do not follow ex-
actly the same annotation guidelines, thus possibly
degrading the results (e.g. the relations ATTRI-
BUTION, TOPIC-COMMENT, COMPARISON,
to cite some, annotated for English are not anno-
tated in the Basque corpus).

We also report results on the datasets used for
training (i.e. English, Spanish and Portuguese)
as a way to check the performance of our system
when more data than for Basque are available, and
when training and evaluation data come from the
same dataset.

4 Data

The Basque RST DT (Iruskieta et al., 2013) con-
tains 88 abstracts from three specialized domains
–medicine, terminology and science– and opin-
ionative texts, annotated with 31 relations. The
inter-annotator agreement is 81.67% for the iden-
tification of the CDU (Iruskieta et al., 2015), and
61.47% for the identification of the relations. We
split the data as done in Braud et al. (2017), keep-
ing 38 documents as test set, the remaining are
used as development set.

In our cross-lingual experiments, we also use
the English RST DT (Carlson et al., 2001) that
contains 385 documents in English from the Wall
Street Journal annotated with 56 relations, the
Spanish RST DT (da Cunha et al., 2011), con-
taining 267 texts annotated with 29 relations, and,
for Portuguese, we used, as done in Braud et al.

(2017), the merging of the four existing cor-
pora: CST-News (Cardoso et al., 2011), Summ-
it (Collovini et al., 2007), Rhetalho (Pardo and
Seno, 2005) and CorpusTCC (Pardo and Nunes,
2003, 2004). For Portuguese, we have in total 329
documents.

The English dataset contains only news arti-
cles, while the others are more diversified, with
texts written by specialists on different topics (e.g.
astrophysics, economy, law, linguistics) for the
Spanish corpus, and news, but also scientific ar-
ticles for the Portuguese one.

Word embeddings: We used pre-trained word
embeddings as input of our systems in order to
deal with data sparsity.

For mono-lingual setting, we evaluate two pre-
trained embeddings for Basque.

The first word embeddings for Basque were cal-
culated by the Ixa Group on the Elhuyar web Cor-
pus6 (Leturia, 2012), Elhuyar Web Corpus size is
around 124 million word forms and it was auto-
matically built by scraping the web, using Gen-
sim’s (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010) word2vec skip-
gram (Mikolov et al., 2013), with 350 dimensions,
negative sampling and using a window of size 5.

We also evaluated the FasText word embed-
dings made available for 157 languages (includ-
ing Basque). They were trained on Common
Crawl and Wikipedia (Grave et al., 2018), using
CBOW with position-weights, in dimension 300,
with character n-grams of length 5, a window of
size 5, and 10 negatives. 7

These embeddings are monolingual, we only
use them in the monolingual setting on Basque.
For cross-lingual experiments, we need multilin-
gual word embeddings, that is a representation
where the words of different languages are embed-
ded within the same vectorial space.

In order to obtain the bilingual word embed-
dings needed for our experiments, we mapped
Basque and English, Spanish, Portuguese pair-
wise, using the FastText pre-trained word em-
beddings. These mappings were performed us-
ing VecMap with a semi-supervised configura-
tion, where cognates, identical words in both lan-
guages, were used as seed dictionary (Artetxe
et al., 2018).

5 Settings

Hyper-parameters: We optimize the following
hyper-parameters, using 10-fold cross-validation
with 5 runs in the monolingual setting, or directly
on the development set in the cross-lingual set-
ting or on languages other than Basque: num-
ber of iterations 1 < i < 10, learning rate
lr ∈ {0.01, 0.02}, the learning rate decay con-
stant dc ∈ {1e − 5, 1e − 6, 1e − 7, 0}, the size
of the beam ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32} and the size of
the hidden layers H ∈ {64, 128, 256}. We fixed
the number N of hidden layers to 2 as in Braud
et al. (2017).

Features: We use the same representation of the
data as in Braud et al. (2017), that is: the first three
words and the last word along with their POS and
the words in the head set (Sagae, 2009),8 features
that represent the position of the EDU in the docu-
ment and its length in tokens, a feature indicating
whether the head of the sentence is in the current
EDU or outside, and 4 indicators of the presence
of a date, a number, an amount of money and a
percentage.

As in previous studies, we used features rep-
resenting the two EDUs on the top of the stack
and the EDU on the queue. If the stack contains
CDUs, we use the nuclearity principle to choose
the head EDU, converting multi-nuclear relations
into nucleus-satellite ones as done since Sagae
(2009).

When representing words, only the first 50 di-
mensions of the pre-trained word embeddings are
kept, thus leading to an input vector of 350 dimen-
sions for the lexical part. Other features have the
following size: 16 for POS, 6 for position, 4 for
length, and 2 for other features.

The data have been parsed using UDPipe.9

8We thus have a maximum of 7 words represented per
EDU, and build a vector representing the EDU by concate-
nating the vectors for each word.

6 Evaluation

6.1 Quantitative evaluation

We report both macro- and micro-average scores,
since both have been reported in previous studies,
as noted in Morey et al. (2017) following the quan-
titative evaluation mehtod of Marcu (2000).

6.1.1 Monolingual systems for Basque

After optimization via cross-validation, the model
is trained on the entire development set (we use
the average over 5 runs to decide on the best
hyper-parameters) and evaluated on the test set.
The models are built either with randomly initial-
ized word embeddings (“Random”), or using the
embeddings built by Artetxe et al. (2018) (“Bas-
queTeam”) or the ones built using FastText (“Fast-
Text”).

Using the FastText embeddings allows to im-
prove over the state-of-the-art by 2% for the iden-
tification of the structure (“Span”), almost 5%
for the nuclearity (“Nuc”) and 5.28% for the full
structure with relations (“Rel”). Results are lower
when using the embeddings built on the Elhu-
yar corpus, probably partly because the corpus is
smaller than the one used with FastText. More-
over, it has been shown that FastText often al-
lows improvements over ‘classical’ word based
techniques to train word embeddings, such as
word2vec, since it takes into account subwords
information, thus encoding morphology. Finally,
note that even without pre-trained embeddings,
our system is a bit better than the previous one,
demonstrating that, even if the dataset is small, it
allows to build a better system than when using
a large dataset only containing data for other lan-
guages.

The best parameters on each of the 5 runs do not
vary a lot: when using embeddings ‘BasqueTeam’,
we have decay d = 1e − 05, dimension of the
hidden layer h = 256, best number of iterations
i = 10, and learning rate lr = 0.01. Only the
number of beam changes, from 1 to 16. We chose
4 in our final experiments, an average value that
also corresponds to the one used in the best run.
When using ‘FastText’, we have learning rate lr =
0.02 and decay d = 1e − 07, and with randomly
initialized embeddings, we have lr = 0.02 and
d = 1e− 06, the others being the same.

6.1.2 Cross-lingual systems for Basque (for
pairs of languages)

In the cross-lingual setting, we experiment with:
i) training a model on a source language (i.e.
English, Spanish or Portuguese), the hyper-
parameters being optimized on the development
set for Basque, or ii) training a model on an union
of the training set of a source language and the
development set for Basque, keeping the hyper-
parameters selected in the monolingual setting. In
both cases, the reported results are computed on
the Basque test set.

Table 3: Results for the mono-lingual systems built for
the source languages used in the cross-lingual setting.
The systems use the bi-lingual word embeddings built
by Artetxe et al. (2018).

As a recall, we use the multilingual word em-
beddings built by Artetxe et al. (2018). We report
the monolingual results obtained for the source
languages in Table 3, and the results for Basque
in the cross-lingual setting in Table 4.

First, we note that our results for monolingual
systems are a bit better for Portuguese and En-
glish than the ones presented in Braud et al. (2017)
when using pre-trained word embeddings. This
shows that the building of the embeddings using
FastText and crawled data leads to a more useful
word representation for the task than the ones built
on EuroParl (Levy et al., 2017), a dataset more
genre specific.

Looking at the results on Basque (Table 4), we

(2018), results on the Basque test set. ‘Src only’:
trained only on source language training data (the
hyper-parameters are optimized using the Basque de-
velopment set). ‘Src+Tgt’: trained on source language
training data + Basque development set (the hyper-
parameters are the ones used in the monolingual set-
ting).

note, however, that the results obtained within the
first cross-lingual setting (‘Src Only’) are lower
than the ones we get in the monolingual setting,
with at best 22.14% of macro-F1 (micro 21.78) for
the full structure. These results are also lower than
the ones presented in Braud et al. (2017) where
multiple corpora were merged to build a large
training set, with at best 29.5% for the full struc-
ture. This tends to show that, for the cross-lingual
strategy to succeed, one needs a lot of training
data. Note however that results were also mixed
for cross-lingual learning of discourse structure in
previous papers, using all the available data gener-
ally not leading to better results than using a small
set of data coming only from the target language.
As Iruskieta et al. (2015) and Hoek and Zufferey
(2015) showed, some texts, when conveyed in
different languages, may have different rhetorical
structures. Moreover, for Basque, we have to face
an important issue: while cross-lingual strategy
might have proven useful for English when us-
ing data for languages such as German or Span-
ish (Braud et al., 2017), Basque is an isolated lan-
guage, not pertaining to the same language family
as the other languages used.

Finally, when including the data from the
Basque development set to the training set
(‘Src+Tgt’), we obtain performance that are close
to the one obtained in the monolingual-setting
while the hyper-parameters were not directly
tuned, with at best 33.88 in macro-F1 (against
34.78 in the monolingual setting). The scores ob-
tained are largely higher than the ones obtained
with the first cross-lingual strategy, i.e. when

no Basque data is included at training time, and
also better than the ones presented in Braud et al.
(2017), i.e. no Basque data either but multiple
languages in the training set. This shows that a
cross-lingual approach might succeeds at improv-
ing discourse parsers scores, but we need to take
into account the bias between either the languages
or the corpora –since including some target data
seems essential–, and we might want to access bet-
ter cross-lingual representations.

We hypothesized that using pairs of close lan-
guages could give better performance than mix-
ing all the corpora altogether. These results
are encouraging for pursuing the investigation
of cross-lingual approaches, even if it is clear
from these results that the kind of complex struc-
tures and pragmatico-semantic relations involved
within discourse analysis are not easily transfer-
able accross languages. The difficulty of annota-
tion for discourse makes it an attractive path of re-
search.

6.2 Qualitative Evaluation and confusion
matrix

Discourse annotation (Hovy, 2010) and its eval-
uation is a challenging task (Das et al., 2017;
Iruskieta et al., 2015; Mitocariu et al., 2013;
van der Vliet, 2010; da Cunha and Iruskieta, 2010;
Maziero et al., 2009; Marcu, 2000). To understand
what this parser is doing, we followed the evalu-
ation method proposed by Iruskieta et al. (2015),
and compare our best systems in order to under-
stand what kind of RS-trees the system is produc-
ing. Note that scores per relation or confusion ma-
trices are rarely given in studies on discourse pars-
ing, while it would allow for a better and deeper
comparison of the systems developed.

6.2.1 Basque mono-lingual system
We have compared the RS-trees obtained from our
best system (FastText) with RS-trees of the Basque
gold standard corpus (Iruskieta et al., 2013). We
have followed this evaluation method because the
evaluation proposed by Marcu (2000) has defi-
ciencies in the description and some compared
factors are conflated. This carries out that the
alignment of rhetorical relations is not properly
done and the aligned labels are not always RST re-
lations, so we cannot adequately describe the con-
fusion matrix of the parser. This confusion matrix
shows where (in which rhetorical relation) is the
agreement and the disagreement (see Table 6).

Central unit agreement: Furthermore, we have
detected that sometimes parsers that have been
trained within a genre do not label the central unit
(CU) or the most important EDU of the RS-tree
properly if it is parsing another genre. We think as
Iruskieta et al. (2014) that structures with the same
CU shows more agreement in rhetorical relations
and they are more reliable. Therefore, we think
that CU annotation is another evaluation factor to
take into account.

ZTF 1 0 6 7 0.143

SENT 3 0 6 9 0.333

Total 6 1 31 38 0.171

Table 5: Central Unit reliability

The results obtained in Table 5 regarding the
CU agreement are much lower than those obtained
by CU detectors in Bengoetxea et al. (2017). The
reliability of this CU detector goes from 0.54 to
0.57 regarding the train or test data-set. We think
that this disagreement is due to the fact that the
parser follows left to right or bottom-up annotation
style; whereas Bengoetxea et al. (2017) propose a
top-down annotation style to detect the CU after
segmenting the text.10

Confusion matrix: The quantitative evaluation
gives the agreement rate between the gold stan-
dard (or human annotation) and the parser, but it
does not describe in which rhetorical relation is
this agreement and if the confusion matrix is sim-
ilar to those obtained by two human annotators.

Here we will compare human’s confusion ma-
trix against the machine’s confusion matrix (see
Table 6) in order to identify on which relations
they agree.

When we compare the parser’s and human’s an-
notations, we can identify interesting differences.
As Table 7 shows, the agreement is mostly in the
general and most used ELABORATION relation
(101 of 164).11 There was a match in other re-

Table 6: Confusion matrix of the Basque monolin-
gual parser: gold standard in files and parser output in
columns. Agreement in bold

However, when we compare humans’ annota-
tions (Iruskieta et al., 2013) the agreement is sig-
nificant (Fleiss Kappa) in other relations such as
PURPOSE, PREPARATION, CIRCUMSTANCE,
CONCESSION, CONDITION, LIST, DISJUNC-
TION, RESTATEMENT and MEANS. In con-
trast, ELABORATION has shown weak inter-
annotator agreement along with BACKGROUND,
SEQUENCE, CAUSE, RESULT, CONTRAST
and CONJUNCTION.

To have a better look at the parser, we can also
look at its confusion matrix, in order to describe
the most confused relations.

relations (in the semantic scale of RRs (Kort-
mann, 1991)), such as: ELABORATION, BACK-
GROUND and JOINT. On the contrary, the agree-
ment between humans lies in much more relations
and more informative ones, because they try to be
exhaustive, and they rather disagree on general,
widely used and less informative relations, such
as ELABORATION, LIST, BACKGROUND, RE-
SULT and MEANS. Disagreement in ELABORA-
TION is slightly bigger or more confused between
humans (162 of 267: 0.343 F1 agreement) than be-
tween human-machine (101 of 314: 0.321) but the
big differences are in some uncommon relations,
such as JOINT that was annotated only on 3 oc-
casions in Basque treebank, but the system used
widely without success (1 of 192: 0.005). Simi-
larly, LIST was confused widely (0 of 114: 0.00).

6.2.2 Portuguese mono-lingual system
Concerning the Portuguese mono-lingual system,
we followed the same evaluation method (Iruski-
eta et al., 2015) and investigated in which rhetori-
cal relation our system matches with the gold stan-
dard anotation.

In Table 9 we show the relations, and frequen-
cies, for which we have an agreement between the
Portuguese gold standard corpus and our mono-
lingual Portuguese parser.

First of all, we see that agreement is mainly in
ELABORATION and ATTRIBUTION,12 the most

used relations. Besides, the system tags other rela-
tions such as EXPLANATION and CONTRAST.

If we compare these results with the results ob-
tained from the Basque corpus, we can see some
interesting things. For example, we can notice
that, in the Basque corpus, there are some opin-
ionative texts and the system could learn it us-
ing EVALUATION, and in the Portuguese corpus,
there is much ATTRIBUTION relation, because
some of the analysed texts were collected from
newspapers and this relation is common in this
genre and this tag was used in the annotation cam-
paign.

Finally, in Table 10 we show in which relation is
the agreement for the cross-lingual system trained
on Portuguese and evaluated on Basque.

As we can see in Table 10 the system has used
only one relation adequately and this relation is the
most used and general one. i.e. the ELABORA-
TION relation.

7 Results and Future work

This paper presents the first discourse parser for
Basque. Regarding the reliability of the parser, we
get promising results while relying on a very small
dataset. We also show that results can be improved
with more data, as performance for languages with
larger datasets are higher. In this work, we con-
duct a multilingual experiment to augment train-
ing data and get better results for Basque. Even if
our cross-lingual system did not improve over the
monolingual one, we believe that this path of re-
search should be pursued, in parallel to annotating
more data.

Moreover we evaluated quantitatively, but also
qualitatively our system, in order to get a better
understanding of how this first Basque RST parser
works, and how far it is from human behaviour.
We hope that this will help us to design a better
discourse parser for Basque.

other annotation campaigns) ATTRIBUTION is not consid-
ered a rhetorical relation.

We underlined that the parser does not label
properly the CU and uses a set of fixed rhetorical
relations to get the best results, whereas humans
try to get a better description and the confusion
matrix pinpoint to more informative relations. In
future work, we plan to improve on central unit
detection, to evaluate a top-down approach, and to
move from predicting very general and uninforma-
tive relations to a system able to identify the more
interesting relations despite class imbalance.

This first RST parser for Basque represents a
step forward to the use of discourse information
in summarisation (Atutxa et al., 2017), sentiment
analysis (Alkorta et al., 2017) and in many other
advanced tasks.

Moreover, authors are currently striving to an-
notate more Basque data, to improve the system.
One hope is to get performance reliable enough
to provide an interesting pre-annotation that could
make the whole annotation process easier and
faster.
