Abstract

It is generally believed that a metaphor
tends to have a stronger emotional im-
pact than a literal statement; however,
there is no quantitative study establishing
the extent to which this is true. Further,
the mechanisms through which metaphors
convey emotions are not well understood.
We present the first data-driven study
comparing the emotionality of metaphor-
ical expressions with that of their literal
counterparts. Our results indicate that
metaphorical usages are, on average, sig-
nificantly more emotional than literal us-
ages. We also show that this emotional
content is not simply transferred from the
source domain into the target, but rather is
a result of meaning composition and inter-
action of the two domains in the metaphor.

1 Introduction

Metaphor gives our expression color, shape and
character. Metaphorical language is a result of
complex knowledge projection from one domain,
typically a physical, closely experienced one, to
another, typically more abstract and vague one
(Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). For instance, when
we say “He shot down all of my arguments”, we
project knowledge and inferences from the domain
of battle (the source domain) onto our reasoning
about arguments and debates (the target domain).
While preserving the core meaning of the sen-
tence, the use of metaphor allows us to introduce
additional connotations and emphasize certain as-
pects of the target domain, while downplaying oth-
ers. Consider the following examples:

(1) a. The new measures are strangling business.

b. The new measures tightly regulate business.

When we talk about “strangling business” in (1a)
we express a distinct viewpoint on governmental
regulation of business, as opposed to a more neu-
tral factual statement expressed in (1b).

The interplay of metaphor and emotion has been
an object of interest in fields such as linguistics
(Blanchette et al., 2001; Kovecses, 2003), polit-
ical science (Lakoff and Wehling, 2012), cogni-
tive psychology (Crawford, 2009; Thibodeau and
Boroditsky, 2011) and neuroscience (Aziz-Zadeh
and Damasio, 2008; Jabbi et al., 2008). A num-
ber of computational approaches for sentiment po-
larity classification of metaphorical language have
also been proposed (Veale and Li, 2012; Kozareva,
2013; Strzalkowski et al., 2014). However, there
is no quantitative study establishing the extent to
which metaphorical language is used to express
emotion nor a data-supported account of the mech-
anisms by which this happens.

Our study addresses two questions: (i) whether
a metaphorical statement is likely to convey a
stronger emotional content than its literal coun-
terpart; and (ii) how this emotional content arises
in the metaphor, i.e. whether it comes from the
source domain, or from the target domain, or
rather arises compositionally through interaction
of the source and the target. To answer these ques-
tions, we conduct a series of experiments, in which
human subjects are asked to judge metaphoricity
and emotionality of a sentence in a range of set-
tings. We test two experimental hypotheses.

Hypothesis 1: metaphorical uses of words
tend to convey more emotion than their
literal paraphrases in the same context.

Hypothesis 2: the metaphorical sense of a
word tends to carry more emotion than
the literal sense of the same word.

To test Hypothesis 1, we compare the emotional
content of a metaphorically used word to that of

23



its literal paraphrase in a fixed context, as in the
following example.

(2) a. Hillary brushed off the accusations.

b. Hillary dismissed the accusations.

To test Hypothesis 2, we compare the emotional
content of the metaphorical sense of a word to a
literal sense of that same word in its literal context,
as follows.

(3) a. Hillary brushed off the accusations.

b. He brushed off the snow.

Here, brushed off is metaphorical in the context of
“accusations” but literal in the context of “snow”.

Our experiments focus on metaphors expressed
by a verb, since this is the most frequent type of
metaphor, according to corpus studies (Cameron,
2003; Shutova and Teufel, 2010). In order to ob-
tain a sufficient coverage across metaphorical and
literal verb senses we extract our data from Word-
Net. For 1639 senses of 440 verbs, we anno-
tate their usage as metaphorical or literal using the
crowdsourcing platform, CrowdFlower1. We then
create datasets of pairs of these usages to test Hy-
potheses 1 and 2.

Our results support both hypotheses, providing
evidence that metaphor is an important mecha-
nism for expressing emotions. Further, the fact
that metaphorical uses of words tend to carry more
emotion than their literal uses indicates that the
emotional content is not simply transferred from
the source domain into the target, but rather is
a result of meaning composition and interaction
of the two domains in the metaphor. For this
project, we created a dataset in which verb senses
are annotated for both metaphoricity and emo-
tionality. In addition, the metaphorical uses are
paired with their human-validated interpretations
in the form of literal paraphrases. We have made
this dataset freely available online.2 We expect
that this dataset, the first of its kind, will find
many applications in NLP, including the develop-
ment and testing of metaphor identification and in-
terpretation systems, modeling regular polysemy
in word sense disambiguation, distinguishing be-
tween near-synonyms in natural language genera-
tion, and, not least, the development of sentiment
analysis systems that can operate on real-world,
metaphor-rich texts.

2 Related Work

Word sense, metaphor and emotion: The stan-
dard approach to word sense disambiguation
(WSD) is to develop a model for each polyse-
mous word (Navigli, 2009). The model for a word
predicts the intended sense, based on context. A
problem with this approach to WSD is that good
coverage of common polysemous English words
would require about 3,200 distinct models. Kil-
garriff (1997) has argued there are systematic re-
lations among word senses across different words,
focusing in particular on metaphor as a ubiqui-
tous source of polysemy. This area of research
is known as regular polysemy. Thus, there is a
systematic relation between metaphor and word
sense (Kilgarriff, 1997; Turney et al., 2011) and
the emotion associated with a word depends on the
sense of the word (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004;
Mohammad and Turney, 2013).3 This raises the
question of whether there is a systematic relation
between presence of metaphor and the emotional
content of words. As far as we know, this is the
first paper to quantitatively explore this question.

Gibbs et al. (2002) conducted a study that
looked at how listeners respond to metaphor and
irony when they are played audio tapes describing
emotional experiences. They found that on aver-
age metaphors were rated as being more emotional
than non-metaphoric expressions. However, that
work did not compare paraphrase pairs that dif-
fered in just one word (metaphorically or literally
used) and thus did not control for context. Citron
and Goldberg (2014) compared metaphorical and
literal sentences differing only in one word, and
found that metaphorical sentences led to more ac-
tivity in the the amygdala and the anterior portion
of the hippocampus. They hypothesized that this
is because metaphorical sentences are more emo-
tionally engaging than literal sentences.

Metaphor annotation: Metaphor annotation
studies have typically been corpus-based and in-
volved either continuous annotation of metaphor-
ical language (i.e., distinguishing between literal
and metaphorical uses of words in a given text),
or search for instances of a specific metaphor in
a corpus and an analysis thereof. The majority
of corpus-linguistic studies were concerned with
metaphorical expressions and mappings within a
limited domain, e.g., WAR, BUSINESS, FOOD or

3Words used in different senses convey different affect.

PLANT metaphors (Santa Ana, 1999; Izwaini,
2003; Koller, 2004; Skorczynska Sznajder and
Pique-Angordans, 2004; Lu and Ahrens, 2008;
Low et al., 2010; Hardie et al., 2007), in a partic-
ular genre or type of discourse (Charteris-Black,
2000; Cameron, 2003; Lu and Ahrens, 2008; Mar-
tin, 2006; Beigman Klebanov and Flor, 2013).

Two recent studies (Steen et al., 2010; Shutova
and Teufel, 2010) moved away from investigat-
ing particular domains to a more general study
of how metaphor behaves in unrestricted con-
tinuous text. Steen and colleagues (Pragglejaz
Group, 2007; Steen et al., 2010) proposed a
metaphor identification procedure (MIP), in which
every word is tagged as literal or metaphorical,
based on whether it has a “more basic mean-
ing” in other contexts than the current one. The
basic meaning was defined as “more concrete;
related to bodily action; more precise (as op-
posed to vague); historically older” and its iden-
tification was guided by dictionary definitions.
Shutova and Teufel (2010) extended MIP to the
identification of conceptual metaphors along with
the linguistic ones. Lönneker (2004) investi-
gated metaphor annotation in lexical resources.
Their Hamburg Metaphor Database contains ex-
amples of metaphorical expressions in German
and French, which are mapped to senses from Eu-
roWordNet4 and annotated with source–target do-
main mappings taken from the Master Metaphor
List (Lakoff et al., 1991).

Emotion annotation: Sentiment analysis is de-
fined as detecting the evaluative or affective atti-
tude in text. A vast majority of work in sentiment
analysis has focused on developing classifiers for
valence prediction (Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Dong
et al., 2014; Socher et al., 2013; Mohammad et
al., 2013), i.e., determining whether a piece of text
expresses positive, negative, or neutral attitude.
However, there is a growing interest in detecting a
wider range of emotions such as joy, sadness, op-
timism, etc. (Holzman and Pottenger, 2003; Alm
et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2013; Mohammad,
2012). Much of the this work has been influenced
by the idea that some emotions are more basic
than others (Ekman, 1992; Ekman and Friesen,
2003; Plutchik, 1980; Plutchik, 1991). Moham-
mad (2012) polled the Twitter API for tweets that
have hashtag words such as #anger and #sadness
corresponding to the eight Plutchik basic emo-

4http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet/

tions. He showed that these hashtag words act as
good labels for the rest of the tweets. Suttles and
Ide (2013) used a similar distant supervision tech-
nique and collected tweets with emoticons, emoji,
and hashtag words corresponding to the Plutchik
emotions. Emotions have also been annotated in
lexical resources such as the Affective Norms for
English Words, the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mo-
hammad and Turney, 2013), and WordNet Affect
(Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004). The annotated
corpora mentioned above have largely been used
as training and test sets, and the lexicons have
been used to provide features for emotion classifi-
cation. (See Mohammad (2016) for a survey on af-
fect datasets.) None of this work explicitly studied
the interaction between metaphor and emotions.

3 Experimental Setup

To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, we extracted pairs
of metaphorical and literal instances from Word-
Net. In WordNet, each verb sense corresponds to a
synset, which consists of a set of near-synonyms, a
gloss (a brief definition), and one or more example
sentences that show the usage of one or more of
the near-synonyms. We will refer to each of these
sentences as the verb-sense sentence, or just sen-
tence. The portion of the sentence excluding the
target verb will be called the context. We will refer
to each pair of target verb and verb-sense sentence
as an instance. We extracted the following types
of instances from WordNet:

Instance 1
Target verb: erase

Sentence: The Turks erased the Armenians.

Here, erase is used metaphorically. We will refer
to such instances as metaphorical instances.

Now consider an instance similar to the one
above, but where the target verb is replaced by its
near-synonym or hypernym. For example:

Instance 2
Target verb: kill

Sentence: The Turks killed the Armenians.

The sentence in Instance 2 has a different target
verb (although with a very similar meaning to the
first) and an identical context w.r.t. Instance 1.
However, in this instance, the target verb is used
literally. We will refer to such instances as literal
instances. To test Hypothesis 1, we will compare
pairs such as Instance 1–Instance 2. We will then
ask human annotators to examine these instances

25



both individually and in pairs to determine how
much emotion the target verbs convey in the sen-
tences.

Another instance of the verb erase, correspond-
ing to a different sense, is shown below:

Instance 3
Target verb: erase

Sentence: Erase the formula on the blackboard.

This instance contains a literal use of erase. To
test Hypothesis 2, we will compare pairs such as
Instance 1–Instance 3 that have the same target
verb, but different contexts such that one instance
is metaphorical and another is literal. We will ask
human annotators to examine these instances both
individually and in pairs to determine how much
emotion the target verbs convey in the sentences.

In the sub-sections below, we describe: (3.1)
How we compiled instance pairs to test Hypothe-
ses 1 and 2. This involved annotating instances
as metaphorical or literal. (3.2) How we anno-
tated pairs of instances to determine which is more
metaphorical. (3.3) How we annotated instances
for emotionality. And finally, (3.4) how we anno-
tated pairs of instances to determine which is more
emotional.

3.1 Compiling pairs of instances

In order to create datasets of pairs such as In-
stance 1–Instance 2 and Instance 1–Instance 3, we
first determine whether WordNet verb instances
are metaphorical or literal. Specifically, we chose
verbs with at least three senses (so that there
is a higher chance of at least one sense being
metaphorical) and less than ten senses (to avoid
highly ambiguous verbs). In total, 440 verbs sat-
isfied this criterion, yielding 1639 instances. We
took example sentences directly from WordNet
and automatically checked to make sure that the
verb appeared in the gloss and the example sen-
tence. In cases where the example sentence did
not contain the focus word, we ignored the synset.
We used the Questionnaire 1 to annotate these in-
stances for metaphoricity:

Questionnaire 1: Literal or Metaphorical?

Instructions

You will be given a focus word and a sentence that contains
the focus word (highlighted in bold). You will be asked to
rate whether the focus word is used in a literal sense or a
metaphorical sense in that sentence. Below are some typical
properties of metaphorical and literal senses:

Literal usages tend to be:
- more basic, straightforward meaning; more physical,
closely tied to our senses: vision, hearing, touching, tasting

Metaphorical usages tend to be:
- more complex; more distant from our senses; more abstract;
more vague; often surprising; tend to bring in imagery from
a different domain

Example 1

Focus Word: shoot down
Sentence: The enemy shot down several of our aircraft.

Question: In the above sentence, is the focus word used in a
literal sense or a metaphorical sense?

- the focus word’s usage is metaphorical
- the focus word’s usage is literal

Solution: the focus word’s usage is literal

Example 2

Focus Word: shoot down
Sentence: He shot down the student’s proposal.

Question: In the above sentence, is the focus word used in a
literal sense or a metaphorical sense?

- the focus word’s usage is metaphorical
- the focus word’s usage is literal

Solution: the focus word’s usage is metaphorical

Your Task

Focus Word: answer
Sentence: This steering wheel answers to the slightest touch.

In the above sentence, is the focus word used in a literal
sense or a metaphorical sense?
- the focus word’s usage is metaphorical
- the focus word’s usage is literal

This questionnaire, and all of the others de-
scribed ahead in this paper, were annotated
through the crowdsourcing platform Crowd-
Flower. The instances in all of these question-
naires were presented in random order. Each in-
stance was annotated by at least ten annotators.
CrowdFlower chooses the majority response as the
answer to each question. For our experiments, we
chose a stronger criterion for an instance to be con-
sidered metaphorical or literal – 70% or more of
the annotators had to agree on the choice of the
category. The instances for which this level of
agreement was not reached were discarded from
further analysis. This strict criterion was chosen so
that greater confidence can be placed on the results
obtained from the annotations. Nonetheless, we
release the full set of 1,639 annotated instances for
other uses and further research. Additionally, we
selected only those instances whose focus verbs
had at least one metaphorical sense (or instance)
and at least one literal sense (or instance). This
resulted in a Master Set of 176 metaphorical in-
stances and 284 literal instances.

26



3.1.1 Instances to test Hypothesis 1
For each of the 176 metaphorical instances in the
Master Set, the three authors of this paper inde-
pendently chose a synonym of the target verb that
would make the instance literal. For example, for
Instance 1 shown earlier, kill was chosen as syn-
onym of erase (forming Instance 2). The synonym
was chosen either from the list of near-synonyms
in the same synset as the target word or from
WordNet hypernyms of the target word. The three
authors discussed amongst themselves to resolve
disagreements. Five instances were discarded be-
cause of lack of agreement. Thus corresponding to
each of the remaining 171 metaphorical instances,
171 literal instances were generated that had non-
identical, similar meaning target verbs, but iden-
tical contexts. This set of 171 pairs of instances
forms the dataset used to test Hypothesis 1, and we
will refer to these instance pairs as the Hypothesis
1 Pairs and to the set of 342 (171×2) instances as
the Hypothesis 1 Instances.

3.1.2 Instances to test Hypothesis 2
In order to test Hypothesis 2, we compare in-
stances with the same target verb, but correspond-
ing to its different senses. We use all of the 460
(176+284) instances in the Master Set, and refer to
them as Hypothesis 2 Instances. As for Hypoth-
esis 1, we also group these instances into pairs.
For each of the verbs in the Master Set, all pos-
sible pairs of metaphorical and literal instances
were generated. For example, if a verb had two
metaphorical instances and three literal instances,
then 2 × 3 = 6 pairs of instances were generated.
In total, 355 pairs of instances were generated. We
will refer to his set of instance pairs as Hypothe-
sis 2 Cross Pairs (pairs in which one instance is
labeled metaphoric and the other is literal).

Rather than viewing instances as either
metaphorical or literal, one may also consider a
graded notion of metaphoricity. That is, on a scale
from most literal to most metaphorical, instances
may have different degrees of metaphoricity (or
literalness). Therefore, we also evaluate pairs
where the individual instances have not been ex-
plicitly labeled as metaphorical or literal; instead,
they have been marked according to whether one
instance is more metaphorical than the other. For
each of the verbs in the Master Set, all possible
pairs of instances were generated. For example,
if a verb had five instances in the Master Set,
then ten pairs of instances were generated. This

resulted in 629 pairs in total. We will refer to
them as Hypothesis 2 All Pairs (all possible pairs
of instances, without regard to their labels).

3.2 Relative metaphoricity annotation

For each of the pairs in both Hypothesis 2 Cross
Pairs and in Hypothesis 2 All Pairs, we ask an-
notators which instance is more metaphorical, as
shown in Questionnaire 2 below:

Questionnaire 2: Which is more metaphorical?

Instructions

You will be given two sentences with similar meanings.
Each sentence contains a focus word. You will be asked to
compare how the focus words are used in the two sentences.
You will be asked to decide whether the focus word’s usage
in one sentence is more metaphorical than the focus word’s
usage in the other sentence.

– Description of metaphorical and literal usages same as in
Questionnaire 1 (not repeated here due to space constraints)–

Your Task

Focus Word 1: attack
Sentence 1: I attacked the problem as soon as I was up.
Focus word 2: attack
Sentence 2: The Serbs attacked the village at night.

Which is more metaphorical?
- focus word’s usage in the sentence 1 is more metaphorical
- the focus word’s usage in sentence 2 is more metaphorical
- the usages in the two sentences are equally metaphorical or
equally literal

The instance pairs within a question were pre-
sented in random order. The questions themselves
were also in random order.

3.3 Absolute emotion annotation

For each of the Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2
instances, we used responses to Questionnaire 3
shown below to determine if the target verb con-
veys an emotion in the sentence.

Questionnaire 3: Does the focus word convey emotion?

Instructions

You will be given a focus word and a sentence that includes
the focus word. You will be asked to rate whether the focus
word conveys some emotion in the sentence.

Your Task

Focus Word: answer
Sentence: This steering wheel answers to the slightest touch.

How much emotion is conveyed?
- the focus word conveys some emotion
- the focus word conveys no emotion

27



3.4 Relative emotion annotation

Just as instances can have degrees of metaphoric-
ity, they can have degrees of emotion. Thus, for
each of the Hypothesis 1 Pairs we asked annota-
tors to mark which instance is more emotional, as
shown in Questionnaire 4 below:

Questionnaire 4: Which of the two given sentences
conveys more emotion?

Instructions

You will be given two sentences with similar meanings.
Each sentence contains a focus word. You will be asked to
compare how the focus words are used in the two sentences
and whether the focus word conveys more emotion in one
sentence than in the other sentence.

Your Task

Focus Word 1: attack
Sentence 1: I attacked the problem as soon as I was up.
Focus word 2: start
Sentence 2: I started on the problem as soon as I was up.

Which conveys more emotion?
- focus word in first sentence conveys more emotion
- focus word in second sentence conveys more emotion
- focus words in the two sentences convey a similar degree
of emotion

The order in which the instance pairs were pre-
sented for annotation was determined by random
selection. Whether the metaphorical or the literal
instance of a pair was chosen as the first instance
shown in the question was also determined by ran-
dom selection. The same questionnaire was used
for Hypothesis 2 pairs as well.

4 Results and data analysis

4.1 Hypothesis 1 results

An analysis of the responses to Questionnaire 3
for the Hypothesis 1 instances is shown in Ta-
ble 1. Recall that the annotators were given 342 in-
stances where half were metaphoric and half were
literal. Additionally each literal instance was cre-
ated by replacing the target verb in a metaphorical
instance with a synonym of the target verb. Recall
also that the 342 instances were presented in ran-
dom order. Table 1 shows that a markedly higher
number of metaphorical instances (39.8%) are
considered emotional than literal ones (16.1%).
Fisher’s exact test shows that this difference is sig-
nificant with greater than 95% confidence5.

5In the following experiments, we use Fisher’s exact test
for two-by-two tables of event counts and we use the bino-
mial exact test (i.e., the Clopper-Pearson interval) for binary
(heads/tails) event counts (Agresti, 1996).

or not emotional) for Hypothesis 1 Instances (342
instances – 171 metaphorical and 171 literal).

# instances that are:
emotional 191 (55.8%)
not emotional 151 (44.2%)

Total 342 (100%)

# instances that are:

metaphorical and not emotional 35 (10.2%)
literal and emotional 55 (16.1%)
literal and not emotional 116 (33.9%)

Total 342 (100%)

Table 2: Summary of responses to Q4 (which is
more emotional) for Hypothesis 1 Pairs (171 pairs
of metaphorical and literal instances).

# instances that are:
metaphorical and more emotional 143 (83.6%)
literal and more emotional 17 (09.9%)
similarly emotional 11 (06.4%)

Total 171 (100%)

An analysis of the responses to Questionnaire
4 for the Hypothesis 1 pairs is shown in Table 2.
Here, the annotators were given pairs of instances
where one is metaphorical and one is literal (and
the two instances differ only in the target verb),
and the annotators were asked to determine which
instance is more emotional. Metaphorical in-
stances were again predominantly marked as more
emotional (83.6%) than their literal counterparts
(9.9%). This difference is significant with greater
than 95% confidence, using the binomial exact
test. Thus, results from both experiments support
Hypothesis 1.

4.2 Hypothesis 2 results

Table 3 shows an analysis of the responses to
Questionnaire 3 for the Hypothesis 2 instances.
Recall that the annotators were given 460 in-
stances where 176 were metaphoric and 284 were
literal. The data corresponds to verbs that have
both metaphorical and literal senses. The various
instances generated for each verb have the same
focus verb but different context (verb-sense sen-
tence). The 460 instances were again presented
in random order. Table 3 shows that a markedly
higher number of metaphorical instances are con-
sidered emotional (14.1%), whereas much fewer
of the literal instances are considered emotional
(3.7%). This difference is significant with greater
than 95% confidence, using Fisher’s exact test.

metaphorical and not emotional 111 (24.1%)

Total 460 (100%)

Hypothesis 2 All Pairs received lower over-
all emotionality scores than Hypothesis 1 Pairs.
Some variation is expected because the two
datasets are not identical. Additionally, when
an annotator finds the same word in many literal
(non-emotional contexts) as in the Hypothesis 2
setup (but not in Hypothesis 1 setup), then they
are less likely to tell us that the same word, even
though now used in a metaphorical context, is con-
veying emotion. Despite the lower overall emo-
tionality of Hypothesis 2 All Pairs, our hypoth-
esis that metaphorical instances are more emo-
tional than the literal ones still holds. Further,
experiments with pairs of emotions (described be-
low) avoid the kind of bias mentioned above, and
also demonstrate the higher relative emotionality
of metaphorical instances.

Table 4 shows the analysis for Hypothesis 2
Cross Pairs in the relative emotion annotation set-
ting. The annotators were given pairs of in-
stances where one is metaphorical and one is lit-
eral (and the two instances have the same focus
verb in different context). The annotators were
asked to determine which instance is more emo-
tional. Metaphorical instances were marked as be-
ing more emotional than their literal counterparts
in 59.4% of cases. Literal instances were marked
as more emotional only in 8.7% of cases. This dif-
ference is significant with greater than 95% confi-
dence, using the binomial exact test.

An analysis of the responses to Questionnaire
4 for the Hypothesis 2 All Pairs is shown in Ta-
ble 5. This dataset included all possible pairs of
instances associated with each verb in the Master
Set. Thus in addition to pairs where one is highly
metaphorical and one highly literal, this set also
includes pairs where both instances may be highly
metaphorical or both highly literal. Observe that

once again a higher number of instances that were
marked as more metaphorical were also marked as
being more emotional (than less or similarly emo-
tional). This difference is significant with greater
than 95% confidence (binomial exact test).

Overall, these results support Hypothesis 2, that
metaphorical senses of the same word tend to carry
more emotion than its literal senses. Figure 1
demonstrates the complete annotation cycle (Q1

5 Discussion

It is generally believed that the senses of a word
can be divided into a metaphorical subset and a
literal subset (Kilgarriff, 1997). It is easy to find
examples of this particular pattern of polysemy,
but a few examples do not justify the claim that
this pattern is a widespread regularity. The annota-
tions of our dataset confirm the hypothesis that the
metaphorical/literal distinction is a common pat-
tern for polysemous verbs (as many as 38% of all
verb senses we annotated were metaphorical). As
far as we know, this is the first study that gives
a solid empirical foundation to the belief that the
metaphorical/literal distinction is a central form of
regular polysemy.

Furthermore, the annotated dataset can be used
for research into the nature of metaphorical/literal
regular polysemy. Previous research on metaphor
annotation identified metaphorical uses of words
in text, thus analysing data for only one sense at a
time. In contrast, our dataset allows one to anal-
yse a range of metaphorical and literal uses of the
same word, potentially shedding light on the ori-
gins of regular polysemy and metaphor. Such a
structure of the dataset also provides a new frame-
work for computational modelling of metaphor. A
system able to systematically capture metaphori-
cal sense extensions will be in a better position to
generalise to unseen metaphors rather than a sys-
tem trained on individual examples of metaphori-
cal word uses in their specific contexts. The large
size and coverage across many senses makes this
dataset particularly attractive for computational
modeling of metaphor. Our analysis also sug-
gests that the work on emotion detection in text
may be useful to support algorithms for handling
metaphorical sense extension. Perhaps emotion
analysis may yield insights into other forms of reg-
ular polysemy (Boleda et al., 2012).

We hypothesized that literal paraphrases tend to
express less emotion than their metaphorical coun-

terparts. This conjecture is related to Hypothesis
1. All of the sentence pairs that we used to test
Hypothesis 1 are essentially a special type of para-
phrase, in which only one word is varied. The re-
sults in Section 4.1 support Hypothesis 1, and thus
they lend some degree of support to our hypothe-
sis about paraphrases. It might be argued that we
have only tested a special case of paraphrase, and
we agree that further experiments are needed, with
more general types of paraphrase (including, for
instance, multi-word paraphrases). We leave this
as a topic for future work. However, our results
confirm the validity of our hypothesis with respect
to metaphorical and literal lexical substitutes.

The results of our experiments are also rele-
vant to many other NLP tasks modelling lexical
meaning, for instance, natural language genera-
tion (NLG). It can be difficult to make the cor-
rect choice among several near-synonyms in NLG
(Inkpen and Hirst, 2006); for example, the near-
synonyms error, mistake, slip, and blunder con-
vey the same core meaning but have different con-
notations. The degree to which two words are
near-synonyms is proportional to the degree to
which one can substitute for another in a given
context (Inkpen and Hirst, 2006). Substituting
a metaphoric term with a literal one tends to
change the meaning of the sentence in an im-
portant respect—its emotional content. The de-
gree of metaphor in the generated sentences would
thus become an important factor in selecting the
most appropriate candidate in NLG. It follows
from Hypothesis 1 that terms with the same de-
gree of metaphor will be more substitutable than
terms with different degrees of metaphor. There-
fore NLG systems can benefit from taking the de-
gree of metaphor into account.

Our experiments and data also provide new in-
sights into the nature of metaphorical emotions.
Our results confirm both hypotheses, supporting
the claim that metaphorical uses of words carry
stronger emotions than their literal uses, as well

as their literal paraphrases. This suggests that
emotional content is not merely a property of
the source or the target domain (and the respec-
tive word senses), but rather it arises through
metaphorical composition. Figure 2 shows some
examples of this phenomenon in our dataset. This
is the first such finding, and it highlights the im-
portance of metaphor as a mechanism for express-
ing emotion. This, in turn, suggests that joint mod-
els of metaphor and emotion are needed in order to
create real-world systems for metaphor interpreta-
tion, as well as for sentiment analysis. All of the
data created as part of this project, as summarized
in Table 6, is made freely available.6

6 Conclusions

This paper confirms the general belief that
metaphorical language tends to have a stronger
emotional impact than literal language. As far as
we know, our study is the first attempt to clearly
formulate and test this belief. We formulated two
hypotheses regarding emotionality of metaphors.
Hypothesis 1: metaphorical uses of words tend to

convey more emotion than their literal paraphrases
in the same context. Hypothesis 2: the metaphor-
ical sense of a word tends to carry more emotion
than the literal sense of the same word. We con-
ducted systematic experiments to show that both
hypotheses are true for verb metaphors. A further
contribution of this work is to the areas of senti-
ment analysis and metaphor detection. At training
time, sentiment classifiers could, for example, use
the information that a particular word or expres-
sion is metaphorical as a feature, and similarly,
metaphor detection systems could use the infor-
mation that a particular word or expression con-
veys sentiment as a feature.

The results are significant for the study of reg-
ular polysemy as the senses of many verbs read-
ily divide into literal and metaphorical groups. We
hope that research in regular polysemy will be able
to build on the datasets that we have released. Our
results also support the idea that a metaphor con-
veys emotion that goes beyond the source and tar-
get domains taken separately. The act of bridg-
ing the two domains creates something new, be-
yond the component domains. This remains a
rich topic for further research. Finally, we hope
that the results in this paper will encourage greater
collaboration between the Natural Language Pro-
cessing research communities in sentiment analy-
sis and metaphor analysis. All of the data anno-
tated for metaphoricity and emotionality is made
freely available.
