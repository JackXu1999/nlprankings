Abstract

Natural language processing tools are used
to automatically detect disturbances in tran-
scribed speech of schizophrenia inpatients
who speak Hebrew. We measure topic muta-
tion over time and show that controls main-
tain more cohesive speech than inpatients. We
also examine differences in how inpatients and
controls use adjectives and adverbs to describe
content words and show that the ones used
by controls are more common than the those
of inpatients. We provide experimental re-
sults and show their potential for automatically
detecting schizophrenia in patients by means
only of their speech patterns.

1 Introduction

Thought disorders are described as disturbances in
the normal way of thinking. Bleuler (1991) orig-
inal considered thought disorders to be a speech
impairment in schizophrenia patients, but nowa-
days there is agreement that thought disorders are
also relevant to other clinical disorders, including
pediatric neurobehavioral disorders like attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder and high functioning
autism. They can even occur in normal popula-
tions, especially in people who have a high level

of creativity. Bleuler focused mostly on “loosen-
ing of associations”, or derailment, a thought dis-
order characterized by the usage of unrelated con-
cepts in a conversation, or in other words, a con-
versation lacking coherence. The Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5)
(Association, 2013) outlines disorganized speech
as one of the criteria for making a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. Morice and Ingram (1982) showed
that schizophrenics’ speech is built upon a dif-
ferent syntactic structure than normal controls,
and that this difference increases over time. An-
dreasen (1979) suggested several definitions of
linguistic and cognitive behaviors frequently ob-
served in patients, and which may be useful for
thought-disorder evaluation. Among the defini-
tions presented in that report, one finds the follow-
ing, which we address in this study:

Incoherence, also known as “word salad”, refers
to speech that is incomprehensible at times due to
multiple grammatical and semantic inaccuracies.
In this paper, we focus mostly on the semantic in-
accuracies, leaving grammatical issues for future
investigation.

Derailment, also known as “loose associations”,
happens when a speaker shifts among topics that
are only remotely related, or are completely unre-
lated, to the previous ones.

Tangentiality occurs when an irrelevant, or just
barely relevant, answer is provided for a given
question.

We focus here on derailment. But tangentiality
has been addressed in some other studies. The two
notions are closely related.

One of the main data sources for diagnosing
mental disorders is speech, typically collected dur-
ing a psychiatric interview. Identifying signals
that indicate the presence of thought disorders is
often challenging and subjective, especially in pa-
tients who are not undergoing a psychotic episode
at the time of the interview.

In this work, we focus on schizophrenia. We
investigate a number of semantic characteristics
of transcribed human speech, and propose a way
to use them to measure disorganized speech.
Natural-language processing software is used to
automatically detect those characteristics, and we
suggest a way of aggregating them in a meaning-
ful way. We use transcribed interviews, collected
from Hebrew-speaking schizophrenia inpatients at
a mental health hospital and from a control group.
About two thirds of the patients were identified as
in schizophrenia remission at the time of the inter-
view.

Following a few previous works (Iter et al.,
2018; Bedi et al., 2015), we measure Andreasen’s
derailment by calculating average semantic sim-
ilarity between consecutive chunks of a running
text to track topical mutations, and show the differ-
ence between patients and controls. For incoher-
ence, we look at word modifiers, focusing on ad-
jectives and adverbs, that subjects use to describe
the same objects, and then learn the difference be-
tween the two groups. As a final step, we use those
semantic characteristics in a classification setting
and argue for their usability.

This work makes the following contributions:

• We measure derailment in speech using word
semantics, similar to (Bedi et al., 2015), this
time on Hebrew.

• We explore a novel way of measuring one
aspect of speech incoherence, by measur-
ing how similar modifiers (adjectives and ad-
verbs) are to ones used in a reference text to
describe the same words.

• Using these measures, we build a classifier
for detecting schizophrenia on the basis of

recorded interviews, which achieves 81.5%
accuracy.

We proceed as follows: The next section re-
views some relevant previous work. In Section 3,
we describe how we collected the data. Our main
contributions are described in Section 4, followed
by some conclusions suggested in the final section.

2 Related Work

There is a large body of work that examines
human-generated texts with the aim of learning
about the way people who suffer from various
mental-health disorders use language in different
settings. For example, Al-Mosaiwi and Johnstone
(2018) conducted a study in which they analyzed
63 web forums, some related to mental health dis-
orders and others used as control. They ran their
analysis with the well-known Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2015) tool to
find absolutist words in free text. Overall, they
discovered that anxiety, depression, and suicidal-
ideation forums contained more absolutist words
than control forums.

Recently, social media have become a vital
source for learning about how people who suf-
fer from mental-health disorders use language.
Several studies collect relevant users from Twit-
ter,1 by considering users who intentionally write
about their diagnosed mental-health disorders. For
example, in (De Choudhury et al., 2013; Tsug-
awa et al., 2015), some language characteristics
of Twitter users who claim to suffer from a clin-
ical depression are studied. Similarly, users who
suffer from post traumatic stress disorder are ad-
dressed in (Coppersmith et al., 2014). Mitchell et
al. (2015) analyze tweets posted by schizophren-
ics, and Coppersmith et al. (2016) investigate the
language and emotions that are expressed by users
who have previously attempted to commit suicide.
Coppersmith et al. (2015) work with users who
suffer from a broad range of mental-health con-
ditions and explore language differences between
groups. Most of these works found a significant
difference in the usage of some linguistic charac-
teristics by the experience group when compared
to a control group. Furthermore, different levels of
these linguistic characteristics are used as features
for training a classifier to detect mental-health dis-
orders prior to the report date.

Reddit2 has also been identified as a convenient
source for collecting data for this goal. Losada
and Crestani (2016) outline a methodology for col-
lecting posts and comments of Reddit and Twit-
ter users who suffer from depression. Similarly,
a large dataset of Reddit users with depression,
manually verified (by lay annotators for an explicit
claim of diagnosis), has been released for pub-
lic use (Yates et al., 2017). In that work, the au-
thors employ a deep neural network on the raw text
for detecting clinically depressed people ahead of
time, achieving 65% F1 score on an evaluation set.

A few caveats are in order when using so-
cial media for analyzing mental health conditions.
First, self reporting of a mental health disorder is
not a popular course of action. Clearly, then, the
experimental group is chosen from a subgroup of
the relevant population. Second, the controls, typ-
ically collected randomly “from the wild”, are not
guaranteed to be free of mental-health disorders.
Finally, social media posts are considered to be
a different form of communication than ordinary
speech. For all these reasons, in this work, we
use validated experimental and control groups in
an interview setting.

Measuring various aspects of incoherence in
schizophrenics using computational tools has been
previously addressed in (Elvevåg et al., 2007; Bedi
et al., 2015; Iter et al., 2018). Elvevåg et al. (2007)
analyzed transcribed interviews of inpatients with
schizophrenia to measure tangentiality. Moving
along the patient’s response, they calculated the
semantic similarity between text chunks of dif-
ferent sizes and the question that was asked by
the interviewer. Semantic similarity was cast by
cosine similarity over the latent semantic analy-
sis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) vectors calcu-
lated for each word, and summed across an entire
chunk of words. They fitted a linear-regression
line to represent the trend of the cosine similar-
ity values, as one moves along the text. The slope
of that line was used to measure how quickly the
topic diverges from the original question. Overall,
they were able to show a significant correlation be-
tween those values and a blind human evaluation
of the same responses. Furthermore, as chunk size
grows larger, the distinction between patients and
controls becomes less prominent. One explanation
for that could be the large number of mentions of
functional and filler words, for which we typically

2https://www.reddit.com

do not have a good semantic representation. Iter
et al. (2018) addressed this suggestion by clean-
ing the patients’ responses of all those words and
expressions (e.g. uh, um, you know) prior to cal-
culating the semantic scores. This gave a slight
improvement, although measured over a relatively
small set of participants. Instead of working with
chunks of text, they worked with full sentences,
and replaced LSA with some modern techniques
for sentence embeddings. Likewise, in our work,
we use word embeddings instead of LSA.

Bedi et al. (2015) define coherence as an ag-
gregation of the cosine similarity between pairs
of consecutive sentences, each represented by
the element-wise average vector of the individ-
ual words’ LSA vectors. They worked with a
group of 34 youths at clinical high-risk for psy-
chosis, interviewed them quarterly for 2 1/2 years,
and transcribed their answers. Five out of the 34
transitioned to psychosis. They used coherence
scores, along with part-of-speech information, to
automatically predict transition to psychosis with
100% accuracy.

The goal of all these works, including ours, is
to automatically detect disorganized speech in a
more objective and reliable way. Inspired by the
last three studies described above, we analyzed
transcribed responses to 18 open questions given
by inpatients with schizophrenia and by controls.
Instead of cleaning the text from filler words using
a dictionary – as proposed by (Iter et al., 2018),
we take a deeper look into the syntactic roles the
words play, and calculate semantic similarity over
a filtered version of the text, every time using dif-
ferent sets of part-of-speech categories. We re-
port on the results of two sets of experiments: (1)
We measure derailment by calculating the seman-
tic similarity of adjacent words of various part-of-
speech categories. (2) We measure semantic co-
herence by looking at the choices of modifiers (ad-
jectives, adverbs) used in responses by inpatients
and controls, as compared to those used in ordi-
nary discourse.

Generally speaking, not too much is known
about the role played by adjectives and adverbs
in thought disorders. Modifiers are often not in-
cluded in language tests, as they usually need
to be presented together with the noun or verb
they modify. Some previous works (Obrębska
and Obrębski, 2007) have reported a significantly
smaller number of adjectives used by schizophren-

ics. In the current study, we use computational
tools to investigate the semantic relation between
modifiers and objects, and its attribution to speech
incoherence.

3 Data Collection

We interviewed 51 men, aged 19–63, divided into
control and patient groups, all speaking Hebrew as
their mother tongue. The patient group comprised
24 inpatients at Beer Yaakov Mental Health Cen-
ter in Israel who were officially diagnosed with
schizophrenia. The control group includes 27 peo-
ple, mainly recruited via an advertisement that we
placed on social media. Most of the participants
are single, with average-to-lower monthly income.
Demographics for the two groups are presented in
Table 1.
Ethics statement: The institutional review board of the Col-
lege of Management Academic Studies of Rishon LeZion, as

well as of the Beer Yaakov–Ness Ziona Mental Health Cen-

ter, approved these experiments, and informed consent was

obtained for all subjects.

3.1 Interviews
Overall, the participants were asked 18 questions,
out of which 14 were thematic-apperception-test
(TAT) pictures that participants were requested to
describe, followed by 4 questions that require the
participant to share some personal thoughts and
emotions. Both the control and patient groups
completed a demographic questionnaire. To mon-
itor the mental-health condition of the control
group, they were requested to complete Beck’s
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the State and
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The patient group
also completed BDI-II, as well as a Hebrew trans-
lation (Katz et al., 2012) of the Positive and Neg-

ative Syndrome Scale–6 (PANSS-6, a shorter ver-
sion of PANSS-30) questionnaire, in order to as-
sess symptoms of psychosis (Østergaard et al.,
2016). Scores for the two questionnaires were
found to be highly correlated. Out of the patient
group, 66.7% were assigned a score below 14,
a recommended preliminary threshold indicating
schizophrenia remission.

The interviews were recorded and then man-
ually transcribed by Hebrew-speaking students
from our lab. The TAT pictures presented to par-
ticipants during the interview were: 1, 2, 3BM,
4, 5, 6BM, 7GF, 8BM, 9BM, 12M, 13MF, 13B,
14, 3GF. Table 2 lists the questions that were
presented to the participants during the interview.
All the transcripts are written in Hebrew. Fig-
ure 1 shows average word counts by question, per
group. Clearly, the patients spoke fewer words
than the controls. The difference becomes less sig-
nificant for the open-ended questions.

3.2 Preprocessing

Hebrew being a highly-inflected language, we
preprocessed the texts with the Ben-Gurion
University Morphological Tagger (Adler, 2007),
a context-sensitive morphological analyzer for
Modern Hebrew. Given a running text, the tag-
ger breaks the text into words and provides mor-
phological information for every word, including
the disambiguated part-of-speech tag and lemma.
There were no specific instructions given to the
transcribers for how to punctuate, which led to an
inconsistency in the way punctuation was used in
the transcriptions. We used the tags to clean up all
punctuation marks by removing all tokens tagged
as such.

4 Tools and Method

We report on two sets of experiments. In the first,
we measure derailment by calculating the seman-
tic similarity between adjacent words in running
text. In the second set of experiments, we inves-
tigate the modifiers that the two groups use to de-
scribe specific nouns and verbs. As a final step,
we measure the contribution of the semantic char-
acteristics that we compute in the experiments, for
automatic classification of schizophrenia.

4.1 Experiment 1: Measuring Derailment

We calculate a derailment score for each response
and use it to measure derailment.
Tools: To measure derailment, we calculate the
semantic similarity of adjacent words in the an-
swers provided by the participants during the in-
terview. We use word embeddings to represent
each word by means of a mathematical vector
that captures its meaning. These vectors were
created automatically by characterizing words by
the surrounding contexts in which they are men-
tioned in a large corpus of documents. Specifi-
cally, we used Hebrew pretrained vectors provided
by fastText (Grave et al., 2018), which were cre-
ated from Wikipedia,3 as well as from other con-
tent extracted from the web with Common Crawl.4

Overall, 97% of the words in our corpus exist in
fastText. Hebrew words are inflected for per-
son, number and gender; prefixes and suffixes are
added to indicate definiteness, conjunction, prepo-
sitions, and possessive forms. On the other hand,
fastText was trained for surface forms. There-
fore, we work on the surface-form level. To mea-
sure semantic similarity between two words, we
use the common cosine-similarity function that
calculates the cosine of the angle between the two
corresponding vectors. The score ranges from −1
to +1, with +1 representing maximal similarity.
Method: (1) For each sufficiently long response,

3https://www.wikipedia.org
4http://commoncrawl.org

R, we retrieve the fastText vector vi for every
word Ri, i = 0 . . . n, in the response. (2) For
each word, we calculate the average pairwise co-
sine similarity between this word and the k fol-
lowing words. The integer k is a parameter; we
experimented with different values. (3) We take
the average of all the individual cosine similarity
scores and form a single score for each response.

In this experiment, we consider only responses
that are long enough to allow topic mutation to
develop. Therefore, we use only the four ques-
tions from Table 2 for which the participants pro-
vided a relatively long response. Accordingly, we
drop responses of fewer than 50 words. As men-
tioned above, we consider that the existence of
some word types, like fillers and functional words,
might introduce some noise, which might harm
the calculation process. We would rather focus on
words that convey real content. Therefore, we cal-
culate scores separately using all words and using
only content words, which we take to be nouns,
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. We detected a few
types of text repetitions, which may bias the de-
railment score. One type is when a word is said
twice or more for emphasis; for example, “quickly,
quickly” (xdn xdn) (i.e. very quickly). To mitigate
this bias, we keep only one word out of a pair of
consecutive identical words. Another type is when
a whole phrase is repeated; for example, “She’s
in a big hurry; she’s in a big hurry” (zxdnn `id
ce`n zxdnn `id ,ce`n). Handling this problem is
left for future work.

We calculate derailment scores for the re-
sponses provided by all participants and compare
the means of the two groups.
Results: When using all words, we could not de-
tect a significant difference between patients and
controls. However, when using content words
only, patients scored lower on derailment than the
controls, for all window widths k, suggesting that
focusing only on content words is the more robust
approach for calculating derailment. This finding
is consistent with previous work (Iter et al., 2018).

Overall, coherence decreases as k increases. Ta-
ble 3 summarizes the results. To confirm the sig-
nificance we are seeing in the results, is due to
the diagnosis and not due to other characteristics
of the participants, we aggregated the same scores
for the different age groups and education levels,
regardless of the diagnosis status; all these results
did not appear to be significant. Figure 2 shows
the trend of the average derailment score from Ta-
ble 3, running with different values of k. The left
plot was produced for all word types, and the right
plot using only content words. We clearly observe
a slight increase of the entire control curve and a
slight decrease of the patients curve, when restrict-
ing to content words.

4.2 Experiment 2: Incoherence

In this experiment, we examine the way patients
use adjectives and adverbs (hereafter, modifiers)
to describe specific nouns and verbs, respectively.
Our goal is to measure the difference between
modifiers used by patients and the ones used by
controls, when describing the same nouns and
verbs. We suggest this as a tool for measuring in-
coherence in speech. For example, inspecting the
responses for the first TAT image, we learn that pa-
tients typically use the adjectives “new” (ycg) and
“good” (aeh) to modify the noun “violin” (xepik),
while controls use the adjectives “old” (oyi), “sad”
(aevr), and “significant” (izernyn).
Tools: To detect all noun-adjective and verb-
adverb pairs in the responses, we use a depen-
dency parser, which analyzes the grammatical
structure of a sentence and builds links between
“head” words and their modifiers. Specifically, we
use YAP (More and Tsarfaty, 2016), a dependency
parser for Modern Hebrew, and process each sen-
tence individually. Among other things, YAP pro-
vides a word-dependency list, shaped as a list of
tuples, each includes a head word, a dependent
word, and the kind of dependency. We use the
relevant types (e.g. advmod, amod) for finding all
noun-adjective and verb-adverb pairs. For exam-
ple, Figure 3 shows the dependencies returned by
YAP for the input sentence: “I ate a tasty candy”
(dnirh dixkeq izlk`). From this sentence we ex-
tract the noun “candy” (dixkeq), which is modified
by the adjective “tasty” (dnirh).
Method: To measure the difference between the
modifiers that are used by patients and controls,
we compare them to the modifiers that are com-

monly used to describe the same nouns and verbs.
For example, given an answer with only one noun
“violin” (xepik) that is modified by the adjective
“sad” (aevr), we calculate a score that reflects how
similar the adjective “sad” is to adjectives that are
typically used to describe a violin.

We take the following steps:
(1) We convert each sentence into a list of noun-
adjective and verb-adverb pairs using YAP.
(2) To compare each modifier with the modifiers
that are typically used to describe the same noun
or verb, we use external corpora as reference.
These were taken from various sources reflecting
the health domain we are working in.9 Table 4
lists the sources and the corresponding number of
documents and words that they contain. Each doc-
ument in these sources was processed in exactly
the same way to find all noun-adjective and verb-
adverb pairs.
(3) Given a list of noun-adjective and verb-adverb
pairs of one response, we calculate the similarity
score of every modifier that describes a specific
noun or verb with the set of modifiers describ-
ing exactly the same noun or verb in the refer-
ence corpus. Looking at our example above, we
would want to calculate a similarity score between
the adjective “old” (oyi) and all the adjectives that
are used to describe “violin” (xepik) in the refer-
ence corpus. Searching for instances of the same
Hebrew word is challenging due to Hebrew’s rich
morphology. Hebrew words are inflected for per-
son, number, and gender; prefixes and suffixes are
added to indicate definiteness, conjunction, vari-
ous prepositions, and possessive forms. Therefore,
we work on the lemma (base-form) level. Most
vowels in Hebrew are not indicated in standard
writing; therefore, Hebrew words tend to be am-
biguous, and determining the correct lemma for a
word is nontrivial. We use the lemmas provided
by YAP.

Another challenge is how to compare a sin-
gle modifier with a group of modifiers that were
taken from the reference corpus. We take the
fastText vectors of the modifiers that were ex-
tracted from the reference corpus and aggregate
them into a single vector. Then, we take cosine
similarity between the modifier from the response
and the aggregated vector of the modifiers from
the reference corpus. As an aggregation function,
we use element-wise weighted average of the in-
dividual modifiers’ fastText vectors, and define

average coherence scores across patients and controls
(with standard deviations); ***p < 0.001.

(4) For each response, we calculate two scores, in-
dividually. The adjective-similarity score is the
IDF-weighted average of the individual adjective
scores we calculate in the previous step. Similarly,
the adverb-similarity score is the IDF-weighted
average of the individual adverb scores we calcu-
late in the previous step.
(5) To calculate a score on the participant level, we
average the scores of all the individual responses
provided by the participant.

The output of this process is a pair of scores, one
for adjectives and one for adverbs, calculated for
each participant. The higher a score is, the more
similar the modifiers are to ones that are typically
used to describe the same noun or verb.
Results: Table 5 summarizes the results. Overall,
controls have significantly higher scores for both
modifier types, indicating a higher agreement on
modifiers by the controls and external writers.

There are more nouns and adjectives than verbs
and adverbs, as summarized in Table 6. On av-
erage, participants use more adjectives to describe
nouns than adverbs to describe verbs. Controls use
about 0.61 adjectives per noun, while patients use
0.84 adjectives on average. Similarly, patients use
more adverbs to describe a verb on average than

differences are not significant.

4.3 Classification

As a final step, we train several classifiers to distin-
guish between controls and patients. We represent
participants with the characteristics we compute in
the two experiments. Specifically, each subject is
represented by the following: (1) noun and verb
derailment scores; (2) coherence scores for 5 win-
dows, using all words; and (3) coherence scores
for 5 windows, using only content words. In total,
we use 12 scores per subject. Each classifier was
trained using a 10-fold cross-validation evaluation
of prediction quality over the 51 participants. For
each classifier, we report on the overall prediction
accuracy, as well as precision and recall for the
prediction of the patients group. The classification
algorithms we tried are Random Forest (Breiman,
2001) and XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016),
both based on decision trees, and, in addition, lin-
ear support vector machines (SVM) (Cortes and
Vapnik, 1995). Table 7 summarizes the results per
classifier with respect to the different metrics.

We used the decision-tree based classifiers to
calculate the most important features, that is, the
ones that have the greatest impact on predic-
tion decisions. The most important features were
found to be the two derailment scores, as expected.

5 Conclusions

With the aim of detecting speech disturbances, we
have analyzed transcribed Hebrew speech, pro-
duced by schizophrenia inpatients and compared
it with those of controls. We believe that speech
produced during a psychiatric interview is a more
reliable data source for detecting disturbances than
are social media posts.

Generally speaking, we find that patients talk
significantly less in interviews than controls do.

In one experiment, we use word embeddings to
detect derailment, that is, when a speaker shifts
to a topic that is not strongly related to pre-
viously discussed ones. The results show that
controls have higher scores, indicating that they
keep the topic more cohesive than patients do.
These results are in line with previous studies on
English (Bedi et al., 2015), which showed that
schizophrenics have a lower score, calculated by
a similar mathematical procedure.

In a second experiment, we examine the differ-
ence in how patients and controls use adjectives
and adverbs to describe nouns and verbs, respec-
tively. Our results show that the adjectives and ad-
verbs that are used by the controls are more similar
to the typical ones used to describe the same nouns
and verbs. For now, we consider this difference as
related to speech incoherence; however, we plan
to continue investigating this direction in the near
future, when more data become available.

Analyzing Hebrew is more challenging than an-
alyzing English due to Hebrew’s rich morphology,
as well as the absence of written vowels. In the
first experiment, we work with fastText, which
provides word embeddings on the surface-form
level. In the second, we used lemmata rather than
the word surface forms, so we can find multiple
instances of the same lexeme.

As we did not measure the IQ of participants,
some of the results might, to a certain extent, be
attributable to differences in intellect. Moreover,
as can be seen in Table 1, about 20% of the control
participants have some sort of post high-school ed-
ucation, while most of the inpatients did not con-
tinue beyond high-school. We plan to address
these questions in followup work. Another limi-
tation that we are aware of is related to the classi-
fication results, as the number of participants we
use for training the classifiers might be considered
relatively small.

Overall, we found the semantic characteristics

that we compute in this study to be beneficial for
the task of detecting thought disorders in Hebrew
speech. We plan to collect speech samples from
more subjects, and to continue to explore addi-
tional semantic – as well as grammatical – textual
characteristics to support the automatic detection
of various mental disorders.
