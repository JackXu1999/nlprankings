The recent rise of social media has greatly democ-
ratized content creation. Facebook, Twitter, Skype,
Whatsapp and LiveJournal are now commonly used
to share thoughts and opinions about anything in the
surrounding world. This proliferation of social me-
dia content has created new opportunities to study
public opinion, with Twitter being especially popu-
lar for research due to its scale, representativeness,
variety of topics discussed, as well as ease of public
access to its messages.

Unfortunately, research in that direction was hin-
dered by the unavailability of suitable datasets and
lexicons for system training, development and test-
ing. While some Twitter-specific resources were de-
veloped, initially they were either small and pro-
prietary, such as the i-sieve corpus (Kouloumpis et
al., 2011), were created only for Spanish like the
TASS corpus (Villena-Román et al., 2013), or relied
on noisy labels obtained automatically (Mohammad,
2012; Pang et al., 2002).

This situation changed with the shared task on
Sentiment Analysis on Twitter, which was organized
at SemEval, the International Workshop on Seman-
tic Evaluation, a semantic evaluation forum previ-
ously known as SensEval. The task ran in 2013,
2014, 2015 and 2016, attracting over 40+ of partic-
ipating teams in all four editions. While the focus
was on general tweets, the task also featured out-of-
domain testing on SMS messages, LiveJournal mes-
sages, as well as on sarcastic tweets.

SemEval-2013 task 2 (Nakov et al., 2013) and
SemEval-2014 Task 9 (Rosenthal et al., 2014) had
an expression-level and a message-level polarity
subtasks.

SemEval-2015 Task 10 (Rosenthal et al., 2015;
Nakov et al., 2016b) further added subtasks on topic-
based message polarity classification, on detecting
trends towards a topic, and on determining the out-
of-context (a priori) strength of association of Twit-
ter terms with positive sentiment.

SemEval-2016 Task 4 (Nakov et al., 2016a)
dropped the phrase-level subtask, and focused on
sentiment with respect to a topic. It further intro-
duced a 5-point scale, which is used for human re-
view ratings on popular websites such as Amazon,
TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.; from a research perspective,
this meant moving from classification to ordinal re-
gression. Moreover, it focused on quantification,
i.e., determining what proportion of a set of tweets
on a given topic are positive/negative about it. It also
featured a 5-point scale ordinal quantification sub-
task (Gao and Sebastiani, 2015).

Other related (mostly non-Twitter) tasks have ex-
plored aspect-based sentiment analysis (Pontiki et
al., 2014; Pontiki et al., 2015; Pontiki et al., 2016),
sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twitter
(Ghosh et al., 2015), implicit event polarity (Russo
et al., 2015), stance in tweets (Mohammad et al.,
2016), out-of-context sentiment intensity of phrases
(Kiritchenko et al., 2016), and emotion detection
(Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007). Some of these
tasks featured languages other than English.

We expect the quest for more interesting formula-
tions of the general sentiment analysis task to con-
tinue. We see SemEval as the engine of this in-
novation, as it not only does head-to-head compar-
isons, but also creates databases and tools that en-
able follow-up research for many years afterwards.
