Abstract

We present a system called ACE for Automatic Colloquialism and Errors detection for
written Chinese. ACE is based on the combination of N-gram model and rule-base model.
Although it focuses on detecting colloquial Cantonese (a dialect of Chinese) at the current
stage, it can be extended to detect other dialects. We chose Cantonese becauase it has
many interesting properties, such as unique grammar system and huge colloquial terms,
that turn the detection task extremely challenging. We conducted experiments using real
data and synthetic data. The results indicated that ACE is highly reliable and effective.

1 Introduction
In general, there are two kinds of writing errors, typographical error (a.k.a. spelling errors)

and orthographic error (a.k.a. cognitive error) (Damerau, 1964; Min et al., 2000). Typographical
error means incorrectly substituting a right character with a wrong one, whereas orthographic
error happens during the process of cognition. For colloquialism, there are two kinds as well:
colloquial word and colloquial usage. For example, the word “返⼯” (means “back to work”)
is a colloquial Cantonese word. Its formal counterpart is “上班” (note: the characters of both
words are completely different). On the other hand, the phrase “吃飯先” (go to dinner first),
is a colloquial Cantonese usage and its formal counterpart is “先吃飯” (note: all characters in
both words are the same but the position of the character “先” is different).

In this paper, we proposed a system called ACE (Automatic Colloquialism and Spelling Error
Detector) to deal with all the errors stated previously. In ACE, there are three functions: (1)
Identify the colloquial Cantonese words and usage; (2) Identify the potential spelling errors; (3)
Provide correction suggestions.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no work related to automatically identify colloquial
Cantonese. We do not aware any work on colloquialism in other language as well. For the work
related to Chinese spelling error, (Lee et al., 2014) applied N-gram model and rule-based system
to judge a sentence based on large number of data and experts knowledge. (Xie et al., 2015)
builds a system using both N-gram model and Language model, and implements a dynamic
programming to increase the efficiency. (Chang et al., 2015) implements a rule-base model and
a linear regression model to tackle the task with the help of Chinese Orthographic Database.
We observed that large training corpus is one of the key element for a reliable model (Tseng et
al., 2015). Unfortunately, such setup is difficult to apply in our scenario because of the lack of
Cantonese corpus.

2 System Description
ACE has two main modules: Cantonese detector and spelling error detector. Here is an

outline of ACE: (Step 1) Identify over-segment parts in a sentence; (Step 2) Apply the Cantonese
detector to check if there is any colloquial Cantonese (both usages and words); (Step 3) Apply the

spelling error detector to check if there is any spelling error; (Step 4) Give correction suggestions
for the errors detected in Step 2 and Step 3. In the followings we briefly describe the major
elements within ACE.

2.1 Over-segment Parts
It is well proven that after sentence segmentation, the over-segment parts is an effective

indicator to indicate potential spelling errors (Wu et al., 2010). Consider: “現在簡介有關⾹港
電台數碼地⾯電視廣播法展概況”, and its segmentation result: “現在/簡介/有關/⾹港電台 /數
碼/地⾯/電視廣播/法/展/概況”. The spelling error is “法” (the 4th last character). The correct
character is“發”. Note that the last four characters are segmented into three parts: “法/展/概
況”. If this sentence is written correctly as “... 發展概況”, then the segmentation result will
become “.../發展/概況”. Hence two parts are resulted. By identifying the over-segment parts,
we may have some cues if there is any potential spelling error. There are many different kinds of
segmentation algorithms, such as HMM and Maximum Probability. In ACE, we use Maximum
Probability as it performs that best empirically. Note that not all single-character word are
regarded as over-segment part. Details will be discussed in Section 2.3.

2.2 Cantonese Detector
The Cantonese detector has two elements: (1) Build a large dictionary, and (2) Build a

rule-base system. To build the large dictionary, apart from collecting the official Cantonese
characters from the Hong Kong Information Office(http://www.gov.hk/tc/about/helpdesk)
public education resources – “Hong Kong Extra Adding font collection”, we further
collect some “hot” and “trendy” Cantonese characters from online, such as Open-
Rice(http://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong). There are totally more than 11000 words in
our Cantonese dictionary. To build the rule-base system, we apply some Cantonese linguistic
rules and use pos-tagging to describe these rules. Accordingly, we build eight rules as a start
for eight basic Cantonese sentence structure. A rule usually has two parts: a flag word and a
part-of-speech-tagging pattern. For example: the phrase “吃飯先” has no Cantonese characters,
and it can be tagged as “吃飯/v先/d”(ACE follows the ICTCLAS(http://ictclas.nlpir.org) part-
of-speech-tagging standards). The rule can be organized as “1-先 v/d”, the “1” indicates the
position of the flag character, in this case “先”, and “v/d” is the part-of-speech-tagging pattern
of a certain phrase.

2.3 Spelling Error Detector
To detect the spelling errors in a sentence and offer replacement suggestions, a typical way

is to employ an recursion algorithm as follows: (1) Check if there is any single-character word.
A single-character word will be regarded as an over-segment part; (2) Replace the characters
in the over-segmented parts by their corresponding confusion sets one by one. The confusion
set of a character is the set of characters that are similar to the character typographically
or orthographically; (3) Reassemble a new sentence and justify if the character replacement
is appropriate. Unfortunately, we encountered several problems with such approach. First,
there are many single correct characters in a Chinese sentence. For example, “是” (mean“is”),
“地” (similar to append “ ing” in a word, mean something is continuing) and “的” (similar to
append “’s” in a noun) are all single-character word and usually appear in a sentence. They will
always be segmented as a single-character word. If we perform the recursion algorithm as stated
above, the whole system will be slow down dramatically and become useless in practice because
many correct single-character words are regarded as over-segment parts. Second, unnecessary
replacements may happen, because some single-character words have high-frequent replacement
candidates according to the training data. For example, word “⽩” has a replace candidate “的”
from the confusion set, but “的” has much higher frequency comparing with “⽩” in the training
data, then an unnecessary replacement from “⽩” to “的” may happen despite of the context.

Precision Recall F1
High 0.4843 0.7764 0.5839

Medium 0.4239 0.7872 0.5368
Low 0.2647 0.7505 0.3770

Table 1: The performance for large corps

To deal with these problems, we assign a score to every sentence based on its segmented
words after the sentence segmentation. The score is computed based on a language model: the
more frequent a word appears in the training data (e.g., the word “是”), the higher score it is
and the higher co-occurrence of words combinations get higher score. Setting thresholds has
been proven a useful method (Ferraro et al., 2011). We regard a single-character word as an
over-segment part if and only if its score is higher than a predefined threshold. The threshold is
computed based on the minmax principle: the smallest score of the most frequent word in the
training data. In addition, we set bias on the sentence scores, if the length of words list becomes
shorter, which means the number of over-segmented parts in a sentence decrease, ACE will add
a positive bias on the score to make it higher. In contrast, the score of the sentence will become
lower with adding a negative bias if the list of words of the sentence become longer.

In addition, in ACE, unlike the existing approaches which usually try to do the character
replacement immediately once they identified a potential spelling error, we regard the consecutive
over-segment parts as one candidate set and perform the replacement for all characters within
such set. This can effectively help us to identify some spelling errors where two characters in
a word are both spelling wrong. For example, if “政策” is incorrectly written as “正朿” (both
characters are written incorrectly), then ACE is possible to detect the error, whereas the existing
approaches may not necessary able to do so.

To justify whether a replacement is appropriate, we follow the existing approaches by: (1)
Reassemble the sentence after character replacement, (2) Score the sentence, and (3) If the new
score is higher than the previous score, we say that the replacement is justifiable.

3 Experiments

We conducted experiments on synthetic data and real data. For synthetic data, we collected
500 error-free compositions from school students. For each composition, we randomly pick N
Chinese terms from a predefined dictionary and replace them with the corresponding colloquial
Cantonese. Next, we randomly pick M characters from the composition and replace them with
one of the characters from their corresponding confusion sets. We vary M and N to test the
sensitiveness of ACE. We set M +N equals to 4, 8, 10 to denote low, medium and high level of
errors. For real error data, we collect 411 sentences from Hong Kong school students. Each of
them may have more than one spelling errors or colloquial Cantonese usage.

3.1 Evaluation Results
We compute precision, recall and F-1 using true positive (the no. of spelling errors that are

correctly detected), false positive (the no. of non-existent errors are identified) and false negative
(the no. of spelling errors cannot be detected) . Table 1 shows the results using synthetic data.
The result is satisfactory and comparable to the latest existing works.

Table 2 shows some sample results using the real data. For the sentence “從令天開始，我
就成為⼀名⼩學⽣啦！”, “今天” is written as “令天”. The sentence “快到聖誕節了，我和媽媽
⼀同去構買聖誕禮物。” shares similar error. The sentence “表姐專⾨來送結婚請貼給爸爸媽
媽。”, “請帖” is written as “請貼”, the wrong character is not the first character of the word.
This indicate the ACE could be able to select the best candidate using its recursion replacement
algorithm. There are some sentences have colloquial Cantonese usages and spelling errors in the
same sentence. For example, “今天返⼯，突然下起的⼤⾬淋得他混⾝都濕透了。” , “返⼯” is a

Table 2: Result Examples

colloquial word and “混⾝” is an error. ACE detects both errors successfully. ACE also detect
the colloquial Cantonese usage (not Cantonese word). For example, “我最愛吃媽媽包的交⼦啦！
讓我吃飯先”, “交⼦” should be written as“餃⼦” and a colloquial usage “吃飯先”. Finally, for a
complex context such as “常年累⽉的⾟勞，使外公的腰越來越彎了。”, ACE could also detect
the errors.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced ACE (Automatic Colloquialism, Typographical and Ortho-

graphic Error Detection) to detect the spelling errors and colloquial Cantonese from written
Chinese, and to provide correction suggestions. The results indicated that ACE is effective and
efficient.
