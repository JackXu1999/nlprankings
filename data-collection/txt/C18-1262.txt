Abstract

In this paper, we describe an attempt towards the development of parallel corpora for En-
glish and Ethiopian Languages, such as Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and
Ge’ez. The corpora are used for conducting a bi-directional statistical machine transla-
tion experiments. The BLEU scores of the bi-directional Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) systems show a promising result. The morphological richness of the Ethiopian
languages has a great impact on the performance of SMT specially when the targets
are Ethiopian languages. Now we are working towards an optimal alignment for a bi-
directional English-Ethiopian languages SMT.

1 Introduction

The advancement of technology and the rise of the internet as a means of communication led to an
ever increasing demand for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. NLP applications
are useful in facilitating human-machine and human-human communications. One of the NLP
applications which facilitates human-human communication is Machine Translation (MT). MT
refers to a process by which computer software is used to translate a text or speech from one
language to another (Koehn, 2009). In the presence of high volume digital text, the ideal aim
of machine translation systems is to produce the best possible translation with minimal human
intervention (Hutchins, 2005).

The translation of natural language by machine becomes a reality, for technologically favored
languages, in the late 20th century although it is dreamt in seventieth century (Hutchins, 1995).
Various approaches to MT have been and are being used in the research community, that
can broadly classified as rule-based and corpus based (Koehn, 2009). The rule based machine
translation demands various kinds of linguistic resources such as morphological analyzer and
synthesizer, syntactic parsers, semantic analyzers and so on. On the other hand, corpus based
approaches (as the name implies) require parallel and monolingual corpora. Since corpus based
approaches do not require deep linguistic analysis of the source and target languages, it is the
preferred approach for under-resourced languages of the world, including Ethiopian languages.

1.1 Machine Translation For Ethiopian Languages
Research in the development of MT has been conducted for technologically favored and econom-
ically as well as politically important languages of the world since the 17th century. As a result,
notable progress towards the development and use of MT systems has been made for these lan-
guages. However, research in the area of MT for Ethiopian languages, which are under-resourced
as well as economically and technologically disadvantaged, has started very recently. Most of the

researches on MT for Ethiopian languages are conducted by graduate students (Tariku, 2004;
Sisay, 2009; Eleni, 2013; Jabesa, 2013; Akubazgi, 2017), including two PhD works: one that
tried to integrate Amharic into a unification based machine translation system (Sisay, 2004)
and the other that investigated English-Amharic Statistical Machine Translation (Mulu, 2017).
Beside these, Michael and Million (2017) attempted a bi-directional Amharic-Tigrigna SMT
experiement using word and morpheme as translation units.

Due to unavailability of linguistic resources and since the most widely used MT approach is
statistical, most of these researches have been conducted using SMT, which requires large bilin-
gual and monolingual corpora. However, as there were no such corpora for SMT experiments,
the researchers had to prepare small size corpora. This in turn, affects the results that they
obtain.

In addition, since there is no standard corpora for conducting replicable and consistent ex-
periment for performance evaluation, it is difficult to know the progress made in the area for
local languages. Moreover, since the researchers spend their time on corpora preparation, they
usually have limited time for experimentation, exploration and development of MT systems.

1.2 Motivation of this paper
African languages, which contribute around 30% (2139) of the world languages, highly suffer
from lack of sufficient language resources (Simons and Fennig, 2017). This is true for Ethiopian
languages as well. On the other hand, Ethiopia being multilingual and multiethnic country,
its constitution decrees that each citizen has the right to speak, write and develop in his/her
own language. However, a lot of written documents, brochures, text books, magazines, adver-
tisements and other information in the web are being produced in technological favored and
economically important languages such as English.

In order to enable Ethiopians to use the documents and information produced in techno-
logically favored languages, the documents need to be translated. Since manual translation
is expensive, a promising alternative is the use of machine translation, particularly SMT as
Ethiopian languages suffer from lack of basic linguistic resources such as morphological ana-
lyzer, syntactic analyzer, morphological synthesizer, etc. The major and basic resource required
for SMT is parallel corpora, which are not available for Ethiopian languages. The collection and
preparation of parallel corpora for Ethiopian languages is, therefore, an important endeavor to
facilitate future MT research and development. Corpus acquisition for SMT is actually one of
the recommendations of Saba and Sisay (2006).

We have, therefore, collected and prepared parallel corpora for English and Ethiopian Lan-
guages that fall under the Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic language families. We have considered
Amharic, Tigrigna and Ge’ez from the Semitic, Afan-Oromo from the Cushitic and Wolaytta
from Omotic language families. This paper, therefore, describes an attempt that we have made
to collect and prepare English-Ethiopian languages parallel corpora and the SMT experiments
conducted using the corpora.

2 Nature of the language pairs

The language pairs in the corpora belong to Semitic (Ge’ez, Amharic and Tigrigna), Cushitic
(Afan-Oromo) and Omotic (Wolaytta) language families. Except Ge’ez, these languages have
native speakers. Presently, Ge’ez does not have native speakers. Ge’ez functions as a liturgical
language of Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It is thought as a second language in traditional schools
of churches and given as a course in different Universities. There is a rich body of literature in
Ge’ez. It is not only literature but also philosophical, medical and astrological documents were
written in Ge’ez. Because of this, there is a big initiative in translating those documents written
in Ge’ez. On the other hand, Amharic is spoken by more than 27 million people which makes it
the second most spoken Semitic language. Tigrigna is spoken by 9 million people. Afan-Oromo
and Wolaytta are spoken by more than 34 million and 2 million speakers, respectively (Simons



3104

and Fennig, 2017).
The writing systems of these language pairs are Ge’ez or Ethiopic script and Latin alphabet.

Ge’ez, Amharic and Tigrigna are written in Ge’ez script whereas both Afan-Oromo and Wolaytta
are written in Latin alphabet. It is believed that the earliest known writing in the Ge’ez script
dated back to the 5th century BC. The writing system is syllabry where each character represents
a consonant and vowel. The basic features of the writing system is that each character gets its
basic shape from the consonant of the syllable, and the vowel is represented through a systematic
modifications of these basic shapes. The script is used to write other languages like Amharic,
Tigrigna, Argoba, etc.

The Ethiopian languages considered in the project have got different functions in the coun-
try. Amharic for instance is the working language of the Federal Government of Ethiopia.
It also serves as regional working language of some other regional states. It facilitates inter-
regional communication as well. Tigrigna and Afan-Oromo are working language in Tigray and
Oromiya regional administrations, respectively. Some of the governmental websites are available
in Amharic, Tigrigna and Afan-Oromo. Apart from this, they serve as medium of instructions
in primary and secondary schools. These languages are available in electronic media like news,
blogs and social media except Ge’ez. Currently, Google offers a searching capability using
Amharic, Tigrigna and Afan-Oromo. Further, Google also included Amharic in its translation
service recently.

2.1 Morphological features
As in other Semitic language morphology, Ge’ez (Dillman, 1907), Amharic (Leslau, 2000; Teferra
and Hudson, 2007) and Tigrigna (Mason, 1996; Yohannes, 2002), make use of the root and
pattern system. In these languages, a root (which is called a radical) is set of consonants which
bears the basic meaning of the lexical item whereas a pattern is composed of a set of vowels
inserted between the consonants of the root. These vowel patters together with affixes results in
derived words. Such derivational process makes these language to be morphologically complex
languages.

In addition to the morphological information, some syntactic information are also expressed
at word level. Furthermore, an orthographic word may attach some syntactic words like prepo-
sitions, conjunctions, negation, etc. which make word forms to be very varied (Gasser, 2010;
Gasser, 2011). In these languages, nominals are inflected for number, gender, definiteness and
case whereas verbs are inflected for person, number, gender, tense, aspect, and mood.

As we may observe in the Semitic languages, nominals are inflected for number, gender, case
and definiteness and verbs are inflected for person, number, gender, tense, aspect and mood
(Griefenow-Mewis, 1995). Essentially, unlike the Semitic languages which allow prefixing, Afan-
Oromo allows suffixing. Most functional words like pospositions are also suffixed. However,
there are some prepositions written as a separate word.

Wolaytta like Afan-Oromo is a suffixing language in which words can be generated from root
words recursively by adding suffixes only. Wolaytta nouns are inflected for number, gender and
case whereas verbs are inflected for person, number, gender, aspect and mood (Wakasa, 2008).

2.2 Syntactic Features
Ethiopian languages that are under our consideration follow Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word-
order except Ge’ez which allows the verb to come first. In Ge’ez, the basic word-order is
Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). On the contrary, English language uses Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
word-order.

3 Challenges of SMT
Statistical machine translation is greatly affected by the linguistic features of the target lan-
guages. The challenges ranges from the writing system to that of word ordering and morpho-
logical complexity.



3105

3.1 Writing System
Semitic language writing system are represented by a consonant vowel (CV) sequence and the ba-
sic shape of each character is determined by the consonant, which is modified for the vowel. These
language script has inherited its writing system from Ge’ez (ግእዝ) /gə’əzə/ using a grapheme
based writing system called fidel /fidälə/ which is written and read from left to right being the
classical and ecclesiastical language of Ethiopia. Unlike the Semitic languages, The Cushitic
(Afan-Oromo) and Omotic (Wolaytta) languages use a latin based writing system.

3.2 Word Ordering
Semitic languages like Amharic, Tigrigna and Ge’ez are morphologically rich where words are
required to be further segmented or a single word from these languages would be aligned with
as big as handful of words in languages like English. The languages under consideration have
different word order. With this respect, Amharic, Afan-Oromo, Tigrigna and Wolaytta have
SOV, Ge’ez has VSO and English has SVO topology. The different word orders used in these
languages is major challenge for Multilingual machine translation system.

Another challenge is the existence of flexibility in word order. For instance, even though
Afan-Oromo follows SOV word order format, nouns can be changed based on their role in a
sentence which makes the word order to be flexible. Although the major word order of Ge’ez is
VSO, it also follows free word order. Such flexibilities will pose another challenge for translation
from source to Afan-Oromo and Ge’ez languages.

3.3 Morphological Complexity
While word alignment could be done automatically or with supervision, morphological agreement
between words in the source and target are crucial. For instance, Amharic and Ge’ez have subject
agreement, object agreement and genitive (possessive) agreement. Each of which are expressed
as bound morphemes which should be aligned or translated as independent words in English. In
Amharic, for the word ገደልክ /you killed/ the English subject “you” is represented by the suffix
“+ክ” while the same subject is represented as “+ከ” in the Ge’ez (ቀተልከ /you killed/). Likewise,
the definite marker for Amharic and English are quite different in their representation. While
it is a bound morpheme in Amharic, it is a word (free morpheme) in English. Most of the local
languages under consideration falls into this group.

4 Parallel Corpus preparation
The development of machine translation more often uses statistical approach because it requires
very limited computational linguistic resources compared to the rule-based approach. Neverthe-
less, the statistical approach relies to a great extent on parallel corpora of the source and target
languages.

The research team has applied different techniques to collect parallel corpora for the selected
Ethiopian languages paired with English. The collected data fall under the religious, historical
and legal domains.

The religious domain include Holy Bible and different documents written in spiritual theme
and collected from Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW1), Ethiopicbible2, Ebible3 and Ge’ez experience4
which are freely available websites.

The historical domain is from one source which is the handbook of Africa (”African Almanac”).
The source is griped from admase ethiopia github5.

The legal domain includes documents collected from Ethiopian constitution, Proclamation and
Regulation documents which are available for different period of time and languages (Amharic,

Tigrigna and Afan-Oromo aligned with English). The documents are taken from Ethiopian legal
brief website.

Legal and historical domain data collected from sources specified above are available in text
and pdf format. For the sources in pdf, a pdf miner tool is used for extracting texts.The contents
in the pdf files are stored in multiple columns with a language per column. By using a Unicode
range of characters, the contents in each column were extracted without distorting the sentence
sequence. For the corpus in the religious domain, a simple web crawler was used to extract
parallel text from targeted websites.

Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup were used to analyze the structure of
the website, extract texts and combine to a single text file. To collect the bible data, we have
generated the structure of the URL so that it shows the book names, chapters and verse numbers
of Bible in each language.

For the daily text which is published at Jehovah Witnesses (JW), we tried to use the date
information to generate URL for each language. The page was requested to extract the data
we are interested in. Finally, we organized and merged the data to a single UTF-8 text files for
each language.

We could have all these domains only for a language pair Amharic-English. The Tigrigna-
English and Afan Oromo-English corpora are in legal and religious (both bible and other religious
collections) domains. The Wolaytta-English and Ge’ez-English language pairs are from the
religious domain only. However, the Ge’ez-English corpius is only from Bible while the Wolaytta-
English consists of Bible and other religious collections.

4.1 Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an important and basic step in preparing bilingual and multilingual parallel
corpora. Since the collected parallel data have different formats and characteristics, it is very
difficult and time-consuming to prepare manually. To produce parallel corpus there is a need to
analyze the structure of collected raw data by applying different techniques.

During preprocessing the following tasks have been performed: character normalization, sen-
tence tokenization and alignment.

4.1.1 Character Normalization

There are characters in Amharic that have similar roles and are redundant. Characters ሀ, ሐ and
ኀ; ሠ and ሰ; አ and ዐ as well as ጸ and ፀ are variants along with their orders. These characters
are used interchangeably. To avoid words with the same meaning from being taken as distinct
words due to these character variants, we have replaced a set of characters with similar function
into a single most frequently used character.

As a result of normalizing character variants in Amharic text , reduction in the number of word
types (vocabulary) has been obtained. Table 1 presents the vocabulary reduction of training,
development and testing dataset. As can be seen from the table, the vocabulary size reduced
by 15.78 % for training, 10.53% for development and 11.95% for testing from a total of 40,726
sentence (132,723 Token of 628,474 type).

Testing 24,142 21,258 11.95%

Table 1: Amharic text corpus before and after character normalization.



3107

4.1.2 Sentence Tokenization and Alignment

Lines that contain multiple sentences in both source and target languages are tokenized. The
team have set two criteria to check whether the aligned sentences are correct or not. The first
criterion is counting and matching the number of sentences in the source and target languages.
The second criterion is mapping the sentence end marker in source and destination languages.
For example, after sentence tokenization is applied the number of new sentences and sentence
end marker of the source is compared with that of the target. If both criteria are fulfilled, the
new sentence list is used as a parallel corpus.

For the English–Ge’ez6 parallel corpus, the source language contain multiple verses in a single
line while on the target side, each line contains a single verse. To align the two corresponding
language pairs, we tried to merge verses to produce the desired parallel verse. In addition,
removing unnecessary links, numbers, symbols and foreign texts in each language has been
done.

4.2 Corpus Size and Distribution of tokens and vocabulary

The corpus has been analyzed to see the relationship between English and each one of the
considered Ethiopian languages. As it can be seen from Table 1 to Table 5 and the corresponding
Figures (Figure 1 to 5), there is a significant difference between the morphology of English and
the Ethiopian languages. Due to this difference, the same number of sentences in these language
pairs is tokenized into significantly different number of tokens and vocabularies in all the available
domains.

The Figures clearly show that English vocabulary is much lower than vocabulary of all the
considered Ethiopian languages. On the contrary, the English token is significantly higher
than tokens of the Ethiopian languages. It is clear, therefore, that such differences between
the languages in a language pair makes SMT difficult because it aggravates data scarcity and
results into a weakly trained translation model. The morphological complexity of the Ethiopian
languages also challenges the SMT towards them because it results into a poorly trained language
model.

5 SMT Experiments and results

In this study, bi-directional SMT systems are developed to check the validity of the collected
parallel corpora for English and the four Ethiopian languages.

5.1 Experimental setups

In the experimental setup, Moses is used along with GIZA++ alignment tool (Och and Ney,
2003) for aligning words and phrases. SRILM toolkit was used to develop language models using
semi-automatically prepared corpora from the training and tuning corpora of target languages.

Table 7 shows the sentence length, the number of words, the total number of tokens and the
average sentence length found in the corpora for the four Ethiopian languages with respect to
English.

To carry out the experiments, each parallel corpus is divided into three partitions; 80% as a
training set where a large subset of the whole corpus is used to train the language and translation
models, 10% for tuning (useful to adjust the weights of the model combination) and 10% as a tes
tset for evaluating the final bi-direction statistical machine translation system of each language
pair.

Automatic metrics and subjective evaluation are the two most widely used techniques or
methods for MT system evaluation. In this research, BiLingual Evaluation Under Study (BLEU)

Table 8: Experimental results of bi-directional English-Ethiopian languages SMT

As shown in Table 8, the English-Amharic translation shows a BLEU score of 13.31 while the
Amharic-English has a 22.68. Similarly, the English-Tigrigna and Tigrigna-English have BLEU
scores of 17.89 and 27.53, respectively. Likewise, English-Afaan Oromo has a 14.68 BLEU and
Afan Oromo-English has 18.88 BLEU score. In a similar way, the English-Wolaytta translation
has BLEU of 10.49 while Wolaytta-English has 17.39. Finally, The English-Ge’ez and Ge’ez-
English translation has BLEU score of 6.67 and 18.01, respectively.

Figure 6 presents summary of BLEU score registered for bi-directional English-Ethiopian
languages using statistical approach.

Figure 6: Comparison of Bi-directional English to Ethiopian language translation results



3110

The BLEU score of Amharic-English translation system is lower than the Tigrigna-English
translation system although the size of the Amharic-English parallel corpus is bigger than the
Tigrigna-English one. This might be due to the number of domains considered in the corpora.
The Amharic-English corpus covers all the three domains whereas the Tigrigna-English corpus
is from only two domains.

Despite the size of the data, the English-Ethiopian languages SMT systems have less BLEU
scores than that of Ethiopian languages-English ones. This is because of the fact that when
the Ethiopian languages are used as a target language, the translation from English as a source
language is challenged by many-to-one alignment. On the other hand, better performance is
registered when the target language is English since the alignment is one-to-many taking each
Ethiopian language as a source. In addition to this, the language model data favours the English
language than that of Ethiopian languages due to the complexity of the morphology of these
languages.

6 Conclusion and future work

This paper presents the attempt made in preparing standard parallel corpora for English and
Ethiopian languages. The text data have been collected from the web in history, legal and
religious domains. Then, the data are further pre-processed and normalized in preparing a
bilingual parallel corpora for SMT task. Using the corpora, bi-directional statistical machine
translation experiments have been conducted. The experimental results show that a translation
from Ethiopian languages to English resulted in better BLEU score than that of the English to
Ethiopian languages. The morphological richness of the Ethiopian languages greatly affect the
performance of SMT specially when they are target languages.

To further see the impact, there is a need to conduct additional experiments with the objective
of identifying an optimal one-to-many and many-to-one alignment when either of them used as
a target language. Moreover, further research is needed to identify the exact reason behind the
low performance of English to Ethiopian languages translation systems. Investigating the effect
of domains on SMT performance is one of the future work we will work on.
