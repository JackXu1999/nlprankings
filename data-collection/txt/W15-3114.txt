Abstract 

The BI ( 比 )-structure, which highlights a 
contrasting characteristic between two items, is the 
key comparative sentence structure in Chinese. In 
this paper, we explore the methods of extracting 
the 6 constituents of the BI-structure. Previous 
studies are often restricted to probabilistic 
classification methods, where the feature used 
hardly embodies linguistic knowledge, therefore 
unintuitive. As an alternative, we propose the use 
of two linguistic knowledge-driven approaches, 
namely the POS chunking-based and TBL-based 
methods. The first model effectively captures 
grammatical restrictions over POS sequential 
patterns. The second model set up on new and 
lesser templates performs better than Brill’s (1995). 
Experimental results show that the proposed 
models are simple and effective methods for 
Chinese comparative element extraction task. 

1 Introduction 
Comparison is the most representative figure of 
evaluation. Much of evaluative information is 
now available in the web, and comparative sen-
tences prevail in Chinese web texts in increasing 
numbers. A significant amount of research has 
been conducted on automatic identification of 
Chinese comparative sentence and its semantic 
elements. However, the techniques proposed in 
earlier works are mostly based on statistical clas-
sification method. Due to the opaque nature of 
stochastic features, it is often difficult to com-
prehend what linguistic aspects are applied to the 
model.  

In this paper, we present a detailed analysis 
on linguistic behavior of the BI (比)-structure, 
which is the key comparative structure in Chi-
nese. The application of the two rule-based ap-
proaches suggested in this paper are different 
from previous models in that they fully use syn-

tactic and lexical features which are intrinsic to 
the structure.  

This paper first presents a brief literature 
review on the subject. The target of extraction 
task, i.e. Comparative Elements (CE) is then de-
fined before demonstration of the two proposed 
approaches, i.e. POS chunking-based and TBL-
based extraction models. Finally, we discuss the 
experiment’s results and present our conclusion. 

2 Related Work 
The research on comparative sentence has been a 
main concern from the beginning of modern 
Chinese linguistics research. The different types 
of Chinese comparative sentences were first 
mentioned in Mashi Wentong (1898) and their 
classification was elaborated later by Chinese 
grammarians such as Lü (1942), Ding (1961) and 
Liu (1983). Following by their preliminary work, 
a series of research focused on defining syntactic 
and semantic structure of the Chinese compara-
tive sentence was conducted. Li (1986) demon-
strates the Chinese BI-structure simplifying rules. 
Shao (1990) investigates the rule of replacing 
and omitting elements in Chinese comparative 
structure. 

On the other hand, Studies in Natural Lan-
guage Processing mainly dealt with the identifi-
cation of comparative sentence and its elements. 
Based on Jindal and Liu’s research (2006) on 
comparative sentences in English, Huang(2008) 
and Song(2009) made a stochastic classifier 
based on SVMs and CRFs to tackle the Chinese 
comparative sentence identification and element 
extraction task. Besides, many models were also 
suggested in the fifth Chinese Opinion Analysis 
Evaluation (COAE2013) track. Zhou(2014) and 
Li(2013) made use of pattern matching technique, 
and Wei(2013) proposed a rule-based decision 
making approach based on CRF sequential tag-

79



ging. Despite all these models, their performance 
has not shown satisfying results1. The identifica-
tion of Chinese comparative elements especially 
still remains as a big challenge. A TBL-based 
approach, which showed good performance in 
Korean (Yang and Ko, 2011), would be an alter-
native to usual methods. 

3 Task Description 

3.1 Comparative Elements (CE) 
We refer to Comparative Elements (CE) as enti-
ties and attributes which directly occur within 
comparative sentences. We defined 6 CEs as be-
low. 
 
e.g. 新飞度车身结构的刚度比前代提高了 164％。
The solidity of XinFeiDu’s body structure has increased 164% than the 
previous design. 
 

新飞度  刚度  比   前代     提高  164％ 
XinFeiDu     solidity    BI   previous design   increased   164% 

SUB            DIM        BI           OBJ                  RES         EXT 
 

CE (label) Definition 
Subject En-
tity (SUB) 

An element of comparison, i.e. topic 
of the sentence.  

Comparative 
Marker (BI) 

Comparative sentence marker, which 
is BI(比) in Chinese Bi-structure2. 

Object Enti-
ty(OBJ) 

An entity that is being compared to. It 
is often the complement of Bi-
prepositional phrase.  

Dimension 
(DIM) 

Shared property of entities being 
compared. 

Comparative 
Result 
(RES) 

The relation between entities being 
compared. It is often the syntactic 
head of comparative predicate. 

Comparative 
Extent 
(EXT) 

Relative difference in degree or quan-
tity between entities in terms of DIM.  

Table 1: Comparative Elements (CE) in BI-structure 
 
Our task is to automatically extract these 6 CEs 
from the sentences. Note that these elements 
cannot simply be determined by syntactic criteria. 
They are involved with semantic category to 
some extent, but we do not use additional seman-
tic features such as semantic role labels or lexical 
taxonomies in this paper.  

1 In COAE 2013 Task 2 (Chinese Comparative Element Identifi-
cation), the best performance F1-score was 0.35 (Tan et al. 
2013:25). 

2 There are other comparative markers such as 比不过, 不如, 优
于 which are sometimes combined with RES morphologically. 
However, BI(比) is the only comparative marker in the scope of 
this paper. 

3.2 Corpus 
The corpus used in this experiment consists of 
1,036 Chinese BI-structure sentences, coming 
from the open dataset of COAE 2013 Task 2 
(Tan et al. 2013). The sentences are a collection 
of customer reviews and opinions from different 
Chinese websites pertaining to cars and electron-
ics. 

1) Preprocessing: We first conduct word 
segmentation and POS tagging by using 
ICTCLAS3. Second, we had to manually revise 
to avoid any errors because of the informal lan-
guage used on the web. Three annotators were 
appointed to revise typos. In addition, 3,000 
word-size domain-specific lexicons4 are also uti-
lized to guarantee the quality of word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging. 

2) CE labeling: The 6 types of Comparative 
Elements (CE) in the 1,036 sentences were man-
ually annotated with the corresponding CE labels 
of Table 1. This task was done by three trained 
annotators of Chinese linguistics major. Their 
work was double-checked by one another, and 
any inconsistencies between annotators were dis-
cussed before reaching an agreement. The anno-
tated corpus was then transformed to IOB format.  

4 Two methods of Comparative Ele-
ments Extraction 

We now present two different proposed tech-
niques. Model 1 uses basic part-of-speech chunk-
ing-based method and Model 2 employs Trans-
formation-Based Error-Driven Learning (TBL) 
(Brill, 1995) for identifying CEs. 

4.1 POS chunking-based CE extraction 
4 elements of CEs, i.e. BI, OBJ, RES and EXT, 
form a regular sequential pattern across the sen-
tences. First, OBJ generally occurs as comple-
ments of BI-prepositional phrase, which is most-
ly a noun phrase. Second, RES and EXT usually 
form predicates, modified by the BI-
prepositional phrase, i.e. [ [比  OBJ]prep [RES 
EXT]pred]. Noticing this pattern, we can define 
chunk patterns with regular expressions as below. 

 
Punctuation as delimiter, the sentence is divided 
into small clauses  
If the clause contains“比/p”, the following chunk 
rules are applied to create chunks.

Table 2: chunking-based CE extraction process5 
 
We now give a step-by-step illustration of the 
actual extraction process of Table 2. 
 
Step 1  Detecting BI (比)-Chunk 
For clauses containing the comparative marker 
BI (比), we create a chunk that begins with it 
(Rule 1). We call it BI (比)-Chunk. 

 
 
Step 2  Splitting into Two Phrases 
BI (比)-Chunk can be divided into two chunks, 
i.e. BI-prepositional phrase and predicate be-
cause they belong to very distinctive syntactic 
categories. The former cannot appear inde-
pendently, usually taking a noun as its object. 
The latter functions as the predicate, and is most-
ly an adjective or a verb 6 . Therefore, we de-
signed Rule 2 to split them. 

 
 
Step 3  Merging Incorrectly Separated Predicates 
In most cases, however, the predicate is a com-
plex phrasal structure. Therefore, Rule 2 incor-
rectly splits chunk that should have not been sep-

5 For specifying chunk rules intuitively, we directly quote 
NLTK’s description of chunking operator (Bird et al. 2009). 

(1) <T> represents for any token tagged with T. 
(2) {<pattern >} represents for Chunk Rule, which means cre-

ating a chunk with the given regex pattern within curly 
braces. 

(3) <pattern1>}{<pattern2> represents for Split Rule, which 
means splitting a chunk into two chunks based on the speci-
fied pattern. 

(4) <pattern1>{}<pattern2> represents for Merge Rule, which 
means merging two chunks together based on the specified 
pattern. 

6 Strictly speaking, verb and adjective are also able to occur in 
BI- prepositional phrase. Such a case will be handled in Step 4. 

arated. To solve this, we employ Rule 3 to merge 
incorrectly divided elements of the predicate 
group. 

 
 
Step 4  Dealing with DE (的)-Structure 
In Chinese, DE (的) is often used to mark modi-
fication7. It can be attached to various types of 
syntactic categories and modify the following 
word. DE (的 )-structure can be simplified as 
[ [ XP 的 ] NP ]. When a verb or adjective phrase 
takes the position of XP, the same error as in 
Step 3 occurs. To tackle this problem, we use 
Rule 4 that enunciates the unity of modifying 
elements occurring at the position of XP. 

  
 

Note that DE (的) is not necessarily restrict-
ed to modification marker. When occurring at the 
end of the sentence, it simply marks a subjective 
tone. Rule 4 makes use of punctuation tag (WJ) 
to discern this modal particle of DE (的) from 
modification marker. 

  
 
Step 5  CE Labeling 
After successfully extracting the two chunks (BI-
prepositional phrase and predicate) following the 
above mentioned 4 steps, we label each item in 
these chunks with BI, OBJ and RES tags. 
 
Step 6 (optional)  EXT Identification 
Comparative Extent (EXT) usually begins with 
numerals, following the head of the predicate. 
Rule 5 detects possible EXTs in RES chunk. 

 
 

4.2 TBL-based CE extraction 
The advantage of using the POS chunking-based 
method is that it allows direct capture of linguis-
tic information. However, (a) it requires pains-
taking process of manual rule construction; (b) 

7 It may be an inadequate way of defining DE (的) because of its 
flexible and diverse nature. Exceptional cases will be discussed in 
5.1. See Zhu(1961) for further details.

and an error in any step could damage the per-
formance of the whole CE extraction process. 

4.2.1 Transformation-Based Learning 
We tested an automated learning method, known 
as Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning 
(TBL) (Brill, 1995). The basic idea of TBL is 
“learning from mistakes”. First, the researcher 
may apply an initial-state annotator to the train-
ing corpus. Second, the set of user-defined tem-
plates are then used to form candidate rules. 
Third, each of the rules is in turn applied to the 
training corpus. At the same time, the net im-
provement of the rule is calculated and recorded 
for evaluation of candidate rules. Throughout the 
training, the process of deriving rules, scoring 
and selecting rules and applying them is iterated, 
creating an ordered sequence of transformation 
rules. 
 

 
Figure 1: Learning Procedure of TBL 

Modified from Brill(1995), Ramshaw and Marcus(1999) 
 

TBL has a well-known advantage, i.e. perspicui-
ty of linguistically meaningful rules. Different 
from the POS chunking-based model, the TBL-
based model is more robust and possibly cap-
tures useful information that may not be noticed 
by the human engineer (Brill, 1995:552). There-
fore, the use of TBL allows us to capture some 
otherwise ignored CE patterns. 

4.2.2 Preliminary TBL-based CE Tagger 
We treated CE extraction task as a tagging prob-
lem. Each token in training data is given an ini-
tial tag by ICTCLAS tagger. The TBL learner 
with user-defined templates is then trained on the 
training data. Consequently, we obtain the TBL-
based CE tagger as a CE extraction model. 

The templates play a key role in this model 
because the TBL-learner uses these templates to 
generate possible rules, which directly affect the 
overall performance. In order to see which type 
of feature contributes more to the TBL-based 
model accuracy rate, we divide the original tem-
plate proposed in Brill (1995:553, 556) into three 
template subsets: (a) tag features template; (b) 

lexical features template; (c) both features tem-
plate.

(c) Tag & Lexicon 26 81,257 88.38 

Table 3: CE Extraction Accuracy based on different 
feature templates 
 

Since the result of (c) is the best, we take it 
as a standard template. Table 4 shows evaluation 
results using TBL-based model with 26 tem-
plates (c). We regard this score as our baseline 
performance.

Table 4: The result of baseline system (%) 

4.2.3 Search for Optimal Template 
We now present how we obtained our proposed 
TBL-based CE extraction model. The baseline 
system is based on a relatively large amount of 
rules and templates. Therefore, the reduction of 
rules is preferable for efficient application of 
TBL. According to Brill (1995: 560), although 
the accuracy of TBL-based tagger increases with 
the number of transformation rules, its marginal 
effect dramatically decreases, and leads to com-
putational cost. We found that 200~300 rules are 
desirable for our CE detecting task. As for tem-
plates, we achieved the best performance when 
using tag and lexicon sequences within a radius 
of 3 tokens as features. 
 

For every token in BI-structure, change tag a to tag b 
when: 
1. The current word is w. W0 
2. One of the three preceding words 

is tagged z. 
T-3,-2,-1 

3. One of the three following words 
is tagged z. 

T1, 2, 3 

4. The word two after is tagged z. T2 
5. The word two before is tagged z. T-2 
6. The following word is tagged z. T1 
7. The preceding word is tagged z. T-1 
8. The preceding word is w. W-1 
9. The current word is w, and the 

preceding tag is t. 
W0 & T-1 

10. The preceding tag is t, the current 
tag is t2 and the following word is w.  

T-1 &T0&W1

Based on the above-mentioned templates, the 
TBL-based model generates a set of possible 
candidate rules. Table 6 lists 10 transformation 
rules of highest score. 
 

Pass Old tag Context New tag

Table 6: 10 Rules of highest score 
 

With the rules given above, the model takes 
example (1a) as an input, and applies the rules in 
order of 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 9, produc-
ing the CE-tagged result of example (1b).

In addition, Examples (2-5) below illustrate 

some of the linguistically meaningful transfor-
mation rules that the TBL model based on 10 
templates (Table 5) has captured. 

(2) VYOU->RES if Word:更@[-1]

(This product) has more amounts for the same price.

(A car model’s something) should be much more than a Jetta’s. 
 

In (2-3), “更” is equivalent to “more” in English, 
and “要” conveys subjective meaning of differ-
ence in degree. The proposed model makes use 
of them as an RES marker because they frequent-
ly occur before RES. 

(4)  RZ->OBJ if Word:比@[-1]

比/bi 老/obj 天籁/obj 的/ude1 油漆/dim 硬/res 好/ext

(A car model’s coating) is much stronger than the coatings of Teana. 

 

In (4), the pronoun following BI “其它” is likely 
to be a constituent of OBJ. “好” is very likely to 
be a degree complement, i.e. EXT, if RES pre-
cedes it. Instead of functioning as RES, it stress-
es the degree of RES as shown in example (5). 

5 Results 

5.1 Result of POS Chunking-based Model 
The overall performance of the chunking-based 
CE extraction model (Section 4.1) is as follow.

Precision 96.94 75.96 42.03 63.33 
Recall 96.94 82.63 86.65 60.03 
F-score 96.94 79.15 56.60 61.63 

Table 7: The results of chunking-based CE extraction (%) 
 

The CE mining process of chunking-based model 
is based on simplistic grammatical assumptions: 
(a) Only nominal elements serve as the comple-
ment of BI-prepositional phrase; (b) Predicates 
can be a word or a group of words (phrase) that 
are adjectives or verbs; (c) Within the BI (比)-
Chunk, the elements occurring before the modi-
fier marker DE (的) are all regarded as modifier. 
These assumptions, of course, are somewhat 
over-generalized, and do not fit in many real cas-
es8. However, the 5 Rules applied based on these 
assumptions show a fair performance in Table 7 
when applied to a limited scope of BI-Chunk. 

5.2 Result of TBL-based Model 
All evaluations of TBL-based model in this 

paper are based on a 5-fold cross validation. The 
proposed TBL-based model with 10 templates 
shows the results below.  

 
 SUB DIM BI OBJ RES EXT 
Pre. 53.35 62.13 97.41 77.16 87.94 79.78 
Rec. 23.04 40.70 97.04 83.15 69.50 72.31 
F. 31.88 48.46 97.22 80.01  77.58 75.79 

Table 8: The results of TBL-based CE extraction (%) 
 

Guided by our new templates (Table 5), the 
model first locates comparative marker BI (比), 
then searches the surroundings for the tag/lexical 
features while gradually narrowing its scope. As 
a result, the 10 templates enable an effective de-
tection of elusive CE instances such as those in 
example (2-7). 

8 Under many circumstances in Chinese, a noun (or noun phrase) 
can also serve as predicate; Transferred-designation(转指) “XP 的” 
construction can also act as subject other than as a modifier.

Table 9: Comparison between models (f-score, %) 
 

Table 9 compares the scores of two CE mining 
methods, the POS chunking-based and the TBL-
based approach. Compared to the TBL-based 
model, the POS chunking-based model is unable 
to extract SUB and DIM. Because these two el-
ements frequently occur outside a BI-
prepositional phrase, it is hard to capture their 
irregular occurrence positions in the sentence. In 
contrast, the TBL-based model is able to detect 
SUB and DIM. However, their identification rate 
is relatively low. 

Nevertheless, our proposed TBL-based 
model outperforms the baseline system by using 
much smaller templates. It shows we found a 
simple and more expressive set of rule templates. 

Moreover, the proposed TBL-based model 
achieved an increase of 21% for RES and 14% 
for EXT f-score in comparison with the POS 
chunking-based model. This improvement main-
ly benefits from the proper use of both tag and 
lexical information.

(b) RES->EXT if Word:近@[0] 

花冠/nz 比/bi 伊兰特/obj 贵/res 近/ext 3 万/ext 

As for examples (6-7), the POS chunking-based 
model (Section 4.1) incorrectly identifies “少, 近” 
as RES. As we can see in example (6a), the POS 
chunking-based model wrongly identifies “很少” 
as RES because the BI-chunk “比它靓” occurs 
in front of the modification marker “的”. In (7a), 

the model mistook “近” for RES because it can-
not discern “近” from “贵” only with the tag in-
formation. In contrast, TBL-based model makes 
a correct decision of (6b) and (7b) based on lexi-
cal information. 

6 Conclusion 
In order to make the best use of meaningful fea-
tures in linguistic context, we have proposed the 
use of two rule-based methods for Chinese com-
parative element (CE) extraction. The POS 
chunking-based model performs well with basic 
Chinese grammatical rules. We then use the 
TBL-based method to extract other linguistic 
patterns that the first model can hardly detect. 
Results showed that our TBL-based model 
achieved higher score than Brill’s (1995), 
demonstrating that our new 10 templates can ef-
fectively extract the distinct features of Chinese

volves techniques of various domains including 
coreference resolution, named entity recognition 
and parsing. However, the linguistic features 
used in this paper are limited to instances of reg-
ular (type-3) grammars. In our future work, we 
plan to investigate some feasible Chinese linguis-
tic features on the level of context-free grammars.
