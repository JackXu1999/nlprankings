Abstract

The existence of translation divergence precludes straightforward mapping in machine translation
(MT) system. An increase in the number of divergences also increases the complexity, especially
in linguistically motivated transfer-based MT systems. In other words, divergence is directly
proportional to the complexity of MT. Here we propose a divergence index (DI) to quantify the
number of parametric variations between languages, which helps in improving the success rate
of MT. This paper deals with how to build divergence index for a given language pair by giving
examples between Telugu and Tamil, the major Dravidian languages spoken in South India. It
also proposes handling strategies to overcome these divergences. The presentation of the paper
also includes a live demo of Telugu-Tamil MT.

1 Introduction

In MT, there are a number of methods that are being practiced all over the world, chiefly, they are
direct, interlingual, transfer-based methods and a combination of these beside the statistical and corpus
based methods. This paper discusses the development of transfer-based Telugu-Tamil MT system with
a special reference to divergences. In the development of MT1, linguistically-grounded classification of
divergence types need to be formally defined and systematically resolved. Identifying such divergences
is the most significant part that facilitates the design and implementation of MT systems. As divergences
are encountered as the specific problem in MT, identifying these are also the most crucial to obtain
qualitatively a better output.

Divergence between languages may vary from one language pair to another. An increase in the number
of divergence also increases the complexity in building an MT. In other words, it can be stated that
divergence is directly proportional to the complexity of MT. Measuring divergence between languages
supports to ascertain effort justification to build an MT for the proposed languages. Here we propose
a divergence index (DI) to quantify the number of parametric variations between languages. DI also
classifies divergence exhaustively into different levels in order to understand its depth. It facilitates MT
in proposing where to put efforts for the given language pair to attain a better result.

2 Telugu-Tamil MT

Telugu and Tamil are major Dravidian languages with rich literary tradition sharing indubitable linguis-
tic similarities and dissimilarities. An MT between them may be viewed as a bridge to understand and
share the richness of both the languages. The MT system demonstrated here is a completely automatic
translation system without human interference for the first time involving Telugu and Tamil. It is one of
the successfully implemented systems under Indian language to Indian language(IL-IL) MT2.

The Telugu-Tamil MT system is an assembly of various linguistic modules run on specific engines
whose output is sequentially maneuvered and modified by a series of modules till the output is generated.
It employs three stage architecture:

Stage 1: Source language analysis
Stage 2: Source language to target language transfer
Stage 3: Target language generation

The most crucial linguistic modules in Source Language analysis include a Morphological Analyzer
(MA), Parts of Speech Tagger (POS), Chunker, Named Entity Recognizer (NER), Simple Parser (SP)
and the Source Language to Target Language Transfer Module includes Multi Word Expression (MWE)
component, Transfer Grammar (TG) Component, Lexical Transfer component consisting of a synset
and bilingual lexicons and in Target Language Generation includes Agreement (AGR) modules and a
Morphological Generator (MG). All the modules have been integrated on the platform called Dashboard
based on black board architecture (Pawan et al, 2010) which configures data flow in a specified pipeline.

The architecture of Telugu-Tamil MT system is given below:

3 Translation Divergence

The term ‘Translation Divergence’ refers to distinctions or differences that occur between languages
when they are translated. It is realized when the source language content is decoded differently in the
target language and affects the ‘well-formedness’ of the target language. According to Dorr (1993), the
translation divergence occurs when the underlying concept or ‘gist’ of a sentence is distributed over dif-

Language Technology Laboratory, Centre for Applied Linguistics and Tanslation Studies(CALTS), University of Hyderabad.

ferent words or in different configurations for different languages. The notion of divergence in MT is
comparable to the linguistically motivated notion of parameteric variation i.e. cross-linguistic distinc-
tions.

Telugu and Tamil in spite of being cognate languages, exhibit considerable amount of divergences in
various levels affecting the quality of output. In most of the cases, Dorr’s divergences are noticed as rare
phenomena and do not pose much problem as far as Telugu and Tamil are considered. However, these
language pairs do pose problems at various other levels displaying different divergences. The current
research attempts to classify these divergences into three major kinds, such as morphological, syntactic
and lexical-semantic divergences.

4 Divergence Index

Divergence index (DI) represents a measure of the differences that occur between languages. The
variations of linguistic features can be seen at any levels (L) in terms of surface, shallow and deep
levels of languages. These levels are identified as L1, L2, L3 etc., according to its depth of variation.
Identifying the divergence with its level between a pair of languages enables one to compute and quantify
the effort that is required to build an MT. DI uses a table that attributes to features to identify and
classify divergences exhaustively into different levels in order to understand its depth. It facilitates MT
in proposing where to put effort for the given language pair to obtain a better result.

4.1 Divergence Index Table
Languages may share certain features or differ with each other. When they differ, it indicates that

a certain feature is encoded differently or not available in one of the languages. This is a cause for
divergence. Table 1 provides instances where divergences are possible with reference to a given feature
in the said languages. Y indicates that the feature is available in a language and N indicates not. When
both the languages share similar features (see Table 1 (1.) and (2.)), it means no divergence (indicated
by 0). When they differ (see Table 1 (3.) and (4.)), there arises divergence (indicate by 1).

S.No SL feature TL feature Divergence
Index

1. Y Y 0
2. N N 0
3. Y N 1
4. N Y 1
5. Y/N Y/N 0
6. Y/N Y 1
7. Y/N N 1
8. Y Y/N 0
9. N Y/N 0

Table 1: Divergence Index Table

In certain cases, Y/N is given to indicate optional in the use of a feature. When both source language
(SL) and target language (TL) show optional, it means no divergence (see Table 1 (5.)). When only
SL shows optional, it is counted as divergence because TL element may not be directly mapped when
the option differs (see Table 1 (6.) and (7.)). When the option occurs only in TL, it is counted as no
divergence (see Table 1 (8.) and (9.)) because TL optionally behaves like SL, hence SL features can be
directly mapped to TL.

4.2 Morphological Divergence Index
Morphological divergences, here, we refer to divergences that occur due to inflectional and productive

derivational devices of words between Telugu and Tamil. Open word class categories such as nouns,

50



verbs and adjectives and closed word classes such as pronouns, number words and nouns of space and
time (NST) are studied to find out morphological divergences. Functional elements on these categories
need to be carefully matched from the source language to the target language to attain well-formed
wordforms in the output. Uninflected word classes i.e. indeclinables and non-productive derivational
wordforms are excluded here because they are listed in the lexicon and straightforward mapping between
them solves the problem in MT.
For example , nouns in Telugu and Tamil are major word classes inflecting for number and case. The
major inflectional differences occur due to two reasons i.e. (1) the choice of items in terms of inflections
viz., the oblique stem formation, case and postposition and (2) the order of their presentation. For
instance, the Table 2 explicates the differences.

Table 2: Postpositions

As seen in the table 2 (No. 1-3), certain postpositions require their complement nouns differently case
marked between Telugu and Tamil. Also as shown in Table 2 (No. 4) the order of suffixes in Telugu and
Tamil may differ. The difference is explicated as below:

Te. Noun- ±Number suffix- ±Stem-formative- ±Postposition- ±Case Suffix
Ta. Noun- ±Number suffix- ±Stem-formative- ±Case Suffix- ±Postposition
The divergence index for Table 2 is built as below:

2. Semblative Y Y 0/L1

Accusative case marker N Y 1/L2
4. Locative:Interior:Direction Y Y 0/L1

Dative case marker with PSP Y N 1/L2

In predicative positions, nouns in Telugu agree with their subjects in the first person singular and
plural, and in the second person singular and exhibit explicit overt markings unlike Tamil. Consider the
following in Table 4.

Table 4: Nominal predicates in Telugu and Tamil

These kind of divergences need to be noticed and handled strategically in the target language Tamil
since it does not express these details on nominal predicates. Morphological divergences are mainly
handled by the morphological generator (MG), the target language (TL) generation module. MG is
equipped with inbuilt morphological features of TL which generates acceptable TL. Other modules such
as parser, transfer grammar (TG), lexical transfer (LT) and agreement (AGR) modules do involve in
handling morphological divergence.

4.3 Syntactic Divergence Index
Syntactic divergence here we refer to syntactic structural differences that occur between pairs of
languages. It is obvious to find out similar constructions in Telugu and Tamil in majority of cases
but still there are lots of variations arise due to case mismatches, agreement, anaphora, negation,
subordination and clitics. Various syntactic processing and a robust transfer grammar are obviously
required to overcome syntactic divergence.

For example, each case marker has a number of functions and it is obvious that they lead to case
mismatches in MT. The difference in form and function of a case in the source language precludes the
straightforward mapping of it in the target language. For instance, Telugu and Tamil agree in using the
dative case marker in various functions viz., beneficiary of an action, goal of motion, experiencer subject
(Cf. Krishnamurti, 2003:434; Verma and Mohanan, 1990:27) among other functions. However, to
express a possessive relationship between two inanimate nouns, one of the nouns of inanimate category
carries the dative marker to express the locative function in Telugu. On the contrary, the locative case
marker is in use in Tamil. Example:

Syntactic divergences are mainly handled by TG. TG is equipped with performing certain tasks such
as insertion, deletion, modification and re-ordering of words and chunks. It also has the ability to handle
files where it is possible to operate a single rule over a list of items.

4.4 Lexical-Semantic Divergence Index
Lexical-semantic translation divergences are characterized by properties that are entirely lexically

determined between languages. A concept expressed by a lexeme may not have the similar meaning in
all contexts. The major lexical-semantic divergences that occur between Telugu and Tamil are due to the
nature of its semantic compositions and their formal collocation in their expression.

For example, a lexeme, used to express a concept in a language may not have the same meaning in all
contexts. When it has multiple meanings, word sense disambiguation is required to overcome lexical
ambiguity and to select an appropriate sense with its form in the target language.

For instance, the lexeme kut.t.u in Telugu is ambiguous and expresses three different senses as given
below:
Sense 1: kut.t.u ‘to bite’ as in the context of cı̄ma ‘an ant’ and etc. The equivalent word in Tamil is kat.i
‘to bite’.
Sense 2: kut.t.u ‘to stitch’ as in the context of bat.t.alu ‘clothings’. The equivalent word in Tamil is tai ‘to
stitch’.

52



Sense 3: kut.t.u ‘to pierce’ as in the context of cevulu ‘ears’ or body parts and etc. The equivalent word
in Tamil is kuttu ‘to pierce’.

Lexical-semantic divergences are handled by MWE component and LT. MWE component contains a
lexical database consisting words of co-occurrence. When a group of words are identified as MWE, this
module transfers them into the acceptable target language expression. Lexical ambiguities are handled
by TG. An exhaustive set of transfer grammar rules operating on identification of the ambiguous words
and disambiguating them by looking at the subject or the object nouns as suggested above are built. For
instance, the following TG rules are samples to handle the different senses of Telugu word kut.t.u in Tamil.

V1:R1::"$x=animate.txt"
R1: NP<root="$x",lcat="n"> VGF<root="kut.t.u",lcat="v"> =>
NP<root="$x", lcat="n"> VGF<root="kat.i",lcat="v">
V2:R2::"$y=inanimate.txt"
R2: NP<root="$y",lcat="n"> VGF<root="kut.t.u",lcat="v"> =>
NP<root="$y", lcat="n"> VGF<root="tai",lcat="v">
V3:R3::"$z=bodyparts.txt"
R3: NP<root="$z",lcat="n"> VGF<root="kut.t.u",lcat="v"> =>
NP<root="$z", lcat="n"> VGF<root="kuttu",lcat="v">

5 Conclusion

Though Tamil and Telugu belong to the same language family (Dravidian language family), some major
and minor differences are found in their linguistic behavior which preclude any straightforward mapping.
To avoid this, it is essential to formalize the divergent patterns and develop a certain number of rules as
the case demands to have a successful system with broad coverage. Building divergence Index is proved
to be a useful activity to identify and handle divergences effectively in transfer-based MT.
