Abstract

We build parallel FDA5 (ParFDA) Moses
statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tems for all language pairs in the workshop
on statistical machine translation (Bojar et
al., 2015) (WMT15) translation task and
obtain results close to the top with an av-
erage of 3.176 BLEU points difference us-
ing significantly less resources for build-
ing SMT systems. ParFDA is a paral-
lel implementation of feature decay algo-
rithms (FDA) developed for fast deploy-
ment of accurate SMT systems (Biçici,
2013; Biçici et al., 2014; Biçici and
Yuret, 2015). ParFDA Moses SMT sys-
tem we built is able to obtain the top
TER performance in French to English
translation. We make the data for build-
ing ParFDA Moses SMT systems for
WMT15 available: https://github.
com/bicici/ParFDAWMT15.

1 Parallel FDA5 (ParFDA)

Statistical machine translation performance is in-
fluenced by the data: if you already have the
translations for the source being translated in your
training set or even portions of it, then the transla-
tion task becomes easier. If some token does not
appear in your language model (LM), then it be-
comes harder for the SMT engine to find its cor-
rect position in the translation. The importance of
ParFDA increases with the proliferation of train-
ing material available for building SMT systems.
Table 1 presents the statistics of the available train-
ing and LM corpora for the constrained (C) sys-
tems in WMT15 (Bojar et al., 2015) as well as the
statistics of the ParFDA selected training and LM
data.

ParFDA (Biçici, 2013; Biçici et al., 2014) runs
separate FDA5 (Biçici and Yuret, 2015) models on

randomized subsets of the training data and com-
bines the selections afterwards. FDA5 is avail-
able at http://github.com/bicici/FDA. We run
ParFDA SMT experiments using Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007) in all language pairs in WMT15 (Bojar
et al., 2015) and obtain SMT performance close
to the top constrained Moses systems. ParFDA al-
lows rapid prototyping of SMT systems for a given
target domain or task.

We use ParFDA for selecting parallel training
data and LM data for building SMT systems. We
select the LM training data with ParFDA based on
the following observation (Biçici, 2013):

No word not appearing in the training
set can appear in the translation.

Thus we are only interested in correctly ordering
the words appearing in the training corpus and col-
lecting the sentences that contain them for build-
ing the LM. At the same time, a compact and more
relevant LM corpus is also useful for modeling
longer range dependencies with higher order n-
gram models. We use 3-grams for selecting train-
ing data and 2-grams for LM corpus selection.

2 Results

We run ParFDA SMT experiments for all lan-
guage pairs in both directions in the WMT15
translation task (Bojar et al., 2015), which include
English-Czech (en-cs), English-German (en-de),
English-Finnish (en-fi), English-French (en-fr),
and English-Russian (en-ru). We truecase all of
the corpora, set the maximum sentence length to
126, use 150-best lists during tuning, set the LM
order to a value in [7, 10] for all language pairs,
and train the LM using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)
with -unk option. For GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003), max-fertility is set to 10, with the num-
ber of iterations set to 7,3,5,5,7 for IBM mod-
els 1,2,3,4, and the HMM model, and 70 word

Table 1: Data statistics for the available training and LM corpora in the constrained (C) setting compared
with the ParFDA selected training and LM data. #words is in millions (M) and #sents in thousands (K).

classes are learned over 3 iterations with the mk-
cls tool during training. The development set con-
tains up to 5000 sentences randomly sampled from
previous years’ development sets (2010-2014) and
remaining come from the development set for
WMT15.

2.1 Statistics

The statistics for the ParFDA selected training
data and the available training data for the con-
strained translation task are given in Table 1. For
en and fr, we have access to the LDC Gigaword
corpora (Parker et al., 2011; Graff et al., 2011),
from which we extract only the story type news.
The size of the LM corpora includes both the
LDC and the monolingual LM corpora provided
by WMT15. Table 1 shows the significant size
differences between the constrained dataset (C)
and the ParFDA selected data and also present the
source and target coverage (SCOV and TCOV) in
terms of the 2-grams of the test set. The quality
of the training corpus can be measured by TCOV,
which is found to correlate well with the BLEU
performance achievable (Biçici, 2011).

The space and time required for building the

ParFDA Moses SMT systems are quantified in Ta-
ble 2 where size is in MB and time in minutes. PT
stands for the phrase table. We used Moses ver-
sion 3.0, from www.statmt.org/moses. Building
a ParFDA Moses SMT system can take about half
a day.

2.2 Translation Results

ParFDA Moses SMT results for each translation
direction together with the LM order used and
the top constrained submissions to WMT15 are
given in Table 3 1, where BLEUc is cased BLEU.
ParFDA significantly reduces the time required for
training, development, and deployment of an SMT
system for a given translation task. The average
difference to the top constrained submission in
WMT15 is 3.176 BLEU points whereas the dif-
ference was 3.49 BLEU points in WMT14 (Biçici
et al., 2014). Performance improvement over last
year’s results is likely due to using higher order
n-grams for data selection. ParFDA Moses SMT
system is able to obtain the top TER performance
in fr-en.

2.3 LM Data Quality

A LM selected for a given translation task allows
us to train higher order language models, model
longer range dependencies better, and achieve
lower perplexity as shown in Table 4. We compare
the perplexity of the ParFDA selected LM with a
LM trained on the ParFDA selected training data
and a LM trained using all of the available training
corpora. We build LM using SRILM with inter-
polated Kneser-Ney discounting (-kndiscount
-interpolate). We also use -unk option to
build open-vocabulary LM. We are able to achieve
significant reductions in the number of OOV to-
kens and the perplexity, reaching up to 78% reduc-
tion in the number of OOV tokens and up to 63%
reduction in the perplexity. ParFDA can achieve
larger reductions in perplexity than the 27% that
can be achieved using a morphological analyzer
and disambiguator for Turkish (Yuret and Biçici,
2009) and can decrease the OOV rate at a similar
rate. Table 4 also presents the average log prob-
ability of tokens and the log probability of token
<unk>. The increase in the ratio between them in

the last column shows that OOV in ParFDA LM
are not just less but also less likely at the same
time.

3 Conclusion

We use ParFDA for solving computational scala-
bility problems caused by the abundance of train-
ing data for SMT models and LMs and still
achieve SMT performance that is on par with the
top performing SMT systems. ParFDA raises the
bar of expectations from SMT with highly accu-
rate translations and lower the bar to entry for
SMT into new domains and tasks by allowing fast
deployment of SMT systems. ParFDA enables
a shift from general purpose SMT systems to-
wards task adaptive SMT solutions. We make the
data for building ParFDA Moses SMT systems for
WMT15 available: https://github.com/
bicici/ParFDAWMT15.
