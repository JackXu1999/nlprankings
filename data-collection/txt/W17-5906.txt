Abstract 

This paper presents a Chinese spelling 

check approach based on language 

models combined with string match 

algorithm to treat the problems result-

ed from the influence caused by Can-

tonese mother tone. N-grams first used 

to detecting the probability of sentence 

constructed by the writers, a string 

matching algorithm  called  Knuth-

Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm  is used 

to detect and correct the error. Accord-

ing to the experimental results, the 

proposed approach can detect the error 

and provide the corresponding correc-

tion.  

1 Introduction 

In recent years, Chinese became more and 

more popular. Not only the Asian learning it as a 

mother language, but also people around the 

world learning as the second language. But Chi-

nese is not easy to learn for almost every kinds of 

people. Due to the diversity of Chinese characters 

and flexibility of grammars, Chinese spelling cor-

rection plays an important role in both foreign 

learners and Natural Language Processing re-

searchers. 

Traditional Chinese is a sophisticated art. 

With Cantonese, it could be even harder. The 

high-educated may sometimes spell it wrong, not 

to mention those who are learning it. Because of 

the following reasons, Traditional Chinese is more 

difficult to learn than other languages. First, the 

Chinese’s grammar is more complicated and more 

flexible than English’s. For Cantonese usage, the 

orderings of some characters are sometimes incor-

rect. Second, Chinese characters are evolved from 

by Hieroglyphic. Every single character has its 

own meanings, but two or more characters com-

bined to a word can express a whole different 

meaning. Therefore, we can simply classify the er-

rors to Typo, which is spelling error, Cantonese 

usage, and ordering error. In this paper, we pro-

posed the Chinese spelling check with Cantonese 

correction system using N-gram language model 

and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm. It can 

detect the spelling error and Cantonese usage 

form a sentence, then give the suggested correc-

tion. 

In NLP-TEA 2017, a share task for Chinese 

spelling check (CSC) aims to detect and correct 

the spell errors in text. There are three error types 

defined in Table 1. ‘Typo’ for spelling error, ‘Can-

tonese’ for only Cantonese usage, ‘reorder’ for in-

correct order in Cantonese usage. Some typical 

examples of the errors are shown in Table 1. For 

this shared task, each input could have multiple 

errors, which means that it might need several 

phrases to process each input sentence. As the re-

sult of that, the proposed system is divided as two 

phrases, Preprocessing phrase and Chinese 

spelling check with Cantonese correction phrase.

For each input sentence, the system should 

output the location, length, and the corresponding 

correction. In order to address the problem, we 

need to establish Cantonese to Traditional Chinese 

dictionary. NLP-TEA 2017 released a dictionary 

about 1000 words, then we according to an open 

traditional Chinese and Cantonese dictionary  

(http://kaifangcidian.com/han/yue) added up to 

8000 words. Figure 1 shows the example of Can-

tonese usage errors detected by the proposed sys-

tem and Figure 2 shows the example of typo error 

errors detected by the proposed system.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 

describe the proposed method of Chinese spelling 

check with Cantonese correction system. Section 

3 we analyze the performance in experimental re-

sults of the proposed system. Finally, Section 4 

the conclusion of this paper. 

2 The Proposed Method 

In this section, the processing flow is shown as 

follow. The proposed system is divided as two 

main phrases: Preprocessing phrase and Chinese 

spelling check with Cantonese correction phrase. 

In Pre-processing phrase, we first extracting the 

information from the data that NLP-TEA 2017 re-

leased. First CKIP (Chinese Knowledge and In-

formation Processing) Auto tag was applied to do 

word segmentation and obtain part-of-

speech(POS). Then we proceed to Chinese 

spelling check phrase. Based on the POS, we de-

termine whether the words in the sentence is cor-

rect, detail will describe in section 2.1. In section 

2.2, we will describe the process of Cantonese 

correction and the algorithm we applied. 

2.1 Language Models for Error Check-
ing  

In this section, we will explain how the works, 

and the method we used for checking words in 

sentences. 

Equation 1 is the possibility of a string of charac-

ters from N-gram language model. For example, a 

string “我(I) 吃了(ate) 漢堡(hamburger)”, can ob-

tain the possibility P(“我 (I)吃了 (ate)漢堡

(hamburger)”)is equal to the production of P(“我

(I)”)P(“吃了 (ate)” | ”我 (I)”) and P(“漢堡

(hamburger)” | ”我(I) 吃了(ate)”). In which P(“漢

堡(hamburger)”|”我(I) 吃了(ate)”), “我(I)” “吃了

(ate)” is the left context dependency of ”漢堡

(hamburger)”. With this approach, we can count 

the word and calculate the words’ possibility. Fur-

thermore, use this possibility to measure whether 

the word is correct or not.

model

After, we introduced the E-HowNet and a diction-

ary of Similar Pronunciation & Shape in Chinese 

character. We input the pre-processed data into 

proposed system, comparing with E-HowNet dic-

tionary, processing flow shown as Figure 3. 

 
Figure 3: Example of comparing flow 

 

With the collection of possibly incorrect words, 

we find the similar character from the dictionary 

of Similar Pronunciation & Shape in Chinese 

character to exchange the character in word sepa-

rately. Then compare with E-HowNet dictionary 

again, if the exchanged word exists, means the ex-

changed word is correct and save it into a file. 

The following Figure 4 shows an example of 

word exchanging, we exchange a character sepa-

rately, then compare with E-HowNet dictionary, if 

the exchange result exists in E-HowNet, the pro-

cess will stop and move on to the next word.

2.2 Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm for 
Correction 

The correction system’s main algorithm is based 

on KMP string matching algorithm. The KMP al-

gorithm is used to search the specific string in a 

sentence. KMP is known for its highly effective-

ness because it can search the specific string with-

out starting over. In the middle of searching, we 

can also note down the position of the target string, 

which helps us to find out where the Cantonese 

usage is. Figure 5 shows an example of KMP al-

gorithm, as the figure shows, we can skip lots of 

searching iteration. 

 
Figure 5: Example of KMP algorithm 

 

When it comes to Cantonese correction, it is a lot 

easier than English string, because most of the 

Cantonese word are the combination of two or 

three character, word’s length is often shorter than 

the English word.  

By the using of KMP algorithm, any words that 

built in the dictionary appears in sentences, we 

will note the positon of the word and the transla-

tion of Cantonese usage. After search all the data, 

we will output a file that contain every result of 

the sentences, and according to this file output in 

the form of demanded format. 

3 Experiments and Results  

This experiment is based on the training data 

and testing data from NLP-TEA 2017. Each of the 

data contains 1000 sentences. After this experi-

ment those sentences would be labeled with error 

tags and revise them or correct tags. And the re-

sults would determine by the performance stand-

ard given by NLP-TEA 2017 workshop. The 

evaluation matrices are shown as follow:  

𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =
𝑇𝑃

𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 
   (2) 

 

𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =

There are other two standards for evaluations giv-

en by NLP-TEA 2017 workshop, Correction Per-

formance and Overall System Performance. Cor-

rection performance is for each detected error, 

contestants’ system would deliver one or more 

(five at most) correction suggestions, if correction 

suggestions are correct means that the union be-

tween the golden standard suggestions and the 

contestants’ suggestions is not null. Following is 

the formula for Correction performance,

Overall system performance means NLP-TEA 

2017 ranked performance of the system as follows, 

𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙 =
2∗𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒         ∗(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒          )

(𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒         )+𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒

The result of proposed system evaluated by NLP-

TEA 2017 is shown as follow:

4 Conclusions 

This paper main purpose is solving the NLP-TEA 

2017 shared task for Chinese spelling check with 

Cantonese usage. Our proposed methods include 

KMP algorithm string matching and N-gram lan-

guage model. According to the result of proposed 

system, it shows our system have some weakness 

should be revised. Recall rate is not ideal, it means 

that the proposed system should revised the algo-

rithm of detecting Chinese spelling. But there is 

an advantage in the proposed system, the perfor-

mance evaluation given by NLP-TEA 2017 shows 

that the correction performance of our system ar-

chives 95%. Therefore, we believe the proposed 

system is feasible. In the future, we will make an 

effort to improve the overall performance, espe-

cially on error detection to increase the recall rate.
