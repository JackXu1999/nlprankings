ABSTRACT
In this presentation I will discuss the design and implementation of Let’s MT!, a collaborative
platform for building statistical machine translation systems. The goal of this platform is to
make MT technology, that has been developed in academia, accessible for professional transla-
tors, freelancers and every-day users without requiring technical skills and deep background
knowledge of the approaches used in the backend of the translation engine. The main challenge
in this project was the development of a robust environment that can serve a growing commu-
nity and large numbers of user requests. The key for success is a distributed environment that
allows a maximum of scalability and robustness. With this in mind, we developed a modular
platform that can be scaled by adding new nodes to the different components of the system. We
opted for a cloud-based solution based on Amazon EC2 to create a cost-efficient environment
that can dynamically be adjusted to user needs and system load. In the presentation I will
explain our design of the distributed resource repository, the SMT training facilities and the
actual translation service. I will mention issues of data security and optimization of the training
procedures in order to fit our setup and the expected usage of the system.
