Rapid increase of scientific documents causes difficulty in acquiring up-to-date 

information even by experts.  Through deepening the text and document 

analysis technologies and automatic construction of knowledge bases necessary 

for document understanding, this project aims to develop foundations of 

content understanding of large scale technical documents and structural 

similarity analysis at various levels of contents and documents.  In 

collaboration with the experts in Bio-science, Material Science, Neuroscience, 

Law, and Artificial Intelligence, we aim to develop an integrated environment for 

content-based document retrieval, summarization and knowledge discovery by 

aggregating the contents from large scale documents, and survey generation by 

inter-document relation analysis.
