Abstract

Visual storytelling is an intriguing and com-
plex task that only recently entered the re-
search arena. In this work, we survey rele-
vant work to date, and conduct a thorough er-
ror analysis of three very recent approaches
to visual storytelling. We categorize and pro-
vide examples of common types of errors, and
identify key shortcomings in current work. Fi-
nally, we make recommendations for address-
ing these limitations in the future.

1 Introduction

Artificial intelligence continues to evolve, making
it increasingly plausible to develop models that in-
terpret vision and language in a humanlike man-
ner. A crucial element of such models is the ca-
pacity to not only match images with surface-level
descriptions, but to infer deeper contextual mean-
ing. Recent literature has begun to refer to this
task as visual storytelling: the generation of a co-
hesive, sequential set of natural-language descrip-
tions across multiple images (Huang et al., 2016).
Visual storytelling is distinct from image caption-
ing in that the text generated is oftentimes subjec-
tive, hinges on contextual image order, and typi-
cally employs more abstract and dynamic terms.
We illustrate the dichotomy between the two more
concretely in terms of possible sets of sentences1

for the images in Figure 1.
Sentence Set 1: (1) A woman looking at a col-

lection of tribal masks on the wall. (2) Three skulls
of varying sizes ordered from largest to smallest.
(3) A top view of a book about mythical creatures.
(4) Three people standing in a store looking at the
products. (5) An old traveling wagon that is on
display.

in some cases to increase readability) from the VIST
dataset: http://visionandlanguage.net/VIST/

Sentence Set 2: (1) I went to the natural his-
tory museum today. (2) Their evolution display
was very interesting. (3) They had an area for
cryptozoology. (4) They also have a gift shop. (5)
My favorite was this real covered wagon from 200
years ago.

The first is a set of traditional image captions,
whereas the latter represents a visual story. Note
that the former presents factual descriptions of the
images in isolation from one another. The latter
also describes the images, but places stronger em-
phasis on the development of a cohesive narrative
underlying the image sequence.

High-performing visual storytelling approaches
will enable growth for a variety of applications,
many of which are associated with language un-
derstanding tasks. They may also hold promise
as a tool for assistive technology. For instance,
it is relatively common for users to upload large
photo albums to social media platforms without
including any image descriptions at all, making
these albums inaccessible to those with sight im-
pairments. Visual storytelling could bridge this
gap by automatically generating descriptive nar-
ratives for these albums.

Despite recent interest in visual storytelling, fu-

eled by the 2018 Visual Storytelling Challenge,2

this research area is still quite nascent. To date,
no comprehensive review has been made of work
on the task. Such an analysis is necessary to spur
additional research and recommend directions for
future work. Here, we fill this void, making the
following contributions:

• We catalogue existing models for visual sto-
rytelling, comparing and contrasting them
with one another.

• We provide a performance comparison based
on the original results (when publicly avail-
able) or re-implementations (when not).

• We categorize errors into distinct types and
compile statistics indicating their frequencies
within and across models.

• We make recommendations for addressing
these errors in future visual storytelling mod-
els.

We discuss relevant prior work in Section 2, and
describe the dataset used for visual storytelling
tasks in Section 3. In Section 4 we present an
overview of the models included in our analysis,
and in Section 5 we explain how these models
were evaluated. We conduct our comprehensive
error analysis in Section 6, and make our recom-
mendations based on the outcomes of this analysis
in Section 7. We summarize these sections and re-
port our final conclusions in Section 8.

2 Related Work

We focus our analysis on methods employed by
teams that participated in the 2018 Visual Story-
telling Challenge. The challenge required partic-
ipants to make AI systems capable of generating
human-like stories from a sequence of images as
input. It had (1) an Internal Track that constrained
participants such that they could train only on data
from the Visual Storytelling (VIST) Dataset, de-
scribed further in Section 3, and use pretraining
data only from any version of the ImageNet Large
Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)3

searchers to solve a variety of large-scale object and im-
age detection tasks (Russakovsky et al., 2015): http://

and any version of the Penn Treebank;4 and (2)
an External Track that allowed participants free
reign when training, with the only requirement be-
ing that all training data be made publicly accessi-
ble if it was not already. The challenge evaluated
the quality of the generated stories using both an
automatic metric (METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005), described in further detail in Section 5.2)
and human ratings corresponding to the following
characteristics: (1) focus, (2) structure and coher-
ence, (3) inclination to share, (4) likelihood of be-
ing written by a human, (5) visual grounding qual-
ity, and (6) level of detail.5 The winning team
for the challenge was DG-DLMX (Gonzalez-Rico
and Pineda, 2018).

We perform an in-depth error analysis of the
work done by UCSB-NLP (Wang et al., 2018),
SnuBiVtt (Kim et al., 2018), and DG-DLMX
(Gonzalez-Rico and Pineda, 2018) for the Visual
Storytelling Challenge; these are the three teams
who have released publicly available source code
to date. We describe their models in further de-
tail in Sections 4.1-4.3. The other team participat-
ing in the challenge was NLPSA501 (Hsu et al.,
2018). NLPSA501 introduced a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit
(GRU) encoder-decoder model that incorporated
an inter-sentence diverse beam search as a way to
reduce redundancy in the generated stories. We
could not analyze their model’s output as we did
for those by UCSB-NLP, DG-DLMX and Snu-
BiVtt, due to the lack of available implementations
or generated stories.

Outside of the Visual Storytelling Challenge,
several other groups have explored the task of
visual storytelling. Huang et al. (2016) pub-
lished the original paper introducing the visual
storytelling task, comparing storytelling with im-
age captioning. The authors used GRUs for
both encoding the image and decoding the story.
Lukin et al. (2018) defined a pipeline for vi-
sual storytelling consisting of Object Detection,
Single-Image Inferencing, and Multi-Image Nar-
ration steps. Yu et al. (2017) employed an alter-
nate pipeline comprised of Album Encoder, Photo
Selector, and Story Generator stages. Agrawal
et al.’s (2016) approach focuses on identifying

proper sequences for existing story sentences,
rather than on generating those sentences them-
selves. Finally, Jain et al. (2017) explored a
phrase-based and syntax-based statistical machine
translation approach as a vehicle for story gen-
eration using text but no images from the VIST
dataset. The approaches developed for the Visual
Storytelling Challenge were designed to be im-
provements upon Huang et al.’s (2016) model. Al-
though the approaches explored outside the chal-
lenge are not publicly available, we consider them
when making our general recommendations.

The task of visual storytelling is still in its in-
fancy, and to date there exists no comprehensive
review of prior work in this area. Our analysis
fills this void, by summarizing relevant work in
a shared context and providing concrete compar-
isons and example output when possible. This al-
lows us to identify core areas for improvement in
future implementations, and recommend specific
actions to address these current limitations. Our
hope is that this analysis can serve as a useful
launchpad for other researchers aspiring to work
in the visual storytelling domain.

3 Data

Most visual storytelling work to date has been
trained and evaluated using the VIST Dataset
(Huang et al., 2016). VIST is the first publicly
available dataset for sequential vision-to-language
tasks, and consists of sequences or “albums” of
images wherein each image is paired with two
types of captions; namely, descriptions of images
in isolation (DII), and stories of images in se-
quence (SIS). The images were originally down-
loaded from Flickr (https://www.flickr.
com/). In total, the dataset comprises 10,117
Flickr albums containing 210,819 unique photos.

Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers se-
lected subsets of five images per album about
which to write sequential, cohesive stories. The
dataset contains 50,200 story sequences overall;
these are divided into subsets of 40,155 training,
4,990 validation and 5,055 testing stories. Five
written stories were collected per album. Three
standalone descriptions per image (DII, first de-
fined above) were also collected separately using
the image captioning interface used to build the
COCO image caption dataset (Lin et al., 2014). In
both the stories and descriptions, all people names
were replaced with generic MALE/FEMALE to-

kens, and all named entities were replaced with
their entity type (e.g., location). A small num-
ber of broken images were filtered from VIST by
most research groups. For concrete examples of
DII and SIS from VIST, we refer readers to Figure
1, where Sentence Sets 1 and 2 (see Section 1) are
from the DII and SIS subsets, respectively.

4 Methods

We analyze three of the approaches submitted to
the Visual Storytelling Challenge: AREL (Wang
et al., 2018), GLACNet (Kim et al., 2018) and
Contextualize, Show and Tell (Gonzalez-Rico and
Pineda, 2018). We selected these approaches as
the focus of our work for two reasons. First, all
were publicly available and well-documented, en-
suring easy replicability. Other existing visual
storytelling models (Huang et al., 2016; Agrawal
et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2018; Lukin
et al., 2018) would have required reimplementa-
tion. Doing so introduces the possibility of unin-
tentionally crippling performance (e.g., when set-
ting required but unreported parameters), which
we wished to avoid. Second, all were very recent
models, representing the current state of the art in
visual storytelling. We summarize AREL, GLAC-
Net, and Contextualize, Show and Tell in Sections
4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, and refer readers to the original
papers for fuller detail.

4.1 Adversarial Reward Learning (AREL)

AREL (Wang et al., 2018) is an adversarial re-
inforcement learning approach that makes use of
two models: a policy model, followed by a reward
model. The policy model is an encoder-decoder
model utilizing a CNN-recurrent neural network
(RNN) architecture, used to generate new stories.
Specifically, a pre-trained CNN is fed a sequence
of 5 images as input to extract high-level image
features. These features are passed forward and
further encoded as visual context vectors using
bidirectional GRUs. The outputs of the encoder
are then fed into a GRU-RNN decoder to generate
sub-stories for the image sequence in parallel. The
sub-stories are concatenated to form a single full
story. The CNN-based reward model is applied
to every sub-story to compute its partial reward,
and from the input sequence embeddings, n-gram
features are extracted using convolution kernels of
different sizes and passed through pooling layers.
Image features are concatenated with these sen-

tence representations and passed through a fully
connected layer to obtain the final reward. To per-
form adversarial reward learning, the models were
alternately optimized using stochastic gradient de-
scent. The objective of the story generation policy
was to maximize the similarity between a Reward
Boltzmann distribution and itself. The first model
optimized the policy to minimize the KL diver-
gence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) between itself
and the Boltzmann Distribution, and the second
model attempted to (a) minimize the KL diver-
gence with the empirical distribution, and (b) max-
imize the KL divergence with the approximated
policy distribution, with the objective of distin-
guishing between human and machine generated
stories.

Wang et al. (2018) demonstrated that AREL
outperforms a generative adversarial network
(GAN) model, a cross-entropy model, and other
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results
across both automated and human metrics. The
human metrics considered included both a Turing
test (in which annotators attempted to guess which
of two stories was written by a human) and pair-
wise comparisons measuring relevance, expres-
siveness, and concreteness.

4.2 GLocal Attention Cascading Networks
(GLACNet)

GLACNet (Kim et al., 2018) also uses an encoder-
decoder architecture, but it adds a hard attention
mechanism which stresses feeding both the local
image features and the overall context to the de-
coder as input. The image-specific features are
extracted using a 152-layer residual network (He
et al., 2016). Those features are fed sequentially
into a bidirectional LSTM, which then produces
the global context vectors. The global context and
local image features are combined to form glocal
vectors and passed through fully connected lay-
ers. The output is concatenated with word tokens
and fed to the decoder (LSTM) as input. Thus,
five glocal vectors for each image are fed into
the decoder one after another, creating a cascad-
ing mechanism by passing the hidden state of one
sentence generator as the initial hidden state of the
next sentence generator.

To validate that all components of the GLAC-
Net architecture contributed to the model’s per-
formance, Kim et al. (2018) conducted an abla-
tion study in which the cascading, global atten-

tion, local attention, and post-processing routines
were removed one at a time, comparing perplexity
and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) scores
between conditions as well as with a standalone
LSTM sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model
and the full GLACNet model. The full GLAC-
Net model exhibited the best performance, and
the other GLACNet-based models exhibited bet-
ter performance than the LSTM Seq2Seq model,
thereby verifying the utility of this approach.

4.3 Contextualize, Show and Tell

Contextualize, Show and Tell (Gonzalez-Rico and
Pineda, 2018) won the 2018 Visual Storytelling
Challenge. The model uses an encoder LSTM to
read in the image representations one by one for
every image in a sequence. The image represen-
tations are generated using Inception V3 (Szegedy
et al., 2016). Five decoders, again LSTMs, then
read in the image embedding as input. The first
hidden state of each decoder is initialized using
the last hidden state of the encoder to provide the
model with global context. Gonzalez-Rico and
Pineda (2018) obtained the final story by concate-
nating the outputs of the model’s five decoders.

As part of the Visual Storytelling Challenge, the
model was evaluated on public and hidden test sets
using both human evaluation and an automated
metric (METEOR). METEOR scores of 30.88 and
31 were obtained on the public and hidden test
sets, respectively.6 Human evaluation scores were
collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Crowd
workers evaluated six aspects of each story us-
ing a Likert scale. Each worker was asked to in-
dicate the degree to which: 1) the story was fo-
cused, 2) the story had good structure and coher-
ence, 3) the worker would share the story, 4) the
worker thought the story was written by a human,
5) the story was visually grounded, and 6) the
story was detailed. In summing the average scores
received for each criterion, Gonzalez-Rico and
Pineda’s (2018) model achieved a score of 18.498,
whereas human-generated stories achieved a score
of 23.596.

Github repository.7 However, we modified the
source code slightly such that we were able to ob-
tain the individual METEOR scores for each pre-
dicted story in the test set. This helped us in per-
forming an in-depth error analysis of the gener-
ated stories and determining how well the auto-
matic metrics were at scoring the stories. Training
the model took around 2 weeks on a 3.5 GHz Intel
Core i5 CPU with 16 GB RAM.8

The GLACNet code is also publicly available.9

We trained and evaluated the model using an
NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU instance on Google
Cloud Platform. The model took one week to fin-
ish training. The original source code only pro-
vided an average METEOR score across all gen-
erated stories after testing. Thus, we added code
to produce the METEOR score for each story. We
will make all adapted source code publicly avail-
able online to ensure easy replicability.

The source code for Contextualize, Show and
Tell is available online as well.10 The authors per-
sonally sent us the generated stories, so we did not
re-implement their model. We have directly in-
cluded their METEOR results in our evaluation.

5.2 Evaluation Metrics

Common metrics for evaluating visual story-
telling models include METEOR (Banerjee and

sources in the midst of our AREL evaluation. Training would
have undoubtedly been quicker using GPUs, as was done in
the original paper (Wang et al., 2018).

Lavie, 2005), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), and ROUGE-
L (Lin and Och, 2004). METEOR, the pri-
mary metric considered in the Visual Storytelling
Challenge, calculates the alignment between the
machine-generated hypotheses and the reference
stories based on the exact, stem, synonym, and
paraphrase matches between words and phrases.
While AREL was evaluated using METEOR as
well as the other metrics, GLACNet was evalu-
ated using only METEOR scores and measures
of perplexity. Contextualize, Show and Tell was
also evaluated using only METEOR. We gener-
ated scores for the remaining metrics as well for
GLACNet and Contextualize, Show and Tell to aid
our analysis.

5.3 Results

We observed slightly different results from those
originally reported for the models included in
our evaluation. We include both the originally-
reported results and results based directly on orig-
inal output files if available (Table 1) and our re-
sults from when we ran AREL and GLACNet (Ta-
ble 2) in Tables 1 and 2. When we ran AREL
and GLACNet, we collected scores for METEOR,
CIDEr, ROUGE-L, BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3,
and BLEU-4, and found that AREL outperformed
GLACNet in all cases (Table 2). We also found
that based on Wang et al.’s (2018) and Gonzalez-
Rico and Pineda’s (2018) reported results and the
additional metrics we computed for Contextualize,
Show and Tell, the former outperformed the latter.

6 Error Analysis

We defined a threshold METEOR score of 25,
with stories scoring below this threshold consid-
ered as serious errors. This threshold was cho-
sen following a manual assessment of the pre-
dicted stories, with METEOR < 25 representing a
medium at which there existed both a sizable num-
ber of errors, and a sample of generated stories that
were of noticeably low quality. Stories having a
METEOR score ≥50 were also analyzed for any
anomalies (e.g., bad stories with high scores).

Some metrics (CIDEr and BLEU-4) produced
scores of 0 for many stories in both models. Upon
manual analysis we found many of these stories to
be sensible. Other work has confirmed that BLEU-
3 and CIDEr scores do not correlate well with hu-
man evaluations (Wang et al., 2018).

We systematically analyzed each story in er-
ror and made notes indicating characteristics con-
tributing to the error (including those that rendered
the predicted stories to be completely meaning-
less or incoherent). In the process, we also iden-
tified mechanisms by which those errors may be
addressed in the future. We compiled the errors
into representative categories, which we define in
Section 6.1 and exemplify in Table 3. We discuss
these errors in fuller detail in Section 6.2. In Sec-
tion 6.2 we also discuss some general errors from
papers about other visual storytelling approaches
for which we were unable to obtain full working
implementations.

6.1 Error Categories

We define our representative error categories as
follows:

• Grammatical Errors: Incorrect use of
verbs and tenses and/or subject-verb dis-
agreements.

• Contradictions: Presence of inconsistent
ideas within the same story (e.g., two sub-
stories that are the opposite of each other).

• Repetitions: These errors were further sub-
divided into the following categories.

– Repetitions within Story: Recurrence
of the same sentence(s) within a story.

– Repetitions within Sentence: Recur-
rence of the same phrase(s) within a sub-
story.

– Repetitive Subject: The sub-stories
have the same subject and differ only in
the adjective used to describe it.

– Repetitive Sentence Structure:
Most sentences start with “the [noun]
was/were/is [adjective].” This leads
to monotonous and unoriginal stories.
We observed this error only in stories
predicted by GLACNet.

• Description in Isolation: Most sub-stories
start with “This is a picture of....” Sentences
of this nature sound more like single image
captions than contextual stories.

• Singular/Plural Disagreement: The same
story has one sentence with a singular noun
and another sentence with the same noun but
in plural form.

• Ghost Entities: Some sub-stories make use
of a pronoun that has no antecedent at all
(e.g., referring to a new person who was
not introduced formally in the preceding sub-
stories). This leads to confusion.

• Personification: The attribution of human-
like qualities to something non-human due to
lack of common sense knowledge.

• Absurdity: Nonsensical stories or sub-
stories.

• Incomplete Stories: Stories that have less
than 5 sentences.

• Point-of-View Inconsistency: The narrative
point of view randomly changes within the
story (e.g., first person to second person), cre-
ating confusion.

• Excessive Paraphrasing: Presence of sub-
stories that have similar meanings but are ex-
pressed using different words or phrases.

We provide examples of each of the above error
types in Table 3. In addition to analyzing errors
in stories with low predictions, we uncovered sev-
eral anomalies in stories with high predictions. We
provide examples of these in Table 4.

6.2 Discussion
The most common error types we observed
were repetitions and descriptions in isolation; we
present statistics indicating the frequencies of

these errors for AREL, GLACNet, and Contextu-
alize, Show and Tell in Table 5 (note that both oc-
curred with the highest frequency in AREL). The
rarest error category was that containing incom-
plete stories. This error appeared only in AREL
stories, and only in three of the 1010 generated
stories (0.003%).

The prevalence of repetitions in AREL is likely
a side-effect of the model’s architecture—it gener-
ates the sub-stories for the whole album in parallel,
rather than keeping track of what was generated in
the previous sub-story. We found that this struc-
ture also led to some stories having contradictory
sentences. In contrast, GLACNet stories exhibited

few repetitions because of the post-processing step
employed after decoding. In this step, words for
a sentence are sampled from a word probability
distribution one hundred times and the most fre-
quent word is selected. The words which occur in
the generated sentences are also counted and the
selection probabilities of words are decreased as
their frequency increases.

It is somewhat surprising that the stories gen-
erated using Contextualize, Show and Tell also
exhibited such a high frequency of repetitions,
in spite of the fact that the model generated
sub-stories sequentially. This demonstrates that

the model’s previously generated sub-stories is
needed. The output of each of the five decoders
in Contextualize, Show and Tell should be fed into
the next decoder to keep track of previously gen-
erated sub-stories.

We observed that there were very few gram-
matical errors in the GLACNet stories, as the
probabilities associated with function words (e.g.,
prepositions and pronouns) remained unchanged
even if their rate of occurrence was high. In
contrast, stories generated by AREL (which in-
cludes no such grammar-checking mechanism) in-
cluded a considerable number of grammatical er-
rors. GLACNet’s post-processing step still could
be improved upon—we were somewhat surprised
to find that some of its stories used both singular
and plural forms of the same noun within a story.
We assume the error occurred due to the fact that
the model decreases the probability of frequently
occurring words. Thus, if the singular noun oc-
curred in the previous sub-story, its plural form
gets included in the next sub-story.

partially be a consequence of the presence of repe-
titions in some VIST training stories. In our anal-
ysis of the crowdsourced dataset we found that hu-
man typing/grammar errors were a relatively com-
mon occurrence, resulting in imperfect training
data. Although the stories generated by GLAC-
Net did not often exhibit repetitions due to the rea-
sons mentioned in the paragraph above, there was
a trade-off in terms of originality of the generated
stories. We found that most were monotonous, us-
ing similar sentence structures for every story.

Descriptions in isolation, the single most preva-
lent error type we identified in AREL and Con-
textualize, Show and Tell stories, read more like
image captions (describing the image’s contents)
than components of a sequential story. We are per-
plexed as to why these errors were so common,
since to the best of our understanding the mod-
els did not include any DII instances in their train-
ing sets. It may be the case that caption-like sub-
stories are learned to be “safer” choices by these
models, and thus generated more often than riskier
contextual sub-stories.

Sentences that are lexically different but se-
mantically similar cause redundancies in the story
and are a common occurrence in both GLACNet
and AREL. Since images in a sequential album
are often visually similar to one another, it may
be the case that both models predict that two (or
more) images in a sequence refer to the same con-
tent. In attempting to vary the resulting sub-stories
nonetheless, they succeed only at generating para-
phrases of one another.

7 Recommendations

As evidenced by our error analysis, there is sub-
stantial scope for improvement in visual story-
telling. Based on our observations, we make the
following recommendations. First, automatically
preprocessing the DII and SIS training files

remains an unexplored but potentially highly
useful preliminary step in the story genera-
tion process. Doing so could aid future systems
in avoiding grammatical mistakes, particularly if
coupled with a post-processing mechanism similar
to what is currently employed by GLACNet. Sec-
ond, in terms of the post-processing mechanism it-
self, incorporating temporal sequencing meth-
ods will yield more well-organized and coher-
ent stories. This could be done by sorting a (pre-
sumably jumbled) set of sub-stories after they have
been generated, as was done by Agrawal et al.
(2016).

Third, it is common for current models to gen-
erate all sub-stories in parallel. This leads to rep-
etitions and redundancies in the generated sto-
ries. Modifying the architecture in such a way
that the sub-stories are generated sequentially
and the word tokens of the previously gener-
ated sub-stories are passed back to the model
may lead to numerous benefits. For instance,
this feedback could be used to identify past sub-
story topics, as well as to ensure that the singular-
ity/plurality of subjects remains the same across
the entire story. Incorporating a memory mecha-
nism could also lessen the frequency of point-of-
view inconsistencies, excessive paraphrasing, and
contradictions. The architecture of the decoder
used by Venugopalan et al. (2015) can also be
adopted for providing feedback at the word level
along with the sub-story level feedback. This will
help in keeping track of the previously generated
words in the story and prevent in-sentence repeti-
tions.

Fourth, traditional image captions (DIIs) can
be (carefully) leveraged to support the genera-
tion of high-quality stories, for instance by facil-
itating named entity recognition and thereby de-
creasing the frequency of ghost entities. Another
way to avoid ghost entities is to (fifth) incorpo-
rate a bottom-up and top-down visual atten-
tion mechanism, such as that used in prior im-
age captioning work (Anderson et al., 2018), to
learn image-specific features and facilitate visual
grounding. Few-shot learning methods to jointly
encode the images and text (Dong et al., 2018)
could also be used in this regard.

Sixth, although Jain et al.’s (2017) work consid-
ered only textual features, a machine translation
model could be used to produce more creative
stories while avoiding repetitive sentence struc-

tures and absurdities to some degree. Matusov
et al. (2017) use a neural machine translation
model which contains a visual encoder and a tex-
tual encoder, thus giving attention independently
to both image features and source sentences. This
technique is a more viable option. Finally, the
anomalies we uncovered in our error analysis val-
idate the position first put forward by Wang et al.
(2018), that automatic metrics leave much to be
desired in terms of judging visual storytelling ap-
proaches. We recommend that a standardized hu-
man evaluation metric be included in the assess-
ment of these approaches in the future.

8 Conclusion

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive error
analysis of recent visual storytelling approaches.
We note current shortcomings in this area, and
make recommendations for addressing these limi-
tations in future work. We find that the most com-
mon errors are repetitions, the presence of tradi-
tional image descriptions, and a lack of creativ-
ity in the machine-generated stories. Preprocess-
ing the training text, developing a combined vi-
sual and text co-attention mechanism, and sequen-
tially generating sub-stories and providing them
as feedback to the model could all help to ame-
liorate these issues. Specifically, including these
elements could help in the generation of more
context-aware sequential sub-stories, and tempo-
rally sequencing the sub-stories will produce more
creative, coherent, relevant, and most importantly,
humanlike stories. We plan to experiment with the
techniques mentioned above in our future work.
