Abstract 

India is a country with diverse culture, lan-
guage and varied heritage. Due to this, it is 
very rich in languages and their dialects. Be-
ing a multilingual society, a dictionary in 
multiple languages becomes its need and one 
of the major resources to support a language. 
There are dictionaries for many Indian lan-
guages, but very few are available in multiple 
languages. WordNet is one of the most prom-
inent lexical resources in the field of Natural 
Language Processing. IndoWordNet is an in-
tegrated multilingual WordNet for Indian lan-
guages. These WordNet resources are used by 
researchers to experiment and resolve the is-
sues in multilinguality through computation. 
However, there are few cases where WordNet 
is used by the non-researchers or general pub-
lic. This paper focuses on providing an online 
interface – IndoWordNet Dictionary to non-
researchers as well as researchers. It is devel-
oped to render multilingual WordNet infor-
mation of 19 Indian languages in a 
dictionary format. The WordNet information 
is rendered in multiple views such as: sense 

based, thesaurus based, word usage based and 
language based. English WordNet infor-
mation is also rendered using this interface. 
The IndoWordNet dictionary will help users 
to know meanings of a word in multiple Indi-
an languages. 

1 Introduction 

Language is a constituent element of civilization. 
In a country like India, diversity is its primary as-
pect. This leads to varied languages and their dia-
lects. There are numerous languages in India which 
belong to different language families. These lan-
guage families are Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Sino-
Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic. The 
major ones are the Indo-Aryan, spoken by the 
northern to western part of India and Dravidian, 
spoken by southern part of India. The Eighth 
Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 lan-
guages, which have been referred to 
as scheduled languages and given recognition, sta-
tus and official encouragement.   
    A Dictionary can be called as a resource dealing 
with the individual words of a language along with 

71



 

its orthography, pronunciation, usage, synonyms, 
derivation, history, etymology, etc. arranged in an 
order for convenience of referencing the words. 
Various criterions used for classifying this resource 
are - density of entries, number of languages in-
volved, nature of entries, degree of concentration 
on strictly lexical data, axis of time, arrangement 
of entries, purpose, prospective user, etc. Some of 
the common types of dictionaries are1-  
• Encyclopedia: Single or multi-volume publi-

cation that contains accumulated and authorita-
tive knowledge on a subject arranged 
alphabetically. E.g. Britannica encyclopedia. 

• Thesaurus: Thesaurus is a dictionary that lists 
words in groups of synonyms and related con-
cepts. 

• Etymological Dictionary: An etymological 
dictionary discusses the etymology/origin of 
the words listed. It is the product of research in 
historical linguistics. 

• Dialect Dictionary:  These dictionaries deal 
with the words of a particular geographical re-
gion or social group which are non standard. 

• Specialized Dictionary: These dictionaries 
covers relatively restricted set of phenomena.  

• Bilingual or Multilingual Dictionary: These 
are linguistic dictionaries in two or more lan-
guages. 

• Reverse Dictionary: These dictionaries are 
based on the concept/idea/definition to words. 

• Learner’s Dictionary: These dictionaries are 
meant for foreign students/tourists to learn the 
usage of the word in language. 

• Phonetic Dictionary: These dictionaries help 
in searching the words by the way they sound. 

• Visual Dictionary: These dictionaries use pic-
tures to illustrate the meaning of words.   
 

    WordNet is a lexical resource composed of 
synsets and semantic relations. Synsets are sets of 
synonyms. They are linked by semantic relations 
like hypernymy, meronymy, etc. and lexical rela-
tions like antonymy, gradation, etc. (Miller et al., 
1990; Fellbaum, 1998). IndoWordNet2 is a linked 
structure of WordNets of 19 different Indian lan-
guages from Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-
Tibetan families (Bhattacharyya, 2010). Other 
popular multilingual WordNets are: EuroWordNet, 
                                                           
1 http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/lexico/link5.htm 
2  http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet/ 

which is a linked WordNet for European languages 
(Vossen, 1999) and BalkaNet, which is a linked 
WordNet for Balkan Languages (Christodoulakis, 
2002). The most innovative aspect of WordNets is 
that lexical information is organized in terms of 
meaning; i.e., a synset contains words of the same 
part-of-speech which have approximately the same 
meaning. Thus, it is synonymy that functions as the 
essential principle in the construction of WordNets 
(Vincze et al., 2008). This feature of WordNet is 
most important for the dictionary construction.  

IndoWordNet is used in the field of Natural 
Language Processing tasks like Machine Transla-
tion, Information Retrieval, Information Extrac-
tion, etc. But, not much has been explored to use 
this resource beyond research labs. In this paper, 
we present an interface – IndoWordNet Dictionary 
(IWN Dictionary) in the form of multilingual 
online dictionary which uses IndoWordNet as a 
resource. The primary focus of this interface is to 
provide synset information in a systematic and 
classified manner which is rendered in multiple 
views. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 justifies the need of IndoWordNet Dic-
tionary. Section 3 details the IndoWordNet Dic-
tionary, its components, followed by its design and 
layout. Section 4 gives the features of the diction-
ary.  Section 5 lists its limitations. Finally, the con-
clusion, scope and enhancements to the IWN 
Dictionary are presented. 

2 Need for IndoWordNet Dictionary 

Our work on developing IWN Dictionary interface 
is motivated from various available online re-
sources. To name some: langtolang.com3 which 
includes cross-lingual references across 47 non-
Indian languages, wordreference.com4 which 
includes 17 non-Indian languages, and others being 
logosdictionary.org5 and xobodo.org6 
which has multiple languages including some Indi-
an languages. But, all these resources render not 
more than two languages at a given instance.  
    Further survey is done, which reveals that 
Mohanty et al. (2008) had developed a tool for 
multilingual dictionary development process to

create and link the synset based lexical resource for 
machine translation purpose. The aim was to sim-
plify the process of synset creation and to link it 
with different Indian language WordNets. The tool 
was mainly used by lexicographers involved in the 
process of creating various Indian language 
WordNets. Also, Sinha et al. (2006) who have de-
signed a browsable bilingual interface for viewing 
WordNet information in two languages, Hindi and 
Marathi. The input to this browser is a search word 
in any of the two languages and the output is the 
search result for both the languages. The primary 
usage of this interface is to help users get the se-
mantic information of the search string in both 
Hindi and Marathi.  However, Sarma et al. (2012) 
built a multilingual dictionary considering three 
languages, viz., Assamese, Bodo and Hindi. The 
dictionary interface allows searching between Hin-
di-Assamese and Hindi-Bodo language pairs at a 
time.  
    All these interfaces mentioned above could dis-
play the meanings in at most two languages with 
the lexical information available in the WordNet at 
a time. Hence, we have developed a web based 
interface to render multilingual WordNet infor-
mation in a dictionary format. This interface is de-
veloped keeping in mind the general public, apart 
from researchers.   

Following points justify the need of online 
multilingual dictionary in today’s time: 
• To know or understand other languages. 
• To find the meaning of a word in multiple 

languages on a single platform. 
• To understand other languages with the 

help of a pivot language (referring one of 
the known languages). 

• To understand synonymous words in input 
language as well as in another languages.  

• To understand additional information like 
part-of-speech, gender, etc. in input as well 
as other different languages. 

• To understand the semantic variations in 
different languages.  

• To fulfil the social need of bridging the 
communication gap.  

• To understand the script of various langua- 
ges. 

• To understand a local language when re-
located to that area.  

• To improve on one’s own language voca-
bulary.  

• To address social and educational needs. 

3 IndoWordNet Multilingual Dictionary 

3.1 What is IndoWordNet Dictionary? 

IndoWordNet Dictionary7 or IWN Dictionary is an 
online interface to render multilingual IndoWord-
Net information in the dictionary format. It allows 
user to view the results in multiple formats as per 
the need. Also, user can view the result in multiple 
languages simultaneously. The look and feel of the 
IWN Dictionary is kept same as a traditional dic-
tionary keeping in mind the user adaptability. So 
far, it renders WordNet information of 19 Indian 
languages. These languages are: Assamese, Bodo, 
Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, 
Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, 
Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and 
Urdu. The WordNet information is also rendered in 
English. The English WordNet information is 
taken from Princeton University8 website. All 
these WordNets are imported into IndoWordNet 
database structure (Prabhu, et al., 2012) using DB 
Import tool developed under the Indradhanush 
WordNet Project9. The work is still going on to 
include other non-Indian languages and storing 
them in the World WordNet Database Structure 
(WWDS) proposed by Redkar et al. (2015). 

3.2 Modules of IWN Dictionary 

The IWN Dictionary has two major modules: IWN 
Dictionary Search Module and IWN Dictionary 
Display Module. Figure 1 shows the block diagram 
of the IWN Dictionary.  

3.2.1 IWN Dictionary Search Module 

The main function of the IWN Dictionary Search 
module is to process the input word in the form 
which can be used to search the database and re-
trieve relevant information. Its function is divided 
into three sub modules, which involves analyzing a

word, database lookup and multilingual data ex-
traction.  
    Each of these sub modules are described in de-
tail below –  
 

 

Figure 1. Block diagram of IWN Dictionary. 

Word Analyzer 

Word Analyzer analyses and processes the input 
word. It checks whether it is in its root form. If it is 
in root form then it is directly passed on to the 
IWN Database Lookup module, else it will be pro-
cessed to find the closest possible word in the da-
tabase. The concept of human mediated lemma-
tizer is adopted from the work of Bhattacharyya et 
al., (2014) to find the closest possible words of an 
input word. Here, the trie data structure is created 
out of the vocabulary in the input language and this 
structure is navigated to find the match between 
the input word and an entry in trie. Accordingly, 
the closest possible word(s) is populated and given 
for the next module for the database lookup.  
 

IWN Database Lookup 

In IWN Database Lookup module, the word re-
ceived from Word Analyzer is searched in the 
IWN database and the corresponding synset ids of 
all the senses of a word are sent to the Multilingual 
Extractor engine for further processing. If the word 
is not found in the database then the control is sent 
back to the Word Analyzer module to look for oth-
er similar or closest words.  

Multilingual Extractor 

The basic task of Multilingual Extractor module is 
to take the input synset ids and extract synset in-
formation of all the languages available in the IWN 
database. This extracted synset information, i.e., 
the multilingual senses of an input word are then 
sent to the IWN Dictionary Display module for 
rendering information in the dictionary format.  

3.2.2 IWN Dictionary Display Module 

The IWN Dictionary Display module takes the ex-
tracted multilingual senses of a given word and 
renders it in the traditional dictionary format. Here, 
the multilingual IndoWordNet data can be ren-
dered using different views. This is an important 
module of an IWN Dictionary which renders and 
ranks information based on the user response and 
statistics. Here, IWN Click-Based-Rendering Algo-
rithm is used to rank most frequently used senses 
using this interface. The basic task of this algo-
rithm is to record and maintain the number of user 
clicks on a sense being viewed and accordingly 
rank the sense in the output interface. Similarly, 
this algorithm is applied to all the other views 
available for this IWN Dictionary. 

The different views in IWN Dictionary are:  
• Sense Based view: All the meanings of an 

input word are displayed with respect to the 
senses available in the IWN database. Here, 
each sense is shown in a different card, 
where user can click or unclick to get the 
corresponding senses in other languages.  
 

• Thesaurus Based view: In thesaurus based 
view, synonymous words in each language 
are rendered. Here, user can click on any of 
the words in the list to go to see other sens-
es of that word.  
 

74



 

• Word Usage Based view: In word usage 
based view, usage of an input word with re-
spect to the languages is rendered. Here, the 
examples of a synset from IWN database 
are rendered.  
 

• Language Based view: In language based 
view, meaning of a word is rendered with 
respect to the language. Here, for each 
sense of a word, the meaning in all the lan-
guages is rendered in a horizontal tabbed 
format or a card format. 

 
    Apart from these views, transliteration infor-
mation is displayed for each of these views. The 
transliteration information is seen once a user 
hovers on any of the content in the dictionary. 
For now, we have used transliteration into a 
roman script using the Indic NLP Library10 de-
veloped by Kunchukuttan et al. (2015). Howev-
er, we are in the process to implement 
transliteration in all the Indian languages, so 
that anyone can read other language in their 
chosen transliteration language. 

3.3 Design and Layout of IWN Dictionary 

The IWN Dictionary is designed keeping in mind, 
its simplicity and usability; more importantly, the 
user friendliness of the system. The frontend is 
designed and developed with PHP, CSS, JavaS-
cript, etc. and at the backend, MySQL database is 
used. The IWN Dictionary data is retrieved from 
IndoWordNet database using IndoWordNet APIs 
(Prabhugaonkar et al., 2012).  
    The basic input parameters of this dictionary 
are; input language, search string, phonetic trans-
literation, keyboard and different views selector. 
Figure 2, figure 3, figure 4 and figure 5 shows 
sample screen shots of the IWN Multilingual Dic-
tionary Interface with different views. In all these 
views, initial information is always shown in the 
source language. This initial information is ren-
dered on the horizontal tab in the card format. User 
can click on plus or minus button to expand or col-
lapse to see the details in each card respectively. 
Also, user can check the checkbox next to each 
Language in sense based view, thesaurus based

view and word usage based view to see information 
in the checked language.  
 

 

Figure 2. IndoWordNet Multilingual Dictionary showing 
multiple languages with sense based view. 

 

Figure 3. IndoWordNet Multilingual Dictionary showing 
multiple languages with thesaurus based view. 

    In figure 3, we can see that the source language 
is Hindi and the target languages are Bengali, 
Kannada, Malayalam, Nepali and Punjabi. Here, 
thesaurus based view is enabled; Hence, the IWN 
Dictionary renders synonymous words in the form 
of thesaurus. On clicking hyperlink more, user can 
see the meaning of these words. Also, user can 
click on any of the words in the list which displays 
the multilingual senses of that particular word.  
 
 

75



 

    In figure 4, we can see that the source language 
is Hindi and the target languages are English, Gu-
jarati, Hindi, Kannada, Nepali and Odia. Here, 
word usage based view is enabled; hence, the IWN 
Dictionary renders usage of a word by showing the 
example sentences in a synset from IWN database.  
 

 

Figure 4. IndoWordNet Multilingual Dictionary showing 
multiple languages with word usage based view. 

 

Figure 5. IndoWordNet Multilingual Dictionary showing 
multiple languages with language based view. 

        In figure 5, we can see that the source lan-
guage is Hindi and in the target languages initially, 
the information is rendered in Hindi, However, the 
user can click on any of the horizontal bars to see 
all senses in each language. Here, language based 
view is enabled. 
 

    The procedure to use this IWN multilingual dic-
tionary is as follows: 

- User selects an input language. 
- User types-in a word. To input a word, he 

can enable phonetic transliteration or use 
onscreen keyboard. 

- User selects the Dictionary View. By de-
fault, sense based view is enabled and in-
formation is rendered sense wise. 

- User clicks on the button GO.  
- The meanings of an input word are dis-

played in horizontal tabbed format.  
- User can toggle between different views by 

clicking on sense based, thesaurus based, 
language based, word usage based radio 
buttons.  

- User can click on more to get additional in-
formation under each of these views.  

- The transliterated information is provided 
under each of these views. User has to 
click on checkbox ‘view transliteration’ 
for this purpose; this is available under the 
hyper link more. However, user sees trans-
literation of each language on mouse hover 
in the roman script.  

4 Features of IWN Dictionary  

The salient features of IndoWordNet Dictionary 
are as follows: 
• Renders information in multiple languages at a 

time. 
• Different views to display the information: 

sense based, thesaurus based, word usage 
based, language based. 

• Transliteration feature available which can 
help in effective reading.  

• Can assist language translation task where 
multilinguality is primary concern. 

• Can be referred for educational and social 
needs. 

• Automatic word suggestion is assisted. 
• Similar / closest word suggestion is assisted. 
• Usage analysis and statistics available. 
• Provides statistics such as most frequently 

searched word with respect to the selected 
language, input language searched, etc.  
 
 

76



 

5 Limitations of IWN Dictionary  

• It is a concept based dictionary, i.e., for all the 
synonymous words, it will show only one 
gloss or a concept definition. 

• Based entirely on WordNet as a backend 
resource, which is an ongoing development 
resource so issues/errors in WordNet data will 
also be propagated. 

• Issues of WordNet can be its limitations like, 
word spellings, word senses, word relations, 
etc., as found in corpus used for creating 
WordNet. 

• Since the development of WordNet in all 
mentioned languages is not at the same pace, at 
times we may not get the meaning in a 
language if it does not exist in the database. 

• The availability of words and their meanings 
depend upon how much the WordNet data is 
available. 

• Features such as pronunciation, sound, 
pictures, domain, origin of a word, etc. are not 
incorporated due to unavailability of the same 
in the IndoWordNet.  

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, we have presented an online interface 
viz. IWN Dictionary. The IWN Dictionary renders 
IndoWordNet information in a systematic and clas-
sified manner, providing the look and feel of a tra-
ditional dictionary. There are various views; such 
as sense based, thesaurus based, word usage 
based, language based to view the IndoWordNet 
information. Transliteration feature is also provid-
ed in this interface for user readability. Rendering 
is done based on the user response and usage.  

7 Future Scope and Enhancements  

In future, we plan to expand this interface by in-
cluding morph analyzer to process inflected input 
word. The ontological details along with semantic 
and lexical relations can be incorporated in the dic-
tionary interface.  Further, there can be a feature to 
link IndoWordNet dictionary to other available 
dictionaries along with the foreign language 
WordNets using WWDS. The features like picture, 
pronunciation, domain, source of a word, glossary, 
etc. can be implemented in the future versions. The 

transliteration feature to effectively read in one’s 
native language can be implemented in this inter-
face.
