Abstract

This paper describes the enrichment of
WebNLG corpus (Gardent et al., 2017a,b),
with the aim to further extend its useful-
ness as a resource for evaluating common
NLG tasks, including Discourse Ordering,
Lexicalization and Referring Expression
Generation. We also produce a silver-
standard German translation of the cor-
pus to enable the exploitation of NLG ap-
proaches to other languages than English.
The enriched corpus is publicly available1.

1 Introduction

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the pro-
cess of automatically converting non-linguistic
data into a linguistic output format (Reiter and
Dale, 2000; Gatt and Krahmer, 2018). Re-
cently, the field has seen an increase in the
number of available focused data resources as
E2E (Novikova et al., 2017), ROTOWIRE (Wise-
man et al., 2017) and WebNLG (Gardent et al.,
2017a,b) corpora.

Although theses recent releases are highly valu-
able resources for the NLG community in general,
all of them were designed to work with end-to-
end NLG models. Hence, they consist of a col-
lection of parallel raw representations and their
corresponding textual realizations. No interme-
diate representations are available so researchers
can straight-forwardly use them to develop or eval-
uate popular tasks in NLG pipelines (Reiter and
Dale, 2000), such as Discourse Ordering, Lexical-
ization, Aggregation, Referring Expression Gen-
eration, among others. Moreover, these new cor-
pora, like many other resources in Computational
Linguistics more in general, are only available

in English, limiting the development of NLG-
applications to other languages, which is cur-
rently an emerging theme in NLG research com-
munity – see, for instance, the increased availabil-
ity of SimpleNLG tools to languages other than
English (Mazzei et al., 2016; Bollmann, 2011;
Vaudry and Lapalme, 2013; Ramos-Soto et al.,
2017) and the recent Multilingual Surface Real-
ization task (Mille et al., 2018).

This paper describes how we addressed the
aforementioned issues by enriching the WebNLG
corpus with intermediate representations and ex-
ploiting the possibilities of automatically translat-
ing the corpus to a second language (German).
To this end, we first manually replaced all refer-
ring expressions in the WebNLG texts with gen-
eral tags in a process called Delexicalization. The
original texts and the delexicalized templates were
then translated to the German language using an
existing state-of-art English-German Neural Ma-
chine Translation (NMT) system (Sennrich et al.,
2017), providing a silver-standard version of the
corpus in another language. Finally, by automati-
cally processing the original texts and the delexi-
calized templates for both English and (translated)
German versions of the corpus, we obtained a col-
lection of gold-standard referring expressions and
discourse orderings. In sum, the main contribu-
tions of this study (all publicly available) are:

• A silver-standard version of the WebNLG
corpus in German.

• A collection of 16,661 delexicalized tem-
plates in English and 16,292 in (silver-
standard) German.

• A collection of 86,345 referring expressions
to 1,771 Wikipedia entities and constants in
English and (silver-standard) German.

• Discourse ordering information of 20,370 in-
stances of the WebNLG corpus.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
briefly describes the WebNLG corpus, Section
3 depicts our delexicalization procedure in de-
tail (briefly introduced in Castro Ferreira et al.
2018), Section 4 explains the process of translat-
ing the corpus texts to German, Section 5 intro-
duces the intermediate representations automati-
cally extracted from the corpus in its original and
delexicalized forms, and, finally, Section 6 dis-
cusses the contributions and prospects of future
work.

2 WebNLG corpus

The WebNLG corpus (Gardent et al., 2017a) is
a parallel dataset initially released for the epony-
mous NLG challenge, where participants had to
automatically convert non-linguistic data from the
Semantic Web into a textual format (Gardent et al.,
2017b). The source side of the corpus are sets of
Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples,
in which, each one of them is formed by a Sub-
ject, Predicate and Object. The Subject and Object
are constants or Wikipedia entities, whereas predi-
cates represent a binary relation between these two
elements in the triple. The target side contains En-
glish texts, obtained by crowdsourcing, which de-
scribe the source triples.

The corpus consists of 25,298 texts describing
9,674 sets of up to 7 RDF triples (an average of
2.62 texts per set) in 15 domains: Astronaut, Uni-
versity, Monument, Building, Comics Character,
Food, Airport, Sports Team, Written Work, City,
Athlete, Artist, Means of Transportation, Celestial
Body and Politician (last 5 were available only in
the test set). Figure 1 shows an example of a set of
5 RDF triples and its corresponding English text.

3 Delexicalization

To account for data sparsity and unseen entities,
many “end-to-end” NLG models work by first
generating a delexicalized template, where refer-
ences are represented by general tags (Konstas
et al., 2017; Castro Ferreira et al., 2017). The re-
ferring expressions are only surface realized once
the template is generated. Motivated by these
studies, we manually delexicalized the training
and development parts of the WebNLG corpus,
generating gold-standard templates. The test part

of the corpus was not included in this study, since
only its source RDF triples were publicly available
at the time of writing.

We started the delexicalization process by auto-
matically mapping each entity in the source rep-
resentation to a general tag. All entities that ap-
pear on the left and right side of the triples were
mapped to AGENTs and PATIENTs, respectively.
Entities which appear on both sides in the re-
lations of a set were represented as BRIDGEs.
To distinguish different AGENTs, PATIENTs and
BRIDGEs in a set, an ID was assigned to each en-
tity of each kind (PATIENT-1, PATIENT-2, etc.).

Once all entities were mapped to different gen-
eral tags in the text, the first two authors of this
study manually replaced the referring expressions
in the original target texts by their respective tags.
Each annotator delexicalized half of the texts, and
the few difficult cases were resolved in discussions
with the co-authors. Figure 2 shows the entity
mapping and the delexicalized template for the ex-
ample in Figure 1.

In total, we delexicalized 20,370 different texts
which describe 7,812 distinct sets of RDF triples,
resulting in 16,661 distinct templates in English.
Together with the original texts, we translated the
delexicalized templates to German, and extracted
a collection of referring expressions and discourse
ordering information of the corpus as explained in
the following sections.

4 Translation

We translated the original texts and the delexical-
ized templates by relying on the University of Ed-
inburgh’s Neural MT System for WMT17 (Sen-
nrich et al., 2017; Bojar et al., 2017a). Not only
are the training models publicly available2, but this
system is state-of-the-art in translating English-
to-German at the time of writing3, which guaran-
tees we obtain arguably the best silver-standard re-
source currently feasible.

The University of Edinburgh system was mod-
eled in a deep encoder attention-decoder archi-
tecture. Its translation model was trained on
back-translated monolingual data (Sennrich et al.,
2016a) in order to augment the training data. To
have an open vocabulary, the rare words, which
pose a well-known problem in NMT systems,

were segmented into sub-word units using Byte
Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016b).

To translate a sentence, the University of Ed-
inburgh submission trained 4 left-to-right and 4
right-to-left models. The left-to-right models were
ensembled to produce the 50 most likely trans-
lation hypotheses while the right-to-left models
were then used to re-rank the outcomes from the
left models. The process resulted in 20,370 texts
and 16,292 delexicalized templates in German.

5 Automatic extraction process

In both English and (translated) German versions
of the corpus, we used the original texts and the
delexicalized templates to automatically extract a
collection of referring expressions and discourse
ordering information.

5.1 Referring expression collection

For both English and (translated) German ver-
sions, we automatically extracted a collection
of referring expressions by tokenizing the orig-
inal texts and delexicalized templates, and then
finding the non-overlapping items. For in-
stance, by processing the text in Figure 1 and
its delexicalized template in Figure 2, we ex-
tracted referring expressions, for instance, “The
Appleton International Airport” to 〈 AGENT-

1, Appleton International Airport 〉, “Greenville,
Wisconsin” and “Greenville” to 〈 BRIDGE-1,
Greenville, Wisconsin 〉, “the town of Menasha”
to 〈 PATIENT-3, Menasha (town), Wisconsin 〉. In
total, we obtained 86,345 referring expressions to
1,771 Wikipedia entities and constants, in which
72.6% (62,689) are proper names, 4.9% (4,230)
pronouns, 22.13% (19,108) descriptions and 0.4%
(318) demonstrative referring expressions.

5.2 Discourse Ordering

As depicted in Figure 1, each instance of the orig-
inal WebNLG corpus consists of a set of triples
and its respective text. However, in many cases,
the order in which the triples are introduced in the
set is not the same in which they are realized in
the text. For instance, in Figure 1, the triple 〈 Ap-
pleton International Airport, cityServed, Apple-
ton, Wisconsin 〉 is the third argument expressed
on the text, while it is represented as the 5th (last)
one in the input set of triples. This is just a singular
example of others that even exist in this instance.
In order to solve the problem, we noticed that we
could extract the order of the arguments in the text
by looking into the order of the general tags in the
delexicalized template, as Algorithm 1 shows.

The algorithm iterates over the words in a tem-
plate (lines 4-16). If a word is a general tag (line

2: orderedset← ∅

5: if ISTAG(word) then
6: for all prevTag ∈ prevTags do
7: triples← tripleset[prevTag, word]
8: if |triples| > 0 then
9: triple← triples[0]

13: end for
14: prevTags← prevTags ∪ word

5), the algorithm looks for a remaining instance
on the triple set which relates the visited tag with
a previous visited one (line 7). If a triple is found
(line 8), this one is added on the ordering list (line
10) and removed from the input set (line 11).

6 Discussion

This study introduced an enriched version of the
WebNLG corpus, easily usable on the evaluation
of popular tasks of pipeline NLG models as Dis-
course Ordering, Lexicalization, Aggregation and
Referring Expression Generation. Moreover, a
silver-standard version of the corpus in German is
provided, hopefully making it more useful for the
exploration of NLG in other languages or for the
study of Multilingual Surface Realization (Mille
et al., 2018). We discuss below the main aspects
of our results.

Delexicalization This process was applied to
obtain 16,661 English templates and, after the
translation process, 16,292 German templates.
These representations can be used in the develop-
ment of template-based NLG systems or Lexical-
ization models.

Automatic extraction process Using original
texts and templates, we extracted important inter-
mediate resources from the corpus, as a collection
of referring expressions and discourse ordering in-
formation for English and (silver-standard) Ger-
man. The former resource can be used to eval-
uate referring expression or wikification models,
whereas the second may be a good resource for
discourse ordering, content planning, and also for
the aggregation task when combined with sentence

tokenization information.

Translation While analyzing the translations
from English to German, we could perceive that
the NMT system did not face any big problem
for translating the delexicalized templates. The
main challenge was faced with transliterations and
coreferences in the texts. The genitive case is
an example, as in “Elliot See ’s Besatzung war
ein Testpilot.”, where the apostrophe (’s) is placed
wrongly. The same happens to the sentence “Bill
Oddie Tochter ist Kate Hardie”, where the name
“Oddie” should have had the “s” in the end of this
German sentence. In terms of transliterations, the
preposition “von” played a key role in the chal-
lenge, as in the case of the reference “University
of Texas”, wrongly transliterated to “Universität
von Texas” instead of the correct form “Univer-
sität Texas”. These problems are well-known in
WMT English-German tasks and still take a place
even using the best NMT model (Koehn, 2009;
Bojar et al., 2017b).

Conclusion This study aimed to enrich the
WebNLG corpus, facilitating its use in popu-
lar tasks of pipeline NLG models as well as in
other languages than English. In future work,
we envision translating the corpus for other mor-
phologically rich languages, as Brazilian Por-
tuguese (Moussallem et al., 2018). Furthermore,
we intend to experiment and come up with good
automatic methods to improve the aforementioned
challenges and generate useful silver-standard re-
sources for NLG.
