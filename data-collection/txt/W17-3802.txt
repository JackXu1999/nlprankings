Abstract 

In this paper we present Elsa, the first lexicon 

for Spanish with morphological, syntactic and 

semantic information automatically generated 

from a well-known pictogram resource and es-

pecially tailored for Augmentative and Alter-

native Communication (AAC). This lexicon, fo-

cusing on that specific icon set widely used 

within AAC applications, is motivated by the 

need to improve Natural Language Generation 

(NLG) systems to aid people who have been di-

agnosed to suffer from communication disor-

ders. In addition, we design an automatic lexi-

con extension procedure by means of a training 

process to complete the linguistic data. For this 

we used a dataset composed of novels and tales 

in Spanish, with pictogram representations, 

since the lexicon is meant for AAC applications 

for children with disabilities. Moreover, we 

provide the algorithms used to build our lexi-

con and a use case of Elsa within an NLG sys-

tem to observe the usability of our proposal. 

1 Introduction 

According to the State Database of Persons with 

Disabilities 2014 report1, 14,456 Spanish people 

had expression problems, 72,088 had mixed disabil-

ities and 45,818 had communication disorders 

(Doval, 2013). Relying on unofficial sources2, in 

Spain and Mexico over 1% of children are autistic 

(over 800,000 people) requiring language aids.

Many of these have evolved from graphical systems 

and rely on speech synthesis and speech recognition 

(Heimann Mühlenbock & Lundälv, 2011). They are 

known as Augmentative and Alternative Communi-

cation or AAC.  

Our goal is to automatically create a Spanish vo-

cabulary to be used in a Natural Language Genera-

tion (NLG) system applied to an AAC communicator, 

by merging different linguistic resources. Picto-

grams (used as input) act as a bridge between the 

lexicon and the NLG system, and help target users 

express themselves easily and quickly. Some previ-

ous AAC tools such as Talk Together or LetMe Talk3 

include small vocabulary packages with hand-coded 

knowledge, but none of them considers morpholog-

ical, syntactic and semantic information when gen-

erating messages in Spanish. There is some work on 

language resource merging in the literature on man-

ual and automatic management (Hughes, Souter, & 

Atwell, 1995; Crouch & King, 2005; Molinero, 

Sagot & Nicolas, 2009) but Spanish resources con-

sidering morphological, syntactic and semantic data 

has not been considered so far. Moreover, combin-

ing existing resources seemed a promising approach 

towards our goal, due to the grammatical difficulties 

of Spanish4, as there are fewer resources than in 

English (Janssen, 2005). 

The rest of this work is organised as follows. In 

Section 2 we review the existing linguistic resources 

for Spanish and the process conducted to build Elsa. 

In Section 3 we present an automatic lexicon exten-

sion procedure. Then, in Section 4 we conduct an

evaluation of the created lexicon. In Section 5 we 

provide a use case of Elsa within an NLG system. 

Section 6 concludes the paper. 

2 Reusing existing resources to build Elsa  

The construction of Elsa begins with the selection 

of an available pictographic set for AAC users. After 

evaluating some possibilities5 we choose the free 

and highly comprehensive Arasaac6 set. Nonethe-

less, this dataset had to be preprocessed by remov-

ing the pictograms with the same meaning and word 

descriptions, whose redundancy is due to their dif-

ferent representation according to their colour. By 

doing so, we obtained our icon set with 9,411 picto-

grams, of which 6,970 have a single associated word 

(including proper names) and the rest are verbal 

phrases or compound proper names. Once this step 

is finished, it is necessary to add POS tags, syntactic 

and semantic information to each Arasaac word en-

try. For this purpose, we looked for available Span-

ish linguistic resources. We choose: 

 Adesse7 (García-Miguel, Vaamonde, & 

González Domínguez, 2010). 

 Multilingual Central Repository8 (MCR) 
(González-Agirre, Laparra, & Rigau, 2012). 

 Lexicon of Spanish inflected forms9 (LEFFE) 
(Molinero, Sagot, & Nicolas, 2009). 

We start the process by extracting from each re-

source some information on the forms of the prepro-

cessed icon set. Next, our approach follows the two 

well-defined steps (Crouch & King, 2005) between 

which we include a verification step: (1) we extract 

and map the form entries to a common format, 

adapted from Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) 

format (Francopoulo, et al., 2006); (2) we verify 

them at a lexical level in the DRAE10; and finally (3) 

we combine the entries once they have been found 

                                                                                                            
5 Some of them were: Pictographic Communication System 

(http://www.mayer-johnson.com/category/sym-

bols-and-photos) and Pictogram (http://www.pic-

togram.se), which are not free; or Widgit 

(https://widgit.com) with no support for Spanish.

to be equivalent using the graph unification model 

(Necsulescu, Bel, Padró, Marimon & Revilla, 2011; 

Bel, Padró & Necsulescu, 2011). This operation is 

based on set unions of compatible feature values, al-

lowing the validation of common information, the 

addition of differential information and the exclu-

sion of inconsistencies.

and merging are explained in Algorithms 1, 2 and 3, 

respectively. In algorithm 4, we can observe the 

composition of the steps as explained in this Sec-

tion.

3 Automatic lexicon extension 

Keeping in mind that we intend to use this lexicon 

within an NLG system adapted to AAC users, and in 

order to facilitate the task of avoiding pictograms 

related to prepositions, we need to infer a priori 

which specific preposition follows a verb. The train-

ing process was performed using a dataset com-

posed of novels and nearly five hundred tales in 

Spanish (Andersen, 2016; Anonymous, 2016; 

Grimm, 2016), previously POS-tagged applied with 

Freeling Tagger11, since we plan to use the lexicon 

in AAC applications for children with disabilities 

and these are the only contents with pictogram rep-

resentation. In this regard, we are able to include 

more options beyond those present in the subcate-

gorization frames for verbs taken from LEFFE and 

Adesse, such as those related to figurative language 

approaches12. Since this grammar realization is not 

present in the selected lexica, we developed a lan-

guage model from a training process, considering 

bigrams and trigrams around verbs and using syn-

tactic and semantic knowledge. 

4 Experimental results 

In order to evaluate the quality of Elsa, we first 

measured the coverage achieved after adding the in-

formation extracted from all resources. Table 1 

shows the number of lemmas that were included in 

each resource. Table 2 shows the coverage of Elsa 

over the icon set. Our lexicon covered almost the

vices, including probabilistic prediction of categories in un-

known words (Atserias et al., 2006; Padró & Stanilovsky, 

2012). 

entire icon set and most word entries include syn-

tactic and semantic data essential to conduct the 

NLG process correctly. Moreover, Table 3 shows the 

number of lemmas and forms classified by catego-

ries. Most lemmas (3,165) are tagged as nouns, rep-

resenting 7,035 inflected forms added to Elsa, 

whereas most forms (45,341) are tagged as verbs, 

representing 811 lemmas.

desagradar ‘displease’ in Elsa 

Figure 1 shows an example in adapted LMF for-

mat of the word entry desagradar ‘displease’ with 

morphological, syntactic and semantic data. Sem-

Synset contains the semantic information from MCR. 

In addition to the conjugation in WordForm, SCF 

contains the syntactic information on the verb after 

combining the data extracted from LEFFE and 

Adesse. There is only one possible realization in the 

active form, where the subject is an estímulo ‘stim- 

 

12 For example the verb comer ‘eat’ whose subcategoriza-

tion frames did not include the possibility of using the prep-

osition a with people, even though it is widely employed in 

tales, as in the clause El lobo se comío a la abuelita ‘The 

wolf ate the granny’.

ulus’ and the verb is followed by an indirect object13 

that is an experimentador ‘experimenter’. 

In SCF_training, a new preposition, a ‘to’ (not 

present in any of the selected resources), was in-

ferred in order to use it within the subcategorization 

frame of the verb (before the indirect object oind). 

In addition, the Elsa entry desagradar ‘displease’ is 

linked to a pictogram image file from the icon set.

5 Elsa use case: NLG system 

Assuming that our system input is: tiempo, desagra-

dar, profesor, ayer ‘weather, displease, teacher, 

yesterday’. 

 System output using Elsa: El tiempo de-
sagradó al profesor ayer ‘The weather dis-

pleased the teacher yesterday’. 

                                                                                                            
13 In Spanish an intransitive verb has not direct object but it 

may be followed by an indirect object or other comple-

ments. 

 System output without using Elsa: El tiempo 
desagradar el profesor ayer ‘The weather dis-

please the teacher yesterday’ (where displease 

is the infinitive of the verb).  

In this example, the system can determine that 

desagradar ‘displease’ is a verb, whose subject is 

tiempo ‘weather’, followed by an indirect object 

profesor ‘teacher’. In addition, this verb needs the 

preposition a ‘to’ because profesor ‘teacher’ is a 

person. Besides, the presence of the adverb ayer 

‘yesterday’ indicates that the tense is past. Our sys-

tem would neither infer the additional elements 

needed nor the correct morphological inflections re-

lated to the syntactic and semantic features without 

the linguistic information provided by Elsa. 

6 Conclusions 

Elsa is an approach for lexica generation specially 

tailored for the needs of AAC applications. Besides 

including several types of linguistic information 

(morphology, syntax and semantics), a training pro-

cess was executed to complete the subcategorization 

frames for verbs, like those present in figurative lan-

guage. The resulting lexicon may be useful for as-

sisting people with communication disabilities 

through NLG systems. In order to increase efficiency 

and precision, additional linguistic resources can be 

easily integrated due to the fact that the building 

process is automatic. To complete the semantic in-

formation, we propose to establish synonymy rela-

tions between the word entries to reuse their seman-

tic classification and fill in the missing information.
