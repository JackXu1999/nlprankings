Abstract

This paper undertakes the modelling ex-
periment of translating excerpts of the nat-
ural language play - “Faust” by Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe - into a RDF struc-
ture, so that it is accessible by machines
on a word or concept level. Thereby, it is
crucial that statements made in the logic
of the play can be distinguished from the
usual, general purpose Linked Open Data.
The goal is to find a standard compliant so-
lution, stressing RDF’s central role in the
Web of Data as a format for arbitrary data.

1 Introduction

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is
meant to be the ideal data format for arbitrary
information in the Web of Data, since it is
open, machine-readable, non-proprietary and a
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard.
In Berners-Lees popular five star ranking system,
rankings above three stars can only be archived if
the data is published in RDF (Berners-Lee, 2009).

Thus, this format plays an important role in
many data portals1, which publish data according
to the Linked Open Data (LOD) paradigm.

RDF is the approved and commonly known
method of making information of any kind avail-
able to machines, so they can access it in a struc-
tured way.

2 Motivation

However, when talking about publishing natural
language content as LOD, the simple but very
strict design goal of structuring information for
machines is often violated. Whenever the natu-
ral language itself is not the modelling subject,

1Popular Open Data portals are http://data.go

uk/ (accessed 2013-07-05) or https://www.govda
ta.de/ (accessed 2013-07-05).

datasets usually treat RDF as a meta data format,
where accompanying natural language content re-
mains either semi-structured (like in the Bible On-
tology2) or entirely unstructured (like in Guten-
berg in RDF3), in fields of the type xs:string.
In both cases, natural language content is still not
readable (in terms of accessible in a structured
way) by machines - despite the fact that RDF is
used. It’s just displayable, just like it is displayable
in the ”eyeball Web” (Breslin et al., 2009, p. 82).

3 Idea

This paper is about the experiment Faust.rdf.
Thereby, the author tries to strictly apply the cen-
tral design principle of the RDF format, namely
structuring information in a machine readable
way, to natural language content, that would other-
wise just be stored as xs:string. This means that
natural language needs to be converted in a very
structured variant, that formalizes the content on
word or concept level. To choose a realistic sce-
nario, the source material that is being formalized
is the play “Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy”
(Faust I) from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe4.

The idea and the selected kind of source text
is heavily inspired by the work of Richard Light,
who expressed the works of Shakespeare as LOD
(Light, 2013). In contrast to this paper, there is
one important difference: The resulting LOD of
Light semi-structures Shakespeare’s texts, having
selected an actual text line as smallest modelling
atomicity. When taking RDF’s principles liter-
ally, this goes, in the opinion of the author, not
far enough.

Faust.rdf is about trying to model selected state-
ments of Faust with RDF’s capacities, with the
atomicity of words or concepts. The goal of iden-
tifying the status quo of RDF for this kind of
modelling subjects and documenting experienced
challenges. Resulting RDF statements would, of
course, not replace or constitute the entire source
text. Instead, it would form a novel kind of sec-
ondary source in the spirit of the Open Data move-
ment. This is comparable to Wikipedia, where
there are articles in English and, alternatively, in
Simple English5.

4 Requirements

The figures 1a and 1b show the definition the two
central entities, that are considered in the follow-
ing formalization of a literature work:

verse(time, source, speaker, type, act) (1a)

content[verse](statements) (1b)

The basic unit of a text is a verse, that refers to
a certain time measure (which is, in poetry, usu-
ally the verse number). It’s also constituted by
the source, the human readable original text, an
optional definition of the speaker, the type of the
verse (whether it is a question, a proposition or a
scene description) and the act in which the verse
is subordinated to.

This structure is very generic and is compa-
rable to other, semi-structured approaches, like
Light’s Shakespeare experiment (2013). In con-
trast to those approaches, the entity content is de-
fined, consisting of actual statements about the
natural language content of a play and the refer-
enced verse, as defined above.

The goal is to produce five-star LOD (Berners-
Lee, 2009) that represents the entities in the script
of the play as close as possible. Thereby, links
to external references are important and the un-
derlying poetry needs to be understood properly.
This is in contrast to automatic RDF extraction ap-
proaches like FRED6 or the controlled vocabular-
ies Attempto Controlled English7 and Processible
English8, that try to extract and to represent logi-
cal relations out of a given natural language text.

As this is a novel endeavor, the translation of Faust
into RDF statements is a manual process.

5 Design

The solution consists of two design decisions: The
exact way of how the two defined entities verse
(1a) and content (1b) are converted into a RDF
structure, and which LOD datasets are employed
in that process.

5.1 RDF structure

In this modelling approach, context is very im-
portant. A verse in poetry does not contain
general-purpose world knowledge, but very play-
and actor-specific, subjective views on a fictional
world - that could even turn out to be wrong at a
later point.

To respect this fact in the realm of RDF, N-
Quads (Cyganiak et al., 2008) can be used. N-
Quads extend the subject, predicate and object of
RDF triples with the fourth component context,
which allows an optional definition of context for
those triples.

RDF triples about the verse are within the con-
text of the entire play (1a), and it is sufficient to
rely on the basic building blocks of the Seman-
tic Web (Allemang and Hendler, 2011, p. 9) by
choosing an adequately unique Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI). Instead, statements about the ac-
tual content (1b) of a certain verse are where pro-
tagonists claim, ask or lie. Thus it is a good idea
of having a special handling for this kind of state-
ments, i.e. putting the RDF triples about the con-
tent in a quadruple, in the context of a certain
verse.

5.2 LOD datasets

LOD portals, in this case Datahub9, make it very
easy nowadays to find the linguistically grounded
and interlinked data sets for the given use case.

In this project, entities are linked with
lemonUby10, one of the most comprehensive re-
sources, especially in linking verbs. In addition,
DBpedia11 has an entry for entire play12, which is
used as namespace for all Faust.rdf statements.

Besides these LOD datasets, the source
texts in natural language are taken from
eBooks@Adelaide13 (English) and Wikisource14

(German).

6 Implementation

In this section, the findings of the preceding sec-
tions are tested with an exemplary RDF transla-
tion in the N-Quads notation. Thereby, the verses
1323 to 1325 of Faust are excerpted. In the En-
glish source text, they read (Goethe, 2005):

FAUST
1323 This was the poodle’s real core,
1324 A travelling scholar, then?

The casus is diverting.
MEPHISTOPHELES

1325 The learned gentleman I bow
before

In the following, the RDF translation of worth-
while parts is documented. Please note that triples
are abbreviated using prefixes15, even though the
N-Quads notation format does not allow them.
The full translation of verses 1323 to 1325 is avail-
able at GitHub16.

6.1 Common statements
First, the protagonists Faust and Mephistopheles
are introduced as instances of person respectively
devil:
<:Faust> <rdf:type>

<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_15513> .

<:Mephistopheles> <rdf:type>
<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_134036> .

6.2 Verse Metadata
Translation of the verses follow a given, straight-
forward pattern, as introduced 1a on the preceding
page. First, the source text is defined as human
readable label:
<:verse1323> <rdfs:label>

"This was the poodle’s real core"@en .

Line number and act are defined in a similar
way and are omitted in this paper. However, trans-
lating the certain kind for verse 1324 is especially

(accessed 2013-07-07).

15Besides the common rdf and rdfs prefixes, the following
are used: ubywn = http://lemon-model.net/l
exica/uby/wn/, ubyvn= http://lemon-model.
net/lexica/uby/vn/. Default namespace is http:
//dbpedia.org/page/Faust_I

notable, as this verse contains a question as well
as an assertion. After defining verse 1324 in the
fashion of verse 1323 above, there are two varia-
tions:
<:verse1324a> <rdfs:subClassOf>

<:verse1324> .
<:verse1324b> <rdfs:subClassOf>

<:verse1324> .
# "verse1324a is a question"
<:verse1324a> <rdf:type>

<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_153777> .
# "verse1324b is a statement"
<:verse1324b> <rdf:type>

<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_81754> .

The per-verse meta data is completed by the as-
signment of the according speakers, e.g.:

# "Faust asks verse1324a"
<:Faust> <ubyvn:VN_LexicalEntry_1993>

<:verse1324a> .

6.3 Verse content
As mentioned, the verse content is defined with N-
Quads, having the individual verses as respective
context. This allows to distinguish between gen-
eral purpose world knowledge, like the fact that
the play Faust has a certain verse 1324, from el-
ements of the play, like the fact that the devil is
a poodle. This way, it is also possible to encode
a lie: Just like in the previous section, a certain
verse would not be defined as a statement, but as
a lie. Thanks to the context notation, further RDF
statements can be made within the context of this
verse, respectively in the context of this lie.

The following statements reflect the content of
the verses 1323 to 1325:

“This was the poodle’s real core”

# "Poodle is a disguise"
<:Poodle> <rdf:type>
<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_48830>
<:verse1323> .

# "Poodle transforms into Mephistopheles
<:Poodle> <ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_90692>

<:Mephistopheles> <:verse1323> .

“A travelling scholar, then?
The casus is diverting.”

# "Mephistopheles is a travelingScholar"
<:Mephistopheles> <rdf:type>

_:travelingScholar <:verse1324a> .
# "travelingScholar is a scholar"
_:travelingScholar <rdf:type>

<ubyvn:WN_LexicalEntry_99198> .
# "travelingScholar is a traveler"
_:travelingScholar <rdf:type>

<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_115017> .

# "Verse 1324a amuses Faust"
<:verse1324a>

61



<ubyvn:VN_LexicalEntry_2516>
<:Faust> <:verse1324b> .

“The learned gentleman I bow before”

# "Verse 1324a is true"
<:verse1324a> <rdf:type>

<ubywn:WN_LexicalEntry_53631>
<:verse1325> .

# "Mephistopheles appreciates Faust"
<:Mephistopheles>

<ubyvn:VN_LexicalEntry_731>
<:Faust> <:verse1325> .

7 A critical view

This is a very first step and the translation might
be neither perfect nor complete. While modelling
the verse metadata is a not very exciting task, the
crucial thing is to have a working context pattern
for the actual content RDF statements.

It can be stated that RDF is, together with the
N-Quads notation, indeed able to represent a fic-
tional play, including the conditional statements
that it involves. It is notable that N-Quads can
considered to be a shortcut for a number of reifica-
tion statements, as stated by an early mailing list
posting (Palmer, 2001). Therefore, even pure RDF
could able to cope with contexts, even though the
resulting code would be much more complicated.

In the previous attempt17, YAGO218 in combi-
nation of DBpedias subproject Wiktionary19 was
used to interlink entities. However, because both
datasets still certain words, some translation re-
sults didn’t reflect the play properly.

Not being able to use prefix-namespaces, how-
ever, bloated up results unnecessarily and affected
human readability. Having available assisting edi-
tor tools during the manual translation would have
made things easier or at least faster. There is a
clear lack of assistive, cross-disciplinary Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and LOD tools, that
are both user friendly and still can cope with giant,
distributed datasets like YAGO2 and DBpedia.

8 Conclusion

When storing natural language, RDF still today
plays a metadata role: Texts remain un- or semi-

structured, stored in xs:string-fields, inaccessi-
ble to machines just like before the “eyeball Web”.

This paper undertakes the experiment of trans-
lating a natural language script of play, excerpts
of Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, on a
word or concept level into a RDF structure, so
that it is accessible by machines, in the spirit of
five-star LOD. Thereby, it is crucial that fictional
statements made by protagonists of the play can
be distinguished from the other, general-purpose
statements containing world knowledge.

With N-Quads, in association with a number
of datasets like lemonUby and DBpedia, a conve-
nient solution is successfully designed and exem-
plary tested. This demonstrates the maturity of the
used datasets as well as the RDF format, confirm-
ing it as a credible backbone of the LOD move-
ment. Nevertheless, some issues are identified, re-
garding interdisciplinary tool support for the NLP
and LOD domain.

9 Outlook

Having available large amounts of natural lan-
guage texts, structured like proposed in this paper,
would have a number of benefits.

As mentioned, in the role of a secondary source,
RDF statements could give users hints in under-
standing the idea of the original text. This is es-
pecially important for very old texts, that use old-
fashioned variants of natural languages that, even-
tually, only historians can understand.

Another benefit is that it could enable even non-
experts to answer in-depth questions on the text,
e.g. in case of Faust I: “In which scene does the
devil appear the first time?”20

Also, knowledge-based NLP applications could
become more common, like a Machine Transla-
tion approach, for example, which relies on the
ability to extract human readable stories from RDF
(Harriehausen-Mühlbauer and Heuss, 2012).

The author wants to thank Richard Light, Bern-
hard G. Humm and Kerstin Reinking for the in-
spiring discussions. He also thanks the LDL2013
reviewers for the very useful suggestions, which
significantly improved this work.

20In Faust I, answering the question of the first appearance
of the devil requires a deeper text understanding, as he first
appears in form of a dog, that later transforms into the devil.
