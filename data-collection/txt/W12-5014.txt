ABSTRACT 

In continuous speech, the pitch contour exhibits variable patterns and it is strongly influenced by 

its tone context. Although several effective models have been proposed to improve the accuracy 

for tonal syllables, the quality of Vietnamese synthesis system is poor by lack of lexical 

parameters corresponding to each syllable in modelling of fundamental frequency. This problem 

will be clarified by our experiment in this study. 

This paper presents our study on tonal co-articulation of particles which are frequently used in 

Vietnamese language. The obtained results show that tonal co-articulation phenomenon always 

takes place at the transition between two adjacent syllables, the progressive co-articulation is the 

basic tonal co-articulation and there is an influence of the function of particles on form of F0 

contour of Vietnamese tones.

1 Introduction 

Vietnamese is a monosyllabic and tonal language. Each Vietnamese character corresponds to a 
syllable which is associated with a lexical tone. Syllables with different tone have different 
meanings, so the tone plays an important role in distinguishing lexical meaning for a family of 
syllables. As is well known, for a tonal language, like Vietnamese, Chinese (Mandarin or 
Cantonese) or Thai, fundamental frequency (F0) contours of utterances are always composed of 
tonal local features (tones and the co-articulation between adjacent tones) and the sentential 
intonation (corresponding to higher-level structures). This makes F0 variations of sentence more 
complicated than non-tonal languages such as English or French. 
 
Recently, Vietnamese has been the subject of much linguistic research. Most of studies have 
concentrated on analyzing the characteristics of isolated word [2][3] or some on tonal features 
[1][4]. Researches on tonal co-articulation in Vietnamese were also presented in studies [1][4][5].  
 
Tonal co-articulation phenomena are specific co-articulation phenomena for languages using 
tones.  In Thai language [6], there are two types of tonal co-articulation: anticipatory and carryover 
co-articulation. The F0 contour shape of a syllable that is influenced by the succeeding syllable is 
called “anticipatory co-articulation”. The carryover co-articulation occurs when the preceding 
syllable influences the succeeding syllable. Gandour [6] reported that the co-articulation effect of 
Thai tones is asymmetric. Thai tones were more influenced by carryover than by anticipatory co-
articulation. The tonal co-articulation in Mandarin is also classified into both types: anticipatory 
and carryover co-articulation [7][8]. In Shen’s study [7], nonsense strings of syllables were used as 
reading list, whereas Shir and Sproat [8] used real words and phrases. In Shir’s study speakers 
were instructed to produce the utterances as naturally as possible. In order to study phenomena 
involved in co-articulation of tones in Mandarin, Xu Y [9] provided 4 theoretically possible 
transitional patterns between two tones. Similar to the results of [8], two in four possible tonal 
transitions (Exclusive Assimilation and Exclusive Carryover) were found for Mandarin language.  
 
In Vietnamese, the studies [1][4] and [5] show that the progressive tonal co-articulation is stronger 
than the regressive tonal co-articulation.  In these studies, authors focused on analysis of tonal co-
articulation between two adjacent syllables, they have not take into account information about 
lexical category (or part of speech) of considered words.  

In order to study the influence of lexical category in phenomena of tonal co-articulation, this 

paper presents our study on tonal co-articulation of particles (such as ‘ạ’, ‘dạ’, ‘chứ’, ‘đi’ …) 

which are frequently used in Vietnamese language. The paper is organized as follows. Section II 

introduces the speech corpus which is used in the analysis process. Section III gives the analysis 

results on the tonal co-articulation phenomenona which occur  at the considered particles. Section 

IV gives some conclusions and perspectives. 

2 Bi-tone speech corpus 

A speech corpus of bi-tone pairs of two adjacent syllables was prepared  in our experiment. In 

addition, each sentence in the text corpus is constructed of an affirmative sentence and a particle 

at the last position of the sentence, for instance: “Lâu lâu mới gặp lại, chị vào nhà tôi chơi / 

nhé!”(We haven’t met each other for a long time, let’s come to my house). In the sentence the 

word “nhé” is a particle and “Lâu lâu mới gặp lại, chị vào nhà tôi chơi” is an affirmative 

sentence. The bi-tone pairs in these sentences are the last two syllables. For example, in the 

164



sentence “Trước mẹ con vẫn gắp cho con kia!” (Figure 1) the last two syllables “con kia” are 

analyzed. The corpus of  these bi-tone pairs help to clarify the effects which the tonal context or 

the lexical context causes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1: F0 contour of the sentence “Trước mẹ con vẫn gắp cho con kia!” 

Therefore, a text corpus including 144 sentences in dialogs which were extracted from 6 

Vietnamese famous short stories “Bóng mây chiều”, “Dế mèn”, “Tuyển tập truyện ngắn Hồ 

Dzếnh”, “Kính vạn hoa”, “Tuyển tập truyện ngắn Thạch Lam” và “Tuổi 20 yêu dấu” was 

collected.  

These 144 sentences are divided into 6 groups as follows: 
- Group 1: 24 sentences contain particles carrying the level tone (Tone 1). 
- Group 2: 24 sentences contain particles carrying the falling tone (Tone 2). 
- Group 3: 24 sentences contain particles carrying the broken tone (Tone 3). 
- Group 4: 24 sentences contain particles carrying curve tone (Tone 4). 
- Group 5: 24 sentences contain particles carrying the rising tone (Tone 5). 
- Group 6: 24 sentences contain particles carrying the drop tone (Tone 6). 

 
Each group is divided into 6 subgroups based on the tone (6 tones) which is carried by the 
preceding syllable of the particle. Each subgroup contains 4 sentences. For example: 
 

Group 1 is composed of 6 subgroups: S1-1, S1-2, S1-3, S1-4, S1-5 and S1-6. In the subgroup 
S1-1, the sentences have particles carrying level tone and the preceding syllable also carrying 
level tone.  
- “Trước mẹ con vẫn gắp cho con / kia!”(In meal my mother used to pick food for me) 
- “Có một việc quan trọng phải nhờ cậu mới xong / đây!”(There is an important work that 

we must need your help) 

 

The text corpus is then used to build a speech corpus. The recording progress was taken place in 

a quite environment at a quiet studio. A male and female who have Hanoi voice were asked to 

read each sentence two times at a normal speaking rate. The speech corpus was then labeled 

manually using the PRAAT program.

3 Analysis  

We carry out an analysis of the variation of fundamental frequency for every subgroup of 

sentences. F0 values of the sentences are extracted automatically by using Praat software. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2: F0 contours in subgroup 2-2 

 

 

Figure 2 presents evolution of F0 contours in subgroup S2-2 (which has a pair of tones: falling – 

falling). In the figure m and f refer consequently “male” and “female”; mij denotes the ith 

recorded sample of the jth sentence of the male speaker in the group; and fij denotes the ith 

recorded sample of the jth sentence of the female speaker. 

We can see in Figure 2, the F0 contours of the preceding falling tones fall slowly and converge at 

the ending position. However, values of F0 at the beginning positions of these syllables are quite 

different. By carrying a larger analysis, we found that the difference is caused by an effect of 

tonal co-articulation. The tones of the syllables that stand just before the analyzed syllables are 

different. For example, concerning f11 and f14 sentences, the three last syllables of these 

sentences are “có tiền à” (/kɔ_5 tien_2 ɑ_2/) and “nhiều tiền mà” (/ɳiew_2 tien_2 mɑ_2/) 
consequently. It is easy to see that the last two syllables have the same pair of tones (falling – 

falling), but the tone of the 1
st
 syllable in case of f14 is the falling tone (Tone 2), while the tone of 

the 1
st
 syllable in case of f11 is the rising tone (Tone 5). Thus, F0 values of the beginning 

positions in sentence f11 are higher than that of sentence f14.  

166



Concerning the falling tone carried by the particle words, in Figure 2 we found that, the shape of 

F0 contours of this tone has a little difference in comparison to that in the static mode. The F0 

contours of these syllables fall slowly at the start positions and then rise to the ending positions. 

This can be explained as follows: a particle is also the last syllable of an imperative or a question, 

so its F0 contour usually rises up, like the results of studies [10][11]. 

To observe the tonal co-articulation more clearly, similar to the research of Brunelle [1], we 

carried out comparing an effect of the preceding syllable’s tone on the succeeding syllable’s tone. 

In order to facilitate the analysis, the values of the extracted F0 are normalized into a sequence of 

six points. Each syllable is divided into 6 parts and the average value of F0 is calculated for each 

part. Therefore, for a syllable pair, points from 0 to 5 are belong to the first syllable (the last 

syllable of the affirmative sentence), and points from 6 to 11 are belong to the second syllable (a 

particle). 

4 The results 

The normalized F0 contours of the subgroups of sentences are presented in figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

In these figures:                                               

- t1 presents the average normalized F0 contour of the set of sentences that have the 
preceding syllable (the syllable stands before the particle) porting the level tone (Tone 1).  

- Similar to t1, t2 – t6 present the average normalized F0 contours of sets of sentences that 
have the preceding syllable carrying tones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 consequently. 

From these figures, the first result can be easily seen that: tonal co-articulation phenomenon 

always happens at the transition between two adjacent syllables, and the progressive co-

articulation seems the basic tonal co-articulation, like the results presented in [1][4][5]. 

 

We pay more attention to representations of Tone 1 and Tone 2 which are presented in the figures 

3 and 4.

(right) speakers 

167



 

Figure 4: F0 contours of tone pairs in Group 2 (particle carries falling tone) with male (left) and female 
(right) speakers 

In Figure 3, after ending the preceding syllable, F0 contours of Tone 1 (level tone) tend to rise to 

the end of succeeding syllables and it only fall lightly at the last point. Whereas, in studies 

[1][11], the F0 contour of Tone 1 is quite stable and falls lightly down to the end of the 

succeeding syllable (same as Tone 1 in isolated syllable). 

Like the particles carrying Tone 1, we can see clearly the same result in case of the particles 

porting Tone 2 (falling tone). In Figure 4, F0 contour of this tone can start at either low or high 

register. At the last half of syllable F0 contour either is stable or rises slightly. Whereas, in static 

mode, Tone 2 starts lower than the level tone then falls slowly and its slope is never goes up. In 

the studies of [1][11], in dynamic mode (continuous speech), F0 contours of Tone 2 falls slowly. 

This results shows that there is an affect of the function of particles on evolution of F0. The result 

seems logic, because the particles in our corpus stand at the last position of sentence. The 

function of these words is to make the sentence become either an interrogative or an imperative 

sentence. According to studies [10][11], in Vietnamese interrogative and imperative sentences, 

the contour of the last syllable or of its second half tends to increase.

(right) speakers

Figure 6: F0 contours of tone pairs in Group 4 (particle carries curve tone) with male (left) and female 
(right) speakers 

 

Figure 7: F0 contours of tone pairs in Group 5 (particle carries rising tone) with male (left) and female 
(right) speakers 

 

Figure 8: F0 contours of tone pairs in Group 6 (particle carries drop tone) with male (left) and female 
(right) speakers 

In remaining tones, the phenomenon in which F0 contour of the last half of particle rises up also 
takes place. However, phenomenon is caused not only by the function of particles but also by the 
evolution of F0 contour of the tone that syllables carry. These tones (Tone 3, Tone 4 and Tone 5) 
have the F0 contour rising at the last half of syllable.  

The standard deviation of 6 tones at 6 points is presented in following tables:

Tone 5 17 16 16 14.6 10 4.55 

Tone 6 17 16 16 16.5 17.1 16.7 

 

We can see that the standard deviation values at initial points (P1, P2 and P3) which are close to 
the preceding syllable are almost higher than that’s of the final points (P4, P5 and P6). This is 
entirely consistent with above results.  
 
The variation of F0 of Tone 6 is quite different in comparison with other tones. Because of the 
glottalization phenomenon at ending position, F0 contour at the second last syllable of syllables 
porting this tone changes in large range and this can make a non precise measurement of F0 by 
Praat. Therefore, value of standard deviations is quite high. 

Conclusion and perspectives  

The paper presents our research on phenomena of tonal co-articulation on particles in 

Vietnamese. The obtained results show that tonal co-articulation phenomena always take place at 

the transition between two adjacent syllables, and the progressive co-articulation is the basic 

tonal co-articulation. And there is an influence of the function of particles on form of F0 contour 

of Vietnamese tones. Therefore, it has to take into account this information when doing an 

analysis variation of fundamental frequency, especially on modeling Vietnamese intonation for 

Vietnamese text to speech synthesis. 

In our study, the corpus is still limited. There are only two speakers and the particles always 

stand at the last position of sentences. These limitations will be studied more deeply in next 

researches with more speakers and other specific words at different positions.
