Abstract

In this paper, we develop a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm called hybrid deep be-
lief networks (HDBN), to address the semi-supervised sentiment classification problem with
deep learning. First, we construct the previous several hidden layers using restricted Boltzmann
machines (RBM), which can reduce the dimension and abstract the information of the reviews
quickly. Second, we construct the following hidden layers using convolutional restricted Boltz-
mann machines (CRBM), which can abstract the information of reviews effectively. Third, the
constructed deep architecture is fine-tuned by gradient-descent based supervised learning with an
exponential loss function. We did several experiments on five sentiment classification datasets,
and show that HDBN is competitive with previous semi-supervised learning algorithm. Ex-
periments are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with different
number of unlabeled reviews.

1 Introduction

Recently, more and more people write reviews and share opinions on the World Wide Web, which present
a wealth of information on products and services (Liu et al., 2010). These reviews will not only help other
users make better judgements but they are also useful resources for manufacturers of products to keep
track and manage customer opinions (Wei and Gulla, 2010). However, there are large amount of reviews
for every topic, it is difficult for a user to manually learn the opinions of an interesting topic. Sentiment
classification, which aims to classify a text according to the expressed sentimental polarities of opinions
such as ’positive’ or ’negtive’, ’thumb up’ or ’thumb down’, ’favorable’ or ’unfavorable’ (Li et al., 2010),
can facilitate the investigation of corresponding products or services.

In order to learn a good text classifier, a large number of labeled reviews are often needed for training
(Zhen and Yeung, 2010). However, labeling reviews is often difficult, expensive or time consuming
(Chapelle et al., 2006). On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain a large number of unlabeled reviews,
such as the growing availability and popularity of online review sites and personal blogs (Pang and Lee,
2008). In recent years, a new approach called semi-supervised learning, which uses large amount of
unlabeled data together with labeled data to build better learners (Zhu, 2007), has been developed in the
machine learning community.

There are several works have been done in semi-supervised learning for sentiment classification, and
get competitive performance (Li et al., 2010; Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010). However, most
of the existing semi-supervised learning methods are still far from satisfactory. As shown by several re-
searchers (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007; Hinton et al., 2006), deep architecture, which composed of
multiple levels of non-linear operations, is expected to perform well in semi-supervised learning because
of its capability of modeling hard artificial intelligent tasks. Deep belief networks (DBN) is a represen-
tative deep learning algorithm achieving notable success for text classification, which is a directed belief
nets with many hidden layers constructed by restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), and refined by a
gradient-descent based supervised learning (Hinton et al., 2006). Ranzato and Szummer (Ranzato and

Szummer, 2008) propose an algorithm to learn text document representations based on semi-supervised
auto-encoders that are combined to form a deep network. Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2010) propose a nov-
el semi-supervised learning algorithm to address the semi-supervised sentiment classification problem
with active learning. The key issue of traditional DBN is the efficiency of RBM training. Convolutional
neural networks (CNN), which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional
shapes, have had great success in machine learning tasks and represent one of the early successes of
deep learning (LeCun et al., 1998). Desjardins and Bengio (Desjardins and Bengio, 2008) adapt RBM
to operate in a convolutional manner, and show that the convolutional RBM (CRBM) are more efficient
than standard RBM.

CRBM has been applied successfully to a wide range of visual and audio recognition tasks (Lee et al.,
2009a; Lee et al., 2009b). Though the success of CRBM in addressing two dimensional issues, there
is still no published research on the using of CRBM in textual information processing. In this paper,
we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm called hybrid deep belief networks (HDBN), to
address the semi-supervised sentiment classification problem with deep learning. HDBN is a hybrid of
RBM and CRBM deep architecture, the bottom layers are constructed by RBM, and the upper layers are
constructed by CRBM, then the whole constructed deep architecture is fine tuned by a gradient-descent
based supervised learning based on an exponential loss function.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our semi-supervised
learning method HDBN in details. Extensive empirical studies conducted on five real-world sentiment
datasets are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes our paper.

2 Hybrid deep belief networks

2.1 Problem formulation

The sentiment classification dataset composed of many review documents, each review document com-
posed of a bag of words. To classify these review documents using corpus-based approaches, we need to
preprocess them in advance. The preprocess method for these reviews is similar with (Zhou et al., 2010).
We tokenize and downcase each review and represent it as a vector of unigrams, using binary weight
equal to 1 for terms present in a vector. Moreover, the punctuations, numbers, and words of length one
are removed from the vector. Finally, we combine all the words in the dataset, sort the vocabulary by
document frequency and remove the top 1.5%, because many of these high document frequency words
are stopwords or domain specific general-purpose words.

After preprocess, each review can be represented as a vector of binary weight xi. If the jth word of
the vocabulary is in the ith review, xij = 1; otherwise, x

i
j = 0. Then the dataset can be represented as a

matrix:

X =

x1,x2, . . . ,xR+T

 (1)
where R is the number of training reviews, T is the number of test reviews, D is the number of feature
words in the dataset. Every column of X corresponds to a sample x, which is a representation of a
review. A sample that has all features is viewed as a vector in RD, where the ith coordinate corresponds
to the ith feature.

The L labeled reviews are chosen randomly from R training reviews, or chosen actively by active
learning, which can be seen as:

XL = XR (S) , S = [s1, ..., sL], 1 ≤ si ≤ R (2)

where S is the index of selected training reviews to be labeled manually.

where C is the number of classes. Every column of Y is a vector in RC , where the jth coordinate
corresponds to the jth class.

yij =

−1 if xi /∈ jth class (4)

For example, if a review xi is positive, yi = [1,−1]′; otherwise, yi = [−1, 1]′.
We intend to seek the mapping function X→ Y using the L labeled data and all unlabeled data. After

training, we can determine y using the mapping function when a new sample x comes.

2.2 Architecture of HDBN
In this part, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method HDBN to address the problem for-
mulated in Section 2.1. The sentiment datasets have high dimension (about 10,000), and computation
complexity of convolutional calculation is relatively high, so we use RBM to reduce the dimension of
review with normal calculation firstly. Fig. 1 shows the deep architecture of HDBN, a fully intercon-
nected directed belief nets with one input layer h0, N hidden layers h1,h2, ...,hN , and one label layer at
the top. The input layer h0 has D units, equal to the number of features of sample review x. The hidden

layer hasM layers constructed by RBM andN−M layers constructed by CRBM. The label layer has C
units, equal to the number of classes of label vector y. The numbers of hidden layers and the number of
units for hidden layers, currently, are pre-defined according to the experience or intuition. The seeking
of the mapping function X → Y, here, is transformed to the problem of finding the parameter space
W = {w1,w2, . . . ,wN} for the deep architecture.

The training of the HDBN can be divided into two stages:

1. HDBN is constructed by greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning using RBMs and CRBMs as
building blocks. L labeled data and all unlabeled data are utilized to find the parameter space W
with N layers.

2. HDBN is trained according to the exponential loss function using gradient descent based supervised
learning. The parameter space W is refined using L labeled data.

2.3 Unsupervised learning
As show in Fig. 1, we construct HDBN layer by layer using RBMs and CRBMs, the details of RBM can
be seen in (Hinton et al., 2006), and CRBM is introduced below.

The architecture of CRBM can be seen in Fig. 2, which is similar to RBM, a two-layer recurrent
neural network in which stochastic binary input groups are connected to stochastic binary output groups
using symmetrically weighted connections. The top layer represents a vector of stochastic binary hidden
feature hk and the bottom layer represents a vector of binary visible data hk−1, k = M + 1, ..., N . The
kth layer consists of Gk groups, where each group consists of Dk units, resulting in Gk × Dk hidden
units. The layer hM is consist of 1 group andDM units. wk is the symmetric interaction term connecting
corresponding groups between data hk−1 and feature hk. However, comparing with RBM, the weights
of CRBM between the hidden and visible groups are shared among all locations (Lee et al., 2009a), and
the calculation is operated in a convolutional manner (Desjardins and Bengio, 2008).

We define the energy of the state (hk−1,hk) as:

E

where θ = (w,b, c) are the model parameters: wkst is a filter between unit s in the layer hk−1 and unit t
in the layer hk, k = M + 1, ..., N . The dimension of the filter wkst is equal to Dk−1 −Dk + 1. bk−1s is
the sth bias of layer hk−1 and ckt is the tth bias of layer hk. A tilde above an array (w̃) denote flipping
the array, ∗ denote valid convolution, and • denote element-wise product followed by summation, i.e.,
A •B = trATB (Lee et al., 2009a).

Similar to RBM, Gibbs sampler can be performed based on the following conditional distribution.

The probability of turning on unit v in group t is a logistic function of the states of hk−1 and wkst:

2.4 Supervised learning
In HDBN, we construct the deep architecture using all labeled reviews with unlabeled reviews by in-
putting them one by one from layer h0. The deep architecture is constructed layer by layer from bottom
to top, and each time, the parameter space wk is trained by the calculated data in the k − 1th layer.

After greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning, hN (x) is the representation of x. Then we useL labeled

an optimization problem:

and the loss function is defined as

T (r) = exp(−r) (13)
We use gradient-descent through the whole HDBN to refine the weight space. In the supervised

learning stage, the stochastic activities are replaced by deterministic, real valued probabilities.

2.5 Classification using HDBN
The training procedure of HDBN is given in Algorithm 1. For the training of HDBN architecture, the
parameters are random initialized with normal distribution. All the reviews in the dataset are used to
train the HDBN with unsupervised learning. After training, we can determine the label of the new data
through:

3 Experiments

3.1 Experimental setup
We evaluate the performance of the proposed HDBN method using five sentiment classification datasets.
The first dataset is MOV (Pang et al., 2002), which is a classical movie review dataset. The other four
datasets contain products reviews come from the multi-domain sentiment classification corpus, including
books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT) (Blitzer et al., 2007). Each
dataset contains 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative reviews.

The experimental setup is same as (Zhou et al., 2010). We divide the 2,000 reviews into ten equal-
sized folds randomly, maintaining balanced class distributions in each fold. Half of the reviews in each
fold are random selected as training data and the remaining reviews are used for test. Only the reviews
in the training data set are used for the selection of labeled reviews by active learning. All the algorithms
are tested with cross-validation.

We compare the classification performance of HDBN with four representative semi-supervised learn-
ing methods, i.e., semi-supervised spectral learning (Spectral) (Kamvar et al., 2003), transductive SVM
(TSVM) (Collobert et al., 2006), deep belief networks (DBN) (Hinton et al., 2006), and person-
al/impersonal views (PIV) (Li et al., 2010). Spectral learning, TSVM methods are two baseline methods
for sentiment classification. DBN (Hinton et al., 2006) is the classical deep learning method proposed
recently. PIV (Li et al., 2010) is a new sentiment classification method proposed recently.

3.2 Performance of HDBN

The HDBN architecture used in all our experiments have 2 normal hidden layer and 1 convolutional
hidden layer, every hidden layer has different number of units for different sentiment datasets. The deep
structure used in our experiments for different datasets can be seen in Table 1. For example, the HDBN
structure used in MOV dataset experiment is 100-100-4-2, which represents the number of units in 2
normal hidden layers are 100, 100 respectively, and in output layer is 2, the number of groups in 1
convolutional hidden layer is 4. The number of unit in input layer is the same as the dimensions of each
datasets. For greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning, we train the weights of each layer independently
with the fixed number of epochs equal to 30 and the learning rate is set to 0.1. The initial momentum
is 0.5 and after 5 epochs, the momentum is set to 0.9. For supervised learning, we run 30 epochs, three
times of linear searches are performed in each epoch.

The test accuracies in cross validation for five datasets and five methods with semi-supervised learning
are shown in Table 2. The results of previous two methods are reported by (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009).
The results of DBN method are reported by (Zhou et al., 2010). Li et al. (Li et al., 2010) reported the
results of PIV method. The result of PIV on MOV dataset is empty, because (Li et al., 2010) did not
report it. HDBN is the proposed method.

Through Table 2, we can see that HDBN gets most of the best results except on KIT dataset, which is
just slight worse than PIV method. However, the preprocess of PIV method is much more complicated
than HDBN, and the PIV results on other datasets are much worse than HDBN method. HDBN method
is adjusted by DBN, all the experiment results on five datasets for HDBN are better than DBN. This
could be contributed by the convolutional computation in HDBN structure, and proves the effectiveness
of our proposed method.

3.3 Performance with variance of unlabeled data

To verify the contribution of unlabeled reviews for our proposed method, we did several experiments
with fewer unlabeled reviews and 100 labeled reviews.

The test accuracies of HDBN with different number of unlabeled reviews and 100 labeled reviews
on five datasets are shown in Fig. 3. The architectures for HDBN used in this experiment are same
as Section 3.2 too, which can be seen in Table 1. We can see that the performance of HDBN is much
worse when just using 400 unlabeled reviews. However, when using more than 1200 unlabeled reviews,
the performance of HDBN is improved obviously. For most of review datasets, the accuracy of HDBN
with 1200 unlabeled reviews is close to the accuracy with 1600 and 2000 unlabeled reviews. This proves
that HDBN can get competitive performance with just few labeled reviews and appropriate number of

accuracy improved for HDBN method, we suggest using appropriate number of unlabeled reviews in real
application.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method, HDBN, to address the sentiment clas-
sification problem with a small number of labeled reviews. HDBN seamlessly incorporate convolutional
computation into the DBN architecture, and use CRBM to abstract the review information effectively.
To the best of our knowledge, HDBN is the first work that uses convolutional neural network to improve
sentiment classification performance. One promising property of HDBN is that it can effectively use the
distribution of large amount of unlabeled data, together with few label information in a unified frame-
work. In particular, HDBN can greatly reduce the dimension of reviews through RBM and abstract the
information of reviews through the cooperate of RBM and CRBM. Experiments conducted on five senti-
ment datasets demonstrate that HDBN outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms,
such as SVM and DBN based methods, using just few labeled reviews, which demonstrate the effective
of deep architecture for sentiment classification.
