Abstract

We present a discourse annotation study, in
which an annotation method based on Ques-
tions under Discussion (QuD) is applied to
Italian data. The results of our inter-annotator
agreement analysis show that the QUD-based
approach, originally spelled out for English
and German, can successfully be transferred
cross-linguistically, supporting good agree-
ment for the annotation of central infor-
mation structure notions such as focus and
non-at-issueness. Our annotation and inter-
annotator agreement study on Italian authentic
data confirms the cross-linguistic applicability
of the QuD-based approach.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we present a discourse annotation
study of Italian data, which uses the annotation
scheme and discourse-analytic method, the QUD-
tree framework, developed in ?, ? and ?. Its pur-
pose is the cross-linguistic analysis of information
structure and discourse structure of textual data.
On the theoretical side, the QUD framework has
been applied to a number of different languages,
such as German, English and French in (?), and
various Austronesian languages as discussed in ?
and ?. On the applied side, ? showed that the QUD
based method supports the successful annotation
of discourse structure and information structure in
German and English spoken language data. Here
we want to broaden the crosslinguistic scope of the
QUD framework and apply it to another Romance
language, Italian. We will explore both the QUD
annotation and the information structure annota-
tion including all information structure labels that
are part of the annotation scheme proposed in ?,
such as focus, background, contrastive topic, nai
and topic. Topic is regarded as a notoriously diffi-
cult label in agreement studies (cf. ??). While the
results of our study show that the question-based

annotation method supports the successful anno-
tation of discourse structure and of information
structure, in particular focus, we will also discuss,
using the example of topic, some shortcomings of
the QUD based annotation method.

2 The QUD framework

The QUD framwork introduced in ? presents an
explicit method for the reconstruction of QUDs
which are usually only discussed as an abstract
theoretical term. The center of the QUD frame-
work is a compact representation format for QUD
trees, in which the textual assertions (A) repre-
sent the terminal nodes of a discourse tree (pre-
serving the linear order of the text from left to
right) while (implicit or explicit) QUDs (Q) form
the non-terminal nodes. An abstract QUD tree is
shown in Figure 1.

The QUD-tree framework as spelled out in ?
can be applied to any kind of written or spoken dis-
course or conversation. It is not language-specific
and can, in principle, be used in order to investi-
gate data from any language. While the exact anal-
ysis procedure is described at great length within
the guidelines document (?), we just briefly intro-
duce some basic principles here.

2.1 Segmentation

Raw texts are segmented into atomic assertions.
Apart from orthographic sentence boundaries,
segmentation also applies at (1) (information-
structurally relevant) coordinations and (2) before
(optional) syntactic adjuncts. (Obligatory) senten-
tial arguments (3) are not split off.

2.2 QUD principles

The actual identification of a QUD for each asser-
tion is guided by a number of explicit principles
adapted from the formal literature on information
structure (????), cf. ?:

Q-A-CONGRUENCE: QUDs must be answer-
able by the assertion(s) that they immediately
dominate.

Q-GIVENNESS: Implicit QUDs can only consist
of given (or, at least, highly salient) material.

MAXIMIZE-Q-ANAPHORICITY: Implicit
QUDs should contain as much given (or salient)
material as possible.

Example (4) shows that from these principles
we can derive QUD Q32 for assertion A32 in the
context of A31, whereas any of the questions in
(5), used in place of Q32, would violate at least
one of the QUD constraints in the same context.

b. {What about the specific context?}
(#Q-GIVENNESS)

c. {What happens next?}
(#MAXIMIZE-Q-ANAPHORICITY)

Two or more assertions are defined as parallel
if and only if they share some semantically iden-
tical content and represent partial answers to the
same QUD, see Example (6), where the semanti-
cally shared content is Alek (omitted in the second
assertion).

PARALLELISM: The background of a QUD with
two or more parallel answers consists of the (se-
mantically) common material of the answers.

ality in Alek?}

3 QUDs and information structure

The basis of our annotation approach is an
alternative-based definition of information struc-
tural categories, in line with e.g. ?, ?, ?, ? or ?.
The Table in 1 shows the definitions for the in-
formation structure categories as introduced in ?.
These are the basis for the labels used in our anno-
tation study.

’I recently started to read the novels of coming-

(7) is an example demonstrating the assignment
of information-structure labels in the context of a
QUD (in curly brackets). Note that the indenta-
tion (>) of A7 in the textual representation marks
subordination in the discourse tree, as shown in
Figure 2. The focus is i romanzi di formazione
‘coming-of-age novels’, which is labelled [ ]F and
constitutes the answer to the QUD Q7. The back-
ground is linguistic content that is mentioned in
this QUD. The question is about what books the
interviewee reads or likes to read, so ho ripreso
a leggere ‘I’ve restarted to read’ (labelled [ ]BG)
is clearly recoverable from the QUD. Focus and
background together form the focus domain, la-
belled [ ]∼. The sentence initial phrase Di re-
cente ‘recently’ is not relevant to answer the QUD
Q7, which would still receive an answer without it,
therefore it is labelled [ ]NAI.

An example of the label Topic T is given in (8).

In A32, the clause initial phrase Senza etichette,
the novel’s title, is part of the background (in fact,
it is the only background in that utterance) because
it is mentioned in Q32. Since it is a referential ex-
pression, it is marked [ ]T.

In (9), an example of a contrastive topic (CT) is
given.

The (explicit) question Q10 asks the interviewee
to tell three wishes. The speaker answers by utter-
ing three different assertions each about one wish.
Clearly, il primo ‘the first (wish)’ in A10.1 and il
secondo ‘the second (wish)’ in A10.2 are mem-
bers of the alternative set mentioned in Q10 (tre
desideri ‘three wishes’).

4 Evaluation: Discourse structure

In the present annotation study based on the above
described QUD framework, our goal is to show
that the discourse annotation in terms of QUDs can
be applied reliably to naturally occurring data - in
this particular case, Italian data. We conducted an
empirical study, in which annotators followed the
QUD guidelines described in ? to annotate two
Italian blog interviews.

For the QUD-based annotation we use the tool
TreeAnno introduced by ?, which enables the ana-
lyst to semi-automatically segment texts, system-



116

atically enhance them with implicit Questions un-
der Discussion (QUDs), and transform the data
into a discourse tree called QUD tree, as described
in ?.

4.1 Evaluation setup

Two trained annotators (and also native speakers
of Italian) analyzed and annotated two short Ital-
ian blog interviews downloaded from the internet
1. The first blog interview consists of 95 text seg-
ments, the second one of 113 segments. The QUD
discourse tree for Blog 1 resulting from the first
annotator is shown in Figure 3, the other three dis-
course trees are included in the Appendix.

4.2 Method and results

For the comparison of the two annotated doc-
uments, we follow the method described in ?.
The basic idea is that for the comparison of two
QUD annotations one needs to calculate an inter-
annotator agreement score that takes into account,
for every segment and every possible span of seg-
ments, whether a QUD is present or not. In order
to compute a κ statistics (?) based on our QUD
annotations, ? propose to follow the method de-
scribed in ?, which was developed for measuring
agreement in the labelling of rhetorical structure
categories in texts. The method is based on the
idea of mapping the hierarchical structure of a dis-
course tree onto sets of units (i.e. text segments)
that are a matrix or chart filled with categorical
values. In our case, the values are whether there
exists a (Q)uestion spanning the respective seg-
ments – start to end – or (n)ot).

A κ statistics can then be computed between
two charts that represent two different QUD anno-
tations for the same text, more precisely between
the two resulting sets of possible spans of seg-
ments.2 For our two annotated documents we cal-
culated κ values for the annotation charts derived
from our QUD annotations, based on the above de-
scribed method. For the text Italian Blog 1, con-
sisting of 95 segments, we calculated the κ statis-
tics based on 4,256 items (i.e. possible spans of
segments), for Italian Blog 2 with 113 segments
based on 6,187 items. The results are shown in
Table 2.

number of possible text spans is n×(n+1)

Text Segments Spans κ
Italian Blog 1 95 4,256 .61
Italian Blog 2 113 6,187 .51

Table 2: Kappa values for QUD-annotated Italian dia-
logues

The values show moderate agreement between
the annotator pairs. For Blog 1, the κ value is at
.61, which is substantially higher than what (?) re-
port for the QUD annotations of their German and
English texts: their κ values are around .5. For our
Blog 2, the κ value is at .51, which is thus very
similar to the scores reported in (?) for texts of
similar length. Our two annotated Italian texts are
relatively short, only around 100 sentences each,
so it is perhaps too early to interpret the results, in
particular since this is a rather complex task. How-
ever, since the results are comparable to those re-
ported in (?), we take this as a further proof that
the QUD-based annotation of discourse can suc-
cessfully be applied cross-linguistically.

5 Evaluation: Information structure

The second major issue we are interested in is
to evaluate the reliability of information-structure
annotation based on the previous identification of
QUDs.

5.1 Evaluation setup

For the evaluation of the information structural an-
notation, the same two Italian blog texts were an-
notated by the same two trained annotators, who
still followed the guidelines of Riester et al. 2018).
We aimed at annotating all five categories that are
mentioned in ?: focus (F), background (BG), non-
at-issue material (NAI), contrastive topic (CT) and
topic (T). Focus domain labels (∼) were not anno-
tated, since each text segment (assertion) already
corresponds to one focus domain. The annota-
tors based their annotations on the previously per-
formed QUD analysis in the TreeAnno tool. As an
annotation tool for the token-based information-
structure annotation, WebAnno (?) was chosen.
Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the information-
structure annotation of the beginning of Blog 1.

5.2 Method and results

As agreement measure for the evaluation of the
information structure annotation, we calculated κ
values on the annotated texts based on tokens,

Figure 4: Annotation in WebAnno

following previous work (???). In addition to
the specifications in ?, in particular the QUD-to-
information-structure mapping from Table 1, we
defined a number of heuristic (but potentially de-
batable) rules in order to prevent disagreement due
to theoretically unclear issues, such as:

• Discourse connectors (but, and, although, be-
cause, therefore etc.) at the beginning of dis-
course segments are not annotated.

• Punctuation: Quotation marks around an ex-
pression, commas within and at the right edge
of an expression are part of the markable. Pe-
riods, colons, semicolons, exclamation marks
are not.

Results are shown in Table 3, divided into
scores for all labels taken together, and individual
scores for each of the four labels.

The results are rather heterogeneous in both
texts but overall they show that the QUD-based
method does contribute to a successful annotation
of information structure in Italian for a range of
labels. For the first text Blog 1, the overall agree-
ment score for all annotated categories taken to-
gether is at .7, which shows substantial agreement,

The agreements scores for the second blog are
overall lower, but with .58 for the overall agree-
ment and .51 with agreement for focus they are
still at a relatively high level and still compara-
ble to the scores that (?) report for the annota-
tion of German and English data (which are at
around .65). The category NAI, the classification
of non-at-issue material, also received reasonable
agreement scores at .53 in Blog 1 and .62 for Blog
2. The agreement scores for the other three cat-
egories, BG and CT, differ a lot between the two
texts. In Blog 1, the score for contrastive topic is
very high with .85, in Blog 2 the score .1 shows
that there was hardly any agreement between the
two annotators. This might be due to the fact that
there were only very few cases for which the label
CT was used. In Blog 1, the label CT was used for
9 and 12 tokens in the two annotations, in Blog 2
it was assigned to 13 and 14 tokens (out of 1243
tokens). The case is similar with respect to back-
ground: in the two annotated documents, the la-
bel BG was only assigned for around 40 tokens
in Blog 1 and 30 tokens in Blog 2. This means
that, if the annotators disagreed in only one to-
ken when assigning the label CT or BG, this had
a much greater impact on the agreement scores for
these labels than in the cases of disagreement for



118

assigning focus labels. The category topic (T) re-
ceived relatively low agreement scores at .45 and
.35, but still at a level which other studies report
for categories like focus (cf. ? report a κ of .44 for
focus). In the following section we will qualita-
tively evaluate why the annotation scheme seems
to better support the successful annotation of a cat-
egory like focus, whereas there seems to be much
more disagreement when annotating topic.

6 Qualitative Evaluation: The Case of
Topics

In the question-based definitions of our informa-
tion structure labels, the focus corresponds to
those parts of an assertion that answer the current
QUD. Especially in case of overt questions, but
with implicit QUDs, the annotators agree on fo-
cus.

The definition of topic in the QUD framework,
however, is the only one that does not take the cur-
rent QUD into account. As remarked by ?, while
potentially all referential expressions inside the
background could be labelled as topic, one might
argue that not all referential expressions inside the
background are actually aboutness topics. But un-
fortunately, the QUD method is not meant to sin-
gle out the best topic candidate. And ? do not
provide any rules that help to distinguish between
better and worse topic candidates. The only cue
that is given through the current QUD is that all
focal expressions are excluded as topic candidates.

A typical topic expression in Italian would be
a clitic left or right dislocated phrase (see quel li-
bro below), but no dislocation was present in our
data, probably due to the fact that a blog inter-
view is less interactive than an spoken conversa-
tion, and these construction are typically used in
interaction.

Clitic personal pronouns, such as le in A2 in
(11), are also typical candidates for (continuing)
topics.

(11) A1: Abbiamo fatto quattro chiacchiere con Maria Ver-
diana Rigoglioso per parlare di Senza Etichette, il
romanzo che ha pubblicato con Libromania.
’We had a chat with Maria Verdiana Rigoglioso to
talk about Senza Etichette, the novel she published

novel
’to get to know the background and trivia of the
novel.’

What about cases where the topic is neither a dis-
located expression, nor a clitic? Our annotation
method should be able to single out such cases, but
this is not always true. The example above nicely
illustrates a case where our annotators disagreed
about labelling a given referential expression as
topic: the PP del romanzo in A3, which is already
introduced in the previous sentence, A1. One an-
notator chose to nevertheless include it in the focus
and label A3 as an all-focus assertion. The other
annotator, while annotating a similar QUD, chose
to label the PP as a topic. Indeed, strictly speak-
ing, this given PP should then also be part of the
QUD (”What for, with respect to the novel?”).

(12) Q3: What for with respect to the novel?
> A3:[per

to
[conoscere
know

retroscena
ins-and-outs

e
and

curiosità]F
trivia

[del

romanzo]T] .
novel

It may be observed that the PP del romanzo is em-
bedded inside the verb’s direct object NP. Our as-
sumption is that informational categories are de-
fined and identified solely by pragmatic means, in
particular by the QUD-related properties given in
Table 1. Despite such an assumption, we may sup-
pose that it was the syntactically embedded posi-
tion of del romanzo that led one annotator to con-
sider it as part of the focus, or more precisely, the
fact that the focus (retroscena e curiosità) did not
form a constituent on its own without the PP del
romanzo. The relationship between the given-new
structure and the syntactic structure has not been
discussed by ?, but it is something that might be
worth addressing in the future. Of course, if the
syntactic position of the topic must be invoked to
complete the picture and arrive at its identification,
then we expect different levels of complexity in
the task of annotating aboutness topics depending
on the language.

In other cases, the topic was well identified by
both annotators, such as le due lingue in (13).

’and speak the two languages in a perfect and
equivalent way.’

In this example syntax does not help to identify
the topic status of the direct object le due lingue.
Such expression is mentioned in A1 as part of the
focus, but instead of being promoted to topic in
the subsequent utterance by some syntactic device
for topic shift (such as left dislocation, cf. ?), it
is left in situ. One reason for the speaker’s choice
may be the fact that the topic expression is inside
a free relative, a construction that seems to be in-
compatible with dislocations, as the unacceptabil-
ity of examples below shows:

(14)a. ??Chi

well

Since due lingue is mentioned in the previous
sentence, the context tells us that this expression
is clearly background. Since it’s a referential ex-
pression, it has all that is required to be identified
as topic. Note that a clitic pronoun might have
been acceptable here (see example (15)), but this
option is not chosen by the speaker/writer.

The mechanism of identifying parallel struc-

a strategy that our annotation tool provides to help
recognizing ’hidden’ topics.

’and not as a performance to be measured.’

Clearly, the fact that le lingue (which again oc-
cupies a canonical post-verbal position in A55′) is
elided in A55′′ , shows that it represents shared ma-
terial between A55′ and A55′′ , and therefore is part
of the background.

Cases of topic shift were easily recognized by
the two annotators. One example is given be-
low in (17). The referent la mamma che parla
la lingua minoritaria per crescere i suoi bambini
bilingui is introduced in the overt question Q24.1
and then it continues as topic in the answer A24.1.
Then the topic changes and becomes i bambini in
A25. In A26, the topic changes back to la mamma
madrelingua.

The fact that the topic is a preverbal subject also
helped the annotators to recognize it. As dis-
cussed in (?), preverbal subjects are typical sen-
tence topics, and our two annotators agreed more
often when the topic was in that position. The so-
called hidden topics were more challenging.

And even if an expression was correctly in-
cluded within the background, the two annotators
still had to decide for every referential item that
was part of the background whether to label it as
a topic or not. Not surprisingly, they sometimes
agreed, as in (13), and they sometimes picked dif-
ferent elements. Since there are several character-
istics of the text and the preceding discourse that
have to be taken into account for the identification
of possible topics, we hypothesise that this cate-
gory will probably always be annotated with less
accuracy than the other information structure cat-
egories such as focus or non-at-issue material.

7 Conclusion

We have presented a novel method for the annota-
tion of information structure which achieves good
inter-annotator scores. In particular the agree-
ment scores for focus are much higher than the
results reported in other similar annotation studies
on naturally occurring data (cf. ?). The method is
based on the reconstruction of QUDs, from which
the annotation of IS categories is then derived.
The results of our inter-annotator agreement anal-
ysis show that the QUD-based approach, origi-
nally spelled out for English and German, can suc-
cessfully be transferred cross-linguistically, sup-
porting good agreement for the annotation of cen-
tral information structure notions such as focus
and non-at-issueness, with (contrastive) topic and
background showing lower levels of agreement for
some texts due to underrepresentation of those in-
formation structural categories in some of the data
analysed. Thanks to the QUD-based method, at-
tention was drawn to some interesting aspects of
Italian information structure, and in particular of

Italian topics. Some difficulties of topic identifica-
tion were shown to be reduced by the adopted an-
notation procedure. We believe that the discussion
of the problems occurring with the labelling of
topics in Italian not only contributes to the analysis
of topics in Romance languages, but also helps to
refine the QUD annotation procedure in general,
so that future annotators are more aware of prob-
lematic cases which will hopefully lead to even
more reliable annotations.
