Abstract

In this paper we present a data visualization method together with its potential usefulness in
digital humanities and philosophy of language. We compile a multilingual parallel corpus from
different versions of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, including the original in
German and translations into English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Using this corpus, we
compute a similarity measure between propositions and render a visual network of relations for
different languages.

1 Introduction

Data visualization techniques can be essential tools for researchers and scholars in the humanities. In
our work, we propose one such method that renders concepts and phrases as a network of semantic rela-
tions. In particular, we focus on a corpus built from different translations of the Logisch-Philosophische
Abhandlung (Wittgenstein, 1921) from German into English, French, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.

Wittgenstein in his later works states that meaning is use (Wittgenstein, 1953): 43. For a large class of
cases –though not for all– in which we employ the word ”meaning” it can be defined thus: the meaning
of a word is its use in the language game. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing
to its bearer.

This idea anticipated and influenced later research in semantics, including the distributional hypothesis
(Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957) and more recently, work in computational linguistics (Lenci, 2008). Distri-
butional semantics works on this very principle, by making use of data to build semantic structures from
the contexts of the words. Word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) are one such example of semantic
representation in a vector space constructed based on the context in which words occur. In our case,
we extract a dictionary of concepts by parsing the English sentences and we infer the semantic relations
between the concepts based on the contexts in which the words appear, thus we construct a semantic
network by drawing edges between concepts.

Furthermore, we generalize on this idea to create a visual network of relations between the phrases in
which the concepts occur. We have used the multilingual parallel corpora available and created networks
both for the original and the translated versions. We believe this can be helpful to investigate not only
the translation from German into other languages, but also how translations into English influence trans-
lations into Russian, French or Spanish. For example, certain idioms and syntactic structures are clearly
missing in the original German text, but are visible in both the English and Spanish versions.

2 Dataset

The general structure of the text has a tree-like shape, the root is divided into 7 propositions, and each
proposition has its own subdivisions and so on and so forth, in total numbering 526 propositions. A
proposition is the structuring unit from the text and not necessarily propositions in a strict linguistic
sense. Our corpus contains the original German version of the text (Wittgenstein, 1921) together with
translations into 5 different languages: English, Italian, French, Russian, and Spanish. For English, we

have two translations variants, one by Ogden and Ramsey (1922) revised by Wittgenstein himself and
another one by Pears and McGuinness (1961).

Since the text has a fixed form structure, it is straight forward to align each translation at the propo-
sition level. In addition, we also employ a word-alignment method to create a multilingual parallel
word-aligned corpus and to be able to inspect how certain concepts are translated into different lan-
guages. The exact size of each version in the corpus1 is detailed in Table 1. Our corpus contains a
relatively small number (526) of aligned examples and alignment methods often fail to find the correct
pairs between words. To create the word-alignment pairs, we have experimented with different alignment
strategies including GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), fast align (Dyer et al., 2013) and efmaral (Östling
and Tiedemann, 2016), while the later proved to output the best results in terms of our manual evaluation.

Table 1: The size of each corpus in the dataset

The two translations into English share a lot in common, however they are not equivalent, for exam-
ple, the German concept Sachverhaltes is translated by Ogden and Ramsey (1922) as atomic facts and
in Pears and McGuinness (1961)’s version the same concept is translated as states of affairs. As for
the other languages, the Spanish and Russian translations resemble more the former English version,
Sachverhaltes being translated as hechos atomicos and атомарного факта (atomarnogo fakta), respec-
tively. In French and Italian, the concept is translated as états des choses and stati di cosi following the
Pears and McGuinness (1961) English translation.

3 Wittgenstein’s Network

3.1 Tractatus Network

The Tractatus Network2 is obtained from different versions of the text by computing a pair-wise similarity
measure between propositions. Each proposition is tokenized and each token is stemmed or lemmatized.
The lemmatizer is available only for English by querying WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), for the remaining
languages different Snowball stemmers are available in NLTK (Bird et al., 2009). Stop words from each
proposition are removed before computing the following similarity score:

Similarity(p1, p2) =
|p1 ∩ p2|

max(|p1|, |p2|) (1)

The similarity score computes the number of common tokens between two propositions normalized
by the length of the longest proposition, to avoid bias for inputs of different lengths. Two propositions
are connected by an edge if their similarity exceeds the 0.3f threshold. To render the network, we use
a browser-based drawing library3, the lengths of the edges are determined by the similarity value and
the nodes representing propositions are colored based on the parent proposition (labeled from 1 to 7).
Furthermore, we added a character n-grams search4 capability for the network that highlights the node
with the highest similarity to the search string.

Figure 1: Two excerpts from the Tractatus Network. From left to right we have the German original,
the translations into English by Pears and McGuinness (1961) in the center, and the Ogden and Ramsey
(1922) translation on the right. Propositions from different groups may resemble each other more than
the propositions within the same group.

By analyzing the resulted networks, we can observe that the seven main propositions in the text includ-
ing the sub-divisions are not necessarily hierarchical, at leas not based on the topics addressed, rather
the Tractatus has a rhizomatic structure in which the propositions are entangled and repeatedly make
use of similar concepts. The excerpts rendered in Figure 1 and Figure 2 bring further evidence to this
observation, as an example the proposition die gesamte Wirklichkeit ist die Welt meaning the total reality
is the world appears in almost every version close to the propositions in group one in which die Welt /
the world plays a central role. In Figure 1, the Pears and McGuinness (1961) English translation has a
smaller number of relations between propositions, compared to the German counterpart on the left, and
it also has an additional proposition from group two: 2.0212 In that case we could not sketch any picture
of the world (true or false). However, in terms of topology, the Ogden and Ramsey (1922) translation
resembles almost identically the German version.

Figure 2: From left to right: Italian, Spanish, French, and Russian excerpts showing the neighbors of
proposition 1. Italian and Spanish parts have identical nodes. The French and Russian topologies do not
resemble the original or any other network.

On the one hand, looking at the remaining translations, we can observe the Italian and Spanish excerpts
share the same nodes and comparable topologies with the original German version. On the other hand,
by looking at the word aligned pairs and the translation of Sachverhaltes in particular, we may be able
trace two separate influences for Spanish and Italian that stem from the different English versions of the
Tractatus. Last but not least, the French and Russian parts reveal some particularities that cannot be
traced to any other topology from the corpus.

It is well known that Wittgenstein did not write the propositions in the order they appear in the text and
our results further evidence this fact by revealing specific clusters of similarity between propositions that
do not belong to the same group. However, some groups of propositions do appear to be more compact
than others, e.g. groups 4 and 2 usually have a more compact structure regardless of the language.

3.2 Concept Network

The Concept Network5 is created from the main concepts/keywords extracted from each proposition in
the corpus. For this part, we use only the Ogden and Ramsey (1922) translation into English, each
proposition is split into sentences and the parse trees are extracted using the approach of Honnibal and
Johnson (2015).

Figure 3: Excerpt from the concept network. The colors indicate the first group proposition in which the
concepts appear (from 1 to 7).

The concept list consists of the noun-phrases extracted from the parse trees together with a few per-
sonal pronouns that appear in the corpus. We manually pruned the occurrences having low frequencies
and the ones that have been wrongly annotated by the parser. The edges between the nodes (concepts) are
created based on the number of times a concept appears in at least two propositions in the same context
window, where the window varies depending on how many tokens a concept has. Multi word units are
allowed to appear in windows of up to ten words, while single token concepts are limited to a maximum
window of three words.

An excerpt from the network is rendered in (Figure 3). We noticed that concepts with a high number
of edges usually occupy a central position in Wittgenstein’s philosophy. Words such as: elementary
proposition, proposition, world, fact, form, we, logic, picture, reveal relations that span across multiple
propositions in the text.

4 Conclusions

We provide two resources which we believe to be important for scholars and researchers in digital hu-
manities. The first resource is a compiled, word-aligned corpus extracted from the original and translated
versions of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. This corpus may be used to study the original
text or to extract meaningful comparisons from translations into other languages. The second resource is
a web application that renders semantic networks of concepts and propositions from the Tractatus. These
could be useful to visualize the semantic similarities between concepts and to examine the relations be-
tween different propositions, to clarify certain concepts and to search and explore the actual text, either
in German or in translation. To summarize, therefore, we hope to provide another method of reading
Wittgenstein’s work.
