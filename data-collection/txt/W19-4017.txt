Abstract

This paper investigates the use of explic-
itly signalled discourse relations in persuasive
texts. We present a corpus study where we
control for speaker and topic and show that the
distribution of different discourse connectives
varies considerably across different discourse
settings. While this variation can be explained
by genre differences, we also observe varia-
tion regarding the distribution of discourse re-
lations across different settings. This variation
cannot be explained by genre differences. We
argue that the differences regarding the use of
discourse relations reflects different strategies
of persuasion and that these might be due to
audience design.

1 Introduction

This contribution studies the use of discourse con-
nectives in persuasive texts that have been pro-
duced in different communicative settings. Dis-
course connectives are highly ambiguous and
polyfunctional and can vary across different di-
mensions, depending on the medium (spoken vs.
written), the discourse situation (monologic vs.
dialogic, formal vs. informal), the purpose of
communication (informative vs. persuasive), and
more. As we are most interested in investigating
different strategies of persuasion, we focus on ex-
plicit markers of concessive and contrastive dis-
course relations, used by the speaker to provide
a convincing argument that might persuade the
hearer.

Work on discourse analysis and argumentation
mining has highlighted the important role of dis-
course connectives for analysing argumentation
structure (Felder, 2015; Stab and Gurevych, 2014;
Eckle-Kohler et al., 2015). In addition, psycholin-
guistic studies have shown that explicit coherence
marking not only improves sentence comprehen-
sion but also results in a more positive evalua-

tion of the text by the reader (Kamalski et al.,
2006). This suggests that discourse connectives
might play an important role in persuasion strate-
gies.

We take this hypothesis as our starting point and
investigate how different dimensions of variation
in persuasive texts can impact the linguistic be-
haviour of an individual speaker. To that end, we
present a corpus study where we try to keep as
many variables fixed and only vary the situational
setting in which the texts were produced. We con-
trol for speaker, topic and function (i.e. persuasive
texts) but vary the situational setting of text pro-
duction.

The data we use in our analysis are political
articles, interviews and talks produced by Noam
Chomsky. Our data covers spoken and written
texts and ranges from highly edited to less edited,
including monologic as well as dialogic data.

The variation of discourse settings in our data is
accompanied by changes regarding the audience in
the different discourse situations. For interviews,
the audience is rather small, often on a one-on-one
basis, but the hearers have the means to interact
with the speaker. This is different from the situa-
tion for public talks where we usually have a much
larger audience that can be directly addressed by
the speaker but has limited possibilities to interact
with her. In the last setting, the speaker (or rather:
the writer) has the least control and no reliable in-
formation about his or her recipients. To account
for this variation, we propose the use of the audi-
ence design model (Bell, 1984) (see §2.1).

In the paper, we first look at the use of discourse
connectives along two dimensions of variation and
show that there are systematic differences regard-
ing the frequency of different forms of discourse
connectives (§4). Next, we show that the differ-
ences in the distribution of discourse connectives
also reflect differences regarding the distribution



145

of discourse relations in the different situational
settings (§5). Finally, we discuss whether the dif-
ferent distribution of discourse relations in each
setting reflects different strategies used to pursue a
communicative purpose (§6), and how these might
relate to audience design.

2 Background

2.1 Discourse connectives in argumentative
and persuasive text

In this work, we focus on the use of explicitly
marked discourse relations in persuasive text. In
particular, we investigate how different dimen-
sions of variation impact a speaker’s linguistic be-
haviour during the production of argumentative
texts. The approach we take is a comparative study
of discourse connectives in persuasive texts pro-
duced by the same speaker, but in different dis-
course situations.

Our investigation takes the following two ob-
servations as its starting point. First, it has been
shown that the use of discourse connectives and
the distribution of explicit and implicit discourse
relations is genre-dependent (see, e.g., Webber
(2009) for written genres or Rehbein et al. (2016)
for spoken texts).1 Second, Eckle-Kohler et al.
(2015) show that certain discourse connectives
are highly predictive features for distinguishing
claims and premises in argumentative texts.2 This
suggests that discourse connectives play a crucial
role as strategic devices for persuasion. We follow
O’Keefe (1990) and define persuasion as “a suc-
cessful intentional effort at influencing another’s
mental state through communication in a circum-
stance in which the persuadee has some measure
of freedom”(O’Keefe, 1990, p.5).

We distinguish persuasive from merely argu-
mentative texts that rely on the neutral presenta-
tion of a complete set of claims and premises and
weigh these against each other. In contrast, per-
suasive texts use additional rhetorical means to
achieve their communicatve goal, such as rhetor-

1Due to space considerations, we refrain from including a
discussion on the definition of register, genre and text type as
there is a lack of agreement on the definition of those terms.
In the paper, we try to avoid those terms and instead use the
term discourse setting to refer to the different situational set-
tings of text production.

2The authors, however, do not extend their study to dis-
course relations but, lacking DR annotations, only look at
the word forms of discourse connectives. This is not optimal
as most connectives are highly ambiguous and can express a
number of different discourse relations.

ical questions, emotional and sentiment-loaded
language, a high ratio of imagery, repetition, hy-
perbole, and more. In addition, presentational
choices are made that select or focus on certain
aspects of a topic or discourse entity, in order to
validate the speaker’s point of view and to support
her communicative goals. This is often refered to
as framing (Entman, 1993).

Stab and Gurevych (2014) look at argumenta-
tive texts and try to automatically identify claims
and premises. They find that discourse connec-
tives are often indicative of certain argument com-
ponents. Tan et al. (2016) investigate persuasion
strategies in online discussion forums. They also
try to identify argument structure based on dis-
course connectives and report negative results for
this approach, probably due to data sparseness.
Felder (2015) shows how concessive and con-
trastive discourse connectives can be used to iden-
tify the central points of conflict in an argument,
based on the selection or foregrounding of spe-
cific subtopics that are used to frame the discourse.
A certain topic can, for example, be discussed
against the background of moral or economic ar-
guments, and thus appeal to different groups of
people with differing political views (also see the
work of Card et al. (2015, 2016) on media frames).
In his work, Felder uses discourse connectives as
signals for identifying conflicting framing strate-
gies but does not investigate their strategic func-
tion in the discourse.

Kamalski et al. (2006) present two psycholin-
guistic experiments showing that the use of dis-
course connectives not only has a positive effect
on the hearer’s comprehension facility but also
leads to a more positive evaluation of the text.
This observation suggests that discourse connec-
tives might be used as strategic devices in persua-
sive text.

2.2 Audience design

Work on accomodation (Giles et al., 1991) and
audience design (Bell, 1984) has shown that lan-
guage variation is not only influenced by social
variables describing the speaker (e.g. age, gen-
der, social class, etc.) but that speakers also adapt
their style depending on who is listening. Bell
investigated the speech of radio news broadcast-
ers from different channels that targeted different
audiences. He showed that the same broadcast-
ers varied their linguistic style, depending on the



146

channel. The audience design model has since
been applied to many different discourse settings.

Litt (2012) extended the model for what he
calls the “imagined audience”, accounting for
style shifts in situations where the real audience
is not known to the speaker and thus the speaker
adapts her style to a mental model of a hearer.
This is relevant for many broadcasting media, for
example for social media platforms such as fo-
rums, blogs or microtext messengers. Many stud-
ies have described and quantified effects of audi-
ence design in social media, looking at power rela-
tions, politeness and other variables of style shifts
(Bramsen et al., 2011; Gilbert, 2012; Prabhakaran
et al., 2012; niculescu mizil et al., 2012; Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013; Pavalanathan and
Eisenstein, 2015).

Applying the audience design model of Bell
(1984) to our data, we have to account for different
types of audiences. In the interview situation, the
speaker is talking to one or more adressees who
are known to the speaker and who are able to in-
teract with her. In oral talks, the audience is visi-
ble to the speaker and can be directly addressed by
her. However, the speaker usually has much less
information about the hearers, and the audience
has very limited means to actively take part in the
communication even though there still is a certain
amount of interaction through clapping, heckling
or booing. This is different from the production
situation of written articles where the text author
has no knowledge or control about future readers
of the text and thus the recipients can be consid-
ered as the “imagined audience”, a mental model
created in the mind of the author.

In the remainder of the paper, we present an an-
notation study where we apply the audience design
model to our data to see how well it can explain the
differences in the use of discourse connectives and
explicit discourse relations as strategic devices for
persuasion.

3 Data

The data we use in our annotation study are arti-
cles and talks by and interviews with Noam Chom-
sky.3 We created a corpus with 428,679 tokens
of articles, 302,672 tokens of talks and 138,866
tokens of interviews. All data has been pro-
duced in a time period between 1985 and 2016.

3We collected the data from https://chomsky.
info.

From the larger corpus, we selected a smaller sam-
ple for manual annotation with around 20,000 to-
kens per discourse setting.4 The smaller dataset
was also controlled for topic. All articles in the
sample focus on issues related to Gaza/Middle
East/Palestine and the texts were selected from a
smaller time range, covering the years from 2008
to 2014.

To take a first step towards investigating our
hypothesis that discourse connectives are used as
strategic devices for persuasion, we first explore
how different forms of discourse connectives are
used in persuasive texts by the same speaker, but
produced in different situational settings.

In the next step, we investigate whether varia-
tion with regard to discourse connective form also
reflects variation regarding the choice of discourse
relations used to persue the communicative goal,
or whether the observed variation can be explained
simply by the use of different forms of discourse
connectives that express the same discourse rela-
tion.

We argue that if we would find differences re-
garding the use of discourse relations in persua-
sive texts controlled for speaker and topic but pro-
duced in different situational settings, these differ-
ences could not be easily explained based on genre
differences but would need a situational model that
also accounts for the hearer/reader, such as the au-
dience design model.

4 Distribution of discourse connectives

We start with an exploration of the distribution
of discourse connectives in the three subcorpora.
We follow the tradition of Biber’s register anal-
ysis (Biber 1995) and perform a Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA),5 based on the frequency
of 22 causal, concessive and contrastive discourse
connective forms, to identify the main variables of
variance. The set we use includes the following
connectives: accordingly, although, because, but,
conversely, hence, however, instead, nevertheless,
nonetheless, nor, rather, since, so, still, thereby,
therefore, though, thus, whereas, while, yet. We
split the different texts in the large corpus in sam-
ples of 250 sentences each, count the frequency
for each of the forms in the different samples and

4The token counts vary slightly as we did not cut off sen-
tences but incuded all additional tokens until the end of the
sentence.

R (https://www.r-project.org).

run the PCA on the data.
The PCA, despite having no other information

but the frequency for each discourse connective,
is able to separate the interviews from the articles
along the first dimension. Figure 1 (left) shows
how most of the interviews cluster at the left end
of the dimension while the articles are positioned
at the right end. The talks show a larger vari-
ance in the use of discourse connectives, and some
talk segments show an overlap with the interviews
while in other talks the use of discourse connec-
tives is more similar to the one in the articles.

Figure 1 (right) identifies the discourse con-
nectives most typical for written articles (though,
while, thus, however) and those that are used in
the less edited, dialogic interview data (because,
so, but).

Our analysis clearly confirms what has been
shown before (Webber, 2009; Rehbein et al.,
2016), namely that the use of discourse connec-
tives is highly genre-specific. In earlier genre stud-
ies, however, the different genres represented texts
with different communicative functions, i.e. infor-
mative texts versus argumentative texts etc. There-
fore, one might assume that the differences in the
use of discourse connectives might reflect func-
tional differences.

In our study, we try to eliminate this factor. We
control for speaker and –in the smaller subcorpus–
also for topic. All texts have a clear persuasive

goal, i.e. to convince the audience from a partic-
ular political point of view. The main difference
between the texts is the communication setting in
which they were produced. This allows us to in-
vestigate the role that discourse connectives play
for strategies of persuasion, tailored towards a par-
ticular setting and audience.

Given that the texts have the same persuasive
function, we assume that the differences we ob-
served reflect differences along two dimensions
of variation that are correlated with the situa-
tional settings of text production. In a more de-
tailed analysis with more features than just the
counts for different connective forms, similar to
Biber (1995); Biber and Conrad (2009); Passon-
neau et al. (2014), we would expect to find the two
dimensions displayed in figure 2.

The first dimension distinguishes highly edited
texts from less edited ones. Here the articles are
positioned on the left end of the dimension, the
talks can be located somewhere in the middle and
the interviews as the least edited of the three text
types are positioned at the right end. The second
dimension concerns the interactional dimension of
communication and sets monological texts apart
from dialogical ones. Here, the articles can be
placed at the monological end of the scale while
the interviews are clearly dialogical and can thus
be positioned at the other end of the dimension.
The talks are mostly monological but allow for

some interaction with the audience.
These two dimensions of variation might ex-

plain the variance in the distribution of discourse
connectives in the data, as the same discourse re-
lations can be expressed via different connectives
(or can also be left implicit). We thus hypothe-
size that the differences we observe will disappear
when we look at the level of discourse relations
instead of discourse connective forms. As there is
no one-to-one correspondence between discourse
connectives and discourse relations and automatic
tools are not yet reliable enough, we need to man-
ually disambiguate the relations in the data.

5 Annotation study

We present an annotation study where we annotate
all instances of discourse connectives that can ex-
press a causal, contrastive or concessive discourse
relation. We follow the framework of PDTB3
(Webber et al., 2016), a revised version of the Penn
Discourse Treebank scheme (Prasad et al., 2008).
The question we would like to answer is: Does
the difference in distribution of discourse connec-
tives in the texts shown above reflect differences
in the distribution of discourse relations, or are the
same relations expressed by different devices that
are more adequate for a given discourse situation?

5.1 Discourse relations in argumentative text

The revised version of the PDTB comprises some
changes to the relation hierarchy. Some rela-
tions in PDTB2 that were difficult to distinguish
even for trained annotators have been merged in
PDTB3, and inconsistencies regarding the annota-
tion of the directionality of the relation have been
removed. The direction describes the order of the
arguments. In the PDTB scheme, Arg1 and Arg2

cable).

are determined by position in inter-sentential rela-
tions as well as in intra-sentential paratactic struc-
tures (e.g. coordinations). In intra-sentential sub-
ordinated structures, the subordinated clause is al-
ways labelled Arg2, regardless of its position. The
new relation hierarchy is shown in table 1.

Additionally, some relations can be marked as
either pragmatic (epistemic) (β; for implicit be-
liefs) or as speech acts (ζ).6 These features should
be understood as properties of the arguments, not
of the relations (Webber et al., 2016). The ex-
amples below illustrate the different relation types
relevant to our study. We follow the PDTB con-
ventions and mark the first argument in italics and
the second argument in boldface. The discourse
connective that signals the relation is underlined.

• Concession:
Although she was qualified, she didn’t get the job.

• Contrast:
Mary likes to read while John loves cooking.

• Cause:
The street is wet because it rained last night.

• Cause + Belief (+β):
She must be home because the light is on.

• Cause + Speechact (+ζ):
He’s in Denver because he just called me an hour ago.

5.2 Discourse connectives versus discourse
relations

We manually disambiguate all discourse connec-
tive forms in the smaller subcorpus that can ex-
press a causal, concessive or contrastive relation.
The data includes 20,000 tokens from each dis-
course setting and was controlled for topic (table
2). The annotation was done by one trained lin-
guist who had previous experience with PDTB-
style annotations. As annotation tool, we used

6For a distinction between, content, epistemic and speech
act relations, see Sweetser (1990).



149

the PDTB Annotator (Lee et al., 2016). We an-
notated all senses for instances of discourse con-
nectives from a set of 22 word forms (see section
4). This resulted in 1,614 annotated instances (ar-
ticles: 395, talks: 633, interviews: 586).

As there was only one annotator, we cannot re-
port inter-annotator agreement for this task. How-
ever, in a comparable previous study on annotat-
ing PDTB-style discourse relations on English, the
same annotator showed an IAA of 84.6% (percent-
age agreement) and a Fleiss’ κ of 0.797 (Rehbein
et al., 2016).

Table 3 shows the distribution of causal, con-
cessive and contrastive senses for the different dis-
course settings (see table 7 in the appendix for
a complete list of all senses in PDTB3 (Webber
et al., 2016)). We decided to normalise raw counts
per sentence, as discourse relations mostly operate
on the sentence or clause-level.7

The talks have the highest amount of signalled
causal and concessive discourse relations in our
corpus. The number of concessive relations, how-
ever, is smaller than in the article and interview
subcorpora. In contrast to the use of discourse
connective forms, the distribution of discourse
relations found in the data cannot be explained
with regard to the two dimensions of variation
we discussed above (monologic–dialogic and less
edited–highly edited).

However, when looking at more fine-grained
sense distinctions, also taking the PDTB level
three senses into account that encode the direction
of the relation, we make an interesting observa-
tion (table 4). We can see that the higher num-
ber of causal relations in the talks reflects a more
frequent use of RESULT-type relations while the
distribution of REASON-type relations in the three
discourse settings is fairly similar. If we look at
concessive relations, we see that the higher fre-
quency in the talks is caused only by Arg2-as-

mance error and exclude it from the analysis.

of many tactical options.

To get a different perspective, we go back to the
more coarse-grained level-2 senses but this time
also include the SPEECHACT features (ζ) (table
5). Here we can see that the crucial difference be-
tween the talks and the other two discourse set-
tings regarding the CONCESSION relation can be
traced back to the presence or absence of the ζ
feature. SPEECHACT-type relations hardly ever
occur in the articles and interviews but are quite
frequent in the political talks, thus showing that
it is not only difference between oral and written
that triggers the use of speechact relations.

6 Discussion

So far, we have shown that persuasive texts pro-
duced by the same speaker in different situational
settings do vary with regard to the distribution of
discourse connective forms in the texts, and that
this might reflect differences along the dimension
of editedness and the degree of interaction in the
texts.

Next, we have shown that the variation with re-
gard to discourse connective forms in persuasive
texts controlled for topic and speaker but produced
in different discourse settings is not only due to
stilistic choices made by the speaker. Instead, we
also found variation on the level of discourse rela-
tions, with causal result and concessive speechact
relations being used far more often in the talks
than in the other two discourse settings.

This variation cannot be easily explained with
regard to genre differences as looking at the distri-
bution of discourse relations should abstract away
the stilistic differences between different connec-
tive forms (e.g. formal–informal, highly edited–
less edited). As we assume that that function of
the texts is the same (persuasive text), we hypoth-
esize that the variation in the distribution of dis-
course relations in each communicative setting re-
flects the use of different persuasive strategies em-
ployed to persue the communicative goal.

6.1 Causal relations

Let us start by looking at the causal relations.
While the frequency of REASON relations was
more or less equal in all three subcorpora, we ob-
served a substantially higher amount of RESULT
relations in the talks. Examples (2), (3) show typ-
ical examples for REASON and RESULT relations
in the talk subcorpus.

(2) He was removed from office soon af-
ter because he was considered too soft-
hearted. REASON

(3) For US leaders, aggression means resis-
tance. So, anyone who resists the United
States is guilty of aggression. RESULT

The first example describes an event in the real
world (removed from office) and presents the cause
for this event (being too soft-harted). It can thus
be categorised as a consequence–cause relation.
Example (3), however, does not describe an event

but rather presents two claims, with the first claim
providing the pragmatic justification for the sec-
ond one. Please note that instances like (3) are
not annotated as implicit beliefs. The reason for
this becomes clear when modifying example (3),
as shown below:

(4) For US leaders, aggression means resis-
tance. So I believe, anyone who resists
the United States is guilty of aggression.

The meaning of (4) is different from (3) where
the subject of consciousness holding the belief ex-
pressed in Arg2 are the US leaders while in the
modified example the subject of consciousness is
the speaker.8

Looking at more examples, one striking feature
is the frequent use of the first person plural pro-
noun (we; examples (5)–(7) below) in the talks.

(5) The countries we wanted to sell it to did n’t
have dollars so we had to provide them
with dollars. RESULT

(6) And that makes sense if we own the world
so any active resistance is aggression
against us. RESULT

(7) We did it so therefore it’s efforts to do
good. RESULT

To check whether first person pronouns in gen-
eral are more frequent in the talk subcorpus, we
counted the number of occurrences of I and we for
each discourse setting. Table 6 shows that, as ex-
pected, the written texts have the lowest number
of first person pronouns. First person pronouns
are considered a marker of involvement and are of-
ten used to discriminate spoken from written reg-
isters (Biber, 1995, p.225). Here, however, they
not only distinguish the written from the spoken
texts but also set apart the talks from the inter-
views. While in the latter both I and we are used
with high frequency, in the talks we observe a sig-
nificantly higher number of first person plural us-
age.

6.2 Concession and SpeechAct
Another difference between the three discourse
settings concerns the substantially higher number

8The two claims in (3) are presented as facts in the world
with the second one following from the first, and not as epis-
temic beliefs. We therefore annotate them as content relations
in the sense of Sweetser (1990).

of SPEECHACT relations in the talks. This can not
be ascribed to the medium, i.e. spoken language,
as this relation type is not only rare in the writ-
ten articles but also hardly ever occurs in the inter-
views. Below are typical examples for CONCES-
SION + SPEECHACT in the corpus.

(8) I hope I don’t have to describe it to you,
but it killed several million people , de-
stroyed three countries.

(9) I won’t go through the rest of the history
but it continues pretty much like that.

(10) I won’t run through the whole story but
the basic facts are clear.

Again, we observe a high number of first person
pronouns, here mostly the singular form I. All of
these examples anchor the speech act in the here-
and-now by referring to the discourse situation and
also by referencing a common ground shared be-
tween speaker and audience. By doing so, the
speaker presumes that the hearers agree with his
point of view even without giving further details
on the topic under discussion (examples (8)–(10)).

This communicative strategy requires that the
Ground (Langacker, 1990), i.e. the immediate cir-
cumstances of the speech event such as time and
space, are shared between speaker and audience.
This explains why this strategy cannot be used in
written articles where the speaker only has access
to an imagined audience at best, and no interaction
is possible. In the interview setting, however, the
increased level of interaction might interfere with
the speaker’s construction of the shared common
ground.

6.3 Political talks as oral narratives

Based on the results of our annotation study, we
hypothesize that the differences in the distribution
of discourse relations reflect the use of different
strategies of persuasion in the different commu-
nicative settings. We suggest that it might make
sense to consider persuasive political talks as oral
narratives in the sense of Labov and Waletzky

(1967), with the function of “transfer[ing] expe-
rience from one person to another through oral
narratives of personal experience” (Labov, 2010).
This fits well with the high number of personal
pronouns in the talks which not only reflect a high
amount of involvement but also give credibility to
the narrative. Furthermore, the use of first person
pronouns helps to create an impression of intimacy
between speaker and audience and also lends the
narrative authenticity (Malti-Douglas, 1988, p.93).

These ideas, however, are highly speculative
and need to be tested empirically on a larger ba-
sis and including more than one speaker.

7 Conclusions

We presented an annotation study where we inves-
tigated the use of discourse connectives and dis-
ourse relations in persuasive texts. The texts in
our corpus are controlled for speaker and topic but
produced in different communicative settings. We
observed a substantial variation in the use of dis-
course connective forms and relations. While the
first can be easily explained by genre differences,
we argue that the second variation concerning the
use of discourse relations might reflect different
strategies of persuasion, and that models of audi-
ence design might prove useful for understanding
this variation.
