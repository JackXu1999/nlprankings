Abstract
Behavioral data suggest that both children
and adults struggle to access the inverse
interpretation of scopally-ambiguous ut-
terances in certain contexts. To deter-
mine whether the causes of both child
and adult difficulty are similar, we extend
an existing computational model of chil-
dren’s scope ambiguity resolution in con-
text. We find that the same utterance-
disambiguation mechanism is active in
both children and adults, supporting the
theory of developmental continuity. More-
over, because adult behavior requires an
exact semantics for numerals, we also
provide empirical support for this theory
of linguistic representation.

1 Introduction

Consider a scenario where two out of three horses
jump over a fence. Is the utterance in (1) a reason-
able description?

(1) Every horse didn’t jump over the fence.
a. ∀� ¬ (surface scope):

None of the horses jumped over the fence.
b. ¬� ∀ (inverse scope):

Not all of the horses jumped the fence.

Adults typically endorse the every-not utterance as
true, while children typically do not (Musolino,
1998; Lidz and Musolino, 2002; Musolino and
Lidz, 2006; Musolino, 2006; Viau et al., 2010).
This utterance is scopally ambiguous, involving
multiple quantifiers (i.e., every and n’t). Chil-
dren’s behavior is non-adult-like at five years old:

though the inverse interpretation in (1b) is true,
five-year-olds still do not endorse the utterance.

Now, consider a scenario with only two horses,
one of which successfully jumps. Is the two-not
utterance in (2) a reasonable description?

(2) Two horses didn’t jump.
a. ∃2�¬ (surface scope):

There are two horses that didn’t jump.
b. ¬� ∃2 (inverse scope):

It’s not the case that there are two horses
that jumped.

Most adults would not endorse the utterance, de-
spite the inverse interpretation in (2b) being true
(Musolino and Lidz, 2003)—that is, it is not the
case that two horses jumped (only one did).

This pair of findings underscores that not en-
dorsing a scopally-ambiguous utterance when
only the inverse interpretation is true occurs in
both children and adults in different contexts. We
might therefore wonder about continuity in the
development of scope ambiguity resolution: is
the cause of child utterance non-endorsement in
an every-not scenario qualitatively similar to the
cause of adult non-endorsement in the two-not
scenario? If so, this similarity supports develop-
mental continuity: children use the same mecha-
nism as adults when understanding ambiguous ut-
terances in context. The only difference would
be that adults are better-equipped to deploy this
mechanism, owing perhaps to increased domain-
general knowledge and/or cognitive capacities, or
to language-specific experience. In contrast, if
the underlying causes are different for child and
adult utterance non-endorsement, this would sug-
gest developmental discontinuity: children are en-
gaging in a fundamentally different process as they
understand ambiguous utterances. So, the devel-
opment of adult-like behavior would involve ac-

67



quiring a new mechanism for resolving ambiguity.
To choose between these accounts, we must

understand utterance (non-)endorsement behav-
ior. To that end, Savinelli et al. (2017) articu-
lated a computational model of ambiguity resolu-
tion within the Rational Speech Act (RSA) frame-
work (Goodman and Frank, 2016). The model
demonstrated the central role of pragmatic fac-
tors over processing factors in explaining chil-
dren’s non-adult-like behavior in every-not con-
texts like (1). Here, we extend this same model
to capture two-not utterance endorsement behav-
ior in adults, identifying the factors that yield the
experimentally-observed patterns of behavior.

We begin by reviewing the scope ambiguity res-
olution findings from Savinelli et al. (2017), to-
gether with the experimental results that informed
the design of the computational model. Next, we
consider the experimental findings from Musolino
and Lidz (2003), where adults seem to behave
like children in specific contexts. We then extend
the model from Savinelli et al. (2017) to capture
these new data, and demonstrate support for de-
velopmental continuity, with the same utterance-
disambiguation mechanism active in both chil-
dren and adults. Importantly, the complete range
of experimentally-observed behavior can only be
captured if adults represent two with an exact in-
terpretation, an unexpected finding that informs
the debate on numeral semantics.

2 Previous work: Modeling every-not

In the basic truth-value judgment task (TVJT)
meant to assess children’s scope disambiguation
behavior, children first watch a scene acted out
and hear a puppet produce a scopally-ambiguous
utterance; then they are asked whether they would
endorse the utterance as a true description of the
scenario. Children typically do not endorse the
ambiguous every-not utterance in the critical con-
text where the surface interpretation is false but
the inverse interpretation is true (e.g., a NOT-ALL
scenario where two out of three horses jumped
over a fence). This behavior has been interpreted
as children failing to access the inverse scope in-
terpretation that would make the utterance true.

Interestingly, various alterations to the task
setup have yielded more adult-like behavior in
children, with higher rates of endorsement for the
every-not utterance. These experimental manip-
ulations highlight at least three core factors (two

pragmatic, one processing) that underlie children’s
behavior in the TVJT: (i) pragmatic: expectations
about the experimental world (e.g., how likely suc-
cessful outcomes are), (ii) pragmatic: expecta-
tions about the Question Under Discussion (QUD;
e.g., were all outcomes successful?), and (iii)
processing: the accessibility of the inverse scope
(i.e., the ease by which the logical form is either
derived or accessed in real time).

To capture and independently manipulate the
contributions of each of these factors, Savinelli
et al. (2017) modeled ambiguity resolution for
every-not utterances within the Bayesian RSA
framework (Goodman and Frank, 2016). They
found that when it comes to understanding non-
adult-like behavior in the TVJT, there is likely a
stronger role for the pragmatics of context man-
agement (as realized in prior beliefs about world
state and QUD) than for grammatical process-
ing (as realized in the prior on scope interpreta-
tions), although there may be a role for both. So,
children’s failure to endorse scopally-ambiguous
every-not utterances in NOT-ALL contexts likely
stems from their beliefs about the experimental
world (e.g., whether actors are a priori likely to
succeed) and about the topic of conversation (e.g.,
whether the conversational goal is to determine if
all the actors succeeded), rather than an inabil-
ity to grammatically derive or access the inverse
scope interpretation in real time.

Perhaps most interesting was the prediction
that the highest rates of utterance endorsement
(i.e., adult-like behavior) occur when resolving the
scope ambiguity is irrelevant for communicating
successfully about the NOT-ALL world. This oc-
curs when expectations about the world state favor
total success, or when the QUD asks if all? of the
actors succeeded. In either case, both scope inter-
pretations serve to inform a listener, either that the
a priori likely total-success world state does not
hold or that the answer to the all? QUD is no.

The explanation for utterance non-endorsement
(i.e., non-adult-like behavior) is similar: Savinelli
et al. (2017)’s model predicts the lowest rates
of utterance endorsement in NOT-ALL scenarios
when neither interpretation is useful for success-
ful communication, either because the interpreta-
tion is false (surface) or because beliefs about
the pragmatic context render the interpretation un-
informative (inverse). Thus, the TVJT utterance
non-endorsement data previously used to demon-

68



strate children’s difficulty with inverse scope
calculation in fact require no disambiguation at
all if the goal is informative communication. In-
stead, children simply need the ability to manage
the pragmatic context so they can recognize the
potential informativity of these ambiguous utter-
ances. Notably, considerations of pragmatic con-
text have long played a role in the design and in-
terpretation of the TVJT (e.g., Crain et al., 1996).
Savinelli et al. (2017) take the extra step of for-
mally articulating specific pragmatic factors and
the role they play in children’s apparent difficulty
with ambiguous utterances in the TVJT.

3 Experimental two-not results

Musolino and Lidz (2003) (ML2003) demon-
strated that adults are sensitive to some of the same
experimentally-manipulated factors as children
when it comes to endorsing scopally-ambiguous
utterances. Like us, ML2003 were interested in
developmental continuity: are child and adult am-
biguity resolution behavior in context qualitatively
similar? To investigate this, they conducted three
TVJTs.

The goal of the first TVJT was to determine
which interpretation adults preferred when they
endorsed a scopally-ambiguous utterance in con-
text. For example, adults heard “Cookie Monster
didn’t eat two pizza slices” in a context where
both interpretations were true, such as Cookie
Monster eating one of three available pizza slices
(surface: it’s not the case he ate two = true;
inverse: there are two he didn’t eat = true). Im-
portantly, they were then asked to explain why
they endorsed the utterance so that their preferred
scope interpretation could be inferred. For exam-
ple, if their answer referred to Cookie Monster eat-
ing only one slice, then it was assumed that they
accessed the surface interpretation (surface:
he only ate one, so it’s not the case he ate
two). However, if their answer referred to the
two slices Cookie Monster did not eat, then it
was assumed that they accessed the inverse in-
terpretation (inverse: there are two he didn’t
eat). All participants endorsed the utterance, and
their explanations indicated a strong surface scope
bias (75% surface, 7.5% inverse, 17.5% un-
clear from explanation). ML2003 interpreted this
finding as evdence that adults prefer the surface
scope interpretation when both interpretations are
true in context. It could then be that children’s

non-endorsement behavior, if due to a preference
for the surface scope interpretation, is driven by
a stronger version of this same preference.

In the second TVJT, adults heard an utterance
like (2) (e.g., Two frogs didn’t jump over the rock)
in two different contexts. The first context in-
cluded two actors (e.g., frogs), with one actor suc-
cessfully completing the action (e.g., frog1 jump-
ing over the rock while frog2 does not). In this 1-
OF-2 context, the surface interpretation is false
(only frog2 did not jump, so it is false that two
frogs didn’t jump), but the inverse interpretation
is true (only frog1 did jump, so it is indeed not the
case that two frogs jumped). Yet, adults had low
endorsement (endorsement rate: 27.5%).

In the second context, there were four actors.
For example, four frogs attempted to jump over
a rock; two jumped (frog1, frog2) and two did not
(frog3, frog4). In this 2-OF-4 context, the surface
interpretation of the scopally-ambiguous utterance
is true because frog3 and frog4 did not jump. How-
ever, the inverse interpretation is false because
frog1 and frog2 did indeed jump. Here, adults had
an endorsement rate of 100%.

ML2003 interpreted this asymmetry of en-
dorsement between the two contexts as a strong
surface scope preference in adults. According
to this explanation, non-endorsement occurs in the
1-OF-2 context because only the inverse scope is
true; in contrast, endorsement occurs in the 2-OF-
4 context because only the surface scope is true.
That is, both these patterns would result because
adults favor the surface interpretation. While we
find this account compelling, we note that there
are other differences between the two contexts that
might lead to the observed asymmetry. For exam-
ple, it could be that the seemingly benign change
from two to four total actors affects the pragmatic
context. Another variable is the potential ambigu-
ity present in the numeral semantics, which only
occurs in the 2-OF-4 context.1 In either case,
exploring the effects of these factors in a formal
model of TVJT behavior can clarify the process
underlying utterance disambiguation.

Returning to the question of continuity, while
the observable behavior appears qualitatively
the same in children and adults (i.e., a non-
endorsement preference when only the inverse
scope is true), it remains unclear whether the un-
derlying cause of this behavior is the same. To

evaluate this, ML2003 conducted a third TVJT
with adults in 1-OF-2 contexts, involving an
experimental manipulation from Lidz and Mu-
solino (2002) that children are known to be sen-
sitive to. This manipulation is implemented as
an explicit linguistic contrast clause before the
scopally-ambiguous utterance, such as the bolded
material in (3).

(3) Two frogs jumped over the fence but
two frogs didn’t jump over the rock.

Adults responded the same way as the children
from Lidz and Musolino (2002), shifting to strong
endorsement in the 1-OF-2 context (endorsement
rate: 92.5%; cf. 27.5% endorsement without the
explicit contrast). Yet, as ML2003 note them-
selves, it is not obvious why the adult endorse-
ment rate increases when the linguistic contrast
is present. According to ML2003, the linguistic
contrast creates the positive expectation necessary
to make the negation in the later clause felicitous
(Wason, 1965; Musolino and Lidz, 2003). How-
ever, it remains unclear how exactly the context
creates the positive expectation. There are multi-
ple ways this information could impact the con-
text. For example, the positive expectation could
arise because of a change either in the pragmatic
factor of world knowledge or in the pragmatic fac-
tor of the QUD. Specifically, the affirmative state-
ment could alter the listener’s beliefs about how
successful frogs are known to be in the experimen-
tal world. This affirmative statement also poten-
tially changes the listener’s expectations about the
QUD: because both frogs were successful before,
the topic of conversation might now be focused on
whether both frogs were successful again. Both
these effects could generate a context that makes
the negated clause more informative.

Without knowing the factors responsible for en-
dorsement behavior, it is difficult to determine
whether the same factors are operating in both
children and adults, and whether the underly-
ing representation of two matters. Computational
modeling can help determine why these two be-
havioral patterns occur: (i) adult sensitivity to the
pragmatic contrast manipulation, and (ii) asymme-
try in endorsement behavior between 1-OF-2 and
2-OF-4 contexts in the absence of that pragmatic
contrast. In the next section, we extend Savinelli
et al. (2017)’s model of utterance disambiguation
to handle these empirical data.

4 Modeling two-not

Savinelli et al. (2017)’s model of ambiguity res-
olution is conceived within the Bayesian Ratio-
nal Speech Act (RSA) framework (Goodman and
Frank, 2016), which views language understand-
ing as a social reasoning process. A pragmatic
listener L1 interprets an utterance by reasoning
about a cooperative speaker S1 who is trying to
inform a literal listener L0 about the world. The
model is a “lifted-variable” extension in which
the ambiguous utterance’s literal semantics gets
parameterized by interpretation-fixing variables
(e.g., the relative scope of the quantificational el-
ements; Bergen et al., 2012; Lassiter and Good-
man, 2013; Scontras and Goodman, 2017). Hear-
ing an ambiguous utterance, the pragmatic listener
L1 reasons jointly about the true state of the world
(e.g., how many frogs successfully jumped), the
scope interpretation speaker S1 had in mind (i.e.,
surface, inverse), as well as the likely QUD
that the utterance addresses (e.g., did all frogs
succeed?). To generate testable predictions, par-
ticipant TVJT behavior is modeled as a pragmatic
speaker S2’s (relative) endorsement of an utter-
ance about an observed situation (cf. Degen and
Goodman, 2014; Tessler and Goodman, 2016).
That is, this model predicts whether a speaker S2
would endorse the scopally-ambiguous utterance
as a description of the observed state. S2 decides
this by reasoning about whether a pragmatic lis-
tener L1 (who is reasoning about a speaker S1 rea-
soning about a literal listener L0) would arrive at
the correct world state after hearing the utterance.

We take world states w ∈W to consist of a col-
lection of n individuals (e.g., frogs), each of which
either succeeds or fails at the relevant task (e.g.,
jumping over a rock). The world success baser-
ate bsuc determines the probability that an indi-
vidual will succeed. We assume a simple truth-
functional semantics where an utterance u de-
notes a mapping from world states to truth val-
ues (Bool = {true,false}). We parameterize
this truth function so that it depends on the scope
interpretation i ∈ I = {inverse,surface}, [[u]]i:
W → Bool. We consider two alternative utterances
u ∈U : the null utterance (i.e., saying nothing at
all, and so choosing not to endorse the utterance)
and the scopally-ambiguous utterance amb (e.g.,
“Two frogs didn’t jump over the rock”).

To fix the utterance semantics, we must con-
sider potential ambiguity introduced by the nu-

70



meral in cases where the number of relevant in-
dividuals n exceeds the numeral’s value. For ex-
ample, consider the positive utterance “Two frogs
jumped over the rock.” If we assign an exact
(=) semantics to two, the sentence will be true
only when two frogs succeeded. If we assign an
at-least (≥) semantics, the sentence will be true
when two or more frogs succeeded. In worlds with
only two frogs, the = vs. ≥ distinction makes no
difference: the sentence will be true in the world
where both frogs succeed, and false in all other
worlds. However, in a world with four frogs,
the numeral semantics will define different truth-
functional mappings. With the = semantics, the
sentence is true in any world where two frogs—
but not more—succeed. With the≥ semantics, the
sentence is true in a larger set of worlds, where
two or more frogs succeed.

To evaluate the potential contribution of utter-
ance semantics to the 1-OF-2 vs. 2-OF-4 asymme-
try, we consider two different sets of utterance al-
ternatives, one with amb= and another with amb≥.
So, U= = {null, amb=} and U≥ = {null, amb≥}.
The utterance semantics in (4) shows that scope
parameterization i only impacts the truth condi-
tions for amb utterances.2

(4) Utterance semantics [[u]]i:
a. [[null]]i = true
b. [[amb=/≥]]i = if i = inverse

then [[inverse=/≥]]
else [[surface=/≥]]

where:
[[inverse=]] =

λw. ¬∃!x: |x|= 2 ∧ x ⊆ success(w)
[[surface=]] =

λw. ∃!x: |x|= 2 ∧ x 6⊆ success(w)
[[inverse≥]] =

λw. ¬∃x: |x|= 2 ∧ x ⊆ success(w)
[[surface≥]] =

λw. ∃x: |x|= 2 ∧ x 6⊆ success(w)

We consider five potential QUDs q ∈ Q,
three from the original Savinelli et al. (2017)
model: (i) “What happened with the frogs?”
(what-happened?), (ii) “Did all the frogs suc-
ceed?” (all?), and (iii) “Did none of the frogs
succeed?” (none?). We also consider two addi-
tional QUDs specific to the two-not utterance: (iv)
“Did exactly two frogs succeed?” (two=?), and

2The success() function in (4) returns the set of success-
ful outcomes in a world w.

(v) “Did at least two frogs succeed?” (two≥?).
The QUDs serve as projections from the inferred
world state to the relevant dimension of meaning,
so that q : W → X (Kao et al., 2014a,b). In prac-
tice, the QUDs establish partitions on the possible
world states, as shown in (5). For example, the
all? QUD partitions the world space in two: the
unique world in which all frogs succeeded (true)
and all other possible worlds (false).

(5) QUD semantics [[q]]:
a. [[what-happened?]] = λw. w
b. [[all?]] = λw. success(w) = w
c. [[none?]] = λw. success(w) = Ø
d. [[two=?]] = λw. |success(w)| = 2
e. [[two≥?]] = λw. |success(w)| ≥ 2

Literal listener L0 has prior uncertainty about the
true state, P(w). L0 updates beliefs about w con-
ditioned on the the literal semantics, and restricts
prior beliefs to those worlds that [[u]]i maps to
true. The function δ[[u]]i(w) maps the Boolean truth
value to a probability, 1 or 0.

PL0(w|u, i) ∝ δ[[u]]i(w) ·P(w)
To capture the notion that communication pro-
ceeds relative to a specific QUD q, L0 must infer
not only the true world state w, but also the value
of the QUD applied to that world state, [[q]](w)= x.

PL0(x|u, i,q) ∝ ∑
w

δx=[[q]](w) ·PL0(w|u, i)

Speaker S1 chooses an utterance u in proportion
to its utility in communicating about the true world
state w with respect to the QUD q, [[q]](w) = x.
Thus, the speaker maximizes the probability that
L0 arrives at the intended x from u. This selection
is implemented via a softmax function (exp) and
free parameter α, which controls how rational the
speaker is in utterance selection.

PS1(u|w, i,q) ∝ exp(α · log(L0(x|u, i,q)))
Utterance interpretation happens at the level of

the pragmatic listener L1, who interprets an utter-
ance u to jointly infer the world state w, the inter-
pretation i, and the QUD q. We model ambiguity
resolution as pragmatic inference over an under-
specified utterance semantics (i.e., the interpreta-
tion variable i). To do this, L1 inverts S1’s model,
and so the joint probability of w, i, and q is propor-
tional to the likelihood of S1 producing utterance
u given world state w, interpretation i, and QUD q,
as well as the priors on w, i, and q.

PL1(w, i,q|u) ∝ PS1(u|w, i,q) ·P(w) ·P(i) ·P(q)

71



To model the utterance endorsement implicit in
TVJT, we need an additional level of inference.
Pragmatic speaker S2 observes the true world state
w and selects u by inverting the L1 model, thus
maximizing the probability that a pragmatic lis-
tener would arrive at w from u by summing over
possible interpretations i and QUDs q for world w.

PS2(u|w) ∝ exp(log∑
i,q

PL1(w, i,q|u))

To generate model predictions for adult sensi-
tivity to the pragmatic contrast manipulation and
the 1-OF-2 vs. 2-OF-4 asymmetry, we fix various
model parameters. For 1-OF-2 data, we set the
number of individuals n to 2; for 2-OF-4 data, we
set n to 4. The S1 speaker rationality parameter
α> 0 is set to 2.5 (i.e., the same value in the every-
not simulations in Savinelli et al., 2017). The pri-
ors P(w) and P(q) correspond to expectations for
the discourse context (i.e., likely world states or
QUDs). In the default case, we set these priors
to be uniform over their possible values, with the
individual success baserate bsuc set to 0.5 and the
relevant QUDs having equal probability. The in-
terpretation prior P(i) corresponds to how easy
it is to access the inverse scope interpretation.
In the default case, P(inverse) = P(surface) =
0.5. Importantly, to better understand utterance
endorsement behavior with scopally-ambiguous
utterances, we can independently manipulate the
values of the priors on W , Q, and I, and observe
their impact on utterance endorsement.

5 Results

Recall the empirical phenomena we are trying to
capture: (i) the dramatic increase in endorsement
rates in the 1-OF-2 context when an explicit con-
trast is present, and (ii) the stark asymmetry in ut-
terance endorsement rates between 1-OF-2 and 2-
OF-4 contexts in the absence of that explicit con-
trast. We report results for each in turn.

5.1 The explicit contrast effect for 1-OF-2

Following Savinelli et al. (2017), we attempt to
capture the increase in ambiguous utterance en-
dorsement rates by systematically manipulating
the pragmatic and processing factors, as imple-
mented in the relevant priors.

For the world state prior (Figure 1, left), we ma-
nipulate baserate bsuc, which determines an actor’s
chance of success. Holding the QUD and scope
priors at their default values, we see a marked in-

crease in endorsement of the ambiguous utterance
in the 1-OF-2 context as prior beliefs about frog
success increase. Utterance endorsement is at its
lowest (33%) when prior knowledge suggests that
frogs are particularly unlikely to succeed; endorse-
ment is at its highest (86%) when frogs are very
likely to succeed.

For the QUD prior (Figure 1, center), we
selectively favor specific QUDs by assigning a
0.9 probability to the favored QUD and dividing
the remaining probability equally among the oth-
ers. Since the two? QUDs are equivalent to the
all? QUD in the 1-OF-2 context, we omitted
the two? QUDs in the 1-OF-2 context. Holding
the other priors at their default values, endorse-
ment rates increase from favoring the none? QUD
(35%) to favoring the what-happened? QUD
(46%) to favoring the all? QUD (64%).

For the scope prior (Figure 1, right), we manip-
ulate the prior probability of the inverse inter-
pretation while holding the other factors at their
default values. We see an increase in utterance
endorsement as the probability of inverse in-
creases, from a low of 40% to a high of 57%.

Each manipulation qualitatively captures the re-
sponse pattern from ML2003, and replicates the
results of Savinelli et al. for every-not. How-
ever, as observed by Savinelli et al., the pragmatic
factors controlling world and QUD beliefs have a
much more pronounced effect than the processing
factor controlling scope access; the model’s world
prior baserate manipulation comes closest to cap-
turing the experimentally-observed effect of ex-
plicit contrast manipulation (i.e., 27.5% base en-
dorsement vs. 92.5% endorsement with the ex-
plicit contrast). We can amplify the effect of the
world baserate manipulation by allowing it to in-
teract with the other factors.

As discussed in Section 3, the early success ex-
plicit contrast manipulation possibly affects two
aspects of the disambiguation calculus: it could
increase expectations for success and shift the
topic of conversation to whether total success was
achieved again. Figure 2 plots the interaction of
the world and QUD priors, together with the effect
of scope. The low-endorsement baseline (27.5%)
most likely results from low expectations for suc-
cess (bsuc = 0.1) and QUD uncertainty (QUD:
uniform), together with a moderate to low proba-
bility of accessing the inverse scope (P(inv) =
0.1 or 0.5). From this baseline, we implement

the effect of the explicit contrast manipulation by
increasing success expectations (bsuc = 0.9) and
shifting the topic of conversation to whether total
success occurred (QUD: all?). This manipulation
results in a dramatic increase in utterance endorse-
ment, irrespective of scope.

To summarize, if the explicit contrast clause im-
pacts a listener’s beliefs about the frogs’ chance
of success (increasing bsuc) or the QUD (favoring
all?), then the model predicts the endorsement
rate should increase. Notably, both of these ma-
nipulations make the two-not scopally-ambiguous
utterance more informative for a listener. In the
case of the the world state manipulation, two-
not—under either scope interpretation—informs
the listener that her prior beliefs about total frog
success do not hold. Similarly with the QUD ma-
nipulation favoring all?, both scope interpreta-
tions answer this question in the negative (i.e., it
is not the case that all (two) frogs succeeded).

5.2 The 1-OF-2 vs. 2-OF-4 asymmetry

If the factors identified for capturing the
experimentally-observed effect of the ex-

Figure 3: Model predictions for ambiguous two-
not endorsement in a 2-OF-4 context.

plicit contrast are indeed active in utterance
disambiguation (i.e., to validate their explanatory
power), we would expect the very same factors
and values to additionally capture the ceiling-level
endorsement rate in the 2-OF-4 context without
the explicit contrast.

Recall the baseline 1-OF-2 values from Figure
2: low expectations for success (bsuc = 0.1) and
QUD uncertainty (QUD: uniform). To model the
2-OF-4 context, we change the number of actors
n to 4 and additionally manipulate whether the
exact (=) or at-least (≥) semantics applies, as
they diverge when there are more than two actors
in the context (see section 4). This decision im-
pacts both the utterance semantics and the relevant
set of QUDs (e.g., if ≥ semantics gets used, then
the two≥? QUD is included in the set of poten-
tial QUDs). As shown in Figure 3, we do indeed
predict high endorsement with the same parame-
ter value baseline, but only with exact utterance
semantics and a low probability of accessing the
inverse scope (P(inv) = 0.1). In this case, we find
an endorsement rate of 92%.

6 Discussion

Our model of ambiguity resolution in context cap-
tures the effect of the explicit contrast manipula-
tion observed in adults in ML2003, and notably

73



also captured the same effect in children (Savinelli
et al., 2017). This parallelism—sensitivity to
the pragmatic context in both children and adults
across different contexts—suggests that the same
disambiguation mechanism is active in both chil-
dren and adults. Adults seem better able to char-
itably interpret less supportive pragmatic contexts
(i.e., the original every-not scenarios); yet, there
remain scenarios (i.e., certain two-not contexts)
where even adult abilities are exceeded. We inter-
pret the common underlying mechanism as sup-
port for developmental continuity in scope ambi-
guity resolution, with no qualitative shift required.

In addition to supporting the developmental
continuity hypothesis, this model also suggests
why manipulations like the explicit contrast clause
work. The pragmatic variables capture the explicit
contrast manipulation because they create a situ-
ation where the ambiguous two-not utterance is
still informative despite the ambiguity. When the
utterance provides the listener with information
that diverges from her prior beliefs, the ambigu-
ous two-not utterance becomes more informative,
more useful, and therefore more endorsable.

The model also seamlessly captures ML2003’s
results from the 2-OF-4 context: with the very
same parameter values that yield low endorsement
rates for 1-OF-2 contexts, the model predicts the
high endorsement observed for 2-OF-4 contexts.
The only change is increasing the number of rele-
vant individuals from two to four. This exploration
of the 1-OF-2 vs. 2-OF-4 contexts allows us to re-
fine our understanding of the potential sources of
child and adult behavior. Savinelli et al. (2017)’s
findings suggested that pragmatic factors alone are
capable of capturing the non-adult-like behavior
in children and the extension in the current model
captures the explicit contrast effect in adults; how-
ever, the processing factor of scope (in particu-
lar, disfavoring the inverse scope) is needed to ac-
count for ML2003’s 2-OF-4 results. This find-
ing supports ML2003’s conclusion, namely that
adults have a strong preference for surface inter-
pretations of two-not utterances. Combined with
the appropriate pragmatic context, that preference
has the potential to drive the endorsement asym-
metry between the 1-OF-2 and 2-OF-4 contexts.
Whether this surface interpretation preference in
two-not contexts is also something children share
remains an open empirical question; experimen-
tal results for every-not do not answer this ques-

tion definitively (Viau et al., 2010; Savinelli et al.,
2017).

Importantly, the present model requires one
more ingredient to account for the 1-OF-2 vs. 2-
OF-4 difference in adult behavior: an exact nu-
meral semantics (in contrast to an at-least se-
mantics; cf. Geurts, 2006; Breheny, 2008; Spec-
tor, 2013; Kennedy, 2015). While the underlying
utterance semantics is not something easy to ma-
nipulate in an experiment, it is exactly the kind of
variable we can systematically explore in a com-
putational model. By doing so here, we are able
to show the necessity of an exact semantics in
generating observable adult behavior. This pro-
vides empirical support, coming from computa-
tional modeling, for theories about the semantics
of numerals. In particular, the only way to ac-
count for the observed adult behavior is if adults
interpret two utterances as meaning exactly two.

To sum up, these findings underscore the com-
plexity of information involved in interpreting
scopally-ambiguous utterances, including the lit-
eral semantics of the utterances involved, process-
ing factors that affect interpretation accessibility,
pragmatic factors that affect the potential informa-
tivity of the utterance, and the recursive social rea-
soning between speakers and listeners. Here, we
find evidence for the impact of both pragmatic and
processing factors, and in particular how a specific
confluence of values for these factors yields the
observed adult utterance endorsement behavior in
multiple contexts. The fact that pragmatic factors
can have such a pronounced effect on their own ac-
cords with previous computational findings about
the cause of children’s utterance endorsement be-
havior in context, thereby highlighting the devel-
opmental continuity in pragmatic reasoning from
childhood to adulthood. Moreover, the fact that
the processing factor of scope access is crucial for
explaining adult behavior in certain contexts mo-
tivates experimental work with children to see if
their behavior is likewise affected by this process-
ing factor in similar contexts. The fact that only
the exact utterance semantics is capable of yield-
ing the observed behavior provides empirical sup-
port in favor of this theory of representation for
numerals. More broadly, we have demonstrated
how computational modeling can help us refine
our theories about different aspects of language,
including theories of language understanding, lan-
guage development, and language representation.
