Abstract
Recently there has been a lot of interest in
learning common representations for multiple
views of data. Typically, such common rep-
resentations are learned using a parallel cor-
pus between the two views (say, 1M images
and their English captions). In this work,
we address a real-world scenario where no
direct parallel data is available between two
views of interest (say, V1 and V2) but parallel
data is available between each of these views
and a pivot view (V3). We propose a model
for learning a common representation for V1,
V2 and V3 using only the parallel data avail-
able between V1V3 and V2V3. The proposed
model is generic and even works when there
are n views of interest and only one pivot view
which acts as a bridge between them. There
are two specific downstream applications that
we focus on (i) transfer learning between lan-
guages L1,L2,...,Ln using a pivot language
L and (ii) cross modal access between im-
ages and a language L1 using a pivot lan-
guage L2. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance in multilingual document classi-
fication on the publicly available multilingual
TED corpus and promising results in multilin-
gual multimodal retrieval on a new dataset cre-
ated and released as a part of this work.

1 Introduction

The proliferation of multilingual and multimodal
content online has ensured that multiple views of
the same data exist. For example, it is common
to find the same article published in multiple lan-
guages online in multilingual news articles, multilin-
gual wikipedia articles, etc. Such multiple views can

even belong to different modalities. For example,
images and their textual descriptions are two views
of the same entity. Similarly, audio, video and subti-
tles of a movie are multiple views of the same entity.

Learning common representations for such mul-
tiple views of data will help in several downstream
applications. For example, learning a common rep-
resentation for images and their textual descriptions
could help in finding images which match a given
textual description. Further, such common represen-
tations can also facilitate transfer learning between
views. For example, a document classifier trained
on one language (view) can be used to classify doc-
uments in another language by representing docu-
ments of both languages in a common subspace.

Existing approaches to common representation
learning (Ngiam et al., 2011; Klementiev et al.,
2012; Chandar et al., 2013; Chandar et al., 2014;
Andrew et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015) except (Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2014b) typically require paral-
lel data between all views. However, in many real-
world scenarios such parallel data may not be avail-
able. For example, while there are many publicly
available datasets containing images and their cor-
responding English captions, it is very hard to find
datasets containing images and their corresponding
captions in Russian, Dutch, Hindi, Urdu, etc. In this
work, we are interested in addressing such scenar-
ios. More specifically, we consider scenarios where
we have n different views but parallel data is only
available between each of these views, and a pivot
view. In particular, there is no parallel data available
between the non-pivot views.

To this end, we propose Bridge Correlational

171



Neural Networks (Bridge CorrNets) which learn
aligned representations across multiple views using
a pivot view. We build on the work of (Chandar
et al., 2016) but unlike their model, which only ad-
dresses scenarios where direct parallel data is avail-
able between two views, our model can work for
n(≥2) views even when no parallel data is avail-
able between all of them. Our model only requires
parallel data between each of these n views and a
pivot view. During training, our model maximizes
the correlation between the representations of the
pivot view and each of the n views. Intuitively, the
pivot view ensures that similar entities across differ-
ent views get mapped close to each other since the
model would learn to map each of them close to the
corresponding entity in the pivot view.

We evaluate our approach using two downstream
applications. First, we employ our model to facil-
itate transfer learning between multiple languages
using English as the pivot language. For this,
we do an extensive evaluation using 110 source-
target language pairs and clearly show that we out-
perform the current state-of-the art approach (Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2014b). Second, we em-
ploy our model to enable cross modal access be-
tween images and French/German captions using
English as the pivot view. For this, we created
a test dataset consisting of images and their cap-
tions in French and German in addition to the En-
glish captions which were publicly available. To the
best of our knowledge, this task of retrieving im-
ages given French/German captions (and vice versa)
without direct parallel training data between them
has not been addressed in the past. Even on this
task we report promising results. Code and data
used in this paper can be downloaded from http:

2 Related Work

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and its vari-
ants (Hotelling, 1936; Vinod, 1976; Nielsen et al.,
1998; Cruz-Cano and Lee, 2014; Akaho, 2001) are
the most commonly used methods for learning a
common representation for two views. However,
most of these models generally work with two views
only. Even though there are multi-view generaliza-
tions of CCA (Tenenhaus and Tenenhaus, 2011; Luo

et al., 2015), their computational complexity makes
them unsuitable for larger data sizes.

Another class of algorithms for multiview learn-
ing is based on Neural Networks. One of the ear-
liest neural network based model for learning com-
mon representations was proposed in (Hsieh, 2000).
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in this
field and several neural network based models have
been proposed. For example, Multimodal Autoen-
coder (Ngiam et al., 2011), Deep Canonically Cor-
related Autoencoder (Wang et al., 2015), Deep CCA
(Andrew et al., 2013) and Correlational Neural Net-
works (CorrNet) (Chandar et al., 2016). CorrNet
performs better than most of the above mentioned
methods and we build on their work as discussed in
the next section.

One of the tasks that we address in this work is
multilingual representation learning where the aim
is to learn aligned representations for words across
languages. Some notable neural network based ap-
proaches here include the works of (Klementiev et
al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013;
Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b; Hermann and Blun-
som, 2014a; Chandar et al., 2014; Soyer et al., 2015;
Gouws et al., 2015). However, except for (Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2014a; Hermann and Blunsom,
2014b), none of these other works handle the case
when parallel data is not available between all lan-
guages. Our model addresses this issue and outper-
forms the model of Hermann and Blunsom (2014b).

The task of cross modal access between images
and text addressed in this work comes under Mul-
tiModal Representation Learning where each view
belongs to a different modality. Ngiam et al. (2011)
proposed an autoencoder based solution to learning
common representation for audio and video. Srivas-
tava and Salakhutdinov (2014) extended this idea to
RBMs and learned common representations for im-
age and text. Other solutions for image/text rep-
resentation learning include (Zheng et al., 2014a;
Zheng et al., 2014b; Socher et al., 2014). All these
approaches require parallel data between the two
views and do not address multimodal, multilingual
learning in situations where parallel data is available
only between different views and a pivot view.

In the past, pivot/bridge languages have been used
to facilitate MT (for example, (Wu and Wang, 2007;
Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007;

172



Nakov and Ng, 2009)), transitive CLIR (Ballesteros,
2000; Lehtokangas et al., 2008), transliteration and
transliteration mining (Khapra et al., 2010a; Ku-
maran et al., 2010; Khapra et al., 2010b; Zhang et
al., 2011). None of these works use neural networks
but it is important to mention them here because they
use the concept of a pivot language (view) which is
central to our work.

3 Bridge Correlational Neural Network

In this section, we describe Bridge CorrNet which
is an extension of the CorrNet model proposed by
(Chandar et al., 2016). They address the problem
of learning common representations between two
views when parallel data is available between them.
We propose an extension to their model which si-
multaneously learns a common representation forM
views when parallel data is available only between
one pivot view and the remaining M − 1 views.

Let these views be denoted by V1, V2, ..., VM and
let d1, d2, ..., dM be their respective dimensionali-
ties. Let the training data be Z = {zi}Ni=1 where
each training instance contains only two views, i.e.,
zi = (vij , v

i
M ) where j ∈ {1, 2, ..,M−1} and M is

a pivot view. To be more clear, the training data con-
tains N1 instances for which (vi1, v

i
M ) are available,

N2 instances for which (vi2, v
i
M ) are available and

so on tillNM−1 instances for which (viM−1, v
i
M ) are

available (such that N1 + N2 + ... + NM−1 = N ).
We denote each of these disjoint pairwise training
sets by Z1 , Z2 to ZM−1 such that Z is the union of
all these sets.

As an illustration consider the case when English,
French and German texts are the three views of in-
terest with English as the pivot view. As training
data, we have N1 instances containing English and
their corresponding French texts and N2 instances
containing English and their corresponding German
texts. We are then interested in learning a common
representation for English, French and German even
though we do not have any training instance contain-
ing French and their corresponding German texts.

Bridge CorrNet uses an encoder-decoder architec-
ture with a correlation based regularizer to achieve
this. It contains one encoder-decoder pair for each
of the M views. For each view Vj , we have,

hVj (vj) = f(Wjvj + b) (1)

Figure 1: Bridge Correlational Neural Network. The views are
English, French and German with English being the pivot view.

where f is any non-linear function such as sigmoid
or tanh, Wj ∈ Rk×dj is the encoder matrix for view
Vj , b ∈ Rk is the common bias shared by all the
encoders. We also compute a hidden representation
for the concatenated training instance z = (vj , vM )
using the following encoder function:

hZ(z) = f(Wjvj +WM vM + b) (2)

In the remainder of this paper, whenever we drop the
subscript for the encoder, then the encoder is deter-
mined by its argument. For example h(vj) means
hVj (vj), h(z) means hZ(z) and so on.

Our model also has a decoder corresponding to
each view as follows:

gVj (h) = p(W
′
jh+ cj) (3)

where p can be any activation function,W ′j ∈ Rdj×k
is the decoder matrix for view Vj , cj ∈ Rdj is the
decoder bias for view Vj . We also define g(h) as
simply the concatenation of [gVj (h), gVM (h)].

In effect, hVj (.) encodes the input vj into a hid-
den representation h and then gVj (.) tries to de-
code/reconstruct vj from this hidden representation
h. Note that h can be computed using h(vj) or
h(vM ). The decoder can then be trained to de-
code/reconstruct both vj and vM given a hidden rep-
resentation computed using any one of them. More
formally, we train Bridge CorrNet by minimizing
the following objective function:

JZ(θ) =
N∑

i=1

L(zi, g(h(zi))) +
N∑

i=1

L(zi, g(h(vil(i))))

+
N∑

i=1

L(zi, g(h(vi
M

)))− λ corr(h(Vl(i)), h(VM ))

(4)

173



where l(i) = j if zi ∈ Zj and the correlation term
corr is defined as follows:

corr =
∑N

i=1(h(x
i)− h(X))(h(yi)− h(Y ))√∑N

i=1(h(xi)− h(X))2
∑N

i=1(h(yi)− h(Y ))2
(5)

Note that g(h(zi)) is the reconstruction of the input
zi after passing through the encoder and decoder. L
is a loss function which captures the error in this re-
construction, λ is the scaling parameter to scale the
last term with respect to the remaining terms, h(X)
is the mean vector for the hidden representations of
the first view and h(Y ) is the mean vector for the
hidden representations of the second view.

We now explain the intuition behind each term in
the objective function. The first term captures the er-
ror in reconstructing the concatenated input zi from
itself. The second term captures the error in recon-
structing both views given the non-pivot view, vil(i).
The third term captures the error in reconstructing
both views given the pivot view, vi

M
. Minimizing the

second and third terms ensures that both the views
can be predicted from any one view. Finally, the
correlation term ensures that the network learns cor-
related common representations for all views.

Our model can be viewed as a generalization of
the two-view CorrNet model proposed in (Chandar
et al., 2016). By learning joint representations for
multiple views using disjoint training sets Z1 , Z2 to
ZM−1 it eliminates the need for nC2 pair-wise paral-
lel datasets between all views of interest. The pivot
view acts as a bridge and ensures that similar enti-
ties across different views get mapped close to each
other since all of them would be close to the corre-
sponding entity in the pivot view.

Note that unlike the objective function of Cor-
rNet (Chandar et al., 2016), the objective func-
tion of Equation 4, is a dynamic objective func-
tion which changes with each training instance. In
other words, l(i) ∈ {1, 2, ..,M−1} varies for each
i ∈ {1, 2, .., N}. For efficient implementation, we
construct mini-batches where each mini-batch will
come from only one of the sets Z1 to ZM−1 . We
randomly shuffle these mini-batches and use corre-
sponding objective function for each mini-batch.

As a side note, we would like to mention that in
addition to Z1 , Z2 to ZM−1 as defined earlier, if ad-
ditional parallel data is available between some of

the non-pivot views then the objective function can
be suitably modified to use this parallel data to fur-
ther improve the learning. However, this is not the
focus of this work and we leave this as a possible
future work.

4 Datasets

In this section, we describe the two datasets that we
used for our experiments.

4.1 Multlingual TED corpus

Hermann and Blunsom (2014b) provide a multilin-
gual corpus based on the TED corpus for IWSLT
2013 (Cettolo et al., 2012). It contains English tran-
scriptions of several talks from the TED conference
and their translations in multiple languages. We
use the parallel data between English and other lan-
guages for training Bridge Corrnet (English, thus,
acts as the pivot langauge). Hermann and Blunsom
(2014b) also propose a multlingual document classi-
fication task using this corpus. The idea is to use the
keywords associated with each talk (document) as
class labels and then train a classifier to predict these
classes. There are one or more such keywords asso-
ciated with each talk but only the 15 most frequent
keywords across all documents are considered as
class labels. We used the same pre-processed splits1

as provided by (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b).
The training corpus consists of a total of 12,078 par-
allel documents distributed across 12 language pairs.

4.2 Multilingual Image Caption dataset

The MSCOCO dataset2 contains images and their
English captions. On an average there are 5 cap-
tions per image. The standard train/valid/test splits
for this dataset are also available online. However,
the reference captions for the images in the test split
are not provided. Since we need such reference cap-
tions for evaluations, we create a new train/valid/test
of this dataset. Specifically, we take 80K images
from the standard train split and 40K images from
the standard valid split. We then randomly split
the merged 120K images into train(118K), valida-
tion (1K) and test set (1K).

We then create a multilingual version of the test
data by collecting French and German translations
for all the 5 captions for each image in the test
set. We use crowdsourcing to do this. We used the
CrowdFlower platform and solicited one French and
one German translation for each of the 5000 cap-
tions using native speakers. We got each transla-
tion verified by 3 annotators. We restricted the ge-
ographical location of annotators based on the tar-
get language. We found that roughly 70% of the
French translations and 60% of the German trans-
lations were marked as correct by a majority of the
verifiers. On further inspection with the help of
in-house annotators, we found that the errors were
mainly syntactic and the content words are trans-
lated correctly in most of the cases. Since none of
the approaches described in this work rely on syn-
tax, we decided to use all the 5000 translations as
test data. This multilingual image caption test data
(MIC test data) will be made publicly available3 and
will hopefully assist further research in this area.

5 Experiment 1: Transfer learning using a
pivot language

From the TED corpus described earlier, we consider
English transcriptions and their translations in 11
languages, viz., Arabic, German, Spanish, French,
Italian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Ro-
man, Russian and Turkish. Following the setup of
Hermann and Blunsom (2014b), we consider the
task of cross language learning between each of the
11C2 non-English language pairs. The task is to clas-
sify documents in a language when no labeled train-
ing data is available in this language but training data
is available in another language. This involves the
following steps:
1. Train classifier: Consider one language as the
source language and the remaining 10 languages as
target languages. Train a document classifier us-
ing the labeled data of the source language, where
each training document is represented using the hid-
den representation computed using a trained Bridge
Corrnet model. As in (Hermann and Blunsom,
2014b) we used an averaged perceptron trained for
10 epochs as the classifier for all our experiments.
The train split provided by (Hermann and Blunsom,

3http://sarathchandar.in/bridge-corrnet

2014b) is used for training.
2. Cross language classification: For every target
language, compute a hidden representation for ev-
ery document in its test set using Bridge CorrNet.
Now use the classifier trained in the previous step
to classify this document. The test split provided by
(Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b) is used for testing.

5.1 Training and tuning Bridge Corrnet

For the above process to work, we first need to train
Bridge Corrnet so that it can then be used for com-
puting a common hidden representation for docu-
ments in different languages. For training Bridge
CorrNet, we treat English as the pivot language
(view) and construct parallel training sets Z1 to Z11 .
Every instance in Z1 contains the English and Ara-
bic view of the same talk (document). Similarly, ev-
ery instance in Z2 contains the English and German
view of the same talk (document) and so on. For
every language, we first construct a vocabulary con-
taining all words appearing more than 5 times in the
corpus (all talks) of that language. We then use this
vocabulary to construct a bag-of-words representa-
tion for each document. The size of the vocabulary
(|V |) for different languages varied from 31213 to
60326 words. To be more clear, v1 = varabic ∈
R|V |arabic , v2 = vgerman ∈ R|V |german and so on.

We train our model for 10 epochs using the above
training data Z = {Z1 ,Z2 , ...,Z11}. We use hidden
representations of size D = 128, as in (Hermann
and Blunsom, 2014b). Further, we used stochastic
gradient descent with mini-batches of size 20. Each
mini-batch contains data from only one of the Zis.
We get a stochastic estimate for the correlation term
in the objective function using this mini-batch. The
hyperparameter λ was tuned to each task using a
training/validation split for the source language and
using the performance on the validation set of an av-
eraged perceptron trained on the training set (notice
that this corresponds to a monolingual classification
experiment, since the general assumption is that no
labeled data is available in the target language).

5.2 Results

We now present the results of our cross language
classification task in Table 1. Each row corresponds
to a source language and each column corresponds
to a target language. We report the average F1-

scores over all the 15 classes. We compare our re-
sults with the best results reported in (Hermann and
Blunsom, 2014b) (see Table 2). Out of the 110
experiments, our model outperforms the model of
(Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b) in 107 experiments.
This suggests that our model efficiently exploits the
pivot language to facilitate cross language learning
between other languages.

Finally, we present the results for a monolingual
classification task in Table 3. The idea here is to
see if learning common representations for multiple
views can also help in improving the performance
of a task involving only one view. Hermann and

Blunsom (2014b) argue that a Naive Bayes (NB)
classifier trained using a bag-of-words representa-
tion of the documents is a very strong baseline. In
fact, a classifier trained on document representations
learned using their model does not beat a NB classi-
fier for the task of monolingual classification. Rows
2 to 5 in Table 3 show the different settings tried by
them (we refer the reader to (Hermann and Blunsom,
2014b) for a detailed description of these settings).
On the other hand our model is able to beat NB for
5/11 languages. Further, for 4 other languages (Ger-
man, French, Romanian, Russian) its performance is
only marginally poor than that of NB.

6 Experiment 2: Cross modal access using
a pivot language

In this experiment, we are interested in retrieving
images given their captions in French (or German)
and vice versa. However, for training we do not
have any parallel data containing images and their
French (or German) captions. Instead, we have the
following datasets: (i) a dataset Z1 containing im-
ages and their English captions and (ii) a dataset Z2
containing English and their parallel French (or Ger-
man) documents. For Z1 , we use the training split
of MSCOCO dataset which contains 118K images
and their English captions (see Section 4.2). For
Z2 , we use the English-French (or German) paral-
lel documents from the train split of the TED corpus
(see Section 4.1). We use English as the pivot lan-
guage and train Bridge Corrnet usingZ = {Z1 ,Z2}
to learn common representations for images, En-
glish text and French (or German) text. For text,
we use bag-of-words representation and for image,
we use the 4096 (fc6) representation got from a pre-
trained ConvNet (BVLC Reference CaffeNet (Jia et
al., 2014)). We learn hidden representations of size
D = 200 by training Bridge Corrnet for 20 epochs
using stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches
of size 20. Each mini-batch contains data from only
one of the Zis.

For the task of retrieving captions given an image,
we consider the 1000 images in our test set (see sec-
tion 4.2) as queries. The 5000 French (or German)
captions corresponding to these images (5 per im-
age) are considered as documents. The task is then
to retrieve the relevant captions for each image. We
represent all the captions and images in the com-
mon space as computed using Bridge Corrnet. For
a given query, we rank all the captions based on the
Euclidean distance between the representation of the
image and the caption. For the task of retrieving im-
ages given a caption, we simply reverse the role of
the captions and images. In other words, each of the
5000 captions is treated as a query and the 1000 im-
ages are treated as documents. λ was tuned to each
task using a training/validation split. For the task of
retrieving French/German captions given an image,
λ was tuned using the performance on the validation
set for retrieving French (or German) sentences for
a given English sentence. For the other task, λ was

tuned using the performance on the validation set for
retrieving images, given English captions. We do
not use any image-French/German parallel data for
tuning the hyperparameters.

We use recall@k as the performance metric and
compare the following methods in Table 4:
1. En-Image CorrNet: This is the CorrNet model
trained using only Z1 as defined earlier in this sec-
tion. The task is to retrieve English captions for a
given image (or vice versa). This gives us an idea
about the performance we could expect if direct par-
allel data is available between images and their cap-
tions in some language. We used the publicly avail-
able implementation of CorrNet provided by (Chan-
dar et al., 2016).
2. Bridge CorrNet: This is the Bridge CorrNet
model trained using Z1 and Z2 as defined earlier in
this section. The task is to retrieve French (or Ger-
man) captions for a given image (or vice versa).
3. Bridge MAE: The Multimodal Autoencoder
(MAE) proposed by (Ngiam et al., 2011) was the
only competing model which was easily extendable
to the bridge case. We train their model using Z1
and Z2 to minimize a suitably modified objective
function. We then use the representations learned
to retrieve French (or German) captions for a given
image (or vice versa).
4. 2-CorrNet: Here, we train two individual Corr-
Nets using Z1 and Z2 respectively. For the task of
retrieving images given a French (or German) cap-
tion we first find its nearest English caption using
the Fr-En (or De-En) CorrNet. We then use this En-
glish caption to retrieve images using the En-Image
CorrNet. Similarly, for retrieving captions given an
image we use the En-Image CorrNet followed by the
En-Fr (or En-De) CorrNet.
5. CorrNet + MT: Here, we train an En-Image Cor-
rNet using Z1 and an Fr/De-En MT system4 using
Z2 . For the task of retrieving images given a French
(or German) caption we translate the caption to En-
glish using the MT system. We then use this English
caption to retrieve images using the En-Image Cor-
rNet. For retrieving captions given images, we first
translate all the 5000 French (or Germam) captions
to English. We then embed these English transla-
tions (documents) and images (queries) in the com-

6. Random: A random image is returned for the
given caption (and vice versa).

From Table 4, we observe that CorrNet + MT
is a very strong competitor and gives the best re-
sults. The main reason for this is that over the years
MT has matured enough for language pairs such as
Fr-En and De-En and it can generate almost per-
fect translations for short sentences (such as cap-
tions). In fact, the results for this method are almost
comparable to what we could have hoped for if we
had direct parallel data between Fr-Images and De-
Images (as approximated by the first row in the table
which reports cross-modal retrieval results between
En-Images using direct parallel data between them
for training). However, we would like to argue that
learning a joint embedding for multiple views in-
stead of having multiple pairwise systems is a more
elegant solution and definitely merits further atten-
tion. Further, a “translation system” may not be
available when we are dealing with modalities other
than text (for example, there are no audio-to-video
translation systems). In such cases, BridgeCorrNet
could still be employed. In this context, the perfor-
mance of BridgeCorrNet is definitely promising and
shows that a model which jointly learns represen-
tations for multiple views can perform better than
methods which learn pair-wise common representa-
tions (2-CorrNet).

6.1 Qualitative Analysis

To get a qualitative feel for our model’s perfor-
mance, we refer the reader to Table 5 and 6. The first
row in Table 5 shows an image and its top-5 nearest
German captions (based on Euclidean distance be-
tween their common representations). As per our

parallel image caption test set, only the second and
fourth caption actually correspond to this image.
However, we observe that the first and fifth cap-
tion are also semantically very related to the image.
Both these captions talk about horses, grass or wa-
ter body (ocean), etc. Similarly the last row in Table
5 shows an image and its top-5 nearest French cap-
tions. None of these captions actually correspond
to the image as per our parallel image caption test
set. However, clearly the first, third and fourth cap-
tion are semantically very relevant to this image as
all of them talk about baseball. Even the remaining
two captions capture the concept of a sport and ra-
quet. We can make a similar observation from Table
6 where most of the top-5 retrieved images do not
correspond to the French/German caption but they
are semantically very similar. It is indeed impressive
that the model is able to capture such cross modal
semantics between images and French/German even
without any direct parallel data between them.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Bridge Correlational Neu-
ral Networks which can learn common representa-
tions for multiple views even when parallel data is
available only between these views and a pivot view.
Our method performs better than the existing state
of the art approaches on the cross language clas-
sification task and gives very promising results on
the cross modal access task. We also release a new
multilingual image caption benchmark (MIC bench-
mark) which will help in further research in this
field5.
