Abstract 

This report presents the results from the Ma-
chine Transliteration Shared Task conducted 
as part of The Fifth Named Entities Workshop 
(NEWS 2015) held at ACL 2015 in Beijing, 
China. Similar to previous editions of NEWS 
Workshop, the Shared Task featured machine 
transliteration of proper names over 14 differ-
ent language pairs, including 12 different lan-
guages and two different Japanese scripts. A 
total of 6 teams participated in the evaluation, 
submitting 194 standard and 12 non-standard 
runs, involving a diverse variety of translitera-
tion methodologies. Four performance metrics 
were used to report the evaluation results. 
Once again, the NEWS shared task on ma-
chine transliteration has successfully achieved 
its objectives by providing a common ground 
for the research community to conduct com-
parative evaluations of state-of-the-art tech-
nologies that will benefit the future research 
and development in this area.        

1 Introduction 
Names play an important role in the performance 
of most Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
Information Retrieval (IR) applications. They are 
also critical in cross-lingual applications such as 
Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-language 
Information Retrieval (CLIR), as it has been 
shown that system performance correlates posi-
tively with the quality of name conversion across 
languages (Demner-Fushman and Oard 2002, 
Mandl and Womser-Hacker 2005, Hermjakob et 
al. 2008, Udupa et al. 2009). Bilingual dictionar-
ies constitute the traditional source of infor-
mation for name conversion across languages, 
however they offer very limited support due to 
the fact that, in most languages, names are con-
tinuously emerging and evolving.  

All of the above points to the critical need for 
robust Machine Transliteration methods and sys-
tems. During the last decade, significant efforts 
has been conducted by the research community 
to address the problem of machine transliteration 
(Knight and Graehl 1998, Meng et al. 2001, Li et 
al. 2004, Zelenko and Aone 2006, Sproat et al. 
2006, Sherif and Kondrak 2007, Hermjakob et al. 
2008, Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002, Goldwasser 
and Roth 2008, Goldberg and Elhadad 2008, 
Klementiev and Roth 2006, Oh and Choi 2002, 
Virga and Khudanpur 2003, Wan and Verspoor 
1998, Kang and Choi 2000, Gao et al. 2004, Li et 
al. 2009a, Li et al. 2009b). These previous works 
fall into three main categories: grapheme-based, 
phoneme-based and hybrid methods. Grapheme 
based methods (Li et al. 2004) treat translitera-
tion as a direct orthographic mapping and only 
uses orthography-related features while pho-
neme-based methods (Knight and Graehl 1998) 
make use of phonetic correspondences to gener-
ate the transliteration. The hybrid approach refers 
to the combination of several different models or 
knowledge sources to support the transliteration 
generation process. 

The first machine transliteration shared task 
(Li et al. 2009b, Li et al. 2009a) was organized 
and conducted as part of NEWS 2009 at ACL-
IJCNLP 2009. It was the first time that common 
benchmarking data in diverse language pairs was 
provided for evaluating state-of-the-art machine 
transliteration. While the focus of the 2009 
shared task was on establishing the quality met-
rics and on setting up a baseline for translitera-
tion quality based on those metrics, the 2010 
shared task (Li et al. 2010a, Li et al. 2010b) fo-
cused on expanding the scope of the translitera-
tion generation task to about a dozen languages 
and on exploring the quality of the task depend-
ing on the direction of transliteration. In NEWS 
2011 (Zhang et al. 2011a, Zhang et al. 2011b), 

10



the focus was on significantly increasing the 
hand-crafted parallel corpora of named entities to 
include 14 different language pairs from 11 lan-
guage families, and on making them available as 
the common dataset for the shared task. The 
NEWS 2015 Shared Task on Transliteration has 
been a continued effort for evaluating machine 
transliteration performance over such a common 
dataset following the NEWS 2012 (Zhang et al. 
2012) and 2011 shared tasks. 

In this paper, we present in full detail the re-
sults of the NEWS 2015 Machine Transliteration 
Shared Task. The rest of the paper is structured 
as follows. Section 2 provides as short review of 
the main characteristics of the machine translit-
eration task and the corpora used for it. Section 3 
reviews the four metrics used for the evaluations. 
Section 4 reports specific details about participa-
tion in the 2015 edition of the shared task, and 
section 5 presents and discusses the evaluation 
results. Finally, section 6 presents our main con-
clusions and future plans.  

2 Shared Task on Transliteration 
Transliteration, sometimes also called Romaniza-
tion, especially if Latin Scripts are used for target 
strings (Halpern 2007), deals with the conversion 
of names between two languages and/or script 
systems. Within the context of the Transliteration 
Shared Task, we are aiming not only at address-
ing the name conversion process but also its 
practical utility for downstream applications, 
such as MT and CLIR. 

In this sense, we adopt the same definition of 
transliteration as proposed during the NEWS 
2009 workshop (Li et al. 2009a). According to it, 
transliteration is understood as the “conversion 
of a given name in the source language (a text 
string in the source writing system or orthogra-
phy) to a name in the target language (another 
text string in the target writing system or orthog-
raphy” conditioned to the following specific re-
quirements regarding the name representation in 
the target language:  

• it is phonetically equivalent to the source 
name, 

• it conforms to the phonology of the tar-
get language, and 

• it matches the user intuition on its equiv-
alence with respect to the source lan-
guage name.   

Following NEWS 2011 and NEWS 2012, the 
three back-transliteration tasks are maintained. 
Back-transliteration attempts to restore translit-

erated names back into their original source lan-
guage. For instance, the tasks for converting 
western names written in Chinese and Thai back 
into their original English spellings are consid-
ered. Similarly, a task for back-transliterating 
Romanized Japanese names into their original 
Kanji strings is considered too. 

2.1 Shared Task Description 
Following the tradition of NEWS workshop se-
ries, the shared task in NEWS 2015 consists of 
developing machine transliteration systems in 
one or more of the specified language pairs. Each 
language pair of the shared task consists of a 
source and a target language, implicitly specify-
ing the transliteration direction. Training and 
development data in each of the language pairs 
was made available to all registered participants 
for developing their transliteration systems. 

At the evaluation time, a standard hand-crafted 
test set consisting of between 500 and 3,000 
source names (approximately 5-10% of the train-
ing data size) was released, on which the partici-
pants were required to produce a ranked list of 
transliteration candidates in the target language 
for each source name. The system output is test-
ed against a reference set (which may include 
multiple correct transliterations for some source 
names), and the performance of a system is cap-
tured in multiple metrics (defined in Section 3), 
each designed to capture a specific performance 
dimension. 

For every language pair, each participant was 
required to submit at least one run (designated as 
a “standard” run) that uses only the data provided 
by the NEWS workshop organizers in that lan-
guage pair; i.e. no other data or linguistic re-
sources are allowed for standard runs. This en-
sures parity between systems and enables mean-
ingful comparison of performance of various al-
gorithmic approaches in a given language pair. 
Participants were allowed to submit one or more 
standard runs for each task they participated in. 
If more than one standard runs were submitted, it 
was required to name one of them as a “primary” 
run, which was the one used to compare results 
across different systems.  

In addition, more than one “non-standard” 
runs could be submitted for every language pair 
using either data beyond the one provided by the 
shared task organizers, any other available lin-
guistic resources in a specific language pair, or 
both. This essentially enabled participants to de-
monstrate the limits of performance of their sys-
tems in a given language pair. 

11



2.2 Shared Task Corpora 
Two specific constraints were considered when 
selecting languages for the shared task: language 
diversity and data availability. To make the 
shared task interesting and to attract wider partic-
ipation, it is important to ensure a reasonable 
variety among the languages in terms of linguis-
tic diversity, orthography and geography. Clear-
ly, the ability of procuring and distributing a rea-
sonably large (approximately 10K paired names 
for training and testing together) hand-crafted 
corpora consisting primarily of paired names is 
critical for this process. Following NEWS 2011, 
the 14 tasks shown in Tables 1.a-e were used (Li 
et al. 2004, Kumaran and Kellner 2007, MSRI 
2009, CJKI 2010). Additionally, the test sets 
from NEWS 2012 (each of size 1K) were also 
used for evaluation purposes in this shared task. 

The names given in the training sets for Chi-
nese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Persian and He-
brew languages are Western names and their re-
spective transliterations; the Japanese Name (in 
English) → Japanese Kanji data set consists only 
of native Japanese names; the Arabic data set 
consists only of native Arabic names. The Indic 
data set (Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Bangla) con-
sists of a mix of Indian and Western names. 

For all of the tasks chosen, we have been able 
to procure paired-name data between the source 
and the target scripts and were able to make them 
available to the participants. For some language 
pairs, such as the case of English-Chinese and 
English-Thai, there are both transliteration and 
back-transliteration tasks. Most of the tasks are 
just one-way transliteration, although Indian data 
sets contains a mixture of names from both Indi-
an and Western origins.  

3 Evaluation Metrics and Rationale 
The participants have been asked to submit 
standard and, optionally, non-standard runs. One 
of the standard runs must be named as the prima-
ry submission, which was the one used for the 
performance summary. Each run must contain a 
ranked list of up to ten candidate transliterations 
for each source name. The submitted results are 
compared to the ground truth (reference translit-
erations) using four evaluation metrics capturing 
different aspects of transliteration performance. 
The four considered evaluation metrics are: 

• Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC),  
• Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-score),  
• Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and  
• Mean Average Precision (MAPref).

In the next subsections, we present a brief de-
scription of the four considered evaluation met-
rics. The following notation is further assumed: 

• N : Total number of names (source 
words) in the test set, 

• ni : Number of reference transliterations 
for i-th name in the test set (ni ≥ 1), 

• ri,j : j-th reference transliteration for i-th 
name in the test set, 

• ci,k : k-th candidate transliteration (sys-
tem output) for i-th name in the test set 
(1 ≤ k ≤ 10), 

• Ki : Number of candidate transliterations 
produced by a transliteration system. 

3.1 Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC) 
Also known as Word Error Rate, it measures cor-
rectness of the first transliteration candidate in 
the candidate list produced by a transliteration 
system. ACC = 1 means that all top candidates 
are correct transliterations; i.e. they match one of 
the references, and ACC = 0 means that none of 
the top candidates are correct. 

𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 1
𝑁
∑ � 1 𝑖𝑓 ∃𝑟𝑖,𝑗 ∶ 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 = 𝑐𝑖,1 ;

 0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒                
�𝑁𝑖=1   (Eq.1) 

3.2 Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-score) 
The Mean F-score measures how different, on 
average, the top transliteration candidate is from 
its closest reference. F-score for each source 
word is a function of Precision and Recall and 
equals 1 when the top candidate matches one of 
the references, and 0 when there are no common 
characters between the candidate and any of the 
references. 

Precision and Recall are calculated based on 
the length of the Longest Common Subsequence 
(LCS) between a candidate and a reference: 

𝐿𝐶𝑆(𝑐, 𝑟) = 1
2
�|𝑐| + |𝑟| − 𝐸𝐷(𝑐, 𝑟)�  (Eq.2) 

where ED is the edit distance and |x| is the length 
of x. For example, the longest common subse-
quence between “abcd” and “afcde” is “acd” and 
its length is 3. The best matching reference, i.e. 
the reference for which the edit distance has the 
minimum, is taken for calculation. If the best 
matching reference is given by  

𝑟𝑖,𝑚 = arg𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑗 �𝐸𝐷�𝑐𝑖,1, 𝑟𝑖,𝑗��  (Eq.3) 

the Recall, Precision and F-score for the i-th 
word are calculated as:  

𝑅𝑖 =
𝐿𝐶𝑆�𝑐𝑖,1,𝑟𝑖,𝑚�

�𝑟𝑖,𝑚�
  (Eq.4) 

𝑃𝑖 =
𝐿𝐶𝑆�𝑐𝑖,1,𝑟𝑖,𝑚�

�𝑐𝑖,1�
  (Eq.5) 

𝐹𝑖 = 2
𝑅𝑖×𝑃𝑖
𝑅𝑖+𝑃𝑖

  (Eq.6) 

The lengths are computed with respect to dis-
tinct Unicode characters, and no distinctions are 
made for different character types of a language 
(e.g. vowel vs. consonant vs. combining diereses, 
etc.).  

3.3 Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) 
Measures traditional MRR for any right answer 
produced by the system, from among the candi-
dates. 1/MRR tells approximately the average 
rank of the correct transliteration. MRR closer to 
1 implies that the correct answer is mostly pro-
duced close to the top of the n-best lists.  

𝑅𝑅𝑖 = �

�  (Eq.7) 

𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 1
𝑁
∑ 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑁𝑖=1   (Eq.8) 

3.4 Mean Average Precision (MAPref) 
This metric measures tightly the precision in the 
n-best candidates for i-th source name, for which 
reference transliterations are available. If all of 
the references are produced, then the MAP is 1. 
If we denote the number of correct candidates for 
the i-th source word in k-best list as num(i,k), 
then MAPref is given by:  

𝑀𝐴𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑓 =

4 Participation in the Shared Task 
A total of six teams from six different institutions 
participated in the NEWS 2015 Shared Task. 
More specifically, the participating teams were 
from University of Alberta (UALB), Uppsala 
University (UPPS), Beijing Jiaotong University 
(BJTU), the National Institute of Information and 
Communications Technology (NICT), the Indian 
Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and the 
National Taiwan University (NTU). 

Teams were required to submit at least one 
standard run for every task they participated in, 
and for both, NEWS 2011 and NEWS 2012, test 
sets. The former was used as a progress evalua-
tion set and the latter as the official NEWS 2015 
evaluation set. In total, we received 97 standard 
and 6 non-standard runs for each test set; i.e. 194 
standard and 12 non-standard runs in total. Table 
2 summarizes the number of standard runs, non-
standard runs and teams participating per task.

Table 2: Number of standard (Std) and non-
standard (Non) runs submitted, and teams par-

ticipating in each task. 

As seen from the table, the most popular task 
continues to be the transliteration from English 
to Chinese (Zhang et al. 2012), followed by Chi-
nese to English, English to Hindi, and English to 
Tamil. Non-standard runs were only submitted 
for 6 of the 14 tasks.  

5 Task Results and Analysis 
Figure 1 summarizes the results of the NEWS 
2015 Shared Task. In the figure, only F-scores 
over the NEWS 2012 evaluation test set (referred 
to as NEWS12/15) for all primary standard sub-
missions are depicted. A total of 41 primary 
standard submissions were received. 

As seen from the figure, with the exception of 
the English to Japanese Katakana, only translit-
eration tasks involving Arabic, Persian and the 
four considered Indian languages are consistently 
scored above 80%. For the rest of the languages, 
with the exception of Japanese Katakana and 
Hebrew, scores are consistently in the range from 
60% to 80%. Notice also that, regardless the 
availability of training data, the English to Chi-
nese transliteration task seems to be the more 
demanding one for state-of-the-art systems with 
respect to the considered metric. 

Another interesting observation that can be de-
rived from the figure, when looking to the lan-
guage pairs English-Chinese and English-Thai, is 
that systems tend to perform slightly better for 
the case of back-transliteration tasks.

A much more comprehensive presentation of 
results for the NEWS 2015 Shared Task is pro-
vided in the Appendix at the end of this paper. 
There, resulting scores are reported for all re-
ceived submissions, including standard and non-
standard submissions, over both the progress test 
(NEWS11) and evaluation test (NEWS12/15), 
and the four considered evaluation metrics. All 
results are presented in 28 tables, each of which 
reports the scores for one transliteration task over 
one test set. In the tables, all primary standard 
runs are highlighted in bold-italic fonts.  

Regarding the systems participating in this 
year evaluation, the UALB’s system (Nicolai et 
al. 2015) was based on multiple system combina-
tions. They presented experimental results in-
volving three different well-known translitera-
tion approaches: DirecTL+ (Jiampojamarn et al. 
2009), Sequitur (Bisani and Ney 2008) and SMT 
(Koehn et al. 2007). They showed error reduc-
tions of up to 20% over a baseline system by us-
ing system combination. 

The UPPS’s system (Shao et al. 2015) imple-
mented a phrase-based transliteration approach, 
which is enhanced with refined alignments pro-
duced by the M2M-aligner (Jiampojamarn et al. 
2007). They also implemented a ranking mecha-
nism based on a linear regression, showing a sig-
nificant improvement on both EnCh and ChEn 
transliteration tasks.   

The BJTU’s system (Wang et al. 2015a) im-
plemented an SMT (Koehn et al. 2007) log linear 
model combination for transliteration, including 
standard SMT features such as a language model 
scores and forward and reverse phrase translation 
probabilities, as well as other specific translitera-
tion features such as length of names and length 
of name penalties. 

The NICT’s system (Finch et al. 2015) builds 
upon their previous SMT-based system used for 
NEWS 2012 (Finch et al. 2012). In this shared 
task, the previous system rescoring step is aug-
mented with a neural network based translitera-
tion model (Bahdanau et al. 2014). They showed 
significant improvements in 8 of the 14 translit-
eration tasks with respect to their 2012 system. 

The ITTB’s system (Kunchukuttan and Bhat-
tacharyya 2015) also followed the SMT approach 
to transliteration. In this case they include two 
specific preprocessing enhancements: the addi-
tion of word-boundary markers, and a language-
independent overlapping character segmentation. 
They observed that word-boundary markers sub-
stantially improved transliteration accuracy, and 
overlapping segmentation showed some potential.        

The NTU’s system (Wang et al. 2015b) is 
based on DirecTL+ with alignments generated by 
the M2M-aligner (Jiampojamarn et al. 2010). In 
preprocessing, they experimented with different 
grapheme segmentation methods for English, 
Chinese and Korean; while in post-processing, 
they evaluated two re-ranking approaches: ortho-
graphy similarity ranking and web-based ranking.   

As seen from the previous system descriptions, 
phrase-based SMT approaches are still predomi-
nant in the state-of-the-art for machine translit-
eration. Significant improvements are achieved 
by incorporating novel approaches in the prepro-
cessing and post-processing stages, as well as by 
system combinations. Regarding pre-processing, 
the main focus was on segmentation, while in 
post-processing, using neural networks for res-
coring provided the most significant gains.    

Finally, figure 2 compares, in terms of Mean 
F-scores, the best primary standard submissions 
in NEWS 2012 with the ones in NEWS 2015.  

 
Figure 2: Mean F-scores (Top-1) on the evalua-
tion test set (NEWS12/15) for the best primary 

standard submissions in 2012 and 2015. 

As seen from the figure, in most of the consid-
ered transliteration tasks, some incremental im-
provements can be observed between the 2012 
and 2015 shared tasks. The most significant im-
provements are in those tasks involving Japanese 
Katakana, Tamil, Bangla (Bengali) and Thai.  

Regarding the observed drops in performance, 
only the one for the English to Korean Hangul 
task is significant. It is mainly due to the fact that 
the best performing system for this task in 2012 
did not participate in the 2015 shared task.

6 Conclusions 
The Shared Task on Machine Transliteration in 
NEWS 2015 has shown, once again, that the re-
search community has a continued interest in this 
area. This report summarizes the results of the 
NEWS 2015 Shared Task.  

We are pleased to report a comprehensive set 
of machine transliteration approaches and their 
evaluation results over two test sets: progress test 
(NEWS11) and evaluation test (NEWS12/15), as 
well as two conditions: standard runs and non-
standard runs. While the standard runs allow for 
conducting meaningful comparisons across dif-
ferent algorithms, the non-standard runs open up 
more opportunities for exploiting a variety of 
additional linguistic resources.  

Six teams from six different institutions part-
icipated in the shared task. In total, we received 
97 standard and 6 non-standard runs for each test 
set; i.e. 194 standard and 12 non-standard runs in 
total. Most of the current state-of-the-art in ma-
chine transliteration is represented in the systems 
that have participated in the shared task. 

Encouraged by the continued success of the 
NEWS workshop series, we plan to continue this 
event in the future to further promoting machine 
transliteration research and development. 

Acknowledgments 

The organizers of the NEWS 2015 Shared Task 
would like to thank the Institute for Infocomm 
Research (Singapore), Microsoft Research India, 
CJK Institute (Japan), National Electronics and 
Computer Technology Center (Thailand) and 
Sarvnaz Karim / RMIT for providing the corpora 
and technical support. Without those, the Shared 
Task would not be possible. We also want to 
thank all programme committee members for 
their valuable comments that improved the quali-
ty of the shared task papers. Finally, we wish to 
thank all participants for their active participa-
tion, which have made again the NEWS Machine 
Transliteration Shared Task a successful one.
