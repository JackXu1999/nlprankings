Abstract

In this talk, I will first present recent work on domain debiasing in the context of language
identification, then discuss a new line of work on language variety analysis in the form of dialect
map generation. Finally, I will reflect on the interplay between time and space on language
variation, and speculate on how these can be captured in a single model.
