Abstract

The study of linguistic typology is rooted in
the implications we find between linguistic
features, such as the fact that languages with
object-verb word ordering tend to have post-
positions. Uncovering such implications typi-
cally amounts to time-consuming manual pro-
cessing by trained and experienced linguists,
which potentially leaves key linguistic univer-
sals unexplored. In this paper, we present a
computational model which successfully iden-
tifies known universals, including Greenberg
universals, but also uncovers new ones, wor-
thy of further linguistic investigation. Our ap-
proach outperforms baselines previously used
for this problem, as well as a strong baseline
from knowledge base population.

1 Introduction

Linguistic typology is concerned with mapping out
the relationships between languages with reference
to structural and functional properties (Croft, 2002).
A typologist may ask, for instance, how a language
encodes syntactic features and relationships. Does
it place its verbs before objects or after, and does it
have prepositions or postpositions? It is well estab-
lished that many features of languages are highly
correlated, sometimes to the extent that they imply
each other. Based on this observation, Greenberg
(1963) establishes the notion of implicational uni-
versals, i.e., cases where the presence of one feature
strictly implies the presence of another.

Universals are important to investigate as they of-
fer insight into the inner workings of language and
define the space of plausible languages. Universals
can aid cognitive scientists examining the underly-
ing processes of language, as there arguably is a
cognitive reason for why, e.g., languages with OV
ordering are postpositional (Greenberg, 1963). In
the context of natural language processing (NLP),
when creating synthetic data for multilingual NLP,

graphical model. Observing the features in the left-
most nodes (SV, OV, and Noun-Adjective), can we cor-
rectly infer the value of the right-most node (SVO)?

one should consider universals to maintain the plau-
sibility of the data (Wang and Eisner, 2016). Com-
putational typology can furthermore be used to in-
duce language representations, useful in, e.g., lan-
guage modelling (Östling and Tiedemann, 2017)
and syntactic parsing (de Lhoneux et al., 2018).

In this paper, we argue that the deterministic
Greenbergian view of implications (Greenberg,
1963) is outdated. Instead, we suggest that a proba-
bilistic view of implications is more suitable, and
define the notion of a probabilistic typological im-
plication as a certain conditional probability dis-
tribution. We do this by first placing a joint distri-
bution over the vector of typological features, and
then marginalising out all features other than the
two under consideration. This computation is made
tractable by learning a tree-structured graphical
model (Figure 1) with the PC algorithm of Neapoli-
tan (2004) and then applying the belief propagation
(BP) algorithm (Pearl, 1982). We draw inspira-
tion from manual linguistic efforts to this problem
(Greenberg, 1963; Lehmann, 1978), as well as from
previous computational methods (Daumé III and
Campbell, 2007; Bjerva et al., 2019a). Addition-
ally, we provide a qualitative analysis of predicted
implications, as well as performing an empirical
evaluation on typological feature prediction, com-

paring to strong baselines.

2 From A Generative Model to
Probabilistic Implications

Notation. We now seek a probabilistic formali-
sation of typological implications. First, we will
introduce the relevant notation. Let ` be a language.
We will seek to explain the observed, language-
specific binary vector of typological features, or
parameters, π` where π`i = 1 indicates that the i

th

typological feature is “on” in language `. When
it is unambiguous, we will drop the superscript `.
Note that we call the vector π due to a spiritual sim-
ilarity to the principle-and-parameters framework
of Chomsky (1981).

A Generative Model of Typology. We construct
a simple generative probability model over the the
vector of typological features π, which factorises
according to some tree structure T . We will dis-
cuss the provenance of T below. Concretely, this
distribution is defined as

p(π) =

|π|∏
i=1

p(πi | paT [πi]) (1)

where paT [·] is a function that returns the par-
ents of πi, if any, in the tree T . Each condi-
tional p(πi | paT [πi]) is treated tabularly with one
parameter per table entry: each table entry is a
unique configuration of the feature πi and its par-
ents paT [πi]. We place a symmetric Dirichlet prior
with concentration parameter α = 5, over each of
p(πi | paT [πi])’s table entries. This corresponds to
add-5 smoothing.

Probabilistic Implications. Although the orig-
inal Greenbergian view of implications is deter-
ministic, we argue that a probabilistic approach is
more suitable. Indeed, logical implications are a
special case of conditional probabilities that only
take the values 0 and 1, rather than values in [0, 1].
Specifically, we argue that probabilistic implica-
tions should take the form of the following condi-
tional probability distribution:

p(πi | πj) =
∑
π′

p(πi,π
′ | πj) (2)

where π′ is a subvector that omits the indices i
and j. In text, our goal is to sum out all possi-
ble languages, holding two typological features,
πi and πj , fixed. We note that since our model p

factorises according to the tree T , this sum may
be performed in polynomial time using dynamic
programming, specifically the belief propagation
algorithm (Pearl, 1982). Note that we contend this
improves upon the ideas of Daumé III and Camp-
bell (2007), who only considered pair-wise inter-
actions of features: Our definition of probabilistic
implications marginalises out all other features.

Discovering Probabilistic Implications. How
can we use a generative model to discover typo-
logical implications? What we would like to know
is how often p(πi | πj) is significantly different
than p(πi). We note that p(πi) can also be com-
puted with BP. We now reduce the search for ty-
pological implications as asking when the quantity
|p(πi | πj) − p(πi)| is statistically significantly
greater than 0. Given a sufficiently expressive gen-
erative model p, this allows for a richer notion of
implication than Greenberg original proposed, as it
admits the softer notion of typological influence.

Learning the Structure of p. There are many
ways to learn the tree structure T , and we choose
the PC algorithm of Neapolitan (2004). This algo-
rithm works in two steps—first, it learns a skeleton
graph from the data (in our case, a typological data
base), with undirected edges. Next, it orients these
edges so as to form a directed acyclic graph. Once
we have fit this graph so as to represent p(π), we
are left with a tractable model we can use to predict
held-out typological features and discover typolog-
ical implications.

Parameter Estimation. We apply maximum a
posteriori (MAP) inference in order to estimate the
parameters of our model. If all the data were ob-
served, i.e. there were no missing values in WALS,
this could be achieved by counting and normalising
across the typological database in question with the
previously mentioned Dirichlet prior. (The prior
simply corresponds to add-λ smoothing.) However,
in many cases we do have missing data. In fact,
we almost never observe all the values in WALS.
Thus, we must rely on expectation-maximisation to
perform MAP estimation (Dempster et al., 1977).
The gist of the algorithm is simple: we compute
“pseudocounts” for the missing entries using belief
propagation, which we smooth as if they had been
observed values. Using these pseudocounts, we
get a new estimate of the parameters by count-and-
divide as in the fully supervised case. We iterate
between updating the pseudocounts and perform-

in the world (WALS, Dryer and Haspelmath (2013)).

ing count-and-divide. This is a standard technique
in the literature.

Decoding. In section 4, we are interested in pre-
dicting typological features given others. If we
wish to predict πi given observed features for a
language πobs, we compute

π?i = argmax p(πi | πobs) (3)

= argmax
∑
πunobs

p(πi,πunobs | πobs) (4)

where we marginalize out all those features πunobs
unobserved or held out in a given language. The
conditional may be computed with belief propa-
gation and the argmax is over the set {0, 1}. This
makes the computation tractable.

3 WALS: A Typological Database

Before explaining our experimental setup, we first
explain the data set we use in evaluation. We eval-
uate on the World Atlas of Language Structure
(WALS, Dryer and Haspelmath (2013), which is
the largest openly available typological database.
It comprises approximately 200 linguistic features
with annotations for more than 2,500 languages.
These annotations have been made by expert typol-
ogists through meticulous study of grammars and
field work. WALS is quite sparse, however, as only
100 of these languages have annotations for all fea-
tures. For instance, Figure 2 shows the distribution
of consonant inventory sizes across the languages
for which this feature is annotated. Although this
is not our main contribution, the fact that we can
predict held-out features offers a way to fill in the
feature value gaps which exist for the vast majority
of languages.

Pre-processing We pre-process our data simi-
larly to Daumé III and Campbell (2007). We fil-

ter out features which are not encoded for at least
100 languages, and feature values which occur for
fewer than 10% of the languages. The reason for
this is that any implications found for exceedingly
rare features is likely to be inconclusive. We fur-
ther follow Daumé III and Campbell (2007) in that
we binarise features with more than 7 feature val-
ues such that they simply encode whether or not a
language has a feature. For instance, features are
not likely to have implicants determining the num-
ber of tones, but rather the presence or absence of
tones. Finally, they take into account that languages
are not independent, as phylogenetic similarity can
help infer features in closely related languages. We
do not use this information, as we are interested in
finding implications which ought to be independent
of language relatedness.

4 Two Typological Experiments

In order to evaluate our probabilistic approach to
typological implications, we define two tasks. Our
empirical evaluation is based on predicting fea-
tures so as to get an objective measure of our model,
which is comparable both to previous work and
other strong baselines. Second, we include a quali-
tative evaluation, as we are interested in uncover-
ing both known and novel typological implications.

4.1 Predicting Typological Features

Feature prediction is a commonly used task in eval-
uating how well a given model is able to explain



3927

the typological features of languages (Daumé III
and Campbell, 2007; Malaviya et al., 2017; Cot-
terell and Eisner, 2018; Ponti et al., 2018; Bjerva
et al., 2019a). This is an important task which can
highlight the extent to which a model has learned
interdependencies between languages and features.
We include this evaluation to first show that our
model has predictive power which surpasses strong
baselines, before investigating the main research
question of this work, i.e., the extent to which we
can uncover probabilistic implications. We evalu-
ate the models on feature prediction by fitting our
model on 80% of the languages in WALS, and leav-
ing out 10% of the languages for development and
testing, respectively.

We split our evaluation of our model up across
the feature categories present in WALS. These
cover areas such as phonology, morphology etc.,
listed in Table 1. During the typological feature
prediction experiments, we consider a single such
WALS category at a time.We vary the number of
implicants by allowing the model to observe 2
to 6 features from within this category as well as
the values of features in other categories. This
is done as having access to, e.g., all word-order
features when predicting a final word order feature
would be much easier than our setting. Hence,
our experiment will show the extent to which
increasing the number of features from the current
feature category affects predictive power. We vary
the number of implicants k from 2 to 6 features in
each category with a total of n features, this gives
us
(
n
k

)
total sets per number of implicants k. For

each such set, we attempt to predict all held-out
features in that category in a leave-one-out-style
evaluation. This results in

(
n
k

)
(n− k) predictions

to make per category per number of implicants
k. Performance is measured by averaging the
accuracy of predictions of all held-out features
over the entire test set, across categories.

Baseline #1: Most frequent Since many typo-
logical features have low-entropy distributions, a
most frequent class baseline is a relatively strong
lower bound for prediction of typological features.
For instance, this yields an accuracy of 45% when
predicting the canonical subject–object–verb order-
ing in a language.

Baseline #2: Pairwise prediction We imple-
ment a simple baseline based on pairwise predic-
tion of typological features. This is inspired by the

approach in Daumé III and Campbell (2007). As
this code was not publicly available we provide our
own non-Bayesian implementation.

Baseline #3: PRA Since WALS can be seen as
a knowledge base, we apply a strong baseline from
the field of knowledge base population. Path Rank-
ing Algorithm (PRA) is an algorithm which finds
relation paths by traversing the knowledge graph,
which can then be used to predict implicatures
and feature values (Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao
et al., 2011).1 We train PRA using the standard
hyperparameters of the existing implementation,
which includes regularising with `1 = 0.001 and
`2 = 0.001, as well as using negative sampling.

Baseline #4: Language embeddings Although
we aim to predict implications, and not only fea-
ture values, we compare with previous work on
predicting typological features in WALS (Bjerva
and Augenstein, 2018a). As their setup is different,
we use their highest reported score as a baseline.

Feature Prediction Results. Table 1 contains
the results from feature prediction across the chap-
ters outlined in WALS. Our implementation is able
to predict features across categories above baseline
levels. At increasing numbers of implicants, pre-
diction power tends to increase. This is not the case
for all feature categories, however. One such case
is Nominal Syntax, in which performance peaks
at 3 implicants. This is expected, as correlations
only exist between some features, thus at a certain
point access to more typological features no longer
helps performance. Note that although the baseline
numbers are based on predicting the same features
as our model, the baseline models do not observe
the same features during prediction - for instance
Baseline #4 does not make predictions based on
other feature values, but is trained on one feature
at a time.

4.2 Discovering Typological Implications

Having established that our method bests several
competitive baselines for prediction of typologi-
cal features, we next look at what implications our
probabilisation of typology allows us to find. We
search for those conditional probabilities where the
quantity |p(πi | πj)− p(πi)| is statistically signifi-
cantly greater than 0, as found with an independent

two-tailed t-test.2 After adjusting for multiple tests
with the Bonferroni correction, we report those im-
plications where p < 0.05. We report the full list
of implications found by our model in the Supple-
ments and show a subset of these in Table 2.3 We
note that we are able to find the same implications
listed by Daumé III and Campbell (2007), some of
which are listed in the table. These implications
include Greenberg universals (Greenberg, 1963),
showing that our approach to probabilisation of lin-
guistic universals is suitable to replicate previous
work.

Transitivity across implications At first glance,
it is not clear why postpositions should imply SV
word order, as stated in #4. Yet, #2 is a well-
established universal (Greenberg, 1963) and #3
comes with strong statistical evidence: SV order
is much more frequent than VS word order in OV
languages (98.44% of these are predominantly SV).
Our model has thus used transitive reasoning of the
form if A ⊃ B ∧B ⊃ C then A ⊃ C to find #2.

The power of multiple implicants Implications
#10 and #11 concern the order between nouns and
their numeral modifiers. The two main alterna-
tives here, Noun-Numeral and Numeral-Noun are
of comparable frequency in WALS; they occur in
607 and 479 languages, respectively, i.e. Noun-
Numeral holds the majority with only 55%. If we
consider each of the three implicants listed in im-
plication #11 on their own, the strongest statistical

2Future work will make use of a non-parametric test,
whose details we are still working out.

power goes to the Degree word–Adjective feature:
conditioned on this feature, the Numeral-Noun or-
der holds in 79% of the relevant languages. The
combination of all three implicants, on the other
hand, results in a subset of languages with 91%
Numeral-Noun order. The Numeral-Noun order
can thus be implied with considerably more confi-
dence from a combination of multiple implicants.

5 Related Work

Typological implications outline the space of
possible languages, based on evidence from ob-
served languages, as recorded and classified by lin-
guists (Greenberg, 1963; Lehmann, 1978; Hawkins,
1983). While work in this direction has been man-
ual, typological knowledge bases do exist now
(Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013; Partick Littel and
Levin, 2016), which allows for automated discov-
ery of implications. Although previous computa-
tional work exists (Daumé III and Campbell, 2007),
we are the first to introduce a probabilisation of
typological implications.

In addition to work on finding implications based
on known features, there is an increasing amount
of work on computational methods to discovering
typological features (Ponti et al., 2018). Work in
this area includes unsupervised discovery of word
order (Östling, 2015) or other linguistic features
(Asgari and Schütze, 2017), typological probing
of language representations (Bjerva et al., 2019b;
Beinborn and Choenni, 2019), and several papers
attempt to predict typological features in WALS
(Georgi et al., 2010; Malaviya et al., 2017; Bjerva
and Augenstein, 2018a,b; Cotterell and Eisner,
2017, 2018; Bjerva et al., 2019a).

6 Conclusions

We defined the notion of probabilistic implications,
and presented a computational model which suc-
cessfully identifies known universals, including
Greenberg universals, but also uncovers new ones,
worthy of further investigation by typologists. Ad-
ditionally, our approach outperforms strong base-
lines for prediction of typological features.
