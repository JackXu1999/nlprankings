Abstract

In this paper, we present the report and findings of the Shared Task on Aggression Identification
organised as part of the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC - 1)
at COLING 2018. The task was to develop a classifier that could discriminate between Overtly
Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive, and Non-aggressive texts. For this task, the participants were
provided with a dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments each in
Hindi (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English for training and validation. For testing,
two different sets - one from Facebook and another from a different social media - were provided.
A total of 130 teams registered to participate in the task, 30 teams submitted their test runs,
and finally 20 teams also sent their system description paper which are included in the TRAC
workshop proceedings. The best system obtained a weighted F-score of 0.64 for both Hindi and
English on the Facebook test sets, while the best scores on the surprise set were 0.60 and 0.50
for English and Hindi respectively. The results presented in this report depict how challenging
the task is. The positive response from the community and the great levels of participation in the
first edition of this shared task also highlights the interest in this topic.

1 Introduction

In the last decade, with the emergence of an interactive web and especially popular social networking
and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, there has been an exponential increase in the
user-generated content being made available over the web. Now any information online has the power
to reach billions of people within a matter of seconds. This has resulted in not only positive exchange of
ideas but has also lead to a widespread dissemination of aggressive and potentially harmful content over
the web. While most of the potentially harmful incidents like bullying or hate speech have predated the
Internet, the reach and extent of Internet has given these incidents an unprecedented power and influence
to affect the lives of billions of people. It has been reported that these incidents have not only created
mental and psychological agony to the users of the web but has in fact forced people to deactivate their
accounts and in extreme cases also commit suicides (Hinduja and Patchin, 2010). Thus the incidents of
aggression and unratified verbal behaviour have not remained a minor nuisance, but have acquired the
form of a major criminal activity that affects a large number of people. It is therefore important that
preventive measures can be taken to cope with abusive behaviour aggression online.

One of the strategies to cope with aggressive behaviour online is to manually monitor and moderate
user-generated content, however, the amount and pace at which new data is being created on the web has
rendered manual methods of moderation and intervention almost completely impractical. As such the
use (semi-) automatic methods to identify such behaviour has become important and has attracted more
attention from the research community in recent years (Davidson et al., 2017; Malmasi and Zampieri,
2017).

This paper reports the results of the first Shared Task on Aggression Identification which was organised
jointly with the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC - 1) at COLING 2018.

2 Related Work

Verbal aggression per se has been rarely explored within the field of Natural Language Processing.
However, previous research in the field has been carried out to automatically recognise several related
behaviour such as trolling (Cambria et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2014; Mojica, 2016; Mihaylov et al.,
2015) , cyberbullying (Dinakar et al., 2012; Nitta et al., 2013; Dadvar et al., 2013; Dadvar et al., 2014;
Hee et al., 2015), flaming / insults (Sax, 2016; Nitin et al., 2012), abusive / offensive language (Chen et
al., 2012; Nobata et al., 2016; Waseem et al., 2017), hate speech (Pinkesh Badjatiya and Varma, 2017;
Burnap and Williams, 2014; Davidson et al., 2017; Vigna et al., 2017; Djuric et al., 2015; Fortana,
2017; Gitari et al., 2015; Malmasi and Zampieri, 2018; Waseem and Hovy, 2016; Schmidt and Wie-
gand, 2017), radicalization (Agarwal and Sureka, 2015; Agarwal and Sureka, 2017), racism (Greevy and
Smeaton, 2004; Greevy, 2004) and others. In addition to these, there have been some pragmatic studies
on behaviour like trolling (Hardaker, 2010; Hardaker, 2013).

This huge interest in the field from different perspectives has created a conglomeration of terminolo-
gies as well as understandings of the phenomenon. On the one hand, this provides us with a very rich
and extensive insight into the phenomena yet, on the other hand, it has also created a theoretical gap
in the understanding of interrelationship among these. Moreover, it has also resulted in duplication of
research, to certain extent, and a certain kind of lack of focus and reusability of datasets across different
strands of research. In order to make improvements towards solving a complex phenomenon like this,
it is of utmost importance that some kind of uniform understanding of problem be achieved so that, at
least, standardised datasets and an understanding of different approaches to solving the problem may be
developed.

While a large part of the research has focused on any one of these phenomena and their computational
processing, it seems there is a significant overlap among these phenomenon in the way they are under-
stood in these studies - and because of this underlying overlap, insights from different studies might
prove useful for solving these seemingly different phenomena. All of these behaviours are considered
undesirable, aggressive and detrimental for those on the receiving end. So, trolling is intended “to cause
disruption and/or to trigger or exacerbate conflict for the purposes of their own amusement” (Hardaker,
2010). Cyberbullying is “humiliating and slandering behavior towards other people” (Nitta et al., 2013).
Flaming intends “to offend someone through e-mail, posting, commenting or any statement using insults,
swearing and hostile, intense language, trolling, etc.” (Krol, 1992).

Waseem et al. (2017) makes an attempt to unify these different trends of research in what may be con-
sidered a significantly overlapping field and proposes a 2-way typology for understanding what they call
’abusive language’ over the web. They propose 2 scales on which abusive language could be categorised
- the target of the abuse (an individual or a group) and the nature of the language (explicit or implicit).
Our classification of aggression into overt and covert aggression is largely similar to the explicit-implicit
distinction. However, we make a more detailed distinction in relation to the target of the abuse (Kumar
et al., 2018b) and it is not made along the axis of individual vs. group. This is so because we noticed
in a large number of instances both individuals and groups are simultaneously targeted - in such cases
individuals are targeted as members of certain groups or the individuals’ actions were considered those
of the group and became the locus of attack. As such it was not feasible to distinguish between the
individual and group attack in lot of instances while annotating the dataset. The distinction that we made
was related to the “locus” of attack and included such targets as gender, religion, caste, country of origin,
race, etc. This classification, on the one hand, gave scope for focusing on different kinds of attack (for
example, racial attacks or communal attacks) and, on the other hand, each of these targets may actually
be attacked using a different set of vocabulary, thereby, making these more natural classes that could be
classified using the surface-level linguistic features. Of course, it cannot be denied that these targets are
not mutually exclusive and, as such, it makes the problem not just a multi-class classification problem
but also multi-label classification problem. In addition to this, we also make use of a different terminol-



3

ogy taking into account its use within socio-pragmatics. This was done with an understanding that huge
amount of literature within the field of aggression and impoliteness studies might be able to contribute
and provide insights to understanding the phenomenon in a better way.

The aim of this shared task was much simpler than the one discussed in the previous para. It only
involved classification of the texts into 3 categories - overt aggression, covert aggression and non-
aggression. We wanted to use the dataset for experimenting with different approaches to make the most
top-level classification of aggression on social media.

3 Task Setup and Schedule

The participants interested in competing in the shared task were required to register using a Google Form.
The form gave them an option to participate for either English or Hindi or both the languages. All the
registered participants were sent the links to the annotated dataset in the language(s) of their choice, along
with a description of the format of the dataset. The participants were allowed to use additional data for
training the system, with the condition that the additional dataset should be either publicly available or
make available immediately after submission (and well before the submission of the system papers) and
this must be mentioned in the submission. Use of non-public additional data for training was not allowed.
The participants were given around 6 weeks to experiment and develop the system. However, since more
than half of the participants registered after the first release of the data, most of them got less time than
this. Initially, the dataset was not released publicly but was emailed only to the registered participants.
After the 6 weeks of release of train and dev sets, the test set was released and the participants had 5 days
to test and upload their system. The complete timeline of the shared task is given in Table 1. We made
use of CodaLab 1 for the evaluation. Each team was allowed to submit up to 3 systems for evaluation.
We used the best of the 3 runs for the final ranking and evaluation of the systems.

4 Dataset

The participants of the shared task were provided with a dataset of 12,000 randomly sampled Face-
book comments for training and 3,000 comments for development and in English and Hindi each, an-
notated with 3 levels of aggression - Overtly Aggressive (OAG), Covertly Aggressive (CAG) and Non-
Aggressive (NAG). For test, 916 English comments and 970 Hindi comments were provided. Addi-
tionally, 1,257 English tweets and 1,194 Hindi tweets were given as the surprise test set 2. The dataset
released for the task is a subset of a larger dataset discussed in Kumar et al. (2018b).

4.1 Issues with the Dataset

While most of the participants considered the dataset to be of high quality, two major problems came up
during the task -

• The language issue: Some of the comments in English dataset contained code-mixed Hindi-English
data as well as data from other languages like German. These formed a minuscule proportion of the
data but nevertheless these need to be filtered out.

• The annotation issue: The second and more serious issue that was raised by some participants
is related to the the annotation itself. Several instances of supposedly inaccurate annotation were
pointed out. Despite the fact that aggression is a highly subjective phenomenon and different anno-
tators may have different judgments about the same comment, some of the annotation indeed looked
highly implausible and consequently it needs further scrutiny and validation.

5 Participants and Approaches

The shared task gave the participants an option to register for either one of the two languages - English
or Hindi - or both. A total of 131 participants registered for the shared task, with 73 teams registering
to participate only in English track, 2 teams only in Hindi track and 56 teams registered to participate
in both the tracks. Out of these, finally a total of 30 teams submitted their systems - 15 teams for both
English and Hindi and 30 teams for only English track. All the systems who submitted their system
were invited to submit the system description paper, describing the experiments conducted by them. 18
participants submitted the final description paper which are included in the workshop proceedings - it
included papers by majority of the top 10 teams. Table 2, lists the participating teams and the language
they took part in.

Next we give a short description of the approach taken by each team for building their system. More
details about the approaches could be found in the paper submitted by the respective teams.

• saroyehun system gives the best performance with LSTM and they resorted to translation as data
augmentation strategy. With the surprise twitter set, a combination of the representations of the
RNN and CNN as features, along with additional preprocessing like spelling correction, translation
of emoji, and computation of sentiment score gave the best performance. In this case, the dataset
was also augmented using translation and pseudolabelled using an external dataset on hate speech.3

This is the only approach in the competition that performs better on the Twitter dataset, despite
being trained the Facebook dataset, thereby, depicting the ability of the approach to generalise
across domain.

• EBSI-LIA-UNAM system uses a combination of the Passive-Aggressive (PA) and SVM classifiers
with character based n-gram (1 - 5 grams) TF-IDF for feature representation.

• DA-LD-Hildesheim uses LSTM with pretrained Fasttext vector for embeddings for classifying
English Facebook texts. For all other datasets including Twitter data in English and both Facebook
and Twitter dataset in Hindi, CNN performs better.

• TakeLab uses a Bidirectional LSTM on Glove embeddings to give the best performance.

• sreeIN system uses a voting-based ensemble method with 3 classifiers - CNN with 4 layers, LSTM
and Bidirectional LSTM.

• Julian team uses translation as data augmentation strategy and use an ensemble of TF-IDF based
approaches, using character n-grams (2 - 6) and word n-grams (1 - 2) with a bi-directional RNN,
using fasttext embeddings, to get the best performance in the task..

• taraka rama uses different systems for different datasets. For English Facebook dataset and Hindi
Twitter dataset, the team uses a stacked ensemble classifier that uses a SVM on top of the ensemble
of SVM classifiers. The SVMs were trained on 1 - 6 character n-grams and word unigrams. For
Hindi Facebook and English Twitter dataset, however, a plain SVM trained using character and word
bag-of-n-grams gave the best performance. In this case, the overlapping character and word n-gram
features are weigthed with sublinear tf-idf before being used for training and testing. The system
is tuned using 5-fold CV on the combined training and develpment sets for maximum number
of character and word n-grams included, case normalization, and SVM margin (regularization)
parameter C.

• uOttawa system is trained using a novel deep-learning architecture for text classification based on
Multi-task learning (MTL). The approach, MTL, is evaluated using three neural network models.
MultiCNN, multiple convolution structure with a trainable embedding layer, gives the best perfor-
mance.

• Isistanitos system uses a soft voting (average the class probabilities of other models) of two models
- a recurrent neural network, and an SVM. The recurrent neural network uses 3 preprocesed set
of features. The first set uses an ad-hoc glove model for representing the words, the second is
a sentiwornet based model, and the third is a traditional TfIdf plus Vader Sentiment analysis and
sentiments associated with the emojis. The SVM model is trained on a TF-IDF of the post stemmed
terms, excluding stopwords, and 3 - 5 character n-grams.

• hakuchumu system makes use of a Random Forest classifier with some preprocessing including
removal of urls and non letter characters and stop words. Along with the bag-of-word, the approach
uses multiple occurrences of letters, exclamation marks and question marks in a row and emoticons
as binary features.

• DataGeeks system uses Logistic Regression classifier with some preprocessing on the data such
as removing non-ascii characters, replacing new line with ’.’, replacing n’t with not, removing
stopwords and 1 - 3 word n-grams and 2 - 6 character n-grams for training the classifier.

• na14 also uses Logistic Regression classifier with preprocessing involving replacing URLs, num-
bers, email addresses and spelling correction. The classifier is trained using word unigrams, tf-idf
vectors of word unigram, character 4-gram, character 5-gram and Google news pre-trained word
embedding model. For the Hindi dataset, Devanagari texts were transliterated into Roman at the
preprocessing stage.

• dinel achieves the best accuracy on the Facebook test set using a Random Forest classifier while
SVMs performed better for the surprise Twiiter test set. Both the classifiers were trained using 300
semantic features which represent the vector representation of the text, average scores of the top
emojis for each of the classes and positive and negative sentiment scores.

• vista.ue system is developed using dense neural networks.

• MANITBHOPALINDIA system for English is developed using SVM while for English it is trained
using deep neural networks.

• IRIT system gets the best performance for the English Facebook test set by using a combination of
two models - a doc2vec model and a logistic regression classifier. For the Twitter test set, it uses a
combination of CNN and LSTM to get the best performance.

• quine system is trained using an LSTM with attention and simple embeddings (word to index)
instead of pre-trained embeddings.

• IIIT-Delhi system uses a Single channel CNN for this task. Bayesian Optimization is used for
tuning the parameters.

• PMRS system employs a winner-takes- all autoencoder, called Emoti-KATE for Twitter senti-
ment classification. Each input dimension of Emoti-KATE is a log-normalized, sentiwordnet-score
weighted word-count vector. A binary cross-entropy loss function is used to train the network.

• resham system for English has been made using an open vocabulary approach and ensemble model
of two predictors with soft voting. The first predictor is a Naive Bayes model with CountVectorizer
for preprocessing. The second predictor is a recurrent neural network with one embedding layer
and two LSTM layers. Pre-trained word vectors have been used for the embedding layer. For Hindi
dataset, a Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the dataset augmented with English translations.

• IreneR system is based on a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier that uses unigrams, bigrams,
hedging bigrams and trigrams such as ’do you’, someone who is’,’to see that’, that potentially
signal covert aggressivity, identified with chi-squared test as features. It also includes features from
LIWC2015 (list of anger and swear words).

• Nestor uses an approach that combines Neural Networks and a new word representation model.
The patterns obtained from the word model representation are used for training the back propa-
gation neural network with fix parameters. The length of the post was fixed and the word model
representation is language independent, so it was used for both the English and the Hindi tasks.

• UAEMex-UAPT1 uses the same approach as used by the team Nestor.

• forest and trees system uses a Pooled Recurrent Unit architecture combined with pre-trained En-
glish and Hindi fasttext word embeddings as a representation of the sequence input. In this approach,
Hindi and English vectors were aligned using pre-computed SVD matrices that pulls representations
from different languages into a single space. This enabled the same model to be used for both the
languages, thereby, making data re-utilization and model deployability easier.

• groutar system is trained using random forests. The dataset is augmented with an external toxicity
dataset 4. The approach involved understanding the effects of new data on aggression identification.

7

• Shusrut system uses an ensemble of CNN 2D with MAXPOOL classifier and a SVM classifier. The
ensemble model is passed through 3 dense layers to finally predict the output. Softmax activation is
used in the outer layer for classification.

• malaypramanick system uses a random forest classifier trained using a set of surface-level fea-
tures including number of line,s uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, named entities, unicode
characters, etc.

• UAEMex-UAPT-TAC2 system is generated by combination of twelve distance measures, through
a K Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm and a canonical genetic algorithm.

• Unito is the only unsupervised system submitted in the task. It is based only on a multilingual
lexicon of aggressive words. The lexicon is obtained by automatic translation from an handmade
lexicon of offensive words in Italian, with minimal human supervision. The original words are
expanded into a list of their senses. The senses are manually annotated to filter out senses that are
never used in an offensive context. Finally, all the lemmas of the remaining senses are generated
with BabelNet in 50+ languages. The words in the lexicon are divided in those translating sense that
can be used in an offensive context (but not necessarily are) and words translating senses that are
directly offensive. This distinction is mapped to the Overtly Aggressive and Covertly Aggressive
classes respectively. The classification of sentences is straightforward: a sentence that does not
contain any word from the lexicon is tagged as NAG, a sentence containing more directly offensive
words than potentially offensive words is tagged as OAG, and the other cases are tagged as CAG.

• bhanodaig system uses a bidirectional LSTM.

6 Results

In this section, we present the results of the experiments carried out by different teams during the shared
task. The results of the top 15 teams on English dataset is given in Figure 1 and that on Hindi dataset is
in Figure 2.

The participants were allowed to use other datasets, in addition to the one provided by the organizers of
the task. However, because of the lack of similar alternative datasets, all the groups, except ’groutar’ and
’saroyehun’ team, used only the dataset provided for the task. As we mentioned earlier, the participants
were given two kinds of test sets for the final testing of the system - one from Facebook and a surprise
test set from Twitter.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the report of the First Shared task on Aggression Identification organized
with the TRAC workshop at COLING 2018. The shared task received a very encouraging response from
the community which underlines the relevance and need of the task. More than 100 teams registered and
30 teams finally submitted their system.

The performance of the best systems in the task show that aggression identification is a hard problem to
solve. Moreover, the performance of the neural networks-based systems as well as the other approaches
do not seem to differ much. If the features are carefully selected then classifiers like SVM and even
random forest and logistic regression perform at par with deep neural networks. On the other had, we
find quite a few neural networks-based systems not performing quite well in the task. Nonetheless, 14
systems were trained using one or the other architectures of deep neural networks - either solely or as
part of an ensemble. Moreover, 8 systems out of the top 15 are trained on neural networks, which shows
the efficacy of the approach but at the same time does not rule out the usefulness and relevance of linear
models for the task. There was only one system, Unito, that made use of a lexicon-based approach to
solve the task. A few participants of the task pointed out the apparent “inconsistencies” in the annotation.
It points towards the need to get the annotations validated by multiple human annotators.
