Abstract

In a recipe sharing service, users publish
recipe instructions in the form of a series of
steps. However, some of the “steps” are not
actually part of the cooking process. Specif-
ically, advertisements of recipes themselves
(e.g., “introduced on TV”) and comments
(e.g., “Thanks for many messages”) may often
be included in the step section of the recipe,
like the recipe author’s communication tool.
However, such fake steps can cause problems
when using recipe search indexing or when be-
ing spoken by devices such as smart speakers.

As presented in this talk, we have constructed
a discriminator that distinguishes between
such a fake step and the step actually used for
cooking. This project includes, but is not lim-
ited to, the creation of annotation data by clas-
sifying and analyzing recipe steps and the con-
struction of identification models. Our models
use only text information to identify the step.
In our test, machine learning models achieved
higher accuracy than rule-based methods that
use manually chosen clue words.
