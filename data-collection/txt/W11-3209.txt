Abstract 

 

The purpose of this research is to analyze the 
patterns of the product names used in Thai 
economic news and to find clues that could be 
used to identify the product names’ boundaries 
and their categories. It is found that the 
patterns of Thai product names are quite 
varied. Thirty two patterns are found in this 
study. While some clues like collocation and 
the context of names can be used for 
identifying product names, many of them 
cannot be identified by these means. This 
indicates that the task of product named entity 
recognition is an interesting task for Thai 
language processing.  

1 Introduction 
Most named entity recognition research has been 
focused on person, location, and organization 
names. Though other proper names, such as 
biomedical names and product names, are 
important in language processing, only a little 
research has been done on recognizing these 
names in Thai such as Lertcheva and 
Aroonmanakun (2009). Since different types of 
names have different patterns and characteristics, 
basic linguistic knowledge of the names is 
needed for imposing any rules or features for any 
rule-based or statistical-based named entity 
recognition systems. This paper presents basic 
knowledge of Thai product names. A corpus of 
Thai economic news is used in analyzing product 
names. Patterns and variations of their forms in 
texts are analyzed. In this paper, background 
information of product names and relevant 
research will be presented first. Then, the corpus 
and annotation used in marking Thai product 
names will be described in section 3. The results 

of the analysis will be presented in sections 4 and 
5 followed by the conclusion. 

2 Background Knowledge 
Unlike a person name, an organization name, or 
a location name, which is normally used to refer 
to one unique referent, a product name is used to 
refer to many referents categorized under the 
same product. Product names are a kind of 
proper name because each is created to refer to a 
certain product produced by a company. This 
section describes the definition of product names 
and product categories used in this study. 
Although product named entity recognition has 
been analyzed in Lertcheva and Aroonmanakun 
(2009) which focused on linguistic analysis of 
the product names for solving product name 
identification, this paper furthers the study by 
analyzing product names in detail using a larger 
corpus. Moreover, we will propose the pattern of 
product names and describe the components used 
to classify different types of product. 

2.1 Definition of Product Names 
To distinguish one product from the same 
products produced by other companies, 
trademarks or brand names are usually used in 
the product names. However, previous research 
used the terms “product names”with different 
meanings. For example, Liu et al. (2005) defined 
a product name as a name consisting of a trade 
mark and product type, e.g. Nokia 3310. Nilsson 
and Malmgren (2005) defined a product name as 
a term under brand names. In other words, a 
brand name consists of a trademark, a product 
name, and a service name. Trademarks have a 
broader scope than product names or service 
names. For example, Volvo is regarded as a 
trademark while Volvo C70 is considered a 
product name. Boonpaisarnsatit (2005) used the 

58



term “product names” differently from Liu et al. 
(2005) and Nilsson and Malmgren (2005). What 
is called “product name” in Boonpaisarnsatit 
(2005) is actually a generic noun indicating a 
category of product. He referred to “brand 
names” as the combination of product name and 
trademark. For example, รถยนต|์โตโยตา้ is analyzed 
as consisting of a product name รถยนต ์-‘car’ and a 
trademark โตโยตา้ -‘Toyota’. The use of a generic 
noun when referring to a product is a 
characteristic of referring to products in Thai. In 
this study, we use the term product name as 
defined in Lertcheva and Aroonmanakun (2009) 
which is a linguistic expression consisting of a 
generic noun, a brand name indicator, a brand 
name, a product type indicator, and a product 
type. 

2.2 Product Categories 
In product named entity recognition, the task 
includes not only identifying the boundary but 
also the type of the product. However, there is no 
standard classification of product category. In 
this paper, we use the classification listed by the 
Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of 
Commerce of Thailand and Wikipedia as a basis 
of classification and divide the products into 26 
categories as follows: 

1. Foods 
2. Medical devices 
3. Pharmaceutical 
4. Cosmetic and spa products 
5. Eyewear brands 
6. Electrical products and parts / 

Electronics 
7. Automotive / auto parts and accessories 
8. Building materials and hardware items 
9. Chemicals and plastic resins 
10. Printing products, paper and packaging 
11. Machinery and equipment 
12. Gems and jewelry 
13. Watches/Clocks 
14. Bags/Footwear/Leather Products 
15. Textiles, garments and fashion 

accessories 
16. Sporting goods 
17. Furniture and parts 
18. Gift and decorative items/handicrafts 
19. Household products 
20. Home textiles 
21. Toys and games 
22. Stationery/Office supplies and 

Equipment 
23. Tobacco 

24. Farming products 
25. Cleaning products 
26. Miscellaneous 

3 Corpus and Annotation 
To reveal patterns of product names in Thai, a 
corpus of Thai economic news is used. The 
corpus size is 178,474 words, in which 2,463 
product names are found.1 Since the language 
used in the headlines usually has different style 
from the body text, in this study, we analyze only 
the product names found in the body text of the 
news. TEI annotation style is used in marking up 
product names. A product name is tagged by 
using<productNametype=“Product’s_Category”
>…</productName>. The annotation of the 
components in product names is as follows. 

1. <genericNoun>.....</genericNoun> is used 
for tagging words used to describe the type of 
product. For example, โทรศัพท์มือถือ|โนเกีย consists of 
a compound noun, โทรศพัทมื์อถือ-‘mobile phone’, 
and a brand name “Nokia”. Although the corpus 
is collected from Thai economic news, generic 
nouns are not always written in Thai script. Even 
though English names can be transliterated using 
Thai script, they are often written in English. For 
example, the product name “LCD TV รุ่นAN-LT 
322 DU" begins with a generic noun in English 
“LCD TV” followed by a product type indicator 
in Thai รุ่น-‘model’ and then the product type in 
English “AN-LT 322 DU”. Generic nouns can be 
a simple word, a compound, or a phrase e.g.อาหาร
ทะเลแช่แขง็-‘frozen sea food’. 

2. <brandIndicator>.....</brandIndicator> is 
used to mark a brand indicator, or a word 
indicating the brand name. Brand indicators 
found in the corpus are limited to words like ตรา-
‘brand’, ยีห่อ้-‘brand’, ตระกลู-‘family’, เคร่ืองหมายการคา้-
‘trademark’, ช่ือ-‘name’, ผลิตภณัฑ-์‘product’, and แบ
รนด-์‘brand’. Brand indicators can be preceded by 
some prepositions like ภายใต-้‘under’, e.g. ภายใต|้
ผลิตภณัฑ ์= ‘under’+‘product’, or it can be modified 
by an adjective like ใหม่-‘new’, e.g. แบรนด|์ใหม่= 
‘brand’+‘new’. 

3. <brandName>.....</brandName> is used to 
mark the brand name of the product. The brand 
name is normally a trademark named for the 
products. Brand names are sometimes found

Nattadaporn.zip 

59



written in English, such as, เคร่ืองสาํอาง|DHC = a 
generic noun ‘cosmetic’ + a brand name ‘DHC’ 

4. <proIndicator>..... </proIndicator> is the 
markup for the product type indicator used to 
identify the product type. Product type indicators 
found in the corpus are รุ่น-‘type’, ซีรีย-์‘series’, 
สูตร-‘formula’, กล่ิน-‘scent’, รส/รสชาติ-‘taste’, ชนิด-
‘type’,ครอบครัวตระกลู-‘family’. These product type 
indicators sometimes can be modified by an 
adjective, such as รุ่น+ใหม่= ‘type’+‘new’.  

5. <productType>.....</productType> is for 
tagging product subtype under the same brand 
name. It is found that either common nouns or 
proper nouns can be used as a product type. In 
food product names, a common noun related to 
taste is likely to be used indicating its subtype, 
e.g. มาม่า+รส+ต้มยาํกุ้ง– ‘Mama’+‘taste’+‘spicy 
lemongrass with shrimp’. For technology 
products, a proper noun is usually used to 
identify the subtype, e.g. the name ยาริส-‘Yaris’ is 
used to indicate a specific model of the car, โต
โยตา้+ยาริส–‘Toyota’+ ‘Yaris’ 

4 Product Name Identification 
Product names in Thai consist of five 
components as stated in the previous section. 
However, the patterns can be varied. To identify 
a product name, its patterns and contextual clues 
have to be examined. In this study, we found 32 
patterns of product names. These patterns can be 
categorized into 4 groups, head only, head-
initial, head-centre, and head-final (section 4.1). 
Then, a study of context clues for identifying 
product names is presented in section 4.2. 

4.1 Pattern of Product Names 
Of the 32 patterns, brand name and product type 
are the core part of the product name. A brand 
name is used to distinguish the product from the 
same one produced by other companies. A 
product type is usually used to differentiate 
similar products under the same brand name. 
Every pattern of product name would have the 
brand name as its core part. If the brand name is 
omitted, the product type would be used as the 
core part of the product name. These two 
components are essential in uniquely identifying 
the product. Therefore, ‘head’ in this paper refers 
to a brand name or a product type. 

The symbols used in the pattern of product 
names are described as follows. 

1. (…) indicates the component that can be 
omitted in the product name.  

Example: A + (B) + C = A + B + C or A + C 
2. […] indicates that the component is 

required in the pattern. 
Example: [+brand] means that a brand 

indicator must be present in this pattern and must 
be the word ‘brand’. 

3. {…} indicates that at least one element in 
the braces must be present. 
Example: {A + B} + C = A + C or B + C or A + 
B + C 

4. | is used for marking the selection of only 
one choice.  
Example: A|B + D = A + D or B + D 

From the 32 patterns found in the 2,463 
product names, we can categorize them into 4 
groups as follows: 

1. Head Structures  
This pattern consists of one component, brand 

name or product type, functioning as the head 
word. From all the product names, the pattern 
with the brand name as head is found in 39.26% 
of the product names while the pattern with 
product type as head is found in 4.06% of the 
product names.  

 Brand name 
This pattern is found when the product 

name is used continuously in the text or in an 
illustration sentence. For example, <product 
Name type="cosSpa” ID=“P03”><brandName>
จุยซ์บิวต้ี</brandName></productName> is a name 
consisting of only the brand name “Juice 
Beauty”. 

 Product type 
This pattern is found when the product 

name is continuously referred to in the text. The 
product type can be either a common noun or a 
proper noun. For example, <product Nametype 
=“Elec”><productType>ธิงค์แพดเอ็กซ์100อี</product 
Type></productName>has a proper name as the 
product type, “ThinkPad X 100E.” In the 
example, <productNametype="food"><product 
Type>หมูสับ</productType></productName>, the 
product type is a common noun referring to 
“minced pork”. This pattern, in which only a 
common word functions as the product type, is 
acceptable only if the same product is previously 
referred to using a product name pattern 
containing a brand name. This is because, unlike 
a proper noun, a common noun by itself cannot 
specify what the product is. For example, we can 
use the product type “Jazz” without mentioning a 
brand name because the reader can understand 
what we are referring to. In contrast, we cannot 
use a common word likeหมูสับ – “minced pork” as 

60



the product name when first introduced in the 
text since the readers cannot understand what the 
product is.  

2. Head-Initial Structures 
This is the pattern in which the head is located 

at the beginning. This pattern consists of 4 sub-
patterns which account for 10.19% of the product 
names. 

 Brand name +  brand name indicator 
[+brand] + generic noun 
Example: <productName 
type="gems"><brandName>ดามิอานิ
</brandName><brandIndicator>แบรนด์
</brandIndicator><genericNoun>เคร่ืองประดบั
</genericNoun></productName> 
This example consists of a brand name 
“Damiani”, a brand indicator “brand” and a 
generic noun “jewelry”. 

 Brand name +   generic noun + product 
type indicator   + product type 
Example: <productName type=“Elec” ID=“P02”> 
<brandName> แบลก็เบอร์ร่ี </brand Name>  
<proIndicator>รุ่น</proIndicator><productType>
โบลด์</productType> </productName> 
This example consists of a brand name 
“Blackberry”, a product type indicator “type” 
and a product type “Bold”. 

 Brand name + product type + (generic 
noun) 
Example: <productName type="food"> 
<brandName>ไวตามิล้ค์</brandName> 
<productType>โลว์ชกูาร์</productType> 
</productName>  
This example consists of a brand name 
“Vitamilk” and a product type “Low sugar”. 

 Product type + product type indicator 
Example: <productName type=“Elec”> 
<productType>ธิงค์แพด</productType> 
<proIndicator>ซีรีส์</proIndicator> 
</productName> 
This example consists of a product type 
“ThinkPad” and a product type indicator 
“series”. 

3. Head-Centre Structures 
This is the pattern in which the head is located 

at the centre of the structure. This pattern 
consists of 5 sub-patterns which account for 
5.08% of the product names. 

 Generic noun | brand name indicator + 
brand name + generic noun 
Example: <productName type="food" 
ID=“P02”><brandIndicator>แบรนด์

</brandIndicator><brandName>อาร์ทรี
</brandName><genericNoun>ชาพร้อมด่ืม
</genericNoun></productName> 
This example consists of a brand indicator 
“brand”, a brand name “Artea” and a generic 
noun “tea”. 

    Generic noun + brand name indicator | 
product type indicator   + brand name + product 
type 
Example: <productName type="cosSpa"> 
<genericNoun>ยาสีฟัน</genericNoun> 
<brandIndicator>ย่ีห้อ</brandIndicator> 
<brandName>ฟลโูอคารีล</brandName> 
<productType>40 พลสั</productType> 
</productName> 
This example consists of ageneric noun 
“toothpaste”, a brand indicator “brand”, a brand 
name “Fluocaril” and a product type “40 plus”. 

 Generic noun + brand name + product 
type + generic noun 
Example:<productName type=“Auto”> 
<genericNoun>รถ</genericNoun><brandName>
เชฟโรเลต</brandName><productType>โคโลราโด
</productType><genericNoun>ปิคอพัอเมริกนัพนัธุ์แกร่ง
</genericNoun></productName> 
This example consists of a generic noun “car”, a 
brand name “Chevrolet”, a product type 
“Colorado” and a generic noun “American pick-
up”. 

 Brand name indicator + brand name + 
brand name indicator + generic noun 
Example: <productName type="fashion"> 
<brandIndicator>ไฟติง้แบรนด์ช่ือ</brandIndicator> 
<brandName>จีแอนด์จี</brandName> (Guy&Girl) 
<brandIndicator>แบรนด์</brandIndicator> 
<genericNoun>ชดุชัน้ใน</genericNoun> 
</productName> 
This example consists of a brand indicator 
“fighting brand”, a brand name “G&G”, a brand 
indicator “brand” and a generic noun 
“underwear”. 

 Generic noun + (brand name indicator) + 
brand name + (product type) + product type 
indicator + product type 
Example: <productName type=“Auto”> 
<genericNoun>รถ</genericNoun> 
<brandName>ฮอนด้า</brandName> 
<productType>ซิตี<้/productType><proIndicator>
รุ่น</proIndicator><productType>ปี2008 
</productType></productName> 

61



This example consists of a generic noun “car”, a 
brand name “Honda”, a product type “City” a 
product type indicator “type” and a product type 
“year 2008” 

4. Head-Final Structures 
Besides the pattern head only structure, this is 

the most commonly used structure in product 
names. The pattern has the head located at the 
final part of the structure. This pattern consists of 
4 sub-patterns which account for 41.41% of the 
product names. 

 (generic noun) + brand name indicator + 
brand name 
Example: <productName type=“Elec”> 
<genericNoun>โทรศพัท์เคล่ือนท่ี</genericNoun> 
<brandIndicator>ภายใต้แบรนด์</brandIndicator> 
<brandName>แบลก็เบอร์ร่ี</brandName> 
</productName> 
This example consists of a generic noun “mobile 
phone”, a brand indicator “under brand” and a 
brand name “Blackberry”. 

 (generic noun) + brand name indicator + 
generic noun + brand name indicator + brand 
name 
Example: <productName type="food" ID="P01"> 
<genericNoun>ข้าวสารบรรจถุงุ</genericNoun> 
<brandIndicator>ภายใต้แบรนด์</brandIndicator> 
<genericNoun>ข้าว</genericNoun> 
<brandIndicator>ตรา</brandIndicator> 
<brandName>ฉตัร</brandName></productName> 
This example consists of a generic noun “a bag 
of rice”, a brand indicator “under brand”, a 
generic noun “rice”, a brand indicator “brand” 
and a brand name “Chut” 

 (brand name indicator [+brand]) + 
generic noun + brand name 
Example:<productName type="food"> 
<brandIndicator>แบรนด์</brandIndicator> 
<genericNoun>นํา้ผลไม้</genericNoun> 
<brandName>แบร่ี</brandName></productName> 
This example consists of a brand indicator 
“brand”, a generic noun “juice” and a brand 
name “Berri”. 

  Generic noun + product type indicator  
+ product type 
Example: <productName type=“Auto”> 
<proIndicator>รุ่น</proIndicator> <productType>
ซีรีส์ 7 ซีดาน</productType> </productName> 
This example consists of a product type indicator 
“type” and a product type “Series 7 Sedan”. 

Thai product names tend to be used with head 
structure and head-final respectively. Head-

structure can be used without causing any 
confusion because normally the product is 
previously referred to in the text. The preference 
for the head-final structure conforms to the 
structure of a proper name in Thai, in which a 
proper name is preceded by a common noun 
indicating its class, e.g. โรงเรียน|สวนกหุลาบ= school+ 
‘Suankularp’, วดั|บวัขวญั= temple+‘Buakhwan’, etc. 
Therefore, readers will perceive the kind of 
product before the name of products. e.g., ปลาราด
พริก|ตรา|ปลายิม้ = fish with a chili sauce + a brand 
indicator ‘brand’ + a brand name ‘PlaYim’  

4.2 Clues for Identifying Product Names 
To find contextual clues that would be useful in 
identifying product names, words collocated with 
the product names and specific sentence patterns 
are examined as follows: 

1. Word collocations 
This section emphasizes the study of words 

collocated with the product names.  A 
preliminary observation shows that some words 
located in front of product names tend to have a 
meaning related to products such as ‘seller’, 
‘buyer’, ‘importer’, ‘sell’, ‘produce’, ‘import’ 
etc. To determine the efficacy of these words as 
an indicator of the product names, we analyzed 
the occurrence of every word found in front of a 
product name within the span of four words. 
Words occurring in the corpus less than 6 times 
were excluded. Then, a percentage of how often 
the words collocated with product names was 
calculated and sorted. In this study, words with 
more than 50% co-occurrence with a product 
name are considered useful. Only three words are 
found with this criterion. They are ผูผ้ลิต - ‘a 
producer’, แนะนาํ - ‘introduce’ and ผูแ้ทนจาํหน่าย - ‘a 
dealer’. When the span is set to be three words 
before the product name, only two words are 
found useful, namely แนะนาํ - ‘introduce’ and ผูแ้ทน
จาํหน่าย - ‘a dealer’. 

Although a preliminary observation intuitively 
indicates the close relation between the product 
name and its collocations, the result does not 
confirm that observation because the percentages 
of co-occurrences for most of the collocates are 
lower than 50%. 

2. Illustration sentences 
A sentence pattern that is found to be useful 

for identifying a product name is the sentence 
with illustration. In this pattern, product names 
are found as a list of illustrations after the words 
ไดแ้ก่ - ‘for example’,and เช่น- ‘such as’. The last 

62



product name usually comes after the 
conjunction และ- ‘and’. In this example, ผูจ้ดัหาเส้ือผา้|
แบรนด ์|เช่น|ลีวายส์ |และ |แรงเลอร์ (clothing dealer + brand 
+ such as + Levi’s + and + Wrangler), two 
product names are listed after the word เช่น-‘such 
as’. 

5 Product Category Identification  
The task of product named entity recognition 
includes not only identifying product name 
boundaries but also product categories. In this 
section, we describe the criteria used for 
identifying product categories. From 2,463 
product names, we found that only 1,603 product 
names (65%) can be assigned to a product 
category by considering either the components in 
the product name or contextual clues. 

1. Components in the product name 
Of those 1,603 names, the product categories 

can be determined for 1,172 by considering the 
components within the product names. 
Components that are useful are generic nouns, 
brand names, and product types.  

 Generic noun  
Product categories can be easily 

determined from the generic noun in the product 
name. For example,วทิยุ|โซน่ี = a radio + a brand 
name ‘Sony’ is categorized as ‘Electrical 
products’ because ‘radio’ is a subclass of 
electrical products. In this example,นํา้ดืม่|สิงห์ = 
drinking water + a brand name ‘Singha’ is 
categorized as ‘Foods’ because ‘drinking water’ 
is a subtype of food. 

 Brand name 
For some names, a part of the brand 

name can be useful in identifying its category. 
For example, the brand name ไวตามิลค์ (Vitamilk) 
is categorized as ‘Foods’ because there is a word 
‘milk’ within the brand name. In this example,
ไอโฟน (iphone) is categorized as ‘Electronic 
products’ because of the word ‘phone.’ The 
brand name เนสทก์าแฟ (Nescafé) is used to 
categorize the product as ‘Foods’ because the 
word ‘café’ in Thai means coffee. 

 Product type  
In some cases, product category can be 

inferred from the product type. For example, มาม่า|
รส|หมูสับ= a brand name ‘Mama’ + a product type 
indicator ‘taste’ + a product type ‘minced pork’ 
can be categorized as ‘Foods’ because of the 
product type ‘minced pork’. 

2. Contextual clues 

When components in the product name cannot 
be used to identify the product category, a 
contextual clue, which comes from a previous 
mention of the product name in the text, is used. 
It is found that the categories for 431 product 
names can be identified by referring back to the 
same product names previously presented in the 
text. If a product is referred to more than once in 
the text, its category is usually identified by 
considering the components inside the first 
mention of the name. When the same product is 
referred to again using a reduced form, its 
category can be inferred from the previous 
mention. 

In sum, based on the analysis of 2,463 product 
names, we found that categories can be identified 
for only 65% of them by analyzing the 
components inside the product name (1,172) or 
by referring to a previous mention of the product 
name (431). The rest, 860 product names (35%), 
cannot be assigned to their categories using these 
means. It seems that background knowledge is 
needed in identifying the product category. 
These are usually a product which is well known, 
e.g.  โคก้= ‘Coke’, แพนทีน= ‘Pantene’, etc. Thus, 
product category identification is not an easy 
task. 

6 Conclusion  
This study concerns both product name and 

product category identification. A linguistic 
analysis of Thai product names is carried out to 
reveal patterns of product names and clues that 
would be useful for product named entity 
recognition in Thai.  

Though there is some preference for the head-
only and head-final structures in Thai product 
names, it is found that the patterns of Thai 
product names are quite varied. In addition, there 
is no explicit clue for identifying a product name. 
Using collocates alone seems to be insufficient 
for identifying the product name.   

For product category identification, some 
inner clues can be found from the components in 
the product names. Keeping track of products 
referred to in the discourse can also help in 
identifying the category when the name is used 
in a reduced form. However, categories cannot 
be identified for a number of product names by 
this means.   

Therefore, the problem of Thai product named 
entity recognition is not an easy task. Further 
research on this topic is needed. A general 
named entity recognition model should be 

63



implemented to verify whether the model that 
has been used in Thai named entity recognition 
could resolve this problem. We think that a 
named entity recognition that uses both word 
forms and part-of-speech sequences should 
suffice for identifying the product name 
boundaries. But identifying product category, if 
it is needed, should be implemented separately 
by keeping track of product names found 
previously and creating semantic relations 
between the product names and contextual 
words.
