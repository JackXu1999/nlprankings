Abstract

This paper deals with the automatic en-
hancement of a new German morphological
database. While there are some databases for
flat word segmentation, this is the first avail-
able resource which can be directly used for
deep parsing of German words. We combine
the entries of this morphological database with
the morphological tools SMOR and More-
morph and a context-based evaluation method
which builds on a large Wikipedia corpus. We
describe the state of the art and the essential
characteristics of the database and the context
method. The approach is tested on an inflight
magazine of Lufthansa. We derive over 5,000
new instances of complex words. The cover-
age for the lemma types reaches up to over 99
percent. The precision of new found complex
splits and monomorphemes is between 0.93
and 0.99.

1 Introduction

German is a language with complex processes of
word formation, of which the most common are
compounding and derivation. Segmentation and
analysis of the resulting word forms are challeng-
ing as spelling conventions do not permit spaces
as indicators for boundaries of constituents as in
(1).

(1) Verkehrsamt ‘tourist office’

For long orthographical word forms, many combi-
natorially possible analyses exist, though usually
only one of them has a conventionalized meaning
(see Figure 1). For instance, for Verkehrsamt ‘traf-
fic office, tourist office’, word segmentation tools
can yield the wrong split containing one with the
smaller number of word tokens Verkehr ‘traffic’
and Samt ‘velvet’.

In this case, there is a linking element within
the word form which could be wrongly interpre-

tated as part of a morph. Such elements function
as morphophonological structure markers.1

German compounds can consist of derivatives,
or compounds can be subject to further derivation.
In (1), Verkehr is the result of a conversion pro-
cess from verkehren ‘to run, to fly’, which again
consists of a prefix and a verb stem (see Figure 2).
On each level of morphological segmentation, the
number of possible analyses is 2n. This number
can be reduced by excluding implausible construc-
tions such as suffixes at the beginning of a con-
struct. On the other hand, it has to be multiplied
by the number of homonyms for the segmented
forms. Therefore, automatic segmentations with
more than ten possible analyses for one word are
no rare case.

However, finding the correct segmentations
and morphological structures is essential for
terminologies and translation (memory) tools,
information retrieval, and as input for tex-

1By some approaches, such linking elements are consid-
ered as a special kind of morphemes and called Fugenmor-
pheme. We like to avoid such classifications and use the la-
bels filler letters or interfix.

tual analyses. Deep parsing of complex mor-
phological structures produces disambiguation
such as (Fremde|n|verkehr)|s|amt ‘tourism of-
fice’ instead of the tautological interpretation
]Fremde|n|(Verkehr|s|amt) ‘foreigner tourist of-
fice’.2 Such analyses can help improving the qual-
ity of translation and retrieval tasks.

Moreover, counts of morphs, and morphologi-
cal structures are useful for inducing hypotheses
about statistical tendencies and quantitative laws,
e.g. Menzerath’s law (Cramer, 2005) or the Prin-
ciple of Early Immediate Constituents (Hoffmann,
1999), which has not yet been corroborated for the
word level by statistical tests.

In this paper, we will apply a hybrid approach
for finding the correct splits of words and aug-
menting a morphological database. In Section 2,
we provide a concise overview of previous work
in word segmentation and word parsing for Ger-
man. In Section 3, we introduce two linguistic
tools we will be using later. SMOR is a well-
known morphological tool. We describe how we
modified its lexicon and exploited and changed
its internal results by the add-on module More-
morph. Section 4 introduces our morphological
database which was built on the basis of the lin-
guistic databases CELEX and GermaNet. Sec-
tion 5 describes the data-intense procedures for the
morphological analyses and supervised database

enhancements. In Section 6, we test our method
on a corpus of an inflight journal. Finally, we dis-
cuss our results and give an outlook for future de-
velopments.

2 Related Work

The first developments in morphological seg-
mentation tools for German date back to the
Nineties. Most of them are based on finite state
machines. Gertwol (Haapalainen and Majorin,
1995), MORPH (Hanrieder, 1996), Morphy (Lez-
ius, 1996; Lezius et al., 1998) and later SMOR
(Schmid et al., 2004) and TAGH (Geyken and
Hanneforth, 2006) generate morphological analy-
ses for complex German words, yielding results
for derivatives and compounds. All these analyses
are flat word splittings and often include dozens of
segmentation versions.

There are different ways to tackle such kind of
ambiguity, most of which are applied merely to
compounds and yield flat segmentations of the im-
mediate constituent level.

Cap (2014) and Koehn and Knight (2003) use
ranking scores, such as the geometric mean, for
the different morphological analyses and then
choose the segmentation with the highest ranking.

Another approach consists in exploitation the
sequence of letters, e.g. by pattern matching with
tokens (Henrich and Hinrichs, 2011, 422) or lem-
mas (Weller-Di Marco, 2017). Ziering and van
der Plas (2016) use normalization methods which
are combined with ranking by the geometric mean.
Ma et al. (2016) apply Conditional Random Fields
modeling for letter sequences. Daiber et al. (2015)
extract candidates of compound splits by string
comparisons with corpus data.

Recent approaches exploit semantic informa-
tion for the ranking of compound splittings. Riedl
and Biemann (2016) utilize look-ups of similar
terms inside a distributional thesaurus. Their rank-
ing score is a modification of the geometric mean.

Ziering et al. (2016) use the cosine as a mea-
sure for semantic similarity between compounds
and their hypothetical constituents and combine
these similarity values by computing the geomet-
ric means and other scores for each produced split.
The scores are then used as factors to be multiplied
by the scores of former splits.

One of the few approaches tackling deep mor-
phological analyses is Ziering et al. (2016). Their
investigation considers left-branching compounds



180

consisting of three lexemes. Their distributional
semantic modelling often fails to find the correct
binary split if the head is too ambiguous to corre-
late strongly with the first part. But in general,
using the semantic context is a sensitive disam-
biguation method. Ziering and van der Plas (2016)
develop a splitter which makes use of normaliza-
tion methods and can be used recursively by re-
analyzing the results of splits. Their evaluation
is based on the binary compounds of GermaNet
(Hamp and Feldweg, 1997; Henrich and Hinrichs,
2011).

Würzner and Hanneforth (2013) use a proba-
bilistic context free grammar for full morpholog-
ical parsing, but restrict their approach to deriva-
tional adjectives.

Most these approaches build upon corpus data.
Only Henrich and Hinrichs (2011) enrich the out-
put of morphological segmentation with informa-
tion from the annotated compounds of GermaNet
to disambiguate such structures. This can in a fur-
ther step yield hierarchical structures but presup-
poses that the entries for the components exist in-
side the database. Steiner and Ruppenhofer (2018)
build on this idea to derive more complex morpho-
logical structures from lexical resources. In 5, we
come back to this and will exploit their resource.

3 SMOR: A Morphological Tool for
German and its Add-On Moremorph

3.1 SMOR

SMOR is a widely used morphological segmenta-
tion tool (e.g. Cap (2014), Henrich and Hinrichs
(2011), Steiner and Ruppenhofer (2015), Ziering
et al. (2016)). It is based on two-level morphol-
ogy (Koskenniemi, 1984) and implemented as a
set of finite-state transducers. For German, a large
set of lexicons is available. These lexicons con-
tain information about inflection, parts of speech
and classes of word formation, e.g. abbreviations
and truncations. The tag set used is compatible
with the STTS (Stuttgart Tübingen tag set, Schiller
et al. (1995)).

SMOR produces different levels of granular-
ity and different representation formats with dif-
ferent transducers and options. Example (2) and
(3) show two simplified outputs of fine-grained
analyses for Verkehrsamt ‘traffic office, tourist of-
fice’ and Fremdenverkehrsamt ‘foreign-traffic of-
fice, tourist office’. For the sake of simplicity, we
removed case and number.

(2) Verkehr<NN>Samt<+NN>
Verkehr<NN>Amt<+NN>
ver<VPREF>kehren<V>Samt<+NN>

(3) Fremdenverkehr<NN>Samt<+NN>
Fremdenverkehr<NN>Amt<+NN>
Fremd<Adj>verkehr<NN>Samt<+NN>
Fremd<Adj>verkehr<NN>Amt<+NN>
Fremd<Adj>ver<VPREF>kehren<V>
Samt<+NN>

In (2), the word form Verkehrsamt ‘tourist of-
fice’ is analyzed in three different ways, of which
two show the erroneous interpretation of the string
samt ‘velvet’ as a noun. (3) shows the same er-
ror in three of its five segmentations. The cate-
gories consist of parts of speech (<NN>, <V>)
for free morphs and the position of bound mor-
phemes (e.g. <VPREF> for ‘verbal prefix’).

3.2 Moremorph
While SMOR is a reliable foundation for the anal-
ysis of word forms which have not been found be-
fore, it comes with some small drawbacks. More-
morph aims at improving and adjusting the output
of SMOR.

As can be seen from the second line of (2), the
SMOR output does not indicate if there are filler
letters (or interfixes) inside a word.

However, the information exists inherently in
intermediate SMOR output which can be reana-
lyzed by Moremorph. Therefore, filler letters (FL)
can be marked as in (4):

(4) Verkehr s Amt NN FL NN <NN>

This annotation shows the morphs on the lexical
level, their classes with filler letters, and finally the
part of speech of the word form in angle brackets.
(5) presents the Moremorph representation of (3).
In the last three analyses, there is one tag more
than the number of splits due to the noun conver-
sion of fremd ‘foreign’ to Fremde ‘foreigner’.

Moremorphs uses SMOR lexicons which we
adapted to the current task. The original version
of the names lexicon comprised 14,998 entries, the
final extended version 16,718 entries. During the
project, the lexicon was constantly extended and
cleaned and its entries were revised. The final ver-
sion used for the current work comprises 42,205
entries. Many changes of the rule sets were made
in cooperation with Helmut Schmid according to
our suggestions. For example, we changed the sets
of characters or added adverbs as possible tag class
for numbers. Other changes include the derivation
of adjectives from names of location. Some of the
finite-state transducers had to be changed for this.

We also standardized inconsistent analyses for
orthographical variants with and without hyphen-
ations and added some more special characters to
the inventory of word structuring means.

This leads to consistent analyses for ortho-
graphical variants such as in (6). Also word forms
with some other special characters not covered by
SMOR can be processed now, as in (7).

4 A Lexical Database with Deep-Level
Morphological Information

While most morphological analyzers build on the
results of word splitters, we decided to take up a
hybrid approach which combines the reliable en-
tries of a morphological database with the aug-
mented and further processed analyses of SMOR
and Moremorph. Here, also another morphologi-
cal tool could be chosen.

The German morphological tree database ex-
tracts its entries from a. the refurbished CELEX
database (Baayen et al., 1995; Steiner, 2016)
for German morphology (Burnage, 1995; Gulik-
ers et al., 1995) and b. the compound analyses
from the GermaNet database (Hamp and Feldweg,
1997; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2011; Steiner, 2017).
For both preprocessed datasets, the derivation of
complex structures was performed recursively, by
combining the GermaNet analyses with the analy-
ses from CELEX.

The tree building tool provides different pa-
rameters for the analysis. We chose to enrich
the data with information on diachronic derivation
and permitted a depth of six levels for the mor-
phological analyses. (9) shows the morpholog-
ical structures for (9-a) Verkehrsamt ‘tourist of-
fice’, (9-b) Verkehrsanlage ‘traffic facility’, and
(9-c) Verkehrsbehinderung ‘traffic obstruction’.
(9-b) comprises diachronic derivational informa-
tion, showing the noun Anlage ‘facility/lay out’ as
derived from the verb anlegen ‘lay out’.

The number of entries for this databases of the
morphological trees amounts to 101,588. In addi-
tion, we extracted 6,339 types of monomorphemes
from the refurbished German CELEX database.

5 Combining Morphological Databases
with a Segmenter

In the following, we combine the morphologi-
cal database with a morphological segmenter and
a contextual evaluation process. If the database
look-up fails, the time-consuming word splitting
and evaluation is started. Then the output of More-
morph is analyzed by a contextual method by ex-
ploiting a very large corpus. If this fails, frequen-
cies counts of a very large corpus is the back-off
strategy. The new analyses are added to a set of
new splits.

At the end of each word analysis, all subparts of
the word are being searched within the database
and the newsplit set. This leads to incrementally
more fine-grained entries.

Figure 3 presents an overview. It shows two
databases of morphological trees: the German
morphological tree database and a incremental
database for all newly found morphological analy-
ses. Furthermore, it comprises a set of monomor-
phemes.

5.1 Basic Look-Up

As shown in Figure 3, a look-up finds the respec-
tive tree or the simplex form for the word within
the lexicons. Before this is added to the results,
all of its subparts are being looked up within the
databases and the new splits. These subanalyses
are being integrated to its new analysis. Old en-
tries within the lexical databases are being substi-
tuted for the new ones.

5.2 Finding Splits

If neither an entry inside the tree lexicons nor
in the list of monomorphemes can be found, the
Moremorph analyses are taken as the start for the
further analysis. For each analysis, e.g. the five
different ones of example (5), every possible com-
bination of subtrees has to build. Some of them
can be filtered out, because they are linguistically
implausible, e.g. when a hypothetical subpart fin-
ishes with a prefix.

All plausible combinations of strings and tags
undergo a contextual analysis, if occurrences for
all subparts can be found within at least one text of
the large corpus. Otherwise, a procedure of using
the overall document frequencies together with a
back-off strategy will be invoked.

5.2.1 Morphological Segmentation based on
Contextual Information

For (unknown) compounds, we presuppose that
each component can be found within the same
close environments. Therefore, the frequencies of
components in texts should be much lower for er-
roneous splits than the frequencies for correct seg-
mentations.

We chose a large set of texts for the retrieval: the
freely available and annotated German Wikipedia
Korpus of 2015 (Margaretha and Lüngen, 2014).3

We restricted ourselves to the 1.8 million texts
subcorpus of the articles. The corpus was to-
kenized by a modified version of the tool from
Dipper (2016) and lemmatized by the TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1999). Text indices were built both for
tokenized and lemmatized forms. For each text,
all frequencies of lemmas and tokens were stored.

For each morphological split of a word form wf
(spwf,n), the intersection of all texts comprising
the word form wf and their hypothetical compo-
nents cwf,sp,1..n is retrieved from the text indices.
For every text t which includes all components for
the word form wf (cwf,sp,1...cwf,sp,n) of a mor-
phological split, the document frequencies (df ) of
the components are being retrieved and added to
the sum of text frequencies score (Stf ). For every
hypothetical analysis, the highest value is chosen
and the morphological analysis with this score is
stored (Equation 1).

Finally, for every hypothetical analysis, the high-
est value is chosen and the morphological analysis
with this score is processed and stored.

5.2.2 Morphological Segmentation based on
Document Frequencies

In case that no text can be found which includes
the word form wf and the components of any
of the hypothetical analyses, the corpus itself is
considered as a textual enviroment in the widest
sense. For each split, the sum of frequencies are
being calculated. The hypothetical analysis with
the highest value is chosen and the morphological
analysis with this score is processed for the stor-
age. In all other cases, the analysis will yield the
hypothetical analysis of a monomorpheme.

5.3 Substitution of Analyses

Whenever an analysis by the Best− Stf score or
another look-up has been found, the analyses for
its immediate constituents are being searched in
the databases. By this, the lexicons can be incre-
mentally enlarged and enriched. Figure 4 shows
an example from our test corpus, which we used
for the evaluation in Section 6.

The results are added to a database of new splits
and can be added to the previous database after an
evaluation.

6 Evaluation

6.1 Data

For testing the performance, we use Korpus
Magazin Lufthansa Bordbuch (MLD) which is
part of the DeReKo-2016-I (Institut für Deutsche
Sprache, 2016) corpus4. It is an in-flight maga-
zine with articles on traveling, consumption and
aviation. For the tokenization, we enlarged and
costumized the tokenizer by Dipper (2016) for
our purposes. Multi-word units were automati-
cally identified based on the multi-word dataset
which we had augmented before. The resulting
data comprises 276 texts with 5,202 paragraphs,

4See Kupietz et al. (2010) and http://www1.ids-
mannheim.de/kl/projekte/korpora/archiv/mld.html for further
information.

16,046 sentences and 260,114 tokens. The num-
ber of word-form types is 38,337. We are analyz-
ing the lemmatized version of this corpus which
was produced by the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1999),
it comprises 27,902 lemma types.

6.2 Results

6.2.1 Coverage
15,622 lemma types can be found within the
database. 12,280 lemma types are not covered
by the databases, so they were re-analyzed by
SMOR/Moremorph. We manually checked the re-
sults for the first 1,000 lemma types which could
not be found in the database. Very often, these are
derivatives, rare or nounce words, proper names or
words containing proper names as in (10).

(10) a. ordnend ‘ordering, regulatory’
b. Paris-Erfahrung ‘Paris experience’
c. Winterspaß ‘winter fun’

The details of the check against the German tree
database are included in Table 1, with a coverage
of 55.99% for the lemma types. This direct lookup
saves a lot of computational effort. According to
the quality of the database which is based on Ger-
maNet and CELEX, the recall is extremely close
to these numbers.

The remaining 44.01% of all lemma types were
evaluated in the following way: We checked ev-
ery split of the first thousand analyzed words. For
ambiguous analyses, we accepted those which in-
cluded a monomorphemic and a correct deriva-
tional analysis, as in (11), with (11-a) showing the
segmentation of verb stem and derivational suffix.

(11) a. ordnend ordn end V PPres ADJ-
SUFF <ADJ>

b. ordnend ordnend V <V>

If one or more splits were erroneous, as in (12-a),
the analysis was rejected.

b. ]Winterspaß Winter s paß NN FL

We found 26 wrongly segmented words in-
side the sample of a thousand words from the
SMOR/Moremorph output. This shows a good
quality of the analysis. However, unknown

were names of airplane types or similar expres-
sions. Therefore, the number of analyzed lemma
types (27,902) corresponds to a full coverage.
SMOR/Moremorph on its own was able to pro-
cess 13,461 lemmas, the rest was classified as un-
known. This good coverage is a direct result of the
adjustment of the lexicons, which we described in

6.2.2 Precision
The complete analyses of the hybrid morpho-
logical parsing yield 5,307 entries in the news-
plit database and 5,973 new entries inside the
monomorphemes. We analyzed the first 1,000 en-
tries of the newly found splits and the first 2,000
entries within the monomorpheme set. Of the first
set, we found 65 wrongly or imperfectly analyzed
word forms. Most of them are three-part com-
pounds such as (13) whose correct components
were not found within a text. The morphemes
were identified, but the ambiguity could not be re-
solved.

(13) (Berg|Regen|Wald) ‘mountain rain for-
est’

Another error are wrong analyses of derivative
nouns which starts with a verb particle such as
(14-a) , which is a derivative form of anfahren ‘to
approach’ (14-b) and not a compound of an ‘at,
to’ and Fahrt ‘ride’. There is a systematic mistake
here which is caused by the high frequency of the
first part which is usually a homograph of a prepo-
sition.

(14) a. ]An|(*Fahrt* fahren|t) ‘approach’
b. (*anfahren* an|fahren)|t ‘approach’



186

The set of monomorphs comprise many new com-
plex numbers and proper names. All of them
were correctly included. Only three assignments
are questionable. However, as these are proper
names such as Anneliese which consists of two
proper names Anna and Liese, and/or the analy-
sis in CELEX was monomorphemous too (as for
Allerheiligen ‘All Saints’), the quality is very high.
Therefore, the precision can be considered as high
for this test corpus: 0.935 for new splits and 0.998
for newly found monomorphs.

6.3 Discussion

The results for the first hybrid deep-level morphol-
ogy analyzer are promising. However, the errors
concerning verb particles are systematic. They
can be explained by the high frequency of verb
particles in texts, which are often homographs of
a preposition. For future research, we plan an
adjustment by a factor which takes into account
the relationship between word length in characters
and word frequency as observed by Zipf and oth-
ers (Prün, 2005). Köhler (1986) derives this rela-
tionship by a synergetic model. He corroborates
the functional connection between the frequency
classes of words and their average length. A mea-
sure directly derived from this function would pe-
nalize word segmentations with small morphemes
and assign more weight to longer (and rare) com-
ponents.

7 Conclusion and Outlook

This paper demonstrates how updating and ex-
ploiting linguistic databases for morphological
analyses can be performed. By simple look-up,
we reached a coverage of 56% of lemma types.
As both underlying databases, CELEX and Ger-
maNet, were manually revised, we can speak of
very reliable analyses. The remaining unanalyzed
words can be mostly covered by a conventional
word segmenter after adjusting its lexicons. These
analyses have a flat structure and undergo a proce-
dure of constructing all combinations of possible
analyses and a context-based search for the hypo-
thetical constituents in a large corpus. The results
for the lemma types are very promising: Over 99%
of all words were covered by the combined mor-
phological analyses.

New morphological analyses from the tree-
building process can be added to the German tree
database after a process of careful evaluation and

selection.
The direction of the future research is therefore

straightforward: it will lead towards creating com-
plex analyses out of existing ones and augmenting
the lexical databases.
