Abstract 

Princeton WordNet (PWN) is one of the most 
influential resources for semantic descriptions, 
and is extensively used in natural language 
processing. Based on PWN, three Chinese 
wordnets have been developed: Sinica Bilingual 
Ontological Wordnet (BOW), Southeast 
University WordNet (SEW), and Taiwan 
University WordNet (CWN). We used SEW to 
sense-tag a corpus, but found some issues with 
coverage and precision. We decided to make a 
new Chinese wordnet based on SEW to increase 
the coverage and accuracy. In addition, a small 
scale Chinese wordnet was constructed from 
open multilingual wordnet (OMW) using data 
from Wiktionary (WIKT). We then merged 
SEW and WIKT. Starting from core synsets, we 
formulated guidelines for the new Chinese Open 
Wordnet (COW). We compared the five Chinese 
wordnets, which shows that COW is currently 
the best, but it still has room for further 
improvement, especially with polysemous 
words. It is clear that building an accurate 
semantic resource for a language is not an easy 
task, but through consistent efforts, we will be 
able to achieve it. COW is released under the 
same license as the PWN, an open license that 
freely allows use, adaptation and redistribution. 

1 Introduction 
Semantic descriptions of languages are useful for a 
variety of tasks.  One of the most influential such 
resources is the Princeton WordNet (PWN), an 
English lexical database created at the Cognitive 
Science Laboratory of Princeton University 
(Fellbaum, 1998; George A Miller, 1995; George 
A. Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, & Miller, 
1990). It is widely used in natural language 
processing tasks, such as word sense 
disambiguation, information retrieval and text 
classification. PWN has greatly improved the 
performance of these tasks. Based on PWN, three 

Chinese wordnets have been developed. Sinica 
Bilingual Ontological Wordnet (BOW) was 
created through a bootstrapping method (Huang, 
Chang, & Lee, 2004; Huang, Tseng, Tsai, & 
Murphy, 2003). Southeast University Chinese 
WordNet (SEW) was automatically constructed by 
implementing three approaches, including 
Minimum Distance, Intersection and Words Co-
occurrence (Xu, Gao, Pan, Qu, & Huang, 2008); 
Taiwan University and Academia Sinica also 
developed a Chinese WordNet (CWN)(Huang et al 
2010). We used SEW to sense-tag NTU corpus 
data (Bond, Wang, Gao, Mok, & Tan, 2013; Tan & 
Bond, 2012). However, its mistakes and its 
coverage hinder the progress of the sense-tagged 
corpus.  Moreover, the open multilingual wordnet 
project (OMW) 1  created wordnet data for many 
languages, including Chinese (Bond & Foster, 
2013). Based on OMW, we created a small scale 
Chinese wordnet from Wiktionary (WIKT). 
    All of these wordnets have some flaws and, 
when we started our project, none of them were 
available under an open license. A high-quality 
and freely available wordnet would be an 
important resource for the community.  Therefore, 
we have started work on yet another Chinese 
wordnet in Nanyang Technological University 
(NTU COW), aiming to produce one with even 
better accuracy and coverage. Core synsets2 are the 
most common ones ranked according to word 
frequency in British National Corpus (Fellbaum & 
Vossen, 2007). There are 4,960 synsets after 
mapping to WordNet 3.0. These synsets are more 
salient than others, so we began with them. 
    In this paper we compared all the five wordnets 
(COW, BOW, SEW, WIKT, and CWN), and 
showed their strengths and weaknesses.     
    The following sections are organized as follows.

Section 2 elaborates on the four Chinese wordnets 
built based on PWN. Section 3 introduces the 
guidelines in building COW. Section 4 compares 
the core synsets of different wordnets. Finally the 
conclusion and future work are stated in Section 5. 

2 Related Research 
PWN was developed from 1985 under the 
direction of George A. Miller. It groups nouns, 
verbs, adjective and adverbs into synonyms 
(synsets), most of which are linked to other synsets 
through a number of semantic relations. For 
example, nouns have these relations: hypernym, 
hyponym, holonym, meronym, and coordinate 
term (Fellbaum, 1998; George A Miller, 1995; 
George A. Miller et al., 1990). PWN has been a 
very important resource in computer science, 
psychology, and language studies. Hence many 
languages followed up and multilingual wordnets 
were either under construction or have been built. 
PWN is the mother of all wordnets (Fellbaum, 
1998). Under this trend, in the Chinese community, 
three wordnets were built: SEW, BOW, and CWN. 
SEW is in simplified Chinese, while BOW and 
CWN are in traditional Chinese. 
    SEW: 3  Xu et al. (2008) investigated various 
automatic approaches to  translate the English 
WordNet 3.0 to Chinese WordNet. They are 
Minimum Distance (MDA), Intersection (IA) and 
Words Co-occurrence (WCA). MDA computes the 
Levenshtein Distance between glosses of English 
synsets and the definition in American Heritage 
Dictionary (Chinese & English edition). IA 
chooses the intersection of the translated words. 
WCA put an English word and a Chinese word as 
a group to get the co-occurrence results from 
Google. IA has the highest precision, but the 
lowest recall. WCA has highest recall but lowest 
recall.  Considering the pros and cons of each 
approach, they then integrated them into an 
integrated one called MIWA. They first chose IA 
to process the whole English WordNet then MDA 
to deal with the remaining synsets of WordNet; 
finally adopt WCA for the rest. Following this 
order, MIWA got a high translation precision and 
increased the number of synsets that can be 
translated.   SEW is free for research, but cannot 
be redistributed.

    BOW:4 It was bootstrapped from the English-
Chinese Translation Equivalents Database 
(ECTED), based on WordNet 1.6(Huang et al., 
2003; Huang, Tseng, & Tsai, 2002). ECTED was 
manually made by the Chinese Knowledge and 
Information Processing group (CKIP), Academia 
Sinica. First, all Chinese translations of an English 
lemma from WordNet 1.6 were extracted from 
online bilingual resources. They are checked by a 
team of translators who select the three most 
appropriate translation equivalents where possible 
(Huang et al., 2004). They tested the 210 most 
frequent Chinese lexical lemmas in Sinica Corpus. 
They first mapped them to ECTED to find out their 
corresponding English synsets and then by 
assuming the WordNet semantic relations hold true 
for Chinese, they automatically linked the semantic 
relations for Chinese. They further evaluated the 
semantic relations in Chinese, which showed that 
automatically assigned relation in Chinese has high 
probability once the translation is equivalent 
(Huang et al., 2003). BOW is only available for 
online lookup. 
    CWN:5 BOW has many entries that are not truly 
lexicalized in Chinese.  To solve this issue, Taiwan 
University constructed a Chinese wordnet with the 
aim of making only entries for Chinese words 
(Huang et al., 2010). CWN was recently released 
under the same license as wordnet. 
    Besides the above three Chinese wordnets, we 
looked at data from Bond and Foster (2013) who 
extracted lemmas for over a hundred languages by 
linking the English Wiktionary to OMW 
(WIKT).   By linking through multiple translations, 
they were able to get a high precision for 
commonly occurring words. For Chinese, they 
found translations for 12,130 synsets giving 19,079 
senses covering 49% of the core synsets.  
    We did some cleaning up and mapped the above 
four wordnets into WordNet 3.0. The size of each 
one is depicted in Table 1. SEW has the most 
entries, followed by BOW. SEW, BOW and WIKT 
have nouns as the largest category, while CWN has 
verbs as the largest category.

(iii) news: Mainichi News; and (iv) tourism: Your 
Singapore (Tan & Bond, 2012). However, as SEW 
is automatically constructed, it was found that 
there are many mistakes and some words are not 
included. 
    In order to ensure coverage of frequently 
occurring concepts, we decided to concentrate on 
the core synsets first, following the example of the 
Japanese wordnet (Isahara, Bond, Uchimoto, 
Utiyama, & Kanzaki, 2008).  The core synsets of 
PWN are the most frequent nouns, verbs, and 
adjectives in British National Corpus 
(BNC) 6  (Boyd-Graber, Fellbaum, Osherson, & 
Schapire, 2006). There are 4,960 synsets after 
mapping them to WordNet 3.0. Nouns are the 
largest category making up to 66.1%.  Verbs 
account for 20.1% and adjectives only take up 
13.8%. There is no adverb in the core synsets.  
    The construction procedure of COW comprises 
of three phases: (i) extract data from Wiktionary 
and then merge WIKT and SEW, (ii) manually 
check all translations by referring to bilingual 
dictionaries and add more entries, (iii) check the 
semantic relations. The following section 
introduces the phases.   
    COW is released under the same license as the 
PWN, an open license that freely allows use, 
adaptation and redistribution. Because SEW, 
WIKT and the corpus we are annotating are in 
simplified Chinese, COW is also made in 
simplified Chinese.

3.1 Merge SEW and WIKT 

We were able to obtain a research license for 
SEW. WIKT data is under the same license as 
Wiktionary (CC BY SA7) and so can be freely 
used. We merged the two sets and extracted only 
the core synsets, which gave us a total of 12,434 
Chinese translations for the 4,960 core synsets. 

3.2 Manual Correction of Chinese 
Translations 

During the process of manual efforts in building a 
better Chinese wordnet, we drew up some 
guidelines. First, Chinese translations must convey 
the same meaning and POS as the English synset. 
If there is a mismatch in senses, transitivity and 
POS (not including cases that need to add 的 de /
地 de), delete it. Second, use simplified and correct 
orthography. If the Chinese translations must add
的 de /地 de to express the same POS as English, 
add it. The second guideline is referred to as 
amendments. Third, add new translations through 
looking up authoritative bilingual dictionaries. The 
following section describes the three actions taken 
(delete, amend, and add) by using the three 
guidelines.  

3.2.1   Delete a Wrong Translation 

A translation will be deleted if it is in one of the 
three cases: (i) wrong meaning; (ii) wrong 
transitivity; (iii) wrong POS.

(i)  Wrong Meaning 
    If a Chinese translation does not reflect the 
meaning of an English synset, delete it. For 
instance, election is a polysemous word, which has 
four senses in PWN: 
 
 S1: (n) election (a vote to select the winner of a 

position or political office) "the results of the 
election will be announced tonight" 

 S2: (n) election (the act of selecting someone or 
something; the exercise of deliberate 
choice) "her election of medicine as a 
profession" 

 S3: (n) election (the status or fact of being 
elected) "they celebrated his election" 

 S4: (n) election (the predestination of some 
individuals as objects of divine mercy 
(especially as conceived by Calvinists)) 
 

    The synset 00181781-n is the first sense of 
“election” (S1) in WordNet. The Chinese WordNet 
provides two translations: 当选 dāngxuǎn ‘election’ 
and 选举 xuǎnjǔ ‘election’. It is clear that 当选
dāngxuǎn ‘election’ is the third sense of “election”, 
so it should be deleted.  
(ii) Wrong Transitivity 
    Verbs usually have either transitive or 
intransitive use. In synset 00250181-v, “mature; 
maturate; grow” are intransitive verbs, so the 
Chinese translation 使成熟 shǐ chéngshú  ‘make 
mature’ is wrong and is thus deleted. 
    00250181-v  mature; maturate; grow  “develop and 
reach maturity; undergo maturation”: He matured fast;  
The child grew fast 
 (iii) Wrong POS 
    When the POS of an English synset has a 
Chinese translation that has the same POS, then the 
Chinese translation with a different POS should be 
deleted. For example, 00250181-v is a verbal 
synset, but 壮年的 zhuàngnián de ‘the prime of 
life’s’ and 成熟的 chéngshú de  ‘mature’ are not 
verbs, so they are deleted. 

3.2.2 Amend a Chinese Translation 

A translation will be amended if it is in one of the 
three cases: (i) written in traditional characters; (ii) 
wrong characters; (iii) need 的 de /地 de to match 
the English POS. 
(i) Written in Traditional Characters 
    When a Chinese translation is written in 

traditional Chinese, amend it to be simplified 
Chinese. The synset 02576460-n is translated as 鰺
属 shēn shǔ ‘caranx’, we change it to be 鲹属 shēn 
shǔ ‘caranx’. 
    02576460-n Caranx; genus_Caranx  “type genus of 
the Carangidae” 
(ii) Wrong Characters 
    When a Chinese translation has a typo, revise it 
to the correct one.  The synset 00198451-n is 
translated as 晋什 jìnshén, which should have been
晋升 jìnshēng ‘promotion’. 
    00198451-n  promotion  “act of raising in rank or 
position” 
(iii) Need 的 de /地 de to match the English POS 
    The synset 01089369-a is an adjectival, but the 
translation 兼职 jiānzhí ‘part time’ is a verb/noun, 
so we add 的 de to it (1.3). 
    01089369-a part-time; part time  “involving less than 
the standard or customary time for an activity”:  part-
time employees;  a part-time job 

3.2.3 Add Chinese Translations 

To improve the coverage and accuracy of COW, 
we make reference not only to many authoritative 
bilingual dictionaries, such as The American 
Heritage Dictionary for Learners of English (Zhao, 
2006), The 21st Century Unabridged English-
Chinese Dictionary (Li, 2002), Collins COBUILD 
Advanced Learner's English-Chinese Dictionary 
(Ke, 2011), Oxford Advanced Learner's English-
Chinese Dictionary (7th Edition) (Wang, Zhao, & 
Zou, 2009), Longman Dictionary of Contemporary 
English (English-Chinese) (Zhu, 1998), etc., but 
also online bilingual dictionaries, such as iciba8, 
youdao9, lingoes10, dreye11 and bing12. 
    For example, the English synset 00203866-v can 
be translated as 变坏 biàn huài ‘decline’ and 恶化
èhuà ‘worsen’, which are not available in the 
current wordnet, so we added them to COW. 
    00203866-v worsen; decline “grow worse”:  
Conditions in the slum worsened 

3.3 Check Semantic Relations 
PWN groups nouns, verbs, adjectived and adverbs

into synonyms (synsets), most of which are linked 
to other synsets through a number of semantic 
relations. Huang et al. (2003) tested 210 Chinese 
lemmas and their semantic relations links. The 
results show that lexical semantic-relation 
translations are highly precise when they are 
logically inferable. We randomly checked some of 
the relations in COW, which shows that this 
statement also holds for the new Chinese wordnet 
we are building. 

3.4 Results of the COW Core Synsets 
Through merging SEW and WIKT, we got 12,434 
Chinese translations. Based on the guidelines 
described above, the revisions we made are 
outlined in Table 2. 
 
Wrong Entries Deletion 1,706 Amendment 134 
Missing Entries Addition 2,640 
Total 4,480 

Table 2. Revision of the wordnet 

    Table 2 shows that there are 1,840 wrong entries 
(15%) of which we deleted 1,706 translations and 
amended 134.  Furthermore, we added 2,640 new 
entries (about 21%).   
    The wrong entries are further checked according 
to POS as shown in Table 3. The results indicate 
that verbal synsets have a higher error rate than 
nouns and adjectives. This is because verbs tend to 
be more complex than words in other grammatical 
categories. This also reminds us to pay more 
attention to verbs in building the new wordnet.

4 Compare Core Synsets of Five Chinese 
Wordnets 

Many efforts have been devoted to the construction 
of Chinese wordnets. To get a general idea of the 
quality of each wordnet, we randomly chose 200 
synsets from the core synsets of the five Chinese 

wordnets and manually made gold standard for 
Chinese entries. During this process, we noticed 
that due to language difference, it is hard to make a 
decision for some cases. In order to better compare 
the synset lemmas, we created both a strict gold 
standard and a loose gold standard. 

4.1     Creating Gold Standards 

This section discusses the gold standard from word 
meaning, POS and word relation.  

4.1.1    Word Meaning 

Leech (1974) recognized seven types of meaning: 
conceptual meaning, connotative meaning, social 
meaning, affective meaning, reflected meaning, 
collocative meaning and thematic meaning.  Fu 
(1985) divided word meaning into conceptual 
meaning and affiliated meaning. The latter is 
composed of affective color, genre color and 
image color. Liu (1990) divided word meaning 
into conceptual meaning and color meaning. The 
latter is further divided into affective color, attitude 
color, evaluation color, image color, genre color, 
style color, (literary or artistic) style color and tone 
color. Ge (2006) divided word meaning into 
conceptual meaning, color meaning and 
grammatical meaning. 
    Following these studies, the following section 
divides word meaning into conceptual meaning 
and affiliated meaning. Words with similar 
conceptual meaning may differ in the meaning 
severity and the scope of meaning usage. 
Regarding affiliated meaning, words may differ in 
affection, genre and time of usage. 

4.1.1.1   Conceptual Meaning 

Some English synset have exact equivalents in 
Chinese. For example, the following 
synset 02692232-n has a precise 
Chinese equivalent 机场 jīchǎng ‘airport’. 
    02692232-n airport; airdrome; aerodrome; 
drome “an airfield equipped with control tower and 
hangars as well as accommodations for passengers and 
cargo” 
    However, in many cases, words of two 
languages may have similar basic conceptual 
meaning, but the meanings differ in severity and 

14



usage scope. 
 
 
(i) Meaning Severity 
    Regarding the synset 00618057-v, 出错 chūcuò 
and 犯错 fàncuò are equivalent translation. In 
contrast, 失足  shīzú ‘make a serious mistake’ is 
much stronger and should be in a separate synset. 
    00618057-v stumble; slip up; trip up “make an 
error”: She slipped up and revealed the name 
(ii) Usage Scope of Meaning 
    For the synset 00760916-a, no Chinese lemma 
has as wide usage as “direct”. Thus all the Chinese 
translations, such as 直达 zhídá ‘directly arriving’ 
and 直接 zhíjiē ‘direct’ have a narrower usage 
scope.     
    00760916-a  direct  “direct in spatial dimensions; 
proceeding without deviation or interruption; straight 
and short”:  a direct route;  a direct flight;  a direct hit  

4.1.1.2   Affiliated Meaning 

With respect to affiliated meaning, words may 
differ in affection, genre and time of usage. 
(i) Affection 
    The synset 09179776-n refers to “positive” 
influence, so 激励 jīlì ‘incentive’ is a good entry. 
The word 刺激 cìjī  ‘stimulus’ is not necessarily 
“positive”. 
    09179776-n  incentive; inducement; motivator    “a 
positive motivational influence”  
(ii) Genre 
    In the synset  09823502-n, the translations 妗 jìn 
‘aunt’ and 妗母 jìnmǔ ‘aunt’ are Chinese dialects . 
    09823502-n  aunt; auntie; aunty  “the sister of your 
father or mother; the wife of your uncle”  
(iii) Time:  modern vs. ancient 
    In the synset 10582154-n, the translations 侍从
shìcóng ‘servant’, 仆 人 púrén ‘servant’, 侍 者
shìzhě ‘servant’ are used in ancient or modern 
China, rather than contemporary China. The word 
now used is 保姆 bǎomǔ ‘servant’ . 
    10582154-n servant; retainer “a person working in 
the service of another (especially in the household)”  

4.1.2    Part of Speech (POS) 

The Chinese entries should have the same POS as 
the English synset. In the synset 00760916-a, the 
translated word 径直 jìngzhí ‘directly’ is an adverb, 

which does not fit this synset. 
    00760916-a  direct  “direct in spatial dimensions; 
proceeding without deviation or interruption; straight 
and short”:  a direct route;  a direct flight;  a direct hit  

4.1.3    Word Relations 

One main challenge concerning word relations is 
hyponyms and hypernyms. In making our new 
wordnet and creating the loose gold standard, we 
treat the close hyponyms and close hypernyms as 
right, and the not so close ones as wrong. In the 
strict gold standard, we treat all of them as wrong.  
(i) Close Hyponym 
    The synset 06873139-n can refer to either the 
highest female voice or the voice of a boy before 
puberty. There is no single word with the two 
meanings in Chinese. The translation 女高音 nǚ 
gāoyīn ‘the highest female voice’ is a close 
hyponym of this synset. For cases like this, we 
would create two synsets for Chinese in the future. 
    06873139-n  soprano  “the highest female voice; the 
voice of a boy before puberty” 
(ii) Not Close Hyponym 
    The synset 10401829-n has good equivalences 
参 与 者 cānyùzhě ‘participant’ and 参 加 者
cānjiāzhě ‘participant’ in Chinese. The translation 
与会者 yùhuìzhě ‘people attending a conference’ 
refers to the people attending a conference, which 
is not a close hyponym.   
    10401829-n  participant  “someone who takes part in 
an activity” 
(iii) Close Hypernym 
    The synset 02267060-v has good equivalents 花
huā  ‘spend’ and 花费 huāfèi ‘spend’. It is also 
translated as 使 shǐ ‘use’ and 用 yòng ‘use’, which 
are close hypernyms. It is possible that the two 
hypernyms are so general that their most typical 
synset does not have the meaning of spending 
money. 
    02267060-v spend; expend; drop “pay out”: spend 
money 
(iv) Not Close Hypernym  
    The synset 02075049-v has good equivalents 
such as 逃走 táozǒu ‘scat’ and 逃跑 táopǎo ‘scat’. 
Meanwhile, it is translated to 跑 pǎo ‘run’ and 奔
bēn ‘rush’, which are not so close hypernyms. It is 
certain that to flee is to run, but the two hypernyms 
should have their own more suitable synsets.    
    02075049-v scat; run; scarper; turn_tail; lam; 
run_away; hightail_it; bunk; head_for_the_hills; 

15



take_to_the_woods; escape; fly_the_coop; break_away  
“flee; take to one's heels; cut and run”: If you see this

4.1.4    Grammatical Status 

Lexicalization is a process in which something 
becomes lexical (Lehmann, 2002). Due to 
historical and cultural reasons, different language 
lexicalizes different language elements. For 
example, there is no lexicalized word for the 
synset 02991555-n in Chinese. In Chinese, you 
must use a phrase or definition to mean what this 
synset expresses. 
    02991555-n  cell; cubicle  “small room in which a 
monk or nun lives”  
    Considering the differences among languages, 
we created two gold standards for 200 randomly 
chosen synsets: the strict gold standard and the 

loose gold standard. The former aims to find the 
best translation for a synset; while the latter finds 
the correct translation. The former has some 
disadvantages: it makes many Chinese words not 
have a corresponding synset in PWN; further, it 
makes many English synsets have no Chinese 
entry. The latter solves the problems, but it is not 
as accurate as the former. Table 4 summarizes the 
action taken for creating loose and strict gold 
standards, as well as showing our standard in 
making the new wordnet. The gold standard data 
was created by the authors in consultation with 
each other. Ideally it would be better if we got 
multiple annotators to provide inter-annotator 
agreement, but the current results are derived 
through discussion and making reference to many 
bilingual dictionaries and we have come to an 
agreement on them.

 4.2    Results, Discussion and Future Work 

We did some cleaning up before doing evaluation, 
including strip off 的 de /地 de at the end of a 
lemma, and the contents within parentheses. We 
also transferred the traditional characters in BOW 
and CWN to simplified characters. Through 
applying the standards illustrated in Table 1, we 

evaluated the dataset through counting the 
precision, recall and F-score. 

Precision = . 	 	 	 	 	 	. 	 	 	 	 	 	  

Recall =  . 	 	 	 	 	 	.

F-score =  2* 	∗		 	  

    The results of using the loose and strict gold 
standards are indicated in Table 5 and Table 6 
respectively. All wordnets were tested on the same 
samples described above. 
 
Wordnet COW BOW SEW WIKT CWN
precision 0.86 0.80 0.75 0.92 0.56
recall 0.77 0.48 0.45 0.32 0.08
F-score 0.81 0.60 0.56 0.47 0.14

Table 5. Loose gold standard 

Wordnet COW BOW SEW WIKT CWN
precision 0.81 0.76 0.70 0.88 0.46
recall 0.80 0.50 0.46 0.33 0.07
F-score 0.81 0.60 0.55 0.48 0.13

Table 6. Strict gold standard 

    The results of the two standards show roughly 
the same F-score: the strict/loose distinction does 
not have large effect. This is because there were 
few entries where the loose and strict gold 
standards actually differ. By using the strict gold 
standard, the recall of each wordnet increased 
except CWN. Meanwhile, the precision of each 
wordnet decreased.  
    COW was built using the results of both SEW 
and WIKT along with a lot of extra checking.  It is 
therefore not surprising that it got the best 
precision and recall.  Exploiting data from multiple 
existing wordnets makes a better resource. BOW 
ranked second according to the evaluation. It was 
bootstrapped from a translation equivalence 
database. Though this database was manually 
checked, it cannot guarantee that they will give an 
accurate wordnet. SEW and WIKT were 
automatically constructed and thus have low F-
score, but WIKT has high precision. This is 
because it was created using 20 languages to 
disambiguate the meaning instead of only looking 
at English and Chinese. CWN turned out to have 
the lowest score. This is because the editors are 
mainly focusing on implementing new theories of 
complex semantic types and not aiming for high 
coverage. 
    Among all the five wordnets we compared, 
COW is the best according to the evaluation. 
However, even though both it and BOW were 
carefully checked by linguists, there are still some 

mistakes, which show the difficulty in creating a 
wordnet. The errors mainly come from the 
polysemous words, which may have been assigned 
to another synset. One reason leading to such 
errors comes from the fact that core synsets alone 
do not show all the senses of a lemma. If a lemma 
is divided into different senses especially when 
they are fine-grained and only one of the senses is 
presented to the editors, it is hard to decide which 
is the best entry for another language. What we 
have done with the core synsets is a trial to find the 
problems and test our method. It is definitely not 
enough to go through all the data once, and thus 
we will further revise all the wrong lemmas. By 
taking the core synset as the starting point of our 
large-scale project on constructing COW, we not 
only got more insight into language disparities 
between English and Chinese, but also become 
clearer about what rules to take in constructing 
wordnets, which will in turn benefit the 
construction of other high-quality wordnets.  
    In further efforts we are validating the entries by 
sense tagging parallel corpora (Bond et al, 2013): 
this allows us to see the words in use and compare 
them to wordnets in different languages.  
Monolingually, it allows us to measure the 
distribution of word senses. With the construction 
of a high-accuracy, high-coverage Chinese 
wordnet, it will not only promote the development 
of Chinese Information Processing, but also 
improve the combined multilingual wordnet. 
   We would also like to investigate making 
wordnet in traditional characters as default and 
automatically converting to simplified (it is lossy 
in the other direction).    

5 Conclusions  
This paper introduced our on-going work of 
building a new Chinese Open wordnet: NTU COW. 
Due to language divergence, we met many 
theoretical and practical issues. Starting from the 
core synsets, we formulated our guidelines and 
become clearer about how to make a better 
wordnet. Through comparing the core synsets of 
five wordnets, the results show that our new 
wordnet is the current best. Although we carefully 
checked the core synsets, however, we still spotted 
some errors which mainly come from selecting the 
suitable sense of polysemous words. This leaves us 
space for more improvement and gives us a lesson 

17



about how to make the remaining parts much 
better.  The wordnet is open source, so the data can 
be used by anyone at all, including the other 
wordnet projects.
