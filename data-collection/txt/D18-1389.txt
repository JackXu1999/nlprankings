Abstract

We present a study on predicting the factual-
ity of reporting and bias of news media. While
previous work has focused on studying the ve-
racity of claims or documents, here we are in-
terested in characterizing entire news media.
These are under-studied but arguably impor-
tant research problems, both in their own right
and as a prior for fact-checking systems. We
experiment with a large list of news websites
and with a rich set of features derived from
(i) a sample of articles from the target news
medium, (ii) its Wikipedia page, (iii) its Twit-
ter account, (iv) the structure of its URL, and
(v) information about the Web traffic it attracts.
The experimental results show sizable perfor-
mance gains over the baselines, and confirm
the importance of each feature type.

1 Introduction

The rise of social media has democratized con-
tent creation and has made it easy for everybody
to share and spread information online. On the
positive side, this has given rise to citizen journal-
ism, thus enabling much faster dissemination of
information compared to what was possible with
newspapers, radio, and TV. On the negative side,
stripping traditional media from their gate-keeping
role has left the public unprotected against the
spread of misinformation, which could now travel
at breaking-news speed over the same democratic
channel. This has given rise to the proliferation
of false information that is typically created ei-
ther (a) to attract network traffic and gain finan-
cially from showing online advertisements, e.g., as
is the case of clickbait, or (b) to affect individual
people’s beliefs, and ultimately to influence major
events such as political elections (Vosoughi et al.,
2018). There are strong indications that false in-
formation was weaponized at an unprecedented
scale during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

“Fake news”, which can be defined as “fabri-
cated information that mimics news media con-
tent in form but not in organizational process or
intent” (Lazer et al., 2018), became the word of
the year in 2017, according to Collins Dictio-
nary. “Fake news” thrive on social media thanks
to the mechanism of sharing, which amplifies ef-
fect. Moreover, it has been shown that “fake news”
spread faster than real news (Vosoughi et al.,
2018). As they reach the same user several times,
the effect is that they are perceived as more cred-
ible, unlike old-fashioned spam that typically dies
the moment it reaches its recipients. Naturally,
limiting the sharing of “fake news” is a major fo-
cus for social media such as Facebook and Twitter.

Additional efforts to combat “fake news” have
been led by fact-checking organizations such as
Snopes, FactCheck and Politifact, which manu-
ally verify claims. Unfortunately, this is inefficient
for several reasons. First, manual fact-checking is
slow and debunking false information comes too
late to have any significant impact. At the same
time, automatic fact-checking lags behind in terms
of accuracy, and it is generally not trusted by hu-
man users. In fact, even when done by reputable
fact-checking organizations, debunking does little
to convince those who already believe in false in-
formation.

A third, and arguably more promising, way
to fight “fake news” is to focus on their source.
While “fake news” are spreading primarily on so-
cial media, they still need a “home”, i.e., a website
where they would be posted. Thus, if a website is
known to have published non-factual information
in the past, it is likely to do so in the future. Ver-
ifying the reliability of the source of information
is one of the basic tools that journalists in tradi-
tional media use to verify information. It is also
arguably an important prior for fact-checking sys-
tems (Popat et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018).

Fact-checking organizations have been producing
lists of unreliable online news sources, but these
are incomplete and get outdated quickly. There-
fore, there is a need to predict the factuality of re-
porting for a given online medium automatically,
which is the focus of the present work. We further
study the bias of the source (left vs. right), as the
two problems are inter-connected, e.g., extreme-
left and extreme-right websites tend to score low
in terms of factual reporting. Our contributions
can be summarized as follows:

• We focus on an under-explored but arguably
very important problem: predicting the factu-
ality of reporting of a news medium. We fur-
ther study bias, which is also under-explored.

• We create a new dataset of news media
sources, which has annotations for both tasks,
and is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than
what was used in previous work. We release
the dataset and our code, which should facil-
itate future research.1

• We use a variety of sources such as (i) a
sample of articles from the target website,
(ii) its Wikipedia page, (iii) its Twitter ac-
count, (iv) the structure of its URL, and (v) in-
formation about the Web traffic it has at-
tracted. This combination, as well as some
of the sources, are novel for these problems.

• We further perform an ablation study of the
impact of the individual (groups of) features.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 provides an overview of related
work. Section 3 describes our method and fea-
tures. Section 4 presents the data, the experiments,
and the evaluation results. Finally, Section 5 con-
cludes with some directions for future work.

2 Related Work

Journalists, online users, and researchers are well-
aware of the proliferation of false information, and
thus topics such as credibility and fact-checking
are becoming increasingly important. For exam-
ple, the ACM Transactions on Information Sys-
tems journal dedicated, in 2016, a special issue on
Trust and Veracity of Information in Social Media
(Papadopoulos et al., 2016).

1The data and the code are at http://github.mit.
edu/CSAIL-SLS/News-Media-Reliability/

There have also been some related shared tasks
such as the SemEval-2017 task 8 on Rumor De-
tection (Derczynski et al., 2017), the CLEF-2018
lab on Automatic Identification and Verification
of Claims in Political Debates (Atanasova et al.,
2018; Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2018; Nakov et al.,
2018), and the FEVER-2018 task on Fact Extrac-
tion and VERification (Thorne et al., 2018).

The interested reader can learn more about
“fake news” from the overview by Shu et al.
(2017), which adopted a data mining perspective
and focused on social media. Another recent sur-
vey was run by Thorne and Vlachos (2018), which
took a fact-checking perspective on “fake news”
and related problems. Yet another survey was per-
formed by Li et al. (2016), covering truth dis-
covery in general. Moreover, there were two re-
cent articles in Science: Lazer et al. (2018) of-
fered a general overview and discussion on the sci-
ence of “fake news”, while Vosoughi et al. (2018)
focused on the process of proliferation of true
and false news online. In particular, they ana-
lyzed 126K stories tweeted by 3M people more
than 4.5M times, and confirmed that “fake news”
spread much wider than true news.

Veracity of information has been studied at dif-
ferent levels: (i) claim-level (e.g., fact-checking),
(ii) article-level (e.g., “fake news” detection),
(iii) user-level (e.g., hunting for trolls), and
(iv) medium-level (e.g., source reliability estima-
tion). Our primary interest here is in the latter.

2.1 Fact-Checking

At the claim-level, fact-checking and rumor de-
tection have been primarily addressed using infor-
mation extracted from social media, i.e., based on
how users comment on the target claim (Canini
et al., 2011; Castillo et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2015,
2016; Zubiaga et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2017; Dungs
et al., 2018; Kochkina et al., 2018). The Web
has also been used as a source of information
(Mukherjee and Weikum, 2015; Popat et al., 2016,
2017; Karadzhov et al., 2017b; Mihaylova et al.,
2018; Baly et al., 2018).

In both cases, the most important information
sources are stance (does a tweet or a news article
agree or disagree with the claim?), and source re-
liability (do we trust the user who posted the tweet
or the medium that published the news article?).
Other important sources are linguistic expression,
meta information, and temporal dynamics.

2.2 Stance Detection

Stance detection has been addressed as a task in
its own right, where models have been devel-
oped based on data from the Fake News Chal-
lenge (Riedel et al., 2017; Thorne et al., 2017;
Mohtarami et al., 2018; Hanselowski et al., 2018),
or from SemEval-2017 Task 8 (Derczynski et al.,
2017; Dungs et al., 2018; Zubiaga et al., 2018). It
has also been studied for other languages such as
Arabic (Darwish et al., 2017b; Baly et al., 2018).

2.3 Source Reliability Estimation

Unlike stance detection, the problem of source
reliability remains largely under-explored. In
the case of social media, it concerns modeling
the user2 who posted a particular message/tweet,
while in the case of the Web, it is about the trust-
worthiness of the source (the URL domain, the
medium). The latter is our focus in this paper.

In previous work, the source reliability of
news media has often been estimated automati-
cally based on the general stance of the target
medium with respect to known manually fact-
checked claims, without access to gold labels
about the overall medium-level factuality of re-
porting (Mukherjee and Weikum, 2015; Popat
et al., 2016, 2017, 2018). The assumption is that
reliable media agree with true claims and disagree
with false ones, while for unreliable media it is
mostly the other way around. The trustworthiness
of Web sources has also been studied from a Data
Analytics perspective. For instance, Dong et al.
(2015) proposed that a trustworthy source is one
that contains very few false facts. In this paper, we
follow a different approach by studying the source
reliability as a task in its own right, using manual
gold annotations specific for the task.

Note that estimating the reliability of a source
is important not only when fact-checking a claim
(Popat et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018), but it also
gives an important prior when solving article-level
tasks such as “fake news” and click-bait detection
(Brill, 2001; Finberg et al., 2002; Hardalov et al.,
2016; Karadzhov et al., 2017a; De Sarkar et al.,
2018; Pan et al., 2018; Pérez-Rosas et al., 2018).

2User modeling in social media and news community fo-
rums has focused on finding malicious users such as opinion
manipulation trolls, paid (Mihaylov et al., 2015b) or just per-
ceived (Mihaylov et al., 2015a; Mihaylov and Nakov, 2016;
Mihaylov et al., 2018; Mihaylova et al., 2018), sockpuppets
(Maity et al., 2017), Internet water army (Chen et al., 2013),
and seminar users (Darwish et al., 2017a).

2.4 “Fake News” Detection

Most work on “fake news” detection has relied on
medium-level labels, which were then assumed to
hold for all articles from that source.

Horne and Adali (2017) analyzed three small
datasets ranging from a couple of hundred to a few
thousand articles from a couple of dozen sources,
comparing (i) real news vs. (ii) “fake news” vs.
(iii) satire, and found that the latter two have a lot
in common across a number of dimensions. They
designed a rich set of features that analyze the text
of a news article, modeling its complexity, style,
and psychological characteristics. They found that
“fake news” pack a lot of information in the title
(as the focus is on users who do not read beyond
the title), and use shorter, simpler, and repetitive
content in the body (as writing fake information
takes a lot of effort). Thus, they argued that the
title and the body should be analyzed separately.

In follow-up work, Horne et al. (2018b) created
a large-scale dataset covering 136K articles from
92 sources from opensources.co, which they
characterize based on 130 features from seven cat-
egories: structural, sentiment, engagement, topic-
dependent, complexity, bias, and morality. We use
this set of features when analyzing news articles.

In yet another follow-up work, Horne et al.
(2018a) trained a classifier to predict whether a
given news article is coming from a reliable or
from an unreliable (“fake news” or conspiracy)3

source. Note that they assumed that all news from
a given website would share the same reliability
class. Such an assumption is fine for training (dis-
tant supervision), but we find it problematic for
testing, where we believe manual documents-level
labels are needed.

Potthast et al. (2018) used 1,627 articles from
nine sources, whose factuality has been manu-
ally verified by professional journalists from Buz-
zFeed. They applied stylometric analysis, which
was originally designed for authorship verifica-
tion, to predict factuality (fake vs. real).

Rashkin et al. (2017) focused on the language
used by “fake news” and compared the prevalence
of several features in articles coming from trusted
sources vs. hoaxes vs. satire vs. propaganda.
However, their linguistic analysis and their auto-
matic classification were at the article level and
they only covered eight news media sources.

3We show in parentheses, the labels from
opensources.co that are used to define a category.

Unlike the above work, (i) we perform classifi-
cation at the news medium level rather than fo-
cusing on an individual article. Thus, (ii) we use
reliable manually-annotated labels as opposed to
noisy labels resulting from projecting the cate-
gory of a news medium to all news articles pub-
lished by this medium (as most of the work above
did).4 Moreover, (iii) we use a much larger set
of news sources, namely 1,066, which is 1-2 or-
ders of magnitude larger than what was used in
previous work. Furthermore, (iv) we use a larger
number of features and a wider variety of feature
types compared to the above work, including fea-
tures extracted from knowledge sources that have
been largely neglected in the literature so far such
as information from Wikipedia and the structure
of the medium’s URL.

2.5 Media Bias Detection
As we mentioned above, bias was used as a
feature for “fake news” detection (Horne et al.,
2018b). It has also been the target of classifica-
tion, e.g., Horne et al. (2018a) predicted whether
an article is biased (political or bias) vs. unbiased.
Similarly, Potthast et al. (2018) classified the bias
in a target article as (i) left vs. right vs. main-
stream, or as (ii) hyper-partisan vs. mainstream.
Finally, Rashkin et al. (2017) studied propaganda,
which can be seen as extreme bias. See also a re-
cent position paper (Pitoura et al., 2018) and an
overview on bias the Web (Baeza-Yates, 2018).

Unlike the above work, we focus on bias at the
medium level rather than at the article level. More-
over, we work with fine-grained labels on an ordi-
nal scale rather then having a binary setup (some
work above had three degrees of bias, while we
have seven).

3 Method

In order to predict the factuality of reporting and
the bias for a given news medium, we collect in-
formation from multiple relevant sources, which
we use to train a classifier. In particular, we col-
lect a rich set of features derived from (i) a sample
of articles from the target news medium, (ii) its
Wikipedia page if it exists, (iii) its Twitter account
if it exists, (iv) the structure of its URL, and (v) in-
formation about the Web traffic it has attracted.
We describe each of these sources below.

4Two notable exceptions are (Potthast et al., 2018) and
(Pérez-Rosas et al., 2018), who use news articles whose fac-
tuality has been manually checked and annotated.

Articles We argue that analysis (textual, syntac-
tic and semantic) of the content of the news arti-
cles published by a given target medium should be
critical for assessing the factuality of its reporting,
as well as of its potential bias. Towards this goal,
we borrow a set of 141 features that were previ-
ously proposed for detecting “fake news” articles
(Horne et al., 2018b), as we have described above.
These features are used to analyze the following
article characteristics:

• Structure: POS tags, linguistic features
based on the use of specific words (function
words, pronouns, etc.), and features for click-
bait title classification from (Chakraborty
et al., 2016);

• Sentiment: sentiment scores using lexicons
(Recasens et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2013)
and full systems (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014);

• Engagement: number of shares, reactions,
and comments on Facebook;

• Topic: lexicon features to differentiate be-
tween science topics and personal concerns;

• Complexity: type-token ratio, readability,
number of cognitive process words (identify-
ing discrepancy, insight, certainty, etc.);

• Bias: features modeling bias using lexi-
cons (Recasens et al., 2013; Mukherjee and
Weikum, 2015) and subjectivity as calculated
using pre-trained classifiers (Horne et al.,
2017);

• Morality: features based on the Moral Foun-
dation Theory (Graham et al., 2009) and lex-
icons (Lin et al., 2017)

Further details are available in (Horne et al.,
2018b). For each target medium, we retrieve some
articles, then we calculate these features separately
for the title and for the body of each article, and
finally we average the values of the 141 features
over the set of retrieved articles.

Wikipedia We further leverage Wikipedia as an
additional source of information that can help pre-
dict the factuality of reporting and the bias of a
target medium. For example, the absence of a
Wikipedia page may indicate that a website is not
credible. Also, the content of the page might ex-
plicitly mention that a certain website is satirical,
left-wing, or has some property related to our task.



3532

Accordingly, we extract the following features:

• Has Page: indicates whether the target
medium has a Wikipedia page;

• Vector representation for each of the follow-
ing segments of the Wikipedia page, when-
ever applicable: Content, Infobox, Summary,
Categories, and Table of Contents. We gen-
erate these representations by averaging the
word embeddings (pretrained word2vec em-
beddings) of the corresponding words.

Twitter Given the proliferation of social media,
most news media have Twitter accounts, which
they use to reach out to more users online. The
information that can be extracted from a news
medium’s Twitter profile can be valuable for our
tasks. In particular, we use the following features:

• Has Account: Whether the medium has a
Twitter account. We check this based on the
top results for a search against Google, re-
stricting the domain to twitter.com. The
idea is that media that publish unreliable in-
formation might have no Twitter accounts.

• Verified: Whether the account is verified by
Twitter. The assumption is that “fake news”
media would be less likely to have their Twit-
ter account verified. They might be interested
in pushing their content to users via Twitter,
but they would also be cautious about reveal-
ing who they are (which is required by Twit-
ter to get them verified).

• Created: The year the account was created.
The idea is that accounts that have been active
over a longer period of time are more likely
to belong to established media.

• Has Location: Whether the account provides
information about its location. The idea is
that established media are likely to have this
public, while “fake news” media may want to
hide it.

• URL Match: Whether the account includes a
URL to the medium, and whether it matches
the URL we started the search with. Estab-
lished media are interested in attracting traf-
fic to their website, while fake media might
not. Moreover, some fake accounts mimic
genuine media, but have a slightly different
domain, e.g., .com.co instead of .com.

• Counts: Statistics about the number of
friends, statuses, and favorites. Established
media might have higher values for these.

• Description: A vector representation gener-
ated by averaging the Google News embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2013) of all words of
the profile description paragraph. These short
descriptions might contain an open declara-
tion of partisanship, i.e., left or right polit-
ical ideology (bias). This could also help
predict factuality as extreme partisanship of-
ten implies low factuality. In contrast, “fake
news” media might just leave this description
empty, while high-quality media would want
to give some information about who they are.

URL We also collect additional information
from the website’s URL using character-based
modeling and hand-crafted features. URL features
are commonly used in phishing website detection
systems to identify malicious URLs that aim to
mislead users (Ma et al., 2009). As we want to
predict a website’s factuality, using URL features
is justified by the fact that low-quality websites
sometimes try to mimic popular news media by us-
ing a URL that looks similar to the credible source.
We use the following URL-related features:

• Character-based: Used to model the URL by
representing it in the form of a one-hot vec-
tor of character n-grams, where n ∈ [2, 5].
Note that these features are not used in the fi-
nal system as they could not outperform the
baseline (when used in isolation).

• Orthographic: These features are very ef-
fective for detecting phishing websites, as
malicious URLs tend to make excessive use
of special characters and sections, and ulti-
mately end up being longer. For this work,
we use the length of the URL, the number of
sections and the excessive use of special char-
acters such as digits, hyphens and dashes. In
particular, we identify whether the URL con-
tains digits, dashes or underscores as individ-
ual symbols, which were found to be useful
as features for detecting phishing URLs (Bas-
net et al., 2014). We also check whether the
URL contains short (less than three symbols)
or long sections (more than ten symbols), as
a high number of such sections could indicate
an irregular URL.

• Credibility: Model the website’s URL
credibility by analyzing whether it (i) uses
https://, (ii) resides on a blog-hosting
platform such as blogger.com, and
(iii) uses a special top-level domain,
e.g., .gov is for governmental websites,
which are generally credible and unbiased,
whereas .co is often used to mimic .com.

Web Traffic Analyzing the web traffic to the
website of the medium might be useful for de-
tecting phishy websites that come and disappear
in certain patterns. Here, we only use the recip-
rocal value of the website’s Alexa Rank,5 which is
a global ranking for over 30 million websites in
terms of the traffic they receive.

We evaluate the above features in Section 4,
both individually and as groups, in order to deter-
mine which ones are important to predict factual-
ity and bias, and also to identify the ones that are
worth further investigation in future work.

4 Experiments and Evaluation

4.1 Data
We use information about news media listed on the
Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) website,6 which
contains manual annotations and analysis of the
factuality of reporting and/or bias for over 2,000
news websites. Our dataset includes 1,066 web-
sites for which both bias and factuality labels were
explicitly provided, or could be easily inferred
(e.g., satire is of low factuality).

5http://www.alexa.com/
6https://mediabiasfactcheck.com

We model factuality on a 3-point scale (Low,
Mixed, and High),7 and bias on a 7-point scale
(Extreme-Left, Left, Center-Left, Center, Center-
Right, Right, and Extreme-Right).

Some examples from our dataset are presented
in Table 1 for factuality of reporting, and in Ta-
ble 2 for bias. In both tables, we show the names
of the media, as well as their corresponding Twit-
ter handles and Wikipedia pages, which we found
automatically. Overall, 64% of the websites in our
dataset have Wikipedia pages, and 94% have Twit-
ter accounts. In cases of “fake news” sites that
try to mimic real ones, e.g., ABCnews.com.co
is a fake version of ABCnews.com, it is possible
that our Twitter extractor returns the handle for the
real medium. This is where the URL Match feature
comes handy (see above).

Table 3 provides detailed statistics about the
dataset. Note that we have 1-2 orders of magni-
tude more media sources than what has been used
in previous studies, as we already mentioned in
Section 2 above.

Table 4: Results for factuality and bias prediction. Bold values indicate the best-performing feature type
in its family of features, while underlined values indicate the best-performing feature type overall.

In order to compute the article-related features, we
did the following: (i) we crawled 10–100 articles
per website (a total of 94,814), (ii) we computed
a feature vector for each article, and (iii) we aver-
aged the feature vectors for the articles from the
same website to obtain the final vector of article-
related features.

4.2 Experimental Setup

We used the above features in a Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM) classifier, training a separate
model for factuality and for bias. We report re-
sults for 5-fold cross-validation. We tuned the
SVM hyper-parameters, i.e., the cost C, the ker-
nel type, and the kernel width γ, using an internal
cross-validation on the training set and optimiz-
ing macro-averaged F1. Generally, the RBF ker-
nel performed better than the linear kernel.

We report accuracy and macro-averaged F1
score. We also report Mean Average Error (MAE),
which is relevant given the ordinal nature of
both the factuality and the bias classes, and also
MAEM , which is a variant of MAE that is more
robust to class imbalance. See (Baccianella et al.,
2009; Rosenthal et al., 2017) for more details
about MAEM vs. MAE.

4.3 Results and Discussion

We present in Table 4 the results of using features
from the different sources proposed in Section 3.
We start by describing the contribution of each
feature type towards factuality and bias.

We can see that the textual features extracted
from the ARTICLES yielded the best performance
on factuality. They also perform well on bias, be-
ing the only type that beats the baseline on MAE.
These results indicate the importance of analyzing
the contents of the target website. They also show
that using the titles only is not enough, and that the
article bodies contain important information that
should not be ignored.

Overall, the WIKIPEDIA features are less use-
ful for factuality, and perform reasonably well for
bias. The best features from this family are those
about the page content, which includes a general
description of the medium, its history, ideology
and other information that can be potentially help-
ful. Interestingly, the has page feature alone yields
sizable improvement over the baseline, especially
for factuality. This makes sense given that trust-
worthy websites are more likely to have Wikipedia
pages; yet, this feature does not help much for pre-
dicting political bias.

Table 6: Ablation study for the contribution of each feature type for predicting media bias.

The TWITTER features perform moderately for
factuality and poorly for bias. This is not sur-
prising, as we normally may not be able to tell
much about the political ideology of a website just
by looking at its Twitter profile (not its tweets!)
unless something is mentioned in its description,
which turns out to perform better than the rest of
the features from this family. We can see that the
has twitter feature is less effective than has wiki
for factuality, which makes sense given that Twit-
ter is less regulated than Wikipedia. Note that the
counts features yield reasonable performance, in-
dicating that information about activity (e.g., num-
ber of statuses) and social connectivity (e.g., num-
ber of followers) is useful. Overall, the TWITTER
features seem to complement each other, as their
union yields the best performance on factuality.

The URL features are better used for factual-
ity rather than bias prediction. This is mainly due
to the nature of these features, which are aimed
at detecting phishing websites, as we mentioned
in Section 3. Overall, this feature family yields
slight improvements, suggesting that it can be use-
ful when used together with other features.

Finally, the Alexa rank does not improve over
the baseline, which suggests that more sophisti-
cated TRAFFIC-related features might be needed.

4.4 Ablation Study

Finally, we performed an ablation study in order
to evaluate the impact of removing one family of
features at a time, as compared to the FULL sys-
tem, which uses all the features. We can see in
Tables 5 and 6 that the FULL system achieved the
best results for factuality, and the best macro-F1
for bias, suggesting that the different types of fea-
tures are largely complementary and capture dif-
ferent aspects that are all important for making a
good classification decision.

For factuality, excluding the WIKIPEDIA fea-
tures yielded the biggest drop in performance.
This suggests that they provide information that
may not be available in other sources, includ-
ing the ARTICLES, which achieved better results
alone. On the other hand, excluding the TRAFFIC
feature had no effect on the model’s performance.

For bias, we experimented with classification
on both a 7-point and a 3-point scale.8 Sim-
ilarly to factuality, the results in Table 6 indi-
cate that WIKIPEDIA offers complementary infor-
mation that is critical for bias prediction, while
TRAFFIC makes virtually no difference.

8We performed the following mapping:
{Extreme-Right, Right}→Right, {Extreme-Left, Left}→Left,
and {Center, Right-Center, Left-Center}→Center

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a study on predicting factual-
ity of reporting and bias of news media, focus-
ing on characterizing them as a whole. These
are under-studied, but arguably important research
problems, both in their own right and as a prior for
fact-checking systems.

We have created a new dataset of news media
sources that has annotations for both tasks and is
1-2 orders of magnitude larger than what was used
in previous work. We are releasing the dataset and
our code, which should facilitate future research.

We have experimented with a rich set of features
derived from the contents of (i) a sample of articles
from the target news medium, (ii) its Wikipedia
page, (iii) its Twitter account, (iv) the structure of
its URL, and (v) information about the Web traffic
it has attracted. This combination, as well as some
of the types of features, are novel for this problem.

Our evaluation results have shown that most of
these features have a notable impact on perfor-
mance, with the articles from the target website,
its Wikipedia page, and its Twitter account being
the most important (in this order). We further per-
formed an ablation study of the impact of the indi-
vidual types of features for both tasks, which could
give general directions for future research.

In future work, we plan to address the task as
ordinal regression, and further to model the inter-
dependencies between factuality and bias in a joint
model. We are also interested in characterizing
the factuality of reporting for media in other lan-
guages. Finally, we want to go beyond left vs.
right bias that is typical of the Western world and
to model other kinds of biases that are more rele-
vant for other regions, e.g., islamist vs. secular is
one such example for the Muslim World.
