Abstract

We describe a multi-task learning approach
to train a Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
model with a Relevance-based Auxiliary Task
(RAT) for search query translation. The trans-
lation process for Cross-lingual Information
Retrieval (CLIR) task is usually treated as a
black box and it is performed as an indepen-
dent step. However, an NMT model trained
on sentence-level parallel data is not aware of
the vocabulary distribution of the retrieval cor-
pus. We address this problem with our multi-
task learning architecture that achieves 16%
improvement over a strong NMT baseline on
Italian-English query-document dataset. We
show using both quantitative and qualitative
analysis that our model generates balanced
and precise translations with the regulariza-
tion effect it achieves from multi-task learning
paradigm.

1 Introduction

CLIR systems retrieve documents written in a lan-
guage that is different from search query language
(Nie, 2010). The primary objective of CLIR is to
translate or project a query into the language of the
document repository (Sokokov et al., 2013), which
we refer to as Retrieval Corpus (RC). To this end,
common CLIR approaches translate search queries
using a Machine Translation (MT) model and then
use a monolingual IR system to retrieve from RC.
In this process, a translation model is treated as a
black box (Sokolov et al., 2014), and it is usually
trained on a sentence level parallel corpus, which
we refer to as Translation Corpus (TC).

We address a pitfall of using existing MT models
for query translation (Sokokov et al., 2013). An
MT model trained on TC does not have any knowl-
edge of RC. In an extreme setting, where there
are no common terms between the target side of
TC and RC, a well trained and tested translation

model would fail because of vocabulary mismatch
between the translated query and documents of
RC. Assuming a relaxed scenario where some com-
monality exists between two corpora, a translation
model might still perform poorly, favoring terms
that are more likely in TC but rare in RC. Our hy-
pothesis is that a search query translation model
would perform better if a translated query term is
likely to appear in the both retrieval and translation
corpora, a property we call balanced translation.

To achieve balanced translations, it is desired
to construct an MT model that is aware of RC vo-
cabulary. Different types of MT approaches have
been adopted for CLIR task, such as dictionary-
based MT, rule-based MT, statistical MT etc. (Zhou
et al., 2012). However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, a neural search query translation approach
has yet to be taken by the community. NMT models
with attention based encoder-decoder techniques
have achieved state-of-the-art performance for sev-
eral language pairs (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We
propose a multi-task learning NMT architecture
that takes RC vocabulary into account by learn-
ing Relevance-based Auxiliary Task (RAT). RAT
is inspired from two word embedding learning
approaches: Relevance-based Word Embedding
(RWE) (Zamani and Croft, 2017) and Continuous
Bag of Words (CBOW) embedding (Mikolov et al.,
2013). We show that learning NMT with RAT en-
ables it to generate balanced translation.

NMT models learn to encode the meaning of a
source sentence and decode the meaning to gener-
ate words in a target language (Luong et al., 2015).
In the proposed multi-task learning model, RAT
shares the decoder embedding and final represen-
tation layer with NMT. Our architecture answers
the following question: In the decoding stage, can
we restrict an NMT model so that it does not only
generate terms that are highly likely in TC?. We
show that training a strong baseline NMT with RAT

roughly achieves 16% improvement over the base-
line. Using a qualitative analysis, we further show
that RAT works as a regularizer and prohibits NMT
to overfit to TC vocabulary.

2 Balanced Translation Approach

We train NMT with RAT to achieve better query
translations. We improve a recently proposed NMT
baseline, Transformer, that achieves state-of-the-
art results for sentence pairs in some languages
(Vaswani et al., 2017). We discuss Transformer,
RAT, and our multi-task learning architecture that
achieves balanced translation.

2.1 NMT and Transformer

In principle, we could adopt any NMT and com-
bine it with RAT. An NMT system directly mod-
els the conditional probability P (ti|si) of translat-
ing a source sentence, si = s1i , . . . , s

n
i , to a target

sentence ti = t1i , . . . , t
n
i . A basic form of NMT

comprises two components: (a) an encoder that
computes the representations or meaning of si and
(b) a decoder that generates one target word at a
time. State-of-the-art NMT models have an atten-
tion component that “searches for a set of positions
in a source sentence where the most relevant infor-
mation is concentrated” (Bahdanau et al., 2015).

For this study, we use a state-of-the-art NMT
model, Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), that
uses positional encoding and self attention mech-
anism to achieve three benefits over the existing
convolutional or recurrent neural network based
models: (a) reduced computational complexity of
each layer, (b) parallel computation, and (c) path
length between long-range dependencies.

2.2 Relevance-based Auxiliary Task (RAT)

We define RAT a variant of word embedding
task (Mikolov et al., 2013). Word embedding ap-
proaches learn high dimensional dense representa-
tions for words and their objective functions aim
to capture contextual information around a word.
Zamani and Croft (2017) proposed a model that
learns word vectors by predicting words in relevant
documents retrieved against a search query. We
follow the same idea but use a simpler learning
approach that is suitable for our task. They tried to
predict words from the relevance model (Lavrenko
and Croft, 2001) computed from a query, which
does not work for our task because the connection
between a query and ranked sentences falls rapidly

that, rectangles indicate data sources and rectangles

after the top one (see below).

We consider two data sources for learning NMT
and RAT jointly. The first one is a sentence-level
parallel corpus, which we refer to as translation
corpus, TC = {(si, ti); i = 1, 2, . . .m}. The sec-
ond one is the retrieval corpus, which is a collec-
tion of k documents RC = {D1, D2, . . . Dk} in
the same language as ti. Our word-embedding ap-
proach takes each ti ∈ TC, uses it as a query to
retrieve the top document Dtopi . After that we ob-
tain t′i by concatenating ti with D

top
i and randomly

shuffling the words in the combined sequence. We
then augment TC using t′i and obtain a dataset,
TC ′ = {(si, ti, t′i); i = 1, 2, . . .m}. We use t′i to
learn a continuous bag of words (CBOW) embed-
ding as proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). This
learning component shares two layers with the
NMT model. The goal is to expose the retrieval
corpus’ vocabulary to the NMT model. We discuss
layer sharing in the next section.

We select the single top document retrieved
against a sentence ti because a sentence is a weak
representation of information need. As a result,
documents at lower ranks show heavy shift from
the context of the sentence query. We verified this
by observing that a relevance model constructed
from the top k documents does not perform well
in this setting. We thus deviate from the relevance
model based approach taken by Zamani and Croft
(2017) and learn over the random shuffling of ti and
a single document. Random shuffling has shown
reasonable effectiveness for word embedding con-
struction for comparable corpus (Vulić and Moens,
2015).

2.3 Multi-task NMT Architecture

Our balanced translation architecture is presented
in Figure 1. This architecture is NMT-model ag-
nostic as we only propose to share two layers com-
mon to most NMTs: the trainable target embedding
layer and the transformation function (Luong et al.,
2015) that outputs a probability distribution over
the union of the vocabulary of TC and RC. Hence,
the size of the vocabulary, |RC ∪ TC|, is much
larger compared to TC and it enables the model to
access RC. In order to show task sharing clearly we
placed two shared layers between NMT and RAT
in Figure 1. We also show the two different paths
taken by two different tasks at training time: the
NMT path in shown with red arrows while the RAT
path is shown in green arrows.

On NMT path training loss is computed as the
sum of term-wise softmax with cross-entropy loss
of the predicted translation and the human transla-
tion and it summed over a batch of sentence pairs,
LNMT =

∑
(si,ti)∈T

∑|ti|
j=1− logP (t

j
i |t

<j
i , si).

We also use a similar loss function to train word
embedding over a set of context (ctx) and pivot
(pvt) pairs formed using ti as query to retrieve
Dtopi using Query Likelihood (QL) ranker, LWE =
α

∑
(ctx,pvt)

− logP (pvt | ctx). This objective is sim-

ilar to CBOW word embedding as context is used
to predict pivot word Here, we use a scaling factor
α, to have a balance between the gradients from the
NMT loss and RAT loss. For RAT, the context is
drawn from a context window following Mikolov
et al. (2013).

In the figure, (si, ti) ∈ TC and Dtopi represents
the top document retrieved against ti. The shuffler
component shuffles ti and D

top
i and creates (con-

text, pivot) pairs. After that those data points are
passed through a fully connected linear projection
layer and eventually to the transformation function.
Intuitively, the word embedding task is similar to
NMT as it tries to assign a large probability mass to
a target word given a context. However, it enables
the transformation function and decoding layer to
assign probability mass not only to terms from TC,
but also to terms from RC. This implicitly pro-
hibits NMT to overfit and provides a regularization
effect. A similar technique was proposed by Kat-
suki Chousa (2018) to handle out-of-vocabulary or
less frequent words for NMT. For these terms they
enabled the transformation (also called the softmax
cross-entropy layer) to fairly distribute probability

mass among similar words. In contrast, we focus
on relevant terms rather than similar terms.

3 Experiments and Results

Data. We experiment on two language pairs:
{Italian, Finnish}→ English. Topics and relevance
judgments are obtained from the Cross-Language
Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2000-2003 campaigns
for bilingual ad-hoc retrieval tracks1. The Italian
and French topics are human translations of a set of
two hundred English topics. Our retrieval corpus is
the Los Angeles Times (LAT94) comprising over
113k news articles.

Topics without any relevant documents on
LAT94 are excluded resulting in 151 topics for both
Italian and Finnish language. Among the 151 top-
ics in our dataset, we randomly selected 50 queries
for validation and 101 queries for test. In the CLEF
literature, queries are constructed from either the
title field or a concatenation of title and description
fields of the topic sets. Following Vulić and Moens
(2015), we work on the longer queries.

For TC we use Europarl v7 sentence-aligned
corpus (Koehn, 2005). TC statistics in Table 1
indicates that we had around two million sentence
pairs for each language pairs.

and |VE | are the vocabulary size for the source lan-
guage and the target English language, respectively.

Text Pre-processing. For having text consis-
tency across TC and RC, we apply the following
pre-processing steps. Characters are normalized
by mapping diacritic characters to the correspond-
ing unmarked characters and lower-casing. We
remove non-alphabetic, non-printable, and punctu-
ation characters from each word. The NLTK library
(Bird and Loper, 2004) is used for tokenization and
stop-word removal. No stemming is performed.

Retrieval. For ranking documents, after query
translation, we use the Galago’s implementation2

of query likelihood using Dirichlet smoothing
(Zhai and Lafferty, 2004) with default parameters.

Table 2: Results for ranking with query translation

Training Technique. Before applying multi-
tasking we train the transformer to obtain a rea-
sonable MAP on the Val set. Then we spawn our
multi-task transformer from that point, also con-
tinuing to train the transformer. We use an early
stopping criterion to stop both the models, and eval-
uate performance on the test set. For NMT training
we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with
Adam Optimizer and learning rate of 0.01. We
found that a learning rate of 10−5 with the same
optimizer works well for the word embedding loss
minimization. From a training batch (we use dy-
namic size training batches), more data points are
actually created for the word embedding task be-
cause of large number of (context, pivot) pairs. We
allow the gradients from word embedding loss to
pass through the multi-tasking model at first, and
then apply NMT loss. Setting a lower learning rate
for the word embedding optimizer, and α = 0.1
allows the NMT gradient updates to be competitive.

Evaluation. Given that in CLIR the primary goal
is to get a better ranked list of documents against
a translated query, we only report Mean Average
Precision (MAP).

3.1 Results and Analysis
Table 2 shows the effectiveness of our model (multi-
task transformer) over the baseline transformer
(Vaswani et al., 2017). Our model achieves sig-
nificant performance gains in the test sets over the
baseline for both Italian and Finnish query transla-
tion. The overall low MAP for NMT can possibly
be improved with larger TC. Moreover, our model
validation approach requires access to RC index,
and it slows down overall training process. Hence,
we could not train our model for a large number
of epochs - it may be another cause of the low
performance.

Balance of Translations. We want to show that
translation terms generated by our multi-task trans-
former are roughly equally likely to be seen in the
Europarl corpus (TC) or the CLEF corpus (RC).
Given a translation term t, we compute the ratio of

Figure 2: Balance values of a sample of val queries

the probability of seeing t in TC and RC, PTC(t)PRC(t) .

Here, PTC(t) =
countTC(t)∑

t∈TC countTC(t)
and PRC(t) is

calculated similarly. Given a query qi and its trans-
lation Tm(qi) provided by model m, we calculate

the balance of m, B(Tm(qi)) =
∑

t∈Tm(q)
PTC (t)

PRC (t)

|Tm(q)| .
If B(Tm(qi)) is close to 1, the translation terms
are as likely in TC as in RC. Figure 2 shows the
balance values for transformer and our model for a
random sample of 20 queries from the validation
set of Italian queries, respectively. Figure 3 shows
the balance values for transformer and our model
for a random sample of 20 queries from the test
set of Italian queries, respectively. It is evident
that our model achieves better balance compared to
baseline transformer, except for a very few cases.

Precision and Recall of Translations. Given a
query Q , consider Q′ = {q′1, q′1, . . . , q′p} as the
set of terms from human translation of Q and
QM = {qM1 , qM2 , . . . , qMq } as the set of transla-
tion terms generated by model M . We define
PM (Q) =

QM∩Q′
|QM | and RM (Q) =

QM∩Q′
|Q′| as pre-

cision and recall of Q for model M . In Table 3, we
report average precision and recall for both trans-

former and our model across our train and valida-
tion query set over two language pairs. Our model
generates precise translation, i.e. it avoids terms
that might be useless or even harmful for retrieval.
Generally, from our observation, avoided terms are
highly likely terms from TC and they are gener-
ated because of translation model overfitting. Our
model achieves a regularization effect through an
auxiliary task. This confirms results from existing
multi-tasking literature (Ruder, 2017).

To explore translation quality, consider pair of
sample translations provided by two models. For
example, against an Italian query, medaglia oro
super vinse medaglia oro super olimpiadi invernali
lillehammer, translated term set from our model is
{gold, coin, super, free, harmonising, won, winter,
olympics}, while transformer output is {olympic,
gold, one, coin, super, years, won, parliament, also,
two, winter}. Term set from human translation is:
{super, gold, medal, won, lillehammer, olypmic,
winter, games}. Transformer comes up with terms
like parliament, also, two and years that never ap-
pears in human translation. We found that these
terms are very likely in Europarl and rare in CLEF.
Our model also generates terms such as harmon-
ising, free, olympics that not generated by trans-
former. However, we found that these terms are
equally likely in Europarl and CLEF.

4 Conclusion

We present a multi-task learning architecture to
learn NMT for search query translation. As the
motivating task is CLIR, we evaluated the rank-
ing effectiveness of our proposed architecture. We
used sentences from the target side of the parallel
corpus as queries to retrieve relevant document and
use terms from those documents to train a word
embedding model along with NMT. One big chal-
lenge in this landscape is to sample meaningful
queries from sentences as sentences do not directly
convey information need. In the future, we hope to
learn models that are able to sample search queries
or information needs from sentences and use the
output of that model to get relevant documents.
