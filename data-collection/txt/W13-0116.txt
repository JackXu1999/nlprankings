Abstract

We present a corpus-based investigation of cases of clause combination that can be expressed both
through coordination or with subordination. We analyse the data with a two-step computational model
which first distinguishes subordination from coordination and then determines the direction for cases
of subordination. We find that a wide range of features help with the prediction, notably frequency of
predicate participants, presence of adjuncts and sharing of participants between the clause predicates.

1 Introduction

Subordination and coordination are the two primary ways to combine syntactic phrases into sentences.
Coordination is a paratactic way of combining constituents (typically) of the same category, where the
whole construction has the same type as its daughters. Coordination stands in opposition to subordination,
where one constituent is syntactically dependent on another, and where the whole construction has the
same type as only one of its daughters, the head daughter. Figure 1 shows examples of both constructions.

In subordinate structures, the dependent constituent can occupy the position of either argument or
adjunct. In this paper, we ignore cases of subordinated argument clauses, since their occurrence is
mandated mainly by the subcategorization properties of the main clause predicate. Instead, we focus
on subordinated clauses that are adjuncts of the main clauses, such as gerund constructions or clauses
introduced by subordinating conjunctions (when, because, . . . ). Such adjunctive clauses typically describe
independent events that stand in some relation to the main clause event.

For such cases, the question arises what determines the speaker’s choice between subordination
and coordination. It is discussed controversially in the literature. Matthiessen and Thompson (1988)
argue that subordination and coordination constructions are grammaticalized discourse relations, with
coordination representing the paratactic discourse relations such as Sequence and adjunctive subordination
constructions representing subjective hypotactic discourse relations such as Condition or Circumstance.
Goldsmith (1985) and Culicover and Jackendoff (1997) list instances of coordination constructions with
semantics that is different from that of a sequence, and demonstrate that coordination constructions can
express, for example, condition (cf. the example in Figure. 1, a simplified version of their original example
You drink one more can of beer and I’m leaving). Similarly, there are coordination constructions with
causal, concessive, and other meanings.

The goal of our study is to analyze a broader range of factors and their influence on the coordina-
tion/subordination choice. To this end, we perform a corpus-based analysis that investigates properties of
predicates (and the events which they express) that correlate with the choice between subordination and
coordination.

Our study considers three groups of features that are useful for the prediction of clause combination
type between two clauses: the frequency and recency of predicates’ participants, the presence of adjuncts
and the sharing of semantic arguments between predicates. We show that the subordination-coordination
choice is not based exclusively on discourse factors, but also correlates with the presence of common
participants of predicates as well as with the number and type of predicate modifiers.

Plan of the paper. In Section 2 we formulate the task and present our method of feature evaluation. In
Section 3, we present the features and analyze their usefulness for the prediction tasks. Section 4 contains
the evaluation of our model against a majority-case baseline and a model that relies on morphological
features. We relate our research to previous studies in Section 5 and summarize the results and give
conclusions in Section 6.

2 Method

We adopt a corpus-based method to study the coordination vs. subordination choice. We use the OntoNotes
corpus (Pradhan et al., 2007) to extract cases of coordination and subordination and analyze various
classes of features that can be suspected in correlating with the coordination/subordination distinction.
We evaluate the predictions of our classifiers against the relations between clauses in the original text,
which we treat as the gold standard.

This section formulates our task more precisely. We begin by describing our operationalization of the
terms “coordination” and “subordination”. Then we propose a way to estimate the correlations between
the type of clause combination and features of the clauses. Finally, we describe the corpus that we exploit
in our experiments.

2.1 Operationalizing Subordination and Coordination

For the analysis, we need to define subordination and coordination constructions in terms of Penn Treebank
parse trees and other layers of corpus annotation. For all predicates marked in the PropBank layer of
the corpus annotation we define their VP projections (see examples in Figure 1). If the VPs (or their
dominating S-nodes) are located at the same level in the tree and if their mother node is also a VP (or an
S, respectively), and if they are linked by a coordination conjunction (a word with the part-of-speech CC),
we consider these pairs of predicates as coordination constructions. Subordination constructions are pairs
of predicates where one VP is embedded in another VP. More specifically, we define X to be subordinate
to Y if there are exactly two VPs on the path between X and Y which correspond to the projections of
X and Y, respectively.1. Additionally, we restrict our attention to subordinate clauses that are adjucts as
motivated in Section 1. We use the PropBank annotation layer to filter out all pairs where one of the

Haspelmath (2004).

predicates is marked as an argument of the second predicate, or where a predicate is the main verb of a
sentence that occupies a position of an argument. The semantic information from PropBank allows us to
distinguish between syntactically identical argument and adjunct clauses, e.g. “I liked singing” and “I
stood singing”. We also exclude all relative clauses and other clausal noun modifiers. For this, we make
sure that the path between predicate projections does not contain NPs.

2.2 Statistical Model and Evaluation

Given a pair of predicates (p1,p2), we are faced with two binary decision tasks: (a) p1 and p2 can be
coordinated or one of them can be subordinated to another, and (b) if the predicates form a subordination
construction, either of them can be the main predicate. The first task is the task of prediction the clause
combination type, the second is the task of predicting the direction of subodination.

For the purposes of computational modeling, we treat these two decisions as independent and
sequential. For each task, we train a binary classifier on sets of features that can influence the clause
combination type. More specifically, we make use of logistic regression models, a method that in the
past furnished estimates of the importance of different factors in explaining linguistic variation, see e.g.
Bresnan et al. (2007) or Hayes and Wilson (2008).

Formally, logistic regression models assume that datapoints consist of a set of predictors x and a
binary response variable y. They have the form

p(y = 1) =
1

1 + e−z
with z =

∑
i

βixi (1)

where p is the probability of a datapoint x, βi is the weight assigned to the predictor xi. Model estimation
sets the parameters β so that the likelihood of the observed (training) data is maximized.

We construct one classifier for each task and for each response variable: subord-type(p1, p2) com-
putes the probability for p1 and p2 being linked by a subordination relation, coord-type(p1, p2) computes
the probablity for the two predicates to be coordinated, subord-dir(p1, p2) calculates the probablity
the probability for p2 being subordinated to p1, and subord-type(p2, p1) computes the probability
that p2 dominates p1. For the first task, we compute the outcome as arg max{coord-type(p1, p2),
subord-type(p1, p2)}, and for the second task as arg max{subord-dir(p1, p2), subord-dir(p2, p1)}, re-
spectively. Note that we assume that coordination is a symmetrical relation and we do neither predict nor
utilize the linear order of predicates in the original sentence.

Within this scenario, we perform an analysis of individual features and feature groups according to
standard practice in the statistics community by considering the effect of features on the models’ residual
deviance. Residual deviance describes the ratio of the likelihood of the data under a “saturated” model to
the likelihood of the data under the actual model (Baayen, 2011). Large decreases in residual deviance
that result from the addition of a feature indicate that the feature has substantially increased the ability
of the model to explain the data. The statistical significance of the decrease can be determined with the
chi-square test.

Since this analysis considers only the training set, it is amenable to overfitting. We therefore add a
second kind of analysis that evaluates the model trained on an unseen test set. As the figure of merit, we
use simple accuracy (percentage of correctly predicted clause combination types) and compare it against
two different baselines (Section 4).

2.3 Corpus

We run our training and testing on the release 4.0 of the OntoNotes corpus (Pradhan et al. (2007)). It
contains several layers of annotation, including the PropBank annotation of predicate-argument structures
(Palmer et al., 2005), Penn Treebank-style parses (Marcus et al., 1993), and a coreference annotation layer
(BBN Technologies, 2007). The WSJ sections 00, 02-04, 09-12, 14, and 17 are used for training and
section 20 is used for testing. There are in total 732 documents in the training part of the corpus and 76 in
the testing subcorpus. Documents include an average of 46.4 sentences and 109.3 predicates, respectively.

Table 1: Training and testing corpora

Our training and testing corpora contain three types of predicate pairs. Pairs of the first type are those
that joined by the subordination relation, and pairs of the second type are coordination pairs. Third type
pairs are those that resemble coordination, but are not linked by any conjunction. We do not consider
these cases. Table 1 shows the most important statistics.

Note that while the labels for our first task (subordination vs. coordination, cf. Section 2.2) are “read
off” the corpus instances, the relation between the predicates in each subordination pair is not correlated
with the actual order of the predicates in the text. In our representation of the data, we broke down
all subordination pairs randomly in two classes of comparable size (3833 and 3858 pairs in each class,
respectively). In one case all features for p1 correspond to the features of the main verb, and in another
class all features of p1 describe the dependent verb.

3 Features and Feature Analysis

Table 2 lists the features that we consider in our study. Most features describe predicates p1 or p2,
i.e., the head verbs of adjacent clauses. Each predicate describes an event, typically with one or more
participants. Formally, we model participants as collections of coreferent NPs (as manually annotated on
the coreference level of the corpus). The relationship between participants and predicates is captured on
the level of semantic roles as annotated on the predicate-argument (PropBank) level of the corpus (e.g.,
ARG0 is the agent, ARG1 is the patient). Participants can fill more than one role for one predicate, or
roles of more than one predicate. In these cases, we talk about sharing of participants.

Our features fall into three groups:

Salience features exploit the idea that the discourse status of events is reflected in their syntactic position
in the sentence (Matthiessen and Thompson, 1988): key events that are necessary for the understanding of
the story cannot be expressed as subordinate clauses. If this holds, it could be expected that such events
have more salient participants of the discourse as arguments, and that their discourse status is at least
partially determined by the salience of their participants. We assess the salience of participants with a
total of 20 features, using some of the features used in anaphora resolution tasks: participant frequency
and distance to the previous mention (see Chiarcos (2011) and Mitkov (1998), among others). Participant
frequency should show how salient the participant is for the overall document. The distance to the previous
mention helps to trace down smaller topics and characterize the participant’s role in the local discourse.

Adjunct features cover the expression of adjuncts of the predicates. This group is designed to test
whether presence of non-clausal modifiers of predicates influence their syntactic combination. The idea
behind including these features is two-fold: on the one hand, they might account for the size of the clauses
that should be combined. On the other hand, they might give a clue to us, what properties of events are
referred to in the context of the two clause combinations.

Shared participant features test the hypothesis that clauses are syntactically connected because they
share content, namely they describe events with identical participants. It was shown before that mentions
of same entities may be employed to detect global discourse structure (see Section 5), therefore, it might
be possible that they also act on a more local level.

computed separately for each predicate (one for the predicate p1, one for the predicate p2)

In the rest of this section, we model the feature groups individually to assess their contribution overall
and in terms of single features (cf. Section 2.2).

3.1 Salience Features

The results for predicting subordination/coordination based on salience features are given in Table 3. We
find that of all salience features, only features that estimate participant frequency and novelty are useful
for the prediction of clause combination type. In fact, predicates with equally frequent participants are
more likely to be coordinated than form a subordination construction. This feature has a far greater impact
on the model performance than any other feature.

In subordination constructions, verbs with old participants are dispreferred in subordinated positions,
while simultaneously verbs with overall more frequent participants are more likely to be dependent on
other verbs. We interpret this result, surprising at first sight, to mean that “early” mentions of frequent
participants are often found in subordinate clauses. Indeed, this situation is common for news articles,
where main participants of the news story are introduced in the first sentence. In the following example,
the NP the American Bar Association that will be subsequently mentioned in the text several times is first
introduced in the subordinate clause: The Bush administration’s nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat

Thomas only a “qualified” rating, rather than “well qualified”.

In sum, the analysis of salience features shows that the discourse status of participants correlates with
the syntactic structure of the sentences only mildly. They may be relevant mostly for the prediction of
clause combination, but not for the prediction of direction of subordination.

3.2 Adjunct Features

The model that explores the influence of expressed adjuncts is given in Tables 4. The model includes
features that describe the number of expressed non-clausal adjuncts. Verbs with temporal and, in particular,
locative modifiers tend to be coordinated. Presence of causal adjuncts, on the other hand, increases the
probablity of a subordination relation.

A possible explanation is that texts that involve descriptions of locations of different objects and events
include more coordination constructions. When the text discusses cause and effects, it is more likely
to contain subordination constructions which allow a more precise expression of the semantic relation
through subordinating conjunctions. This idea extends the hypothesis that RST relations such as Cause
are grammaticalized as subordination relations by suggesting that subordination is also likely to be used
for other phrasal adjucts of clauses with causal adjuncts.

Within the category of subordination constructions, main clauses tend to contain less adjuncts than
subordinated clauses. Clauses that are “heavy” with adjuncts generally reside lower in the syntactic tree;
this may be due to considerations similar to those involved in the “heavy NP shift” within clauses (Ross,
1967). The presence of locative adjuncts is the only feature that has a significant effect on the prediction
and that runs counter to this pattern.

3.3 Shared Participant Features

Table 5 shows an analysis of the participant features. The features f39−40 are most useful for the prediction
of dependency direction in the subordination construction. Sharing of the patient of p1 with the agent of
p2 (f39) is a very strong indicator that p1 assumes the position of main verb. On the other hand, coinciding
agents (f41) and patients (f42) suggest that the verbs are most likely coordinated. The coefficient for the
feature f34 suggests that the more participants two predicates have in common, the more likely it is that
they form a subordination construction.

However, in our experiments we found out that the feature that indicates the presence of shared
participants (f33) has the opposite impact on the prediction of clause combination type. In fact, if we
treat the f34 as a discrete variable, we obtain clearer results. Exactly one common participant increases
the chances that the predicates are coordinated, but as the number of shared participants grows, the
subordination becomes a more probable alternative (see Table 6).

Thus, there is a non-linear dependency between participant sharing features and clause combination
type. Subordination and coordination constructions have distinct patterns of participant sharing. For
coordination, it is often exactly one participant that occupies the same semantic role in the frames of
both predicates. More shared participants mean that the verbs are more likely to be subordinated. These
constructions are distinguished by the tendency to share participants between the patient of the main verb
and the agent of the dependent verb.

We have also tested models with less specific features f35−38 and noticed that in subordination
constructions, the dependent verb is generally likely to share its agent with one of other participants of the
main predicate. In the task of the prediction of clause combination type, having shared participants in
almost any role is more likely for coordination constructions, with higher coefficients for agent sharing
(f35−36).

4 Prediction of Clause Combination Type

In this Section, we build a model that incorporates all the features that we have discussed in the previous
section and use it to predict the test portion of our dataset.

This model (the Semantic/Discourse Model), is created on the basis of the most successful features
according to our previous analyses. Specifically, it includes 14 features which (a) estimate and compare
the frequency of the participants of the verbs in the pair (f3,13,14), which (b) register whether any of the
participants were mentioned previously (f15,16,20), (c) the number of expressed temporal, locative and
causal adjuncts (f23−26,29), and (d) that report on whether participants are shared between agent and
patient roles of the two predicates (f34,39−42). We build one classifier for each class and combine them as
described in Section 2.2.

We compare our Semantic/Discourse model to two other models. The first one, Majority Baseline,
assigns every pair to the most frequent class. For the first task (subordination vs. coordination), this is
subordination (75% of instances); for the second, this is subordination of p1 under p2 (52% of instances).

Our second point of comparison is the Morphological Model. This model is based on just two features,
namely the morphological forms of the two verbs. These features allow the model to solve the second
task in cases when subordinated predicate has a non-finite form. However, from our point of view, this
model is not fit for our purposes since it uses information which from a generation perspective is not yet
available at the point in time when syntactic decisions have to be made.

Table 7 lists these features in a similar manner to the semantic and discourse features used in Section 3.
Both features are modelled as factors with four levels each (the three listed ones plus the base level of
finite verb).2

The results of applying these models to our OntoNotes test set are shown in Table 8. For the first task,
the accuracy of the Majority Baseline classifier corresponds to the proportion of the majority classes in the
dataset (0.75). The Morphological Model follows the Baseline in assigning all cases to the subordination
case and thus achieves the same overall accuracy. On the second task, it improves substantially over the
baseline (accuracy 0.606) due to correct predictions in cases where subordinated clauses have non-finite
predicates. At the same time, when both predicates have finite form (which is the majority of our data)
the classifier cannot make any informed decision. However, although its intercept feature is very close to
zero, it still has a little bias towards one of the classes, which is mirrored in the accuracy of prediction on
different subsets of the data (0.921 vs. 0.316).

Our Semantics/Discourse Model is able to improve over the two other models for the subordination
2Consequently, there are three coefficients but just one drop in residual deviance resulting from the addition of the feature.

vs. coordination task by learning how to recognize at least some cases of coordination. Concerning the
direction of subordination, it improves over the baseline (0.576). While it does not achieve the overall
accuracy of the Morphological Model, it is more balanced over the two classes. Also, recall that the good
performance of the Morphological Model is due to its use of verb form information which is arguably
unavailable at the decision time.

5 Related Work

The choice between subordination and coordination is related to work on various aspects of discourse and
beyond in computational linguistics.

Rhetorical Relations. The closest area to our work consists of investigations of discourse relations in
the context of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). Most studies in this area are
primarily concerned with appropriate choice and positioning of the discourse cue, barely considering
the differences between syntactic status of clauses to be combined. However, (Taboada, 2006) shows
that some rhetorical relations are often expressed without any discourse cue, and such parameters of
sentence structure as the order of phrases and their syntactic mode of combination become significant for
the expression of rhetoric relation. There are several studies that consider syntactic means of expression
of particular rhetorical relations. In particular, Grote et al. (1997) describe how syntactic structure and
ordering of clauses correspond to the pragmatic subtypes of the Concession relation. Pitler et al. (2009)
show that pairs of words taken from sentences linked by discourse relations, as well as Levin classes of
verbs of the sentences and sentiment polarity information is useful for the prediction of implicit relations.
The same authors also look into various entity-based features and show that again lexical information
about mentioned entities correlates with the choice of discourse relation. In contrast, we focus on the
correlation between the syntactic structure and the properties of events directly, since both types of clause
combination may be used to encode the same rhetoric relation. We think that while the influence of
pragmatic factors investigated by Grote et al. (1997) may be significant, we chose to explore other types
of features in this study.

Lexical Models of Coherence Another direction of research of coherence relations within discourse is
represented by Barzilay and Lapata (2008). They show that coherent discourse is characterized by chains
of mentions of same entities. Hearst (1997) show that event chains that are formed only by the mentions
of the same lexical item mirror the global structure of texts and can be used for discourse segmentation.
The “shared participant” features that we use are similar to the approach of these studies. However, our
work shows that coordination and subordination form distinct patterns of entity mentions which can be
used to predict local text structure.

Generation and Summarization. We believe that our results may be useful to the natural language
generation and summarization communities. In generation, many systems assume overgenerate-and-rank

approach to sentence planning (for example, see Stent et al. (2004)). The description of features given
in our work may help to create better ranking systems or even direct the generation of complex and
compound sentences, in the spirit of Stent and Molina (2009). In summarization, Barzilay and McKeown
(2005) present a sentence fusion technique for multidocument summarization which needs to restructure
sentences to improve text coherence. Restructuring is currently done without regard to the underlying
discourse structure. We believe that the features that we have identified can introduce a bias towards more
appropriate structures during sentence fusion.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have reported on an examination of various semantic and discourse structure-based
factors and their effect on the choice of clause combination (subordination vs. coordination) and the
direction of relation within subordination pairs. On a dataset of clause pairs extracted from the OntoNotes
corpus, our analysis led to the following results:

• The salience of events and their participants is connected with the syntactic position of corresponding
clauses in the tree. However, in order to occupy the dominating position in the syntactic structure,
the event only has to be more prominent than another event with which it forms a pair. It does not
need to be the key, mainline event of the story.

• The presence of adjuncts of different types has an effect on the clause combination preferences.
Locative adjuncts are different from other types of adjuncts and clauses in that they seem to support
coordination more than subordination. On the other hand, the presence of causal adjuncts increases
the likelihood of subordination constructions.

• Participant sharing between different argument positions of predicate is one of the decisive factors
in the prediction of clause combination type. Coordination constructions are more likely to share
one participant between same semantic roles of the predicates, whereas the in case of subordination
participants are shared between patient and agent positions.

In sum, we find that the choice between subordination and coordination is not determined by “global”
discourse factors alone, but also by the lexical and structural properties of the participating predicates
and their immediate context. Moreover, the two prediction tasks involve different, often complimentary
features. We interpret this as evidence for a richer, more interactive account of clause structuring in
discourse context than previous work has suggested.
