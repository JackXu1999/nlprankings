Abstract

This study proposes a word prosody
converter (WPC), which takes Hindi
grapheme as input and yields output as
a sequence of phonemes with syllable
boundaries and stress mark. The WPC
has two submodules connected in the lin-
ear fashion. The first submodule is a
grapheme to phoneme (G2P) converter.
The output of G2P converter is fed to the
second submodule which is for prosody
specific job. The second submodule con-
sists of two finite state machines (FSMs).
The first FSM does the syllabification and
the second assigns prosodic labels to the
syllabified strings. The prosodic labels
are translated into the stressed and un-
stressed component using rules specific to
the language. This study proposes a novel
rule-based system which uses non-linear
phonological rules with the provision of
recursive foot structure for G2P conver-
sion and prosodic labeling. The imple-
mentation1 of the proposed rules outper-
forms the G2P models trained on the state
of the art data-driven techniques such as
joint sequence model (JSM) and LSTM.

1 Introduction

A dictionary is an essential component of a text-
to-speech (TTS) and an automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) system. These systems are of open
nature and can have an input word which is not
present in the dictionary. Such input words are
called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. There-
fore, a G2P converter is required, which can gen-
erate the pronunciation of the OOV words. A G2P
converter can be a rule-based or data driven sys-
tem. A rule-based G2P converter relies on the

G2P

expert knowledge (i.e., the rule-set designed by
an expert). However, these rule-sets may not be
exhaustive for capturing many language-specific
properties such as word morphology and stress
pattern (Pagel et al., 1998).Therefore, researchers
nowadays rely on state-of-the art machine learn-
ing (data-driven) techniques for developing a G2P
model. A data-driven system is trained using a
manually annotated dataset. The manually anno-
tated dataset contains words and its phonemic se-
quence. These datasets are language specific in
nature. The machine learning algorithm learns the
phonemic sequence for words based on the prob-
abilistic or geometric calculation. These calcu-
lation varies across machine learning approaches.
In data-driven approaches, one need not to worry
about the language specific complexities such as
word morphology and stress pattern. The algo-
rithm automatically captures these patterns in the
generated model. A data-driven G2P conversion
process is broadly categorized into three subpro-
cesses i) Sequence alignment ii) Model training
and iii) Decoding (for details see (Novak et al.,
2012)). Many data-driven techniques are available
for G2P conversion. The important ones are deci-
sion tree (Black et al., 1998), Conditional Random
Field (Wang and King, 2011), Hidden Markov
Model (Taylor, 2005), Joint-Sequence techniques
(Bisani and Ney, 2008) and Recurrent Neural Net-
work (Rao et al., 2015).

The function of a word prosody model is simi-
lar to that of a grapheme to phoneme (G2P) con-
verter. Moreover, it also describes syllable bound-
aries and predict stressed syllables in a word.
The schematic diagram of word prosody model
is shown in Fig 1. The accuracy of a word
prosody module for Hindi language depends on
an efficient solution of the two sub-problems well-
known in Hindi phonology as schwa deletion
and pronunciation of diacritic marks anusvara and
anunasika (Ohala, 1983; Pandey, 1989; Pandey,2

1990; Narasimhan et al., 2004; Pandey, 2014).
Ohala used linear phonological rules to derive sur-
face phonemic form. Pandey showed the superior-
ity of non-linear phonological rules over the linear
one. The motivation for the current work is stated
below.

a. In the past, Hindi G2P converters were imple-
mented in the context of speech synthesis (Bali et
al., 2004), (Narasimhan et al., 2004) and (Choud-
hury, 2003). However, these works have given
partial attention to the anusvara/anunasika disam-
biguation. (Pandey, 2014) describes it as the prob-
lem of Hindi orthography.

b. These G2P converters are based on lin-
ear phonological rules proposed by (Ohala, 1983)
with the exception of (Pandey, 2014). Non-linear
phonological rules have advantages over linear
one as explained below. (Bernhardt and Gilbert,
1992).

i. Non-linear rules capture both the prosodic
and segmental information.

ii. The hierarchical representation used in non-
linear framework captures more information; this
results in a compact rule set.

c. Syllable is known to be a better unit for Hindi
speech synthesis (Bellur et al., 2011; Kishore and
Black, 2003). Therefore, a Hindi text-to-speech
(TTS) system needs an automatic syllabification
module. The automatic syllabification would be
more useful if it could also predict the stressed
syllables in words of natural speech as this would
facilitate synthesis.

d. The usefulness of syllable as the basic lin-
guistic unit in the context of speech recognition
system has been explored in English (Ganapathi-
raju et al., 2001) and Tamil (Lakshmi and Murthy,
2006). Similar work for Hindi requires a software
for syllabification. This work fulfills that need.

1.1 Main Contributions
• The WPC does not require the information

of morphological boundaries. The proposed
rules take into account the syllable patterns of
compound, derived and inflected words.

• The syllabification and syllable labeling pro-
cess follow finite state machine. The faultless
syllabification and syllable labeling at under-
lying phonemic form yields better accuracy
in schwa deletion and pronunciation of di-
acritic—anusvara and anunasika. The syl-
labification at underlying phonemic form is
called as I-level syllabification in this work.

• The rules proposed in this study assume the
extrametricality of foot unlike syllable as pro-
posed in (Pandey, 2014). The contention
is that the stress can be predicted elegantly
using the notion of extrametrical foot (Mc-
Carthy and Prince, 1990; Crowhurst, 1994) .
Also, the directionality is LR (left to right)
unlike RL (right to left) used in (Pandey,
2014).

• Anusvara and anunasika are used inter-
changeably in Hindi. Therefore, both anus-
vara and anunasika is mapped to a hypothet-
ical phoneme X at the underlying phonemic
form. The decision for homo-organic nasal
consonant or a nasalized vowel for phoneme
X is based on the minimum moraic weight
difference of the syllable having phoneme X
and the next syllable. The moraic weight
difference is calculated after schwa deletion
and re-syllabification. The proposed map-
ping rule almost removes the pronunciation
ambiguity related to anusvara and anunasika.

Rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the salient points of metrical
phonology relevant to this work. Section 3 de-
scribes the process of syllabification and sylla-
ble labeling. Section 4 describes foot forma-
tion. Section 5 describes schwa deletion and re-
syllabification. Section 6 describes the observa-3



tions and rules for the anusvara and anunasika pro-
nunciation. Section 7 describes the data-driven
G2P systems implemented for Hindi. Section 8
compares the performance of current system to
data-driven systems and previous rule-based im-
plementations. Section 9 describes the rules for
the prediction of the stressed syllables and reports
the accuracy of current system for syllabification
and stress prediction. The conclusion and limita-
tions are written in Section 10.

2 Theoretical Background

Metrical phonology is based on nonlinear arrange-
ment of the constituents of a phrase (Liberman and
Prince, 1977; Selkirk, 1980; Hayes, 1980; Selkirk,
1986; Hayes, 1995; Apoussidou, 2006). The non-
linear arrangement is realized in the form of a tree
with nodes as the constituents of a phrase. The
constituents are syllable, foot, phonological word,
phonological phrase and intonational phrase. Syl-
lable is the lowest unit in the hierarchy dominated
by foot, which in turn is dominated by a phono-
logical word. The higher units such as phonolog-
ical phrase and intonational phrase are not rele-
vant in the current work ( for clarity see fig 4 -
9). Syllable functions as a domain for segmen-
tal phonological rules. In non-linear phonology,
the rules are written on the basis of interaction
among syllables under the domain of higher con-
stituents. A syllable has obligatory rhyme and op-
tional coda. The syllables are also described by
the moraic weight in quantity-sensitive languages
such as Hindi (Pandey, 1989). Foot as a domain
is used for describing stress and re-syllabification
due to deletion of segment like schwa in languages
such as French and Hindi. The foot is used as
a musical meter and the concept is borrowed to
non-linear phonology as a constituent (Selkirk,
1980; Hayes, 1995). Most of the quantity sensi-
tive languages have binary foot, but some also al-
low degenerate foot. A binary foot is erected on
either two syllables or on a single syllable hav-
ing at least two moras. A single syllable hav-
ing one mora, if projected as a foot, is called de-
generate foot (Liberman and Prince, 1977; Hayes,
1995).Phonological word, also known as prosodic
word, is a constituent unit of prosodic hierarchy
above syllables or foot and below phonological
phrases. Prosodic word is non-isomorphic to the
grammatical word and the boundary of the former
aligns with the morpho-syntactic boundary (Hall

and Kleinhenz, 1999).

3 I-Level Syllabification

I-level syllabification is derived from the under-
lying phonemic form (UPF), which in turn is de-
rived from orthography using the following map-
ping rules.

i. Each consonant in Devanagari script is inher-
ently associated with the mid-central vowel called
schwa or its lower counterpart ”a”2.

ii. If a consonant is followed by a vowel dia-
critic mark, or a diacritic called halant, the inher-
ent schwa is deleted.

iii. The inherent schwa is not realized in case of
consonant at word final position.

iv. Two or three consonant together can form a
ligature.

v. A short vowel at word final position is length-
ened.

The following examples illustrate derivation of
UPF from orthography:

/kml/→ k@m@l (Lotus)
/kmAl/→ k@ma:l
The process of syllabification in Hindi was

explored by (Ohala, 1983) and (Pandey, 1989;
Pandey, 2014). Their analysis do not talk about
the maximal onset principle for syllabification.
The present analysis for syllabification follows
maximum onset principle (Selkirk, 1984; Selkirk,
1981). The maximum onset principle is a suffi-
ciency condition as demonstrated by the following
examples.

i. m� (y\�jy (A name)→ [mri] [tjun] [dZ@j]
→ *[mrit][jun][dZ@j]
→ *[mritj][un][dZ@j]
→ *[mrit][jundZ][@j]

ii. kb� tr (Pigeon)→ [k@] [bu] [t@r]
→ *[k@b] [ut] [@r]
→ *[k@] [but] [@r]

In the above examples, the right hand side
shows the potential syllable structures for a word.
The square bracket denotes the syllable boundary.
An asterisk before the syllable structure indicates
that this potential syllable sequence is incorrect.
The above examples show that either onsets are
maximized or is equal to number of coda conso-
nants for correct syllabification. It implies that the
maximum onset principle hold for syllabification

2Hindi graphemes and its corresponding phoneme using
international phonetic alphabet (IPA) and Roman symbols are
described in Table 10.4



in Hindi. Based on many such examples, follow-
ing regular expressions are proposed for syllabifi-
cation in Hindi.

i. v→ [v]
ii. vv→ [v][v]
iii. c*vcv→ [c* v] [cv]
iv. c*vc1cv→ [c*vc1] [cv]
v. c*vc1c2v→ [c*v] [c1c2v]
vi. c*vc1c1v→ [c*vc1] [c1v]
vii. c*vc2c2v→ [c*vc2] [c2v]
viii. c*vcccv→ [c*vc] [ccv]
In the above expressions, v denotes a vowel,

”c1” denotes a stop consonant, ”c2” represents a
semivowel (r, l, v, j) and ”c” at intervocalic po-
sition denotes a consonant that is neither a stop
nor a semivowel but can be any consonant at
non-intervocalic position. An asterisk denotes the
kleene star.

The finite state machine for the I-level syllabifi-
cation is shown in Figure 2. It contains seventeen
states with the start state as I and the final state
as F. The orthography of an input word is translit-
erated into a sequence of consonants and vowels.
The 8 syllabification rules are applied to this se-
quence to derive a symbol sequence in terms of c,
c1, c2 and v. The symbol sequence is the input
to the FSM in Figure 1. An arc between a pair of
states in FSM is associated with a label ( a pair
of symbols seperated by ”/”). Suppose the symbol
pair associated with an arc is ”x/y”. This indicates
that whenever a symbol ”x” is fed to the state at the
beginning of the arc, the system makes a transition
along the arc and outputs the symbol ”y”. The la-
bel e/e symbolizes null input and null output for a
transition. If part of a symbol string reaches to the
final state F, then it is consumed, and a transition
from F to I with arc label e/b takes place, where e
is null and b denotes the syllable boundary of the
consumed string. The remaining part of the string
repeats the same process from initial state I until
everything is consumed.

3.1 Syllable Labeling

Hindi is a quantity sensitive language. There-
fore, syllables in Hindi are also described based
on an attribute called syllable weight or moraic
weight (Hayes, 1980; Pandey, 1989). A phonetic,
phonological and typological description of sylla-
ble weight can be found in (Gordon, 2007). The
following rules are used for label syllables based
on syllable weights (for examples, see Table 1).

Figure 2: Finite State Machine for Syllabification

i. Each short vowel (like @,u,i ) and each coda
consonant of a syllable are assigned a weight of
one mora, while a long vowel (like a:,u:,i:) is as-
signed a weight of two moras.

ii. The syllables with one, two and three moras
are called weak (w), heavy (h) and superheavy
(sh) syllables respectively (Pandey, 1989; Hayes,
1989; Pandey, 1990).

Sylable Weight Syllable Label Gloss
1 [ki]w that
2 [m@n]h soul
3 [ga:l]sh cheek

Table 1: Syllable labels according to syllable
Weight

A finite state machine for syllable labeling is
shown in Figure 3. The machine consists of one
initial state (state I), seven non-final states and
three final states (F1, F2 and F3). The syllabi-
fied string (i.e, the syllable boundary marked as
b) is given as input to the initial state. Since, each
short vowel gets one mora and long vowels get two
moras, therefore, vowel type distinction is essen-
tial at syllable labeling stage. Each coda conso-
nants get one mora and the onset consonants do
not contribute to the moraic weight of syllables in
Hindi. Therefore, consonant type distinction is not
required at this stage. The symbol c, v s and v l
stand for consonants, short vowels and long vow-
els respectively. The output symbol along an arc
is either a syllable label or the reflection of the in-
put itself. There is a null transition from each fi-5



nal state to the initial state so that the process can
be repeated for the remaining part of the string.
The FSM assigns the label ”w” to a syllable with
phoneme sequences v s, cv s, ccv s, ccc*v s and
”h” to v sc , c*v sc, c*v l, and ”sh” to c*v scc,
c*v lc.

4 Foot Formation

The concept of foot or feet is brought to linguistic
from poetry. The notion of foot work as a metric
to define stress pattern in a language (Jakobson,
1960). Moreover, foot also plays an important role
in resyllabification due to deletion of a segment
(Selkirk, 1996). In this section, a new approach
of foot formation is described for Hindi. The ap-
proach is based on three assumptions and six rules.
The rules apply in the direction from left to right.

4.1 Assumptions
i. Foot is formed using the labeled syllables of a
word. The process of syllable labeling is described
in the section 3.

ii. Foot is either binary branching or projected
on at least a bimoraic syllable.

iii. A superfoot is formed either between a syl-
lable and a foot, or between two foot.

4.2 Rules
The six rules for foot formation are listed below.

i. Weak to Weak Affinity Rule (WWAR): Two
adjacent weak syllables form a binary foot and re-
sults into a bimoraic foot as shown in the Figure 4.

The foot <
∑

s>is the extra metrical foot, which
never bears any stress.

Figure 4: Bimoraic binary foot

ii. Heavy to Weak Affinity Rule (HWAR):
A heavy and a weak adjacent syllables form tri-
moraic binary foot as shown in the Figure 5.

Figure 5: Trimoraic foot

iii. Weak to Heavy Affinity Rule (WHAR): This
kind of foot is either formed in bisyllabic Hindi
words or in loan words as shown in the Figure 6.

Figure 6: Trimoraic foot

iv. Heavy to Heavy Affinity Rule (HHAR): Two
adjacent heavy syllables also form a binary foot as
shown in the Figure 7.

v. Superheavy to Others Affinity Rule (SOAR):
The superheavy syllables always projected as a
foot as shown in Figure 7. The superfoot (

∑
s) is

formed using one syllable and one foot. The pro-
jected foot constituent in

∑
s could be either a new

syllable after schwa deletion as shown in Figure 4
or a syllable which inherently bear stress i.e., the
superheavy syllable as shown in Figure 8.

vi. List Affinity Rule (LAR): LAR is devised
for handling words having same syllable structure
at underlying phonemic form but realized differ-
ently at surface level. Such overlapping cases are
stored in different list (usually different spread-
sheets) and different foot formation rules are ap-
plied to these lists. The foot formation rules shown
in Figure 9 describe four cases with overlapping
syllable structure. These four cases represent four
different list of words. These rules are called6



Figure 7: Heavy syllables forming a foot

Figure 8: Superheavy syllables forming foot

as affinity hierarchy rules. The word affinity de-
scribes the interaction between different or similar
type of syllables. The word ’hierarchy’ is used be-
cause these rules apply in the order of their height.
The top rule in the hierarchy applies first and so
on. The decreasing order of height of these rules
are LAR>WWAR >HWAR >WHAR >HHAR
>SOAR.

5 Schwa Deletion and Resyllabification

Schwa deletion is an optional phenomena in
Hindi. This means that schwa can be deleted or
retained in the same environment, and the choice
solely depends on the speaker and the context be-
ing used. Schwa deletion phenomena in Hindi
helps speakers to utter a word quickly, i.e., the pro-
cess of schwa deletion reduces the overall effort in
terms of duration. It enables stress shift from one
syllable to other. The following rules describe the
contexts in which schwa gets deleted.

i. @→ Φ/[σw − σw]∑

ii. @→ Φ/[σh − σw]∑

iii. @→ Φ/[σsh − σw]∑
In other words, if the right most node of a foot

is a weak syllable having schwa then schwa can
be deleted.Application of the above schwa dele-
tion (SD) rules and consequent re-syllabification
of exemplar words are shown in Table 3. The pro-
cess of schwa deletion and re-syllabification occur
at foot level. In the process of re-syllabification,
the bare consonant(s) after schwa deletion are as-
signed as coda consonant(s) to the preceding syl-
lable. The foot structure for the examples in Table
2 can be found in the Section 4.

structure but different foot formation

6 Anusvara and Anunasika
Pronunciation

Over the past, researchers have ignored the ambi-
guities in the pronunciation of anusvara/anunasika
for G2P conversion. A simple finite state trans-
ducer for anusvara and anunasika is proposed by
(Choudhury, 2003). (Pandey, 2014) says that the
pronunciation ambiguities in anusvara/anunasika
can be solved by preparing an exhaustive list of
irregular cases. He further advocates the need for
revision in the orthography to get rid of these ir-
regular cases. However, not only in superscripted
vowel diacritics as described in (Pandey, 2014),
but in general, the present day Devanagari uses
bindu and chandrabindu interchangeably. Some
such examples are shown below in Table 3. The
process of mapping anusvara and anunasika to ap-
propriate phoneme is based on the observations
and rules described below. The proposed ap-
proach maps both bindu and chandrabindu to the
same phoneme X at the underlying phonological
level. A single phoneme X for both anusvara
and anunasika at underlying phonological level
correctly captures the phonological structure of a
word. The use of single phoneme X transforms
the co-domain of the function G2P:A→ B and it
becomes a one-to-one function from many-to-one7



function as shown in Fig. 10 and Fig.11 . The
disambiguation rules apply on the phoneme X.
Hence, these rules perform better for the words
with identical use of bindu and chandrabindu.
Moreover,The proposed approach uses both supra-
segmental and segmental phonological constraints
for anusvara/anunasika disambiguation.

tical use of anusvara and anunasika

Figure 11: The use of phoneme X transform the
codomain of G2P function. It becomes one-to-one
function.

6.1 Observations

• Nasalization of vowel (NV) does not change
the moraic weight of a syllable while
the homo-organic nasal (HN) increases the
moraic weight of a syllable by one unit.

• A syllable having phoneme for either anus-
vara or anunasika always tries to keep mini-
mum moraic weigth difference with its suc-
ceeding syllable.

6.2 Rules

• Initially both anusvara and anunasika is
mapped to phoneme, say, X. The moraic
weight of X is assumed as one unit.

• The decision of using NV or HN is based on
the comparison of moraic weight between the
syllable to be mapped for NV/HN and the
syllable succeeding to it.

– If the moraic weight of the syllable con-
taining phoneme X is greater than that of
the next syllable, then replace the vowel
and phoneme X by the corresponding
NV.

– If the moraic weight of the syllable con-
taining phoneme X is less than or equal
to that of the next syllable, then replace

the phoneme X by the HN correspond-
ing to the following phoneme.

• If the word final syllable contains the
phoneme X at the last coda position then
nasalize the vowel preceding X and delete X.

• If the word final syllable contains the
phoneme X at non-final position and fol-
lowed by a tS, tSh, dZ and dZh then nasalize
the vowel preceding X and delete X. Other-
wise replace X by HN corresponding to the
following phoneme.

Table 4 and 5 show examples of application of
the above written rules for phonemic realization of
anusvara and anunasika. In Table 4, the acronym
Syllab denotes the syllable division and Mw de-
notes the moraic weight of syllables in the ordered
pair.

7 Data Driven G2P Systems for Hindi

Two data-driven G2P models are trained on an
expert annotated training lexicon of size 26454
words. These words are extracted from BBC
Hindi. The first model is a joint sequence
(JS) based G2P model trained using the sequitur
(Bisani and Ney, 2008) toolkit. The second G2P
model is a bidirectional deep LSTM model. The
model configuration is same as reported in (Rao
et al., 2015). Three forward and three backward
hidden layers with 256 nodes at each layer is used.
The output layer is a connectionist temporal clas-
sification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006) layer and the
error function is softmax.

8 Results

The publicly accessible Hindi wordnet (Bhat-
tacharyya, 2010) is used for the testing pur-
pose. The wordnet is first cleaned i.e., digits, hy-
phen and other special characters are removed.
Long words especially compounds, derived and
inflected words are picked up from different lex-
ical categories like Noun, Verb, Adjective and
Adverbs. The first list contains 3500 words for
which schwa deletion rule applies at least once. A
second list 700 words having diacritic for anus-
vara or anunasika. This implies that two test
sets are used containing 3500 and 700 words.
These sets are annotated by expert at three lev-
els i) phonemic sequence, ii) syllable boundaries,
and iii) stress mark. The G2P output for the8

in Table 9.The performance of these systems is re-
ported below in Table 7. The present work has one
limitation though.

It cannot predict the stress pattern for the
words having different part of speech cat-
egories as described in (Pandey, 2014) and

and iv) for phonemic realization of anusvara and

(Dyrud, 2001). However, the number of such
words in Hindi is small and can be listed. The
future work will include a mechanism to pre-
dict stress for these words based on their part-
of-speech category.

9 Prediction of Stressed Syllables

The process of resyllabification discussed in sec-
tion 5 can upgrade syllables from weak to heavy or
heavy to superheavy. Therefore, the after resyllab-
ification the syllabified strings are fed to the FSM
for syllable labeling. The labels assigned by FSM
after resyllabification is called prosodic label. Ta-
ble 6 shows examples of applications of syllable
stress rule. Here a stressed syllable is preceded
by a stress mark ("). The following rules translate
the prosodic labels into stressed/unstressed com-
ponent.9

word error rate due to schwa deletion and anus-
vara/anunasika pronunciation respectively.

i. Superheavy syllables are always stressed.
ii. Heavy syllables at the ultimate position are

unstressed and stressed otherwise.
iii. Weak syllables at the penultimate position in

bisyllabic words are stressed and unstressed other-
wise.

The output of current system is evaluated for
syllabification and stress prediction for the test set
described in Section 8. The report is summarized
in Table 8.

10 Conclusion

In this paper, a new approach for deriving Hindi
word prosody is described. The WPC uses a novel

Table 9: Examples words where the others failed
and current system succeeded

rule-based G2P converter which outperforms the
state of the art data-driven G2P systems and the
previous rule-based system for Hindi. The pro-
posed G2P system uses non-linear phonological
rules with the provision of recursive foot. The
proposed system has one limitation though. The
system cannot predict the correct stress pattern of
a word having two part-of-speech category as de-
scribed in (Pandey, 2014). The proposed work can
be further utilized in prosodic analysis by extract-
ing stressed/unstressed syllables at textual level.
The acoustic analysis can be performed by train-
ing the speech data and corresponding text using
hidden markov model (HMM) or deep neural net-
works (DNN).
