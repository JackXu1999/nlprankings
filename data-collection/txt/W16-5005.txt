Abstract

Negation and modality are two important grammatical phenomena that have attracted recent
research attention as they can contribute to extra-propositional meaning aspects, among with fac-
tuality, attribution, irony and sarcasm. These aspects go beyond analysis such as semantic role
labeling, and modeling them is important as a step towards a higher level of language understand-
ing, which is needed for practical applications such as sentiment analysis. In this talk, I will go
beyond English, and I will discuss how negation and modality are expressed in other languages.
I will also go beyond sentiment analysis and I will present some challenges that the two phenom-
ena pose for machine translation (MT). In particular, I will demonstrate how contemporary MT
systems fail on them, and I will discuss some possible solutions.
