Did you ever read about Frogs drinking Coffee?
Investigating the Compositionality of Multi-Emoji Expressions

Rebeca Padilla López and Fabienne Cap

Abstract

In this work, we present a first at-
tempt to investigate multi-emoji expres-
sions and whether they behave similarly
to multiword expressions in terms of non-
compositionality. We focus on the com-
bination of the frog and the hot bever-
age emoji, but also show some preliminary
results for other non-compositional emoji
combinations. We use off-the-shelf senti-
ment analysers as well as manual classi-
fications to approach the compositionality
of these emoji combinations.

1 Introduction

Emojis do not only represent faces, but also con-
cepts and ideas such as weather, objects, or activ-
ities (Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2016). We as-
sume that these “concept” emojis are not always
used as literal representations, but that there are
many instances of their use as indicators of a cer-
tain emotion or intention. In this paper, we fo-
cus on two such “concept” emojis: the frog face
emoji and the hot beverage emoji. We want to
analyse the sentiment value of these emojis when
used together and when used separately. By look-
ing up tweets that contain the emojis and clas-
sifying them as positive, neutral or negative, we
show that the meaning of the combination of these
emojis is non-compositional, and could not be in-
ferred from the meaning of its components. This
is in-line with the behaviour of multi-word expres-
sions and motivates for further study of the phe-

and lipstick.

nomenon. The choice of emojis is based on what
has been observed in social media sites such as
Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. The users of these
sites seem to use these emojis with a definite emo-
tion and intention in mind. This is likely to have its
origin in a popular internet meme known as “But
That’s None of My Business”.

According to Know Your Meme1, this meme
represents “a sarcastic expression used as a
postscript to an insult or disrespectful remark said
towards a specific individual or group”. Thus, this
is the kind of sentiment we expect to find in tweets
that include both the frog face and the hot bever-
age emoji. When analysing tweets that only in-
clude the frog face emoji, we expect the sentiment
to be neutral. For the hot beverage emoji, we as-
sume a neutral sentiment too. When it comes to
the frequency distribution of words, the separate
meanings of the hot beverage emoji and the frog
face emoji are expected to be quite literal. It is ex-
pected to find that words related to frogs and bev-
erages are very common in these tweets, but not in
tweets where both emojis appear.

2 Background

In recent years, sentiment analysis has found an
invaluable source of material and information in
social media. Because of their prevalence in social
media, emoticons became the focus of many sen-
timent analysis studies. Kouloumpis et al. (2011)
found that, in the microblogging domain, emoti-
cons were more useful than part-of-speech fea-
tures for training data collection. Research shows
that emoticons do not only represent affective
stances, but also intention or identity and can be
used to strengthen a message (Derks et al., 2008).
Because of their similarities, it is likely that this is

true also of emojis.
Nowadays, emojis have started substituting

emoticons for conveying emotions (Pavalanathan
and Eisenstein, 2016) and they are becoming an
important part of internet language. Chin et al.
(2016) have used emojis to expand on positive or
negative sentiment and classified tweets into five
emotions. This shows that emojis can help us be
more precise in our sentiment analysis. Moreover,
Kelly and Watts (2015) investigate the “appropri-
ation” of emojis. In other words, appropriation is
the usage in a way that was not intended or en-
visaged by the designer (Dix, 2007). Even though
there has not been much previous work on emojis,
they have certain interesting characteristics that
make them worthy of being investigated and they
could become a useful feature when analysing the
sentiment of social media text in the future.

3 Methodology

3.1 Collecting tweets
In order to collect tweets, we went through
iEmoji’s archive of tweets2 and manually retrieved
1,000 tweets that contained the hot beverage emoji
and not the frog face emoji, 1,000 that had the frog
face but not the hot beverage and 1,000 that had
both. All tweets were published between 2013
and 2016 and were chosen randomly from random
pages from the archive. They were pre-processed
before the analysis: all hash characters, usernames
and emojis were deleted.

3.2 Sentiment analysis and frequency
distribution

The three tweet sets were analysed using two dif-
ferent analysers: i) TEXTBLOB (Smedt and Daele-
mans, 2012) and ii) VADER (Hutto and Gilbert,
2014).

TEXTBLOB is based on a pattern library and re-
turns a tweet’s polarity and subjectivity. For the
present work, we focused on polarity, which goes
from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), 0 being neutral.
VADER was trained to be used on social media and
microblogging texts. It returns a dictionary such
as: “’’pos’: 0.446, ’neg’: 0.0, ’neu’: 0.554, ’com-
pound’: 0.6166”. We used the “compound” value,
since it represents the overall sentiment value of
the tweet and uses the same scale as TEXTBLOB.

To evaluate their performance, we manually
classified the 100 first tweets from each set and

2http://www.iemoji.com/

compared this manual annotation to the results the
analysers gave for them. Then, we calculated their
precision and recall for positive, negative and neu-
tral tweets. Finally, we had a look at the frequency
distribution of the words in the tweets, focusing on
the 15 most common words.

4 Results

We evaluated our hypothesis using three differ-
ent approaches: off-the-shelf sentiment analysers
(4.1), manual classification (4.2) and finally we re-
port on the most frequent words occurring in the
context of the investigated emojis and their com-
bination (4.3).

Both FrogFace Hot Beverage
TEXTBLOB 0,048 0,11 0,17
VADER 0,011 0,16 0,18

Table 1: Polarity results for each tweet set. Polarity ranges
from 1 (positive) over 0 (neutral) to -1 (negative).

After automatically analysing each of the 3000
tweets and obtaining its polarity score, the aver-
age score for every 1000 tweet sets was calcu-
lated. The results are shown in Table 1. The sen-
timent analysis shows a small but clear difference
between the sentiment that each emoji has sepa-
rately and the sentiment they have when used to-
gether. TEXTBLOB and VADER give very simi-
lar scores to the frog face tweets (0,11 and 0,16)
and to the hot beverage tweets (0,17 and 0,18),
and these two sets are at the same time quite sim-
ilar to each other in their scores. Since they seem
to have a similar sentiment, if their meaning were
still literal when combined, we would expect the
combination to have the same score, but from our
results we can see that the score for the combi-
nation is lower. Even though we first assumed a
more negative sentiment for the combination, the
results make sense: tweets with both emojis are
supposed to have a subtle, sarcastic tone, which is
not easily recognised by sentiment analysers yet.
Nevertheless, the distinction is there, and we will
have a closer look at it in an additional evaluation
using manual classification.

4.2 Manual Classification
We manually classified 100 tweets for each tweet
set as negative, positive or neutral. An overview is
given in Table 3. The frog face set and the hot

beverage set have a similar distribution and are
in general fairly positive, but the combination of
both is clearly negative, which supports the hy-
pothesis in question. The meaning in this case
is non-compositional and non-literal. While clas-
sifying the tweets, it was obvious that they had
the same sarcastic, disrespectful tone as the “But
That’s None of My Business” meme, and some
even used the same words. For example, one Twit-
ter user wrote “I can solve all your problems, yet
you do stupid shit. But that’s none of my business.”

We also used this manual classification to eval-
uate the performance of both classifiers. The re-
sults are given in Table 2. Precision and recall are
lower for both analysers when it comes to the com-
bination of emojis. This is not surprising, since
they were expected to be more difficult to analyse
due to the sarcasm and the subtlety of their senti-
ment. The analysers performed best when classi-
fying positive tweets. VADER performed sightly
better for the frog face tweets, and TEXTBLOB
performed better for the hot beverage tweets. We
attribute the overall low performance to the fact
that there was a lot of sarcasm in the tweets, and
for this to be understood one needs some real-
world knowledge which is almost impossible for
a classifier to make use of.

at the 15 most common words in each set of 1000
tweets. If a word is repeated in the same tweet, it is

counted as many times as it appears. In Table 4 we
see the hot beverage set’s most common word is
“coffee”, and the second one is “tea”. Most of the
words are semantically related and show a literal
use of the emoji. For the frog face tweets, the most
common word is “frog”, and the plural “frogs” is
on 6th place, which also points to a literal use. In
the combined set the most common word is “but”.
Even though it is a function word and would usu-
ally be ignored, in this case it is not, because it is
the first word in the meme (“But That’s None of
My Business”) and it can indicate an objection. In
this last case, the words do not tell us much about
the sentiment or meaning of the emoji combina-
tion. This suggests that the emojis have a non-
literal meaning. The results also show emojis are
often used in addition to the concept they repre-
sent, without substituting it. This could be an in-
teresting direction for future work.

5 Other emoji combinations

5.1 Frog face plus other beverages

While retrieving tweets we noticed a few tweets
that expressed the same sentiment as the frog face
and hot beverage tweets, but had a different bever-
age emoji, e.g. the tropical drink, cocktail glass
or teacup without handle emojis. We found 18
such tweets. For example, a user wrote “Got a
pic of u that could expose u so keep saying stuff” 4

and added a frog face and a teacup without handle.
This sample is too small to confirm that the senti-
ment and meaning of these combinations will re-
main the same regardless of the drink emoji. How-
ever, nothing similar was observed when retriev-
ing tweets containing the hot beverage. The frog
face was never substituted by another face. This
might indicate that the frog face is the main ele-
ment of the combination and the one which brings
the sarcastic, negative tone to the expression.

5.2 Clapping Hands Sign emoji

For the clapping hands sign emoji, we expect
a change of meaning whenever it is repeated or
placed in certain parts of the sentence. On its own,
it is mostly used to show excitement or apprecia-
tion. However, when placed between each word
in a sentence (sometimes two or three words), the
connotation turns negative. In this case, the user is
aggressively sharing their opinion, telling off the
readers or correcting them.

In order to investigate this hypothesis, we used
iEmoji to retrieve 50 tweets in which the emoji
appeared several times between the words and 50
tweets where the emoji appeared differently. We
found a significant change in meaning and senti-
ment in all of them. For example, one user wrote
“@Michael Sanchez I didn’t expect this to hap-
pen. So happy rn. Good luck sir” 5, with a clap-
ping hands sign at its end. On the other hand,
another user wrote “PLANNED PARENTHOOD
DOESN’T JUST DO ABORTIONS” 6. After ev-
ery word, there was a clapping hands sign emoji,
emphasising the message and seemingly trying to
correct a false idea. We investigated only a small
sample, but this use of the emojis was consistent

throughout all tweets, which indicates there is a
pattern worth studying.

5.3 Nail Polish emoji
The nail polish emoji shares the sarcastic subtext
of the emoji combination we extensively studied
in this paper, but its meaning changes and be-
comes literal when used in combination with the
lipstick emoji. In this case, the lipstick emoji re-
tains its literal meaning and turns the nail polish
emoji into a literal representation of nail polish.
We retrieved 50 tweets with the nail polish emoji
appearing next to the lipstick emoji, and 50 tweets
with only the nail polish emoji. In 47 out of the
50 tweets, the difference was clear. For example,
one user tweeted “@TAMU sorry my tampons and
wallet are so threatening,” 7 adding a nail polish
at the end. This tweet is clearly sarcastic and has
nothing to do with makeup. A counter example is
this tweet: “I need a makeup advent calendar in
my life” 8 with a nail polish next to a lipstick and a
clearly literal meaning. This is a small sample, but
the pattern is found in most of the tweets, which
suggests it is not accidental.

6 Conclusion

We showed that there is a distinct change between
the literal meaning the frog face and the hot bev-
erage emojis have when used separately and the
more subtle, non-literal meaning their combina-
tion has. This is shown in the frequency distri-
bution of the words and in the sentiment analysis
of the tweets. Both sentiment analysers showed a
small yet observable difference in sentiment, and
while this was not enough to reach any conclu-
sions, the difference became clearer after the man-
ual classification of the tweets.

This kind of multi-emoji expression is not
unique, since there are similar cases that have also
been examined, but it is uncommon and each case
has its own characteristics. Even though the case
that has been studied here is not a widespread phe-
nomenon, emojis are a very recent addition to our
communication methods. In the future we expect
to see more transformations in the way emoji are
used, which would be worth being researched in
depth.
