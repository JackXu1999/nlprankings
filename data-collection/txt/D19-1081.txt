Abstract

Modern sentence-level NMT systems often
produce plausible translations of isolated sen-
tences. However, when put in context, these
translations may end up being inconsistent
with each other. We propose a monolingual
DocRepair model to correct inconsistencies
between sentence-level translations. DocRe-
pair performs automatic post-editing on a se-
quence of sentence-level translations, refining
translations of sentences in context of each
other. For training, the DocRepair model re-
quires only monolingual document-level data
in the target language. It is trained as a
monolingual sequence-to-sequence model that
maps inconsistent groups of sentences into
consistent ones. The consistent groups come
from the original training data; the inconsis-
tent groups are obtained by sampling round-
trip translations for each isolated sentence.
We show that this approach successfully imi-
tates inconsistencies we aim to fix: using con-
trastive evaluation, we show large improve-
ments in the translation of several contex-
tual phenomena in an English→Russian trans-
lation task, as well as improvements in the
BLEU score. We also conduct a human eval-
uation and show a strong preference of the
annotators to corrected translations over the
baseline ones. Moreover, we analyze which
discourse phenomena are hard to capture us-
ing monolingual data only.1

1 Introduction

Machine translation has made remarkable
progress, and studies claiming it to reach a human
parity are starting to appear (Hassan et al., 2018).
However, when evaluating translations of the
whole documents rather than isolated sentences,
human raters show a stronger preference for

human over machine translation (Läubli et al.,
2018). These findings emphasize the need to shift
towards context-aware machine translation both
from modeling and evaluation perspective.

Most previous work on context-aware NMT as-
sumed that either all the bilingual data is avail-
able at the document level (Jean et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2017; Tiedemann and Scherrer, 2017; Baw-
den et al., 2018; Voita et al., 2018; Maruf and
Haffari, 2018; Agrawal et al., 2018; Kuang et al.,
2018; Miculicich et al., 2018) or at least its frac-
tion (Voita et al., 2019). But in practical scenarios,
document-level parallel data is often scarce, which
is one of the challenges when building a context-
aware system.

We introduce an approach to context-aware
machine translation using only monolingual
document-level data. In our setting, a sep-
arate monolingual sequence-to-sequence model
(DocRepair) is used to correct sentence-level
translations of adjacent sentences. The key idea is
to use monolingual data to imitate typical incon-
sistencies between context-agnostic translations
of isolated sentences. The DocRepair model is
trained to map inconsistent groups of sentences
into consistent ones. The consistent groups come
from the original training data; the inconsistent
groups are obtained by sampling round-trip trans-
lations for each isolated sentence.

To validate the performance of our model, we
use three kinds of evaluation: the BLEU score,
contrastive evaluation of translation of several dis-
course phenomena (Voita et al., 2019), and human
evaluation. We show strong improvements for all
metrics.

We analyze which discourse phenomena are
hard to capture using monolingual data only. Us-
ing contrastive test sets for targeted evaluation of
several contextual phenomena, we compare the
performance of the models trained on round-trip

translations and genuine document-level parallel
data. Among the four phenomena in the test sets
we use (deixis, lexical cohesion, VP ellipsis and
ellipsis which affects NP inflection) we find VP
ellipsis to be the hardest phenomenon to be cap-
tured using round-trip translations.

Our key contributions are as follows:

• we introduce the first approach to context-
aware machine translation using only mono-
lingual document-level data;

• our approach shows substantial improve-
ments in translation quality as measured by
BLEU, targeted contrastive evaluation of sev-
eral discourse phenomena and human evalu-
ation;

• we show which discourse phenomena are
hard to capture using monolingual data only.

2 Our Approach: Document-level Repair

We propose a monolingual DocRepair model
to correct inconsistencies between sentence-level
translations of a context-agnostic MT system. It
does not use any states of a trained MT model
whose outputs it corrects and therefore can in prin-
ciple be trained to correct translations from any
black-box MT system.

The DocRepair model requires only monolin-
gual document-level data in the target language. It
is a monolingual sequence-to-sequence model that
maps inconsistent groups of sentences into consis-
tent ones. Consistent groups come from mono-
lingual document-level data. To obtain inconsis-
tent groups, each sentence in a group is replaced
with its round-trip translation produced in isola-
tion from context. More formally, forming a train-
ing minibatch for the DocRepair model involves
the following steps (see also Figure 1):

1. sample several groups of sentences from the
monolingual data;

2. for each sentence in a group, (i) translate it
using a target-to-source MT model, (ii) sam-
ple a translation of this back-translated sen-
tence in the source language using a source-
to-target MT model;

3. using these round-trip translations of isolated
sentences, form an inconsistent version of the
initial groups;

Figure 1: Training procedure of DocRepair. First,
round-trip translations of individual sentences are pro-
duced to form an inconsistent text fragment (in the ex-
ample, both genders of the speaker and the cat became
inconsistent). Then, a repair model is trained to pro-
duce an original text from the inconsistent one.

Figure 2: The process of producing document-level
translations at test time is two-step: (1) sentences are
translated independently using a sentence-level model,
(2) DocRepair model corrects translation of the result-
ing text fragment.

4. use inconsistent groups as input for the
DocRepair model, consistent ones as output.

At test time, the process of getting document-
level translations is two-step (Figure 2):

1. produce translations of isolated sentences us-
ing a context-agnostic MT model;

2. apply the DocRepair model to a sequence
of context-agnostic translations to correct in-
consistencies between translations.

In the scope of the current work, the DocRe-
pair model is the standard sequence-to-sequence
Transformer. Sentences in a group are concate-
nated using a reserved token-separator between
sentences.2 The Transformer is trained to correct
these long inconsistent pseudo-sentences into con-
sistent ones. The token-separator is then removed
from corrected translations.

3 Evaluation of Contextual Phenomena

We use contrastive test sets for evaluation of dis-
course phenomena for English-Russian by Voita
et al. (2019). These test sets allow for testing dif-
ferent kinds of phenomena which, as we show, can

tor.

be captured from monolingual data with varying
success. In this section, we provide test sets statis-
tics and briefly describe the tested phenomena. For
more details, the reader is referred to Voita et al.
(2019).

3.1 Test sets

There are four test sets in the suite. Each test
set contains contrastive examples. It is specifi-
cally designed to test the ability of a system to
adapt to contextual information and handle the
phenomenon under consideration. Each test in-
stance consists of a true example (a sequence of
sentences and their reference translation from the
data) and several contrastive translations which
differ from the true one only in one specific aspect.
All contrastive translations are correct and plau-
sible translations at the sentence level, and only
context reveals the inconsistencies between them.
The system is asked to score each candidate trans-
lation, and we compute the system accuracy as
the proportion of times the true translation is pre-
ferred to the contrastive ones. Test set statistics are
shown in Table 1. The suites for deixis and lexical
cohesion are split into development and test sets,
with 500 examples from each used for validation
purposes and the rest for testing. Convergence of
both consistency scores on these development sets
and BLEU score on a general development set are
used as early stopping criteria in models training.
For ellipsis, there is no dedicated development set,
so we evaluate on all the ellipsis data and do not
use it for development.

3.2 Phenomena overview

Deixis Deictic words or phrases, are referential ex-
pressions whose denotation depends on context.

This includes personal deixis (“I”, “you”), place
deixis (“here”, “there”), and discourse deixis,
where parts of the discourse are referenced (“that’s
a good question”). The test set examples are all re-
lated to person deixis, specifically the T-V distinc-
tion between informal and formal you (Latin “tu”
and “vos”) in the Russian translations, and test for
consistency in this respect.

Ellipsis Ellipsis is the omission from a clause
of one or more words that are nevertheless under-
stood in the context of the remaining elements.
In machine translation, elliptical constructions in
the source language pose a problem in two situa-
tions. First, if the target language does not allow
the same types of ellipsis, requiring the elided ma-
terial to be predicted from context. Second, if the
elided material affects the syntax of the sentence.
For example, in Russian the grammatical function
of a noun phrase, and thus its inflection, may de-
pend on the elided verb, or, conversely, the verb
inflection may depend on the elided subject.

There are two different test sets for ellipsis. One
contains examples where a morphological form of
a noun group in the last sentence can not be under-
stood without context beyond the sentence level
(“ellipsis (infl.)” in Table 1). Another includes
cases of verb phrase ellipsis in English, which
does not exist in Russian, thus requires predicting
the verb when translating into Russian (“ellipsis
(VP)” in Table 1).

Lexical cohesion The test set focuses on reiter-
ation of named entities. Where several translations
of a named entity are possible, a model has to pre-
fer consistent translations over inconsistent ones.

4 Experimental Setup

4.1 Data preprocessing

We use the publicly available OpenSubtitles2018
corpus (Lison et al., 2018) for English and Rus-
sian. For a fair comparison with previous work,
we train the baseline MT system on the data re-
leased by Voita et al. (2019). Namely, our MT sys-
tem is trained on 6m instances. These are sentence
pairs with a relative time overlap of subtitle frames
between source and target language subtitles of at
least 0.9.

We gathered 30m groups of 4 consecutive sen-
tences as our monolingual data. We used only doc-
uments not containing groups of sentences from
general development and test sets as well as from
contrastive test sets. The main results we report



880

are for the model trained on all 30m fragments.
We use the tokenization provided by the cor-

pus and use multi-bleu.perl3 on lowercased
data to compute BLEU score. We use beam search
with a beam of 4.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encod-
ing (Sennrich et al., 2016b), with source and tar-
get vocabularies of about 32000 tokens. Trans-
lation pairs were batched together by approxi-
mate sequence length. Each training batch con-
tained a set of translation pairs containing approx-
imately 150004 source tokens. It has been shown
that Transformer’s performance depends heavily
on batch size (Popel and Bojar, 2018), and we
chose a large batch size to ensure the best perfor-
mance. In training context-aware models, for early
stopping we use both convergence in BLEU score
on the general development set and scores on the
consistency development sets. After training, we
average the 5 latest checkpoints.

4.2 Models

The baseline model, the model used for back-
translation, and the DocRepair model are all
Transformer base models (Vaswani et al., 2017).
More precisely, the number of layers is N = 6
with h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. The
dimensionality of input and output is dmodel =
512, and the inner-layer of a feed-forward net-
works has dimensionality dff = 2048. We
use regularization as described in Vaswani et al.
(2017).

As a second baseline, we use the two-pass
CADec model (Voita et al., 2019). The first pass
produces sentence-level translations. The second
pass takes both the first-pass translation and rep-
resentations of the context sentences as input and
returns contextualized translations. CADec re-
quires document-level parallel training data, while
DocRepair only needs monolingual training data.

4.3 Generating round-trip translations

On the selected 6m instances we train sentence-
level translation models in both directions. To cre-
ate training data for DocRepair, we proceed as fol-
lows. The Russian monolingual data is first trans-
lated into English, using the Russian→English

model and beam search with beam size of 4. Then,
we use the English→Russian model to sample
translations with temperature of 0.5. For each
sentence, we precompute 20 sampled translations
and randomly choose one of them when forming a
training minibatch for DocRepair. Also, in train-
ing, we replace each token in the input with a ran-
dom one with the probability of 10%.

4.4 Optimizer
As in Vaswani et al. (2017), we use the Adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015), the parameters are
β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ε = 109. We vary the
learning rate over the course of training using the
formula:

lrate = scale ·min(step_num0.5,
step_num · warmup_steps1.5),

where warmup_steps = 16000 and scale = 4.

5 Results

5.1 General results
The BLEU scores are provided in Table 2 (we
evaluate translations of 4-sentence fragments). To
see which part of the improvement is due to fixing
agreement between sentences rather than simply
sentence-level post-editing, we train the same re-
pair model at the sentence level. Each sentence
in a group is now corrected separately, then they
are put back together in a group. One can see that
most of the improvement comes from accounting
for extra-sentential dependencies. DocRepair out-
performs the baseline and CADec by 0.7 BLEU,
and its sentence-level repair version by 0.5 BLEU.

5.2 Consistency results
Scores on the phenomena test sets are provided in
Table 3. For deixis, lexical cohesion and ellip-
sis (infl.) we see substantial improvements over
both the baseline and CADec. The largest im-
provement over CADec (22.5 percentage points)

is for lexical cohesion. However, there is a drop
of almost 5 percentage points for VP ellipsis. We
hypothesize that this is because it is hard to learn
to correct inconsistencies in translations caused
by VP ellipsis relying on monolingual data alone.
Figure 3(a) shows an example of inconsistency
caused by VP ellipsis in English. There is no
VP ellipsis in Russian, and when translating aux-
iliary “did” the model has to guess the main verb.
Figure 3(b) shows steps of generating round-trip
translations for the target side of the previous
example. When translating from Russian, main
verbs are unlikely to be translated as the auxil-
iary “do” in English, and hence the VP ellipsis is
rarely present on the English side. This implies
the model trained using the round-trip translations
will not be exposed to many VP ellipsis examples
in training. We discuss this further in Section 6.2.

Table 4 provides scores for deixis and lexi-
cal cohesion separately for different distances be-
tween sentences requiring consistency. It can be
seen, that the performance of DocRepair degrades
less than that of CADec when the distance be-
tween sentences requiring consistency gets larger.

5.3 Human evaluation
We conduct a human evaluation on random 700
examples from our general test set. We picked
only examples where a DocRepair translation is
not a full copy of the baseline one.5

The annotators were provided an original group
of sentences in English and two translations: base-
line context-agnostic one and the one corrected
by the DocRepair model. Translations were pre-
sented in random order with no indication which
model they came from. The task is to pick one of
the three options: (1) the first translation is better,
(2) the second translation is better, (3) the trans-
lations are of equal quality. The annotators were
asked to avoid the third answer if they are able to
give preference to one of the translations. No other
guidelines were given.

The results are provided in Table 5. In about
52% of the cases annotators marked translations
as having equal quality. Among the cases where
one of the translations was marked better than the
other, the DocRepair translation was marked bet-
ter in 73% of the cases. This shows a strong pref-
erence of the annotators for corrected translations
over the baseline ones.

5As we further discuss in Section 7, DocRepair does not
change the base translation at all in about 20% of the cases.

6 Varying Training Data

In this section, we discuss the influence of the
training data chosen for document-level models.
In all experiments, we used the DocRepair model.

6.1 The amount of training data

Table 6 provides BLEU and consistency scores for
the DocRepair model trained on different amount
of data. We see that even when using a dataset of
moderate size (e.g., 5m fragments) we can achieve
performance comparable to the model trained on a
large amount of data (30m fragments). Moreover,
we notice that deixis scores are less sensitive to the
amount of training data than lexical cohesion and
ellipsis scores. The reason might be that, as we ob-
served in our previous work (Voita et al., 2019), in-
consistencies in translations due to the presence of
deictic words and phrases are more frequent in this
dataset than other types of inconsistencies. Also,
as we show in Section 7, this is the phenomenon
the model learns faster in training.

6.2 One-way vs round-trip translations

In this section, we discuss the limitations of us-
ing only monolingual data to model inconsisten-
cies between sentence-level translations. In Sec-
tion 5.2 we observed a drop in performance on
VP ellipsis for DocRepair compared to CADec,
which was trained on parallel data. We hypoth-
esized that this is due to the differences between
one-way and round-trip translations, and now we
test this hypothesis. To do so, we fix the dataset
and vary the way in which the input for DocRe-
pair is generated: round-trip or one-way transla-
tions. The latter assumes that document-level data
is parallel, and translations are sampled from the
source side of the sentences in a group rather than
from their back-translations. For parallel data, we
take 1.5m parallel instances which were used for
CADec training and add 1m instances from our
monolingual data. For segments in the parallel

part, we either sample translations from the source
side or use round-trip translations. The results are
provided in Table 7.

The model trained on one-way translations is
slightly better than the one trained on round-trip
translations. As expected, VP ellipsis is the hard-
est phenomena to be captured using round-trip
translations, and the DocRepair model trained on
one-way translated data gains 6% accuracy on this
test set. This shows that the DocRepair model ben-
efits from having access to non-synthetic English
data. This results in exposing DocRepair at train-
ing time to Russian translations which suffer from
the same inconsistencies as the ones it will have to
correct at test time.

6.3 Filtering: monolingual (no filtering) or
parallel

Note that the scores of the DocRepair model
trained on 2.5m instances randomly chosen from
monolingual data (Table 6) are different from the
ones for the model trained on 2.5m instances com-
bined from parallel and monolingual data (Ta-
ble 7). For convenience, we show these two in
Table 8.

The domain, the dataset these two data sam-
ples were gathered from, and the way we gener-
ated training data for DocRepair (round-trip trans-
lations) are all the same. The only difference lies
in how the data was filtered. For parallel data, as in
the previous work (Voita et al., 2018), we picked
only sentence pairs with large relative time over-
lap of subtitle frames between source-language
and target-language subtitles. This is necessary to



883

ensure the quality of translation data: one needs
groups of consecutive sentences in the target lan-
guage where every sentence has a reliable transla-
tion.

Table 8 shows that the quality of the model
trained on data which came from the parallel part
is worse than the one trained on monolingual data.
This indicates that requiring each sentence in a
group to have a reliable translation changes the
distribution of the data, which might be not benefi-
cial for translation quality and provides extra mo-
tivation for using monolingual data.

7 Learning Dynamics

Let us now look into how the process of DocRe-
pair training progresses. Figure 4a shows how the
BLEU scores with the reference translation and
with the baseline context-agnostic translation (i.e.
the input for the DocRepair model) are changing
during training. First, the model quickly learns to
copy baseline translations: the BLEU score with
the baseline is very high. Then it gradually learns
to change them, which leads to an improvement in
BLEU with the reference translation and a drop in
BLEU with the baseline. Importantly, the model
is reluctant to make changes: the BLEU score be-
tween translations of the converged model and the
baseline is 82.5. We count the number of changed
sentences in every 4-sentence fragment in the test
set and plot the histogram in Figure 4b. In over
than 20% of the cases the model has not changed
base translations at all. In almost 40%, it mod-
ified only one sentence and left the remaining 3
sentences unchanged. The model changed more
than half sentences in a group in only 14% of the
cases. Several examples of the DocRepair transla-
tions are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 5 shows how consistency scores are
changing in training.6 For deixis, the model
achieves the final quality quite quickly; for the
rest, it needs a large number of training steps to
converge.

8 Related Work

Our work is most closely related to two lines
of research: automatic post-editing (APE) and
document-level machine translation.

6Deixis and lexical cohesion scores are evaluated on the
development sets which were used in training for the stopping
criteria. Ellipsis test sets were not used at training time; the
scores are shown here only for visualization purposes.

8.1 Automatic post-editing

Our model can be regarded as an automatic post-
editing system – a system designed to fix system-
atic MT errors that is decoupled from the main MT
system. Automatic post-editing has a long history,
including rule-based (Knight and Chander, 1994),
statistical (Simard et al., 2007) and neural ap-
proaches (Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz,
2016; Pal et al., 2016; Freitag et al., 2019).

In terms of architectures, modern approaches
use neural sequence-to-sequence models, ei-
ther multi-source architectures that consider both
the original source and the baseline translation
(Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2016; Pal
et al., 2016), or monolingual repair systems, as
in Freitag et al. (2019), which is concurrent work
to ours. True post-editing datasets are typi-
cally small and expensive to create (Specia et al.,
2017), hence synthetic training data has been cre-
ated that uses original monolingual data as output
for the sequence-to-sequence model, paired with
an automatic back-translation (Sennrich et al.,
2016a) and/or round-trip translation as its input(s)
(Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2016; Fre-

that the speaker in the second one is feminine (Rayna), but the baseline translation was masculine. (c) corrected
wrong morphological form of the pronoun, which was not understood with the elided verb in the third sentence.

itag et al., 2019).

While previous work on automatic post-editing
operated on the sentence level, the main novelty
of this work is that our DocRepair model oper-
ates on groups of sentences and is thus able to fix
consistency errors caused by the context-agnostic
baseline MT system. We consider this strategy
of sentence-level baseline translation and context-
aware monolingual repair attractive when parallel
document-level data is scarce.

For training, the DocRepair model only requires
monolingual document-level data. While we cre-
ate synthetic training data via round-trip transla-
tion similarly to earlier work (Junczys-Dowmunt
and Grundkiewicz, 2016; Freitag et al., 2019),
note that we purposefully use sentence-level MT
systems for this to create the types of consistency
errors that we aim to fix with the context-aware
DocRepair model. Not all types of consistency er-
rors that we want to fix emerge from a round-trip
translation, so access to parallel document-level
data can be useful (Section 6.2).

8.2 Document-level NMT

Neural models of MT that go beyond the sentence-
level are an active research area (Jean et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017; Tiedemann and Scherrer, 2017;
Bawden et al., 2018; Voita et al., 2018; Maruf and
Haffari, 2018; Agrawal et al., 2018; Miculicich
et al., 2018; Kuang et al., 2018; Voita et al., 2019).
Typically, the main MT system is modified to take
additional context as its input. One limitation of
these approaches is that they assume that parallel
document-level training data is available.

Closest to our work are two-pass models for
document-level NMT (Xiong et al., 2019; Voita
et al., 2019), where a second, context-aware model
takes the translation and hidden representations
of the sentence-level first-pass model as its input.
The second-pass model can in principle be trained
on a subset of the parallel training data (Voita
et al., 2019), somewhat relaxing the assumption
that all training data is at the document level.

Our work is different from this previous work
in two main respects. Firstly, we show that
consistency can be improved with only monolin-
gual document-level training data. Secondly, the

DocRepair model is decoupled from the first-pass
MT system, which improves its portability.

9 Conclusions

We introduce the first approach to context-
aware machine translation using only monolin-
gual document-level data. We propose a monolin-
gual DocRepair model to correct inconsistencies
between sentence-level translations. The model
performs automatic post-editing on a sequence of
sentence-level translations, refining translations of
sentences in context of each other. Our approach
results in substantial improvements in translation
quality as measured by BLEU, targeted contrastive
evaluation of several discourse phenomena and
human evaluation. Moreover, we perform er-
ror analysis and detect which discourse phenom-
ena are hard to capture using only monolingual
document-level data. While in the current work
we used text fragments of 4 sentences, in future
work we would like to consider longer contexts.
