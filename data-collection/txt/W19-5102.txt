Abstract

In this paper we focus on verbal multiword ex-
pressions (VMWEs) in Bulgarian and Roma-
nian as reflected in the wordnets of the two
languages. The annotation of VMWEs relies
on the classification defined within the PAR-
SEME Cost Action. After outlining the pro-
perties of various types of VMWEs, a cross-
language comparison is drawn, aimed to hi-
ghlight the similarities and the differences be-
tween Bulgarian and Romanian with respect to
the lexicalization and distribution of VMWEs.

The contribution of this work is in outlining
essential features of the description and clas-
sification of VMWEs and the cross-language
comparison at the lexical level, which is essen-
tial for the understanding of the need for uni-
form annotation guidelines and a viable proce-
dure for validation of the annotation.

1 Introduction

The work on the Bulgarian and the Romanian
wordnets (BulNet and RoWN, respectively) has
started within the BalkaNet project (Tufis, et al.,
2004). The approach adopted relies on the Base
Concept set approach and the top-down extension
(Rodriguez et al., 1998): the initial Base Con-
cept set of the EuroWordNet (1,218 synsets) is
extended by transferring all direct or indirect des-
cendant synsets from Princeton WordNet (Miller,
1995; Fellbaum, 1998) (PWN) into the wordnets
under development. The literals are then transla-
ted and their list is enriched with the help of sy-
nonymy and other dictionaries; the synsets are
supplied with the appropriate glosses either by
translating the English gloss or by constructing a

new one; the synsets identification numbers are the
same as in PWN. In addition, over 400 concepts
considered specific to the Balkan area are included
in the wordnets and for them a merge approach is
followed: synsets are created for the new concepts,
glosses are added, a specific identification number
is assigned and a hypernym for each of them is
found among the synsets already implemented in
the Balkan wordnets to which they are linked as
hyponyms (Tufis, et al., 2004).

After BalkaNet’s completion the enrichment of
BulNet has been directed towards providing le-
xical coverage of a subset of a reference cor-
pus annotated with word senses from BulNet in
the course of a word-sense annotation task (Ko-
eva et al., 2011). Currently, BulNet contains
92,910 manually verified synsets comprising a to-
tal of 164,418 literals (representing 76,285 unique
ones), out of which 63,930 literals (57,791 unique
ones) are multiword expressions, accounting for
28.3% of the total number of literals (i.e., 43.1%
unique ones). In recent years the work has expan-
ded towards covering and automatically labelling
verb-noun derivational and morphosemantic rela-
tions (Koeva, 2008; Dimitrova et al., 2014; Leseva
et al., 2015; Koeva et al., 2016), verbal multiword
expressions annotation and encoding within the
PARSEME project (Ramisch et al., 2018), enhan-
cing BulNet with various semantic and syntactic
relations from other resources such as FrameNet
and VerbNet (Leseva et al., 2018).

The further quantitative enrichment of RoWN
targeted the lexical coverage of various corpora
collected over time (Tufis, and Mititelu, 2014). At
the moment RoWN contains 59,348 synsets in



3

which 85,277 literals (representing 50,480 unique
ones) occur, out of which 20,031 (i.e., 17,816 uni-
que ones) are multiword literals, accounting for
23.5% of the total number of literals (i.e., 35.3%
unique ones). The qualitative enrichment focused
on in-line importing of the SUMO/MILO concept
labels (Niles and Pease, 2001), connotation vec-
tors for synsets (Tufis, and S, tefănescu, 2012), de-
rivational relations (Barbu Mititelu, 2013) and an-
notation of verbal synsets with labels specific to
various types of multiword expressions, adopting
the same framework (the PARSEME annotation
guidelines) (Barbu Mititelu and Mitrofan, 2019).

A detailed overview of the work on the two
wordnets individually and in parallel is provided
in (Barbu Mititelu et al., 2017).

RoWN can be queried at http://relate.
racai.ro/, while the BulNet user inter-
face http://dcl.bas.bg/bulnet/ provi-
des access to both BulNet and RoWN, among
other languages, as well as parallel visualization
of corresponding synsets in two wordnets (Rizov
et al., 2015).

In this paper we present the types of VMWEs
existing in each language, as they are reflected in
the respective corpora created within PARSEME
(section 2). We continue with the presentation of
and quantitative data about the types of VMWEs
in each of the two wordnets (section 3). They con-
stitute the basis for the comparative analysis of
VMWEs (in section 4), after which we draw the
conclusions and envisage some directions for fur-
ther work.

2 Bulgarian and Romanian VMWEs in
the Multilingual PARSEME Corpus

The multilingual PARSEME Corpus (version 1.1)
of verbal multiword expressions contains subcor-
pora for 20 languages in which verbal MWEs have
been manually annotated according to universal
guidelines (Ramisch et al., 2018). For most langu-
ages, morphological and syntactic annotation was
provided, including parts of speech, lemmas, mor-
phological features and/or syntactic dependencies.

2.1 Types of Annotated VMWEs

The types of VMWEs from the PARSEME classi-
fication (Savary et al., 2018) applicable to Bulga-
rian and/or Romanian are:
(1) universal categories, i.e., types of VMWEs
existing in all natural languages (participating in

the PARSEME corpus annotation action):

• light verb constructions (LVCs) are made
up of a verb and a predicative noun (directly
following the verb or being introduced by a
preposition) (Tu and Roth, 2011; Nagy et al.,
2013). Depending on the semantics of the
verb, two subtypes are identified:

– LVC.full – these are expressions in
which the verb’s contribution to the ex-
pression’s semantics is (almost) null (we
call the verb “light”), e.g., EN pay a vi-
sit, BG davam podslon (give shelter),
RO lua o decizie (make a decision);

– LVC.cause – in these expressions the
verb has a causative meaning, i.e. it
identifies the subject as the cause or so-
urce of the event or state expressed by
the noun in the expression, e.g., EN
grant rights, BG hvărlyam văv văztorg
(throw into rapture, “excite”), RO da
bătăi de cap (give pains of head, “give
headaches”);

• verbal idioms (VIDs) – they have a verb
head and at least one dependent component,
and their meaning is non-compositional to
a certain degree (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin
et al., 2003; Vincze et al., 2012), e.g., EN kick
the bucket, BG komandvam parada (com-
mand the parade, “call the shots”), RO trage
pe sfoară (pull on rope, “cheat”);

(2) quasi-universal categories, i.e., existing only in
some of the languages (in the PARSEME shared
task annotation):

• inherently reflexive verbs (IRVs) – these
are verbs that are accompanied by a pro-
noun with a reflexive meaning (usually a cli-
tic), e.g., EN help oneself, BG usmihvam se
(“smile”), RO se preface (“pretend”);

• inherently adpositional verbs (IAVs) – a
combination of a verb or a VMWE and a pre-
position or postposition that is either always
required or changes the meaning of the verb
significantly and is an idiosyncratic part of
the VMWE, e.g., EN rely on, BG zastavam
zad (stand behind, “support, back”). For Ro-
manian, this category was not annotated, al-
though the phenomenon is registered in the
language: RO consta ı̂n/din (consist of/in).

2.2 Corpora
Bulgarian and Romanian corpora were develo-
ped for both edition 1.0 (Savary et al., 2017)
and edition 1.1 (Ramisch et al., 2018) of the
PARSEME shared task on automatic identification
of VMWEs, but the discussion here focuses on
the latter edition, for which the guidelines were
enhanced (Savary et al., 2018) and larger corpora
were used as compared with the first edition.

The Bulgarian subcorpus consists of news arti-
cles and comprises 480,413 tokens in 21,599 sen-
tences, covering 6,704 annotated VMWEs. The
Romanian corpus is also compiled of journalistic
texts, containing 56,703 sentences with 1,015,623
tokens and with 5,891 VMWEs annotated. We can
notice the higher density of VMWEs in the Bulga-
rian corpus in comparison with the Romanian one
(see discussion below, subsection 3.2).

Both annotated corpora are available for down-
load and use under the Creative Commons BY 4.0
license1.

The distribution of the types of VMWEs in the
two corpora is presented in Table 1. Although
the corpora are not parallel and we cannot dis-
cuss directly correspondences in the distribution
of VMWEs, both corpora consist of news texts and
some comparisons between the two languages can
be drawn. We notice the high frequency of refle-
xive verbs (IRV) in both of them. LVCs are much
better represented in the Bulgarian corpus. This
is easy to explain considering the greater number
of “light” verbs identified in Bulgarian. The re-
verse is observed for VIDs, which can be due to:
(i) the different coverage of the phenomenon in the
two languages, (ii) the types of texts: even if both
corpora are journalistic, the targeted audience, the
types of articles, etc. influence the authors’ lexical
choices, and hence, the linguistic characteristics of
the corpora, (iii) the different treatment of border-
line cases. The percentage of LVC.cause is similar
in both corpora.

We will try to answer the questions related to
the differences observed at the text level (the PAR-
SEME corpora) and the lexical level (the word-
nets) in the sections to follow.

of VMWEs in the two languages. The envisaged
comparative approach could only be imagined in
connection to the two wordnets, as they are alig-
ned lexical resources (see section 1). In what fo-
llows, we discuss the distribution of the VMWE
types at the lexicon level in the two languages,
always having in mind the fact that the two word-
nets are not complete, they do not offer a compre-
hensive image of the lexical richness and diversity
of the two languages.

The teams involved in the annotation of MWEs
in BulNet and RoWN are to a large degree the
same as the language teams involved in the PAR-
SEME project, so the current work is a continua-
tion of our joint efforts focused on establishing a
suitable representation of VMWEs at the lexicon
level. Achieving a uniform and consistent annota-
tion strategy of VMWEs in Bulgarian (as a Slavic
language) and Romanian (as a Romance language)
will be a step towards a largely language indepen-
dent description which can support ongoing efforts
in the field of MWEs. What is more, these teams
are also the ones involved in the development of
the two wordnets, thus they are very familiar with
the characteristics and intricacies of the two lexi-
cal resources.

3.1 Annotation Procedures and Conventions

For annotating VMWEs in BulNet and RoWN
each team extracted the verbal synsets in the two
wordnets containing at least one multitoken literal.
Each such literal was manually assigned a label
from the set defined in PARSEME (VID, LVC.full,
LVC.cause, IRV, for both languages, and IAV for
Bulgarian). One would say that the IRV label co-
uld have been automatically assigned. However,
both in Bulgarian and in Romanian the reflexive
pronoun se (with all its inflected forms) is ambi-
guous – besides the reflexive value, it can also:

(a) have an impersonal meaning in Romanian, e.g.
RO se ı̂nţelege (SE understand “everyone under-
stands”) – these cases are encoded as type NONE
(see below), (b) express passive in both languages,
e.g., BG primerite se broyat răchno, RO exemplele
se numără manual (examples are counted manua-
lly) – these cases are not included in either word-
net, or (c) be part of a larger VID expression, e.g.
RO se sparge ı̂n figuri (SE break in figures, “bo-
ast”) or BG broya se na prăsti (to be counted on
fingers, “be in very small numbers”) – and enco-
ded as VID. Thus, manual annotation was neces-
sary.

Wordnet principles of knowledge representation
as well as the expand method for the development
of BulNet and RoWN necessitated two additio-
nal labels: NONE and NO LEX. The first label
(NONE) was introduced for those cases where the
multitoken verbal literals are free phrases with a
literal, compositional meaning not exhibiting the
(semantic and morphosyntactic) characteristics of
the VMWE classes, such as EN find fault, RO cu-
lege nuci (pick nuts), equivalent to the PWN syn-
set {nut:1} (gloss: gather nuts), or BG tantsuvam
dzhayv (dance jive) corresponding to the PWN
synset {jive:1} (gloss: dance to jive music). The
implementation of synsets containing free multito-
ken phrases was adopted in the cases where these
constitute good or conventional translation equi-
valents to the respective lexicalized English con-
cepts; in many cases these phrases qualify as co-
llocations, or, at least, are likely to appear in run-
ning text in the given form.

The second label (NO LEX) is reserved for ca-
ses where a certain concept existing in PWN is
not familiar in the languages under discussion and
therefore could not be supplied with an exact cor-
respondence (such as a VMWE or a conventional
free phrase or collocation). These synsets have
been annotated differently in Bulgarian and Ro-
manian. In BulNet, a descriptive, gloss-like lite-
ral has been constructed which presents the con-
cept but is unlikely to appear in running text, e.g.,
BG {bera drebni bezkostilkovi plodove:1}, EN
{berry:1} (gloss: pick or gather berries). The Ro-
manian team has decided on a different approach,
leaving these literals empty, but adding a descrip-
tive gloss to them. While the phenomenon of lexi-
calization is beyond the scope of the current study,
we included these cases in the data in order to exa-
mine lexical gaps.

The Bulgarian team has annotated two ad-
ditional categories: (i) cases with a man-
datory pronominal accusative or dative clitic
(ACCT/DATT), e.g., BG {sărbi me:1} (itch.3SG
me.ME.1SG.ACC) – EN {itch:2} (gloss: have or
perceive an itch); and (ii) borderline cases (OTH),
e.g., BG razpăvam na krăst (spread on the cross
“nail to the cross”), which is used both litera-
lly and figuratively. In the literal sense, each of
the elements bears its own semantic load and the
meaning is easily construable as compositional,
thus not a VID, but nevertheless understood as a
whole. The same may be observed with MWE
terms which are more likely to be marked as VID:
BG {povdigam na kvadrat:1} (raise to a square)
and RO {ridica la pătrat} (raise to square), both
corresponding to EN {square:2} (gloss: raise to
the second power).

The ACCT/DATT and OTH categories fall out-
side the scope of this study due to the fact that they
have not been part of the PARSEME annotation
process, have not been consistently described as
VMWEs and are not annotated in RoWN.

3.2 Distribution of VMWEs in BulNet and
RoWN

The types of VMWEs in BulNet and RoWN and
their distribution across categories are presented
in Table 2. Unlike Romanian, Bulgarian verbs
have the category of aspect, which means that for
a given synset there may be two (or more) Bul-
garian VMWEs with roughly the same meaning,
e.g., izpera pari (perfective) – izpiram pari (im-
perfective), to which there is only one RO spăla
bani and one EN {launder:2} (gloss: convert il-
legally obtained funds into legal ones) counter-
part. Prefixation may also result in the forma-
tion of aspectual pairs/triples, as almost all verbal
prefixes may have a semantically bleached sense
with predominantly aspectual meaning. In fact,
in the above example, there is such a triple: BG
pera pari (imperfective), izpera pari (perfective,
formed by prefixation), izpiram pari (secondary
imperfective, formed by suffixation from the per-
fective). In the context of VMWEs, this question
has been discussed by Barbu Mititelu and Leseva
(2018). This is one of the main reasons for the
greater number of VMWEs in Bulgarian as com-
pared to Romanian (see columns BulNet (all) and
RoWN in Table 2). This is why for Bulgarian we
also present the number of VMWEs where aspec-

Table 2: Distribution of VMWEs types (excluding ’NONE’ and ’NO LEX’) in BulNet and RoWN. For BulNet,
we present number of total VMWEs (all) as well as data where aspectual verb pairs are grouped and counted as a
single VMWE (asp. gr.).

tual pairs (suffix-based only) are counted as single
VMWEs (columns BulNet (asp. gr.) of Table 2)
in order to facilitate comparison between the two
languages.

For both languages the distribution of the types
of VMWEs in the wordnets correlates with that in
the corpus: data distribution in the lexicon mainly
confirms language use. In both BulNet and RoWN
the IRVs are the most numerous, ∼56%, followed
by VIDs. It can be seen from the data (Table 2)
that the percentage of VIDs in Romanian is hi-
gher than in Bulgarian, in both the corpora (27.3 in
Romanian to 18.8 in Bulgarian) and the wordnets
(35.1 in Romanian to 24.0 in Bulgarian), while the
opposite tendency is observed for LVCs.

The relatively small number of LVCs in the two
wordnets, and especially in Romanian, is largely
explainable by the fact that this type of VMWEs is
not well established in the wordnet structure, and
the teams who have worked on the two wordnets
throughout the years have followed different con-
ventions.

Moreover, the adopted principle within the
WordNet framework has been to define separate
synsets to account for the “light” verb senses, such
as: {give:5, pay:7} (gloss: convey, as of a com-
pliment, regards, attention, etc.; bestow), as in
Don’t pay him any mind, pay attention; give the
orders, Give him my best regards; and {make:1,
do:1} (gloss: engage in), as in make love, not war,
make an effort, make revolution; do research, do
nothing. As a result, the inclusion of LVCs in
PWN was more of an exception rather than a rule.
In view of the approach adopted in the initial sta-
ges of creation of RoWN and BulNet, LVCs were

introduced primarily where no lexicalized verbs
were found as a counterpart for the respective En-
glish synset, e.g., BG {postavyam v shah:1, da-
vam shah:1,...}, RO {da şah:1}, EN {check:19}
(gloss: place into check). Well-established LVCs
(frequently used in the language) were also added,
especially if they have counterparts in PWN (see
subsection 4.5).

The existing lexicographic tradition has also
played a part in the decisions made by the teams.
For instance, Bulgarian dictionaries tend to en-
code primarily VIDs and IRVs and have largely
neglected LVCs and IAVs (the existence of the lat-
ter is subject to debate). Only a few researchers
outside the computational linguistics community
have acknowledged the need for systematic lexi-
cographic description and treatment of LVCs (cf.
for instance (Korytkowska, 2008)). The situation
is similar in the Romanian lexicography: IRVs
and VIDs are systematically recorded, and the lat-
ter also benefit dedicated dictionaries. Among
them, (Mărănduc, 2010) is the most permissive
and many phrases, LVCs among them, found their
place in it.

Most VMWEs belong to only one type, irres-
pective of the number of their occurrences (i.e.,
synsets to which they belong) in one wordnet.
However, in RoWN there are some literals which
are annotated differently when belonging to diffe-
rent synsets, i.e., when having different meanings:
e.g. scoate fum (give out smoke) is annotated as
NONE when being in the synset corresponding
to the English {fume:4; smoke:4} (gloss: emit a
cloud of fine particles) and it is annotated as VID
when belonging to the synset corresponding to the



7

English {steam:3} (gloss: get very angry).

4 Comparative Analysis of VMWEs in
BulNet and RoWN

In this section we look comparatively at the
VMWEs in the two wordnets: our interest is in
the concepts which the two languages tend to lexi-
calize as VMWEs and, going even a bit further,
to what degree the concepts in the two langua-
ges are lexicalized by the same type of VMWEs.
As far as we are aware, this is the first time
such a linguistic comparison is made, at least at
the lexicon level. Although bilingual dictionaries
(Kaldieva-Zaharieva, 1997) show such correspon-
dences, there have not been any studies dedicated
to this aspect.

4.1 Overview
Table 3 offers an overview of the number of syn-
sets containing VMWEs in BulNet and RoWN.
Out of the total number of verbal synsets, we show
how many contain at least one VMWE, then the
number of synsets in the set intersection of the sets
of synsets containing VMWEs in the two word-
nets. In the last row we calculated the number of
synsets which in one language contain at least one
VMWE, while in the other they contain none.

1,418 1,143

Table 3: Synsets with VMWEs in BulNet and RoWN

The set intersection of the synsets containing
VMWEs in BulNet and in RoWN comprises 944
synsets, which represents 40% of the verbal syn-
sets containing MWEs in BulNet and 45% of
those in RoWN, thus showing a substantial over-
lap between the two wordnets, already indicative
of some common tendencies in the two languages
with respect to the way in which verbal concepts
are lexicalized. In comparison, the intersection of
synsets containing VMWEs between BulNet and
PWN is 664, and between RoWN and PWN is
656, counting the multiword literals in PWN syn-
sets, as VMWEs are not annotated in PWN.

The literals from corresponding BulNet and
RoWN synsets are considered translation equiva-
lents. There are 3,656 such literal-to-literal rela-
tions where the literals are VMWEs or multitoken
free phrases (marked as NONE), and their distri-
bution is presented in Table 4 (in the current sec-
tion, for the purposes of comparison, suffix-based
aspectual pairs in Bulgarian are counted as a single
VMWE).

Table 5 reflects the number of synsets where
there is a direct correspondence between VMWE
types (cf. Table 4 which shows the number of all
literal-to-literal relations, including multiple cases
within the same synsets). Such cases represent
72.7% of the synsets in the intersection. That is
indicative of the two languages’ strong tendency
of lexicalizing the same concepts by means of the
same type of VMWEs.

Table 5: Number of synsets with literal-to-literal cor-

In what follows, we analyze the cases where
there is asymmetry between the Romanian and the
Bulgarian data – cases where there is a VMWEs
only in one of the languages but not in the other
(section 4.2), and the specifics of the non-VMWE
multitoken phrases and their place in the WordNet
structure (section 4.3).

We further illustrate equivalent synsets repre-
senting the three most frequent categories – IRV
(section 4.4), LVC (section 4.5) and VID (section



8

4.6), and discuss the similarities as well as the di-
fferences in expressing the relevant concepts in the
two languages. The corresponding PWN synsets
are also presented to facilitate the understanding
of the Bulgarian and the Romanian synsets.

4.2 VMWEs from either Wordnet with no
VMWE correspondence in the other one

There are 1,418 synsets in BulNet which contain a
VMWE with no corresponding VMWE in RoWN,
and 1,143 synsets with a VMWE only in RoWN.
Several cases were identified:

(i) the synset in one of the languages contains
at least one VMWE, while its counterpart in the
other language consists of simple-word literals:
805 cases in the BulNet data and 955 cases from
RoWN: BG {spya leten săn:1, estiviram:1}, RO
{estiva:1}, EN {estivate:1, aestivate:1} (gloss:
sleep during summer);

(ii) the synset in one of the languages con-
tains at least one VMWE of the types adopted in
the PARSEME project or is expressed by a free
phrase (marked as NONE or NO LEX), while in
the other language it is not lexicalized: 129 syn-
sets in the BulNet data – out of which 39 are
VMWEs (LVC, VID, IRV or IAV), 45 are con-
veyed by a free phrase marked as NONE and the
remaining 45 – as descriptive phrases marked as
NO LEX: BG {implantiram se:1}, RO {no cor-
respondence}, EN {implant:2} (gloss: become at-
tached to and embedded in the uterus); no such
cases are found in the RoWN data since the non-
lexicalized synsets in BulNet are supplied with a
descriptive literal (marked as NO LEX) and thus
are present in the BulNet dataset;

(iii) the synset in one of the languages contains
a VMWE, but its counterpart in the other wordnet
has not yet been implemented so there is no in-
formation regarding its lexicalization – 342 cases
in the BulNet data and 188 cases in the RoWN:
BG {izmivam si rătsete:1, izmiya si rătsete:1},
RO {not implemented}, EN {wash one’s hands:1}
(gloss: to absolve oneself of responsibility or fu-
ture blame);

(iv) the synset is language specific (denotes a
concept which is typical of one of the langua-
ges and is not present or at least not implemented
in the other wordnet or in PWN) and contains a
VMWE – 142 cases in the data from BulNet and
none in RoWN: BG {edva se dărzha na kraka:1}
(can barely stand on one’s feet (with fatigue)).

4.3 Non-VMWE Multitoken Phrases and
Lexicalization

As discussed earlier (section 3), non-VMWE mul-
titoken phrases have been encoded in the two
wordnets (1,209 in BulNet and 1,217 in RoWN).
We may even argue that a number of literals in
PWN also fall in this category, e.g., EN make
pure:1, use of goods and services:1, make unne-
cessary:1, although the precise number of these
cases is unknown.

In the two languages under discussion non-
VMWE multitoken literals have been implemen-
ted largely by way of compensating for lexical
gaps where a free phrase constitutes a widely used
translation equivalent. Although the differences in
the lexicalization patterns across languages may
be quite idiosyncratic, certain trends have emerged
from the analysis of the data. Here we illustrate
one such trend: in a number of cases where the Bu-
lgarian and the Romanian wordnet teams have re-
sorted to encoding non-VMWE multitoken phra-
ses, we find in PWN a lexicalization pattern typi-
cal for English where an argument is incorporated
in the conceptual structure of a verb and the name
of this argument gives the name of the respective
predicate (Jackendoff, 1990). Such verbs are fo-
und across classes of verbs more or less systema-
tically. The example below illustrates incorpora-
ted Theme-argument verbs – the item undergoing
some influence or change (bearing the semantic
role of Theme) gives the name of the predicate
relation: BG: {săbiram perli:1, săbera perli:1}
(lit. gather pearls), RO {pescui perle:1} (lit. fish
pearls), EN: {pearl:1} (gloss: gather pearls, from
oysters in the ocean). Apart from this synset,
there are a number of other synsets in the same
local WordNet tree (synsets with a common hy-
pernym {gather:1, garner:3, collect:3, pull toge-
ther:1}) whose common definition may be posited
as “gather X...”, where X is nuts/clams/oysters,..:
{nut:1}, {clam:1}, {oyster:1}, respectively. The
Bulgarian and the Romanian counterparts of these
verbs are combinations of the type V + object NP,
where the NP corresponds to the English incorpo-
rated Theme-argument. The productivity of this
pattern is reflected in the productivity of zero de-
rivation.

Another visible trend is for English synsets
to contain a one-word compound or a metaphor
which in the languages under discussion is con-
veyed by a free phrase: BG {parkiram uspo-



9

redno:1, parkiram paralelno:1}, RO {parca late-
ral:1}, EN {parallel-park:1} (gloss: park directly
behind another vehicle).

4.4 Analysis of IRVs – Correspondences and
Differences

As straightforwardly visible from the data, IRVs
are by far the most represented category in the
RoWN – BulNet intersection, which is to be ex-
pected, taking into account the semantics of the
reflexive verbs in the two languages (Slavcheva,
2006).

Analyzing the semantic primes (Koeva et al.,
2016) of these IRVs, we notice that more than a
quarter of them are verb.change (125). The next
well represented semantic prime is verb.motion
(81). Others are verb.stative (48), verb.social
(45), verb.communication (31), etc. Here is an
example of VMWEs of another semantic prime,
verb.emotion (with 22 expressions altogether), in
two rich synsets: RO {[se] ı̂nfuria:2 IRV, [se]
enerva:1 IRV, [se] irita:1 IRV, [se] mânia:1 IRV,
[se] supăra:1 IRV}, BG {yadosvam se:3 IRV, im-
perf., yadosam se:3 IRV, perf., razsărdvam se:1
IRV, imperf., razsărdya se:1 IRV, perf., gnevya
se:1 IRV, imperf., razgnevyavam se:1 IRV, imperf.,
razgnevya se:1 IRV, imperf.}, EN {anger:2, see
red:1 VID} (gloss: become angry).

4.5 Analysis of LVCs – Correspondences and
Differences

Besides what has already been discussed in section
3.2, the reasons for the difference in the number of
LVCs in the two wordnets and the respective PAR-
SEME corpora are due to the number and frequ-
ency of “light” verbs involved in the LVCs in the
two languages. In the PARSEME corpus, we find
9 different verbs heading Romanian LVCs, most of
them with a considerable number of occurrences,
while in the Bulgarian corpus, the verbs that head
LVCs are more than 100, and approximately half
of them have more than 5 occurrences. Similarly,
in RoWN we see 21 light verbs, only 5 of them ha-
ving more than 5 occurrences, and 118 in BulNet,
of which 32 have relatively high frequency.

It has become apparent that different teams con-
strue the scope of the light verbs differently. Al-
though the PARSEME project outlines some gu-
idelines for identifying LVCs, the judgment of a
verb as semantically bleached, which is a key po-
int in the LVC identification process, remains su-
bjective. It is the approach for many languages to

identify a limited set of highly frequent verbs and
consider them as most likely light verb candidates
in combination with a predicative noun. The Bu-
lgarian team have considered a broader range of
high frequency verbs and their synonyms (in Bul-
Net) as possible heads of LVCs and have applied
manual verification to LVC candidates (Stoyanova
et al., 2016). The attempt has been to uncover the
true extent of the phenomenon in the language wi-
thout limiting it beforehand.

It is a well-known fact that LVCs often have
a single verb counterpart which is derivationa-
lly related to the eventive noun in the respective
VMWE, e.g. BG resha/V – reshenie/N – vzemam
reshenie/VMWE, EN decide/V – a decision/N –
make a decision/VMWE, RO decide/V – o deci-
zie/N – lua o decizie/VMWE. Bearing in mind the
structure of wordnets and other factors pointed out
in section 3.2, in many cases wordnet developers
have given preference to the single verb and have
left out possible LVCs conveying the same mea-
ning: for example, the LVC RO face o vizită (pay
a visit), although synonymous with the verb vizita,
is not included in any synset in which vizita oc-
curs, in spite of their identical meaning(s).

Due to the above reasons, we find considerable
discrepancy in the numbers of LVCs in RoWN and
BulNet – only 44 cases of LVC–LVC correspon-
dences (Table 4).

An example of LVC–LVC correspondence is
provided by the following synsets, in which the
choice of VMWE literals is supported by the PWN
data: RO {lua parte:2 LVC.full, participa:5}, BG:
{uchastvam:2, vzemam uchastie:1 LVC.full,vzema
uchastie:1 LVC.full}, EN {participate:1, take
part:1 LVC.full} (gloss: share in something).

With the prerequisites made so far, in the majo-
rity of the cases found in the data, an LVC in one
of the languages under discussion corresponds to
a free phrase collocation in the other.

4.6 Analysis of VIDs – Correspondences and
Differences

Due to their characteristics VIDs are both easily
recognizable and well-represented in lexical re-
sources, including in PWN, which has most li-
kely influenced the choice of VIDs to encode
in BulNet and ROWN: BG {cheta mezhdu redo-
vete:1 VID, prochitam mezhdu redovete:1 VID,
procheta mezhdu redovete:1 VID}, RO {citi prin-
tre rânduri:1 VID}, EN {read between the lines:1



10

VID} (gloss: read what is implied but not expres-
sed on the surface).

More interesting cases are represented by mis-
matches in the two languages. Here is an example
illustrating the situation when a Romanian synset
contains a VID and the Bulgarian has an expres-
sion annotated as NONE. The Romanian expres-
sion has the structure transitive verb + direct object
realized as a definite noun, vârsta, and it answers
positively the test for lexical inflexibility from the
annotation guidelines. The Bulgarian counterpart
includes both V + direct object NP and V + AP
with the literal meaning of “reach majority” or
“become a major”: BG {(do)stigam pălnoletie:1;
(do)stigna pălnoletie:1; navărshvam pălnoletie:1;
navărsha pălnoletie:1; stavam pălnoleten:1; stana
pălnoleten:1}, RO {avea vârsta:1 VID} (have the
age), EN {come of age:1} (gloss: reach a certain
age that marks a transition to maturity).

The next example illustrates the case of a Bu-
lgarian VID whose equivalent in Romanian is a
free word combination made up of the verb fi
(be) and the adjectival locution de ajutor (of help
“helpful”). The Bulgarian counterpart consists of
the verb davam (give, lend) or udryam (hit) and
the noun ramo (shoulder), with a possible inser-
tion of edno (one) (“give a/one shoulder”): BG
{davam ramo:2 VID; dam ramo:1 VID; davam
edno ramo:1 VID; dam edno ramo:1 VID; udryam
edno ramo:1 VID; udarya edno ramo:1 VID}; RO
{fi de ajutor:1}, EN {help out:1} (gloss: be of
help, as in a particular situation of need).

5 Conclusions and Future Work

The comparative overview of the representation of
VMWEs in BulNet and RoWN can be a starting
point for drawing conclusions about the scope and
the distribution of VMWEs in Bulgarian and Ro-
manian, as well as for establishing good practices
for the description of VMWEs in wordnets in ge-
neral.

The work presented here has helped in deter-
mining essential features of the description and
classification of VMWEs with a view to facilita-
ting the future applications of the resources: mor-
phosyntactic and inflectional description, which
enables the recognition of VMWEs in running
text, description of VMWE variants (e.g., aspec-
tual verb pairs, prefixed verbs, possible modifica-
tion of components, etc.), derivational information
to identify VMWE derivatives, etc.

Analyzing VMWEs comparatively at the lexical
level as reflected in the two wordnets under discus-
sion gives a new, outsider’s perspective at the an-
notation of VMWEs and allows for studying not
only the similarities and dissimilarities between
languages, but also the understanding and appli-
cation of annotation guidelines cross-linguistically
and emerges as a viable procedure in the validation
of the annotation performed for a given language.

As a multilingual lexical-semantic resource,
wordnets have numerous applications in machine
and machine-aided translation. Addressing the is-
sues of VMWEs in a unified way across wordnets,
will widen the possibilities of their use.

Beyond translation, it will provide language
material for the study of lexicalization, cross-
linguistic semantic analysis of VMWEs, meta-
phors, etc.
