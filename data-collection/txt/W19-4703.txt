Abstract

Word2Vec models are used to study the se-
mantic chain shift FOOD>MEAT>FLESH
in the history of English, c. 1475-1925.
The development stretches out over a long
time, starting before 1500, and may possi-
bly be continuing to this day. The semantic
changes likely proceeded as a push chain.

1 Introduction

A semantic chain shift is a set of directly re-
lated semantic changes in one lexical field (Anttila
1989, 146-7). One of the best-known examples,
and object of study here, is the semantic chain
shift involving MEAT1 in the history of English.
The item used to mean ‘food of any kind’ in Me-
dieval English, but has acquired the more specific
meaning of ‘food from animal flesh’ in Modern
English (e.g., Bejan 2017, 82, and many other
textbooks, where the phenomenon is usually dis-
cussed as an instance of ‘semantic narrowing’).
This development is linked to a change in the
meaning of FOOD. It meant ‘anything required
to maintain life and growth’ in the Middle Ages,
as demonstrated, for instance, by ancient Latin-
English glosses, such as Thomas Elyot’s 1538
Dictionary (Stein 2014), where one reads, Alimen-
tum, alimonia - sustynaunce, fode, or livinge. The
word has come to denote ‘anything to eat’ at the
present. Likewise, the item FLESH has under-
gone a related semantic change from ‘soft body
tissue in any function’ in Old and Middle English
towards ‘soft body tissue, usually not for eating’ in
Present-Day English (for a discussion of the rela-
tion between FLESH and MEAT in terms of anal-
ogy, see Bloomfield 1933, 407-8, 440-2). Hence,
the innovative meanings of each item must have

1Items in all-caps signify abstract lexemes, both target and
context words, which can be realized by a large number of
specific spelling variants and inflectional forms.

encroached on and supplanted their counterpart’s
conservative semantics, resulting in the chain shift
FOOD > MEAT > FLESH.2

Table 1 paraphrases the semantics of the three
targets of the chain shift, the new meaning be-
ing at the top, the old at the bottom. It also
presents actual uses of the conservative and in-
novative variants from the 16th and 19th century,
respectively, in the form of KWIC concordances
with a search window size of 12 words to the left
and the right. The targets are shown in red, and
context words likely to signal the intended inter-
pretation in green.

Semantic chain shifts involve confounding fac-
tors such as archaism, fixed expressions, domain-
dependent technical uses, other genre effects,
creative extensions by metaphor and metonymy,
noise from polysemy and homonymy, and subtle
shifts in connotations. These difficulties impede
studying macro-trends in their semantic evolution
manually. However, it is possible to trace the de-
velopments with word embedding techniques (for
an overview, see e.g., Tahmasebi et al. 2018).

The present study employs Word2Vec models
(Mikolov et al., 2013) to investigate two ques-
tions about the FOOD>MEAT>FLESH chain.
(1) What is the general time course of the changes?
(2) Does the chain commence at the target FLESH
(pull chain) or FOOD (push chain)? Section 2
presents the data used in the study. Section 3
presents the findings. Section 4 concludes.

2Several reviewers pointed out that the argument of this
paper would be strengthened by the inclusion of additional in-
stances of semantic chain shifts. Time constraints prevented
a discussion of further examples. Other well-known cases of
semantic chain shifts are the development of tree names in
Ancient Greek, ASH > BEECH > OAK (e.g. Gamkrelidze
and Ivanov 1995, 537-8; Ancient Greek φᾱγóς ‘oak,’ cog-
nate with English beech), or the cycle of facial terms in Latin
and early Romance, MOUTH > CHIN > CHEEK > MOUTH
(e.g.Mallory and Adams 2006, chapter 11 ‘Anatomy’; French
menton ‘chin,’ cognate with English mouth). I leave an inves-
tigation of these or similar developments to future research.

2 Data and pre-processing

2.1 Corpora used

The data for this study comes from 4 historical
corpora, the Innsbruck Corpus of Middle English
Prose (Markus, 2010), EEBO3, ECCO4 and CL-
MET3.0 (Diller et al., 2011). It consists of a to-
tal of c. 845 million words or 4,7 GB of uncom-
pressed running text. The material was subdivided
into ten 50-year periods covering the time span
1425-1925. Table 2 summarizes the data basis.

2.2 Normalization

The greatest challenge to using the historical data
fruitfully lies in the great amount of spelling vari-
ation found in earlier English. Word embedding
techniques treat different orthographic forms of
identical lexemes as distinct items, which might
impair the quality of the models and hinder dia-
chronic comparisons (for a study highlighting the
importance of consistent pre-processing, see e.g.
Camacho-Collados and Pilehvar 2018).

Therefore, a large number of regular expres-
sions were run on the texts, improving spelling
coherence (a total of 830 replacements, e.g. reg-
ularizing v-u variability). Further, several lex-
emes were lemmatized5, including FOOD, MEAT,

5There are several attempts at standardizing spelling vari-
ation found in Early Modern English texts, including Vir-
tual Orthographic Standardization and Part Of Speech Tag-
ging (VosPos) (Mueller, 2006), VARiant Detector 2 (VARD2)
(Baron and Rayson, 2008) and MorphAdorner v2.0 (Burns,
2013). However, the time investment needed to implement
any of these systems would have been incommensurate with
the goals of this paper. Therefore, lemmatization targeted
only the most important items and not the entire vocabulary.

FLESH and most of their closest neighbors. The
Innsbruck and EEBO data was POS-tagged to aid
in this task (e.g. to distinguish wine vs. win, meat
vs. meet). Some word class distinctions could not
be maintained as a result (e.g. DRINK now refers
to the verb and the noun).

2.3 Training

Word embeddings were created for each of the
nine periods by training Word2Vec models on
their respective text material with Python’s Gen-
sim library (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010). A con-
tinuous bag of words architecture was chosen, the
words of interest being of reasonably high fre-
quency, with a vector size of 250, a context win-
dow size of 20, and a minimum count of 5.

3 Results

Figure 1 shows the cosine similarities between
FOOD-MEAT and MEAT-FLESH across the ten
time periods. The former two lexemes have be-
come increasingly more similar from the earliest
periods on. Their cosine rose from c. 0.4 in
1450 to c. 0.6 in 1700, where it has remained
stable since. In contrast, the latter two items
showed some relatedness, but remained quite dis-
tinct, throughout the earliest periods. Their cosine
then increased from c. 0.3 in 1600, peaking at c.
0.6 between 1700 and 1800, and diverged again to
c. 0.4 by 1900.

These findings are compatible with a push chain
interpretation: FOOD seems to have initiated
the changes by first becoming more similar to
MEAT. Only subsequently did MEAT associate
more closely with FLESH, which then began to
occupy a more distinct semantic niche.

The diachronic trajectories of the targets are vi-
sualized in Figure 2. It shows the nearest neigh-
bors of the target words over the time studied from
the semantic domains ‘sustenance’ (green), ‘eat-
ing’ (lime), ‘animal food’ (orange) and ‘human
skin’ (red). The words are arranged in a two-
dimensional principal component plot from the
last period. The previous time points were ho-
mogenized to it using a procrustes transformation.
This method is based on Li et al. (2019), which is
in turn inspired by Hamilton et al. (2016).6

6One reviewer remarked that the procrustes transforma-
tion must be performed on identical vocabularies for every
time period. This is indeed the case. The constant vocabulary
consists only of the words shown in Figure 2. Several words

The plot shows that FOOD dissociated from the
meaning ‘sustenance’ early on. This lead to a pe-
riod of sustained close synonymy between MEAT

and FLESH in the domain ‘eating.’ In fact, the two
lexemes are still strongly connected context words
of each other.

While FOOD is now well contained within
‘eating’ (EAT, MEAL etc.), MEAT is not dis-
tinctively associated with ‘animal food’ (BEEF,
ROAST etc.), but rather hovers between the two
domains. FLESH was fairly polysemous, cycling
around a number of different senses, like ‘animal
food’ (PORK, BROILED etc.) or ‘Christian doc-
trine’ (SIN, CHRIST), but has recently become
most closely associated with ‘human skin’ (SKIN,
SWEAT etc.).

Figure 3 contains similar information in quan-
titative, rather than graphical, form. It gives the
average closeness of a bag of distinctive context
words and the targets as a proxy for their conser-
vative and innovative interpretations.

FOOD consistently moves away from its old to-
wards its new meaning from 1450 on. It thus likely
triggered the semantic chain shift. In contrast, the
conservative senses of MEAT and FLESH are not
entirely lost, but rather fluctuate (witness archaic
expressions such as meat and drink or the flesh is
weak). Their modern meanings become frequent
from c. 1700 on. This development may hap-
pen somewhat earlier and faster for MEAT than
for FLESH. If so, this would suggests a secondary
push. Here, MEAT may have spread towards se-
mantic space previously held by FLESH, thereby
pushing it into a new domain.

4 Summary and outlook

The diachronic developments of the semantic
chain shift FOOD > MEAT > FLESH can suc-
cessfully be investigated with word embedding
methods. It was shown that the semantic change
of FOOD ‘anything for sustenance’ > ‘anything
for eating’ can be traced back at least to the middle
of the fifteenth century. The acquisition of the new
senses ‘anything for eating’ > ‘soft body tissue for
eating’ for MEAT and ‘soft body tissue for eat-
ing’ > ‘soft body tissue not for eating’ for FLESH
advanced in particular from c. 1700 on. Fur-
thermore, there is evidence to suggest that the se-
mantic change developed as a push chain. FOOD
approaches MEAT long before MEAT becomes
more closely associated with FLESH. Similarly,
MEAT may have encroached upon FLESH some-
what earlier than FLESH became disjoint from the
‘animal food’ domain.

A number of future research questions are
raised by the present study. First, the periodiza-
tion employed here is not fine-grained enough to
establish beyond reasonable doubt that MEAT be-
came specialized before FLESH. The second step
of the push chain scenario thus needs to be sub-
ject to closer scrutiny. Second, it is possible to
follow up the developments during the last cen-
tury from c. 1900 to 2000. The target items may
still be evolving. FLESH might lose its religious
connotations; MEAT could move towards a mean-
ing of ‘animal body tissue’ in general, FOOD is
perhaps getting ever more firmly entrenched in the
‘eating’ domain, etc. Finally, one could investi-
gate a curiously similar chain shift in the history
of French, NOURRITURE ‘food’ > VIANDE
‘meat’ > CHAIR ‘flesh’. It is conceivable that
FOOD first changed its meaning under the influ-
ence of French loans, such as nourishment or sus-
tenance. The exact relation between the French
and English developments merits closer examina-
tion.

It would also be a worthwhile endeavor to com-
pare the results obtained with Word2Vec to other
methods suitable for this task. One approach could
be to conduct an inter-annotator agreement exper-
iment, in which participants should use the avail-
able linguistic context to judge whether FOOD,
MEAT and FLESH are used in their innovative or
conservative senses in a sample of sentences from
every period. The resulting scores could also func-
tion as a gold standard for evaluating the good-
ness of the word embeddings. Another approach
could involve collocation measures such as point-
wise mutual information or possibly Collostruc-
tional Analysis (Stefanowitsch and Griess, 2003).

Several problematic aspects of this research re-
main. It is very difficult to find a set of context
words that remains relatively constant in mean-
ing over as great a time span as considered here.
The optimization of the non-modern periods’ di-
mensionality reduction on the modern coordinate
space thus becomes increasingly distorted, which
may account to some degree for the somewhat er-
ratic movements of the target words in Figure 2.
Even worse, some lexemes drop out of use alto-
gether. For example, potage ‘stew, dish made of a
thick liquid’ is an important context word of the
‘eating’ domain at the beginning of the change,
but becomes virtually non-existent towards the
later periods. Moreover, the corpus sizes of every



27

sub-period vary substantially. This may result in
higher-quality embeddings for those periods with
more, and poorer embeddings for those with less,
textual material. The similarity measurements of
the earliest periods of the change, in particular,
might be less reliable due to the limited amount of
training data. Similarly, the diverse nature of the
documents found in the corpora could be problem-
atic. Unbalanced distributions of certain text cate-
gories could bias the co-occurrences of target and
context words in a considerable way. For exam-
ple, two corpora might differ by chance in terms
of the frequency of religious sermons (associat-
ing, say, FLESH with LUST) or culinary recipes
(associating FLESH with PORK). Consequently,
the embeddings could have been influenced by a
random genre effect. Lastly, there are a few mi-
nor issues that have not been resolved satisfacto-
rily, such as language mixing in the training texts,
in particular with Latin, archaic uses of words in
citations, the unprincipled choice of training pa-
rameters, and the lack of an appropriate evaluation
metric for the task at hand.

Word embedding technologies have advanced
to a point where linguists can use them off the
shelf to obtain quantitative support for their qual-
itative assessments (e.g. Traugott and Dasher
2004) without a profound appreciation of the
mathematical complexities involved. In particular,
they can yield objective measurements and visu-
alizations of the general time course of semantic
changes and of the relative sequence of related se-
mantic changes in a chain shift. Yet, the greatest
advantage of word embeddings - abstracting over
large amounts of text data and their particularities
- is also a disadvantage. Linguists are often inter-
ested in specific aspects of a semantic change. Is
the change more likely to manifest in the writings
of a particular social class? Which genres pro-
mote or oppose the innovation? What is the role
of language contact or dialect? Word embeddings
cannot currently output relevant results to help an-
swer such intricate questions. Word embedding
methods can supplement but not supplant careful
linguistic studies on semantic change.
