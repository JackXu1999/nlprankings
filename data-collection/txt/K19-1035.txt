Abstract

Cross-lingual transfer learning has become an
important weapon to battle the unavailabil-
ity of annotated resources for low-resource
languages. One of the fundamental tech-
niques to transfer across languages is learn-
ing language-agnostic representations, in the
form of word embeddings or contextual en-
codings. In this work, we propose to lever-
age unannotated sentences from auxiliary lan-
guages to help learning language-agnostic rep-
resentations. Specifically, we explore adver-
sarial training for learning contextual encoders
that produce invariant representations across
languages to facilitate cross-lingual transfer.
We conduct experiments on cross-lingual de-
pendency parsing where we train a depen-
dency parser on a source language and trans-
fer it to a wide range of target languages. Ex-
periments on 28 target languages demonstrate
that adversarial training significantly improves
the overall transfer performances under several
different settings. We conduct a careful analy-
sis to evaluate the language-agnostic represen-
tations resulted from adversarial training.

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual transfer, where a model learned
from one language is transferred to another, has
become an important technique to improve the
quality and coverage of natural language process-
ing (NLP) tools for languages in the world. This
technique has been widely applied in many ap-
plications, including part-of-speech (POS) tagging
(Kim et al., 2017), dependency parsing (Ma and
Xia, 2014), named entity recognition (Xie et al.,
2018), entity linking (Sil et al., 2018), coreference
resolution (Kundu et al., 2018), and question an-
swering (Joty et al., 2017). Noteworthy improve-
ments are achieved on low resource language ap-
plications due to cross-lingual transfer learning.

In this paper, we study cross-lingual transfer for
dependency parsing. A dependency parser con-
sists of (1) an encoder that transforms an input text
sequence into latent representations and (2) a de-
coding algorithm that generates the corresponding
parse tree. In cross-lingual transfer, most recent
approaches assume that the inputs from different
languages are aligned into the same embedding
space via multilingual word embeddings or multi-
lingual contextualized word vectors, such that the
parser trained on a source language can be trans-
ferred to target languages. However, when train-
ing a parser on the source language, the encoder
not only learns to embed a sentence but it also car-
ries language-specific properties, such as word or-
der typology. Therefore, the parser suffers when it
is transferred to a language with different language
properties. Motivated by this, we study how to
train an encoder for generating language-agnostic
representations that can be transferred across a
wide variety of languages.

We propose to utilize unlabeled sentences of
one or more auxiliary languages to train an en-
coder that learns language-agnostic contextual
representations of sentences to facilitate cross-
lingual transfer. To utilize the unlabeled auxil-
iary language corpora, we adopt adversarial train-
ing (Goodfellow et al., 2014) of the encoder and
a classifier that predicts the language identity of
an input sentence from its encoded representation
produced by the encoder. The adversarial training
encourages the encoder to produce language in-
variant representations such that the language clas-
sifier fails to predict the correct language identity.
As the encoder is jointly trained with a loss for the
primary task on the source language and adversar-
ial loss on all languages, we hypothesize that it
will learn to capture task-specific features as well
as generic structural patterns applicable to many
languages, and thus have better transferrability.



373

To verify the proposed approach, we conduct
experiments on neural dependency parsers trained
on English (source language) and directly trans-
fer them to 28 target languages, with or without
the assistance of unlabeled data from auxiliary lan-
guages. We chose dependency parsing as the pri-
mary task since it is one of the core NLP appli-
cations and the development of Universal Depen-
dencies (Nivre et al., 2016) provides consistent an-
notations across languages, allowing us to investi-
gate transfer learning in a wide range of languages.
Thorough experiments and analyses are conducted
to address the following research questions:

• Does encoder trained with adversarial train-
ing generate language-agnostic representa-
tions?
• Does language-agnostic representations im-

prove cross-language transfer?

Experimental results show that the proposed ap-
proach consistently outperform a strong baseline
parser (Ahmad et al., 2019), with a significant
margin in two family of languages. In addition,
we conduct experiments to consolidate our find-
ings with different types of input representations
and encoders. Our experiment code is publicly
available to facilitate future research.1

2 Training Language-agnostic Encoders

We train the encoder of a dependency parser in
an adversarial fashion to guide it to avoid captur-
ing language-specific information. In particular,
we introduce a language identification task where
a classifier predicts the language identity (id) of
an input sentence from its encoded representation.
Then the encoder is trained such that the classifier
fails to predict the language id while the parser de-
coder predicts the parse tree accurately from the
encoded representation. We hypothesize that such
an encoder would have better cross-lingual trans-
ferability. The overall architecture of our model is
illustrated in Figure 1. In the following, we present
the details of the model and training method.

2.1 Architecture

Our model consists of three basic components, (1)
a general encoder, (2) a decoder for parsing, and
(3) a classifier for language identification. The en-
coder learns to generate contextualized represen-
tations for the input sentence (a word sequence)

Figure 1: An overview of our experimental model con-
sists of three basic components: (1) Encoder, (2) (Pars-
ing) Decoder, and (3) (Language) Classifier. We also
show how parsing and adversarial losses (Lp and Ld)
are back propagated for parameter updates.

which are fed to the decoder and the classifier to
predict the dependency structure and the language
identity (id) of that sentence.

The encoder and the decoder jointly form the
parsing model and we consider two alternatives2

from (Ahmad et al., 2019): “SelfAtt-Graph” and
“RNN-Stack”. The “SelfAtt-Graph” parser con-
sists of a modified self-attentional encoder (Shaw
et al., 2018) and a graph-based deep bi-affine
decoder (Dozat and Manning, 2017), while the
“RNN-Stack” parser is composed of a Recur-
rent Neural Network (RNN) based encoder and a
stack-pointer decoder (Ma et al., 2018).

We stack a classifier (a linear classifier or a
multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)) on top of the en-
coder to perform the language identification task.
The identification task can be framed as either a
word- or sentence-level classification task. For
the sentence-level classification, we apply average
pooling3 on the contextual word representations
generated by the encoder to form a fixed-length
representation of the input sequence, which is fed
to the classifier. For the word-level classification,
we perform language classification for each token
individually.

2Ahmad et al. (2019) studied order-sensitive and order-free
models and their performances in cross-lingual transfer. In
this work, we adopt two typical ones and study the effects of
adversarial training on them.

3We also experimented with max-pooling and weighted pool-
ing but average pooling resulted in stable performance.

In this work, following the terminology in ad-
versarial learning literature, we interchangeably
call the encoder as the generator, G and the classi-
fier as the discriminator, D.

2.2 Training

Algorithm 1 describes the training procedure. We
have two types of loss functions: Lp for the pars-
ing task and Ld for the language identification
task. For the former, we update the encoder and
the decoder as in the regular training of a parser.
For the latter, we adopt adversarial training to up-
date the encoder and the classifier. We present the
detailed training schemes in the following.

2.2.1 Parsing
To train the parser, we adopt both cross-entropy
objectives for these two types of parsers as in
(Dozat and Manning, 2017; Ma et al., 2018). The
encoder and the decoder are jointly trained to op-
timize the probability of the dependency trees (y)
given sentences (x):

Lp = − log p(y|x).
The probability of a tree can be further factor-
ized into the products of the probabilities of each
token’s (m) head decision (h(m)) for the graph-

based parser, or the probabilities of each transition
step decision (ti) for the transition-based parser:

Graph: Lp = −
∑

m
log p(h(m)|x,m),

Transition: Lp = −
∑

i
log p(ti|x, t<i).

2.2.2 Language Identification
Our objective is to train the contextual encoder
in a dependency parsing model such that it en-
codes language specific features as little as pos-
sible, which may help cross-lingual transfer. To
achieve our goal, we utilize adversarial training by
employing unlabeled auxiliary language corpora.

Setup We adopt the basic generative adversarial
network (GAN) for the adversarial training. We
assume that Xa and Xb be the corpora of the
source and auxiliary language sentences, respec-
tively. The discriminator acts as a binary classifier
and is adopted to distinguish the source and auxil-
iary languages. For the training of the discrimina-
tor, weights are updated according to the original
classification loss:

Ld = Ex∼Xa [log D(G(x)]+
Ex∼Xb [log (1−D(G(x))].

For the training of dependency parsing, the gen-
erator,G collaborates with the parser but acts as an
adversary with respect to the discriminator. There-
fore, the generator weights (θg) are updated by
minimizing the loss function,

L = Lp − λLd,
where λ is used to scale the discriminator loss
(Ld). In this way, the generator is guided to build
language-agnostic representations in order to fool
the discriminator while being helpful for the pars-
ing task. Meanwhile, the parser can be guided to
rely more on the language-agnostic features.

Alternatives We also consider two alternative
techniques for the adversarial training: Gradient
Reversal (GR) (Ganin et al., 2016) and Wasser-
stein GAN (WGAN) (Arjovsky et al., 2017). As
opposed to GAN based training, in GR setup, the
discriminator acts as a multiclass classifier that
predicts language identity of the input sentence,
and we use multi-class cross-entropy loss. We also
study Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), which is pro-
posed by Arjovsky et al. (2017) to improve the sta-
bility of GAN based learning. Its loss function is
shown as follows.

Ld = Ex∼Xa [D(G(x)]− Ex∼Xb [D(G(x)],

3 Experiments and Analysis

In this section, we discuss our experiments
and analysis on cross-lingual dependency parsing
transfer from a variety of perspectives and show
the advantages of adversarial training.

Settings. In our experiments, we study single-
source parsing transfer, where a parsing model is
trained on one source language and directly ap-
plied to the target languages. We conduct experi-
ments on the Universal Dependencies (UD) Tree-
banks (v2.2) (Nivre et al., 2018) using 29 lan-
guages, as shown in Table 1. We use the publicly
available implementation4 of the “SelfAtt-Graph”
and “RNN-Stack” parsers.5 Ahmad et al. (2019)
show that the “SelfAtt-Graph” parser captures less
language-specific information and performs bet-
ter than the ‘RNN-Stack” parser for distant tar-
get languages. Therefore, we use the “SelfAtt-
Graph” parser in most of our experiments. Be-
sides, the multilingual variant of BERT (mBERT)
(Devlin et al., 2019) has shown to perform well
in cross-lingual tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019) and
outperform the models trained on multilingual
word embeddings by a large margin. Therefore,
we consider conducting experiments with both
multilingual word embeddings and mBERT. We
use aligned multilingual word embeddings (Smith

5We adopt the same hyper-parameters, experiment settings
and evaluation metrics as those in (Ahmad et al., 2019).

et al., 2017; Bojanowski et al., 2017) with 300 di-
mensionss or contextualized word representations
provided by multilingual BERT6 (Devlin et al.,
2019) with 768 dimensions as the word represen-
tations. In addition, we use the Gold universal
POS tags to form the input representations.7 We
freeze the word representations during training to
avoid the risk of disarranging the multilingual rep-
resentation alignments.

We select six auxiliary languages8 (French, Por-
tuguese, Spanish, Russian, German, and Latin) for
unsupervised language adaptation via adversarial
training. We tune the scaling parameter λ in the
range of [0.1, 0.01, 0.001] on the source language
validation set and report the test performance with
the best value. For gradient reversal (GR) and
GAN based adversarial objectives, we use Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2015) to optimize the discrim-
inator parameters, and for WGAN, we use RM-
SProp (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012). The learning
rate is set to 0.001 and 0.00005 for Adam and RM-
SProp, respectively. We train the parsing models
for 400 and 500 epochs with multilingual BERT
and multilingual word embeddings respectively.
We tune the parameter I (as shown in Algorithm
1) in the range of [50, 100, 150].

Language Test. The goal of training the con-
textual encoder adversarially with unlabeled data
from auxiliary languages is to encourage the en-
coder to capture more language-agnostic represen-
tations and less language-dependent features. To
test whether the contextual encoders retain lan-
guage information after adversarial training, we
train a multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with softmax
on top of the fixed contextual encoders to perform
a 7-way classification task.9 If a contextual en-
coder performs better in the language test, it in-
dicates that the encoder retains language specific
information.

(en-fr) and (en-ru) denotes the source-auxiliary language pairs. ‘†’ indicates that the adversarially trained model
results are statistically significantly better (by permutation test, p< 0.05) than the model trained only on the source
language (en). Results show that the utilization of unlabeled auxiliary language corpora improves cross-lingual
transfer performance significantly.

sults demonstrate that the adversarial training with
the auxiliary language identification task benefits
cross-lingual transfer with a small performance
drop on the source language. When multi-lingual
embedding is employed, the performance signifi-
cantly improves, in terms of UAS of 0.48 and 0.61
over the 29 languages when French and Russian
are used as the auxiliary language, respectively.
When richer multilingual representation technique
like mBERT is employed, adversarial training can
still improve cross-lingual transfer performances
(0.21 and 0.54 UAS over the 29 languages by us-
ing French and Russian, respectively).

Next, we apply adversarial training on the
“RNN-Stack” parser and show the results in Ta-
ble 3. Similar to the “SelfAtt-Graph”parser, the
“RNN-Stack” parser resulted in significant im-
provements in cross-lingual transfer from unsu-

pervised language adaptation. We discuss our de-
tailed experimental analysis in the following.

3.1.1 Impact of Adversarial Training
To understand the impact of different adversar-
ial training types and objectives, we apply adver-
sarial training on both word- and sentence-level
with gradient reversal (GR), GAN, and WGAN
objectives. We provide the average cross-lingual
transfer performances in Table 4 for different ad-
versarial training setups. Among the adversar-
ial training objectives, we observe that in most
cases, the GAN objective results in better per-
formances than the GR and WGAN objectives.
Our finding is in contrast to Adel et al. (2018)
where GR was reported to be the better objective.
To further investigate, we perform the language
test on the encoders trained via these two objec-
tives. We find that the GR-based trained encoders



377

perform consistently better than the GAN based
ones on the language identification task, show-
ing that via GAN-based training, the encoders be-
come more language-agnostic. In a comparison
between GAN and WGAN, we notice that GAN-
based training consistently performs better.

Comparing word- and sentence-level adversar-
ial training, we observe that predicting language
identity at the word-level is slightly more use-
ful for the “SelfAtt-Graph” model, while the
sentence-level adversarial training results in better
performances for the “RNN-Stack” model. There
is no clear dominant strategy.

In addition, we study the effect of using a lin-
ear classifier or a multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) as
the discriminator and find that the interaction be-
tween the encoder and the linear classifier resulted
in improvements.10

3.1.2 Adversarial v.s. Multi-task Training
In section 3.1.1, we study the effect of learning
language-agnostic representation by using auxil-
iary language with adversarial training. An al-
ternative way to leverage auxiliary language cor-
pora is by encoding language-specific information
in the representation via multi-task learning. In
the multi-task learning (MTL) setup, the model
observes the same amount of data (both labeled
and unlabeled) as the adversarially trained (AT)
model. The only difference between the MTL and
AT models is that in the MTL models, the contex-
tual encoders are encouraged to capture language-
dependent features while in the AT models, they
are trained to encode language-agnostic features.

The experiment results using multi-task learn-
ing in comparison with the adversarial training are
presented in Table 5. Interestingly, although the
MTL objective sounds contradiction to adversar-
ial learning, it has a positive effect on the cross-
lingual parsing, as the representations are learned
with certain additional information from new (un-

Therefore, we perform language test with the

MTL and AT (GAN based) encoders, and the re-
sults are shown in Table 5, Columns 6–7. The re-
sults indicate that the MTL encoders consistently
perform better than the AT encoders, which veri-
fies our hypothesis that adversarial training moti-
vates the contextual encoders to encode language-
agnostic features.

To analyze the effects of the auxiliary languages
in cross-language transfer via adversarial train-
ing, we perform experiments by pairing up11 the

we concatenate the corpora of multiple languages and treat
them as one auxiliary language. In these set of experiments,

and Latin language families) as the auxiliary lan-
guage. The average cross-lingual transfer perfor-
mances are presented in Table 6 and the results
suggest that Russian (ru) and German (de) are bet-
ter candidates for auxiliary languages.

We then dive deeper into the effects of auxil-
iary languages trying to understand whether aux-
iliary languages particularly benefit target lan-
guages that are closer to them12 or from the same
family. Intuitively, we would assume when the
auxiliary language has a smaller average distance
to all the target languages, the cross-lingual trans-
fer performance would be better. However, from
the results in Table 6, we do not see such a pattern.
For example, Portuguese (pt) has the smallest av-
erage distance to other languages among the aux-

iliary languages we tested, but it is not among the
better auxiliary languages.

We further zoom in the cross-lingual trans-
fer improvements for each language families as
shown in Table 7. We hypothesis that the auxil-
iary languages to be more helpful for the target
languages in the same family. The experimen-
tal results moderately correlate with our expecta-
tion. Specifically, the Germanic family benefits
the most from employing German (de) as the aux-
iliary language; similarly Slavic family with Rus-
sian (ru) as the auxiliary language (although Ger-
man as the auxiliary language brings similar im-
provements). The Romance family is an exception
because it benefits the least from using French (fr)
as the auxiliary language. This may due to the fact
that French is too closed to English, thus is less
suitable to be used as an auxiliary language.

transferred to the target languages. In this work,
we relax the setting by allowing unlabeled data
from one or more auxiliary (helper) languages
other than the source language. This setting has
been explored in a few prior works. Cohen et al.
(2011) learn a generative target language parser
with unannotated target data as a linear interpo-
lation of the source language parsers. Täckström
et al. (2013) adopt unlabeled target language data
and a learning method that can incorporate di-
verse knowledge sources through ambiguous la-
beling for transfer parsing. In comparison, we
leverage unlabeled auxiliary language data to learn
language-agnostic contextual representations to
improve cross-lingual transfer.

Multilingual Representation Learning. The
basic of the unsupervised cross-lingual parsing is
that we can align the representations of differ-
ent languages into the same space, at least at the
word level. The recent development of bilingual
or multilingual word embeddings provide us with
such shared representations. We refer the readers

to the surveys of Ruder et al. (2017) and Glavaš
et al. (2019) for details. The main idea is that
we can train a model on top of the source lan-
guage embeddings which are aligned to the same
space as the target language embeddings and thus
all the model parameters can be directly shared
across languages. During transfer to a target lan-
guage, we simply replace the source language em-
beddings with the target language embeddings.
This idea is further extended to learn multilin-
gual contextualized word representations, for ex-
ample, multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019),
have been shown very effective for many cross-
lingual transfer tasks (Wu and Dredze, 2019). In
this work, we show that further improvements can
be achieved by adaptating the contextual encoders
via unlabeled auxiliary languages even when the
encoders are trained on top of multilingual BERT.

Adversarial Training. The concept of adversar-
ial training via Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al.,
2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) was initially in-
troduced in computer vision for image classifica-
tion and received enormous success in improving
model’s robustness on input images with pertur-
bations. Later many variants of GANs (Arjovsky
et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017) were proposed
to improve its’ training stability. In NLP, adver-
sarial training was first utilized for domain adap-
tation (Ganin et al., 2016). Since then adversarial
training has started to receive an increasing inter-
est in the NLP community and applied to many
NLP applications including part-of-speech (POS)
tagging (Gui et al., 2017; Yasunaga et al., 2018),
dependency parsing (Sato et al., 2017), relation ex-
traction (Wu et al., 2017), text classification (Miy-
ato et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Chen and Cardie,
2018), dialogue generation (Li et al., 2017).

In the context of cross-lingual NLP tasks, many
recent works adopted adversarial training, such
as in sequence tagging (Adel et al., 2018), text
classification (Xu and Yang, 2017; Chen et al.,
2018), word embedding induction (Zhang et al.,
2017; Lample et al., 2018), relation classification
(Zou et al., 2018), opinion mining (Wang and Pan,
2018), and question-question similarity reranking
(Joty et al., 2017). However, existing approaches
only consider using the target language as the aux-
iliary language. It is unclear whether the lan-
guage invariant representations learned by previ-
ously proposed methods can perform well on a

wide variety of unseen languages. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to study the effects
of language-agnostic representations on a broad
spectrum of languages.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we study learning language invari-
ant contextual encoders for cross-lingual trans-
fer. Specifically, we leverage unlabeled sentences
from auxiliary languages and adversarial training
to induce language-agnostic encoders to improve
the performances of the cross-lingual dependency
parsing. Experiments and analysis using English
as the source language and six foreign languages
as the auxiliary languages not only show improve-
ments on cross-lingual dependency parsing, but
also demonstrates that contextual encoders suc-
cessfully learns not to capture language-dependent
features through adversarial training. In the future,
we plan to investigate the effectiveness of adver-
sarial training for multi-source transfer to parsing
and other cross-lingual NLP applications.
