Abstract

We propose weakly supervised language lo-
calization networks (WSLLN) to detect events
in long, untrimmed videos given language
queries. To learn the correspondence between
visual segments and texts, most previous
methods require temporal coordinates (start
and end times) of events for training, which
leads to high costs of annotation. WSLLN re-
lieves the annotation burden by training with
only video-sentence pairs without accessing
to temporal locations of events. With a sim-
ple end-to-end structure, WSLLN measures
segment-text consistency and conducts seg-
ment selection (conditioned on the text) simul-
taneously. Results from both are merged and
optimized as a video-sentence matching prob-
lem. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and
DiDeMo demonstrate that WSLLN achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

1 Introduction

Extensive work has been done on temporal ac-
tion/activity localization (Shou et al., 2016; Zhao
et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2017; Buch et al., 2017;
Gao et al., 2017c; Chao et al., 2018), where an ac-
tion of interest is segmented from long, untrimmed
videos. These methods only identify actions from
a pre-defined set of categories, which limits their
application to situations where only unconstrained
language descriptions are available. This more
general problem is referred to as natural language
localization (NLL) (Hendricks et al., 2017; Gao
et al., 2017a). The goal is to retrieve a temporal
segment from an untrimmed video based on an ar-
bitrary text query. Recent work focuses on learn-
ing the mapping from visual segments to the input
text (Hendricks et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017a; Liu
et al., 2018; Hendricks et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,

2018) and retrieving segments based on the align-
ment scores. However, in order to successfully
train a NLL model, a large number of diverse lan-
guage descriptions are needed to describe differ-
ent temporal segments of videos which incurs high
human labeling cost.

We propose Weakly Supervised Language Lo-
calization Networks (WSLLN) which requires
only video-sentence pairs during training with no
information of where the activities temporally oc-
cur. Intuitively, it is much easier to annotate video-
level descriptions than segment-level descriptions.
Moreover, when combined with text-based video
retrieval techniques, video-sentence pairs may be
obtained with minimum human intervention. The
proposed model is simple and clean, and can be
trained end-to-end in a single stage. We validate
our model on ActivityNet Captions and DiDeMo.
The results show that our model achieves the state-
of-the-art of the weakly supervised approach and
has comparable performance as some supervised
approaches.

2 Related Work

Temporal Action Localization in long videos is
widely studied in both offline and online scenar-
ios. In the offline setting, temporal action detec-
tors (Shou et al., 2016; Buch et al., 2017; Gao
et al., 2017c; Chao et al., 2018) predict the start
and end times of actions after observing the whole
video, while online approaches (De Geest et al.,
2016; Gao et al., 2017b; Shou et al., 2018b; Xu
et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019) label action class in a
per-frame manner without accessing future infor-
mation. The goal of temporal action detectors is
to localize actions in pre-defined categories. How-
ever, activities in the wild is very complicated and
it is challenging to cover all the activities of inter-
est by using a finite set of categories.

Natural Language Localization in untrimmed
videos was first introduced in (Gao et al., 2017a;
Hendricks et al., 2017), where given an arbitrary
text query, the methods attempt to localize the text
(predict its start and end times) in a video. Hen-
dricks et al. proposed MCN (Hendricks et al.,
2017) which embeds the features of visual propos-
als and sentence representations in the same space
and ranks proposals according their similarity with
the sentence. Gao et al. proposed CTRL (Gao
et al., 2017a), where alignment and regression are
conducted for clip candidates. Liu et al. intro-
duced TMN (Liu et al., 2018) which measures
the clip-sentence alignment guided by the seman-
tic structure of the text query. Later, Hendricks
et al. proposed MLLC (Hendricks et al., 2018)
that explicitly reasons about temporal clips of a
video. Zhang et al. proposed MAN (Zhang et al.,
2018) which utilizes Graph Convolutional Net-
works (Kipf and Welling, 2016) to model tempo-
ral relations among visual clips. Although these
methods achieve considerable success, they need
segment-level annotations for training. Duan et
al. proposed WSDEC to handle weakly super-
vised dense event captioning in (Duan et al., 2018)
by alternating between language localization and
caption generation iteratively. WSDEC generates
language localization as intermediate results and
can be trained using video-level labels. Thus, we
set it as a baseline, although it is not designed for
NLL.

Weakly Supervised Localization has been stud-
ied extensively to use weak supervisions for ob-
ject detection on images and action localization
in videos (Oquab et al., 2015; Bilen and Vedaldi,
2016; Tang et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018; Kantorov
et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Jie et al., 2017; Diba
et al., 2017; Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Duchenne
et al., 2009; Laptev et al., 2008; Bojanowski et al.,
2014; Huang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Shou
et al., 2018a). Some methods use class labels to
train object detectors. Oquab et al. discussed
that object locations may be freely obtained when
training classification models (Oquab et al., 2015).
Bilen et al. proposed WSDDN (Bilen and Vedaldi,
2016), which focuses on both object recognition
and localization. Their proposed two-stream ar-
chitecture inspired several weakly supervised ap-
proaches (Tang et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2017) including our method. Li et
al. presented an adaptation strategy in (Li et al.,

2016) which uses the output of a weak detec-
tor as pseudo groundtruth to train a detector in a
fully supervised way. OICR (Tang et al., 2017)
integrates multiple instance learning and iterative
classifer refinement in a single network. Some
works use other types of weak supervisions to op-
timize detectors. In (Papadopoulos et al., 2017),
Papadopoulos et al. used clicks to train detectors.
Gao et al. utilized object counts for weakly super-
vised object detection (Gao et al., 2018). Instead
of using temporally labeled segments, weakly su-
pervised action detectors use weaker annotations,
e.g., movie script (Duchenne et al., 2009; Laptev
et al., 2008), the order of the occurring action
classes in videos (Bojanowski et al., 2014; Huang
et al., 2016) and video-level class labels (Wang
et al., 2017; Shou et al., 2018a).

3 Weakly Supervised Language
Localization Networks (WSLLN)

3.1 Problem Statement

Following the setting of its strongly supervised
counterpart (Gao et al., 2017a; Hendricks et al.,
2017), the goal of a weakly supervised language
localization (WSLL) method is to localize the
event that is described by a sentence query in a
long, untrimmed video. Formally, given a video
consisting of a sequence of image frames, Vi =
[I1i , I

2
i , ..., I

T
i ], and a text query Qi, the model

aims to localize a temporal segment, [Isti , ..., I
ed
i ],

which semantically aligns best with the query.
st and ed indicate the start and end times, re-
spectively. The difference is that WSLL methods
only utilize video-sentence pairs, {Vi, Qi}Ni=1, for
training, while supervised approaches have access
to the start and end times of the queries.

3.2 The Proposed Approach

Taking frame sequences, [I1i , I
2
i , ..., I

T
i ], as in-

puts, the model first generates a set of temporal
proposals, {p1i , p2i , ..., pni }, where p

j
i consists of

temporally-continuous image frames. Then, the
method aligns the proposals with the input query
and outputs scores for proposals, {s1i , s2i , ..., sni },
indicating their likelihood of containing the event.
Feature Description. Given a sentence query Qi
of arbitrary length, sentence encoders can be used
to extract text feature, fqi, from the query. For
a video, Vi = [I1i , I2i , ..., ITi ], features, fvi =
[fv1i , fv

2
i , ..., fv

T
i ], are extracted from each frame.

Following (Hendricks et al., 2017), the visual fea-

Figure 1: The workflow of our method. Visual and text features are extracted from n video proposals and the input
sentence. Fully-connected (FC) layers are used to transform the features to the same length, d. The two features
are combined by multi-modal processing (Gao et al., 2017a) and input to the two-branch structure. Scores from
both parts are merged. Video-level scores, vq, are obtained by summing s over proposals. The whole pipeline is
trained end-to-end using video-level and pseudo segment-level labels. x× z indicates dimensions.

ture, fpji , of a proposal p
j
i is obtained using Eq. 1,

where pool(x, t1, t2) means average pooling fea-
tures x from time t1 to t2, || indicates concatena-
tion, jst/jed indicates start/end times of the pro-
posal and j̄ means time is normalized to [0, 1].

pool(fvi, jst, jed)||pool(fvi, 0, T )||[j̄st, j̄ed] (1)

We see that the feature of each proposal con-
tains the information of its visual pattern, the over-
all context and its relative position in the video.

Following (Gao et al., 2017a), features of the
sentence and a visual proposal are combined as in
Eq. 2. The feature, fm, will be used to measure
the matching between a candidate proposal and the
input query.

fm = (fp+ fq)||(fp · fq)||FC(fp||fq) (2)

The workflow of WSLLN is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Inspired by the success of the two-stream struc-
ture in the weakly supervised object and action
detection tasks (Bilen and Vedaldi, 2016; Wang
et al., 2017), WSLLN consists of two branches,
i.e., alignment branch and selection branch. The
semantic consistency between the input text and
each visual proposal is measured in the align-
ment branch. The proposals are compared and se-
lected in the detection branch. Scores from both
branches are merged to produce the final results.
Alignment Branch produces the consistency
scores, sai ∈ Rn×2 = [sa1i , sa2i , ..., sani ], for pro-
posals of the video-sentence pair. sai in Eq. 3,
measures how well each proposal matches the text.

Different proposal scores are calculated indepen-
dently where softmaxa indicates applying the
softmax function over the last dimension.

sai = softmaxa(Wafmi) (3)

Detection Branch performs proposal selec-
tion. The selection score, sdi ∈ Rn×2 =
[sd1i , sd

2
i , ..., sd

n
i ] in Eq. 4, is obtained by applying

softmax function over proposals. Through soft-
max, the score of a proposal will be affected by
those of other proposals, so this operation encour-
ages competition among segments.

sdi = softmaxd(Wdfmi) (4)

Score Merging is applied to both parts to obtain
the results by dot production, i.e., si = sai·sdi, for
proposals. si is used as the final segment-sentence
matching scores during inference.
Training Phase. To utilize video-sentence pairs
as supervision, our model is optimized as a video-
sentence matching classifier. We compute the
matching score of a given video-sentence pair
by summing sji over proposals, vqi =

∑n
j=1 s

j
i .

Then, Lv is obtained in Eq. 5 by measuring the
score with the video-sentence match label li ∈
{0, 1}. Positive video-sentence pairs can be ob-
tained directly. We generate negative ones by pair-
ing each video with a randomly selected sentence
in the training set. We ensure that the positive pairs
are not included in the negative set.

Lv = loss(vqi, li) (5)



1484

Results can be further refined by adding an aux-
iliary task Lr in Eq. 6 where ŷi = {0, 1, ..., n −
1} indicates the index of the segment that best
matches the sentence during training. The
real segment-level labels are not available, thus
we generate pseudo labels by setting ŷi =
argmaxjs

j
i [:, 1]. This loss further encourages

competition among proposals.

Lr = loss(s
j
i , ŷi) (6)

The overall objective is minimizing L in Eq. 7,
where λ is a balancing scalar. loss is cross-
entropy loss.

L = loss(vqi, li) + λloss(s
j
i , ŷi). (7)

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Settings

Implementation Details. BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018) is used as the sentence encoder, where the
feature of ‘[CLS]’ at the last layer is extracted as
the sentence representation. Visual and sentence
features are linearly transformed to have the same
dimension, d = 1000. The hidden layers for both
branches have 256 units. For ActivityNet Cap-
tions, we take the n = 15 proposals over multi-
ple scales of each video provided by (Duan et al.,
2018) and use the C3D (Tran et al., 2015) features
provided by (Krishna et al., 2017). For DiDeMo,
we use the n = 21 proposals and VGG (Simonyan
and Zisserman, 2014) features (RGB and Flow)
provided in (Hendricks et al., 2017).
Evaluation Metrics. Following (Gao et al.,
2017a; Hendricks et al., 2017), R@k,IoU=th and
mIoU are used for evaluation. Proposals are
ranked according to their matching scores with
the input sentence. If the temporal IoU be-
tween at least one of the top-k proposals and the
groundtruth is bigger or equal to th, the sentence is
counted as matched. R@k,IoU=th means the per-
centage of matched sentences over the total sen-
tences given k and th. mIoU is the mean IoU be-
tween the top-1 proposal and the groundtruth.

4.2 Experiments on ActivityNet Captions

Dataset Description. ActivityNet Captions (Kr-
ishna et al., 2017) is a large-scale dataset of human
activities. It contains 20k videos including 100k
video-sentences in total. We train our models on
the training set and test them on the validation set.

Table 2: R@1 results of our method on ActivityNet
Captions when λ in Eq. 7 is set to be different values.

Although the dataset provides segment-level an-
notation, we only use video-sentence pairs during
training.
Baselines. We compare with strongly super-
vised approaches, i.e., CTRL (Gao et al., 2017a),
ABLR (Yuan et al., 2018) and WSDEC-S (Duan
et al., 2018) to see how much accuracy it sac-
rifices when using only weak labels. Originally
proposed for dense-captioning, WSDEC-W (Duan
et al., 2018) achieves state-of-the-art performance
for weakly supervised language localization. Al-
though showing good performance, WSDEC-W
involves complicated training stages, and alter-
nates between sentence localization and caption
generation for iterations.

4.2.1 Comparison Results

Comparison results are displayed in Tab. 1. It
shows that WSLLN largely outperforms WSDEC-
W by ∼4% mIoU . When comparing with
strongly supervised methods, WSLLN outper-
forms CTRL by over 11% mIoU . Using the
R@1, IoU = 0.1 metric, our model largely out-
performs all the baselines including strongly and
weakly supervised methods which means that
when a scenario is flexible with the IoU cover-
age, our method has great advantage over oth-
ers. When th =0.3/0.5, our model has compara-
ble results as WSDEC-W and largely outperforms
CTRL. The overall results demonstrate good per-
formance of WSLLN, even though there is still a
big gap between weakly supervised methods and



1485

some supervised ones, i.e., ABLR and WSDEC-
S. mIoU (mean±std) of WSLLN across 3 runs is
32.2± 0.05 which demonstrates the robustness of
our method.

4.2.2 Ablation Study
Effect of λ. We evaluate the effect of λ (see Eq. 7)
in Tab. 2. As it shows, our model performs stable
when λ is set from 0.1 to 0.4. When λ = 0, the
refining module is disabled and the performance
drops. When λ is set to a big number, e.g., 0.5,
the contribution of Lv is reduced and the model
performance also drops.
Effect of Sentence Encoder. WSDEC-W uses
GRU (Cho et al., 2014) as its sentence encoder,
while our method uses BERT. It seems an unfair
comparison, since BERT is powerful than GRU
in general. However, we uses pretrained BERT
model without fine tuning on our dataset, while
WSDEC-W uses GRU but performed an end-to-
end training. So, it is unclear which setting is bet-
ter. To resolve this concern, we replace our BERT
with GRU following WSDEC-W. TheR@1 results
when IoU is set to be 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 are 74.0,
42.3 and 22.5, respectively. The mIoU is 31.8. It
shows that our model with GRU has comparable
results as that with BERT.
Effect of Two-branch Design. We create two
baselines, ie, Align-only and Detect-only, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. To
perform fair comparison, both of them are trained
using only video-sentence pairs.

Align-only contains only the alignment branch.
For positive video sentence pair, we give positive
labels to all proposals. Negative pairs have neg-
ative labels for all the proposals. Loss is calcu-
lated between proposal scores and the generated
segment-level labels.

Detect-only contains only the detection branch.
Loss is calculated using the highest detection score
over proposals and the video-level label at each
training iteration.

Comparison results are displayed in Tab. 3.
It shows that the two baselines underperform
WSLLN by a large margin, which demonstrates
the effectiveness of our design.

4.3 Experiments on DiDeMo

Dataset Description. DiDeMo was proposed
in (Hendricks et al., 2017) for the language lo-
calization task. It contains 10k, 30-second videos
including 40k annotated segment-sentence pairs.

Model IoU=0.1 IoU=0.3 IoU=0.5 mIoU
Align-only 40.0 18.9 7.5 13.4
Detect-only 33.7 18.3 10.4 13.6

Table 3: Ablation study based on R@1 on ActivityNet
Captions. Both methods are trained using weak super-
visions.

Table 4: Comparison results on DiDeMo. Following
MCN, we set th = 1.0 for the IoU threshold. All
baseline numbers are reprinted from (Hendricks et al.,
2017). WS: weakly supervised.

Our models are trained using video-sentence pairs
in the train set and tested on the test set.
Baselines. To the best of our knowledge, no
weakly supervised method has been evaluated on
DiDeMo. So, we compare with some supervised
methods, i.e., MCN (Hendricks et al., 2017) and
LOR (Hu et al., 2016). MCN is a supervised NLL
model. LOR is a supervised language-object re-
trieval model. It utilizes much more expensive
(object-level) annotations for training. We follow
the same setup of LOR as in (Hendricks et al.,
2017) to evaluate LOR for our task.
Comparison Results are shown in Tab. 4.
WSLLN performs better than LOR in terms of
R@1/5. We also observe that the gap between our
method and the supervised NLL model is much
larger on DiDeMo than on ActivityNet Captions.
This may be due to the fact that DiDeMo is a much
smaller dataset which is a disadvantage for weakly
supervised learning.

5 Conclusion

We propose WSLLN– a simple language localiza-
tion network. Unlike most existing methods which
require segment-level supervision, our method is
optimized using video-sentence pairs. WSLLN
is based on a two-branch architecture where one
branch performs segment-sentence alignment and
the other one conducts segment selection. Exper-
iments show that WSLLN achieves promising re-
sults on ActivityNet Captions and DiDeMo.
