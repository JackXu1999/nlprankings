Abstract

This year, the Nara Institute of Science
and Technology (NAIST)’s submission to
the 2015 Workshop on Asian Translation
was based on syntax-based statistical ma-
chine translation, with the addition of a
reranking component using neural atten-
tional machine translation models. Exper-
iments re-confirmed results from previous
work stating that neural MT reranking pro-
vides a large gain in objective evaluation
measures such as BLEU, and also con-
firmed for the first time that these results
also carry over to manual evaluation. We
further perform a detailed analysis of rea-
sons for this increase, finding that the main
contributions of the neural models lie in
improvement of the grammatical correct-
ness of the output, as opposed to improve-
ments in lexical choice of content words.

1 Introduction

Neural network models for machine transla-
tion (MT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;
Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015),
while still in a nascent stage, have shown im-
pressive results in a number of translation tasks.
Specifically, a number of works have demon-
strated gains in BLEU score (Papineni et al.,
2002) over state-of-the-art non-neural systems,
both when using the neural MT model stand-
alone (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015;
Luong et al., 2015b), or to rerank the output of
more traditional systems phrase-based MT sys-
tems (Sutskever et al., 2014).

However, despite these impressive results with
regards to automatic measures of translation qual-
ity, there has been little examination of the effect
that these gains have on the subjective impressions
of human users. Because BLEU generally has

some correlation with translation quality,1 it is fair
to hypothesize that these gains will carry over to
gains in human evaluation, but empirical evidence
for this hypothesis is still scarce. In this paper, we
attempt to close this gap by examining the gains
provided by using neural MT models to rerank the
hypotheses a state-of-the-art non-neural MT sys-
tem, both from the objective and subjective per-
spectives.

Specifically, as part of the Nara Institute of
Science and Technology (NAIST) submission to
the Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT) 2015
(Nakazawa et al., 2015), we generate reranked and
non-reranked translation results in four language
pairs (Section 2). Based on these translation re-
sults, we calculate scores according to automatic
evaluation measures BLEU and RIBES (Isozaki et
al., 2010), and a manual evaluation that involves
comparing hypotheses to a baseline system (Sec-
tion 3). Next, we perform a detailed analysis of the
cases in which subjective impressions improved or
degraded due to neural MT reranking, and identify
major areas in which neural reranking improves
results, and areas in which reranking is less help-
ful (Section 4). Finally, as an auxiliary result, we
also examine the effect that the size of the n-best
list used in reranking has on the improvement of
translation results (Section 5).

2 Generation of Translation Results

2.1 Baseline System

All experiments are performed on WAT2015 trans-
lation task from Japanese (ja) to/from English (en)
and Chinese (zh). As a baseline, we used the
NAIST system for WAT 2014 (Neubig, 2014), a
state-of-the-art system that achieved the highest
accuracy on all four tracks in the last year’s eval-

1Particularly when comparing similar systems, such as the
case of when neural MT is used for reranking existing system
results.

uation.2 The details of construction are described
in Neubig (2014), but we briefly outline it here for
completeness.

The system is based on the Travatar toolkit
(Neubig, 2013), using tree-to-string statistical MT
(Graehl and Knight, 2004; Liu et al., 2006),
in which the source is first syntactically parsed,
then subtrees of the input parse are converted
into strings on the target side. This translation
paradigm has proven effective for translation be-
tween syntactically distant language pairs such as
those handled by the WAT tasks. In addition, fol-
lowing our findings in Neubig and Duh (2014), to
improve the accuracy of translation we use forest-
based encoding of many parse candidates (Mi et
al., 2008), and a supervised alignment technique
for ja-en and en-ja (Riesa and Marcu, 2010).

To train the systems, we used the ASPEC cor-
pus provided by WAT. For the zh-ja and ja-zh sys-
tems, we used all of the data, amounting to 672k
sentences. For the en-ja and ja-en systems, we
used all 3M sentences for training the language
models, and the first 2M sentences of the training
data for training the translation models.

For English, Japanese, and Chinese, tokeniza-
tion was performed using the Stanford Parser
(Klein and Manning, 2003), the KyTea toolkit
(Neubig et al., 2011), and the Stanford Segmenter
(Tseng et al., 2005) respectively. For parsing, we
use the Egret parser,3 which implements the latent
variable parsing model of (Petrov et al., 2006).4

For all systems, we trained a 6-gram lan-
guage model smoothed with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996) us-
ing KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013). To optimize
the parameters of the log-linear model, we use
standard minimum error rate training (MERT; Och
(2003)) with BLEU as an objective.

2.2 Neural MT Models

As our neural MT model, we use the attentional
model of Bahdanau et al. (2015). The model first
encodes the source sentence f using bidirectional

4In addition, for ja-en translation, we make one modifi-

cation to the parser used in the previous year’s submission,
performing parser self-training (McClosky et al., 2006) us-
ing sentences from the training data that had a BLEU score
greater than 0.8, and selecting the tree corresponding to the
500-best hypothesis that had the best score according to
BLEU+1 (Lin and Och, 2004).

long short-term memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber (1997)) recurrent networks. This re-
sults in an encoding vector hj for each word fj in
f . The model then proceeds to generate the tar-
get translation ê one word at a time, at each time
step calculating soft alignments ai that are used to
generate a context vector gi, which is referenced
when generating the target word

gi =

|f |∑
j=1

ai,jhj . (1)

Attentional models have a number of appeal-
ing properties, such as being theoretically able
to encode variable length sequences without wor-
rying about memory constraints imposed by the
fixed-size vectors used in encoder-decoder mod-
els. These advantages are confirmed in empir-
ical results, with attentional models performing
markedly better on longer sequences (Bahdanau et
al., 2015).

To train the neural MT models, we used the
implementation provided by the lamtram toolkit.5

The forward and reverse LSTM models each had
256 nodes, and word embeddings were also set to
size 256. For ja-en and en-ja models we chose the
first 500k sentences in the training corpus, and for
ja-zh and zh-ja models we used all 672k sentences.
Training was performed using stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) with an initial learning rate of 0.1,
which was halved every epoch in which the devel-
opment likelihood decreased.

For each language pair, we trained two mod-
els and ensembled the probabilities by linearly in-
terpolating between the two probability distribu-
tions.6 These probabilities were used to rerank
unique 1,000-best lists from the baseline model.
To perform reranking, the log likelihood of the
neural MT model was added as an additional fea-
ture to the standard baseline model features, and
the weight of this feature was decided by running
MERT on the dev set.

3 Experimental Results

First, we calculate overall numerical results for our
systems with and without the neural MT reranking
model. As automatic evaluation we use the stan-
dard BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and reordering-
oriented RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010) metrics. In

lar, or slightly inferior results.

manual evaluation, we use the WAT “HUMAN”
evaluation score (Nakazawa et al., 2015), which
is essentially related to the number of wins over
a baseline phrase-based system. In the case that
the system beats the baseline on all sentences, the
HUMAN score will be 100, and if it loses on all
sentences the score will be -100.

From the results in Table 1, we can first see that
adding the neural MT reranking resulted in a sig-
nificant increase in the evaluation scores for all
language pairs under consideration, except for the
manual evaluation in ja-zh translation.7 It should
be noted that these gains are achieved even though
the original baseline was already quite strong (out-
performing most other WAT2015 systems without
a neural component). While neural MT rerank-
ing has been noted to improve traditional sys-
tems with respect to BLEU score in previous work
(Sutskever et al., 2014), to our knowledge this is
the first work that notes that these gains also carry
over convincingly to human evaluation scores. In
the following section, we will examine the results
in more detail and attempt to explain exactly what
is causing this increase in translation quality.

4 Analysis

To perform a deeper analysis, we manually exam-
ined the first 200 sentences of the ja-en part of the
official WAT2015 human evaluation set. Specifi-
cally, we (1) compared the baseline and reranked
outputs, and decided whether one was better or if
they were of the same quality and (2) in the case
that one of the two was better, classified the exam-
ple by the type of error that was fixed or caused
by the reranking leading to this change in sub-
jective impression. Specifically, when annotating
the type of error, we used a simplified version of

7The overall scores for ja-zh are lower than others, per-
haps a result of word-order between Japanese and Chinese
being more similar than Japanese and English, the parser
for Japanese being weaker than that of the other languages,
and less consistent evaluation scores for the Chinese output
(Nakazawa et al., 2014).

the error typology of Vilar et al. (2006) consist-
ing of insertion, deletion, word conjugation, word
substitution, and reordering, as well as subcate-
gories of each of these categories (the number of
sub-categories totalled approximately 40). If there
was more than one change in the sentence, only
the change that we subjectively felt had the largest
effect on the translation quality was annotated.

The number of improvements and degradations
afforded by neural MT reranking is shown in Ta-
ble 2. From this figure, we can see that overall,
neural reranking caused an improvement in 117
sentences, and a degradation in 33 sentences, cor-
roborating the fact that the reranking process is
giving consistent improvements in accuracy. Fur-
ther breaking down the changes, we can see that
improvements in word reordering are by far the
most prominent, slightly less than three times the
number of improvements in the next most com-
mon category. This demonstrates that the neural
MT model is successfully capturing the overall
structure of the sentence, and effectively disam-
biguating reorderings that could not be appropri-
ately scored in the baseline model.

Next in Table 3 we show examples of the four
most common sub-categories of errors that were
fixed by the neural MT reranker, and note the to-
tal number of improvements and degradations of
each. The first subcategory is related to the gen-
eral reordering of phrases in the sentence. As there

is a large amount of reordering involved in trans-
lating from Japanese to English, mistaken long-
distance reordering is one of the more common
causes for errors, and the neural MT model was
effective at fixing these problems, resulting in 26
improvements and only 4 degradations. In the sen-
tence shown in the example, the baseline system
swaps the verb phrase and subject positions, mak-
ing it difficult to tell that the list of conditions are
what “occurred,” while the reranked system appro-
priately puts this list as the subject of “occurred.”

The second subcategory includes insertions or
deletions of auxiliary verbs, for which there were
15 improvements and not a single degradation.
The reason why these errors occurred in the first
place is that when a transitive verb, for example
“obtained,” occurs on its own, it is often translated
as “X was obtained by Y,”8 but when it occurs as
a relative clause decorating the noun X it will be
translated as “X obtained by Y,” as shown in the
example. The baseline system does not include
any explicit features to make this distinction be-
tween whether a verb is part of a relative clause or
not, and thus made a number of mistakes of this
variety. However, it is evident that the neural MT
model has learned to make this distinction, greatly
reducing the number of these errors.

The third subcategory is similar to the first, but
explicitly involves the correct interpretation of co-

ordinate structures. It is well known that syntac-
tic parsers often make mistakes in their interpre-
tation of coordinate structures (Kummerfeld et al.,
2012). Of course, the parser used in our syntax-
based MT system is no exception to this rule, and
parse errors often cause coordinate phrases to be
broken apart on the target side, as is the case in the
example’s “local heating and ablation.” The fact
that the neural MT models were able to correct a
large number of errors related to these structures
suggests that they are able to successfully deter-
mine whether two phrases are coordinated or not,
and keep them together on the target side.

The final sub-category of the top four is related
to verb conjugation agreement. Many of the exam-
ples related to verb conjugation, including the one
shown in Table 3, were related to when two sin-
gular nouns were connected by a conjunction. In
this case, the local context provided by a standard
n-gram language model is not enough to resolve
the ambiguity, but the longer context handled by
the neural MT model is able to resolve this easily.

What is notable about these four categories is
that they all are related to improving the cor-
rectness of the output from a grammatical point
of view, as opposed to fixing mistakes in lexical
choice or terminology. In fact, neural MT rerank-
ing had an overall negative effect on choice of ter-
minology with only 2 improvements at the cost
of 4 degradations. This was due to the fact that
the neural MT model tended to prefer more com-

mon words, mistaking “radiant heat” as “radiation
heat” or “slipring” as “ring.” While these ten-
dencies will be affected by many factors such as
the size of the vocabulary or the number and size
of hidden layers of the net, we feel it is safe to
say that neural MT reranking can be expected to
have a large positive effect on syntactic correct-
ness of output, while results for lexical choice are
less conclusive.

5 Effect of n-best Size on Reranking

In the previous sections, we confirmed the effec-
tiveness of n-best list reranking using neural MT
models. However, reranking using n-best lists
(like other search methods for MT) is an approx-
imate search method, and its effectiveness is lim-
ited by the size of the n-best list used. In order to
quantify the effect of this inexact search, we per-
formed experiments to examine the post-reranking
automatic evaluation scores of the MT results for
all n-best list sizes from 1 to 1000. Figure 1 shows
the results of this examination, with the x-axis re-
ferring to the log-scaled number of hypotheses in
the n-best list, and the y-axis referring to the qual-
ity of the translation, either with regards to model
score (for the model including the neural MT like-
lihood as a feature) or BLEU score.9

From these results we can note several interest-

ferences in tokenization standards between these experiments

ing points. First, we can see that the improve-
ment in scores is very slightly sub-linear in the log
number of hypotheses in the n-best list. In other
words, every time we double the n-best list size
we will see an improvement in accuracy that is
slightly smaller than the last time we doubled the
size. Second, we can note that in most cases this
trend continues all the way up to our limit of 1000-
best lists, indicating that gains are not saturating,
and we can likely expect even more improvements
from using larger lists, or perhaps directly per-
forming decoding using neural models (Alkhouli
et al., 2015). The en-ja results, however, are an
exception to this rule, with BLEU gains more or
less saturating around the 50-best list point.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we described results applying neu-
ral MT reranking to a baseline syntax-based ma-
chine translation system in 4 languages. In partic-
ular, we performed an in-depth analysis of what
kinds of translation errors were fixed by neural
MT reranking. Based on this analysis, we found
that the majority of the gains were related to im-
provements in the accuracy of transfer of correct
grammatical structure to the target sentence, with
the most prominent gains being related to errors
regarding reordering of phrases, insertion/deletion
of copulas, coordinate structures, and verb agree-
ment. We also found that, within the neural MT
reranking framework, accuracy gains scaled ap-

39



proximately log-linearly with the size of the n-best
list, and in most cases were not saturated even af-
ter examining 1000 unique hypotheses.
