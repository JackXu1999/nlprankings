Abstract

User-generated content presents many challenges for its automatic processing. While many of
them do come from out-of-vocabulary effects, others spawn from different linguistic phenomena
such as unusual syntax. In this work we present a French three-domain data set made up of ques-
tion headlines from a cooking forum, game chat logs and associated forums from two popular
online games (MINECRAFT & LEAGUE OF LEGENDS). We chose these domains because they
encompass different degrees of lexical and syntactic compliance with canonical language. We
conduct an automatic and manual evaluation of the difficulties of processing these domains for
part-of-speech prediction, and introduce a pilot study to determine whether dependency analysis
lends itself well to annotate these data. We also discuss the development cost of our data set.

1 Introduction

The continuous growth of the volume of user-generated content (UGC) published on the web stresses
the need for efficient way to automatically process this type of data. Yet not only the volume of UGC
increases; it also becomes increasingly varied, resulting in the need for domain- and register-adaptation
methods and resources for processing UGC in all its diversity.

In this work, we present a feasibility study on dependency syntax annotation for three UGC domains
in French, namely a cooking forum, in-game chat logs, and associated gaming forums. While these
data sources are very different, they share the characteristic that their content was produced within time
or space constraints. Such constraints force the users to resort to a variety of linguistic strategies to
efficiently convey their message.

The work described here shows that, on top of the well-known problem of out-of-vocabulary words,
automatic annotation and processing of UGC presents a double challenge. First, in order to interpret
most of the data , it is crucial to take into account the interplay between context and domain knowledge
on the one hand and their linguistic impact. This is because most messages can only be fully analysed
with a good knowledge of the domain and context at hand. For instance, in-game chat logs can only be
understood with a knowledge of the video game being played and of many game-specific terms, a repre-
sentation of the game situation when a chat message is written and of, as well as a model of the ongoing
dialogue, as such data is conversational by nature. Also, time- or space-constrained writing favors frag-
mentary writing that is more prone to ellipses, which makes linguistic analysis, especially parsing, more
difficult. In addition to this highly contextual nature, the many idiosyncrasies plaguing UGC and make
its analysis more challenging than regular out-of-domain text force most morpho-syntactic processing to
be extremely robust at all levels of analysis.

In Section 3 we describe the data collection process, and give a first quantiative description of how
our datasets are different from standard datasets. Two of our datasets were already annotated, and we
manually annotated the third one. In Section 4 we provide a threefold categorisation of lexical variation
in UGC. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated to our feasibility study regarding dependency annotation of our
data using the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme. It also includes a brief discussion about
annotation costs, an issue rarely explicitely discussed.

Our contribution is threefold: (i) an empirical account of the phenomena behind domain-shift per-
formance drops in French UGC data processing, (ii) a syntactic study on the applicability of Universal
Dependencies to French UGC, and (iii) the first corpus obtained from MINECRAFT and LEAGUE OF
LEGENDS gaming logs. All corpora and annotations are freely available.

2 Related Work

Before the global availability of social-media feeds, studies on the difficulties of out-of-domain statistical
parsing have been focusing mainly on slightly different newspaper texts (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al.,
2006b; McClosky et al., 2006a), biomedical data (Lease and Charniak, 2005; McClosky and Charniak,
2008) or balanced corpora mixing different genres (Foster et al., 2007).

For such data, which is as edited as standard data sources, the problem is “simply” a matter of domain
adaptation. It is far from being the case for UGC data, as shown by Foster (2010). Indeed, in her
seminal work on parsing web data, different issues preventing reasonably good parsing performance
were highlighted; most of them were tied to lexical differences (coming from either genuine unknown
words, typographical divergences, bad segmentation, etc.) or syntactic structures absent from training
data (imperative usage, direct discourse, slang, etc.). This suboptimal parsing behavior on web data
was in turn confirmed in follow-up works on Twitter and IRC chat (Foster et al., 2011a; Gimpel et al.,
2010; Elsner and Charniak, 2011). They were again confirmed during the SANCL shared task, organised
by Google, aimed at assessing the performances of parsers on various genres of Web texts (Petrov and
McDonald, 2012). Foster (2010) and Foster et al. (2011b) noted that simple lexical and tokenisation
convention adaptation to the Wall-Street Journal text genre could increase the parsing performance by a
large margin. In addition, Seddah et al. (2012) showed that a certain amount of normalisation brought a
large improvement in POS tagger performance of French social media texts. These normalisation steps
mostly apply at the lexical level, at the very definition of what constitutes a minimal unit. Plank et al.
(2014) attempt to quantify how much of the domain-specific variation of POS labeling is a result of
different interpretations, and how much is arguably just noise.

Regarding the study of French UGC, our starting point is the part-of-speech and phrase-structure
annotation guidelines by Seddah et al. (2012). However, we conduct our syntactic analysis in terms of
dependency structures.

3 Data Collection and Part-of-Speech Annotation

Our dataset contains three different sources of user-generated content. Two of them are logs of multi-
player video-game chat sessions, MINECRAFT and LEAGUE OF LEGENDS1, the last one is made of
instant cooking-related web questions from MARMITON2, a widely popular French recipe website. This
set of questions was collected during the building of the French QuestionBank (Seddah and Candito,
2016) but was not described nor analysed because of its syntactic peculiarity and was thus considered
by the authors as a clear outlier. We chose to include this sample in our study because it offers a sharp
contrast with video games chat logs in term of domain variation while retaining a live nature: users asks
questions related to their immediate needs and expect a quick answer.
The LEAGUE OF LEGENDS data set was collected by Lamy (2015) in early 2015 and consists of two
types of recorded user interactions: a first part is the record of discussions occurring during an on-going
game session while the second part consists of different players post-game discussion that took place
both on official game forums and on unofficial boards.

Table 1 presents the corpus properties. The figures highlight its unbalanced nature and confirm the
weight of the medium of appearance, be it a “crude” chat system, tweets or a classic web forum. Both
live in-game chat sessions (MINECRAFT and LEAGUE OF LEGENDS in-game) display similar properties
in term of small average length, while the MARMITON and LEAGUE OF LEGENDS outside data exhibit
rather different properties: sentences are either smaller with a small standard deviation for the former or
on average longer with a strong variation for the latter.

3.1 Measuring the “Non-Canonical-ness” of our Data
In order to quantitatively corroborate our intuitions concerning the level of noise in our corpora, and for
measuring their various levels of divergence compared to the French Treebank (Abeillé et al., 2003),
we used an ad hoc noisiness metric. It is simply defined as a variant of the Kullback–Leibler (KL)

Unlike the raw text properties, the KL divergences we computed (Table 1) range around the same figures
(between 2.98 and 3.50). These levels of noisiness appear much higher than the ones reported by Seddah
et al. (2012) for more classical source of user-generated content. This discrepancy can be caused by two
factors: either the texts themselves contain a lot of noise and depart strongly from the writing norm, or
their lexical domain is so different from the French Treebank’s one that the variation it carries can be
considered as noise. If we compare the KL divergence between our 3 data sources (Table 2), we can see
that the trigrams distributions are somehow “closer” to each other than they are to edited text.

3.2 PoS Annotation of Additional Data

As we mentioned in the introduction, our work takes its source in a will to build robust parsing models
regardless of the domain variation. The challenge here is that variation may cover anything from histori-
cal to biomedical texts, Twitter’s feeds subtitles, chat logs and so on. For some machine learning purists,
anything not present in the training data is purely an out-of-domain instance and coping with this varia-
tion should be left only to the model. In this point of view, the loss of performance can be circumvented
by adding more data, annotated or not, thus enlarging the training set. However, in the case of UGC,
the very notion of adding more data can be problematic: UGC covers basically everything that can be
produced by someone with an internet access and at least some notion of a writing system. The need for
more insights in terms of what to expect is becoming a striking issue.

This is why in order to allow further exploration of the language divergence at stake in our UGC sample
data set and because the MARMITON and LEAGUE OF LEGENDS sub corpora were already annotated
using the extended FTB tagset used for the French Social Media Bank, we annotated the MINECRAFT
data set with the same type of annotations. This was done by one expert annotator. We also checked
the consistency of the LEAGUE OF LEGENDS subset and corrected a few obvious errors. Let us add that
this work is part of a pilot study investigating the development of a much larger data set, made of video
games interaction, the annotations are then likely to evolve.

3.3 Exploring our Data: Automatic PoS Annotation Results

To provide a first glance on the difference between our three domains and the training data from FTB, we
provide in Table 3 the PoS tagging accuracy results obtained with the PoS tagger MElt (Denis and Sagot,
2012) trained on edited journalistic data. Results are on-par with previously reported results on French

3It differs from a standard Kullback–Leibler distance because we apply a preliminary pre-processing to the corpora involved:
(i) URLs, e-mail addresses and such, are removed, (ii) all characters that do not belong to an extensive list of characters that
might be used in French sentences are replaced by a unique “non-standard character,”

Table 3: POS tagging results using MElt trained on the French Treebank with and without normalisation.
The tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2012) was trained on the canonical training section of the French Treebank (Abeillé et al., 2003)

instance, FTB-UC, from (Candito and Crabbé, 2009). We used an extended version of the rewriting rules used to pre-annotate

the French Social Media Bank (Seddah et al., 2012). They work jointly with the tagger to provide internal cleaned versions

of a token, or a sequence of, which are tagged separately. Resulting POS tags are finally merged to the original token(s).

(e.g.wanna→ want/VB to/TO→ wanna/VB+TO).

UGC tagging (Seddah et al., 2012; Nooralahzadeh et al., 2014): normalisation helps to cover some of
the most frequent lexical variations and hence improves substantially the tagging accuracy. However in
the case of in-game LEAGUE OF LEGENDS chat session, the normalisation is detrimental to the overall
tagging performance as well as for unseen words. One obvious hypothesis is simply that the rules are
applied deterministically and assign wrong PoSs while letting the pure tagging model work alone provide
reasonable assumption on what would be the correct label for an out-of-domain word. Let us add that the
MElt tagger makes a heavy use of features extracted from wide coverage lexicon, this lexicon itself adds
a domain bias in case of known words used in a totally different syntactic context (which, according to
the FTB guidelines, implies a different category). While MARMITON and LEAGUE OF LEGENDS off-
games tagging results are in the same range than the FTB ones, MARMITON results exhibit vastly inferior
performance but seem to benefit from a normalisation step.4 To summarise, in-game live session logs are
harder to process than “regular” user-generated content.

However, a difference in a single metric such as POS accuracy or Kullback-Lubler divergence offers
little information on the causes of such difference. In other words, each domain has its idiosyncrasies,
and a domain shift is the result of the Cartesian product of the idiosyncrasies of source and target data.

The particularities of UGC are unbound, each new data source—defined by user demographics, user
scenario, technical constraints and communication purpose—can spawn a myriad of idiosyncrasies that
are beyond most domain-adaptation techniques that depend on selective sampling, self-training or other
semi-supervised learning techniques. Therefore, the purpose of the present work is not only to potentially
provide a new dataset to be used as additional training data for domain adaptation. Rather, we provide a
close inspection of the main causes behind the expectable performance drops in tagging and parsing.

We therefore conduct a series of automatic and manual inspections to better understand the linguistic
phenomena behind UGC linguistic variability. We explore the relation between predicting performance
and annotation difficulty, which is seldom explicitly addressed (Plank et al., 2015).

4 A Threefold Categorisation for UGC Idiosyncrasies

Even though user-generated content does not constitute a uniform genre, many works have characterised
its idiosyncrasies (Foster, 2010; Gimpel et al., 2011; Seddah et al., 2012; Eisenstein, 2013), which can be
characterised on three axes, defined by the intentionality or communication needs of the word variants:

1. Encoding simplification: This axis covers ergographic phenomena, i.e.,phenomena aiming at re-
ducing the writing effort, perceived as first glance as genuine misspell errors, and transverse phe-

4In fact, in the case of LEAGUE OF LEGENDS in-game data, the normalisation step adds a significant amount of noise. A
solution to this problem and more generally to the limitations of deterministic rule-based normalisation lies in the development
of non-supervised or semi-supervised adaptative approaches.

16



nomena that include token contraction, “iwuz” for “I was” and over-splitting, “c t” instead of
“c’était” (it was). Word types resulting form these categories pose challenges for their appropi-
ate tokenisation, because they can either be split away by conventional tokenisers or retain conflated
tokens, cf. Section 5.1.

2. Sentiment expression: This axis corresponds to marks of expressiveness, e.g., graphical stretch-
ing, replication of punctuation marks such as ???, emoticons, sometimes used as a verb such as
Je t’<3 standing for Je t’aime (I love you). These phenomena aim at emulating sentiments
expressed through prosody and gesture in direct interaction. Many of these symbols contain punc-
tuation, that can lead to spurious tokenisation. Game logs have also a lot of platform-dependent
particularities in the way they encode emoticons, e.g. the :smile: symbol, which is a place-
holder to show a smile icon, is split as three different tokens (: smile :) by the tokeniser.

3. Context dependency This axis corresponds to the amount of context needed to understand a post.
The nature of different user platforms will influence the domain knowledge necessary to under-
stand the specific terms, from ingredients in MARMITON to weapon characteristics in LEAGUE OF
LEGENDS. As in dialogue-based interaction, speech turns are marked by the thread structure and
provide a context rich enough to allow varying level of ellipsis and anaphora. This structure can be
superseded by hashtags (which example to add a meta data susceptible to attract attention ( “likes”),
providing a parallel source of information. Maybe more importantly, additional multimedia content
can provides a rich source of context that we no dot have full access to when annotating, such as
game state, sounds and images being displayed, etc.

5 Annotating Syntactic Dependencies

Before engaging in an annotation task, we conduct a feasibility study for the three domains at hand.
While part-of-speech and syntactic annotation are not mutually independent, in this section we focus
on how different typographic, lexical and syntactic phenomena can increase the difficulty of syntactic
analysis. The previous work of (Kaljahi et al., 2015) has focused on phrase-structure parsing of forum
text, which was made more difficult by the presence of grammatical errors. They report the benefits
of correcting grammatical errors before conducting constituency parsing. Nevertheless, our corpora
of choice are even more removed from the expectable newswire training data than theirs, and error
correction as such is largely impossible.

Analysing noisy data using phrase structure might require postulating empty elements to be able to
name non-terminals, or even provide a complete tree altogether. In contrast, dependency analysis reduces
this problem by ensuring every token has a head, and that all edges form a tree. This alleged relative ease
of annotation of dependency syntax over phrase structure led us to conduct our feasibility study using
dependency.

As a dependency formalism, we use UD or Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2016). In this
formalism, there are no empty elements, and there is a preference for assigning headnedness to content
words. For instance, for ‘under the table’, ‘table’ is the head of both the article and the preposition. We
choose this formalism because we consider it more reliable to annotate our utterances when they are
missing function words.

5.1 Tokenisation

UD defines dependency relations between syntactic words, and not between orthograpic words. To give
account for this principe, orthographic words can be internally broken down in their forming syntactic
words. In the general case of French, preposition-article contractions such as ‘du’ (of the, singular
masculine) must be treated as two token for syntactic purposes, namely ‘de’ and ’le’. Beyond these
few—but highly frequent—cases, French words do not need internal syntactic token analysis in the
general case.

However, user-generated data has plenty of ergographic phenomena that blur the practical equivalence
between tokens and syntactic words. For instance, the standard French expression“j’aime” (I like) gets
split by the apostrophe into two tokens by any regular tokeniser, but dropping apostrophes that would

17



otherwise be obligatory is a common practice in user-generated data. Thus, ‘jaime’ would not be auto-
maticaly analysable without using strategies for apostrophe recovery. While the UD formalism does not
oblige us to correct every single typographical or grammatical error, we are obliged to do so when an or-
tographic word corresponds to more than one syntactic words. Table 4 provides some detailed examples
of these conflated tokens and the syntactic tokens they contain in their UD represention.

part-of-speech for their syntactic tokens once analysed.

5.2 Effects on Syntax of Time and Space Limits
Many user-generated data sources share the common characteristic that they are written under time and
space limits. Twitter and SMS messages present well-known case of spatial contraints, namely 140 and
160 characters respectively. The MARMITON data presents a more lenient spatial restriction, because the
sentences we use are discussion forum header questions. In our game log data, we find that text has been
written under time constraints. In particular on Minecraft, we observe shorter messages and a higher
prevalence of contractions, ergographism and typos.

Besides the obvious effect on spelling, time and space limitations also influence syntactic choices, be-
cause they also foster dropping less-relevant elements like articles or punctuations, but more importantly
also whole lexical items or spans. Indeed, user-generated data presents plenty of candidates can we can
interpret as ellipsis. While the pragmatics of an internet cooking forum can be very idiosyncratic, even
newswire has a frequent source of syntactic anomalies, namely headlines (Perfetti et al., 1987). Head-
linese is also a result of writing under space constraints, and is a particular use of language that is very
prone to ellipses, e.g the ’U.S. Futures Higher Ahead of GDP Data’5 has no main verb and only one
function word. We expect the headline-esque, conversation-starting MARMITON questions to present
ellipsis and disfluences resulting from its spatial limitations and its almost oral nature.

Finally, in the scenario of syntax under space and time contraints, we also observe that many relations
between clauses are not explicitly marked. We also give account for the cases of parataxis in our data.

5.3 Code-Switching and Direct Speech
The two game-log domains contain plenty of English game terms, and we observe quite a lot of code-
switching. When only a token is code-switched, it’s potential difficulties of analysis can be resolved
during part-of-speech annotation. In this aspect, an atomic code-switch does not differ from using a
loanword (Example 1). When the code-switching spans more than one token, difficulties arise, as a
certain span can have its own internal syntactic structure in English (Example 2), while being embedded
in a French clause. Similarly, we also observe examples of direct speech with an embedded full clause
in English (Example 3).

1. LoL: J’ adore jouer Elise mais faut la up merci .
I love playing Elise but must up her thanks .

2. Minecraft: qui a stuff ? for me
who has stuff ? for me

3. LoL: J’ ai donc dit d’ un ton désperé en all "GG guys, you were better , can’ t carry this: "
I have thus said in a desperate tone in all "GG guys, you were better, can’ t carry this: "

For Examples 2 and 3, it is necessary devise strategies that allow a full analysis of the main language,
and potentially provide an analysis for the code-switched language in an alternative layer.

5.4 Quantitative Analysis
We have taken a sample of 100 unique sentences with at least 4 tokens from each of the three domains.
One of the authors of this article, experienced in dependency annotation, evaluated the difficulties in
annotating them using UD dependencies. Sentences are shorter in Minecraft, and only retrieved 87.
Notice that we do not conduct any sentence splitting, and we treat each of the statements entered by the
users as complete utterances. While some of these utterances could be split in clauses, other sequences
of utterances could be joined to form a single sentence. However, we believe that treating each statement
as a complete utterance is the most realistic scenario for later automatic processing.

Table 5 presents the percentage of sentences in each sample that present annotation difficulties in our
UD pilot. From the phenomena described in this section, we have determined a series of categories, such
as missing main verb (NoVerb), conflicting candidates to main predicate (Pred), parataxis (Parat), code-
switching (CoSwi), missing punctuation that harms understanding (Punct), tokenisation problems such
as fragments or overzealous tokenisation (Tok), and cases of conflated tokens such as the ones presented
in Section 5.1.

MARMITON 42 7 2 0 0 2 11
MINECRAFT 16 1 14 17 15 8 31

Table 5: Corpus-wise percentages of annotation difficulties.

As expected, the two gaming corpora are more similar between themselves than to MARMITON, which
presents a defining particularity in that 42% of the examples do not have a main verb. In this domain,
users rely heavily on domain knownledge, using a language that is often very close to spoken French,
such as “Steak , pâtes et ???” (“Steak, pasta and ???”), where the last conjunct is ommited in order to
formulate a question. While we only find two examples of parataxis in MARMITON, we observe 17 and
14 in LoL and Minecraft. These two domains respond to more real-time data, and the relation between
clauses is less often made explicit. In addition, most statements in MARMITON are monoclausal.

Code-switching and heavy loanword and in-game vocabulary are defining traits for the gaming cor-
pora, which LoL being the corpus with more code-switching and more instances of direct speech. The
sentences with these phenomena present the difficulty of how to represent both the contribution to the
main French sentence, and the internal structure of the cited or code-switched span.

5.5 Annotated Examples
We have conducted some preliminary full dependency annotations for examples we considered illustra-
tive of the different domains and their characteristic syntactic phenomena. Figures 1 and 2 shows three
examples of non-trivial analyses, one for each domain. We provide glosses for the examples in the figure,
and their translations are: A: “Which wine with a pig roast?", B: "But we have to think: assault tank"
and C: “Every time 3VS1 and suddenly -2 P4".

Example A is a MARMITON example, which has no main verb. However, the main term of the question
is “wine”(wine), and we treat is as the main predicate. Example B presents an ambiguity in main predi-
cate choice. While “penser”(think) is the only verb of the sentence and makes a good candidate for main
predicate, we can also see the whole span before the colon it as an extrapredicative, with “char”(tank)
being the head of the predication.

Example C presents a series of idiosyncrasies. First of all, we had to treat the contractions “du" (of
the, singular) and “des" (of the, plural) as two separate tokens, marked in parentheses following UD
tokenisation principles, as well as an unusual typo,i.e. "couˆ" should be “coup”, literally hit, a formant
of the expression “du coup”, which means literally. This last multiword, treated with a flat structure with
the mwe label, is very common in spoken French, but not present in the French UD treebank.

More importantly, C shows an attachment ambiguity caused by part-of-speech ambiguity and verb
ellipsis. A natural ellipsis recovery of example C would read as "Every time there are 3VS1, and

suddenly I have -2 P4". The word "3VS1" stands for “3 versus 1”, namely an uneven combat setting,
and ‘P4” refers to the character’s protection armor. The token "-2" admits more than one analysis. The
first analysis is the simple reading as number, complementing the noun "P4". A second analysis treats
"-2" as a trascription of "moins de" (less than, less of), which would be the preferred analysis in case the
verb recovery held. This example shows the interplay between frequent ellipses, ergographic phenomena
(Seddah et al., 2012) and the need for domain knowledge in user-generated data.

Figure 3: Prototype phrase-based analysis of an ex-
treme elliptic case: Too much bananas, freezing?

As said above, elliptical structures are frequent
in our corpora and are a direct consequence of
the live nature of the medias we choose to study.
This is why at the beginning of this work, we
decided to annotate these ellipsis, breaking thus
the French Treebank guidelines, because we pre-
tentiously thought we could always remain neu-
tral in our interpretation of the missing syntactic
context while agreeing on it and that it would
be actually useful. Figure 3 shows an example
of such annotation, here prototyped in a phrase-
based manner, following the FTB guidelines. In
this example, the two VNs (Verbal Nucleus in
the FTB terminology) were supposed to respectively stand for “J’ai”/I have and “dois-je”/should I but
they could have stand for anything else (preposition, adverbial phrase) while the strictly transitive verb
“congeler”/to freeze is expecting a direct-object (showed by a trace in the clitics position pointing to
the preceding NP). In short, trying to annotate such missing constructions was akin to numerous, if not
pointless, inferences and led us to consider a UD analysis where we only had to make bananas the main

20



predicate, and treat freeze as a subordinate clause.
Regardless of the difficulty of the domain, it appears that a UD dependency analysis lends itself to

dependency annotation in an easier way: Since non-leaf relations appear between lexical words, this
representation is more robust to missing determiners, prepositions and punctuations, even phrases. Also,
if we used other dependency formalisms that for instance place prepositions as heads of nouns, it would
be more difficult to annotate as it is the case using the current French Treebank dependency scheme
(Candito et al., 2010). Nevertheless, dependency analyses conflate functional and structural information
(Silveira and Manning, 2015), and some of the structural information can be lost in cases such as the
Example C, discussed above.

Annotating dependencies lends itself well to noisy user-generated data. In a strict lexicalist analysis
such as UD, where there are no tokens for unobserved words (e.g. dropped subjects, missing main verbs),
we must build a structure from the existing words, and not from idealised sentence representations. We
finally observe that for UGC, shorter sentences are harder to annotate. Indeed, sentences closer to the
lower threshold of 4 tokens we have determined, seem to present more ellipsis, while longer sentences
in our data have structures closer to more canonical syntax.

5.7 The Unspoken Costs of Treebank Annotation

As we all know, creating annotated data is a rewarding task, extremely useful for evaluation as well as
for building feature-rich supervised models. Yet, it is time consuming and as generally said, relatively
costly (Schneider, 2015) even though crowd-sourcing solutions through games with a purpose start to
emerge (Guillaume et al., 2016). The dataset we presented in that paper are part of process that was
initiated 5 years ago when we were confronted to the lack of syntactically-annotated out-of-domain
dataset for French. The purely syntactic annotation phase for the LoL and Minecraft data is still ongoing
and we expect it to be finished in the first few months of 2017. It is important to consider that such
a task was made possible because of the experience we gained along the years and because we relied
on a highly trained team of annotators. This training was the most important point in term of costs
and had to be extended each time we added a new major annotation layer (from surface syntax to deep
syntax for example, see (Candito et al., 2014) for details). Table 6 presents the costs of the treebanking
effort (mainly led by Marie Candito and the second author) that was carried out by the INRIA’s Alpage
team since 2011 and led to the release of many out-of-domain and user-generated content treebanks.
The figures do not include the costs of the permanent-position researchers involved in the design of the
annotation scheme, in preliminary annotation, in the development of pre-annotation pipelines, post-
annotation error detection and correction tools and in the training and supervision of the annotators.
Considering that we annotated 4 different layers for about 7k out-of-domain sentences and 2 layers for
3.7k of UGC data, the average cost per sentence is about 3 euros, on par with what is known about
the English Web Treebank (Bies et al., 2012) development costs (Mc Donald, PC). Unlike less costly
initiatives that focused on gold standard or training data creation, our goal was also to provide a linguistic
snapshot of a specific domain at a given time, useful as such for linguists.

6 Conclusion

We have presented a three-corpus dataset of user-generated French data. We have shown how the devi-
ation from conventional newswire data manifests in different ways, and not only lexical elements. For
lexical elements, we have presented a threefold categorisation of UGC idiosyncracies.

We have subsequently conducted a pilot study to evaluate the a priori difficulties of applying a UD
analysis on our data. We have determined that for our data set, after POS analysis, the difficulty of
annotating depends on the amount of elided material and on the ability of the representation scheme to
cope with the discrepancies between raw and syntactic tokens. While dependency syntax is more robust
towards missing elements that phrase-structure representations, many the examples of the forum text
presented cases of i.a. main-verb ellipsis, which are still difficult to tackle using dependency analysis.
While the main problem for analysis of term-rich texts like those of gaming logs lies (LEAGUE OF
LEGENDS and MINECRAFT) at the POS level, the hidden problem arises with perfectly standard text
lacking most of the usual syntactic glue, including verbal predicates, which we find in MARMITON.
For games, however, the other main problem lies in the strong contextualization of such production,
making them barely understandable by a domain-outsider. Lastly, we believe our data can be used as
a very interesting crash-test or a valuable reference material, so we make all data freely available at
