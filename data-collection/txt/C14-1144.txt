Abstract 

We present 3arif1, a large-scale corpus of Modern Standard and Egyptian Arabic tweets annotated for 
epistemic modality2. To create 3arif, we design an interactive crowdsourcing annotation procedure that 
splits up the annotation process into a series of simplified questions, dispenses with the requirement for 
expert linguistic knowledge and captures nested modality triggers and their attributes semi-
automatically.  

1 Introduction 

Epistemic modality, according to Palmer (2001), defines the speaker's subjective knowledge, beliefs 
and judgments about the world's states of affairs. Epistemic modality is used as a linguistic feature for 
multiple NLP tasks and applications, including sentiment analysis (Abdul-Mageed and Diab 2011), 
opinion mining (Benamara et al. 2012) and scientific discourse evaluation (Waard and Maat  2012), 
among others.  

To-date, there are no large-scale modality-annotated Arabic corpora compared to English (Baker et 
al. 2010, 2012; Rubinstein et al. 2013), Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013), Portuguese (Hendrickx et al. 
2012) and Japanese (Matsuyoshi et al. 2010). The creation of modality-annotated corpora is non-trivial 
because there is no consensus definition of modality and its attributes in theoretical linguistics to be 
rendered into annotation tasks and guidelines. Furthermore, most current modality annotation schemes 
rely on sophisticated theoretically-grounded guidelines that require annotators from linguistics back-
ground; hence, annotation is usually restricted to small-scale in-lab settings.  

In this paper, we present 3arif, a large-scale Arabic corpus annotated for epistemic modality. 3arif 
comprises 9822 unique tweets in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Arabic (EA), annotat-
ed for 9966 tokens that map to 214 unique types of epistemic modality. Each epistemic modality is 
annotated for sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holder(s) and scope(s). The reason that 3arif fea-
tures the tweets' genre with an emphasis on MSA and EA tweets is that it comes as part of a larger 
project to incorporate linguistic features, such as modality, with network-based features to automati-
cally identify the key players of Twitter's political discourse in counties of political unrest such as 
Egypt. We harvested 3arif from a variety of Twitter users including newspapers, TV stations, political 
campaigns, among others, as well as individuals. As a result 3arif is diglossic for MSA, the formal 
Arabic variety, and EA, the native Arabic dialect of Egypt.  

For the annotation of 3arif, we design a simplified procedure that depicts the following ideas: first, it 
defines each annotation task as a series of open and closed questions that do not require sophisticated 
linguistics background and, meanwhile, provide annotators with self-explanatory annotation guide-
lines; second, it is interactive so that questions are displayed/hidden based on annotators' prior an-
swers; and finally, it semi-automatically identifies and merges nested epistemic modality based on an-
notators' answers to a number of easy-to-administer questions.

We evaluate our annotation results using Krippendorff's reliability (Krippendorff 2011) and agree-
ment. Results show high inter-annotator reliability and agreement rates and indicate that our annota-
tion scheme and procedure are efficient. The contribution of this research, therefore, is twofold: first, 
we create a novel resource for Arabic NLP which is expected to enhance research on modality auto-
matic identification and extraction; second, we present an efficient and easy-to-administer annotation 
procedure with interactive crowdsourcing potentials for the complex task of modality annotation. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our annotation scheme including 
annotation tasks, guidelines and the interactive structure; Section 3 gives examples for the representa-
tion of the final annotation outputs; Section 4 describes corpus harvesting and sampling; Section 5 dis-
cusses the results and presents a disagreement analysis; Section 6 compares and contrasts our work to 
related work; and Section 7 highlights the points not covered in this current version of 3arif. 

2 Annotation Scheme 

Our annotation scheme consists of six tasks to label sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders and 
scopes for each epistemic modality. Prior to the beginning of the interactive annotation procedure, we 
highlighted all candidate epistemic modalities in each tweet using a string-match algorithm and the 
lexicons from Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013, 2014).  The algorithm finds all potential epistemic modality 
triggers (i.e. words and phrases that may convey epistemic modality) within each tweet in our corpus 
and marks them as annotation units. A total of 9966 candidate epistemic modality triggers are high-
lighted in 9822 tweets. 

2.1 Task 1: Sense  

Sense annotation is to decide for each highlighted candidate trigger in context whether it actually con-
veys epistemic modality. The same lexical verb اشعر A$Er is used as an epistemic modality trigger an-
ticipating a future possibility in example 1; but as a non-modal lexical verb in example 2.  

  3]متظاھر مليون 30نا سنكسر رقم ال[ان شعرا .1
A$Er An[nA snksr rqm Al30 mlywn mtZAhr] 
I feel that [we will get 30+ million protesters]. 

بالفخر والقلق أيضا في ذكرى حرب أكتوبر شعرا: ھيكل# .2  
#hykl: A$Er bAlfxr wAlqlq >yDA fy *krY Hrb >ktwbr 
#Heikl: I feel proud but also worried when I remember October's war. 

We define sense annotation as a synonymy judgment task, following Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013). Epis-
temic modality is represented by an exemplar set manually selected so that: (1) each exemplar is an 
unambiguous epistemic trigger, (2) exemplars are in both MSA and EA, (3) exemplars comprise both 
simple words and multiword expressions, (4) exemplars are both affirmative and negative, and (5) ex-
emplars are of different lexical intensities. Furthermore, we create multiple versions of the same set so 
that we cover the inflections for gender, number, person, tense, mood, and aspect in Arabic. We then 
use the set that morphologically matches the candidate trigger to be annotated. Presented with a pre-
highlighted candidate trigger in context and the exemplar set, annotators are to decide whether the giv-
en candidate trigger is synonymous to the exemplar set, and is hence an epistemic modality trigger, or 
not.  

If an annotator decides that a given candidate trigger does not convey epistemic modality, no further 
questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or scopes are displayed. To guarantee that an-
notators do not select the non-synonymous option as an easy escape, they are not allowed to move 
forward without submitting at least one synonym of their own to the candidate trigger.  

Designing the interactive procedure as such results in disagreement propagation. If one annotator 
decides that a given candidate trigger is not epistemic, but another annotator decides that it is, the for-
mer will not have to answer any further questions about polarity, intensification, tense, holders or 
scopes; whereas the latter will have to provide answers for each of those annotation tasks. 

                                                
3 Throughout the examples, epistemic modality triggers are represented in boldface and scopes are in-between square brack-

ets.

2.2 Task 2: Polarity  

Task 2 uses as input the candidates labeled as valid epistemic modality triggers in Task 1 and labels 
each as either affirmative or negative. An affirmative trigger indicates that the speaker holds the given 
state of affairs (i.e. propositions) as TRUE; whereas a negative trigger indicates that the given proposi-
tions are held as FALSE by the speaker.  

To decide on whether the polarity is affirmative or negative, annotators are instructed to look for the 
absence/presence of such negation markers as: 

• Negation particles such as مش m$ (not), E lA (not) and غير gyr (not), among others. 

• Negation affixes like the circumfix m...$ in مظنش mZn$ (I do not think). 

• Negative polarity items like عمري Emry (never) and لم يعد lm yEd (no longer). 

• Negative auxiliaries where negation is placed on the past tense auxiliary as in مكنتش واثق mknt$ 
wAvq (I was not sure).  

• Inherently-negative triggers that encode negation in their lexical meanings such as مستحيل 
mstHyl (impossible). 

Annotators are instructed that using multiple negation markers results in an affirmative sense. Thus, 
 lys mn AlmstHyl (it is not impossible) means that the proposition is actually possible ليس من المستحيل
according to the speaker. Put differently, it means that the speaker holds the proposition as TRUE. An-
notators are required to give the reason for negation if they decide that a given trigger is negative. 

2.3 Task 3: Intensification  

Epistemic modality triggers can have different lexical intensities (i.e. intensities encoded in the lexical 
meaning of the word/phrase regardless of the context). For instance, even without a context, Arabic 
speakers know that دكمتأ  mt>kd (I am/he is sure) expresses higher possibility than ليمتھيأ  mthy>ly (I 
imagine). When used in context, the trigger's lexical intensity can be maintained as is. Yet, it can also 
be amplified or mitigated by various linguistic means such as: 

• Modification: adverbs like تماما tmAmA (absolutely) and بالفعل bAlfEl (indeed), among others, 
amplify lexical intensity; whereas mitigation can be caused by such adverbs as تقريبا tqrybA (al-
most) and غالبا gAlbA (most probably), among others.  

• Categorical negation typically amplifies lexical intensity as in  أبدا ممكنمش  m$ mmkn >bdA (it is 
not possible at all).  

• Emphatic expressions such as قد qd (indeed) and وهللا wAllh (I swear), among others, lead to lex-
ical intensity amplification.  

• Coordination of two or more triggers usually results in intensity amplification as in عارف ومتأكد 
EArf wmt>kd (I know and I am sure). 

The annotators' task for intensification is to decide for each candidate labeled as a valid epistemic 
modality trigger in Task 1 whether its lexical intensity is amplified (AMP), mitigated (MTG), or main-
tained (AS IS). During interactive annotation, annotators are asked to provide the reason for their selec-
tion; that is, whether the lexical intensity is affected by an adverb, categorical negation, an emphatic 
expression, coordination, or any other reason. 

2.4 Task 4: Tense  

In this version of 3arif, we work on the present and past tenses only. Thus, Task 4 is to decide for each 
valid epistemic trigger from Task 1 whether it is present (PRS) or past (PST). Tense can be marked ei-
ther morphologically by inflections and affixes or contextually by auxiliary verbs such as كان kAn 
(was), among others. Annotators are also required to give their reasons for selecting either PRS or PST. 

2.5 Task 5: Holder  

Holder annotation is to identify the holder of the epistemic modality which is the ±RATIONAL entity 
that expresses its knowledge, beliefs or judgments about the world's states of affairs.  

1523



Holders can be −RATIONAL entities as in example 3. The entity that is making the assumption that 
the former Palestinian president - Yasser Arafat - may have died of natural causes is the report issued 
by the French government.  

]تعود 0سباب طبيعية ربما عرفات# وفاة[: تقرير فرنسي .3  
tqryr frnsy: [wfAp #ErfAt rbmA tEwd lAsbAb TbyEyp] 
A French report: [natural causes might be behind the death of #Arafat].  

The holder is not necessarily the same as the trigger's grammatical subject. In example 4, the gram-
matical subject of يبدو ybdw (seems) is )ع,ن الدستوريا  AlAElAn Aldstwry (the constitutional declara-
tion). However, the entity that is making the judgment about this declaration is the French govern-
ment, which is then the real holder of ybdw. 

]انه يسلك ا0تجاه الصحيح يبدوع6ن الدستوري الجديد لمرسي 0 ا0[: فرنسا .4  
frnsA: [AlAElAn Aldstwry Aljdyd lmrsy lA ybdw Anh yslk AlAtjAh AlSHyH] 
France: [Morsi's new constitutional declaration does not seem to be a correct move].  

Twitter users do not only post their own knowledge, beliefs and judgments about the world's states 
of affairs, but also they (1) directly and indirectly quote others and (2) make assumptions about others' 
knowledge, beliefs and judgments. This means that we can have nested holders, according to Wiebe et 
al. (2005) and Saurí and Pustejovsky (2009), where we know about others' knowledge, beliefs and 
judgments only though the writer or the Twitter user in our case.  

In example 5, the Twitter user quotes Elbaradei stating that he may run for presidency if the people 
want him to. That is, the holder of the epistemic modality is actually Elbaradei not the Twitter user.  

إذا طلب الشعب  ]أترشح في انتخابات الرئاسة[ قد: البرادعي .5  
AlbrAdEy: qd [>tr$H fy AntxAbAt Alr}Asp] <*A Tlb Al$Eb  

Elbaradei: I may [run for presidency] if the people want me to.  

The holder of the epistemic modality in example 6 is not the Twitter user, either. However, the Twit-
ter user is not quoting anyone here, but is rather making an assumption about what the Egyptian Na-
tional Party holds as TRUE. 

]ه ممكن يرجع[ان مقتنعالحزب الوطني  .6  #Jan25 
AlHzb AlwTny mqtnE An[h mmkn yrjE] #Jan25 

The National Party is convinced that [it may get back to authority]. #Jan25 

We can have two or more nested holders. In example 5, we have two: the first is ElBaradei and the 
second is the Twitter user who is quoting ElBaradei. Similarly, in example 6, we have two nested 
holders: the first is the Egyptian National Party and the second is the Twitter user who makes the as-
sumptions about the party's beliefs.  

In example 7, however, we have three nested holders. The first is ا(خوان AlAxwAn (the Muslim 
Brotherhood) that holds as TRUE the proposition that the Military Council is conspiring against them. 
That belief of the Muslim Brotherhood is communicated to us through the politician ابو الفتوح Abw 
AlftwH (Abulfotoh) who is then the second holder. Yet, Abulfotoh has not posted his assumption 
about the Muslim Brotherhood's belief on his personal account. Instead, he has been quoted by another 
Twitter user, who is the third holder.  

]ھناك مؤامرة من العسكري[ان  تصورواا0خوان : ابو الفتوح .7  
Abw AlftwH: AlAxwAn tSwrwA An [hnAk m&Amrp mn AlEskry] 
Abulfotoh: The Muslim Brotherhood members thought that [there was a conspiracy by the Military 
Council]. 

During the interactive procedure, annotators are first asked whether the holder is the same as the 
Twitter user. If not, more questions are displayed to determine: (1) who the real holder is; (2) whether 
the tweet is a(n) (in)direct quote (e.g. there are direct quotation markers or such words as قال qAl (he 
said) and صرح SrH (he declared), among others), or the tweet conveys the Twitter user's assumptions 
about others. 

1524



When the holder is not the same as the Twitter user, annotators are asked to mark the boundaries of 
the linguistic unit that corresponds to the holder in the tweet's text, following the maximal length prin-
ciple from Szarvas et al. (2008), so that they mark the largest possible, meaningful linguistic unit. 
Hence, in example 8 the holder is the Islamist opponents in #KSA not only the Islamist opponents. 

8. Jمصر# في الثورة لقتل تسعى ھا[نأ نوموقن السعودية# في نالمعارضو س6ميونا[  
Al<slAmywn AlmEArDwn fy #AlsEwdyp mwqnwn >n[hA tsEY lqtl Alvwrp fy #mSr] 
Islamist opponents in #KSA know for sure that [it tries to put an end to #Egypt's revolution]. 

2.6 Task 6: Scope  

Scopes are the states of affairs modified by the epistemic modality triggers. Modality scopes in Arabic 
are most likely realized as clauses, deverbal nouns or to-infinitives, according to Al-Sabbagh et al. 
(2013). We use the same maximal length guideline from Task 5 so that the scope segment marked by 
the annotators is the largest possible segment typically delimited by: (1) punctuation markers and (2) 
subordinate conjunctions such as Eن  lAn (because) and لو lw (if), among others. 

In the case of nested triggers as in example 9, where a trigger and its scope are both embedded in 
another trigger's scope, the interactive procedure prompts the annotators to label each trigger and its 
scope separately at first. Afterwards, we automatically merge them as we further explain in Section 3. 

]]يرجع[ ممكن ه[أن مقتنع الوطني الحزب .9  #Jan25 
AlHzb AlwTny mqtnE >n[h mmkn [yrjE]] #Jan25 
The National Party is convinced that [it may [get back to power]] #Jan25 

Annotators are instructed that a single trigger may have one or more scopes. In example 10, the trig-
ger بيتھيألھم bythy>lhm (they imagine) scopes over two complement clauses, which annotators are re-
quired to identify. Furthermore, annotators are given the guideline that two or more triggers - typically 
conjoined by a coordinating conjunction - can share the same scope as in example 11. In the cases like 
example 11, each trigger and its attributes are first annotated separately and then once our system finds 
out that they share the same polarity, intensification, tense, holder, and scope, they are merged togeth-
er as we show in Section 3.  

]اعندھم ثأر مع السلطة بكل أشكالھھم [وان] دم اخواتھم راح ھدر[ان  بيتھيألھمأو0دنا  .10  
>wlAdnA bythy>lhm An [dm AxwAthm rAH hdr] wAn[hm Endhm v>r mE AlslTp bkl >$kAlhA]  

Our children imagine that [their friends were killed for no reason] and that [they now have to take re-
venge from the authorities].  

 البرادعي عارف ومتاكد ان [نسبة 12 % بس ھتنتخبه] وعلشان كدة مش ھيرشح نفسه .11
AlbrAdEy EArf wmtAkd An [nsbp 12% bs htntxbh] wEl$An kdp m$ hyr$H nfsh 

Elbaradei knows and is sure that [only 12% will vote for him]. So, he will not run for presidency. 

Annotators are instructed that scopes are not necessarily adjacent to their triggers. In example 12, 
the scope starts three words to the right of its trigger باقتنع bAqtnE (get convinced) given that the adver-
bial phrase اكتر واكتر Aktr wAktr (more and more) falls in between it and its scope.  

]نا كنا محتاجيين دكتاتور وطني عادل[اكتر واكتر ان باقتنعكل يوم بيعدي  .12  
kl ywm byEdy bAqtnE Aktr wAktr An[nA knA mHtAjyn dktAtwr wTny EAdl] 

Every day, I get more and more convinced that [we needed a patriotic and fair dictator]. 

Annotators are also instructed that scopes can (1) precede, (2) follow or (3) surround their triggers. 
Many of the aforementioned examples have the scopes following their triggers. Yet, in example 13 the 
scope surrounds its trigger and in example 14 it precedes its trigger.  

]عليه دين يبدو فيما ليست مرسي وعود[ .13  
 [wEwd mrsy lyst fymA ybdw dyn Elyh] 

[Morsi's promises are not seemingly doable].

1525



[A campaign to distort the image of January's revolution and to restore everything back to its original 
state has started], seemingly.  

3 Final Output Representation  

All elicited answers during annotation are automatically organized into the representations illustrated 
in the examples below. The representation of example 15 reads as follows: the USER (i.e. the Twitter 
user) used to moderately hold as TRUE the proposition that the revolutionist candidates were unable to 
compete for presidency. We know that this is a past belief that the USER used to have because annota-
tors have labeled the trigger تصورت tSwrt (I thought) as past (PST). There are no nested holders given 
that the USER is the same as the holder. The intensity value of MODerate comes from the fact that 
 tSwrt (I thought) is of a moderate lexical intensity being weaker than such epistemic triggers as تصورت
 AZn (I اظن EArf (I know) but stronger than such epistemic triggers as عارف mtAkd (I am sure) and متاكد
guess) and متھيالي mthyAly (I imagine). Meanwhile, the lexical intensity of tSwrt is neither amplified 
nor mitigated; hence annotators have given it an AS IS intensification label in Task 3. Consequently, in 
the final annotation output the original lexical intensity value has been used to represent how far the 
holder used to consider his/her belief as TRUE. 

]للرئاسة ضعف من المنافسةامرشحي الثورة [ن ا تصورتفي البداية  .15  
fy AlbdAyp tSwrt An [mr$Hy Alvwrp ADEf mn AlmnAfsp llr}Asp] 
At first, I thought that [the revolutionist candidates are too weak to compete for presidency]. 

rep. USER, MOD PST TRUE, (mr$Hy Alvwrp ADEf mn AlmnAfsp llr}Asp) 

Example 16 shows how two epistemic modality triggers in the same tweet are given two separate 
representations because they share the same holder but neither the same intensity nor the same scopes. 
The first representation illustrates the epistemic trigger ارى ArY (I think) and reads as follows: the US-
ER currently holds as TRUE the proposition that the media is misleading the people; s/he is MODerately 
confident about that. The second representation is for the epistemic trigger واضح wADH (obviously). It 
indicates that the same USER strongly holds as TRUE the proposition that the media is trying to stop the 
change that the people are longing for. Both triggers are labeled as present (PRS) tense. Furthermore, 
both triggers are labeled as maintaining their lexical intensity AS IS. The trigger ارى ArY (I think) is 
then labeled in the final representation as being of MODerate intensity because it is weaker than متاكد 
mtAkd (I am sure), for instance, but stronger than متھيالي mthyAly (I imagine); whereas the trigger واضح 
wADH (obviously) is labeled as indicating a strong (STRG) belief being synonymous to متاكد mtAkd (I 
am sure) and اعرف AErf (I know) among other triggers that express speakers' high confidence about 
their knowledge, beliefs and judgments.  

]ھم يقاومون التغيير الذى نطمح له[ان واضح ]ع6م يقدم شباب يخدرون الشعبا0[ان  رىا .16  
ArY An [AlAElAm yqdm $bAb yxdrwn Al$Eb] wADH An[hm yqAwmwn Altgyyr Al*y nTmH lh] 
I think [the media presents young speakers who mislead the people]. Obviously, [they are resisting 
the change we are longing for]. 

rep1. USER, MOD PRS TRUE, (AlAElAm yqdm $bAb yxdrwn Al$Eb) 
rep2. USER, STRG PRS TRUE, (hm yqAwmwn Altgyyr Al*y nTmH lh) 

Example 17 illustrates how two coordinating epistemic triggers sharing the same polarity, tense, in-
tensification, holder and scope are represented. They are simply merged in one representation. The 
same example shows how assumptions made by Twitter users about others' knowledge, beliefs and 
judgments are represented. The representation reads as follows: the USER MODerately holds as TRUE 
the proposition that Elbaradei strongly (STRG) holds as TRUE that only 12% of the Egyptians will vote 
for him for presidency. The values of TRUE, MODerate and present (PRS) assigned to the USER's as-
sumption about Elbaradei are default values used to mark Twitter users' assumptions about others' 
knowledge, beliefs and judgments.  

 البرادعي عارف ومتاكد ان [نسبة 12 % بس ھتنتخبه] وعلشان كدة مش ھيرشح نفسه .17
AlbrAdEy EArf wmtAkd An [nsbp 12% bs htntxbh] wEl$An kdp m$ hyr$H nfsh 

Elbaradei knows and is sure that [only 12% will vote for him]. So, he will not run for presidency. 

rep. USER, MOD PRS TRUE, (AlbrAdEy, STRG PRS TRUE, (nsbp 12% bs htntxbh))  

1526



Example 18 represents an epistemic trigger with multiple scopes. The example also represents 
Twitter users making assumptions about others' knowledge, beliefs and judgments. As we mentioned 
in example 17, the values of TRUE, MODerate and present (PRS) assigned to the USER's assumption are 
assigned by default. The trigger بيتھيألھم bythy>lhm (they imagine) is labeled as a present (PRS) tense 
affirmative trigger. Its original lexical intensity - which is weak (WK) - is labeled as being maintained 
AS IS. The trigger بيتھيألھم bythy>lhm (they imagine) is of a weak lexical intensity because it is weaker 
than متاكد mtAkd (I am sure) and even اظن AZn (I think). 

]االسلطة بكل أشكالھھم عندھم ثأر مع [وان] دم اخواتھم راح ھدر[ان  بيتھيألھمو0دنا أ .18  
>wlAdnA bythy>lhm An [dm AxwAthm rAH hdr] wAn[hm Endhm v>r mE AlslTp bkl >$kAlhA]  
Our children imagine that [their friends were killed for no reason] and that [they now have to take re-
venge from the authorities]. 

rep. USER, MOD PRS TRUE, (>wlAdnA, WK PRS TRUE ,(dm AxwAthm rAH hdr; hm Endhm v>r mE AlslTp 
bkl >$kAlhA)) 

Example 19 illustrates embedded triggers. Its representation reads as: the USER MODerately holds as 
TRUE that the Egyptian National Party strongly (STRG) holds as TRUE that it (i.e. the Egyptian National 
Party) may get back to ruling. It is important to notice that both the matrix trigger مقتنع mqtnE (is con-
vinced) and the embedded trigger (i.e. ممكن mmkn (may)) share the same holder which is the Egyptian 
National Party.  

]]يرجع[ ممكنه [نا مقتنعالحزب الوطني  .19  #Jan25 
AlHzb AlwTny mqtnE An[h mmkn [yrjE]] #Jan25 

The National Party is convinced that [it may [get back to power]]. 

rep. USER, MOD PRS TRUE, (AlHzb AlwTny, STRG PRS TRUE,(MOD PRS TRUE, (yrjE))) 

Example 20 shows how reported knowledge, beliefs and judgments are represented. The USER in 
this example has no other role but to report Darrag's strong belief that the army will interfere to stop 
the chaos.

Darrag: [the #army will definitely interfere in the case of chaos] #Egypt #Morsi #Ikhwan 

rep. USER, report, (drAj, STRG PRS TRUE (#Aljy$ sytdxl fy HAlp AlfwDY)) 

4 Corpus Harvesting  

In order to restrict our corpus to political discourse and ensure that we compile a representative corpus 
of epistemic modality, we harvested our corpus so that each tweet (1) has at least one trendy political 
English or Arabic hashtag such as #Egypt and #مرسي mrsy (Morsi)4, and (2) has at least one epistemic 
modality trigger from the Arabic Modality Lexicons of Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013, 2014). Table 1 gives 
statistics for the sampled corpus that comprises 9822 unique tweets, with 9966 candidate epistemic 
modality triggers that map to 214 unique types.

5.1 Evaluation Methodology and Metrics  

Our annotation tasks are of two types: (1) Tasks 1-4 are label-based where there is a pre-defined set of 
labels from which annotators choose; and (2) Tasks 5-6 are segmentation-based where the output of 
the annotation is a text segment. For the segmentation-based tasks, we use an all-or-nothing method to

measure reliability and agreement: for segments to be considered as agreement, they must share both 
the beginning and end boundaries. We use Krippendorff's alpha α (Krippendorff 2011) as our inter-
annotator reliability measure, following the most recent work on modality annotation for other lan-
guages including English (Rubinstein et al. 2013) and Chinese (Cui and Chi 2013). For more details 
on Krippendorff's alpha and a comparison of inter-annotator agreement measures, we refer the reader 
to Artstein and Poesio (2008).   

5.2 Results 

We use the surveygizmo services to implement our interactive annotation procedure given that their 
survey structure is one that allows for using conditional branching and skip logic5. We distributed the 
survey on Twitter and we had three annotators participating. According to the short qualifying quiz 
given at the beginning of the survey, all three participants are native Egyptian Arabic (EA) speakers 
who have at least two-year experience with using Twitter. They are also university graduates who, 
therefore, master Modern Standard Arabic. None of the participants has a linguistics background. 

Table 2 shows alpha and agreement rates for each annotation task. We measure the rates in four dif-
ferent scenarios so that we can (1) estimate the effect of the inclusion of the NON-EPISTEMIC category 
agreement, (2) estimate the effect of disagreement propagation from Task 1, and (3) evaluate the 
guidelines and procedures for each annotation task separately. The four scenarios are:  

• w/NONE w/DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic and disagreement propagating from 
Task 1 are both included. 

• w/NONE w/o DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic are included, but disagreement prop-
agating from Task 1 is excluded.  

• w/o NONE w/DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic are excluded, but disagreement prop-
agating from Task 1 is included.  

• w/o NONE w/o DP: candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic and disagreement propagating from 
Task 1 are both excluded. This scenario focuses on each annotation task separately without any 
distractions.

Table 2: Inter-annotator alpha reliability and agreement rates 

In the case of Task 1 (i.e. sense annotation), only the second scenario is applicable: we cannot ex-
clude the candidates agreed upon as non-epistemic because the target is to know how reliable the an-
notation is with regards to distinguishing between epistemic and non-epistemic candidates. It is the 
first annotation task, thus there is no prior disagreement propagation. From Table 2, we derive the fol-
lowing observations:  

• Disagreement in Task 1 propagates ~ 0.05 to 0.1 disagreement for the other annotation tasks. 

• Adding the agreed upon non-epistemic candidates yields up to ~ 0.2 gain for both alpha reliabil-
ity and agreement rates. 

• For an end-to-end automatic system that first identifies triggers and then their attributes, the 
benchmark rates are those from the w/NONE w/DP scenario.

5.3 Discussion and Disagreement Analysis 

Among the factors that lead to high inter-annotator alpha reliability and agreement rates are that: (1) 
the vast majority of negation is explicitly marked by negation particles that are easy to detect by hu-
man annotators; (2) the vast majority of triggers are used without any amplification or mitigation 
markers; and (3) punctuation markers are surprisingly informative for marking scope boundaries and 
direct quotations and, hence, holders. 

Sense-related disagreement is attributed to: (1) nominal triggers with main grammatical functions, 
(2) stative triggers, (3) opinionated-evidential triggers and (4) highly-polysemous triggers. 

The majority of epistemic triggers are adjunct constituents that add an extra-layer of meaning and 
can be removed without disturbing the syntactic structure of their propositions. Yet, in example 21, 
-AHtmAl (a possibility) is the grammatical subject of the proposition it modifies. Most of the ex احتمال
emplars from Section 2.1 are adjuncts and, thus, none can be both a lexical and a grammatical substi-
tute for احتمال AHtmAl (a possibility) in such a context.  

وھمي احتمال ]جديد رئيس منتخب يحل المجلس اثناء صياغة دستور[ان  احتمال .21  
AHtmAl An [r}ys mntxb yHl Almjls AvnA' SyAgp dstwr jdyd] AHtmAl whmy 
The possibility that [an elected president dissolves the parliament during the constitution's write-up] is 
an unrealistic possibility.  

Stative triggers such as يعرف yErf (he knows) and يدرك ydrk (he realizes) invoke disagreement as to 
whether they indicate the acquisition of new information; that is, they literally mean perceive, or they 
mark confirmed beliefs as in be sure that. For example 22, the annotators have two interpretations: (1) 
a non-modal interpretation that whoever says so does not perceive that the Supreme Guide cannot 
make resolutions without the Brotherhood, and (2) a modal interpretation that whoever says so does 
not believe that the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without the Brotherhood. 

]المرشد 0 يستطيع اخذ قرار دون الرجوع الى الجماعة[ان  يعرفالذي يقول ھذا الك6م 0  .22  
Al*y yqwl h*A AlklAm lA yErf An [Almr$d lA ystTyE Ax* qrAr dwn AlrjwE AlY AljmAEp]. 
Whoever says so does not perceive/believe that [the Supreme Guide cannot make resolutions without 
the Brotherhood].  

Opinionated-evidential triggers like يزعم yzEm (he claims) do not only mark reported speech, but al-
so they communicate the reporter's own opinion about the truth value of the reported proposition. They 
entail that from the reporter's perspective the proposition is FALSE. Hence, annotators disagree as to 
whether yzEm and similar triggers should be labeled as epistemic or not. We have eventually excluded 
such triggers as epistemic and have included them as evidential triggers for another corpus that is left 
for a future publication.  

Highly-polysemous triggers like يمكن ymkn (can/possible) lead to disagreement because in many cas-
es even the context is ambiguous. In example 23, both interpretations of it is not possible that (epis-
temic) and it is not doable that (abilitive) seem to be acceptable.  

23.  Sجنون الحكم"و" سرقات صغيرة: "مل الكتابين المجاورينا0 بتا" ثائر من الشرق"تاب مرسي فھم ك[ يمكن"[

"jnwn AlHkm"] 
It is not possible/doable [to understand Morsi's book - A Revolutionist from the East - without reading 
the other two books of Small Robberies and Ruling Mania]. 

Intensity-related disagreement is attributed to (1) intensity on the holder that propagates to the trig-
ger and (2) negation with moderate-intensity triggers. In example 24, the USER uses categorical nega-
tion on the holder  ي انسان عاقلا( يوجد  lA ywjd Ay AnsAn EAql (there is no one sane person). For some 
annotators, the power of categorical negation spreads to the trigger, moving its intensity up the scale. 
As for negation with moderate-intensity triggers, some annotators think that يمكن ) lA ymkn (not possi-
ble) is synonymous to impossible. Hence, they consider the negation as an amplification marker.  

]ا0رھاب يعالج بالسياسة[بأن  يعتقد0 يوجد أي انسان عاقل  .24

There is no one sane person who thinks that [terrorism can be defeated through politics].

Polarity-related disagreement is mainly caused by negation due to (1) negated holders and (2) con-
textual negation. Negated holders as in example 24 perplex the annotators as to whether the negation 
scopes over the holder only or both the holder and the trigger. Thus, for some annotators, يعتقد yEtqd 
(he thinks) is affirmative; and for others it is negative. By contextual negation we mean using words 
such as المشكلة Alm$klp (the problem) to describe triggers as in example 25. The USER says that the 
problem is to think that it is a small-scale conflict. To describe this as a problem means that the USER 
thinks of the proposition as FALSE; that is, according to the USER it is actually a large-scale conflict.  

  ]الصراع محصور فى الدائرة الضيقة اللى بنتحرك فيھا[إن  نتصورالمشكلة إننا  .25
Alm$klp <nnA ntSwr <n [AlSrAE mHSwr fY AldA}rp AlDyqp AllY bntHrk fyhA] 
The problem is to think that [the conflict is only happening at this small-scale we are working on]. 

Holder-related disagreement is attributed mainly to generic nouns and impersonal pronouns such as 
-AlwAHd (one). Some annotators interpret them as implicitly refer الواحد Al$Eb (the people) and الشعب
ring to the USER. Therefore, they select the USER as the only holder with zero nesting in example 26. 
Other annotators interpret them as referring to people in general but not necessarily with the USER in-
cluded; and thus, they select two-level nested holders.  

]تي باعضاء مجلس الشعب والرئيس القادمأالممارسة الديمقراطية ھى التي ست[ان  يعرفالشعب  .26  
Al$Eb yErf An [AlmmArsp AldymwqrATyp hy Alty st>ty bAEDA' mjls Al$Eb wAlr}ys AlqAdm] 

People know that [democracy will result in real parliamentary and presidential elections]. 

Scope-related disagreement is attributed to (1) ambiguous subordinate conjunctions, (2) triggers 
modifiers, (3) absent punctuation markers, and (4) embedding within the scope boundaries. For in-
stance, in example 27, the adverbial clause starting with بعد bEd (after) confuses the annotators as to 
whether it is part of the scope or it describes the verb epistemic trigger اتوقع AtwqE (I expect).

AlAmn] 

I very much expect that [the sit-in in Tahrir will be broken up in the same way as the last sit-in after 
seeing some strange faces at the security checkpoints].  

Tense yields almost perfect inter-annotator alpha reliability and agreement rates. The one main disa-
greement factor, however, is such contexts as ابتديت اصدق Abtdyt ASdq (I started to believe). While the 
majority of annotators agree that such contexts mark present tense knowledge, beliefs and judgments, 
some annotators consider them as past tense.  

5.4 Majority Statistics for 3arif 

Based on majority annotations, Table 3 gives statistics for 3arif in terms of sense, polarity, intensifica-
tion and tense. Furthermore, approximately 62% of the triggers have zero-nested holders (i.e. the Twit-
ter user is the same as the holder). As for scope syntactic structures, they are distributed as 86% claus-
es, 9% deverbal nouns and the rest are to-infinitives.

6 Related Work 

Epistemic modality has been the focus of many annotation projects for multiple languages. Diab et al. 
(2009) annotate three belief categories for English: (1) committed belief is when writers indicate that 
they hold propositions as TRUE, (2) non-committed belief is when writers hold propositions as FALSE, 
and (3) not applicable is when propositions are not denoting beliefs at all. Interest is given to writers' 
beliefs only. Thus, a default value for the modality holder is the writer, and nested holders are not an-

1530



notated. Their corpus contains 10k words of running text from different domains and genres, including 
newswire, blog data, email and letter correspondence and transcribed dialogue data. Inter-annotator 
agreement rate is 0.95 including the NONE category where no belief markers exist. 

Baker et al. (2010, 2012) simultaneously annotate modality and modality-based negation to build 
modality taggers to enhance Urdu-English machine translation systems. Their annotation scheme dis-
tinguishes eight modality types: requirements, permissions, success, effort, intention, ability, desires 
and beliefs. Originally, their annotation scheme labels three attributes for each modality type: triggers, 
holders and targets (i.e. scopes). Yet, holders have not been eventually labeled. A unique feature of 
their annotation scheme is using a simplified operational procedure to label modality semantic mean-
ings. The procedure relies on a list of thirteen choices of the form of H (modal) [P true/false] where H 
is a holder and P is a proposition or an event. The annotators' task is then to select the best form to rep-
resent the modality meaning of a given trigger. Reported kappa κ inter-annotator agreement rates are 
0.82 for triggers and 0.76 for targets.  

Rubinstein et al. (2013) propose a linguistically-motivated scheme for modality annotation in the 
MPQA English corpus. They attain macro alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.89 and 0.65 for 
sense and scope, respectively. Cui and Chi (2013) apply the same scheme from Rubinstein et al. 
(2013) to the Chinese Penn Treebank and get alpha inter-annotator reliability rates of 0.81and 0.39 for 
sense and scope annotation, respectively.  

Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013) annotate epistemic modality in MSA and EA tweets. We attain kappa inter-
annotator agreement rates of 0.90 and 0.93 for sense and scope annotation, respectively, for only 548 
epistemic tokens.  

Our annotation results, therefore, are comparable to the results in the literature. Furthermore, our an-
notation scheme is orthogonal to most of the aforementioned schemes. However, the key differences 
between our work and related work are:  

• We annotate nested modality, unlike Diab et al. (2009) and Baker et al. (2010, 2012).  

• We use a wider range of negation and intensification markers compared to prior work, especial-
ly Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013)  

• We use interactive crowdsourcing with simplified guidelines, unlike in-lab annotations includ-
ing Rubinstein et al. (2013) and Cui and Chi (2013), among others.  

7 Uncovered Points in 3arif 

The current version of 3arif does not cover modality entailment that example 28 illustrates. The USER 
criticizes whoever holds as TRUE the proposition that Egypt can blackmail UAE using the Iranian 
threat. This criticism entails that the USER holds the same proposition as FALSE. 

]ايران#بورقة  ا0ماراتمصر يمكن ان تساوم #[ان  يظنيخطئ من  .28  
yxTY' mn yZn An [#mSr ymkn An tsAwm #Al<mArAt bwrqp #<yrAn] 
Whoever thinks that [Egypt can blackmail #UAE using #Iran] is wrong. 

We do not also cover the future tense, the interrogative, the imperative or the hypothetical moods. 
This is because they have different interpretations when it comes to intensification and polarity that we 
do not cover in this version of 3arif but we will in future work.  

8 Conclusion 

We presented 3arif, a large-scale corpus annotated for epistemic modality in MSA and EA tweets. We 
used a simplified approach that defines each annotation task as a series of questions, implemented in-
teractively. Our scheme covers a wide range of the most common annotation units mentioned in the 
literature, including modality sense, polarity, intensification, tense, holders and scopes. We deal with 
nested holders that are crucial in a highly interactive genre such as tweets where users frequently quote 
others and make assumptions about them. We also automatically merge triggers with shared holders 
and scopes based on elicited annotators' answers. The annotation procedure yields reliable results and 
creates a novel resource for Arabic NLP. For future versions of the corpus, we plan to cover the points 

1531



from Section 7. 3arif will also be used to train and test an automatic machine learning system to iden-
tify epistemic modality and its attributes in MSA and EA tweets.
