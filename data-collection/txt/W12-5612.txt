Abstract: 
In this paper we attempt to study various case relations expressed by 

the case marker -ki/ku in Telugu. This paper represents a small 

fragment of our efforts at developing a parser  for  Telugu  based  on  

the  dependency  frame  work      a  la  Panini.    Though, traditionally 

the case marked by -ku/-ki is usually called as the dative case, 

there are a number of semantic/case relations it expresses. Our 

hypothesis is that it is possible to identify and thereby predict 

various functions performed by the case marker -ki/-ku in Telugu 

based on the semantic properties of the nouns and Verbs involved. 

Such linguistic  inputs  help  in  machine  learning  and  building  

parsers  for  Telugu  for computational purposes.  

 

1. Introduction:  Telugu, a major Dravidian language, spoken mostly in South India is 

a morphologically complex language. Various grammatical categories like case, gender, 

number and person are morphologically encoded and serve as strong cues for 

identifying the syntactico-semantic relations between the various parts of a sentence.   

Paninian framework which is based on dependency relations is considered the most 

suitable for analysing languages like Telugu (Rafiya Begum eT: al., 2008).  This paper 

confines itself to examining the dative suffix -ki/ -ku in Telugu, because this appears to 

be the most ambiguous of all the case markers exhibiting as many as 16 meaning 

relations.  Dative is the common denominator   used while referring to the relations 

realized by the suffix -ki/ -ku.  The  various  functions  performed  by  the  case  marker 

 -ki/ku  have  been  discussed  extensively  in  the  traditional  grammars  of  Telugu  

such  as Bala  Vyaakaranam  and Proudha  Vyaakaranam  and  in  the  modern  

grammars  (Arden  1927;  Campbell 1817;  Krishnamurti & Gwynn   1985;  Ramarao   

1975 ) as well. Nouns case marked for dative  have also been studied in the generative 

frame work proposed by Chomsky (Subbarao  & Bhaskara Rao  2004).  We propose to 

devise, an algorithm for the purpose of implementing a rule based procedure 

predicting the suffix -ki/-ku on the basis of the ontological properties  of the nouns to 

which these case markers are attached  to as well as those of verbs  in the sentence.  

 

The road map of the paper is as follows: Section 1 introduces the objectives of the 

study; Section 2 spells out the approach we have adopted while analyzing the data; 

Section 3 provides examples from the data under each head classified; Section  4 

provides the algorithm  while  Section 5  summarizes  the  results  in  the  form  of 

conclusion.

2. Methodology: Dative nouns are considered for the interpretation of their 

semantic relation for the present purpose. The data are classified into several 

categories based on the semantic features of the nouns in the context of other nouns in a 

sentence.  A set of semantic features like [+/-animate], [+/-human], [+/-abstract], 

[+/-NST], [+/-Nouns of Cognition], [+ /- Nouns of Psych. State], [+/ - Nouns of Phys.  

state] etc.  are used for identifying the co-occurring n0uns. In the following sections we 

illustrate how we arrive at the various functions performed by the dative marker 

-ki/-ku based on our hypothesis. 

 

3.  Classification of Data: 

3. 1.   The data are classified into various sets on the basis of the above 

mentioned   criteria:  

Set 1:   In this set we consider examples where the dative noun, which is [+animate], 

co-occurs with a noun  that denotes psychological state indicated by the nouns, 

kopaM, ‘anger’, BayaM ‘fea’ AscaryaM ‘surprise’ asahyaM  ‘hatred’  prema ’love’  picci ‘lunacy’  
etc. The outcome is that the dative suffix denotes a psychological state.  

 
 1.    T: ravi-ki cIkati aMte BayaM.  

Ravi-to darkness means fear.   

Ravi  is afraid of darkness 

2.    T:     Ravi-ki BayaM vesiMxi.  

Ravi-to fear-3p. sg. nm feel-3p. sg. nm  

Ravi is scared 

Psychological nouns can occur either predicatively as in (1) or as objects as in example  

(2).  The  dative noun  in  both the  cases functions  as  an  experiencer.  Therefore only 

animate nouns can co-occur with nouns denoting psychological states and function 

as dative subjects.  

 

Set 2: Nouns case marked for dative co-occurring with nouns denoting somatic 

states like noppi ‘pain’,  jwaraM ‘fever’ jabbu ‘illness’,  Akali ‘hunger, xAhaM  ‘thirst’,  ruci ‘taste’ etc. 
also denote a    ‘physiological state’. Here too the Dative noun is an animate noun. 
Consider the following examples:  

3.   T: ravi-ki Akali vesiMxi.  

ravi-to hunger feel-pst-3p. sg. nm  

Ravi is hungry 

4.   T: ravi-ki jabbu cesiMxi.  

ravi-to illness do-pst-3p. sg. nm 

Ravi is sick 

5.   T: ravi-ki walanoVppi vacciMxi 

ravi-to headache come-pst-3p. sg. nm 

Ravi had a headache 

124



6.   T: awani-ki kalYlYu kanipiMcataMlexu.  

he-to      eyes see-not-3p. sg. nm 

He cannot see 

7.   T: awani-ki cewulu AdataMlevu 

he-to hands    working-not-3p. pl. nh 

His hands are not working 

8.   T: nA-ku burra paniceyataMlexu 

I-to mind work-not-3p. sg. nm 

My mind is not working 

 

Set 3: Dative NPs when they combine with nouns that involve cognitive processes 

like acquiring of skills or learning and perceiving, denote a cognitive state. Normally, 

verbs of cognition like weVlusu ‘to know’, abbu ‘ to be acquired’,  vaccu which literally 
means ‘to come’  occur as verbs with these nouns. The animacy requirement on the part 
of the dative noun holds in this case as well.  

9.   T: nA-ku kAr drEviMg vaccu 

me-to    car    driving    know 

I know car driving 

10.  T: nAku vAlYlYu weVlusu 

me-to  they know 

I know them  

11.    T:  cinnanAti allari  awani-ki gurwuku vacciMxi  

 childhood pranks he-to remember come-pst-3p. sg. nm  

He recalled his childhood pranks 

 

In the above three sets, the dative NP functions as an experiencer.   Therefore,  it is 

possible to state  that  whenever  the  non-dative  noun indicates one of  

psychological, physiological  and cognitive  states the dative  noun always functions 

as an experiencer noun.  

 

Set 4: In this set we include all those non-dative nouns which are temporal by 

nature. The dative marker in this case expresses age or a chronological state.  

12.  T: ravi-ki iravE elYlYu 

Ravi-to twenty years  

Ravi is twenty years old 

13.  T:     I edAxi-wo mA pApa-ki paxelYlYu niMduwAyi 

this year-with our daughter-to ten years complete-fut-3p. pl. nh 

With this year, our daughter will be ten years old 

14.  T:      pUjAri-ki vayasu mIxapadiMxi 

Priest-to   age advance-pst-3p. sg. nm 

The priest became old 

However, the dative noun belonging to this set can also be an inanimate one as in 

125



the following.  

15.  T: cArminAr-ki I mArc-ki   nAlugu vaMxala  yelYlYu niMduwAyi  

Charminar-to  march-to  two hundred years complete  

By this March,  Charminar will complete  four hundred years 

If the dative noun is an inanimate one as in (15),  it cannot be an experiencer noun.  

 

Set 5: The dative noun in this set co-occurs with nouns which are kinship terms 

like akka  ‘elder  sister’, anna  ‘elder  brother’,  awwa  ‘aunt’  etc.  The  dative  marker  here 
expresses kinship relation.’ 

16.  T: ravi     nA-ku     wammudu 

ravi I-to younger brother  

Ravi is my younger brother  

 

Though the first noun ravi is case marked for dative, it is possible to have 

genitive relationship between the two nouns as in the following:  

17.  T:      ravi   nA wammudu 

ravi my younger brother  

Ravi is my younger brother 

 

The dative marker -ki/-ku expresses   an adnominal relationship between the two 

nouns. In the presence of a predicate agu/avvu ‘be or happen’, the relationship 
expressed is more marked.  It  expresses  a  distant  relationship  and  not  an  immediate  

one  to  the individual’s   family (Cf.   Subbarao    and Bhaskararao  2004) . 
18.  T:      ravi nA-ku wammudu avuwAdu 

ravi I-to  younger brother become-3p. sg. m  

ravi is my younger brother (cousin ,  not a sibling)  

 

Set 6: Under this set, we include examples where the dative noun is [+animate] and 

its co-occurring noun  is  [+concrete].  Here, the  relationship  expressed  is  

possessive.  It  is possible  to  distinguish  between  alienable  and  inalienable  

possessions  based  on  the semantics of the non –dative  nouns.  
19.  T: nA-ku reVMdu kArlu unnAyi  

I-to two cars-have-3p. pl. nh 

I have two cars 

Alternatively  it is  also possible to say: 

20.  T: nA xaggira reMdu kArlunnAyi  

Me-near two cars-have-3p. pl. nh. 

I have two cars 

The possibility of substituting the dative case marker with locative indicates 

alienable possession.  Consider the following examples where such a substitution is 

not possible:  

126



21.  T: vAdi-ki battawala uMxi 

He-to baldhead have-3p. sg. nm.  

He has a baldhead  

22. T:     *vAdi xaggara battawala uMxi 

he         near        bald head has-3p. sg. nm.  

He has bald head with him 

 

Substitution of one case marker for another in (22) is not possible because the 

noun possessed cannot be alienated from the possessor. Nichols (1992 as quoted in 

Subbarao   2004)  proposes  that  inalienable  possession  typically  include  kin  terms, 

part/wholes and or body parts .  

 

Set 7:   The   dative noun when it co-occurs with a noun marked for the semantic 

feature  [-Abstract] the dative marker expresses beneficiary relationship.  

23.  T:      ravi-ki uwwaraM vacciMxi  

ravi-to letter come-pst-3p. sg. nm.  

Ravi got a letter  

  24.  T: awaniki lAtarIlo paxi lakRalu vaccAyi 

He-to lottery-in ten lakhs come-pst-3p. pl. nh.  

He won ten lakh rupees in a lottery 

One common feature between this set and sets 1-3 is that the dative noun in all 

these sets is an animate noun. However the similarity ends here because the dative 

noun of this set unlike the other earlier sets is not an experiencer noun. It is rather 

the recipient or beneficiary of some concrete entity as in examples 23 and 24.  

 

Set 8: This set represents yet another combination of a dative noun and a 

non-dative noun wherein both the nouns are concrete nouns. The predicate is always 

a be-form verb uMdu in these sentences.  

25. T: A gaxi-ki reVMdu kitikIlu unnAyi  

That room-to windows has-3p. pl. nh.  

That room has two windows 

26. T: mA iMti-ki praharIgoda uMxi  

Our house-to compound-wall has-3p. sg. nm  

Our house has a compound wall 

The relationship between these two nouns is that of part and whole relation.  

 

Set 9: The dative marker -ki/-ku expresses the relationship of proportionality (a sort 

of x: y) when both the nouns are concrete nouns:  

27.  T:  rUpAyi-ki vaMxa pEsalu (uMtAyi).  

Rupee-to hundred paise be-3p. pl. nh.  

A rupee has hundred paise  

127



28. T:      heVktAru-ki pAwika  baswAla   xigubadi    vaswuMxi.  

Hectare-to     twenty five bags     yield come-hab/fuT: / 3p/sg/nh. 

Each hectare gets a yield of twenty five bags 

So far, we have categorized the data on the basis of the semantic features of the 

dative nouns and the other nouns co-occurring with the dative. However since we 

have come across a number of examples wherein the semantics of the verb also plays a 

crucial role in determining the function of the dative noun, the semantics of the 

verb also is considered for the purpose of classifying the data.  

 

3. 2.  In the following sections we show the various functions performed by the 

dative marker on the basis of the semantic nature of the verb along with the 

semantic features of the nouns involved.  

Set1:  The     dative noun when it occurs  as  the  indirect  object  of  a ditransitive verb  

(eg. verbs of giving/taking)      becomes the beneficiary of the action indicated by 

the verb.  

29. T: nenu ravi-ki kAPI iccAnu  

I ravi-to coffee give-pst-1p/sg.  

I gave coffee to Ravi  

Here the dative expresses the function of sampradana the proto-typical role 

associated with the dative case  in the traditional grammars  (cf. 

Balavyakaranam). For a noun to become a beneficiary it is necessary that it is an 

animate one.  

Set 2:  Verbs  of  communication  like  ceVppu  ‘to  tell’,  weVliyajeyu   ‘to  inform’,  
vivariMcu   ‘to  explain’ require  that  the  indirect object  to be case marked for dative.  

30.  T:  nenu      amma-ki        parisWiwulu    vivariMcAnu  
I            mother -to     circumstances  explain-pst-1p/sg.  
I explained the circumstances to mother 

31.  T:      awanu nA-ku    abaxXaM   ceVppAdu  
 He          me-to   lie        tell-pst-3p. sg. m.  
He told me a lie  

 

Set3:   When the dative marked NP is a locative noun and the verb is one of motion/ 

movement, then the dative noun expresses goal or destination.  

 

32. T:  bAbu  skUl-ki         velYlYAdu  

Boy       school-to    go-pst-3p. sg. m.  

The boy went to the school 

33. T:       nenu   samayAniki     APIsu-ki    cerukunnAnu  

I           time-to           office-to      reach-pst-1p/sg.  

I reached office on time 

128



 

However if the place name is specified, the locative noun is not marked for the dative:  

34. T: nenu repu     viSAKapatnaM / *viSAKapatnaM-ki    velYuwunnAnu  

I       tomorrow Visakhapatnam /*Visakhapatnam-to go-fut-1p/sg.  

I am going to Visakhapatnam tomorrow 

Set 4: If the dative noun is a generic noun of space (direction) it indicates direction as 

in the following:  

  35.  T:      pakka-ki wirugu 

Sideways-to turn 

turn aside 

36.  T: veVnak-ki malYlu  

Backwards-to turn.  

Turn back 

 

Set 5:   If the subject is a named entity i. e. a place name and the dative noun is either 

an animate or an inanimate noun and the verb is  'to be famous, well known, well 

noted’  etc. it indicates the meaning relation ‘this place is famous/well known/noted  
for X’.  

 

37.   T: kaMci pattu cIrala-ku prasixXi ceVMxiMxi  

Kanchi silk sarees-to famous-be-3p. sg. 

nm. Kanchi is famous for silk sarees 

38.  T: oVMgolu      giwwala-ki    prasixXi  ceVMxiMxi 

Ongole             bull-to              famous-   be-3p. 

sg. nm. Ongole is famous for bulls 

It is interesting to note that in the above examples, the non-dative noun is always 

a locative  noun.  

 

Set 6:  In this case the dative noun when it combines with event nouns like 

snAnaM ‘bath’ potI  ‘competition’ etc.  it functions as a purposive, indicating the meaning 
‘in order to’ perform the action denoted by the noun.  

39. T:      ravi snAnAni-ki veVlYlYAdu  

Ravi bath-to go-pst-3p. sg. m.  

Ravi went to bathe 

40. T: awanu  eVlakRanlalo    potIki sixXaM    avuwunnAdu  

He       elections-in   contest-to ready-be-prog-3p. 

sg.m.  He   is preparing to contest the elections 

 

Set 7:  When the dative noun is a temporal noun and the subject is either an animate 

or an inanimate noun it indicates temporal goal which brings in a change of state 

129



of the subject noun  as a result of the action indicated by the verb as in the following:  

41.  T: nenu repati-ki cerukuMtAnu 

Itomorrow-to reach-fut-1p/sg.  

I will reach by tomorrow 

42. T:      palYlYu repatiki magguwAyi  

Fruits tomorrow-to ripe-pst-3p. pl. nh.  

The fruits will ripen by tomorrow 

 

Set 8: In this set the dative noun which denotes a ‘Force of nature’   functions as a 
cause or reason:  

43. T: ceVtlu gAliki padipoyAyi  

Trees wind-to fall-pst-3p. pl. nh.  

Trees have been uprooted by the wind 

44. T:      puvvulu eVMda-ki vadilipoyAyi 

Flowers  sunlight-to wither-pst-3p. pl. nh.  

The flowers withered due to the sunlight 

 

The various steps  to be followed by a parsing mechanism are:  

1.  Take a sentence as the  input  

2.  Check for the Noun Phrase case marked for Dative in the sentence  

3.  Check whether the dative case marked noun is a +/- animate noun  

4.  Check for the Noun Phrase which is ˜Dative  
5.  Check the Ontological features of the ˜Dative nouns  
6.  Check the Ontological features of the verbs  

7.  Check the various combinations that a noun case marked for dative enters     

      into  with other nouns and verb in the sentence. 

The  above  steps  enable  us  to  determine  the  resultant  output  of  each  of  

these combinations  as  belonging  to  one  of  the  sixteen  states  mentioned  in  

Section  3 (as mentioned  in  the  various  Sets).  For example if the dative noun    

combines with a non-dative noun which is marked for the ontological feature 

[+Psych. St] the resultant state is a psychological state.

5.  Conclusions:  

From the above discussion the following conclusions can be drawn:  It is possible to 

predict the various functions of the  -ki/-ku  based on  the semantic features of the 

verbs and nouns involved in the sentence. Identifying the contexts in which the 

dative nouns occur reveals that seventeen types of functions possible in Telugu.  

  

The  above  classification  along  with  a  well  specified  data  base  comprising  of  

a morphological analyzer, Parts of Speech Tagger, Chunker and a well defined 

lexicon specified for ontological features as we have used in the analysis will help in 

building a robust parser  for Telugu.
