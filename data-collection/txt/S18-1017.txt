Abstract

Emotion classification is a new task that com-
bines several disciplines including Artificial
Intelligence and Psychology, although Natural
Language Processing is perhaps the most cha-
llenging area. In this paper, we describe our
participation in SemEval-2018 Task1: Affect
in Tweets. In particular, we have participated
in EI-oc, EI-reg and E-c subtasks for English
and Spanish languages.

1. Introduction

Emotions are playing a significant role in the ef-
fective communication of people. In fact, some-
times, emotional intelligence is more important
than cognitive intelligence for successful interac-
tion (Pantic et al., 2005). Therefore, affective com-
puting is a key element to the advancement of Arti-
ficial Intelligence. The basic task of affective com-
puting is emotion recognition. This task consists
of identifying a set of emotions in a document.

The identification of emotions in texts has multi-
ple benefits in different areas, such as psychology
to detect some psychological disorder like depres-
sion (Cherry et al., 2012), e-learning to improve
student motivation (Suero Montero and Suhonen,
2014) or business intelligence to know the prefe-
rences of consumers (Cambria, 2016).

Currently, more and more people express their
emotions on social media, such as Twitter or Fa-
cebook. Therefore, the role of emotion in social
media is becoming more important for the resear-
chers in affective computing.

In this paper, we present the different systems we
developed as part of our participation in SemEval-
2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets (Mohammad et al.,
2018). We have participated in EI-oc, EI-reg and

E-c subtasks for English and Spanish. Below, we
briefly describe these subtasks:

EI-oc is an emotion intensity ordinal classi-
fication task. Given a tweet and an emotion
E, it consists of classifying the tweet into one
of four ordinal classes of intensity of E that
best represents the mental state of the twee-
ter. Separate datasets are provided for anger,
fear, joy, and sadness emotions.

EI-reg is an emotion intensity regression
task. Given a tweet and an emotion E, it con-
sists of determining the intensity of E that
best represents the mental state of the tweeter.
The intensity of E is a real-valued score bet-
ween 0 (least emotion) and 1 (most emotion).
Separate datasets are provided for anger, fear,
joy, and sadness emotions.

E-c is an emotion multi-classification task.
Given a tweet, it consists of classifying it as
’neutral’ or ’no emotion’ or as one, or more,
of eleven given emotions (anger, anticipation,
disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism,
sadness, surprise, trust) that best represent the
mental state of the tweeter.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we explain the data used in our methods.
Section 3 describes the resources used by our sys-
tems. Section 4 presents the details of the proposed
systems. Section 5 displays the results and analy-
ses them. We conclude in Section 6 with remarks
on future work.

2. Data

To run our experiments, we used the datasets pro-
vided by the task organizers (Mohammad et al.,
2018) as follows. During pre-evaluation period,

128



we trained our models on the train set, and eva-
luated our different approaches on the dev set. Du-
ring evaluation period, we trained our models on
the train and dev sets, and tested the model on the
test set. Table 1 shows the number of tweets for
each language and subtask dataset.

task dataset

3. Resources

For the development of the task, we used different
lexicons that we explain in detail below.

Wordnet-Affect (WNA) (Strapparava et al.,
2004). This resource is an extension of Word-
Net Domains. WNA provides a set of En-
glish emotional words organized in a tree.
The leaf nodes represent specific emotions
that are grouped into general categories (pa-
rent nodes). For example, anger, hate and dis-
like belong to the overall emotion general-
dislike. However, the emotions of WNA are
not the same as the emotions of the SemEval
subtasks. For this reason, each overall emo-
tion of WNA has been mapped with SemEval
subtasks emotions (see Appendix A, Table 8
and Table 9).

In order to use this resource in Spanish, we
have employed the lexical disambiguator Ba-
belfy (Moro et al., 2014) to obtain the corres-
ponding BalbelNet synset id of a term. Next,
we have used the BabelNet API (Navigli and
Ponzetto, 2012) to obtain a corresponden-
ce between the BalbelNet synset id and the
WordNet synset id. WNA includes a subset of
appropriate synsets of WordNet 1.6 to repre-
sent affective concepts. However, the Word-
Net synsets id obtained with BabelNet API
corresponds to the 3.0 version of WordNet.
Therefore, we have obtained the equivalent
synset to the 3.0 version in the 1.6 version.
With this, using the synset of the 1.6 version

of WordNet, we can map directly the associa-
ted emotion and confident value from WNA.

Spanish Emotion Lexicon (SEL) (Sidorov
et al., 2012). It includes 2,036 Spanish words
that are associated with the measure of Proba-
bility Factor of Affective use (PFA) with res-
pect to at least one basic emotion: joy, anger,
fear, sadness, surprise, and disgust. The hig-
her the value of the PFA, the more probable
the association of the word with the emotion
is.

NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon (Moham-
mad, 2017). It has almost 6,000 entries in En-
glish. Each of them has an intensity score as-
sociated to one of the following basic emo-
tions: anger, fear, sadness and joy. The sco-
res range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that
the word has a high association to the emo-
tion and 0 that the word has a low association
to the emotion. However, this resource is not
in Spanish. For this reason, we have adapted
it to Spanish in the following way. We have
translated English terms to Spanish and we
have selected the maximum value of intensity
if the translation of some terms is the same.

NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon
(EmoLex) (Mohammad and Turney, 2010).
This lexicon has a list of English words asso-
ciated to one or more of the following emo-
tions: anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surpri-
se, sadness, joy. Moreover, the lexicon is also
available for more than one hundred langua-
ges (including Spanish). All these versions
have been generated by translating the En-
glish terms using Google Translate.

4. System description

In this section we describe the systems developed
for the subtasks EI-oc, EI-reg and E-c.

In first place, we preprocessed the corpus of tweets
provided for each subtask and language (English
and Spanish). We applied the following preproces-
sing steps: the documents were tokenized using
NLTK TweetTokenizer1, stemming was perfor-
med using NLTK Snowball stemmer2, stopwords

tokenize.html

2http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/

129



were removed (only for English), and all letters
were converted to lower-case.

In relation to the resources, we have tested several
combinations. However, for the final SemEval sys-
tems we have used the best systems obtained du-
ring the development phase. For EI-oc and EI-reg
subtasks in Spanish, we used SEL, NRC Affect In-
tensity and WNA lexicons adapted to the emotions
of these subtasks. On the other hand, for English,
we used NRC Affect Intensity and WNA lexicons
adapted to the emotions of the EI-oc and EI-reg
subtasks. Regarding to subtask E-c, for Spanish,
we used SEL, EmoLex Spanish version and WNA
lexicons adapted to the emotions of this subtask.
However, for English, we used Emolex and WNA
lexicon adapted to the emotions of the E-c subtask.

Next, it is described the methodology used for
each subtask:

Subtask EI-oc. To perform the classification,
we checked the presence of lexicon terms in
the tweet and then we added the intensity va-
lue of these words grouping them by the emo-
tional category (anger, fear, sadness and joy).
The result is a vector of four values for each
lexicon. Moreover, each tweet is represented
as a vector of unigrams using the TF-IDF
weighting scheme. The union of the lexicon
vectors and the TF-IDF representation of the
tweet are used as features for the classifica-
tion using the SVM algorithm. We selected
the SVM formulation, known as C-SVC, the
value of the C parameter was 1.0 and the ker-
nel chosen was the linear.

Subtask EI-reg. In this case, we checked
the presence of lexicon terms in the tweet
and then we computed the sum, the average
and the maximum of the intensity value of
the words of the tweet grouping them by the
emotional category (anger, fear, sadness and
joy). The result is a vector of twelve values
for each lexicon. The union of the lexicon
vectors and the TF-IDF representation of the
tweet are used as features for the classifica-
tion using the SVM algorithm with the same
configuration as that used in subtask EI-oc.

Subtask E-c. In this subtask, we identified
the presence of lexicon terms in the tweet
and we assigned 1 as confidence value (CV).

stem/snowball.html

Then, we summed the CV of the words who-
se emotion is the same obtaining a vector of
emotions for each lexicon. The union of these
vectors and the TF-IDF representation of the
tweet are used as features for the classifica-
tion using the Random Forest algorithm with
25 as number of trees.

5. Analysis of results

The official competition metric to evaluate the sys-
tems in EI-reg and EI-oc subtasks is the Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between semantic
similarity scores of machine assigned and human
judgments. In the case of the E-c subtask, systems
are evaluated by calculating multi-label accuracy.
Since this is a multi-label classification task, each
tweet can have one or more gold emotion labels,
and one or more predicted emotion labels. Multi-
label accuracy is defined as the size of the intersec-
tion of the predicted and gold label sets divided by
the size of their union. This measure is calculated
for each tweet, and then is averaged over all the
tweets in the dataset.

The results of our participation in the three sub-
tasks and those of the teams that are in the first and
the last position can be seen in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7. It should be noted that the results of Spanish
subtasks are lower than those obtained for English.
Another important issue is that the participation in
Spanish subtasks is lower than the participation in
English subtasks. These facts are due to most of
the works and resources for textual emotion mi-
ning are in English (Yadollahi et al., 2017).

In relation to our results, in most subtasks we ob-
tained the lowest correlation on anger emotion and
the best correlation on joy emotion. On the con-
trary, in WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion
Intensity (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017),
most of the systems performed better on anger
emotion and worse on fear and sadness emotions.
In this competition, it was found that despite using
deep learning techniques, training data, and large
amounts of unlabeled data, the best systems inclu-
ded features from affect lexicons. Given that, we
plan to analyze the recall of the lexicons used in
our experiments and to explore new lexicons in or-
der to improve the classification.

On the other hand, it should be noted that we
achieved higher ranking positions for Spanish sub-

130



tasks. In particular, our best participation has been
in the E-c subtask. An important difference found
between the classification in both languages was
that taking stopwords into consideration contribu-
tes to the emotion classification for Spanish while
the opposite occurs for English. Therefore, we will
further study this issue in order to incorporate an
specific treatment to those stopwords that can mo-
dify the meaning of a sentence, such as negators,
intensifiers and diminishers.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented the systems de-
veloped for our participation in 3 subtasks (EI-oc,
EI-reg, E-c) of SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in
Tweets. We have addressed these subtasks in two
of the three available languages, English and Spa-
nish. Overall, we have obtained better results in
Spanish subtasks than in English subtasks. In futu-
re works, we plan to continue working on emotion
recognition in Spanish because we have obser-
ved that the participation in this language is very
low, although it is the second most spoken langua-
ge. Our next study will focus on exploring mo-
re affect lexicons because in WASSA-2017 Sha-
red Task on Emotion Intensity (Mohammad and
Bravo-Marquez, 2017), it was demonstrated that
using features from affect lexicons is beneficial for
this task. Moreover, we will study the use of stop-
words in Spanish because in the development pha-
se it was observed that stopwords contribute to the
emotion classification.
