Abstract

This talk presents two NLP systems that were developed for helping disaster victims and res-
cue workers in the aftermath of large-scale disasters. DISAANA provides answers to questions
such as “What is in short supply in Tokyo?” and displays locations related to each answer on a
map. D-SUMM automatically summarizes a large number of disaster related reports concern-
ing a specified area and helps rescue workers to understand disaster situations from a macro
perspective. Both systems are publicly available as Web services. In the aftermath of the 2016
Kumamoto Earthquake (M7.0), the Japanese government actually used DISAANA to analyze the
situation.
