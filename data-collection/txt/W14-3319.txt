Abstract
This paper presents the machine trans-
lation systems submitted by the Abu-
MaTran project to the WMT 2014 trans-
lation task. The language pair concerned
is English–French with a focus on French
as the target language. The French to En-
glish translation direction is also consid-
ered, based on the word alignment com-
puted in the other direction. Large lan-
guage and translation models are built us-
ing all the datasets provided by the shared
task organisers, as well as the monolin-
gual data from LDC. To build the trans-
lation models, we apply a two-step data
selection method based on bilingual cross-
entropy difference and vocabulary satura-
tion, considering each parallel corpus in-
dividually. Synthetic translation rules are
extracted from the development sets and
used to train another translation model.
We then interpolate the translation mod-
els, minimising the perplexity on the de-
velopment sets, to obtain our final SMT
system. Our submission for the English to
French translation task was ranked second
amongst nine teams and a total of twenty
submissions.

1 Introduction

This paper presents the systems submitted by the
Abu-MaTran project (runs named DCU-Prompsit-
UA) to the WMT 2014 translation task for the
English–French language pair. Phrase-based sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) systems were
submitted, considering the two translation direc-
tions, with the focus on the English to French di-
rection. Language models (LMs) and translation

models (TMs) are trained using all the data pro-
vided by the shared task organisers, as well as
the Gigaword monolingual corpora distributed by
LDC.

To train the LMs, monolingual corpora and the
target side of the parallel corpora are first used
individually to train models. Then the individ-
ual models are interpolated according to perplex-
ity minimisation on the development sets.

To train the TMs, first a baseline is built us-
ing the News Commentary parallel corpus. Sec-
ond, each remaining parallel corpus is processed
individually using bilingual cross-entropy differ-
ence (Axelrod et al., 2011) in order to sepa-
rate pseudo in-domain and out-of-domain sen-
tence pairs, and filtering the pseudo out-of-
domain instances with the vocabulary saturation
approach (Lewis and Eetemadi, 2013). Third,
synthetic translation rules are automatically ex-
tracted from the development set and used to train
another translation model following a novel ap-
proach (Sánchez-Cartagena et al., 2014). Finally,
we interpolate the four translation models (base-
line, in-domain, filtered out-of-domain and rules)
by minimising the perplexity obtained on the de-
velopment sets and investigate the best tuning and
decoding parameters.

The reminder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: the datasets and tools used in our experi-
ments are described in Section 2. Then, details
about the LMs and TMs are given in Section 3 and
Section 4 respectively. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of the final SMT system according to
different tuning and decoding parameters in Sec-
tion 5 before presenting conclusions in Section 6.

2 Datasets and Tools

We use all the monolingual and parallel datasets
in English and French provided by the shared task
organisers, as well as the LDC Gigaword for the
same languages1. For each language, a true-case
model is trained using all the data, using the train-
truecaser.perl script included in the MOSES tool-
kit (Koehn et al., 2007).

Punctuation marks of all the monolingual and
parallel corpora are then normalised using the
script normalize-punctuation.perl provided by the
organisers, before being tokenised and true-cased
using the scripts distributed with the MOSES tool-
kit. The same pre-processing steps are applied to
the development and test sets. As development
sets, we used all the test sets from previous years
of WMT, from 2008 to 2013 (newstest2008-2013).

Finally, the training parallel corpora are cleaned
using the script clean-corpus-n.perl, keeping the
sentences longer than 1 word, shorter than 80
words, and with a length ratio between sentence
pairs lower than 4.2 The statistics about the cor-
pora used in our experiments after pre-processing
are presented in Table 1.

For training LMs we use KENLM (Heafield et
al., 2013) and the SRILM tool-kit (Stolcke et al.,
2011). For training TMs, we use MOSES (Koehn
et al., 2007) version 2.1 with MGIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003; Gao and Vogel, 2008). These tools are
used with default parameters for our experiments
except when explicitly said.

The decoder used to generate translations is
MOSES using features weights optimised with
MERT (Och, 2003). As our approach relies on
training individual TMs, one for each parallel cor-
pus, our final TM is obtained by linearly interpo-
lating the individual ones. The interpolation of
TMs is performed using the script tmcombine.py,
minimising the cross-entropy between the TM
and the concatenated development sets from 2008
to 2012 (noted newstest2008-2012), as described
in Sennrich (2012). Finally, we make use of the
findings from WMT 2013 brought by the win-
ning team (Durrani et al., 2013) and decide to use
the Operation Sequence Model (OSM), based on
minimal translation units and Markov chains over
sequences of operations, implemented in MOSES

ity between English and French.

3 Language Models

The LMs are trained in the same way for both
languages. First, each monolingual and parallel
corpus is considered individually (except the par-
allel version of Europarl and News Commentary)
and used to train a 5-gram LM with the modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing method. We then interpo-
late the individual LMs using the script compute-
best-mix available with the SRILM tool-kit (Stol-
cke et al., 2011), based on their perplexity scores
on the concatenation of the development sets from
2008 to 2012 (the 2013 version is held-out for the
tuning of the TMs).

The final LM for French contains all the word
sequences from 1 to 5-grams contained in the
training corpora without any pruning. However,
with the computing resources at our disposal, the
English LMs could not be interpolated without
pruning non-frequent n-grams. Thus, n-grams
with n ∈ [3; 5] with a frequency lower than 2 were
removed. Details about the final LMs are given in
Table 2.

4 Translation Models

In this Section, we describe the TMs trained for
the shared task. First, we present the two-step data
selection process which aims to (i) separate in and
out-of-domain parallel sentences and (ii) reduce
the total amount of out-of-domain data. Second,
a novel approach for the automatic extraction of
translation rules and their use to enrich the phrase
table is detailed.

4.1 Parallel Data Filtering and Vocabulary
Saturation

Amongst the parallel corpora provided by the
shared task organisers, only News Commentary
can be considered as in-domain regarding the de-
velopment and test sets. We use this training
corpus to build our baseline SMT system. The
other parallel corpora are individually filtered us-
ing bilingual cross-entropy difference (Moore and
Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011). This data
filtering method relies on four LMs, two in the
source and two in the target language, which
aim to model particular features of in and out-of-
domain sentences.

We build the in-domain LMs using the source
and target sides of the News Commentary paral-
lel corpus. Out-of-domain LMs are trained on a
vocabulary-constrained subset of each remaining
parallel corpus individually using the SRILM tool-
kit, which leads to eight models (four in the source
language and four in the target language).3

3The subsets contain the same number of sentences and
the same vocabulary as News Commentary.

Then, for each out-of-domain parallel corpus,
we compute the bilingual cross-entropy difference
of each sentence pair as:

[Hin(Ssrc)−Hout(Ssrc)] + [Hin(Strg)−Hout(Strg)] (1)

where Ssrc and Strg are the source and the tar-
get sides of a sentence pair, Hin and Hout are
the cross-entropies of the in and out-of-domain
LMs given a sentence pair. The sentence pairs are
then ranked and the lowest-scoring ones are taken
to train the pseudo in-domain TMs. However,
the cross-entropy difference threshold required to
split a corpus in two parts (pseudo in and out-of-
domain) is usually set empirically by testing sev-
eral subset sizes of the top-ranked sentence pairs.
This method is costly in our setup as it would lead
to training and evaluating multiple SMT systems
for each of the pseudo in-domain parallel corpora.

In order to save time and computing power,
we consider only pseudo in-domain sentence pairs
those with a bilingual cross-entropy difference be-
low 0, i.e. those deemed more similar to the
in-domain LMs than to the out-of-domain LMs
(Hin < Hout). A sample of the distribution of
scores for the out-of-domain corpora is shown in
Figure 1. The resulting pseudo in-domain corpora
are used to train individual TMs, as detailed in Ta-
ble 3.

The results obtained using the pseudo in-
domain data show BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
scores superior or equal to the baseline score.
Only the Europarl subset is slightly lower than
the baseline, while the subset taken from the 109

corpus reaches the highest BLEU compared to the
other systems (30.29). This is mainly due to the

173



size of this subset which is ten times larger than
the one taken from Europarl. The last row of Ta-
ble 3 shows the BLEU score obtained after interpo-
lating the four pseudo in-domain translation mod-
els. This system outperforms the best pseudo in-
domain one by 0.5 absolute points.

stest2013 for the pseudo in-domain corpora ob-
tained by filtering the out-of-domain corpora with
bilingual cross-entropy difference. The interpola-
tion of pseudo in-domain models is evaluated in
the last row.

After evaluating the pseudo in-domain parallel
data, the remaining sentence pairs for each cor-
pora are considered out-of-domain according to
our filtering approach. However, they may still
contain useful information, thus we make use of
these corpora by building individual TMs for each
corpus (in a similar way we built the pseudo in-
domain models). The total amount of remaining
data (more than 33 million sentence pairs) makes
the training process costly in terms of time and
computing power. In order to reduce these costs,
sentence pairs with a bilingual cross-entropy dif-
ference higher than 10 were filtered out, as we no-
ticed that most of the sentences above this thresh-
old contain noise (non-alphanumeric characters,
foreign languages, etc.).

We also limit the size of the remaining data by
applying the vocabulary saturation method (Lewis
and Eetemadi, 2013). For the out-of-domain sub-
set of each corpus, we traverse the sentence pairs
in the order they are ranked by perplexity differ-
ence and filter out those sentence pairs for which
we have seen already each 1-gram at least 10
times. Each out-of-domain subset from each par-
allel corpus is then used to train a TM before inter-
polating them to create the pseudo out-of-domain
TM. The results reported by MERT obtained on
the newstest2013 development set are detailed in
Table 4.

domain subsets, the reported BLEU scores are
higher than the baseline for the four individual
SMT systems and the interpolated one. This latter
system outperforms the baseline by 3.61 absolute
points. Compared to the results obtained with the
pseudo in-domain data, we observe a slight im-
provement of the BLEU scores using the pseudo
out-of-domain data. However, despite the com-
paratively larger sizes of the latter datasets, the
BLEU scores reached are not that higher. For in-
stance with the 109 corpus, the pseudo in and out-
of-domain subsets contain 1.4 and 5.1 million sen-
tence pairs respectively, and the two systems reach
30.3 and 30.5 BLEU. These scores indicate that
the pseudo in-domain SMT systems are more ef-
ficient on the English–French newstest2013 devel-
opment set.

4.2 Extraction of Translation Rules

A synthetic phrase-table based on shallow-transfer
MT rules and dictionaries is built as follows. First,
a set of shallow-transfer rules is inferred from the
concatenation of the newstest2008-2012 develop-
ment corpora exactly in the same way as in the
UA-Prompsit submission to this translation shared
task (Sánchez-Cartagena et al., 2014). In sum-
mary, rules are obtained from a set of bilingual
phrases extracted from the parallel corpus after
its morphological analysis and part-of-speech dis-
ambiguation with the tools in the Apertium rule-
based MT platform (Forcada et al., 2011).

The extraction algorithm commonly used in
phrase-based SMT is followed with some added
heuristics which ensure that the bilingual phrases

174



extracted are compatible with the bilingual dic-
tionary. Then, many different rules are generated
from each bilingual phrase; each of them encodes
a different degree of generalisation over the partic-
ular example it has been extracted from. Finally,
the minimum set of rules which correctly repro-
duces all the bilingual phrases is found based on
integer linear programming search (Garfinkel and
Nemhauser, 1972).

Once the rules have been inferred, the phrase
table is built from them and the original rule-
based MT dictionaries, following the method
by Sánchez-Cartagena et al. (2011), which was
one of winning systems4 (together with two on-
line SMT systems) in the pairwise manual evalu-
ation of the WMT11 English–Spanish translation
task (Callison-Burch et al., 2011). This phrase-
table is then interpolated with the baseline TM and
the results are presented in Table 5. A slight im-
provement over the baseline is observed, which
motivates the use of synthetic rules in our final MT
system. This small improvement may be related
to the small coverage of the Apertium dictionar-
ies: the English–French bilingual dictionary has a
low number of entries compared to more mature
language pairs in Apertium which have around 20
times more bilingual entries.

5 Tuning and Decoding

We present in this Section a short selection of our
experiments, amongst 15+ different configura-
tions, conducted on the interpolation of TMs, tun-
ing and decoding parameters. We first interpolate
the four TMs: the baseline, the pseudo in and out-
of-domain, and the translation rules, minimising
the perplexity obtained on the concatenated de-
velopment sets from 2008 to 2012 (newstest2008-
2012). We investigate the use of OSM trained on
pseudo in-domain data only or using all the paral-
lel data available. Finally, we make variations of

ter using the sign test at p ≤ 0.1.

the number of n-bests used by MERT.
Results obtained on the development set new-

stest2013 are reported in Table 6. These scores
show that adding OSM to the interpolated trans-
lation models slightly degrades BLEU. However,
by increasing the number of n-bests considered by
MERT to 200-bests, the SMT system with OSM
outperforms the systems evaluated previously in
our experiments. Adding the synthetic translation
rules degrades BLEU (as indicated by the last row
in the Table), thus we decide to submit two sys-
tems to the shared task: one without and one with
synthetic rules. By submitting a system without
synthetic rules, we also ensure that our SMT sys-
tem is constrained according to the shared task
guidelines.

Table 6: BLEU scores reported by MERT on

As MERT is not suitable when a large number
of features are used (our system uses 19 fetures),
we switch to the Margin Infused Relaxed Algo-
rithm (MIRA) for our submitted systems (Watan-
abe et al., 2007). The development set used is
newstest2012, as we aim to select the best decod-
ing parameters according to the scores obtained
when decoding the newstest2013 corpus, after de-
truecasing and de-tokenising using the scripts dis-
tributed with MOSES. This setup allowed us to
compare our results with the participants of the
translation shared task last year. We pick the de-
coding parameters leading to the best results in
terms of BLEU and decode the official test set of
WMT14 newstest2014. The results are reported in
Table 7. Results on newstest2013 show that the de-
coding parameters investigation leads to an over-
all improvement of 0.1 BLEU absolute. The re-
sults on newstest2014 show that adding synthetic
rules did not help improving BLEU and degraded
slightly TER (Snover et al., 2006) scores.

In addition to our English→French submission,
we submitted a French→English translation. Our
French→English MT system is built on the align-
ments obtained from the English→French direc-
tion. The training processes between the two sys-

which are not extracted for the French→English
direction. Tuning and decoding parameters for
this latter translation direction are the best ones
obtained in our previous experiments on this
shared task. The case-sensitive scores obtained
for French→English on newstest2014 are 35.0
BLEU13A and 53.1 TER, which ranks us at the
fifth position for this translation direction.

6 Conclusion

We have presented the MT systems developed by
the Abu-MaTran project for the WMT14 trans-
lation shared task. We focused on the French–
English language pair and particularly on the
English→French direction. We have used a two-
step data selection process based on bilingual
cross-entropy difference and vocabulary satura-
tion, as well as a novel approach for the extraction
of synthetic translation rules and their use to en-
rich the phrase table. For the LMs and the TMs,
we rely on training individual models per corpus
before interpolating them by minimising perplex-
ity according to the development set. Finally, we
made use of the findings of WMT13 by including
an OSM model.

Our English→French translation system was
ranked second amongst nine teams and a total of
twenty submissions, while our French→English
submission was ranked fifth. As future work,
we plan to investigate the effect of adding to the
phrase table synthetic translation rules based on
larger dictionaries. We also would like to study the
link between OSM and the different decoding pa-

rameters implemented in MOSES, as we observed
inconsistent results in our experiments.
