Abstract
In this paper, we present the annota-
tion challenges we have encountered when
working on a historical language that was
undergoing elaboration processes. We es-
pecially focus on syntactic ambiguity and
gradience in Middle Low German, which
causes uncertainty to some extent. Since
current annotation tools consider construc-
tion contexts and the dynamics of the
grammaticalization only partially, we plan
to extend CorA – a web-based annota-
tion tool for historical and other non-
standard language data – to capture elab-
oration phenomena and annotator unsure-
ness. Moreover, we seek to interactively
learn morphological as well as syntactic
annotations.

1 Tracing Elaboration Processes

Language elaboration is a continuous develop-
ment. According to Traugott and Trousdale
(2013), it involves processes that change existing
constructions with respect to formal or semantic
aspects (constructional change) and processes in
which new constructions emerge (constructional-
ization). To distinguish between these processes
and to be able to describe their dynamics, one
needs a sophisticated inventory of descriptive cat-
egories. Those categories should capture formal
and/or semantic micro-changes as well as ambi-
guity and vagueness. Assuming that constructions
are “holistically” determined by interacting formal
and semantic/functional characteristics, a single
characteristic is always judged by its construction
binding, i.e. in cooccurrence with other character-
istics. Capturing (diachronic) semantic changes of

constructions that are formally (yet) hardly visible
or – vice versa – to recognize that formal charac-
teristics have not (yet) the grammatical function
that they will acquire in later language stages is
only possible in a given context.

1.1 Related Annotation Work and Tools
Over the last years, historical texts gained a lot of
interest from both computational and corpus lin-
guistics. Due to the graphematic and grammati-
cal variability, those texts are interesting and ana-
lytically challenging (Dipper et al., 2013b; Boll-
mann et al., 2014). Accordingly, many works
emerged that deal with the annotation of histori-
cal texts. For German, Dipper et al. (2013a) in-
troduced a tag set for historical language levels
(called HiTS). Multiple projects developed differ-
ent reference corpora for historical language lev-
els that were annotated with or in analogy with
HiTS. Recently, a reference corpus Middle Low
German/Low Rhenish (1200–1650) was compiled
in a collaboration between the German universi-
ties of Hamburg and Münster. Additionally, an-
notation tools ANNIS (Zeldes et al., 2009) and
CorA (Bollmann et al., 2014) were introduced. In
the context of literature studies, the heureCLÉA
project used CATMA (Meister et al., 2017) to an-
notate their data in correspondence with strict an-
notation guidelines that cover aspects of uncer-
tainty/ambiguity (Gius and Jacke, 2016).

1.2 Problem Definition
However, current annotation tools consider con-
struction contexts and the dynamics of the gram-
maticalization only partially. Although these
problems are well known (Dipper et al., 2013a;
Bollmann et al., 2014), satisfying solutions are

40



still missing. For our purposes, an annotation tool
should provide the following features/labels:

• Part-of-speech (POS) tag ambiguity: If a hu-
man annotator cannot clearly indicate which
POS tag can be assigned on morphological
or syntactic level, there must be an option to
annotate which one is more likely. However,
the annotator should not be forced to disam-
biguate – several (prioritized) interpretations
should be allowed.

• Syntactic gradience (Aarts, 2007): Even in
case of syntactic constructions, the above-
mentioned grammatical indeterminacy will
occur for construction tags.

• Individual annotation order: Instead of us-
ing the common text analysis pipeline with
a strict order, where first POS tags and then
constructions tags are assigned, our tool sup-
ports the cognitive annotation process. In
some contexts, it is easier for annotators to
start with (local) syntactic segmentation be-
fore POS tags can be disambiguated within
its corresponding construction borders.

• Annotator support: We provide auto-
suggestions (i.e. POS and/or construction
tags and their corresponding uncertainty val-
ues stating a certain annotator unsureness) for
unlabeled corpus data based on an interactive
machine learning approach.

• Annotator unsureness: We need to express
if human annotators are (un)sure about their
annotation decision. In case of unsureness,
we need additional comments which explain
their incapability to make a clear decision.

We settled on the aforementioned features within
our interdisciplinary group, especially valuing the
expertise in Middle Low German from the group’s
linguists. In order to significantly reconstruct the
temporal and spatial dynamics of elaboration pro-
cesses, it is essential to analyze bigger corpora.
Methodologically, it is not possible to do that on
the basis of single occurrences. Moreover, on the
basis of statistically significant evidence provided
by our tool, the difference between the construc-
tion change and the emergence of new construc-
tions can be detected much easier. To face the
above-mentioned features, we will extend CorA
(Bollmann et al., 2014) instead of starting from
scratch.

1.3 Scope of Study
Although there are some annotation tools deal-
ing with historical German, they do not perfectly
fit our purposes. For one, it is clear that we are
dealing with highly ambiguous data (due to the
language shift) and this can result in uncertainty.
Next, having a large corpus means a lot of manual
annotation. As this is very time intensive work,
we want to develop a parser that learns over time
to suggest possible annotations for each token and
even constituents. Finally, as language elaboration
involves the change and emergence of construc-
tions, we need syntactic/grammatical annotations
for such constructions. None of the features men-
tioned in Section 1.2 is currently supported by any
annotation tool.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we give an overview of our project goals,
data, and scope before we show in Section 3 what
kind of uncertainties we are facing. Finally, we
will draw our conclusions and present some future
work in Section 4.

2 Interactive Grammar Analysis

2.1 Project Aims
As already stated above, we investigate the (struc-
tural) elaboration of Middle Low German (MLG)
from the 13th century to the written language shift
(16th/17th century). During this period, MLG lost
its dominant position as a supraregional written
language accompanied with the growing influence
of (written) Early New High German (ENHG).
The study makes an important contribution to the
reconstruction of grammatical developments in
written MLG, which are hitherto examined only
to some extent. Our overall aim is to verify the as-
sumption that written ENHG instantiates – despite
an ENHG lexis – a MLG syntax/grammar. Partic-
ularly, we have four questions that we intend to an-
swer: (1) Which kind of elaboration processes do
occur? (2) How far does the elaboration go? (3)
How fast does each elaboration process establish
itself? (4) Are spatial points of origin identifiable?

2.2 Key Facts about our Corpus
Our empirical base is a corpus that consists of le-
gal texts from the 13th to the 17th century.

2.2.1 Characteristics
There are several reasons why we focus on urban
legal statutes: We assume that processes of lan-

41



guage elaboration can be investigated especially
in legal texts. They have to construe complex (le-
gal) issues understandable independently of con-
textual information, so that elaborated linguistic
structures capable of such a construal must be de-
veloped. These legal issues specifically occur in
the form of conditional relations; consequently,
we are able to examine changes concerning the
linguistic construction of conditionality during the
investigation period. Furthermore, legal statutes
are locatable and datable, with the result that de-
velopmental dynamics of elaboration processes
can be spatio-temporally reconstructed.

2.2.2 Distribution and Size
The corpus is divided into two parts: MLG con-
sists of Middle Low German texts from 1227
to 1650 and covers about 1.2 million tokens.
ENHG contains a selection of the first ENHG texts
(400,000 tokens) arising in the Low German lan-
guage area after the written language shift.

2.2.3 Text Sources
Another important aspect of our corpus is the use
of primary materials for transcriptions and not edi-
tions. We want the transcriptions to be as diplo-
matic as possible, i.e. we keep text structuring el-
ements like numbering, paragraphs, rubrifications,
initials, and similar. In a broader sense, changes in
the layout of a written text can be seen as elabo-
ration phenomena (Krämer et al., 2012). It is con-
ceivable that structural elements were introduced
to separate or highlight textual and/or grammati-
cal units. Keeping this information enables us to
examine whether the language shift was accompa-
nied by grammaticalization of interpunction.

2.3 Human-in-the-Loop Annotation Support
It is common practice for annotation tools to pro-
vide annotation suggestions (e.g. Cunningham
et al. (2011); Stenetorp et al. (2012); Yimam
et al. (2014); Bollmann et al. (2014); Bögel et al.
(2015)). We also plan to develop an interactive
procedure that combines machine learning and ex-
pert feedback (Holzinger, 2016) to solve one of
the most central problems of existing annotation
tools for historical texts. Due to the historical dy-
namics of grammar, we cannot use existing pars-
ing and tagging system since those require static
(a priori defined) syntactic rules and grammati-
cal categories. We want to discover an evolv-
ing, dynamic grammar by using rule-based text

analysis techniques and machine learning meth-
ods (Hüllermeier, 2011). This enables us to re-
construct the language elaboration in an evidence-
based way, which is a novelty.

3 Annotation Uncertainties

None of the current annotation tools cover the as-
pect of uncertainty as we do. Of course, this aspect
is known and projects have strategies to cover it.
In the end, it always comes down to the annotators
being forced to decide for exactly one annotation.
Instead, our tool allows for multiple annotations
with an option to state which one is more likely. A
similar idea by Jurgens (2013) allowed weighted
multiple word sense annotations, and his results
show improvements in the task of word sense dis-
ambiguation. In the following, we will explain
our morphological (3.1) and syntactic (3.2) uncer-
tainty.

3.1 POS Tag Ambiguity
The sentence in example (1) shows an excerpt for
a specific state of the language shift process. The
function word group na deme dat consists for-
mally of a preposition1 + reanalyzed pronoun2 +
primary subjunction3 but expresses a functional
unit [complex subjunction]4. This is an obvious in-
terpretation, as the unit na deme dat establishes a
(temporal) relation between two entities construed
as processes. From a cognitive grammar point of
view, this functional characteristic is the crucial
subjunctional criterion. Besides that, its further
grammaticalization – which can be reconstructed
based on our texts – suggests such an analysis as
complex secondary subjunction (early state of a so
called subjunctionalization). In the following sta-
dium, as part of a formal erosion powered by fre-
quency effects, we can observe the reduction of
the primary subjunction dat and the univerbation
of na and dem(e) as shown in example (2). Fur-
thermore, as a result of desemantication, a causal
relation is encoded. In our tool, users can anno-
tate each member of the function word group of
example (1) with its respective POS tag as well as
assigning a POS tag to the whole group. Addition-
ally, they can state which analysis is more likely.

When annotating historical texts, one could be
uncertain which POS tag to assign due to missing
context information or other circumstances. This
is quite normal, but we are facing uncertainty due
to our goal to analyze a language that is undergo-

ing a shift. In our case, we will have to face issues
where it is hard to tell if a token is still a member
of category A or already a member of category B.
So we should add a degree of how certain an anno-
tation is and give annotators the possibility to ex-
actly state why the annotation is uncertain in this
case. This provides a great level of transparency
and may lead to new insights.

3.2 Syntactic Gradience
Our aim is the analysis of constructions in the area
of language elaboration (Maas, 2010; Tophinke,
2012; Merten, 2015). Therefore, we focus on con-
structions that model conditional relations of cir-
cumstances or have a conditional interpretation.
Additionally, we capture all characteristics that
cooccur for each construction given the temporal
aspect that proved to be typical for this form. Fur-
thermore, we investigate gradient structures and
describe constructional changes in their gradual
nature in a detailed way. We are interested in
changes concerning form and/or meaning/function
with respect to the textual perspective: from texts
meant to be read out to texts that were designed
for reading for oneself (Tophinke, 2009).

In previous work, we already identified some
constructions that proved to be relevant to ev-
idently reconstruct the language shift. These
syntactic constructions are of varying complex-
ity that can be either called phrases (i.e. nominal
phrase, prepositional phrase, . . . ) or transphrases
(i.e. complex sentences). An interesting con-
structionalization is the evolution of subjunctional
constructions. In our earliest texts, those have
the form “[situational context] [specification of
situation]” and differ a lot from (literate) subjunc-
tional constructions as we know them today. Al-

though they are formally marked as subjunctional
entities (initial subjunction markers like of, (so)
wanne, weret also dat1 + verb final position), they
are not integrated into a (supposed) matrix struc-
ture. This is illustrated in Example (3) through
bracketing. From a syntactic perspective, the rela-
tion between the syntagma introduced by the sub-
junction and the following entity is much more
loose than we know it from typical subjunctional
constructions of present times. But focusing on
semantic-functional aspects, one has to emphasize
their specific functionality: They are typical struc-
tures of so called space building (Merten, 2016)
which is highly linked to/functionalized with re-
spect to the reception of these (older) texts. As
they were meant to be read out, these orate struc-
tures ensured – to a certain extent – an easier ac-
cess for potential listeners (Szczepaniak, 2015).
As a result of the ongoing syntactic elaboration
processes, the form turned into “

[
[subjunctional

sentence] matrix structure
]
” where the complete

sentence is a subordinative conditional construc-
tion that exhibits the nowadays common if-then
structure. We show an excerpt from our texts in
Example (4).

4 Conclusion and Future Work

We showed that there are still missing features in
current annotation tools and how we plan to pro-
vide them. Our CorA-based annotation tool will
be able to handle uncertainties and allow syntac-
tic annotations. Additionally, it will have a feature
that provides annotation suggestions to support the
human annotator in his/her work.

weret also dat is were it so that = if.

In the future, we plan to also integrate an infor-
mation retrieval system that allows one to search
for certain grammatical/syntactical constructions.
As we are interested in temporal-spatial aspects,
limiting the search to a specific time span and/or
a specific region should be possible. In the long
run, it is planned that the tool displays the search
results on a (dynamic) map over time.

All tools created in the course of this project
will be made available. We will report

site: http://www.uni-paderborn.de/
