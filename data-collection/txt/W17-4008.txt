Abstract

We give a FST description of nominal
and finite verb morphology of Azarbai-
jani Turkish. We use a hybrid approach
where nominal inflection is expressed as
a slot-based paradigm and major parts of
verb inflection are expressed as optional
paths on the FST. We collapse adjective
and noun categories in a single nominal
category as they behave similarly as far as
their paradigms are concerned. Thus, we
defer a more precise identification of POS
to further down the NLP pipeline.

1 Introduction

Azarbaijani Turkish (AT) is a Turkic language
spoken by more than 30 million people mainly
in Iran and Azarbaijan. AT is an agglutinative
language with rich and regular inflectional and
derivational morphologies. As in all Turkic lan-
guages, vowel harmony and consonant changes at
the morpheme boundaries are conditioned by the
phonological context. Word order is relatively free
and the syntactic relations are indicated by case
markings and in spoken form also by stress.

The alphabet has 23 consonants, adding ç, ş, ğ
to the consonants of the Latin alphabet and remov-
ing w from it. It has 9 vowels, adding ı, ü, ö and @
to the Latin alphabet. The Table 1 gives the front-
ness, roundness and height of vowels.

There are a few morphological analyzers for

Turkish, (Oflazer, 1994), (Çöltekin, 2010), (Şahin
et al., 2013) and Turkic languages like Turkmen
(Tantug et al., 2006), Kazakh (Kessikbayeva and
Cicekli, 2016), Uighur (Orhun et al., 2009). Al-
though, AT is close to the Turkish spoken in
Turkey, there are enough non-trivial differences
both in morphotactics and phonology to prevent
the direct use of analyzers implemented for Turk-
ish. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the first FST implementation of AT noun and fi-
nite verb inflections.

In our implementation, we used Helsinki FST,
(Lindén et al., 2011). We provide the details of the
full FST as supplementary materials. The present
description involves nominal and verb inflections
in isolation. We are extending this initial effort to
the rest of the AT morphology and we will make
the full implementation publicly available as a web
service.

2 Approach

For each morpheme, we represent its abstract
form either as a key-value pair for slot-based
paradigms or just as a key for other paradigms. For
example, <Case:Abl> denotes an abstract mor-
pheme for ablative case. The first level of mor-
phology yields the archmorphemes prior to the
phonological transformations in the second level.
Thus, in FST description, a transition expressed
as <Case:Abl>:-NAn yields the archmorpheme
-NAn where the archiphoneme ‘N’ stands for a
choice of ‘n’ or ’d’ and ‘A’ stands for ’a’ or @.

3 Nominal inflection

The nominal inflection in AT has a fixed order of
suffixes as
Nominal stem + Number + Possessor + Family +
Case.

Nominal stem may be either a simple nominal

a series of derivations.

Figure 1: Slot-based nominal inflection in AT

The Number slot can have Singular or Plu-
ral values where Singular has zero surface form.
There are 7 values for the Possessor key includ-
ing the value None for no possessor. The Case
slot may have values Nominal, Accusative, Dative,
Locative, Ablative, Genitive and Instrumental.

The Family slot is binary valued as On/Off. We
could have represented it as an optional morpheme
without a slot. However, as we wanted to represent
all of nominal inflection as slot based, we used the
binary value trick to represent its presence.

When On, the surface realizations of the Fam-
ily slot are one of -gil, -gill@r or -lAr. Note that
the third form -lAr is the same as the surface real-
ization of Plural morpheme. The collision of sur-
face realizations is the reason for the occurrence
of such seemingly irregular forms as

(1)
xala-m-lar xala-lar-ım
aunt-P1SG-PLU aunt-PLU-P1SG

The apparent reordering of the possessor and plu-
ral suffixes in (1) seems to contradict the strictly
ordered paradigm of nominal inflection. However,
the semantics of the two forms (1) indicate the
presence of two distinct morphemes with the same

surface forms. Indeed, while “xala-lar-ım” means
“my aunts”, “xala-m-lar” means “the family of my
aunt” or “my aunt and her group.” The analysis
with the family slot becomes more apparent when
we use the other family suffix -gil

(2)
xala-m-gil *xala-gil-im
aunt-P1SG-FAM aunt-FAM-P1SG

where the family suffix is forced to come after pos-
sessor.

The FST for the nominal paradigm is given in
Figure 1.

The possessor morphemes sn1, sn2 and sn3 in
Figure 1 are listed in Table 2. Note that some mor-
phemes such as <poss:2p> have multiple equiva-
lent surface forms.

Table 2: Possessor person paradigms for Figure 1.
Empty cells are undefined. Apart from epenthe-
sis, the only difference between sn1 and sn2 is
<Poss:3p>.

Since our nominal inflection paradigm is slot-
based, the only accepting state is the Case. The
case symbols for sn4 are of the form <Case:v>:a
where (v,a) pair is one of (Nom,-), (Dat,-(y)A),
(Loc, -dA), (Acc, -(n)I), (Abl, -NAn), (Gen, -
(n)In) and (Ins, -(y)InAn).

4 Verbal paradigm

The inflection of finite verbs also has a fixed order
with few exceptions mainly due to the copulas. In
its general form, the verb paradigm is
Verb stem + Voice + Ability + Polarity + Probabil-
ity + Tense-aspect-mood + Person.

The whole paradigm is quite complex. In order
handle the complexity, we divided the paradigm
into smaller sub-paradigms with clear interfaces
among them.

4.1 Voice
There are 5 voices, Active, Reflexive (Rflx), Re-
ciprocal (Rcpr), Causative (Caus) and Passive
(Pasv). Apart from Active voice, each has a vari-
ety of surface realizations which are specified lex-
ically or phonologically. A verb stem might have
multiple voices under co-occurrence and ordering
restrictions. The ordering of the voices are

(Reciprocal or Reflexive) + Causatives + Pas-
sive.

Theoretically, the Causative voice marker can
be repeated freely to denote an arbitrarily long
chain of causation. However, in practice, only up
to three Causative markers are used.

The FST for the voice paradigm is shown in Fig-
ure 2. The Causative and Passive morpheme sym-
bols sv1, sv2 and sv3 in Figure 2 are listed in Table
3.

The APP state in Figure 2 represents the state
connecting the Voice FST to the part of the verb
inflection paradigm which deals with Ability, Po-
larity and Probability given in Figure 3. We
treat the transitions within the voice paradigm as
optional so all the states have an edge to APP

showed only two of these, the ones from Caus3

and Caus2A. There are two distinct paths for multi-
ple causatives, the path Caus1A-Caus

2
A-Caus

3 and
Caus1B-Caus

2
B-Caus

3. These are conditioned by
the phonotactics of the different causative suffixes.
However, it is difficult to come up with rules gov-
erning the choice of a particular causative suffix.
Less common suffixes are best represented as be-
ing conditioned by the verb stem lexicon. Note
that there are 4 allomorphs (rows sv1 and sv2 in
Table 3) for causative and 2 (row sv3) for passive
when they are attached immediately after the verb
stem. In our implementation, we created 15 dis-
tinct initial states to handle their possible combina-
tions (including no Passive and no Causative) and
we marked the correct transition within the verb
lexicon. We refrained from using flag diacritics at
the expense of increasing the number of states.

4.2 Ability, Polarity, Probability

The interaction among Possibility, Polarity and
Probability is given in the FST in Figure 3. The
multiple paths for polarities are needed for the dif-
ferent Person paradigms of negative Aortive tense.
The symbol <Abil> denotes the Ability abstract
morpheme. Similarly, <Prbl> denotes Probabil-
ity morpheme. <Pol:Pos> and <Pol:Neg> de-
note positive and negative polarity morphemes, re-
spectively. <Pol:Pos> has zero surface realiza-
tion.

In AT, there are two morphemes with the same
canonical surface forms to express Possibility and
Probability. These respectively correspond to ‘be
able to’ and ‘might’ in English. Similarity of sur-
face forms precludes their adjacency. So, it is im-
possible to morphologically compose ‘he might be
able to come’ in AT. Instead, we end up with an
ambiguous construction that expresses either pos-
sibility or probability. However, when the negative
polarity suffix -mA is in between, we can say

he might not be able to come.

The standard orthography of AT has a split of the
word before the surface form ‘bil@n’ of Ability
morpheme. Furthermore, there are two more al-
lomorphs -(y)An and -(y)A bil@n of Ability mor-
pheme when it is followed by negative polarity.

The states labeled as TAMP1, TAMP2 and
TAMP3 in Figure 3 are the states connecting the
FST describing Ability, Polarity and Probability to
the FST describing Tense, Aspect, Modality and
Person (TAMP) which is partially given in Figure
4. Note that the transitions to TAMP states do not
output anything.

4.3 Tense, Aspect, Modality and Person

The last paradigm of finite verb inflection has the
basic order
Tense + Copula + Person + Condition + Question.

Only Tense and Person are obligatory and the
rest are optional. The order of Copula and Person
changes in some cases.

In AT, often a single morpheme expresses a
combination of tense, aspect and modality (TAM).
There are 11 tenses. In terms of their interactions
with their surrounding context, we grouped them
into 9 distinct groups. There are 4 copula mor-
phemes corresponding to Aortive, Narrative, Past
and Conditional.

The FST for the full TAM-Person paradigm
is too complicated to present in the body of the
present paper. We provide in Figure 4 only a part
of it to show different paths for copula and person
paradigms. We provide the full paradigm in the
supplementary materials.

In Figure 4, <Tns:Past> and <Tns:Necc> rep-
resent abstract morphemes for Past and Necessity
tenses, respectively. <Cpl:Narr> and <Cpl:Aor>
represent the copula morphemes for Narrative and
Aortive.

The possible person suffixes p1-p4 are listed in
Table 4. Note that <Prsn:3s> has zero surface re-
alization. The empty cells in columns p1 and p2
show that following Necessity tense, the Aortive
Copula is possible only for singular or plural third
person.

5 Phonology

In AT, the rules governing phonemic changes de-
pend mostly on the phonological context, enabling
an almost complete decoupling of morphotactics
and phonology in the implementation. In our
implementation, however, we embedded some of
the phonological rules in the morphotactics FST
whenever the phonological context is known.

There are two major categories of phonological
rules in AT. The first one deals with the insertion
of epenthetic letters (y), (n) and (s). In our im-
plementation, we start with epenthetic letters in-
serted by default and drop them when needed. The
second major category deals with the mapping of
archiphonemes, A, I, N, Q and K to their surface
forms. We list the rules below in the order they are
applied.

1. Epenthetic (y) and (s) drop when they follow
a consonant.

2. Epenthetic (n) drops when it is the last letter
in a word.

3. The negative suffix -mA drops its A before a
vowel or (y).

4. The archiphoneme N maps to n when it fol-
lows n or m, it maps to d otherwise.

5. The archiphoneme A is mapped to surface
phonemes to satisfy back-front harmony. It
maps to a when it is the first vowel after a
back vowel and it maps to @ when following
a front vowel.

6. The archiphoneme I maps to u, ü, ı or i for
round-flat and back-front harmony.

7. The archiphoneme Q maps to the
archiphoneme K when it follows a front
vowel. K is further mapped according to the
next rule.

8. The archiphoneme Q maps to ğ and the
archiphoneme K maps to y before a vowel.

6 Conclusion

We provided HFST descriptions of the nominal
and finite verb inflections of Azarbaijani Turkish.
Our specification of nominal inflection resolves
the apparent reordering of possessive and plural
morphemes using a new family/group morpheme.

Currently, we are working on working out the
rest of the morphology complete with derivation,
nominal predicates and a root lexicon. After unify-
ing the isolated parts in a single analyzer, we plan
to make its implementation publicly available and
also present the analyzer as a web service.
