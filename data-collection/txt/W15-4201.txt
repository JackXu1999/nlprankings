From DBpedia and WordNet hierarchies to LinkedIn and Twitter

 

Abstract 

Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of 

using linguistic resources to analyze a user’s social 

media profiles in order to learn information about that 

user. However, numerous linguistic resources exist, 

raising the question of choosing the appropriate 

resource. This paper compares Extended WordNet 

Domains with DBpedia. The comparison takes the 

form of an investigation of the relationship between 

users’ descriptions of their knowledge and background 

on LinkedIn with their description of the same 

characteristics on Twitter. The analysis applied in this 

study consists of four parts. First, information a user 

has shared on each service is mined for keywords. 

These keywords are then linked with terms in 

DBpedia/Extended WordNet Domains. These terms are 

ranked in order to generate separate representations of 

the user’s interests and knowledge for LinkedIn and 

Twitter. Finally, the relationship between these 

separate representations is examined. In a user study 

with eight participants, the performance of this analysis 

using DBpedia is compared with the performance of 

this analysis using Extended WordNet Domains. The 

best results were obtained when DBpedia was used. 

1 Introduction 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques 

have been shown in studies such as Gao et al. 

(2012) and Vosecky et al. (2013) to be successful 

in extracting information from a user’s social 

media profiles. In these studies, linguistic 

resources are employed in order to perform NLP 

tasks such as identifying concepts, Named Entity 

Recognition etc. However, as Chiarcos et al. 

argue, significant interoperability issues are posed 

by the fact that linguistic resources ‘are not only  

 

 

growing in number, but also in their heterogeneity' 

(2014). They further argue that the best way to 

overcome these issues is by using linguistic 

resources that conform to Linked Open Data 

principles. Chiarcos et al. divide such resources 

into two categories, distinguishing between 

strictly lexical resources such as WordNet and 

general knowledge bases such as DBpedia.  

The study described in this paper examines a 

single resource of each type. WordNet is 

considered to be a representative example of a 

purely lexical resource given the extent of its use 

in research1. DBpedia is considered to be a 

representative example of a knowledge base 

because its information is derived from 

Wikipedia, the quality of whose knowledge 

almost matches that of Encyclopedia Britannica 

(Giles, 2005). These resources are compared by 

means of an investigation of the relationship 

between users’ descriptions of their knowledge 

and background on LinkedIn with their 

description of the same characteristics on Twitter. 

Both LinkedIn and Twitter allow users to describe 

their interests and knowledge by: (i) Filling in 

profile information (ii) Posting status updates. 

However, the percentage of users who post status 

updates on LinkedIn is significantly lower than 

the percentage of users who do so on Twitter 

(Bullas, 2015). On the other hand, LinkedIn users 

fill in far more of their profiles on average than 

Twitter users (Abel, Henze, Herder, and Krause, 

2010).

Given the different ways in which users use these 

services, it is possible that they provide different 

representations of their interests and knowledge 

on each one. For example, a user may indicate a 

new-found interest in ‘Linguistics’ through their 

tweets before they list this subject on their 

LinkedIn profile. This study examines the 

relationship between users’ descriptions of their 

interests and knowledge on each service. 

2 Related Work 

Hauff and Houben describe a study that 

investigates whether a user’s bookmarking profile 

on the sites Bibsonomy, CiteULike and 

LibraryThing can be inferred using information 

obtained from that user’s tweets (2011) . Hauff 

and Houben generate separate ‘knowledge 

profiles’ for Twitter and for the bookmarking 

sites. These profiles consist of a weighted list of 

terms that appear in the user’s tweets and 

bookmarking profiles, respectively. The authors’ 

approach is hindered by noise introduced by 

tweets that are unrelated to the user’s learning 

activities. This problem could be addressed by 

enriching information found in a user’s profiles 

with structured data in a linguistic resource. 

However, there are often multiple possible 

interpretations for a term. For example, the word 

‘bank’ has entirely different interpretations when 

it appears to the right of the word ‘river’ than 

when it appears to the right of the word 

‘merchant’. When linking a word with 

information contained in a linguistic resource, the 

correct interpretation of the word must be chosen. 

The NLP technique Word Sense Disambiguation 

(WSD) addresses this issue. Two different 

approaches to WSD are described below.  

Magnini et al. perform WSD using WordNet as 

well as domain labels provided by the WordNet 

Domains project2 (2002). This project assigned 

domain labels to WordNet synsets in accordance 

with the Dewey Decimal Classification. However, 

WordNet has been updated with new synsets since 

Magnini et al.’s study. Therefore, in the study 

                                                           
2 http://wndomains.fbk.eu/  

described in this paper, the Extended WordNet 

Domain labels created by González et al. (2012) 

are used. Not only do these labels provide greater 

synset coverage, González et al. report better 

WSD performance with Extended WordNet 

Domains than with the original WordNet 

Domains. 

Mihalcea and Csomai describe an approach for 

identifying the relevant Wikipedia articles for a 

piece of text (2007). Their approach employs a 

combination of the Lesk algorithm and Naïve 

Bayes classification. Since DBpedia URIs are 

created using Wikipedia article titles, the above 

approach can also be used to identify DBpedia 

entities in text. 

Magnini et al’s approach offers a means of 

analysing the skill, interest and course lists on a 

user’s LinkedIn profile with regard to both 

WordNet and DBpedia. Unambiguous items in 

these lists can be linked directly with a WordNet 

synset or DBpedia URI. These unambiguous 

items can then provide a basis for interpreting 

ambiguous terms. For example, the unambiguous 

‘XML’ could be linked with the ‘Computer 

Science’ domain, providing a basis for 

interpreting the ambiguous ‘Java’.  

The above analysis allows for items in a user’s 

tweets and LinkedIn profile to be linked with 

entities in WordNet/DBpedia. Labels associated 

with these entities can then be collected to form 

separate term-list representations for a user’s 

tweets and LinkedIn profile information. 

Plumbaum et al. describe a Social Web User 

Model as consisting of the following attributes: 

Personal Characteristics, Interests, Knowledge 

and Behavior, Needs and Goals and Context 

(2011). Inferring ‘Personal Characteristics’ (i.e. 

demographic information) from either a user’s 

tweets or their LinkedIn profile information would 

require a very different kind of analysis from that 

described in this paper, for example that 

performed by Schler and Koppel (2006). As 

Plumbaum et al. define ‘Behaviour’ and ‘Needs 

and Goals’ as system-specific characteristics, 

information about a specific system would be 

2



required to infer them. ‘Context’ requires 

information such as the user’s role in their social 

network to be inferred.   

Given the facts stated in the previous paragraph, 

the term lists generated by the analysis in this 

study are taken as not describing ‘Personal 

Characteristics’, ‘Behavior’, ‘Needs and Goals’ 

and ‘Context’. However, a term-list format has 

been used to represent interests and knowledge by 

Ma, Zeng, Ren, and Zhong (2011) and Hauff and 

Houben (2011), respectively. As mentioned 

previously, users’ Twitter and LinkedIn profiles 

can contain information about both characteristics. 

Thus, the term lists generated in this study are 

taken as representing a combination of the user’s 

interests and knowledge. 

3 Research Questions 

3.1 Research Question 1 

This question investigates the possibility that a 

user may represent their interests and knowledge 

differently on different Social Media services. It is 

as follows:  

RQ1. To what extent does a user’s description of 

their interests and knowledge through their tweets 

correspond with their description of the same 

characteristics through their profile information 

on LinkedIn? 

For example, 'Linguistics’ may be the most 

discussed item in the user’s LinkedIn profile, but 

only the third most discussed item in their tweets.  

This question is similar to that investigated by 

Hauff and Houben (2011). However, there is an 

important difference. This question does not try to 

determine whether a user’s LinkedIn profile can 

be inferred from their tweets. Instead, it 

investigates the extent of the difference between 

the information users give through each service. 

3.2 Research Question 2 

Studies such as Abel et al. (2011; 2012) show that 

information found in a user’s tweets can be used 

to recommend items to them e.g. news articles. 

Furthermore, as user activity is significantly 

higher on Twitter than on LinkedIn (Bullas, 

2015), users may discuss recent interests on the 

former without updating the latter. The second 

research question of this study is as follows: 

RQ2. Can information obtained from a user’s 

tweets be used to recommend items for that user’s 

LinkedIn page? 

These questions aim to investigate: (i) The 

variation between a user’s description of their 

interests and knowledge through their LinkedIn 

profile and their description of these 

characteristics through their tweets (ii) Whether a 

user’s tweets can be used to augment the 

information in their LinkedIn profile. 

4 Method 

The user study method is applied in this research. 

This decision is taken with reference to work such 

as Lee and Brusilovsky (2009) and Reinecke and 

Bernstein (2009). The aforementioned authors 

employ user studies in order to determine the 

accuracy with which their systems infer 

information about users.  

4.1 Analysis 

The analysis adopted in this study consists of four 

stages: 

 Identify keywords 

 Link these keywords to labels in DBpedia 

/Extended WordNet Domains) 

 Generate separate representations of the 

user’s interests and knowledge for their 

tweets and LinkedIn profile information 

 Examine the relationship between these 

separate representations 

4.2 Keyword Identification 

The user’s LinkedIn lists of skills, interests and 

courses are treated as lists of keywords with 

respect to each resource. However, the process for 

identifying keywords in text (e.g. a textual 

3



description on LinkedIn, a tweet) differs for each 

resource. For the DBpedia approach potential 

keywords derive from a precompiled list i.e. the 

list of all Wikipedia keyphrases. In the case of 

Extended WordNet Domains, no such list exists, 

meaning a different approach must be used for 

identifying keywords. Ellen Riloff describes 

various methods for identifying important items in 

a text (1999). Riloff describes how case frames 

can be used to identify nouns describing entities 

such as perpetrators and victims of crimes. A case 

frame approach cannot be adopted here as it relies 

on previous knowledge of the text being 

processed. Instead, each text is parsed in order to 

extract its noun phrases. These noun phrases are 

then investigated using n-grams for keywords that 

can be linked with WordNet synsets. 

Keywords relating to Named Entities of the 

following types are ignored: Person; Place; 

Organization; Event; Animal; Film; Television 

Show; Book; Play (Theatre). This is because in a 

list of top LinkedIn skills compiled by LinkedIn 

Profile Services3, not a single Named Entity of 

these types appears. 

Any links appearing in text are extracted and 

cleaned of HTML. The remaining text is analysed 

in the manner detailed in the two previous 

paragraphs. 

4.3 Linking keywords with labels 

Ma et al. discuss methods for identifying user 

interests by combining information from different 

sources, including LinkedIn and Twitter (2011). 

The authors argue that, with the help of domain 

ontologies, texts a user has written can be used to 

identify both explicit and implicit interests. 

Explicit interests are identified by linking text 

items with ontology classes. Implicit interests are 

then identified by obtaining the parent and/or 

child of the identified ontology class. For 

example, consider an ontology in which 

‘Knowledge Representation’ is the parent of 

‘Semantic Web’. If a user explicitly indicates they 

                                                           
3 Available at: http://linkedinprofileservice.co/linkedin-
profile-tips-advice/linkedin-skills-list/ 

are interested in ‘Semantic Web’, they are 

implicitly indicating that they are interested in 

‘Knowledge Representation’. However, Ma et al. 

provide the caveat that only the immediate parents 

and children of a particular class (i.e. one level 

above/below) should be identified for a particular 

class.  

In the study described in this paper, explicit 

information is obtained by linking keywords with 

labels in DBpedia/Extended WordNet Domains. 

Unambiguous keywords are linked directly. 

Ambiguous keywords are linked to labels using 

the methods described in the ‘Related Work’ 

section. Implicit information is obtained by 

identifying parent class(es) only. This decision 

was taken with reference to the ‘is-a’ subsumption 

relation. Under this relation, if an object B inherits 

from an object A, all instances of B are instances 

of A. However, instances of A are not necessarily 

instances of B. For example, if a user explicitly 

expresses an interest in ’Knowledge 

Representation’ they are not necessarily implicitly 

expressing an interest in ‘Semantic Web’. 

4.4 Representation of user interests and 
knowledge 

User interests and knowledge are represented as 

weighted lists of terms. Weighting schemes such 

as tf-idf are not used because as Hauff and 

Houben argue, such measures are not best suited 

to measuring the relative importance of terms for 

a user. The authors describe the inherent problem 

with measures such as tf-idf: ‘if a tenth of the 

CiteULike articles in our index for example would 

include the term genetics, it would receive a low 

weight, although it may actually represent the 

user’s knowledge profile very well’ (2011). The 

procedure for calculating term weights in this 

study is thus identical to that in Hauff and 

Houben’s study. A term’s weight is calculated 

using the following formula: 

𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡

=
number of times term was mentioned

total number of term mentions
 

4



For example, if there are a total of 4 term 

mentions and ‘Linguistics’ has been mentioned 

twice its weight will be 0.5. 

Terms with only a single mention are discarded 

before weights are calculated. This decision was 

taken in order to minimise noise in the form of 

outlying items.  

4.5 Comparison of representations 

A term’s weight in the LinkedIn or Twitter term 

lists generated by this analysis is directly related 

to the total number of term mentions in that list. 

As this total can differ between LinkedIn and 

Twitter, comparisons between term lists cannot be 

made using weights. Ranks are used instead. 

For RQ1 the relative ranks of terms that appear in 

both the Twitter and LinkedIn term lists are 

compared.  

For RQ2, only Twitter terms whose rank is equal 

to or higher than the lowest ranked term in the 

LinkedIn term list are recommended. For 

example, if the user’s LinkedIn term list contains 

six ranks, only Twitter terms of rank six or higher 

are recommended. If no terms were found in the 

user’s LinkedIn profile, only the first-ranked 

Twitter interest(s) is recommended. 

5 Implementation 

This section describes the implementation of the 

analysis described in the previous section. 

5.1 Information Collected 

The user’s 1000 most recent tweets are collected 

using Twitter’s public RESTful API4. The 

following information is collected using 

LinkedIn’s public RESTful API5: 

1. The user’s summary 

2. The user’s skill, interest and course lists 

3. The user’s textual descriptions of their 

educational and professional experience. 

4. The textual descriptions of LinkedIn 
groups to which the user belongs.

5 https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/rest-api 

5.2 Term selection from resources 

In WordNet, the hyperonymy relation links a noun 

synset to its parent. Analogously to the Swedish 

FrameNet++ lexical framework described by 

Forsberg and Borin (2014), in this study the 

Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)6 

‘broader’ relation is used as a DBpedia equivalent 

to hyperonymy. 

5.2.1 WordNet 

Extended WordNet Domain labels are used as 

terms. A keyword is linked to a WordNet synset 

and the domain label for this synset as well as the 

domain labels for its hyperonyms are obtained. 

The ‘factotum’ domain is not considered. This 

label is assigned to synsets to which no other label 

could be assigned, and thus has no specificity. 

5.2.2 DBpedia 

DBpedia category labels are used as terms. A 

keyword is linked to a DBpedia URI. This URI is 

then linked to the DBpedia category bearing the 

same label using the Dublin Core7 ‘subject’ 

relation. If no such category exists, this means this 

URI content did not meet the criteria required to 

be given its own category8. In this case, all 

categories related to the URI by the ‘subject’ 

relation are obtained. Parent categories are 

identified through the SKOS ‘broader’ relation, 

and their labels are obtained. 

The DBpedia category ‘Main topic classifications’ 

is not considered as it is a table of contents for 

other categories. Similarly, DBpedia categories 

such as ‘Wikipedia categories named after 

information technology companies of the United 

States’ are not considered as these refer 

specifically to the way in which the Wikipedia 

hierarchy is organised, rather than the concepts in 

it.

5.3 Texts 

Texts (i.e. tweets, LinkedIn descriptions) are 

parsed, and the WordNet and DBpedia databases 

accessed, using the Pattern NLP library for Python 

(Smedt & Daelemans, 2012). 

5.3.1 Tweet Preprocessing 

Before tweets are analysed, they are preprocessed 

as follows: 

 The word ‘RT’ appearing at the beginning 

of a tweet (indicating the tweet is a 

retweet) is removed. 

 Characters repeated consecutively more 

than twice are replaced with two 

consecutive characters (e.g. ‘gooood’ 

becomes become ‘good’) as in (Vosecky 

et al., 2013). 

 For hashtags the ‘#’ symbol is removed 

and the tag is split using the capital-letter 

rule described in (Hauff & Houben, 

2011). For example, ‘#MachineLearning’ 

becomes ‘Machine Learning’. 

 

5.3.2 Corpora Used 

In applying Magnini et al’s approach, separate 

corpora are used for processing tweets and for 

processing LinkedIn textual data. For the former, 

a 36.4 million-word tweet corpus is used. For the 

latter the ~300 million-word blog corpus compiled 

by Schler and Koppel (2006) is used. This corpus 

is deemed suitable given both its size and the fact 

that it contains posts on a wide variety of topics, 

for example: ‘Real Estate’, ‘Arts’, ‘Education’, 

‘Engineering’, ‘Law’ etc.  

5.3.3 Modifications 

This section describes modifications made to the 

analysis described in the ‘Method’ Section. 

Magnini et al report that a context of at least 100 

words should be used to disambiguate a word (50 

words before the word and 50 words after). For 

tweets, as such a context is not available, the 

whole tweet is used. 

The following modifications were made due to 

analysis time constraints. 

Only links of 550 words or lower were analysed. 

This decision was taken with reference to the 

following quote from a Reuters blog post on the 

issue of ideal article length: ‘Reuters editors see 

stories that exceed 500 or 600 words as 

indistinguishable from “Gravity’s Rainbow”)’ 

(MacMillan, 2010). 

In the DBpedia approach, creating feature vectors 

for the Naïve Bayes approach proved unworkable. 

Consider for example the term ‘Xbox’, which 

appears as a keyphrase in 4008 articles. To apply 

the Naïve Bayes approach, the following 

information would have to be gathered for each 

occurrence: ‘the current word and its part-of-

speech, a local context of three words to the left 

and right of the ambiguous word, the parts-of-

speech of the surrounding words, and a global 

context implemented through sense specific 

keywords determined as a list of at most five 

words occurring at least three times in the 

contexts defining a certain word sense.’(Mihalcea 

and Csomai, 2007). This proved to be 

prohibitively expensive in terms of time taken. 

Thus, only Lesk’s algorithm is used to 

disambiguate keywords in the DBpedia approach. 

However, the results reported by Mihalcea and 

Csomai for WSD using Lesk’s algorithm alone 

are higher than approaches such as Agirre and 

Soroa (2009) and Gomes et al (2003). Thus, 

disambiguation quality is preserved. 

6 Evaluation 

Eight users participated in the evaluation. 

Participants were identified by two means: An 

email circulated in the research group in which the 

authors work; Tweeting at Twitter users from the 

university in which the authors work  

6



The study is split into two sessions. In the first 

session, the user logs in to their Twitter and 

LinkedIn accounts. Their data is then collected 

and analysis performed. In the second session, the 

user is asked to subjectively evaluate DBpedia 

and Extended WordNet Domains with regard to 

each research question. 

It must be noted that the number of participants in 

this experiment was quite small. As such, it would 

be unwise to make strong inferences from the 

results reported below. 

6.1 RQ1 Procedure 

Term comparisons are represented similarly to the 

study performed by Holland et al. (2003). Holland 

et al. represent user preferences for particular 

products in the format ‘A is better than B’. 

For RQ1, the user is shown a series of assertions 

about the relative ranks of terms that appear in 

both their Twitter and LinkedIn term lists. For 

example, if ‘Linguistics’ is the third ranked term 

in the user’s LinkedIn term list but the fifth 

ranked term in their Twitter term list, the user is 

shown a statement asserting that Linguistics has 

less prominence in their tweets than in their 

LinkedIn profile. The user can answer 

affirmatively or negatively to each assertion. 

However, if the analysis has incorrectly identified 

a term, the user can indicate this instead of 

responding. They can also indicate that the term 

denotes an area that was of interest to them, but is 

not anymore.  

If a term appears in the user’s LinkedIn term list 

but not in their Twitter term list, the user is shown 

a statement asserting that the term has less 

prominence in their tweets than in their LinkedIn 

profile. If the user’s LinkedIn term list is empty - 

as occurred with one user whose LinkedIn profile 

was sparse – no comparisons are made. 

6.2 RQ2 Procedure 

The approach for this question is similar to that 

adopted by Lee and Brusilovsky (2009). Lee and 

Brusilovsky use user judgments to evaluate the 

quality of the recommendations generated by their 

system. However, in Lee and Brusilovksy’s study 

a Likert scale is used whereas in this study a 

multiple- choice format is used. 

The user is shown a series of recommendations 

for their LinkedIn profile. The user can answer 

affirmatively or negatively to each 

recommendation. Alternatively, they can indicate 

that although the term denotes an area of interest 

to them they would not add it to their LinkedIn 

profile. This could be because they do not want to 

list the term on their professional profile or they 

do not feel sufficiently confident in their 

knowledge of the subject the term denotes. They 

can also indicate that the term denotes an area that 

was of interest to them, but is not anymore. 

For the DBpedia approach, terms in the format 

‘Branches of X’ are presented to the user as ‘X’, 

as these pages contain lists of sub-disciplines. For 

example, ‘Branches of Psychology’ becomes 

‘Psychology’. Similarly, terms in the format ‘X by 

issue’ are presented to the user as ‘X’. 

A user score is calculated for each lexical 

resource, with each research question contributing 

50%. The scores from each user are then 

aggregated to give a final score for each resource.

Table 1 illustrates the scores for each research 

question, while Table 2 shows error values.

8 Discussion 

 The Extended WordNet Domains approach 

shows almost twice the percentage of incorrectly 

identified terms than the DBpedia approach. It 

also shows more than twice the percentage of 

incorrect recommendations. A reason for this can 

be found by examining the Extended WordNet 

Domains hierarchy. For example, consider the 

word ‘law’. One of the possible synsets for this 

word defines it as ‘the collection of rules imposed 

by authority’. The domain label for this synset is 

‘law’. The hyperonym for this synset is 

‘collection’ whose definition is ‘several things 

grouped together or considered as a whole’. The 

domain label for this synset is ‘philately’. This 

directly contradicts the original WordNet 

Domains hierarchy, in which ‘law’ is a subclass of 

‘social science’. 

The small number of study participants 

notwithstanding, the low error figures in the 

DBpedia approach look promising with regard to 

the task of profile aggregation. Abel et al. find 

that ‘Profile aggregation provides multi-faceted 

profiles that reveal significantly more information 

about the users than individual service profiles 

can provide’ (2010). Thus, a method that can 

accurately compare and combine information 

from a user’s different profiles has value.  

The marked difference between the ‘Total’ and 

‘Total (all recs.)’ columns in Table 1 is also 

noteworthy. This indicates that there are certain 

subjects the study participants intended for 

Twitter, but not for LinkedIn. 

One aspect of this study in need of improvement 

is the prominence comparisons (RQ1). During this 

part of the experiment, some participants said that 

they could not be sure about the relative weights 

of individual subject areas in their tweets and 

LinkedIn profile. However, in this case users were 

instructed to answer negatively so as not to 

artificially inflate scores. One way of overcoming 

this problem could be to generate ranked term lists 

for each profile and ask the user to subjectively 

evaluate each list separately. 

9 Conclusion 

This paper described a comparison between the 

Extended WordNet Domains and DBpedia lexical 

resources. The comparison took the form of an 

investigation of the ways in which users represent 

their interests and knowledge through their 

LinkedIn profile with the way they represent these 

characteristics through their tweets. In a user 

study with 8 participants the DBpedia category
