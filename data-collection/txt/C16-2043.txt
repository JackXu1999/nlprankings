Abstract

This demo presents MAGES (multilingual angle-integrated grouping-based entity summariza-
tion), an entity summarization system for a large knowledge base such as DBpedia based on a
entity-group-bound ranking in a single integrated entity space across multiple language-specific
editions. MAGES offers a multilingual angle-integrated space model, which has the advantage
of overcoming missing semantic tags (i.e., categories) caused by biases in different language
communities, and can contribute to the creation of entity groups that are well-formed and more
stable than the monolingual condition within it. MAGES can help people quickly identify the
essential points of the entities when they search or browse a large volume of entity-centric data.
Evaluation results on the same experimental data demonstrate that our system produces a better
summary compared with other representative DBpedia entity summarization methods.

1 Introduction

The rapid increase in the number of triples in knowledge bases (KBs) has made it imperative to extract
essential information from many relevant and similar facts that describe an entity comprising a set of
entity–property–value triples (e.g.,<Usain Bolt, nationality, Jamaican>,<Usain Bolt, birthPlace, Span-
ish Town>, <Usain Bolt, birthPlace, Jamaica>, <Usain Bolt, placeOfBirth, Jamaica>, <Usain Bolt,
residence, Jamaica>, etc.). Therefore, entity summarization (Cheng et al., 2011), which creates a short
summary from a set of triples from the description of an entity, has attracted much attention in recent
years. This is a method designed to help people quickly identify the essential points of entities when
searching or browsing a large volume of entity-centric data. Although several approaches have been pro-
posed in (Cheng et al., 2011; Thalhammer and Rettinger, 2014; Gunaratna et al., 2015), their qualities are
still far from ideal, and some approaches rely on external resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).

This demo presents a multilingual angle-integrated grouping-based entity summarization system
(MAGES), which is an entity summarization system for the DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2014) based
on the entity-group-bound ranking in an entity space. The intuition of this study is that property–value
pairs—consecutively also called features—shared by an entity’s group’s members (neighborhoods) are
considered more important for their identity than for the features they share with an entity that is not
in their respective neighborhood. For example, there are two distinct groups: A = {“Usain Bolt”, “Carl
Lewis”, “Michael Johnson”} and B = {“Babe Ruth”, “Hyun-jin Ryu”}. Each group has distinguishing
characteristics that can reveal underlying triples that generate entity summaries. Consider the difference
between “Usain Bolt” in A and “Babe Ruth” in B for their typical player characteristics. “Usain Bolt”
has essential properties such as “sport event” or “medal information,” whereas “Babe Ruth” would have
more emphasis on his “position” or “team.”

There are many predefined semantic groups (i.e. types) of entities in DBpedia such as “Baseball
Player,” “Company,” and “Film.” However, although DBpedia has its own mechanisms for setting en-
tity types, its coverage of the entity types is not sufficient. Moreover, the types of each entity, if they

exist, are not stable enough to make a summary for the entity’s description because of mismatches be-
tween defined type and actual entity descriptions. Therefore, new entity grouping is necessary, especially
the grouping of entities in their multilingual angle integration to ensure that no relevant information
is biased towards one specific language edition. DBpedia currently serves over 120 language editions
extracted from language-specific Wikipedias that can contain different information from one language
to another (Lehmann et al., 2014). In particular, language-specific editions can provide 1) more details
about certain topics and 2) information missed in other DBpedia editions according to a specific cultural
viewpoint. Unlike the prior studies of entity summarization, we particularly focus on methods for in-
corporating a variety of different lingual information scattered in Linked Open Data (Bizer et al., 2009)
to enhance entities’ topic detection. A multilingual angle-integrated space model can contribute to the
creation of entity groups that are well-formed and more stable than the monolingual condition within it.

2 System Description

Figure 1 (a) shows the outline of the proposed system. It comprises the following steps: i) we mine all
lingual category tags from multiple DBpedia language editions to create information about distinct entity
groups, ii) Each feature is ranked based on the pertinent features of the in-group, and iii) We iteratively
choose highly ordered and less similar facts by adopting a feature-ranking system.

2.1 Multilingual Angle-integrated Grouping

While observing the unstable manifestation of entity types in a KB’s triples, category information will
be used as a more stable source of clustering entities in a multilingual integrated space. We utilized the
category tags to infer the topics of entities to build the entities’ fine-grained semantic group. We inte-
grated different languages’ biased category tags into a single space that could help overcome missing
categories and could help detect highly informative keywords for more stable entity grouping. For exam-
ple, comparing the DBpedia Korean, English and Japanese editions of categories for “Jejudo” in Figure
1 (b), several categories are only in one monolingual edition: “Islands of the Sea of Japan” is only in the
English edition and “지리[jili]” (“Geography”) is only in the Korean edition.

Then, we induced a set of disjointed clusters in which each entity in DBpedia is categorized into a
cluster (that represents an entity group) by executing a clustering process over the multilingual integrated
entity space generated by weaving different category tags from several DBpedia language editions. The

204



vector space of tokens from categories was used to identify the characteristics of an entity, such as
“islands,” “sea,” and “japan,” for a given entity “Jejudo” as in Figure 1 (b). We employed the k-means
algorithm to accomplish this, because it is regarded as one of the simplest and most efficient unsupervised
learning algorithms for clustering large data sets (J. A. Hartigan, 1979). The value of k for the k-means
algorithm is determined by the number of types that exist in DBpedia.

2.2 In-Group Triple Ranking
In this step, all triples about each entity are ranked according to the in-group-relevance scoring formula.
The working principle behind triple ranking is that we assign a higher score to triples that contain more
relevant properties with high frequencies to reflect the importance of a property to a group, and more
relevant values have higher correlations between two entities for a given triple. Hence, the score of a
triple tep,v is defined as

score(tep,v) = p score(e, p) + v score(e, v)
+ λ(p score(e, p)× v score(e, v)),

(1)

where p score(e, p) is a weight assigned to the property p for the group of e, the v score(e, v) is
a correlation weight assigned to the value v for the entity e, and λ is a tuning parameter that deter-
mines the ratio of the synergy indicators. The p score is derived by a property-weighting function that
obtains the properties that interact most strongly in the in-group space for frequencies of labels of prop-
erties. This scheme is based on the label of an in-group property specifically influenced by the term
frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique to obtain the top labels from each group.
The v score is derived by a correlation measure that is used in the case of two related entities; we as-
sume that two entities are highly correlated when the fraction of triples that are in common with the total
number of triples of both entities is higher.

2.3 Redundancy Checker
After the obtention of the triple ranking results, we focus on generating a summary of the triple collection
by considering both relevance and anti-redundancy, until a given length of summary is reached. We
attempt to iteratively measure the similarity of the next candidate triple to previously selected ones, and
select a candidate if its similarity is below a threshold (user parameter) until the length limit of summary
(σ) is reached. Given that a triple is much shorter than a sentence, most terms are specified within the
KB. Therefore, a sequence matching procedure (Mount, 2004) provides the similarity measure among
the words that appear in triples.

3 Experiments and Evaluation

We utilize the 10 largest languages in DBpedia—English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian,
Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, and Swedish—to project multilingual category information into a single space
that provides integrated multi-angled semantics of each entity. All the category tags of the entities are
tokenized and represented as vector stem words for entity grouping. Category tags marked in a different
language are translated into English through the owl:sameAs link in the linked data. We assume that if
two category tags are connected by means of this link, those categories can be considered to be the same.

As a current state-of-the-art method, FACeted Entity Summarization (FACES) (Gunaratna et al., 2015)
aims to improve the coverage of its summarization using a conceptually different set of facts, called facets
of an entity. The authors of FACES shared gold-standard entity summaries given by a group of human
experts that consisted of 5 and 10 triples for each of the selected 50 entities in DBpedia. These are
referred to as ideal summaries in our study.

Evaluations of the summarization systems use an ideal summary provided by multiple human anno-
tators by counting the unit overlaps with the generated summary, which is regarded as the quality such
as in Equation 2 (Cheng et al., 2011), where n is the number of human annotators required to produce
the individual ideal summaries denoted by SummIi (e) for i = 1, . . . , n, and the automatically generated

205



summary is denoted by Summ(e) for the entity e. The summary that achieves the highest quality score
is considered to be the most similar to the ideal summary. Given σ ∈ 5, 10, an entity e and n ideal sum-
maries received, their agreements (Cheng et al., 2011) averaged over all entities are 1.9596 and 4.6770
for σ = 5 and 10, respectively.

Table 1 shows the performance evaluation results of MAGES compared to FACES and other baselines.
We considered several baselines to analyze the effectiveness of the entity group-based approaches. The
simplest baseline was to build a group of entities utilizing the assigned entity types in KB (Typed).
Another baseline that we considered was to build entity groups using monolingual categories (GES). It
is clear from the Table 1 that our group-based summarization approach outperformed FACES in terms
of the summarization quality. Moreover, a two-tailed paired t-test was performed to verify the statistical
significance of the performance improvement. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. For the top-5 and
top-10 lists, the respective p values for MAGES against FACES were 0.02013 and 0.00152. Thus, our
approach provides significantly better results than FACES. FACES provides a faceted summary of a
given length by incorporating at least one feature from each facet. However, several important facts for a
summary may be present in one facet; thus, a summary in each facet unit is not always ideal. Moreover,
FACES expands each feature to obtain a set of words that rely on the external resource WordNet (e.g.,
hypernyms). However, WordNet does not always cover concepts in the KB, particularly relatively less
popular concepts in English. For example, “Busan” is South Korea’s second largest city after “Seoul,”
but the former is not indicated as such in WordNet. Thus “Busan” cannot be expanded as a “place” or
“area” by the method used in FACES.

We also performed a random sampling analysis to verify the statistical significance of the integration
of multiple lingual entity spaces, because an unbalanced number of tokens for clustering could affect
the overall result. First, we selected 10,000 random tokens per system (GES and MAGES) to partition
our original tokens into small- and same-sized token sets for the two approaches. Then, we executed
clustering with these ingredients, and computed the Purity score (Amigó et al., 2009) for the clustering
results of each system, in which the type information from DBpedia is gold standard. The average score
of 100 random sampling experiments for MAGES (0.4777) was higher than that of experiments for GES
(0.4607). A statistical evaluation using a two-sample paired t-test showed a p value equal to 2.28726 ×
10−5. MAGES exhibited a 0.03% improvement for the summary quality compared to the GES method
for a top-five summary, as shown in Table 1. In other words, multilingual grouping comprises a signature
to describe the main features of an entity in a group. In addition, it can help entities that are hidden in the
long tail of a monolingual space.

Systems σ = 5 σ = 10
FACES (state-of-the-art) 1.4611 4.3641
MAGES 1.7082 4.5523
GES 1.6727 4.4191
Typed 1.4651 4.1120

4 Conclusion

In this demo, we have presented MAGES, which is a system for configuring a summary within en-
tity groups for entities of a data set in DBpedia. Our evaluation shows that the MAGES approach to
summary generation outperforms another DBpedia entity summarization system when compared to the
user-created benchmark. Moreover, MAGES can extract a particular group’s stable signatures using mul-
tilingual angle integration, which can provide a useful strategy for identifying the nature of a described
entity.
