Abstract 

Adult second language learners face the daunting but underappreciated task of mastering patterns of 

language use that are neither products of fully productive grammar rules nor frozen items to be memorized. 

Word Midas3, a web browser extension, targets this uncharted territory of lexicogrammar by detecting 

multiword tokens of lexicogrammatical patterning in real time in situ within the noisy digital texts from 

the user’s unscripted web browsing or other digital venues. The language model powering Word Midas is 

StringNet, a densely cross-indexed navigable network of one billion lexicogrammatical patterns of 

English. These resources are described and their functionality is illustrated with a detailed scenario. 

1 Background 

Some of the most persistent yet underappreciated challenges in learning a second language are to be 

found not within the purview of highly productive grammar rules nor in particular lexical items whose 

behavior is well described by those rules and by traditional dictionary entries. They lie rather in a vast 

and poorly charted middle ground between items and rules, a territory of semi-productive and lexically 

picky patterns, what Halliday referred to as “lexis as most delicate grammar” (1961) and others call 

lexico-grammatical constructions (Kay, 1997). In addition to escaping coverage in traditional 

knowledge resources, this cline of lexicogrammar often skirts the awareness of language teachers. In 

the absence of reference books and teachers, children learn these elusive and variegated patterns in their 

first language by some combination of immersive encounters with tokens of language in use and their 

uncanny acumen in distilling abstract patterns from these tokens. Rare is the adult second language 

learner, however, who shares the child’s urgency and immersion in target language input or the child’s 

capacity for detecting patterns from it. The tools we present in this paper address basic challenges posed 

to adult learners and their teachers by this intermediate territory of lexicogrammar. 

As an example of the challenge, the string a wide range of issues conforms to maximally general rules 

of English grammar, and so that would seem adequate to a command of this expression. This is mis-

leading, however. Simpson-Vlack and Ellis (2010) identified the 4-gram a wide range of as the top-

ranked item on their corpus-derived academic formula list. This shows that the co-occurrence of the 

words in that 4-gram is the result of more than simply general combinatorial rules of syntax and that it 

deserves more attention from learners than grammar alone would indicate. Our point is that here, as in 

so many patterns that pervade language, the expression is neither a frozen, one-off item nor simply a 

product of maximally general rules combining words. Rather, a wide range of is part of a tight nexus of 

limited but inter-related variations: a [wide/broad/whole/vast] range of; a wide [range/variety/ar-

ray/spectrum] of.

The problem we address is this: With current resources, it is virtually impossible for situated learners 

to get any sense of which strings in their input are instantiations of lexicogrammatical patterning and, 

for those that are, what variations on those strings are possible. The system we present, called Word 

Midas, detects tokens of such patterns in noisy digital text of the readers’ choice and shows the paradig-

matic variation that is not present in the text but which constitutes the possibilities available there that 

are part of a mature language users grasp of the language. In what follows we describe the components 

of the system and illustrate its workings with a detailed scenario. 

2 The System 

The system has two basic components: (1) an existing, corpus-derived English language model called 

StringNet (nav4.stringnet.org), consisting of over one billion unique lexicogrammatical patterns; (2) a 

web browser plugin tool called Word Midas, which detects multiword strings in digital text that are 

instantiations of any of the lexicogrammatical patterns from the language model (StringNet). 

2.1 The Language Model: StringNet 

StringNet (Wible and Tsao, 2010; 2011) contains not only n-grams extracted from the British National 

Corpus (BNC) such as the trigram as good as, but also what Wible and Tsao (2010) call “hybrid n-

grams,” that is, more abstract n-grams where grams can include part-of-speech categories, for example, 

as [adj] as. The gram types that can compose hybrid n-grams fall into one of four levels of abstraction: 

word form (made, makes), lemma (make, subsuming make, makes, made, making), detailed part of 

speech (V-past), and rough part of speech (V). StringNet is a relational network in which the one billion 

unique hybrid n-grams are those from 2 to 6 grams in length instantiated in BNC with 5 or more tokens. 

These are cross-indexed for subsumption and inclusion relations. Thus, the n-gram as good  as is indexed 

to its more abstract counterpart as [adj] as and to its longer counterparts, for example as good  as his 

word; as good as [poss pro] word; and be as good as his word. Slots in hybrid n-grams differ in how 

open or selective they are in the words that can appear in them. The selective slots can be detected 

computationally within the more than one billion hybrid n-grams in StringNet and have served as con-

textual clues flagging slots of semantically similar words, what Tsao and Wible (2013) call “construc-

tional selection.” 

2.2 The In Situ Tool: Word Midas 

The basic conception of a browser-based tool that identifies multiword patterns in real time within texts 

that the user freely browses was first implemented in a tool called Collocator that detected two-word 

collocations (Wible et al., 2011). In the present paper, Word Midas extends the conception to the im-

mensely more complex challenge of detecting lexicogrammatical patterns. Recall a fundamental chal-

lenge which language input poses to learners and which Word Midas aims to address: the tokens of word 

strings that a user encounters in input do not directly signal the lexico-grammatical pattern(s) that they 

betoken. This severely limits the value of such tokens and such encounters for learning unfamiliar pat-

terns of the language behind them. Word Midas provides a reader in real time with links from the tokens 

in a text to the patterns they instantiate. 

We illustrate the workings of Word Midas through a scenario for its use. This involves a person 

browsing web content with Word Midas installed on their browser as a Chrome extension or a plug-in. 

The user can select any word or string of words found in that web page in order to discover whether it 

is used there as part of a pattern and if so what variations are possible that are not there in that text. 

Figure 1 shows a webpage where the user has paused at the string “In a region where many people eat 

chocolate on a daily basis…” and wonders about the string on a daily basis here or simply about one of 

the words in that string as used here. Word Midas is activated from a context menu that appears by right-

clicking on any word in that string. Activating Word Midas from that context menu launches a search 

for patterns that include the selected word and fall within a nine-word window of context surrounding 

it. The results are listed in a popup as shown in Figure 1.  

Word Midas results are derived in three steps. First, string matching identifies all n-grams that include 

the user-selected word and match the context of that word in the text where the user found it. Then, an 

adapted edit-distance algorithm identifies abstract hybrid n-grams that also describe n-grams  identified 

in the first step (see Wible and Tsao 2009 on this adaptation of edit distance). Third, pruning and ranking 

22



algorithms evaluate these patterns using weighted features (including edit distance scores) that assess 

two competing requirements: their closeness of match to the target text and their productivity in wider 

use (see Wible and Tsao 2010 for details on this pruning and ranking of StringNet patterns). To see the 

significance of this, we return to the example. 

The popup in Figure 1 lists the hybrid n-gram patterns that describe strings found surrounding the 

selected word and, for each pattern, gives its frequency in BNC and links to a concordance of sentences 

containing that pattern. In this case, the top three patterns listed (with their frequencies) are: [noun] on 

a daily basis (60); [noun sg] on a daily basis (35); on a daily basis (150). The prominent frequency of 

the third pattern (on a daily basis) invites further exploration.

From here, Word Midas helps answer key question about lexicogrammatical patterning that an un-

aided reader cannot: What variations of this string are possible? Clicking on any word in the pattern on 

a daily basis where it appears in the popup list shows the user the paradigm of all words attested in that 

slot, indicating whether the word there is the only option or replaceable, and if replaceable, whether 

variation is relatively open or restricted. This can be done for each word in the sequence. In this case, 

the first word in on a daily basis, the preposition on, is shown to be the only attested word in its slot as 

is the indefinite article a which follows it. In turn, the noun basis in this frame, while replaceable, is 

hands down the most likely word in its position; its frequency there is 150 while the second most fre-

quent noun, rate, has a frequency of only three. The limited substitutability in this four-word sequence 

for these three slots --on, a, and basis--demonstrate Sinclair’s “idiom principle,” that is, they are cases 

of tight limitations on lexical choice far more restrictive than grammar can account for. Turning to the 

adjective daily in this sequence, however, we discover a different phenomenon. Word Midas shows that 

the word daily in the sequence on a daily basis is occupying a slot that exhibits a dramatically wider 

variation than any of the other slots in this string, with 469 different adjectives attested in that position: 

on a [adj] basis. This can be seen in the paradigm for that slot shown partially in Figure 2. Thus, we can 

discover that on a daily basis is just one member in a family of variations, and that the locus of variation 

is concentrated in the [adj] slot. 

on a [daily/regular/voluntary/day-to-day/part-time/temporary…] basis

3 Conclusion 

There are some major points to note from this extended example. The relative freedom exhibited in the 

slot occupied by daily in the string on a daily basis and the corresponding lack of freedom in its co-

occurring slots are symptomatic of the regularity and idiomaticity that comingle in lexicogrammatical 

constructions. This mix of features is undetectable from simple encounters with multiword tokens in 

text and unrepresented in dictionaries and grammar references. Access to these features requires access 

to the paradigmatic dimension of input. That access is what StringNet and Word Midas aim to provide 

to situated, unscripted users in real time for any part of noisy text they wish to explore.
