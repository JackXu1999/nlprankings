Abstract 

The paper focuses on derivationally connected verbs in Croatian, i.e. on verbs that share the 
same lexical morpheme and are derived from other verbs via prefixation, suffixation and/or stem 
alternations. As in other Slavic languages with rich derivational morphology, each verb is 
marked for aspect, either perfective or imperfective. Some verbs, mostly of foreign origin, are 
marked as bi-aspectual verbs. The main objective of this paper is to detect and to describe major 
derivational processes and affixes used in the derivation of aspectually connected verbs with 
NooJ. Annotated chains are exported into a format adequate for a web-based system and further 
used to enhance the aspectual and derivational information for each verb. 

1 Introduction* 

In this paper we deal with the representation of derivational processes in Croatian, a South Slavic lan-
guage with rich inflectional and derivational morphology. The paper focuses on derivationally connected 
verbs, i.e. on those verbs which share the same lexical morpheme and which are derived from other 
verbs mostly via prefixation and suffixation. As in other Slavic languages, each verb is always marked 
for aspect and classified as perfective, imperfective, or bi-aspectual. Generally, the imperfective aspect 
is used to describe actions, processes and states as unfinished or ongoing, whereas the imperfective 
aspect refers to them as finished or completed, e.g.: 

• 1a. Pisao sam (imperfective) pismo jedan sat. 1b. I was writing a letter for an hour. 

• 2a. Napisao (perfective) sam pismo za jedan sat. 2b. I wrote a letter in an hour. 

Verbs like pisati "to write + imperfective" and napisati "to write, to finish writing + perfective" are 
referred to as aspectual pairs. Verbs in aspectual pairs are closely related in meaning, except that one 
expresses imperfective and the other perfective aspect. Aspect in Croatian is morphologically marked 
in each verbal form and it affects inflectional properties of verbs (e.g. only perfectives can be used in 
aorist, and imperfectives in imperfective past tense; gerunds are commonly formed by imperfectives 

etc). Aspect in Croatian is regarded as a word-formation process and members of aspectual pairs are 
treated as separate lexical entries in dictionaries. In terms of derivation, perfectives are commonly de-
rived from imperfectives by prefixation, while imperfectives are formed from perfectives by suffixation 
or stem alternation. The presence of a certain affix indicates whether a verb is a perfective or an imper-
fective. A relatively small group of bi-aspectual verbs, predominantly of foreign origin, can be used as 
perfectives and imperfectives in the same morphological form. Various factors can determine whether 
they will be used as a perfectives or imperfectives (e.g. a context, the type of time adverbial used in a 
sentence etc.). Although based on the opposition of only two aspects and overtly marked, numerous

studies in the area of second language acquisition indicate that aspect is one of the most complicated 
category for learners of Slavic languages.  

In this paper we present preliminary stages in the construction of the database of Croatian aspectually 
and derivationally connected verbs, i.e. aspectual derivatives. Apart from its potential pedagogical use, 
the database of aspectual derivatives is one of the first attempts to systematically present this area of 
Croatian derivational morphology. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we briefly describe 
major derivational processes in Croatian and focus on the derivation of verbs from other verbs and 
aspectual changes that take place. Sections 3 and 4 present the processing of aspectual derivatives in 
Croatian in NooJ and provide an overview of underlying principles. In Section 5, the design and the 
structure of the database is discussed. The paper concludes with an outline of future work. 

2 Derivation of verbs 

Major word-formation processes in Croatian are derivation and compounding. Further we discuss only 
derivation which predominantly consists of affixation. Although there are some other processes like 
conversion or back formation, they are not as prominent as prefixation or suffixation (Šojat et al, 2013). 

Croatian verbs can be thus divided into simple imperfectives (pisati "to write + imperfective") and 
prefixed perfectives (na-pisati "to write + perfective") denoting that the action is completed. Other pre-
fixes used for the derivation of perfectives add different semantic features (pisati "to write + imperfec-
tive" – pre-pisati "to copy by writing + perfective" – pot-pisati "to sign + perfective") and enable further 
derivation, either through prefixation, suffixation or simultaneous prefixation and suffixation. These 
perfectives can be derived into secondary imperfectives denoting iterative actions through suffixation 
(potpis-ivati "to sign several / many times"). Other suffixes are used for the derivation of diminutive 
verbs (e.g. pisati– pis-karati "to scribble + imperfective") or verbs expressing punctual actions (vikati 
"to shout + imperfective" – viknuti "to shout once + perfective"). Further, some secondary imperfectives 
are derived via prefixation into perfectives denoting distributive actions (is-potpisivati – "to sign each 
one + perfective", e.g. each letter, every document etc.). In some cases aspectual distinctions are ex-
pressed by vowel variations or suppletive forms (e.g. doći "to come + perfective" – dolaziti "to come + 
imperfective"). Detailed account of morpho-semantic relations among Croatian verbal derivatives is 
found in Šojat et al. (2012). 

In the following section we show how existing language resources can benefit from the information 
about verbal aspect in terms of their extension and enrichment. We demonstrate this on the inflectional 
dictionary for Croatian verbs in NooJ. 

3 Verbs in NooJ Dictionary 

The main language resources (LR) for Croatian, as prepared in Vučković (2009) and explained in 
Vučković et al. (2010), include the dictionary of Croatian verbs. Each verb was originally marked for 
the main category <V>, reflexive property <V+Prelaz=pov> and a paradigm rule FLX responsible for 
describing the rules used to build all the simple verb forms,1 for example:  

pisati,V+FLX=PISATI    “to write” 

asistirati,V+FLX=SJATI   “to assist” 

sjati,V+Prelaz=pov+FLX=SJATI  “to shine”. 

In all cases, a name of a verb is used as a representative of a specific conjugation paradigm. For 
example, the verb sjati “to shine” uses the set of conjugation rules that we refer to as SJATI 
<FLX=SJATI>. All the other verbs that share the same set of conjugation rules will be associated with 
this name of the paradigm like the verb asistirati "to assist." In addition to these three markers, a small 
subset of verbs was also marked for valency (Vučković et al., 2010) to improve the performance of the 
Croatian chunker and some verbs were marked for aspect. 

Although each Croatian verb has an aspect by its nature, either perfective, imperfective or bi-aspec-
tual, this information was not originally encoded into the main dictionary entries. This is mainly due to

mars and are beyond the scope of this paper.

the absence of that information in the resources built after the MULTEXT-East specifications prepared 
by Tadić, as explained in Erjavec (2001), from which NooJ resources have been adopted. 

There are 4,168 main verb entries in the NooJ Croatian dictionary. At the beginning of our project, 
there were only 1,448 verbs that had been marked as either perfective <Aspect=perf>, imperfective 
<Aspect=imperf> or bi-aspectual <Aspect=bi> regarding the Category of aspect (Table 1). This means 
that little over 65% of verbs had no marker assigned for this category. 

 

Total +perf +imperf +bi no marker 

4,168 673 534 241 2,720 

Table 1: Original distribution of Aspect markers 

The importance of information on aspect encoded in the verb, lies, among others, in the list of possible 
verbal forms. For example, only perfective verbs can have aorist past tense and past adverbial participle 
forms, while only imperfective verbs can have the imperfect past tense and the present adverbial parti-
ciple. Before we could add the tag for aspect automatically to the remaining verbs, it was important to 
check if the existing aspect markers were correctly assigned and what data could be used to correctly 
mark the remaining 65% of verbs. Since the list of possible tenses is embedded into the conjugation 
paradigms (FLX), we decided to start our investigation with them. 

3.1 Data Analysis of the original dictionary 

At the very beginning of our analysis, we found two paradigms that were using both Aorist and Imperfect 
endings [FLX=POKLONITI and FLX=BIRATIDODATI]. Two does not sound like a large number, but 
if we take into account that the POKLONITI paradigm is responsible for the conjugation of 106 verbs 
and the BIRATIDODATI paradigm for 204, we are not talking small numbers any more. We proceeded 
with the analysis by double-checking each of the 310 verbs. We learned that all the verbs using the 
POKLONITI paradigm are actually perfective in aspect (as is the paradigm itself), while the other verbs 
are all dual which makes the presence of aorist and imperfect endings appropriate. Thus, we were able 
to annotate these verbs with appropriate markers <Aspect=perf> and <Aspect=bi>, respectively. In ad-
dition, we revisited the POKLONITI paradigm and removed the endings for Imperfect. At this point, we 
also decided to recheck the aspect category of all the verbs. 

To avoid individual checking each verb, we cross referenced all of the assigned aspects with the aspect 
of a verb used to mark the conjugation paradigm. From that list (Table 2), after removing all the verbs 
whose aspect matched the aspect of a paradigm, and all the verbs that had no aspect defined, we were 
left with only 62 verbs that had been marked as mismatched and that needed to be checked manually.  

Since the reason for the mismatched aspect could be due to either an incorrectly marked aspect of a 
verb or to an incorrectly described paradigm, we checked both, starting with the verbs. Paradigm anal-
ysis revealed some missing aorist and/or past participle descriptions in the category of perfective verbs, 
and missing imperfect and/or present participle descriptions of imperfective verbs. Also, some descrip-
tions of bi-aspectuals were missing, either aorist and past participle descriptions, or imperfect and pre-
sent participle descriptions. All of these cases were corrected to mirror the related aspect, either by cor-
recting the value of an Aspect attribute or changing the paradigm name. 

For the final analysis we wanted to make sure that there are no duplicates among our paradigms, i.e. 
that we do not have different paradigm names describing the same conjugation occurrences. We detected 
16 such occurrences that we have replaced choosing the one paradigm that was used more often in the 
dictionary. 

3.2 The new verb dictionary and paradigms 

There are 209 paradigms that describe the conjugation rules for Croatian verbs. Some rules describe 
only one verb in a dictionary (there are 67 such rules), while others describe more (Figure 1). The largest 
number of verbs (538) described by the same paradigm BIRATI make up 13% of all the verbs in the 
dictionary, while the second runner up (SJATI) describes 7% of verbs.

Table 2. Distribution of different aspects assigned to paradigms 

 

 

Figure 1. Distribution of paradigms among Croatian verbs 

However, a closer look shows us that these descriptions are not as different as they might first appear. 
We will show this through a detailed analysis of simple verb forms by tense category, starting with 
present tense. 

What makes these paradigms different is the list of tenses they describe, but also how each tense is 
described. These two categories (list of tenses, form of tenses) are linked by an OR operator, meaning 
that the difference in either one or both from the existing list of paradigms, results in a new paradigm.  

To demonstrate, let us compare the UGOJITI and POKLONITI paradigms. They both have the same 
list of tenses they can form (present, imperative, PDR - verbal adjective active, PDT - verbal adjective 
passive, aorist and GPP - past adverbial participle), but the way they make PDT differs [<B3>en(:PDT) 
and <B3>jen(:PDT) respectfully] and thus they form different paradigm rules.

However, since NooJ allows multiple usage of its grammars (Silberztein, 2016), each tense rule is 
described as a separate sub-grammar and then called from a paradigm, where needed. In order to de-
scribe derivations of Croatian simple verb forms that are in the NooJ dictionary, we built 280 such sub-
grammars whose different combinations build 209 paradigms that describe 4,168 verbs and recognize 
377,603 forms, taking into account simple verb tenses (long/short infinitive, present, imperfect, aorist, 
passive/active verbal adjectives, imperative, present/past adverbial participles), gender (masculine, fem-
inine, neutral), number (singular, plural) and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd).  

 

 

Figure 2. Distribution of sub-grammars per tense 

As expected, inside each tense category, some descriptions are more common than others. This dis-
tribution (Figure 2) is different for each of the tenses. The same is true for the number of rules which 
ranges from 15 (GPP) to 61 (Present). The number of paradigms that do not have rules for a tense are 
marked in gray (for example: 2,153 paradigms do not have Imperfect, 2,079 do not have GPP, 2,015 do 
not have GPS etc.). Present is the only tense that is found in all paradigms. 

 

 

Figure 3. Distribution of Present rules used among existing verbs 

Figure 3 shows the distribution of rules2 used to build the present tense found in the existing 209 
paradigms. It may look as if there are 61 different suffixes for the Croatian present, but this is not the 
case. Throughout the paradigms, the same set of suffixes is used for all three genders (male, female, 
neutral), for all three persons singular [-m, -š, -/], and for the first and second person plural [-mo, -te]. 
The third person plural may have the ending [-e] or [-u]. So, why are there 61 different present tense 
descriptions in this figure?  

Although the set of suffixes is the same (with two possible alterations for 3rd person plural), changes 
that occur before the suffix differ. In some cases it is enough to only remove (<B2>) the infinitive ending

(-ti or –ći) and add the suffix, but in some cases more letters need to be removed (<B3>..<B5>) and 
more letters prior to the suffix need to be added, like in the following examples:  

isteći -> <B2>če(:PRsingular) => istečem [removes last 2 charac-

ters, inserts ‘če’ before adding suffix for Present] 

izleći -> <B2>že(:PRsingular) => izležem [removes last 2 charac-

ters, inserts ‘že’ before adding suffix for Present] 

otprijeti -> <B5>e(:PRsingular) => otprem [removes last 5 char-

acters, inserts ‘e’ before adding suffix for Present]. 

After removing duplicate verbs from the dictionary and sorting out the paradigm sets, we were able 
to automatically add the missing aspect information for all unmarked verbs. Their total now amounts to 
4,134. The largest aspect category are perfective verbs, followed by imperfective verbs and bi-aspectual 
verbs. Their distribution is visualized in Figure 4.

and number of paradigms used to describe each category 

4 Grammar modeling for aspectual derivatives 

Computational derivation is a well-known process when new words need to be created in order to eco-
nomically enlarge the dictionary (Trost, 2003). NooJ provides two routes to describe derivations.  

The first one uses a derivational module that allows a direct link between the dictionary with the list 
of words that can be derived and a grammar that provides rules for their derivation either graphically in 
a form of an enhanced recursive transition network (ERTN) or via formal grammar rules as context-free 
grammar (CFG). This link is defined via an attribute DRV that holds the name of the paradigm respon-
sible for the allowed derivation(s). 

The second one uses a morphological grammar module that may simulate the dictionary entries via 
ERTN. It can recognize a defined set of letters and tag them in the same manner that we would manually 
do in the dictionary. The difference is that in the grammar can have a few graphs describing multiple 
dictionary entries (e.g. if we wanted to recognize and tag roman numerals, we can do it by a minimum 
of five graphs or by 3,999 dictionary entries).  

Since our main objective is to produce derivational paths in a format that we can use to populate the 
web-based database, we have opted for the second approach that left us more room to accommodate the 
output to the database design (see Figure 5). To avoid recognizing words that start with the same set of 
letters as prefixes used in derivations, we introduced the constraint that the dictionary check and validate 
if the primary verb first exists. So, for example, sufinancirati "co-finance" will be recognized, since 
there is a verb ‘financirati,V’ in the dictionary. On the other hand, the word suncobran “parasol” will 
not be recognized, since there is no dictionary entry marked as ‘ncobran,V’ (nor any such word in Cro-
atian).   

For the preliminary grammar model, we used all the derivations for the verb pisati “to write” (Table 
3a) and the verbs bacati / baciti “to throw away” (Table3b). All the pairs have both perfective and 



34

imperfective forms. This is not true in only two cases: for the derived form napisati that has no aspectual 
pair, and the aspectual pair ispotpisati - ispotpisivati that share the same aspect (perfective).3 If we put 
aside these two exceptions, from the remaining pairs we can conclude that if there is a verb in the dic-
tionary to which a prefix is added, then the newly derived verb will be perfective in aspect. If a verb 
derived in such a manner adds the suffix2 (SUF 2), then the new verb will be imperfective in aspect if 
the length of suffix2 is 3 or 4 and perfective if its length is 0, 1 or 2. 

 

 

Table 3. Aspectual derivatives of the root verbs  
a) PISATI "to write" and b) BACATI / BACITI "to throw away" 

We have applied these rules to the morphological grammar built in NooJ. Figure 5 illustrates how the 
grammar works, using the verb ispisivati “to write out.”  

 

 

Figure 5. Morphological grammar that recognizes and annotates a verb derived by  
a single prefixation and suffixation (example of the verb ispisivati) 

Possible prefixes in the first position (i.e. the position closest to the root), such as the prefix is, are 
listed in the P1_ node. The following node holds any set of letters which are recognized as the root of 
the verb used to build the constraints that check if such a root concatenated with a + ti exists in the 
dictionary as a verb in infinitive form whose Aspect is defined as INF <pis+a+ti=:V+INF+inf>. If this 
constraint is validated, we check against the length of suffix2. Since the length in our example is 3, we 
proceed with the path where <$@S2$LENGTH=3>. It then leads us to the annotation section that ads 
                                                 
3 This may be due to the fact that the verb ispotpisivati is actually derived from potpisivati, while the verb ispotpisati is re-
dundant in semantical meaning of its prefixes i.e. the prefix is does not bring anything new to the meaning of pot in this con-
text. In the hrWaC 2.2 web corpus (Ljubešić & Klubička, 2014) it shows up only 7 times, mostly in an informal web setting. 



35

the recognized lemma as the superlemma of the derived verb, and marks the POS, Root and Derivational 
chain with the aspect marker for each derivation [+DERIV=pisati_inf->ispisati_fin->ispisivati_inf]. 
This information is then exported from NooJ and added to the Specifics table of our web database as 
discussed in Section 5. 

In Table 3b, there is an imperfective verb BACATI "to throw away" from which the perfective verb 
nabacati "to throw onto" is derived by prefixation. Its imperfective pair is the verb nabacivati "to throw 
onto" derived via suffixation. The perfective verb BACITI uses prefixation to produce a perfective form 
nabaciti whose imperfective pair is also nabacivati. This means that the imperfective form nabacivati 
should be found in both aspectual derivational chains. But, ambiguity is not a stranger to language. 

5 Database and interface design 

After extracting data into usable chunks, we wanted to present it in a way usable to others. To reach the 
widest possible audience with our tool, we focused on bringing it to the web. In that way it will be 
available to everyone with basic Internet access and can be dynamically updated as new chains are 
prepared within NooJ. However, to accomplish that, we needed to create a searchable interface backbone 
in a well-structured database, whose main function is to support our information system as defined in 
Gunjal (2003). 

Due to the nature of our data, we decided to split it into three separate semantic data-groups (Figure 
6). The Main data set stores all the data at the morphological level that will be searchable through the 
online tool, with various levels of granularity. The Specifics provides derivational data focusing on one 
model used for the derivation. The Examples set unifies all the semantics and should provide a better 
understanding of the verb’s usage.  

 

 

Figure 6. Data structure of three data groups 

Since we are using csv to represent our data, it is already in a rather structured state. Thus, our data 
can be described as a structure in the first normal form. This means that the data itself can fit into tabular 
format and that it always contains only one value for each cell. The first normal form also assumes the 
usage of primary keys for the unique representation of every row of data. This can be performed auto-
matically while importing it into the database as described in Gilfillan (2015).  

As can be seen, there is still some redundant data (Figure 6) since the Main Data file contains both 
Form and Root components, present in other files as well. The idea behind the interface is to allow users 
to search either by Form or Root fields with additional (optional) Suffix and Prefix information, and then 
conditionally showing examples and specifics depending on which Form is selected. Thus we can reduce 
the clutter in the other two files by imposing a foreign key constraint after importing it into our database 
and removing Form and Root information from the other two tables (since that data will already be in 
the search results from querying the Main Data file). 

We used MySQL (Coulter, 2017) to store the data and created primary keys, as well as foreign key 
constraints. After importing all the data and imposing foreign key constraints, we are left with 3 tables 
(Figure 7) with almost identical structure as we had at the beginning (Figure 6). Now the Form and Root 
fields are present exclusively in the Main Data table. In order to access it from other tables, we use the 
foreign key named mainID constrained to the ID field. It also acts as the primary key of our Main Data 
table. The foreign key constraint is set up in a way that easily enables us to update or delete multiple 
records at once without ever leaving the Main Data table.

Figure 7. Representation of tables and their data in the database 

Furthermore, a search is performed on only one (Main Data) table with all the additional information 

retrieved only upon the user’s request. Figure 8 depicts one such instance when the verb form ispisivati 

is selected for search.4 The derivational chain [Derivacija: pisati -> ispisati -> ispisivati] holds additional 

information on aspect that is color-coded (perfective verbs are marked in red, imperfectives in blue) and 

available via a hover feature.

6 Conclusion 

In this paper we showed some preliminary steps taken in the processing of Croatian aspectual pairs. This 

phase of the project consists of the extension of the existing verb dictionary and its enrichment with the 

information on verbal aspect. This preliminary step resulted in the significant expansion and improve-

ment of its coverage. The second step that was taken in the preliminary stage was to design and to build 

the web-based database of aspectual derivatives. The database will enable various types of queries and 

provide information about affixes used in a specific derivational process, full derivation chains of verbs, 

basic meaning definitions, contextual examples, etc. Out next goal is to populate the database with as-

pectual derivatives from other derivational families. The database will remain free for on-line search.
