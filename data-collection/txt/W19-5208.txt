Abstract

The effect of translationese has been studied in
the field of machine translation (MT), mostly
with respect to training data. We study in
depth the effect of translationese on test data,
using the test sets from the last three editions
of WMT’s news shared task, containing 17
translation directions. We show evidence that
(i) the use of translationese in test sets results
in inflated human evaluation scores for MT
systems; (ii) in some cases system rankings
do change and (iii) the impact translationese
has on a translation direction is inversely cor-
related to the translation quality attainable by
state-of-the-art MT systems for that direction.

1 Introduction

Translated texts in a human language exhibit
unique characteristics that set them apart from
texts originally written in that language. It is
common then to refer to translated texts with the
term translationese. The characteristics of trans-
lationese can be grouped along the so-called uni-
versal features of translation or translation univer-
sals (Baker, 1993), namely simplification, normal-
isation and explicitation. In addition to these three,
interference is recognised as a fundamental law of
translation (Toury, 2012): “phenomena pertaining
to the make-up of the source text tend to be trans-
ferred to the target text”. In a nutshell, compared
to original texts, translations tend to be simpler,
more standardised, and more explicit and they re-
tain some characteristics that pertain to the source
language.

The effect of translationese has been studied in
machine translation (MT), mainly with respect to
the training data, during the last decade. Previous
work has found that an MT system performs better
when trained on parallel data whose source side
is original and whose target side is translationese,

rather than the opposite (Kurokawa et al., 2009;
Lembersky, 2013).

A recent paper has studied the effect of transla-
tionese on test sets (Toral et al., 2018), in the con-
text of assessing the claim of human parity made
on Chinese-to-English WMT’s 2017 test set (Has-
san et al., 2018). The source side of this test set,
as it is common in WMT (Bojar et al., 2016, 2017,
2018), was half original and half translationese. It
was found out that the translationese part was ar-
tificially easier to translate, which resulted in in-
flated scores for MT systems.

Noting that this finding was based on one test
set for a single translation direction, we explore
this topic in more depth, studying the effect of
translationese in all the language pairs of the news
shared task of WMT 2016 to 2018. Our research
questions (RQs) are the following:

• RQ1. Does the use of translationese in the
source side of MT test sets unfairly favour
MT systems in general or is this just an ar-
tifact of the Chinese-to-English test set from
WMT 2017?

• RQ2. If the answer to RQ1 is yes, does
this effect of translationese have an impact
on WMT’s system rankings? In other words,
would removing the part of the test set whose
source side is translationese result in any
change in the rankings?

• RQ3. If the answer to RQ1 is yes, would
some language pairs be more affected than
others? E.g. based on the level of the related-
ness between the two languages involved.

The remainder of the paper will be organized as
follows. Section 2 provides an overview of pre-
vious work about the effect of translationese in
MT. Next, Section 3 describes the data sets used in



74

our research. This is followed by Section 4, Sec-
tion 5 and Section 6, where we conduct the exper-
iments for RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3, respectively. Fi-
nally, Section 7 outlines our conclusions and lines
of future work.

2 Related Work

There is previous research in the field of MT that
has looked at the impact of translationese, mostly
on training data, but there are works that have fo-
cused also on tuning and testing data sets.

The pioneering work on this topic by Kurokawa
et al. (2009) showed that French-to-English sta-
tistical MT systems trained on human translations
from French to English (original source and trans-
lationese target, henceforth referred to as O→T)
outperformed systems trained on human transla-
tions in the opposite direction (i.e. translationese
source and original target, henceforth referred
to as T→O). These findings were corroborated
by Lembersky (2013), who also adapted phrase
tables to translationese, which resulted in further
improvements. Lembersky et al. (2012) focused
on the monolingual data used to train the language
model of a statistical MT system and found that
using translated texts led to better translation qual-
ity than relying on original texts.

Stymne (2017) investigated the effect of trans-
lationese on tuning for statistical MT, using data
from the WMT 2008–2013 (Bojar et al., 2013) for
three language pairs. The results using O→T and
T→O tuning texts were compared; the former led
to a better length ratio and a better translation, in
terms of automatic evaluation metrics.

Finally, Toral et al. (2018) investigated the ef-
fect of translationese on the Chinese→English
(ZH→EN) test set from WMT’s 2017 news shared
task. They hypothesized that the sentences orig-
inally written in EN are easier to translate than
those originally written in ZH, due to the sim-
plification principle of translationese, namely that
translated sentences tend to be simpler than their
original counterparts (Laviosa-Braithwaite, 1998).
Two additional universal principles of translation,
explicitation and normalisation, would also indi-
cate that a ZH text originally written in EN would
be easier to translate. In fact, they looked at a hu-
man translation and the translation by an MT sys-
tem (Hassan et al., 2018) and observed that the hu-
man translation outperforms the MT system when
the input text is written in the original language

(ZH), but the difference between the two is not
significant when the original language is transla-
tionese (ZH input originally written EN). There-
fore, they concluded that the use of translationese
as the source language in test sets distorts the re-
sults in favour of MT systems.

3 Data Sets

We use the test data from WMT16, WMT17, and
WMT18 news translation tasks (newstest2016,
newstest2017, and newstest2018) exclusively, be-
cause they provide results using the direct as-
sessment (DA) score (Graham et al., 2013, 2014,
2017), which is the metric we will use in our ex-
periments. DA is a crowd-sourced human eval-
uation metric to determine MT quality. To elab-
orate, after participants submit their translations
produced by their MT systems, a human evalua-
tion campaign is run. This is to assess the trans-
lation quality of the systems, and to rank them
accordingly. Human evaluation scores are pro-
vided via crowdsourcing and/or by participants,
using Appraise (Federmann, 2012). Human asses-
sors are asked to rate a given candidate translation
by how adequately it expresses the meaning of the
corresponding reference translation, thus avoiding
the use of the source texts and therefore not requir-
ing bilingual speakers. The rating is done on an
analogue scale, which corresponds to an absolute
0-100 scale.

To prevent differences in scoring strategies of
distinct human assessors, the human assessment
scores for translations are standardized according
to each individual human assessor’s overall mean
and standard deviation score, which is indicated as
the z-score in WMT finding papers. Average stan-
dardized scores for individual segments belonging
to a given system are then computed, before the
final overall DA score for that system is computed
as the average of its standardized segment scores.

Finally, systems are ranked to produce the
shared task results. There is of course the pos-
sibility that some systems score similarly in the
shared task. If that is the case, those systems are
clustered together. Specifically, clusters are deter-
mined by grouping systems together, and compar-
ing the scores they obtained. According to the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, if systems do not sig-
nificantly outperform others, they are in the same
cluster, the opposite is the case if they do outper-
form each other (Bojar et al., 2016, 2017, 2018).

4 Effect of Translationese on Direct
Assessment Scores

The test sets used by Bojar et al. (2016, 2017,
2018) are bilingual, thus having two sides: source
text and reference translation. The source is writ-
ten in the language that is to be translated from
(original language), while the reference is written
in the language into which the source text is to
be translated (target language). In all the test sets
used in our experiments English is one of the two
languages involved, being either the source or the
target.

Taking as an example of WMT test set the
one for Chinese-to-English from 2017, this con-
tains 2,001 sentence pairs. Out of these, 1,000
sentences were originally written in Chinese and
translated by a human translator into English,
hence the target text is translationese. The other
half consists of 1,001 sentences that were origi-
nally written in English and translated by a human
translator into Chinese, hence the source text is
translationese in this subset. A graphical depic-
tion of this can be found in Figure 1. The advan-

tage of this procedure is that the same test set can
be used for the English-to-Chinese direction, thus
reducing the costs involved in creating test sets in
half.

ten in the source language (referred to as ORG in

whole test set (WMT) as starting point for the
comparison. We observe a clear and common
trend: using original input results in a lower DA
score, while using translationese input increases
the DA score. This trend is consistent for all the
17 translation directions considered and for all the
3 years of WMT studied, thus providing enough
evidence to answer RQ1: the use of translationese
as input of test sets results in higher DA scores for
MT systems.

5 Effect of Translationese on Rankings

We compute Kendall’s τ to give an overview of to
what degree rankings change for each translation
direction. The τ coefficient is obtained by com-
paring WMT rankings to the resulting rankings if
only the ORG subset is used as input. Since sys-
tems can share the same cluster, and thus the same
ranking, we compute Kendall’s τ both with and
without ties. With ties, all systems in the same
cluster are considered to occupy the same rank,
hence the correlation with ties is sensitive only to
changes that go beyond clusters. E.g. if a system
moves from the second cluster to the first one. In
contrast, without ties all the ranking changes are
considered, even if a system changes position but
remains within the same cluster.

Table 3 shows the Kendall’s τ correlations for
all translation directions between the rankings on
the whole test set (WMT) and on the ORG sub-
set. We do see that some of the translation di-
rections have a τ coefficient of 1, which means
that the agreement between the two rankings is
perfect, i.e. the rankings in WMT and ORG are
exactly the same. However, we observe that there
were few systems submitted to such translation di-
rections (e.g. τ = 1 for Romanian→English in
2017, for which 7 systems were submitted, see Ta-
ble 1). Apart from those, other language directions
show that there are at least slight rank changes
between the WMT rankings and ORG rankings.
Looking at the low ranked translation directions,
we observe that some are close to a τ coefficient
of 0, especially in correlations without ties, such
as German→English in WMT 2017 (τ = 0.345).
This means that some rankings have only a weak
correlation.

Probably related to the differences in DA scores
between WMT and ORG (RQ1), we also find that
systems’ rankings change for most language pairs
when comparing WMT and ORG rankings. We
see that there is no perfect correlation between
rankings, apart from a few language directions for
which only a few systems were submitted. This

indicates that the rankings do change to a cer-
tain degree. Computing Kendall’s τ with ties re-
sults in higher correlation coefficients than with-
out ties, implying that systems do shift, but tend
to stay in the same cluster they occupied in the
WMT ranking. In some editions of WMT, the
rankings for certain language pairs change con-
siderably. The biggest change in terms of rank-
ing takes place for PROMT’s rule-based system
RU→EN for WMT16. This system advances four
positions in the ranking when only original source
text is considered, going from rank 5 to rank 1 (al-
though tied with several other systems). It is worth
noting that while the DA score for the majority of
systems decreases when using original source text,
the opposite happens for PROMT’s system.

Thus far we have looked at a single result per
translation direction and year, based on the best
system in Table 2, and on the correlation between
systems in Table 3. Now we zoom in on a transla-
tion direction: Chinese→English. Table 4 shows
how DA scores change between the whole test
set (WMT) and the subsets ORG and TRS, both
in terms of raw and standarized scores. In addi-
tion, the table depicts how many positions a sys-
tem goes up or down in the ranking.

In the table we observe consistently that the DA
score for ORG input is lower than that for WMT,
while that for TRS is higher than that for WMT.
It is also worth noting that most top scoring sys-
tems change in rankings, and that system clusters
shift. Due to limited space we provide equivalent
tables to Table 4 for the remaining 16 translation
directions as an appendix.

6 Effect of Translationese on Different
Language Pairs

We aim to find out not only whether translationese
has an effect on test sets (RQ1 and RQ2), but also
to study whether some language pairs are more
affected than others (RQ3). Two hypotheses in
this regard are as follows: (i) the degree of trans-
lationese’s impact has to do with the translation
quality attainable for a translation direction, as
represented by the DA score of the best MT sys-
tem submitted; (ii) the degree of translationese’s
impact has to do with how related are the two lan-
guages involved.

In order to test the second hypothesis, the de-
gree of similarity between languages has to be
quantified. We make use of the lang2vec tool (Lit-

tell et al., 2017) using the URIEL Typological
Database (Littell et al., 2016) to compute the sim-
ilarity between pairs of languages. Similar to the
approach of Berzak et al. (2017), all the 103 avail-
able morphosyntactic features in URIEL are ob-
tained; these are derived from the World Atlas of
Language Structures (WALS) (Dryer and Haspel-
math, 2013), Syntactic Structures of the Worlds
Languages (SSWL) (Collins and Kayne, 2009)
and Ethnologue (Lewis et al., 2009). Missing
feature values are filled with a prediction from
a k-nearest neighbors classifier. We also ex-
tract URIEL’s 3,718 language family features de-
rived from Glottolog (Hammarström et al., 2019).
Each of these features represents membership in a
branch of Glottolog’s world language tree. Trun-
cating features with the same value for all the lan-
guages present in our study, 87 features remain,
consisting of 60 syntactic features and 27 family
tree features. We then measure the level of relat-
edness between two languages using the linguis-
tic similarity (LS) by Berzak et al. (2017) (Equa-
tion 1), i.e. the cosine similarity between the
URIEL feature vectors for two languages vy and
v′y.

LSy,y′ =
vy · vy′
‖vy‖

∥∥vy′∥∥ (1)
Together with the LS for a language direction,

we take the best system of the most recent year
in our data set, WMT18, for that language direc-
tion. The motivation behind is that a top perform-
ing system from the most recent campaign should
be representative of the current state-of-the-art in
machine translation for the translation direction it
was submitted to.

To look into the effect of translationese across
different language pairs, we present two ap-
proaches, following the hypotheses put forward at
the beginning of this section: (i) compare the DA
score of the best system for each translation direc-
tion on subset ORG to the relative or absolute dif-
ference in DA score for that system between sub-
set ORG and the whole set (WMT); (ii) compare
the LS of the two languages in each translation di-
rection to the relative or absolute difference in DA
scores for the best system between subset ORG
and the whole set (WMT);

Figure 2 shows the Pearson correlation and 95%
confidence region of the DA score of the best scor-
ing system for each language direction on subset
ORG against the absolute and relative difference

LS vs. absolute difference

Figure 3: Pearson correlation between Linguistic Similarity for each language direction and the relative (left)
and absolute (right) difference (%) in DA score of comparing WMT input and ORG input. The languages are

of the DA scores of those systems between WMT
input and ORG input. We observe an interesting
trend; higher scoring systems tend to have lower
differences in score, which indicates that trans-
lationese has less effect. Considering either rel-
ative or absolute differences, the correlations are
in both cases significant and strong (p < 0.001,
|R| > 0.75).

Figure 3 shows the Pearson correlation and 95%

confidence region of the LS of a language pair
(English compared to another language in our data
sets) against the absolute and relative difference of
the DA scores of the best system for each trans-
lation direction between WMT input and ORG
input. Here, we see a less obvious trend, and
in fact both correlations are very weak and non-
significant. However, just as in the previous figure
we can see that most of the out-of-English systems



80

tend to have a higher relative and absolute differ-
ence than systems that translate into English.

On a side note, we created different feature
combinations from the earlier mentioned features
for LS. Apart from syntactic and family tree fea-
tures, phonological features are also present in
URIEL. However, other combinations did not
seem to alter the LS difference score, compared to
using the mentioned features in the experimental
setup.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper has looked in depth at the effect of
translationese in bidirectional test sets, commonly
used in machine translation shared tasks, by con-
ducting a series of experiments on data sets for
17 translation directions in the three last edi-
tions of the news shared task from WMT. Specif-
ically, we have recomputed the direct assess-
ment (DA) scores separately for the whole test
set (WMT), and for the subsets whose source
side contains original language (ORG) and trans-
lationese (TRS). Results show that using origi-
nal language input lowers the DA scores, and
translationese input increases the scores (RQ1),
and perhaps more importantly, system rankings
do change (RQ2). We have also investigated the
degree to which these rankings change, by mea-
suring the correlation between the rankings with
a non-parametric correlation metric that supports
ties (Kendall’s τ ). Results show that systems do
change in absolute ranking, but tend to stay more
in the same cluster as they were before.

Last, we looked at whether the effect of trans-
lationese correlates with certain characteristics of
translation directions. We did not find a correla-
tion between the effect of translationese and the
level of relatedness of the two languages involved
but we did find a correlation between the effect
of translationese and the translation quality attain-
able for translation directions (RQ3). In other
words, human evaluation for better performing
systems would seem to be less affected by trans-
lationese. Related, we observe that translation di-
rections that contain an under-resourced language
tend to obtain low DA scores. Hence, we could
say that the effect of translationese tends to be
high specially when an under-resourced language
is present, which could distort (inflate) the expec-
tations in terms of translation quality for these lan-
guages.

As for future work, we plan to focus on studying
what the characteristics of translationese are. I.e.
what are the traits that set apart the language used
in original test sets from translationese test sets.

All the code and data used in our experiments
are available on GitHub1.
