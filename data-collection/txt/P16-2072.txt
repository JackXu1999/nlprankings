Abstract

Using corpus data of spoken dialogue,
we examine the convergence of syntactic
complexity levels between interlocutors in
natural conversations, as it occurs within
spans of topic episodes. The findings of
general convergence in the Switchboard
and BNC corpora are compatible with an
information-theoretic model of dialogue
and with Interactive Alignment Theory.

1 Introduction

According to Interactive Alignment theory (Pick-
ering and Garrod, 2004), mutual understanding
in dialogue is helped by a variety of intercon-
nected adaptation processes. Over the course of a
conversation, interlocutors’ linguistic productions
assimilate at multiple levels, such as phonemes
(Pardo, 2006), lexical choice (Garrod and An-
derson, 1987), syntactic structures (Pickering and
Branigan, 1998; Branigan et al., 2000; Reitter
et al., 2006) and so on. The alignment at these
levels contributes to the establishment of aligned
situation models between speakers, which is the
ultimate goal of a successful conversation (Pick-
ering and Garrod, 2004; Reitter and Moore, 2007,
2014).

Alignment does not only refer to the mimicking
and repetition of particular linguistic structures;
it also includes the convergence at the statistical
and ensemble level, which is known as distribu-
tional matching (Abney et al., 2014). Speech rates
(Webb, 1969), probability distributions over syn-
tactic forms (Jaeger and Snider, 2008), power law
distributions of acoustic onset events (Abney et al.,
2014), and social intent of the speech act (Wang
et al., 2015) were all found to match between in-
terlocutors.

An aspect of accommodation that presumably
very much helps dialogue partners understand
each other’s language is syntactic complexity. De-
spite rich investigation of alignment in conversa-
tion, this property has been largely overlooked in
the analysis of dialogue.

The general concept of syntactic complexity
has, of course, been addressed in various ways. In
educational psychology and applied linguistics, it
is often defined as the degree of sophistication of
language forms. It has broad application in the
assessment of second language acquisition (Or-
tega, 2003; Lu, 2010, 2011), the readability test
(MacGinitie and Tretiak, 1971), and elementary
education (Abedi and Lord, 2001). In computa-
tional linguistics, previous studies have shown that
the syntactic complexity of a sentence is closely
related to the amount of information being trans-
mitted (Genzel and Charniak, 2002, 2003; Jaeger
and Levy, 2006; Jaeger, 2010). However, as far
as we know, syntactic complexity as a high level
feature of language production has not been inves-
tigated under the theoretical lens of the Interactive
Alignment Model (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).

Therefore, the focus of this study is to track the
syntactic complexity of different interlocutors as
the conversation develops. A convergence of sen-
tence complexity between interlocutors would be
compatible with two pertinent theories. The first
is the Interactive Alignment Model. The second
is the Uniform Information Density hypothesis
(Jaeger and Levy, 2006; Jaeger, 2010), as it applies
to syntactic structure. It postulates that speakers
will strive to keep information density approxi-
mately constant. In other words, if one interlocu-
tor decreased their rate of information transmis-
sion, the other one would increase it in response.
As far as syntactic complexity is proportional to
the amount of information, this would imply that if
one interlocutor changes their syntactic complex-

posite change.

2 Methods

2.1 Corpus data
We use the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al.,
1992) and the British National Corpus (BNC)
(BNC, 2007) in this study. Switchboard contains
1126 conversations over the telephone, where each
conversation features exactly two native American
English speakers. From the BNC, we use only a
subset of the data that contains spoken conversa-
tions with exactly two participants so that the dia-
logue structures are consistent with Switchboard.

2.2 Metrics of syntactic complexity
We consider three candidate statistics to measure
the syntactic complexity of a sentence: sentence
length (number of words in a sentence), tree depth,
and branching factor. The first two are straight-
forward: syntactically complex sentences are typ-
ically used to express complex meanings, and thus
are more likely to contain more words than simple
ones. More complex syntactic structures, such as
relative clauses and noun clauses, also have deeper
parse trees (see Figure 1).

The third statistic, branching factor, is defined
as the average number of children of all non-leaf
nodes in the parse tree of a sentence. In contrast

to tree depth, it measures the width of a tree struc-
ture, thus a sentence with a larger branching factor
looks flatter.

These three statistics are inter-correlated. For
instance, tree depth has an almost linear corre-
lation with sentence length. To come up with a
measure that solely characterizes the complexity
of a sentence in terms of its tree structure, we nor-
malize tree depth and branching factor by exclud-
ing the effect of sentence length. We adopt the
method proposed by Genzel and Charniak (2002).
Let f be a complexity measure of a sentence (tree
depth or branching factor). We compute the aver-
age measure f̄(n) for sentences of the same length
n (n = 1, 2, . . . ):

f̄(n) = 1/|S(n)|
∑

s∈S(n) f(s) (1)

where s denotes a sentence, and S(n) =
{s|l(s) = n} is the set of sentences of length n.
The normalized complexity measure is:

f ′(s) =
f(s)
f̄(n)

(2)

This normalized measure f ′ is not sensitive to
sentence length. This gives us five metrics of com-
plexity: sentence length (SL), tree depth (TD),
branching factor (BF), normalized tree depth
(NTD), and normalized branching factor (NBF).

2.3 Topic segmentation and speaker role
assignment

To verify the hypothesized convergence of a cer-
tain statistic between two speakers in dialogue,
one possible method is to measure whether the
difference in that statistic becomes smaller as the
conversation progresses. However, this design is
overly simplistic in this case for several reasons.
For instance, previous studies have found that sen-
tence complexity in written text increases with its
position (Genzel and Charniak, 2003); thus even if
we observed that the difference of complexity be-
comes smaller, a ceiling effect could be a simpler
explanation.

Additionally, the syntactic complexity of a sen-
tence largely depends on the amount of meaning
that is conveyed. Intuitively, when a speaker has a
large amount of information to express, she tends
to use more sophisticated syntactic constructions
Linking this consideration to another very com-
mon scenario in dialogue: one interlocutor leads
the conversation by steering the on-going topics,

while the other participant follows along. Here,
we are not talking about the turn-taking mech-
anism in dialogue, which describes the shift at
the utterance level. Rather, we are describing the
shift at a higher level in conversation, the topic
level, which is formally referred to as topic shift
in Conversation Analysis (Ng and Bradac, 1993;
Linell, 1998). According to these related theories,
a complete conversation consists of several topic
episodes. Some speakers play a more active role
in leading the unfolding of new topic episodes,
while others play a more passive role by follow-
ing the topic shift. Beginning a new topic means
bringing in new information, thus it is reasonable
to infer that the interlocutor’s syntactic complex-
ity would partially depend on whether he is play-
ing the leader or the follower. Considering the
fact that the leader vs. follower roles are not fixed
among interlocutors (a previous leader could be a
follower later and vise versa), we should not exam-
ine the convergence of syntactic complexity within
the whole conversation. Rather, we want to zoom
in to the finer scale of topic episodes, in which the
interlocutors’ roles are relatively stable.

Based on these considerations, we use the Text-
Tiling algorithm (Hearst, 1997) to segment the
conversation into several topic episodes. This is
a sufficient topic segmentation method for our re-
search questions, though it is less sophisticated
compared to Bayesian models (Eisenstein and
Barzilay, 2008) or Hidden Markov Models (Blei
and Moreno, 2001).

Within each topic episode that resulted from the

segmentation operation, we assign roles to the two
speakers. This is based on which of the interlocu-
tors is leading this topic episode, as previously ex-
plained. We use two rules to determine this leader
and follower differentiation:

Rule I: If the topic episode starts in the middle
of the speaking turn of speaker A, then let A be the
leader of this topic.

Rule II: If the topic episode starts with a com-
plete speaking turn, then let the first speaker who
contributes a sentence greater than N words in
length in this episode be the leader.

Note that the purpose of Rule II is to select the
most probable topic leader, based on the intuition
that longer sentences are more likely to initiate a
new topic. Thus the determination of the N words
threshold here is totally empirical. We use N =
5 as the final threshold, because for N ≥ 5 our
experiments draw similar results.

3 Results

For each sentence in conversation, we compute
the five earlier-discussed metrics of syntactic com-
plexity: SL, TD, BF, NTD, and NBF.

For the first three metrics, SL, TD and BF,
we observe convergence between topic leaders
and followers, for both corpora (Fig. 2). Basi-
cally, topic leaders have higher syntactic complex-
ity measures at the early stage of a topic episode,
which drops gradually as the topic develops. The
converse holds for topic followers. We fit 12 linear

mixed models (3 metrics × 2 roles × 2 corpora)
using metrics as the respective response variables,
the within-topic position as a fixed effect, and a
random intercept grouped by individual speakers.
We find a positive effect of within-topic position
for leaders, and a reliably negative effect for fol-
lowers (except SL of BNC follower), which con-
firms the observation of convergence trend (See
Table 1).

For NTD and NBF, we observe convergence
patterns in Switchboard, but not reliably in BNC
(Figure 3). Linear mixed models are fit in sim-
ilar ways, and the β coefficients are: for NTD,
βleader = −2.2× 10−5, βfollower = 9.7× 10−4∗∗∗;
for NBF, βleader = 6.8× 10−5∗, βfollower =
−2.9× 10−4∗∗∗ (*** indicates p < 0.001, and *
indicates p < 0.05). Thus, a general trend seems
supported. As NBF is the only metric that is lower
in leaders and higher in followers, it could actually
be an index for syntactic simplicity.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

By segmenting a conversation into several topic
episodes, and then differentiating the interlocutors
in terms of their roles in initiating the topic, leader
or follower, we show that the syntactic complex-
ity of the two interlocutors converges within topic
episodes. The syntactic complexity of the topic
leader decreases, while the complexity of the topic
follower increases.

From an information-theoretical point of view,
the syntactic complexity of a sentence is closely
related to its amount of lexical information or neg-
ative entropy (Genzel and Charniak, 2002, 2003).
By starting a new topic in conversation, the lead-
ing speaker brings novelty to the existing con-
text, which often involves relatively long and com-
plex utterances. On the other hand, the follow-
ing speaker has to accommodate this change of
context, by first producing short acknowledging
phrases at the early stage, and gradually increase

446



his contribution as the topic develops. Therefore,
the convergence of syntactic complexity within
a topic episode is a reflection of the process in
which two interlocutors contribute jointly to build
up common ground (Clark and Brennan, 1991)
with respect to a certain topic.

We find our results explained the theoretical
frameworks of common ground (Clark, 1996) and
the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM, Picker-
ing and Garrod, 2004), models which are some-
times characterized as opposing accounts of coor-
dination in dialogue. From the common-ground
perspective of language-as-activity, interlocutors
play different roles in dialogue, and the coordi-
nation between these roles facilitates the success-
ful unfolding of dialogue. Our account identifies
two such macro-level roles: topic leader vs. fol-
lower. From the perspective of Interactive Align-
ment, interactions between interlocutors in a di-
alogue are accompanied by the alignment of lin-
guistic elements at multiple levels, including syn-
tactic rules. Thus, the micro-level convergence
of syntactic complexity is predicted by the IAM.
Therefore, our findings point to the possibility of
a unified perspective that combines the two theo-
ries.

It is worth pointing out that we present some
novel ideas about the scope of convergence. Ex-
isting studies focus on the alignment effect that is
observable throughout the whole conversation. In
our case, the convergence of syntactic complexity
occurs within smaller scope: the topic episodes.
Note that the direction of convergence is dynamic:
a speaker of higher complexity in one episode
might be of lower complexity in the next episode,
depending on her role. The next questions aris-
ing from these patterns mirror those asked of other
types of alignment: is complexity alignment pur-
poseful, is it controlled by individual differences
or situational goals, and can it predict task suc-
cess? We leave these questions for future work.
