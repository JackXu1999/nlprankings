ABSTRACT
Various experiments from literature suggest that in statistical machine translation (SMT),
applying either pre-processing or post-processing to morphologically rich languages leads to
better translation quality. In this work, we focus on the English-Tamil language pair. We
implement suffix-separation rules for both of the languages and evaluate the impact of this
preprocessing on translation quality of the phrase-based as well as hierarchical model in terms
of BLEU score and a small manual evaluation. The results confirm that our simple suffix-based
morphological processing helps to obtain better translation performance. A by-product of our
efforts is a new parallel corpus of 190k sentence pairs gathered from the web.

KEYWORDS: English-Tamil Machine Translation, Parallel Corpora, Suffix Separation.

1 Introduction

For any language pair, there are two main things that affect the performance of an SMT system:
(i) the amount of parallel data and (ii) the language differences, mainly the morphological
richness and word order differences due to syntactic divergence (Koehn et al., 2009). Indian
languages (IL) in general seriously suffer both of the problems especially when they are being
translated from/into English. There are very little parallel data for English and Indian languages,
and English differs from IL (e.g. Tamil) in both word order (English: SVO, Tamil: SOV) as well
as in morphological complexity (English: fusional, Tamil: agglutinative). While the syntactic
differences contribute to the difficulties for translation models, the morphological differences
contribute to data sparsity. We attempt to address both issues in this paper.

In Section 3, we propose morphological processing aimed at reducing data sparsity. In Section
4, we describe our English-Tamil parallel corpora collection and the system configurations we
use. In Section 5, we report the results and analyze them in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Research into SMT involving Tamil language is not very common, the main reason perhaps being
the lack of parallel corpora. Nevertheless there have been efforts for other Indian languages
such as Hindi (Udupa U. and Faruquie, 2004), (Ramanathan et al., 2008) and (Bojar et al.,
2008). The earliest work that appeared on English-Tamil SMT was (Germann, 2001) which
described building a small English-Tamil parallel corpus as well as an SMT system. So far,
the efforts for building English-Tamil parallel corpora are moderate and the readily available
parallel data amount just to a few thousand sentences. One of our goals in this work is to
perform experiments with a larger corpus that we collect on our own (see Section 4.1) from
various web sources.

The main focus of this work is to address morphological differences between English and
Tamil propose steps that improve the performance of SMT systems. Applying morphological
processing to SMT is not new, the idea goes back to (Lee, 2004) for Arabic-English or (Nießen
and Ney, 2004) for German-English. (Ramanathan et al., 2008) and (Ramanathan et al., 2009)
are the first to experiment an Indian language, namely in English-Hindi translation. We apply
similar techniques to English-Tamil pair.

3 Suffix Splitting

English and Tamil morphologies follow different inflectional patterns. While English morphology
can be adequately described with a few morphological suffixes, thousands of wordforms can
be built from a single root in Tamil. As expected, verbs and nouns are the main productive
parts of speech in Tamil. For example, a Tamil verb, in addition to the root bearing the lexical
information, can include suffixes corresponding to person, number, gender, tense, negativity,
aspect and mood. Most of the additional information which a Tamil word contains can be mapped
to individual functional words (including prepositions) in English. One type of coordination
deserves a special treatment because Tamil uses suffixes instead of coordination conjunctions:
‘Xum Yum’ in Tamil corresponds to ‘X and Y’ in English.

Our hypothesis is that separating morphological suffixes from the root and treating them as
separate tokens can yield better BLEU performance. We experiment with splitting morphological
suffixes on either or both English and Tamil.

114

3.1 Rules

For suffix separation, we identify a number of linguistic rules for both Tamil and English. Each
linguistic rule has a form of a regular expression in our system and operates on the wordform.
The rules for Tamil operate based on solely the word endings whereas the rules for English also
make use of the parts of speech (POS). For Tamil, we have identified 716 inflectional rules for
nouns and 519 rules for verbs. Since the number of the rules for Tamil is large, we use three
strategies to avoid repeated or often spurious splitting on a wordform: (i) a rule for separating
a large suffix (in the number of characters) takes precedence over a rule for a smaller suffix
(ii) at most one rule is applied to any wordform and (iii) no rule is applied for wordforms of
less than 5 characters after transliteration. At present, our Tamil suffix splitter only works with
transliterated data. So, the Tamil side of the parallel corpus must be transliterated from UTF-8
encoding to Latin. Once the suffix splitting is done, the corpus is transliterated back to UTF-8.

3.2 Suffix Splitting: Tamil

Only verbs and nouns are the major parts of speech (Lehmann, 1989) in Tamil that undergo
various morphological processes. Although Tamil is an agglutinative language (i.e. suffixes
bringing separate morphological features are concatenated one after another), instead of
splitting each morpheme into a separate token, we split only suffixes that are often a functional
word or a separate token in English. This approach avoids too much spurious splitting.

Tamil nouns mainly inflect for various case markers which mostly correspond to individual
functional words in English. For example, ‘palkalaikkazakaTTil’ (in the university) where the
locative case marker ‘TTil’ corresponds to the preposition ‘in’ in English. In the same way, the
verb suffixes are separated from the inflected verb.

The left part of Figure 1 shows various case inflections for the Tamil noun ‘maram’ (‘tree’). After
the suffix splitting, all the case markers will be separated from the root. Note that the Tamil
noun ‘maram’ (‘tree’) is not preserved in full in the declension. Instead, only the stem ‘mara’ is
recovered. The right part of Figure 1 shows some of the conjugations of verb ‘pati’ (‘to study’).

115



For example: the gloss ‘he who studies’ tries to mimic a relative construct which is represented
as one word in Tamil. The pronominal information in ‘patikkiRavan’ (‘he who studies’) indicates
that the word refers to a masculine antecedent while the verbal part ‘patikkiRavan’ adds the
new information: that the person is studying. Syntactically, the word ‘patikkiRavan’ behaves as
a noun. After our suffix splitting, the verbal part will be separated from the nominal part.

Apart from major inflectional paradigms, we also implemented rules handling nouns + postposi-
tions and sandhis. It is very common in Tamil to concatenate postpositions to the preceding nouns.
But in the English translation, they correspond to separate prepositions or other functional
words. For example in ‘uLwOkkamillAmal’ (‘without an ulterior motive’), the suffix ‘illAmal’
will be separated from the original wordform to better match with the English translation. So
far 70 rules have been identified to split such combinations of nouns + postpositions.

One more phenomenon is the external sandhi, i.e. the situation when a stop consonant (k,c, T, p
in Tamil) is added to the end of a word if the following word starts with a stop consonant. For
example: in ‘aTaik kotukka’ (‘to give that’), ‘aTaic ceyya’ (‘to do that’), ‘aTaiT Tota’ (‘to touch
that’) and ‘aTaip patikka’ (‘to read that’), the English word ‘that’ is mapped to four different
forms in Tamil each differing by the last character. To avoid this data sparsity issue, we add a
simple rule that separates this external sandhi from Tamil wordforms.

3.3 Suffix Splitting: English

Although the English morphology is not as complex as Tamil, we perform a similar rule-based
suffix splitting for English. In English, we proceed in two steps: (i) tag the corpus using Stanford
tagger (ii) and apply suffix splitting rules on the tagged data. This process allows us to perform
suffix splitting only for certain word ending - tag combinations, thus avoiding spurious splitting.
Our suffix splitting for English uses 34 tag-suffix rules. The rule has the format ‘tag (T) - suffix
(S)’, which means that we will separate the suffix (S) from any wordform that has the tag (T).

Figure 2: Suffix separation in participial nouns

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate suffix separation for both Tamil and English. The alignment links
shown in the figures are not automatically aligned but actual translation links to demonstrate
the possibility of better alignment (thanks to the reduced sparsity) after the suffix separation.
Figure 2 shows how a participial noun ‘mannippavan’ (‘one who forgives’) can be splitted so
that many to one alignment is reduced. Figure 3 illustrates how the separated negative suffix
‘Ata’ and the postposition ‘il’ correspond directly to individual words in English.

4 Experimental Setup

4.1 Data

(Germann, 2001) built a small English-Tamil parallel corpus (around 5000 sentences in total) by
hiring translators. A focused effort to build a parallel corpus for English and Indian languages
including Tamil was initiated by the EILMT1 consortium project. This attempt too was a manual
effort and the parallel corpora were constructed for the health and tourism domain. Recently,
(Post et al., 2012) released manually constructed parallel corpora for six Indian languages by
crowd-sourced translation.

We feel that there is a decent amount of parallel English-Tamil data available in the web that
are largely unnoticed and we thus collect our own corpus quickly and at no cost for translation.

We mainly collect parallel corpora from three sources: (i) www.wsws.org (News - news website)
(ii) www.cinesouth.com (Cinema - Tamil cinema articles) and (iii) biblephone.intercer.net
(Bible). The above three sources are either multilingual or contain exclusive English and Tamil
contents. To collect the News corpus, we downloaded only URLs that have matching file names
on both English and Tamil sides. The collection of Cinema corpus was simple: all the English
articles had a link to the corresponding Tamil translation on the same page. The collection of
Bible corpus followed a similar pattern.

After downloading the English URLs and the corresponding Tamil URLs, we stripped all the
HTML tags. At this stage, the Bible corpus was already sentence aligned. The News and Cinema
articles had similar paragraph structures but they were not sentence aligned. We used hunalign
(Varga et al.) to sentence align them.

Table 1 summarizes the data sizes. Apart from the development set (1000 sentences), we
partition the remaining data into the training portion (90%) and testing portion (10%). The
table also includes the statistics of word tokens of both English and Tamil corpora. The corpus
All combines everything into one big corpus. The Tamil side is encoded in UTF-8.

The domain difference between the corpora is reflected in the average sentence length (English,
before suffix separation) of 15 for the Cinema compared to 26 and 25 for News and Bible,
respectively. The corpora also vary in terms of language style: the style in Bible is very
different from that of News and Cinema.

4.2 Systems Used

We use phrase-based and hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) MT systems as implemented by Koehn
et al. (2007) for our experiments. We use the default system settings for all experiments and
report results for individual datasets as well as for the entire training data, All.

4.3 Examined Configurations

Our experiments consist of the following settings for both phrase based and hierarchical systems:

• baseline: The default, no suffix splitting.
• targetmor : No change in English side of the data. Our suffix splitter is run on Tamil.
• source+targetmor : Both the English and Tamil suffix splitters are run on the respective

sides of the data.

For each settings, we report BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores in three variations: BLEUsu f f _sep,
BLEUsu f f _re j and BLEUstem_onl y .

In the case of BLEUsu f f _sep evaluation, both the reference and hypothesis translations are suffix-
separated before the evaluation, allowing a better match with the reference but also risking
more false positives. The BLEUsu f f _re j evaluation corresponds to what Tamil readers would
like to see: the suffixes are rejoined (if they were separated) prior to evaluation. BLEUstem_onl y
ignores suffixes altogether, both hypothesis and reference translations contain only stem words.

Manual sentence level ranking: We use the WMT-style manual ranking technique (Callison-
Burch et al., 2010; Bojar et al., 2011) for a sample of 100 sentences from the test set of ‘All’
translated by each of the examined configurations. Without knowing which is which, we rank
hypotheses from best to worst for each sentence, allowing ties. The overall score for each system
is calculated by considering all pairwise comparisons implied by the rankings. We report three
flavours: (i) how often the system was ranked better or equal than other systems (‘≥ others’
= wins+t ies

wins+losses+t ies
), (ii) not favoring ties (‘> others’ = wins

wins+t ies+losses
) and (iii) ignoring ties

altogether (‘no ties’ = wins
wins+losses

).

5 Results

The results for phrase-based and hierarchical MT systems are given in Tables 2 and 3, respec-
tively. Comparing baseline scores for both the phrase-based and the hierarchical systems, the

hierarchical system performs better or equally well across all the corpora.

Table 3: Results for hierarchical SMT

Evaluating suffixes separately (BLEUsu f f _sep), we see big jumps in the scores when the target or
both sides of the training data were splitted. Note that for BLEUsu f f _sep, the baseline system
output is subjected to suffix splitting, but only after the translation. In the baseline of both
Table 2 and 3, the BLEU score sharply increases for Bible than the News and Cinema when
we compare BLEUsu f f _sep and BLEUsu f f _re j . One reason could be, the increase in the number
of tokens (in the reference data) after the suffix separation of Bible (85.4%) is larger than
the News (71.6%) and Cinema (57.1%), in other words, the Bible has morphologically
more complex forms than the other two corpora. We also observe from Table 2 and 3 that
the BLEU differences between targetmor and source+targetmor is narrow compared to their
baseline counterparts in BLEUsu f f _sep evaluation. Rejoining the suffixes appears detrimental for
BLEUsu f f _re j (in both Table 2 and 3) but we feel that the observed loss is caused rather by the
properties of BLEU. This is because, even a small change in wordforms are treated as separate
tokens in the BLEU evaluation.

Table 4: BLEUstem_onl y evaluation results

In the stem only evaluation (Table 4), splitting suffixes on the target side of the training data
helps in all cases except the Cinema domain translated with the phrase based system. The
target-only vs. both-sides splitting are incomparably close.

Table 5: Manual evaluation on 100 sentences (sentence-level ranking).

119



In the case of manual evaluation (Table 5), the source+targetmor is ranked as the best in phrase
based system whereas in hierarchical system the targetmor performs better. Comparing different
evaluation systems, both targetmor and source+targetmor helps achieving better performance
than the baseline. But, as the results suggest, the targetmor performs only marginally better
than source+targetmor in general.

6 Observations & Error Analysis

From the previous section, we observed that morphological suffix splitting improves the perfor-
mance. Following are some of the observations and possible suggestions in general to improve
the performance further.

• Interpretation of automatic scores like BLEU deserves a great care as the results are
heavily affected by tokenization.

• Suffix splitting reduces only the sparsity problem. This does not solve the agreement
problem such as adding subject’s gender suffixes on the target side verb.

• Suffix splitting reduces the sparsity by allowing more one-to-one word alignments but
that could lead to complex reordering scenarios, see Figure 3.

• Coordination is one of the difficult phenomenon in Tamil. In most cases, both phrase-
based and hierarchical system translations produced the English style coordination instead
of adding coordination suffixes to all the conjuncts. This behaviour could be tweaked
by preprocessing English and adding fake tokens to serve as “placeholders” for Tamil
coordination suffixes.

• Both News and Cinema corpora are sentence aligned automatically using a sentence
aligner. Although a strict threshold has been set to eliminate improbable alignments,
there could be a minor percentage of misaligned sentences.

Conclusion

In this work, we described our experiments with separation of morphological suffixes in English
and Tamil to improve translation quality of phrase-based and hierarchical machine translation
systems. We demonstrated that suffix separation helps in reducing the data sparsity and
improves translation quality.

We also documented our efforts to collect parallel corpora for English and Tamil from web
sources, obtaining about 190,000 sentence pairs in total. To our knowledge, this is currently
the largest amount of data available for the English-Tamil language pair.
