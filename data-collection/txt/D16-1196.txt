Abstract

We explore the use of the orthographic syl-
lable, a variable-length consonant-vowel se-
quence, as a basic unit of translation between
related languages which use abugida or alpha-
betic scripts. We show that orthographic sylla-
ble level translation significantly outperforms
models trained over other basic units (word,
morpheme and character) when training over
small parallel corpora.

1 Introduction

Related languages exhibit lexical and structural sim-
ilarities on account of sharing a common ances-
try (Indo-Aryan, Slavic languages) or being in pro-
longed contact for a long period of time (Indian sub-
continent, Standard Average European linguistic ar-
eas) (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). Translation be-
tween related languages is an important requirement
due to substantial government, business and social
communication among people speaking these lan-
guages. However, most of these languages have few
parallel corpora resources, an important requirement
for building good quality SMT systems.
Modelling the lexical similarity among related

languages is the key to building good-quality SMT
systems with limited parallel corpora. Lexical sim-
ilarity implies that the languages share many words
with the similar form (spelling/pronunciation) and
meaning e.g. blindness is andhapana in Hindi,
aandhaLepaNaa in Marathi. These words could
be cognates, lateral borrowings or loan words from
other languages. Translation for such words can be

achieved by sub-word level transformations. For in-
stance, lexical similarity can be modelled in the stan-
dard SMT pipeline by transliteration of words while
decoding (Durrani et al., 2010) or post-processing
(Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012; Kunchukuttan et al.,
2014).
A different paradigm is to drop the notion of

word boundary and consider the character n-gram
as the basic unit of translation (Vilar et al., 2007;
Tiedemann, 2009a). Such character-level SMT
bas been explored for closely related languages
likeBulgarian-Macedonian, Indonesian-Malaywith
modest success, with the short context of unigrams
being a limiting factor (Tiedemann, 2012). The
use of character n-gram units to address this limi-
tation leads to data sparsity for higher order n-grams
and provides little benefit (Tiedemann and Nakov,
2013).
In this work, we present a linguistically moti-

vated, variable length unit of translation — ortho-
graphic syllable (OS)—which provides more con-
text for translation while limiting the number of ba-
sic units. The OS consists of one or more conso-
nants followed by a vowel and is inspired from the
akshara, a consonant-vowel unit, which is the funda-
mental organizing principle of Indic scripts (Sproat,
2003; Singh, 2006). It can be thought of as an ap-
proximate syllable with the onset and nucleus, but
no coda. While true syllabification is hard, ortho-
graphic syllabification can be easily done. Atreya et
al. (2016) and Ekbal et al. (2006) have shown that
the OS is a useful unit for transliteration involving
Indian languages.
We show that orthographic syllable-level trans-

lation significantly outperforms character-level and
strong word-level and morpheme-level baselines
over multiple related language pairs (Indian as well
as others). Character-level approaches have been
previously shown to work well for language pairs
with high lexical similarity. Ourmajor finding is that
OS-level translation outperforms other approaches
even when the language pairs have relatively less
lexical similarity or belong to different language
families (but have sufficient contact relation).

2 Orthographic Syllabification

The orthographic syllable is a sequence of one or
more consonants followed by a vowel, i.e a C+V
unit. We describe briefly procedures for ortho-
graphic syllabification of Indian scripts and non-
Indic alphabetic scripts. Orthographic syllabifica-
tion cannot be done for languages using logographic
and abjad scripts as these scripts do not have vowels.

Indic Scripts: Indic scripts are abugida scripts,
consisting of consonant-vowel sequences, with a
consonant core (C+) and a dependent vowel (ma-
tra). If no vowel follows a consonant, an implicit
schwa vowel [IPA: ə] is assumed. Suppression of
schwa is indicated by the halanta character follow-
ing a consonant. This script design makes for a
straightforward syllabification process as shown in
the following example. e.g. लक्षमी

(
lakShamI

CV CCV CV

)
is

segmented as ल क्ष मी
(

la kSha mI
CV CCV CV

)
. There are two

exceptions to this scheme: (i) Indic scripts distin-
guish between dependent vowels (vowel diacritics)
and independent vowels, and the latter will consti-
tute an OS on its own. e.g. मुम्बई (mumbaI) →
मु म्ब ई (mu mba I) (ii) The characters anusvaara
and chandrabindu are part of the OS to the left if
they represents nasalization of the vowel/consonant
or start a new OS if they represent a nasal consonant.
Their exact role is determined by the character fol-
lowing the anusvaara.

Non-Indic Alphabetic Scripts: We use a simpler
method for the alphabetic scripts used in our experi-
ments (Latin and Cyrillic). The OS is identified by a
C+V+ sequence. e.g. lakshami→la ksha mi, mum-
bai→mu mbai. The OS could contains multiple ter-
minal vowel characters representing long vowels (oo
in cool) or diphthongs (ai inmumbai). A vowel start-

3 Translation Models

We compared the orthographic syllable level model
(O) with models based on other translation units that
have been reported in previous work: word (W),
morpheme (M), unigram (C) and trigram characters.
Table 1 shows examples of these representations.
The first step to build these translation systems is

to transform sentences to the correct representation.
Each word is segmented as the per the unit of rep-
resentation, punctuations are retained and a special
word boundary marker character (_) is introduced
to indicate word boundaries as shown here:

W: राजू , घराबाहेर जाऊ नको .
O: रा जू _ , _ घ रा बा हे र _ जा ऊ _ न को _ .

For all units of representation, we trained phrase-
based SMT (PBSMT) systems. Since related lan-
guages have similar word order, we used distance
based distortionmodel andmonotonic decoding. For
character and orthographic syllable level models, we
use higher order (10-gram) languages models since
data sparsity is a lesser concern due to small vocabu-
lary size (Vilar et al., 2007). As suggested by Nakov
and Tiedemann (2012), we used word-level tuning
for character and orthographic syllable level models
by post-processing n-best lists in each tuning step to
calculate the usual word-based BLEU score.
While decoding, the word and morpheme level

systems will not be able to translate OOV words.
Since the languages involved share vocabulary, we
transliterate the untranslated words resulting in the
post-edited systems WX and MX corresponding to
the systems W and M respectively. Following de-
coding, we used a simple method to regenerate
words from sub-word level units: Since we represent
word boundaries using a word boundary marker, we

4 Experimental Setup

Languages: Our experiments primarily concen-
trated on multiple language pairs from the two ma-
jor language families of the Indian sub-continent
(Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European and Dravid-
ian). These languages have been in contact for a
long time, hence there are many lexical and gram-
matical similarities among them, leading to the sub-
continent being considered a linguistic area (Eme-
neau, 1956). Specifically, there is overlap between
the vocabulary of these languages to varying de-
grees due to cognates, language contact and loan-
words from Sanskrit (throughout history) and En-
glish (in recent times). Table 2 lists the languages
involved in the experiments and provides an indica-
tion of the lexical similarity between them in terms
of the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR)
(Melamed, 1995) between the parallel training sen-
tences at character level. All these language have
a rich inflectional morphology with Dravidian lan-
guages, and Marathi and Konkani to some degree,
being agglutinative. kok-mar and pan-hin have a
high degree of lexical similarity.

Dataset: We used the multilingual ILCI corpus for
our experiments (Jha, 2012), consisting of a mod-
est number of sentences from tourism and health
domains. The data split is as follows – training:
44,777, tuning 1K, test: 2K sentences. Language
models for word-level systems were trained on the
target side of training corpora plus monolingual cor-
pora from various sources [hin: 10M (Bojar et al.,
2014), tam: 1M (Ramasamy et al., 2012), mar: 1.8M
(news websites), mal: 200K (Quasthoff et al., 2006)
sentences]. We used the target language side of the

parallel corpora for character, morpheme and OS
level LMs.

System details: PBSMT systems were trained us-
ing the Moses system (Koehn et al., 2007), with the
grow-diag-final-and heuristic for extracting phrases,
and Batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) for tun-
ing (default parameters). We trained 5-gram LMs
withKneser-Ney smoothing for word andmorpheme
level models and 10-gram LMs for character and
OS level models. We used the BrahmiNet translit-
eration system (Kunchukuttan et al., 2015) for post-
editing, which is based on the transliteration Mod-
ule in Moses (Durrani et al., 2014). We used un-
supervised morphological segmenters trained with
Morfessor (Virpioja et al., 2013) for obtaining mor-
pheme representations. The unsupervised morpho-
logical segmenters were trained on the ILCI corpus
and the Leipzig corpus (Quasthoff et al., 2006).The
morph-segmenters and our implementation of ortho-
graphic syllabification are made available as part of
the Indic NLP Library1.

Evaluation: We use BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
and Le-BLEU (Virpioja and Grönroos, 2015) for
evaluation. Le-BLEU does fuzzy matches of words
and hence is suitable for evaluating SMT systems
that perform transformation at the sub-word level.

5 Results and Discussion

This section discusses the results on Indian and non-
Indian languages and cross-domain translation.

Comparison of Translation Units: Table 3 com-
pares the BLEU scores for various translation sys-
tems. The orthographic syllable level system is
clearly better than all other systems. It signifi-
cantly outperforms the character-level system (by
46% on an average). The character-based system
is competitive only for highly lexically similar lan-
guage pairs like pan-hin and kok-mar. The sys-
tem also outperforms two strong baselines which ad-
dress data sparsity: (a) a word-level system with
transliteration of OOV words (10% improvement),
(b) amorph-level systemwith transliteration of OOV
words (5% improvement). The OS-level representa-
tion is more beneficial when morphologically rich

languages are involved in translation. Significantly,
OS-level translation is also the best system for trans-
lation between languages of different language fam-
ilies. The Le-BLEU scores also show the same trend
as BLEU scores, but we have not reported it due to
space limits. There are a very small number of un-
translated OSes, which we handled by simple map-
ping of untranslated characters from source to tar-
get script. This barely increased translation accuracy
(0.02% increase in BLEU score).

Why is OS better than other units?: The im-
proved performance of OS level representation can
be attributed to the following factors:
One, the number of basic translation units is

limited and small compared to word-level and

morpheme-level representations. For word-level
representation, the number of translation units can
increase with corpus size, especially for morpholog-
ically rich languages which leads to many OOVs.
Thus, OS-level units address data sparsity.
Two, while character level representation too

does not suffer from data sparsity, we observe
that the translation accuracy is highly correlated
to lexical similarity (Table 4). The high corre-
lation of character-level system and lexical simi-
larity explains why character-level translation per-
forms nearly as well other methods for language
pairs which have high lexical similarity, but per-
forms badly otherwise. On the other hand, the OS-
level representation has lesser correlation with lexi-
cal similarity and sits somewhere between character-
level and word/morpheme level systems. Hence it is
able to make generalizations beyond simple char-
acter level mappings. We observed that OS-level
representation was able to correctly generate words
whose translations are not cognate with the source
language. This is an important property since func-
tion words and suffixes tend to be less similar lexi-
cally across languages.
Can improved translation performance be ex-

plained by longer basic translation units? To ver-
ify this, we trained translation systemswith character
trigrams as basic units. We chose trigrams since the
average length of the OS was 3-5 characters for the
languages we tested with. The translation accuracies
were far less than even unigram representation. The
number of unique basic units was about 8-10 times
larger than orthographic syllables, thus making data
sparsity an issue again. So, improved translation per-
formance cannot be attributed to longer n-gram
units alone.

Robustness to Domain Change: We also tested
the translation models trained on tourism & health
domains on an agriculture domain test set of 1000
sentences. In this cross-domain translation scenario
too, the OS level model outperforms most units of
representation. The only exceptions are the pan-hin
and tel-mal language pairs for the systemMX (accu-
racies of the OS-level system are within 10% of the
MX system). Since the word level model depends on
coverage of the lexicon, it is highly domain depen-
dent, whereas the sub-word units are not. So, even
unigram-level models outperform word-level mod-
els in a cross-domain setting.

Experiments with non-Indian languages: Ta-
ble 6 shows the corpus statistics and our re-
sults for translation between some related non-Indic
language pairs (Bulgarian-Macedonian, Danish-

Swedish, Malay-Indonesian). OS level representa-
tion outperforms character and word level represen-
tation, though the gains are not as significant as In-
dic language pairs. This could be due to short length
of sentences in training corpus [OPUS movie sub-
titles (Tiedemann, 2009b)] and high lexical similar-
ity between the language pairs. Further experiments
between less lexically related languages on general
parallel corpora will be useful.

Effect of training data size: For different train-
ing set sizes, we trained SMT systems with vari-
ous representation units (Figure 1 shows the learning
curves for two language pairs). BPE levelmodels are
consistently better than word as well as morph-level
models, and are competitive or better than OS level
models. Note that bn-hi is a relatively morpholog-
ically simpler language where BPE is just compet-
itive with OS over the complete dataset too as dis-
cussed earlier.

6 Conclusion & Future Work

We focus on the task of translation between re-
lated languages. This aspect of MT research is im-
portant to make available translation technologies
to language pairs with limited parallel corpus, but
huge potential translation requirements. We pro-
pose the use of the orthographic syllable, a variable-
length, linguistically motivated, approximate sylla-
ble, as a basic unit for translation between related
languages. We show that it significantly outper-
forms other units of representation, over multiple
language pairs, spanning different language families,
with varying degrees of lexical similarity and is ro-
bust to domain changes too. This opens up the possi-
bility of further exploration of sub-word level trans-
lation units e.g. segments learnt using byte pair en-
coding (Sennrich et al., 2016).
