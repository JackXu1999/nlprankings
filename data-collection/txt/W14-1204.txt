Abstract

The use of certain font types and sizes im-
prove the reading performance of people
with dyslexia. However, the impact of
combining such features with the seman-
tics of the text has not yet been studied. In
this eye-tracking study with 62 people (31
with dyslexia), we explore whether high-
lighting the main ideas of the text in bold-
face has an impact on readability and com-
prehensibility. We found that highlighting
keywords improved the comprehension of
participants with dyslexia. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first result of this
kind for people with dyslexia.

1 Introduction

Dyslexia is a neurological reading disability which
is characterized by difficulties with accurate
and/or fluent word recognition as well as by poor
spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties
typically result from a deficit in the phonologi-
cal component of language that is often unrelated
to other cognitive disabilities. Secondary conse-
quences include problems in reading comprehen-
sion and reduced reading experience that can im-
pede vocabulary growth and background knowl-
edge (International Dyslexia Association, 2011).

From 10 to 17.5% of the population in the
U.S.A. (Interagency Commission on Learning
Disabilities, 1987) and from 8.6 to 11% of the
Spanish speaking population (Carrillo et al., 2011;
Jiménez et al., 2009) have dyslexia. Even if
dyslexia is also popularly identified with brilliant
famous people, the most frequent way to detect
a child with dyslexia is by low-performance in
school (Carrillo et al., 2011). In Spain, it is es-
timated that four out of six cases of school fail-
ure are related to dyslexia.1 The prevalence of

dyslexia and its impact in school failure are the
main motivations of our work.

Previous eye-tracking studies with people with
dyslexia have shown that their reading perfor-
mance can improve when the presentation of the
text contains certain font types (Rello and Baeza-
Yates, 2013) or font sizes (O’Brien et al., 2005;
Dickinson et al., 2002; Rello et al., 2013c).

Keywords – or key-phrases2– are words that
capture the main ideas of a text. Highlighting key-
words in the text is a well known strategy to sup-
port reading tasks (Weinstein and Mayer, 1986).
In fact, highlighting keywords is recommended to
students with dyslexia (Hargreaves, 2007), as well
as to teachers for making texts more accessible for
this target group (Peer and Reid, 2001).

Here, we present the first study which explores
the modification of the text presentation in rela-
tionship with its semantics, by highlighting key-
words. We measure the impact of highlighting the
text on the reading performance (readability and
comprehensibility) of people with dyslexia using
eye-tracking. Our hypotheses are:

• H1: The presence of highlighted keywords in
the text increases readability for people with
dyslexia.

• H2: The presence of highlighted keywords in
the text increases comprehensibility for peo-
ple with dyslexia.

number or students who drop school before finishing sec-
ondary education (high school). While the average of school
failure in the European Union is around 15%, Spain has
around 25-30% of school failure, 31% in 2010 (Enguita et
al., 2010).

2We use “keywords”, meaning also “key-phrase”, to refer
to both single words or phrases that are highlighted.

2 Related Work

Related work to ours can be found in: (1) natural
language processing (NLP) literature about key-
phrase and keyword extraction (Section 2.1), and
(2) accessibility literature about dyslexia and key-
words (Section 2.2).

2.1 Key-phrase and Keyword Extraction

There is a vast amount of NLP literature on key-
phrase extraction (Kim et al., 2010; Witten et al.,
1999; Frank et al., 1999).

The semantic data provided by key-phrase ex-
traction can be used as metadata for refining NLP
applications, such as summarization (D’Avanzo
and Magnini, 2005; Lawrie et al., 2001), text
ranking (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), indexing
(Medelyan and Witten, 2006), query expansion
(Song et al., 2006), or document management and
topic search (Gutwin et al., 1999).

The closest work to ours is (Turney, 1999) be-
cause they highlight key-phrases in the text to fa-
cilitate its skimming. They compare the highlight-
ing outputs of two different systems, Search 97
and GenEx, using six corpora belonging to differ-
ent genre.

2.2 Accessibility

In accessibility and education literature, highlight-
ing keywords is a broadly recommended learning
strategy (Weinstein and Mayer, 1986). Regarding
students with dyslexia, teachers are encouraged to
highlight keywords to make texts more accessible
(Peer and Reid, 2001; Hargreaves, 2007). These
recommendations are based on qualitative analy-
sis and direct observations with students.

In the applications for people with dyslexia
highlighting is used not for keywords or main
ideas but to help users for tracking their position
when reading such as in ScreenRuler (ClaroSoft-
ware, 2012). Sometimes highlighting is used
simultaneously with text-to-speech technology
(Kanvinde et al., 2012; ClaroSoftware, 2012). In
the SeeWord tool for MS Word (Dickinson et al.,
2002; Gregor et al., 2003), highlighting is used
on the letters where people with dyslexia normally
make mistakes in order to attract the user’s atten-
tion.

Previous studies similar to ours have used
eye-tracking to show how people with dyslexia
can read significantly faster as using certain font
types (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013) or font sizes

(O’Brien et al., 2005; Dickinson et al., 2002; Rello
et al., 2013c).

2.3 What is Missing?

First, we did not find any study that measured ob-
jectively the impact of highlighting keywords in a
text on the readability and comprehensibility for
people with dyslexia. Second, to the best of our
knowledge, there are no studies in assistive tech-
nology that uses an NLP based engine to high-
light keywords for people with dyslexia. In this
work we address the first issue, taking the sec-
ond one into consideration. Hence, we emulated
in the experiment the output that a potential NLP
tool would give for highlighting the main ideas in
the text.

3 Methodology

To study the effect of keywords on readability and
comprehensibility of texts on the screen, we con-
ducted an experiment where 62 participants (31
with dyslexia) had to read two texts on a screen,
where one of them had the main ideas highlighted
using boldface. Readability and comprehensibility
were measured via eye-tracking and comprehen-
sion tests, respectively. The participants’ prefer-
ences were gathered via a subjective ratings ques-
tionnaire.

3.1 Design

In the experiment there was one condition, Key-
words, with two levels: [+keywords] denotes the
condition where main ideas of the text were high-
lighted in boldface and [−keywords] denotes the
condition where the presentation of the text was
not modified.

The experiments followed a within-subjects de-
sign, so every participant contributed to each of
the levels of the condition. The order of the condi-
tions was counter-balanced to cancel out sequence
effects.

When measuring the reading performance of
people with dyslexia we need to separate readabil-
ity3 from comprehensibility4 because they are not
necessarily related. In the case of dyslexia, texts
that might seen not readable for the general popu-
lation, such as texts with errors, can be better un-
derstood by people with dyslexia, and vice versa,

people with dyslexia find difficulties with standard
texts (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2012).

To measure readability we consider two depen-
dent variables derived from the eye-tracking data:
Reading Time and Fixation Duration. To measure
comprehensibility we used a comprehension score
as dependent variable.

• Fixation Duration. When reading a text, the
eye does not move contiguously over the text,
but alternates saccades and visual fixations,
that is, jumps in short steps and rests on parts
of the text. Fixation duration denotes how
long the eye rests on a single place of the
text. Fixation duration has been shown to be
a valid indicator of readability. According to
(Rayner and Duffy, 1986; Hyönä and Olson,
1995), shorter fixations are associated with
better readability, while longer fixations can
indicate that the processing load is greater.
On the other hand, it is not directly propor-
tional to reading time as some people may
fixate more often in or near the same piece
of text (re-reading). Hence, we used fixation
duration average as an objective approxima-
tion of readability.

• Reading Time. The total time it takes a par-
ticipant to completely read one text. Shorter
reading durations are preferred to longer
ones, since faster reading is related to more
readable texts (Williams et al., 2003). There-
fore, we use Reading Time, that is, the time
it takes a participant to completely read one
text, as a measure of readability, in addition
to Fixation Duration.

• Comprehension Score. To measure text com-
prehensibility we used inferential items, that
is, questions that require a deep understand-
ing of the content of the text. We used
multiple-choice questions with three possi-
ble choices, one correct, and two wrong. We
compute the text comprehension score as the
number of correct answers divided by the to-
tal number of questions.

• Subjective Ratings. In addition, we asked
the participants to rate on a five-point Likert
scale their personal preferences and percep-
tion about how helpful the highlighted key-
words were.

3.2 Participants

We had 62 native Spanish speakers, 31 with a con-
firmed diagnosis of dyslexia.5 The ages of the par-
ticipants with dyslexia ranged from 13 to 37, with
a mean age of 21.09 years (s = 8.18). The ages
of the control group ranged from 13 to 40, with a
mean age of 23.03 years (s = 7.10).

Regarding the group with dyslexia, three of
them were also diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder. Fifteen people were studying or already
finished university degrees, fourteen were attend-
ing school or high school, and two had no higher
education. All participants were frequent readers
and the level of education was similar for the con-
trol group.

3.3 Materials

In this section we describe how we designed the
texts and keywords that were used as study mate-
rial, as well as the comprehension and subjective
ratings questionnaires.

Base Texts. We picked two similar texts from
the Spanish corpus Simplext (Bott and Saggion,
2012). To meet the comparability requirements
among the texts belonging to the same experiment,
we adapted the texts maintaining as much as pos-
sible the original text. We matched the readabil-
ity of the texts by making sure that the parameters
commonly used to compute readability (Drndare-
vic and Saggion, 2012), had the same or similar
values. Both texts:

(a) are written in the same genre (news);

(b) are about similar topics (culture);

(c) have the same number of words (158 words):

(d) have a similar word length average (4.83 and
5.61 letters);

(e) are accessible news, readable for the general
public so they contained no rare or technical
words, which present an extra difficulty for
people with dyslexia (Rello et al., 2013a).

(f) have the same number of proper names (one
per text);

5All of them presented official clinical results to prove
that dyslexia was diagnosed in an authorized center or hos-
pital. The Catalonian protocol of dyslexia diagnosis (Speech
Therapy Association of Catalonia, 2011) does not consider
different kinds of dyslexia.

The Museo Picasso Málaga includes new works of the artist in its permanent collection

The Andalusian Minister of Culture, Paulino Plata, presented a new reorganization of the 
permanent collection of the Picasso Museum that, coinciding with the birth anniversary 
of the painter, incorporates a wide selection of works by Pablo Picasso provided by the 
Almine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso Foundation for Art. Paintings, sculptures and ceramics 
from different periods and styles compose this set of 43 pieces given for 15 years by the 
mentioned foundation. The incorporation of these creations assumes, according to the 
Andalusian Council, a valuable contribution to the permanent collection of the 
Museum Picasso Málaga. In this way, a visitor can now contemplate paintings and 
sculptures that, for the first time, are exposed in the gallery.

(g) have the same number of sentences (five per
text) and similar sentence complexity (three
sentences per text contain relative clauses);

(h) one text has two numerical expressions
(Rello et al., 2013b) and the other has two
foreign words (Cuetos and Valle, 1988), both
being elements of similar difficulty; and

(i) have the same number of highlighted key-
phrases.

An example of a text used (translation from Span-
ish6) is given in Figure 1.

Keywords. For creating the keywords we high-
lighted using boldface the words which contained
the main semantic meaning (focus) of the sen-
tence. This focus normally corresponds with the
direct object and contains the new and most rele-
vant information of the sentence (Sperber and Wil-
son, 1986). We only focused on the main sen-
tences; subordinate or relative clauses were dis-
missed. For the syntactic analysis of the sen-
tences we used Connexor’s Machinese Syntax
(Connexor Oy, 2006), a statistical syntactic parser
that employes a functional dependency grammar
(Tapanainen and Järvinen, 1997). We took direct
objects parsed by Connexor without correcting the
output.

Comprehension Questionnaires. For each text
we manually create three inferential items. The
order of the correct answer was counterbalanced
and all questions have similar difficulty. An exam-
ple question is given in Figure 2.

Subjective Questionnaire. The participants rated
how much did the keywords helped their reading,

their ease to remember the text, and to which ex-
tent would they like to find keywords in texts.

Text Presentation. The presentation of the text
has an effect on reading speed of people with
dyslexia (Kurniawan and Conroy, 2006; Gregor
and Newell, 2000). Therefore, we used a text
layout that follows the recommendations of pre-
vious research. As font type, we chose Arial,
sans serif, as recommended in (Rello and Baeza-
Yates, 2013). The text was left-justified, as rec-
ommended by the British Association of Dyslexia
(British Dyslexia Association, 2012). Each line
did not exceeded 62 characters/column, the font
size was 20 point, and the colors used were black
font with creme background,7 as recommended in
(Rello et al., 2012).

3.4 Equipment
The eye-tracker used was the Tobii T50 that
has a 17-inch TFT monitor with a resolution of
1024×768 pixels. It was calibrated for each par-
ticipant and the light focus was always in the
same position. The time measurements of the eye-
tracker have a precision of 0.02 seconds. The dis-

33



tance between the participant and the eye-tracker
was constant (approximately 60 cm. or 24 in.) and
controlled by using a fixed chair.

3.5 Procedure

The sessions were conducted at Universitat Pom-
peu Fabra in a quiet room and lasted from 20 to 30
minutes. First, we began with a questionnaire to
collect demographic information. Then, we con-
ducted the experiment using eye-tracking. The
participants were asked to read the texts in silence
and to complete the comprehension tests after each
text read. Finally, we carried out the subjective rat-
ings questionnaire.

4 Results

None of the datasets were normally distributed
(Shapiro-Wilk test) and neither of them had an
homogeneous variance (Levene test). Hence, to
study the effect of Keywords on readability and
comprehensibility we used the Wilcoxon non-
parametric test for repeated measures.

4.1 Differences between Groups

We found a significant difference between
the groups regarding Reading Time (W =
2578.5, p < 0.001), Fixation Duration (W =
2953, p < 0.001) and Comprehension Score
(W = 1544, p = 0.040).

Participants with dyslexia had lower compre-
hension scores and longer reading times and fixa-
tions than participants from the control group (see
Table 1).

4.2 Readability

We did not find a significant effect of Keywords
on Reading Time for the participants with dyslexia
(W = 210, p = 0.688) and for the participants
without dyslexia (W = 702.5, p = 0.351).

Similarly, there were found no significant ef-
fects of Keywords on Fixation Duration for the
participants with dyslexia (W = 259.5, p =
0.688) or without dyslexia (W = 862, p = 0.552).

4.3 Comprehension

For the participants with dyslexia, we found a sig-
nificant effect on the Comprehension Score (W =
178.5, p = 0.022). Text with highlighted key-
words led to significantly higher comprehension
scores in this target group.

For the control group we did not find an ef-
fect on the Comprehension Score (W = 740, p =
0.155).

4.4 Subjective Ratings

The debate of what analyses are admissible for
Likert scales – parametric or non-parametric tests–
is pretty contentious (Carifio and Perla, 2008). A
Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the datasets were
not normally distributed. Hence, we also used the
Wilcoxon non-parametric test.

• Readability. We found no significant dif-
ferences between the groups regarding how
much highlighting keywords helped them
reading the text (W = 504.5, p = 0.316).

Both groups found that keywords can slightly
help their reading (x̃ = 3, x̄ = 3.0, s =
1.155)8 for the participants with dyslexia,
and (x̃ = 3, x̄ = 2.8, s = 0.966) for the
control group.

• Memorability. We found no significant differ-
ences between the groups regarding if high-
lighting keywords help to memorize the text
(W = 484, p = 0.493).

Both agree that keywords help them to re-
member the text moderately (x̃ = 4, x̄ =
3.636, s = 1.002) for the participants with
dyslexia and (x̃ = 4, x̄ = 3.450, s = 1.085)
for the control group.

• Preferences. Also, no differences between
groups were found regarding their prefer-
ences in finding highlighted keywords in the
texts (W = 463, p = 0.727).

Participants with dyslexia would like to find
texts including highlighted keywords (x̃ = 4,
x̄ = 3.636, s = 1.136), as well as in the con-
trol group (x̃ = 4, x̄ = 3.600, s = 1.057).

5 Discussion

Regarding the differences between the groups, our
results are consistent with other eye-tracking stud-
ies to diagnose dyslexia that found statistical dif-
ferences (Eden et al., 1994).

8We use x̃ for the median, and s for the standard devia-
tion.

Table 1: Results of the Keywords experiment.

5.1 Hypothesis 1

Shorter reading times and fixation durations are
associated with better readability (Just and Car-
penter, 1980). Since Keywords had no significant
effect on readability, we cannot confirm H.1: The
presence of highlighted keywords in the text in-
creases readability for people with dyslexia.

One possible reason for this is that text presen-
tation might only have an impact on readability
when the whole text is modified, not only portions
of it. Most probably, if one text was presented all
in boldface or italics and the other one in roman,
significant differences could have been found as in
(Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013) where the effect of
different font styles was evaluated. Another expla-
nation could be that the text might look different to
what the participants were used to see and partic-
ipants might need some time to get used to high-
lighted keywords in the text before testing read-
ability effects.

From the content point of view, the fact that the
readability did not change as expected, since the
content of the text is not modified in any of the
conditions.

5.2 Hypothesis 2

Because participants with dyslexia had a signifi-
cantly increase in text comprehension with texts
having highlighted keywords, our findings support
H.2: The presence of highlighted keywords in the
text increases comprehensibility for people with
dyslexia.

This improvement might be due to the possibil-
ity that keywords might help to remember the text
better. This is consistent with the pedagogic lit-
erature that recommends this strategy for learning
and retaining text content (Weinstein and Mayer,
1986).

5.3 Subjective Perception of Keywords
The fact that using keywords for learning is a
shared strategy for both groups (Weinstein and
Mayer, 1986), may explain that no significant
differences between groups were found regard-
ing their preference and perception of keywords
on readability and memorability. Also, high-
lighted keywords in bold are found in general
school books, not only in materials for people with
dyslexia, so both groups were familiar with the
conditions.

5.4 Limitations
This study has at least two limitations. First, the
study was performed with a manually annotated
dataset. These annotations were based on the out-
put of the Connexor parser. We have not found any
evaluation of Connexor’s accuracy when parsing
syntactic constituents. Nevertheless, it has been
observed that the accuracy for direct objects in
Spanish achieves results that varies from 85.7%
to 93.1%, depending on the test set (Padró et al.,
2013). Second, the participants read only two texts
because we did not wanted to fatigue participants
with dyslexia. Now that we have observed that
they could have read more texts, we will carry out
further studies with more texts that will incorpo-
rate automatic keyword extraction.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

Our main conclusion is that highlighted keywords
in the text increases the comprehension by peo-
ple with dyslexia. For the control group no effects
were found. Our results support previous educa-
tional recommendations by adding the analysis of
the impact of highlighting keywords using objec-
tive measures.

35



These results can have impact on systems that
rely on text as the main information medium.
By applying keyword extraction automatically and
highlighting them, digital texts could become eas-
ier to understand by people with dyslexia.

Future work include the integration of auto-
matic keyword extraction and its evaluation using
a larger number of texts. Also, different strategies
to select keywords will be explored and the com-
prehension questionnaires will be enriched com-
bining inferential and literal questions. Future
work also includes testing memorability using ob-
jective measures in addition to the subjective re-
sponses of the participants.
