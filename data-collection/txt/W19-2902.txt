Abstract 

The word to that precedes verbs in English 
infinitives is optional in at least two 
environments: in what Wasow et al. (2015) 
have called the “do-be construction”, and in 
the complement of help, explored in the 
present work. Wasow et al. found that a 
preceding infinitival to increases the use of 
optional following to in the environment 
they examined, but the use of to in the 
complement of help is reduced following to 
help. We examine two hypotheses 
regarding why the same function word is 
primed by prior use in one construction and 
inhibited in another. We then test 
predictions made by the two hypotheses, 
finding support for one of them.  

1 Introduction 

Wasow et al. (2015) investigated factors that 
influence the optional use of to in examples like 
(1),1 which Flickinger and Wasow (2013) had 
dubbed the “do-be construction”. 

All they do is (to) report gloomy things.2  (1) 

The subject of this construction always contains a 
relative clause containing a form of the verb do; its 
main verb is a copula; and the copula is followed 
by a verb phrase, whose inflection must take one of 
three forms: the one matching the form of do (as in 
2), the full infinitive form (that is, with to, as in 3), 
or a bare infinitive (without to, as in 4).  

What we're doing is going down the same path.  (2) 
One thing he did was to listen. (3) 
The best that can be done is discuss this issue.  (4) 

                                                             
1 All examples in this paper are drawn from the Corpus of 
Contemporary American English (COCA; Davies, 2008-). 

Wasow et al. found that a variety of factors 
influence the choice between the last two of these. 
In particular, the rate of to in the post-copula VP is 
significantly higher than would be expected (given 
the other factors) when the occurrence of do in the 
subject is infinitival, as in (4)—that is, to do. This 
was attributed to the well-known phenomenon of 
priming (cf. Branigan and Pickering, 2017 and 
references cited there).  
 Another environment in which the infinitival to 
is optional is in VP complements of the verb help, 
with or without noun phrase (NP) object, as in (5). 

We helped (them) (to) clear the table.  (5) 

Descriptive grammars of English (e.g., Peters, 
2004:247) often note this peculiarity of help, 
sometimes anecdotally suggesting factors that 
might influence the use of to. Among these is the 
form of help. More specifically, in the words of 
Lohmann’s (2011) quantitative corpus study of this 
phenomenon, “The bare infinitive is preferred after 
cases of to help.” This is just the opposite of 
priming: A preceding to reduces, rather than 
increases, the use of to in this construction. Such 
anti-priming has been given a number of names in 
the linguistics literature, including haplology, the 
Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP), and horror 
aequi. See Walter (2007) for a detailed discussion 
and many examples of the application of these 
terms. We will use the term interference.  
 Our question is why a preceding occurrence of 
infinitival to increases the use of to in one 
environment where it is optional, but has the 
opposite effect in another. What is it about these 
two constructions that leads to this difference in the 
use of to?

 We begin by presenting a multivariate corpus 
study of help (to), investigating factors that 
simultaneously influence the use of to, interference 
being just one among several. Section 2 
summarizes the compilation and annotation of our 
sample then presents our statistical model of these 
data. Section 3 discusses two possible explanations 
for the opposite influence of a preceding infinitival 
to on the use of a following optional to in the two 
constructions, then further explores a prediction 
that follows from one of the two hypotheses 
presented, providing data confirming that 
prediction. 

2 Corpus Study of help (to) 

Lohmann’s earlier study of help (to), as we have 
termed the construction, was based on a smaller 
sample (N=1,718) and explored fewer factors of 
influence than Wasow et al.’s study of do-be (to). 
The do-be (to) work also drew from the Corpus of 
Contemporary American English (COCA), vs. 
Lohmann’s use of data from the British National 
Corpus. For better comparison then with the prior 
results for do-be (to), we have followed Wasow et 
al. in investigating a similar range of factors, with 
data drawn from COCA, in the present study using 
a downloaded version pre-tagged for part of 
speech, with a total of 520M words divided among 
five genres: academic, fiction, magazines, 
newspapers, and spoken.  

2.1 Extracting Tokens 
We began by programmatically identifying 135K 
sentences that included a verb-tagged form of help. 
We then passed these sentences through the 
CoreNLP PCFG constituency parser (version 
2.0.2; Klein and Manning, 2003; Manning et al., 
2014) to annotate grammatical structure. 

Our initial look through several dozen examples 
found that help (to) constructions were represented 
by a surprising variety of structures in parser 
output, including a number that we considered to 
be incorrect. This guided us in crafting a syntactic 
tree search query (TGrep2; Rohde, 2005) aimed at 
balancing precision and recall,3 while still allowing 
maximal flexibility in terms of any intervening 

                                                             
3 Of all tokens returned, precision is defined as the fraction 
that were intended targets. Of all intended targets, recall is 
the portion returned by the search. 
4 We randomly selected 100 tokens from our original sample 
of all COCA sentences that had included a form of help and 

material: between infinitival to and help (i.e., “split 
infinitives”); between help (or a direct-object NP) 
and to (if present) preceding the complement verb; 
or between to and the complement verb. We 
identified 78,283 tokens for further analysis. 
Checking a random sample (N=100) found 
precision of 98.3%, recall of 76.3%, yielding F1 
measure 85.9.4 

2.2 Factors in our Analysis 
To model variation in our dependent measure, the 
presence or absence of to before a VP complement 
of help, we began by considering elements 
analogous to those previously shown to be 
significantly predictive of optional to in the do-be 
construction, including phonological, syntactic, 
cognitive, and information-theoretic measures. 
Specifically, we programmatically annotated each 
token for: 

• The primary independent variable (predictor) 
of interest, whether help is preceded by 
infinitival to (again, allowing intervening 
material). Per Lohmann (2011), infinitival to 
is expected to disfavor optional to before 
complement verb (i.e., interference). 

• Accessibility of the complement verb lemma, 
as reflected by relative frequency within the 
COCA corpus. This was log-adjusted to 
account for the Zipfian distribution of verb 
frequencies, as illustrated in Figure 1. 

 
Figure 1: Corpus frequency of help-complement verb 
lemmas. For regression modeling, frequencies are log-
adjusted to produce a nearer to linear fit. 

judged that 76 of these represented help (to) constructions. 
Our subsequent tree search query selected 58 of these valid 
tokens and one non-help (to) token, yielding precision = 
58/59 (0.983), recall = 58/76 (0.763). F1 is the harmonic 
mean of precision and recall, 2pr/(p+r) = 0.859.

• Predictability of complement verb lemma in 
context—context here being its likelihood of 
following help (to)—reflected by its relative 
frequency within the COCA help (to) data, 
once again log-adjusted. 

• Intra-token distances, as derived from the 
constituency parse, including from head noun 
of subject NP to complement verb, and from 
head noun of object NP (if present) to 
complement verb. Head nouns within NP 
syntactic constituents were identified via the 
CoreNLP dependency parser (Chen and 
Manning, 2014). 

• Phonological environment of (optional) to 
site. Where complement verb is preceded by 
optional to, we classified the initial segment 
of whatever word follows to (which may be 
negation, an intervening adverb, or the 
complement verb itself) into one of four 
categories: vowels, sibilants, sonorants, or 
other.5 We similarly classify the final segment 
of whatever word precedes to. For tokens 
omitting optional to, we classified the initial 
segment of the complement verb and the final 
segment of whatever word precedes it. We 
then annotated each example for whether the 
given environment was expected, a priori, to 
favor or disfavor optional to. Since to is stop-
initial, its insertion was expected to be 
promoted by OCP when preceded and 
followed by a pair of vowels, sibilants, or 
sonorants, but disfavored between pairs of 
“other” segments (i.e., stops, affricates). 

• Stress pattern (i.e., prosody), encoded as 
clash, lapse, or other. As with phonological 
environment above, we considered the words 
following and preceding optional to if 
present, or the complement verb and word 
preceding it where to is omitted. Clash was 
coded if the preceding word has final stress 
and the following word has initial stress. 
Lapse was coded if these are both unstressed.6

Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict), 
version 0.7b (2014), for each word.

case syllabic stress for each word. 
7 We follow the programmatic animacy-annotation scheme 
of Melnick 2017, expanding on a technique from Theijssen 
2012. As previously noted, a dependency parse identifies the 
head noun within each subject NP. This is then lemmatized

presence of infinitival to before help; (iii) presence of 
direct object NP following help; (iv) form of verb help; 
(v) to-favoring or disfavoring phonological environment 
surrounding to-site; and (vi) lexical stress environment 
surrounding to-site. X-axis represents number of tokens. 

 

• Surface form of help (help, helps, helped, or 
helping). 

• Spoken vs. written portion of the corpus. 

To these we added measures not modeled in the 
prior work on the do-be (to) construction: 

• Animacy of subject.7 

• Whether or not help is negated. 

• Whether or not help is preceded by a modal 
auxiliary. 

Finally, we encoded an element representing a key 
difference between help (to) and do-be (to): 

• Presence of a direct object following help.  

While the do-be (to) construction does not present 
this option, an object NP following help changes 
the construction’s syntactic interpretation. In help 
(to) constructions, help is a “control verb”, so-
called because when followed by a complement 
verb, help functions to control what is understood 

(via NLTK; Bird et al., 2009) and compared to a static list of 
animates built from WordNet (Princeton University, 2010) 
person and animal terms, a Wikipedia list of notable U.S. 
companies, and an additional whitelist to capture reflexive 
pronouns, personal pronouns other than it and them, and 
certain impersonal pronouns (someone, everybody, and so 
on). Subject head nouns of length greater than two letters in 
all caps are also marked ANIMATE.

to be the subject of the subordinate VP, but just 
what that subject is understood to be in any given 
token depends on whether or not help has an object 
NP. Without an object NP, the subject of the 
complement verb is understood to be the same as 
the subject of help. For example: 

Sunshine helps (to) grow flowers.  (6) 

In (6), “sunshine” is understood to be the subject of 
both main verb help and complement verb grow. In 
(7), on the other hand, while “sunshine” is again 
the subject of help, object NP “gardeners” is now 
understood to be the subject of grow: 

Sunshine helps gardeners (to) grow flowers.  (7) 

Following annotation, we peformed additional 
clean-up of the data to improve accuracy. These 
steps included: 

• For the spoken (i.e., transcribed) portion of 
the corpus only, we excluded tokens where 
help is preceded by want to, have to, or going 
to, as we suspect that these transcriptions 
could represent tokens actually spoken closer 

to a one-word [wɑnə] (“wanna”), [hæftə] 
(“hafta”), or [gənə] (“gonna”), that is, without 
a distinct to ([tu]), the potential contributor to 
an interference effect. 

• Limiting analysis to tokens with complement 
verb lemmas appearing 50 or more times 
within our sample, in order to improve 
reliability of relative frequency estimates. 

After all adjustments, the final data set for analysis 
totals 63,593 tokens. Figure 2 shows univariate 
distributions for several factors laid out above. 

2.3 Modeling Variation 
To assess the effect of infinitival to before help 
(i.e., on the inclusion of infinitival to before a 
following complement verb) while simultaneously 
controlling for other expected influences, we fit our 
data with a mixed-effects binary logistic regression 
model (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000; Bresnan et al., 
2007; Baayen et al., 2008), predicting infinitival 
complement VP from fixed effects for the several 
factors described above, with a random effect for 
complement verb lemma.

 Since the presence or absence of an NP direct 
object following the main verb help affects both a 
given token’s projected syntactic structure and its 
inter-constituent dependencies (e.g., whether the 
subject of the complement verb is controlled by the 
subject or object of help), we explored interactions 
of object NP presence with a handful of other 
predictors, including subject animacy, distance to 
complement verb from controller (subject or object 
of help), and both availability and predictability of 
the complement verb. Stepwise reduction based on 
significant contribution to model fit retained all 
main effects and eliminated only the interaction of 
object presence with complement verb availability. 
Table 1 presents the resulting model, with pseudo-
R2 = 0.382. 

The primary observation is that the interference 
effect of infinitival help—i.e., disfavoring optional 
to before a following complement verb—is 
confirmed here under multivariate control 
(β = -2.072, z = -33.4, p < 0.0001). 

While other factors were included chiefly to 
maximize accuracy of our interference effect 
estimate, we briefly review their results. Most of 
the several factors with analogs in Wasow et al.’s 
model of the do-be construction appear to have 
similar effects here. Written language produces 
less optional to than spoken, presumed to reflect 
less pressure from online processing demands. 
Increased distance—in this case, to the 
complement verb from the subject of help or from 
its direct object, if present—promotes optional to, 
as increased dependency length generates 
additional processing load (Hawkins, 2004). 
Increased predictability of a particular complement 
verb in context (i.e., prior probability of 
encountering it following help) disfavors optional 
to, which we take as an example of the principle of 

Uniform Information Density (UID; Levy and 
Jaeger, 2007; Jaeger; 2010). Here, UID would 
predict that to would be more likely to be included 
where it would serve to spread out the arrival of 
new information, or surprisal, in those cases where 
the complement verb is less predictable in context 
(i.e., the inverse of predictability). Surprisingly, 
increased overall corpus frequency of the 
complement verb—as opposed to its frequency just 
in the context of the help (to) construction—
appears to promote optional to, counter to its effect 
in Wasow et al.’s do-be results, though exploring 
this further falls beyond our present scope. 

We also find a few significant interactions. The 
main effect of an animate help subject—and thus 
an animate subject for the complement verb, as 
well, when help has no direct object—appears to 
disfavor optional to, but this effect was largely 
neutralized in the presence of a direct object. This 
follows from noting that in such cases, it is the help 
direct object that is interpreted as the subject of the 
complement verb. The significant distance effect, 
conversely, was only further enhanced in such 
“object control” cases. In the context of the shorter 
dependency length between direct object and 
following complement verb in these examples, 
small increases in length had a larger effect. 
Finally, like the subject animacy effect, the UID 
effect (predictability of complement verb in 
context) appears to be largely neutralized in the 
presence of a direct object. 

Figure 3(a) illustrates the relative contribution 
to model fit for each fixed effect. The presence of 
an NP object following help—with its critical 
syntactic role, when present, in determining the 
subject of the complement verb—makes the single 
largest contribution to model fit, followed by our 
primary object of study, the interference effect (i.e.,

3 Two Hypotheses 

Our model thus confirms under multivariate 
control the observation that preceding infinitival to 
disfavors optional to before a following 
complement verb, in contrast with the do-be (to) 
construction, where Wasow et al. (2015) had found 
preceding infinitival to favoring optional following 
to—that is, interference in help (to) vs. priming in 
do-be (to). Why do the constructions behave so 
differently in this respect? 

3.1 The Locality Hypothesis  
A first hypothesis is that the preceding to in the 
help construction tends to be closer to the site of 
optional to than in the do-be construction. When no 
object NP intervenes between infinitival help and a 
VP complement, the site of optional to is most 
often separated from the preceding to by just one 
monosyllabic word. In the do-be construction, by 
contrast, there must be a minimum of two words 
(do and some form of be) between infinitival do 
and the site of optional to.  

Most examples in the linguistics literature of 
what Walter (2007) calls “repetition avoidance” are 
very local: avoidance of identical or similar 
segments, tones, inflections, or words that are 
adjacent. Hence, it is perhaps natural to conjecture 
that interference is necessarily a very short-lived 
effect, and to look for a solution to our puzzle in 
terms of locality. But the psycholinguistics 
literature also contains examples of less local 
interference effects, for example, Ferreira and 
Firato (2002). 

Both our corpus study and that of Wasow et al. 
found significant effects of the distance to the 
optional to site from an obligatory preceding verb 
(do or help). But locality cannot be the full 
explanation of the difference in the behavior of 
optional to in the two constructions. The 
interference effect of to immediately preceding 
help persists even when an object NP intervenes 
between help and its VP complement. This is 
confirmed by separately refitting our model to just 
those tokens with an object NP. The negative 
influence of preceding to on following to remains 
highly significant (β = -1.41, z = -17.6, p < 0.0001). 
In this environment, the optional to site following 

help is as far from a preceding to as in the do-be 
construction, a minimum of two words in each 
construction and often more, as in (8). Hence, 
something else must be involved.  

Professionals learn how [to help] families of young 
children with visual impairments [promote] emergent 
literacy skills  (8) 

3.2 The Function Hypothesis 
The second hypothesis was first suggested to us 
by Emily Bender (p.c.). She noted that the verb do 
that is an obligatory part of the do-be construction 
functions essentially as an elliptical replacement 
for the post-copula VP. For example, in (1) part 
of what is predicated of the referent of they is that 
they report gloomy things, and do stands in for the 
VP report gloomy things. 
 Elliptical constructions generally exhibit some 
structural parallelism between the ellipsis site and 
the antecedent. The exact nature of the parallelism 
constraints in such constructions has been the 
subject of a great deal of linguistic literature over 
the past half century; see, for example, Hankamer 
and Sag (1976) and van Craenenbroeck and 
Merchant (2013). These parallelism constraints 
presumably assist the listener (or reader) in 
identifying the antecedent and thus determining 
the intended interpretation of elliptical 
expressions. The priming of to in the do-be 
construction, then, can be viewed as one 
component of the expected parallelism in ellipsis.  
 In contrast, there is no elliptical relationship 
between the verb help and its complement VP. 
However, when both help and its complement are 
full infinitives (with to), it is an instance of self-
embedding (also known as recursion)—that is, a 
construction (in this case, an infinitival VP) 
directly embedded within another construction of 
the same type.  
 It has been known for over half a century (see 
Miller and Chomsky, 1963:286) that center self-
embedding creates severe processing difficulty. 
Although less attention has been paid to the effect 
of self-embedding on the edge of a constituent, 
there is some literature (e.g., Christiansen and 
MacDonald, 2009) showing that right-branching 
recursive structures also cause processing 
difficulty, albeit less than center self-embedding. 
Without the second occurrence of to, to help VP 
is not an instance of self-embedding. Hence, it 
should not be surprising that we observe 



17

 

 
 

interference when to help takes a full infinitival 
complement.  

3.3 A Prediction 
If the interference effect that we observe in the help 
(to) construction is due to avoidance of self-
embedding, then it should show up with other 
verbs that take infinitival complements. Even 
though help is exceptional in allowing the word to 
to be omitted, most other verbs that can take 
infinitival complements can also occur in other 
environments. For example, expect, need, try, and 
want all can take simple NP objects; appear, ask, 
and try can all take a prepositional complement; 
and seem can take an adjectival complement. If 
speakers avoid embedding infinitival VPs directly 
under another infinitival VP, the effect should be 
observable with these other verbs as well. With the 
other verbs avoiding self-embedding it is not so 
simple as merely replacing the full infinitival VP 
with a VP lacking to. But other paraphrases that 
avoid recursion are always possible. Hence, we 
predict that the rate of occurrence of infinitival VP 
complements in these other verbs should be lower 
when the verbs themselves are infinitival (i.e. 
immediately preceded by to) than in other 
environments.  

3.4 Testing the Prediction 
To test this prediction, we turn once again to 
COCA, identifying all verb lemmas ever observed 
to take an infinitval complement. This yields 
10,931 types in the corpus. Further restricting 
analysis to those verb lemmas appearing more than 
1,000 times overall and at least 10 times with an 
infinitival complement yields 1,019 types. We 
examined all 70.1M occurances of these verbs, 
classifying each token into one of four categories: 
(a) non-infinitival verb, V1; (b) verb with infinitval 
complement, V1 to V2; (c) infinitival verb, to V1; or 
(d) infinitival verb with infinitval complement, 
to V1 to V2.8 

Our prediction can be restated as in (9), the 
expectation that the conditional probability of the 
appearance of a complement verb given infinitival 
main verb should be much less than the conditional 
probability of complement verb given non-
infinitival main verb. 

                                                             
8  Without resorting to parsing the entire 520M-word corpus, 

we limited extractions here, unlike our full help study, to 
tokens without intervening material. 

 𝑝(𝑉$|	𝑡𝑜	𝑉)) ≪ 𝑝(𝑉$|𝑉))  (9) 

This is formulated in (10) in terms of our four-way 
classification above. 

 (,)
(-)

≪ (.)
(/)

 (10) 

In a single metric, we expect the ratio in (11) to be 
much less than 1. 

 (,)/(-)
(.)/(/)

≪ 1 (11) 

We found this measure to be less than 1 for 837 of 
our 1,019 verbs (82.1%), representing 53.4M of 
70.1M tokens (76.2%). Across the entire set of 
verbs, we calculate an aggregate ratio of 0.292. 
Table 2 presents individual results for ten common 
verbs that take an infinitival complement, 
including help, in ascending order by ratio value. 
 

Verb (d/c) / (b/a) 
help  0.083 
hope  0.104 
like  0.131 
expect  0.133 
appear  0.134 
seem  0.154 
demand  0.232 
need  0.386 
ask  0.417 
try  0.817 

Table 2: Values << 1 suggest an infinitival main verb 
disfavors appearance with an infinitival complement. 
 
To consider the statistical significance of these 
findings, we employ McNemar’s Chi-Squared test, 
which corrects for lack of independence of 
observations, required here as each verb provides 
tokens in multiple conditions (i.e., in each of our 
four token classification categories). Of the 837 
verbs noted above as disfavoring infinitival 
recursion (ratio < 1), 824 (98.4%) show a 
significant result under McNemar’s χ2 (p < 0.05). 
Finally, an aggregate test of the full data set finds 
χ2 = 110.04, df = 1, p < 0.0001. 

Infinitival verb self-embedding indeed appears 
to be strongly disfavored in this large corpus of 
modern American English, in turn supporting the 
function hypothesis for the apparent interference 
effect on optional to before a complement verb 
following infinitival help.

4  Conclusions 

Our corpus investigations of optional to have 
shown that both priming and interference occur in 
the use of the same optional function word. Which 
one occurs in a given environment is not arbitrary. 
Rather, it depends on more general properties of 
those environments: we find priming where 
repetition can facilitate processing, as it does in 
elliptical constructions; and we find interference 
where repetition creates processing difficulty, as it 
does in self-embedding.
