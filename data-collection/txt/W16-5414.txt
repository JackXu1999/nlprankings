Abstract

Although MWE are relatively morphologically and syntactically fixed expressions, several types
of flexibility can be observed in MWE, verbal MWE in particular. Identifying the degree of
morphological and syntactic flexibility of MWE is very important for many Lexicographic and
NLP tasks. Adding MWE variants/tokens to a dictionary resource requires characterizing the
flexibility among other morphosyntactic features. Carrying out the task manually faces several
challenges since it is a very laborious task time and effort wise, as well as it will suffer from
coverage limitation. The problem is exacerbated in rich morphological languages where the
average word in Arabic could have 12 possible inflection forms. Accordingly, in this paper we
introduce a semi-automatic Arabic multiwords expressions resource (SAMER). We propose an
automated method that identifies the morphological and syntactic flexibility of Arabic Verbal
Multiword Expressions (AVMWE). All observed morphological variants and syntactic pattern
alternations of an AVMWE are automatically acquired using large scale corpora. We look for three
morphosyntactic aspects of AVMWE types investigating derivational and inflectional variations
and syntactic templates, namely: 1) inflectional variation (inflectional paradigm) and calculating
degree of flexibility; 2) derivational productivity; and 3) identifying and classifying the different
syntactic types. We build a comprehensive list of AVMWE. Every token in the AVMWE list is
lemmatized and tagged with POS information. We then search Arabic Gigaword and All ATBs
for all possible flexible matches. For each AVMWE type we generate: a) a statistically ranked list
of MWE-lexeme inflections and syntactic pattern alternations; b) An abstract syntactic template;
and c) The most frequent form. Our technique is validated using a Golden MWE annotated list.
The results shows that the quality of the generated resource is 80.04%.

1 Introduction

Multiword expressions (MWE) are complex lexemes that contain at least two words reflecting a single
concept. They can be morphologically and syntactically fixed expressions but also we note that they
can exhibit flexibility especially in verbal MWE. Such morphosyntactic flexibility increases difficulties
in computational processing of MWE as they are harder to detect. Characterizing the internal structure of
MWE is considered very important for many natural language processing tasks such as syntactic parsing
and applications such as machine translation (Ghoneim and Diab, 2013; Carpuat and Diab, 2010). In
lexicography, entries for MWE in a lexicon should provide a description of the syntactic behavior of
the MWE constructions, such as syntactic peculiarities and morphosyntactic constraints (Calzolari et al.,
2002). Automatically identifying the syntactic patterns and listing/detecting their possible variations
would help in lexicographic representation of MWE, as the manual annotation of MWE variants suffer
from many disadvantages such as time and effort consuming, subjectivity and limited coverage.

The problem is exacerbated for morphologically rich languages, where an average word could have
up to 12 morphological analyses such as the case for the Arabic language which is highly inflectional.

Several challenges are encountered in automatic identification and parsing of MWE in Arabic especially
verbal ones, because of their highly morphosyntactic flexibility.

This paper focuses on the Arabic verbal MWE(AVMWE) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We
broadly consider a MWE as a verbal one if it contains at least one verb in its elements. We focus
exclusively on the flexibility of the elements existing in the AVMWE and their syntactic alternatives.
Lexical flexibility (word/word) is meant to be outside the scope of this paper (Ex. rajaE bixuf∼ayo
Hunayon1 Vs. EAd bixuf∼ayo Hunayon where both expressions mean return empty handed).

From a theoretical point of view, we identify four components, for each AVMWE as shown in Table
1. The verbal components are any verb within a MWE. Elements are the non-verbal components such as
noun, adjective or particle. The syntactic variable is a slot that reflects the syntactic function in a MWE
without being itself a part of the construction, and the gaps are some inserted modifiers that might occur
between MWE elements (Hawwari et al., 2014).

Verbal component Gap Syntactic variable Element-1 Element-2 Element-3 Syntactic variable
BW >aEoTaY >amosi (FulAnN) AlDawo’ Al>axoDar li- (FulAnK)
En-Gloss gave yesterday (somebody) the-light the-green to (something/somebody)
En-translation (somebody) gave the green light to (somebody/something)

Table 1: Example for the entities we are considering within a MWE

The main objective of our work is to automatically acquire all observed morphological variants and
syntactic pattern alternations of a MWE using large scale corpora, using an empirical method to identify
the morphological and syntactic flexibility of AVMWE.

2 Related Work

A considerable amount of literature has been published on the morphosyntactic characteristics of MWE
. These studies focused on various morphological aspects, within different contexts on different lan-
guages. Gurrutxaga and Alegria (2012) and Baldwin et al. (2003) applied latent semantic analysis to
build a model of multiword expression decomposability. This model measures the similarity between
a multiword expression and its elements words, and considers the constructions with higher similarities
are greater decomposability.

Diab and Bhutada (2009) present a supervised learning approach to classify the idiomaticity of the
Verb-Noun Constructions (VNC) depending on context in running text.

Savary (2008) presents a comparative survey of eleven lexical representation approaches to the inflec-
tional aspects in MWE in different languages, including English, French, Polish Serbian German, Turkish
and Basque.

Al-Haj et al. (2013) applied to Modern Hebrew an architecture for lexical representation of MWEs.
The goal was to integrate system that can morphologically process Hebrew multiword expressions of
various types, in spite of the complexity of Hebrew morphology and orthography.

Zaninello and Nissim (2010) present three electronic lexical resources for Italian MWE. They created
a series of example corpora and a database of MWE modeled around morphosyntactic patterns.

Nissim and Zaninello (2013) employed variation patterns to deal with morphological variation in order
to create a lexicon and a repository of variation patterns for MWE in morphologically-rich Romance
languages.

Al-Sabbagh et al. (2013) describe the construction of a lexicon of Arabic Modal Multiword Expres-
sions and a repository for their variation patterns. They used an unsupervised approach to build a lexicon
for Arabic Modal Multiword Expressions and a repository for their variation patterns. The lexicon con-
tains 10,664 entries of MSA and Egyptian modal MWE and collocation, linked to the repository.

The closest work to ours is that of (Hawwari et al., 2012). They created a list of different types of
Arabic MWE collected from various dictionaries which were manually annotated and grouped based
on their syntactic type. The main goal was to tag a large scale corpus of Arabic text using a pattern-

matching algorithm and automatically annotated to enrich and syntactically classify the given MWE list.
Their work didn’t approach the derivational or lexical aspects.

To the best of our knowledge, to date, none of the previous addressed the systematic investigation of
morphosyntactic features and derivational productivity of AVMWE and their syntactic properties.

3 Linguistic Background

This section gives a brief overview of the linguistic background of the verbal inflectional and derivational
system in Modern Standard Arabic.

3.1 Arabic Verbal MWE (AVMWE)
The verbal MWE is a MWE that includes a verb or more within its word elements. AVMWE could be
classified, according to their lexical nature, into three types:

• Verbal Idioms: We mean by verbal Idiom any idiomatic expression that has a verb within its com-
ponents. An example of verbal idiom is as follows: taraka (fulAnN) Al-jamala bi-maA Hamala2.
[(someone) left every thing behind]

• Light verb (support verb): a light verb construction is consisting of: a) a verb that is semantically
light, and b) a noun or verbal-noun carries the core meaning of the construction. >axa* (fulAnN)
Al-v >ora [(someone take a revenge]

• Verb Particle construction: An expression includes a verb and a particle that they have together a
meaning. (this construction includes phrasal verbs): ragiba (fulAnN) fi [wish for]

A MWE is considered flexible when it has more than one accepted inflected or syntactic form. Flexibility
can be applied to inflectional, derivational, syntactic and lexical aspects of a MWE. We roughly distin-
guish between flexibility and idiomaticity as follows: flexibility affects the morphosyntactic properties,
and idiomaticity is more related to the compositionality and semantic content of an MWE.

Inflection is a morphological subfield that belongs to single words encoding its inflectional categories
(number, gender, person, case, tense, voice, mood, aspect) using several affixes to represent the mor-
phosyntactic variation. Inflectional flexibility of an MWE is a sum of the inflectional flexibility of its
elements.

A MWE token instance includes every possible inflectional variation form of the MWE type that can
occur in a corpus. On the other hand, a MWE type is the canonical (citation) form that is used to be the
basic form representing all the possible tokens of a MWE lexeme. Lexicographers chose the simplest
form to be a canonical form serving as a head word or citation form for a lexical entry. By an MWE
lexeme we refer to all the possible inflectional forms that are observed for the MWE in a corpus.

3.2 Inflectional Categories
The Arabic verb has the following inflectional categories:

• Tense: perfective, imperfective, imperative
• Voice: active, passive
• Mood: indicative (marofuwE), subjunctive (manoSuwb), jussive (majozuwm)
However, verb subject inflects for person (first, second, third person), gender (masculine, feminine),

number (singular, dual, plural) and syntactic case (nominative (marofuwE), accusative (manoSuwb), gen-
itive (majoruwr)).

AVMWE vary in their inflectional flexibility degree. One group is fixed, for example Had∼ivo wa-lA
Haraj (speak freely), second group has a degree of flexibility as >aTolaq (fulAnN) sAqyohi li-AlryiH
(ran away), the verb >aTolaq is fully flexible for any affixes (>aTlaqA, >aTlaquw, >aTlaqato, etc).

3.3 Derivational Productivity

Derivation is a very productive and regular word-formation mechanism in the Arabic language. Unlike
inflection, derivation belongs to the lexicon and is completely syntax independent. As AVMWE vary
in productivity, some allow verbal derivations, for example fAza bi-qaSabi Alsaboqi (he came first/he
is the winner) allows the derived nominal MWE fA}izN bi-qaSabi Alsaboqi, where the verb fAza is
derivationally related to the noun fA}izN. On the other hand, there are many AVMWE that are fixed
derivationally as they do not exhibit derivational productivity for example >aSobaH ha$iymaF ta*oruw-
hu AlriyAHu (vanish).

3.4 Syntactic flexibility

As it is a Verb Phrase (VP), AVMWE is governed by VP grammatical rules and operations such as word
order, agreement, government. Syntactic flexibility for an MWE occurs in texts in different configura-
tions. Some of AVMWE have some degree of syntactic flexibility, which appears in word order variability
for a given MWE (VSO: balag Alsayolu AlzubaY(it reached the limits), SVO: Alsayolu balag AlzubaY).
Although word order in Arabic is relatively free, the word-order flexibility in AVMWE occurs rarely,
because the AVMWE phrases are more rigid than ordinary phrases syntactically. An example for the
syntactic fixed AVMWE is AixotalaTa AlHAbilu biAln∼Abili (it became a mess).

4 Approach

We introduce an automatic approach for building a morphosyntactic lexicon for Arabic verbal MWE
starting from a gold seed list. We use a manually created list of Arabic verbal MWE and try to find all
possible matches with any morphological variations in a large dataset in a process of MWE Paradigm
detection (MPD). After that we create the morphosyntactic feature vector of each match and calculate
the level of flexibility of each MWE.

Figure 1 illustrates the different components of the MPD system. For each new MWE expression
in seed list, the “Matcher” component replaces each word in the input MWE with its lemma to find all
possible inflections for the MWE during the matching process. Since deverbals such as verbal nouns, past
participle active, and past participle passive inherit the semantic and syntactic structures from their verbs
they are derived from, the “Matcher” component adds the derivatives of each verb in the input MWE
as possible matching candidates in addition to its lemma. Technically these are derivational variants.
That way, we can find all possible forms of the input MWE during the matching process. For example,
if the input is the MWE “fAz biqaSabi Alsaboqi meaning he is the winner”, it will be matched with
“fAzuw biqaSabi Alsaboqi meaning the winning” and “fA}izN biqaSabi Alsaboqi meaning the winner”,
reflecting inflectional variation with fAz being observed as fAzuw in the former, and derivational variation
with fAz being observed as fA}izN in the latter.

The “Matcher” looks up the new form of the MWE (i.e. the lemma form with the different verb deriva-
tives candidates) in large preprocessed datasets that are described in section 5.2 below while enabling any

116



possibility of gapping between the words (Ex. fAz Alwalad biqaSabi Alsaboqi the boy is the winner) or
word ordering (Ex. waqaEa fiy HaySa bayoSa. Or fiy HaySa bayoSa waqaEa got confused).

The preprocessed datasets have a one-to-one mapping between the input surface form of each sentence
and its corresponding lemma form. Thus, the “Surface Form Retriever” component uses that to find the
original surface form of each sentence retrieved by the “Matcher” component. The “Paradigm Creator”
component generates a unique list of all surface form sentences retrieved by the “Surface Form Retriever”
component to create a list of all possible morphological variations of the input MWE. To make the list as
generic as possible, we replace each word that is not part of the MWE with its POS tag. The “Canonical
Form Creator” after that uses the full list of sentences created by the the “Surface Form Retriever”
component and finds the most frequent matched form of the input MWE

For each word in the matched MWE, we create a morphosyntactic feature vector of nine elements that
are being extracted from the POS tags of the matched MWE.The first element is the POS. Three elements
(aspect, voice, mood) are only for verbs, while nominals have the following attributes (case, state), and
(person, number, gender) apply to all words. In addition to that, we try to identify the candidate subject
and object for each match as follows:

• Subject: The candidate subject is identified as the pronoun attached to the verb if it is explicitly
mentioned in the pos of the verb, otherwise it is the first nominative nominal after the verb;

• Object: The candidate object is identified as the pronoun attached to the verb if it is explicitly
mentioned in the pos of the verb. Otherwise it is the first accusative nominal after the verb.

5 Experimental Setup

5.1 Datasets
We use different types of datasets to evaluate our approach for creating the MWE token paradigm re-
source.

Corpora used for the resource creation:

• ATB: The Arabic Treebanks. The selected ATBs represent three different genres:
Newswire;3Broadcast News;4 and, Weblogs;5

• Gigawords: The Arabic Gigaword fourth edition;6

• AVMWE: Is a list of more about 4000 verbal MWE semi automatically extracted from two traditional
Arabic Monolingual Dictionaries;

• Verbs-to-Derivatives: Is a list of 10k MSA verbs and their possible derivations. It is developed to
help our system recognize the derivational relations between verbs and their nominal counterparts
(Active participle, passive participle and Gerund) (Hawwari et al., 2013).

Evaluation Datasets:

• DevDB: 2000 randomly selected lines from the ATB and Gigawords used for system tuning;
• TstDB: 2000 randomly selected lines from the ATB and Gigawords used for system evaluation.
Both DevDB and TstDB are manually annotated. Each line is annotated with a presence/absence tag

indicating whether an MWE from the AVMWE list or not. If a line is annotated as having an MWE, all of
the elements of this MWE are annotated and the number of gaps between each two elements is identified.
Table 2 shows the annotation distribution of both datasets

3ATB-P1-V4.1(LDC2010T13),ATB-P2-V3.1 (LDC2011T09) and ATB-P3-V3.2 (LDC2010T08)

5.2 Data Preparation

To enable matching based on Lemma and POS, we processed the ATB and Gigawords into a a series of
tuples with the following elements: “Token-Lemma-POS”. For ATB, we extracted this format from the
gold analysis in the integrated files. For Gigawords, we used MADAMIRA toolkit (Pasha et al., 2014) for
tokenization, lemmatization and POS tagging. The selected tokenization scheme is ATB-tokenization
and the POS tag-set is ATB full tag-set. The AVMWE was also processed using MADAMIRA to guarantee
consistency in the matching process. MADAMIRA provides a list of possible analyses per word with the
most probably one selected as the candidate analysis. Due to short context, the accuracy of the selected
analysis by MADAMIRA wasn’t high. Accordingly, we post-processed the list of possible analyses per
word and selected the most probable analysis that matches the gold assigned coarse-grained POS.

6 Paradigm Detection Evaluation

We used the processed AVMWE list as the input gold MWE list to our paradigm detection system MPD.
Also, Verbs-to-Derivatives is used to help the matching algorithm to match the derivatives of each verb
in the input multi words expressions as well.

Table 3 shows the results of running the paradigm detector on DevDB with different schemes (i.e.
different gapping sizes and with and without enabling word reordering). We report the results as the
F-score of correctly tagging an MWE in DevDB, the F-score of correctly tagging the sentences that do
not have MWE, and the weighted average F-score of both of them for all schemes. The results shows
that the best weighted Average F-score is 80.61% when we allow a maximum gap size of 2 between the
MWE constituent words and without enabling the word order to be varied.

By running the best setup on the TstDB, we found that the weighted average F-score is 80.04%

6.1 Error Analysis

MADAMIRA 6.55%
literal 3.53%
Eval-err 0.25%
Syn-function 0.25%

Table 4: Paradigm detector error analysis

Table 4 shows the error distribution of the paradigm detector on the TstDB. We can see that limiting the
maximum gapping size to two and disabling word reordering while matching are the main sources of
errors. Together they are responsible for 51.38% of the errors, which suggests that the gap size and word
reordering should be more flexible. We should have some smarter way to decide the gapping size and
words reordering status per MWE type; not by generalizing them on all types. For example “ya>oxu*
bi+ Eayon AlAiEotibAr means considers” did not match with “ta>oxu* mA TuriH fiy mu&otamar Al-
manAmap bi+ Eayon Aljid∼iyap wa+ AlAiEotibAr” because of the gapping size restriction. And “ba*al
jahodi +h means did his effort” did not match with “Aljuhuwd Altiy tabo*ulul +hA” because the word
reordering is disabled.

Another challenging problem responsible for 20.15% of the errors is the verb particle construction;
where a certain verb when attached to a certain preposition, they act like an MWE. This issue is that
while matching, it is hard to know if a certain preposition should be attached to the target verb or another
one. This leads to false identification for the match if the decision of the attachment was not correct. Ex:
“yajib EalaY +h means he should be” incorrectly matched with “yajib >n yaEoqid EalaY >roDihi he
has to held on his land” because EalaY is considered attached to “yajib” while it is actually attached
to yaEoqid as it assumed a gapping of two words, while it should have attached the particle to the low,
second and closest verb yaEoqid.

Polysemy is also a hard problem. It is responsible for 17.88% of the errors. Errors due polysemy
occur when words in the input MWE type have more than one meaning. But since the matching process
only takes the lemma and POS into account and word senses are not part of the matching, the paradigm
detector could tag some cases as valid matches. Ex:“Hayovu kAn meaning wherever” is incorrectly
matched with “Hayovu kAn AlAibonu yaloEab meaning because the sone was playing”. The issue
came from the word Hayovu that means where or because.

The morphological analyzer and POS tagger (MADAMIRA) is the source of 6.55% of the errors. When
MADAMIRA incorrectly analyzes some words, some wrong matches occur. Ex: “*ahabat riyHu +hu
means has been forgotten” did not match with “*ahabot riyHi +hu” because MADAMIRA analyzed the
word “*ahabat means gone” as “*ahabot means I went”

3.53% of the errors are due to the MWE being idiomatic in some contexts and literal in others. Ex.
“tajAwaz Huduwd +hu” meaning “Exceeded his limits” incorrectly matched “tatajAwaz AlHuduwd
AljugorAfiy∼ap” meaning “Transcended the geographic boundaries”

The remaining 0.5% errors are due to some minor issues: 0.25% errors are due to manual annotation
errors, while the other 0.25% errors are due to fact that the matched morphological variant from the input
MWE has a different syntactic function than the input MWE. Ex. “HAwal EabavAF” meaning “Tried
in vain” is incorrectly matched with “yHAwl AlEbv” meaning “Attempted to tamper with”. This is
because the word “EabavAF” which is an adverb is a derivation of the noun “AlEbv” which plays the
role of an object in this verb noun construction.

7 SAMER

To build the proposed Arabic MWE resource, we ran the paradigm detector on the ATB and Gigawords
using the best configuration we found. The system found 732335 matches for 1884 MWE out of the 4000

119



MWE in the input AVMWE list.
The automatically created resource is reflected in the following five tables:

• All matches table: Contains the 732335 matches that are automatically detected by the paradigm
detector and pointers to their original locations in the ATB and Gigawords;

• Flexibility table: This table has the 1884 rows representing the types of MWE that the paradigm
detector found matches for. The columns represent the words of the MWE where the value of each
cell shows the number of different forms that this element matched with. For example if a certain
cell has the number “5”, this means that its corresponding word matched with five different unique
morphological variants;

• MWE-Lexeme table: This table shows the different morphological forms of each word in each
MWE and their probabilities that are identified by the paradigm detector;

• Sorted-Grouped-tokens table: Shows the probability of all matches of each MWE in a descending
order. So, if there is a MWE that has 10 matches, we calculate the unique form for each of them and
find the probability of each unique value. The number of grouped types of all matches is 38408;

• MWE-Types table: this table has1884 rows; one row for each MWE type. The columns show num-
ber of matches, the most frequent token with its probability, and the union of the morphosyntactic
features of each word across all tokens of each MWE type. Example: if the union of the gender of
the second word across all matches of MWE number i is {M,F}; this means that the second word of
the MWE number i has a flexibility to change the gender between masculine or feminine.

7.1 Statistical Analyses

The number of the MWE types in our automatically created resource is 1884. They consist of 1901
unique verbal words and 3104 unique non-verbal words. Each type of the 1884 MWE has an average fan
out of 20 different forms due to the morphological or inflectional changes the MWE words.

The results show that 15.5% of the MWE types do not allow any gaps between the constituent words
(No-Gaps), while 52.1% of the MWE types allow gapping between all the constituent words (Full-Gaps)
and the remaining 32.4% of the types allow gapping only between some of the constituent words (Part-
Gaps).
Examples:

• No-Gaps: “dub∼ira bi+ layolK meaning conspired” matched with “dub∼ira bi+ layolK”

• Full-Gaps: “ka$af AlqinAE Ean meaning unveiled ” matched using one gap between the first two
words with “ka$af b +h AlqnAE En meaning unveiled using it” and using one gap between the
second two words with “tk$f AlqnAE AlzA}f En meaning unveiled the fake thing”

• Part-Gaps: “ka$∼ar Ean >anoyAbi +h meaning express anger” matched using one gap between
the first two words with “tuka$∼ir turokiyA Ean >anoyAbi +hA meaning Turkey expressed its
anger”

We found that 15.7% of the MWE types are fixed. They do not have any morphological or inflectional
variations in all matched instances (Ex: lA yaxoTuro bi+ bAlK meaning it will never come to your
mind). But the other 84.4% have a higher degree of flexibility that they can match with instances with
different morphological or inflectional variations (Ex: HAla duwna that means “prevented” has a match
with tHwl duwna). 4.7% of the matched verbal MWE types have matches with the derivatives of the
verbal part (Ex: kAl bi+ mikoyAlayon meaning “injustice” is matched with Alkyl bi+ mikoyAlayon).
Furthermore, the results show that non-verbal components of the MWE type have more tendency to stay
fixed than the verbal parts. Since 51.7% of the non-verbal components stay fixed in all matched instances
while only 17.7% of the verbs stay fixed.

Tables 5 and 6 show the morphosyntactic feature flexibility distribution for the non-verbal components
and the verbal ones respectively across all MWE matches. The tables show that the mood is the most rigid
feature (76.4% of the MWE types have fixed mood) while gender is the most flexible feature (87.08% of
the MWE types have different values of the gender within the matched cases).

Feature Fixed Flexible
gender 87.08% 12.92%
number 85.18% 14.82%
case 56.28% 43.72%
state 63.66% 36.34%

8 Conclusion

We introduced an automatically built MWE resource that covers all the morphological variations of a list
of AVMWE in the basic form. Each morphological variant is accompanied with all of its instances in
the ATB and Arabic Gigawords. Furthermore, for each word in the MWE, we added a morphosyntactic
feature vector of nine elements {pos, aspect, voice, mood, person, gender, number, case, state)}. We
validated our approach constructing an automatic MWE paradigm detector in running text. Our system
yielded an weighted average f-score of 80.61% on a dev set, and 80.04% on an unseen test data. The
error analysis shows that there is no generalized maximum gapping size, and enabling or disabling word
reordering decisions should not be generalized on all MWE in the input list. Instead, more sophisticated
techniques are required to find the best decisions for each case.
