Abstract

We propose a method for the annotation of
Japanese civil judgment documents, with
the purpose of creating flexible summaries
of these. The first step, described in the
current paper, concerns content selection,
i.e., the question of which material should
be extracted initially for the summary. In
particular, we utilize the hierarchical argu-
ment structure of the judgment documents.
Our main contributions are a) the design
of an annotation scheme that stresses the
connection between legal issues (called
issue topics) and argument structure, b) an
adaptation of rhetorical status to suit the
Japanese legal system and c) the definition
of a linked argument structure based on le-
gal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report
agreement between two annotators on sev-
eral aspects of the overall task.

1 Introduction

Automatic summarization has become increas-
ingly crucial for dealing with the information over-
load in many aspects of life. This is no differ-
ent in the legal arena, where lawyers and other
legal practitioners are in danger of being over-
whelmed by too many documents that are relevant
to their specialized task. The situation is aggra-
vated by the length and complexity of legal doc-
uments: for instance, the average sentence length
in Japanese legal documents is 93.1 characters, as
opposed to 47.5 characters in Japanese news text.
One reason for the long sentences is the require-
ment on judges to define their statement precisely
and strictly, which they do by adding additional
restrictive clauses to sentences. As a result, it is
not possible to read every document returned by a
search engine. The final goal of our work is there-

fore to provide automatic summaries that would
enable the legal professions to make fast decisions
about which documents they should read in detail.

To this end, we propose an annotation scheme
of legal documents based on a combination of two
ideas. The first of these ideas is the observation
by (Hachey and Grover, 2006) that in the legal
domain, content selection of satisfactory quality
can be achieved using the argumentative zoning
method. The second idea is novel to our work and
concerns the connection between legal argumen-
tation and summarization. We propose to iden-
tify and annotate each relevant legal issue (called
Issue Topic), and to provide a linked argumen-
tation structure of sub-arguments related to each
Issue Topic separately. This can provide sum-
maries of different levels of granularity, as well
as summaries of each Issue Topic in isolation. In
the current paper, we describe all aspects of the
annotation scheme, including an annotation study
between two expert annotators.

2 The structure of judgment documents

Legal texts such as judgment documents have
unique characteristics regarding their structure and
contents. Japanese judgment documents are writ-
ten by professional judges, who, after passing the
bar examination, are intensively trained to write
such judgments. This results in documents with
certain unique characteristics, which are reflected
in the annotation scheme proposed in this pa-
per. The document type we consider here, the
judgment document, is one of the most impor-
tant types of legal text in the Japanese legal sys-
tem. Judgment documents provide valuable in-
formation for the legal professions to construct
or analyze their cases. They are the direct out-
put of court trials. The Japanese Code of Civil
Procedure demands that “the court renders its

22



judgment based on the original judgment docu-
ment” (Japanese Ministry of Justice, 2012a, Arti-
cle 252). The types of documents we work with in
particular are Japanese Civil (as opposed to Crim-
inal) case judgment documents from courts of first
instance.

There also exist official human summaries of
judgment documents, which we can use to inform
our summary design, although they were issued
only for a small number of documents.

2.1 Argument structure

The legal system that is in force in a par-
ticular country strongly affects the type and
structure of legal documents used, which
in turn has repercussions for summarization
strategies. The first source of information for
our summary design is a guideline document
for writing judgment documents of civil cases
(Judicial Research and Training Institute of Japan,
2006). In 1990, the “new format” was proposed,
based on the principle that issue-focused judg-
ment should make the document clearer, more
informative and thus more reader-friendly
(The Secretariat of Supreme Court of Japan,
1990). Although both the use of the guidelines
and of the “new format” is voluntary, in prac-
tice we observed a high degree of compliance
with the new format of the guidelines in recent
Japanese judgment documents. This is for in-
stance evidenced in the common textual structure
shared amongst the documents. The “Fact and
Reasons” section takes up the biggest portion
of the document and is therefore the target of
our summarization task. “Facts and Reasons”
consists of a claim (typically brought forward by
the plaintiff), followed by a description of the
case, the facts agreed among the interested parties
in advance, the issues to be contested during
the trial, and statements from both plaintiff and
defendant. The final part is the judicial decision.
The entire structure described above is often
marked typographically and structurally, e.g. in
headlines.

Our second source of information concerns the
argument structure of the legal argument. A
Japanese Civil Case judgment document forms
one big argument, depicted in Fig. 1. This argu-
ment structure includes the plaintiff’s statements,
the defendant’s statements, and the judges’ state-
ment supporting their arguments. At the top of the

structure, there is the root of the argument which
states the judicial decision as the final conclusion
to the plaintiff’s accusation. We call this the level
0 argument.

The level 0 argument breaks down into several
sub-arguments, which usually each cover one im-
portant topic to be debated. We call this the level 1
argument. Each level 1 argument might itself con-
sist of sub-arguments at lower levels (levels 2, 3,
4, . . . ). The relation between levels is of type “sup-
port”. In this kind of arguments, there are also “at-
tack” relations. These occur, for instance, when a
plaintiff argues in favor of the negated claim of the
defendant, and vice versa. However, because these
“attack” relationships follow the logic of the legal
argumentation in a regular and systematic way, we
decided not to explicitly model them in order to
avoid redundancy in our annotation.

Our annotation scheme models this fact by
calling level 2 units “FRAMING-main”, units at
level 3 or lower “FRAMING-sub”, and by provid-
ing “support” links in the form of FRAMING link-
ing between them. At the bottom of the argument
structure, facts provide the lowest level of support,
although in this work we do not model argumen-
tation below level 3.

2.2 Issue Topics

The main organizing principle in the structure of
the judgment document are the topics of each of
the argumentation strands. This structure is a
direct outcome of the Japanese judicial system,
where most civil cases start with “preparatory pro-
ceedings”. The goal of this procedure, which is
carried out ahead of the trial under participation
of all parties, is to define the issues to be tried

23



(Japanese Ministry of Justice, 2012b). These are
called Issue Topics. Issue Topics are the main con-
tentious items to be argued about between the in-
terested parties. What could be a possible Issue
Topics depends on the case alone; the number
of issue topics is therefore unlimited. Examples
include “whether the defendant X was negligent
in supervising”, “the defendant Y’s exact actions
during the crucial time frame” or “what is the ef-
fect of the law Z”.

It is our working hypothesis that Issue Top-
ics (which correspond to level 1 topics in our
parlance) are extremely important in generating
meaningful, coherent and useful summaries. Most
legal cases consist of several Issue Topics; note
that each Issue Topic is covered by its own ar-
gument subtree as depicted in Figure 1. In the
best summaries the logical flow is organized in
such a way that the final judicial decision can be
traced back through each Issue Topic’s connec-
tions. Minimally, this requires recognizing which
sentence refers to which Issue Topic, i.e., linking
each Issue Topic with the textual material support-
ing it. In what followes, we will call this task
“Issue Topic linking”.

2.3 Rhetorical structure

To exploit the idea that argument structure is a
crucial aspect for legal summarization, we take a
rhetorical status based approach. This method was
originally defined for the summarization of scien-
tific articles by Teufel and Moens (2002), but later
studies such as Hachey and Grover (2006) applied
the rhetorical status approach to the legal text do-
main for the context of English law.

Hachey and Grover defined the following seven
labels: In English law, the judgment first states
the facts and events, corresponding to category
“FACT”. “PROCEEDINGS” labels sentences
which restate the details of previous judgments
in lower courts. “BACKGROUND” is the label
for quotations or citations of law materials which
Law Lords use to discuss precedents and legisla-
tion. “FRAMING” is a rhetorical role that cap-
tures all aspects of the Law Lord’s argumentation
for their judgment. “DISPOSAL” is the actual de-
cision of the lord which indicates the agreement
or disagreement with a previous ruling1. “TEX-
TUAL” is used in situations where the sentence

1Since Hachey and Grover’s target documents are from
the UK House of Lords, trials are always brought forward at
Courts of Appeal.

describes the structure of the document, rather
than discussing content related to the case.

Hachey and Grover reported an inter-annotator
agreement of K=0.83 (N=1955, n=7, k=2; where
K is the kappa coefficient, N is the number of sen-
tences, n is the number of categories and k is the
number of annotators). Other researchers adopted
the rhetorical status approach to their respective
legal systems (Farzindar and Lapalme (2004) for
the Canadian law and (Saravanan and Ravindran,
2010) for the Indian law). Farzindar and La-
palme’s agreement figures are not available, but
Saravanan and Ravindran’s inter-annotator agree-
ment of K=0.84 (N=16000; n=7, k=2) is remark-
ably similar to that of Hachey and Grover.

Our approach follows these studies in also us-
ing rhetorical structure (which we adapt to the
Japanese system), but we combine this analysis
with the two other levels of annotation motivated
earlier (FRAMING linking and Issue Topic link-
ing). We therefore model argument structure at a
more detailed level than the earlier studies, by also
considering the lower level hierarchical structure
of argumentative support.

Based on the Issue Topic structure given in Fig-
ure 1, we propose to build summaries of differ-
ent granularities, which have been inspired by the
human summaries. Figure 2 shows an ideal sam-
ple of a structure-aware summary, using material
manually extracted from an actual judgment doc-
ument (our translation). The sample focuses on a
specific Issue Topic of the case, namely “whether
the execution officer D was negligent or not”.

While full Issue Topic and FRAMING linking
annotation would allow very sophisticated sum-
maries, our fall-back strategy is to create simpler
summaries using only the final conclusion and the
main supporting text such as judicial decisions.
For these simple summaries, performing only au-
tomatic rhetorical status classification is sufficient.

3 Annotation scheme

As discussed above, we use rhetorical status clas-
sification, which is a standard procedure in le-
gal text processing. We also introduce two types
of linking after rhetorical structure determination.
These two types of linking are very different in
nature and therefore need to be treated separately.
The first kind of linking, Issue Topic linking, es-
tablishes a link from every single rhetorical sta-
tus segment to the Issue Topic which the segment

24



The plaintiff insists that the court executing officer was
negligent in that the officer didn’t notice that a person had
committed suicide in the real estate when he performed an
investigation of the current condition of the real estate, and
also insists that the execution court was negligent in that
the court failed to prescribe the matter to be examined on
the examination order. As a result, the plaintiff won a suc-
cessful bid for the estate with a higher price than the actual
value of the estate given that the plaintiff did not have the
information that the property was stigmatized. The plain-
tiff claims compensation for damage and delay from the
defendant.
[Issue Topic]: Whether the execution officer D was neg-
ligent or not.
The measures performed by the officer were those that are
normally implemented for examination. From the circum-
stances which the execution officer D perceived, he could
not have realized that the estate was stigmatized. The of-
ficer cannot be regarded as negligent in that negligence
would imply a dereliction of duty of inspection, which,
given that there were sufficient checks, did not happen.
Concerning the question whether the officer had the duty
to check whether the estate was stigmatized, we can ob-
serve various matters – in actuality, the person who killed
himself happened to be the owner of the estate and the le-
gal representative of the Revolving Credit Mortgage con-
cerned, the house then became vacant and was offered for
auction, but we can also observe the following: other per-
sons but the owner himself could have committed suicide
in the estate, for instance friends and family; there was
a long time frame during which the suicide could have
happened; the neighbors might not have answered the offi-
cer’s questions in a forthcoming manner, even if they were
aware of the fact that the estate was stigmatized; there are
several factors to affect the value of the estate beyond the
fact that the estate was stigmatized, and it is not realistic
neither from a time perspective nor an economic perspec-
tive to examine all such factors specifically; and the bid-
ders in the auction were in a position to examine the estate
personally as the location of the estate was known – taking
these relevant matters into consideration, it is a justified
statement that the officer didn’t have the duty to check in a
proactive manner whether the estate was stigmatized.
Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim is unreasonable since it is
hard to say that the officer was negligent.
[Issue Topic]: Whether the examination court was neg-
ligent or not.
The plaintiff’s claim is unreasonable for the additional rea-
son that it is hard to say that the examination court was
negligent.
Given what has been said above, it is not necessary to judge
the other points;the plaintiff’s claim is unreasonable so the
judgment returns to the main text.

concerns. In contrast, the second kind of linking,
which aims to model the “support” relationship
between level 2 and level 3 shown in Figure 1, is
much more selective: it only applies to those text
units between which a direct “support” relation-
ship holds. We will now introduce the following
four annotation tasks: 1. Issue Topic Identification
– Issue Topic spans are marked in text, and iden-

Label Description

IDENTIFYING The text unit identifies a discussion
topic.

CONCLUSION The text unit clearly states the con-
clusion from argumentation or dis-
cussion.

FACT The text unit describes a fact.
BACKGROUND The text unit gives a direct quotation

or reference to law materials (law or
precedent) and applies them to the
present case.

FRAMING-main The text unit consists of argumenta-
tive material that directly support a
CONCLUSION unit.

FRAMING-sub The text unit consists of argumen-
tative material that indirectly sup-
ports a CONCLUSION unit or that
directly supports a FRAMING-main
unit.

OTHER The text unit does not satisfy any of
the requirements above.

Table 1: Our Rhetorical Annotation Scheme for
Japanese Legal judgment documents

tifiers are given to each Issue Topic; 2. Rhetorical
Status Classification – each text unit is classified
into a rhetorical status; 3. Issue Topic Linking – all
rhetorical units identified in the previous stage are
linked to a Issue Topic; 4. FRAMING Linking –
for those textual units participating in argumenta-
tion links between level 2 and level 3 arguments
involving FRAMING-main, FRAMING-sub and
BACKGROUND, additional links denoting “argu-
mentative support” are annotated.

Earlier studies 　 (Hachey and Grover, 2006;
Saravanan and Ravindran, 2010) chose the sen-
tence as the annotation unit and defined exclu-
sive labeling, i.e., only one category can be as-
signed to each annotation unit. We also use ex-
clusive labeling, but our definition of the smallest
annotation unit is a comma-separated text unit. In
Japanese, such units typically correspond to lin-
guistic clauses. This decision was necessitated by
the complexity and length of the legal language we
observe, where parts of a single long sentence can
fulfill different rhetorical functions. While annota-
tors are free to label each comma-separated unit in
a sentence separately, they are of course also free
to label the entire sentence if they wish.

3.1 Issue Topic Identification

Our annotators are instructed to indicate the spans
of each Issue Topic in the text, and to assign a

25



unique identifier to each2. Annotators are asked
to find the span that best (“in the most straight-
forward way”) describes the Issue Topic. We ex-
pect this task to be relatively uncontroversial, be-
cause the documents are produced in such a way
that it should be clear what the Issue Topics are
(cf. our discussion in section 2.2).

3.2 Rhetorical Status Classification

Our annotation scheme (Table 1) is an adaptation
of Hachey and Grover’s scheme; we introduce six
labels for rhetorical status and an “OTHER” la-
bel. Two of the labels are retained from Hachey
and Grover: the submission of fact (FACT) and
the citation of law materials (BACKGROUND).
DISPOSAL is redefined as CONCLUSION, in or-
der to capture the conclusion of each Issue Topic.
IDENTIFYING is a label for text that states the
discussion topic. TEXTUAL is dropped in our an-
notation scheme since this label is not relevant to
our summary design.

Our main modification is to split Hachey and
Grover’s FRAMING category into FRAMING-
main and FRAMING-sub, in order to express the
hierarchical argumentation structure discussed in
section 2.1. Apart from the fact that the split
allows us to recover the argument structure, we
found that without the split, the argumentative text
under FRAMING would cover too much text in
our documents. Since our objective is to gener-
ate summaries, having too much material in any
extract-worthy rhetorical role is undesirable.

We also introduce a slightly unusual annota-
tion procedure where annotators are asked to trace
back the legal argument structure of the case.
They first search for the general CONCLUSIONs
of the case. They then find each Issue Topic’s
CONCLUSION; next they find the FRAMING-
main which is supporting. Finally, they look
for the FRAMING-sub elements that support the
FRAMING-main. They will then express the
“support” relationship as FRAMING links (as de-
scribed in section 3.4). Therefore, the annota-
tors simultaneously recover the argument structure
while making decisions about the rhetorical status.

3.3 Issue Topic Linking

Issue Topic linking concerns the relation between
each textual unit and its corresponding Issue

2We later normalize the identifiers for comparison across
annotators.

Topic. Every unit is assigned to the single Issue
Topic ID the annotators recognize it as most re-
lated to. But not all textual material concerns spe-
cific Issue Topics; some text pieces such as the in-
troduction and the final conclusion are predomi-
nantly concerned with the overall trial and judicial
decision. We define a special Issue Topic ID of
value 0 to cover such cases.

3.4 FRAMING Linking

Units labeled with BACKGROUND and
FRAMING-sub can be linked to FRAMING-
main, if the annotator perceives that the
BACKGROUND or FRAMING-sub material
argumentatively supports the statements in
FRAMING-main. The semantics of a link is that
the origin (BACKGROUND and FRAMING-sub)
supports the destination (FRAMING-main).

4 Agreement metrics

Due to the nature of the four annotation tasks we
propose here, different agreement metrics are nec-
essary. While rhetorical status classification can
be evaluated by Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960), all
other tasks require specialized metrics.

4.1 Issue Topic Identification

We perform a comparison of the textual material
annotated as Issue Topic rather than the exact loca-
tion of the material in the texts, as we only care to
know whether annotators agree about the semantic
content of the Issue Topics. We count two spans as
agreed if more than 60% of their characters agree.
The reason why we introduce the 60% overlap rule
is that annotators may differ slightly in how they
annotate a source span even if the principal mean-
ing is the same. This difference often concerns
short and relatively meaningless adverbial modifi-
cation and such at the beginning or end of mean-
ingful units. We manually confirmed that no false
positives occurred by setting this threshold.

However, as annotators may disagree on the
number of Issue Topic they recognize in a text, we
first calculate an agreement ratio for each annota-
tor by equation (1) and average them to give the
overall agreement metric as in equation (2), where
as(i) is the number of spans agreed between an-
notator i and others and spans(i) is the number of
spans annotated by annotator i:

agreement ITI(i) =
as(i)

spans(i)
, (1)

26



agreement ITI =

∑
i agreement ITI(i)

|AnnotatorSet | , (2)

where i ∈ AnnotatorSet .

4.2 Issue Topic Linking
In the case of Issue Topic linking, the destina-
tions of each link are fixed, as each Issue Topic
is uniquely identified by its ID. As far as the
sources of the links are concerned, their numbers
across annotators should be almost the same. They
only differ if the annotators marked different units
as “OTHER” during rhetorical status classifica-
tion, as all units except those marked “OTHER”
are linked to an Issue Topic by definition. We
therefore report an average agreement ratio as in
equation (4) over each annotator agreement given
by equation (3), where au(i) is the number of
units agreed between annotator i and others and
units(i) is the number of units annotated by an-
notator i:

agreement ITL(i) =
au(i)

units(i)
, (3)

agreement ITL =

∑
i agreement ITL(i)

|AnnotatorSet | , (4)

where i ∈ AnnotatorSet .

4.3 FRAMING Linking
FRAMING linking is the most difficult task in
our scheme to evaluate. FRAMING links hold
between either BACKGROUND or FRAMING
text units as the source, and FRAMING-main text
units as the destination. The FRAMING linking
task therefore consists of three parts, the identifi-
cation of source spans, the identification of des-
tination spans, and the determination of the most
appropriate destination for each source span (link-
ing).

The destinations are not uniquely identified in
terms of an ID (as was the case with Issue Topic
linking), but are variable, as the annotators mark
them explicitly in the text using a span.3

First, we measure how well human annotators
can distinguish all categories that participate in
FRAMING linking (CONCLUSION, FRAMING-
main, FRAMING-sub, BACKGROUND and
“anything else”). The degree to which this sub-
division is successful can be expressed by Kappa.

3Note that the source spans are always variable, both in
FRAMING linking and in Issue Topic linking.

This number gives an upper bound of performance
that limits all further FRAMING linking tasks.

We also measure agreement on source spans
for FRAMING linking. We define agreement
as “sharing more than 80% of the span in char-
acters”, and report the number of spans where
this is so, over the entire number of spans, as
agreement src, defined in equation (5). We only
count those spans that are labeled as FRAMING-
sub or BACKGROUND and are linked to some-
where4.

agreementsrc =
# of agreed source spans with link

# of source spans with link
(5)

Finally, we measure agreement on destination
spans that are linked to from source spans. Des-
tination agreement agreementfl is the number of
agreed5 source spans which also have agreed des-
tination spans, over all agreed source spans:

agreementfl =
# of agreed links

# of agreed source spans with link
.

(6)

4.4 Baselines for FRAMING Linking
We implemented strong baselines in order to in-
terpret our results for FRAMING linking. All
baseline models output the linking result for each
annotator, given as input the respective other an-
notator’s source spans that have a link, and their
destination spans. There is no other well-defined
way to give any system options to choose from,
and without these options, the baseline is unable
to operate at all. In our setup, the baseline mod-
els simply simulate the last linking step between
pre-identified source and destination spans, by one
plausible model (namely, the other annotator).

Our three baseline models are called Random,
Popularity and Nearest. The Random model
chooses one destination span for each source span
randomly. The Popularity model operates random
by observed distribution of destinations. The dis-
tribution is calculated using the other annotator’s
data. The Nearest model always chooses the clos-
est following destination candidate span available.
This is motivated by our observation that in legal
arguments, the supporting material often precedes
the conclusion, and is typically adjacent or physi-
cally close.

4Although logically all such spans should be linked to
somewhere, we observed some cases where annotators mis-
takenly forgot to link.

5For the definition of agreement on destination spans, the
80% rule is applied again.

27



5 Annotation experiment

Given the intrinsic subjectivity of text-
interpretative tasks, and the high complexity
of this particular annotation task, achieving
acceptable agreement on our annotation is crucial
for being able to use the annotated material for
the supervised machine learning experiments we
are planning for automating the annotation. We
therefore perform an experiment to measure the
reproducibility of our scheme, consisting of the
4 tasks as described above.

5.1 Annotation procedure

Two annotators were used for the experiment, the
first author of this paper (who has a bachelor of
Laws degree in Japanese Law), and a PhD can-
didate in a graduate school of Japanese Law. It
is necessary to use expert annotators, due to the
special legal language used in the documents. Le-
gal domain texts can be hard to understand for lay
persons, because terms have technical meanings
which differ from the meaning of the terms when
used in everyday language. For example, the terms
“悪意 (aku-i)” and “善意 (zen-i)” (which mean
“maliciousness” 　 and “benevolentness” 　 re-
spectively in everyday language), have a different
meaning in a legal context, where “悪意” means
knowing a fact, and “善意” means not knowing a
fact.

The annotators used the GUI-based annotation
tool Slate (Kaplan et al., 2011). We gave the an-
notators a guideline document of 8 pages detail-
ing the procedure. In it, we instructed the an-
notators to read the target document to under-
stand its general structure and flow of discussion
roughly and to pay particular attention to Issue
Topics, choosing one textual unit for each Issue
Topic. They perform the tasks in the following
order: (1) Issue Topic Identification, (2) Rhetor-
ical Status Classification, (3) FRAMING linking
and (4) Issue Topic linking. As mentioned earlier,
tasks (2) and (3) logically should be performed
simultaneously since the process which identifies
FRAMING-main, FRAMING-sub and BACK-
GROUND is closely connected to the FRAMING
linking task. The annotators were instructed to
perform a final check to verify that each Issue
Topic has at least one rhetorical status. As Issue
Topics tend to have at least one unit for every
rhetorical status, this check often detects slips of
the attention.

We used Japanese Civil Case judgment docu-

available publicly from a Japanese Court website
(http://www.courts.go.jp/). We anno-
tated 8 Japanese civil case judgment documents,
which consist of 9,879 comma-separated units and
201,869 characters in total. The documents are
written by various judges from several courts and
cover the following themes: “Medical negligence
during a health check”, “Threatening behavior in
connection to money lending”, “Use of restrain-
ing devices by police”, “Fence safety and injury”,
“Mandatory retirement from private company”,
“Road safety in a bus travel sub-contract situa-
tion”, “Railway crossing accident”, and “With-
drawal of a company’s garbage license by the
city”.

5.2 Results

5.2.1 Issue Topic Identification
The results for the Issue Topic identification task
are given in Table 2. The overall agreement ratio
observed is 0.787. An error analysis showed that
the two main remaining problems were due to the
splitting of an Issue Topic by one annotator and
not by the other, and a different interpretation of
whether compensation calculations should be an-
notated or not.

5.2.2 Rhetorical Status agreement
Agreement of rhetorical classification was mea-
sured at K=0.70 (N=9879; n=7, k=2; Cohen).
Note that the number of units N (entities assessed)

tuation) separated text pieces, as opposed to sen-
tences in previous work. Table 3 gives the con-
fusion matrix for the Rhetorical Status Classifi-
cation task. Although the Kappa value indicates
good agreement for rhetorical classification over-
all, the confusion matrix shows certain systematic
assignment errors. In particular, FRAMING-main
and FRAMING-sub are relatively often confused,
indicating that our current annotation guidelines
should be improved in this respect.

5.2.3 Issue Topic Linking agreement
The result for Issue Topic linking is shown in Ta-
ble 4. At 0.870, the agreement ratio indicates
good agreement. The annotators seem to have lit-
tle trouble in determining which Issue Topic each
sentence relates to. This is probably due to the
fact that the judgment documents are closely struc-
tured around Issue Topics, as per our working hy-
pothesis. Annotators often arrive the same inter-
pretation because the argument is logically struc-
tured and the components necessary for interpre-
tation can be found nearby, as the strong per-
formance of the Nearest baseline demonstrates.
However, we also noticed an adverse effect con-
cerning Issue Topics. Judges sometimes reorga-
nize the Issue Topics that were previously defined,
for instance, by merging smaller Issue Topics, or
in the case of dependencies between Issue Top-
ics, by dropping dependent Issue Topics when the
Issue Topics they depend on have collapsed during
the trial. Such reorganizations can cause disagree-
ment among annotators.

In sum, the detection of Issue Topic level argu-
ment structure seems to be overall a well-defined
task, judging by the combined results of Issue
Topic Identification and Linking.

5.2.4 FRAMING Linking agreement
Agreement of rhetorical status classification of
text units involved in FRAMING linking was
measured at K=0.69 (N=9879; n=4, k=2) and
source agreement is given in Table 5. The base-
line results are given in Table 6. The Near-

Table 6: FRAMING Linking Baselines

est baseline model shows a rather high score
(agreementfl=0.644) when compared to the hu-
man annotators (agreementfl=0.661). The dis-
tance between source spans and destination spans
clearly influences the FRAMING linking task,
showing a strong preference by the judges for a
regular argumentation structure. We also observe
that the distances involving FRAMING links are
shorter than those for Issue Topics.

Trying to explain the relatively low human
agreement, we performed an error analysis of the
linking errors, classifying the 128 errors made
during FRAMING linking. We distinguish des-
tination spans that show character position over-
lap across annotators, from those that do not.
For those that have overlapping spans, we check
whether this corresponds to shared content in a
meaningful manner. Even for those spans that are
not shared in terms of character positions, content
could still be shared, as the spans could be para-
phrases of each other, so we check this as well.
We found that 26 error links had meaningful over-
lap and 22 error links were reformulations. If we
were to consider “reformulation” and “meaning-
ful overlap” links as agreed, the agreementfl value
would rise to 0.788. This is potentially an encour-
aging result for an upper bound on how much an-
notators naturally agree on FRAMING linking.

Most errors that we categorized as “different
meaning” are caused by non-agreement during the
FRAMING-main identification stage. From this
result, we conclude that improving the instructions
for the identification of FRAMING-main is vital
for the second phase of our annotation work. How-
ever, an interesting result is that even if annotators
disagree on FRAMING-main identification, the

29



non-agreed links still share linking structure. We
observe that often the same set of source spans are
linked to some destination span, although the des-
tination itself is different across annotators. Our
agreement metrics are thus underestimating the
degree of shared linkage structure.

6 Related Work

There is little work on the summarization
of Japanese judgment documents, Banno et al.
(2006) amongst them. They used Support Vec-
tor Machines (Joachims, 1999) to extract impor-
tant sentences for the summarization of Japanese
Supreme Court judgments.

Several past studies share our interest in captur-
ing the argumentation with rhetorical schemes.

Mochales and Moens (2011) presented an ar-
gumentation detection algorithm using state-of-
the-art machine learning techniques. They an-
notated documents from the European Court of
Human Rights (ECHR) and the Araucaria cor-
pus for argumentation detection, achieving inter-
annotator agreement of K=0.75 in Cohen’s Kappa
(ECHR). On a genre other than legal text, Faulkner
(2014) annotated student essays using three tags
(“for”, “against” and “neither”), reaching inter-
annotator agreement of K=0.70 (Cohen). As far
as the rhetorical status classification part of our
scheme is concerned, the closest approach to ours
is Al Khatib et al. (2016), but they do not employ
any explicit links, and they work on a different
genre (news editorials).

A task related to our linking steps is the de-
termination of relations between argument com-
ponents. Stab and Gurevych (2014) annotated
argumentative relations (support and attack) in
essays; they reported inter-annotator agreement
of K=0.81 (Fleiss) for both support and at-
tack. Hua and Wang (2017) proposed an annota-
tion scheme for labeling sentence-level support-
ing arguments relations with four types (STUDY,
FACTUAL, OPINION, REASONING). Their re-
sults for argument type classification are as fol-
lows: K=0.61 for STUDY, K=0.75 for FACTUAL,
K=0.71 for OPINION, and K=0.29 for REASON-
ING.

However, these two relation-based studies dis-
cover only one aspect of argument structure,
whereas our combination of linking tasks and a
rhetorical status classification task means that we
address the global hierarchical argument structure

of a text.
There has also been some recent work on agree-

ment metrics for argument relations. As far as
agreement on detection of argumentative compo-
nents is concerned, Kirschner et al. (2015) point
out that measures such as kappa and F1 score may
cause some inappropriate penalty for slight differ-
ences of annotation between annotators, and pro-
posed a graph-based metric based on pair-wise
comparison of predefined argument components.
This particular metric, while addressing some of
the problems of kappa and F1, is not directly ap-
plicable to our annotation where annotators can
freely chose the beginnings and ends of spans.
Duthie et al. (2007) introduce CASS, a further,
very recent adaptation of the metric by Kirschner
et al. that can deal with disagreement in segmenta-
tion. However, the only available implementation
is based on the AIF format.

7 Discussion and future work

It is hard to evaluate a newly defined, complex task
involving argumentation and judgment. The task
we presented here captures much of the informa-
tion contained in legal judgment documents, but
due to its inherent complexity, many different as-
pects have to be considered to see the entire pic-
ture. Our annotation experiment showed particu-
larly good agreement for the rhetorical status la-
beling task, suggesting that our adaptation to the
Japanese legal system was successful. The agree-
ment on Issue Topic Identification and linking was
also high. In contrast, the FRAMING linking,
which annotators disagreed on to a higher degree
than in the other tasks, suffered from the difficulty
of identifying destination spans in particular. We
can improve the agreement of the FRAMING link-
ing task by refining our guidelines. Moreover, in
order to achieve our final goal of building a flexi-
ble legal summarizer, we plan to analyze the re-
lationship between human generated summaries
and annotated documents on rhetorical status and
links.

The next stage of our work is to increase the
amount of annotation material for the automatic
annotation of judgment documents with the pro-
posed scheme. We will automate the annotation
for the rhetorical status classification task with su-
pervised machine learning and extend the automa-
tion step by step to linking tasks, based on the re-
sult of the rhetorical status classification.
