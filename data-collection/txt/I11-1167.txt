Abstract

In this study, we analyzed how answerers
indicated unclear points in questions, and
how questioners modified and resubmitted
their questions based on indications of un-
clear points.

1 Introduction

In these days, many of us use question and answer
(Q&A) sites where we share our problems and get
solutions of them. For example, about 3.11 million
questions were submitted to Yahoo! chiebukuro 1

from April/2004 to October/2005. Because of this
large numbers of questions, questioners had better
submit questions which give enough information to
answerers. However, it is difficult to make good
questions. For example, in Yahoo! chiebukuro, we
often found unclear questions (e.g. Q1 in Figure
1) and their answers where answerers indicated un-
clear points of the questions (e.g. A1 in Figure 1).

(Q 1) I cannot access a web page which I could
read yesterday. What should I do?

(A 1) Show URL.

In (A 1), the answerer pointed out that the ques-
tioner did not describe important information to an-
swer the question: URL. Unclear questions may de-
crease chances of getting good answers. As a result,
it is important to investigate supporting methods of
making clear questions. One idea is to indicate un-
clear points of questions, as the questioner of (A 1)
did. In order to obtain helpful knowledge and de-
velop a help system for making clear questions, it
is important to analyze

• how answerers indicated unclear points in
questions, and

• how questioners modified and resubmitted
their questions based on indications of unclear
points in their original questions.

based on the indication of unclear points in the orig-
inal question.

Our approach differs from previous analyses on Ya-
hoo! Answers (Su et al., 2007) (Adamic et al.,
2008). In this study, we used the data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro for observation and examination. The
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro was published by Ya-
hoo! JAPAN via National Institute of Informatics
in 2007 2. This data consists of about 3.11 million
questions and 13.47 million answers which were
posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro from April/2004 to
October/2005.

2 Types of indication of unclear points in
questions and modification of questions

2.1 Types of indication of unclear points in
questions

We observed answers submitted to PC category of
Yahoo! chiebukuro and found the following five
types of indication of unclear points in questions
(Table 1).

TYPE (A1-1) Answerers wanted detailed ac-
counts of what questioners did.

(Q 2) I got a warning from Symantec. How do I
extend the software license.

(A 2) Did you buy an extension key?

Table 1: Types of indication of unclear points in
questions

TYPE indication of unclear points in questions
A1-1 detailed accounts of what questioners did
A1-2 detailed accounts of what happened
A1-3 detailed accounts of conditions
A1-4 information other than (A1-1), (A1-2),

and (A1-3)
A1-5 unhelpful solution

TYPE (A1-2) Answerers wanted detailed ac-
counts of what happened.

(Q 3) When I try to maximize my IE window, it is
positioned about 2cm below from the top of
the screen! What should I do?

(A 3) What’s there? blank?

TYPE (A1-3) Answerers wanted detailed ac-
counts of conditions. For example, the indication
of (A 1) is classified into this type.

TYPE (A1-4) Answerers wanted detailed ac-
counts of information which were not asked in an-
swers of TYPE (A1-1), (A1-2), and (A1-3).

(Q 4) I don’t know the connection type. What
should I do?

(A 4) Which connection type do you want to
know?

TYPE (A1-5) Answerers submitted solutions,
however, they were not helpful to solve question-
ers’ problems. In these cases, answerers did not
indicate unclear points of questions. However, we
think these unhelpful solutions are one type of in-
dication of unclear points of questions. This is be-
cause these unhelpful solutions often made ques-
tioners aware of unclear points of their questions.
For example, the answerer of (A 5) showed one so-
lution with detailed instruction. The questioner of
(Q 5) tried to solve his/her problem according to the
instruction and found the solution was unhelpful.

(Q 5) Windows XP crashed. How do I boot my
computer?

(A 5) Just put a recovery disc into CD/DVD drive.
And restart your PC.

(Q 6) Windows XP crashed. I put a recovery disc
into CD drive, but my PC didn’t work. How
do I boot my computer?

Table 2: Types of modification of questions based
on indication of unclear points

TYPE modification of questions
Q2-1 added explanation based on the indication
Q2-2 added explanation based on other informa-

tion
Q2-3 described the solution was unhelpful
Q2-4 asked about unknowns in the indication
Q2-5 resubmitted in disregard of the indication

2.2 Types of modification of questions
We observed resubmitted questions in PC category
of Yahoo! chiebukuro and found the following five
types of modification of questions (Table 2).

TYPE (Q2-1) Questioners added explanations
based on the indications of unclear points to their
questions and resubmitted them. In this type, it is
likely that answerers asked about what questioners
knew or could find out easily.

(Q 7) How do I reset my iMac to default settings,
except IE and Outlook settings.

(A 7) Show the versions of OS, IE, and Outlook
Express.

(Q 8) How do I reset my iMac to default settings,
except IE and Outlook settings. My mac OS is
version 9 and both IE and Outlook are version
5.

TYPE (Q2-2) Questioners added explanations
based on information other than the indications to
their questions and resubmitted them. In this type,
it is also likely that answerers asked about what
questioners knew or could find out easily.

(Q 9) Can I boot my XP PC with Windows 98
HDD?

(A 9) Did you install 98 first? You cannot boot
your PC by using Windows 98 if your primary
OS is XP.

(Q 10) Can I boot my XP PC with Windows 98
HDD? I don’t want to set up a dual boot sys-
tem. I want to know my PC gets in trouble
when I boot it with Win 98 HDD.

TYPE (Q2-3) In resubmitted questions, ques-
tioners described that solutions received from an-
swerers were unhelpful to solve their questions. For
example, in (Q 6), the questioner described the so-
lution received from the answerer of (A 5) was un-
helpful to solve his/her problem. In this type, it

1429



is likely that answerers showed one solution which
questioners did not know.

TYPE (Q2-4) In resubmitted questions, ques-
tioners asked about unknown points in the indi-
cation received from answerers. For example, the
questioner of (Q 11) received one solution and got
the key to solve his/her problem: module deletion.
However, he/she did not know it and submitted (Q
12) for requesting detailed information about it.

(Q 11) I removed all macros from my excel file.
Then, whenever I open the file, excel asks me
if I want to enable/disable macros. How do I
stop it?

(A 11) Open visual basic editor and delete the
module.

(Q 12) I removed all macros from my excel file.
Then, whenever I open the file, excel asks me
if I want to enable/disable macros. I want to
stop it. The module should be deleted by using
visual basic editor. But, how do I do it?

TYPE (Q2-5) Questioners resubmitted almost
the same questions as they had. They did not men-
tioned any kinds of information received from an-
swerers. For example, in (Q 14), the questioner did
not mention any kinds of information described in
(A 14) although he/she selected (A 14) as a best
answer.

(Q 13) My optical mouse is faulty. The cursor
sometimes freezes. Is it end of life?

(A 13) Look the back side and remove dust gath-
ered around the red light.

(Q 14) My optical mouse is faulty. The cursor
sometimes freezes. Is it end of life?

3 Extraction of original and resubmitted
questions and their answers from
Yahoo! chiebukuro

We intended to extract

• original questions which included unclear
points (e.g. Q1 in Figure 1),

• answers which indicated unclear points in the
original questions (e.g. A1 in Figure 1),

• resubmitted questions based on the indications
of unclear points in the original questions (e.g.
Q2 in Figure 1), and

• answers to the resubmitted questions

from PC category of Yahoo! chiebukuro in the next
way.

step 1 extract an answer which indicated unclear
points in a question (e.g. A1 in Figure 1). This
kind of answer can be extracted by using a
method based on machine learning techniques
(Isogai et al., 2009).

step 2 extract the question which had the answer
extracted in step 1 (e.g. Q1 in Figure 1). This
question is regarded as an original question.

step 3 extract the first question submitted by the
questioner after he/she received the answer ex-
tracted in step 1.

step 4 examine whether the questions extracted in
step 1 and step 3 met one of the following con-
ditions:

• they shared more than 10 content words
when both of them consisted of more
than 20 content words, or

• they shared more than 5 content words.

When one of the conditions was satisfied, the
question extracted in step 3 is regarded as a
resubmitted question (e.g. Q2 in Figure 1).

step 5 extract the answers to the resubmitted ques-
tion extracted in step 4 (e.g. A2 in Figure 1).

4 Experimental results

We applied our method described in section 3 to
171848 questions and 474687 answers which were
submitted to PC category of Yahoo! chiebukuro
from April/2004 to October/2005, and extracted
4271 cases of questions and their answers. Among
them, we selected 200 cases randomly and found
133 cases of them where

• an original question (e.g. Q1 in Figure 1),

• the answer which indicated unclear points in
the original questions (e.g. A1 in Figure 1),

• the resubmitted questions based on the indica-
tion of unclear points in the original questions
(e.g. Q2 in Figure 1), and

• the answers to the resubmitted questions (e.g.
A2 in Figure 1)

were extracted adequately. We observed these 133
cases and show

Table 3: The results of the analyses: (1) how an-
swerers indicated unclear points in original ques-
tions (A1-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), (2) how questioners uti-
lized indications in answers when they resubmitted
their questions (Q2-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The numbers
in parentheses are the numbers of best answers.

(a) 122 cases where questioners obtained good answers.

1. whether questioners obtained good solutions
or useful clues by resubmitting their ques-
tions, especially, when they added explana-
tions based on indications to their questions.

2. how answerers indicated unclear points in
questions.

3. whether questioners gave good evaluations to
answerers who indicated unclear points of
their questions.

4. how questioners utilized indications of unclear
points of their original questions when they re-
submitted their questions.

Table 3 shows the results of these analyses.
First, we examined whether questioners obtained

good solutions or useful clues by resubmitting their
questions. As shown in Table 3, there were 26 cases
where questioners resubmitted TYPE (Q2-5) ques-
tions (questions resubmitted in disregard of indica-
tions), and then, 16 of these 26 cases where ques-
tioners obtained good solutions or useful clues. On
the other hand, there were 107 cases where ques-
tioners resubmitted TYPE (Q2-1), (Q2-2), (Q2-
3), and (Q2-4) questions, in other words, they ac-
cepted indications from answerers and modified
their questions. Then, there were 106 of these 107
cases where questioners obtained good solutions or
useful clues. As a result, questioners can increase
their chances to obtain good solutions or useful
clues when they accepted indications from answer-
ers and modified their questions.

Secondly, we examined how answerers indicated
unclear points in questions. As shown in Table 3,
TYPE (A1-5) answer (unhelpful solution) was the
most common answer. As a result, questioners had
chances to recognize unclear points in their ques-
tions even if they received unhelpful solutions.

Thirdly, we examined whether questioners gave
good evaluations to answerers who indicated un-
clear points of their questions. As shown in Ta-
ble 3, there were 112 cases (84%) where ques-
tioners gave good evaluations to answerers who in-
dicated unclear points of their questions. On the
other hand, in PC category of Yahoo! chiebukuro,
474687 answers were submitted and 171848 of
them (36%) were received good evaluations. As
a result, many questioners gave good evaluations
to answerers who indicated unclear points of their
questions.

Finally, we examined how questioners utilized
indications of unclear points of their original ques-
tions when they resubmitted their questions. In this
experiment, there were 107 cases where question-
ers resubmitted TYPE (Q2-1), (Q2-2), (Q2-3), and
(Q2-4) questions, in other words, they accepted in-
dications from answerers and modified their ques-
tions. Then, there were 17 of these 107 cases where
questioners resubmitted TYPE (Q2-4) questions, in
other words, they had unknown points in indica-
tions received from answerers and needed to ask
about what they were. In other 90 cases, question-
ers resubmitted TYPE (Q2-1), (Q2-2), and (Q2-3)
questions, in other words, they knew or could find
out easily what answerers indicated. As a result,
just to indicate unclear points in questions is useful
to make good questions.
