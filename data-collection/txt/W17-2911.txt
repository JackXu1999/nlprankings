Abstract

Code-switching has been found to have
social motivations in addition to syntactic
constraints. In this work, we explore the
social effect of code-switching in an on-
line community. We present a task from
the Arabic Wikipedia to capture language
choice, in this case code-switching be-
tween Arabic and other languages, as a
predictor of social influence in collabora-
tive editing. We find that code-switching is
positively associated with Wikipedia edi-
tor success, particularly borrowing techni-
cal language on pages with topics less di-
rectly related to Arabic-speaking regions.

1 Introduction

Code-switching, mixing words from multiple lan-
guages in conversation, is common in multilingual
communities. This phenomenon has been studied
by linguists for nearly half a century (Auer, 2013),
and syntactic models of code-switching are still in
development (Gardner-Chloros, 2009).

Alternating between languages can also be con-
sidered a conversational act with communicative
function (Auer, 2013). Code-switching has been
found to convey social and interactional meaning
in a variety of contexts (Alvarez-Cáccamo, 1990;
Blom and Gumperz, 1972; Bassiouney, 2006),
though its role in online communities has largely
been unexplored. Studying the relationship be-
tween social variables and code-switching (CS)
can give insight into the role of CS as a pragmatic
tool of multilingual speakers.

We offer a quantitative look at how CS func-
tions as a sociolinguistic choice in the editing
community around the Arabic Wikipedia, an on-
line encyclopedia which anyone can edit. Our fo-
cus is on talk pages, where Wikipedia editors dis-

cuss article improvements, coordinate work and
resolve disagreements on the content they edit
(Ferschke, 2014). Relationships between linguis-
tic and social meanings are indirect and difficult to
operationalize (Nguyen et al., 2016; Ochs, 1992),
but Wikipedia offers an opportunity to quantify so-
cial influence in the collaborative task of editing
articles. We use code-switching features from edi-
tors’ talk page contributions to predict the propor-
tion of those users’ edits that have lasting impact
on the article, a measure of social influence.

We formulate three hypotheses about the so-
cial effect of CS on Arabic Wikipedia talk pages.
Though other hypotheses are possible, these three
are motivated by the sociolinguistic concept of
markedness (Myers-Scotton, 1998), which at-
taches social meaning to talk that deviates from
conversational expectations. We use markedness
as a theoretical lens to assess community norms
and social value placed on language choices on
Arabic Wikipedia talk pages.

Hypothesis 1. Code-switching may function
without clear social meaning (Auer, 2013) and
simply be the accepted norm on Arabic Wikipedia
talk pages. This could mean that users do not es-
pecially notice code-switching or that it is noticed
but has no clear effect.

Hypothesis 2. Code-switching marks a
Wikipedia user as an outsider who does not
follow the Arabic conversational norm (Myers-
Scotton, 1998). Code-switching has a negative
effect on an editor’s acceptance.

Hypothesis 3. Languages other than Arabic,
such as English, may carry some sort of value
in certain settings (Safi-Stagni, 1991). Code-
switching could demonstrate a level of expertise
or world knowledge and have a positive effect on
the acceptance of an editor’s contributions.

73



To determine which of these hypotheses is a
more likely explanation for CS in this context, we
construct a publicly released dataset that pairs dis-
cussion between Wikipedia editors with a measure
of editor success in article edits.

We find a positive correlation between the pres-
ence of CS in the discussion and editor success,
which supports Hypothesis 3. CS features also im-
prove a linear regression model over a reasonable
unigram baseline in predicting editor success.

An analysis of an annotated sample of our
dataset suggests the possible value the Arabic
Wikipedia editing community places on CS for
technical language on articles unrelated to Arabic
history, people, and culture.

2 Related Work

Code-switching was first linguistically studied to
find systems of syntactic and morphological con-
straints on its use. Myers-Scotton (1995) proposed
a CS framework in which grammatical structure is
supplied by a dominant “matrix” language, while
content morphemes can be drawn from an “em-
bedded” language (Bassiouney, 2009). In con-
trast, MacSwan (2000) argues against the exis-
tence of nearly any universal syntactic constraints
on CS.

Sociolinguists take interest in CS as a property
of language related to social interaction. Gumperz
(1982) proposes a distinction between CS based
on factors internal to a conversation and on con-
notations a language carries across contexts.

We frame our understanding of the social ef-
fect of CS on markedness theory, which posits
that marked linguistic choices deviate from un-
derstood norms for speakers in certain situations
and thus carry social significance (Myers-Scotton,
1998). This emphasis on conversational norms is
rooted in Grice’s maxims, which give guidelines
for expectations in conversation and a framework
for social meaning attached to deviations from
those norms (Grice, 1975). Note that we are not
attempting to prove or disprove markedness the-
ory or Grice’s maxims, but instead are using them
to understand meaning in interaction and to more
fully explain natural language data.

We assume a community norm of Arabic on the
Arabic Wikipedia and expect CS to be marked and
have some sort of social effect. However, Myers-
Scotton (1998) allows the possibility of contexts
where CS is itself unmarked; this would also be

possible in our case.
Recent computational analyses of style,

metaphor, framing and politeness have investi-
gated how language is used to achieve social goals
in online communities (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al., 2012, 2013; Jang et al., 2016; Tsur et al.,
2015). We examine CS in a similar fashion.
Interactional, discourse-level features are context-
specific, and the relationship between social and
linguistic features is fluid and often difficult to
computationalize (Nguyen et al., 2016). Code-
switching may not carry clear social meaning at
all in a given context (Auer, 2013), much less a
predictable signal. Our work enters this conversa-
tion by exploring the effect of code-switching on
social influence in an online community.

The NLP community has largely studied code-
switching apart from its social context. Much
work has focused on word-level CS language iden-
tification, encouraged by shared tasks (Solorio
et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2016). Others have
worked to predict code-switch points from pre-
ceding text. Solorio and Liu (2008) predict code-
switch points with features including the previous
n-grams’ identified language, POS tag, and loca-
tion in constituent parses in both languages. Pier-
gallini et al. (2016) tackle the same task in combi-
nation with language identification on a Swahili-
English online forum dataset. They note the possi-
bility of using discourse structure and social vari-
ables for predicting code-switch points.

Interest in computational models of the so-
cial and pragmatic nature of code-switching is
growing. Begum et al. (2016) present an an-
notation scheme for the pragmatic functions of
Hindi-English code-switched tweets, which in-
cludes reinforcement, sarcasm, reported speech,
and changes from narration to evaluation. Rudra
et al. (2016) study language preference for the ex-
pression of sentiment among Hindi-English mul-
tilinguals, finding that speakers more commonly
use Hindi to express negative sentiment and En-
glish for positive sentiment on Twitter.

3 Code-Switching on Arabic Wikipedia
Talk Pages

Though many language Wikipedias contain code-
switching on their talk pages, we select the Arabic
Wikipedia for the variation we observe and previ-
ous Arabic CS work in NLP (Solorio et al., 2014;
Elfardy et al., 2014).

Table 1: Observations of non-Arabic text in Arabic Wikipedia talk pages

Terms and definitions for code-switching
and code-mixing across studies vary consider-
ably (Gardner-Chloros, 2009). Since we are inter-
ested in all deviation from the likely norm of Ara-
bic, we accept any instances of switching between
languages in a conversation as code-switching.
We also include “script-switching”, since we as-
sume most editors can use Arabic characters and
there may be social significance attached to writ-
ing Arabic in Latin script (something called Ara-
bizi), especially since such language is usually di-
alectal (Darwish, 2014).

Table 1 presents a few motivating examples of
language variety in Arabic Wikipedia talk pages.
Most CS we see is Arabic-English, but there are
examples of French and Arabizi, the romanized
Arabic seen in the third example in Table 1.

We also note apologies for using English, in-
cluding a longer exchange on the Israel talk page
where an editor is confronted about language
choice and replies in Arabizi:

Editor 1: ...downright erasure of Jewish
history in Israel. I don’t have an arabic
keyboard so i can’t type in arabic

Editor 2: you dont seem to be able to
read arabic, or you havent read the arti-
cle and the history section!!

Editor 1: wala ya habibi? maa ta’mil
assumptions, ana bahki arabi,wa baqrah
arabi (trans. Hey, don’t make assump-
tions, I speak Arabic, and read Arabic)

This example suggests that choice of language
explicitly matters in some Wikipedia talk page
contexts. Editor 1 feels compelled to explain why
they are not typing in Arabic, an acknowledgment
of the community norm of offering contributions
in Arabic. In the second speaker’s reply, not using

Arabic is leveled as grounds for not being a re-
sponsible editor. If Editor 1 is not successful, this
interaction suggests Hypothesis 2, where not using
Arabic negatively marks an editor as an outsider.
Editor 1’s response in Arabizi is another language
choice with social implications, especially that it
is in Levantine Arabic dialect and not in Modern
Standard Arabic like the article.

Does this demonstrate enough knowledge of
Arabic for status as a contributor? What social ef-
fect does writing in English on the talk page have
when Arabic is an assumed norm? What effects do
other multilingual choices have in other contexts?
These questions motivate our study.

4 Data and Task

To capture the social effect of code-switching, we
choose a task predicting social influence from CS
features in discussion. In the context of the Arabic
Wikipedia, we measure social success by the pro-
portion of a Wikipedia user’s edits that remain in
the article’s content after a discussion ends (Pried-
horsky et al., 2007) and hypothesize that CS may
be associated with this measure.

To set up this task, we pair discussions contain-
ing CS from Arabic to other languages with si-
multaneous article edits, which we use to define
individual editor success. Our dataset1 consists of
5259 instances in which an editor interacts with
other editors in a talk page discussion thread and
achieves some degree of influence on the associ-
ated article page. Statistics for our dataset can be
seen in Table 2; a more detailed description of the
dataset construction follows.

4.1 Dataset Construction

Each Wikipedia article has an associated talk page,
though many are empty. We begin with all talk
pages and article revisions (versions) in the Arabic
Wikipedia from a 10 October 2016 data dump.

We use the Java Wikipedia Library (Ferschke
et al., 2011) to remove much of the Mediawiki
markup on article revisions, and segment the talk
pages into posts using talk page revision history
and paragraph breaks. Posts under the same head-
ing are organized into discussion threads.

There must be sufficient interaction on a talk
page thread to measure social effect, so we remove
threads with only one participant. To identify CS,
we further restrict threads to contain at least one
post with at least 3 words with all Latin charac-
ters. This filtering leaves 2103 threads remaining
out of the original 10,116 (20.8%). Note that the
majority of text within these threads are in Arabic,
but at least one post within the thread has CS.

In our dataset, we organize each instance as
a specific editor’s concatenated text in the entire
thread (all their posts), along with the combination
of all other editors’ text as separate features.

4.2 Language Identification

We find a diversity of language on Arabic
Wikipedia talk pages not written in the Arabic
script, including English, French, Hebrew, Turk-
ish, Chinese and even a few words written in the
Tifinagh and Syriac scripts.

To initially survey the distribution of languages,
we run all spans of tokens without Arabic charac-
ters (and that are not wholly punctuation) through
langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012), a language
identification tool that can detect 97 languages. It
is trained in a supervised fashion with Naive Bayes
on byte n-grams, using cross-domain training data.
langid.py finds 66 languages present within
the dataset, but a qualitative analysis finds that
named entities and noise in the dataset (special
characters, usernames that passed through our pre-

processing, and Wikipedia-specific material) con-
fuse the language identifier.

This qualitative analysis and our later annota-
tion of a sample finds that the vast majority (esti-
mated 94%) of CS is to English, with some scat-
tered French, Hebrew and other languages.

4.3 Editor Success Scores
Following the example of Priedhorsky et al.
(2007), we assess the impact of editors based on
the longevity of the edits they make. We define a
success score s for each editor in a specific discus-
sion. This score is the proportion of their edits–
words deleted and words added–that remain 1 day
after the discussion ends. Note that this score only
reflects changes in word frequencies, and does not
take word re-ordering into account.

Formally, we consider each edit e as a vector
of word frequency changes, both positive (addi-
tions) and negative (deletions) for each word type.
For an example in English, an edit that changed
one instance of suggested to insinuated, as well
as adding old might be represented as a set {’sug-
gested’: -1, ’insinuated’: +1, ’old’: +1’}. Let
vector c be the changes in word frequencies from
that edit to the final revision in the session. This
change vector represents how many tokens that an
editor deleted were put back and how many to-
kens the editor added were afterward deleted. Let
||e|| be the sum of the absolute values of word fre-
quency changes of the edit and ||c|| be the sum
of the absolute values of word frequency changes
from the edit to the final revision. The score s of
a particular Wikipedia editor u in thread t across
edits {e1, e2, ..., en} made by that editor in that
thread is:

s(u, t) = 1−
∑n

i=1 ||ci||∑n
i=1 ||ei||

Each editor’s score is the proportion of tokens
they changed that remain changed, so s ∈ [0, 1].

In a qualitative evaluation, this editor score for-
mulation was found to accurately reflect an edi-
tor’s impact on the revision of the article after the
discussion.

5 Experiments and Results

Our goal is capturing the relationship between CS
on talk pages and the success of editors on article
pages. We consider the presence of CS in an edi-
tor’s text, as well as other CS features to study the
variation among types of CS (section 5.1).

76



We evaluate the effect of CS features on editor
score in two ways. We first evaluate the associa-
tion between CS and editor success with statistical
measures (section 5.2). Then, we test the strength
of this association by using CS features in a pre-
dictive model of editor success (section 5.3).

5.1 Features
We select code-switching features that we expect
to vary in deviation from a community expectation
of Arabic, a concept motivated by markedness the-
ory (Myers-Scotton, 1998). Each datapoint sep-
arates the text contributed by one specific editor
in a thread from all other text in the thread, and
features (listed below) are extracted from both the
editor’s and all other editors’ text. We examine
Latin characters in particular since non-Latin and
non-Arabic scripts are negligible in the corpus,
and restricting to Latin characters reduces noise
from nonlinguistic symbols and rare punctuation
that otherwise are detected.

• Presence of CS: whether the text contains
non-Arabic content, operationalized as three
or more tokens longer than one character in
all Latin characters.

• Proportion of non-Arabic words: the pro-
portion of non-Arabic content, operational-
ized as the proportion of words in all Latin
characters.

• Proportion of code-switch points. To cap-
ture how frequently an editor switches lan-
guages, each word boundary is counted as a
potential code-switch point from Arabic to
another language or vice versa. This fea-
ture is the number of actual switch points be-
tween languages, normalized by the number
of word boundaries.

• Presence of CS and quotes. We naively
capture quoting in non-Arabic languages by
determining if there are more than three
words in all Latin characters and two double-
quotation (") marks.

• Proportion of non-Arabic named entities.
Named entities written in scripts other than
Arabic are quite frequent in our dataset and
may carry less social significance than other
types of CS. We operationalize this feature as
the proportion of words in all Latin characters
that are capitalized.

• Apologies. We are particularly interested in
apologizing for using a language other than
Arabic, as this recognizes deviation from an
Arabic community norm. We naively assume
that any apology is likely to be about lan-
guage use, and so extract use of the word
sorry or any version of the lemma apolog.
However, there are too few examples of this
feature even in English, the most frequent
non-Arabic language used, to meaningfully
compare its relation to editor score.

• Presence of specific languages. We extract
separate features for the presence of spe-
cific languages automatically identified with
langid.py (see section 4.2), as well as the
proportion of all words that are identified as
that specific language. Most likely due to
noise in automatic identification and the over-
whelming presence of English, these features
do not improve regression performance or re-
late in statistically significant ways to editor
success, so we do not consider them further.

We also separately consider unigrams longer
than 1 letter that are completely in Arabic script
or completely in Latin characters.

As nonlinguistic features, we include the num-
ber of editor turns and other turns. Both were
found to have very weak negative correlation with
editor success and were not considered further.

Note that named entities and full sentences in
non-Arabic characters are included in our CS fea-
tures. Since we want to explore as many possi-
ble effects as possible, our aim is to broadly cap-
ture any use of terms outside of an assumed Arabic
norm. Thus our definition of “code-switching” is
loose, including what may simply be considered
borrowing words or writing a talk page post all in
one language in a conversation that includes mul-
tiple languages.

5.2 Statistical Evaluation

In order to evaluate the relationship between CS
and social influence, we use statistical tests of as-
sociation between CS features and the editor suc-
cess score. For binary features, we simply mea-
sure the difference in editor score means between
instances for which a feature is TRUE and in-
stances where a features is FALSE. For continu-
ous features, we measure the correlation between
that feature and the editor score.

77



Figure 1: Editor score distributions of instances
with and without CS in the editor’s text. The dif-
ference between means is significant p < 0.01.

We find a positive association between the pres-
ence of CS and editor success. The presence of CS
has a significantly positive effect on editor score,
a mean score of 0.628 with CS and 0.593 without
(p < 0.01 using student’s t-test). Distributions for
the presence of CS in editor text are in Figure 1.
Hypothesis 1, the possibility of no social influ-
ence, is unlikely given this statistical evidence of
effect on editor success, and instead, Hypothesis
3’s claim of a positive social effect is supported.

The presence of CS with quotes also has a
marginally significant positive effect on editor
score. The mean score of instances with CS and
quotes was 0.637 and 0.596 without (p ≈ 0.03).

The strongest correlation among continuous
features is the proportion of switches, which still
only weakly correlates with editor success, r =
0.058 (p < 0.0001).

5.3 Predictive Modeling

We also use editor score as an outcome variable
for a linear regression classifier, which we evaluate
using 10-fold cross-validation in scikit-learn (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011). Support vector machine re-
gression yields similar trends.

CS features are more predictive of editor scores
than unigrams with feature selection and tf-idf
weight (1000 features, selected by mutual infor-
mation). Results for the classifier are described in
Table 3, reporting root mean squared error.

Performance decreases with unigrams and CS
features from the text of discussion participants
other than the scored editor (editor+other vs.

editor-only), so only the editor’s code-switching
has an effect.

The most informative CS feature for the lin-
ear regression classifier is the proportion of code-
switch points, while the CS features are included
in the top 10 most informative features for the un-
igrams+CS feature set.

In a further experiment, we aggressively select
unigram features with tf-idf weight based on mu-
tual information down to just 10. This restricted
group of unigram features reaches the prediction
performance of CS features (RMSE of 0.315).
However, the unigram features are difficult to in-
terpret; it is unclear why they index social influ-
ence (Table 4). The focus of this paper is to evalu-
ate the relationship of CS to a measure of social in-
fluence; we leave model development toward bet-
ter prediction performance to future work.

We also examine the effect of Arabic unigrams
(top 1000 features selected) and Latin unigrams
(no feature selection). The performance of Arabic
unigrams matches that of all unigrams, but Latin
unigrams perform significantly better. This rein-
forces language choice as relevant to social influ-
ence in this context.

6 Discussion

The social influence of CS may depend on con-
text, and we examine different types of CS and
variation in article topic as reasonable influencing
factors. We randomly sample 100 instances of the

6.1 CS Type
The annotator (one of the authors) noted the lan-
guage of CS as well as the possible reasons why
CS was used in those instances, using the annota-
tion framework by Begum et al. (2016) as a refer-
ence for structural and semantic functions of CS.

The distribution of these CS types are listed in
Table 5. Most prominently, the dataset contains
a significant percentage of instances with named
entities written in non-Arabic script. These in-
stances include both Western and Arabic names.
For example, Howard Stern or Ibn an-Nafı̄s. It is
interesting that several named entities are written
in Latin script within a large conversation in Ara-
bic, even though names are often freely transliter-
ated over scripts. This could be because certain
names are more familiar in their Latin form (like

CNN).
Using English technical terms is also com-

monly seen when Wikipedia articles of a technical
nature are discussed (Cytoplasm and vertebrates,
for instance). These are examples of topic-related
CS (Barredo, 1997; Begum et al., 2016). Such
code-switched technical words are likely used
when there is no commonly used Arabic equiv-
alent. We see a high mean editor success score
when technical terms are code-switched. Most
of the instances in which this CS type occurred
were threads about articles not specific to Arabic-
speaking regions and came from topics like sci-
ence or world history. The strong editor success is
in support of Hypothesis 3, which suggests that de-
flection from the norm of Arabic might be useful
in particular scenarios, non-Arabic-specific tech-
nical topics in this case.

We also see instances of the quotation func-
tion and the translation function of CS (Begum
et al., 2016). The former occurs primarily when
the discussion involves quoting parts of the corre-
sponding English Wikipedia page or relevant En-
glish news articles and the latter translates Ara-
bic words and phrases to another language. In the
Wikipedia context, these functions likely serve to
ease explanation of article content edits, and com-
plement the discussion which is predominantly in
Arabic.

More specific to Wikipedia is the challenge CS
type. These are instances where, within Arabic
text, phrases in non-Arabic languages are used to
debate or contest the content edits being discussed.
For example, there may be some errors that need
to be addressed and the image is wrong. Some
of these instances are in the Narrative-Evaluative
form of CS, which contains a language-switch be-
tween stating the fact (the suggested content edit
in our case) and an opinion about the fact (Begum
et al., 2016).

non-Arabic words and phrases account for around
16% of the annotated sample. These generally
consist of common English words like had been
good and sorry, similar to the tag-switching struc-
tural form (Begum et al., 2016).

Although CS with English is far more promi-
nent than other languages (94% of the instances),
we also see French, Hebrew and Arabizi used in
the dataset. The ‘Other’ instances in Table 5 refer
to CS that did not have an interpretable function
(Wikipedia-specific terms, for instance).

6.2 Article Topic

We used DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2014) to get
Wikipedia categories for each article. For our se-
lected sample of 100 instances, the annotator ver-
ified these categories and judged whether the ar-
ticle was of a technical subject or not, as well as
whether the article was centered around content
from Arabic-speaking regions. Articles on gen-
eral topics or topics not specifically related to Ara-
bic history, language and culture were annotated
as ‘non-Arabic’.

CS on pages about non-Arabic topics is on aver-
age much more successful than on Arabic-related
topics (Table 6). CS on pages with a technical
subject is also more successful on average than on
pages with other topics.

These findings are supported by a qualitative
analysis of example Arabic-English discussion
contributions with CS. Using medical terms in En-
glish on talk pages for articles on Endorphin and
Cancer was associated with success, as was using
English technical terms on the talk page for Cy-
bernetics (see Table 7).

However, unsuccessful editors who switch to

English seem to do so on pages whose subjects are
more directly related to Western Asian and North
African culture. For example, we find unsuccess-
ful CS on the page about Yazdanism, a religion in-
digenous to Mesopotamia and on the Egypt page
about the ancestry of the Egyptian population (see
Table 7). Hypothesis 2’s claim of CS as an ‘out-
sider’ effect may be supported in these contexts.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

We present a task and dataset to study the social ef-
fect of CS in the context of an online collaborative
community, as well as an analysis of how sociolin-
guistic theory about deviation from conversational
norms in CS can explain this data. We find that
CS on Arabic Wikipedia talk pages is associated
with making successful article edits, a measure of
social influence. This finding supports a social in-
terpretation of CS as a positive marker in this com-
munity, especially when the subject matter is tech-
nical or relates to non-Arabic topics.

Hypothesis 3 is most clearly supported by the
positive association of CS with editor influence.
Hypothesis 1, the lack of relationship between CS
and social meaning, is unlikely given the effects
we see on social influence. Hypothesis 2, a nega-
tive evaluation of CS as deviating from an Arabic
norm, could explain the effect of CS in some con-
texts we observe, such as pages with topics related
to Arabic culture.

In future work, norms specific to pages, users,
languages and topics could be quantitatively ex-
plored and could nuance our measures of the
markedness of editor contributions from those
norms. Our dataset could also be used to analyze
other factors contributing to editor success, such

80



as speech acts, politeness, or conversational roles.
Further, this framework could easily be ex-

panded to a broader multi-lingual analysis across
Wikipedias of different languages, or even dialec-
tal analysis within the Arabic Wikipedia. Differ-
ent community norms about language choice on
talk pages could yield different correlations with
social influence.
