Abstract

Automatic assessment of the proficiency lev-
els of the learner is a critical part of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems. We present methods for
assessment in the context of language learn-
ing. We use a specialized Elo formula used
in conjunction with educational data mining.
We simultaneously obtain ratings for the pro-
ficiency of the learners and for the difficulty
of the linguistic concepts that the learners are
trying to master. From the same data we also
learn a graph structure representing a domain
model capturing the relations among the con-
cepts. This application of Elo provides ratings
for learners and concepts which correlate well
with subjective proficiency levels of the learn-
ers and difficulty levels of the concepts.

1 Introduction

A key goal of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)
is to provide students with individualized learning,
and thus support their learning process. Several
systems for various subjects have proven to be ef-
fective, (Ritter et al., 2007; Arroyo et al., 2014;
Klinkenberg et al., 2011). Our work is part of
an international collaborative effort to developing
large-scale Intelligent Computer-Aided Language
Learning (ICALL) systems for use in real-world
environments. Our system, Revita (Katinskaia
et al., 2018), is in use in official university-level
curricula at several major universities, to enhance
language learning and teaching.1

To develop automated methods for personalized
tutoring, robust models for assessing the current
proficiency of learners are required. Such models
enable quantitative evaluation and comparison of
teaching methods with respect to the rate of devel-
opment of the learners, which enables us to evalu-
ate the performance of the ICALL system.

Several approaches for modeling knowledge
have been proposed, such as Bayesian Knowledge
Tracing (Corbett and Anderson, 1994), Learn-
ing Factor Analysis (Cen et al., 2006), and
its more advanced variant—Performance Factor
Analysis, (Pavlik Jr et al., 2009). These models,
however, are complex and time-consuming to im-
plement for ITS, and require large amounts of data
for each learner, (Pelánek, 2016).

In this work, we present a simple and effective
method for assessing the proficiency of language
learners, as well as the difficulty of linguistic con-
cepts, by utilizing the Elo formula, (Elo, 1978)—
in an unsupervised fashion. The result is a set of
rated concepts and a method for assessing the cur-
rent and historical proficiency of each learner. We
also present a concept graph—learned from the
educational data—representing the dependencies
between concepts.

We use educational data, collected from real
language learners, in two assessment contexts.
One context is where learners take language profi-
ciency tests. During the test the system samples
questions from a database, each question linked
to a specific linguistic concept. Examples of con-
cepts are collocations, certain type of verb inflec-
tion, certain word-order rules, etc. In the second
context, learners do exercises based on “authentic”
texts—chosen based on the learners’ interests—
that have a difficulty estimate, assigned by a sta-
tistical model. In each context, the result is a nu-
meric Elo-based rating describing learners’ profi-
ciency in the target language.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
outlines out data generation process. In Section 3,
we describe the Elo rating system, and discuss our
modifications to the formulas in the two assess-
ment contexts. In Section 4, we discuss our ap-
proach for building a domain model, represented
by a concept graph. Section 5 describes simula-

tions and experiments on obtaining Elo ratings for
concepts and for assessing learner competency. In
Section 6, we discuss preliminary results on corre-
lation between Elo ratings in different assessment
contexts, and the correlation between the Elo rat-
ings and the performance levels assigned by teach-
ers. We also demonstrate a graph of concepts, each
with Elo difficulty estimates. In Section 7, we dis-
cuss current problems. Section 8 concludes with
current directions of research.

2 Data

This work builds on educational data we have col-
lected through a collaborative effort with language
teachers at several universities. In this paper, we
focus on students learning Russian as a second
language (L2) at different levels on the CEFR
scale, ranging from A1 to C2, (Little, 2007). The
students yield data in two assessment contexts:

Language tests: In the testing context, the stu-
dents take online language tests on a platform pro-
vided by the system. Each test is time-limited,
and comprised of approximately 300 test items,
sampled from a database of 3390 multiple-choice
questions. The questions were prepared by lan-
guage teachers and linguistic experts over a period
of 20 years, (Kopotev, 2012, 2010). Each question
is linked to one of 140 linguistic “concepts,” also
predefined by the experts. At the time of this writ-
ing, the response data consists of 600 000 test an-
swers, by approximately 1000 learners. For each
answer we record to which concept the question
belongs, whether the answer was correct, as well
as timestamps.

Language practice: In the practice context, stu-
dents practice the language by doing exercises
based on a text. The response data consists of
student answers to the exercises: one set of ex-
ercises is associated with a snippet of text (e.g,
one paragraph). The system offers various types
of exercises, including multiple-choice questions,
“cloze” quizzes (fill-in-the-blank), and listening
comprehension, which are generated automati-
cally based on the text chosen by the learner. Each
text has been assigned a difficulty rating by a lin-
ear model, described in 3.4. Currently, we do not
use information about to which linguistic concepts
each exercise belong. For each attempted set of
exercises, we use the percentage of correct an-
swers, text difficulty, and the timestamp.

3 Rating methods

This section describes how we calculate and up-
date ratings of users and linguistic concepts. We
cover the two assessment contexts in which the
data were generated: first, the testing context, and
second, the practice context. The estimator of text
difficulty is described at the end of this section.

3.1 Elo ratings
The Elo rating, introduced by Arpad Elo, (Elo,
1978), was originally used for rating the skills of
chess players, and evolved versions of it are now
widely used in a variety of domains, ranging from
video-games to Tinder.

The Elo formula defines the expected result of
actor A in a match against actor B according to:

EA =
1

1 + 10
RB−RA

σ

(1)

EA is a value between 0 and 1, indicating the ex-
pectation (probability) of success/win. RX refers
to the current rating of actor X , and σ is a scale
variable. The scale is traditionally set to 400 (in
chess). This controls the spread of the resulting
ratings. In the present work, we used σ = 600.2

The rating of actorA after a match with another
actor is completed is updated according to:

R′A = RA +K(SA − EA) (2)

The factor K controls the maximum rating adjust-
ment that is possible at one time. We use a static
K value of 32. SA denotes the outcome, or the
score of a match for actor A: loss, draw and win
for A is denoted as 0, 0.5 and 1, respectively.

The Elo rating method has three important prop-
erties. First, the formulas are symmetric: A and B
switch places when calculating with respect to B.
This leads to the zero-sum property of the Elo rat-
ing distribution, when K is static—the amount of
Elo lost by the losing actor is transferred to the
winning one. As a result, the mean of the ratings
of all actors will be whatever the initial rating is set
to. We initially set the rating of all players (con-
cepts and learners) to 1500.

Second, the magnitude of the rating update de-
pends on the difference between the outcome SA

2The reason for this is largely aesthetic; the number of
users is currently small (about 1000), which results in a some-
what narrow spread of the rating distribution. A larger spread
is more comparable to actual chess ratings, which is more
familiar and easier to conceptualize.

and the expected score EA. This means that a
highly rated actor failing against a significantly
lower rated one will have a severe loss in Elo, ap-
proaching the value of K. Conversely, the success
of a higher rated actor is expected, thus it yields a
small update in the rating. If the actors are evenly
matched the update is between the two extremes.

Finally, the final, or “current,” distribution of
Elo ratings in a system depends on the order of
the matches. This implies that the Elo rating is
a representation of an actor’s current proficiency.
Consider an actor who fails in the first half of
100 matches, and succeeds in the second half, and
compare the result to the reverse order. Because
the rating updates decrease toward the expected
extremes, and are exaggerated at the unexpected
extremes, the resulting rating of the actor will be
high when his successes are in the second half
of the matches and low in the reverse case—even
though the two sequences are events are the same,
and differ only in their ordering.

3.2 Language test ratings

In (Klinkenberg et al., 2011; Pelánek, 2016), it was
shown that Elo ratings can be adapted for use in
educational systems, to model the proficiency of
students and the difficulty of questions. In our sys-
tem, in the testing context, the analogue of an out-
come of a “game” is a student attempting an exer-
cise; the two rated “actors” are the student and the
exercise. SA represents whether a student has an-
swered the question correctly. The rating RQ of a
question Q captures the difficulty of the question.

An adjustment is made for multiple-choice
problems to account for the fact that students have
some chance of guessing correctly, even if they do
not know the correct answer. For this, we adopt an
approach recommended by Pelánek (2016), penal-
izing the expected value by the probability that a
random guess is correct. A similar expectation for-
mula is proposed in Item Response Theory (Em-
bretson and Reise, 2013).

In (Klinkenberg et al., 2011; Pelánek, 2016), the
focus was assessing the difficulty of each particu-
lar question. In our system, we model the con-
cept category to which the questions belong; ev-
ery question from a concept is a representative for
the concept in the calculations. In our data, each
question is linked to one linguistic concept. The
formula for the expectation of student S having
a correct response on a question from Concept C

adjusted for guessing is:

EA =
1

k
· 1 + (1− 1

k
) · 1

1 + 10
RC−RS

σ

, (3)

where k is the number of choices in the multiple-
choice question. We expect the Elo ratings
for concepts to approach their true value after
a large number of data points (“games” or ex-
ercise attempts) have been sampled. To ob-
tain concept ratings of better quality, they are
learned by re-adjusting all ratings by re-playing all
games/attempts in chronological order over sev-
eral epochs. We call this the Elo “burn-in” period,
and describe it in Section 5.1. This is used to ob-
tain “stable” concept ratings.

3.3 Language practice ratings
In the practice context, the exercises are different
from the test context. Our method therefore dif-
fers in the two contexts in several ways. Here,
the exercises sets that the learners have answered
are composed of a variety of exercises, some of
which may not be linked to a specific linguistic
concept (recall, each test item is linked to a con-
cept). This means we cannot share the ratings di-
rectly between the two learning contexts.

To address this problem, we make the simplify-
ing assumption that on average the exercises in a
given text correspond to the difficulty rating of the
text. The method for estimating the difficulty of a
text is described in the following subsection.3

Concretely, we define SA as the percentage of
correct responses in a given set of exercises. EA
for a set of exercises is set to the Elo rating of the
entire text from which the exercises are drawn.

We update the learner’s Elo after each set of ex-
ercises, but update the text’s Elo only after an en-
tire iteration through the text. Crucially, the sys-
tem updates the Elo for the text only with respect
to the specific user who practiced it. This mod-
els the notion that as I practice with the same text
over and over, the text becomes “easier” for me—
but not for other players.

3.4 Estimator of text difficulty
Modeling and characterizing the readability of
texts is a well-studied problem with a long his-
tory, (Dubay, 2009). Experiments with lexical and

3This means that A. our difficulty model should return an
accurate estimate of the complexity of the text, and B. that
these difficulty estimates should be properly calibrated to the
desired rating scale.



497

grammatical features have been conducted, (Chen
and Meurers, 2016; Heilman et al., 2008).

We use a simple linear model for estimating the
difficulty of a given text. The output of this model
is scaled onto the Elo rating scale. This enables us
to calculate the expected result of any rated learner
solving exercises from any rated text.

Lexical frequency is known to be a powerful
predictor of text readability, (Chen and Meurers,
2016). We use the normalized mean of the lexical
frequencies of the tokens in a text as a feature. Ad-
ditionally, we use mean token length and mean
sentence length, as they are also used in classic
readability measurements, (Kincaid et al., 1975;
Flesch, 1979). These three features are scaled for
a simple 3-variable regression model.

Currently, data for training this model are parti-
tioned into two types: texts from sources with sim-
plified language vs. texts from difficult sources.
We label simple texts with a value of 0.2 and dif-
ficult texts with 0.8.4 We aim for a model that
produces a correct ordering of texts with respect
to their difficulty. We do not need an exact es-
timate. If the learner Elo ratings based on these
estimates correlate well with the ratings from the
testing context, we consider this estimator accu-
rate enough. In Section 5 we show that so far, this
indeed seems to be the case.

The model outputs typically range between 0
and 1. We scale these values to Elo ratings ac-
cording to formula 4. This transformation is based
on the Elo rating distribution acquired in the test-
ing context. The bounds are clamped at (0, 1), as
some texts may get a high difficulty value (some-
times even > 2, in extreme cases).

4 Concept graph

We are interested in finding a model for the “nat-
ural” order in which learners acquire linguistic
concepts—directly from learner data. Learners
will find some orders more natural than others—

4This is a simplification, which does not reflect reality ac-
curately, as not all texts from a given source are of equal dif-
ficulty. However, simply fitting a low dimensional, high-bias
estimator such as this yields a reasonable baseline model that
generalizes well enough to other texts. We will explore more
sophisticated models in the future.

e.g., when some concept is a requirement for an-
other. The fact that one concept “precedes” an-
other is called the surmise relation in Knowledge
Space Theory (Doignon and Falmagne, 1999).

Often the domain model in ITS is built by elic-
iting domain knowledge from experts. We devised
a baseline model to infer such relations from user
data, without supervision. As we mentioned, each
test question is mapped to a certain linguistic con-
cept, and we store all test results from all students.
Based on these results, we know to what extent
which users have mastered which concepts; from
this, we can try to tell apart the more basic con-
cepts from the more advanced ones.

The aim is to build a partial order over the set of
all concepts C, which specifices which concepts
are related—i.e., we write c2 → c1 to mean con-
cept c2 presupposes (or implies) concept c1.5

Given a set of users U , we build a matrix of
“mastery” scores M , of dimension |U | × |C|. Ev-
ery element Mij is the proportion of correct an-
swers that user ui has given for concept cj . In the
current implementation, we consider each “user”
to be a single test session. If the same person
completes the test at different times, they will be
treated as different users for the purpose of com-
puting consistency. This is done to take into ac-
count the fact that a user’s level of proficiency
changes over time.

For every pair c1, c2 ∈ C, we check whether
c2 → c1, c1 → c2 or c1 ⊥ c2 . We compare all
columns of M pairwise. Let cj denote column j
ofM and ck column k. To check whether ck → cj
is true, we define a logical function CONu which
checks that user u is consistent with this relation:

Muk Muj CONu(ck → cj)
0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 1
1 1 1

Again, here ck is the “harder” concept than cj .
Thus, if Muk = 0 (user u knows nothing about
concept ck), that is consistent with ck → cj re-
gardless of the value of cj . Conversely ifMuj = 1
(user umastered concept ck perfectly), that is con-
sistent with ck → cj regardless of the value of ck.

In practice, the values in M are fractions be-
tween 0 and 1. Therefore we introduce two thresh-

5We would like to say that c1 is a prerequisite for c2, but
that may be too strong a claim. However we may be able to
learn from the data that typically c1 is mastered before c2.



498

old parameters to map Mij to zeroes and ones:
we believe that a user u really does not know the
(harder) concept ck if Muk 6 θguess: the “guess-
ing” upper bound, below which we believe that the
user does not know the concept, while sometimes
only guessing the correct answer. Analogously,
we say that a user u has mastered quite well the
(easier) concept cj if Muj > θmaster: the “mas-
tery” lower bound, above which we believe that
the user knows the concept, while sometimes mak-
ing a few mistakes.

To check whether ck → cj , we compute the pro-
portion σ of all users who are consistent with this
relation ck → cj , as follows:

σ(ck → cj) =
1

n

∑
u∈U

CONu(Muk,Muj)

where:

CONu(Muk,Muj) =


1 if Muk 6 θguess
1 if Muj > θmaster
0 otherwise

n is the total number of users. θguess and θmaster
refer to the thresholds of guessing and master-
ing respectively. That is, we ignore all users
where the level of proficiency in c1 and c2 suggests
that user only partially understands both concepts,
since they do not support to the consistency from
ck → cj .

We then apply a consistency threshold θ such
that, if σ(c2 → c1) > θ, we add the relation c2 →
c1 to our partial order.

Finally, we represent the partial order as a di-
rected acyclic graph (DAG), where each path in
the graph represents a possible prerequisite route
toward learning a concept. For example, if we
wish to obtain a complete syllabus for a language
course, then we can find a total order compatible
with our partial order (i.e., a linear extension) by
topologically sorting the nodes in the graph.

We tested this approach with a set of over 620K
answers gathered from 700 users, and manually
evaluated the results, setting θ = .7.

Our domain experts confirm that the resulting
graph provides a plausible model for the relations
between the concepts in the language.

5 Experiments

5.1 Elo burn-in
In conventional Elo rating systems, the ratings of
both actors are updated after each match. Our goal

Figure 1: Learning concept Elo ratings with burn-in

is to learn a stable rating for each language con-
cept, which we can keep unchanged as learners
take further tests and improve. The rationale be-
hind this is that the concepts don’t become less
difficult for everyone if a learner masters it.

To achieve this, we perform a burn-in simu-
lation based on the user data we have collected.
Specifically, we take the entire collection of data
and calculate the Elo updates for each data point—
user U doing exercise E—in chronological order.
We do this for repeated epochs until the sum of
differences between epochs nears zero. This is il-
lustrated in Figure 1.

Once convergence is achieved, we reset the stu-
dent ratings, and recalculate them from scratch
with the fixed concept ratings. This yields a system
where the learners’ ratings are comparable and in-
dependent for any learner, including future ones.

5.2 Test and exercise simulation
To verify that one test (of 300 items) is sufficient
for a learner to reach her current “true” rating, we
performed simulation experiments. Concretely,
we measured how many test items a new learner
(e.g., with a rating of 1800 Elo) must answer in
order to settle on her rating.

In this simulation, each student is initially rated
as 1500, and complete some test items. We use
the Elo expectation formula to get the response
accuracy for the simulated actors. We perform
randomized simulations of actors performing one
300-item test with this average response accu-
racy and observe the results, shown in Figure 2.
The actors’ responses—correct or false—are sam-
pled randomly according to her supposed correct
rate. We also add a small amount of normally dis-
tributed random noise. As Figure 2 shows, in this
case, one 300-item test is enough to reach one’s
“true” rating.



499

Figure 2: Simulation: test items

Figure 3: Simulation: exercises based on texts

In contrast to the test item context, in the con-
text of text-based exercises, the Elo ratings will be
updated over time both for for learners and prac-
tice texts. We conducted a simulation to visualize
the rating trends.

In the exercise simulation, the simulated actor
has the same starting point as in the simulation for
tests—1500. We fix her rate of correct responses,
e.g., as 50%, and the actor is practicing only sim-
ulated texts rated at 1800. This means that the the-
oretical upper bound of the actors’ rating is, by
definition, under 1800.6 The same normally dis-
tributed noise is introduced in this simulation as
above. The data in our system shows that texts typ-
ically contain 10 snippets (exercise sets) or fewer.
After a full pass through a text, namely, 10 prob-
lem sets, the ratings for the text are updated with
respect to this particular actor. In this simula-
tion each text is to be practiced twice. Figure 3
shows the result of this simulation. We stopped
the simulation after 8 texts (each practiced twice)
because the rating of the actor had converged to
1800. Since the student begins far below 1800,
the first several problem sets will have a substan-
tial drop in their rating, due to the large initial dif-

650% success rate in a competition setting means the play-
ers are perfectly matched; since the text is rated 1800, the
learner’s Elo rating should also reach 1800 and remain there.

Figure 4: Expert annotated CEFR groups vs. mean Elo
rating for each CEFR level

ference between student’s rating and text’s diffi-
culty estimate. This initial burn-in process soon
ends, after the student practice several snippets.
As we can observe in Figure 3, the initial burn-
in process ends after 3 texts—10 snippets/practice
sets per text, each text practiced twice, yielding
60 snippets—the subsequent ones showing only
a slight change. The simulation is based on the
assumption that the student will go though every
problem set in strict order. In reality, this is not
very likely. We can therefore infer that this student
can reach a rating around 1800 rating after practic-
ing with less than 140 snippets/problem sets.

6 Results

The result of primary interest is how well the Elo
ratings given by our system correspond to CEFR
levels assigned to the learners by the expert teach-
ers, who estimate the learners’ proficiency based
on a wide range of assessment criteria, including
written essays and oral exams. The relationship
between Elo and CEFR is illustrated in Figure 4.

The figure shows the means and 95% confi-
dence intervals of the Elo ratings for the CEFR
levels of students, assigned subjectively by the
teachers. The numbers of students at each CEFR
level in our experiments are given in Table 1. The
data in Figure 4 comes from 142 students whose
CEFR levels were established independently of
these tests by the teachers. Although language
competency encompasses several skills—reading,
writing, aural comprehension, speaking—and the
learner may be at different levels in different skills,
we normally expect that the competencies across
different sills are fairly well correlated. The cor-
relation om Figure 4 is 0.90. Thus, the data in the
figure indicate good correlation between our rating
method and actual proficiency.

Figure 5: A representative student test Elo progress

of learners is largely in the realm of future work,
we have interesting preliminary data of learners’
improvement. Figure 5 shows an example of the
progress of a typical actual learner taking tests.
The learner takes (randomized) tests over a period
of time, with the rating improving consistently. In
this example, we see an increase of almost 300 in
average Elo during the periods. The improvement
is attributed to the fact that the learner has covered
new material during the period, mastered more of
the concepts in the test, and consequently scoring
better on those questions.

Another crucial question is how well our Elo
estimates from the exercise context correlate with
Elo ratings from the testing context. For this we
also have initial results, shown in Figure 6. We
have so far collected only a modest amount of
learner data, and therefore the conclusions drawn
from the data are preliminary. Investigating this
correlation requires substantial data from learners
who have worked in both contexts: practicing with
exercises based on texts, and completing tests. The
figure shows results for the top 17 students, who
have completed at least 1000 exercise sets (text
snippets, in orange) and at least 300 test items (in
blue)—sorted according to their test rating. The
figure shows good correlation between the two rat-

cise ratings (ρ = 0.79)

ings for the students. At present, the correlation
between test and practice Elo score is 0.79.

The last goal in our work is to investigate the re-
lationship between the concept graph and the Elo
ratings. Figure 7 shows a small sub-graph of the
concept graph. The complete concept graph 8 can
found in the Appendix. From Figures 7 and 8, we
can see that typically (though not always), if con-
cept A surmises concept B, A will have a higher
Elo rating than B. This makes sense, as more dif-
ficult concepts should surmise easier ones. The
Elo ratings and the graph structure do not corre-
spond perfectly. Expecting that real-valued linear
ratings can accurately describe the natural order
of concepts is unreasonable. Since the graph and
the Elo ratings describe different processes, it is
not surprising to find inversions in the graph, such
as between concepts 98 and 93, in Figure 7. The
structure of the graph, its relation to the difficulty
of concepts, and the natural learning order of con-
cepts is an key future research topic.

7 Current problems

We are in the process of collecting user data and
evaluating the methods of assessment presented in
this paper. Subjective CEFR ratings are being col-
lected from the teachers for some of the students.
While the number of hand-labeled CEFR ratings
is modest at the time of writing, it is sufficient to
indicate that using Elo-based ratings for measur-
ing language proficiency shows promise. Building
domain models based on the concept precedence
graph is another direction of research.

Comparing our ratings and expert-annotated
proficiency levels in larger quantities will raise the
confidence of our method. We must note that a sin-
gle value cannot be expected to describe the lan-
guage proficiency of a learner completely, as there
are several aspects of the language to master.

We plan to compare other Elo-based mod-
els, such as Glicko (Glickman, 1999), and
TrueSkill (Herbrich et al., 2007), with our Elo rat-
ing formula. Robust methods for obtaining nu-
merical estimates of skills enables us to develop
ICALL systems, by facilitating the quantitative
evaluation of skills, and the resulting improvement
of the learners.

8 Conclusions

The main contributions of this paper are:

• We adapt and evaluate Elo-based rating for-
mulas for modeling language learners’ profi-
ciency, as well as the difficulty of texts and
linguistic concepts, not only the difficulty of
questions/test items.
• We obtain static difficulty ratings for the

linguistic concepts by performing an ini-
tial burn-in for the Elo ratings based on a
large amount of learner data, and then as-
sess students’ proficiency using the learned
Elo ratings. Feedback from language teach-
ers/experts indicates that the ratings correlate
with their estimates of learner competency.
• We use a linear-regression model of text dif-

ficulty as an estimator, to obtain Elo ratings
for the texts. This enables us to rate the per-
formance of learners, who practice with ex-
ercises generated from the texts. Preliminary
results indicate that there is a positive corre-
lation between ratings in the exercise and the
test contexts.

• We build a partial order over all concepts
found in the domain, and visualize the par-
tial order as a DAG over concepts. The con-
cept graph is not linear as the Elo ratings.
The structure of the concept graph and the
Elo ratings of the concepts generally agree
in that the graph displays a strong tendency
of decreasing rating from the more complex
concepts to the more fundamental concepts,
as indicated by the actual data collected from
the learning process.

In sum, the proposed methods enable us to rate
the proficiency of the current and future language
learners, which is a fundamental goal in ITS and
ICALL.
