How does AltLang work? The basics… 1/3
● automatically and quickly replaces differences among two variants of the 

same language → nice for dynamic content
● performs only controlled changes → no (or low) risks
● highly customisable → can adapt to DNT, lexical choices, etc.
● easily accessible → full integration (JSON API), out-of-the-box testing 

(web-based demo), professional use (CAT tools and CMS)
● AltLang is SaaS, a GPLv2- based service

Variants is all about letters, words, some local changes... 
It looks like we can automate it!

Implementation

AltLang cloud service is delivered through integration with the CMS (AEM) as 
a connector available on the Adobe Exchange.

Goal: Automatic, dynamic, low-risk conversion without any human intervention.

US English
authoring

Copy to 
Global EN 
language 

master DIR

Push to EN 
country 

sites

Publish 
content to

sites

https://www.adobe.io/apis/marketingcloud/aem/aemconnectors.html

The conversion is dynamically triggered 
each time the EN content is pushed from 

the langmaster directory to the (12) country 
sites for publishing live, and is then 

cached locally (jcr node).

Challenges - Customization
● DNT - Adobe product &

brand names
○ Lumetri Color
○ Media Optimizer

(Media Manager in Japan)

● No Adobe-specific aligned bilingual corpus
○ zero target language content for language variations 

● Adobe Style Guides lack language variations
Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018 | Page 45



Test Strategy
● Three test cycles to customize for Adobe

○ Review staged content based on test cases
■ Conversion is working correctly and consistently
■ Check for over/under conversions via search and diff
■ Check for regionalisms (state vs county)
■ Check for anomalies

● “leveraging” > “leverage”;
“resizable” > “resisable”, but “sizable” did not convert, as
expected

○ Create dummy content pages (with sample test cases) for
troubleshooting & debugging

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018 | Page 46



Challenges - Post-Testing
● Language conversion for multiple countries not applicable to all; too many

“exceptions” can create other issues.
○ [EN-US] “state” (administrative division) <> [EN-GB] “county” applies to just a few

of the 12 country sites that prefer UK English.
○ [EN-US] “advertising dollars”. How to deal with currencies? Best to change the

source to “advertising budget”, for example.
● How to scale fixing one-off feedback from web producers, field
● Website Architecture/Infrastructure Issues

○ Pulling and aligning source/converted content directly from the CMS so quality
scoring can be performed.

○ Only a page with a change made to it, will trigger the conversion. (Bug fixes to
AltLang)

Metrics
Language Quality
● Prompsit scoring (BLEU, WER, Edit Distance)

Customer Impact
● 12 of 16 Global English country sites prefer UK English

(Africa, BE_EN, CY_EN, GR_EN, IE, LU_EN, MT, UK, AU, NZ, HK_EN, IN)
● ~15K pages converted in the initial launch
● Traffic: Avg. 77% VISITS/MONTH UK English/Global English-language websites

Customer Engagement - SEO (Future)
on converted pages since the change from EN-US to EN-GB

● Bounce rate
● CTR
● Time/pages per visit

Language quality evaluation: general numbers
● American to British English
● 190 web pages (HTML)
● 5k translation units (after deduplication)

*sum of substitutions + insertions + deletions

Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018 | Page 49



Language quality evaluation: automatic metrics
● BLEU is almost 1 (between 0 -- worst and 1 -- best)
● WER is lower than 1% (between 0% -- best  and 100% -- worst)
● Edit distance (character level, between before and after customisation):

Automatic metrics

BLEU 0,98

WER 0,82%

EDIT DISTANCE 541

Are these differences 
good or bad? 
Need for an qualitative 
evaluation

Language quality evaluation: a human insight

● sampling of 500 sentences with 84 changes
● human inspection of changes classified as correct, incorrect and missing

Correct changes 62 72

● a useful → an useful
● Facebook Customised Audience

● Add “segment”, “harness” and “retarget” as
verbs to apply “help + pron. + to + infinitive” rule

Conclusions about AltLang @ Adobe

● Easy integration through the AltLang connector for AEM
● Hands-off automation from authoring to publishing
● Cost-effective and “sim-ship” geo customization
● Customi[z|s]ation is key but not an obstacle

○ With no training corpora, customization is done post-implementation
● Metrics creation is a journey
