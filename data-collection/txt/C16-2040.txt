Abstract

We demonstrate TopoText, an interactive tool for digital mapping of literary text. TopoText
takes as input a literary piece of text such as a novel or a biography article and automatically
extracts all place names in the text. The identified places are then geoparsed and displayed on
an interactive map. TopoText calculates the number of times a place was mentioned in the text,
which is then reflected on the map allowing the end-user to grasp the importance of the different
places within the text. It also displays the most frequent words mentioned within a specified
proximity of a place name in context or across the entire text. This can also be faceted according
to part of speech tags. Finally, TopoText keeps the human in the loop by allowing the end-user
to disambiguate places and to provide specific place annotations. All extracted information such
as geolocations, place frequencies, as well as all user-provided annotations can be automatically
exported as a CSV file that can be imported later by the same user or other users.

1 Overview

Spatial humanities researchers have long been utilizing digital mapping techniques in digital humanities.
These visualizations are of interest because they uncover the internal spatial construction of works and
often evoke arguments through patterns that may have otherwise eluded the reader through traditional
close reading techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate TopoText, an interactive tool for digital mapping
of literary texts in various languages such as English, German and Spanish. TopoText combines many
NLP tools to provide the user with a comprehensive location-centered summary of a given text. First, it
extracts all place names in the given text, which are then geoparsed and displayed on a map. In case of
ambiguous place names, it provides a list of all the alternative locations that a place may be referring to
(such as London England vs. London Ontario) with their geo-coordinates. The user can then pick the
correct location the place is referring to, thereby introducing human intervention into automatic mapping
in order to create the most accurate map possible. Moreover, TopoText calculates the number of times
a place is mentioned in the text and plots it onto the map by having the points appear in different sizes.
This results in a more meaningful map that is reflective of the content of the work rather than creating
the illusion that all the places carry the same importance in the text.

TopoText goes beyond simply creating maps by instantly providing the user with word-place collo-
cations that contextualize a place by offering the most recurring words related to it. These words can
be faceted by part of speech tagging, which is useful because when tagging for nouns, for example, the
resulting words would likely point to the general themes associated to this place. The word cloud can

either show the word-place collocation in a specific passage (such as, the most frequent words around
London in a user-highlighted text) or in the entire work (the most frequent words around London in
Charles Dickenss Oliver Twist, or in his entire corpus). These word-place collocations can show how
spatial representation of various places changes over time and across authors.

TopoText also allows the user to annotate places and the annotations are directly displayed on that place
on the map. The annotations can range all the way from merely extracting specific passages to personal
responses and analysis. This subjective element is crucial to humanities work and really opens up the
system to many fields and drastically increases its scope. Finally, TopoText exports all the automatically
geoparsed data, including place names, their geo-coordinates, and other attributes such as the frequencies
and annotations, into a separate file that can be reused on other mapping platforms. This functionality
counters commercial GIS tools and aligns with the open-source values that lie at the core of digital
humanities practices. TopoText is fully implemented and is available as a free open-source tool under
the GNU General Public License at https://github.com/rkhatib/topotext/tree/v2.

2 System Architecture

Figure 1: TopoText System Architecture

Figure 1 depicts the system architecture for TopoText. TopoText consists of two main components: a
browse component and an import component. We will describe each separately next.

2.1 Browse Component

In the browse component, the user provides a piece of text, such as a novel or a biography article as a .txt
file. The input text is then passed to the Stanford Named Entity Recognition (NER) Classifier (Finkel
et al., 2005) which extracts all named entities in the text belonging to one of three classes: PERSON,
ORGANIZATION and LOCATION. The list of places recognized (i.e. names tagged as LOCATION)
are then extracted and provided back to the user, who has the following ways to explore these places:

• The user can select a place and track its occurrences in the text. TopoText highlights the user-
selected place in the text and n words around it (distance in Figure 1). The user can also navigate to
the next and previous occurrence of the place in the text. Figure 2 shows a snapshot of this feature.

• The user can generate a map of all extracted places using Leaflet, which is an open-source JavaScript
library for interactive maps (lea, 2016). To be able to do this, the extracted places by the NER
tool are first geoparsed through the GeoNames web service (geo, 2016). GeoNames is the largest
open gazetteer that is historical, multilingual, and provides alternative spellings for place names.
This differentiates TopoText from many other mapping tools that rely on modern gazetteers such
as Google Maps, thus excluding historical place names, alternative spellings (a common historical
occurrence before the standardization of spelling and in works translated from other languages), and
works written in other languages. In contrast, by relying on GeoNames, TopoText is able to extract
these variations and provides the end-user with a list of all the alternative locations that a place
may be referring to. The user can then specify which location a place refers to before it is rendered
on the map. Additionally, the user can also view the weight of each place on the map, where the
weight of a place is the frequency by which it appeared in the text. That is, the most frequent places
mentioned in the text will have bigger markers on the map. An example map is shown in Figure 3.

• The user can generate a Word Cloud for a given place. This word cloud can be a local word cloud
from n words around the selected place or a global word cloud from all the words around the place
in the text. In both cases, a web service provided by Wordle (wor, 2016) is used to generate the

word cloud. Figure 4 shows a snapshot of an example word cloud. The user has also the option
to select certain part of speech (POS) tags to include in the word cloud. The POS tags relevant in
TopoText are: adjective, adverb, verb and noun. For instance, the user can exclude the adverbs from
appearing in the word cloud, or select only the adjectives to have a better idea about the author’s
feelings about a certain place. To be able to do this, the text is POS tagged using the Stanford POS
tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000).

• Finally, the user can also export all extracted information to a CSV file which contains every place
extracted, their corresponding geo-coordinates, the country and an empty column where the user can
provide annotations for places (see Import Component next). An example exported file is shown in
Figure 5. This exported CSV file can be edited and reloaded by other users and can be re-used on
other mapping platforms as well.

2.2 Import Component

Using this component, the user can interact with a perviously exported CSV file. The user can, for in-
stance, change the location a given place was mapped to by going through the list of alternative locations
provided for that place, which are also included in the CSV file when it was exported. In addition, the
user can provide any annotations for one or more places. Finally, the user can import this annotated CSV
file, which will generate a map that displays all the places in the file along with their annotations.

3 Conclusion

We presented TopoText, an interactive digital mapping tool for literary texts in various language such as
English, German and Spanish. TopoText utilizes various NLP tools and resources such as the Stanford
NER, Leaflet, GeoNames and Wordle to provide users with a comprehensive location-centered summary
of a given text. TopoText keeps the human in the loop by allowing the end-user to disambiguate places
and to provide specific place annotations. TopoText is already available as an open source tool and has
stirred wide interest in the digital humanities circuits.

In future work, we plan to extend TopoText to support other languages such as Arabic. This would
involve finding or constructing appropriate gazetteers and NLP tools for such languages. We also plan
to augment TopoText with an image retrieval component where place images are automatically retrieved
from the Web and used to visually summarize the text. The images would be retrieved taken into consid-
eration the context in which the place was mentioned, thus providing an accurate visual description of the
place in context. Finally, we plan to develop a Web-based version of TopoText to increase its usability.
