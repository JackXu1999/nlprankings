Abstract

We investigate changes in the meanings of
words used in the UK Parliament across two
different decade-long epochs. We use word
embeddings to explore changes in the dis-
tribution of words of interest and uncover
words that appear to have undergone seman-
tic transformation in the intervening period.
We explore different ways of obtaining target
words for this purpose. We find that semantic
changes are generally in line with those found
in other corpora, and little evidence that parlia-
mentary language is more static than general
English. It also seems that words with senses
that have been recorded in the dictionary as
having fallen into disuse do not undergo se-
mantic changes in this domain.

1 Introduction

Commonly known as Hansard, transcripts of de-
bates held in the United Kingdom (UK) Parlia-
ment from 1802 to the present day are publicly and
freely available in digitized format. These tran-
scipts are important sources of historical and cur-
rent information for many people including schol-
ars in the political and social sciences, the media,
politicians, and members of the public who wish to
scrutinize the activities of elected representatives.

Natural languages (such as English) are known
to be dynamic, with the meaning of many lexical
items drifting over time (for example., gay: cheer-
ful→ homosexual (Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011)).

Knowledge of the level of such semantic change
existing in a particular domain can assist in the de-
sign of systems for downstream natural language
processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. For
example, training and testing on in-domain data
from different periods of time has been shown
to negatively affect perfomance in named entity
recognition (Fromreide et al., 2014) and sentiment
analysis (Kapovciute-Dzikiene and Krupavicius,

2014). Successful analysis of such changes in
Hansard could therefore be an important element
in the development of civic technology applica-
tions for parliamentary analysis.

In this paper, we investigate to what extent di-
achronic semantic change occurs in the Hansard
record by examining the contexts in which words
appear during two different periods in the corpus.

2 Analysis

2.1 Data: The Hansard record

We collected the transcripts of debates in the
House of Commons chamber from the parlia-
mentary Hansard website1 in html format and
extracted the text elements that correspond to
speaker utterances. These ‘substantially verba-
tim’2 transcripts are recorded by parliamentary re-
porters present at the debates.

Comparison across epochs Following Du-
bossarsky et al. (2017), we organised the tran-
scripts into two decade-long epochs for compar-
ison. We selected the periods 1909-18 and 2009-
18 due to (a) the latter being the most recent pe-
riod to comprise data from 10 complete years, and
(b) the former consisting of transcripts from a full
century prior, with the intervening period having
seen a variety of significant changes, both in Par-
liament (for example, women’s suffrage, the rise
of the Labour party) and in wider society (two
World Wars, the growth of technology). We con-
sidered the data for periods prior to the twentieth
century to possibly be insufficiently complete for
comparison with recent transcripts.3

periods (see Table 1) shows that, due to changes
in Hansard transcription practice, the more re-
cent epoch consists of a larger amount of data.
Additionally, the large quantity of unique tokens
(around 46 thousand items) that appear in only
one of the epochs (the disjunctive union of the two
sets) indicates that the vocabulary of the corpus
changes considerably in this period.

Utterances 448k 2.1M 2.5M
Tokens 33.7M 105.8M 124.9M
Unique tokens 95.6k 174.2k 222.8k

Table 1: Comparison of Hansard over two epochs.
Each day’s transcript typically includes several debates,
which can be broken down into individual utterances
(unbroken passages of text) and tokens (words).

2.2 Representation of the distributional space

In preproceesing, we stripped all utterances of
punctuation, lowercased and tokenized them.

We extracted embedding vectors using
gensim4’s word2vec5 (Mikolov et al., 2013),
with a context window of four tokens and vector
dimensionality of size 300 (following settings
used in previous work (Hamilton et al., 2016)).

As in Dubossarsky et al. (2017) and Hamilton
et al. (2016), we trained word embeddings on each
epoch, and aligned these using orthogonal pro-
crustes transformation (Schönemann, 1966). We
then compared word embedding vectors for each
word of interest across the different time windows
by calculating the cosine similarity of its embed-
ding vectors in the two different periods. Assum-
ing that lower similarity between these vectors in-
dicates a higher degree of difference in the mean-
ing and usage of a term, we use these calculations
to identify which of these words has undergone se-
mantic change in Hansard over time.

We calculate the cosine similarity between the
word embedding vector of each word that appears
in both epochs. The mean similarity across the en-
tire vocabulary is only 0.154, indicating that the
distributions of words in these two periods is quite
different overall. We use this figure for compari-
son with our target words.

2.3 Target words of interest

We investigate instances of semantic change in
the Hansard record from the two chosen epochs
in four groups of lexical items: (1) words known
from previous work to have undergone seman-
tic change in the twentieth century; (2) words
with senses that are no longer in use according to
the Oxford English Dictionary (OED); (3) words
from the parliamentary website’s glossary;6 and
(4) words not appearing in the first three cate-
gories that demonstrate the greatest degree of dis-
tributional change across epochs. We consider
words in the latter category to represent ‘discov-
ered’ changes from this domain.

Known words from prior work Overall, it
seems that words known to have undergone se-
mantic change in English, have also done so in
the Hansard record. Of the 21 known items (see
Table 2), 18 have lower cosine similarity than the
mean, suggesting that these semantic shifts also
take place in Hansard. Observing the words with
most similar embedding vectors in each epoch, we
consider that 14 of these exhibit clear shifts in us-
age. The word with most dissimilar embedding
vectors for the two periods is checking, which ap-
pears to undergo a similar shift in meaning as that
described by Kulkarni et al. (2015) (see Figure 1).

While some items do appear to have undergone
change in this data, this is not always of the form
reported in the original literature. For example,
while Hamilton et al. (2016) observe broadcast
moving from being an agricultural term to the me-
dia and technology domain, in Hansard, it’s earlier

Hansard are in bold. Those which appear to have shifted, but between different senses than those reported in the

sense seems to be related to the distributution of
printed material.

A number of observations seem to be artifacts
of this particular dataset. A feature of the earlier
epoch is that many of the MPs were ex-military
officers, so in this period the most similar words
to major are other rank titles such as colonel and
captain, while this term later adopts the sense of
important or significant. The word that appears to
have changed the least according to vector simi-
larity is honey. This is perhaps unsurprising, as
the later sense recorded by Kulkarni et al. (2015)
is both an informal term of address and associated
with American English—and therefore unlikely to
feature in UK parliamentary language. Given this,
the fact that this item still has fairly low cosine
similarity may be attributible to its frequent ap-
pearance as a surname in debates in the earlier
epoch.

Disused words We obtained a list of words
which have a least one sense that has fallen out
of use and was last recorded by the OED between

1900 and the present day.7 Of these, 39 appear in
both epochs of Hansard. While we determine that
most of these have not undergone semantic change
in the corpus, even the three items that do seem to
have shifted appear not to have been used in the
disused sense listed in the dictionary (see Table 3).

Parliamentary vocabulary Examination of the
51 single-word items in the parliamentary glossary
reveals that only 56.9% of these have cross-epoch
cosine similarity above the mean for the whole
corpus, indicating that, as might perhaps be ex-
pected, these words have been semantically sta-
ble in Hansard through the last century. Among
the most stable items are aristocratic titles such
as earl, bishop, and baron that are used to refer
to particular MPs and members of the House of
Lords.

Discovered changes We examined the top 20
words from the whole vocabulary that are most
and least similar according to cosine measurement
across the two epochs of interest, excluding proper
nouns, foreign words and numerals (see Table 4).
Examining the words with most similar embed-
ding vectors, we were able to confirm that most
of the top changed words have indeed undergone
semantic shifts, while none of those with the most
similar embeddings across epochs appear to have
done so. Examples, which may reflect societal
changes between the epochs are tailor (profession
→ adapt) and riddle (sieve→ puzzle).

3 Discussion

Words that have been shown to experience se-
mantic change in English, in general seem to ex-
hibit similar behaviour in parliamentary speeches.
When compared to nearest neighbours from the
distributional spaces in each epoch, it seems that
the words that are least similar over time do in-
deed undergo semantic change in Hansard during
this period. While it might be expected that words
with senses specific to Parliament should not ex-
hibit semantic change over time, they do not in
fact seem to be much more stable than other items.
This fact, combined with the overall low similarity
across epochs for all words, may suggest that the
differences in quantity and recording of the data in
the two observed periods makes alignment of the
word vectors problematic.

Additionally, words acknowleged to be in dis-

use in the OED tend to remain constant in this do-
main, and even those that do undergo change do
not always seem to be used in the previously ob-
served senses in this dataset. It would seem that,
while these words had their last ever recorded uses
in the period in question, they had already fallen
out of use in Parliament.

In making the above observations, we acknowl-
edge that it remains to be seen to what extent the
observed changes are actually representative of di-
achronic change and how many of these are simply
artifacts of the changing topics of dicussion in Par-
liament and the extent and manner of their record-
ing in the Hansard record over the two epochs.
We leave exploration of these questions for future
work.

4 Related work

The phenomenon of language change has long
been recognised (Sapir, 1921), and various social,
cultural and cognitive factors have been proposed
to explain it (Labov, 2011).

In recent years, efforts have been made to per-
form computational analyses of semantic change
in dichronic corpora, and a number of methods
have been proposed.8 For example, (Wijaya and
Yeniterzi, 2011) used topic modelling and clus-
tering to investigate changes in the meanings of
words in the Google Books corpus, while Fr-
ermann and Lapata (2016) proposed a Bayesian
sense modelling approach to uncover gradual
changes in meaning.

Much work in this area has focused on the
use of vector space models such as Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (LSA). Sagi et al. (2011) use
this approach to track differences in the use of
target words in historical texts, and Jatowt and
Duh (2014) compare LSA with other distributional
measurements.

A popular approach, which we adopt for this
paper, is to use word embeddings. Kulka-
rni et al. (2015) compare distributional with

frequency-based and syntactic analyses for di-
achronic change investigation, while Hamilton
et al. (2016) and Dubossarsky et al. (2017) use
embeddings to test hypotheses about the causes of
such changes.

While Bamler and Mandt (2017) and Rudolph
and Blei (2018) explore semantic change in the po-
litical domain on US State of the Union and Senate
speeches repectively, we are unaware of any simi-
lar work on UK parliamentary debate transcripts.

5 Conclusion

We have explored four ways of obtaining target
words of interest for diachronic semantic change
analysis and conducted an initial study of this task
in the domain of parliamentary debate transcripts.
We found that using similarity measurement of
word embedding vectors trained on two different
epochs of the data, we are able to verify shifts
in meaning in words that are known to have un-
dergone this process in general English, and that
we are also able to identify previously unknown
changes in this data. We also observe that words
with senses specific to parliamentary language do
not appear to be particularly stable across time.

Future work will focus on conducting more
comprehensive and systematic analyses of seman-
tic change throughout the whole Hansard corpus
in an effort to track senses and identify changes.
We would also like to explore the possibility of us-
ing dynamic embeddings (e.g., Bamler and Mandt,
2017; Rudolph and Blei, 2018; Yao et al., 2018) to
jointly train on different subsets of the data.
