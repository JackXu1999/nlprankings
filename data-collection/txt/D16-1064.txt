Abstract

In this paper, we utilize distributed word rep-
resentations (i.e., word embeddings) to anal-
yse the representation of semantics in brain
activity. The brain activity data were recorded
using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) when subjects were viewing words.
First, we analysed the functional selectivity of
different cortex areas by calculating the corre-
lations between neural responses and several
types of word representations, including skip-
gram word embeddings, visual semantic vec-
tors, and primary visual features. The results
demonstrated consistency with existing neu-
roscientific knowledge. Second, we utilized
behavioural data as the semantic ground truth
to measure their relevance with brain activity.
A method to estimate word embeddings under
the constraints of brain activity similarities is
further proposed based on the semantic word
embedding (SWE) model. The experimental
results show that the brain activity data are sig-
nificantly correlated with the behavioural data
of human judgements on semantic similarity.
The correlations between the estimated word
embeddings and the semantic ground truth
can be effectively improved after integrating
the brain activity data for learning, which
implies that semantic patterns in neural rep-
resentations may exist that have not been fully
captured by state-of-the-art word embeddings
derived from text corpora.

1 Introduction

Recently, the topic of exploring semantic represen-
tation in human brain has attracted the attention of

researchers from both neuroscience and computa-
tional linguistics fields. In these studies, concepts
are represented in terms of neural activation patterns
in the brain that can be recorded by functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Haxby et al.,
2001). It has been found that the semantic space
shared among different individuals is distributed
continuously across the cortex (Huth et al., 2012).
A recent study proposed an efficient way to measure
and visualize the semantic selectivity of different
cortex areas (Huth et al., 2016).

Similar to the distributed semantic representation
in the brain, describing the meaning of a word
using a dense low-dimensional and continuous vec-
tor (i.e., word embedding) is currently a popular
approach in computational linguistics (Hinton et
al., 1986; Turney et al., 2010). Word embeddings
are commonly estimated from large text corpora
utilizing statistics concerning the co-occurrences
of words (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al.,
2013b; Pennington et al., 2014). To investigate
the correlation between word embeddings and the
brain activity involved in viewing words, Mitchell
et al. (2008) designed a computational model to
predict brain responses using hand-tailored word
embeddings as input. Further, Fyshe et al. (2014)
proposed a joint non-negative sparse embedding
(JNNSE) method to combine fMRI data and textual
data to estimate word embeddings. This work
improved the correlation between word embeddings
and human behavioural data, which lends support
to the view that fMRI data can provide additional
semantic information that may not exist in textual
data.

The factors that can influence the activities of
cortex areas are diverse. Recent studies show that vi-
sual semantic features such as bag-of-visual-words
(BoVW) are significantly correlated with the fMRI
data captured when viewing words (Anderson et al.,
2013). The primary visual features derived using
Gabor wavelets can be used to determine the images
presented to the subjects from their recorded brain
activity (Kay et al., 2008; Naselaris et al., 2009).
Some other research work also indicates that visual
experiences (Nishimoto et al., 2011) and speech
information (Ryali et al., 2010) can affect neural
responses in cortex areas.

In this paper, we first study the semantic repre-
sentation of words in brain activity by correlation
analysis (Anderson et al., 2013; Carlson et al.,
2014). Then, we calculate the correlations between
subjects’ neural responses when viewing words and
three types of word representations: skip-gram word
embeddings, primary visual features, and visual
semantic vectors. The goal of doing this is to in-
vestigate whether these representations can account
for the brain data and the functional selectivity of
different cortex areas. Then, we utilize behavioural
data as the semantic ground truth to measure the
semantic relevance of brain activity. A method of
estimating word embeddings within the constraints
of similar brain activities is proposed. This method
is based on the semantic word embedding (SWE)
model (Liu et al., 2015) which develops from the
skip-gram model. It aims at verifying whether textu-
al data and brain activity data can be complementary
to derive word embeddings that are more consistent
with human judgement.

The contributions of this study are twofold. First,
this study involved a comprehensive correlation
analysis on brain activity data and state-of-the-art
skip-gram word embeddings at both whole-brain
and brain lobe levels. Primary visual features
and visual semantic vectors are also introduced
as auxiliary representations to better understand
the functional selectivity across the cortex. Some
results of this analysis are interpretable using
existing neuroscience knowledge. Second, to our
knowledge, this study marks the first attempt to
integrate brain activity data into the skip-gram
model for estimating word embeddings. The
experimental results show that the correlation

between the estimated word embeddings and the
behavioural measure of semantics can be effectively
improved after integrating brain activity data for
learning.

2 Related work

The correlation between brain data and word vectors
has been studied in previous work. The experiments
in Carlson et al. (2014) adopted brain activity data
for correlation analysis from only the ventral tempo-
ral pathway, not from the whole brain. Anderson et
al. (2013) performed correlation analysis using the
voxels of the whole brain and compared the HAL-
based textual semantic model (Lund and Burgess,
1996) with the BoVW-based visual semantic model
(Sivic and Zisserman, 2003; Csurka et al., 2004) in
terms of these two model’s ability to account for
the patterns found in the neural data. However,
the experiments in Anderson et al. (2013) failed to
detect differential interactions of semantic models
with brain areas. In this paper, considering the
popularity of word embedding estimation approach-
es based on neural networks in recent years, we
adopt skip-gram word embeddings (Mikolov et al.,
2013a) for correlation analysis. To our knowledge,
this is the first time that the association between
skip-gram word embeddings and brain activity data
have been studied. Furthermore, our work improves
on the voxel selection strategy used in Anderson
et al. (2013), leading to more interpretable results
when demonstrating the functional selectivity of
brain areas.

To our knowledge, the first and only attempt
to integrate brain activity data into the acquisition
of textual word embedding is the JNNSE method
(Fyshe et al., 2014). In this method, word em-
beddings were estimated as latent representations
using matrix factorization. The objective functions
contained additional constraints for reconstructing
brain activity data. In this paper, we adopt the
SWE model (Liu et al., 2015) to incorporate brain
activity knowledge into word embedding estimation.
The SWE model was developed from the skip-gram
model. In SWE, semantically related knowledge
is converted into inequality constraints for learning
word embeddings. The experimental results show
that our proposed method using SWE can improve

670



the semantic consistency between word embeddings
and human judgements.

3 From Skip-Gram to SWE

3.1 Skip-gram model
The skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) adopts
a neural network structure to derive the distributed
representation of words from textual corpus. The
word vectors are learned based on the distribution-
al hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Miller and Charles,
1991), which assumes that words with similar con-
texts tend to have similar semantic meanings. For
a sequence of training data of T words, denoted
as {w1, w2, w3, · · · , wT }, the skip-gram model is
trained to maximize the following objective function

Q =
1

T

T∑

t=1

∑

−c≤j≤c,j 6=0
log p(wt+j |wt), (1)

where wt and ww+j are the central word and neigh-
bouring words in a context window respectively, and
c denotes the size of the context window. The condi-
tional probability p(wt+j |wt) in Eq.(1) is calculated
as

p(wt+j |wt) =
exp(w(2)t+j · w

(1)
t )

∑V
k=1 exp(w

(2)
k · w

(1)
t )

, (2)

where w(1)t and w
(2)
k denote row vectors in the

matrices W(1) and W(2) respectively, and V is
the vocabulary size of the corpus. The matrix
W(1) stores the word vectors of input central words,
and the matrix W(2) stores the word vectors of
predicted neighbouring words. The optimization of
the objective function Q is solved by the stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) method (Mikolov et al.,
2013b). Finally, the learned matrix W(1) is used as
the estimated word embeddings of all words in the
vocabulary.

3.2 Semantic word embedding (SWE)
The skip-gram model learns word embeddings
based on the distributional hypothesis; however, this
hypothesis still has some limitations. For example,
antonyms often appear in similar contexts although
they have opposite meanings. The semantic word
embedding (SWE) model (Liu et al., 2015) has

been proposed to address this issue by incorporating
external semantic knowledge into the text-based
learning process for word embeddings.

In this method, semantic knowledge is repre-
sented as a set of ranking inequalities. Each in-
equality contains a triplet (i, j, k) of three words
{wi, wj , wk} with a similarity relation

similarity(wi, wj) > similarity(wi, wk), (3)

which can be notated in simplified form as sij > sik.
Then, the learning method of SWE is defined as the
following constrained optimization problem

{W(1),W(2)} = arg max
W(1),W(2)

Q(W(1),W(2)),

s.t. sij > sik,∀(i, j, k) ∈ S, (4)

where function Q is defined in Eq. (1) and S
denotes the inequality set. Then, the constrained
optimization problem in Eq. (4) is simplified into
an unconstrained problem by introducing a penalty
term into the objective function of the skip-gram
model. The penalty term is defined as

D =
∑

(i,j,k)∈S
f(i, j, k), (5)

where f(i, j, k) = max(0, sik − sij) is a Hinge
loss function. Finally, the object function to be
maximized in SWE can be written as follows:

Q′ = Q− β ·D, (6)

where β is a parameter to control the contribution
of the penalty term. Similar to the skip-gram model,
theQ′ function in the SWE model is optimized using
SGD to estimate word embeddings. The detailed
formulae can be found in Liu et al. (2015).

3.3 Integrating brain activity into SWE
In the implementation of the SWE model in Liu et al.
(2015), the ranking inequalities were collected us-
ing hypernym-hyponym and synonym-antonym re-
lationships extracted from WordNet (Fellbaum and
others, 1998). In this paper, the SWE model is
utilized as a tool to explore the semantic relevance of
brain activity by examining the performance of the
estimated word embeddings after integrating brain-
activity-related knowledge. Therefore, we construct

671



the ranking inequalities in Eq. (3) using brain
activity data. When a subject is viewing a word,
the neural response in the cortex is captured using
fMRI and further stored as a vector. After collecting
the fMRI data for a set of words, the inequalities
in Eq. (3) can be constructed by using a similarity
measure on the neural response vectors of word
pairs. Here, we adopt Pearson correlation as the
similarity measure. The details will be introduced
in Section 5.1.

4 Data

4.1 Brain data
The fMRI data used in our experiments was record-
ed and preprocessed by Mitchell et al. (2008). It
includes the recorded data of 9 subjects. To record
the data, each of 60 concrete nouns was presented
visually to each subject with a textual label and a
simple line drawing. The subjects were asked to
think about the properties of the objects indicated
by the words during fMRI scanning. This procedure
repeated 6 times, and the stimuli of the 60 nouns
were presented in a random order in each run. More
details about the data acquisition and preprocessing
procedures can be found in Mitchell et al. (2008)
and its supplement materials. Finally, an fMRI
vector measuring the neural response at all voxels
across the cortex was created for each word and each
subject.

4.2 Behavioural data
The behavioural data collects human judgements on
the semantic similarity between word pairs. The
approach to behavioural data collection in our exper-
iment is similar to the one used in the WordSim-353
dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2001). For the 60 concrete
nouns used in Section 4.1, we obtained C260 =
1, 770 word pairs. Then, we asked 15 participants
to score the semantic similarity of each word pair
on a scale from 0 to 10, in which “0” signified
that the two words were totally unrelated and “10”
signified that the two words were highly related or
had identical meanings. This collection procedure
was conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk1

crowdsourcing platform. We tested the average
Spearman correlation coefficient among the scores

1http://www.mturk.com/

given by different annotators and found that it was
approximately 0.4873 with a p-value of 1.1e-02.
After gathering the scores for all the word pairs,
the highest and lowest scores for each word pair
were discarded, and the average of the remaining 13
scores was calculated as the similarity score for each
word pair2.

To verify the reliability of the above data col-
lection process, we also added 15 word pairs from
the WordSim-353 dataset into our 1,770 word pairs
during score collection. Then, we calculated the
similarity scores of these 15 word pairs using the
collected scores and compared them with the scores
in the WordSim-353 dataset using Spearman cor-
relation analysis. The correlation coefficient was
0.8451 with a p-value of 2.7e − 04. This high
correlation verifies the reliability of our behavioural
data collection.

5 Experiments

5.1 Correlations between brain activity and
word vectors

We calculated the correlations between the fMRI
vectors and the different types of word represen-
tations to investigate whether these representations
can account for the brain activity and the functional
selectivity of different cortex areas. We adopted
the method of representational similarity analysis
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) in our experiments. For
a specific word representation, we calculated the
cosine similarity for each word pair in a set of n
words, resulting in a similarity vector with a total
length of C2n. For the fMRI data

3, we constructed
a similarity vector for each subject using the Pear-
son correlation coefficients between pairs of fMRI
vectors (Anderson et al., 2013). Then, the 9 vectors
of the 9 subjects were averaged to obtain an overall
similarity vector in the fMRI space (Anderson et
al., 2013). Finally, the Spearman rank correlation
coefficient between the similarity vectors given by
the fMRI data and each word representation was
calculated together with a p-value for significance

analysis. The p-value was calculated using a per-
mutation test under a positive hypothesis with the
word pair labels randomly shuffled 10,000 times.
Empirically, two similarity vectors are considered
to be correlated when p < 0.05, and they are
considered significantly correlated when p < 0.01.

5.1.1 Word vectors
Three types of word representations, i.e., skip-

gram word embeddings, visual semantic vectors,
and primary visual features, were used in the
correlation analysis. Some details about the
acquisitions of these three word representations will
be introduced in the following paragraphs.

Skip-gram word embeddings The Wikipedia
text corpus4, containing 130 million words, was
adopted to train our skip-gram word embeddings,
and the hierarchical softmax scheme was followed.
The dimension of word embedding was 200. The
window size, learning rate, and negative sampling
number were set to 8, 0.05, and 8, respectively. The
model was trained for one iteration using a single
execution thread.

Visual semantic vectors On one hand, distributed
word representations are usually learnt from text
corpora. On the other hand, visual perception also
contributes to semantic cognition according to
some neuroscience research (Louwerse, 2011), and
it has been utilized to complement the semantic
representation learned from texts (Bruni et al.,
2012). One approach to constructing visual
semantic vectors is to first extract the low-level
visual features from images and then convert them
into higher-level semantic representations using the
bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) (Grauman and Leibe,
2011) model. In our experiments, we built the
BoVW representations from ImageNet (Deng et al.,
2009) using the VSEM5 toolkit. Due to coverage
limitations, only 57 of the 60 concrete nouns
in the fMRI data could be found in ImageNet6

and each noun has approximately 1000 image
samples. Similar to Anderson et al. (2013), we
adopted the Scale Invariant Feature Transform

4http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip
5http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/vsem/
6The three missing words are arm, eye and saw.

(SIFT) (Lowe, 2004) to extract lower-level visual
features; however, we did not use the “object”
box to discriminate “object” and “context” areas
during the extraction. Then, we clustered the SIFT
features into 1000 classes to construct the visual
vocabulary, and each image was divided into 8
regions. Thus, the BoVW representation of an
image was a vector of 8000 dimensions. The BoVW
vectors of all images in ImageNet corresponding to
the same word were averaged to obtain the BoVW
representation of that word. Finally, we transformed
the BoVW representation matrix of the 57 nouns to
nonnegative point-wise mutual information (PMI)
association scores (Church and Hanks, 1990) to
obtain the final visual semantic vectors.

Primary visual features As introduced in
Section 4.1, a line drawing of each word was
presented to subjects together with the textual
label when collecting the fMRI data (Mitchell
et al., 2008). This presentation led to neural
responses in visual cortices that may be irrelevant
to semantic representation. Because the receptive
fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex
of mammalian brains can be modelled by Gabor
functions (Marĉelja, 1980; Daugman, 1985), we
adopted Gabor wavelets to extract the primary visual
features from the line drawings of the 60 nouns
and further analysed their correlations with fMRI
data. The original resolution of the image stimuli
used in Mitchell et al. (2008) was 500 x 500 pixels.
These images were converted to 64 x 64 pixels after
trimming the black borders and downsampling.
The Gabor wavelet filter bank was designed using
an open source tool (Haghighat et al., 2015). The
number of scales and orientations were set to 5 and
8, respectively. Thus, we represented the primary
visual features of each noun as a vector of 163,840
dimensions. The singular value decomposition
(SVD) technique was employed to reduce the
dimension of each vector to 60.

5.1.2 Correlation analysis at the whole-brain
level

The fMRI recording measures the neural respons-
es of more than 20,000 voxels across the cortex. To
perform dimensionality reduction, we selected 500
voxels from all voxels for each subject according to

673



word representation rho (p-value)

BoVW 0.3515 (0.0e-00)

the stability of the voxel responses across 6 runs of
fMRI recordings. This selection strategy was the
same as the one used in Mitchell et al. (2008) and
Anderson et al. (2013). The correlation analysis
followed the method described at the beginning of
Section 5.1. Table 1 shows the results, where skip-
gram, BoVW, and Gabor denote the skip-gram word
embeddings, visual semantic vectors, and primary
visual features introduced above, respectively.

As Table 1 shows, the visual semantic vectors and
primary visual features are significantly correlated
with the fMRI vectors at the whole-brain level;
however, the skip-gram word embeddings are not
correlated with the fMRI data. To investigate the
reason for this lack of correlation, we analysed the
distribution of the 500 selected voxels across the
four brain lobes (i.e., frontal, temporal, parietal and
occipital) using the automated anatomical labeling
scheme (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). From the
results shown in Table 2, we can find that most of
the selected voxels are located in the occipital lobe
although it is the smallest of the four main lobes
in the human brain. The occipital lobe occupies
most of the anatomical area of the visual cortex and
is considered to be the visual processing centre of
the mammalian brain. This unbalanced distribution
led to the conclusion that the semantic information
related to skip-gram word embeddings is not well
represented by the 500 selected voxels. Thus, an al-

ternative strategy to select stable voxels at the brain
lobe level for correlation analysis was necessary.

5.1.3 Correlation analysis at the brain lobe
level

As an alternative approach, rather than selecting
the 500 most stable voxels from the whole-brain
data as in (Mitchell et al., 2008; Anderson et al.,
2013), we selected the 100 most stable voxels at
each of the four main brain lobes independently for
this experiment. Then, the correlations between the
fMRI vectors measuring different lobes and word
representations were calculated and are shown in
Table 3.

From this table, we can observe the association
differences of different word representations with
brain lobe level activities. First, the primary visual
features (Gabor) are highly correlated with the oc-
cipital fMRI data and are uncorrelated with the other
three lobes. This is reasonable considering that the
primary visual cortex (V1) is located in the occipital
lobe. Second, the skip-gram word embeddings are
significantly correlated with the fMRI data of all
brain lobes except the occipital lobe. Previous
neuroscience research has revealed that the frontal,
temporal, and parietal lobes all play important roles
in semantic cognition, including high-level and ab-
stract knowledge processing (Miller et al., 2002),
integration of lexical information (Hagoort, 2005),
speech comprehension (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007),
and knowledge retrieval (Binder et al., 2009). This
indicates that the skip-gram word embeddings can
partly account for the semantic processing in the
cortex and contain little visual information about
words. Third, the visual sematic vectors (BoVW)
are significantly correlated with all four brain lobes.
It has been found that the temporal lobe plays a
key role in both the formation of long-term visual
memories (Smith and Kosslyn, 2007) and in the
recognition of visual stimuli and objects (Chao et
al., 1999; Kanwisher and Yovel, 2006). The parietal
lobe is relevant to high-level vision and is part
of the dorsal visual stream correlated with spatial
cognition (Sack, 2009; Vannini et al., 2004). This
indicates that the visual sematic vectors used in our
experiment may contain not only low-level but also
high-level and semantically related visual informa-
tion.

5.2 Correlations between brain activity and
behavioural data

After analysing the correlation between brain activi-
ty and the three types of word vectors in the previous
experiments, we further examined the correlations
between brain activity and the behavioural data
introduced in Section 4.2. Here, the behavioural data
were used as the semantic ground truth to evaluate
the semantic relevance of the brain activity and word
embeddings. The results are shown in Table 4. In
this subsection, the fMRI data at the whole-brain
and brain lobe levels adopted the voxel selection
strategies introduced in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3,
respectively. As Table 4 shows, the behavioural data
are significantly correlated with the fMRI data of the
whole brain and the occipital lobe, and they are also
correlated with the fMRI data of the temporal and
parietal lobes.

Furthermore, we utilized the SWE model in-
troduced in Section 3.2 to explore the semantic
relevance of brain activity by examining the per-
formance of the estimated word embeddings after
integrating brain activity related knowledge. The
inequality set used in Eq. (3) was created using the
fMRI data, where the similarity score sij was calcu-
lated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between
the fMRI vectors of the i-th and the j-th words. For
the 60 nouns (a total of 12 categories with 5 words
in each category), we produced 12× 3× C35 = 360

Figure 1: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients

different β values and the behavioural data of two
datasets.

intra-category inequalities and 3×C312 = 660 inter-
category inequalities. To collect the inter-category
inequalities, we first used the label words of each
category and averaged the fMRI vectors of the 5
words belonging to each category to obtain the fMRI
data for these label words. Then, the inter-category
inequalities were produced from the triplets of these
label words. The text corpus and parameter settings
we used to train SWE were the same as those
used for training the skip-gram word embeddings as
described in Section 5.1.1. The penalty term β in
Eq. (6) was tuned through experiments.

We evaluated the word embeddings estimated
with brain activity constraints using the collected
behavioural data for the 60 nouns and the WordSim-
353 dataset. WordSim-353 is a behavioural dataset
containing semantic similarity scores for 353 word-
pairs (Finkelstein et al., 2001). We checked to
ensure these word-pairs have no overlap with the
60 nouns used in our experiments. The purpose
of using the WordSim-353 dataset is to explore the
effects of utilizing the brain data of the 60 nouns on
other words for which we had no brain data.

JNNSE 0.3006 0.1795

Table 5: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients
between different word embeddings and the be-
havioural data of the two datasets.

The performance of the word embeddings esti-
mated using the SWE model and the whole-brain
fMRI data are shown in Figure 1. In this figure,
the SWE model becomes a conventional skip-gram
model when β = 0. The correlation coefficient
between the skip-gram word embeddings and the
behavioural data of the 60 nouns was 0.2232. As β
was increased, this correlation coefficient increased
significantly. The maximum correlation efficient
was 0.3814 when β = 2.8. This result implies
that textual data and brain activity data can be
used in a complementary fashion to derive word
embeddings that are more consistent with human
judgements. On one hand, semantic patterns may
exist in neural representations that have not been
fully captured by state-of-the-art word embeddings
derived from text corpora. On the other hand, we can
see that the variation of the correlation coefficients
for the WordSim-353 dataset with different β values
is small. This indicates that our SWE training did-
n’t negatively affect the word embeddings without
fMRI observations.

Furthermore, we produced ranking inequalities
using the fMRI data measuring each brain lobe to
estimate word embeddings under the SWE frame-
work. The correlations between the learned word
embeddings and the behavioural data of the two
datasets were calculated and are shown in Table 5.
For each SWE model in this table, the value of β
was tuned to obtain the highest correlation on the
60 nouns. Comparing the correlation coefficients of
the different models on the 60 nouns, we can see
that the fMRI data at all brain lobes can contribute
to learning more semantically related word embed-
dings using the SWE model. The improvement from

using the fMRI data of the temporal lobe is the most
significant among the four lobes, but the highest
correlation coefficient is achieved when utilizing the
fMRI data of whole brain.

Finally, we compared the performance of our
SWE models with the JNNSE model proposed
by Fyshe et al. (2014) on the two datasets. The
word embeddings estimated by the JNNSE model
utilized either fMRI or magnetoencephalography
(MEG) measures of the 60 nouns. We adopted
the best JNNSE word embeddings reported by the
authors7 for these comparisons, and the results
are shown in the last row of Table 58. As Table
5 shows, the performance of the JNNSE word
embeddings on the WordSim-353 dataset is not as
good as those of the skip-gram and SWE results.
Examining the correlation coefficients on the 60
nouns with brain activity data, we can see that the
JNNSE model achieves better performance than
the skip-gram model, but is still below that of the
SWE models. It should be noted that it is unfair to
directly compare the SWE models and the JNNSE
model because they used different training corpora
and word embedding dimensions. Moreover, the β
values of the SWE models were tuned to achieve
the best performance on these 60 nouns. Here, the
motivation behind introducing the JNNSE model as
a reference is to help readers better understand the
effects of integrating brain data into SWE training.
These experimental results demonstrate that the
SWE model is an effective model structure for
integrating external knowledge into the estimation
of word embeddings.

6 Conclusion

This study utilized word embeddings to investigate
the semantic representations in brain activity as
measured by fMRI. First, the functional selectivity
of different cortex areas is explored by calculating
the correlations between neural responses and three
types of word vectors: skip-gram word embeddings,
visual semantic vectors, and primary visual features.

8Because there were 32 word-pairs in the WordSim-353
dataset that were not covered by the vocabulary of the JNNSE
word embeddings, the value 0.1795 in the last row of Table 5
was calculated using only 321 word-pairs.

Experimental results demonstrate the differences
between the associations of different word vectors
with brain-lobe-level brain activities. The skip-
gram word embeddings are significantly correlated
with the fMRI data of all brain lobes except the
occipital lobe. Furthermore, we utilized behavioural
data as the semantic ground truth to measure its
relevance to brain activity. The SWE model was
employed to explore the semantic relevance of brain
activity by examining the performances of word
embeddings after integrating brain-activity-related
knowledge into their estimations. Experimental
results show that whole-brain fMRI data are sig-
nificantly correlated with human judgement with
respect to semantic similarity. The correlations
between the estimated word embeddings and the
human-assigned similarity scores are effectively im-
proved after integrating brain activity data into SWE
training.

The experiments in this paper provide information
about how semantic features correlate with brain ac-
tivities, laying foundations for further investigations
of higher-level semantic processing in the human
brain. Furthermore, our experiments with SWE
modelling show the potential of applying fMRI
data to obtain better word embeddings. Although
this approach is still far from being a practical
engineering application due to issues such as the
high costs and low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI
recordings and the diversity among individuals, it
provides us with an alternative method for verifying
the semantic relevance of brain activities and with
evidence for recognizing the limitations of estimat-
ing word embeddings using only text corpora.
