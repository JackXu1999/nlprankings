Abstract 

This work presents a comparative evaluation 
among three different Spanish segmentation 
strategies for Spanish-Chinese transliteration. 
The transliteration task is implemented by 
means of Statistical Machine Translation, us-
ing Chinese characters and Spanish sub-word 
segments as the textual units to be translated. 
Three different Spanish segmentation strate-
gies are evaluated: character-based, syllabic-
based and a proposed sub-syllabic segmenta-
tion scheme. Experimental results show that 
syllabic-based segmentation is the most effec-
tive strategy for Spanish-to-Chinese translit-
eration, while the proposed sub-syllabic seg-
mentation is the most effective scheme in the 
case of Chinese-to-Spanish transliteration.  

1 Introduction 
Transliteration can be defined as the process of 
transcribing a word from one language to another 
by using the characters of the latter’s alphabet. 
This actually constitutes a “phonetic translation 
of names across languages” (Zhang et al., 2011). 
Transliteration is typically used to construct ap-
propriate translations for words that either do not 
have specific equivalents or are inexistent in the 
target language, such as, for instance, names of 
people, institutions or geographical locations. 

Although they are conceptually similar tasks, 
technically speaking, translation and translitera-
tion exhibit some important differences. For in-
stance, while translation mainly operates at the 
word level, transliteration does it at the sub-word 
level. Perhaps, the most important difference is 
the fact that in the transliteration task, reordering 
of units is not required. As in the case of transla-
tion, transliteration results are not necessarily 
unique, i.e. one word might have different valid 
transliterations. 

 The transliteration task can be approached 
from either a rule-based or a statistical perspec-
tive, but in any case, the problem can be theo-
retically grounded on Finite-state Automata The-
ory (Knight, 2009). Several different approaches 
to transliteration have been proposed in the lit-
erature (Arbabi et al., 1994; Divay and Vitale, 
1997; Knight and Graehl, 1998; Al-Onaizan and 
Knight, 2002; Li et al., 2004; Tao et al., 2006; 
Yoon et al., 2007; Jansche and Sproat, 2009) 
covering specific transliteration tasks between 
English and a large variety of languages such as 
Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998), French (Di-
vay and Vitale, 1997), Arabic (Arbabi et al., 
1994; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), Chinese 
(Ren et al., 2009; Kwong, 2009), Hindi (Chinna-
kotla and Damani, 2009; Das et al., 2009; Haque 
et al., 2009), Tamil (Vijayanand, 2009) and Ko-
rean (Hong et al., 2009), among others.  

Nevertheless, despite of the large body of re-
search on automatic transliteration, and as far as 
we are concerned, there have not been research 
efforts reported on this area for the specific case 
of Spanish and Chinese. According to this, the 
main objective of this work is twofold: first, to 
create an experimental dataset for transliteration 
between Chinese and Spanish; and, second, to 
report some research results on transliteration 
tasks between these two languages. 

The remaining of the paper is structured as 
follows. First, in section 2, the main technical 
issue evaluated in this work, which is the seg-
mentation of Spanish words into sub-word units, 
is introduced and motivated. Then, in section 3, 
the selected SMT-based approach for Chinese-
Spanish transliteration, is described. In section 4, 
the creation of an experimental dataset for Chi-
nese-Spanish transliteration is described in detail. 
In section 5, experimental results are presented 
and discussed. Finally, in section 6, main conclu-
sions and future research ideas are provided.

2 Spanish Word Segmentation 
The concept of isochronism in language was first 
introduced by Pike (1945). Three types of rhyt-
hmic patterns can be distinguished: stress-timed, 
syllable-timed and mora-timed. Although this 
theory has not been fully accepted, there is some 
accepted empirical evidence that both Spanish 
(Pamies Bertran, 1999) and Chinese (Lin and 
Wang, 2007) belong to the syllable-timed rhyth-
mic group. 

In the case of Chinese, syllabic segmentation 
is naturally induced by the basic association be-
tween the characters and their corresponding 
sounds. On the contrary, in the case of Spanish, 
as well as many other western languages, syl-
labic segmentation is a phonetic property that 
does not exhibit a direct or explicit association 
with orthographic properties of the language.  

According to this, syllabic segmentation or 
syllabification constitutes a problem of interest in 
some natural language processing applications. 
This problem can be addressed by means of ei-
ther rule-based or data-driven approaches (Adsett 
et al., 2009). Syllabification algorithms based on 
finite-state transducers have been proposed for 
languages such as English and German (Kiraz 
and Mobius, 1998). For the effects of the present 
work, we implemented our own rule-based syl-
labic segmentation algorithm for Spanish by fol-
lowing the work of Cuayahuitl (2004). 

Three different strategies for Spanish word 
segmentation are studied in this work with the 
objective of determining the most appropriate 
segmentation scheme for Chinese-Spanish trans-
literation. These three strategies are: character 
segmentation (the simple division of a word in 
characters), syllabic segmentation (the division 
of a word according to Spanish syllabic phonetic 
units) and an intermediate segmentation to be 
referred to as sub-syllabic segmentation. The rest 
of this section is devoted to motivate and explain 
this latter segmentation scheme.       

The main motivation for the proposed sub-
syllabic segmentation of Spanish words is the 
observed fact that, although they agree in most of 
the cases, syllabifications can often differ be-
tween Spanish and Chinese transliterated names. 
Consider, for instance, the examples presented in 
Figure 1. The first two examples illustrate cases 
in which the Chinese name contains less sylla-
bles than the corresponding Spanish name. On 
the other hand, the last three examples illustrate 
cases in which the Chinese name contains more 
syllables than the corresponding Spanish name.  

 
 

Figure 1. Some examples of Chinese-Spanish 
name transliterations  

 
A detailed analysis on the syllabic length ra-

tios between Chinese and Spanish names on our 
experimental dataset (more details on the dataset 
are provided in section 4) reveals that the most 
common situation is that both Chinese and Span-
ish names have the same number of syllables. 
This occurs in about 75% of the cases. From the 
remaining 25% of cases, about 15% (and 10%) 
correspond to cases in which the Chinese ver-
sions of the names contain more (and less) sylla-
bles than their corresponding Spanish versions. 

Further analysis show that some clear patterns 
for sub-syllabic segmentation can be observed in 
those cases of Chinese transliterations containing 
more syllables than their corresponding Spanish 
versions, which is not the case for the opposite 
situation. Some of these patterns include the 
segmentation of Spanish diphthongs such as ue 
into u-e, which will generate the more appropri-
ate segmentation sa-mu-el for the fourth example 
in Figure 1; the separation of some multiple con-
sonant constructions such as br into b-r, which 
will provide the more appropriate segmentation 
a-b-ra-ham; and the separation of some ending 
consonants such as as into a-s, which will gener-
ate e-li-a-s. This sub-syllabic segmentation strat-
egy is expected to improve the performance of 
the transliteration task as it both reduces the vo-
cabulary size of Spanish syllabic units and im-
proves syllable correspondences between Chi-
nese and Spanish. The complete set and sequence 
of rules implemented for sub-syllabic segmenta-
tion is presented in Figure 2. 

Notice that the proposed sub-syllabic segmen-
tation strategy is only addressing those cases in 
which the Chinese versions of the names contain 
more syllables than their corresponding Spanish 

42



versions. Addressing the opposite case, would 
require instead the definition of rules for merging 
consecutive Spanish syllables. We have not con-
sidered this case because of two reasons: first, 
according to our exploratory analysis of the data, 
it does not seem to be clear patterns for syllabic 
merging; and, second, a merging strategy would 
lead to an increment of the vocabulary of Span-
ish Syllabic units, which is not desirable in terms 
of the resulting transliteration model sparseness. 
 

 
 
Figure 2. Rules and their sequence of application 

for sub-syllabic segmentation 
 

Notice that, those cases in which the Chinese 
versions of the names contain less syllables than 
their corresponding Spanish versions are basi-
cally unaddressed by our proposed segmentation 
strategy. This, however, should not constitute a 
problem in the case of Spanish-to-Chinese trans-
literation as the transliteration model just should 
be required to learn how to throw away some 
Spanish syllables. On the other hand, this cer-
tainly posses a problem for the case of Chinese-
to-Spanish transliteration as the transliteration 
model must be able to generate Spanish syllables 
from no Chinese correspondents. However, we 
still expect an overall gain as the former case is 
more common that the latter one. 

3 Transliteration Approach  
For implementing the transliteration system, we 
have used the Phrase-Based Statistical Machine 
Translation approach, which has been proven to 
be a good strategy for transliteration (Noeman, 
2009; Jia et al., 2009). Within this approach, 
transliteration is performed as a machine transla-
tion task over substring units of both the source 
and the target languages. More specifically, we 
use the MOSES toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). 

Although several parameters can be varied in 
order to study their effect over the overall trans-
literation performance, we will focus our study in 
three specific parameters, which we consider 
could have the largest incidence, as well as make 
an important difference, on quality for both 
transliterations directions under consideration: 
Spanish-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-Spanish.    

The first parameter of interest is substring 
segmentation. Although we only consider Chi-
nese characters as substring units for Chinese; in 
the case of Spanish, we consider three different 
types of substring units according to the three 
segmentation schemes described in the previous 
section. More specifically, characters, syllables 
and the proposed sub-syllabic units are consid-
ered for Spanish. 

The other two parameters to be considered for 
evaluation purposes are the order of the target 
language model and the alignment strategy used 
for phrase extraction. In the case of the target 
language model, four different orders are com-
pared, namely: 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-
gram; and in the case of the alignment strategy, 
three different methods are compared, namely: 
source-to-target, target-to-source and grow-diag-
final-and (Koehn et al., 2007).  

According to this, our experimental work in-
volves the construction of 72 different translit-
eration systems, by considering 2 transliteration 
directions, 3 Spanish segmentation schemes, 4 
target language model orders, and 3 alignment 
strategies. In each of these transliteration sys-
tems, the standard set of phrase-based features, 
which include the forward and backward relative 
frequencies and lexical models, as well as the 
target language and phrase-length penalty mod-
els, are used. 

As evaluation metric for assessing translitera-
tion quality we use the BLEU score (Papineni et 
al., 2001). In the case of Spanish-to-Chinese 
transliterations, BLEU is computed at the Chi-
nese character level. Similarly, and in order to 
make results among all three different Spanish 
segmentation schemes comparable, in the case of 
Chinese-to-Spanish transliterations, BLEU is 
computed at the character level too.  

Finally, each of the implemented systems is 
tuned by means of the minimum error rate train-
ing procedure (Och, 2003), in which the BLEU 
score is minimized over a development dataset. 
Final system scores are computed over a test 
dataset, which is transliterated by using the tuned 
parameters. More details on the datasets are pro-
vided in the following section.

4 Dataset Construction  
As no named entity dataset is available for trans-
literation purposes between Spanish and Chinese, 
the first objective of this work was the creation 
of such a dataset. Despite the fact that Chinese 
and Spanish are the most spoken native lan-
guages in the word, the amount of bilingual re-
sources for this specific language pair happens to 
be very scarce (Costa-jussa et al. 2011). 

According to this, we used one of the few bi-
lingual resources that are available, the Holy Bi-
ble (Table 1 presents the basic statistics for this 
dataset), for constructing an experimental dataset 
for transliteration research purposes.

Spanish 29,887 848,776 13,126 

 
Table 1. Basic statistics of the Bible dataset  

  
In his section we present a description of the 

procedure followed for creating the dataset, as 
well as the basic statistics and characteristics of 
the constructed dataset. 

The construction of the experimental dataset 
for transliteration can be summarized according 
to the following steps: 

 
• A list of named entities was extracted 

from the Spanish side of the dataset. This 
extraction was conducted by using a stan-
dard labeling approach based on Condi-
tional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 
2001). From this step a list of 1,608 Span-
ish names were collected. 

 
• A reduced list of named entities was gen-

erated by manually filtering the original 
list. In this process some errors derived 
from the first automatic step were re-
moved, as well as any valid name entity 
not belonging to the two basic categories 
of persons and places. In this second step, 
the list was reduced to 948 names. 

 
• The corresponding Chinese versions of the 

names were extracted from the Chinese 
side of the dataset. This was done auto-
matically by aligning both corpus at the 
word level (Och and Ney, 2000), and us-
ing the alignment links to identify the cor-
responding transliteration candidates for 
each Spanish name in the list. 

• The automatically extracted list of corre-
sponding Chinese names was manually 
depurated. Because of the noisy nature of 
the alignment process, in several cases ei-
ther more than one Chinese word was as-
signed to the same Spanish names or an 
erroneous Chinese word was selected. Af-
ter this second filtering processing, the fi-
nal bilingual list of 841 names was ob-
tained.    

 
For the preparation of the experimental dataset 

each side of the resulting corpus was segmented 
as follows: Chinese data was segmented at the 
character level, and Spanish data was segmented 
by following the three segmentation schemes 
described in section 2: character-based, syllable-
based and sub-syllabic.  

Two additional normalization processes were 
applied to the Spanish dataset: lowercasing and 
stress mark elimination. The total number of sub-
string units and their vocabulary for each of the 
constructed versions of the dataset are presented 
in Table 2. 

 
Dataset Names Substrings Vocab. 
Chinese 841 2,190 314 

Spa (char) 841 4,766 24 
Spa (sub) 841 3,005 108 
Spa (syl) 841 2,165 491 

 
Table 2. Names, substring units and vocabulary 
of substring units for each constructed dataset  

 
As seen from the table, the tree Spanish word 

segmentations to be studied exhibit significantly 
different properties in terms of the total amount 
of running substrings and the vocabulary size of 
substring units. Indeed, the proposed sub-syllabic 
segmentation strategy represents an intermediate 
compromise in both, substrings and vocabulary, 
between the character-based segmentation and 
the syllabic-based segmentation.   

In order to be able to use the generated dataset 
under the statistical machine translation frame-
work described in section 3, the resulting bilin-
gual dataset of 841 names was finally split into 
three subsets: train (with 691 names), develop-
ment (with 50 names) and test (with 100 names). 

 Although a random sample strategy was used 
for splitting the original corpus into the three 
experimental subsets, special attention was paid 
to not include in the development and test sub-
sets any name that would have produced out-of-
vocabulary substrings.

5 Experimental Results  
In this section we present and discuss the ex-
perimental results corresponding to all 72 im-
plemented transliteration systems. All experi-
ments were conducted over the experimental 
datasets described in section 4 by following the 
procedure described in section 3. Although we 
will focus our analysis on aggregated scores 
computed over different subsets of experiments, 
Tables 3a through 3f present individual system 
scores for all of the 72 implemented translitera-
tion systems.   

As seen from the tables, although individual 
results by themselves could exhibit some degree 
of noise due to the random variability derived 
from both, dataset selection and tuning proc-
esses, some clear and interesting trends can be 
observed form the results. For instance, notice 
how best scores tend to be always associated to 
language model of orders 3 and 4.  

Similarly, it can be derived from the tables 
that the grow-diag-final-and alignment strategy 
tends to be the best alignment strategy only in 
those cases when the Spanish syllabic segmenta-
tion is used. Alternatively, it can be observed that 
in the other two cases, i.e. when Spanish charac-
ter and sub-syllabic segmentations are used, the 
target-to-source alignment strategy is more bene-
ficial for the Spanish-to-Chinese transliteration 
direction while the source-to-target alignment 
strategy happens to be more beneficial for the 
Chinese-to-Spanish direction.   

In order to have a better grasp of the general 
trends in transliteration quality along the dimen-
sions of each of the experimental parameters un-
der consideration, let us now look at the aggre-
gated results along each individual parameter 
variation. In this sense, Figures 3a, 3b and 3c 
summarize transliteration quality variations with 
respect to n-gram order, alignment strategy and 
Spanish segmentation, respectively.  

Let us consider first Figure 3a. This figure 
shows the relative variations of transliteration 
quality with respect to n-gram order. These val-
ues have been computed by aggregating all sys-
tem scores along the alignment strategy and 
Spanish segmentation dimensions for each of the 
two transliteration directions under considera-
tion. Additionally, the resulting scores have been 
normalized with respect to the unigram case. As 
seen from the figure, there is a more critical inci-
dence of the n-gram order on the case of Span-
ish-to-Chinese transliteration than in the opposite 
transliteration direction.

Figure 3c. Transliteration quality variations in 
terms of Spanish segmentation method 

 
It is evident, from Figure 3a, that the translit-

eration tasks does not benefits from n-gram or-
ders larger than 2 in the Chinese-to-Spanish di-
rection, while it certainly does in the Spanish-to-
Chinese case. This result can be explained by the 
larger character vocabulary size of Chinese when 
compared to Spanish segmentations.  

In the case of Figure 3b, aggregation has been 
conducted along the n-gram orders and Spanish 
segmentations. In this case, the resulting scores 
have been normalized with respect to the average 
score value for each transliteration direction. 
While grow-diag-final-and is the best alignment 
strategy for the Spanish-to-Chinese case, source-
to-target alignments also happen to be a good 
strategy in the Chinese-to-Spanish case. Notice, 
however, that relative variation of scores in Fig-
ure 3b is actually very low (about 2%), which 
suggests that the alignment strategy has a low 
incidence on transliteration quality for the tasks 
under consideration. 

Finally, let us consider Figure 3c, where the 
relative variations of transliteration quality with 
respect to the selected Spanish segmentation 
method are depicted. In this cases system scores 
have been aggregated along both the n-gram or-
der and the alignment strategy dimensions, and 
normalized with respect to average scores at each 
transliteration direction. Notice from the figure 
how syllabic segmentation is clearly the best op-
tion in the Spanish-to-Chinese transliteration di-
rection, while the proposed sub-syllabic segmen-
tation constitutes the best alternative in the Chi-
nese-to-Spanish direction.  

This latter interesting result can be explained 
in terms of the mapping functions required to 
map the corresponding substring units from one 
language into the other, as the larger the source 
vocabulary the better the mapping function is. 
So, in the case of the Spanish-to-Chinese task, 
the syllabic segmentation must provide a better 
mapping as it allows for a vocabulary reduction 
mapping, as can be verified from the vocabulary 
column in Table 2. On the other hand, in the 
Chinese-to-Spanish task the proposed method for 
sub-syllabic segmentation is the one providing a 
vocabulary reduction (as can be verified from the 
vocabulary column in Table 2) that allows for a 
better mapping function. 

6 Conclusions and Future Research  
In this work, we have presented a comparative 
evaluation among three different Spanish seg-
mentation strategies for Spanish-Chinese trans-
literation, as well as two other important parame-
ters of the transliteration system implementation: 
target language model order and alignment strat-
egy for bilingual unit extraction. The translitera-
tion task was implemented by means of Statisti-
cal Machine Translation, using Chinese charac-
ters and Spanish sub-word segments as the tex-

46



tual units to be translated. The three different 
Spanish segmentation strategies evaluated were: 
character-based, syllabic-based and a proposed 
sub-syllabic segmentation scheme. Experimental 
results shown that syllabic-based segmentation, 
along with a language model of order 4 and the 
grow-diag-final-and alignment method, consti-
tutes the most effective strategy for Spanish-to-
Chinese transliteration, while the proposed sub-
syllabic segmentation, along with a language 
model of order 2 and the source-to-target align-
ment method, constitutes the most effective 
strategy for Chinese-to-Spanish transliteration.  

As an additional contribution, and due to the 
lack of dataset for Chinese-Spanish translitera-
tion research, we have constructed an experimen-
tal parallel corpus containing a total of 841 
named entities in both Chinese and Spanish. 

As future research work, we intend to expand 
the experimental dataset, as well as to continue 
evaluating the specific peculiarities of both Chi-
nese-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-Chinese translit-
eration tasks. A comprehensive manual evalua-
tion on the experimental results described here 
should be conducted in order to identify both, 
possible improvements to the proposed Spanish 
sub-syllabic segmentation method and some ad-
ditional strategies for improving the performance 
of transliteration quality between Chinese and 
Spanish.
