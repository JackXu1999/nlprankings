Abstract

We explore the challenges of building a computational lexicon for Moroccan Darija (MD), an
Arabic dialect spoken by over 32 million people worldwide that only recently has begun appear-
ing frequently in written form. We raise the question of what belongs in such a lexicon and start by
describing our work building traditional word-level lexicon entries with their English translations.
We then discuss challenges in translating idiomatic MD phrases and the creation of multi-word
expression (MWE) lexicon entries whose meanings could not be fully derived from the individ-
ual words. Finally, we describe our preliminary exploration of constructions for inclusion in an
MD constructicon, initially eliciting translations of established English constructions, and then
shifting to document, when spontaneously offered, variant renderings of native MD counterparts.

1 Introduction

What methods exist to guide the construction of a computational lexicon for a low-resource language that
is widely spoken, but for which there is little reference literature and no standard orthography? We are
interested in the specific case of Moroccan Darija (MD) that is now emerging in the written, informal
contexts of social media. There, we find a wide variety of multi-word expressions (MWEs), including
idioms, that are characterized by semi- or non-compositionality, where their meaning cannot be derived
strictly from their individual words. Such expressions therefore present a significant challenge for Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP), language-learning, and machine translation (MT) tasks, which have
traditionally assumed that the vocabulary of the relevant language is available in a (computational) lexi-
con so that a sentence’s full meaning can be derived from the combined meanings of its individual words.
For MT of under-resourced languages, and MD in particular, available methods assume that translation
proceeds from the source language (SL) by way of entries in a limited bilingual dictionary, into the corre-
sponding target language (TL). In the case of semi- and non-compositional expressions of low-resource
source languages, however, well-established methods do not exist for identification and inclusion of such
expressions in computational lexicons.
As a result, correctly interpreting and translating semi- and non-compositional expressions relies on

first identifying MWEs that function as a unit paired with a particular meaning. Identification can be
facilitated by manually tagging such expressions and incorporating them into lexical resources. How-
ever, incorporation into a lexicon can also come with a variety of challenges, as outlined by Sag et al.
(2002). Fixed idiomatic expressions, such as kick the bucket can be added to a lexicon as a single-entry,
fixed phrase allowing only for minimal morpho-syntactic variation (here, tense), so that the phrase is
treated computationally as if it were a single word (an approach called ’words with spaces’ (Sag et al.,
2002)). However, many other flexible expressions allow for enough variation that listing all alternates
in a computational lexicon can be prohibitively impractical. Similarly, fully syntactic patterns can carry
meaning separate from the constituent parts and be extremely productive, or flexible, in the component
words (e.g., The X-er The Y-er: The more I read, the less I understand; The higher you fly, the harder
you fall). Such pairings of form and meaning, or constructions (Goldberg, 1995), are productive to the

point that listing all possible instantiations of the expression in a static lexicon is not feasible. As an
alternative, these patterns can be listed in a constructicon, or an inventory of constructions in which the
general linguistic patterns are described without specifying all realizations with particular word forms
(Fillmore et al., 2012).
In this research, we begin to address the challenges of semi- and non-compositional MWEs in MD

that arise while building up a MD lexicon consisting of 1) individual MD tokens and their translations,
2) a collection of MD idioms, and 3) a preliminary constructicon listing MD constructions based on an
examination of constructions found in English and their correspondents in MD. Our objective in building
the MD lexicon is to facilitate translation of MD into English and vice-versa. After providing some
background on MD (Section 2), we will describe each portion (1-3 above) of the lexicon in Sections 3-5.
We examine translation in the order of words, idioms, then constructions as this reflects compatibility with
traditional lexicons: words are traditional members of lexicons, some (more fixed) idioms are compatible
with a ‘words-with-spaces’ lexicon entry, and constructions are the least compatible in that they require
an inventory that represents grammatical patterns as opposed to fixed word forms or expressions. Of
current interest is the contribution of a collection of MD idioms; thus, in Section 4 describing the MD
idioms, we provide an analysis of the strategies used to translate idioms as well as a quantitative results
illuminating which strategies were applicable to particular idiom types.

2 Moroccan Darija: an Arabic Dialect

The Arabic language family encompasses many varieties, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and
a large number of regional dialects. Despite being the standard written form of Arabic and appearing in
many formal venues such as news broadcasts and parliamentary speeches, MSA is not the native language
of any Arabic speaker (Bouamor et al., 2014). Instead, typical everyday conversation is conducted in
Arabic dialects (or other languages) rather than MSA. Arabic dialects vary substantially from MSA and
each other, with significant phonological, morphological, and syntactic differences (Brustad, 2002), as
well as in their vocabularies. For example, MSA has been established as VSO, whereas MD is viewed as
SVO (Simons and Fennig, 2018). The dialects have varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, with those
of northwestern Africa (e.g., Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) being particularly challenging to outsiders.
Although Arabic dialects lack orthographic standards and historically have not been written, they now

appear constantly in online social media. Unfortunately, these dialects are severely under-resourced from
a computational perspective, impeding the creation of NLP systems, such as machine translation engines.
MT systems trained on large parallel MSA-English corpora perform substantially worse on dialectal
text than when such systems are trained on significantly smaller Arabic dialect-English parallel corpora
created via crowdsourcing (Zbib et al., 2012), illustrating the need for computational lexical resources
specific to the individual dialects.

3 Traditional Lexicon: Words and Their Translations

The most straightforward component to include in an MD computational lexicon is a traditional word-
level lexicon consisting of words and their translations. For our work, we leverage Hespress.com, a
popular news portal whose reporting covers events in Morocco and other topics of interest to Moroccans.
The articles span numerous domains, including politics, sports, and entertainment. Although the articles
are primarily written in MSA, the commentary is mixed, with many languages/dialects represented, in-
cludingMSA,MD, English, French, and Amazigh. As a first step, we collected a copy of the commentary
available on the Hespress website and filtered out commentary posts that lacked content in Arabic script.1
To isolate posts written primarily in MD, we employed an in-house token-level MD classifier2 to label
the individual tokens3 of the remaining posts as either MD or MSA. We only considered commentary
posts with at least 6 tokens identified as MD and with MD tokens outnumbering MSA tokens by a 4-to-
1 or greater margin. This left us over 128,000 commentary posts identified as primarily MD. We then

1Arabic dialects such as MD also frequently appear in Latin script as “Arabizi” (Yaghan, 2008).
2The full details of this system are beyond the scope of this paper.
3We tokenized the text automatically based on whitespace and punctuation.

had a native Darija speaker translate the 2,000 shortest such commentary posts and provide in-context
token-level glosses. After removing posts written in other languages (e.g., MSA, Amazigh) or containing
offensive content, 1,836 translated posts remained, with a total of 17,261 tokens and 5,528 unique token
types. The 5,528 types have an average of 2.32 glosses per type.
The only machine-readable lexicon for MD we are aware of currently available for comparison is

published by the MADAR (Bouamor et al., 2018) project. The MADAR lexicon is structured around
1,045 concept keys, each of which is defined by a 3-tuple of English, French, and Modern Standard
Arabic (MSA) lexical translations (e.g., {think, penser, َظنَّ }). For each concept key, MADAR had
Arabic dialect translations produced by translators in 25 different cities spanning the Arabic-speaking
world, including two Moroccan cities—Fes and Rabat.
We note substantial overlap with our lexicon. Of the 1,032 unique MD translations provided by

MADAR’s Fes and Rabat translators, 342 correspond to items in our lexicon. However, there are sev-
eral important differences between the two lexicons. For example, the MD entries in MADAR were all
generated in translation from other languages whereas ours were originally produced in MD and then
translated into English. Because of this, our lexicon is likely to contain a variety of morphological and
orthographic variations for the same base word, in contrast to the MADAR lexicon. Also, the MADAR
concept keys were derived from the Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (Takezawa et al., 2007) and, thus,
the lexicon is most relevant to the travel domain. In contrast, our lexicon spans multiple complementary
domains, including politics, sports, and entertainment.

4 More than a Word: Idioms

In the process of creating the word-level lexicon described in Section 3, we encountered numerous idioms.
Idioms pose an intriguing question in the development of a lexicon, as their status straddles the bound-
ary between being compositional and non-compositional in meaning. A central challenge in identifying
and translating idioms is thus pinpointing this variable idiomatic meaning and transferring the semantic,
stylistic, and contextual import of the idiom in question from SL to TL. Here we review several theories
for interpreting idiomatic meaning. We then present the strategies for idiom translation that our trans-
lator found consistently helpful in guiding his work in reference to other established idiom translation
techniques.

4.1 Idiomatic Meaning
Nunberg et al. (1994) analyze idioms for three primary semantic properties: (i) conventionality, mea-
sured by the discrepancy between idiomatic phrasal meaning and the compositional meaning derived
from the individual constituents; (ii) opacity/transparency, or the clarity of motivation for the expression
given its meaning; and (iii) compositionality, understood as the degree to which the phrasal meaning
can be gleaned from the component constituents. Fernando (1996) additionally divides idioms into three
classes, each with distinct measures of these semantic properties and, in turn, distinct implications for
translation. So-called “pure idioms” are opaque, non-literal MWEs that are conventionalized in use and
non-compositional (cf. Sag et al. (2002) for non-decomposable idioms and their syntactic diagnostics);
“semi-idioms” are semi-opaque and have one or more literal constituents and one with a non-literal sub-
sense; and “literal idioms” are transparent expressions that are either invariable or allow little variation
(cf. Sag et al. (2002) for decomposable idioms and their syntactic diagnostics). Facing the task of trans-
lation, these idiom types merit subtly different approaches to both capture their meaning and relate them
to the SL and TL lexicons.
Idioms additionally possess pragmatic levels of meaning external to any semantic (de)composition or

formal linguistic properties (Fillmore et al., 1988; Croft and Cruse, 2004). Speakers know how to use
certain expressions in the correct linguistic context and social situation. This pragmatic knowledge relies
on, but is not viewed, traditionally, as contributing to the semantic interpretation of the original idiomatic
expression itself. Idioms thus raise the question, should this “extra-linguistic” knowledge4 be included
in a computational lexicon?

4Knowledge not included in individual words, rules of grammar, or principles of compositional semantics

4.2 Idiom Translation Strategies
In translating an idiom, the question arises as to whether the translator ought to convey directly the pres-
ence of the idiom by maintaining the original words in literal translations of the SL, while perhaps also
including a historical and cultural explanation. Alternatively, a translator could choose to simply translate
from their understanding of the non-literal, implied meaning, without seeking a comparable idiom in the
TL—that is, in effect removing any trace of the idiom.
Our translator found the work of Baker (1992) a helpful guide in approaching this translation task.

Baker’s four strategies have been employed in several idiom translation studies (cf. Strakšienė, 2009 for
English-Lithuanian and 2010 for English-Russian; Shojaei (2012) for English-Turkish; Akbari (2013)
for English-Persian). These are characterized in the tables below with MD idiom examples, each with a
Romanized, tokenized transliteration, an English token-by-token gloss, and their corresponding English
translation:

1. Translation to an idiom of similar meaning and form. This strategy is used when the SL and TL
possess idioms of the same general meaning and lexical and syntactic content. This correspondence
may occur either because idioms are compositional and transparent in both languages (or “literal”
(Fernando, 1996)); or because the idioms are both non-compositional and opaque, yet convention-
alized (Nunberg et al., 1994), in both languages.

Transliteration ila kana-t dar-ek jaj ma-t-chayar-ch a’la al-nassa bi-l-ah’jar

Gloss if were-it house-your glass not-you-throw-(NEG) at the-people with-the-stones

English Translation People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones

Table 1: Example of idiom-to-idiom translation with preservation of form and meaning

2. Translation to an idiom of similar meaning but dissimilar form. This strategy is used when
idioms in the SL and TL possess the same meaning but utilize different lexical items to convey that
meaning. This correspondence occurs if the syntax available to create idiomatic meaning in one
language is unavailable in the other. Likely, the idioms in SL and TL are “semi-idioms” (Fernando,
1996).

MD Source Text داخل من حاليك كيف برى من المزوق
Transliteration al-mzawaq min barra kif hali-k min dakhil

Gloss the-colorful from outside how situation-your from inside

English Translation Looks can be deceiving

Table 2: Example of idiom-to-idiom with shared meaning but different form

3. Translation by paraphrase. Paraphrase, the most common method to translate idioms (Shojaei,
2012), is employed when a match between SL and TL does not exist, or when it may be infelicitous
to use idiomatic language in TL when it is felicitous in SL. This method is often used when idioms
are opaque and non-compositional semantically; as such the more pragmatic meaning is translated.
This occurs for “pure-idioms” (Fernando, 1996).

4. Translation omitted. Idioms are omitted from TL although present in SL for those cases when there
are no equivalent expressions between the two languages, or when the SL meaning cannot be easily
paraphrased for stylistic or pragmatic reasons.

Baker’s four strategies work in a successivemanner with the ultimate goal of preserving idiommeaning
in the TL. Ideally, translators employ strategy (1), whereby the SL and TL possess idioms similar in both

meaning and form. Given that this is not always possible, translators are instructed to proceed down the
list of strategies to accomplish their task, as our translator did.5

4.3 MD Idioms: Preliminary Results
MD idioms, as found in the informal texts of social media and the commentary posts of our collection,
includes intentionally playful wording, rhymes, and different types of figures of speech. The sentence
structure of idioms may also be uncommon or unusual, though easy to understand. The idioms identified
in our collection are generally non-transparent, i.e., their meaning cannot be derived from the words
they contain. The wording of these idioms also generally does not allow for vocabulary substitutions or
omission. Our translator observed that it is not uncommon for MD idioms to be structured as two-part,
action-reaction expressions, indicating if X happens, then Y happens, resembling the two-part English
construction, The X-er the Y-er.
With our work on creating a MD Lexicon, we isolated a total of 94 sentences with idiomatic expres-

sions. Out of these, 52 were unique or existed in a single form. Of the remaining, two idioms occurred
in nine different forms, one in six different forms, two in four different forms, and five in two different
forms. After removing duplicates, we ended up with 62 unique idioms. A breakdown of which of the
above translation types these idioms fall into is given below.

• Type 1 Translation to an idiom of similar meaning and form: No such cases in this specific collection
were found. We have however found such examples in other data we collected (see Future Work).

• Type 2 Translation to an idiom of similar meaning but dissimilar form: In our example set, nine
idioms out of the set of 62 unique idioms fell into this category.6

• Type 3 Translation by paraphrase: This category formed the overwhelming majority with a total of
51 out of 62 idioms.

• Type 4 Translation omitted: In our example sentences, we had two such cases.

The prevalence of translation by paraphrase is not surprising, given that this is the most common strat-
egy cited in other translation efforts and given the rather extreme typological differences between English
and MD. However, translation by paraphrase likely entails that potentially subtle nuances of meaning of

5Though Baker further identifies a fifth strategy for idiom translation, compensation, whereby idiomatic meaning is recreated
elsewhere in the translated text, we do notmake use of this strategy as our focus is on sentence-level translation and not discourse-
level translation.

6Occasionally two idioms in a language may be used to convey the same meaning, providing translators with further issues
to consider. In MD, for example, الضو وضربك الما هزك and فيها مشيتي are used interchangeably (same underlying meaning)
and would both translate adequately as You’re fresh out of luck., even though individual native MD speakers may differ in their
use of one over the other.



79

the idiom are lost in translation; additionally, for MD in particular, the playfulness of wording and sound
expressed through syntactic form is lost. Although it may be difficult to pinpoint precisely which elements
are lost in translation, there is value in indicating which strategy is used in translation for resources. A
record of a lost idiom is at least an acknowledgment of the fact that there are likely undetermined meaning
differences between the SL idiom and TL paraphrase that can potentially be recovered.

5 Constructions

Another set of challenges for translation comes in the form of constructions. Under a Construction Gram-
mar approach, a construction is defined as any pairing of form and meaning, and therefore includes not
only traditional entries in lexicons, such as morphemes and individual words, but also more complex
forms, such as partially lexically-filled or fixed as well as fully general linguistic patterns (e.g., the previ-
ously mentioned The X-er the Y-er pattern) (Goldberg, 2003). The latter linguistic patterns are of special
interest in this work because these meaning-carrying forms must be first recognized in order to then be
correctly interpreted or translated. Such forms have not been included in many traditional generative
lexicons.7 Translations proceeding on a word-by-word basis would fail to recognize, for example, the
semantics of correlation carried by The X-er the Y-er. This is problematic because, like idioms, the con-
structional semantics may require translation into a different construction or compositional phrasing in
another language. Although idioms can be considered one type of construction, there are additional types
of constructions carrying non-compositional meaning that are generally not included in a listing of idioms
because they are fully general linguistic patterns that can be flexibly and productively filled with a vari-
ety of different lexical items. Constructicons (inventories of constructions) have been developed in some
languages as a resource to facilitate recognition, interpretation and translation of constructions (Fillmore
et al., 2012; Torrent et al., 2014; Bäckström et al., 2014). Here, we provide a preliminary exploration of
constructions that should be considered for an MD constructicon.
A native speaker of MD and author of this paper examined instances of particular motion and degree-

related constructions drawn from the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) corpus (Banarescu
et al., 2013; Bonial et al., 2018). We selected AMR instances of constructions because the corpus
offers a data-driven (as opposed to seeking out instances of a construction; these are constructions that
arose in sentence-by-sentence AMR annotation) variety of annotated examples, which also facilitates a
sense of the relative frequency of particular constructions in a larger corpus. After the native speaker
of MD examined these English examples, examples of what were thought to be instantiations of the
same construction in MD were selected. In addition, translation was attempted of some of the English
examples in order to evaluate what constructions may or may not exist in both English and MD.8 The
findings of this analysis are given below, listed by construction type.

CAUSED-MOTION Construction (English) specifies that a causer argument directly causes a
theme argument to move along a path designated by a directional phrase (Goldberg, 1995):

Subject.Agent Verb Object.Theme Oblique.Path
He blinked the snow off of her eyelashes.
They booed him off the stage.
She sneezed the foam off the cappuccino.

This construction is quite productive in English, licensing a variety of different verbs that are not typically
associated with motion semantics, as shown above. Precisely what constraints exist upon the compatibil-
ity of a particular verbwithin this construction remains under debate. This idiosyncratic semi-productivity
is precisely what makes adding this construction to the lexicon—as opposed to adding on motion senses

7Recently, expanding from within a generative framework, Dorr and Voss (2018) propose multi-layered verb structures for
a computational lexicon to support spatial language understanding.

8Ideally, anMD constructicon would be developed through a careful analysis of the language through the lens of construction
grammar, thereby avoiding the inevitable bias that stems from considering correspondents to English constructions. We hope
to complete such analysis in the future as we develop the needed expertise in both construction grammar and MD. It would also
be fruitful to explore a semi-automatic approach to detecting constructions, like that of Forsberg et al. (2014).

to what are typically non-motion verbs (like blink)—an effective strategy for providing more systematic
coverage for the semantics of this construction in a computational lexicon. An examination of MD shows
that a version of the Caused-Motion construction9 exists in MD, as shown in Table 5.
We noticed, however, that the productivity and constraints on the Caused-Motion construction (e.g.,

determining which verbs can be licensed within it), at this stage in our analysis of MD, appear to be
distinct from English. In particular, while English allows for a wide variety of verbs that lexicalize how
the motion is caused (e.g., boo, sneeze, blink), we have observed that, for the examples our translator
provided from MD, the motion semantics was expressed in two parts: through a distinct motion verb
and through another word expressing the manner of causation, as shown in two example sentences in
Table 6.

Gloss entered-it the-train to-the-station (PRS)-it-scream entered-it the-bee to-the-room (PRS)-it-buzz

English Source The train whistled into the station The bee buzzed into the room

Table 7: Sound Emission Verbs are realized separately from Motion Verbs in MD, in contrast to English,
in which the Intransitive-Motion construction can license the motion semantics of what is typically a
sound-emission verb.

INTRANSITIVE-MOTION Construction (English) carries motion and path semantics and licenses a
variety of non-motion verbs, including sound emission verbs that are especially prevalent (Goldberg,
1995) :

Subject.Theme Verb Oblique.Path
The bee buzzed into the room.
The train whistled into the station.

However, MD—like many verb-framing languages, (Talmy, 1985; Talmy, 2000)—requires the sound
emission verb be realized in surface form separately from the motion verb, as in Table 7.

COMPARATIVE construction (English) expresses the equality or non-equality of two values on a scale.
For inequality, comparatives can be realized with a separate degree-word mention of what is more or

9Arguably, this could be an instantiation of a Resultative construction instead of a Caused-Motion construction. Further
elicitation is needed.

Subject.Item1 Copula (Degree word) Adjective.Property AdverbialPhrase.Item2
This building is newer than the one we saw earlier.
The orange cat is less intelligent than its grey friend.

In MD, we observe that comparatives can be expressed either using the elative form of the adjective
followed by من , similar to MSA, or, instead, by using the base form of the adjective followed by على .
Examples for these cases are presented in Table 8.

MD الخر الشي من اغلى الطوموبيل هد الخر الشي على غالية الطوموبيل هد

The Superlative construction is realized very similarly to English, as shown in Table 9.

Gloss this it biggest museum in-the-country this it best building saw-we

English Source This is the biggest museum in the country This is the best building we have seen

Table 9: Examples of MD Superlative construction

THE X-ER THE Y-ER Construction (or `covariational conditional’) has a unique form in which
degree-words are nested into phrases with the occurring at the beginning (Goldberg, 2003):

The higher you fly, the harder you fall.
The more you practice, the less you will have to think about it.

The construction conveys the correlation between two variables changing along distinct scales. This
construction is another excellent example warranting the development of constructicons, since it is the
form alone that conveys this meaning, without any explicit lexical-semantic marking of correlation. In
our analysis, we find that English instances of TheX-er the Y-er can be translated into at least three distinct
construction in MD. The three constructions are given in 5, where each is used as a possible translation
for the same English sentence exemplifying The X-er the Y-er. While all plausible translations for The X-
er the Y-er, these constructions certainly have distinctions in meaning and usage as well. Further analysis
is required to determine those nuances and the extent to which The X-er the Y-er might be an adequate
English translation of all three of these constructions. Thus, our analysis of MD translations of English
constructions has led to three new potential candidates for a MD constructicon.

NLP researchers is automatic dialect/language identification, especially for code-switched data, sinceMD
speakers frequently mix MD with other languages such as MSA, French, and English. Samih and Maier
(2016a) create a 223,000 token corpus fromMoroccan internet discussion forums and blogs and annotate
it for use in code-switching detection experiments (Samih and Maier, 2016b).11 Voss et al. (2014) also
build a code-switching detection system for MD, focusing on MD text written in Latin script.
In addition to the aforementioned digital resources, there are a few print dictionaries for Moroccan,

including a recent verb dictionary (El Haloui and Bowman, 2011) as well as an older dictionary in Latin
script edited by Harrell and Sobelman (1966). The Moroccan Darija Wordnet (MDW) project (Mrini
and Bond, 2017) is endeavoring to create a WordNet from the Harrell and Sobelman dictionary and link
it with Princeton’s WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). MDW will eventually be released as part of the Open
Multilingual Wordnet project (Bond and Foster, 2013).

6.2 Idioms

In the last decade, researchers have turned to the task of automatically detecting idioms in English texts,
developing statistical measures that go beyond the tradition of relying on manually identifying expres-
sions in terms of their syntactic and semantic idiosyncracies; instead, researchers have analyzed a wide
range of actual usage patterns in texts (Fazly et al., 2009), and most recently using word embeddings
(Peng and Feldman, 2017) and leveraging existing sources of idioms, such as in Wiktionary (Muzny
and Zettlemoyer, 2013). Related research in idiom identification in non-English languages is also being
conducted by native speakers of those languages, e.g., Hindi (Priyanka and Sinha, 2014), Italian (Vietri,
2014), Russian (Aharodnik et al., 2018), and Japanese (Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2008).

6.3 Constructicons

Though constructicons are intended to be language-specific, they are based on the notion of continuity
between the grammar and the lexicon in all languages (Fillmore, 2008). Resources for constructicons that
we are aware of (Bäckström et al., 2014; Torrent et al., 2014; Forsberg et al., 2014; Ohara, 2016) take the
following approach (similar to our own here): they begin by comparing English constructions to known
constructions in another language of choice. Such comparison offers a baseline of constructions that may
exist in the language, elucidating equivalent, approximate, and divergent constructions in the process;
also, it addresses the possibility of linking constructicon resources in a dictionary-likemanner. Backström
et al. (2014) elaborate potential Swedish correspondents for Berkeley’s English constructicon,12 noting
that full equivalence is difficult between constructions due to their use of content, form, and pragmatic
usage combined. In contrast, Torrent et al. (2014) focus on a set of known constructions in Brazilian
Portuguese (the Para Infinitive family), and through a close study of how to link theses constructions to

English constructions as established byGoldberg (2003), they develop guidelines to help future annotators
identify valid Brazilian Portuguese constructions. Though these constructions do not find full equivalence
between languages, this type of analysis can provide useful diagnostics for identifying cross-linguistic
commonalities and innovations alike.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we explore the challenges of building a computational lexicon for Moroccan Darija (MD).
Starting from MD source text found online, we report on the construction of a parallel translation corpus
ofMD-English sentences and the computational lexicon derived in the process with bilingualMD-English
entries.13
The construction analyses that we have begun, while preliminary, demonstrate that future work in

linking constructicons across languages will be useful for translation by revealing places where one con-
struction can be translated into another construction of a relatively similar form (e.g., for English andMD,
the Comparative and Superlative), or a construction may be translated into one or more constructions of
dissimilar form (e.g., The X-er the Y-er), and places where a construction in one language could only be
translated periphrastically in another language (e.g., the English Caused-Motion and Intransitive Motion
constructions translate into MD paraphrases). Instead of considering what English constructions may be
present in MD, future work in expanding the MD constructicon will consider what unique constructions
may exist in MD, which may not be expressed as constructions in other languages like English.
