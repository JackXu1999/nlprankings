1 Abstract

The Arabic language is a collection of variants
among which Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has
a special status as the formal written standard of
the media, culture and education across the Arab
World. The other variants are informal spoken
dialects that are the media of communication for
daily life. As expected, most of the natural lan-
guage processing resources and research in Ara-
bic focuses on MSA. However, there is more work
now on Arabic dialects, which includes efforts
to build resources as well as exploit existing re-
sources from MSA. In this talk, we present the
challenges of processing Arabic dialects and the
current advances in that area, with special empha-
sis on directions that exploit existing MSA (and
other dialect) resources.

2 Author’s Biography

Nizar Habash is an Associate Professor of Com-
puter Science at New York University Abu Dhabi.
He received his Ph.D. in 2003 from the Com-
puter Science Department, University of Mary-
land College Park. He later joined Columbia Uni-
versity’s Center for Computational Learning Sys-
tems where he co-founded in 2005 the Columbia
Arabic Dialect Modeling group (CADIM) with
Mona Diab and Owen Rambow. His research in-
cludes work on machine translation, morpholog-
ical analysis, generation and disambiguation, and
computational modeling of Arabic and its dialects.
Professor Habash has over 100 publications in-
cluding a book entitled ”Introduction to Arabic
Natural Language Processing”. His website is
