Abstract

We present an approach to detect differences in lexical semantics across English language regis-
ters, using word embedding models from distributional semantics paradigm. Models trained on
register-specific subcorpora of the BNC corpus are employed to compare lists of nearest asso-
ciates for particular words and draw conclusions about their semantic shifts depending on register
in which they are used. The models are evaluated on the task of register classification with the
help of the deep inverse regression approach.

Additionally, we present a demo web service featuring most of the described models and allow-
ing to explore word meanings in different English registers and to detect register affiliation for
arbitrary texts. The code for the service can be easily adapted to any set of underlying models.

1 Introduction

The phenomenon of language registers has long attracted the attention of linguists as well as specialists
in other humanities areas. It is closely related to the issues of how humans produce and interpret texts.
This paper and the accompanying demo web service intend to make exploration of these questions more
accurate and data-driven.

We present an approach to track how words change their dominant meaning depending on the partic-
ular text register in which they are used. A typical example is the English word ‘cup’ denoting mostly
mugs in the fiction texts, but switching its primary meaning to the championship prize in the news texts.
To find this (often rather slight) meaning shifts we use prediction-based distributional semantics mod-
els. In particular, we employ the Continuous Bag of Words model (Mikolov et al., 2013), trained on the
register-separated subcorpora of the British National Corpus (BNC).

We evaluate this approach and show how it can be used to detect semantic shifts that cannot be discov-
ered with traditional frequency-based corpus analysis methods. In addition, a similar algorithm is used
to efficiently detect the most probable register of arbitrary text. We also present a convenient web service
demonstrating the aforementioned techniques for English language material.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the related work, describe the notions
of language registers and genres in more details, and put our work in the academic context. Section 3
presents our data and methods and provides examples of register-dependent semantic shifts. Section 4
is devoted to the algorithm of extracting register affiliation for texts based on the models we used in the
previous section. It also evaluates the models. In Section 5 we conclude and draw main directions for
the future work.

2 Related work

The notion of language register is often used as synonymous to genre or style. In any of these manifes-
tations, it is a set of loosely defined categories of texts depending on both form and content (Chandler,
1997). It is very important that registers are not topics, which are defined on solely internal criteria (in

other words, they describe what the text is about). Meanwhile, registers are defined on the basis of exter-
nal criteria (namely, they depend on who produces the text, for whom and under what circumstances).

Any system that classifies texts into ‘registers’ or ‘genres’ is unavoidably subjective: the distinction
between registers is more of a convention than of some objective properties of texts. Notwithstanding this
fact, this separation can be a useful tool in humanities as it is inherently relative to typical communicative
situations and human behaviour within them, as well as the issues of the influence of language on the
society. On the other hand, one can try to extract some objective linguistic phenomena associated with
this or that register (cf., for example, (Biber, 1995)). Our work described in this paper also aims to
facilitate the process of linguistic description of differences between registers and (to a lesser extent)
genres.

It is important to note that we do not try to redefine existing register or genre classifications. Instead,
we take them as is (see the thorough discussion in Section 3). We presuppose that the register separation
introduced during compiling large and well-established corpora, like the BNC, makes at least some sense
and represents linguistic reality to at least some extent. However, the same experiments can be performed
with any other register classification scheme.

Our main source of data is the British National Corpus. The foundations of text classification in the
BNC are described in (Lee, 2001). It states, inter alia, that there is no such thing as the ‘general English
language’. Instead, there exist several ‘Englishes’ (sublanguages), depending on the communicative
situations. They can be called registers, whereas genres in this approach are their subdivisions: for
example, sport column is a genre within news register.

(Lee, 2001) emphasizes that linguistic specificity is associated with registers, not genres; this is con-
firmed in NLP research, see, for example, (Dell’Orletta et al., 2013). We use this hypothesis in our work,
as we are interested in differences of word meanings, which are manifested on the register level. This
is the reason for us to compare macro-registers in the BNC (like news, academic and fiction) instead of
comparing particular genres (like humanities academic texts and fiction drama texts). Of course, another
reason is that the BNC is not a very large corpus and subcorpora consisting of texts belonging only to
particular genres would be too small to train reasonable distributional models.

The size of the subcorpora is important, as we share the idea expressed in the seminal work of (Kilgar-
riff, 1997): the sets of word senses are absolutely dependent on the corpora we use to study them (and
the purposes of the study). It essentially means that word meanings are abstractions over clusters of word
usages. The word usage in corpus linguistics is traditionally defined through the frequencies of the word
co-occurrences with other words (typical contexts). This is where distributional models come into play.

In natural language processing, distributional models, based on the foundational idea of ‘meaning as
context’, are now one of the primary tools for semantic-related tasks. They stem from the so called
distributional hypothesis, which states that co-occurrence statistics (word co-occurrence distributions)
extracted from large enough natural language corpus can in some way represent the ‘meaning’ of words
as perceived by humans (Firth, 1957). More formally, with a given training corpus, each word is rep-
resented as a vector of frequencies for this word occurring together with other linguistic entities (its
contexts). These vectors are located in a semantic space with all possible contexts or semantic features
as dimensions. Vector models of distributional semantics or vector space models (VSMs) are well es-
tablished in the field of computational linguistics and have been studied for decades; see the review in
(Turney et al., 2010), among others.

Recently, a particular type of these models has become very popular, namely, the prediction models
that utilize artificial neural networks, introduced in (Bengio et al., 2003) and (Mikolov et al., 2013) and
employed in a wide-spread word2vec software. Prediction models directly learn dense vectors (embed-
dings) which maximize the similarity between contextual neighbours found in the data, while minimizing
the similarity for unseen contexts.

Initial vectors are generated randomly (the target vector size is set at the beginning of the training
process, typically hundreds of components) and then gradually converge to optimal values, as we move
through the training corpus with a sliding window. To this end, predictive models employ machine
learning and consider each training instance as a prediction problem: one wants to predict the current

27



word with the help of its contexts or vice versa. The outcome of the prediction for the given training
example (context window) determines whether we change the current word vector (embedding) and in
what direction.

To sum it up, prediction models learn meaningful vector representations of words in the training corpus
by stochastically trying to predict a focus word from its context neighbours, and slightly adjusting vectors
in case of mistake. These models are simple, fast and efficient in various NLP tasks; for evaluation, see
(Baroni et al., 2014), among others.

Interestingly, this approach is absolutely compatible with (Lee, 2001) idea that registers exist inde-
pendently of text-level structures. Thus, one can extract linguistic features of different registers without
paying attention to particular texts, treating all of them as one large register-marked corpus. This is ex-
actly what we do with the register-separated subcorpora of the BNC. The details of this are described in
the next section.

There have been several studies dedicated to the task of automatic text register (or genre) identifi-
cation; most of them were inspired by (Kessler et al., 1997). To the best of our knowledge, none of
the studies made use of distributional semantics. The algorithms were mainly based on simple word
and text statistics; see, for example, (Lee and Myaeng, 2002), (Amasyal and Diri, 2006). In some of the
works ((Stamatatos et al., 2000), (zu Eissen and Stein, 2004)), apart from statistical features (word count,
sentence count, character per word count, punctuation marks count), more complex linguistic features
were employed: morpho-syntactic (passive count, nominalization count, relative clauses count and other
frequencies of different syntactic categories) and lexical (type-token ratio).

More resent research, for example, (Biber and Egbert, 2015), also demonstrates the advantages of
incorporating lexico-grammatical characteristics into text types prediction. We attempt to move it even
further and use state-of-the art word embedding models in order to explore linguistic specificity of lan-
guage registers.

3 Distributional approach to meaning across registers

(Lee, 2001) states that a text belonging to a particular register is ‘the instantiation of a conventionalised,
functional configuration of language tied to certain broad societal situations, that is, variety according
to use’. In a sense, we also follow the (Chandler, 1997) concept of ‘ideal reader’ for each register.
Ideal reader shares semantic structures with the text producer. This is reflected in the meaning of the
words used in producing register-specific texts. These meanings can be different from the so-called core
meaning of the word. Note that the concept of ‘core meaning’ is disputable itself, but with a certain
degree of confidence we can say that this is the meaning stored in the dictionaries or the one given by
distributional models trained on a full balanced and representative corpus (for example, the whole BNC).

As stated above, distributional models compute meaning by analysing word co-occurrences. The
trained model can represent semantics of a given word as a sequence of its ‘nearest associates’: words
closest to the key word by the cosine similarity of their vectors (embeddings). Our work is based on
the presupposition that in the models trained on register-specific subcorpora, the register-specific words
would feature meaningfully different sets of nearest associates.

3.1 Data preparation

The data used for our experiments was compiled from the British National Corpus: it is freely accessi-
ble, comparatively large, well-balanced, and, therefore, supposed to be representative for the respective
language. What is even more important is that the BNC features well-developed register and genre an-
notation. Since our aim is to discover semantic shifts associated with the switching from one register to
another, we train several distributional semantic models on the texts of particular registers.

The BNC provides eight ’text type’ categories: academic writing, published fiction, published non-
fiction, news and journalism, other published writing, unpublished writing, conversation, other spoken.
Although it might be an apparent way to split the BNC into subcorpora representing different registers,
that is not something we were looking for. The share of each text type is highly disproportionate (’news
and journals’ contains 9.56% of all the corpus tokens, while ’published non-fiction’ – 24.58%; ’other

28



published writing’ appears to be quite a large category (18.26%) that contains text of different registers).
This disproportion would, for certain, affect the quality of distributional models.

Therefore, we have developed our own split into language registers based on the BNC genre classi-
fication1 (Lee, 2001). The classification provides us not only with token and sentence counts for each
genre, but also with ”macro-genres” categories. For instance, the following genres of academic writings
– ’humanities arts’, ’medicine’, ’nature science’, ’politics law education’, ’social science’, ’technical
engineering’ – are encoded as ’W ac:humanities arts’, ’W ac:medicine’, ’W ac:nat science’, ’W ac:polit
law edu’, ’W ac:soc science’, ’W ac:tech engin’ respectively. This encoding let us form an ’academic’
register out of the texts of the mentioned genres. Thus, we have obtained the split which is more balanced
in terms of token counts and which, we hope, is more reliable. The registers are listed below:

1. academic texts (15 632 085 tokens);

2. fiction texts (15 950 682 tokens);

3. newspaper articles (14 214 484 tokens);

4. non-fiction and non-academic texts (18 307 605 tokens);

5. spoken texts (17 451 494 tokens).

The ’academic texts’ register comprises research papers and articles from the various fields of study:
social and political science, law, education, natural science, medicine, humanities, arts and computer sci-
ence. The same topics are covered in ‘non-academic’ texts, the difference is that their intended audience
is non-professional. ‘Fiction’ texts include mainly prose, but also a small amount of drama and poetry.
As for the ‘news’ register, it consists of the following text types: report (the prevalent one), commerce,
social, sport, science, arts. The remaining texts are of various genres (religion, parliamentary, email,
advertisement, administrative etc.) and fall into miscellaneous category. As they do not represent any
particular register, we exclude them from consideration.

These subcorpora were pre-processed, replacing each token with its lemma and PoS tag (loved →
love V ERB). Data on lemmas and PoS affiliation was extracted from the BNC mark-up. We also
removed all functional words and one-word sentences.

3.2 Training distributional models

Then, CBOW models (Mikolov et al., 2013) were trained on each of the subcorpora and on the whole
BNC corpus. We used the standard set of hyperparameters for training, excluding the selection of pre-
diction material: hierarchical softmax was employed, instead of more widely used negative sampling, as
this makes it easier to implement text classification via deep inverse regression (see Section 4 for more
details). Another important decision to make was the size of sliding window (how many words to the
right and to the left of the focus word to consider). It is known from previous work that larger windows
tend to generate more ‘associative’ models (‘cup’ is semantically close to ‘coffee’), while narrower win-
dows favour more ‘functional’ models (‘cup’ is semantically close to ‘mug’). It is not immediately clear
what mode is better for our task. That’s why we trained two sets of models, with window sizes 3 and 10.
The evaluation process is described in Section 4.

The resulting models indeed demonstrate semantic specificity of different registers. It can be observed
through comparing the lists of nearest associates for a given word in different models. The Table 1 gives
one example of such specificity.

One can clearly see the difference in the meaning of the word ‘bank’ when it is used in the fiction
register. While the dominant meaning in general English (and in academic and news registers) is related
to financial institutions, fiction texts use the word in an absolutely different sense related to river shores.
It is possible to quantify these differences using any of set comparing methods. At the moment we
implemented Jaccard distance (Jaccard, 1901) which estimates the number of intersecting elements in

two sets and normalized Kendall’s τ (Knight, 1966) which calculates the differences between rankings.
However, we also plan to test other metrics, for example, as described in (Kutuzov and Kuzmenko,
2016). Larger distance between the ‘general’ model and a particular register means that the key word is
semantically shifted in this register.

The word ‘bank’ is an example of homonymy, where different senses are totally unrelated. However,
our approach also captures subtler cases of polysemy, in which senses are still connected to each other,
like with the noun ‘star’ described in the Table 2.

In this case, all the register-specific models seem to be on approximately the same distance from the
general model (which comprises several meanings at once). However, it is easy to see that the academic
and fiction registers are closer to each other, featuring the astronomical sense of ‘star’. At the same time,
they share no associates with news register, which primarily employs the word in the sense of ‘celebrity’.
The Table 3 shows the matrix of mutual distances between different registers for the word ‘star’.

RegisterExplorer, our demo web service at http://ltr.uio.no/embeddings/registers,
based on Gensim framework (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010), provides easy access to such comparative tables
for the models trained on the BNC register subcorpora. It also features visualizations of the interaction
between nearest associates within one register and between registers as well. The models are available
to download, and the source code for the service is released as free software, making it easy to adapt the
system to any set of models, depending on a researcher’ aims. Among other applications, one can use

the system to explore particular genres, not only large-scale registers, as in this work. For this, one needs
only a large genre-annotated corpus to train genre-specific models (the BNC size is not enough for that).

The distributional approach allows to reveal register-specific senses, which cannot be discovered by
traditional frequency-based analysis. Frequency distributions across registers are meaningful only for
words which possess one dominant meaning. For instance, let us consider a word ‘room’ (noun). Based
on the ‘Words and Phrases’ web resource2, compiled using the Corpus of Contemporary American En-
glish (COCA), we can only conclude that this word is much more frequent in the fiction register (fre-
quency of 87 748, while the respective counts for the spoken, magazine, newspaper and academic reg-
isters are 19 948, 36 225, 31 908, 10 113). However, no conclusions about meaning differences across
registers can be made.

The distributional approach (implemented in RegisterExplorer) supports the observation that in the
fiction register the word ‘room’ is more frequent. However, it additionally allows us to see that the
spoken register – unlike other registers and general English – is strongly associated with the sense ‘the
amount of space’ (apart from much more common sense ‘a part of a building with a floor, walls, and a
ceiling’).

Senses and registers are not always in one-to-one association. A register may feature two or more
specific senses, while two or more registers may be similar in terms of the senses they share. Consid-
ering the verb ‘mean’, we can clearly see that the senses ‘to be of a specified degree of importance to
(someone)’ and ‘to intend something, often bad or wrong’ are associated with the fiction register, while
the academic and news registers share the sense ‘to have as a consequence or result’.

4 Detecting registers with word embeddings

Any word embedding model can be turned into a text classifier via Bayes rule. The idea (dubbed ‘deep
inverse regression’) was first introduced in (Taddy, 2015) and essentially allows to calculate the likeli-
hood of an arbitrary sequence of words in the context of any trained distributional model.

Recall that we have a set of models trained on register-specific texts. It means that we can find out the
extent to which a particular sentence or a text is prototypical for a given register or registers.

For, example intuitively it is obvious that the sequence ‘star divorced yesterday’ is quite likely in
the news texts, very unlikely in the academic texts, and in the spoken texts its likelihood should be
somewhere in between. If we apply deep inverse regression to our models with window size 10 and
the aforementioned sequence (lemmatized and PoS-tagged), it produces the following likelihood values
(more negative values mean less likelihood):

• News: -27.53

• Spoken: -42.39

• Academic: -43.25

• Fiction: -48.42

The news register indeed turns out the most likely to produce such a sentence, with spoken register a
bit less likely, and academic and fiction most unlikely.

RegisterExplorer allows users to analyse an arbitrary text and receive lists of registers ranked by their
likelihood to produce such a text. This can be used to quickly explore ‘linguistic profiles’ of texts and to
find out how different registers are manifested in language, helping to study their interactions.

To evaluate the applicability of this approach to unseen data we randomly sampled 1 000 sentences
from each of our register-specific subcorpora (for the purposes of evaluation, these sentences were not
used in the subsequent model training). For these sentences, we calculated the most likely register
according to the deep inverse regression method and evaluated it against the real sentence affiliations.
The results are summarized in the Table 4.

News 0.49 0.50 0.03 0.04

Spoken 0.48 0.48 0.03 0.04

Average 0.47 0.46 0.06 0.08

The models with the smaller window size performed a bit better in text prediction, which supposedly
implies that they are better in capturing linguistic specificity of language registers in the BNC. We hy-
pothesize that the reason for this is that the smaller windows work as filters against too much influence
of topics and content of the sentences. As a result, models are more ‘concentrated’ on lexical semantics
per se. However we acknowledge that the difference is negligible and more experiments are needed to
find out the best models’ hyperparameters for our task.

For reference, we additionally evaluated the resulting subcorpora models against the well-known Sim-
Lex999 semantic similarity dataset (Hill et al., 2016), as a measure of general ‘quality’ of the models.
Relatively low values did not come as a surprise, considering rather small size of the subcorpora (as
compared to billion-word corpora used in contemporary state-of-the-art models). There is no consistent
advantage of one window size over another (unlike with text classification), the results vary depending
on a register.

One can notice unusual behaviour of the nonAcademic model: with the increase of the window size, it
becomes much better in Simlex999 task, unlike models trained on other subcorpora. In our opinion, the
reason for this is comparatively high average sentence length in the texts belonging this register (about
12 words), favouring settings with large window sizes. Another register with long sentences is academic
(12.4 words), but it does not demonstrate such a behaviour, supposedly because of denser information
load (less ‘irrelevant’ words), which allows to grab the meaning even with a narrow window. Of course,
another reason for this can be a simple fluctuation caused by stochastic nature of word embedding models
and small corpus size. It is also interesting that the fiction register model seems to represent semantic
structure of language as a whole much better than others. However, we leave studying these phenomena
for the future research.

Unfortunately, there is no clear way to directly evaluate how good the models are in capturing partic-
ular words’ semantic differences across registers (as described in the previous section). That’s why we
use the values in the Table 4 as proxy measure of this, and subsequently, RegisterExplorer features the
models with window size 3.

5 Conclusion

Thus, we presented an approach to detect differences in word semantics dependent on the language
registers. It is believed that register variation can be found at different language levels. Our contribution is
related to exploring this variation on the semantic tier of language. Our approach is very straightforward
in implementation and based on distributional semantic models yielding state-of-the-art results in many
NLP tasks.

We gave examples of semantic shifts detected by our approach and showed how it can be easily ex-
tended to detect the most likely register of an arbitrary text. As a proof of concept, we presented Register-
Explorer (http://ltr.uio.no/embeddings/registers), a web service to study difference in
lexical semantics across several language registers extracted from the BNC corpus. The service comes
with freely available source code3 to enable researchers to quickly set up their own experimental design,

with their own models and text types.
Among others, this framework can be used to study differences in word usage between different fiction

genres or even between particular writers, or one and the same writer at certain time periods. It is
also possible to analyse how dominant word meanings change depending on types of communicative
situations, etc. Once the necessary corpora are available, distributional models can be trained using
many available off-the-shelf tools and then easily loaded in to our framework.

In the future we plan to extend the web service with additional models trained on larger corpora (to
allow exploration of finer genres), as well as improve its visualization abilities. We are also interested in
defining what measures of similarity between lists of nearest associates in different models yield better
performance and how to evaluate it. Furthermore, we hope that this service will enable us to investigate
cross-linguistic register variation by examining comparable registers in different languages, for example,
English and Russian.
