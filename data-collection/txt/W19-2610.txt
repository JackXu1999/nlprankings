Abstract

Mathematical expressions (ME) are widely
used in scholar documents. In this paper we
analyze characteristics of textual and visual
MEs characteristics for the image-to-LATEX
translation task. While there are open data-
sets of LATEX files with MEs included it is
very complicated to extract these MEs from
a document and to compile the list of MEs.
Therefore we release a corpus of open-access
scholar documents with PDF and JATS-XML
parallel files. The MEs in these documents are
LATEX encoded and are document independent.
The data contains more than 1.2 million dis-
tinct annotated formulae and more than 80 mil-
lion raw tokens of LATEX MEs in more than 8
thousand documents. While the variety of tex-
tual lengths and visual sizes of MEs are not
well defined we found that the task of analyz-
ing MEs in scholar documents can be reduced
to the subtask of a particular text length, image
width and height bounds, and display MEs can
be processed as arrays of partial MEs.

1 Introduction

Mathematics is recognized as the most ancient sci-
entific field in the world. Symbols were used
from the beginning of mathematics. A spe-
cific breakthrough in mathematical language was
the invention of the equals symbol (=) that is
now universally accepted in mathematics, which
was first recorded by the Welsh mathematician
Robert Recorde in The Whetstone of Witte (1557)1.
Mathematics became the language of symbols to
ease mathematical writing, reading and reasoning.
Mathematical expressions (ME) are widely used
phenomena in scholar documents but we know just
little about the textual and visual characteristics of
these MEs as this field is less studied in NLP do-

sign

main. The language of MEs is not linear as for in-
stance the English language. Instead, every mathe-
matical symbol has various types of relations, and
these relations are vertically and visually repre-
sented in 2D space.

The majority of scholar documents is produced
in PDF format. The main advantage of this format
that it is a universal and human readable format
on many devices. PDF also has many advance-
ments for adopting the content of documents for
machines by creating tagged PDF, though these
features are used occasionally. In general, a PDF
file contains layout specifications of fonts and
their attributes, and no explicit labels are avail-
able for mathematics. Many researchers are strug-
gling with the replication of MEs in other docu-
ments. Being able to automatically identify and
decode mathematics (Lin et al., 2011; Wang and
Liu, 2017a,b) in PDF files will enable a wide range
of high-level applications such as information re-
trieval, machine reading, similarity analysis, infor-
mation aggregation, and reasoning. Siegel et al.
(2018) discuss how to recover the positional in-
formation of figures in PDF files. The proposed
methods could be also used for the alignment
of MEs in PDF and XML files. There are also
efforts to automatically decode image MEs into
LATEX(Deng et al., 2016, 2017). The length and
size of MEs in scholar documents are little dis-
cussed. We find that researchers apply specific
bounds to the textual length and visual size of MEs
without any explanation. Therefore, our interest
is to find out specific characteristics of MEs in
scholar documents to be used for machine learn-
ing.

The Mathematical REtrieval Collection
(MREC) (Lı́ška et al., 2011) is a subset of the
arXMLiv corpus and includes documents that
were successfully converted to XML. MREC
consists of well-formed XHTML documents.

MathML, a W3C standard, is used for represen-
tation of mathematical formulas. This corpus
contains XHTML files only.

2 Markups and MEs

In general, all MEs in scholar documents can
be read out loud as a linear sequence of words.
The pseudo-linearity allows to embed MEs into
natural language texts despite the visual multi-
dimensional representation. This is a big advan-
tage for humans to be able to combine natural lan-
guage and symbolic language into one text. But it
is not easy for machines to recognize the content
and structure of these MEs.

There are several editors and markups for MEs.
OpenOffice and MS Office R© have internal support
for writing MEs using special editors. These edi-
tors are frequently used when documents are not
highly loaded with MEs, and they are sufficient
for most users. The LATEX typesetting system
is used as the main technology in mathematics,
physics, and other related domains. LATEX is
widely accepted because of its simplicity for
humans to write and read MEs in linear order
and to get very complex ME representations.
MathML2 is the only standardized markup for
MEs which preserves content and layout. Both
markups, LATEX and MathML, are supported by
the JATS NISO standard3. For instance, the
representation of the formula

1− e−
1
2
|x|2 (1)

in LATEX is:
$1-{\mathrm{e}}ˆ{-\frac{1}{2}|x{|}ˆ{2}}$

whereas in MathML it is:
<mml:math>
<mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup>
<mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi>
</mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo>
<mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mfrac>
<mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow>
<mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow>
</mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle><mml:mo stretchy="false">|
</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">x</mml:mi>
<mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|
</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn>
</mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup>
</mml:math>.

Both representations are equal but the readabil-
ity for humans and for computers are obviously
discrepant. For humans, the LATEX representation
is easy to read, edit and interpret4. But LATEX data

4The first resource for mathematics zbMATH formula

search uses the MathWebSearch system, which is a content-

has no explicit structural representation and ad-
vance knowledge is necessary to interpret ME en-
tities and relations. On the other side, MathML
data are well structured, relations and bounds of
entities are explicitly defined in the data itself.
Therefore, we often find both markup representa-
tions in scholar documents on-line.

3 Tokenization of LATEX MEs

In this section we analyze the tokenization task of
MEs encoded in LATEX. Usually, tokenization is
the first task of data preprocessing when a long
sequence of information is split into words. Fre-
quently, a white-space character is used to separate
words. LATEX allows to use white-space characters
in MEs and these white-space characters usually
do not affect the visual representation of MEs. For
instance,
$1-{\mathrm{e}}ˆ{-\frac{1}{2}|x{|}ˆ{2}}$

and
$ 1 - { \mathrm { e } } ˆ { - \frac { 1 }
{ 2 } | x { | } ˆ { 2 } } $

will result into the same ME image of Formula 1.
Sometimes researchers need to insert some text
into an ME or use a different approach for en-
coding variables. Often \text or \mbox are
used for this purpose. The content of these com-
mands is switched into LATEX mode and, therefore,
a white-space character becomes important and in-
fluences image rendering. Tokenization by insert-
ing white-spaces
$ 1 - { \text { e } } ˆ { - \frac { 1 }
{ 2 } | x { | } ˆ { \text { 2 } } } $

will result to slightly different output:

1− e −
1
2
|x| 2 .

White-space characters should not be used
straightforwardly for the separation of tokens and
should be used with caution. White-space charac-
ters should also be included into the vocabulary of
ME tokens for the image-to-text task.

Tokenization of MEs is a task of splitting text
into minimal meaningful LaTeX tokens, and to-
kenization should not affect image rendering. A
sequence of letters in an ME often denotes a se-
quence of unique variables visually not split with
white-space character. Variables often are single

based search engine for MathML formulas based on substi-
tuting tree indexing. A query should be inserted in LATEX, but
the database is MathML based.

letters and there is no evident sign for the bound-
aries of each variable. Single characters and num-
bers can be used as single tokens in most cases.
We suggest to use a TAB or other specific charac-
ter as a split character for tokenization.

4 The corpus of open-access scholar
documents

We collected 8599 open-access scholar documents
that are freely accessible on-line, that have both
PDF and xhtml versions, include MEs at least
once, and are under CC BY, CC BY NC, or CC BY
NC SA licence5. The documents were published
between 2012 and 2018. The majority of docu-
ments are research papers in the following jour-
nals:

– Advances in Difference Equations (2283 doc-
uments)

– Boundary Value Problems (1457 documents)
– Fixed Point Theory and Applications (1101

documents)
– Journal of Inequalities and Applications

(2645 documents)
The average number of MEs per document is

291, and the average number of distinct MEs is
1936. In Figure 1 we can see that the number of
distinct MEs is linearly increasing with the cor-
pus size. This observation shows that the variety
of MEs is very complex and new MEs are intro-
duced in each document. This observation is very
intriguing as we expected to see the very com-
mon distribution called ’heavy tail’, Zipf, or other
names of the same idea. We also observe that the
typical MEs and distinct MEs ratio in each docu-
ment is similar and equals to 1.5. This means that
about 60 percent of MEs are duplicated in the doc-
ument. The rest of the MEs are unique. The total
number of MEs in the corpus is 2.5 million and the
number of distinct MEs is 1.2 million. The max-
imum number of MEs in one document is 26717.
There are several documents that have only one
ME.

In Figure 2 we observe the vocabulary size in
the corpus of MEs. Vocabulary size does not in-
crease significantly when a corpus is doubled from
40 million tokens to 80 million tokens. There are
39 types out of 728 types in total that occur only

occur less than ten times in the corpus. The major-
ity in vocabulary are LATEX commands. The most
frequent tokens are {, }, _ and ˆ. The most fre-
quent LATEX command is \frac. This shows that
the vocabulary of MEs is small and already satu-
rated. We could expect 1000 as vocabulary size
upper limit of MEs for very large corpora.

5 Analysis of textual and visual
characteristics

In this section we analyze the length of MEs en-
coded in LATEX. For the image-to-LATEX translation
task Deng et al. (2017) uses a strict length range
which falls in between 40 and 1024 characters and
which is limited to 150 tokens. These bounds are
used for training data and generated MEs. The pa-
per does not describe the procedure of bounds set-
tings. Do these bounds falsify the real world of
MEs and do they consider only some part of the
problem?

It is important to differentiate MEs (1) that are
used as part of regular text and are placed on
the same text line (inline mode), and (2) that are
placed on a separate line and usually take more
than one regular text line (display mode). The
same ME in inline and display modes have slightly
different visual layout and size. Therefore, we dif-

ferentiate analysis of inline and display MEs.

5.1 Inline MEs

Inline MEs are often short insertions of symbolic
language into regular text and they are not spread
across many text lines. There are 732498 dis-
tinct inline MEs in the corpus. In Figure 3 we
observe that the peak length in the list of distinct
inline MEs is around 10 tokens and it slowly goes
down until 75 tokens. In inline mode formulae that
are longer than 75 tokens length we often find an

\displaystyle switch which turns inline for-
mulae into display formulae. The longest inline
ME is 1008 tokens (see Appendix B). Thus, the
upper limit of complex inline formula is around
100 token. The most frequent inline ME is {xn},
which occurs 13937 times, and is encoded as
$\{x_{n}\}$ that is 9 tokens length.

We rendered images of all MEs using the
shell script in Appendix A. Rendered images
have 200dpi resolution. In Figure 4 we show
a variety of image sizes in pixels. The heights



76

of images fall into the range between 1 and 100
with some odd image height of over 100 pixels.
The widths of images are in the range between 1
and 1000 pixels8. Figure 4 does not emphasize a
specific inline image height and width except the
ranges. In Figure 5 we observe the wide range dis-
tribution of rendered images. The majority of im-
ages are in the range between 30 and 500 pixels.
In Figure 6 we observe a specific image height at
which the majority of images were rendered. The
majority of inline images have a height of 27 or 28
pixels. All other image heights of inline images
are less frequent. Therefore, for the ME detection
in PDF scholar documents we can expect a for-
mula image size of 30-500 pixels width and 27-
28 pixels height. Deng et al. (2017) uses groups
of 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384, 480 pix-
els image widths and 32, 64, 96, 128, 160 pixels
image heights for the image-to-LATEX translation
task. We can see that image size boxes are very
similar to what we observe in our corpus.

5.2 Display MEs
Display MEs are insertions of symbolic language
in text and occur in a document as a separate area
from the regular text and can be spread over sev-
eral text lines. There are 467056 distinct display
MEs in our corpus. The most frequent display ME
occurs 59 times in 55 documents and is 27 tokens
length:

lim
n→∞

‖xn+1 − xn‖ = 0.

This low frequency shows the trend that display
MEs are unique and we should not expect occur-
rence of the same formula in many places. This
explains the linear growth of unique MEs in the
corpus (see Figure 1). The longest display ME
is 13987 tokens length (see Appendix C). Display
MEs are very long and many of them can be over
500 tokens in length (see Figure 7). The majority
of display formulae range from 20 to 250 tokens.
It is definitely much longer than Deng et al. (2017)
bound that is 150 tokens.

The display formula image size ranges from 5
to 1000 pixels width and 5 to 6000 pixels height.
There is some dependency between the image
width and height. If the image height is over 2000
pixels then the image width is always expected to
be close to 1000 pixels. In Figure 9 we observe a
wide range of frequent image widths and there are
many of them at the maximum image width. So,

81000 pixels take the full page width.

the image width mentioned in Deng et al. (2017)
is too low for many display MEs. In Figure 10
we observe that the majority of display formulae
height is at 30-35 and 65-70 pixels. The image
height range between 30-35, which is close to in-
line formulae image height. This shows that many
display formulae fit on a regular text line height.
65-70 pixels height is enough to visualize complex
mathematical expressions such as

∑
or
∏

and it
also fit on one line. Display formulae are very
complex for the image-to-LATEX translation task as
the text length is much longer than current Deep
Neural Networks (DNN) can embed, and image
height is too high to feed it to the DNN input. The
solution to the problem could be to split display
images into arrays of single line display images
and to implement the image-to-LATEX task as a list
if partial display images. For this we should also
align break points in LATEX code and images. In
general, this is not very complicated as there are
clear clues in LATEX code (e.g., \\ or \cr com-
mands) and in an image (e.g., horizontal gap be-
tween lines).

6 Conclusions

We release the corpus of more than 8000 open-
access, JATS-NISO-XML tagged and PDF paral-
lel scholar documents which contain at least one
mathematical expression. Our analysis shows that
inline MEs and display MEs have different tex-
tual and visual characteristics. Further, a display
mathematical expression should be used as an ar-
ray of partial mathematical expressions that each
fit on one visual line. The textual length of in-
line MEs ranges between 5 to 75 tokens, image
width ranges between 30 to 500 pixels, and image
height ranges between 20 to 40 pixels. Display
ME textual length ranges from 15 to more than
500 tokens, image width ranges between 100 to
1000 pixels, and image height ranges between 20
to more than 300 pixels. The partial display im-
age height ranges between 20 to 85 pixels. These
bounding settings include the majority of all math-
ematical expressions and can be used for image-
to-LATEX translation task implementation.
