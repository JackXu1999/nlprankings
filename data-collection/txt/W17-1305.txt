Abstract

We present CALIMAGLF, a Gulf Arabic mor-
phological analyzer currently covering over 2,600
verbal lemmas. We describe in detail the pro-
cess of building the analyzer starting from pho-
netic dictionary entries to fully inflected ortho-
graphic paradigms and associated lexicon and or-
thographic variants. We evaluate the coverage
of CALIMAGLF against Modern Standard Arabic
and Egyptian Arabic analyzers on part of a Gulf
Arabic novel. CALIMAGLF verb analysis token
recall for identifying correct POS tag outperforms
both the Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian
Arabic analyzers by over 27.4% and 16.9% abso-
lute, respectively.

1 Introduction

Until recently, Dialectal Arabic (DA) was mainly
spoken with little to no publicly available written
content. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) on the
other hand is the official language in more than
20 countries, where most written documents from
news articles, to educational materials and enter-
tainment magazines, are written in MSA. Hence,
most of the tools that are available for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks are focused on
MSA. With the introduction of social media plat-
forms online, dialectal written content is being
produced abundantly. Using existing tools that
were developed for MSA on DA proved to have
limited performance (Habash and Rambow, 2006;
Khalifa et al., 2016). Having resources specific
to DA, such as morphological lexicons is impor-
tant for Arabic NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech
(POS) tagging and morphological disambiguation.
Recently, dialects such as Egyptian (EGY) and
Levantine (LEV) Arabic have been receiving in-
creasing attention. Morphological analyzers for

EGY and LEV proved to perform well when used
for morphological tagging (Eskander et al., 2016).
To our knowledge, there exist no full morpho-
logical analyzers for Gulf Arabic (GLF) that pro-
duce segmentation, POS analysis and lemmas. Al-
though we note the work of Abuata and Al-Omari
(2015) on developing a Gulf Arabic stemmer. In
this paper, we present CALIMAGLF,1 a morpho-
logical analyzer for GLF. In the current work, we
present the effort focusing on GLF verbs only. We
utilize a combination of computational techniques
in addition to explicit linguistic knowledge to cre-
ate this resource. We also evaluate it against wide
coverage tools for MSA and EGY. CALIMAGLF
verb analysis token recall in terms of identifying
correct POS tagging outperforms on both MSA
and EGY by over 27.4% and 16.9% absolute, re-
spectively. CALIMAGLF will be made publicly
available to researchers working on Arabic and
Arabic dialect NLP.2

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we review related literature, then we
briefly describe the main characteristics of GLF in
Section 3. In Section 4 we describe the approach
and the resources involved and evaluate in Sec-
tion 5. We conclude and discuss future work in
Section 6.

2 Related Work

2.1 Arabic Morphological Modeling

Much work has been done on Arabic morpholog-
ical modeling, covering a wide range of different
system designs. Earlier systems such as BAMA,
SAMA and MAGEAD (Buckwalter, 2004; Graff

1In Arabic �éÒÊ¿ kalimah̄ means ‘Word’. We follow the
naming convention from (Habash et al., 2012a) who devel-
oped CALIMAEGY since we are using the same format and
analysis engine for the databases we create.

et al., 2009; Habash and Rambow, 2006) were en-
tirely manually designed. Similarly, Habash et al.
(2012a) developed CALIMA, a morphological an-
alyzer for Egyptian Arabic (hence CALIMAEGY).
CALIMAEGY was developed based on a lexicon
of morphologically annotated data using several
methods and then manually verified. Further-
more, Salloum and Habash (2011) extended ex-
isting SAMA and CALIMAEGY resources using
hand crafted rules which extended affixes and cli-
tics based on matching on existing ones. Recently,
Eskander et al. (2013) developed a technique that
generates a morphological analyzer based on an
annotated corpus. They describe a technique in
which they define inflectional classes for lexemes
that represents morphosyntactic features in addi-
tion to inflected stems. They automatically ‘com-
plete’ these classes in a process called paradigm
completion. They also show that using manually
annotated iconic inflectional classes helps in the
overall performance. Using the aforementioned
paradigm completion technique, a Moroccan Ara-
bic and a Sanaani Yemeni Arabic morphological
analyzers were created (Al-Shargi et al., 2016).
And very recently Eskander et al. (2016) presented
a single pipeline to produce a morphological ana-
lyzer and tagger from a single annotation of a cor-
pus; they produced resources for EGY and LEV.
Other works that involve DA morphological mod-
eling include the work of Abuata and Al-Omari
(2015). Who developed a rule-based system to
segment affixes and clitics in GLF text. They com-
pare their results to other well known MSA stem-
mers.

In this paper, we create morphological
paradigms similar to the iconic inflectional
classes discussed by Eskander et al. (2013). Our
paradigms map from morphological features to
fully inflected orthographic forms. The paradigms
abstract over templatic roots; and lexical entries
are specified in a lexicon as root-paradigm pairs,
in a manner similar to the work of Habash and
Rambow (2006). We convert the paradigms to
the database representation used in MADAMIRA
(Pasha et al., 2014) and CALIMAEGY (Habash et
al., 2012a).

2.2 Dialectal Orthography

Due to the lack of standardized orthography guide-
lines for DA, and given the major differences from
MSA, dialects are usually written in ways that re-

flects the words’ pronunciation or etymological re-
lation to MSA cognates (Habash et al., 2012b),
and even then with a lot of inconsistency. Fur-
thermore, as with MSA, Arabic orthography ig-
nores the spelling of short vowel diacritics, thus
increasing the ambiguity of the written forms. As
a result, it is rather challenging to computationally
process raw DA text directly from the source, or
even agree on a common normalization. Habash
et al. (2012b) proposed a Conventional Orthogra-
phy for Dialectal Arabic (CODA) as part of a so-
lution allowing different researchers to agree on a
set of DA orthographic conventions for computa-
tional purposes. CODA was first defined for EGY,
but has been extended to Palestinian, Tunisian, Al-
gerian, Maghrebi and Gulf Arabic (Jarrar et al.,
2014; Zribi et al., 2014; Saadane and Habash,
2015; Turki et al., 2016; Khalifa et al., 2016). We
follow the conventions defined by Khalifa et al.
(2016) for CODA GLF.

2.3 Dialectal Arabic Resources

In addition to the above mentioned morphological
analyzers, there exist other resources such as dic-
tionaries and corpora for both DA and MSA. For
annotated MSA corpora, several developed such
as (Maamouri and Cieri, 2002; Maamouri et al.,
2004; Smrž and Hajič, 2006; Habash and Roth,
2009; Zaghouani et al., 2014).

Many efforts targeted DA, notably, EGY
(Gadalla et al., 1997; Kilany et al., 2002; Al-
Sabbagh and Girju, 2012; Maamouri et al., 2012b;
Maamouri et al., 2012a; Maamouri et al., 2014).
As for LEV, there exist morphologically annotated
corpora and a treebank (Jarrar et al., 2014; Jarrar
et al., 2016; Maamouri et al., 2006). Newly de-
veloped corpora for other dialects include (Mas-
moudi et al., 2014; Smaı̈li et al., 2014; Al-Shargi
et al., 2016; Khalifa et al., 2016) for Tunisian,
Algerian, Moroccan, Yemeni and Gulf Arabic re-
spectively. Other notable efforts targeted multi-
ple dialects such as the COLABA project, and the
Tharwa dictionary (Diab et al., 2010; Diab et al.,
2014). Parallel dialectal corpora by Bouamor et
al. (2014) and Meftouh et al. (2015), in addition to
the highly dialectal online commentary corpus by
Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011).

Specifically for GLF, we use the Qafisheh Gulf
Arabic Dictionary (Qafisheh, 1997) as well as the
Gumar Corpus (Khalifa et al., 2016) in developing
our analyzer.

3 Gulf Arabic

3.1 Background

From a linguistic point of view, Gulf Arabic refers
to the linguistic varieties spoken on the western
coast of the Arabian Gulf, that is Bahrain, Qatar,
and the seven Emirates of the United Arab Emi-
rates, as well as in Kuwait and the eastern region of
Saudi Arabia (Holes, 1990; Qafisheh, 1977). We
extend the use of the term ‘Gulf Arabic’ (GLF) to
include any Arabic variety spoken by the indige-
nous populations residing the six countries of the
Gulf Cooperation Council. In this paper, we focus
specifically on Emirati Arabic.

3.2 Orthography

Similar to other dialects, GLF has no standard or-
thography (Habash et al., 2012b). As such, words
may be written in a manner reflecting their pro-
nunciation or their etymological relationship to
MSA cognates. For example the word for ‘dawn’
/al-fayr/ may be written as Q�
 	®Ë @ Alfyr3(reflecting
pronunciation) or as Qj. 	®Ë @ Alfjr (reflecting its
MSA cognate). In this work we follow the same
CODA standards for GLF that were introduced
by the authors in (Khalifa et al., 2016) extend-
ing the original CODA in (Habash et al., 2012b).
We use CODA in developing the morphological
databases; but we also add support for non-CODA
variants and evaluate on raw non-CODA input.
Another challenge caused by Arabic orthography
in general (for MSA and other dialects including
GLF) is that Arabic orthography does not require
writing short vowel diacritics, which adds a lot of
ambiguity.

3.3 Morphology

GLF shares many of the same morphological com-
plexities of MSA and other Arabic dialects. Ara-
bic rich morphology is represented templatically
and affixationally with a number of attachable cl-
itics. This representation in addition to the fact
that short vowel diacritics are usually dropped in
text add to the text’s ambiguity. In comparison to
MSA, EGY and LEV, GLF shares and differs in
several aspects:

• Like MSA, but unlike EGY and LEV, GLF
has no negation enclitic marker, namely the

3All Arabic transliterations are provided in the Habash-
Soudi-Buckwalter transliteration scheme (Habash et al.,
2007).

� iš ‘[negation]’ ending such as ���Ê�̄ AÓ mA
qultiš in EGY and LEV as opposed to �IÊ�̄ AÓ
mA qilt in GLF ‘I did not say’.

• Unlike MSA, but like EGY and LEV, GLF
has an indirect object enclitic which is written
separately in CODA (but not necessarily in
raw form), e.g., ½Ê�JÊ�̄ qultlik (CODA ½Ë �IÊ�̄
qult lik) in LEV and i. Ê�JÊ

�̄ qiltlij (CODA
l .Ì �IÊ

�̄ qilt lij) in GLF ‘I told you[FS]’.

• GLF has different imperfect verb subject
suffixes for second and third person plural
and second person feminine singular from
EGY and LEV, e.g. @ñËñ�®�K tquwlwA in EGY
and LEV and 	àñËñ�®�K tquwluwn in GLF for
‘you[P] say’; and ú
Íñ

�®�K tquwliy in EGY
and LEV and 	á�
Ëñ�®�K tquwliyn in GLF for
‘you[FS] say’. It is interesting to note that
both forms exist in MSA where they indicate
different moods.

• GLF shares with EGY and LEV the absence
of the dual forms of the verb and imperfective
moods, both of which are present in MSA.

• Unlike MSA, GLF shares with EGY and
LEV the ambiguous forms of second mascu-
line singular and first person perfective verbs,
e.g., �I�. �J» katabt ‘I wrote or you wrote’ in
EGY, GLF and LEV; while MSA has katabtu
‘I wrote’ and katabta ‘you wrote’.

• GLF has different second person singular di-
rect object enclitics from EGY, LEV and
MSA. The second masculine singular form in
GLF ¼ ik, sounds like the second feminine
singular form in EGY and LEV, and is dif-
fernt from MSA’s ¼ ka; and the second femi-
nine singular form in GLF h. ij (pronounced
/itš/), is altogether different. For example,
LEV ½�J 	® � šuftik maps to GLF i. �J

	® � šiftij ‘I
saw you[FS]’.

• The future verbal particle in GLF is H. b
which is different from the MSA equivalent
( sa), and can be easily confused with the
present progressive particle H. b in both EGY
and LEV in. GLF does not have a progressive
particle.

4 Building CALIMAGLF

4.1 General Approach

Our goal is to build a morphological analysis
and generation model for GLF. We focus on verb
forms in this paper, but plan to extend the work
to other POS in the future. We employ two
databases that capture the full morphological in-
flection space from lemmas and morphological
features to fully inflected surface forms and in re-
verse. The two databases are (1) a collection of
root-abstracted paradigms which map from fea-
tures to root-abstracted stems, prefixes and suf-
fixes; and (2) a lexicon specifying verbal entries
in terms of roots and paradigm IDs. These two
structures together define for any verb all the pos-
sible analyses allowed within GLF morphology.
The two databases are then merged to create a full
model. The merging can be done as a finite state
machine. However, the implementation we chose
is a variant based on the BAMA/SAMA databases
following the representation used in MADAMIRA
(Pasha et al., 2014) and CALIMAEGY (Habash et
al., 2012a).

Next we discuss step by step the process we
took to build CALIMAGLF, starting with a pho-
netic dictionary all the way to building a fully
functional morphological analyzer that even mod-
els non-CODA spelling variants.

4.2 The Qafisheh Gulf Arabic Verb Lexicon

Our starting point is the Qafisheh Gulf Arabic
Verb Lexicon (QGAVL), which is a portion of the
Qafisheh (1997) dictionary. Each entry in the lex-
icon includes a root, perfective and imperfective
verb inflections, Verb Form (as in form II or VII)
and English gloss. See Table 1 for some exam-
ple entries. The Arabic entries are in a phonetic
representation and not in Arabic script. The verb
forms are only in third person masculine singular
inflection (PV3MS and IV3MS, for perfective and
imperfective aspect, respectively); and no clitics
are attached. In total, there are 2,648 verb entries.

4.3 Orthographic Mapping

The first step we took was to create the ortho-
graphic spelling of all the verb entries. This in-
cluded mapping to the appropriate vowel spelling
as well as following the CODA spelling rules for
stem consonants and morphemes. This step was

first done automatically and then checked manu-
ally for every entry. See Table 2 for an example
of the result of mapping the entries in Table 1.
We mapped the roots in two ways, one following
CODA and one reflecting a phonological spelling.
This information will be used later to make the an-
alyzer robust to non-CODA spellings.

4.4 PV-IV Pattern Extraction

Next, we identified for each verb its orthographic
inflected templatic pattern, i.e., the pattern that
would directly produce the surface form once the
root radicals are inserted. This approach to pat-
tern definition is most like the work of Eskander
et al. (2013) in it being a one shot application
of root-template merging to generate surface or-
thography. The approach differs from the work
of Habash and Rambow (2006), who use a large
number of rewrite rules for phonology, morphol-
ogy and orthography after inserting the roots into
the templates.

The pattern extraction was done automatically
and then manually checked. It was only done to
the forms available in the lexicon so far (PV3MS
and IV3MS). The PV-IV Pattern (perfective-
imperfective pattern) uses digits (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5)
to represent root radicals. In this pattern, all vow-
els and glottal stop (Hamza) forms are explicitly
spelled because they tend to vary within single
paradigms. For example, the first entry in Table 5
specifies the PV-IV Pattern 1A3-y1uw3, which
when merged with the root radicals qwl gener-
ates the perfective and imperfective forms qAl and
yquwl.

4.5 Basic Paradigm Construction

We identified 72 unique PV-IV patterns in the
lexicon, which represent 72 different paradigms.
Arabic Verb Forms (I, II, III, etc.) are too gen-
eral to capture the different variations within the
paradigms. That is due to the different root classes
(i.e. hamzated, hollow, defective, geminate and
sound); and other root-pattern interactions, such
as the different forms of Form VIII (Éª�J 	̄ @/H. Q

���̄ @,
É«Y 	̄ @/QëX 	P@, Éª¢ 	̄ @/H. Q¢ 	@, etc.). All of these
phenomena can be handled with orthographic,
phonological and morphological rules as was done
by Habash and Rambow (2006). However, here
we embedded the result of such rule application in
the paradigm directly. See Table 3 for counts of
PV-IV patterns per Verb Form.

Table 3: Basic Paradigm counts for every Verb
Form Class ( 	à 	Pð wazn).

We use the PV-IV patterns as keys (indices)
for the paradigms. We then proceed to build a
database of Basic Paradigms (BP). A BP is de-
fined as the complete set of possible morpholog-
ical features (except for clitic features) along with
the corresponding stem. The features included are
Aspect (perfective PV, imperfective IV, command
CV), Person (1, 2, 3), Gender (masculine M, fem-
inine F, unspecified U), and Number (singular S,
plural P). The total number of allowable feature
combinations is 19. The BP is defined in a similar
fashion to the iconic inflectional classes that was
defined by Eskander et al. (2013). Each form of
the BP is divided into prefix, stem template, and
suffix. See Table 4 for examples of two BPs.

4.6 Affixational Orthographic Rules

While we covered most of the orthographic,
phonological and morphological rules by embed-
ding them in the BPs, there are still a small number
of additional orthographic rules that apply to spe-
cific stem-suffix combinations. Specifically, suf-
fixes beginning with �H t and 	à n that attach to
stems ending with the same letter are modified as
a result of the orthographic gemination rule ( �è �Y ��Ë@
Shadda). For example the verb �H+ �Im� 	' naHat+t
‘I sculpted’ should be written as

��Im� 	' naHat∼;
and the verb A 	K+ 	áÖÞ 	 Daman+nA ‘we guaranteed’
should be written as A�	JÖÞ 	 Daman∼A. We auto-
matically identified all root-paradigm pairs that
cause the above rules to apply, and we created new
paradigms from them. For example, the root �Im� 	'
nHt is linked with the paradigm 1a2a3-yi12a3-t
and the root 	áÖÞ 	 Dmn is linked with the paradigm
1a2a3-yi12a3-n. This resulted in 32 additional
paradigms, bringing the total to 104 paradigms.

4.7 Lexicon Construction

From the set of PV-IV patterns, which we used as
paradigm keys, and the lexical entries converted
from QGAVL, we constructed our lexicon auto-
matically and then manually validated all the en-
tries. The lexicon consists of 2,648 entries that are
linked to the paradigms. See Table 5 for examples
of the lexical entries in previous tables. Each en-
try specifies the root (in phonological spelling and
CODA) as well as the paradigm key and gloss.

4.8 Clitic Extension of the Basic Paradigms

At this point, we have a complete inflectional
model of GLF verbs except that they do not in-
clude any of the numerous clitics written attached
in Arabic. We define a set of rules for extending
the paradigms to include the clitics. Our exten-
sions include two types of resources.

Clitic Locations and Forms First is the list of
clitics with their morpheme POS (a la Buckwalter
tag) and their relative location around the basic
inflected verb, and any conditions for their appli-
cation. For example, the future particle proclitic
H. b appears immediately before the basic verb
form, but can only occur with imperfective verbs;
the conjunction proclitics ð wi ‘and’ and 	¬ fa

‘so’ can appear as the first clitics in any series of
clitics; and so on. All possible clitic combinations
are then applied to each form in the paradigm
along with the necessary spelling changes. The
negative proclitic AÓ mA and the indirect pronom-
inal enclitics introduced with the preposition È
are introduced as attached at this point (which is
non-CODA compliant). With this information,
we are able to model the verb ÑêËAîD.�JºJ
K. AÓð
w+mA+b+y-ktb+hA+l+hm ‘and+not+will+he-
write+it+for+them’ (the bolded substring is the
only element from the BP).

We extended the paradigms with a total of 25
clitics, including five proclitics which are ð wi
‘and’,

	¬ fa ‘so’, the future particle H. b ‘will’
and the two negation particles AÓ mA and B lA.

40



For the enclitics, we extended with all possible
10 direct object enclitics which are: ú


	G ny ‘me’,
A 	K nA ‘us’ , h. ij ‘you[FS]’, ¼ ik ‘you[MS]’ , Aë hA
‘she’ ,Ñë hum ‘them’, 	áë hun ‘them[FP]’, Õ» kum
‘you[P]’, 	á» kun ‘you[FP]’ and their respective 10
indirect objects enclitics by adding the preposition
È li ‘for’. With all of the additional clitics and
their features, the total number of allowable fea-
ture combinations (or rows in the paradigms) in-
creases from 19 to 24,321 per paradigm.

Clitic Rewrite Rules We apply a number of
clitic rewrite rules which are mandated by CODA
spelling conventions. One example is the change
of the stem Alif Maqsura to Alif when it is not
word final. For example the basic verb Aë+øQ�� �@
Aštrý+hA ‘he bought + it’ is rewritten as Aë@Q�� �@
AštrAhA (ø ý → @ A). Another example is the
drop of the Alif of the plural suffix pronouns @ð wA
when it is not word final. For example, Aë+ @ðQ�� �@
AštrwA+hA ‘they boaught + it’ is rewritten as
AëðQ�� �@ AštrwhA ( @ð wA→ ð w).

4.9 Database Generation

To generate the database, we used the same
toolkit used in (Al-Shargi et al., 2016; Eskan-
der et al., 2016) which generates a morpho-
logical analyzer database in the representation
used in MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014) and
CALIMAEGY (Habash et al., 2012a). The conver-
sion was straightforward once we converted our
paradigm and lexicon database to the forms ex-
pected by the database generation tool. This con-
version included providing a POS tag for every
prefix, stem and suffix. We use the Buckwalter
POS tag style used by many other databases for
Arabic morphology (Graff et al., 2009; Habash et
al., 2012a).

4.10 Extending to Non-CODA Variants

The generated database at this point expects only
CODA input, which is not realistic for dealing
with raw dialectal text. We extended the database
for the set of complex prefixes (pronoun prefixes
and proclitics), complex suffixes (pronoun suffixes
and enclitics) and stems. For the complex affixes
we used the same extensions used in (Habash et
al., 2012a) as we don’t have enough annotated
data to learn from. As for the stems, we in-
flected the phonological roots that correspond to

the CODA roots in the lexicon to their respective
stems, which are mapped to the CODA stems in
the database. With these extensions we will be
able to correctly model a non-CODA input like
ñK. AK
 yAbw ‘they brought’ as correct CODA form
@ñK. Ag. jAbwA.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Experimental Setup
Dataset We used a part of an Emirati novel in
raw text from the Gumar corpus. We contextu-
ally annotated all the verbs appearing in first 4,000
words of the novel – a total of 620 verbs. The an-
notation includes identifying the CODA spelling,
full Buckwalter tag and the morphemic segmenta-
tion. Table 6 shows an annotation example of one
sentence from the data.

In this work we only use one dataset for the
evaluation as we didn’t use any feedback from the
evaluation in the current state of work, i.e., this
was a blind test.

Metrics We report token recall on verbs only.
We report in terms of CODA spelling, segmen-
tation and POS. We report in two modes of in-
put: raw input and CODA compliant input of the
same text. Token recall counts the percentage of
the time one of the analyses returned by the mor-
phological analyzer given a particular input word
matches the gold analysis of the input word in
the aspect evaluated (e.g., CODA, segmentation or
POS). This is similar to the evaluation carried by
Habash and Rambow (2006).

Systems We used six different analyzers for our
experiments.

• SAMA analyzer for MSA (Graff et al., 2009).
• CALIMAEGY for EGY, which includes MSA

(Habash et al., 2012a).

• CALIMAGLF for GLF.
• CALIMAGLF-CODA is CALIMAGLF without

the extensions discussed in 4.10.

• CALIMAGLF extended with SAMA.
• CALIMAGLF extended with CALIMAEGY.

5.2 Results
SAMA performs the least amongst all systems
in all aspects which is consistent with results re-
ported by Habash and Rambow (2006) and Khal-
ifa et al. (2016). CALIMAEGY performs much

better than SAMA which is also consistent with
previous results (Khalifa et al., 2016; Jarrar et
al., 2014). CALIMAGLF outperforms both SAMA
and CALIMAEGY on all measured conditions.
The merged forms of CALIMAGLF (with SAMA
and CALIMAEGY) outperform CALIMAGLF. The
best system we have is the result of merging
CALIMAGLF and CALIMAEGY, which effectively
includes GLF, EGY and MSA. The evaluation
of CALIMAGLF-CODA highlights the added value
of our non-CODA modeling, which contributed
to over 11% absolute increase in recall (from
CALIMAGLF-CODA to CALIMAGLF) for raw input
on all evaluated conditions.

5.3 Error Analysis

We conducted an error analysis on the analyzed
verbs for CALIMAGLF. We identified three main
sources of errors. First are typos in the raw
text which lead to no possible analysis. Ex-
amples include ÊK. @ Abls instead of �. Ë@ Albs
‘I wear’ and ðñÊ 	gX@ Adxlww instead of @ñÊ 	gX@
AdxlwA ‘come in’. These kinds of errors are
around 19%. Second are non-CODA-compliant
input words that lead to different segmentations

and POS, e.g., the word ú
Î
��@ AtSly (CODA

ú
Î
�� t+Sly ‘she prays’) is analyzed as AtSl+y

‘call! [FS]’. These make up around 18% of
errors. Third are the out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
cases, which for us include words with lemmas
not in our lexicon, or words with affixes not
modeled in our paradigms. For example, we
encountered some EGY-like verbal constructions
that we did not expect to see in GLF: ú
ÎJ
Ëñ

�®�K
tqwlyly ‘you[FS] tell me’ instead of ú
Î

	JJ
Ëñ�®�K tqw-
lynly, ú
Íð

	Y 	gA�K ‘you [P] take for me’ instead of
ú
Î

	Kð 	Y 	gA�K tAx*wnly. These cases are about 63%
of the errors. When we compare the performance
of our best system (CALIMAGLF+CALIMAEGY)
to CALIMAGLF, we note that the errors of the first
two types do not change, but there is a drop of 13%
absolute in the OOV error cases.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented CALIMAGLF, a morphological ana-
lyzer for GLF currently covering over 2,600 verbal
lemmas. CALIMAGLF verb analysis token recall
with CODA input outperforms both SAMA and

an CALIMAEGY by over 27.4% and 16.9% abso-
lute, respectively, in terms of identifying correct
POS tag. We plan to morphologically annotate a
large portion of the Gumar corpus to learn differ-
ent spelling variations and grow the coverage of
lemmas. We also plan to extend CALIMAGLF be-
yond verbs using those annotations. We also plan
to use a similar building process to create morpho-
logical analyzers and lexicons for other dialects
given the availability of resources.
