Abstract 

We conduct a corpus study to investigate the structure of multi-word expressions (MWEs) in 

the clinical domain. Based on an existing medical taxonomy, we develop an annotation scheme 

and label a sample of MWEs from a Dutch corpus with semantic and grammatical features. The 

analysis of the annotated data shows that the formal structure of clinical MWEs correlates with 

their conceptual properties. The insights gained from this study could inform the design of 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems for clinical writing, but also for other specialized 

genres.  

1 Introduction 

Meaning, in everyday language, is created by the interaction of words in context, not simply by the 

words themselves. Word combinations are governed by grammatical rules and semantic constraints. 

However, some sequences show a distinctive idiomaticity: They either occur with an outstanding 

frequency, defy grammatical rules or convey a meaning that goes beyond the sum of their parts (Baldwin 

and Kim, 2010). Over the past decades, a number of frameworks has been proposed to approach such 

sequences from different theoretical angles. Consequently, they have been variably referred to as 

collocations, lexical bundles or multi-word expressions (MWEs), to name but a few terms. MWEs attract 

continuous scientific attention, not only due to their prevalence in the lexicon (Jackendoff, 1997), but 

also because they are a crucial factor in the performance of NLP: A system that cannot handle idiomatic 

expressions will at least miss semantic nuances, or fail to interpret the input completely. 

Similarly, in specialized discourses, units of information are rarely encoded by a single term; instead, 

the majority of domain-specific concepts is referred to by MWEs, in particular, complex noun phrases 

(Daille, 1994; De Hertog & Heylen, 2012). Structured knowledge sources, which not only list the 

domain-specific vocabulary, but also model taxonomic relations, can serve to predict co-occurrences at 

the conceptual level. For instance, SNOMED CT (SNOMED International, 2018a) is a systematic 

medical terminology, which is primarily used to assign conceptual codes to electronic health records 

(EHRs). In SNOMED CT, each term is linked to a concept that belongs to a semantic category (e.g. 

findings, such as a symptom or a disease, and procedures, such as a method of investigation or therapy). 

Depending on the semantic category, each concept can be modified by a fixed set of qualifiers: A finding 

can be classified with regard to its severity, whereas a procedure can be specified with regard to the 

device used. However, this taxonomy provides little guidance about how the combination of the terms 

appears in practice. For instance, the MWE obese abdomen comprises two atomic concepts, the primary 

finding (obesity) and the anatomical site (abdomen). In Dutch, this observation can be expressed by a 

pre-modified noun phrase (abdominale obesitas ‘abdominal obesity’), an attributive construction 

(abdomen obees ‘abdomen obese’), a prepositional phrase (obesitas thv abdomen, which is short for 

obesitas ter hoogte van abdomen ‘obesity at the abdomen’), or a reduced version thereof (obesitas

abdomen ‘obesity abdomen’). Given the productivity of morpho-syntactic processes, the exhaustive 

listing of all possible forms is obviously impractical. 

According to cognitive theories of terminology, though, morpho-syntactic alternations in specialized 

terms are not arbitrary. Instead, variation is functional and can serve to convey different semantic 

nuances (Bowker & Hawkins, 2006; Faber et al., 2010). Likewise, constructional approaches to 

language posit that the pairing of syntactic structures with semantic components can create meaning in 

itself (Goldberg, 1995; Goldberg 2003). It is thus conceivable that habitual combinations of medical 

concepts pattern with particular structures at the formal level. If this is the case, such patterns could be 

leveraged to improve applications for clinical language processing, such as the automatic mapping of 

terms to ontological concepts. 

To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a corpus study, whereby we analyze sample of MWEs 

relating to different types of medical concepts. We develop an annotation scheme that captures 

grammatical and syntactic features of the MWE, and the semantic properties of the constituents. Using 

this annotation scheme, we analyze the interplay of semantic properties with the syntactic and 

grammatical structure of the MWEs, and their degree of lexicalization. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we give an overview of related 

research to sketch the background of this work. In Section 3, we present our methodology: After 

introducing our dataset, we outline our approach for the identification, annotation and evaluation of the 

MWEs. Following the summary of the results (Section 4), we discuss the main findings of our study. 

Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with the implications of our work for future research on the processing 

of MWEs. 

2 Background 

As the scope of phraseological studies has widened considerably over the past decades, the names and 

definitions of MWEs have proliferated. In this paper, we adopt the definition proposed by Baldwin and 

Kim (2010), who define MWEs as expressions that consist of multiple lexical items, and that are marked 

by idiomaticities at the lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical level. As Ramisch (2015) 

points out, this definition does not make any restrictions with regard to the granularity of the lexical 

items as they appear in the surface form; consequently, even orthographically joint forms, such as 

compound nouns can be considered MWEs. Likewise, this definition does not confine the notion of 

idiomatic behavior to one level of linguistic analysis. Traditionally, semantic opacity has been 

considered a  main property of MWEs (Choueka, 1988; Fillmore et al., 1988; Smadja, 1993); conversely, 

this approach allows to treat compositionality as a continuum, and include semantically opaque and fully 

compositional MWEs alike. 

With regard to languages for special purposes (LSPs), the central role of MWEs has long been 

acknowledged: Schulze and Römer (2008) emphasize that phraseological items are inseparably 

intertwined with the respective domain, as certain linguistic structures are instrumental to convey 

specialized meanings. The relationship between LSPs and their domain is thus dialectal in nature: While 

the language is a central constituent of the domain, the domain shapes the communicative needs. These 

needs shape syntactic and morphological patterns, which become consolidated through repeated usage. 

Faber and Léon-Araùz (2016) propose a taxonomy of phraseal context factors, which is based on 

scope (local vs. global) and the dimension of linguistic analysis (syntactic, semantic or pragmatic). In 

this framework, MWEs are interpreted as a form of local context, whereby recurrent contexts can be 

modelled by syntagmatic grammatical patterns. Crucially, they observe a mutual attraction between 

syntactic and semantic structures; therefore, grammatical sequences and semantic relations should not 

be studied in isolation. 

Similar patterns have been observed with nominal compounds. In general, the semantic relation 

between the constituents is indeterminable, as the underlying relation has been deleted or submerged as 

part of the compounding process (Levi, 1978). The full meaning can thus only be inferred through 

domain knowledge (Cabezas-García & San Martín, 2017). However, ten Hacken (2015) notes that, in 

biomedical compounds, the grammatical properties of the headword can give an indication of the 

relationship with the other constituent (i.e. the non-head). 

Thus far, however, the analysis of medical MWEs has mostly focused on the biomedical domain, both 

with regard to phraseal expressions (e.g. Léon & Divasson, 2006; Laso & John, 2013; Lossio-Ventura, 



20

 

 

Jonquet, Roche & Teisseire, 2016) and compounds (e.g. Cabezas-García & San Martín, 2017; Yadav et 

al., 2017). Meanwhile, the usage of MWEs in clinical practice has received relatively little attention. 

One obvious reason for this asymmetry is that clinical datasets are notoriously difficult to obtain. In 

English, a number of datasets has been labelled with medical identifiers (i.e. codes from a structured 

knowledge source such as SNOMED CT) and made available in the context of shared tasks, such as the 

i2b2 challenges (i2b2 National Center for Biomedical Computing, 2018) and the CLEF eHealth 

evaluation labs (CLEF eHealth, 2018). In addition, a number of corpora has also been annotated with 

semantic relations, PoS tags and, to varying depths, syntactic structure (e.g. Pakhomov, Coden & Chute, 

2006; Roberts et al., 2009; Uzuner, Solti & Cadag, 2010; Uzuner, South, Shen & DuVall, 2011; Sum, 

Rumshisky & Uzuner, 2013; Albright et al., 2013; Styler et al., 2014; Savkov et al., 2016). However, for 

languages other than English, the distribution of clinical datasets is severely limited by the even more 

complex privacy regulations outside of the United States (cf. Névéol et al., 2018 for a comprehensive 
review). Still, an increasing number of – albeit not shareable – datasets has been annotated with both 

semantic and syntactic information, e.g. for Portuguese (Oleynik et al., 2010), Polish (Marciniak & 

Mykowiecka, 2011), Finnish (Haverinen et al., 2011; Laippala et al. 2014), Spanish (Costumero et al., 

2014; Oronoz et al., 2015) and French (Deléger et al. 2017). In Dutch, clinical corpora have been labelled 

with features relating to negation, temporality and experiencer (Afzal et al., 2014) and codes from ICD-

9 (Scheurwegs et al., 2017). However, we are not aware of any annotation projects that cover syntactic 

or grammatical properties of clinical Dutch; this paper thus presents a first attempt to fill this gap. 

3 Methods 

3.1 Corpus Structure 

Our analysis is based on a corpus of Dutch EHRs provided by the department of endocrinology of a 

Belgian hospital. In total, this corpus consists of 14,999 documents and covers the medical history of 

500 patients. All patients are diagnosed with diabetes and visit the hospital in regular intervals for a 

check-up. During these consultations, they report on their own assessment of their condition (e.g. the 

self-monitoring of the glucose level) and undergo a set of routine procedures (e.g. the screening for 

microalbuminuria). The EHR serves to summarize the outcome of these procedures, to give 

recommendations for further therapy (e.g. a change in insulin dose) or suggest additional interventions 

(e.g. the transplantation of beta-cells).  

A selection of EHRs was manually annotated by five students with a background in biomedical 

sciences. During the annotation stage, they annotated the complete medical histories of individual 

patients with clinical codes. They were instructed to identify all medical terms, including non-standard 

term variants, and link them to the corresponding concept identifier from SNOMED CT (SNOMED 

International, 2018a). At the end of this stage, the annotation of 179 cases had been completed; 300.693 

medical entities were identified, relating to 16,151 unique terms and 7,945 concepts. During the 

validation stage, three annotators verified the term-concept associations. They were presented with a list 

of unique pairs of terms and concept codes and asked to confirm the correctness of the assigned code, 

and rate the domain pertinence of the concept (i.e. whether it is specific to the domain of endocrinology). 

To estimate the consistency of their judgements, a part of the term-concept pairs was validated by all 

annotators; the interrater agreement, as calculated by Fleiss’ kappa, was substantial (ĸ=0.62). After 

filtering out those terms that had been judged as incorrectly annotated during the second stage, we 

retained 7,687 concepts, corresponding to 15,025 unique terms and 274,082 entities for further analysis. 

3.2 Phrase Types included for Analysis 

For our study of MWEs, we include nominal phrases with external modifiers as well as compounds. In 

Dutch, external modifiers can precede or follow the head noun, whereby the grammatical form of the 

modifier constrains its relative position (Broekhuis, Keizer & den Dikken, 2012). Pre-nominal modifiers 

can be adjectives (e.g. lichte hypertensie ‘light hypertension’) or participles (e.g. IgE-gemedieerde 

allergie ‘IgE(Immunoglobulin E)-mediated allergy’); post-nominal modifiers can be prepositional 

phrases (e.g. eczeem aan de handen ‘eczema at the hands’), relative clauses (e.g. hypertensie die hier 

wordt opgevolgd ‘hypertension which is followed up here’), participles (e.g. pijn uitstralend naar 

schouders ‘pain radiating to shoulders’) or adverbials (e.g. hypoglycemie postprandiaal ‘postprandial 

hypoglycemia’). Dutch compounds are right-headed. While combinations with other grammatical types 



21

 

 

are possible (e.g. rechterbovenbeen ‘right upper leg’), the juxtaposition of two nouns (e.g. nierfalen 

‘kidney failure’) is most productive (Booij, 2007). Many medical compounds contain neoclassical 

elements, either in combination with each other (e.g. pancreastransplantatie ‘pancreas transplantation’), 

or with Dutch lexemes (e.g. corfalen ‘heart failure’). However, in many neoclassical compounds, the 

left element (i.e. the non-head) cannot be used as an independent word (e.g. hypertensie ‘hypertension’). 

Depending on whether such elements occur in their full or abbreviated form, they have been defined as 

confixes (including pseudoprefixes and pseudosuffixes), or splinters in the literature (Meesters, 2004; 

Džuganová, 2013). In this study, we do not consider confixes and splinters as separate lexical elements. 

Consequently, a term such as hypertensie will be treated as a single noun, rather than a compound. 

3.3 Retrieval of MWEs for Annotation 

We focus on MWEs relating to concepts from 2 semantic categories, namely procedures and findings. 

To select a set of concepts for each category, we first rank all concepts referring to either procedures or 

findings by their absolute frequencies in the annotated part of the corpus. We retrieve the associated 

terms for the top nine concepts per category. After reviewing the variants linked to one concept, we 

manually compile a list of lexical stems to retrieve all occurrences of the associated terms. The 

generation of these stems is based on practical considerations, rather than linguistic criteria. For instance, 

to retrieve occurrences of the term hypertensie ‘hypertension’, we use the clipped form hypert rather 

than the lexical stem of the headword (tensie). The reason is that, firstly, the stem tensie would produce 

a high number of false positives, i.e. matches where the term is used in a different context than that of 

the target concept (e.g. tensies thuis ‘tensions at home’, which refers to the measurement of the blood 

pressure in the home setting); secondly, this stem would miss those instances where the clipped variant 

is used verbatim (e.g. lichte hypert op rpl, which is short for lichte hypertensie op raadpleging ‘light 

hypertension during consultation’). 

Then, we match these stems against the entire corpus. For each match, we extract the term along with 

the three adjacent tokens in the left and right context. Altogether, we identify 63,559 instances of 

procedures and 59,731 of findings. Tables 1 and 2 provide examples of the target concepts, terms and 

lexical stems for both semantic categories.

Table 2. Concepts, terms and lexical stems used for the identification of MWEs relating to procedures. 

 
Next, we review the matches to identify all noun phrases where one of the target terms is the syntactic 

head of the phrase, and where the context conveys medically relevant information. After filtering out 

those instances that do not fulfill these grammatical and semantic criteria, we retain 11,354 expressions 

of procedures, and 13,537 expressions of findings. Finally, we sort the expressions by the relative 

position of the modifier (i.e. left- vs. right-branching). Among the left-branching expressions, we further 

distinguish between compound nouns and noun phrases with an external modifier (e.g. a pre-modifying 

adjective). All compound nouns are split into their constituents for further analysis. This leads to a 3-



22

 

 

way-distinction between phrase types. Table 3 gives an overview of the different phrase types by 

semantic category.

3.4 Annotation of MWEs with PoS Values and Semantic Features 

For the annotation of the MWEs, we use WebAnno, a web-based tool for linguistic annotations (de 

Castilho et al., 2016). We create two layers of annotation (grammatical and semantic), and define a 

custom tagset at each level. 

Grammatical level: For the tagging of PoS values, we use the tagset introduced in the Penn 

Guidelines for the annotation of biomedical text (Warner et al., 2012). Compared to the original Penn 

tagset (Santorini, 1990), this extended version contains 4 additional labels, AFX (unbound affix), GW 

(mistranscription), HYPH (unbound hyphen) and XX (uninterpretable material). These additional tags 

have been introduced to handle the particular linguistic features of clinical writing, such as non-

canonical spelling variants, ad-hoc abbreviations and undecipherable forms. Similar to Fan et al. (2013), 

we follow the tagging conventions described in these guidelines, but adjust them to the properties of our 

data: In the original guidelines, the distinction between common nouns and proper nouns is primarily 

based on the capitalization of the full form. However, we find that this is not a viable strategy in our 

case, as orthographic conventions are not followed strictly in our data. Instead, we reserve the tags for 

proper nouns (i.e. NNP for singular, and NNPS for plural forms) to eponyms (e.g. hashimoto, which 

refer to ‘Hashimoto’s disease’) and commercial names (e.g. NovoRapid, which is the registered 

tradename of an insulin product). In addition, for abbreviations and misspellings, we used the same tag 

as for the canonical full form, if it can be determined; otherwise, we tag them with the label for un-

interpretable material (XX).  

Semantic level: For the annotation of conceptual properties, we create a tagset based on the attributes 

described in the Editorial Guide of SNOMED CT (SNOMED International, 2018b). This guide defines 

a set of properties that can be used in conjunction with particular semantic types. For instance, a finding 

can be modified with regard to its clinical course (e.g. acute, chronic) or severity (e.g. mild, moderate); 

a procedure can be specified by the device used (e.g. a catheter), or the direct substance (e.g. a 

pharmacological agent used for injection). Semantically empty tokens, such as function words, are 

skipped on the semantic level. Table 4 provides examples for different types of attributes combining 

with findings and procedures respectively.

‘abdominal obesity’ 

Substance injectie insuline

Table 4. Examples of different attribute types combining with findings and procedures. 

3.5 Analysis of Grammatico-semantic Patterns 

With our study, we aim to answer two questions: Firstly, we investigate whether there is a correlation 

between the semantic category of the headword and the preferred phrase types. This will also give an 



23

 

 

indication of the average degree of lexicalization of the different categories. Secondly, we examine 

whether fixed concept combinations pattern with particular grammatical constructions. We thus analyze 

the annotated MWEs in two stages. 

Correlation between semantic categories, preferred phrase types and the degree of 

lexicalization: For both findings and procedures, we calculate the absolute and relative frequencies of 

the individual phrase types, as well as the average length in tokens. For each phrase type, we group the 

expressions by their paired tag sequences; all expressions that have identical annotations at both the 

semantic and PoS layer are thus associated with one pattern. To evaluate the degree of lexicalization, 

we count the unique expressions per pattern. This value thus indicates if the associated patterns serve as 

productive templates, which allow for paradigmatic changes of the lexical elements, or if they 

correspond to frozen expressions, which are fully lexicalized in usage. 

Patterning of concept combinations with grammatical constructions: For a more fine-grained 

analysis of the grammatical structure, we focus on the five most frequent concept combinations per 

category. To identify these, we make an inventory of all possible constellations of semantic constituents 

(e.g. procedure and anatomical site; procedure and substance) and rank them by their absolute 

frequency. For the top five combinations, we extract all patterns (i.e. paired tag sequences) that 

instantiate these semantic combinations. For instance, for the semantic combination procedure and site, 

we identify the patterns ‘procedure/NN, site/NN’ and ‘site/JJ, procedure/NN’, whereby the tags ‘NN’ 

and ‘JJ’ refer nouns and adjectives respectively. For the combination of procedure and substance, we 

retrieve the patterns ‘substance/NN, procedure/NN’ and ‘procedure/NN, substance/NN’. For each 

grammatico-semantic pattern, we calculate the frequency relative to all patterns that express the 

underlying semantic combination. 

4 Results 

Distribution of phrase types and degree of lexicalization: The distribution of phrase types varies 

considerably between the semantic categories. While compounds only make up a minor share of the 

patterns for findings, they are the dominant phrase type among procedures. Conversely, left-branching 

phrases with external modifiers are the preferred type for findings, whereas they account for a relatively 

small portion of the procedures. For right-branching phrases though, the proportions are almost equal. 

Regardless of the phrase type, the average length of the expressions is longer for findings than for 

procedures. In general, the right-branching expressions are longer than pre-modified phrases and 

compounds. Overall, the average number of unique expressions by pattern is higher among the 

procedures, which indicates a lower degree of lexicalization. However, even though the relative 

frequencies of the individual phrase types vary across semantic categories, we note similar global trends 

with regard to their productivity: For both findings and procedures, the left-branching phrases are the 

most productive phrase type, followed by the right-branching phrases. Compounds, on the other hand, 

appear less variable, hence more lexicalized, for both semantic categories. The full results are provided 

in Tables 5 and 6. 

Patterning of concept combinations with PoS sequences: With both findings and procedures, we 

observe a highly skewed frequency distribution of the concept combinations. For both categories, the 

top 5 combinations of semantic constituents account for roughly two thirds of all identified MWEs. 

Findings are typically specified with regard to their cause, clinical course, severity, the anatomical site 

or time. Procedures co-occur mostly with modifiers relating to components, abstract properties, the time 

or anatomical site. Likewise, the individual concept combinations are strongly dominated by single PoS 

sequences. On average, the most frequent PoS sequence accounts for more than half of all MWEs that 

express a given combination (67.4% for findings, 58.3% for procedures). However, there are striking 

differences with regard to the preferred grammatical structure. Among the findings, all top patterns 

consist of left-branching noun phrases, whereby the headword is pre-modified by an adverb, or by one 

or more adjectives (e.g veneuze pulmonale hypertensie ‘venous pulmonary hypertension’). By contrast, 

among the procedures, purely nominal sequences prevail; these take either the form of compounds (e.g. 

lipiden meting ‘measurement of lipids’), or reduced prepositional phrases, where the subordinating 

preposition is left out (e.g. rx thorax ‘x-ray of the chest’). Among the procedures, 3 of the 5 concept 

combinations contain plural forms, which do not appear in the PoS patterns for findings. Tables 7 and 8

In sum, both levels of analysis provide evidence for the interplay of conceptual properties with 

grammatical structure: The majority of MWEs referring to findings consists of left-branching phrases 

with an external modifier; the grammatical structure of the most frequent concept combinations is nearly 

identical. By contrast, the procedures show a clear preference for nominal constructions, in particular 

compounds and reduced prepositional phrases. In general, though, MWEs of this category are more 

variable, which manifests itself in both lexical and morpho-syntactic alternations.

5 Discussion 

Our results illustrate the interdependency of form and meaning in the expression of complex medical 

concepts. This finding corroborates the observation that “special and specialized information is 

entrenched in linguistic structures” (Schulze and Römer, 2008). 

Firstly, the semantic type of the headword co-determines preferences for particular phrase types. In 

particular, with left-branching MWEs headed by procedures, nominal compounds are most frequent; 

with findings, phrases pre-modified by adjectives prevail. This tendency can be partly attributed to the 

predominance of a small number of fixed concept combinations. For some types of concepts, the 

corresponding terms are morphologically inflexible, which enforces the use of particular phrase types. 

For instance, procedures can combine with terms relating to substances, such as injectie insuline 

‘injection of insulin’. For lack of a derived adjective, the use of a nominal construction is – at least in 

Dutch – obligatory. On the other hand, findings are often specified with regard to their clinical course 

or severity (morbiede obesitas ‘morbid obesity’), where no semantically equivalent noun form is 

available. However, this tendency prevails in cases where both grammatical types – nouns and derived 

adjectives – are available; thus, it cannot be explained by the lack of particular word forms alone. 

Instead, it seems that grammatical structures are instrumental to convey certain semantic relations. In 

MWEs relating to procedures, the headwords are typically combined with terms referring to concrete 

entities, which are the direct object of the act itself; this core relation seems to be strongly linked to 

nominal constructions. On the other hand, findings are characterized with regard to inherent properties 

as they manifest themselves to the observer; such qualities clearly pattern with attributive adjectives. 

The association between grammatical patterns and semantic relations also accounts for the asymmetrical 

distribution of reduced phrase types. For instance, the elision of function words is acceptable in some 

semantic constellations, but not in others. Given the default relation between two nominal constituents 

(‘A is the object of B’), the omission of a preposition is acceptable in phrases combining a procedure 

and an anatomical site, component or substance (e.g. echografie halsvaten ‘echography of the neck 

vessels’). By contrast, such an underspecified construction cannot be used for other types of relations. 

For example, to specify the etiological relation between a cause and a finding, the full phrase must be 

used (e.g. nefropathie tgv diabetes, which is short for nefropathie ten gevolge van diabetes ‘nephropathy 

resulting from diabetes’, but not *nefropathie diabetes ‘nephropathy diabetes’). 

Secondly, the semantic type influences the variability of the MWEs, both at the lexical, and at the 

grammatico-syntactic level. Overall, MWEs referring to findings are strongly lexicalized. This may be 

partly explained by the fact that, for the most frequent concept combinations, the set of potential 

modifiers is rather confined. For instance, for most findings, there is only a small number of medically 

attested causes; this limits the number of combining concepts, and consequently, that of individual 

expressions. However, even in combination with modifiers of time or severity, which do not underlie 

such rigid conceptual restrictions, the strong dominance of individual PoS patterns prevails. By contrast, 

MWEs relating to procedures are more flexible; they serve as productive templates that allow for the 

paradigmatic insertion of different concepts. This increases the potential for variation in the syntactic 

and grammatical form.

6 Conclusion 

MWEs are dense units of information, which enable the concise expression of complex concepts. They 

play a pivotal role in specialized discourses, as they allow speakers to interact in a precise, yet 

economical way. Their communicative power resides both in the use of domain-specific terminology, 

and that of particular constructions, which support the nuanced encoding of meanings and relations. 

Therefore, the automatic processing of specialized texts crucially depends on their correct interpretation. 

The detailed study of specialized corpora is essential to identify such constructions. In this paper, we 

have presented an analysis of MWEs in clinical usage. Using a structured terminology as a starting point, 

we have exploited the relations defined in this taxonomy to design an annotation scheme, which allowed 

us to capture regularities at both the grammatical and the semantic level. While our analysis was 

confined to a narrow selection of medical concepts, the approach could easily be expanded to a wider 

range of concepts, or transferred to other domains. Such analyses would lead to valuable insights about 

the structure of specialized MWEs, which could inform the design of more advanced applications for 

semantic reasoning.
