Abstract

Political debates offer a rare opportunity for
citizens to compare the candidates’ positions
on the most controversial topics of the cam-
paign. Thus they represent a natural applica-
tion scenario for Argument Mining. As ex-
isting research lacks solid empirical investiga-
tion of the typology of argument components
in political debates, we fill this gap by propos-
ing an Argument Mining approach to politi-
cal debates. We address this task in an em-
pirical manner by annotating 39 political de-
bates from the last 50 years of US presidential
campaigns, creating a new corpus of 29k ar-
gument components, labeled as premises and
claims. We then propose two tasks: (1) iden-
tifying the argumentative components in such
debates, and (2) classifying them as premises
and claims. We show that feature-rich SVM
learners and Neural Network architectures out-
perform standard baselines in Argument Min-
ing over such complex data. We release the
new corpus USElecDeb60To16 and the ac-
companying software under free licenses to
the research community.

1 Introduction

Political debates are public interviews where the
candidates of elections are requested to confront
each other on topics such as unemployment, taxes,
and foreign policy. During presidential elections
in the US, it is customary for the main candidates
of the two largest parties, i.e., the Democratic
and the Republican Parties, to engage in a debate
around the most controversial issues of the time.
Such debates are considered as a de facto elec-
tion process, and in some cases they have nearly
decided the outcomes of the elections (Coleman
et al., 2015).

Given the importance of these debates and
their innate argumentative features, they represent

a natural playground for Argument(ation) Min-
ing (AM) methods (Peldszus and Stede, 2013;
Lippi and Torroni, 2016b; Cabrio and Villata,
2018). AM deals with analyzing argumentation
in various domains, such as legal cases (Mochales
and Moens, 2011), persuasive essays (Stab and
Gurevych, 2017), clinical trials (Mayer et al.,
2018) and scientific articles (Teufel et al., 2009).
The ability of identifying argumentative compo-
nents and predicting their relations in such a
kind of texts opens the door to cutting-edge tasks
like fallacy detection, fact-checking, and counter-
argumentation generation.

Despite the plethora of existing approaches and
annotated corpora for AM, very few of them
tackle the issue of mining argumentative structures
from political debates (Lippi and Torroni, 2016a;
Menini et al., 2018; Duthie and Budzynska, 2018;
Visser et al., 2019). To be best of our knowledge,
none of them take on the identification of argu-
ment components (i.e., premises and claims) on a
large corpus of political debates. This paper fills
this gap by (1) performing a large-scale annotation
study over 50 years of US presidential campaigns
from 1960 (Nixon vs. Kennedy) to 2016 (Trump
vs. Clinton), resulting in 29k annotated argument
components, and (2) experimenting with feature-
rich SVM learners and neural architectures out-
performing standard baselines in Argument Min-
ing. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility of our
experiments, we provide all data and source codes
under free licenses.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses the related work and compares it to the
proposed approach. In Section 3, we present the
corpus of political debates we built along with
some examples from the annotation guidelines.
Section 4 describes the experimental setting, re-
ports on the obtained results and discusses the
main errors which occurred.

2 Background and related work

AM is “the general task of analyzing discourse on
the pragmatics level and applying a certain argu-
mentation theory to model and automatically an-
alyze the data at hand” (Habernal and Gurevych,
2017). Two tasks are crucial in Argument Mining:
i) Argument component detection in the input text:
this step may be further split in the detection of
argument components (i.e., claims and premises)
and of their textual boundaries. Different meth-
ods have been tested, like Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM) (e.g., (Lippi and Torroni, 2016c)),
Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers (Duthie et al., 2016), Lo-
gistic Regression (Levy et al., 2014) and Neu-
ral Networks (Stab and Gurevych, 2017), and ii)
Prediction of the relations holding between the
argumentative components (i.e., attacks and sup-
ports). Relations can be predicted between argu-
ments (Cabrio and Villata, 2013) or between argu-
ment components (Stab and Gurevych, 2017).

Regarding political debates, (Menini et al.,
2018) predict relations on speeches of the Nixon-
Kennedy campaign considering only annotations
on the relations among such arguments. (Lippi and
Torroni, 2016a) focus on the 2015 UK election de-
bates to study the impact of vocal features from
the speeches on the identification of claims in de-
bates. They built a small corpus of political de-
bates annotated with premises and claims. (Duthie
and Budzynska, 2018) proposed the ethos mining
task aiming at detecting ethotic arguments and the
relations among the politicians and the parties in
the UK Parliament. Sentences are annotated as
being ethotic arguments or not. (Basave and He,
2016) studied the use of semantic frames for mod-
elling argumentation in speakers’ discourse. They
investigated the impact of argumentation as a in-
fluence rank indicator for politicians on the 20
debates for the Republican primary election. Fi-
nally, (Visser et al., 2019) present a dataset com-
posed of the transcripts of televised political de-
bates leading up to the 2016 presidential election
in the US, with the addition of the reactions from
the social media platform Reddit. The corpus is
annotated based on the Inference Anchoring The-
ory, and not with argument components. Contrary
to past works, we create a huge annotated dataset
including 39 political debates, and we present a
successful attempt to argument component detec-
tion on such a big corpus of political debates.

3 Dataset creation

The USElecDeb60To16 v.01 dataset was collected
from the website of the Commission on Presiden-
tial Debates1, which provided transcripts of the de-
bates broadcasted on TV and held among the lead-
ing candidates for the presidential and vice presi-
dential nominations in the US. USElecDeb60To16
includes the debates starting from Kennedy and
Nixon in 1960 until those between Clinton and
Trump in 2016. Table 1 provides some statis-
tics on the dataset in terms of number of turns
in the conversations, of sentences and of words
in the transcripts. The unique properties of this
dataset are its size (see Table 1), its peculiar na-
ture of containing reciprocal discussions (mainly
between Democrats and Republicans), and its time
line structure. The motivation for creating a new
corpus is twofold: i) to the best of our knowl-
edge, no other big corpus on political debates an-
notated at a argument component level for Argu-
ment Mining exists, and ii) we ensure the repro-
ducibility of the annotation, writing guidelines, in-
spired from (Rinott et al., 2015; Lippi and Torroni,
2016a), with precise rules for identifying and seg-
menting argument components (i.e., claims and
premises) in political debates.2

In the following, we detail the annotation of the
argument components through examples from the
USElecDeb60To16 dataset.

Claims. Being them the ultimate goal of an ar-
gument, in the context of political debates, claims
can be a policy advocated by a party or a candi-
date to be undertaken which needs to be justified
in order to be accepted by the audience. In Exam-
ple 1,3 Bush is defending the decisions taken by
his administration by claiming that his policy has
been effective. Claims might also provide judg-
ments about the other candidate or parties (Exam-
ple 2).

1. Bush-Kerry, September 30, 2004:
BUSH: My administration started what’s called the
Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations
involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of infor-
mation and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.
And [we’ve been effective]. [We busted the A.Q. Khan
network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that
was selling secrets to places like North Korea and
Libya]. [We convinced Libya to disarm].

2. Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960:
NIXON: [I believe the programs that Senator
Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle
those creative energies], [I believe in other words,
that his program would lead to the stagnation of the
motive power that we need in this country to get
progress].

3. Kennedy-Nixon, October 13, 1960:
NIXON: Senator Kennedy’s position and mine com-
pletely different on this. [I favor the present depletion
allowance]. [I favor it not because I want to make a lot
of oil men rich], but because [I want to make America
rich]. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because
[this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to
go out and explore for oil, to develop it].

Taking a stance towards a controversial subject, or
an opinion towards a specific issue is also con-
sidered as a claim (e.g., “I’ve opposed the death
penalty during all of my life”). The presence of
discourse indicators (e.g., “in my opinion”, “I be-
lieve”) is generally a useful hint in finding claims
that state opinions and judgments.

Premises. Premises are assertions made by the
debaters for supporting their claims (i.e., reasons
or justifications). A type of premise commonly
used by candidates is referring to past experi-
ence: more experienced candidates exploit this
technique to assert that their claims are more rel-
evant than their opponents because of their past
experience (Example 4).

4. Carter-Ford, September 23, 1976:
CARTER: [Well among my other experiences in the

3In the examples, claims are marked in bold, premises in
Italics and the component boundaries by [square brackets].

past, I’ve - I’ve been a nuclear engineer, and did grad-
uate work in this field]. [I think I know the - the uh
capabilities and limitations of atomic power].

Statistics are very commonly used as evidence
to justify the claims (Example 6). Moreover,
premises may be asserted in the form of examples
(in such cases, they may contain discourse indica-
tors to introduce examples and justifications, such
as “because”).

5. Nixon-Kennedy, September 26, 1960:
NIXON: We often hear gross national product dis-
cussed and in that respect may I say that [when we
compare the growth in this administration with that of
the previous administration that then there was a total
growth of eleven percent over seven years]; [in this ad-
ministration there has been a total growth of nineteen
percent over seven years]. [That shows that there’s
been more growth in this Administration than in its
predecessor].

6. Clinton-Dole, October 6, 1996:
CLINTON: [We have ten and a half million more jobs,
a faster job growth rate than under any Republican ad-
ministration since the 1920s]. [Wages are going up for
the first time in a decade]. [We have record numbers
of new small businesses]. [We have the biggest drop
in the number of people in poverty in 27 years]. [All
groups of people are growing]. [We had the biggest
drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995]. [The
average family’s income has gone up over $1600 just
since our economic plan passed]. So [I think it’s clear
that we’re better off than we were four years ago].

Three expert annotators defined the annotation
guidelines, then three other annotators carried out
the annotation task relying on such guidelines.
Each transcript has been independently annotated
by at least two annotators4. 86% of the sentences,
which were annotated at least with one compo-
nent, were tagged with only one argument compo-
nent, while the remaining 14% with more than one
component (7% with both claims and premises).5

Only 0.6% of the dataset contains cross-sentence
annotations (i.e., annotations which are not bound
in one sentence). 19 debates have been inde-
pendently annotated by three annotators to mea-
sure the IAA. The observed agreement percentage
and IAA at sentence-level (following (Stab and
Gurevych, 2014)) are respectively 0.83% and κ =
0.57 (moderate agreement) for argumentative-non
argumentative sentences, and 63% and κ = 0.4
(fair agreement) for the argument components.
Such annotation tasks are very difficult with po-
litical debates. In many examples, the choice be-
tween a premise and a claim is hard to define. In

4We used the Brat annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012).
5A component cannot be both a claim and a premise (see

Guidelines).



4687

Example 7, the sentence “the way Senator [...]” is
used as a premise for the previous claim, but if ob-
served out of this context, it can be identified as
a claim. This justifies the IAA on the argument
component annotation.

7. McCain-Obama, October 15, 2008:
OBAMA: [I disagree with Senator McCain in how
to do it], because [the way Senator McCain has de-
signed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we’re
buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot
less]?.

To release a consistent dataset, in the reconcil-
iation phase we computed the IAA of the annota-
tors with two other expert annotators with back-
ground in computational linguistics on a sample
of 6 debates. In case of disagreement among the
first three annotators, the annotation provided by
the annotator which showed to be consistently in
line with the expert annotators (i.e., with a higher
IAA) was included in the released dataset.
After the reconciliation phase, the USE-
lecDeb60To16 dataset contains the annotation of
29521 argument components (i.e., 16087 claims
and 13434 premises). Notice that the number
of claims is higher than the number of premises,
because in political speeches the candidates make
arguments mostly without providing premises for
their claims. Moreover, the candidates use longer
sentences (more words) to express their premises
than their claims.

For our experiments, we split the dataset into
train (13894 components), validation (6577 com-
ponents) and test (9050 components) sets, keeping
the same component distribution as in the original
dataset.

4 Experimental setting

We address the argument component detection
task as two subsequent classification steps, i.e., the
argumentative sentences detection (Task 1), and
the argumentative components identification (Task
2). We address both of these classification tasks at
the sentence level (e.g., we label a sentence ac-
cording to the longest component annotated in the
sentence).

Methods For Task 1, we trained both a linear-
kernel SVM with stochastic gradient descent
learning method using bag of words features only,
and a SVM classifier with rbf kernel (python
scikit-learn v0.20.1, penalty parameter=10) us-
ing the features listed below to distinguish argu-

mentative sentences (i.e., sentences which con-
tain at least one argument component) from the
non-argumentative ones. For comparison, we also
tested a Neural Network structured with two bidi-
rectional LSTM layers (Hochreiter and Schmid-
huber, 1997) using word embeddings from Fast-
Text (Joulin et al., 2016; Mikolov et al., 2018) as
the weights for the embedding layer. The output
layer determines the class Argumentative/Non-
Argumentative for the input sentence. A feed-
forward Neural Network was also trained using
the same sentence-based features used with the
SVM classifier. This network consists of two hid-
den layers with 64 and 32 neurons for the 1st and
2nd hidden layer, respectively.

As for the component classification step, we ap-
plied the same classifiers as for Task 1 (SVM and
LSTM). For both tasks, we implemented the ma-
jority baseline for argument component classifica-
tion used in (Stab and Gurevych, 2017).

We considered the following features: tf-idf
of each word, NGram (bigrams and trigrams),
POS of adverbs, adjectives (used by debaters to
stress the correctness of their premises), different
tenses of verbs and modal verbs (they often af-
fect the certainty of the assertions, hence would
be a hint of facts/non-facts in discerning between
argument components), syntactic features (con-
stituency parse trees, dept of the parsing tree), dis-
course connectives (and their position), NER (de-
baters often mention party members, former pres-
idents, organizations and dates or numbers like
statistics as examples to strengthen the premises
for the claims), semantic features (sentiment po-
larity of the argument component and of its cover-
ing sentence (Menini et al., 2018)).

Evaluation Tables 2 and 3 present the re-
sults obtained on detecting argumentative sen-
tences (Task 1) and classifying argumentative
components (Task 2), respectively. Results ob-
tained with linear-kernel SVM significantly out-
performed the majority baseline in both tasks. En-
riching the feature-set increased the classification
performances by 9% on Task 1 using the rbf-
kernel SVM, while only by 2.2% on Task 2. Run-
ning ablation tests for features analysis, we no-
ticed that the lexical features (tf-idf and NGram
features) strongly contribute to performance in-
crease in both tasks. NER features – selected
on the assumption that they would have improved
the detection of premises as candidate tend to use



4688

NERs to provide examples – showed to be more
effective in Task 1 only. Sentiment and discourse
indicator features did not show to be effective in
either classification tasks. Results obtained by
LSTM with word-embedding as features in both
tasks are comparable to that of the SVM using all
the features, showing the efficiency of neural clas-
sifiers on AM tasks using less dimensionality for
the input data.

Table 3: Classification results on Task 2.

Given the complexity of the task, we computed
the human upper bound as the average F-score of
the annotation agreement between annotators and
the gold-standard. It resulted in 0.87 and 0.75
on argumentative vs. non-argumentative, and 0.74
and 0.65 on claims and premises, respectively.

Error Analysis Argumentative sentences are
rarely misclassified, which results in high recall
on argumentative sentence identification. Some
patterns can be identified from the misclassified
non-argumentative sentences. One of these pat-
terns appears in very short non-argumentative sen-
tences which contain an argument indicator such

as “so”, for instance the sentence: “So what should
we do?” is classified as argumentative although in
the context it is considered a non-argumentative
sentence. Since indicators for claims are more
numerous in these debates, this misclassification
mostly occurs when a claim-indicator is uttered by
the candidate in a non-argumentative manner.

In other cases, candidates make final remarks
phrasing their speech with a structure similar to
argumentative sentences, for example: “I think
when you make that decision, it might be well if
you would ask yourself, are you better off than you
were four years ago?”.

Misclassification between claims and premises,
instead, is primarily due to the fact that the com-
ponent classification is highly dependent on the
structure of the argument.

5 Conclusion

We investigated the detection of argument compo-
nents in the US presidential campaign debates: i)
providing a manually annotated resource of 29k
argument components, and ii) evaluating feature-
rich SVM learners and Neural Networks on such
data (achieving ∼90% w.r.t. human performance).
We highlighted the strengths (e.g., satisfactory
performances on different oratory styles across
time and topics) and weaknesses (e.g., no argu-
ment boundaries detection on a clause level, the
context of the whole debates is not considered).

For future work, we plan to i) automatically
predict relations between argument components in
the USElecDeb60To16 dataset, and ii) propose a
new task, i.e., fallacy detection so that common
fallacies in political argumentation (Zurloni and
Anolli, 2010) can be automatically identified, in
line with the work of (Habernal et al., 2018).
