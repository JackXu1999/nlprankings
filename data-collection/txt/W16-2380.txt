Abstract
This paper describes our submission
UFAL MULTIVEC to the WMT16 Qual-
ity Estimation Shared Task, for English-
German sentence-level post-editing effort
prediction and ranking. Our approach ex-
ploits the power of bilingual distributed
representations, word alignments and also
manual post-edits to boost the perfor-
mance of the baseline QuEst++ set of
features. Our model outperforms the
baseline, as well as the winning system
in WMT15, Referential Translation Ma-
chines (RTM), in both scoring and ranking
sub-tasks.

1 Introduction

Recently, the task of quality estimation (QE) for
machine translation (MT) output attracted inter-
est among researchers in the machine translation
community. QE systems play an important role in
improving post-editing efficiency (in terms of the
time and effort) in different ways, e.g. by filtering
out low quality translations to avoid spending time
post-editing them, or by providing end-users with
an estimate on how good or bad the translation is.

In 2012, WMT established the first sentence-
level quality estimation shared task (Callison-
Burch et al., 2012). Since then, new sub-tasks, lan-
guage pairs and datasets in different domains were
introduced every year (Bojar et al., 2013, 2014,
2015). In contrast to automatic evaluation (the
“metrics task”), QE task aims to develop systems
that provide predictions on the quality of machine
translated text without access to reference transla-
tions (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009).

Sentence-level QE is the most popular track in
the WMT QE shared task, due to its presence in all
editions of the task since the beginning. Many fea-
tures have been explored by participating systems,
including lexical, syntactic, semantic, embedding-
based features (Shah et al., 2015), as well as fea-
tures dependent on any details the particular MT
systems may provide (Soricut et al., 2012; Ca-
margo de Souza et al., 2013). In our model, we
try to exploit the power of bilingual distributed
representations combined with word alignment in-
formation to boost the performance of transla-
tion quality estimation. For this purpose, we use
the implementation provided by the Multivec tool
(Bérard et al., 2016) for the bilingual distributed
representation model, described by Luong et al.
(2015) and the GIZA++ word alignment model
(Och and Ney, 2003).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Sections 2 and 3, we give an overview of the
bilingual distributional model and word alignment
for our purposes. Section 4 gives a detailed de-
scription of our feature set, including the features
derived from manual post-edits of other sentences.
Section 5 describes the datasets and resources we
used to build our model. Section 6 discusses
the experiments conducted and the official results.
The final Section 7 concludes the paper.

2 Bilingual Distributed Representations

Word embeddings have shown a great potential
in tackling various NLP tasks recently, including
multilingual tasks. However, there is a major prob-
lem with using word embeddings in a multilin-
gual setting because models are trained indepen-
dently for each of the languages and the resulting

764



representations can use the vector space very dif-
ferently. Therefore, measuring similarity between
words in different languages will be difficult be-
cause even similar words would likely have very
different representations. Much research work has
been conducted to address this problem. Accord-
ing to Luong et al. (2015), the approaches devel-
oped to learn bilingual models fall into three cate-
gories:

Bilingual Mapping , where word representations
are trained for each language independently
and a linear mapping is then learned to trans-
form representations from one language to
another (Mikolov et al., 2013a).

Monolingual Adaptation relies on pre-trained
embeddings of the source language when
learning target representations. A bilingual
constraint (such as unsupervised word align-
ments derived from a parallel corpus; Zou
et al., 2013) ensures that semantically similar
words across languages end up with embed-
dings similar in the learned vector space.

Bilingual Training aims to jointly learn repre-
sentations for both languages using a paral-
lel corpus. There were attempts to jointly
learn representations without relying on word
alignments (Gouws et al., 2014; Hermann
and Blunsom, 2014; Chandar A P et al.,
2014) but the BiSkip model introduced by
Luong et al. (2015) clearly benefits from
word alignments and outperforms other ap-
proaches in bilingual tasks such as cross-
lingual document classification.

In our submission, we use the BiSkip bilin-
gual model, belonging to the Bilingual Training
category, to measure the similarity between the
source and target sentences using their composi-
tional vector representations, where the term com-
positional indicates that the vector for the sentence
is a simple sum of the vectors of all words.

BiSkip model adapts Mikolov et al. (2013b)
skipgram model for the bilingual case. The joint
representations are learnt using Algorithm 1 to the
following objective:

α(Mono1 +Mono2) + βBi (1)

where Mono1 and Mono2 are the monolingual
representations of each language, Bi is used tie the
two monolingual spaces, and the hyperparameters

α and β are used to balance the influence of the
monolingual components over the bilingual one.

3 Word Alignments

For cross-lingual semantic similarity, a word
alignment model is an important component. Ac-
cording to the evaluation of the semantic textual
similarity task in SemEval 2015, the best perform-
ing systems in both the English and Spanish sub-
tasks relied mainly on word alignment techniques
(Sultan et al., 2015; Hänig et al., 2015). Inspired
by these results, we add features based on word
alignment to the QE system.

According to Specia et al. (2015), alignment-
based features are used for word-level QE only
and there is no alignment-based features included
in the baseline feature set for sentence-level QE.

We use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to obtain
the alignments. By default, GIZA++ alignments
are not symmetric. We symmetrize them by taking
the intersection of the two directions, leading to
high-precision alignments. For pre-processing, we
lowercase and stem words (naively taking just the
first four letters) on both sides of the input.

Some of our features rely on the alignments of
our training data (the ITcorpus and the training
part of the QEcorpus, see Section 5 below) and
some need alignments between the source and the
evaluated translation candidates (the development
and test part of the QEcorpus). We thus use two
sets of alignments:

Run-1 obtained by aligning only the ITcorpus.

Run-2 obtained by aligning the ITcorpus con-
catenated with the QEcorpus.

4 Features

This section describes the different types of fea-
tures we use in our QE system. We extend the
set of baseline features (Section 4.1) with fea-
tures based on bilingual embeddings (Section 4.2),
word alignment (Section 4.3) and also n-grams
seen in a collection of manually post-edited texts
(Section 4.4).

4.1 QuEst++ Baseline Features

A set of 17 system-independent features was de-
veloped by Specia et al. (2013) to set the base-
line system for QE tasks. The features set is ex-
tracted using QuEst++1 (Specia et al., 2015), an
open source implementation of the baseline for
quality estimation for different granularities (sen-
tence, word, and document level QE).

QuEst++ extracts features from either or both
the source and target sides (i.e. the source sentence
and the candidate translation), and also language
model features relying on large monolingual data.

4.2 Bilingual Embedding Features (BE)

In our submission, we use three features derived
from bilingual embeddings:

SentSim simply takes the value of cosine similar-
ity between the source and target sentences in
the bilingual compositional vector space.

WordSim uses the bilingual vector model and
also word-alignment links. We take the aver-
age value of cosine similarity between source
words and their aligned counterparts in the
target sentence. The alignment links between
the source and target are established automat-
ically. Specifically, we use Run-2 alignments
as defined in Section 3.

NounSim is similar to WordSim, but instead of
taking all alignment links, we compute the
average cosine similarity of only the links
where the source (English) word is a noun.
The POS tags were produced by Stanford
POS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).

4.3 Alignment-Based Features

We propose several features based on automatic
word alignments as obtained in Section 3.

1http://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/

4.3.1 Alignment Quality Score

We assume that a good translation aligns well
word-by-word with the source. While this need
not be the case for human translations, it usually
holds for machine-translated text. To assess the
translation quality of a segment, we thus take an
alignment quality score.

In our submission, alignment quality scores are
inspired by components of the conditional proba-
bility P (t1...tl|s1...sm, a1...am), where si denotes
the source words, tj denotes the target words and
ai are the alignment links for each source word to
the target (unambiguous, due to the intersection).
We define the score as:

score =
m∑

i=1

P (tj |siai ) (2)

P (tj |siai ) =
c(si, tj)

c(si)
(3)

The score is a simple sum of lexical translation
probabilities (longer sentences with more aligned
words thus get a higher score) and the lexical
translation probabilities P (t|s) are estimated from
the count c(s, t) how often the source s and target
t words were aligned in our word-aligned corpus.

The formulas resemble IBM Model 1 (Brown
et al., 1993), but the counts used to compute our
probability estimates are based on the whole se-
quence of GIZA++ models and after the heuristic
symmetrization.

Run-1 alignment (see Section 3) is used in this
step to avoid unreliable alignments that could be
produced from aligning the poor machine transla-
tion examples in the QE datasets.

4.3.2 POS Alignment Features

Two more alignment-based features were intro-
duced to estimate translation quality of each
source-target sentence pair with the help of their
POS tags. In our experiments, we restrict the
range of POS tags used to produce our features
to only nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. The
POS tags for both English and German come again
from Stanford POS Tagger.

The two introduced features are:

Number of correctly matched tags represents
the number of source words that are aligned
to target words with the same POS tag.

766



Number of wrongly matched tags represents
the number of source words that are aligned
to target words with a different POS tag.

Since the alignments are needed for the source
and candidate translation, they come from Run-2.

4.4 Post-Edited N -grams

As mentioned earlier, in quality estimation, there
is no access to reference translation. However, the
QE task organizers provided the participants with
training data (called “QEcorpus” in Section 5)
consisting of 12k training segments and 1k de-
velopment segments machine-translated and man-
ually post-edited. To benefit from this valuable re-
source, we introduce another set of features rep-
resenting the most frequent bigrams in translation
text that were changed through the post-editing.

The list of bigrams was extracted on the basis
of GIZA++ alignment, preprocessing tokens and
symmetrizing the two directions the same way as
in Section 3. We extract all word-aligned bigrams
occurring more than 10 times in the training and
development 13k sentences, greatly reducing the
number of bigrams to a few dozens of most gen-
eral ones. Each of the bigrams serves as an inde-
pendent boolean feature in the model.

Although lowercasing seems to be more helpful
during the alignment, we avoid it during the actual
bigram extraction since case changes are mostly
rightful and important post-edits when translating
into German. On the other hand, the order in
which the words and their alignments are occurred
in the text is checked to be reserved (e.g. bigrams
with the second target word positioned before the
first target word are excluded).

Table 1 summarizes the number of extracted bi-
grams. Lowercased n-grams would be more gen-
eral so more would survive the thresholding, but
we opt to use the cased n-grams.

Table 1: Extracted Bigrams Numbers

Having that the 1k development segments are
used to extract the N-grams features, we report
the performance of the N-grams features on the 2k
testing segments only.

5 Data

Our experiments use the following corpora:

QEcorpus (our name) denotes the English-
German corpus released by the WMT16 QE
task organizers. It is the first time when
this language pair appears in the segment-
level QE. QEcorpus consist of 15k source
sentences in the IT domain, divided into 12k
training, 1k development and 2k testing seg-
ments. Source sentences are provided with
their machine translations, post-editions and
HTER (Snover et al., 2006) as post-editing
effort scores.

ITcorpus denotes the parallel English-German
domain-specific resources made available for
the WMT IT-Domain Translation Task2. IT-
corpus consist of 452546 parallel sentences
assembled from different resources, see Ta-
ble 2.

ComparableNews is a pair of monolingual cor-
pora, namely the English and German ver-
sions of the News Crawl monolingual cor-
pus (only the year 2015) compiled from var-
ious online news publications for the WMT
News Translation Task3. The corpus con-
sists of 3.2 GB of English text with 27.2 mil-
lion sentences and 5.5 GB of German text
with 51.3 million sentences. The vocabulary
size for this corpus is 1,774,792 English and
5,817,655 German words (excluding num-
bers and punctuation).

As pre-processing, the corpus used in each
setup is first cleaned from hyperlinks and then to-
kenized using Moses tokenizer4.

6 Experiments

In our submission, we use the Python wrapper
for BiSkip provided in the MultiVec tool5 (Bérard
et al., 2016). To train the model, we use the IT-
corpus with the default configuration of the tool.
The model was trained using a learning rate α set
to 0.05 and sample (a threshold on words’ fre-
quency) set to 0.001.

As a prediction model, we use the Linear Re-
gression model to predict the post-editing effort
need for each translation. In our experiments, we
tried different combinations of the introduced fea-
tures. Best results are obtained by training the
model using all the features.

Tables 3 and 4 list the results of examined fea-
ture combinations on the development and test
parts of QEcorpus, respectively. (The golden
truth of the test part was made available only af-
ter the outputs submission deadline.) The mod-
els are evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Er-
ror (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
and Pearson’s correlation (Pearson’s r) for post-
editing effort prediction, and Spearman’s rank cor-
relation coefficient (Spearman’s ρ) for the ranking
task.

Results show that adding the alignment qual-
ity score to the set of baseline features gives the

5https://github.com/eske/multivec

best performance compared to the other intro-
duced features on the test set.

When added alone, features based on POS tags
or bilingual embeddings do not help and some-
times even slightly degrade the performance, but
apparently, they are useful in the combination.

Our submission to the task corresponds to the
line “All Features” in Table 4.

Additionally, we experimented with replacing
the parallel ITcorpus with only the compara-
ble (but larger) ComparableNews when extract-
ing bilingual embeddings. As documented in Ta-
ble 5, the size of the monolingual data is appar-
ently more important for the quality of the align-
ments. MultiVec, given two corpora, extracts the
word alignments automatically, and obviously, it
is going to fail most of the time when given a
non-parallel corpus. Nevertheless, the few ran-
dom alignments are probably sufficient to blend
the source and target subspaces of the vector rep-
resentation of words, because the setup with all
BE features trained on ComparableNews instead
of ITcorpus works better.

6.1 Official Results

The official results of the WMT16 Sentence-Level
QE task use Pearson’s correlation as the primary
evaluation metric for Scoring sub-task and Spear-
man’s rank correlation as the primary evaluation
metric for Ranking sub-task.

According to the official evaluation, our model
is ranked 7th (out of 14) and 6th (out of 11) in
the scoring and ranking sub-tasks respectively. As
illustrated in Tables 6 and 7, our model outper-
forms the baseline system as well as the Ref-
erential Translation Machine model (RTM), the
best performing system in WMT15 (Bicici et al.,
2015), in both scoring and ranking sub-tasks on
WMT16 IT-domain datasets.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we described our submission to
the WMT16 Quality Estimation Shared Task for
English-German sentence-level post editing effort
prediction and ranking. We introduced a new
set of system independent features using bilingual
distributed representations, word alignments and
also frequent n-grams appearing in manually post-
edited texts. Combined with baseline features, our
features show an improvement in the performance
of post-editing effort prediction in QE task.

An interesting observation is that the bilingual
embeddings perform better when trained on a
larger but only comparable corpus than on an in-
domain parallel corpus. The bilingual embeddings
are not trained specifically for the QE prediction
and their contribution is thus arguably limited.

In the future, we plan to investigate more vari-
ants to the core learning model as well as training
the embeddings for the specific task.
