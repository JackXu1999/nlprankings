1 Abstract

Across its many forms, user-generated content
(UGC) acts as a sample of all human discourse.
It has been harder to process this type of text with
traditional tools. People have even looked at nor-
malising this text to look like the data that tradi-
tional tools are used to. This talk examines the
kind of variation we see in user-generated content,
and contrary to the trend of normalisation, not only
presents methods for coping with the noise with-
out changing it, but also goes on to explain the
many kinds of latent information expressed by the
stable, consistent linguistic variation seen across
society and the internet.
