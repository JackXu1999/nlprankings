ABSTRACT
Figurative language poses a serious challenge to NLP systems. The use of idiomatic and
metaphoric expressions is not only extremely widespread in natural language; many figurative
expressions, in particular idioms, also behave idiosyncratically. These idiosyncrasies are not
restricted to a non-compositional meaning but often also extend to syntactic properties, selec-
tional preferences etc. To deal appropriately with such expressions, NLP tools need to detect
figurative language and assign the correct analyses to non-literal expressions. While there has
been quite a bit of work on determining the general ‘idiomaticity’ of an expression (type-based
approaches), this only solves part of the problem as many expressions, such as break the ice or
play with fire, can also have a literal, perfectly compositional meaning (e.g. break the ice on the
duck pond). Such expressions have to be disambiguated in context (token-based approaches).
Token-based approaches have received increased attention recently. In this talk, I will present
an unsupervised method for token-based idiom detection. The method exploits the fact that
well-formed texts exhibit lexical cohesion, i.e. words are semantically related to other words
in the context. I will show how cohesion can be modelled and how the cohesive structure can
be used to distinguish literal and idiomatic usages and even detect newly coined figurative
expressions.
