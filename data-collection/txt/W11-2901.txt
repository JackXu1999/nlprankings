Abstract

Ambiguities arising from alternations of scope in interpretations for multiply quantified sen-
tences appear to require grammatical operations that compromise the strong assumptions of
syntactic/semantic transparency and monotonicity underlying the Frege-Montague approach
to the theory of grammar. Examples that have been proposed include covert movement at the
level of logical form, abstraction or storage mechanisms, and proliferating type-changing op-
erations. The paper examines some interactions of scope alternation with syntactic phenomena
including coordination, binding, and relativization. Starting from the assumption of Fodor and
Sag, and others, that many expressions that have been treated as generalized quantifiers are
in fact referential expressions, and using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) as a gram-
matical framework, the paper presents an account of quantifier scope ambiguities according to
which the available readings are projected directly from the lexicon by the combinatorics of
the syntactic derivation, without any independent manipulation of logical form and without re-
course to otherwise unmotivated type-changing operations. As a direct result, scope ambiguity
can be efficiently processed using packed representations from which the available readings
can be simply enumerated.
