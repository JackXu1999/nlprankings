Abstract

To compile a modern dictionary that cata-
logues the words in currency, and to study
linguistic patterns in the contemporary lan-
guage, it is necessary to have a corpus of au-
thentic texts that reflect current usage of the
language. Although there are numerous Ara-
bic corpora, none claims to be representative
of the language in terms of the combination
of geographical region, genre, subject matter,
mode, and medium. This paper describes a
100-million-word corpus that takes the British
National Corpus (BNC) as a model. The aim
of the corpus is to be balanced, annotated,
comprehensive, and representative of contem-
porary Arabic as written and spoken in Arab
countries today. It will be different from most
others in not being heavily-dominated by the
news or in mixing the classical with the mod-
ern. In this paper is an outline of the methodol-
ogy adopted for the design, construction, and
annotation of this corpus. DIWAN (Al-Shargi
and Rambow, 2015) was used to annotate a
one-million-word snapshot of the corpus. DI-
WAN is a dialectal word annotation tool, but
we upgraded it by adding a new tag-set that is
based on traditional Arabic grammar and by
adding the roots and morphological patterns
of nouns and verbs. Moreover, the corpus we
constructed covers the major spoken varieties
of Arabic.

1 Introduction

A collection of texts in machine-readable format
is called a corpus. The creation of a corpus is
often motivated by interest in linguistic phenom-
ena. Therefore, the design and creation of a corpus
is always linked to purpose of usage. Thousands
of corpora have been created and many are freely
available. These corpora vary in size, type, format,
usage, and purpose of creation. They are usually
annotated with morphological, syntactic, seman-
tic, discoursal, or prosodic information. Individ-
ual texts in a corpus often have meta-data in the

header that give information about such attributes
as genre of the text, author, source, date and coun-
try of publication, etc. (Baker et al., 2006).

Building a balanced and representative corpus
remains an ideal goal for corpus creators. A bal-
anced corpus includes a wide range of texts from
the different genres and domains that the corpus
claims to depict. Sometimes, this type of corpus
is referred to as a reference, general, or core cor-
pus. Similarly, a corpus is claimed to be represen-
tative if it contains the major linguistic variation
in the concerned language. Although it is not an
easy task to achieve balanceness and representive-
ness in a corpus, it can be done with a level of ap-
proximation and scalability (McEnery and Hardie,
2012; Baker et al., 2006).

The web provides a massive collection of texts
which is growing rapidly. Constructing corpora
by harvesting web pages is usually referred to as
web-crawling. The web is an excellent informa-
tion source with large amounts of data which one
can select, organize, and compile into corpora of
all types (McEnery and Hardie, 2012). Since the
late 1980s, Arabic corpora have been constructed.
However, not many of them are freely available as
open-source. Most are for written Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA). Morphosyntactically anno-
tated Arabic corpora are very rare and not freely
available to researchers.

This paper reports on the construction and anno-
tation of a comprehensive 100-million-word cor-
pus of contemporary Arabic. The purpose is to
provide an open-source corpus of contemporary
Arabic which is balanced, representative of the
language, and comparable to the internationally
recognized British National Corpus. The text of
the corpus was selected from a wide range of
genres, domains, and types. It consists of 83%
written language and 17% spoken language. The
texts of the corpus were collected primarily from
text materials available online but also from the



149

transcripts of purpose-made recordings (see Sec-
tion 3). The corpus was automatically annotated
both morphologically and syntactically. A sam-
ple of one million words was manually and semi-
manually verified; it was additionally annotated
for sentiment and glossed in English. To accom-
plish this annotation, we used DIWAN (Al-Shargi
and Rambow, 2015) but had to specifically de-
velop for it morphological and syntactic annota-
tion schemes on the basis of the long-established
Arabic linguistic tradition (see Section 5). We also
added new features to the DIWAN annotation tool
to facilitate our semi-manual annotation process
(see Section 6).

2 Literature Review

Arabic corpora vary in size, type, purpose, de-
sign, text type, etc. (Al-Sulaiti and Atwell, 2006).
Zaghouani, 2017 surveyed freely available Arabic
corpora and classified 66 of them into six main
categories, namely (i) raw text corpora, (ii) anno-
tated corpora, (iii) lexicons, (iv) speech corpora,
(v) handwriting recognition corpora and (vi) mis-
cellaneous corpora.

The Corpus of Contemporary Arabic (Al-Sulaiti
and Atwell, 2006) was the first freely available
Arabic corpus. Around one million words were
collected from newspapers and magazines. Since
then, most monolingual Arabic corpora have been
constructed by collecting texts from news sources
(i.e. newspaper articles). Examples of such
corpora are: the Open Source Arabic Corpora
(OSAC) which contain around 18 million words
of written MSA and Classical Arabic (CA) texts
(Saad and Ashour, 2010); Akhbar Al Khaleej 2004
Corpus consists of 3 million words of newspa-
per texts (Abbas and Smaı̈li, 2005); Al-Watan
2004 Corpus contains 10 million words of news-
paper texts as well (Abbas et al., 2011); KACST
Arabic Corpus includes more than 700 million
words collected from 10 text source types such as
newspapers, magazines, books, old manuscripts,
university theses, refereed periodicals, websites,
curricula, news agencies, and official prints (Al-
Thubaity, 2015). There is also the International
Corpus of Arabic (ICA) which was constructed
by Bibliotheca Alexandrina and it contains 100
million words that were collected from the press,
net articles, books, and academic text sources
(Alansary and Nagi, 2014). The ArabiCorpus at
Brigham Young University is one of the most pop-

ular web-based corpora. It consists of around 174
million words, 77% of which is from newspa-
pers. It does, however, include around 9 million
words of premodern literature, 1 million words of
modern literature, 28 million words of non-fiction,
and a token of colloquial Egyptian (0.164 million
words).

The King Saud University Corpus of Classical
Arabic (KSUCCA) consists of around 50 million
words (Alrabia et al., 2014). The corpus includes
texts of six genres, namely religion, linguistics, lit-
erature, science, sociology, and biography. The
arTenTen corpus used web crawlers to automati-
cally harvest 5.8 billion words from Arabic web-
sites (Belinkov et al., 2013). Its purpose was lin-
guistic and lexicographic in nature. It was auto-
matically annotated using MADAMIRA and it is
available on Sketch Engine.

The Historical Arabic Corpus (HAC) has 45
million words that were organized into primary
and secondary resources, seven genres, and 100-
year eras in the Gregorian calendar. Its intended
purpose is historical semantics and etymological
lexicography (Ismail et al., 2014).

Two specialized Arabic corpora use the Quran
as a source of their textual content; hence, each
consists of the same number of words in the
Quran, 77430 words. The Quranic Arabic Cor-
pus is morphologically and syntactically anno-
tated. Its annotation was done automatically and
verified collaboratively by the wider community
(Dukes et al., 2013). The second corpus is the
Boundary Annotated Quran Corpus. It is anno-
tated with prosodic information and phrase bound-
aries (Brierley et al., 2012; Sawalha et al., 2012).
It took advantage of boundary markups that flag
starts and stops in the Quran (Sawalha et al., 2014;
Brierley et al., 2016). Interest in dialectal Arabic
corpora has recently surged. An example of such
corpora is the Curras Palestinian Arabic corpus, a
corpus of more than 56K tokens, which are anno-
tated with morphological and lexical features (Jar-
rar et al., 2017). There are Arabic corpora that are
only available for a fee, such as the Linguistic Data
Consortium’s1 The Penn Arabic Treebank2 and the
European Language Resources Association’s3 An-
Nahar Newspaper Text Corpus4.

This brief review, which is based on a more ex-
tensive survey of the literature, points to the ab-
sence of resources that make the claim that they
represent in a comprehensive manner the Arabic
of today as written and spoken by contemporary
native speakers. There is a great need for a cor-
pus of modern Arabic as used by present-day na-
tive speakers of the language. The corpus must be
truly representative of the language that the cur-
rent inhabitants of the Arab World use, regardless
of whether it is of the high or low variety. It must
also be balanced in its representation of the written
and spoken language, and of the various discourse
genres. It must truly depict the language of the
curricula and academia.

3 Methodology

To ensure that this corpus of modern Arabic is
representative, balanced, comprehensive, and for
general purposes, we followed the model of the
British National Corpus (BNC)5. That is why this
corpus contains slightly more than 100-million
words of the same text types, domains, and gen-
res. The corpus contains 87% of texts from writ-
ten sources and 13% of transcribed spoken lan-
guage. The written part includes texts from Ap-
plied Sciences, Arts, Belief and Thought, Com-
merce and Finance, Imaginative works, Leisure,
Natural and Pure Sciences, Social Sciences, and
World Affairs. The spoken subcorpus includes
transcripts of Spontaneous Conversations (4.2%)
and Context-Governed Spoken Language (6.2%)
from the categories of Educational/Informative,
Business, Public/Institutional, and Leisure. Tables
1 and 2 show the text categories of the corpus of
the written and spoken subcorpora respectively.

Twenty million words of the category of World
Affairs were selected from newspapers published
in 20 Arab countries where around one mil-
lion words were collected for each country from
one or two newspapers published in that coun-
try. The different genres of newspaper articles in-
clude Politics; Arts and Culture; Economics; Lo-
cal News; Opinions; Regional and International
News; Sports; and Others (e.g., Weather Fore-
casts, News about Technology, Health, Tourism,
etc.). The subcategory of Social Sciences includes
around 14 million words of texts from books and
online sources. It contains texts of the genres:
Languages and Linguistics; Modern Arabic Dic-

5http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/

tionaries; Philosophy; Islamic Studies and Quran
Interpretation; History; Geography; Anthropology
and Sociology; Law; Education; Food and Nutri-
tion; Travel; Lectures; Sports; etc. The subcate-
gory of Belief and Thought consists of about three
million words of texts of sacred books such as: the
Quran; Quran Interpretation; the Hadith including
Hadith Qudsi; the Old Testament; the New Testa-
ment; Dictionary of the Bible; and Interpretations
of the Testaments, etc.

More than seven million words were collected
from online sources to fill the subcategory of Com-
merce and Finance. These articles belong to a va-
riety of topics within the commerce and finance
genre. They include Accounting; Taxes; Invest-
ment; Finance; Financial Legal Issues; Inventory;
Currency, etc. The subcategory of Imaginative
Language consists of 16 million words. The texts
were collected from written sources that include;
stories; novels; poetry; plays; translations of in-
ternational stories and novels. The subcategory
of Leisure consists of 12 million words which in-
clude articles on topics such as Animals; Cars;
Technology; Health; Women; Tourism; Cooking
Recipes; How to; Arabian Cities; Jordanian Sto-
ries and Traditions; and Fitness. The subcategory
of Arts was collected from web sources and com-
prises around seven million words. The texts of
this category contain articles on Arts; Digital Pho-
tography; Film and Video Production; Printing;
Area Planning and Landscaping; Sculpture; Ce-
ramics and Metals; Computer Graphic Arts; Enter-
tainment and Performance; Cinema and Theater;
Photography; Music; Architecture; Fine Arts;
Decorative Arts; International Arts; Arabic Callig-
raphy, etc. Around seven million words were col-
lected from books and web resources for the cate-
gory of Applied Sciences. The topics included in
this category are Medicine; Engineering; Informa-
tion Technology; Energy, etc. Finally, the Natural
and Pure Sciences subcorpus consists of around
four million words that come from Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.

The corpus is designed to have detailed meta-
data about each article. This is valuable knowl-
edge that can be used to guide the search within
the corpus. It can also be used in text classification
and text data mining. Moreover, the corpus and its
metadata constitute an excellent dataset for train-
ing machine learning algorithms on such tasks as
genre identification. The metadata include infor-

Table 1: Text categories of the written subcorpus

mation such as article ID, category, subcategory,
country, author, date, source, and URL. Moreover,
the title and the text of each article are stored in a
traditional relational database and in XML format.
Figure 1 shows a sample article in XML with the
text, title and metadata clearly specified.

A corpus-representative snapshot of one million
words are designated as the corpus gold standard.
This is a sample of words semi-manually anno-
tated and verified. Each word is morphologically
decomposed into its prefixes, stem, suffixes, pro-
clitics, and enclitics. Then, each morpheme is an-
notated with a morphological tag or possibly tags.
The stem is labeled by one morphological tag, and
its root and morphological pattern are specified.
Other morphological attributes, such as the num-
ber and gender of a noun, are indicated as well.
The tag set we used here was informed by tradi-
tional Arabic grammar (see Section 6). Moreover,
each word was annotated for sentiment designa-
tion (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral sentiment).
The annotation process was done using a special-
ized program, DIWAN (Al-Shargi and Rambow,
2015). Twenty annotators with expertise in Arabic
linguistics were trained on the tag set and on the
annotation tool and they were supervised by three
linguists who ensured the accuracy of annotation
and verification.

Language subcorpus.

4 Copyrights

The texts of the written subcorpus were primar-
ily selected from sources available online. To get
around copyrights, we followed Eckart’s exam-
ple by ’scrambling’ the texts such that the origi-
nal structure of a document would be destroyed.
“This inhibits the reconstruction of the original
documents. With respect to German copyright leg-
islation this approach is considered safe” (Eckart
et al., 2014). We assume this is satisfactory to
copyright laws in most countries around the world.

5 Annotation

To create and annotate the comprehensive corpus
of contemporary Arabic, we followed the princi-
ples presented in (AlShargi et al., 2016). This ap-
proach consists of several main steps. We started
out by deciding on the categories, subcategories,
and sizes in millions of words of the components
of the corpus. To ensure balance, we simply fol-
lowed the BNC proportions. Then we collected
the target textual material from sources similar to
those of the BNC, as well. We added texts from
the social media, forums, and websites according
to the various topical categories (cf. Tables 1, 2.
Then, we modified the DIWAN annotation tool
(Al-Shargi and Rambow, 2015) by adding new an-
notation tags such as root, pattern, and sentiment,
by creating an elaborate CODA, and by develop-
ing a user interface that reflects these modifica-
tions. (See Tables 4, 5, 6 where the new tags we
added appear in bold). After the primary annota-
tion of the entire corpus was run automatically, we
conducted an error detection round to find and cor-
rect annotation errors. (Figure 2 shows the work-
flow).

DIWAN assists human annotators in tagging
each token with the relevant morphological, syn-
tactic, and semantic information. DIWAN has the
following annotation fields: 1) Diac: where the
word to be annotated is shown with diacritics. 2)
Lex: Here the lemma in its citation form appears.
For example, the lemma of AîE. AJ.k@ð wAHbAbhA



152

‘and her lovers’ will have the lex I. �
J.k Hbyb
‘lover’ 3) BWhash: In this field, the Buckwalter
rendition of the lemma is split into prefix, stem,
and suffix. The stem is marked by the symbol # on
both sides, 4) Gloss: the English translation of the
lemma appears in this field.

There are features in DIWAN that indicate the
proclitics and enclitics of words. The clitics are
assigned slots: prc3, prc2, prc1, and prc0 for pro-
clitics, and enc0; enc1, and enc2 for enclitics. A
lower index indicates closer proximity to the stem.
Additionally, there are features that mark the part
of speech (POS), functional number and gender
of nouns, and aspect of verbs. Functional number
and gender refer to the function of a word, rather
than its form. For example �èXA�¯ qAdp ‘leaders’ is
functionally masculine and plural, even though it
ends in �è , which is the marker of feminine singu-
lar nouns.

We added three new features to DIWAN, (i)
root which is a base form, for example ÖÏ lms
to touch is the root of these two words Aî 	EñÒÊJ

sylmswnhA they will touch it and ÒÊK
 ylms ‘he
touches’, (ii) sentiment which shows the attitude
towards a word as to whether it is negative, posi-
tive, or neutral; for example, the sentiment anno-
tation of the word ’sabba’ in ðYªË@ I.  sb AlEdw
‘he cursed the enemy’ is negative while that of
the word ’ahabba’ in �è


@QÖÏ @ I. k


@ >Hb Almr>p

‘he loved the woman’ is positive and that of 	àAÔ«
EmAn ‘Amman’ is neutral. And (iii) pattern the
morphological mold that the root is formed by;
e.g., the word Qå� A¿ kAsir breaker is derived by

the mold É«� A
	
¯ fAEil doer and the root �Qå�

�
» kasara

he broke . To show the details of the annotation,
we present table 3.

Figure 2: Steps to Creating a Comprehensive Corpus
for Contemporary Arabic

6 Morphology

Morphological annotation of the whole corpus
was automatically performed using MADAMIRA

(Pasha et al., 2014). We isolated a one-million
word snapshot of the corpus for manual verifica-
tion. Twenty-five B.A. students of Arabic at the
University of Jordan carried out the manual ver-
ification and two professors of linguistics super-
vised their work and vetted their annotation. The
annotators used DIWAN (Al-Shargi and Rambow,
2015) to review and verify MADAMIRA’s anal-
ysis. The morphological annotation required (1)
Development of a new tag-set with detailed mor-
phological description. Fourteen new noun-tags
were added to Madamira. These new tags fall into
three groups: i) derived nouns: Active participle,
Passive participle, Exaggeration, Qualificative ad-
jective, Noun of time/place, Noun of Instrument,
and Elative noun; ii) underived nouns: Concrete
noun and Abstract noun; and iii) gerunds: Origi-
nal gerund, Gerund with initial miim, Gerund of
instance, Gerund of state, and Gerund of profes-
sion. (2) Providing the roots of the nouns and
verbs, since such a root conveys the core lexi-
cal meaning of a word. It normally consists of
three consonants, and less frequently of two or
four consonants. The majority of Arabic words
(nouns and verbs) are derived from triliteral roots,
uncommonly from biliteral or quadriliteral roots.
For instance, the consonantal root  . P . X d.r.s
has the basic lexical meaning of studying, from
which these words are derived: � �P �X darosN ‘les-
son’,  ��P

�
Y

�
Ó mudar∼is ‘teacher ’, �é �@ �PX� diraAsap

‘sutdying’, �é � �P
�
Y

�
Ó madorasap ‘school’, P

�
@
�
X

daAris ‘student’. In all these derived words, the
consonants d-r-s constitute their root (McCarthy,
John, 1981; Prunet et al., 2000; Davis and Zaway-
deh, 2001). (3) Providing the morphological pat-
tern of each noun and verb. This pattern consti-
tutes a canonical template that consists of a se-
ries of discontinuous consonants including those
of the root, a series of discontinuous vowels, and
a templatic pattern. It carries a schematic meaning
and grammatical information together including
the word’s part of speech. For instance, the mor-
phological pattern C1VVC2VC3 together with the
vowel melody - a - i - represents the active partici-
ple of Form I verbs (Bat-El, 1994, 2001; Ratcliffe,
Robert , 1998; Ussishkin, Adam, 1999, 2005).

Languages often have a low variety that is used in
everyday communication and a high variety that
is used in formal settings. The spoken language

ucation and formal written communication from
the Arab renaissance in the nineteenth century on-
ward; and the dialects, the colloquial regional vari-
eties that are spoken in everyday communication.
Since the corpus constructed here is comprehen-
sive and since it claims to be representative of con-
temporary Arabic, it has to exclude Classical Ara-
bic, but include Modern Standard Arabic, and the
regional dialects. We define Contemporary Arabic
as the language both written and spoken by living
native speakers of Arabic; therefore, the dialects
need to be represented. We are not alone in this
view, check out A Frequency Dictionary of Arabic
(Buckwalter and Parkinson, 2011) and the Oxford
Arabic Dictionary (Arts et al., 2014).

The major spoken varieties are, therefore, repre-
sented in the corpus: North Africa is represented
by the Moroccan dialect; the Nile region by Egyp-
tian; the Arabian Peninsula by Taizi, Sanaani, and
Najdi; Greater Syria by Shami, Jordanian, and
Palestinian. The data in the form of contextual-
ized sentences were collected from (1) personal
communication in Facebook and Whatsapp fam-
ily groups; (2) jokes, songs, videoclips, movie
scripts, and TV interviews in the local dialects;
and (3) personal interviews of old speakers, es-
pecially those with minimal education. The data
were collected by students who came from these
regions. Like any other language, Arabic has dif-
ferences between the dialects and the standard va-
riety, between the spoken and written varieties.
There is variation in the pronunciation of some
consonants and vowels (e.g., q, D, Z, v, *, A);
suppression of word final inflections; fixed word-
order (i.e., subject-verb-object (SVO)); contracted
forms (e.g., �Ê 	¢Ó maZal∼i$ for �Zú

Arabic has a free word order because of gram-
matical inflections. When all words’ grammatical
functions are marked with appropriate inflections,
it is not necessary to restrict the arrangement of
words in a sentence; hence, Classical Arabic ex-
hibits a totally free word order. Modern Standard
Arabic shows preference for verb-subject-object
even though inflections are amongst its distinctive
features. The spoken varieties continue a histor-
ical tradition that we suspect had started as early
as Islamic times, where case inflection had lost
grounds to fixed word order. Preference in Clas-
sical Arabic for the default word order (i.e., verb-
subject-object) in an otherwise free word order
system was a portent of developments to come.
As Islamic conquest brought Arabs in contact with
foreigners who soon adopted the language, and
as the diglossic gap widened, grammatical inflec-
tion lost favor in the low variety while it retained
its glamour in the high variety, under the influ-
ence of the Quran. The spoken, the low, variety
started to favor the subject-verb-object word order
as a result of the loss of case inflections and to
set apart the agent from the patient of the predi-
cate. The written variety manifested in MSA, on
the other hand, used the verb-subject-object order
as the unmarked default and retained other combi-
nations for special purposes. All modern regional
varieties are descendants of old spoken varieties
of Arabic in much the same way as Modern Stan-
dard Arabic is a successor of Classical Arabic, the
written variety. Regional varieties of Arabic share

great many syntactic features. For example, they
have two negation patterns: single negation and
discontinuous negation (Alqassas, 2015). The first
uses the negative particle AÓ mA followed by the
verb phrase, whilst the second adds the negative
marking suffix � � $ to the verb in addition to the
negative particle that precedes it. Thus, I didnt
say may be expressed as ����Ê

�
¯AÓ mA qult-i$ or

�
IÊ

��
¯AÓ mA qult. To negate the future, however,

there are three options: (1) the negative particle
followed by the imperfect verb as in Q 	¯A


@ AÓ mA

>asAfir ‘I will not travel’; (2) or followed by the
imperfect inflicted with the negative marking suf-
fix as in �Q 	�̄ A


@ AÓ mA >asAfr-i$ ; (3) or followed

by the future particle h �P raH and the imperfect

verb as in Q 	¯A

@ hP AÓ mA raH >asAfir. JCCA

consists in part of a spoken language component
that is annotated morphologically and syntacti-
cally, glossed with MSA forms, and translated into
English. This is especially useful with contrac-
tions, the hallmarks of spoken Arabic. The gloss
is often the non-contracted equivalent in MSA as
demonstrated in Table 7.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper outlined the methodology for the de-
sign, construction, and annotation of the Jor-
dan Comprehensive Contemporary Arabic Cor-
pus (JCCA). The corpus is balanced, comprehen-
sive, and representative of contemporary Arabic as
written and spoken in Arab countries today. It con-
sists of 100 million words that reflect current us-
age of the language. The corpus consists of 87%
written and 13% spoken language. The text of the
corpus was selected such that it would be repre-
sentative of a wide range of geographical regions,
genres, subject matters, modes, and media. DI-

table, the abbreviation Contracted represents examples
of spoken words (i.e. contractions), BW is Buckwalter
transliteration, Full Form is the non-contracted equiva-
lent in MSA, gloss the English meaning.

WAN was upgraded and used to annotate and man-
ually verify the annotation of a one-million-word
snapshot of the corpus, making it a gold standard
of superior quality that can serve as a resource
against which automatic annotation may be com-
pared. JCCA construction made these additional
contributions: (i) Development of a new and elab-
orate tag-set that is based on the morphology of
traditional Arabic grammar; (ii) Addition of the
roots and morphological patterns of nouns and
verbs; (iii) Coverage of the major spoken varieties
of Arabic: North Africa; the Nile; the Arabian
Peninsula; and Levant. Future work is to make
this corpus a monitor corpus where new texts are
added proportionally every year. This will facili-
tate tracking language change and will render the
corpus more amiable to lexicography.
