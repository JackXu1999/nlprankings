Abstract 

 

This paper focuses on the novel task of auto-
matic extraction of phrases related to causes of 
emotions. The analysis of emotional causes in 
sentences, where emotions are explicitly indi-
cated through emotion keywords can provide 
the foundation for research on challenging task 
of recognition of implicit affect from text. We 
developed a corpus of emotion causes specific 
for 22 emotions. Based on the analysis of this 
corpus we introduce a method for the detec-
tion of the linguistic relations between an 
emotion and its cause and the extraction of the 
phrases describing the emotion causes. The 
method employs syntactic and dependency 
parser and rules for the analysis of eight types 
of the emotion-cause linguistic relations. The 
results of evaluation showed that our method 
performed with high level of accuracy (82%). 

1 Introduction and Background 
Emotional reactions to three salient aspects of 
the world, namely (1) events and their conse-
quences, (2) agents and their actions, and (3) ob-
jects, are based on the nature of cognitive origins 
and can be triggered under specific conditions 
(Ortony et al., 1988). The cognitive model of 
emotions (OCC model of emotions) arranges 22 
emotions in three substantially independent 
classes according to the aspects of the world that 
are in focus of evaluation.  

Recently, the task of automatic recognition of 
distinct emotions conveyed in text has been gain-
ing increased attention of researchers in the areas 
of natural language processing and computation-
al linguistics (Alm, 2008; Aman and Szpakowicz, 
2008; Boucouvalas, 2003; Chaumartin, 2007; 
Katz et al., 2007; Kozareva et al., 2007; Liu et al., 
2003; Neviarouskaya et al., 2011; Purver and 

Battersby, 2012; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 
2008; Suttles and Ide, 2013). To understand 
emotions expressed in written language, it is im-
portant to analyse the causes of emotions ("what 
caused a particular emotion") and eliciting con-
ditions ("under what conditions"). The challenge 
of emotion cause detection in text has been re-
cently tackled by Chen et al. (2010), who devel-
oped two sets of linguistic pattern-based features 
(manually generalized patterns and automatically 
generalized patterns) for extraction of causes for 
emotions in Chinese. The linguistic-pattern-
based methodology described in (Chen et al., 
2010) inspired the development of a method for 
the identification of Italian sentences that contain 
emotion cause phrases and the retrieval of emo-
tion – emotion cause phrase couples (Russo et al., 
2011). In their subsequent work, Caselli et al. 
(2012) semi-automatically assigned polarity val-
ues to Italian nouns that potentially represent 
nominal cause events associated with emotions. 

In this work, we introduce a novel method for 
automatic extraction of emotion causes. The 
main contributions of our work are as follows: 
(1) development of a corpus of emotion causes 
and (2) deep analysis of cause events specific for 
22 emotions from the OCC model. The analyses 
of emotional causes in sentences, where emo-
tions are explicitly indicated through emotion 
keywords, and conditions that lead to emotional 
experience can provide the foundation for re-
search on challenging task of recognition of im-
plicit affect from text. 

2 Development and Analysis of the 
Corpus of Emotion Causes  

2.1 Creation of the Dataset of Sentences 
with Explicitly Indicated Emotions 

In the text of (Ortony et al., 1988), about 130 to-
kens (emotion words) have been distributed be-
tween 22 emotion types. For example, 'glad' and 

932



'happy' correspond to Joy emotion class; 'scared' 
and 'terrified' are associated with Fear emotion; 
and 'awe' and 'esteem' describe Admiration emo-
tion. We consider these tokens as seed terms for 
extraction of sentences that contain information 
on what caused the particular emotion.  

In addition to 22 sentences provided in (Ortony 
et al., 1988) as examples for each emotion type, 
we manually collected 510 sentences with emo-
tion tokens and explicitly mentioned emotion 
causes from online ABBYY Lingvo dictionary 
(http://www.lingvo-online.ru/en). 118 emotion 
tokens were found productive, resulting in at least 
one cause-containing sentence per emotion token. 

The corpus consisting of 532 sentences was 
manually annotated. The annotation task in-
cluded the following subtasks: (1) to define an 
agent or an experiencer of emotion specified by 
emotion token; (2) to delimit the phrase describ-
ing the cause of emotion; (3) to define the lin-
guistic relation between emotion and its cause; 
(4) to classify the cause event as positive, nega-
tive, or neutral; and (5) to extract tokens that in-
fluence the polarity of the phrase. 

2.2 Corpus Analysis 
We performed the detailed analysis of the created 
corpus. The agent or experiencer of emotion spe-
cified by emotion token was defined in 495 sen-
tences (93% from the whole corpus). In the cor-
pus, about 46% of sentences are related to posi-
tive emotions, and about 54% of sentences ex-
press negative emotions.  

The analysis of polarity of cause events from 
the annotated corpus showed the following distri-
bution of the causes according to the sentiment 
categories: (1) positive – about 27%; (2) negative 
– about 29%; and (3) neutral – about 44% of the 
cause events. These figures emphasize the fact 
that the cause of emotion expressed in text is not 
necessarily described by sentiment words. Inter-
esting observation is that cause events are nega-
tive in 2.9% of sentences with positive emotions, 
and positive cause events occur in 4.5% of sen-
tences with negative emotions (for example, 'And 
people changed from diet to diet and felt guilty 
[negative emotion] because they continued to like 
the things they weren't supposed to'). 

The important feature that was identified in 
each sentence was the linguistic relation between 
emotion and its cause. Based on the analysis of 
the annotated data, we distinguish eight types of 
such linguistic relations:  

1. One-word preposition (OWP). For ex-
ample, 'at' in the sentence 'And while she gaped 

with disappointment at his lukewarmness, he got 
himself away, at ten'. 

2. Complex preposition (CP). For example, 
'because of' in the sentence 'He was himself a 
Greek, and there were many who felt offended 
because of his height'. 

3. Coordinating conjunction (CC). For ex-
ample, 'for' in the sentence 'La Cote was much 
depressed, for he had scored here the worst fail-
ure of his campaign'. 

4. Subordinating conjunction (SC). For ex-
ample, 'because' in the sentence 'And people 
changed from diet to diet and felt guilty because 
they continued to like the things they weren't 
supposed to'. 

5. Subject (SUBJ). For example, in the sen-
tence 'His tone scared her more than anything 
she could remember', the subject 'his tone' 
represents the cause of Fear emotion expressed 
by the verb 'scared'. 

6. Verb or predicate (V). For example, the 
predicate 'filled with' connects the Joy emotion 
with its cause in the sentence 'As for the captain, 
the presence in his room of the children, who 
came to cheer up Ilusha, filled his heart from the 
first with ecstatic joy'. 

7. Object (OBJ). For example, in the sen-
tence 'I adore poetry', the object 'poetry' triggers 
Love emotion that is reflected through the verb 
'adore'.  

8. Attributive nominal (ATT). For example, 
in the sentence 'It is a sad tale, a very sad tale', 
emotional adjective 'sad' describes the noun 'tale' 
through attributive nominal relation (in this sen-
tence, 'tale' causes Distress emotion). 

In Table 1, the specific emotion-cause linguis-
tic relations that were found in our corpus of sen-
tences are listed according to their frequency. 
One-word prepositions (including 'to', 'for', 'of', 
'at', 'with', 'by', 'about', 'over' etc.) acting as lin-
kages between emotion tokens and phrases de-
scribing the cause of emotion occur in about 
68.2% of sentences. Subordinating conjunctions 
(examples include 'that', 'when', 'because', 'as' 
etc.) constitute about 21.4% of sentences. The 
object and subject are the next frequent relation 
types (about 6% and 2.3% of sentences, respec-
tively). 

3 Method for Extraction of Emotion 
Causes  

Our method for automatic extraction of emotion 
causes is based on the analysis of syntactic and 
dependency information from the parser. In our 

933



work we employ Connexor Machinese Syntax 
(http://www.connexor.eu/technology/machinese/) 
that is applied to each sentence in order to get 
lemmas, dependencies, syntactic and morpholog-
ical information (see example in Table 2). Using 
parser output, the method extracts phrases that 
characterize the emotion causes. 

The algorithm detects and extracts cause 
phrases introduced by prepositions (OWP and 
CP) through three rules: 

1. POSTMODIFIER rule: if morphological 
tag of the cause marker is PREP and this prepo-
sition is linked with the emotion token through 
mod syntactic relation, then extract all tokens 
related to this preposition. 

2. NEXT TOKEN rule: if morphological 
tag of the cause marker is PREP and syntactic 
relation of this preposition is unavailable (null 
relation), then if this cause marker directly fol-
lows the emotion token, extract all tokens related 
to this preposition. 

3. VERB-MEDIATED RELATION rule: if 
morphological tag of the cause marker is PREP 
and this preposition is directly connected with 

verb, to which emotion token is related within 
the clause, and the id of preposition is higher 
than that of emotion token, then extract all to-
kens related to this preposition. 

The rules for extraction of phrases connected 
to emotion tokens through conjunctions (SC and 
CC) are as follows: 

1. THAT rule: if morphological tag of the 
'that' cause marker is CS and the id of conjunc-
tion is higher than that of emotion token, then if 
verb of subordinate clause, to which the conjunc-
tion 'that' is connected, is related to emotion to-
ken through chain of relations, extract all tokens 
related to the verb of subordinate clause. 

2. DEPENDENT CLAUSE rule: if mor-
phological tag of the cause marker is CS or CC, 
and the dependent verb, to which conjunction is 
related, is connected to the main verb, to which 
emotion token is related (here, the emotion token 
might be the verb itself), then extract all tokens 
related to the verb of dependent clause. 

To detect verbs for the above rules, the algo-
rithm looks for the following functional tags: 
@+FMAINV (finite main verb), @-FMAINV 
(nonfinite main verb), and @<P-FMAINV (non-
finite clause as preposition complement). 

The extraction of emotion causes represented 
by either subject (SUBJ), or predicate (V), or 
object (OBJ), or attributive nominal (ATT) lin-
guistic relations is based on the analysis of subj, 
obj, and att syntactic relations and the corres-
ponding tokens.

4 Evaluation 
Based on the emotion cause phrases extracted by 
human annotator from our corpus consisting of 
532 sentences, we evaluated the appropriateness 
of the phrases extracted by our algorithm. In 
each pair of phrases, the number of words was 
calculated (namely, number of gold standard to-
kens and number of automatically extracted to-
kens). Then, the number of words correctly ex-
tracted by our algorithm was found, and we cal-
culated precision, recall, and F-score for each 
automatically extracted phrase. The results aver-
aged over all the phrases are given in Table 3 
(including the results on different groups and all 
emotion cause linguistic relations).  
 

 
Table 3. Evaluation of the appropriateness of 

automatically extracted emotion causes 
 

As seen from the obtained results, our algo-
rithm achieved the highest level of precision 
(0.787) in extracting emotion cause phrases 
represented by subject, predicate, object, and 
attributive nominal linguistic relations, while it 
was least precise (0.470) in case of emotion 
causes introduced by conjunctions. We obtained 
good results considering all emotion cause lin-
guistic relations: precision in 0.670, recall in 
0.692, and F-score in 0.658. 

We performed an error analysis on the sen-
tences, where our method failed to extract correct 
phrases. The classification and distribution of 
errors is given in Table 4. In most cases (about 
44.8%), the method failures were due to missing 
rule for infinitive marker 'to' (morphological tag 
INFMARK>, in contrast to preposition tag 
PREP). For example, 'to' in the sentence 'In that 
regard, New Zealand is proud to work towards 
nuclear disarmament with the other members of 
the New Agenda Coalition'. About 22.4% of er-
rors were caused by inability of the parser to 
output correct tags for syntactic relations. Analy-
sis of 'when' as a relative adverb (ADV and WH 
morphological tags), in addition to it as a subor-

dinating conjunction, would deal with about 
13.4% of errors. We found that the emotion 
causes represented by subordinate clauses with-
out such a marker of subordination as 'that' pose 
the main challenge, as the parser outputs null 
relations for such dependent clauses (for example, 
clause 'I never had to lie then' in the sentence 'I 
reckon I was so glad I never had to lie then'). 
The analysis of errors showed the necessity to 
improve several rules (such as THAT, POST-
MODIFIER, SUBJ, and OBJ rules). The method 
would also benefit from adding reference resolu-
tion. For example, using reference resolution, the 
method could extract 'these difficulties' instead of 
'they' as emotion cause from the sentence 'I could 
not dwell upon these difficulties fully, for they 
made me far too uneasy'. 

After improving the emotion cause extraction 
method by adding and modifying the rules, we 
obtained the following evaluation results: preci-
sion in 0.821, recall in 0.852, and F-score in 
0.810 (last row in Table 3). In that way, our me-
thod performed with about 15% gain in accuracy. 

5 Conclusions 
The main contributions of our work are the crea-
tion of a corpus of emotion causes specific for 22 
emotions from the OCC model and the develop-
ment of a novel method for extraction of emotion 
causes from sentences based on the analysis of 
syntactic and dependency information provided 
by the parser. In future research we plan to im-
prove our emotion cause extraction method and 
incorporate the automatic detection of an expe-
riencer of emotion specified by emotion token 
and the classification of causes as positive, nega-
tive, or neutral.
