Abstract

Humor is an important aspect in human
interaction to regulate conversations, in-
crease interpersonal attraction and trust.
For social robots, humor is one aspect
to make interactions more natural, enjoy-
able, and to increase credibility and ac-
ceptance. In combination with appropri-
ate non-verbal behavior, natural language
generation offers the ability to create con-
tent on-the-fly. This work outlines the
building-blocks for providing an individ-
ual, multimodal interaction experience by
shaping the robot’s humor with the help
of Natural Language Generation and Re-
inforcement Learning based on human so-
cial signals.

1 Introduction

Humor is an important aspect in human interac-
tion. It regulates conversations, increases inter-
personal attraction and trust. For embodied con-
versational agents, including social robots, humor
makes interactions more natural, enjoyable and in-
creases credibility and acceptance (Nijholt, 2007).
Canned jokes are the first type of humor that come
to mind. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), they
are used for entertainment purposes like stand-up
comedy and joke telling. Moreover, there are sev-
eral types of conversational humor (Dynel, 2009)
which are employed in human conversation. Gen-
eration of such humorous contents from the com-
putational perspective is hard because it usually re-
quires human creativity, not only because it is of-
ten context-dependent. Several research projects
already investigated generation of humor for chat
bots and joke generation.

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a key
component for social robots to generate humor-

ous contents on-the-fly, as it opens up the pos-
sibility to react to user input and to generate ut-
terances without the need to prepare scripted con-
tent in advance. The expression of humor also re-
quires to incorporate other modalities in the pre-
sentation, being mainly gestures, gaze and facial
expressions.

Keeping the diversity of interaction contexts,
tasks and human preferences in mind, social
robots should not only express humor, but also
adapt it accordingly. We propose an approach to
realize this by combining NLG and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to adapt the robot to the individ-
ual user’s preferences. Being able to dynamically
generate and present humorous content in a multi-
modal manner is one step to explore how to in-
crease perceived social intelligence and natural-
ness of interactions. As an example for the NLG
part we focus on ironical contents here.

First, we outline related work covering humor
from the perspective of language, gestures, gaze
and facial expressions, as well as adaptive social
robots. Afterwards, we look at how to imple-
ment expression of multimodal irony by combin-
ing NLG with non-verbal behaviors. Finally, we
propose the use of RL in combination with human
social signals to optimize parameters for afore-
mentioned robot modalities automatically, result-
ing in personalized interaction experiences for the
human user.

2 Related Work

We split up related work in two research areas:
(1) computational humor and experiments, which
investigate how to generate and present jokes, as
well as the role of humor for robots (2) adapta-
tion of social robots with focus on Reinforcement
Learning.

2.1 Humor

Several experiments for generation of humor in
text form include e.g. the “Light Bulb Joke
Generator” (Attardo and Raskin, 1994), “JAPE”
and “STANDUP” for punning riddles (Binsted
and Ritchie, 1997; Black et al., 2007) and “HA-
HACRONYM” for humorous acronyms (Stock
and Strapparava, 2002), only to name a few.
When looking at entertainment, Sjöbergh and
Araki (2008) found that jokes presented by robots
are rated significantly funnier than their text-only
equivalents. Further scenarios include Japanese
Manzai (Hayashi et al., 2008), stand-up comedy
(Nijholt, 2018; Knight, 2011; Katevas et al., 2015)
and joke telling (Weber et al., 2018), where the
robot presents scripted contents to the audience.
Apart from canned jokes, there are many types
of conversational humor (Dynel, 2009). For em-
bodied conversational agents, humor is one aspect
which contributes to the naturalness of an interac-
tion: it can help to solve communication problems
and to increase acceptance of natural language in-
terfaces when used sparingly and carefully (Bin-
sted et al., 1995). Appropriateness plays an impor-
tant role, as humor will yield misunderstanding in
the wrong situation (Nijholt, 2007).

In the context of robots, research by Mirnig
et al. (2016) comes to the conclusion that pos-
itively attributed forms of humor (self-irony)
are rated significantly higher than negative ones
(Schadenfreude) when it comes to robot likabil-
ity. Their results also indicate a general positive
effect of humor and an interaction effect between
user personality and preferred type of humor. Re-
sults from recent studies by Mirnig et al. (2017) in-
dicate that adding unimodal verbal or non-verbal,
humorous elements to non-humorous robot behav-
ior does not automatically result in increased per-
ceived funniness. They point out that humor is
multilayered and results from several modalities.

2.2 Social Adaptation

Social robots, which adapt their behaviors to hu-
man users, are used in a variety of settings. Aly
and Tapus (2016) employ NLG with a NAO robot
for user-robot personality matching. Both gestures
and speech are adapted to the human’s personality
profile while the user can get information about
several restaurants from the robot. Another ap-
proach is used by Tapus et al. (2008): the authors
use RL to optimize the robot’s personality in the

context of post-stroke rehabilitation therapy. They
use scripted utterances in the context of exercises.

RL is used often as machine learning framework
for adaptation of social robots’ behaviors. For ex-
ample, it is used to learn social behavior (Bar-
raquand and Crowley, 2008), for student tutor-
ing (Gordon et al., 2016), to maintain long-term
user engagement when playing games (Leite et al.,
2011) and intervention for children with autism
spectrum disorder (Liu et al., 2008).

Different data is used to provide the RL
feedback signal (reward), including task-related
information like user performance (e.g. in
exercises/games) and human social signals.
Tactile (Barraquand and Crowley, 2008) or
prosodic (Kim and Scassellati, 2007) feedback,
interaction distance, gaze meeting, motion speed,
timing (Mitsunaga et al., 2008), gesture and
posture (Najar et al., 2016; Ritschel et al., 2017),
or gaze direction (Fournier et al., 2017) are used
in different scenarios. Another option is to use
physiological data from ECG (Liu et al., 2008)
or EEG (Tsiakas et al., 2018). In the context of
humor, smile and gaze (Leite et al., 2011; Gordon
et al., 2016; Hemminghaus and Kopp, 2017), as
well as laughter (Hayashi et al., 2008; Knight,
2011; Katevas et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2018) are
used, as these are contemporary human reactions
serving as an indication whether a joke is good or
bad from the perspective of the human listener.

3 Adaptive Robot Humor with NLG

To shape the humor of a social robot, both humor-
ous content as well as an adaptation approach to
the human’s preferences is presented. Since lan-
guage plays an important role for communicat-
ing information, we take a look at NLG for gen-
erating ironical statements, combined with multi-
modal markers including facial expression, gaze
or gestures. In combination, these can result in hu-
morous contents and elicit human social signals,
which can serve as indication whether the robot’s
behavior is pleasing or not.

3.1 Generating Ironical Statements

Computational creation of creative, humorous
content is very hard. However, there are many
findings concerning types and multimodal mark-
ers of humor (Burgers and van Mulken, 2017), es-
pecially for irony (Attardo et al., 2003), which can
result in humor, too. We focus on ironical con-

13



Figure 1: Generating ironical statements in multiple stages

Figure 2: Overview of the adaptation process

tents here because the generation task can be real-
ized as illustrated in Figure 1. First, Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) is used to check whether
the input utterance can be transformed in an iron-
ical statement. Then, NLG allows to convert the
original utterance by inverting and applying lin-
guistic markers. Apart from the semantic content
of an ironical utterance, the way in which it is pre-
sented plays a crucial role. While written text may
use direct, typographic or morpho-syntactic mark-
ers to help the reader to identify ironical content,
linguistic, paralinguistic and visual markers are of
special interest. Finally, these should be expressed
by a robot with non-verbal behavior. Otherwise,
irony might not be perceived by the listener. Fa-
cial expressions that indicate irony include raised
or lowered eyebrows, wide open eyes, squinting
or rolling, winking, nodding, smiling or a “blank
face”. Moreover, there are different acoustic pa-
rameter modulations. However, these are not con-
sistent and differ from language to language.

The mentioned findings form a good starting
point to implement expressive multimodal humor-
ous contents for social robots by emphasizing spo-
ken words generated by NLG with matching gaze,
facial expressions and gestures in real-time.

3.2 Adaptation Process

Adaptation of humorous contents is often based
on human social signals, primarily by sensing vo-
cal laughter and smile to estimate the spectator’s
amusement. This applies to the aforementioned
Japanese Manzai, standup comedy and joke telling
scenarios. These experiments adapt the presented

contents and their delivery in terms of animation,
sound or voice parameters, but without generating
content on-the-fly with the help of NLG.

Figure 2 outlines our suggested adaptation
mechanism for learning about which humor the
user prefers. It is based on the general idea of in-
cluding human social signals in the learning pro-
cess of the robot (Ritschel, 2018). The user’s so-
cial signals are captured via camera and micro-
phone. Signal processing allows to extract user
smile and vocal laughter, similar to the opera-
tionalization in Weber et al. (2018). This infor-
mation can be used to shape the reward of the
machine learning process. RL is used to manip-
ulate the generation of the humorous content by
altering parameters for NLG and animation, e.g.
resulting in the use of ironical comments in one
situation or not. Actually, there are many op-
tions what actually can be learned, including hu-
mor types or parameters of animation generation,
e.g. to optimize non-verbal aspects of joke pre-
sentation, which might have different effects when
expressed by a robot than by a human. By incor-
porating the user’s feedback in terms of smile and
laughter, the agent is able to learn how to make
the user laugh by means of language, facial ex-
pression, gaze or gestures. Combining NLG with
the generation of additional multimodal behaviors
allows social robots to add humorous elements in
conversations. It provides the opportunity to per-
sonalize and adapt the interaction experience to
the individual preferences of the human user.

4 Conclusion

We have outlined the important role and opportu-
nities of NLG to increase the credibility and ac-
ceptance of the robot and the naturalness of inter-
actions. Generating contents on-the-fly allows to
add humorous elements on demand. We have de-
scribed an adaptation process to realize individu-
alized interaction experiences for the human user.
By incorporating human social signals in the RL
process the robot can optimize the presentation of
humorous contents depending on interaction con-
text, task and human preferences.
