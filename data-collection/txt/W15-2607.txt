Abstract

Health campaigns that aim to raise aware-
ness and subsequently raise funds for re-
search and treatment are commonplace.
While many local campaigns exist, very
few attract the attention of a global au-
dience. One of those global campaigns
is Movember, an annual campaign dur-
ing the month of November, that is di-
rected at men’s health with special foci
on cancer & mental health. Health cam-
paigns routinely use social media portals
to capture people’s attention. Recently, re-
searchers began to consider to what ex-
tent social media is effective in raising the
awareness of health campaigns. In this pa-
per we expand on those works by conduct-
ing an investigation across four different
countries, while not only restricting our-
selves to the impact on awareness but also
on fund-raising. To that end, we analyze
the 2013 Movember Twitter campaigns
in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom
and the United States.

1 Introduction

The rise of social media portals — and thus ac-
cess to vast amounts of user-generated data —
has not gone unnoticed within the health care do-
main. Existing works have, amongst others, ex-
ploited social media data to track and predict the
spread of diseases (Achrekar et al., 2011; Culotta,
2010; Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Diaz-Aviles
and Stewart, 2012), to analyse the effects of drug
interactions (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014), and to
examine trends for cardiac arrest and resuscitation
communication (Bosley et al., 2013).

Social media portals have also been employed
to distribute health information on diseases and
treatment options. In (Scanfeld et al., 2010; Vance

et al., 2009), for instance, it has been shown that
effective dissemination of such information can be
achieved through Twitter and YouTube. At the
same time though, Moorhead et al. (2013) argue
that social health communication research is still
in its infancy and large gaps in our understanding
remain.

While the usage of social media for health
campaigns is ever-growing, very few works have
considered how effective these campaigns are in
achieving their goals. While Thackeray et al.
(2013) and Bravo and Hoffman-Goetz (2015) in-
vestigated the change of people’s awareness dur-
ing social media health campaigns, to our knowl-
edge no research so far has considered the second
goal of many health campaigns — raising funds
for research and treatment.

In this paper, we contribute to closing this gap,
(1) by conducting an awareness-based large-scale
analysis across several countries, and (2) by inves-
tigating the extent to which a global social-media
based health campaign is successful in terms of
fund-raising. We investigate the particular use
case of Movember, an annual health campaign
conducted (amongst others) through social me-
dia channels that has two goals1: (1) to gather
“funding for the Movember Foundation’s men’s
health programs”, and, (2) to start “conversa-
tions about men’s health”. In both cases, the
main foci are on various types of cancer that typ-
ically occur in men and on men’s mental health.
Movember is a world-wide campaign that aims
to raise funds through a number of social activ-
ities, chief among them the growing of a mous-
tache in the month of November. Although a
global event, the Movember campaigns are lo-
calized; each participating country runs its own
campaign. In our analysis we focus on the four
English-language local campaigns that yield the

most donations via Twitter: the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia2. Glob-
ally, Movember can be considered a success, as
in 2013 alone (the year we investigate) funds in ex-
cess of 123 million AU$ were raised world-wide3.

In our work we investigate whether social me-
dia activities can explain the success of the cam-
paign (both in terms of raising awareness and
financially) by correlating Twitter usage with
Movember website visits and received donations.
We chose Twitter as our social media channel of
choice, due to its popularity and ubiquitous na-
ture in the English-speaking world. We investi-
gate the differences and similarities between the
Movember Twitter campaigns running in differ-
ent countries, and aim analyze to what extent those
factors can explain awareness and fund-raising
metrics.

In the remainder of this paper we first discuss
previous findings concerning social media-based
health campaigns (§2), before introducing the re-
search hypotheses we focus on in this work and
the necessary data sources (§3). Our results are
discussed in §4. Lastly, we outline potential av-
enues for future work in §5.

2 Health Campaigns & Social Media

In this section we provide an overview of exist-
ing health campaign research across social media
channels. Almost all research conducted in this
area investigates the social media portal Twitter.
An overview of the employed data in past works
is presented in Table 1.

Thackeray et al. (2013) analyzed the impact
of the Breast Cancer Awareness month (an inter-
national campaign held annually in October) on
Twitter users. They focused on engagement met-
rics and found that tweets discussing breast cancer
issues spiked dramatically in the beginning of Oc-
tober but quickly tapered off. In terms of topical
aspects, organizations and celebrities posted more
often than individuals about fundraisers, early de-
tection and diagnoses, while individuals focused
more on wearing pink4. Similarly, a topic analy-
sis was conducted by Bravo and Hoffman-Goetz
(2015) on the 2013 Canadian Movember cam-
paign. The authors categorized 4,222 sampled

five countries in terms of donations.

tweets related to the campaign into four different
categories (health information, campaign, partic-
ipation and opinion). Due to the small number
of identified health information tweets in the sam-
ple (considered to be the main signal of increased
awareness), the authors concluded that the goal of
raising awareness has not been met.
Lovejoy et al. (2012) investigated how non-profit
organizations use Twitter by analyzing more than
70 different organizations, among them 19 health
care organizations, along various basic aspects in-
cluding the number of followers, tweets, retweets,
etc. Importantly, the authors found that most orga-
nizations use Twitter as a one-way communication
channel instead of making full use of its poten-
tial and multi-way communication. Smitko (2012)
developed two theories, of how non-profit orga-
nizations can build and strengthen their relation-
ships with donors on Twitter: the Social Network
Theory (SNT) and the Social-Judgement Theory
(SJT). According to SNT, organizations need to
strengthen their network of trust by engaging more
with their followers while in SJT, organizations
need to tailor the content of their tweets to match
the interest of their followers. Due to the small-
scale nature of the empirical analysis (based on
300 tweets), we consider it an open question to
what extent those theories hold.
While to our knowledge, no existing work has con-
sidered the financial success of health campaigns,
we note that Sylvester et al. (2014) studied the
relationship between social media activities (on
Twitter and news streams) and donations to a large
non-profit organization during hurricane Irene, a
tropical cyclone that hit the US in 2011. A spatial
analysis revealed that donors living in states af-
fected by Irene donated more than donors in non-
affected states.

To summarize, past works have shown that (i)
various types of social media users behave differ-
ently during health campaigns (celebrities vs. indi-
viduals vs. organizations), and (ii) sufficient con-
tent related to health campaigns is created on Twit-
ter. What we are lacking is a large-scale analysis
of the impact these social media health campaigns
have across countries and on fund-raising.

paigns received through Twitter5. We are thus
conducting an exploratory analysis on two distinct
data sources:

Twitter Corpus TwMov: This corpus contains
all tweets6 published during the month of Novem-
ber 2013 that contain the keyword Movember
— 1,113,534 tweets in total, posted by 688,488
unique Twitter users across the world. Twenty-one
local Movember campaign accounts are active,
such as @MovemberUK, @MovemberAUS and
@MovemberCA. To enable a country-by-country
analysis, we estimated the country each tweet was
sent from, according to the machine learning ap-
proach described by Van der Veen et al. (2015). In
this manner, we were able to label all tweets in our
data set with the (likely) country of origin. The ap-
proach has been shown to have a country-level ac-
curacy above 80%, a level we consider sufficiently
high for our purposes. In total, tweets from 125
different countries were found. The geographic
distribution of these tweets is presented in Figure
1, normalized with respect to each country’s pop-

ulation, to allow a comparison across countries. It
is evident, that the Movember campaign is most
popular in North America, Australia and Europe.
Most activity (relative to the population) is gener-
ated by Twitter users in the UK, followed by those
in Canada. Thus, the four countries we focus our
analysis on are not only among the most active in
terms of fund-raising, but also among the most ac-
tive in terms of Movember-related Twitter usage.

Movember data: The Movember website vis-
itor and donation data we gathered from 2013 is
restricted to those visitors and donations the in-
dividual national Movember campaigns received
through Twitter. Overall, in 2013, 357,400 AU$
were donated through Twitter, spread over 21 na-
tional campaigns (though donations were received
from 179 countries in total). Thus, only 2.9% of
all 2013 donations were received through Twitter.
This is a limiting factor to our work, but at the
same time allows us to be certain that all of our
Movember website visitors and donors were ex-
posed to Twitter activities related to Movember.
Our data set has a single day resolution with all
of the following information being available for
each individual national campaign website: (1) the

nating in each country by each country’s population.

number of visitors, (2) the number of returning
visitors, (3)-(4) the number of financial transac-
tions from new and returning visitors, and, (5)-(6)
the number of total revenue generated from new
and returning visitors. Note that this data does not
contain information identifying individual users, it
is an aggregate — per day — of all user activities
on each Movember campaign website. For the
four national campaigns investigated in this work,
the visitors and donations are listed in Table 3.

As already indicated, Movember is a social
event, members of the campaign are called Mo
Bros (men) and Mo Sistas (women). Every mem-
ber can register on the Movember website and
collect donations through that site (localized per
country). Mo Bros & Mo Sistas can join to form
teams and fund-raise together. While growing
a moustache is the most common activity, Mo
Bros/Mo Sistas can also use alternative social ac-
tivities for fund-raising. At the end of the one-
month campaign cycle, the teams and individuals
raising the most donations within their country re-
ceive awards and prices.

3.1 Research Hypotheses
Based on our research goal, we developed three
research hypotheses:

H1: The more well-known Twitter users (celebrities
and organizations) support a Movember cam-
paign, the more awareness and funds the cam-
paign will raise.

H2: Movember campaigns that emphasize the social
and fun aspect of the campaign, engage the users
better and thus will raise more awareness and
funds.

H3: Movember campaigns that focus on health topics,

raise more awareness to the campaign and thus
will raise more funds.

H2 and H3 are competing hypotheses, as prior
works have not offered conclusive evidence to em-
phasize one direction (health vs. social) over an-
other.

3.2 From Hypotheses to Measurements
Having presented the research hypotheses that
guide our work, we now describe how to empir-
ically measure to what extent they hold.

Based on the Movember data set, we can di-
rectly measure the impact on donations. At the
same time though, we cannot directly measure
awareness; we chose to approximate this metric
by the number of visitors the Movember website
receives.

To examine H1 we require a definition for
what constitutes a well-known Twitter user (a
“celebrity”). We start with the definition posed
by Thackeray et al. (2013), according to which
celebrities have more than fUSA = 100, 000 fol-
lowers and are verified by Twitter. As this def-
inition was derived for tweets originating in the
United States, we normalize fCountry according
to the country’s population and remove the re-
quirement of being verified. Specifically, for the
remaining three countries we employ the follow-
ing cutoffs: fCanada = 11, 000, fUK = 20, 000,
and fAustralia = 7, 000.

To investigate the impact of health (related)
organizations on Twitter, we define health or-
ganizations as those Twitter accounts with more
than 5, 000 followers and at least one of the fol-
lowing keywords in their Twitter profile (an ap-

58



proach borrowed from (Thackeray et al., 2013)):
{cancer, health, pharmacy, pharmaceutical, cam-
paign, government, firm, company, companies,
news, group, society, committee, volunteer, we, of-
ficial, marketing, promotions and forum).}. The
overlap between both types of users (well-known
vs. organizations) is between 2.2% (US) and
30.7% (Australia).

3.2.1 Manual Annotation Efforts
Hypotheses H2 and H3 require a content anal-
ysis of the Twitter messages. For this purpose,
one of the authors manually annotated 2,000 ran-
domly drawn English-language tweets (with 500
tweets each drawn from the UK, Canada, the
United States and Australia) from TwMov into
several categories, inspired by the work of Bravo
and Hoffman-Goetz (2015). We distinguish five
main categories: health, campaign, participation,
social and other, with each one (except other)
containing between two and three sub-categories
(e.g. health tweets are further categorized as can-
cer, general and mental). Overall, we distinguish
12 different categories/sub-categories. Tweets can
belong to multiple categories or sub-categories;
tweets that are not found to belong to any of the
first four categories are classified as other. An
overview of the categories and the resulting anno-
tations (including examples of categorized tweets)
is shown in Table 2. Across all countries, we find
the social aspect to be the most pronounced in our
sample — 51% of the sampled tweets are catego-
rized as such. Less than 5% of the tweets men-
tion health issues and even more strikingly, the
second pillar of Movember’s campaign (mental
health) is almost completely absent in our sample.
These results are largely in line with Bravo and
Hoffman-Goetz (2015)’s findings for the Cana-
dian Movember campaign, where cancer-related
tweets were found in only 0.6% of the sample.
This manual annotation effort does not only serve
as a confirmation of (Bravo and Hoffman-Goetz,
2015), it also shows that these findings hold across
countries.

3.2.2 Automatic Classification
Due to the small number of manually anno-
tated tweets in the individual sub-categories, we
decided to automatically classify all tweets of
TwMov according to the most opposing ends of
the spectrum: health vs. social. This was done
separately for each country. Concretely, we aim to

classify each tweet into one of four categories: (1)
health, (2) social, (3) health & social or (4) other.
In order to add robustness to the classifier, we use
the insights gained during the manual annotation
process to enlarge our training set by automati-
cally selecting additional positive training tweets.
For the health classifier, tweets containing one of
the following key phrases were used: {prostate,
testicular, cancer, mental, health}. Similarly, for
the social classifier, we relied on tweets contain-
ing at least one of: {gala, party, event, contest,
competition, stach, handlebar, facial hair, shave,
instagram, twitter.*photo.} as positive training
data. Recall, that all tweets in our corpus con-
tain the term Movember by definition, thus ensur-
ing topicality. Overall, in this manner we labelled
406, 709 tweets across all countries, consisting of
120, 601 health tweets and 286, 108 social tweets.
A total of 35, 489 tweets were identified as being
both social and health-related. These simple rules
have thus allowed us to categorize 36.5% of all
tweets in TwMov; the remaining 63.5% of tweets
are categorized according to our classifier output.

We train separate classifiers for each country.
We randomly draw 5,000 labelled health (social)
tweets as positive training examples of the health
(social) classifier. We draw the same amount of
non-health (non-social) tweets as negative training
examples for balanced training8. We performed
basic data cleaning steps, removing stopwords
(which in this case includes the term “Movem-
ber”) and employing stemming. As classification
algorithm we selected Naı̈ve Bayes with terms as
features9. We classified the tweets in TwMov to
zero, one or both categories (health/social) de-
pending on the confidence threshold of the indi-
vidual classifier (a tweet classified with confidence
≥ 0.5 is assigned to the classifier’s category).

4 Results

To determine the influence on the number of do-
nations and visitors, we correlate (using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient r) the Twitter-based metrics
(e.g. number of tweets) with the donation and vis-
itor data from the Movember data set on a day-
by-day basis for the month of November.

8Note that using all already labelled tweets as positive
training examples is not possible, as in effect nearly all re-
maining tweets would act as negative training examples in a
balanced training setup.

Hypothesis H1: To investigate H1, we corre-
late the number of Movember tweets by well-
known Twitter users on a given day with the do-
nations/visitors to the Movember campaign web-

in Table 4. While the visitors correlate to a sig-
nificant degree with several tweet-based measures
for the United Kingdom and Australia, we do

not observe significant correlations for visitors in
Canada or the US. Organizations have a similar
impact to Twitter celebrities (normalized by coun-
try) in terms of drawing visitors to the Movember
website. Contrary to our intuition, we do not
observe any significant correlations between the
daily number of donations and Twitter activities.

their correlation (day-by-day) with the number of daily donations and daily visitors to each country’s
Movember website. The thresholds for statistical significance (for N = 30 days) are † r = 0.37
(p < 0.05) and ‡ r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) respectively.

Hypotheses H2 & H3 In Table 5 we present
the impact social and health topics have on
Movember donations and visitors. The results
are similar to the previous experiment: we observe
significant correlations only with Movember vis-
itor data; Australia & United Kingdom exhibit
moderate to strong correlations while for Canada
& the US the correlations are weak to non-
significant. Considering the influence of health
vs. social we find that social tweets exhibit a
stronger correlation with visitor data than health
tweets across all countries — this in fact is the
only experiment where statistically significant re-
sults are observed across all four countries.

Further Insights In Figure 2 we visualize
the relationship between the number of visi-
tors/donations and the number of health/social
tweets in the form of scatter plots. While the vis-
itor data shows few outliers (corresponding to the
first & last day of the campaign) and has a clear
linear trend, the donation plot is evidently non-
linear without a clear pattern emerging.

Finally, in Figure 3, we plot — exemplary for
the United Kingdom — the overall trends in the
number of tweets, the number of Movember vis-
itors and the number of Movember donations be-
tween the end of October 2013 and early Decem-
ber 2013. We observe that over time, the over-
all tweet volume declines slightly (apart from the
final day of the campaign), while the number of
visitors and the number of donations are in a re-
verse relationship: the number of visitors steadily
declines over the month of the campaign while the
number of donations steadily increases. Twitter

activity related to Movember quickly ceases to
exist after the end of November.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we investigated the impact of differ-
ent social media strategies on a health campaign’s
ability to raise awareness and attract funds. We in-
vestigated the specific use case of Movember, a
global campaign which enjoys widespread popu-
larity in many countries. We focused our analyses
on the four most active English-language countries
of the Movember campaign.

Our findings partially corroborate previous
findings on raising awareness, especially those
in (Bravo and Hoffman-Goetz, 2015), while ex-
panding on them across several dimensions, most
importantly the number of countries investigated
and the size of the investigated social media

Table 5: Overview of the number of tweets classified according to their health and/or social intent as well
as their correlation (day-by-day) with Movember donation and visitor data. The thresholds for statistical
significance (for N = 30 days) are † r = 0.37 (p < 0.05) and ‡ r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) respectively.

sample. We find that across countries Twitter
users mostly focus on the social aspect of the
Movember campaign, with relatively few tweets
focusing on the health aspect of Movember. Ad-
ditionally, those users that do mention health-
related issues, often use generic statements, in-
stead of focusing on the two specific health issues
that Movember aims to address (cancer and men-
tal health). Surprisingly, the mental health aspect
of Movember is virtually not discussed at all.

To explore the impact of social media strategies
on awareness and fund-raising, we analysed the
relationship between Movember website visitor
& donation data and Twitter activities. We found
significant correlations between Movember visi-
tors and the Movember-related activities of well-
known Twitter users. We also found clear ev-
idence that social tweets have a higher impact
on visitors than health tweets. While the ob-
served correlations were moderate to strong for
the United Kingdom and Australia, we only found

weak to non-significant correlations for Canada
and the United States. Across all countries, we did
not find significant correlations between donations
and Twitter activities.

Based on these findings, we plan to investigate
on a more fine-grained and semantic level in what
aspects the Twitter-based Movember activities
differ between Australia/UK and Canada/US. We
will also consider a temporal analysis of the dona-
tion/visitor data, comparing trends across several
years of Movember donation data and Twitter ac-
tivities. We also intend to incorporate more fine-
grained information about the Twitter users in our
analyses, such as their motivations to participate
in the campaign (Nguyen et al., 2015).
