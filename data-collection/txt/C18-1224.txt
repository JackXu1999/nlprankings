Abstract
Commonsense, real-world knowledge about the events that entities or “things in the world” are
typically involved in, as well as part-whole relationships, is valuable for allowing computational
systems to draw everyday inferences about the world. Here, we focus on automatically extracting
information about (1) the events that typically bring about certain entities (origins), (2) the
events that are the typical functions of entities, and (3) part-whole relationships in entities. These
correspond to the agentive, telic and constitutive qualia central to the Generative Lexicon. We
describe our motivations and methods for extracting these qualia relations from the Suggested
Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and show that human annotators overwhelmingly find the
information extracted to be reasonable. Because ontologies provide a way of structuring this
information and making it accessible to agents and computational systems generally, efforts
are underway to incorporate the extracted information to an ontology hub of Natural Language
Processing semantic role labeling resources, the Rich Event Ontology.

1 Introduction

Most adults could tell you that an umbrella is used to keep the rain off of you, that bread is baked, or that
dandelions are made up of leaves, stems, and flowers. Commonsense, real-world knowledge about the
events that entities or “things in the world” are typically involved in, as well as part-whole relationships,
is valuable for allowing computational systems to draw everyday inferences about the world. Here, we
describe our approach for automatically extracting this information from the Suggested Upper Merged
Ontology (SUMO) (Niles and Pease, 2001a; Pease, 2011). We assume the theoretical framework of
the Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky, 1991), as we find GL qualia relations useful for considering
the typical involvement of a particular entity in events. Thus, we focus on relationships between entities
and events captured in a set of qualia associated with an entity. We find that human annotators asked to
evaluate the quality and accuracy of the information extracted overwhelmingly find the origins, functions
and part-whole relationships proposed to be reasonable.

One of our motivations is to add the extracted qualia relations to an ontology hub of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) semantic role labeling (SRL) resources, the Rich Event Ontology (REO). We plan to
exploit the qualia relations within REO to make generalizations across participant types for a given event
type, thereby facilitating the addition of selectional restrictions, and to enable some shallow inferencing
about how entities generally come into existence, how they are used, and what they are made up of. By
structuring this information within REO we aim, for example, to allow an agent or computational system
to infer that a room (whether detected visually or described in text) with a stove, pans, and a refrigerator
is likely a kitchen where food preparation happens. Our approach first requires expansion of REO to
include additional “things,” or ENDURANTS as they are called in REO, since past efforts have focused
on the inclusion of events or PERDURANTS. We again draw information from SUMO to quickly and
efficiently add high-quality information on ENDURANTS to REO, and discuss the linking model we have
developed to integrate the new classes from SUMO.

2 Theoretical Framework: Generative Lexicon

The theory of GL focuses on the distributed nature of compositionality in natural language (Pustejovsky,
1991), which attributes parts of the semantic load to non-verb constituents, as opposed to approaches
where verbs are at the center of the notion of compositionality, (e.g. Levin (1993)). According to GL
theory, every entity has a set of qualia that plays a role in what events that entity can be involved in,
and that directly affects the compositional meaning that arises from the mention of a particular entity
being involved in a particular event. The set of qualia GL proposes include formal, telic, agentive, and
constitutive. The formal quale represents the IS-A relation for a given entity. For example, the formal
quale for dandelion might be plant. The constitutive quale is the set of other entities that are typically
considered to be parts of the given entity or the material of the entity. For example, the constitutive
quale for plant could be leaf, stem, etc., and the constitutive quale for pottery could be clay. The telic
quale represents the typical purpose or function of the given entity, if there is one (e.g., the telic quale
of umbrella might be protect from rain). The agentive quale represents the factors involved in how the
given entity came into being (e.g., the agentive quale of bread could be baking).

Note that there is no single set of defined quale for the entities of the world, hence there is indetermi-
nacy in how these should be labeled and at what level of granularity (i.e., is the agentive quale of bread
better captured as baking or as applying heat?). It is in part for this reason that situating qualia relations
in an ontology, as was done with SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), is so appealing. An ontology provides a
common vocabulary for entities and events and structures them in a hierarchy from most general to most
specific.

In an ontology with GL qualia, any node would inherit all the qualia from the set of its ancestors. The
deeper we go into the lower levels of the hierarchy, the more specific the qualia get, and, in some cases,
they may override parts of the qualia they have inherited. For instance, any physical object has a physical
form (formal quale), so any Artifact inherits this property because it is a child to the physical object
node in the ontology. In addition to this inherited quale, Artifact introduces to the ontology its own
set of qualia: an agentive quale of making and a very general telic quale of some event, since every
artifact is ‘made’ and typically has ‘some purpose’.

3 Resource Background

3.1 SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)

SUMO was originally an upper level ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001a), but now includes mid-level and
domain ontologies as well (Pease, 2002). These domain-specific ontologies inherit the broad conceptual
distinctions of SUMO, and specify the concepts and axiomatic content of a particular domain. Niles
and Pease (2001b) explain SUMO’s most general concepts and the relations between them, such as
the distinction between Object and Process. Pease et al. (2002) illustrates the structure of SUMO
and explains that the existence of SUMO-WordNet mapping serves as a gauge of the coverage of the
ontology. Niles and Pease (2003) explain a SUMO-Wordnet mapping methodology and the specifics of
the language used to show the synonymy, hypernymy, and instantiation relations.

In addition to the relations between entities that ontologies typically contain, SUMO provides relations
between entities and processes, and statements in higher order logic (Benzmüller and Pease, 2012)
that attempt to fully define each concept. For instance, the relation result is a binary relation with two
arguments, a Process and an Entity, where the Entity is the output or product of the Process.
So both temporally and causally, the Process is antecedent to the Entity. This relation is one of
a few that help us find the agentive quale. Another relation between a Process and an Entity is
instrument, where the Entity is used by an agent in bringing about a Process. So, in this case, the
Process is consequent to the Entity. We use this relation to help find the telic quale for entities.

Relations are nodes under the Abstract hierarchy of SUMO, but many relations have sub-relations
as well as instances. In general, since relations are like functions, each relation has a domain, and SUMO
provides the set of arguments each relation can take. In some cases, the argument of a relation could be
a whole formula by itself, so it does not point to a certain set. Rather, it is usually a complex axiom in



2646

itself, containing at least one Entity, at least one relation, and possibly some Processes. One of the
main pointers we use to find telic quale is hasPurpose, which usually has such complex arguments. These
arguments are themselves logical formulae, supported in the higher order logic employed for SUMO. For
instance, SUMO stipulates the purpose of a Microwave using the hasPurpose relation, with a formula
that can translate to: there is an entity PreparedFood and a process Heating, and the Microwave
is an instrument for Heating, through which the PreparedFood gets heated.

3.2 REO (Rich Event Ontology)

The Rich Event Ontology (REO) unifies existing SRL schemas by providing an independent conceptual
backbone through which they can be associated, and it augments the schemas with event-to-event causal
and temporal relations. The ontology was developed in response to unsuccessful efforts to map directly
between FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2002) and the small set of disparate event types in Rich Entities,
Relations and Events (ERE) (Song et al., 2015) (originally based on Automatic Content Extraction
(ACE) (Doddington et al., 2004)). The difficulty was mainly due to differences in the granularity of
events described by the FrameNet frames and ERE event types and inconsistencies in how the resources
divided the semantic space.

FrameNet, ERE, and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) have wide-coverage lexicons having to do with events,
and they contribute annotated corpora and additional semantic and syntactic information that can be cru-
cial to identifying events and their participants. REO serves as a shared hub for the disparate annotation
schemas and therefore enables the combination of SRL training data into a larger, more diverse corpus, as
well as expanding the set of lexical items associated with each ERE event type. By adding temporal and
causal relational information, the ontology also facilitates reasoning on and across documents, revealing
relationships between events that come together in temporal and causal chains to build more complex
scenarios.

The structure of REO, illustrated in Figure 1, consists of a main “reference” ontology of generic event
types and individual OWL “resource” ontologies. The relationships between the generic event types in
the reference ontology and the event designations made in a particular annotated data resource are spelled
out in various “linking models” that import both the reference ontology and a resource ontology. In the
example shown, REO Discharge events map to the Releasing frame in FrameNet and the Release-
Parole event type in ERE. However, other mappings between ERE and FN are necessarily more indirect.
With respect to the Communication node in REO, ERE/ACE only maps to instrument communication
and statement while FN has mappings to nearly all daughters, as does VN, and VN maps to the mother
Communication node as well. Additional indirect mappings are detailed in Brown et al. (2017). Individ-
ual words within the resource classes can be detected in text to find a wide variety of each event type, or
one can query to view its participants and its relations to other events that is independent of the various
lexical resource schemas.

4 Related Work

In considering how to best capture the type of information desired for relating ENDURANTS to PER-
DURANTS, we have examined the approaches of other benchmark ontologies. We find that the Basic
Formal Ontology (BFO) (Smith et al., 2014) and the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive
Engineering (DOLCE) (Masolo et al., 2003) largely focus on parthood relations, qualities, and general
notions of participation of an ENDURANT (or “continuant” as labeled in BFO) in a PERDURANT (or
“occurrent” in BFO). The parthood relations have some overlapping information with the GL constitu-
tive quale. Also of relevance to our work, BFO includes a class of what it calls “specifically dependent
continuants,” which includes functions, such as the function of a hammer to drive in nails.

The Event and Implied Situation Ontology (ESO) focuses on pre and post situations with respect to
some event type, making explicit how a participant’s pre and post states change in an event. Although
there may be some amount of overlap in what ESO includes and the information captured in the GL
agentive quale (e.g., the agentive quale for bread is baking), ESO’s information will likely be much
broader than the GL agentive, which essentially is limited to creation events. Although we hope to

ERE and FrameNet shown, but ACE and VerbNet linking models exist as well).

integrate or map the added and overlapping information from ESO, BFO and DOLCE in the future, here
we focus on extracting information from SUMO.

5 Automatic Extraction of Qualia Relation Information

5.1 Methodology

In order to find qualia relations for entities in REO, we looked for ways to automatically extract them
from SUMO. By examining around a hundred nodes in SUMO, a number of relations were found to
be useful in extracting qualia. For instance, the relation hasPurpose in SUMO directly specifies the
purpose (hence the telic quale) of a given entity. If a given entity is the second argument of the relation
instrument, then it is a tool used to bring about an event which is the first argument of the relation
instrument in the same axiom (e.g., (instrument ?TRANSFER ?ARTERY), where ARTERY is a tool
enabling a TRANSFER event). Therefore, the first argument could be extracted as the telic quale of this
entity. In the same way, a number of relations, including part and all its sub-relations, were found to
lead us to the constitutive quale. For instance, we find that Syllable is a part of a Word, through
an axiom roughly like (part Syllable Word). Though the sub-relations of part have fine-grained
semantic differences, they all have the same weight here for our purposes. These include relations such
as initialPart, initiallyContainsPart, partTypes, typicalPart, etc. The SUMO relation result leads us to
the agentive quale, as its second argument is the output (or the product) of its first argument (e.g., (result
?WRITE ?TEXT) where TEXT is the output of WRITE event).

In addition to using SUMO relations, we used each node’s documentation in SUMO to automatically
extract telic quale using fairly straightforward regular expressions, since a number of entities were found
in our initial examination to have their purpose described in their documentation, but not in their ax-
ioms. For instance, we extracted parts of the documentation that occur after terms such as ‘purpose is,’
‘intended to,’ ‘designed for,’ etc. as potential candidates for the telic quale.

As the formal quale is basically an IS-A relationship, we extracted the parent of each node as its formal
quale. Of course the inheritance is always at work for all the four types of qualia relations. For instance,
an Adverb is a Word (parent), but is also a LinguisticExpression (grandparent).

The output of the function that automatically extracts qualia1 currently can have two forms. If they
are extracted from SUMO axioms, we have a set of functions to extract the actual SUMO node that

1https://github.com/ghamzak/SUMOQualiaExtraction



2648

represents the desired quale. The second format of the output occurs when we extract qualia from the
documentation. In this case, what we extract is actually plain English – a part of a sentence. In writing
functions to extract sensible parts of sentences, we decided to sacrifice recall in favor of precision. At the
end, we managed to extract 112 agentive, 762 telic, and 481 constitutive qualia relations. We also have
a separate function that takes a SUMO entity as input and returns all possible qualia found in SUMO for
that entity. For instance, Building has 13 total qualia found in SUMO, including 13 constitutive, 1
telic, and 1 agentive qualia relations. Table 1 illustrates the results of automatic extraction.

Agentive 112
Telic 762
Constitutive 481

Table 1: Number of Qualia found in SUMO using automatic extraction

5.2 Evaluation

In order to evaluate the automatically extracted qualia relations from SUMO, we designed an on-line
annotation system, where we asked the annotators to decide whether the automatically extracted quale
relation was reasonable or unreasonable, or indicate if they’re not sure. We also had a comment box
for each entry, and asked the annotators to provide comments. For instance, for the telic quale, our
instruction for commenting was as follows:
If you feel the given function is reasonable but it’s not at all how you would phrase or describe the
function, then please provide your own description/phrasing of the function in the comment box.
You can also use to comment box to suggest a function for the unreasonable cases.
If you’re unsure, comment on what makes you unsure.
In collecting such comments in addition to the reasonable judgments, we hope to gain insights into better
alternatives for the quale relation.

We also provided SUMO documentation for the entity in question for cases where the annotator might
not be familiar with the entity. The need for this was revealed in our pilot testing of the annotation
system, where one of the annotators had not heard of some entities such as Lanai, which according
to SUMO “refers to a roofed outdoor area Adjacent to a Building often furnished and used as a living
room.” So we decided to include SUMO documentation for each entity just in case the annotators are
not familiar with it. Figure 2 shows a sample entry in our evaluation system.

Figure 2: A sample entry in the evaluation system, asking about the telic quale.

To ensure that the annotators are not judging haphazardly and without thinking, we inserted 3 random
attention tests in each page of annotation. The attention tests were completely unreasonable possibilities,
in which the extracted function for one entity was paired with a totally different entity (e.g., Entity:
AerobicExerciseDevice, Telic: to attach one thing to something else). So in each page, we had 25 real
tasks and 3 attention tests. Examining the accuracy of each annotator, we had to throw out the data from



2649

one of them with only 73% accuracy on the attention tasks; those tasks were re-annotated by another
annotator.

It would be prohibitively difficult to have a measure of recall for this task of automatic extraction,
so we limit our evaluation to the precision of the results, using human annotators’ judgments as the
gold standard. Table 2 shows the precision measures found. The average interannotator agreement was
84.13%.

Agentive Telic Constitutive
Reasonable 93% 88.26 85.89%
Unreasonable 2% 7.87% 10.74%
Unsure 5% 3.87% 3.37%

Table 2: Precision of Qualia Relations Extracted from SUMO

5.3 Error Analysis

The ‘unreasonable’ judgment for the constitutive relation was mostly applied to the ones taken from
SUMO axioms, where the constitutive relation was too general for our purposes. For instance, the
extraction found Object as a component part of WireCoil, and Physical as what constitutes
Solenoid. Despite being true, they’re too general to be accepted by a human as a reasonable part-whole
relation. Another reason for marking the extracted constitutive relation as unreasonable was the jargon
used in particular professions with which an annotators was not familiar, such as biology or chemistry.
For instance, an AtomicGroup is part of a Molecule, but it’s been marked as unreasonable with the
comment: “part whole switch.” Some other errors were due to an ordering mistake in SUMO axioms,
such as (part Penne Hole) (which means Penne is part of Hole), whereas the reverse is true. Still others
were due to a bug in the extraction, which ignored negation in axioms when finding constitutive relations,
such as BloodTypeB which does NOT contain AntigenA according to SUMO axioms. We extracted
it as a part by ignoring the negation. Thus, the results of the annotation were illuminating: helping to
pinpoint where SUMO is too general for our purposes, or where our extraction script needs refinement.

The unreasonable judgments for the telic quale were mostly due to not yet capturing and combining
inherited relations from SUMO. At any particular node, SUMO underspecifies the definition because it
assumes inheritance from ancestor nodes. Although we assume this as well, the qualia relations we have
extracted are limited to the ones found with direct mentioning of that entity. For instance, for the entity
MilitaryVehicle, the telic role extracted was “MilitaryOrganization uses it,” which was marked
as unreasonable with the suggested alternative “Provide transportation for any military organization.”
However, MilitaryVehicle has Vehicle as its parent and inherits from it. Therefore, the telic
quale for Vehicle, which is extracted as “Translocation,” would be inherited by MilitaryVehicle.

This sort of error confirms our plan to inherit qualia relations and add the quale for each entity to all
its children. Not only will these types of errors be eliminated, the number of entities with qualia relations
will increase significantly. Currently, many lower level entities have no specific qualia to be extracted at
their SUMO node but have very informative quale that could be inherited from parent nodes. Thus, we
would have a significant increase in coverage (recall), while precision is guaranteed to remain high.

Yet other instances of unreasonable telic quale were due to the wording used in SUMO. For instance,
the following pairs have been judged as unreasonable.
Entity: HearingProtection – Function: protect Human from Injuring caused by RadiatingSound
Entity: PerformanceStage – Function: location of Demonstrating
Entity: Campground – Function: to have MobileResidences
These may not be how a human would describe the functions, but SUMO has tried to maximize the
grounding of its definitions by using its other defined entities within them, leading to a more intercon-
nected network of concepts. Demonstrating, for instance, is not the word people use to talk about the
function of a performance stage, but according to the documentation of Demonstrating in SUMO, it
would cover ‘software demos, theatrical plays, lectures, dance and music recitals, museum exhibitions,



2650

etc.’ Given the connection of REO concepts to SUMO, we need not be overly concerned about these
types of seemingly inaccurate results.

6 Incorporating Qualia Relations into REO

6.1 Expanding REO Endurants
As an ontology meant to provide a shared vocabulary of SRL annotation resources, the development
of REO has focused on how to structure ontological relations between the events and states included
in these resources (ACE, ERE, VerbNet, FrameNet). Although our intention has never been to create a
detailed ontology of the entities that serve as the participants in these events/states, such information is
needed to generalize and map this information across resources, as well as provide some insights into
selectional restrictions generally and qualia relations specifically. Thus, we opted to integrate REO with
an existing ontology containing the type of information on participants that we were interested in.

Given the detailed information on objects and accompanying information such as hasPurpose in
SUMO, we decided that it was best suited to our needs. REO aligns with early distinctions made by
DOLCE, distinguishing between ENDURANT Entities and PERDURANT Entities, where ENDURANTS
are defined as “Those entities that can be observed/perceived as a complete concept, no matter which
given snapshot of time,” whereas PERDURANTS are defined as “Those entities for which only a part
exists if we look at them at any given snapshot in time. Variously called events, processes, phenomena,
or activities and states, PERDURANTS have temporal parts or spatial parts and participants.” PERDU-
RANTS largely map to what SUMO deems Processes, and although many ENDURANTS map to what
SUMO deems Objects, there were also a variety of useful concepts in SUMO that seemed to fit the
definition of an ENDURANT. These include: ContentBearingPhysical, FinancialAsset,
Graph, GraphElement, Model, PhysicalSystem, Quantity, and SetOrClass. To
flesh out the ENDURANT portion of REO, we opted to integrate all daughters of Object and the classes
just mentioned as daughters of our ENDURANT class. Specifically, this was done in a linking model,
similar to the linking models that serve to map the generic event concepts in REO’s ‘Reference Model’
to particular groups of events in the SRL resource models (see Brown et al. (2017) for more details on the
structure of REO). The linking model imports an abbreviated OWL version of SUMO (containing only
the ENDURANT-compatible classes mentioned, their documentation that provides a description of what
they are, and their associated WordNet sense keys), and the REO OWL reference model. The resulting
model has all of the REO event ontology nested under PERDURANT, and the extracted SUMO content
nested under ENDURANT (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: REO-SUMO Linking Model: This model imports the abbreviated SUMO model (containing
ENDURANT-type classes only) and the REO reference model. Thus, REO specifies the PERDURANTS
of the model, while SUMO specifies the ENDURANTS.

Admittedly, there are a variety of weaknesses to this model. A model that used all of SUMO would
contain the many axioms found in the full version of SUMO, which OWL is not expressive enough



2651

to handle (mathematically a description logic cannot state the content of first order logic, much less in
this case, higher order logic). These axioms facilitate some of the rich reasoning potential of SUMO,
which is lost in our more superficial model. We are therefore considering new ways in which to integrate
the lexical resource information included in REO into the full SUMO model, enabling users to take
advantage of SUMO with respect to reasoning about events included in the SRL annotations in the
future.

6.2 Initial Integration of Qualia Relations
As a preliminary step in incorporating the extracted qualia relations into our ontology, we have simply
added the information as annotations on the ENDURANTS drawn from the abbreviated SUMO model.
We have introduced the following annotation properties: has Quale Agentive, has Quale Constitutive,
and has Quale Telic. We do not include an explicit relation for the Formal quale, as we assume this infor-
mation is encoded in the ontological structure itself. A variety of examples of these qualia incorporated
are given in Table 1.

Endurant has Quale... Concept
Brake Telic Decelerating
Building Constitutive Wall
Organization Agentive Founding

Table 3: Examples of has Quale annotations of Endurant entities.

More general parent classes lack cohesive qualia. In fact, almost none of the nine direct daughters
of ENDURANT (e.g., Object, PhysicalSystem, Model, etc.) have qualia annotations, but the
daughters of these classes (and subclasses therein) are increasingly populated with qualia annotations,
reflecting their increasing specificity.

In future work, we will incorporate the extracted qualia relation information (along with the com-
ments acquired through annotators applied to them) into the REO/SUMO Linking Model using object
properties (as opposed to the current annotation properties). These object properties will relate SUMO
ENDURANTS to either REO PERDURANTS or other SUMO ENDURANTS, depending upon the relation,
such that the ontology can be exploited for telic, agentive, formal, and constitutive qualia, as well as
the events in which an endurant is typically involved. For example: Meal (ENDURANT extracted from
SUMO) has Quale Telic CONSUMPTION (PERDURANT from REO). Unlike the annotation properties
currently implemented, the object properties will better facilitate querying and reasoning using the on-
tology, and will effectively map the concepts extracted from SUMO (e.g., an extracted telic quale for
meal is ‘contains nutrients for humans’) to the event classes in REO (labeled CONSUMPTION). We plan
to do this mapping manually using a group of expert annotators who are familiar with the ontology and
the linked lexical resources.

In addition, we plan to augment ongoing research evaluating the utility of REO in scene understanding
in images and video (Tahmoush and Bonial, 2016). Specifically, we will be exploring how the infor-
mation relating ENDURANTS and PERDURANTS for a given event type might be leveraged in putting
together the pieces relating objects recognized in an image to higher-order scene understanding and per-
haps even activity recognition. This is inspired in part by work on “visual semantic role labeling” using
FrameNet for situation understanding (Yatskar et al., 2016), but we expect to exploit the more general
qualia information to understand, for example, what type of room is encountered if a bed is recognized,
versus a tooth brush, based on what we know about how those objects are typically used.

7 Conclusion

An understanding of events is not complete without understanding their participants. Similarly, an under-
standing of objects is incomplete without some knowledge of what events they are typically associated
with. We have described efforts to extract GL qualia relations using a novel methodology exploiting
particular information from SUMO relations and documentation. Our evaluation shows that the vast



2652

majority of the automatically extracted relations are judged reasonable by human annotators. Our mo-
tivation has been to enrich REO with origin, function and part-whole information in the form of GL
qualia relations. To lay the groundwork for this effort, we have first integrated REO with ENDURANTS
drawn from carefully selected SUMO classes. We have completed an initial integration of the extracted
qualia relation information as annotations in the updated REO. This version of the ontology will be made
freely available, as will subsequent versions of the ontology that incorporate the qualia relations as object
properties.
