Abstract

Online adspaces require the seller/buyer
to select a category to post their adver-
tisements. This practice not only causes
hindrance to legitimate users while post-
ing their advertisements, but, also deter
the user experience as they will see a lot
of non-categorized ads due to human er-
ror or spam. Classifying advertisements
posted on an online adspace can help in
spam detection, better information propa-
gation which in turn enhances user experi-
ence.

Craigslist is a prevalent platform for lo-
cal classified advertisements. In this
paper, we present a classification sys-
tem for an online advertisement space
such as Craigslist. We show the perfor-
mance of our algorithm with three stan-
dard classifiers, viz., Support Vector Ma-
chine, Random Forest, and Multinomial
Naive Bayes. An accuracy of 84% was
achieved with the SVM.

1 Introduction

With the advent of online adspaces, there are sev-
eral hundred advertisements that get posted every
second and such an influx of unstructured infor-
mation is a rich source of data. Classification of
advertisements into categories based on the text of
the advertisement, a simple but rather useful tech-
nique is presented in this paper along with its im-
plications.

Craigslist is an online place with local classi-
fieds and forums which are community moder-
ated, and largely free, on commodities like jobs,
housing, goods, services, romance, local activities,
advice, etc. There are different sub-domains of
Craigslist, for each country they operate in. Each
country has listings organized by sections which

users Countries posts/month
Craigslist 500M+ 70+ 80M+

Ebay 300M+ 40 50M+

are then further subdivided into categories. We
chose Craigslist as they have made some of their
data publicly available is one of the largest on-
line adspaces currently operating as shown by the
statistics in the table below. However, this method
can be applied to any online adpsace.

As the table indicates, Craigslist is a more data
rich source of advertisements. One reason for this
is that Craigslist doesn’t limit itself to goods only
whereas other e-commerce websites do.

We use supervised learning techniques to clas-
sify a Craigslist post into different categories. We
use text mining techniques like text normaliza-
tion(Sproat et al., 2001) and term frequency in-
verse document frequency for preparing the data
for classification. We tested several classification
techniques and tabulated the results obtained us-
ing various assessment methods. SVM(Joachims,
1998) with a linear kernel yields the best result
with an accuracy of 84% on the test data.

An online adspace such as Craigslist could use
a recommender system that predicts the category
under which the post must be filed while a user
is posting an advertisement, using our classifier
in an online setting. This sort of recommendation
system is a very nifty way of improving the user
experience for a site which sees on an average an
excess of 80 million advertisements posted per
month.

Our Contribution: We propose a classifier
wherein, when a user is posting an advertisement
on an online adspace such as Craigslist, a recom-20



mendation is made to the user to select the cate-
gory for the advertisement to be displayed in. In
the case that the user doesn’t select it, the post will
be displayed in the predicted category by default.

2 Motivation

Recommendations can be made in an online set-
ting wherein the text from the description of the
advertisement is used to create feature vectors and
fed into a classifier which predicts the category
of the post. Based on this categorization, a rec-
ommendation is made to the user. This elemen-
tary step reduces the work of the user having to
manually select the category to post his/her adver-
tisement to. The category predicted can also be
helpful in preventing the user from spamming the
adspace by placing totally irrelevant ads to a par-
ticular category. This in turn enhances the user
experience of the people browsing the advertise-
ments listed.

Specifically, given the city, section and heading
of a Craigslist post, we have to predict the category
under which it should be posted.

3 Related Work

To our knowledge, there has been no work done in
detecting spam (wrongly located advertisements)
on online advertisement spaces. However, there
has been some work in prediction of the price of
an object using the title and the textual description
of the advertisement by fitting a Naive Bayes clas-
sifier. (Elridge)

We chose to build such a classifier on Craigslist
data as Fuxman et al. (Fuxman et al., 2009) have
showed Craigslist to be a data source to improve
classification accuracy in cases where a simple al-
gorithm can outperform a sophisticated algorithm
if it is provided with more training data.

4 Data

The dataset is a subset of the data generated on the
Craigslist sites for a set of sixteen different cities
(such as New York, Mumbai, etc.). The dataset
has records from four sections forsale, housing,
community and services and a total of sixteen cat-
egories from those sections. The categories are:
activities, appliances, artists, automotive, cell-
phones, childcare, general, household-services,
housing, photography, real-estate, shared, tem-
porary, therapeutic, video-games and wanted-

housing. Each category belongs to only one sec-
tion. This data was made publicly available.

The first line in the dataset is an integer N. N
lines follow, each line being a valid JSON object.
The following fields of raw data, given in JSON:

• city (string, ASCII) : The city for which this
Craigslist post was made

• section (string, ASCII) : for-sale / housing /
community / services

• heading (string, UTF-8) : The heading of the
post

A sample record looks as follows:

{“city”: “singapore”, “section”: “for-
sale”, “heading”: “Panasonic ,2doors
fridge(238L)($220 with delivery+1mth war-
ranty)”}

A total of approximately 20,000 records were
made available, proportionally represented across
these sections, categories and cities. The format
of training data is the same as input format but
with an additional field category, the category in
which the post was made. A separate test dataset
of 15,370 records was also provided, which we
have used to test our final model on.

5 Experimental Setup

In our work, we have used scikit-learn(Pedregosa
et al., 2011) (formerly scikits.learn) which is
an open source machine learning library for the
Python programming language. It features vari-
ous classification, regression and clustering algo-
rithms such as support vector machines, logistic
regression, naive Bayes, random forests, gradient
boosting, kmeans clustering and DBSCAN, etc. It
is designed to interoperate with the Python numer-
ical and scientific library SciPy (Jones et al., 2001
).

5.1 Preprocessing of Data

Most category based ads have similar words. For
example, words like BHK, wooden flooring, etc
occur in house advertisements; MB, GB, camera,
appear in cellphone advertisements.
One major feature of advertisements which are
usually considered spam is the presence of lot
of special characters. Most spam advertisements21

have several special characters more than legiti-
mate advertisements.

Feature generation: We remove all the special
characters from the data as these arent really
helpful from a lexical perspective, but use the
count of these characters as a feature.

Normalization: We treat all numbers that
occur equally as these usually represent the price
or quantity of the product, which doesnt really
help us decide the category of an advertisement.
We normalize it by using the word numbr for any
digit or number that occurs.

5.2 Creation of Classifier

The preprocessed data is then used to the create
feature matrix. We use the bag of words model
and then apply tf-idf (Salton and Yang, 1973) to
generate feature vectors for each advertisement.

The feature matrix is sent to the classifier whose
parameters have been optimized by the Grid-
SearchCV module present in sklearn.(Pedregosa
et al., 2011)

6 Evaluations and Results

Baseline results: The baseline results are calcu-
lated with the default/standard classifiers with no
parameter optimizations done. The scores are av-
eraged over 3-fold cross validation.

Results: After tweaking the parameters of
the classifier using GridSearchCV our results im-
proved and have been listed in Table 3.

From the confusion matrix, it is evident that the
class labelled “therapeutic” was the best classi-
fied class with more than 1400 of the 1600 data
points being correctly classified as “therapeutic”.

Figure 1: Confusion Matrix

This is an important result as it is well known that
advertisements which fall under this category are
most likely spam when found in other categories.
Hence, classification on the text of the advertise-
ment can help detect spam and block it out. We
can also note for example, appliances get confused
with cell phones and video games which is an in-
teresting finding since the two are semantically
closer than, say, housing.

Another stark importance of such a system is
the amount of man hours saved. With 80M posts
coming in every month, let us say a user spends
about 30 seconds selecting the section and cate-
gory of the advertisement. That is approximately a
whopping 666,000+ man hours saved each month.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a classifier for on-
line adspaces, which classifies an advertisement
amongst 16 categories. If an advertisement is ac-
curately classified in its correct class, it helps in-
crease the reach of the advertisement as it is dis-
played to the people looking in the particular sec-
tion and is not classified as spam. In this work,22



we have used the Craigslist data which is publicly
available, and, very rich in terms of categories and
datapoints. Our classifier secures an mean accu-
racy of 84% when tested using cross-validation.

8 Future Work

We look to improve this work in two ways. First,
we would like to expand the current classifier to be
a multi-class classifier. This would help classify
ads which can belong to more than one category,
thereby it would result in the advertisement being
displayed in more than one category and hence
reach more “prospective” buyers. As an alterna-
tive, it would be interesting to treat this as a multi-
label classification problem, wherein each item
can be labelled with more than one category. This
allows us to tag each advertisement with classes
which are related.

Secondly, we would want to explore and im-
plement better feature engineering. The section-
category tags of posts follow a hierarchy. Be-
ing able to incorporate this hierarchy as features
would, we believe, significantly improve our fea-
ture vectors. Using such a classifier in setting
where advertisements can comprise a code-mixed
dataset like on Indian online adspaces such as Olx,
Junglee, etc., can will benefit from learning fea-
tures from such data.
