Abstract

Downstream processing of machine trans-
lation (MT) output promises to be a so-
lution to improve translation quality, es-
pecially when the MT system’s internal
decoding process is not accessible. Both
rule-based and statistical automatic post-
editing (APE) methods have been pro-
posed over the years, but with contrast-
ing results. A missing aspect in previous
evaluations is the assessment of different
methods: i) under comparable conditions,
and ii) on different language pairs featur-
ing variable levels of MT quality. Fo-
cusing on statistical APE methods (more
portable across languages), we propose
the first systematic analysis of two ap-
proaches. To understand their potential,
we compare them in the same conditions
over six language pairs having English
as source. Our results evidence consis-
tent improvements on all language pairs,
a relation between the extent of the gain
and MT output quality, slight but statis-
tically significant performance differences
between the two methods, and their possi-
ble complementarity.

1 Introduction

Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct sys-
tematic machine translation (MT) errors. The
problem is appealing for several reasons. On one
side, as pointed out by Parton et al. (2012), APE
systems can improve MT output by exploiting in-
formation unavailable to the decoder, or by per-
forming deeper text analysis that is too expensive
at decoding stage. On the other side, and to our
view more importantly, APE represents the only
way to recover errors produced in “black-box”
conditions in which the MT system is unknown
or its internal decoding process is not accessible.

The task, firstly proposed by Knight and Chan-
der (1994) to cope with article selection in
Japanese to English translation, has been later ad-
dressed in various ways. On one side, rule-based
methods (Rosa et al., 2012) gained limited atten-
tion, probably due to the extensive manual work
they involve and their scarce portability across lan-
guages. On the other side, the statistical approach
proposed by Allen and Hogan (2000) reached ma-
turity in the work by Simard et al. (2007) and in-
spired a number of further investigations (Isabelle
et al., 2007; Dugast et al., 2007; Dugast et al.,
2009; Lagarda et al., 2009; Béchara et al., 2011;
Béchara et al., 2012; Rubino et al., 2012; Rosa et
al., 2013; Lagarda et al., 2014, inter alia).

Such prior works address orthogonal aspects
like: i) performance variations when APE is ap-
plied to correct the output of rule-based vs. statis-
tical MT, ii) the use of APE for error correction
vs. domain adaptation, iii) the difference between
training on general domain vs. domain-specific
data, iv) performance variations when learning
from reference translations vs. human post-edits.
Their common trait is that the reported results are
difficult to generalise. Indeed, most of the works
focus on evaluating a specific method,1 which is
typically applied to one single dataset for a given
language pair. As a result, the global landscape of
the “planet of the APEs” is still blurred and open
to more systematic explorations.

To shed light on the potential of statistical post-
editing, in this paper we examine two alterna-
tive approaches. One is the method proposed in
(Simard et al., 2007), which to date is the most
widely used. The other is the “context-aware” so-
lution proposed in (Béchara et al., 2011) which,
to the best of our knowledge, represents the most
significant variant of (Simard et al., 2007).

The major contribution of our work is the first
systematic analysis of different APE approaches,

which are tested in controlled conditions over sev-
eral language pairs. To ensure the soundness of
the analysis, our experimental setup consists of
a dataset composed of the same English source
sentences with automatic translations into six lan-
guages and respective manual post-edits by pro-
fessional translators. Overall, this represents the
ideal condition to complement prior research with
the missing answers to questions like:

Q1: Does APE yield consistent MT quality im-
provements across different language pairs?

Q2: What is the relation between the original
MT output quality and the APE results?

Q3: Which of the two analysed APE methods
has the highest potential?

2 Statistical APE methods

The two methods we analyse follow the same “sta-
tistical phrase-based post-editing” strategy out-
lined by Simard et al. (2007), but differ in the way
data is represented. Let’s give them a closer look.

2.1 Method 1 (Simard et al., 2007)

The underlying idea is that APE components can
be trained in the same way in which statistical MT
systems are developed – i.e. starting from “paral-
lel data”. Since the goal is to transform rough MT
output into its correct version, parallel data con-
sists of MT output as source texts and correct (hu-
man quality) sentences as target. In (Simard et al.,
2007) these are used to train a phrase-based MT
system, which is then applied to correct the output
of a commercial rule-based MT system.

Positive evaluation results are reported on
English-French, and even better ones on French-
English data. In both cases, statistical APE yields
significant BLEU and TER improvements over the
original MT output. However, since training and
test data for the two language directions are dif-
ferent (in content and size), the measured perfor-
mance variations cannot be directly ascribed to the
effectiveness of the method in the two settings.

2.2 Method 2 (Béchara et al., 2011)

One limitation of the “monolingual translation”
approach proposed in (Simard et al., 2007) is that
the basic statistical APE pipeline is only trained on
data in the target language (F), disregarding infor-
mation about the source language (E): Correction

rules learned from (f ′, f ) pairs2 lose the connec-
tion between the translated words (or phrases) and
the corresponding source terms (e). This implies
that information lost or distorted in the translation
process is out of the reach of the APE component,
and the resulting errors are impossible to recover.

To cope with this issue, Béchara et al. (2011)
propose a “context-aware” variant to represent
the data. For each word f ′, the corresponding
source word (or phrase) e is identified through
word alignment and used to obtain a joint rep-
resentation f ′#e. The result is an intermediate
language F ′#E that represents the new source
side of the parallel data used to train the statis-
tical APE component. Though in principle more
precise, this method can be affected by two prob-
lems. First, preserving the source context comes
at the cost of a larger vocabulary size and, con-
sequently, higher data sparseness. While the ba-
sic statistical APE pipeline combines and exploits
the counts of all the co-occurrences of f ′ and f
in the parallel data, its context-aware variant con-
siders each f ′#ei as a separate term, thus break-
ing down the co-occurrence counts of f ′ and f
into smaller numbers. Second, all these counts can
be influenced by word alignment errors. To cope
with data sparseness and unreliable word align-
ment, Béchara et al. (2011) experiment with differ-
ent thresholds set on word alignment strengths to
filter context information. In particular, they dis-
card the (f ′#e, f ) pairs in which the f ′#e align-
ment score is smaller than the threshold.

The approach, applied to correct the output of a
statistical phrase-based MT system, achieves am-
biguous evaluation results. On French-English,
significant improvements up to 2 BLEU points
are observed both over the baseline (the original
MT output) and the basic method of Simard et
al. (2007). On English-French, however, perfor-
mance slightly drops. Moreover, follow-up exper-
iments with the same method (Béchara, 2014) did
not confirm these results. In light of these ambigu-
ous results and the lack of a systematic compari-
son between the two APE methods, our objective is
to replicate them3 for a fair comparison in a con-
trolled evaluation setting involving different lan-

guage pairs.

2.3 Reimplementing the two methods

To obtain the statistical APE pipeline that repre-
sents the backbone of both methods we used a
phrase-based Moses system (Koehn et al., 2007).
Our training data (see Section 3) consists of
(source, MT output, post-edition) triplets for six
language pairs having English as source. While
Method 1 uses only the last two elements of the
triplet, all of them play a role in the context-aware
Method 2. Apart from the different data represen-
tation, the training process is identical.

Translation and reordering models were esti-
mated following the Moses protocol with default
setup using MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) for
word alignment.4 For language modeling we used
the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011) for standard
n-gram modeling with an n-gram length of 5. The
APE system for each target language was tuned
on comparable development sets (see below), op-
timizing TER with Minimum Error Rate Training
(Och, 2003) using the post-edited sentences as ref-
erences.

3 Experiments

Some lessons learned from prior works on sta-
tistical APE methods (Béchara, 2014) include:
i) learning from human post-edits is more effec-
tive than learning from (independent) reference
translations, ii) learning from (and applying APE
to) domain-specific data is more promising than
working on general-domain data, iii) correcting
the output of rule-based MT systems is easier than
improving translations from statistical MT. Our
work capitalizes on these findings (we learn from
domain-specific post-edited data and apply APE to
statistical MT), but fills a gap of previous research:
a fair comparative study between different meth-
ods in controlled conditions. The key enabling
factor is the availability, for the first time, of data
consisting of the same source sentences, machine-
translated in several languages and post-edited by
professional translators.

Data. We experiment with the Autodesk Post-
Editing Data corpus,5 which predominantly cov-
ers the domain of software user manuals. English

sentences are translated into several languages
(30K to 410K translations per language) with Au-
todesk’s in-house MT system (Zhechev, 2012) and
post-edited by professional translators.

Our experiments are run on six language pairs
having English as source and Czech, German,
Spanish, French, Italian and Polish as target. To
set up our controlled environment, we extract all
the (source, MT output, post-edition) triplets shar-
ing the same source (En) sentences across all lan-
guage pairs. Table 1 provides some statistics about
the resulting tri-parallel corpora. After random
shuffling the triplets, we create training (12.2K
triplets), development (2K) and test data (2K)
sharing exactly the same source sentences across
languages. Training and evaluation of our APE
systems are performed on true-case data.

To guarantee similar experimental conditions in
the six language settings, we also train compara-
ble target language models from external data (in-
deed, the 12.2K post-edits would not be enough
to train reliable LMs). We build our LMs from
approximately 2.5M translations of the same En-
glish sentences collected from Europarl (Koehn,
2005), DGT-Translation Memory (Steinberger et
al., 2012), JRC Acquis (Steinberger et al., 2006),
OPUS IT (Tiedemann, ) and other Autodesk data
common to all languages.

Evaluation metric. We evaluate the APE meth-
ods based on their capability to reduce the distance
between the MT output and a correct (fluent and
adequate) translation. As a measure of the amount
of the editing operations needed for the correction,
TER and HTER (Snover et al., 2006) fit for our
purpose. TER and HTER measure the minimum
edit distance between the MT output and its cor-

rect version.6 This can be either a reference trans-
lation created independently from the MT out-
put (TER) or a human post-edition obtained by
manually correcting the MT output (HTER). For
the sake of simplicity, henceforth we will use the
term TER to refer to both situations (though, when
measuring the distance between the MT output
and its human post-edition the actual metric is the
HTER).

Baseline. Similar to all previous works on APE,
our baseline is the MT output as is. Hence, base-
line scores for each language pair correspond to
the TER computed between the original MT out-
put (produced by the “black-box” Autodesk in-
house system) and the human post-edits.

4 Results

Table 2 lists our results, with language pairs or-
dered according to the respective baseline TER.
The positive answer to Q1 (“Does APE yield con-
sistent improvements to MT output?”) is evident:
both APE methods consistently improve MT qual-
ity on all language pairs. TER reductions range
from 3.06 to 5.27 points. Quality improvements
are statistically significant at p < 0.05, measured
by bootstrap test (Koehn, 2004).

In answer to Q2 (“What is the relation between
original MT quality and APE results?”), our con-
trolled experiments evidence for the first time in
APE research that the higher the MT quality, the
higher is the improvement, i.e. percentage of er-
ror reduction, yielded by the APE methods. On
one side, this interesting result may seem counter-
intuitive because a larger room for improvement

insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) divided by
the number of words in the correct translation. Lower
TER/HTER values indicate better MT quality.

is expected for sentences of poor quality. On the
other side, it reveals that learning from (and cor-
recting) noisy data affected by many errors is par-
ticularly difficult for statistical APE methods. This
finding is violated by En-Fr, for which a reason-
ably good MT quality does not induce a gain in
performance comparable to language pairs featur-
ing similar MT TER (En-It and En-Es). On fur-
ther analysis of the data, we notice that all the tar-
get languages except French keep a coherent be-
haviour with respect to the domain-specific En-
glish terms, which are always either preserved (It)
or translated (other languages). Instead, French
shows an alternation between the two conducts.
One example is the English word “workflow”,
which appears in the French post-editions both as
is (21 sentences) and translated into “flux de tra-
vail” (34 sentences). In contrast, in the other lan-
guage directions all the occurrences of ‘workflow”
are either translated or kept in English. These fre-
quent ambiguities are difficult to manage (espe-
cially if the two forms occur a similar number of
times in the training data), and might motivate the
smaller quality gains observed on En-Fr compared
to the other language pairs.

In answer to Q3 (“Which method has the high-
est potential?”), we observe slight TER reduc-
tions when moving from Method 1 to its “context-
aware” variant.7 Although small (from 0.19 to
0.49 TER points), such gains are statistically sig-
nificant (p < 0.05), except for En-Fr (p < 0.07).
This suggests that linking the MT words to the
source terms can help to recover adequacy errors
that are out of the reach of Method 1.

To better understand to what extent the two
methods behave differently, we calculated the re-
sults of an Oracle system, similar to the one pro-

tween 0.6 and 0.8 leads to the best results for all languages.

posed by Rubino et al. (2012), defined by se-
lecting for each test sentence the best post-edit
(lower TER) produced by two approaches. As
shown in the last column of Table 2, such an ora-
cle achieves a significant TER reduction (from 1.8
to 2.78 points) for all the language pairs. We inter-
pret such gains as clues of a possible complemen-
tarity between the two methods, which is worth to
investigate.

As mentioned in Section 2.2, an advantage of
Method 1 is its robust estimation of translation pa-
rameters. In contrast, by exploiting contextual in-
formation from the source, Method 2 is more pre-
cise but potentially affected by data sparsity issues
due to its highly increased vocabulary. In an at-
tempt to use a less sparse model at the level of
word alignment, we trained a SMT system based
on the context-aware representation of Method 2
(f ′#e), but with word alignment computed on the
representation of Method 1 (f ′). Applying this
method to the three language pairs for which the
two original methods achieved the lowest TER re-
ductions (i.e. En-De, En-Fr and En-Cs) shows that
this simple way to combine Methods 1 and 2 is
able to produce a TER decrement of 0.75 (42.04)
for En-De, 0.60 (38.50) for En-Cs and 0.53 (28.98)
for En-Fr. This seems to validate our intuition
about the possible complementarity of Methods 1
and 2, suggesting a promising direction for future
work.

5 Conclusions

We explored the “planet of the APEs” in ideal
conditions (quantity and quality of data) and
with the right equipment (state-of-the-art meth-
ods). The data available (the same English sen-
tences, machine-translated in six languages and
post-edited by professional translators) allowed us
to compare for the first time different approaches
in a fair setting (our first contribution). The two
methods we analysed allowed us to measure con-
sistent improvements on all language pairs (TER
reductions from 7.3% to 14.7% – second contri-
bution), and to observe interesting relations be-
tween the extent of the gain and the original MT
output quality (the higher the quality, the higher
the gain yield by APE – third contribution). This
first study represents a good starting point for fu-
ture quests. A promising direction to explore is the
possible complementarity between the two meth-
ods and the room for mutual improvement. Now

we just have a glimpse of the path (higher ora-
cle results, slight gains with a first combination
method – fourth contribution), but positive prelim-
inary results confirm its existence.

iments by other researchers and the reuse of
