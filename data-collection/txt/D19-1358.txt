Abstract

We propose a simple yet effective approach for
improving Korean word representations using
additional linguistic annotation (i.e. Hanja).
We employ cross-lingual transfer learning in
training word representations by leveraging
the fact that Hanja is closely related to Chi-
nese. We evaluate the intrinsic quality of rep-
resentations learned through our approach us-
ing the word analogy and similarity tests. In
addition, we demonstrate their effectiveness
on several downstream tasks, including a novel
Korean news headline generation task.

1 Introduction

There is a strong connection between the Korean
and Chinese languages due to cultural and histori-
cal reasons (Lee and Ramsey, 2011). Specifically,
a set of logograms with very similar forms to the
Chinese characters, called Hanja1, served in the
past as the only medium for written Korean until
Hangul, the Korean alphabet, and Jamo came into
existence in 1443 (Sohn, 2001). Considering this
etymological background, a substantial portion of
Korean words are classified as Sino-Korean, a set
of Korean words that had originated from Chinese
and can be expressed in both Hanja and Hangul
(Taylor, 1997), with the latter becoming common-
place in modern Korean.

Based on these facts, we assume the introduc-
tion of Hanja-level information will aid in ground-
ing better representation for the meaning of Ko-
rean words (e.g. see Fig. 1). To validate our
hypothesis, we propose a simple yet effective ap-
proach to training Korean word representations,
named Hanja-level SISG (Hanja-level Subword

1Hanja and traditional Chinese characters are very similar

but not completely identical. Some differences in strokes and
language-exclusive characters exist.

form and multi-level meanings. The Sino-Korean word

gograms (HJ). Although annotation of Hanja is op-
tional, it offers deeper insight into the word meaning
due to its association with the Chinese characters (CN).

Information Skip-Gram), for capturing the seman-
tics of Hanja and subword structures of Korean
and introducing them into the vector space. Note
that it is also quite intuitive for native Koreans
to resolve the ambiguity of (Sino-)Korean words
with the aid of Hanja. We conjecture this heuris-
tic is attributed to the fact that Hanja characters
are logograms, each of which contains more lex-
ical meaning when compared against its counter-
part, the Hangul character, which is a phonogram.
Accordingly, in this work, we focus on exploiting
the rich extra information from Hanja as a means
of constructing better Korean word embeddings.
Furthermore, our approach enables us to empir-
ically investigate the potential of character-level
cross-lingual knowledge transfer with a case study
of Chinese and Hanja.

To sum up, our contributions are threefold:

• We introduce a novel way of training Korean
word embeddings with an expanded Korean
alphabet vocabulary using Hanja in addition
to the existing Korean characters, Hangul.

• We also explore the possibility of character-



3529

level knowledge transfer between two lan-
guages by initializing Hanja embeddings
with Chinese character embeddings before
training skip-gram.

• We prove the effectiveness of our method in
two ways, one of which is intrinsic evaluation
(the word analogy and similarity tests), and
the other being two downstream tasks includ-
ing a newly proposed Korean news headline
generation task.

2 Model Description

2.1 Skip-Gram (SG)
Given a corpus as a sequence of words
(w1, w2, . . . , wT ), the goal of a skip-gram model
(Mikolov et al., 2013) is to maximize the log-
probabilities of context words given a target word
wi: ∑

i∈{1,...,T}

∑
c∈C(i)

log p (wc|wi), (1)

where C returns a set of context word indices given
a word index. The usual choice for training the
parameterized probability function p (wc|w) is to
reframe the problem as a set of binary classifica-
tion tasks of the target context word c and other
negative samples chosen from the entire dictionary
(negative sampling). The objective is thus

L (s (wi, wc)) +
∑

j∈N (i,c)
L (−s (wi, wj)) , (2)

where L (x) = log (1 + e−x), the binary logis-
tic loss. N returns a set of negative sample in-
dices given target word and context indices. In the
vanilla SG model, the scoring function s is the dot
product between the two word vectors: vw and vc.

2.2 Subword Information SG (SISG) and
Jamo-level SISG

In Bojanowski et al. (2017), the scoring func-
tion incorporates subword information. Specifi-
cally, given all possible n-gram character sets G =
{g1, . . . , gG} in the corpus and that the n-gram set
of a particular word w is Gw ⊂ G, the scoring
function is thus the sum of dot products between
all n-gram vectors z and the context vector vc:

s (w, c) =
∑
g∈Gw

zgvc. (3)

However, due to the deconstructible structure
of Korean characters and the agglutinative na-
ture of the language, the model proposed by Bo-
janowski et al. (2017) comes short in capturing
sub-character and inter-character information spe-
cific to Korean understanding. As a remedy, the
model proposed by Park et al. (2018) introduces
jamo-level n-grams g(j), whose vectors can be as-
sociated with the target context as well. Given that
a Korean word w can be split into a set of jamo
n-grams G(j)w ⊂ G(j) =

{
g
(j)
1 , . . . , g

(j)
J

}
, where

G(j) is the set of all possible jamo n-grams in
the corpus, the updated scoring function for jamo-
level skip-gram s(j) is thus

s(j) (w, c) = s (w, c) +
∑

j∈G(j)w

zjvc. (4)

2.3 Hanja-level SISG2

Another semantic level in Korean lies in Hanja
logograms. Hanja characters can be mapped to
Hangul phonograms, hence Hanja annotations are
sufficient but not necessary in conveying mean-
ings (Fig. 1). As each Hanja character is associ-
ated with semantics, their presence could provide
meaningful aid in capturing word-level semantics
in the vector space.

We propose incorporating Hanja n-grams in the
learning of word representations by allowing the
scoring function to associate each Hanja n-gram
with the target context word. Concretely, given
that a Korean word w contains a set of Hanja se-
quences Hw = (hw,1, . . . , hw,Hw) (e.g. for the
example in Fig. 1 hw,1 = “社會” and hw2 = “型”)
and that Ih is the set of Hanja n-grams for a Hanja
sequence h (e.g. Ihw,2 = { “<boh>型”, “型”,
“型<eoh>”}), all Hanja n-grams G(h)w for word
w are the union of Hanja n-grams of Hanja se-
quences present in w:

⋃
h∈Hw Ih. The length of

Hanja n-grams in Ih is a hyperparameter. Then
the new score function for Hanja-level SISG is

s(h) (w, c) = s(j) (w, c) +
∑

h∈G(h)w

zhvc (5)

where zh is the n-gram vector for a Hanja se-
quence h.

2.4 Character-level Knowledge Transfer

Since Hanja characters essentially share deep
roots with Chinese characters, many of them can
be mapped by one-to-one correspondence. By
converting Korean characters into simplified Chi-
nese characters or vice versa, it is possible to uti-
lize pre-trained Chinese embeddings in the pro-
cess of training Hanja-level SISG. In our case, we
propose leveraging advances in Chinese word em-
beddings from the Chinese community by initial-
izing Hanja n-grams vectors zh with the state-of-
the-art Chinese embeddings (Li et al., 2018) and
training with the score function in Equation 5.

3 Experiments

3.1 Word Representation Learning

3.1.1 Korean Corpus
For learning word representations, we utilize the
corpus prepared by Park et al. (2018) with small
modifications. We perform additional data cleans-
ing (e.g. removing non-Korean sentences in the
corpus and unifying number tags) to obtain a
cleaner version of the corpus. All of our compara-
tive studies are based on this corpus. For training
Hanja-level SISG, we use Hanjaro3 tagger to auto-
matically annotate all of our datasets with Hanja.
It is the state-of-the-art Hanja tagger available to
the public to the best of our knowledge.

3.1.2 Models
We compare our approach with three other base-
lines. Skip-Gram (SG) model (Mikolov et al.,
2013) does not incorporate any n-gram informa-
tion in the training loss. Subword Information
Skip-Gram (SISG(c)) (Bojanowski et al., 2017)
uses character-level n-gram information to en-
rich word representations. For the Korean lan-
guage, character-level n-grams correspond to syl-
lable n-grams. Jamo-level SISG (SISG(cj))
(Park et al., 2018) uses jamo-level n-grams in ad-
dition to character-level n-grams. Our ablation
studies confirm that the hyperparameter settings
(character n-grams ranging from 1 to 6 and jamo
n-grams ranging from 3 to 5) proposed by the au-
thors are indeed optimal, hence our subsequent
studies all employ the same settings. Our ap-
proach is denoted by SISG(cjh)). As for the
specific hyperparameter settings of our approach,
SISG(cjh3) denotes Hanja n-grams ranging

predictions and ground truth scores. We observe that
our approach (SISG(cjh)) shows significant improve-
ments in the analogy test but some deterioration in the
similarity test. Note that the evaluation results reported
by the original authors (†) are largely different from
our results. This might be due to differences in imple-
mentation details, hence we report and compare with

n-grams ranging from 1 to 4. SISG(cjhr) is a
special version of our approach, where Hanja n-
grams are randomly initialized as opposed to be-
ing pre-trained (Section 2.4). The details of our
ablation studies and the model implementation are
included in the supplementary material.

3.2 Intrinsic Evaluation
3.2.1 Word Analogy Test
Following the experimental protocol of Park et al.
(2018), given an analogy pair a : b ↔ c : d,
we compute the cosine distance between the word
vectors va + vb − vc and vd using the follow-
ing equation: 1 − cos(x, y), where cos is the co-
sine similarity. The Korean word analogy dataset
(Park et al., 2018) consists of 10,000 quadruples,
designed with a set of semantic and syntactic fea-
tures specific to the Korean. We report our find-
ings in Table 1. We observe that our approach
improves significantly compared to the previous
state-of-the-art models in both semantic and syn-
tactic word analogy detection.

3.2.2 Word Similarity Test
The word similarity test aims to evaluate the
correlation between word vector distances and

human-annotated scores. We use the Korean
WS353 dataset provided by Park et al. (2018).
Our results are shown in Table 1. Although
our approaches do not outperform the jamo-level
baseline (SISG(cj)), we observe that Hanja-
level information provides some advantage com-
pared to just using pure character-level n-grams
(SISG(c)). Also note that WS353 is a relatively
small dataset, which could be prone to statistical
bias.

3.2.3 Analysis

How much of the improvement can be explained
by transfer learning from Chinese? Word anal-
ogy test results show that word representations
trained with pre-trained Chinese n-grams perform
better than those trained without (SISG(cjhr)),
supporting our claim that our approach is able to
transfer relevant knowledge from the Chinese lan-
guage for detecting analogical relationships. How-
ever, for the word similarity test, word vectors
trained without Chinese embeddings perform bet-
ter, suggesting that there are some trade-offs.

3.3 Downstream Tasks

In this section, we try to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our approach to downstream tasks with
two specific cases.

3.3.1 Korean News Headline Generation

To show that our approach helps supervised mod-
els in gaining deeper understanding of Korean
texts, we devise a new task using news articles,
which requires an understanding of the semantics
of Korean texts. We collected Korean news ar-
ticles published from 2017 January to February.
The dataset covers balanced categories (e.g. poli-
tics, sports, world, etc.) and contains the headline
title as the annotation, akin to the CNN/Daily Mail
Dataset (Hermann et al., 2015). The dataset is rel-
atively large - containing 840,205 news article and
title pairs

We use the encoder-decoder architecture sup-
ported by OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) frame-
work for the task, where the encoder is a bidirec-
tional LSTM cell and the decoder is an LSTM cell
(the hidden size is 512 for both) with a bridging
feed-forward layer between the two RNNs. We
employ soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014) to
generate news headlines given the first three sen-
tences of an article body. We tokenize each head-

line using a Korean morpheme tokenizer4 such
that decoder tokens are relatively dense. The
copy mechanism (Gu et al., 2016), a popular tech-
nique of sequence-to-sequence models for trans-
lation and summarization, cannot be applied di-
rectly to our model, as the encoder tokens (space
tokenized) and the decoder tokens (morpheme to-
kenized) do not share the same token space. Word
vectors obtained from both baselines and our ap-
proach are used to initialize the encoder embed-
dings before the training begins. The dataset is
split into training, validation, and test sets (8:1:1).
We report performances on the test set after val-
idating our training models on the validation set.
We evaluate the titles generated by our models
with the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)5. We also
report per-word perplexity obtained from the mod-
els.

As shown in Table 2, models trained with our
embeddings perform better and have better lan-
guage modeling capability than those trained with
the previous state-of-the-art embeddings. This im-
provement can be partially explained by the fact
that formal Korean texts, such as news articles, are
more likely to contain Sino-Korean words, allow-
ing models with awareness of Chinese to gain an
edge in Korean understanding.

3.3.2 Sentiment Analysis
To estimate the performance of our approach on
a different task then the previous experiment, we
conduct an experiment on Naver Sentiment Movie
Corpus (NSMC)6. This dataset consists of 200K
movie reviews, each of which is labeled with its
sentiment, i.e. positive or negative. We split
the corpus into training (100K), validation (50K),
and test sets (50K). It is worth noting that this

with different random seeds.

case study is designed to figure out to what extent
our embeddings are generally applicable for even
cases, where most of the sentences in the dataset
consist of spoken words rather than written words
and often do not contain Sino-Korean words.

We utilize a basic LSTM (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997) module as a sentence encoder
to exclude possible exceptional gains from sophis-
ticated encoders, concentrating on the usefulness
of input word embeddings. Likewise the previ-
ous experiment, word vectors obtained from both
baselines and our approach are used as input for
the encoder. We regard the last hidden state of
the LSTM as the sentence representation, which is
consumed by a feed-forward network followed by
a softmax classifier. The dimension of the LSTM
cells is fixed as 300. Each result from the base-
lines and our models is the average of 3 indepen-
dent runs initialized with different random seeds,
and the outcome of each run is chosen by the per-
formance (F1-score) on the validation set.

From Table 3, we confirm our approach is
comparable to the best previous one and general
enough to be employed in most of the down-
stream tasks, even though the performance of our
approach is somewhat unsatisfactory. While not
strictly proven, we conjecture one possible reason
for the unsatisfying performance is the low relia-
bility of the Hanja tagger we leveraged, which is
not guaranteed to work well with spoken language.
Specifically, we have manually inspected the tag-
ging results and observed that there are some er-
rors which can lead to performance degradation.
This observation points out a limitation of our cur-
rent approach, that is, the dependence on external
taggers, encouraging us to develop an integrated
approach, leaving as future work not resorting to
the taggers.

4 Related Work

Although the word is usually regarded as the
smallest and basic unit for most NLP pipelines,
there is a recent trend of utilizing subword infor-
mation for enriching word representations (Sen-
nrich et al. 2016; Bojanowski et al. 2017, to name
a few), or considering subwords themselves as in-
put directly for NLP models (Zhang et al., 2015;
Kim et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al.,
2018).

As Korean is agglutinative (Song, 2006), the
current literature in Korean word representations
mainly focus on subword structures such as mor-
phemes (Edmiston and Stratos, 2018), syllables
(Choi et al., 2017) and Jamo (Choi et al., 2016;
Stratos, 2017; Park et al., 2018). We here move
forward one step further by incorporating Hanja
information explicitly together with the aforemen-
tioned subword information.

On the other hand, cross-lingual representations
is a trending topic in literature (Lample et al.
2018; Conneau et al. 2018; Lample and Conneau
2019, to name a few). Nevertheless, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to intro-
duce character-level cross-lingual transfer learn-
ing based on etymological grounds. Furthermore,
the novelty of our work lies of the fact that we use
separated vocabulary instead of shared vocabulary
such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al.,
2016).

5 Conclusion

We have presented a method of training Korean
word representations with Hanja. In our exten-
sive experiments, we have demonstrated that our
approach is effective in infusing more semantics
into Korean word embeddings. One potential is-
sue with our method, as already mentioned, is that
it relies on external Hanja annotation, even though
this can be mitigated to some extent by off-the-
shelf taggers, as in this work. Thus, it would be an
attractive direction to take as future work develop-
ing an end-to-end system.
