Abstract

We develop a computational model to dis-
cover the potential causes of depression by
analysing the topics from user-generated
contents. We show the most prominent
causes, and how these causes evolve over
time. Also, we highlight the differences
in causes between students with low and
high neuroticism. Our studies demon-
strate that the topics reveal valuable clues
about the causes contributing to depressed
mood. Identifying causes can have a sig-
nificant impact on improving the quality of
depression care; thereby providing greater
insights into a patient’s state for pertinent
treatment recommendations. Hence, this
study significantly expands the ability to
discover the potential factors that trigger
depression, making it possible to increase
the efficiency of depression treatment.

1 Introduction

Depression is one of the most common mental dis-
orders that can affect people of all ages. It is the
leading cause of disability and requires significant
health care cost to treat effectively (Smith et al.,
2013). Early detection and treatment has a pro-
found impact to encourage remission, and prevent
relapse (Halfin, 2007). However, it is rather com-
mon that the stigma associated with mental illness
makes patients reluctant to seek help, or makes
them tend to answer questions in a manner that
will be viewed favourable by the clinician (Chan-
dra and Minkovitz, 2006). In addition, clinical di-
agnosis depends on the hypothetical or retrospec-
tive self-reports of behaviour, requiring patients
to reflect on what they were doing and thinking
sometime in the past, which may have become ob-
scured over time. Hence, it is difficult for physi-

cians to capture first-hand the patients’ own expe-
riences, an important factor for diagnosis and pro-
viding the most appropriate treatment at the point
of care (Kosinski et al., 2015).

Social media sites provide great venues for peo-
ple to share their experiences, vent emotion and
stress, and seek social support. Therefore, mental
health studies based on social media present sev-
eral advantages (Inkster et al., 2016). For instance,
these digital footprints contain vast amounts of
implicit knowledge, which are useful for medical
practitioners to understand patients’ experiences
outside the controlled clinical environment. In ad-
dition, information captured during clinical con-
sultation generally reflects only the situation of the
patient at the time of care. In contrast, data col-
lected from social media is dynamic, thereby pro-
viding opportunities for observing and recognis-
ing critical changes in patients’ behaviour and per-
mitting certain interventions in real time (Inkster
et al., 2016).

Due to the advantages identified above, social
media and natural language processing techniques
are increasingly used in a wide range of men-
tal health related studies. This includes works
that can detect (Coppersmith et al., 2014; Resnik
et al., 2015) and measure the degree of depres-
sion (Schwartz et al., 2014), identify depressive
symptoms (Mowery et al., 2016), and detect the
behavioural changes associated with onset of de-
pression (De Choudhury et al., 2013b). There are
also works focus on predicting personality traits
such as neuroticism (Resnik et al., 2013), which is
known to be highly associated with depression.

However, the above mentioned works mainly
focus on recognising depression, with the poten-
tial causes of depression being ignored. Dis-
covering the potential causes of depression is a
worthwhile aspect of psychiatric diagnosis in or-
der to offer the individual patient with solution-

specific, interpersonal or psychodynamic therapy
for the best treatment outcome (Nathan and Gor-
man, 2015). For example, interpersonal psy-
chotherapy can benefit patients who have recog-
nised interpersonal problems as the cause of their
depression. Furthermore, identifying causes can
improve the efficiency of the treatment plan, as it
is normally involved in a patient’s diagnostic eval-
uation and can help recognise possible barriers to
treatment support (Gilman et al., 2013).

In this paper, we tackle the research challenge
of discovering potential causes of depression by
analysing the topics from user-generated contents.
We approach the problem by developing a com-
putational model which extends the dynamic topic
model (He et al., 2012). In order to extract co-
herent sentiment-bearing topics that are indicative
for identifying the causes of depression, we de-
velop the major categories of depression cause
based on two well-known resources i.e., DSM-
IV (Gilman et al., 2013) and Crisis Text Line
(www.crisistextline.org). We also pro-
pose a mechanism to incorporate domain knowl-
edge of depression causes into our model for guid-
ing the model inference procedure, which helps us
to extract depression related and meaningful top-
ics. Experimental results show that our approach
can extract topics revealing valuable clues and risk
factors about the causes contributing to depression
based on informal user-generated data; thereby
providing deep insights into a patient’s state for
pertinent treatment recommendations.

2 Related Work

A wide range of risk factors are associated with the
development and persistence of depression (e.g.,
biological, psychological or cognitive), however,
psychosocial are among the strongest (Slavich and
Irwin, 2014). To examine depressive disorder, one
effective means is via language analysis, as the use
of language can be linked to important informa-
tion about people’s behaviours and psychological
insights (Pennebaker et al., 2003).

De Choudhury et al. (2013a) showed that Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) with Radial Basis
Function (RBF) kernel could predict depression
signs from Twitter posts. A similar approach
was applied to Japanese Twitter posts for inves-
tigating the correlations between users’ activities
and depression (Tsugawa et al., 2015). Copper-
smith et al. (2014) used language models and Lin-

guistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker
et al., 2007), a psychometrically validated analysis
tool, to explore the language differences of Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder users. Schwartz et al.
(2014) built a regression model to predict the de-
gree of depression across seasons based on lan-
guage features on Facebook.

In contrast to the works above which analyse
static data, there has also been research in examin-
ing changes in behavioural patterns relating to on-
set of depression. For instance, De Choudhury and
Counts (2013) analysed the behavioural changes
of new mothers who are at risk of postpartum de-
pression following childbirth. In the subsequent
work, De Choudhury et al. (2013b) further pre-
dicted whether one is likely to have depression in
the future by examining the patterns of one’s Twit-
ter postings in a one-year time frame. Both stud-
ies showed that significant changes in social media
activities could be the potential measures for pre-
dicting depression.

Another stream of works employ the Big Five
personality traits (John and Srivastava, 1999) in
depressive illness related studies. The Big Five
personality traits define five different personal-
ity characteristics i.e., extroversion, agreeable-
ness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and open-
ness. Among these personal traits, neuroticism
is known to have a substantial correlation to
the prior development of common depressive ill-
ness and psychological distress (Fanous et al.,
2007). Schwartz et al. (2013) explored an open-
vocabulary approach to gain psychological in-
sights based on the demographics and personal-
ity traits framework. The works of Resnik et al.
(2013, 2015) are most closely related to ours,
as they explored topic modelling to automati-
cally identify depressive-related language. They
showed that using topic models provides better
predictive performance than solely relying on pre-
defined lexical features. They also highlighted that
the topics extracted by Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) are meaningful and psy-
chologically relevant. Specifically, Resnik et al.
(2013) combined lexical features with features ex-
tracted by topic models, which improves the pre-
diction of neuroticism and depression on student
essay data. In the more recent work, Resnik et al.
(2015) further explored using Supervised LDA
(Mcauliffe and Blei, 2008) and Supervised Anchor
model (Arora et al., 2013) to analyse the linguistic

10



signal for detecting depression.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have

explored the research problem of automatically
identifying the causes of depression using natu-
ral language processing techniques. We envisage
that by addressing this problem, our work would
be useful for both individual and population-level
mental health monitoring and prevention.

3 Methodology

In this section, we first describe how we acquire
the categories of causes of depression, and then
describe the computational framework for auto-
matically extracting coherent topics that are in-
dicative for identifying the causes of depression.

3.1 Development of Cause Categories for
Depression

For extracting potential causes of depression from
text, we first develop the major categories of
depression cause based on two well-known re-
sources.

First, we construct the primary list based on the
risk factors outlined in the description of Axis IV
in DSM-IV (Gilman et al., 2013). DSM-IV is a
standard diagnostic manual of mental disorders,
which defines nine broad categories that increase
the risk of developing depression. The broad cat-
egories include problems related to primary sup-
port group, social environment, occupational, eco-
nomic, educational, housing, accessing to health-
care services, and legal/crime. However, some of
the categories are too broad or do not state pre-
cisely enough for the causes, such as “primary
support group” and “social environment”. There-
fore, in order to obtain a more comprehensive list
of depression causes, we further make use of the
resources available from Crisis Text Line1.

Basically, Crisis Text Line is one of the largest
crisis counselling services which supports a wide
range of issues from relationship concerns to de-
pression to suicidal thoughts. We utilise the trends
list of 17 issues prevalent to depression: anxi-
ety, bereavement, bullying, eating disorders, fam-
ily issues, friend issues, health concerns, isola-
tions, LGBT issues, physical abuse, relationships,
school problems, self-harm, sexual abuse, stress,
substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts.

To ensure the quality of the cause categories
developed based on the above resources, we also

1www.crisistrends.org

consulted a physician who had an extensive expe-
riences dealing with depression cases. We worked
together to refine the list, taking into considera-
tion the leading factors contributing to depression.
We discarded the ones which are not quite related
to the causes of depression, i.e., suicidal thoughts
and self-harm. We also added to the list two other
common issues that reinforce negative thoughts or
emotions. For instance, body image (e.g. body-
hatred, overweight, underweight) and homesick-
ness have been considered associated with psy-
chological disturbance, especially among young
adults.

We present the categories of depression causes
in Table 1. While this is by no means an explicit
list of causes of depression. Indeed, there can be
as many different causes of depression as possible.
Our argument that this is an initial development
and we account for their relative significance. The
list can be extended in our future research.

Bullying Family issues
Housing Health concerns
Body image Substance abuse
Bereavement Occupation
Homesickness Academic
Relationships Economic
Discrimination Sexual abuse
Physical abuse

3.2 The dynamic Joint Sentiment-Topic
model

We employ the dynamic Joint Sentiment-Topic
(dJST) model (He et al., 2012) to extract coher-
ent sentiment-bearing topics that are indicative for
identifying the causes of depression. In addition,
the model is also capable to track how the topics
evolve over time, permitting investigation of the
prominence of depression causes.

The dJST model, as shown in Figure 1, as-
sumes that the current sentiment-topic words dis-
tributions are generated by the word distributions
at the previous epochs. Each document d at
epoch t is represented as a vector of word to-
kens, wtd = (w

t
d1
, wtd2 , · · · , wtdNd ). By assum-

ing that the documents at current epoch are influ-
enced by documents at past, the current sentiment-
topic specific word distributions ϕtl,z at epoch
t are generated according to the word distribu-

tions at previous epochs. In particular, an evo-
lutionary matrix of topic z and sentiment label
l, Etl,z where each column in the matrix is the
word distribution of topic z and sentiment la-
bel l, σtl,z,s, generated for document streams re-
ceived within the time slice specified by s, where
s ∈ {t− S, t− S + 1, · · · , t− 1}, the current
sentiment-topic-word distributions are dependent
on the previous sentiment-topic specific word dis-
tributions in the last S epochs.

We then attach a vector of S weights µtl,z =
[µtl,z,0, µ

t
l,z,1, · · · , µtl,z,S ]T, each of which deter-

mines the contribution of time slice s in computing
the priors of ϕtl,z . Hence, the Dirichlet prior for
sentiment-topic-word distributions at epoch t is
βtl,z = E

l,z µ

t
l,z . Assuming we have already cal-

culated the evolutionary parameters {Et−1l,z ,µtl,z}
for the current epoch t, the generative story of
dJST as shown in Figure 1 at epoch t is given as
follows:

• For each sentiment label l = 1, · · · , L
– For each topic z = 1, · · · , T
∗ Draw αtl,z|αt−1l,z ∼ Γ(ναt−1l,z , ν)
∗ Compute βtl,z = µtl,zEtl,z
∗ Draw ϕtl,z ∼ Dir(βtl,z).

• For each document d = 1, · · · , Dt
– Choose a distribution πtd ∼ Dir(γ).
– For each sentiment label l under doc-

ument d, choose a distribution θtd,l ∼
Dir(σt).

– For each word n = 1, · · · , Nd in docu-
ment d
∗ Choose a sentiment label ln ∼

Mult(πtd),
∗ Choose a topic zn ∼ Mult(θtd,ln),
∗ Choose a word wn ∼ Mult(ϕtln,zn).

3.2.1 Incorporating Domain Knowledge
In order to extract depression cause relevant and
semantically meaningful topics, we incorporate
two types of domain knowledge into our model for
guiding the model inference procedure.

The first type of domain knowledge is a gen-
eral sentiment lexicon consists of the Multi-
perspective Question Answering (MPQA) subjec-
tivity lexicon2 and the appraisal lexicon (Bloom
et al., 2007). In total, there are 1,511 positive
and 2,542 negative words, respectively. The sec-
ond type of domain knowledge is seed words re-
lating to depression cause categories described in
Section 3.1. To acquire the seed words, we make
use of OneLook Dictionary3, a search engine for
words and phrases. Precisely, for each of the de-
pression category, we query OneLook by search-
ing for words related to the depression cause cat-
egory label. For instance, for category “bullying”,
we obtain 539 words related to bullying e.g., in-
timidation, harrasment, brutal, etc. We filter and
retain the top 50 most relevant words to the search
query. We use those words to be the seed words as
prior knowledge for the model training. The total
number of seed words contains 750 words.

At epoch 1, the Dirichlet priors β of size L ×
T × V are first initialized as symmetric priors of
0.01 (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007), and then mod-
ified by a transformation matrix λ of size L × V .
We encode the word prior knowledge in the way
that elements of β corresponding to positive senti-
ment words, e.g., good, will have small values for
topics associated with negative sentiment labels,
and vice versa for the negative sentiment words.
For subsequent epochs, if any new words encoun-
tered, the prior knowledge will be incorporated
in a similar way. But for existing words, their

Dirichlet priors for sentiment-topic-word distribu-
tions are obtained using βtl,z = E

3.2.2 Online Inference
We employ a stochastic EM algorithm (He et al.,
2012) to sequentially update model parameters at
each epoch. At each EM iteration, we infer latent
sentiment labels and topics using the collapsed
Gibbs sampling and estimate the hyperparameters
using maximum likelihood.

We set the symmetric prior γ = (0.05 ×
average document length)/L, where L is the to-
tal number of sentiment labels and the value of
0.05 on average allocates 5% of probability mass
for mixing. Moreover, there are two sets of evo-
lutionary parameters to be estimated, the weight
parameters µ and the evolutionary matrix E. We
set µ using an exponential decay function µt =
exp(−κt), so that more recent documents would
have a relatively stronger influence on the model
parameters in the current epoch compared to ear-
lier documents. We set κ = 0.5 in the experi-
ments. The derivation of the evolutionary matrix
E requires the estimation of each of its elements,
σl,z,w,s, i.e., the word distribution of word w in
topic z and sentiment label l at time slice s, which

is defined as σtl,z,w,s =
Ctl,z,w,s∑
w C

t
l,z,w,s

. Here Cl,z,w,s
is the expected number of times word w was as-
signed to sentiment label l and topic z at time slice
s. Each time slice s is equivalent to an epoch t,
thus Cl,z,w,s can be obtained directly from Nl,z,w,t
by setting s = t.

4 Experimental Setup

Dataset. We conducted experiments on a real-
world dataset, namely, the student essay dataset.
This dataset is publicly available and has been
used in a number of mental health studies (Resnik
et al., 2013). It contains 6,459 stream-of-
consciousness essays collected between 1997 and
2008, and each essay is labelled with Big-5 per-
sonality traits scores. As discussed earlier, neu-
roticism (negative affectivity) is a factor that
strongly associates with high risk of depressive
disorders. We divided the dataset into two cate-
gories based on the neuroticism scores, i.e, essays
with positive scores are classified as high neuroti-
cism, and negative score as low neuroticism. Any
essays missing personality traits scores were elim-
inated from the dataset. The final dataset contains
a total number of 4,954 essays with 2,566 asso-

with low neuroticism, as shown in Figure 2.
General Settings. Each dataset underwent pre-
processing including conversion to lowercase, re-
moval of non-alphanumeric characters, and re-
moval of stop words. We empirically set the num-
ber of topics to 20 for the 2 sentiment labels (i.e.,
positive and negative), which is equivalent to a to-
tal of 40 sentiment-topic clusters. The number of
time-slices set to 4.

5 Experimental Results

In this section, we present our results on the ex-
perimental datasets. In particular, we aim to in-
vestigate the following two research questions: (i)
what are the most prominent causes for neuroti-
cism among college students and how do these
causes evolve over time; and (ii) what are the dif-
ferences of the topics extracted from essays writ-
ten by of students from low and high neuroticism
groups.

5.1 Analysing the Depressing-related Issues
from the High Neurotisism Group

In this section, we present the results on extracting
topics for depression-related causes analysis. Fig-
ure 3 illustrates the example topics from high neu-
roticism (negative sentiment) and low neuroticism
(positive sentiment). The topics extracted are in
agreement with those reported in the risk factors
that contribute to stress experienced by students
(Robotham and Julian, 2006). We discuss some of
the topics in details below.
Academic. Unsurprisingly, one of the prominent
causes among the students with high-neuroticism
score is related to academic studies, consistent
with the report of primary causes of stress among

students4. Academic topic words in Figure 3
(e.g., “study, test, bad, grades, worried”) show
that students express a very stressful experiences
in study. For example, “I am scared that my grades

students-are-afflicted-mental-hea/

won’t be able to cut it though”, “I am pretty much
worried about my classes and what grades I will
get in them”.

Relationship and homesickness. Our analy-
sis found that relationship problems and home-
sickness are also widely common among stu-

14



dents, as shown in the Relationship and
Homesickness topics. Indeed, intimate rela-
tionships with a partner can be a great source of
love, support and excitement. However, relation-
ships can also be a source of grief and anguish
if they go wrong. University students are in a
period of personal change, which can then make
them feel less sure or what they want or how to
cope with relationship problems. For examples,
“I feel insecure about our relationship myself and
in some way feel like I am not worthy of some-
one liking me”. Research by the National Union
of Students5 shows that 50-70% of new students
suffer from homesickness to some extent within
in their first two or three weeks. Although most
students find their symptoms begin to fade after a
few weeks, the symptoms tend to stay longer for
students with high neuroticism.
Housing. Another interesting finding is that bad
accommodation seems to have strong negative im-
pact on the socio-emotional development and psy-
chological distress of students. For instance, there
are lot of complaint about the condition of the
university accommodation, e.g., “Someone in this
room needs to buy a mop because our floor is
getting really gross”, “Our shower is very small
in the first place and combined with being dirty,
well that’s just plain bad”. There is a strong link
of mental health problems with insecure, and the
chaotic way of living (Tight, 2011).
Body image and health concerns. Individuals
with high level of neuroticism seem less satisfied
with their body image and health as implied in
topics Body Image and Health concerns.
For instance, messages similar to “I am so ner-
vous about gaining weight. I always watch what i
eat” appear quite often in the dataset. This shows
that physiological factors do promote to dissatis-
faction in students’ life, which lead to low self-
esteem (correlated with high neuroticism).

5.2 Comparing the High and the Low
Neuroticism Groups.

We estimate the probability of top 5 topics across
years using the relative frequency technique. We
calculate the ‘relative observed frequencies’ of a
topic, and divide the number of occurrences of the
topic by the number of documents for that partic-
ular year. Figure 4 shows the distribution of top
5 topics of high and low neuroticism. We found

5https://www.nus.org.uk/

that the topic Relationship is very common
among students from both groups. The trend re-
flects the fact that students are prone to stress in
student life, often caused by the poor relationship
issues, which also lead to struggles in academic,
social adjustment, and individual self-esteem.

Another interesting key difference to highlight
is on the social engagement level. Students with
low neuroticism are much more active and show
more interest in various social activities (e.g., mu-
sic and sports). Similar findings are consistent
with research (Afshar et al., 2015), in that the in-
dividuals with low-neuroticism are more likely to
utilise relaxation (music, meditation, yoga, etc.)
and physical recreation (regular exercise, sports,
running, etc.) as coping mechanisms.
Sentiment analysis. We discuss the sentiment
differences on the same topic between two groups,
as shown in Figure 3. The topics about academic
and relationship are both prominent among these
groups, however, there are differences in percep-
tions and emotional reactivity towards these top-
ics. Specifically, students with high-neuroticism
respond poorly to environmental stress and inter-
pret ordinary situations as threatening and experi-
ence minor frustrations as hopelessly overwhelm-
ing. For example, they seem to have difficulty in
coping the issues and challenges from academic
studies. Below are some examples,

• “I hate myself for not doing well in some other class. Its
a vicious cycle that I can’t seem to get out of. I do bad
in one class because I focus on all the wrong things
and then it carries over to ever other class, which in
turn makes my academics suffer”.

• “I’m worried about studying for psychology. It’s my
first collegiate test. I’ll probably do terrible. or at least
far less than my expectations”.

Whereas, students with low neuroticism seem
to have higher stress tolerance when dealing with
academic pressures. They are more resilient to
challenges, embrace and overcome obstacles in a
positive way. Take for examples the following,

• “I am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet
to come. I hope I am joining the right organizations
that appeal to me. I also hope I will stay academically
strong as I was in high school”.

• “Its going to be my first official test in college. I just
can’t imagine me taking a test. I just need to relax,
study the best I can, and be optimistic about my aca-
demics”.

6 Conclusion

The causes of depression can vary greatly from
person to person. It is a great challenge for clin-
ical practice in the recognition and treatment of
depression, particularly when there are barriers
in getting the appropriate support, e.g., time con-
straints in primary care, a strong social stigma at-
tached to mental illness and discrimination. Our
approach on topic modelling for classification cer-
tainly bridges the gap and significantly expands
the access in identifying the possible factors that
trigger depression in individuals. Identifying the
causes of depression increases the accuracy of se-
lecting the most appropriate treatment and im-
proves the quality of depression care. Therefore,
further research should be undertaken to optimise
topic models for drawing out potential causes of
depression from social media data. Furthermore, a
dataset with ground truth that covers wider causes
of depression such as financial and occupation
should be explored in the future, to cater for differ-
ent groups of people e.g., employee, housewives,
etc.
