Abstract 

While there have been many proposals for 
theories of semantic roles over the years, 
these models are mostly justified by intui-
tion and the only evaluation methods have 
been inter-annotator agreement. We ex-
plore three different ideas for providing 
more rigorous theories of semantic roles.  
These ideas give rise to more objective cri-
teria for designing role sets, and lend 
themselves to some experimental evalua-
tion. We illustrate the discussion by exam-
ining the semantic roles in TRIPS.  

1 Introduction 

Semantic roles play a foundational role in most 
computational approaches to encoding meaning, 
yet they remain surprisingly ill-defined. For the 
most part, a role taxonomy is defined by an in-
formal gloss and some examples. In other cases, 
semantic roles act purely as convenient names for 
arguments of a predicate, frame or event, but are 
otherwise uninterpreted. This paper starts from the 
belief that if we are going to base a representation 
on semantic roles, they should have consequences 
independent of the predicate or event they are 
used in. In particular, we will explore three differ-
ent aspects that identify criteria one might want in 
a theory of semantic roles: 
1. Entailment: We should be able to identify en-

tailments from a role independent of the type 
that has such roles 

2. Integration with ontology: Roles should obey 
the typical entailments in an ontology (e.g., 
inheritance of properties from parents in the 
ontology) 

3. Derivability: The roles that a type has should 
be derivable from its semantic properties, as 
revealed by definitions of the type in sources 
such as dictionaries. 

The first property helps ensure that roles are used 
consistently in a semantic lexicon, the second en-
sures consistency with an ontology used for rea-

soning, and the third evaluates the semantic inter-
dependence of roles and the types they occur in. 

This paper will examine a particular role set, 
the TRIPS roles sketched in Allen & Teng, 
(2017)1. The first two properties are more formal 
in nature, but the third allows empirical evalua-
tion, namely, whether the roles of an unknown 
word sense can be derived from its definition.  

2 Preliminaries 

Semantic roles have a long history, originating in 
linguistics as thematic roles (e.g., Fillmore, 1968; 
Dowty, 1991) and widely adopted in computa-
tional linguistics for semantic representations be-
cause of their compatibility with frame-based and 
graph-based (i.e., semantic networks) representa-
tions of meaning.  

Very roughly, computational approaches can be 
divided into two classes based on whether one be-
lieves there is a single universal set of roles (e.g., 
LiRICS (Bunt & Rosemary, 2002; Petukhova & 
Bunt, 2008), VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008; Bonial 
et al., 2011)), or whether one believes each type 
may identify its own unique roles (e.g., FrameNet 
(Baker et al., 1998)). Straddling a middle ground 
is PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), which uses a 
universal set of role names, but allows each type 
to define what their roles mean. Our interest is in 
defining a universal set of roles across all types. 

A key distinction that most frameworks make 
is between the inner (or core or argument) roles 
and the outer (or relational or adjunct) roles. The 
core roles identify objects that are typically re-
quired to fully specify the content of the type, 
while relational roles are typically optional but 
add additional information. For instance, in 

The snow melted into a puddle. 

The subject of this sentence is clearly a critical ar-
gument to the melting event. In fact, we cannot

describe a melting event in a well-formed sen-
tence without mentioning what melted (even if it 
is vague, as in something melted). On the other 
hand, the result construction realized by into a 
puddle is optional. Typically, roles of time and lo-
cation are relational roles as they can be applied to 
almost any event and are usually optional.  

 But there are differences that go beyond op-
tionality. The core roles semantically are like ar-
guments to a predicate, although they might be 
optional. The relational roles semantically denote 
a relationship between an event and some other 
condition, not an argument. For instance, the 
phrase into a puddle above denotes first a seman-
tic relationship called RESULTING-OBJECT 
(one of the senses of the word into) that takes as 
one argument the melting event and the other ar-
gument the object that the snow becomes, i.e., a 
puddle. We will elaborate on this later in the pa-
per. 

This paper describes three possible ways to es-
tablish a more rigorous semantics for a set of 
semantic roles, and explores each method in 
terms of the TRIPS semantic roles. In Section 4 
we describe the start of an axiomatization of the 
roles. In Section 5 we describe the integration of 
the roles with an ontology. And in Section 6 we 
describe experiments involving derivability, i.e., 
can the roles that a given verb sense has be de-
rived from its dictionary definition.  

3 Overview of TRIPS Semantic Roles 

The TRIPS core roles are shown in Table 1. These 
roles are defined to reflect the causal relationship 
between the role values and the events they are in. 
Informally, an AGENT of an event necessarily ex-
erts causal influence to bring about the event. An 
AFFECTED of an event is necessarily affected or 
changed in some way by the event but does not 
cause the event. Objects filling the NEUTRAL 
and FORMAL roles are acausal, i.e., not neces-
sarily causing or changed by the event.  NEU-
TRAL objects are existent and can be created or 
destroyed.  These include both physical (e.g., a 
box) and abstract (e.g., an idea) objects. In con-
trast, FORMAL objects have no temporal exist-
ence (e.g., a proposition). Finally, EXPERI-
ENCER is a special class for sentient objects in 
stative events involving perceptual or cognitive 
states. 

Table 1 summarizes the distinguishing features 
of each of the roles, and shows correspondences 
with VerbNet and LiRICS. Note the mappings are 
nowhere near one-to-one, reflecting differing cri-
teria that are used to define each of the role sets. 
In some cases, the LiRICS role is not completely 
clear and is marked with a question mark. 

Some differences are differences of granularity 
(cf: the hierarchical roles in Bonial et al. (2001) 
and Allen (1995)). For instance, the TRIPS 
AGENT role only requires a causal relationship to 
the event, and does not require intentionality of 
the agent (as in LiRICS which distinguishes be-
tween its AGENT and CAUSE roles). TRIPS 
takes this stance as it seems most verbs with 
agents would also allow non-intentional causes as 
well. We believe the intentionality distinction is 
not signaled in linguistic usage, and should be de-
rived based on commonsense knowledge and rea-
soning. Thus, we do not make the distinction in 
the role set. 

As another example, VerbNet identifies classes 
of STIMULUS/EXPERIENCER verbs, as in The 
clown amused the children. Roughly, the STIM-
ULUS role plays a causal role similar to AGENT 
and the EXPERIENCER plays an AFFECTED 
role where the object is affected in some cognitive 
fashion. The TRIPS roleset stays at an abstract 
level of representation, assigning the clown to 
AGENT and children to AFFECTED.  For similar 
reasons, TRIPS does not have INSTRUMENT as 
a core role (although there is a sense of the prepo-
sition with that captures accomplishing actions 
with a tool – e.g., He opened the door with a key). 

Note TRIPS and VerbNet agree on the EXPE-
RIENCER role in some cases, namely with stative 
verbs. In TRIPS, EXPERIENCER only occurs 
with stative verbs of perception and cognition. 

There is a surprising variety in the VerbNet 
roles corresponding to the TRIPS roles, partly due 
to the principle in VerbNet that objects should fill 
the same role across all the different constructions 
supported by the verb. For instance, in The horse 
jumped over the fence, the horse is assigned a 
THEME role because jump supports another con-
struction where the horse plays that role, as in He 
jumped the horse over the fence. Using the TRIPS 
criteria, however, the horse is clearly an AGENT 
in the first, and an AFFECTED in the second. 

236



   

Note that based on the definitions of the roles, 
it is common that the same role appears more than 
once in a sentence. We distinguish these argu-
ments by attaching numbers to them. Thus, in The 
box is touching the table we have two roles NEU-
TRAL and NEUTRAL1 for the box and the table 
respectively. VerbNet uses a similar scheme and 
labels these arguments THEME and CO-THEME. 

Most of the remaining TRIPS roles are rela-
tional roles, which as discussed above relate an 
event to some other property. Linguistically, rela-
tional roles are realized by prepositional phrases 
and other adverbial constructions. Semantically, a 
relational role identifies causal temporal relation-
ships between the event and the property denoted 
by the prepositional phrase. As an example, for 
the sentence He pushed the box into the corner, 
there is an event (He pushed the box) that results 
in a culmination state (The box is in the corner). 
The key characteristic of a RESULT relation is 

that the state is caused by the event and starts im-
mediately at the end of the event. Table 2 shows a 
number of result related roles based on their tem-
poral properties. These three roles differ only in 
the temporal properties of the caused state. 

Note that many cases one might think are 
SOURCE roles are actually RESULT roles ac-
cording to their temporal criterion. For instance, in 
He lifted the bottle out of the box, the state of be-
ing out of the box is true at the end of the event! 
Using our definitions the SOURCE role seems 
mostly limited to cases using the preposition from.  

Note also that the prepositions in these con-
structions have fully independent word senses, so 
our representation does not conflate He put the 
cup on the box and He put the cup in the box. In 
contrast, VerbNet assigns the box to a DESTINA-
TION role in both and ignoring the preposition. 

Other relational roles, which we will not have 
the space to discuss here, correspond relatively

4 Axiomatizing Roles 

Given the space constraints we cannot present a 
full axiomatization of the role set.  To give a fla-
vor of the axiomatization we look at one core role 
in particular, namely the AFFECTED role. This 
introduces most of the formal framework that is 
used to define all the roles.  In addition, we will 
show the axiomatization of one of the key rela-
tional roles, namely the RESULT role. 

4.1 The Framework  
We start from the formalism developed in Allen & 
Teng (2013), extended from the interval temporal 
logic based framework in Allen & Ferguson 
(1994) and Allen (1984).  In this framework, both 
events and property predicates are reified (cf. Da-
vidson, 1967) with functional relations capturing 
semantic roles and arguments. Terms, rather than 
predicates, are temporally qualified.  For example, 
x@t represents “object x over time t”.   

Objects filling roles of events are temporally 
situated.  For example, Jack lifted the ball (over 
interval t1) is represented as  
				∃e.(LIFT(e),time(e)=t1, 
								AGENT(e)=jack1@t1,	
								AFFECTED(e)=ball1@t1) 

Key to this framework is a theory of scales. For 
example, height(o@t) maps a temporally situated 
object to the set of values on the height scale that 

this object takes over period t. Note that the object 
o may take different values on a scale sc over a 
given time interval t.  Thus, sc(o@t) is a set of 
values.  If sc is not a scale applicable to o@t, then 
sc(o@t) is empty. For example, for all time inter-
vals t, we have mood(rock1@t) =	∅. 

Adjectives in natural language are typically 
represented as Scale Predicates, which denote (of-
ten but not necessarily convex) subsets of values 
on a corresponding scale.  Two examples are 
ScalePred(temperature, Cold) and ScaleP-
red(mood, Happy).  Thus, it is true that John is 
Happy today is written as 

  TrueOf(john1@today, Happy). 
In this paper, to describe relations between time 

intervals, we will make use of the meets relation, 
written t1:t2, and “during or equal”, written t1 ⊆ 
t2, from Allen's temporal relations (Allen, 1983).   

For more details, see Allen & Teng (2013). 

4.2 The AFFECTED Role 
In Allen & Teng (2013), existence is taken as a 
primitive in the formal framework.  We will de-
fine this as a scale with dichotomous values: ex-
istent(o@t) = true if o exists over the time interval 
t.  An object can go in and out of existence at dif-
ferent times. This includes both physical objects 
such as tables and chairs as well as some abstract 
objects such as thoughts and orderings. 

For some objects, it does not make sense to talk 
about their existence.  These include propositions, 
properties, scales and scale values.  (For example, 
hungry, five pounds.)  For these objects, ∀𝑡. exist-

ent(o@t) = ∅. Note that the value is ∅, not false, 
meaning the existent scale is not applicable. 

Now consider the AFFECTED role of an event.  
It denotes an object that is casually acted upon in 
the event by the AGENT of the event and is 
changed in some way by the event.  In “I lifted the 
box”, the box changed location.  In “The snow 
melted”, the snow changed state of matter.  In “I 
molded the clay”, the clay changed shape.   

Each event type (e.g., LIFT, MELT, MOLD) is 
associated with a specific dimension of change 
such that every occurrence of a particular event 
type entails a change in the AFFECTED along 
that particular dimension.  For example, for each 
MOLD event, the AFFECTED of MOLD changes 
shape, even though the resulting shape in each in-
stance might differ.  This is captured by specifying 
that all events of the same event type share a scale 
on which change occurs for the AFFECTED. 

We can thus formulate the conditions for AF-
FECTED as follows.  Let E(e) denote that e is an 
event occurrence of type E.  Let scale(sc) denote 
that sc is a scale. 
∀𝐸		∃𝑠𝑐		∀𝑒, 𝑜, 𝑡.  

         𝐸(𝑒), 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑐 , 
         𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒(𝑒) = 𝑡, 𝑨𝑭𝑭𝑬𝑪𝑻𝑬𝑫(𝑒) = 𝑜@𝑡  
      ⟹	∃𝑡1, 𝑡2.			  
               𝑡1 ⊆ 𝑡, 𝑡1: 𝑡2,																																																																									
																	𝑠𝑐(𝑜@𝑡1) ≠ 𝑠𝑐(𝑜@𝑡2)		
This says the AFFECTED of e undergoes at least 
one change in a scale dimension sc characteristic 
of the event type E. There can be more changes, 
both along the same scale (e.g., the clay changes 
shape continuously while being molded), or along 
other dimensions (e.g., the snow changes both 
shape and volume while being melted). 

In the above, t1 is during or equal t, the time in-
terval of the event, whereas t2 is met by t1 but 
could be during, overlaps, or at the end of t.  This 
allows for changes that are intermittent and may 
not persist to the end of the event (e.g., flicker, 
wiggle) and also changes that occur only at the 
end of the event (e.g., the stick snapped).  In the 
latter case, for AFFECTED objects that only come 
into existence at the end of the event (e.g., I drew 
a circle), it is possible that sc(o@t1) = ∅. 

Note that the semantics of the roles are defined 
with respect to completed events.  This is captured 
by the predicate E(e). For example, for I was 
drawing a circle but did not finish, even though 
the circle never came into existence, the roles are 
derived not from the progressive formulation but 
from the corresponding case in which the event 
has occurred. 

4.3 Characteristic Properties of Core Roles 
Table 1 lists several properties: causal, affected, 
existent.  Each of the core roles can be character-
ized by a combination of the presence or absence 
of these properties.  The axiomatization of the 
AFFECTED role indicates how the affected prop-
erty can be defined.  The existent property is cap-
tured by the existent scale discussed in the previ-
ous section. 

The causal property is meant to indicate that 
an object exerts a causal influence.  In the transi-
tive case the AGENT causes the event to happen 
to the AFFECTED (I caused the lifting of the 
box).  The causal property is often taken as prim-
itive in other rolesets, but we will outline here 
how it might be formalized.   

We take advantage of the intuition that if X 
causes an event e, then if we change X in some 
way we can change the event that occurs. More 
formally, let sc_E be the scale characteristic of 
event type E, that is, when an event of type E oc-
curs, its AFFECTED is changed along the scale 
dimension sc_E.  Loosely speaking, when +causal 
obtains (for an AGENT oag), there exists some 
scale sc* such that a change of oag on the sc* 
scale would entail a change of the AFFECTED 
oaff on the sc_E scale. In other words, there is 
some property of the AGENT such that when 
this property is changed, regardless by what 
means, some property of the AFFECTED will 
vary accordingly.  

4.4 Wrinkles 
A few further considerations complicate the for-
mulation above. 

First, existent objects are constantly undergoing 
changes.  For example, an object typically gets 
older (on the AGE scale) as time passes, even 
without being involved with any explicit AGENT 
or EVENT.  Such changes (with their associated 
scales) would trivially satisfy the conditions in the 
formulation above, such that almost any (existent) 
object could be a candidate for being an AF-
FECTED of any EVENT.  We call such innocuous 
changes Background Changes and exclude them 
from consideration.  

Second, for some events although the occur-
rence of the event typically induces a change 
along the specified scale dimension, this is not al-
ways the case.  For instance, for the PUSH event, 
typically the AFFECTED object changes location 
but in some cases the object might not move.  For 
example, I pushed the door but it was locked.  We 
need to define a notion of canonical or perhaps 

239



   

counterfactual change.  This is especially pertinent 
for events such as PREVENT (I prevented the ac-
cident) or MAINTAIN (The pump maintained the 
air pressure), in which the events in question are 
meant to induce no change in the object being act-
ed upon.  

Third, the NEUTRAL role mostly entails the 
absence of properties: not causal and not affected.  
It would seem then that any existent object could 
fill this role, even if this object bears no relation-
ship to the event in question. Similarly, in LiRICS 
for example, the THEME role is defined as  

“Participant in a state or event that is essential 
to the event taking place or the state being in 
effect. In an event, a theme does not have con-
trol over the way the event occurs and is not 
structurally changed by the event.” (Schiffrin 
& Bunt, 2007).   

We need to define the notion of being relevant or 
essential to an event to select for the proper ob-
jects.  The same consideration applies to FOR-
MAL and EXPERIENCER roles as well. 

The axiomatization above thus represents our 
first attempts to formalize the semantic role en-
tailments.  We expect further refinements as we 
explore these issues in depth.  

4.5 The RESULT Relational Role 
Intuitively a RESULT relates an EVENT and the 
eventual state.  The RESULT only becomes true at 
the end of the EVENT.  For example, in “The cat 
slid under the table”, the cat was not under the ta-
ble before or during the sliding event, but at the 
end of the event the cat is under the table. 

In contrast, in many approaches the relationship 
between the event and the resulting spatial predi-
cate is unclear.  For example, VerbNet would treat 
“the table” as the DESTINATION without explicit 
representation of the spatial relation (under).  

RESULTs are often spatial, but they can also be 
other general states.  For example, in “I wiped the 
desk clean”, the result is that the desk is clean. 

Resultative constructions apply to intransitive 
events (e.g., slide) as well as transitive events 
(e.g., wipe).  For intransitive events, the resulting 
state pertains to the subject of the event (e.g., In 
The cat slid under the table, the result is that the 
cat is under the table), whereas for transitive 
events, the resulting state pertains to the object of 
the event (e.g., from I wiped the desk clean, the 
RESULT is that the desk is clean). 

It is possible to transform intransitive construc-
tions into transitive constructions. For example, in 
“The dog barked the cat up the tree”, the BARK 
event is normally intransitive, but in the above re-

sultative construction, the dog is the AGENT of 
the BARK event, the cat is the AFFECTED and 
the RESULT is that the cat is up the tree. (For a 
treatment of this, see Allen & Teng (2017).) 

Thus, the RESULT role can be formalized as 
follows for a transitive event type E. 
∃𝑠𝑐		∀𝑒, 𝑜, 𝑡, 𝑃.  

        𝐸 𝑒 , 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑐 , 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑(𝑠𝑐, 𝑃),  
        𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑒 = 𝑡, 
          𝑨𝑭𝑭𝑬𝑪𝑻𝑬𝑫(𝑒) = 𝑜@𝑡,  
        𝑹𝑬𝑺𝑼𝑳𝑻(𝑒) = 𝑃 
      ⟹ ∃𝑡2.		𝑡: 𝑡2,	 
               𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑂𝑓 𝑜@𝑡2, 𝑃 , 
            ∀𝑡1 ⊆ 𝑡.		~𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑂𝑓(𝑜@𝑡1, 𝑃)			   
For example, for the WIPE event e in “I wiped the 
desk clean”, we have ScalePred(cleanliness, 
Clean), that is, the predicate Clean is defined on 
the cleanliness scale.  In addition, AFFECTED(e) 
= desk1@t and RESULT(e) = Clean; that is, the 
desk is clean immediately after the WIPE event 
but not before.    

Similarly, for the intransitive case, the AF-
FECTED above is replaced by the role filled by 
the subject, that is, the RESULT is a change in the 
subject at the end of the EVENT. 

Note that an EVENT can have multiple RE-
SULTs.  For example, “The cat climbed on the 
box away from the rising water”, in which case 
the two results combine as a conjunction true im-
mediately after the event. 

The scale allowed for each event type con-
strains the possible interpretations of the text.  For 
example, in “I wiped the table clean”, the table 
can change on the cleanliness scale and thus al-
lows a RESULT construction here.  In contrast, in 
“I wiped the table happy”, the mood scale is not 
applicable to tables, ruling out the RESULT con-
struction.  Instead, one would prefer an alternative 
interpretation using a manner-like construction in 
which “happy” is used to qualify “I”. 

5  Integration with an Ontology 

The second criterion we set for a theory of seman-
tic roles is integration with an ontology. If seman-
tic roles are to have an impact on deep language 
understanding and reasoning, they should be inte-
grated with an ontology that supports that reason-
ing and stores commonsense knowledge. There is 
a large relevant literature concerning roles in se-
mantic networks (e.g., Hayes, 1980; Thomason & 
Touretsky, 1991). Essentially such roles are func-
tions from a type (for verbs an event type is one 
sense of the verb) to another object. If a word 

240



   

sense S has a semantic role R, then for all instanc-
es of S there is an object that fills the R role, i.e.,  

∀𝑠.		𝑆 𝑠 ⟹ 	∃𝑟.		𝑅 𝑠, 𝑟  

This axiom captures what is sometimes called an 
essential role (Palmer, 2006), i.e., a semantic role 
that must exist even if not specified in the input 
sentence. Palmer notes that other roles are obliga-
tory, that is, they are both essential and linguisti-
cally required, and still others are simply optional 
and may or may not be realized at either the lin-
guistic or inferential levels.  

A critical foundation of semantic networks is 
inheritance down type hierarchies, where a sub-
type “inherits” all properties of its parent types. 
When viewing this from the perspective of se-
mantic roles, this means any role that is essential 
for a given type T must also then be essential for 
all subtypes of T.  

Surprisingly, the predominant models of se-
mantic roles do not address such issues in any 
depth. VerbNet, for instance, creates its classes 
based on clustering by verb usage patterns, rather 
than semantic entailments, and has a very limited 
hierarchical structure defined in terms of exten-
sions in allowed usages. Within these hierar-
chies, though, it does have inheritance of roles. 
Propbank, on the other hand, is word based and 
even semantically very similar verbs have differ-
ent rolesets (e.g., compare the rolesets for the 
verbs constrict, compress and squeeze, which 

one would expect would be clustered to-
gether in an ontology).  

The TRIPS role set is fully integrated 
with a rich ontology. In this ontology, the 
concepts are organized both by entailment 
as well as the semantic roles the verb sens-
es take. Table 3 shows a small part of the 
upper ontology for events and the roles that 
are defined for each type and inherited 
from ancestor types. Note TRIPS allows 
both essential and optional roles. Both are 
inherited down the hierarchy, and lower 
types can make an inherited optional role 
essential, but not vice versa.  Whether a 
role is obligatory or not is not specified in 
the ontology, but rather in the lexicon 
where the words and the argument struc-
tures they allow are defined. Furthermore, 
it employs explanation closure techniques 
(Schubert, 1994) – if a role is not defined 
as possible in the ontology then the role is 
not possible. 

The integration of roles with an ontolo-
gy mutually constrains the assignment of 

roles to verb sense predicates and constrains the 
ontology itself. For instance, if we believe that 
the verb disappear takes the AFFECTED role 
and not an AGENT role, then its word sense can-
not be under the EVENT-OF-ACTION or 
EVENT-OF-STATE hierarchies, but it looks like 
a good candidate for being under the EVENT-
OF-UNDERGOING-ACTION category. Like-
wise, although you might think the verb analyze 
might take an EXPERIENCER role, if you be-
lieve that analyze falls under EVENT-OF-
ACTION, then it should take the AGENT role 
instead.  

One other aspect that relates to the ontology is 
selectional preferences. As in many semantic 
networks, one can also constrain the semantic 
type of the arguments that can fill a role. For in-
stance, one might say that the event type EAT 
typically concerns an animate entity (as AGENT) 
and some comestible substance (as the AF-
FECTED role). Such knowledge is critical for 
driving semantic disambiguation during parsing. 
The TRIPS restrictions are soft constraints, i.e., 
the parser prefers interpretations that satisfy the 
constraints, but can construct interpretations that 
do not. As with roles, the selectional preferences 
are inherited down the hierarchy, with more spe-
cific event types accumulating all the constraints 
imposed on their ancestors in the hierarchy. We 
do not have the space to discuss this further here.

6 Derivability in Definitions 

The third criterion we explore is derivability. The 
motivation is as follows: If semantic roles have a 
semantics independent of their predicates/events, 
then the semantic properties of roles would not 
change between a predicate and its definition. For 
example, consider the word sense corresponding 
to the predicate for kill, defined as cause to die. 
According to our analysis above, kill would take 
two essential roles: AGENT and AFFECTED. The 
definition, on the other hand, involves a predicate 
cause that takes an AGENT, AFFECTED and a 
FORMAL role (to die). A highly abbreviated logi-
cal form for this definition is shown in Figure 1. 
While cause has three roles, only the FORMAL 
role is fixed by the definition (i.e., it is the die 
event). The unfilled essential roles in the defini-
tion are AGENT and AFFECTED, exactly the 
roles for kill.  

Our hypothesis is that given a good definition 
of a word sense, the essential roles can be de-
rived from that definition automatically. This, of 
course, has significant impact. If the definitions 
in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) are generally rea-
sonable, we can bootstrap from the items prede-
fined in the TRIPS ontology and lexicon, and de-
rive the semantic roles for any verb in WordNet. 
Our preliminary evaluation described here indi-
cates that this is a very feasible goal.  

To implement this we need a strategy for iden-
tifying unfilled semantic roles in a definition. 
The most common case we have encountered in 

WordNet definitions is that the unfilled roles are 
elided in the definition. The TRIPS parser instan-
tiates such gaps in the logical form using its IM-
PRO construct. Other cases include indicating 
the unfilled roles by an indefinite pronoun, such 
as someone or something.  

More complicated cases occur when the roles 
do not occur at the top level but in an embedded 
clause, as in one definition of approach (move 
towards), shown in Figure 2. The roles for the 
predicate Towards are FIGURE and GROUND, 
and an IMPRO fills the GROUND role of the 
predicate. Thus we have a role chain, from the 
head verb through RESULT and GROUND. We 
have analyzed such role patterns and created a 
mapping based on the semantics of the roles. In 
this case, it would indicate a NEUTRAL role, as 
the GROUND role is not changed by the event. 
Table 4 summarizes a few of the most common 
rules for identifying roles from role chains.  

6.1 Experimental Evaluation of Derivability 
To test this technique, we built a customized 
TRIPS system to parse definitions. The main cus-
tomization was the addition of about a dozen top 
level syntactic rules that capture the common 
forms of definitions, which as we have seen con-
tain much ellipsis. Otherwise, the grammar and 
lexicon are exactly the same as in all the other 
variants of the TRIPS parser. Our experiment also 
takes advantage of the fact that the TRIPS ontolo-
gy has an extensive mapping to WordNet synsets, 
and uses the WordNet hypernym hierarchy to

identify abstractions. Any WordNet synset can be 
mapped to its most specific type in the TRIPS on-
tology (Allen & Teng, 2017). 

The experiment was set up as follows.  We re-
peat the following to obtain 40 test cases: 
1) Randomly choose a WordNet synset S such 

that: (a) S has a direct mapping to a TRIPS 
ontology type T, (b) the TRIPS lexicon has 
word W with type T that is also in S, and (c) 
the WordNet definition is not circular. 

2) Remove the lexical entry for W from the 
TRIPS lexicon after recording its essential 
roles as the gold standard answer. 

3) Parse the definition for S and extract the es-
sential roles as described above. 

4) Compare the roles from steps 2) and 3) to 
compute precision and recall.  

For a baseline we assigned each verb the AGENT 
and AFFECTED roles. Table 5 shows the results 
of the experiment. We obtained 88% precision and 
77% recall for our approach, versus 63% and 66% 
respectively using the baseline assignments. Be-
cause a large number of English verbs are simple 
transitive verbs describing change, the baseline 
did better than one might expect. Still our ap-
proach based on parsing definitions performed far 
better, lending strong support that our role set 
passes the derivability test. 

Based on a manual analysis of the errors in this 
experiment, the errors arose from a combination 
of parse errors, ambiguities, and definitions that 
are terse and loose.  For instance, one sense of ap-
pear is defined as to come into sight. This is am-
biguous between entering into some state (the 
right interpretation here), and the acquisition read-
ing where sight is acquired. The parser chose the 
latter, leading to an assignment of AGENT as the 
role rather than AFFECTED. We also missed a 
few roles because of parser errors. For instance, a 
sense of pronounce is defined as to declare 
judgement on (e.g., they pronounced him unfit). 
The parser failed to identify the second gap (i.e., 
the missing object of the preposition on). In addi-
tion, this is the one case we found where our strat-
egy for identifying arguments was inadequate. 
There is an argument to this verb that is the 
judgement, but this is not signaled by an elided 
argument or an indefinite pronoun. Thus the gold 
answer is AGENT, NEUTRAL, FORMAL but our 

system was able to identify only the AGENT role. 
There are several additional processing steps 

we could take to improve the performance. For 
instance, sometimes multiple definitions are pre-
sented in WordNet and we could process them 
all and try to combine them. Currently we only 
analyze the first one. Also, we could try to verify 
the roleset by attempting to parse examples that 
are given in the gloss. Often it seems that the lex-
icographer depends on the examples to supple-
ment and disambiguate the definitions.   

In our error analysis we did not find any ex-
ample where if we had identified the correct 
parse of the definition, we would have identified 
an inappropriate role for the word being defined. 
This indicates that the semantic roles appear to 
be consistent across the lexicon and, furthermore, 
are identifiable by the semantic properties in-
duced by the events in the definitions. In other 
words, they meet the criterion of derivability! 

7 Discussion 

We have presented three possible criteria for how 
one can produce and validate a semantics for a 
semantic role set. We have illustrated the tech-
niques by looking at the roles in the TRIPS 
framework.  Note we do not claim this indicates 
the TRIPS roleset is the only roleset that could be 
useful in linguistic theory and computational se-
mantic models. However, we have shown that the 
TRIPS roleset is internally consistent and has a set 
of desirable semantic properties: (1) it is amenable 
to axiomatization in a temporal logic, (2) it is in-
tegrated into an ontology that supports inher-
itance, and (3) the roles are derivable in the sense 
that they can be derived for verb senses based on 
their definitions. 

The TRIPS roleset was created by considering 
the properties of causality, temporality, existence, 
and sentience. Other researchers choose to create 
rolesets based on other criteria. We encourage 
those researchers to attempt to formalize their 
roles along the dimensions we have defined to 
create a firm theoretical foundation by which all 
theories can be compared.
