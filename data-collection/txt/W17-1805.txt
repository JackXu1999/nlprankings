Meaning Banking beyond Events and Roles
Invited talk

Abstract

In this talk I will discuss the analysis of several semantic phenomena that need meaning rep-
resentations that can describe attributes of propositional contexts. I will do this in a version of
Discourse Representation Theory, using a universal semantic tagset developed as part of a project
that aims to produce a large meaning bank (a semantically-annotated corpus) for four languages
(English, Dutch, German and Italian).
