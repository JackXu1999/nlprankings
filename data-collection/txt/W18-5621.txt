Abstract

For psychiatric disorders such as schizophre-
nia, longer durations of untreated psychosis
are associated with worse intervention out-
comes. Data included in electronic health
records (EHRs) can be useful for retrospec-
tive clinical studies, but much of this is stored
as unstructured text which cannot be directly
used in computation. Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) methods can be used to ex-
tract this data, in order to identify symptoms
and treatments from mental health records,
and temporally anchor the first emergence of
these. We are developing an EHR corpus an-
notated with time expressions, clinical entities
and their relations, to be used for NLP devel-
opment. In this study, we focus on the first
step, identifying time expressions in EHRs for
patients with schizophrenia. We developed a
gold standard corpus, compared this corpus to
other related corpora in terms of content and
time expression prevalence, and adapted two
NLP systems for extracting time expressions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
resource annotated for temporal entities in the
mental health domain.

1 Introduction and Background

For psychiatric disorders such as schizophre-
nia, prolonged periods of time without treatment
are associated with worse intervention outcomes
(Kisely et al., 2006). The number of days be-
tween first symptom onset and initiation of ade-
quate treatment is defined as duration of untreated
psychosis (DUP). For patients with schizophrenia,
a longer DUP has been linked to poorer cognitive
function at the time of first presentation (Lappin

et al., 2007). In addition, it has been shown to pre-
dict more severe symptoms and greater social and
functional impairment (Hill et al., 2012). There-
fore, identifying and reducing the DUP could sig-
nificantly improve both clinical and functional
outcomes. Starting from this observation, there is
an increasing interest in measuring the DUP across
large clinical samples, to provide a quality mea-
sure for mental health services, and in develop-
ing international guidelines aimed at reducing this
value, thus improving outcomes at different levels
(Connor et al., 2013).

Routinely collected data from health services,
such as electronic health records (EHRs), can be
useful for large-scale retrospective clinical stud-
ies. In mental health services, a large proportion
of clinically relevant information is recorded only
in open text fields. To make this information avail-
able for computational analysis, Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods can be used (Meystre
et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2018). When applying
NLP techniques to the clinical domain, one crucial
task involves the identification of temporal infor-
mation. In general, for temporal information mod-
eling, three different steps are typically outlined:
(i) the identification of relevant concepts, such as
symptoms (hallucinations) and treatments (Cloza-
pine), (ii) the identification of time expressions
(May 1st), and (iii) the identification of tempo-
ral relations between entity pairs ({hallucinations}
BEFORE {Clozapine}).

Over the past years, methods for temporal in-
formation extraction have been developed with
promising results, mainly based on the ISO-
TimeML specification language that was devel-



184

oped for the general NLP domain (Pustejovsky
et al., 2010). In the clinical domain, a few manu-
ally annotated corpora (gold standards) have been
created. As part of the Informatics for Integrat-
ing Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project, a set
of 310 de-identified discharge summaries from an
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were annotated with
events, time expressions, and temporal relations
(Sun et al., 2013a). This corpus was then used
for organizing the 2012 i2b2 Challenge on tem-
poral relation extraction (Sun et al., 2013b). In
the oncology field, Styler IV et al. developed a
corpus of 1,254 de-identified EHR notes, anno-
tated for both clinical and temporal information
(THYME corpus) (Styler IV et al., 2014). This
corpus has been used in different NLP challenges,
among which Clinical TempEval 2015 and 2016
focused on temporal information extraction (440
and 591 documents, respectively) (Bethard et al.,
2015, 2016). In both these corpora, four main
TimeML types of time expressions (TIMEXes)
are defined: Date, Duration, Frequency (or Set),
and Time. The THYME corpus also includes two
additional TIMEX types specific to the oncology
domain: PrePostExp (expressions indicating Pre-
and Post-operational concepts) and Quantifier (ex-
pressions like twice or four times).

Compared to other clinical domains, mental
health records are characterized by a greater extent
of narrative portions, describing symptomology
and health progression without relying on struc-
tured fields. In this framework, relevant tempo-
ral information (e.g., associated to symptom on-
set or treatment initiation) is not always well rep-
resented by current temporal models. For exam-
ple, identifying expressions like at age 8 or in 3rd
year of secondary school is not straightforward,
especially as regards the normalization phase (e.g.,
converting 6th May 2018 to “2018-05-06”).

Our long-term goal is to accurately identify
symptoms and treatments from mental health
records, and anchoring these on a timeline, to be
able to calculate DUP and other clinically relevant
temporal constructs on a large patient cohort. To
address this long-term goal, we are developing a
corpus with annotations that cover all necessary
elements (time expressions, clinical entities and
their relations).

In this study, we focus on one subgoal: address-
ing the problem of accurately identifying time ex-
pressions in mental health records related to pa-

tients who have been diagnosed with schizophre-
nia. Our aim was (i) to develop a gold standard
corpus with time expression annotations, (ii) to an-
alyze and compare typical time expressions in this
corpus with other clinical corpora that have been
annotated with time information (i2b2 2012, Clin-
ical TempEval 2016), and (iii) to perform a feasi-
bility study on adapting existing NLP systems for
extracting time expressions.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Data
In this study, we used anonymized1 mental
health records from the Clinical Record Interac-
tive Search (CRIS) database (Perera et al., 2016)2.
This database was derived in 2008 from the
EHR system adopted by a large mental health-
care provider in southeast London: the South Lon-
don and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS)
Foundation Trust (SLaM).

Mental health records for patients who had re-
ceived a diagnosis related to schizophrenia were
extracted. To identify these patients, we queried
the CRIS database for patients who had been doc-
umented with an ICD-10 code for this disease
(F20*) or, if not documented with a structured
code, we relied on the output of an NLP tool which
extracts diagnoses from free text (based on the
keyword “schizophrenia”) (Perera et al., 2016), re-
sulting in 8,483 documents for 1,691 patients3. To
make the task feasible for manual annotation and
relevant to the clinical use-case, two main docu-
ment sample steps were taken:

1. Only documents that were written within 3
months of first presentation to mental health
services were extracted, on the assumption
that these early documents would most likely
contain the richest description of the patient’s
clinical history and presenting complaints re-
lated to relevant symptoms;

2. From these documents, only the longest doc-
ument (in terms of total number of charac-
ters) for each patient was extracted to be used
for annotation, on the assumption that this

1Textual portions are automatically anonymized by re-
moving patient and relative identifiers, such as names and
postal codes.

2This database has ethical approval for secondary analysis
(Oxford REC C, reference 08 H0606 71+5).

3Data were extracted on March 31st 2016 for patients ac-
cepted in services after January 1st 2012.



185

document most likely would contain most in-
formation about the patient history;

From the extracted set, a random sample of 52
documents (one document per patient) was used
in the time expression annotation task for creating
our corpus.

2.2 Time Expression Annotations

As a first step for the extraction of psychosis
symptom onset, it is necessary to identify all the
time expressions occurring inside the text (e.g.,
May 2012, a year ago). These expressions can
then be used at a later stage, to link each men-
tioned symptom to the corresponding date or time.

To enable the development of an accurate tem-
poral extraction system, we manually annotated
the available corpus with occurrences of time ex-
pressions, marking both TIMEX spans and types
(e.g., Date). To facilitate this task, we pre-
pared domain-specific annotation guidelines, in-
spired by the guidelines used in the 2012 i2b2
challenge (Sun et al., 2013a) and the THYME
project (Styler IV et al., 2014).

In addition, we performed a comparative analy-
sis with existing corpora (i2b2 2012 and Clinical
TempEval 2016), to highlight similarities and dif-
ferences, and to gain deeper knowledge in domain-
specific characteristics related to how time infor-
mation is documented in clinical text.

Comparison to Related Corpora and
Guidelines Adaptation
Both the i2b2 2012 and the Clinical TempEval
2016 corpora are characterized by relatively short
notes, with content organized in semi-structured
sections (e.g., “History of present illness”, “Hos-
pital course”). To develop guidelines tailored
to the mental health domain, we manually re-
viewed a few example documents to identify ini-
tial domain-specific requirements. In our corpus,
most documents have few or no systematic sec-
tion, with clinical and temporal information scat-
tered across many different paragraphs. Moreover,
symptoms and their onset are frequently associ-
ated to vague dates, as opposed to most events
documented within the ICU and the oncology do-
main (e.g., problems, exams, operations). As
a consequence, we found that the examples in-
cluded in the i2b2 2012 and THYME guidelines
did not capture all the time expressions that are
typical of the mental health domain, and we de-

cided to adapt them in order to simplify and clar-
ify the annotation task. First, we only kept the
TIMEX types that were relevant to the considered
clinical use-case4: Date (e.g., in May 2012, yes-
terday), Time (e.g., in the morning, 3 pm), Du-
ration (e.g., for three years, over the past two
weeks), and Frequency (e.g., daily, twice a week).
Within Dates, we explicitly included generic ex-
pressions such as past and current, to enable tem-
poral contextualization of events that cannot be an-
chored to specific TIMEXes. As for Frequencies,
we put a particular focus on medication-related
TIMEXes and domain-specific expressions (e.g.,
OD for “once daily”). We also defined an addi-
tional TIMEX type for “age-related” expressions,
to capture clinically relevant temporal patient in-
formation. Although this type is not included in
common TimeML models, it has been previously
investigated as it can encompass relevant tempo-
ral information in a clinical setting (Wang et al.,
2016). In this study, besides looking at the pa-
tient’s current age (e.g., 28-year-old man), we in-
cluded all the expressions that rely on the date of
birth in order to be correctly normalized (see Sec-
tion 3.1). The final guidelines, which were writ-
ten and revised by two NLP researchers, describe:
the annotation task and goal, the TimeML TIMEX
types (with sentences taken from the reference
guidelines), and the domain-specific TIMEX types
and examples.

Annotation Process
Annotations were carried out by three medical stu-
dents, using the eHOST annotation tool (South
et al., 2012). The students were all native En-
glish speakers and in their 1st-3rd year of med-
ical studies. The corpus was randomly divided
into five batches of documents (9-13 documents
in each batch), and each batch was independently
annotated by two different annotators. After the
completion of the first batch (development set, 10
documents), we jointly discussed issues that had
arisen during the annotation process, to refine and
reach a consensus on improvements and edits in
the guidelines. As a result, we added specific rules
for the time expressions that had caused disagree-
ments, and removed ambiguous sentences and ex-
amples. For instance, we found that “dates” and
“durations” were sometimes hard to distinguish,
and created specific rules to disambiguate those

4PrePostExp and Quantifier TIMEX types were not con-
sidered.



186

(e.g., over the last week should be annotated as
a Duration, and not a Date). The updated guide-
lines were then applied to annotate the remaining
documents. When all batches had been double-
annotated, we carried out an adjudication phase in
order to create a gold standard corpus. The adjudi-
cator decided which annotations to include in the
gold standard in case of disagreement between an-
notators, added missing annotations and omitted
or corrected erroneous ones.

2.3 Automated Time Expression Extraction

In this study, we explored two well-known time
expression taggers, SUTime (Chang and Manning,
2012) and HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2010),
which were developed and evaluated on general
domain corpora. When applied to the TempEval-
2 newspaper data, both systems achieved state-
of-the-art performance (F1 scores of 92% and
86%, respectively, for time expression identifica-
tion) (Verhagen et al., 2010). Moreover, they have
previously been used for the automatic processing
of clinical narratives (Jindal and Roth, 2013; Wang
et al., 2016).

Both SUTime and HeidelTime use a list of pat-
tern matching rules, built on regular expressions,
to recognize and normalize time expressions in-
side the text. As a main difference, while SUTime
links relative TIMEXes (such as yesterday) to the
document creation date, HeidelTime uses different
normalization strategies depending on documents’
types (e.g., news, narratives).

To adapt the systems to the mental health do-
main, we first evaluated their original versions
on the development set5, to see what the in-
crease in performance over non-domain-specific
rules would be. Then, we manually reviewed
the TIMEXes present in the development set, and
modified and added rules as needed. The perfor-
mance of the updated systems was then evaluated
on a validation set, consisting of two batches (23
documents in total). To allow for future develop-
ment and evaluation, we did not use the remain-
ing batches (test set, 19 documents) in this study.
The documents we used to adapt and evaluate the
temporal taggers were from the adjudicated gold
standard corpus.

5To compute the performance of the original systems,
we used: the SUTime grammar included in the Stanford
CoreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ ) distribu-
tion dated 2017-06-09, and the HeidelTime resources in-
cluded in the GATE (https://gate.ac.uk/ ) distribution 8.3.

2.4 Evaluation Metrics

To assess the quality of the developed corpus,
we calculated inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for
each annotated batch, using the metrics that were
used for i2b2 2012 (average of precision and
recall) and Clinical TempEval 2016 (F1 score).
First, we computed the average of precision and
recall: the entities marked by one annotator were
used as the gold reference, while the entities iden-
tified by the second annotator were considered
as the system’s output (switching these two roles
would not change the final result). Moreover, we
measured the F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of
precision and recall), which provides a good way
to quantify agreement for entity extraction tasks
(Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005).

To evaluate the performance of SUTime and
HeidelTime, we defined: (i) true positives (TP),
as the gold TIMEXes that were found in the sys-
tem’s output; (ii) false negatives (FN), as the gold
TIMEXes that were not found in the system’s out-
put; and (iii) false positives (FP), as the system
TIMEXes that were not found among gold an-
notations. In this case, we assessed the system’s
performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1
score.

3 Results

3.1 Time Expression Annotations

The total number of gold TIMEXes in our cor-
pus is 3,413, with an average of 65.6 annotations
per document6. Table 1 reports the prevalence
of TIMEX types in the corpus, divided into de-
velopment, validation, and test sets. Overall, the
majority of TIMEXes are represented by Dates
(55.8%). Durations, Times, and Frequencies ac-
count for 16.5%, 10.7%, and 8.1%, respectively.

As mentioned, we defined a new TIMEX type
referring to the patient’s age: “Age-related”. This
type was assigned to 8.9% of all TIMEXes. Some
examples include:

• at the age of 8: requires adding 8 years to the
date of birth for normalization;

• when he was a child: requires the date of
birth and a shared definition of “child years”
for normalization;

6Annotators worked 20-24 hours, and annotated 2/3 of the
corpus each (33-39 docs): the average time required for cor-
pus development was around 35-40 minutes per document.

malization;

• during his first year (implicitly referring to
the first year of university): requires the date

normalization;

With respect to IAA, we computed results on
TIMEX spans (without considering the different
TIMEX types, as this was not calculated for the
corpora used for comparison), for both partial and
exact matches. In the first case, the average of pre-
cision and recall was 78%, and the F1 score was
77%. In the second case, both metrics resulted in
60%.

For partial matches, the IAA per batch was
in the range of 73.6%-83.7% (average of preci-
sion and recall), and 73.5%-83.3% (F1 score).
We also computed the percentage of TIMEX type
matches for those time expressions that the anno-
tators agreed on with respect to overlapping spans,
resulting in 91% percentage match.

3.2 Comparison to Related Corpora
In Table 2, our corpus is compared to the i2b2
2012 and the Clinical TempEval 2016 corpora.
Specifically, the table reports the size, the num-
ber of TIMEXes, the type prevalence7, and the
IAA values for the three considered corpora. To
allow comparing TIMEX types among these cor-
pora, we merged Clinical TempEval annotations as
follows: PrePostExp time expressions were con-
sidered among Dates, while Quantifier time ex-
pressions were considered as Frequencies. No
modifications were required in order to compare
the i2b2 2012 corpus. Also, since we added the

cal TempEval 2016.

new TIMEX type Age related, we were not able
to compare these annotations in either corpus.

3.3 Temporal Expression Extraction System
Adaptation

In this work, we used SUTime and HeidelTime to
identify TIMEX spans in the developed corpus8.
The results of this domain adaptation are shown
in Table 3. First, we ran the original versions of
the two systems on the development set, obtain-
ing an F1 score of 72.5% for SUTime and 63.6%
for HeidelTime (allowing partial matches). As ex-
pected, these scores are much lower than those ob-
tained on general domain corpora (92% and 86%
F1 scores on TempEval-2 newspaper data). Af-
ter tuning the systems’ rules on the development
set, we achieved scores of 79.7% and 77.3%, re-
spectively. By running the updated systems on the
validation set, we obtained a final result of 79.5%
and 75.8%, respectively.

It is important to mention that, although the
original version of SUTime included rules to cap-
ture some “age” expressions (e.g., 28-year-old),
these were considered as Durations. In the original
version of HeidelTime, instead, these expressions
were explicitly excluded, as they were probably
not considered as proper time expressions. This
is one of the reasons why the original version of
HeidelTime had much lower recall than SUTime
(Table 3, “HeidelTime original” row).

4 Discussion

Extracting temporal information from mental
health records is particularly challenging, as this
domain is characterized by a large proportion of
free-text and heterogeneity in self-reported expe-
riences (i.e., mental health symptoms), circum-

8For determining Age-related TIMEXes, we applied a set
of post-processing rules to the output of the two temporal tag-
gers.

stances (e.g., social support networks, recent or
past stressful experiences, psychoactive substance
use), and treatment and outcomes. In this study,
we annotated time expressions related to patients
with schizophrenia in EHRs. The documents
in our corpus are long when compared to sim-
ilar corpora (3,974 tokens/doc), and include a
large proportion of relevant time expressions (65.6
TIMEXes/doc). In addition, they might con-
tain information taken from structured forms (e.g.,
questions, references to health care legislation),
which are not relevant to the patient’s clinical his-
tory, but could still include references to time.

4.1 Comparison to Related Corpora

When comparing our corpus to other related cor-
pora, there are differences in the documentation
types that can have an impact on the develop-
ment of temporal information extraction systems.
For instance, the discharge summaries in the 2012
i2b2 corpus each start with the admission and dis-
charge date, which are annotated as TIMEXes.

Similarly, the Clinical TempEval 2016 documents
are organized in sections with semi-structured date
information, that can be useful to then link and an-
chor clinically relevant events in the documents.
The documents in our corpus, on the contrary, in-
clude various paragraphs describing both past and
current events related to the patient, without nec-
essarily following a predefined structure.

Regarding TIMEX types, there was a greater
prevalence of Date expressions in the i2b2 2012
(ICU domain) and Clinical TempEval 2016 (on-
cology domain) corpora, as compared to our cor-
pus (Table 2). This might relate to the fact that,
in the ICU and oncology clinical settings, treat-
ment episodes are likely to be shorter and changes
in physical health parameters and onset/duration
of treatment occur over shorter periods of time.
As another interesting observation, our corpus is
characterized by a higher prevalence of the Time
type, which is probably due to the fact that many
events are described as happening at a specific
time of day (this morning, at night). It is important



189

to point out that in both i2b2 2012 and Clinical
TempEval 2016, age-related information was not
marked. One reason for this might be that these
types of constructs were not considered useful for
the use-cases that these corpora were developed
for.

As regards the IAA, we obtained a value
of 60%/78% (strict/partial) for the average of
precision and recall, and a value of 60%/77%
(strict/partial) for the F1 score. Although these re-
sults are lower in comparison to those of i2b2 2012
and Clinical TempEval 2016 (Table 2), this can be
considered a promising result, given the intrinsic
complexity of the mental health domain. As an
important remark, the difference between partial
and strict IAA measures indicates that identifying
the spans of time expressions is not straightfor-
ward. This is also reflected in the results obtained
on the i2b2 2012 corpus. In our case, the main rea-
son for disagreement was the inclusion/exclusion
of prepositions or determiners in TIMEX spans
(e.g., for three years instead of three years). We
also analyzed disagreements in TIMEX type as-
signments. Differentiating between Date and Du-
ration was one of the main disagreements (ac-
counting for 42% of disagreements). For instance,
an expression like this week was assigned Date (in-
terpreted as a point in time) by one annotator, and
Duration (interpreted as a period) by another.

4.2 Domain-specific Time Expressions
As an interesting result of the annotation task, we
identified a set of time expressions which were not
present in the other corpora, but which are essen-
tial to allow capturing symptom onset. As previ-
ously mentioned, these expressions are those re-
lated to the age of the patient, which account for
8.9% of all TIMEXes (Table 1). Despite not be-
ing particularly frequent, Age-related TIMEXes
can be crucial to determine the first onset of symp-
toms, which is often reported by patients or their
relatives in a vague way. For example, extract-
ing these kinds of expressions is essential for sen-
tences like9:

• she first experienced hallucinations at the
age of 18

• he started hearing voices when he was 15

• he has been experiencing these symptoms
since his teens

9The reported sentences have been paraphrased.

Besides defining a new TIMEX type, we also
found some example TIMEXes that are specific to
the analyzed domain and were not present in the
compared corpora. As a first example, we iden-
tified a few expressions that are related to drug
prescriptions, such as OD (i.e., once daily) and
NOCTE (i.e., every night). Moreover, we noticed
that the expression 15 minute is often used as a
Frequency, rather than a Duration, as this is the
usual interval of time used to observe patients with
schizophrenia (e.g., “he was placed on 15 minute
visual observations”). Determining the correct in-
terpretation is not straightforward, as this relies
on domain knowledge (in the sentence I went for
a 15-minute walk, the same TIMEX represents a
Duration). As another interesting example, we re-
alized that, in the field of mental health, the ex-
pressions /7, /12, and /52 can be used to refer to
days (3/7 ago = three days ago), months (for 3/12
= for three months), and weeks (in 2/52 = in two
weeks), respectively. In our corpus, we found a
total of 12 expressions of this kind (4 Dates, 6 Du-
rations, and 2 Age related). To normalize them, it
is possible to create specific rules that map the dif-
ferent patterns to the corresponding temporal val-
ues.

4.3 Time Expression System Adaptation

We applied SUTime and HeidelTime on the devel-
opment set through an iterative process (Table 3).
By running the two original versions of the sys-
tems, we found that SUTime performed better than
HeidelTime, especially in terms of recall (73.6%
versus 57.2%): this is probably due to the fact that,
in our annotation schema, we included a few ex-
pressions which were already taken into account
by the first system, but not by the second (e.g.,
28 years old, past). In the adaptation process, we
identified false negatives (FNs) for both systems,
and then refined rules to capture them. It is im-
portant to point out that, in this preliminary exper-
iment, we focused on improving the systems’ per-
formance for partial matches, rather than identify-
ing exact TIMEX spans. While a few of the per-
formed adaptations involved general domain rules
(e.g., dates in the form “dd/MM” were not recog-
nized by SUTime), we mostly needed to address
TIMEXes specific to the mental health domain.
By adding extraction rules for these expressions,
we were able to reduce the number of FNs, thus
obtaining an improvement in recall from 73.6%



190

to 87.8%, for SUTime, and from 57.2% to 81.3%
for HeidelTime (development set). As for preci-
sion, lowering the number of FPs was not triv-
ial, as these rule-based systems cannot distinguish
between time expressions that are patient-related
(thus relevant to our goal) and those that are not
(e.g., form-related).

After an error analysis, we found a few non-
trivial TIMEXes that were not correctly captured
by the system and will require further adapta-
tion/improvement. For instance, SUTime was not
able to identify age-related expressions like be-
tween the ages of 10 and 12 and Time intervals
like 9.30-10. On the other hand, ambiguous words
such as present (as in present at the appointment)
and minutes (as in minutes of the meeting) were
erroneously considered as TIMEXes. Also, all the
time expressions that were included in form-like
paragraphs (e.g., The Activities of Daily Living in-
clude...) were counted among false positives, as
we were not interested in extracting these.

In this study, the best final F1 score was ob-
tained with the adapted version of SUTime (79.5%
on the validation set), which represents a promis-
ing result if compared to the IAA of 77% (F1
score). This could reflect the fact that time expres-
sions often follow specific patterns: by adequately
tuning extraction rules, it is possible to obtain a
good extraction performance, which can be even
higher than that of a human annotator (this is par-
ticularly true for recall).

4.4 Limitations and Future Work

As a main limitation of this work, we only ad-
dressed the extraction of TIMEX spans and types,
without dealing with TIMEX value normaliza-
tion, which would require assigning a standardized
value to each TIMEX. For instance, the expression
for three years should be normalized as P3Y, while
the expression at the age of 8 would require the
date of birth in order to be correctly normalized.
We are in the process of extending our TIMEX an-
notations with normalized values. In future work,
we will use these annotations to develop suitable
rules for time expression extraction and value nor-
malization. Moreover, while adapting TIMEX ex-
traction systems, we did not write contextual rules
to disambiguate expressions that can belong to dif-
ferent types depending on their context, although
we did disambiguate these during manual annota-
tion (e.g., at night was marked as a Time, when

referring to a single episode, or as a Frequency,
when referring to a drug prescription). As a future
improvement, we will address this task by dealing
with the context in which time expressions appear,
for example, by using word embeddings to repre-
sent each word with automatically derived contex-
tual features (Mikolov et al., 2013). Finally, since
we are interested in assessing the usability of SU-
Time and HeidelTime in other clinical domains,
we plan to extend the adaptability study presented
in this work to other clinical corpora, such as the
i2b2 and Clinical TempEval corpora used for com-
parison here.

As previously mentioned, the extraction of time
expressions represents a first step towards our final
goal, i.e., the identification of symptom onset and
DUP in free text. The next step will involve the an-
notation of clinically relevant entities (symptoms
primarily), to be linked to the available temporal
information. Extracting entities such as symptoms
could be done by knowledge-based approaches
based on keyword lists, or using word embedding
models (or a combination of both). We are cur-
rently exploring different alternatives. As for tem-
poral linking, we will need to refer each clinical
entity to a specific time expression. For example,
given the sentence he first experienced hallucina-
tions in 2008, the following link should be identi-
fied: “{2008} CONTAINS {hallucinations}”. To
reach this goal, we are currently experimenting
with the annotation of a set of documents, where
relevant events and time expressions have been
pre-annotated by using automatic approaches.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we described the annotation of time
expressions in mental health records related to
schizophrenia, thus creating an annotated corpus.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gold
standard developed in this domain for a specific
mental health use-case: onset and DUP extrac-
tion. In addition, this is the first study explic-
itly incorporating age-related information, which
is not captured by current temporal models. As an
important aspect, we also assessed the adaptabil-
ity of two existing rule-based TIMEX extraction
systems to the new analyzed use-case, obtaining
promising results.

Due to governance regulations, the corpus an-
notated in this study cannot be made publicly
available. However, there are procedures in place



191

to provide researchers with controlled access to
the CRIS database. Moreover, the developed
guidelines and the adapted versions of SUTime
and HeidelTime have been made publicly avail-
able10, and could be easily reused or adapted for
other temporal information extraction tasks.
