Abstract

The recently introduced BERT model exhibits
strong performance on several language un-
derstanding benchmarks. In this paper, we
describe a simple re-implementation of BERT
for commonsense reasoning. We show that the
attentions produced by BERT can be directly
utilized for tasks such as the Pronoun Dis-
ambiguation Problem and Winograd Schema
Challenge. Our proposed attention-guided
commonsense reasoning method is conceptu-
ally simple yet empirically powerful. Exper-
imental analysis on multiple datasets demon-
strates that our proposed system performs re-
markably well on all cases while outperform-
ing the previously reported state of the art by
a margin. While results suggest that BERT
seems to implicitly learn to establish complex
relationships between entities, solving com-
monsense reasoning tasks might require more
than unsupervised models learned from huge
text corpora.

1 Introduction

Recently, neural models pre-trained on a lan-
guage modeling task, such as ELMo (Peters et al.,
2018b), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), have achieved impres-
sive results on various natural language processing
tasks such as question-answering and natural lan-
guage inference. The success of BERT can largely
be associated to the notion of context-aware word
embeddings, which differentiate it from common
approaches such as word2vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) that establish a static semantic embedding.
Since the introduction of BERT, the NLP com-
munity continues to be impressed by the amount
of ideas produced on top of this powerful lan-
guage representation model. However, despite
its success, it remains unclear whether the repre-
sentations produced by BERT can be utilized for

tasks such as commonsense reasoning. Particu-
larly, it is not clear whether BERT shed light on
solving tasks such as the Pronoun Disambigua-
tion Problem (PDP) and Winograd Schema Chal-
lenge (WSC). These tasks have been proposed as
potential alternatives to the Turing Test, because
they are formulated to be robust to statistics of
word co-occurrence (Levesque et al., 2012).

Below is a popular example from the binary-
choice pronoun coreference problem (Lee et al.,
2017) of WSC:

Sentence: The trophy doesn't fit in the suit-
case because it is too small.
Answers: A) the trophy B) the suitcase

Humans resolve the pronoun “it” to “the suit-
case” with no difficulty, whereas a system without
commonsense reasoning would be unable to dis-
tinguish “the suitcase” from the otherwise viable
candidate, “the trophy”.

Previous attempts at solving WSC usually in-
volve heavy utilization of annotated knowledge
bases (KB), rule-based reasoning, or hand-crafted
features (Peng et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2015;
Schüller, 2014; Sharma et al., 2015; Morgenstern
et al., 2016). There are also some empirical
works towards solving WSC making use of learn-
ing (Rahman and Ng, 2012; Tang et al., 2018;
Radford et al., 2018). Recently, (Trinh and Le,
2018) proposed to use a language model (LM)
to score the two sentences obtained when replac-
ing the pronoun by the two candidates. The sen-
tence that is assigned higher probability under the
model designates the chosen candidate. Probabil-
ity is calculated via the chain rule, as the prod-
uct of the probabilities assigned to each word in
the sentence. Very recently, (Emami et al., 2018)
proposed the knowledge hunting method, which
is a rule-based system that uses search engines

to gather evidence for the candidate resolutions
without relying on the entities themselves. Al-
though these methods are interesting, they need
fine-tuning, or explicit substitution or heuristic-
based rules. See also (Trichelair et al., 2018) for
a discussion.

The BERT model is based on the “Transformer”
architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which relies
purely on attention mechanisms, and does not have
an explicit notion of word order beyond mark-
ing each word with its absolute-position embed-
ding. This reliance on attention may lead one to
expect decreased performance on commonsense
reasoning tasks (Roemmele et al., 2011; Zellers
et al., 2018) compared to RNN (LSTM) mod-
els (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that do
model word order directly, and explicitly track
states across the sentence. However, the work
of (Peters et al., 2018a) suggests that bidirectional
language models such as BERT implicitly capture
some notion of coreference resolution.

In this paper, we show that the attention maps
created by an out-of-the-box BERT can be directly
exploited to resolve coreferences in long sen-
tences. As such, they can be simply repurposed for
the sake of commonsense reasoning tasks while
achieving state-of-the-art results on the multiple
task. On both PDP and WSC, our method out-
performs previous state-of-the-art methods, with-
out using expensive annotated knowledge bases or

hand-engineered features. On a Pronoun Disam-
biguation dataset, PDP-60, our method achieves
68.3% accuracy, which is better than the state-of-
art accuracy of 66.7%. On a WSC dataset, WSC-
273, our method achieves 60.3%. As of today,
state-of-the-art accuracy on the WSC-273 for sin-
gle model performance is around 57%, (Emami
et al., 2018) and (Trinh and Le, 2018). These re-
sults suggest that BERT implicitly learns to estab-
lish complex relationships between entities such
as coreference resolution. Although this helps in
commonsense reasoning, solving this task requires
more than employing a language model learned
from large text corpora.

2 Attention Guided Reasoning

In this section we first review the main aspects of
the BERT approach, which are important to un-
derstand our proposal and we introduce notations
used in the rest of the paper. Then, we intro-
duce Maximum Attention Score (MAS), and ex-
plain how it can be utilized for commonsense rea-
soning.

2.1 BERT and Notation

The concept of BERT is built upon two key in-
gredients: (a) the transformer architecture and (b)
unsupervised pre-training.

The transformer architecture consists of two
main building blocks, stacked encoders and de-

coders, which are connected in a cascaded fash-
ion. The encoder is further divided into two com-
ponents, namely a self-attention layer and a feed-
forward neural network. The self-attention allows
for attending to specific words during encoding
and therefore establishing a focus context w.r.t. to
each word. In contrast to that, the decoder has an
additional encoder-decoder layer that switches be-
tween self-attention and a feed-forward network.
It allows the decoder to attend to specific parts of
the input sequence. As attention allows for es-
tablishing a relationship between words, it is very
important for tasks such as coreference resolution
and finding associations. In the specific context of
pronouns, attention gives rise to links to m candi-
date nouns, which we denote in the following as
C = {c1, .., cm}. The concept of self-attention is
further expanded within BERT by the idea of so
called multi-head outputs that are incorporated in
each layer. In the following, we will denote heads

and layers with h ∈ H and l ∈ L, respectively.
Multi-heads serve several purposes. On the one
hand, they allow for dispersing the focus on mul-
tiple positions. On the other hand, they consti-
tute an enriched representation by expanding the
embedding space. Leveraging the nearly unlim-
ited amount of data available, BERT learns two
novel unsupervised prediction tasks during train-
ing. One of the tasks is to predict tokens that were
randomly masked given the context, notably with
the context being established in a bi-directional
manner. The second task constitutes next sen-
tence prediction, whereby BERT learns the re-
lationship between two sentences, and classifies
whether they are consecutive.

2.2 Maximum Attention Score (MAS)

In order to exploit the associative leverage of self-
attention, the computation of MAS follows the no-
tion of max-pooling on attention level between a
reference word s (e.g. pronoun) and candidate
words c (e.g. multiple choice pronouns). The
proposed approach takes as input the BERT at-
tention tensor and produces for each candidate
word a score, which indicates the strength of as-
sociation. To this end, the BERT attention ten-
sor A ∈ RH×L×|C| is sliced into several matrices
Ac ∈ RH×L, each of them corresponding to the
attention between the reference word and a candi-
date c. Each Ac is associated with a binary mask
matrix Mc. The mask values of Mc are obtained

Mc(l, h) =

1 argmaxA(l, h) = c

0 otherwise
(1)

Mask entries are non-zero only at locations where
the candidate word c is associated with maxi-
mum attention. Limiting the impact of attention
by masking allows to accommodate for the most
salient parts. Given the Ac and Mc matrix pair
for each candidate c, the MAS can be computed.
For this purpose, the sum of the Hadamard product
for each pair is calculated first. Next, the actual
score is obtained by computing the ratio of each
Hadamard sum w.r.t. all others according to,

MAS(c) =

∑
l,hAc ◦Mc∑

∑

l,hAc ◦Mc

Thus MAS retains the attention of each candidate
only where it is most dominant, coupling it with
the notion of frequency of occurrence to weight
the importance. See Fig. 1 for a schematic illustra-
tion of the computation of MAS, and the matrices
involved.

3 Experimental Results

We evaluate our method on two commonsense rea-
soning tasks, PDP and WSC.

On the former task, we use the original set of
60 questions (PDP-60) as the main benchmark.
The second task (WSC-273) is qualitatively much
more difficult. The recent best reported result are
not much above random guess. This task con-
sists of 273 questions and is designed to work
against traditional linguistic techniques, common
heuristics or simple statistical tests over text cor-
pora (Levesque et al., 2012).

3.1 BERT Model Details

In all our experiments, we used the out-of-the-
box BERT models without any task-specific fine-
tuning. Specifically, we use the PyTorch imple-
mentation of pre-trained bert − base − uncased
models supplied by Google1. This model has 12
layers (i.e., Transformer blocks), a hidden size of
768, and 12 self-attention heads. In all cases we
set the feed-forward/filter size to be 3072 for the
hidden size of 768. The total number of parame-
ters of the model is 110M.

3.2 Pronoun Disambiguation Problem

We first examine our method on PDP-60 for the
Pronoun Disambiguation task. In Tab. 1 (top),
our method outperforms all previous unsupervised
results sharply. Next, we allow other systems to
take in necessary components to maximize their
test performance. This includes making use of
supervised training data that maps commonsense
reasoning questions to their correct answer. As re-
ported in Tab. 1 (bottom), our method outperforms
the best system in the 2016 competition (58.3%)
by a large margin. Specifically, we achieve 68.3%
accuracy, better than the more recently reported re-
sults from (Liu et al., 2017) (66.7%), who makes
use of three KBs and a supervised deep network.

3.3 Winograd Schema Challenge

On the harder task WSC-273, our method also out-
performs the current state-of-the-art, as shown in
Tab. 2. Namely, our method achieves an accu-
racy of 60.3%, nearly 3% of accuracy above the

previous best result. This is a drastic improve-
ment considering the best system based on lan-
guage models outperforms random guess by only
4% in accuracy. This task is more difficult than
PDP-60. First, the overall performance of all com-
peting systems are much lower than that of PDP-
60. Second, incorporating supervised learning and
expensive annotated KBs to USSM provides in-
significant gain this time (+3%), comparing to the
large gain on PDP-60 (+19%). Finally, for the
sake of completeness, (Trinh and Le, 2018) re-
port that their single language model trained on
a customized dataset built from CommonCrawl
based on questions used in comonsense reasoning
achieves an higher accuracy than the proposed ap-
proach with 62.6%.

We visualize the MAS to have more insights
into the decisions of our resolvers. Fig. 2 displays
some samples of correct and incorrect decisions
made by our proposed method. MAS score of dif-
ferent words are indicated with colors, where the
gradient from blue to red represents the score tran-
sition from low to high.

4 Discussion

Pursuing commonsense reasoning in a purely un-
supervised way seems very attractive for several
reasons. On the one hand, this implies tapping
the nearly unlimited resources of unannotated text
and leveraging the wealth of information therein.
On the other hand, tackling the commonsense rea-
soning objective in a (more) supervised fashion
typically seems to boost performance for very a
specific task as concurrent work shows (Kocijan
et al., 2019). However, the latter approach is un-
likely to generalize well beyond this task. That
is because covering the complete set of common-
sense entities is at best extremely hard to achieve,
if possible at all. The data-driven paradigm en-
tails that the derived model can only make gen-
eralizations based on the data it has observed.
Consequently, a supervised machine learning ap-
proach will have to be exposed to all combina-
tions, i.e. replacing lexical items with semanti-
cally similar items in order to derive various con-
cept notions. Generally, this is prohibitively ex-
pensive and therefore not viable. In contrast, in
the proposed (unsupervised self-attention guided)
approach this problem is alleviated. This can be
largely attributed to the nearly unlimited text cor-
pora on which the model originally learns, which

makes it likely to cover a multitude of concept re-
lations, and the fact that attention implicitly re-
duces the search space. However, all these ap-
proaches require the answer to explicitly exist in
the text. That is, they are unable to resolve pro-
nouns in light of abstract/implicit referrals that re-
quire background knowledge - see (Saba, 2018)
for more detail. However, this is beyond the task
of WSC. Last, the presented results suggest that
BERT models the notion of complex relationship
between entities, facilitating commonsense rea-
soning to a certain degree.

5 Conclusion

Attracted by the success of recently proposed lan-
guage representation model BERT, in this pa-
per, we introduce a simple yet effective re-
implementation of BERT for commonsense rea-
soning. Specifically, we propose a method which
exploits the attentions produced by BERT for the
challenging tasks of PDP and WSC. The exper-
imental analysis demonstrates that our proposed
system outperforms the previous state of the art
on multiple datasets. However, although BERT
seems to implicitly establish complex relation-
ships between entities facilitating tasks such as
coreference resolution, the results also suggest
that solving commonsense reasoning tasks might
require more than leveraging a language model
trained on huge text corpora. Future work will en-
tail adaption of the attentions, to further improve
the performance.
