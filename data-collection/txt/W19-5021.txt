Abstract

To automatically analyse complex trajectory
information enclosed in clinical text (e.g. tim-
ing of symptoms, duration of treatment), it is
important to understand the related temporal
aspects, anchoring each event on an absolute
point in time. In the clinical domain, few
temporally annotated corpora are currently
available. Moreover, underlying annotation
schemas - which mainly rely on the TimeML
standard - are not necessarily easily applicable
for applications such as patient timeline recon-
struction. In this work, we investigated how
temporal information is documented in clini-
cal text by annotating a corpus of medical re-
ports with time expressions (TIMEXes), based
on TimeML. The developed corpus is avail-
able to the NLP community. Starting from our
annotations, we analysed the suitability of the
TimeML TIMEX schema for capturing time-
line information, identifying challenges and
possible solutions. As a result, we propose
a novel annotation schema that could be use-
ful for timeline reconstruction: CALendar EX-
pression (CALEX).

1 Introduction and Background

When applying natural language processing
(NLP) methods to the analysis of clinical notes,
understanding the temporal aspects of narratives
is crucial (e.g. when the patient experienced a cer-
tain symptom, or when a particular drug was pre-
scribed). To model and extract the temporal in-
formation enclosed in free text, the development
of suitable annotation schemas and reliably anno-
tated corpora is essential.

The TimeML specification language was devel-
oped to enable the recognition of events and their
temporal ordering in general-domain texts (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003a). In the original schema,
four major elements are modelled: time expres-

sions (TIMEXes), events, signals, and their re-
lations. Signals are function words (e.g. “dur-
ing”, “before”) that indicate how temporal objects
can be related to each other. Relations are rep-
resented by either temporal links (e.g. “before”,
“simultaneous”), subordination links (e.g. “inten-
sional”, “factive”), or aspectual links (e.g. “initi-
ates, “continues”). The TimeML schema was used
to develop the TimeBank corpus, consisting of 183
news articles (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b). Gold an-
notations were reused in the TempEval tasks on
temporal information extraction (Verhagen et al.,
2007; Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009), where a
simplified TimeML annotation was applied.

The TimeML specification language provides
a standard model for the mark-up of time ex-
pressions (with type Date, Time, Duration, or
Set), events (mostly verbs or noun phrases), and
their temporal ordering (Pustejovsky et al., 2010),
and it can be in principle applied to any type of
text. In the clinical domain, two reference cor-
pora based on TimeML are available. The 2012
i2b2 corpus (310 discharge summaries) includes
annotations for time expressions, clinical events,
and eight types of temporal relations (Sun et al.,
2013a). In addition, a section time (SECTIME) is
used to keep track of section creation dates. The
THYME corpus (1,254 oncology notes) contains
annotations for events, time expressions (with two
additional types), and 5 types of temporal rela-
tions (Styler IV et al., 2014). In this corpus, narra-
tive containers were introduced, representing tem-
poral buckets (mostly dates) containing a set of
events. Figure 1 provides a graphical representa-
tion of the main changes introduced by i2b2 2012
and THYME on the original TimeML model.

Most clinical NLP development based on avail-
able corpora have focused on the three separate
main tasks: detecting and classifying 1) events and

2) time expressions (and their attributes), and 3)
classifying temporal links (TLINKs) (Sun et al.,
2013b; Bethard et al., 2016, 2017). However,
these separate tasks do not directly address the
problem of anchoring events on an absolute time-
line, which would be important for an improved
understanding of patient trajectories. Moreover,
mainly due to the inherent complexity of identi-
fying temporal links (which can exist between any
pair of entities and with different types), temporal
annotation becomes a challenging task.

A few studies have proposed alternate ap-
proaches or extensions to the TimeML model
for temporal ordering of events in various do-
mains (Chambers et al., 2014; Jeblee and Hirst,
2018; Kolomiyets et al., 2012; Raghavan et al.,
2014), but without addressing timeline reconstruc-
tion, i.e. anchoring events in absolute time. An
approach that aimed to anchor events in time
and simplify the annotation task was proposed
by Reimers et al. (2016, 2018), where the event
time is modelled as an argument of the event men-
tion. However, the emphasis lies on the events, not
on time expressions. Another approach proposed
by Zhao et al. (2012) focuses on an alternative way
to normalise time expressions using time intervals,
allowing for more efficient temporal reasoning.

The existing temporally annotated corpora for
the clinical domain have not, to our knowledge,
been studied in great detail with respect to time-
line reconstruction, particularly as regards TIMEX
annotations. Tissot et al. (2015) found a surpris-
ing number of repeated inconsistencies between

the guidelines and the manually created corpora
for certain regular and unambiguous temporal lan-
guage constructs. These were mainly related to
inconsistencies in span and class assignments, in-
correct annotations (false positives) or missing an-
notations (false negatives). This evidences how
hard it is to create coherent annotated resources,
and how NLP development and evaluation can be
affected by the quality of the underlying data.

To further support the growth of clinical-
temporal NLP and the development of transla-
tional applications, the release of additional an-
notated corpora (including different clinical spe-
cialties) is needed. Moreover, despite the efforts
put into creating resources like the i2b2 2012 and
THYME corpora, the suitability of the underly-
ing annotation schemas to support clinical time-
line reconstruction has not been widely investi-
gated. While some types of TIMEXes are defi-
nitely useful to anchor clinical events on a time-
line (e.g. explicit references to the calendar, like
in February 2009), the importance of capturing
other entities (e.g. the frequency of medication in-
take) remains unclear. Moreover, there might be
TIMEX types that could be relevant in the clinical
domain, but are not currently considered by tem-
poral models based on TimeML, e.g. age-related
expressions. As another important point, the way
in which TIMEXes are typically normalised is
not necessarily optimal for timeline reconstruction
(e.g. duration values such as "P4M" cannot be im-
mediately placed on a timeline).

Our intuition is that, by changing the way time
expressions are defined and normalised, tempo-
ral relation annotation could be much simplified.
More specifically, adding timeline information at
the time expression level could help to tempo-
rally anchor entities without the need for multiple
types of temporal links. To assess this, we applied
a TimeML-based TIMEX annotation schema on
a corpus of clinical texts, investigating how time
expression information is documented, and then
analysed how it can be reused for timeline recon-
struction. As a result, we created a corpus of clini-
cal texts (for four different clinical specialties), an-
notated with TIMEXes which mostly relies on the
TimeML schema. This corpus is publicly avail-
able, as an additional resource that could be reused
for temporal NLP.1 In this paper, we analyse the
suitability of these TIMEXes for timeline recon-

struction, and from this analysis propose an in-
novative way to annotate temporal information in
free text: CALendar EXpressions (CALEX).

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Dataset
We downloaded and extracted documents from
MTSamples,2 a collection of Medical Transcrip-
tion Sample reports for multiple clinical special-
ties (where the same document can belong to dif-
ferent groups), created for educational purposes
and for working transcriptionists.

In the MTSamples resource, there is no avail-
ability of document creation times (DCTs). Most
documents follow a semi-structured format, in-
cluding different section headings/textual con-
tent depending on the specific clinical specialty.
We selected the following specialties for man-
ual annotation and analysis: discharge summaries
(108 documents), psychiatry-psychology (53 doc-
uments), paediatrics (70 documents), and emer-
gency (75 documents).3

2.2 Manual Annotation
All MTSamples subsets were double-annotated
for five types of time expressions: Date, Time,
Duration, Frequency (from TimeML (Pustejovsky
et al., 2010)), and Age-related (at the age of 16, in
his teens (Viani et al., 2018)). Identified expres-
sions were also normalised to a standard temporal
value (e.g. "2011-05" for May 2011). Manual
annotations were performed by two annotators: a
native English-speaker undergraduate student and
a non-native English-speaker researcher. To guide
the annotation process, we created specific anno-
tation guidelines, which we refined by adding rele-
vant examples from the text. Resulting guidelines
are available on our repository.

Besides including an Age-related time expres-
sion type, our annotation task differed from
TimeML in two ways. First, we included
as TIMEXes domain-specific (and temporally-
anchored) concepts, e.g. On the day of admis-
sion. This is similar to the Prepostexp type used
in the THYME corpus, but instead of creating a
different category, we included these expressions
among existing types (e.g. Date). Depending on
the clinical specialty (and more generally, on the
domain), different concepts could be considered as

temporal anchors within temporal annotation (e.g.
discharge for discharge summaries, pregnancy for
paediatrics notes). Second, we allowed annotators
to use relative values in the normalisation phase, if
needed. These relative values, or formulas, can
either refer to the document creation date (e.g.
"DCT-P2D" for Two days ago) or to the domain-
specific concepts (e.g. "OP+P2D" for postopera-
tive day #2).

To compute inter-annotator agreement (IAA)
on textual spans, we used the F1 score (allowing
overlapping annotations). Expressions identified
by both annotators (overlap) were used to com-
pute IAA on types and normalised values (accu-
racy). For IAA on types, we also report the Co-
hen’s Kappa measure (K), to take the possibility of
chance agreement into account.

2.3 Annotation Analysis for Timeline
Reconstruction

To analyse the suitability of using the TimeML-
based TIMEX annotations for timeline reconstruc-
tion, we based our analysis on the following: 1)
timeline properties of the TIMEX type Frequency,
2) properties of normalised values for Date anno-
tations, and 3) properties of common annotation
disagreements.

Our hypothesis regarding Frequency annota-
tions was that these would not be necessarily use-
ful as temporal references on an absolute time-
line, as they would be mostly related to drug pre-
scriptions. To assess this, we applied the MedEx-
UIMA tool (Jiang et al., 2014) on the text sur-
rounding each Frequency expression (the con-
text),4 and quantified the proportion of annotations
close to drug mentions.

Normalised values for Date can represent a spe-
cific point on a timeline, e.g. "YYYY-MM-DD",
"YYYY-MM" or "YYYY". However, they can
also represent other less straightforward points in
time, e.g. DCT-related (yesterday), vague refer-
ences (in the past), incomplete dates (on the 13th),
and concept-related (on the day of admission). To
better understand these latter types of normalised
Date values and their relation to timeline recon-
struction, we analysed annotations marked as such
by at least one annotator.

Finally, to inform the development of a new an-
notation schema for timeline reconstruction based

ter the annotation.

on calendar expressions, we counted all annota-
tion disagreements and analysed the most com-
mon type. We manually reviewed the documents
containing these expressions, assessing whether:
a) they could be placed on a timeline; and b) how
they could be normalised in a non-ambiguous way.
During this review, we also added new types of
expressions that we believe would be crucial ele-
ments to anchor on a timeline, thus forming a pro-
posal for a novel annotation schema.

3 Results

We report results for the new TimeML-based
TIMEX annotated corpus in terms of IAA, and
a breakdown of the number of documents, tokens
and TIMEXes for each clinical specialty (Table 1).
Furthermore, we report the results for the analysis
on different aspects of the suitability of these an-
notations for timeline reconstruction that was used
to inform the development of a novel annotation
schema (further outlined in Section 4).

3.1 Manual Annotation

For each clinical specialty, Table 1 reports the
number of documents (with total number of to-
kens), the number of time expressions marked by
at least one annotator (merged), and those marked
by both annotators (overlap). For IAA, we report
F1 score for text spans (allowing overlapping an-
notations) and type/value agreement measures (on
overlap annotations). We also report the preva-
lence of time expression types (only looking at
overlap annotations with type agreement).

IAA results for text spans are encouraging, 76-
84%. We observe that the distribution of TIMEX
types is similar across clinical specialties, where
Date is most common (28-36%) and Time is least
common (3-9%), with the exception of discharge
summaries, where Frequency is most common
(39%) – probably due to the abundance of drugs
prescribed after discharge. Agreement for nor-
malised values measured by accuracy is slightly
lower, overall (72-75%).

3.2 Annotation Analysis for Timeline
Reconstruction

As shown in Table 1, Frequency expressions are
common across all MTSamples subsets. By ap-
plying MedEx-UIMA and extracting the related
contexts, we found that most frequencies oc-
curred close to a drug mention (94%, 82%, 59%,

and 80%, in discharge summaries, psychiatry-
psychology, paediatrics, and emergency, respec-
tively). By manually reviewing a sample of
the remaining expressions, we noticed that some
of them referred to alcohol/smoking (he drank
one bottle of wine everyday) or recommendations
(continue bathing twice a week), and would there-
fore not be placed on a timeline. In other cases, ex-
amples were still related to a drug mention which,
however, did not fall in the selected context or was
not extracted by MedEx.

As regards the analysis of Date normalised val-
ues, we noticed that most “non-standard” val-
ues were given by DCT-related formulas (e.g.
"DCT-P2Y"). For discharge summaries, the sec-
ond most frequent type was concept-related (e.g.
"ADM+P2Y", where ADM stands for ADMission
day). Vague values were used across all subsets to
mark time references that were not explicitly writ-
ten (at that time, on the following Tuesday).

In all MTSamples subsets, the most frequent
type of disagreement was Duration-vs-Date, with
a proportion of 47% over all other types of dis-
agreements (41/86, 51/98, 21/59, 34/69, in dis-
charge summaries, psychiatry-psychology, paedi-
atrics, and emergency, respectively). In Table 2,
we report the most common types of disagreement
across all subsets.

By manually analysing documents where these
disagreements were present, and taking into con-
siderations our findings on the (TimeML-based
TIMEX) annotated corpus, we propose a new an-
notation schema for capturing time expressions
that are actually useful for timeline reconstruction:
CALendar Expressions (CALEX).

4 CALEX

CALEX refers to a temporal annotation schema
restricted to time expressions and concepts that
can be (directly or not) connected to an absolute
timeline. The key novelty of this model is to better
utilise time expression properties that are relevant
for anchoring points on a timeline, including the
introduction of certain timeline-relevant concepts.

In relation to TimeML-based TIMEX defini-
tions, CALEX excludes the following, because
they cannot be directly used for timeline recon-
struction:

• FREQUENCY/SET/QUANTIFIER, e.g.
once a week, two units of blood;

• DURATION when it is a temporal attribute
describing other events, e.g. “the procedure
usually takes 15 minutes”;

• TIME when it refers to temporal attributes
describing other events, e.g. “to be always
taken around 9am”.

There are three main elements in the proposed
CALEX annotation schema: TYPE, METADATA,
and VALUE.

TYPE
TYPE defines the type of a calendar expression.
The possible types within the CALEX schema are
described as follows:

• CALENDAR: this type covers all calendar ex-
pressions that do not require any metadata in
order to provide the final normalised VALUE,
including:

– explicit calendar references in differ-
ent temporal granularities such as date,
month, year

– timestamps
– explicit ranges
– when time is described as a period of

time (duration) but the connection with
the timeline is not clear or explicit - this
type refers to the original DURATION
type as part of the TimeML annotation
guidelines (e.g. “he took this medica-
tion for one month”)

• AGE: age-related expressions can either de-
fine the current age of a patient (e.g. “a 56
year old woman”), or be a reference to a cer-
tain point in time in which the patient had a
given age (at the age of 17).

• DOMAIN: expressions that either explicitly
define the value of a domain-specific concept



206

(admitted on 2010 Jun 6th), or are references
to a given domain-specific concept (on post-
operative day #4).

• DCT: expressions that require information
about the document creation time in order to
be normalised (last month).

• TENSE: imprecise expressions that refer to
conditions in the past, present or future (re-
cently).

• CONTEXT: expressions that refer to a tem-
poral context, represented by either the last
mentioned temporal reference or the most re-
cent temporal reference available within the
document. 5 This type includes times/periods
of the day where the connection to the time-
line is not clear and relies on the tempo-
ral context (e.g. the previous night). How-
ever, times/periods of the day representing
frequencies (e.g. “one tablet at night”) are
NOT considered as CALEXes.

METADATA
We introduce METADATA as a feature to allow for
a computationally more efficient way of calculat-
ing a particular time reference for CALEXes that
are not explicitly anchored in time. An essential
aspect of this feature is that it can include concepts
in its definition. These can also be explicitly set
within the METADATA feature, to ensure the orig-
inal values are used in order to normalise the final
calendar expression.

Document-related concepts include the
document creation time {doc.DCT} and con-
textualised references to the last or more recent
temporal mentions within the text ({doc.LAST}
and {doc.RECENT}). Patient-related con-
cepts are used to describe patient demo-
graphic features, such as {patient.AGE},
{patient.DOB}, {patient.DOD}, the
later possibly useful when analysing death
certificates.6 Patient-stay-related concepts will
basically refer to the period within admission
and discharge ({patient.ADMISSION} and
{patient.DISCHARGE}).

One important concept that may require some
disambiguation is related to the pregnancy period.

5Other specific contextual references can be required for
documents in different domains.

6{patient.AGE} and {patient.DOB} represent comple-
mentary concepts.

The terms Pregnancy and Prenatal are generally
interchangeably used when referring either to the
mother or the child. We formalise Pregnancy as
being the period of time used when referring to
the mother as a patient, whereas Prenatal refers
to the period of time (usually 40 weeks) before
{patient.DOB}, which refers to the child as
a patient. This way, {patient.PREGNANCY}
can occur at any time in the patient’s life, whereas
{patient.PRENATAL} is the period of 40
weeks preceding the patient’s date of birth.

Finally, some social- and family-related con-
cepts can be used in order to refer to some tem-
poral values regarding the patient’s relatives, such
as {mother.AGE} or {father.DOB}.

Besides making use of timeline-relevant con-
cepts, METADATA also contains functions that are
used to derive values:

• .set(): for explicitly defining the value of
domain-specific concepts;

• .add(): adds a period of time to a given
point in the calendar, moving to a later point
in time;

• .sub(): subtracts a period of time from a
given point in the calendar, moving to an ear-
lier point in time;

• .next(): finds the next occurrence of a
temporal granularity based on an anchor cal-
endar expression;

• .prev(): finds the previous occurrence of a
temporal granularity based on an anchor cal-
endar expression.

For example, a reference to DCT cannot be
properly normalised when DCT is unknown.
However, the metadata can keep the definition for
a calendar expression, to be converted to an actual
value when DCT is given: instead of parsing the
entire document, only the metadata has to be re-
evaluated – e.g. metadata for the expression “yes-
terday” is "{doc.DCT}.sub(P1D)".

VALUE
This component gives a normalised value of a cal-
endar expression, mostly following the previous
TimeML notation, with an extension: range val-
ues are used to normalise periods of time in the
form of [begin,end].7

7To indicate included endpoints, we use standard square
brackets: [A,B]. To indicate excluded endpoints, we use re-

Table 3 presents some examples on how the
CALEX annotation schema works in terms of nor-
malising the main features.8

As shown in the examples, a key element of
the CALEX schema is the handling of domain-
specific concepts in the METADATA element.

In Table 4, we show how different expres-
sions would be represented within CALEX and
TimeML, highlighting the types to be added to
capture timeline-related expressions in CALEX
format (“N/A” values in the TimeML type col-
umn).

Figure 2 provides an example of timeline cre-
ation using CALEX instead of TimeML (for the
psychiatry domain). First, to temporally anchor
the first emergence of auditory hallucinations, an
age-related time expression is added (since the age
of 14). Second, to capture the admission date, a
specific domain concept is used (On admission,
abbreviated as {patient.ADM}). For these expres-
sions, the METADATA feature allows identifying a
specific point in the timeline without the need for
temporal links. As another difference, the medi-
cation frequency (twice a day), which cannot be
represented at the timeline level, is removed.

5 Discussion

In this paper, we investigated how temporal in-
formation is documented in clinical text by fo-
cusing on time expressions (TIMEXes), using
clinical notes from MTSamples for four differ-
ent specialties (discharge summaries, psychiatry
and psychology, paediatrics, and emergency). Our
goal was to assess whether TIMEX annotation
schemas based on TimeML would be suitable to
capture the information needed to reconstruct pa-
tient timelines. First, we annotated documents us-
ing TimeML-inspired TIMEX types. Then, we
analysed which of these expressions actually indi-
cate a connection to the timeline, thus proposing a
new annotation schema based on calendar expres-
sions: CALEX.

Annotating MTSamples documents with a
TimeML-based TIMEX model was helpful to in-
vestigate how temporal information is reported
across different clinical specialties. Despite the
use of sample reports, which might be more struc-
tured as compared to real clinical records, the dis-
tribution of time expression types (Table 1) is sim-
ilar to those found in i2b2 2012 and THYME,
where Date represents the most common TIMEX
type and Time the least common. By analysing
our manually annotated time expressions, we iden-
tified some key points to be taken into account
to simplify timeline reconstruction. First, we ob-



208

CALEX type Example Definition TimeML type
CALENDAR {on 02/12/2009} directly connected to calendar Date
DCT {tomorrow} relative to the DCT Date
TENSE {in the past} imprecise reference Date
DCT {two years ago} relative to the DCT Duration
DOMAIN {18 hours prior to admission} related to a domain concept Duration
CONTEXT {three days before} related to another expression Duration
— the procedure usually takes {15 minutes} not directly connected to calendar Duration
CALENDAR on 02/12/2009 {at 9am} directly connected to calendar Time
— {twice a day} any re-occurring expression Frequency/Set/Quantifier
AGE a {56 years old} woman age of the patient N/A
AGE {when she was 17} reference to age N/A
DOMAIN {admitted on Oct 12th} domain-concept definition N/A
DOMAIN {the day before admission} reference to domain N/A

served that most Frequency annotations are not
helpful to anchor clinical events on an absolute
timeline. Our suggestion is to remove such el-
ements from time expression annotations, and to
capture them as entity attributes instead (e.g. drug
prescriptions). Moreover, the TimeML TIMEX
normalisation step is not always directly useful
for timeline reconstruction, as some expressions
would still require different types of temporal
links to be connected to the calendar.

To address these points, our proposed model,
CALEX, integrates timeline information at the
time expression level, specifying three different
components: TYPE, METADATA, and VALUE.
The new TYPE classification allows distinguish-
ing between expressions directly connected to
the calendar (e.g. full explicit dates) and rel-
ative/contextual expressions. Besides facilitat-
ing timeline reconstruction, this should also re-
duce ambiguity when assigning expression types,
as the different type categories are more clearly
separated. The METADATA feature, in combina-
tion with TYPE, allows storing the information
needed for calendar normalisation, making use

of functions and timeline-relevant concepts (Ta-
ble 3). While functions are general and reusable
across different document types, timeline-relevant
concepts are specific to each domain or use-
case, capturing the most appropriate anchor points
within a finite set (e.g. {Admission, Discharge}
for discharge summaries). The METADATA fea-
ture is useful to automatically derive or evalu-
ate the normalised VALUE, especially for concept-
related/contextual expressions where manually as-
signing values might be not straightforward.

Compared to TimeML, the CALEX model re-
moves the Frequency/Quantifier/Set type and in-
troduces new types and normalised values. In
particular, Date- and Duration- like expressions
are assigned different CALEX types depending
on how they can be linked to the timeline (Ta-
ble 4), which will be useful to reduce manual an-
notation for temporal links. Within the CALEX
model, instead, a greater annotation effort is re-
quired for the normalisation task. Especially for
relative expressions, assigning standardized val-
ues to METADATA is likely to be hard for non-
technical annotators. Therefore decisions on what



209

to manually annotate in the CALEX model will
need to be defined. As a first step, we would
require manual annotations mainly for calendar
expression VALUEs, specifying the METADATA
feature only if necessary (e.g. when no is DCT
available) and using a simplified notation (e.g.
"DCT-P2Y"). In most cases, this feature would
be derived programmatically, and its derivative
value used for evaluating the manual VALUE.

This study has some limitations and directions
for future work. The TimeML-based TIMEX an-
notations have not been adjudicated. However, we
have released the corpus as it is, so that NLP re-
searchers can integrate/reuse annotations for anal-
ysis and system development. In particular, we
have made available all annotations (merged),
specifying which ones are overlapping (and could
therefore be considered as more reliable). Our
study has been heavily focused on analysing time
expressions: we have not systematically also anal-
ysed how existing annotation schemas can cap-
ture calendar information by other annotation el-
ements. For example, i2b2 2012 and THYME in-
clude annotations for admission and discharge, but
they are classified as events to be linked to other
temporal entities. In other studies, it has been pro-
posed to add timeline information directly as event
attributes, e.g. Reimers et al. (2018).

When normalising time expressions, another as-
pect to be considered is the presence of impre-
cise temporal references, which are abundant in
the clinical domain (Tissot et al. (2019)). As part
of the CALEX model, TENSE expressions are in-
cluded, which are used to refer to the past, present
or future. At the moment, we are also evaluat-
ing how to incorporate other types of imprecise
temporal references. More generally, we are de-
signing a CALEX annotation guideline which is
focused on both manual (e.g. VALUE) and poten-
tially automatic (e.g. METADATA) tasks. As future
work, we plan to create a reference corpus anno-
tated with CALEXes, and design a shared task for
further evaluation. Creating a CALEX annotated
corpus will be crucial to assess the utility of our
model, as well as to highlight potential issues and
areas for improvement (with a specific focus on
the proposed types and the METADATA feature).

6 Conclusion

In this paper we developed a corpus of medical re-
ports annotated with TimeML-based time expres-

sions and systematically analysed their usefulness
for timeline reconstruction. As a result, we pro-
posed a new annotation schema, CALEX, which
will be used to design and develop new resources.
