Abstract

We introduce the use of Poincaré embeddings
to improve existing state-of-the-art approaches
to domain-specific taxonomy induction from
text as a signal for both relocating wrong hy-
ponym terms within a (pre-induced) taxonomy
as well as for attaching disconnected terms
in a taxonomy. This method substantially
improves previous state-of-the-art results on
the SemEval-2016 Task 13 on taxonomy ex-
traction. We demonstrate the superiority of
Poincaré embeddings over distributional se-
mantic representations, supporting the hypoth-
esis that they can better capture hierarchi-
cal lexical-semantic relationships than embed-
dings in the Euclidean space.

1 Introduction

The task of taxonomy induction aims at cre-
ating a semantic hierarchy of entities by using
hyponym-hypernym relations – called taxonomy –
from text corpora. Compared to many other do-
mains of natural language processing that make
use of pre-trained dense representations, state-of-
the-art taxonomy learning is still highly relying on
traditional approaches like extraction of lexical-
syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992) or co-occurrence
information (Grefenstette, 2015). Despite the suc-
cess of pattern-based approaches, most taxonomy
induction systems suffer from a significant number
of disconnected terms, since the extracted relation-
ships are too specific to cover most words (Wang
et al., 2017; Bordea et al., 2016). The use of dis-
tributional semantics for hypernym identification
and relation representation has thus received in-
creasing attention (Shwartz et al., 2016). How-
ever, Levy et al. (2015) observe that many pro-
posed supervised approaches instead learn proto-
typical hypernyms (that are hypernyms to many

other terms), not taking into account the rela-
tion between both terms in classification. There-
fore, past applications of distributional seman-
tics appear to be rather unsuitable to be directly
applied to taxonomy induction as the sole sig-
nal (Tan et al., 2015; Pocostales, 2016). We ad-
dress that issue by introducing a series of sim-
ple and parameter-free refinement steps that em-
ploy word embeddings in order to improve ex-
isting domain-specific taxonomies, induced from
text using traditional approaches in an unsuper-
vised fashion.

We compare two types of dense vector em-
beddings: the standard word2vec CBOW model
(Mikolov et al., 2013a,b), that embeds terms in
Euclidean space based on distributional similarity,
and the more recent Poincaré embeddings (Nickel
and Kiela, 2017), which capture similarity as well
as hierarchical relationships in a hyperbolic space.
The source code has been published1 to recreate
the employed embedding, to refine taxonomies as
well as to enable further research of Poincaré em-
beddings for other semantic tasks.

2 Related Work

The extraction of taxonomic relationships from
text corpora is a long-standing problem in ontol-
ogy learning, see Biemann (2005) for an earlier
survey. Wang et al. (2017) discuss recent advance-
ments in taxonomy construction from text corpora.
Conclusions from the survey include: i) The per-
formance of extraction of IS-A relation can be im-
proved by studying how pattern-based and distri-
butional approaches complement each other; ii)
there is only limited success of pure deep learn-

ing paradigms here, mostly because it is difficult
to design a single objective function for this task.

On the two recent TExEval tasks at SemEval for
taxonomy extraction (Bordea et al., 2015, 2016),
attracting a total of 10 participating teams, at-
tempts to primarily use a distributional repre-
sentation failed. This might seem counterin-
tuitive, as taxonomies are surely modeling se-
mantics and thus their extraction should benefit
from semantic representations. The 2015 winner
INRIASAC (Grefenstette, 2015) performed rela-
tion discovery using substring inclusion, lexical-
syntactic patterns and co-occurrence informa-
tion based on sentences and documents from
Wikipedia. The winner in 2016, TAXI (Panchenko
et al., 2016), harvests hypernyms with substring
inclusion and Hearst-style lexical-syntactic pat-
terns (Hearst, 1992) from domain-specific texts
obtained via focused web crawling. The only
submission to the TExEval 2016 task that relied
exclusively on distributional semantics to induce
hypernyms by adding a vector offset to the cor-
responding hyponym (Pocostales, 2016) achieved
only modest results. A more refined approach to
applying distributional semantics by Zhang et al.
(2018) generates a hierarchical clustering of terms
with each node consisting of several terms. They
find concepts that should stay in the same clus-
ter using embedding similarity – whereas, similar
to the TExEval task, we are interested in making
distinctions between all terms. Finally, Le et al.
(2019) also explore using Poincaré embeddings
for taxonomy induction, evaluating their method
on hypernymy detection and reconstructing Word-
Net. However, in contrast to our approach that fil-
ters and attaches terms, they perform inference.

3 Taxonomy Refinement using
Hyperbolic Word Embeddings

We employ embeddings using distributional se-
mantics (i.e. word2vec CBOW) and Poincaré em-
beddings (Nickel and Kiela, 2017) to alleviate the
largest error classes in taxonomy extraction: the
existence of orphans – disconnected nodes that
have an overall connectivity degree of zero and
outliers – a child node that is assigned to a wrong
parent. The rare case in which multiple parents
can be assigned to a node has been ignored in the
proposed refinement system. The first step con-
sists of creating domain-specific Poincaré embed-
dings (§ 3.1). They are then used to identify and

relocate outlier terms in the taxonomy (§ 3.2), as
well as to attach unconnected terms to the tax-
onomy (§ 3.3). In the last step, we further opti-
mize the taxonomy by employing the endocentric
nature of hyponyms (§ 3.4). See Figure 1 for a
schematic visualization of the refinement pipeline.
In our experiments, we use the output of three dif-
ferent systems. The refinement method is generi-
cally applicable to (noisy) taxonomies, yielding an
improved taxonomy extraction system overall.

3.1 Domain-specific Poincaré Embedding
Training Dataset Construction To create
domain-specific Poincaré embeddings, we use
noisy hypernym relationships extracted from
a combination of general and domain-specific
corpora. For the general domain, we extracted
59.2 GB of text from English Wikipedia, Gi-
gaword (Parker et al., 2009), ukWac (Ferraresi
et al., 2008) and LCC news corpora (Goldhahn
et al., 2012). The domain-specific corpora consist
of web pages, selected by using a combination
of BootCat (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004) and
focused crawling (Remus and Biemann, 2016).
Noisy IS-A relations are extracted with lexical-
syntactic patterns from all corpora by applying
PattaMaika2, PatternSim (Panchenko et al., 2012),
and WebISA (Seitner et al., 2016), following
(Panchenko et al., 2016).3

The extracted noisy relationships of the com-
mon and domain-specific corpora are further pro-
cessed separately and combined afterward. To
limit the number of terms and relationships, we
restrict the IS-A relationships on pairs for which
both entities are part of the taxonomy’s vocabu-
lary. Relations with a frequency of less than three
are removed to filter noise. Besides further re-
moving every reflexive relationship, only the more
frequent pair of a symmetric relationship is kept.
Hence, the set of cleaned relationships is trans-
formed into being antisymmetric and irreflexive.
The same procedure is applied to relationships ex-
tracted from the general-domain corpus with a fre-
quency cut-off of five. They are then used to
expand the set of relationships created from the
domain-specific corpora.

2http://jobimtext.org: The PattaMaika compo-
nent is based on UIMA RUTA (Kluegl et al., 2016).

3Alternatively to the relations extracted using lexical pat-
terns, we also tried to use hypernyms extracted using the pre-
trained HypeNet model (Shwartz et al., 2016), but the over-
all taxonomy evaluation results were lower than the standard
baseline of the TAXI system and thus are not presented here.

Hypernym-Hyponym Distance Poincaré em-
beddings are trained on these cleaned IS-A re-
lationships. For comparison, we also trained a
model on noun pairs extracted from WordNet (P-
WN). Pairs were only kept if both nouns were
present in the vocabulary of the taxonomy. Fi-
nally, we trained the word2vec embeddings, con-
necting compound terms in the training corpus
(Wikipedia) by ’ ’ to learn representations for
compound terms, i.e multiword units, for the in-
put vocabulary.

In contrast to embeddings in the Euclidean
space where the cosine similarity u·v|u||v| is com-
monly applied as a similarity measure, Poincaré
embeddings use a hyperbolic space, specifically
the Poincaré ball model (Stillwell, 1996). Hyper-
bolic embeddings are designed for modeling hi-
erarchical relationships between words as they ex-
plicitly capture the hierarchy between words in the
embedding space and are therefore a natural fit for
inducing taxonomies. They were also successfully
applied to hierarchical relations in image classifi-
cation tasks (Khrulkov et al., 2019). The distance
between two points u, v ∈ Bd for a d-dimensional
Poincaré Ball model is defined as:

d(u, v) = arcosh
(
1 + 2

||u− v||2

(1− ||u||2)(1− ||v||2)

)
.

This Poincaré distance enables us to capture the
hierarchy and similarity between words simulta-
neously. It increases exponentially with the depth
of the hierarchy. So while the distance of a leaf
node to most other nodes in the hierarchy is very
high, nodes on abstract levels, such as the root,
have a comparably small distance to all nodes in
the hierarchy. The word2vec embeddings have no
notion of hierarchy and hierarchical relationships
cannot be represented with vector offsets across

the vocabulary (Fu et al., 2014). When apply-
ing word2vec, we use the observation that distri-
butionally similar words are often co-hyponyms
(Heylen et al., 2008; Weeds et al., 2014).

3.2 Relocation of Outlier Terms

Poincaré embeddings are used to compute and
store a rank rank(x, y) between every child and
parent of the existing taxonomy, defined as the in-
dex of y in the list of sorted Poincaré distances
of all entities of the taxonomy to x. Hypernym-
hyponym relationships with a rank larger than the
mean of all ranks are removed, chosen on the basis
of tests on the 2015 TExEval data (Bordea et al.,
2015). Disconnected components that have chil-
dren are re-connected to the most similar parent in
the taxonomy or to the taxonomy root if no dis-
tributed representation exists. Previously or now
disconnected isolated nodes are subject to orphan
attachment (§ 3.3).

Since distributional similarity does not capture
parent-child relations, the relationships are not
registered as parent-child but as co-hyponym re-
lationships. Thus, we compute the distance to the
closest co-hyponym (child of the same parent) for
every node. This filtering technique is then applied
to identify and relocate outliers.

3.3 Attachment of Orphan Terms

We then attach orphans (nodes unattached in the
input or due to the removal of relationships in the
previous step) by computing the rank between ev-
ery orphan and the most similar node in the tax-
onomy. This node is an orphan’s potential par-
ent. Only hypernym-hyponym relationships with a
rank lower or equal to the mean of all stored ranks
are added to the taxonomy. For the word2vec sys-
tem, a link is added between the parent of the most



4814

similar co-hyponym and the orphan.

3.4 Attachment of Compound Terms

In case a representation for a compound noun term
does not exist, we connect it to a term that is a sub-
string of the compound. If no such term exists, the
noun remains disconnected. Finally, the Tarjan al-
gorithm (Tarjan, 1972) is applied to ensure that the
refined taxonomy is asymmetric: In case a circle
is detected, one of its links is removed at random.

4 Evaluation

Proposed methods are evaluated on the data of
SemEval2016 TExEval (Bordea et al., 2016) for
submitted systems that created taxonomies for all
domains of the task4, namely the task-winning
system TAXI (Panchenko et al., 2016) as well
as the systems USAAR (Tan et al., 2016) and
JUNLP (Maitra and Das, 2016). TAXI harvests

hypernyms with substring inclusion and lexical-
syntactic patterns by obtaining domain-specific
texts via focused web crawling. USAAR and
JUNLP heavily rely on rule-based approaches.
While USAAR exploits the endocentric nature of
hyponyms, JUNLP combines two string inclusion
heuristics with semantic relations from BabelNet.
We use the taxonomies created by these systems
as our baseline and additionally ensured that tax-
onomies do neither have circles nor in-going edges
to the taxonomy root by applying the Tarjan al-
gorithm (Tarjan, 1972), removing a random link
from detected cycles. This causes slight differ-
ences between the baseline results in Figure 2 and
(Bordea et al., 2016).

5 Results and Discussion

Comparison to Baselines Figure 2 shows com-
parative results for all datasets and measures for
every system. The Root method, which connects
all orphans to the root of the taxonomy, has the
highest connectivity but falls behind in scores sig-
nificantly. Word2vec CBOW embeddings partly
increase the scores, however, the effect appears to
be inconsistent. Word2vec embeddings connect
more orphans to the taxonomy (cf. Table 2), al-
beit with mixed quality, thus the interpretation of
word similarity as co-hyponymy does not seem to
be appropriate. Word2vec as a means to detect hy-
pernyms has shown to be rather unsuitable (Levy
et al., 2015). Even more advanced methods such
as the diff model (Fu et al., 2014) merely learn so-
called prototypical hypernyms.

Both Poincaré embeddings variants outperform
the word2vec ones yielding major improvements
over the baseline taxonomy. Employing the
McNemar (1947) significance test shows that
Poincaré embeddings’ improvements to the orig-
inal systems are indeed significant. The achieved
improvements are larger on the TAXI system than
on the other two systems. We attribute to the dif-
ferences of these approaches: The rule-based ap-
proaches relying on string inclusion as carried out
by USAAR and JUNLP are highly similar to step
§3.4. Additionally, JUNLP creates taxonomies
with many but very noisy relationships, therefore
step §3.3 does not yield significant gains, since
there are much fewer orphans available to con-
nect to the taxonomy. This problem also affects
the USAAR system for the food domain. For the
environment domain, however, USAAR creates a

taxonomy with very high precision but low recall
which makes step §3.2 relatively ineffective. As
step §3.3 has shown to improve scores more than
§3.2, the gains on JUNLP are comparably lower.

WordNet-based Embeddings The domain-
specific Poincaré embeddings mostly perform
either comparably or outperform the WordNet-
based ones. In error analysis, we found that
while WordNet-based embeddings are more
accurate, they have a lower coverage as seen
in Table 2, especially for attaching complex
multiword orphan vocabulary entries that are not
contained in WordNet, e.g., second language
acquisition. Based on the results we achieved
by using domain-specific Poincaré embeddings,
we hypothesize that their attributes result in a
system that learns hierarchical relations between
a pair of terms. The closest neighbors of terms
in the embedding clearly tend to be more generic
as exemplarily shown in Table 1, which further
supports our claim. Their use also enables the
correction of false relations created by string
inclusion heuristics as seen with wastewater.
However, we also notice that few and inaccurate
relations for some words results in imprecise word
representations such as for botany.

Multilingual Results Applying domain-specific
Poincaré embeddings to other languages also cre-
ates overall improved taxonomies, however the
scores vary as seen in Table 3. While the score
of all food taxonomies increased substantially, the
taxonomies quality for environment did not im-
prove, it even declines. This seems to be due to the
lack of extracted relations in (§3.1), which results
in imprecise representations and a highly limited

vocabulary in the Poincaré embedding model, es-
pecially for Italian and Dutch. In these cases, the
refinement is mostly defined by step §3.4.

6 Conclusion

We presented a refinement method for improving
existing taxonomies through the use of hyperbolic
Poincaré embeddings. They consistently yield im-
provements over strong baselines and in compari-
son to word2vec as a representative for distribu-
tional vectors in the Euclidean space. We fur-
ther showed that Poincaré embeddings can be effi-
ciently created for a specific domain from crawled
text without the need for an existing database such
as WordNet. This observation confirms the theo-
retical capability of Poincaré embeddings to learn
hierarchical relations, which enables their future
use in a wide range of semantic tasks. A prominent
direction for future work is using the hyperbolic
embeddings as the sole signal for taxonomy ex-
traction. Since distributional and hyperbolic em-
beddings cover different relations between terms,
it may be interesting to combine them.
