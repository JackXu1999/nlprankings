Abstract

We induce and visualize a Knowledge Graph over the Regesta Imperii (RI), an important large-
scale resource for medieval history research. The RI comprise more than 150,000 digitized ab-
stracts of medieval charters issued by the Roman-German kings and popes distributed over many
European locations and a time span of more than 700 years. Our goal is to provide a resource for
historians to visualize and query the RI, possibly aiding medieval history research. The resulting
medieval graph and visualization tools are shared publicly.

1 Introduction

We describe here the process of inducing and visualizing a Knowledge Graph (KG) that structures infor-
mation from the Regesta Imperii (RI), an important large-scale resource for medieval history research.
Having important information from the RI in a structured format makes it easier to visualize, and possibly
aid medieval history research.

The Regesta Imperii (RI) comprises documents, regests, that can be seen as abstracts of charters issued
by Roman-German emperors and popes, starting from the Carolingian dynasty to Maximilan I. The
project was initiated in 1829 by a German librarian, Johann Friedrich Böhmer, who started to collect
and summarize the charters. Today, more than 175,000 regests have been converted to Unicode and are
stored in a publicly available and continuously increasing online database1 due to the efforts of various
research projects.2

We extract relations and entities from the regest texts and meta information, and build a large-scale
knowledge graph that covers approximately 83% of the documents (Sections 2-3). Information about
the entity types and about the events themselves reveal interesting observations about the behaviour of
emperors and popes with respect to their subjects. The graph can be explored through a web-based
visualization tool (Section 4).

with respect to year of charter creation.

The RI corpus. With regard to the referenced charters,
the RI are unevenly distributed over a large time span (Fig-
ure 1). Many regests reference charters from the later me-
dieval times issued by the emperors Karl IV (1316-1378,
15,595 regests), Friedrich III (1415-1493, 21,477 regests)
and Maximilian I (1459-1519, 22,153 regests) and very of-
ten consist of one, often complicated sentence, describing
an action performed by the issuer (usually an emperor or
pope) towards one or several of his subjects, as can be seen

in the regest3 in Figure 2. While this regest is syntactically quite complex, it contains only conven-
tional German, where conventional means that syntax and spelling conform with contemporary German.
Other regests, having been created earlier or by different authors, contain words with non-conventional
spelling or nouns in lowercase, which is highly unconventional in contemporary German. An example is
displayed in Figure 3.4 erben (heirs) and dienste (services) are nouns currently written with an uppercase
starting letter; kuchenschriber (kitchen bills accountant) is a (very rare) noun, spelled Küchenschreiber
in contemporary German. In the middle of the text the code switches and we find a much older variant of
German, a quotation from the original charter of 1404, where spelling and syntactic constructions differ
significantly, e.g. Stadt (city) is written Stad and Seite (side) is spelled syte.

Corpus statistics are summarized in Table 1.5

We find more than 16 million tokens and al-
most 2 million named entity mentions in the RI.
Because the RI stem from different authors and
times, the spelling of words can be very variable.
For example, there are many spelling variants of
the Austrian city Innsbruck (Ynnsbrug, Ynsbrug,
Innsbruck, Insprugk, etc.). Code-switching is
ubiquitous not only from author to author but
also inside a regest, where the text often contains quotes in Latin and medieval German, taken from
the original charter. Named entities in the RI can be rather complex, for example Adelheid, tochter wei-
land Ulrichs von Minzenberg (English: “Adelheid, daughter of former Ulrich of Minzenberg”) includes
a sub-named entity (Ulrich von Minzenberg). tochter, as a noun, should start with an uppercase letter
and weiland is an outdated and uncommon German adverb, used in the sense of “formerly”.

Preprocessing. We use a state-of-the-art German preprocessing pipeline. The preprocessing model
was trained on contemporary German texts, so it naturally makes more errors on the RI. We manually
examine the outputs for 100 randomly chosen regests, and find that, particularly on the first sentence, all
steps yield reasonably good results on named entity recognition, and the syntactic dependency parse is
often correct in detecting the finite main verb and its object, or parts of it.6

Some errors are caused by non-conventional spelling (e.g. lowercased nouns tagged as verbs). We
will address this type of errors in future work, mainly because countless rare nouns and a high rate of
spelling variations make classical normalization techniques very challenging. Applying such techniques,
e.g. techniques based on lexical lookups and minimum edit distance computations (Ristad and Yianilos,
1998; Yujian and Bo, 2007), may even introduce many new errors and manipulate the historic data in
unwanted and difficult-to-detect ways.

We find, however, a specific type of error which is due to an eager sentence splitting model: e.g. a
sentence split often is performed on title prefixes. In the RI a title – abbreviated with a period – often
prefixes a named entity: e.g. Gf. – Graf (count), Bf. – Bischof (bishop), Eb. – Erzbischof (archbishop).

Table 2: Some of the automatically collected me-
dieval title abbreviations and their frequency in a
random sample of 15,000 regests.

We introduce three processing steps to minimize
this type of error: (1) iterate through 15,000 ran-
domly sampled regests and aggregate the tokens
occurring directly in front of named entities; (2)
compute their frequencies; (3) filter instances start-
ing with an uppercase letter, ending with a period,
having a minimum frequency of 5 and a maximum
length of 5 characters. Taking into account only
the prefixes starting with an uppercase letter has
the advantage of increased precision (verbs are not
counted). Recall can be increased afterwards by
taking into account the prefixes’ lowercase variants
as well (sometimes bishop was abbreviated bf. and
at other times Bf.). After obtaining the possible ab-
breviations a historian helped us in manually filter-
ing out 250 common abbreviations in the RI (false
positives such as Roman numerals – e.g. XI. – were
discarded in this step). After applying these steps, we obtain an interesting vocabulary of historic German
abbreviations (Table 2). The amount of erroneous sentence splits was reduced by 10%.

Edges and vertices. Based on the assumption that the first (and often only) sentence contains the
relevant relation information, we process only this sentence. We rely on the fact that the main relation
(edge) between a ruler and its subject entities (the vertices) very frequently occur in a subject-verb-
object format with respect to the first finite verb. As arguments of the relation we consider the first
occurring named entity and the named entity which acts as the accusative or dative object of the first
finite verb. Named entities in a comma-separated list or appearing in and-conjunctions of which at
least one has an object dependency relation to the main verb, are all added to the graph separately.

Figure 4: Dependency parse for Figure 2.

The source is the issuer or emperor, which we assume
to be the subject of the first finite verb and which we
extract from the metadata as it is often omitted in the
regest text (cf. Figure 2). The KG will thus contain two
types of vertices: (i) the issuers (emperor or pope) and
(ii) named entities found by the NLP tool.

Edges are weighted: if a named entity is mentioned
first after the finite verb or has an object dependency to
it, the weight of the edge is increased by 0.5; if a named
entity is mentioned first after the main verb and lies in

the object dependency of it, the weight is incremented by 1.0. For example, from Figure 2 (dependency
tree: Figure 4) we retrieve the tuple (Sigmund, promises, Ludwig of the Palatinate), and insert the subject
and object into the graph (if not already contained). If the relation promises already exists between these
entities in the KG, we increment the edge weight by 1.0, since, as can be seen in the example, Ludwig of
the Palatinate was detected both as object of promises (+0.5) and as the first named entity (+0.5).

The more promise-events are instantiated between these two entities, the higher the weight of the edge.
This implies that an edge or relation r with weight w between an emperor and one of its subjects means
that in the data there were 1 ≤ n ≤ w instantiations of r detected between these entities and thus the
edge weight can be interpreted both as a reliability measure of the relation and an indicator for how many
times the relation was instantiated.

While we induced 4,948 distinct relations in the KG, the 400 most common relations cover 90%
of the relations induced in the KG (Table 3 and Figure 5). Edge quality will be analyzed in the next
section. Regests that do not contain verbs in the first sentence are discarded, e.g. Geburt Karls, des
jüngsten Sohnes Kaiser Ludwigs (d. Fr.) und seiner zweiten Gemahlin Judith (English: “Birth of Karl,
the youngest son of emperor Ludwig (the Pious) and his second wife Judith”).7 Applying these steps,
more than 149,203 regests yield a relation, thus 83% of the RI have found their way into our KG.

Edge attributes. Each edge (relation) in the KG can be seen as representing one or more event(s)
between an emperor and one of his subjects. We can associate an attribute list to each edge: date, time and
location of creation of the event are taken from respective fields in the XML of the regests. We are also
interested in key phrases associated with each event. For example, at one time king Sigmund may have
promised bestowal of land to duke Ludwig and at another time he might have promised him privileges or
financial help. To find associated key phrases, we formulate a text classification task, where we predict
the main relation of a regest (i.e. the finite verb of the first sentence) using a bag of all contained phrases
represented as a binary vector. We consider all phrases tagged as noun chunks or verbs (except the finite
verb) as features. We only consider relations that occur more than 25 times, leaving us with 397 classes
plus one catch-all class for the less frequent relations. Having fitted a logistic regression model to the task
in a one-vs.-rest setting, we can rank the phrases describing an instantiation of a relation according to the
learned weights for this relation. For example, given that the relation extracted from the example regest
Sigmund→promises→Ludwig of the Palatinate was instantiated only one time, a list associated with this
edge contains the description of one specific event. The event took place in 1410 at the location Ofen
and, after having queried the model’s coefficients for the relation promise, we see that highly associated
key phrases of the event are the noun chunks Privilegien (priviliges) and Reichspfandschaften (earnests).
If there was another regest with a promise-relation between those same entities, we add another event
description to the edge attribute list and increment the weight of the edge accordingly. The key phrase
ranking relation-prediction approach is evaluated and examined more closely in the next section.

haus (his house) would have been the correct accusative object.

3 Problem Analysis

Despite syntactic parse errors due to the text complexity, we find that many named entities are being
captured and the syntactic parse is often partially correct with respect to detecting the direct object of the
finite verb, as can be seen in Figure 4. In some cases, however, we obtain very erroneous parse trees.

The regest in Figure 3 gets an erroneous dependency tree (Figure 7). The main reasons for this seem to
be errors from preceding pipeline steps (Figure 6): even when disregarding the quote in the older variant
of German, the text is annotated with false part-of-speech tags, propagating errors through the rest of
the pipeline and into the dependency parse. Nevertheless, the relation is correctly induced with a weight
of 0.5 because Hermann von Mülin is correctly detected as the first named entity after the verb. On the
other hand, the regest in Figure 2, mostly written in today’s conventional German, is correctly parsed
with respect to the main relation, its accusative object and even the distant object clause.

For future work we want to experiment with fine-tuning the preprocessing models for the RI data.
This is a non-trivial task because manual annotation would require domain experts. Other means such
as bootstrapping the NER-pipeline by filtering and crawling part-of-speech patterns may introduce new
errors, possibly even worsening the overall performance of the system, which is difficult to assess with-
out manually labeled data. For further graph refinement one could consider disambiguating the named
entities and merging their nodes. The KG could also be improved by identifying the (minority of) cases
where the regest is not an event description of the emperor unidirectionally interacting with other entities
but vice-versa (e.g. an entity gives a present to the emperor).

Inspection and Evaluation of the Relation Prediction Model. To investigate the performance of the
model on unseen data, we divide the RI into a training set of 100,000 instances and 79,320 test instances,
and use key phrases, issuers, locations and dates as binary features to predict one of the 398 relations
(397 most common with KG-induction frequency of > 25 and one rest-class). This classification task
is difficult because the many classes are also unevenly distributed, varying in frequency from 44,303 to
26, with an average of 450.5 and a median of 76 instances per class. The results are shown in Table
4. The relation classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.487 and macro f1 of 0.141, significantly higher than
the baselines (majority baseline: 0.003 f1). Both baselines, majority voter and random baseline (drawing
classes according to estimated class probabilities in the training data), lag behind not only the full-feature
model but also a logistic regression model which uses only location or issuer features. We conclude that
certain issuers and locations are more associated with specific relations than others. Our model’s learnt
coefficients can also be used to investigate these associations. For example, we find that the coefficients
for emperor Friedrich III. have the highest value for the relations quittirt (signs), legitimirt (legitimates),

gibt (gives), gebietet (dictates), befiehlt (commands), erlaubt (permits), while for emperor Maximilian I.,
there is a different picture and we find many financial relations such as schuldet (owes), verbucht (books)
and bezahlt (pays). Maximilian I. was well known for his debts he accumulated due to many wars and a
rather extravagant lifestyle and we can see that this is also statistically reflected in the RI.

Inspecting the fitted model’s coefficients for the relation verhängt (imposes), we see that among highly
associated phrases are die Reichsacht, die Acht, die Aberacht, Klage, den Bann, die Reichsaberacht, das
Anathem, which are mostly outdated German words for banning (excommunicating) somebody (Acht,
Aberacht, Bann) and also anathema (Anathem). Highly weighted terms for the relation describing ver-
leiht (bestow) are das Pallium (a religous clothing), Regalien (regalian rights), ein Wapen8 (a crest),
Lehens- und Landesrecht (land rights), Gerichtsstandsprivileg (court-right), Doktorwürde (doctorate)
and Halsgericht or Blutbann, both old German terms in the context of the relation bestows referring to
the right to speak the death sentence (a right which was granted only to selected cities). We conclude
that our binary, bag-of-phrases representation for relation classification is a robust and straightforward
way not only to rank key phrases describing medieval events but also to gain deeper insights into the RI.

Quality of Graph Edges We evaluate the quality of graph edges (first detected finite verb in a regest):
(i) to assess the overall quality of edges and (ii) from the point of view of a user or historian, who
might be interested in the quality of high-confidence edges, e.g. he choses to consider only relations
with weight > w. The relation extraction experiments indicate that a falsely induced relation is due to
false positive verb errors from POS tagging. We manually checked the 397 most commonly induced
relations and found 69 to be incorrectly POS tagged. Examples of errors include wittwe (widow) and
archidiacon (archdeacon). Everything that was erroneously tagged as a verb was labeled an error – an
exception were deverbal nouns.9 We assume a pessimistic scenario of all relations with count equal to or
less than 25 having been misclassified with false POS tags. This scenario is very pessimistic because we
not only find many rare and generally uncommon German verbs with varied spellings in this subset (e.g.
vidimiert, vidimirt – a very rare word meaning “he witnesses”) but also deverbal nouns which can be
useful. Thus, given n distinct relations i = 1, ..., n and fi returns the total number of times this relation
was induced in the KG, and gi returns 1 if the relation was likely falsely inserted and 0 if it likely was
correctly inserted (regarding POS annotation), we estimate the weighted micro error:∑n

i=1 fi · gi∑n
i=1 fi

. (1)

For the unweighted macro error, fi = 1∀i. The results are shown in Table 5. The macro error, i.e.
when all relations have the same significance, is estimated at 0.17 for scenario (ii), when the manually
annotated relation subset of the most frequent 397 relations was used. When taking into account as errors

8Wapen is not a mistake – the word is spelled Wappen in contemporary German but we find both forms in the RI.
9Specifically, those nouns were belagerung (siege), Eintreffen (arrival) and belehnung (mortgage).

schenkt (endow). Edge thickness indicates edge weight and nodes are scaled by degree centrality. The
figure is best seen in color.

all the other, less frequent relations, the macro error is < 0.93, which of course is a very pessimistic
estimate. However, in most cases, assessing the weighted micro-error would be of much more interest
– some relations cover a much larger proportion of induced relations. For example, a historian who is
interested in the most frequent 125 relations (@125 in Table 5) would expect a weighted error of 0.03
and pessimistically an unweighted error of at most 0.104. When choosing the most common 25 relations
(e.g. @25 in Table 5), the error is zero for both micro and macro calculations with regard to falsely
induced relations due to POS tag errors.

clusters (Brandes et al., 2008) after applica-

Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009).

Visualization of textual (meta)-data is crucial both to
make sense of the data itself and also to distribute the
information in a more accessible way. Figure 9 dis-
plays our induced graph, where modularity clusters
are colored differently. Inspecting the main clusters
shows that some clusters roughly represent the uni-
verses of single emperors (violet: Friedrich III. (14.3%
of all nodes), blue: Sigmund (9.54%), black: Karl
IV. (6.14%)), while other clusters encapsulate multi-
ple emperors (pink: the Palatine emperors Ruprecht I.,
Ruprecht II., and Ruprecht III. (7.45%)) and addition-
ally there appear to be clusters which subsume the uni-
verses of less prevalent and especially earlier emperors
(orange: Otto III., Otto I., Karl the Great, etc. (7.14%)).
Interactive visualization is a methodological tool to assist researchers in exploring the data, allowing for
non-destructive data manipulation and filtering. For the Regesta Imperii we aim to provide an easy-



166

to-use exploration tool of the extracted knowledge graph for historians. We built a web application to
visualize the data. The application is JavaScript-based and uses AngularJS 1 as the frontend framework.
Visualization is done using vis.js,10 an open-source tool aimed at network and timeline visualizations.

Our KG contains 68,726 nodes and 154,797 edges. The average outdegree of nodes is 380 and average
indegree is 2.65, showing that the KG is highly uni-directional with few central nodes (i.e. issuers) and
most peripheral nodes having few incoming and almost no outgoing edges. Structurally speaking, the
knowledge graph is weakly connected, consisting of 14 components with one large component containing
68,692 and the remaining ones containing < 5 nodes. In the largest component, of the 25 nodes with
highest betweenness centrality, 7 are issuers and 18 are persons. This indicates that in terms of shortest
paths between all node pairs, persons are especially important in establishing the connectivity of the
graph. However, when looking at the 70 cut vertices of the component that are named entities,11 we see
that 55 are persons, but 11 denote place or region names (e.g. Frankreich or Reutlingen), indicating that
certain regions also play a critical role in connecting multiple sub-networks.12

An example network is shown in Figure 8. Although the sheer size of the KG prohibits it from being
visualized in its entirety, we use optimizations and ad-hoc querying to visualize sub-networks of the
KG. With these, we were able to create interactive visualizations for networks of up to 12,000 nodes in
practice. On the settings page, a user can choose one or more issuers. Based on the selected issuers, a
network with all other nodes with which they interacted gets created. Furthermore, there are a number
of additional settings, which can be divided into limiting constraints and network enhancements.

Limiting constraints. These limit the resulting network on an ad-hoc basis. Specifically, we allow to
set a threshold X (≤ X; = X; ≥ X) for the number of connections to display for a named entity and
the number of relation instances. With these settings, specific requirements can be made, e.g. “show the
network of Friedrich III. with relations that appear at least 40 times”. A combination of constraints is
also possible but per default, we set all constraints ≥ 1 so that the full graph will be rendered.

Network enhancements. These apply to the way the network gets rendered and can be interacted
with. The first option visualizes the intensity of edges by their associated edge weights. The second
option visualizes the importance of persons by means of a selected node centrality measure. Currently,
we support degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality. The last option enables the time slider that
allows for filtering the network by event dates. Per default, all three options are disabled.

To further reduce rendering speed, we implemented a decay factor to the number of iterations of the
underlying physics solver used to calculate the graph layout. Starting with a network containing more
than 150 nodes or 250 edges, the default number of iterations (1,000) is reduced by a factor of 0.1 for
every additional 150 nodes or 250 edges.13 We set the lower-bound to 100 iterations to give the solver
some time to calculate the layout. Using this decay factor and the above-mentioned constraints drastically
reduces the load times for very large networks. For example, the network of Karl IV. containing 7,359
nodes and 13,760 edges takes a couple of minutes to render. With the decay factor and the constraint that
named entities have exactly 2 edges, the graph is reduced to 785 nodes and 1,568 edges, and is rendered
in 80 seconds with 576 iterations.14 Furthermore, we allow to save graphs as JSON files that can later be
re-uploaded, further reducing load times. These are promising results as in a later production stage, the
application can be supplemented by a database containing pre-calculated network layouts.

applying NLP to historical documents. The idea of normalization is often explored, yet we encountered
the same problem as the author who reports that the effectiveness of normalization to a large degree
depends on text type and language – most satisfying results are achieved only on more recent texts. For

11We exclude issuers from this analysis as cutting them almost always increases the number of components because of their

central role.
12The remaining four are generic entities such as Roman numerals.
13Furthermore, if the node-edge difference is > 900, we consider the edge number to be determining the decay factor.
1440 seconds of that are needed to process the data from our KG file, the remaining time is the rendering time.

this reason, we applied little and careful normalization to the regests. We concur that “the highly variable
spelling found in many historical texts has remained one of the most troublesome issues for NLP” (p.
83), a fact that may be especially true with regard to the RI. Due to these issues, the research conducted
in processing of (German) historical texts has been diverse and very task-specific, see i.a. (Massad et al.,
2013; Meroño-Peñuela et al., 2015; Seemann et al., 2017; Hench, 2017; Schulz and Keller, 2016).

Regesta Imperii. Not much NLP research has been conducted on the RI. Kuczera (2015), in an
example experiment, projects attributes and relations between entities from the times of Friedrich III.
(i.e. a subset of the RI) into a graph database. He applies no NLP in these steps, but relies on the
manually created person registers for the universe of Friedrich III. While currently only the registers for
Friedrich III. are available, we think that they may be used in future work to fine tune the NER system
to achieve better performance not only on the sub-corpus of Friedrich III. but also on the whole RI. A
caveat is that the regests of the other emperors differ significantly not only in named entities but also in
linguistic variety and thus such a system may fail to generalize. Opitz and Frank (2016) manually labeled
500 randomly sampled regests with 12 medieval themes and players of interest (e.g. nobles, spiritual
institutions, war and peace or justice) and trained binary classifiers to in the end label all regests and
compute statistics about the importance of the medieval themes and players with regard to time.

Relation Extraction For relation extraction from the Regesta Imperii we work in an ”extreme” en-
vironment – no annotated data; few language resources (particularly because of the German language
variations used in the corpus); no tools like named entity taggers or chunkers that would help in iden-
tifying relations and relation arguments; and low or no redundancy in relation instances (for comput-
ing extraction reliability scores). Because of this, the inspiration for the applied methods comes from
open information extraction (Open IE), particularly work where relations are described through POS and
grammatical patterns (Banko et al., 2007), and using the assumption that binary relations often appear
in a subject-verb-object format. Wu and Weld (2010) extend a previous distantly supervised system that
learns using Wikipedia infobox relations, and describe relations (through POS and dependency patterns)
as phrases consisting of at least one verb and/or a preposition. To counter noisy extractions (often phrases
that are too long and too specific to constitute a relation), Fader et al. (2011) introduce ReVerb, where
lexical and syntactic constraints on relation expressions serve to produce cleaner extractions, with less
uninformative or incoherent expressions. To increase recall, Mausam et al. (2012) expand the patterns
by allowing relational nouns (e.g. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft ...). Patterns are gathered and gen-
eralized (e.g., from words to parts-of-speech), which boosts recall. All these relation extraction methods
rely on redundancy in the data to verify the relation patterns and the extracted candidates through vari-
ous reliability scores. This cannot be applied to the RI corpus. We rely instead on the relatively simple
structure of the regest texts and the grammatical information obtained from a parser.

6 Conclusions

We induced a Knowledge Graph from the medieval Regesta Imperii corpus. Nodes represent medieval
named entities, the (weighted) edges indicate relations between those entities, which may have occurred
at multiple times in history. High linguistic variation and code switching within single regests pose chal-
lenges for modern-day NLP systems, despite their seemingly simple structure. We added preprocessing
heuristics to prevent erroneous sentence splitting, and in the process acquired a list of nobility titles. We
explored relation classification as multi-class classification based on a binary bag-of-phrases represen-
tation of the regests. This not only gives us an option to inject further useful information into the KG
describing the encapsulated events more closely, but also allows us to explore phrases highly associated
with specific relations. The resulting Knowledge Graph was embedded in an isolated web application,
enabling the visualization and querying of the data. The data and application are shared publicly.15

For future work we are planning to further refine the Knowledge Graph, introduce more structure using
nobility titles and entity types and develop and evaluate it together with historians to adjust visualization
and querying methods to their needs.
