Abstract

Previous work on cross-lingual sequence la-
beling tasks either requires parallel data or
bridges the two languages through word-by-
word matching. Such requirements and as-
sumptions are infeasible for most languages,
especially for languages with large linguis-
tic distances, e.g., English and Chinese. In
this work, we propose a Multilingual Lan-
guage Model with deep semantic Alignment
(MLMA) to generate language-independent
representations for cross-lingual sequence la-
beling. Our methods require only monolingual
corpora with no bilingual resources at all and
take advantage of deep contextualized repre-
sentations. Experimental results show that our
approach achieves new state-of-the-art NER
and POS performance across European lan-
guages, and is also effective on distant lan-
guage pairs such as English and Chinese.1

1 Introduction

Sequence labeling tasks such as named entity
recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging are fundamental problems in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). Recent sequence label-
ing models achieve state-of-the-art performance
by combining both character-level and word-level
information (Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Ma and
Hovy, 2016; Lample et al., 2016). However, these
models heavily rely on large-scale annotated train-
ing data, which may not be available in most lan-
guages. Cross-lingual transfer learning is pro-
posed to address the label scarcity problem by
transferring annotations from high-resource lan-
guages (source languages) to low-resource lan-
guages (target languages). In this scenario, a ma-

jor challenge is how to bridge interlingual gaps
with modest resource requirements.

There is a large body of work exploring cross-
lingual transfer through language-independent
features, such as morphological features and uni-
versal POS tags for cross-lingual NER (Tsai et al.,
2016) and dependency parsers (McDonald et al.,
2011). However, these approaches require linguis-
tic knowledge for language-independent feature
engineering, which is expensive in low-resource
settings. Other work relies on bilingual resources
to transfer knowledge from source languages to
target languages. Parallel corpora are widely used
to project annotations from the source to the tar-
get side (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Ehrmann et al.,
2011; Kim et al., 2012; Wang and Manning, 2014).
These methods could achieve strong performance
with a large amount of bilingual data, which is
scarce in low-resource settings.

Recent research leverages cross-lingual word
embeddings (CLWEs) to establish inter-lingual
connections and reduce the requirements of par-
allel data to a small lexicon or even no bilin-
gual resource (Ni et al., 2017; Fang and Cohn,
2017; Xie et al., 2018). However, word embedding
spaces may not be completely isomorphic due to
language-specific linguistic properties, and there-
fore cannot be perfectly aligned. For example,
different from English, Chinese nouns do not dis-
tinguish singular and plural forms, while Spanish
nouns distinguish masculine and feminine.

On the other hand, NER tags such as person
names, organizations, and locations are shared
across different languages. Language-independent
frameworks such as universal conceptual cognitive
annotation (Abend and Rappoport, 2013), univer-
sal POS (Petrov et al., 2011a), and universal de-
pendencies (Nivre et al., 2016) are defined to rep-
resent different languages in a unified formation.
These work serves as our motivation to assume

that the semantic meanings of words from differ-
ent languages can be roughly aligned at a concep-
tual level and it is more reasonable to align deep
semantic representations instead of shallow word
embeddings. Meanwhile, monolingual contextu-
alized embeddings derived from language mod-
els have shown to be effective for extracting se-
mantic information and have achieved significant
improvement on several NLP tasks (Peters et al.,
2018).

In this paper, we propose a Multilingual Lan-
guage Model with deep semantic Alignment
(MLMA). We train MLMA on monolingual cor-
pora from each language and align its internal
states across different languages. Then MLMA
is utilized to generate language-independent rep-
resentations and to bridge the gaps between high-
resource and low-resource languages. For eval-
uation, we conduct extensive experiments on the
NER and POS benchmark datasets under cross-
lingual settings. The experiment results show that
our methods achieve substantial improvements
comparing to previous state-of-the-art methods
in European languages. We also validate our
approaches on a distant language pair, English-
Chinese, and the results are competitive with pre-
vious methods which use large-scale parallel cor-
pora. Our contributions are as follows:

1. Instead of word-level alignment, we propose
MLMA that uses contextualized representa-
tions to bridge the inter-lingual gaps.

2. We propose three methods to align contextu-
alized representations without any bilingual
resource.

3. Our methods achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on cross-lingual NER and POS
tasks in European languages, and very com-
petitive results for English-Chinese NER,
where previous work uses large parallel data.

2 Approach

Our approach belongs to the model transfer (Sec-
tion 5.2) and mainly consists of three steps:

1. Training a multilingual language model with
alignment (MLMA) using monolingual cor-
pora of the source and the target languages.
(Section 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)

2. Building a cross-lingual sequence labeling
model based on the language-independent
representations from the MLMA. (Section
2.4 and 2.5)

3. Learning the cross-lingual sequence labeling
model (with MLMA fixed) on the annotated
data of source languages and directly apply-
ing it to the target languages.

The architecture of MLMA is shown in Fig-
ure 1. In the following sections, we focus on in-
troducing the Step 1 and 2. We first present the
architecture of MLMA and describe how to build
the unsupervised multilingual alignment. Next,
we propose effective methods for collapsing the
multi-layer hidden states from MLMA into a sin-
gle representation. Finally, we introduce the se-
quence labeling model used in the experiments.

2.1 Language Model Architecture

MLMA is a language model with multi-head self-
attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). The
architecture is similar to Radford et al. (2018),
except that we combine both a forward and a
backward Transformer decoder to build a bidirec-
tional language model. Take the forward direction
as an example, given a sentence with N tokens
W = [w1, w2, · · · , wN ]T as input, we first map
the sequence of tokens W to token embeddings−→
H 0 ∈ RN×d: −→

H 0 =WEe + Ep (1)

where Ee and Ep are the embedding matrix and
the positional encoding matrix, and d is the dimen-
sion of embeddings and hidden states.

Then n blocks of transformer layers are stacked
above the token embeddings. Each block contains
a masked multi-head self-attention and a position-
wise feedforward layer. The detailed implementa-
tion is the same as Vaswani et al. (2017).

−→
H l = TransformerLayer(

−→
H l−1) (2)

where
−→
H l refers to the output of the l-th trans-

former block. Finally, the output distribution over
the next tokens is calculated through a softmax
function with tied embedding matrix.

−→
P = softmax(

−→
HnE

T
e ) (3)

For the backward direction, we calculate
←−
Hl and←−

P in an analogous way. Finally, we jointly min-
imize the negative log likelihood of the forward
and backward directions:

NLL = −
N∑
t=1

( log p(wt|w1, . . . , wt−1)

+ log p(wt|wt+1, . . . , wN ))

(4)

In a multilingual setting, we share all param-

former layers. MLMA is jointly learned through language modeling loss and alignment loss, and its internal
representations are utilized to bridge the gap between source and target languages.

eters in Transformer layers across different lan-
guages to facilitate language-agnostic representa-
tions, except that we adopt an individual embed-
ding matrix Ee for each language.

2.2 Unsupervised Distribution Alignment
We find that only sharing Transformer layers is
not enough for forcing hidden representations
from different languages into a common space, as
suggested in experiments (Section 3.4). There-
fore, we propose three methods to build cross-
lingual representations based on identical strings,
mean/variance, and average linkage.

To simplify the description, we take the align-
ment between two languages s and t as an exam-
ple, but our methods can be directly extended to
a scenario with multiple languages by adding the
alignment between each pair of languages.

Notation
For the language model, given a sentence with
N tokens, the forward internal representation−→
H l in Eq (2) can be expanded as

−→
H l =

[
−→
h l,1, · · · ,

−→
h l,k, · · · ,

−→
h l,N ]

T , where
−→
h l,k refers

to the forward hidden representation of the k-th
token in the sentence. Then we concatenate the
forward and backward hidden representations for
each token, hl,k =

−→
h l,k ⊕

←−
h l,k.

We denote the collection of the token represen-
tations hl,k at layer l from the whole corpora of
language s as Csl , which can be regarded as a sam-
pling from the deep semantic space of language s.
Similarly, Ctl is used for language t.

Identical Strings
Similar language pairs such as English and Span-
ish have a large number of identical strings shared

between their vocabularies, which are utilized as
the seed dictionary for embedding alignment in
previous work (Smith et al., 2017). Similarly, we
treat identical strings as explicit supervision sig-
nals and align the embeddings of identical strings
between different languages. The matching of the
embeddings from different languages will lead to
an implicit alignment of internal representations.
In the experiments, we directly minimize the Eu-
clidean distance between the embeddings of each
identical string across different languages:

Liden =
λiden

|W (s,t)iden |

∑
w∈W (s,t)iden

||esw − etw||

where W (s,t)iden is the set of identical strings be-
tween the vocabulary of language s and language
t, and |W (s,t)iden | refers to the number of members in
W

(s,t)
iden . λ

id is a scaling weight, and esw (e
t
w) is the

embedding of word w from embedding matrix Ese
(Ete) of language s (t).

Mean and Variance

In this section, we propose another approach to di-
rectly align the distributions of internal represen-
tations between different languages. In particular,
we leverage the mean and variance of internal dis-
tributions for alignment. We denote the mean and
variance of Csl as m

s
l and v

s
l . Similarly, m

t
l and v

t
l

refer to the mean and variance ofCtl . We minimize
the Euclidean distance between the mean and vari-
ance of language s and language t for all layers:

Lmv =

n∑
l=0

(λml ·
||msl −mtl ||
|msl |+ |mtl |

+ λvl ·
||vsl − vtl ||
|vsl |+ |vtl |

)

where λl is a scaling weight, and | · | is the L1
norm of a vector. Without the denominators, the



1031

model could escape this regularization by learning
a mean and variance with low absolute values.

In practice, rather than calculating the mean and
variance over the whole source and target corpora,
we use the mean and variance of the source and
target inner states hl,k in the current mini-batch as
an approximation.

Average Linkage

In this method, we employ another metric, aver-
age linkage, to perform a more precise point-wise
matching. The average linkage is a widely used
metric for calculating the similarity of clusters and
networks (Yim and Ramdeen, 2015; Seifoddini,
1989; Newman, 2012; Moseley and Wang, 2017).
It is sensitive to the shape, thus serves as a better
choice than mean and variance. The average link-
age measures the similarity of two sets X and Y
by calculating the averaged distance between all
members of each set:

avl(X,Y ) =
1

nX · nY

∑
x∈X

∑
y∈Y

f(x, y)

where nX (nY ) is the number of members in X
(Y ), and f is a distance function. We take Eu-
clidean distance as the distance function f and
minimize the average linkage between Csl and C

t
l :

Lavl =
n∑

l=0

λavll · [2 · avl(Csl , Ctl )

− avl(Csl , Csl )− avl(Ctl , Ctl )]
Similarly, the terms avl(Csl , C

s
l ) and avl(C

t
l , C

t
l )

are used to prevent the model from escaping this
regularization. In practice, we calculate Lavl be-
tween the source and target inner states hl,k inside
the mini-batch as an approximation.

The regularization Lavl is similar to the max-
imum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is of-
ten employed in domain adaptation (Tzeng et al.,
2014; Long et al., 2015) and style transfer (Li
et al., 2017) for images. However, different from
MMD, our method directly uses Euclidean dis-
tance instead of the kernel function.

2.3 Training of MLMA

During the training stage of MLMA, we sample
equivalent number of sentences from the monolin-
gual corpora of each language for each mini-batch.
Then MLMA is optimized through a combination
of the language modeling loss Llm and the align-
ment regularization loss Lreg. For each alignment

method, we use its corresponding alignment loss:
L =Llm + Lreg

where Llm =
∑

i∈{s,t}

λlmi ·NLLi,

Lreg ∈ {Lid, Lmv, Lavl}
where λlmi is used for balancing the convergence
speed of different languages. NLLi is the negative
log likelihood of language i in Eq (4).

2.4 Cross-lingual Representations

After the MLMA is trained, we fix its parameters
and extract the hidden states as cross-lingual con-
textualized representations (CLCRs). In this sec-
tion, we propose two effective strategies for inte-
grating these multi-layer high-dimensional repre-
sentations into downstream models.
Self-Weighted Sum For each token, we concate-
nate all layers of hidden states and feed them
into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to calcu-
late a (n + 1)-dimensional weight vector, s =
softmax(MLP(h0,k ⊕ · · · ⊕ hn,k)). Then we cal-
culate a weighted sum of these layers according to
the weight vector, CLCRk =

∑n
l=0 sl · hl,k.

Fully-Weighted Sum We introduce a weight ma-
trix, F ∈ R(n+1)×2d, with separate weights for
each hidden dimension. The weight matrix F
is softmaxed by column and used to calculate a
weighted sum of all layers for each hidden dimen-
sion, CLCRk =

∑n
l=0 Fl � hl,k, where � is the

element-wise product.
The parameters of the MLP and F are trained

during the learning of sequence labeling model.

2.5 Sequence Labeling Model

The sequence labeling model is then built on the
CLCRs. For both NER and POS tasks, we use
an LSTM-CRF model following Lample et al.
(2016), which consists of a character-level LSTM,
a word-level LSTM, and a linear-chain CRF.

More specifically, given a sequence of words as
[w1, w2, . . . , wN ], where wk is composed of a se-
quence of characters [ck,1, ck,2, . . . , ck,m]. First,
for each word wk, the character-level LSTM takes
its character sequence [ck,1, ck,2, . . . , ck,m] as in-
put and outputs a vector ek to represent this
word. Then the pre-trained CLCRk is concate-
nated with ek to form a word-level embedding
xk. Finally, the sequence of word-level embed-
dings [x1, x2, . . . , xN ] are fed into the word-level
LSTM, and the linear-chain CRF are employed to



1032

predict the probability distribution for all possible
output label sequences.

3 Experiments

We first introduce the datasets used in the exper-
iment and then the implementation details of our
models, before presenting the results on NER and
POS tasks.

3.1 Datasets

For cross-lingual NER, we evaluate the proposed
approaches on CoNLL 2002/2003 datasets (Tjong
Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der, 2003), which contain four European lan-
guages, English (en), Spanish (es), Dutch (nl),
German (de) and four entity types (person, lo-
cation, organization, and MISC). We also evalu-
ate a distant language pair, English-Chinese, on
OntoNotes(v4.0) dataset (Hovy et al., 2006). We
adopt the same dataset split and four valid entity
types (person, location, organization, and GPE) as
described in (Wang and Manning, 2014).

For cross-lingual POS, we use the Danish (da),
Dutch (nl), German (de), Greek (el), Italian (it),
Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Swedish (sv)
portion from CoNLL 2006/2007 dataset (Buch-
holz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007). Fol-
lowing previous work (Fang and Cohn, 2017),
we train the sequence labeling model on Penn
Treebank data and adopt the universal POS
tagset (Petrov et al., 2011b).

In all cases, the sequence labeling model is
trained on the source language (English) training
data and is tested on the target language test data.

3.2 Details of MLMA

We adopt a 6-layer bi-directional Transformer de-
coder with 8 attention heads. The dimension size
of hidden states and inner states are 512 and 2048,
respectively. The dropout rates after attention and
residual connection are both 0.1. We use the Adam
optimization scheme (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with
a learning rate of 0.0001 and a gradient clip norm
of 5.0. The vocabulary size of each language is
200,000, and we train the model with a sampled
softmax (Jean et al., 2015) of 8192 samples. We
only keep the sentences containing less than 200
tokens for training and group them into batches by
length. Each batch contains around 4096 tokens
for each language. The language modeling weight
λlmi is set to be 1.0 for each language. For align-

ment, λml , λ
v
l , λ

al
l are set to be 0.1, 0.01 and 1.0

for every layer l, and λiden is set to be 100.
For languages except English, the latest dump

of Wikipedia is used as monolingual corpora. For
English, we use 1B Word Benchmark (Chelba
et al., 2013) to reduce the effects of potential inter-
nal alignment in Wikipedia (Zirikly and Hagiwara,
2015; Tsai et al., 2016).

All characters are preprocessed to lowercase,
and Chinese text are converted into the simplified
version through OpenCC2. The corpora of Euro-
pean languages are tokenized by nltk (Loper and
Bird, 2002) and Chinese text is segmented using
Ltp3.

3.3 Details of Sequence Labeling Model

In our experiments, we set the hidden size of word-
level LSTM and character-level LSTM to be 300
and 100, respectively. The character embedding
size is set to be 100. We apply dropout at both
the input and the output of word-level LSTM to
prevent overfitting. The dropout rate is set to be
0.5. We train the sequence labeling model for 20
epochs using Adam optimizer with a batch size
of 20 and perform an early stopping when there
is no improvement for 3 epochs. We set the ini-
tial learning rate to be 0.001 and decay the learn-
ing rate by 0.1 for each epoch. We do not update
the pre-trained cross-lingual deep representations
from MLMA during training. For each model, we
run it five times and report the mean and standard
deviation. We disable the character-level LSTM
in English-German and English-Chinese NER as
they have a different character pattern from En-
glish. For POS, we disable the character-level
LSTM following Fang and Cohn (2017).

3.4 Results for NER

We first train a multilingual language model with-
out alignment (MLM) and report its performance
of cross-lingual NER in Table 1. The poor perfor-
mance demonstrates that only sharing part of the
parameters in a language model is far from enough
for cross-lingual transfer.

As shown in Table 1, the mean/variance align-
ment strategy (MLMA-Mv) is competitive with
previous work which utilizes extra bilingual re-
sources (Section 5.1). The average linkage strat-
egy (MLMA-Avl) performs a more precise align-

ment and gains a further improvement. We con-
ducted experiments of using all three alignments
together, and results show no significant improve-
ment over average linkage alone. These results
agree with our statements that average linkage per-
forms a more precise matching, and thus, carries
the benefits brought by the other methods.

To demonstrate the strengths of the pro-
posed cross-lingual contextualized representations
(CLCRs) over cross-lingual word embeddings
(CLWEs), we also report the results of using
CLWEs for direct model transfer in Table 1.
Specifically, we compare with the unsupervised
method MUSE from Conneau et al. (2017). The

experiment results demonstrate its effectiveness
for cross-lingual sequence labeling. The align-
ment method using identical strings (MLMA-
Iden) outperforms MUSE, suggesting that the
contextual-level representations are more effective
than the word-level ones. The other proposed
methods (MLMA-Mv and MLMA-Avl) achieve
significant improvement over MUSE and MLMA-
Iden, which shows the benefit of directly aligning
the contextualized representations.
Combination with CLWEs We further demon-
strate that CLWEs are compatible with our meth-
ods by using MUSE embeddings to initialize the
embedding layer of our multilingual language
model. The results of MLMA-Avl (init) shown in
Table 1 indicate that the CLWEs lead to a better
initialization and improved performance.
Multi-source Transfer We conduct experiments
of multi-source transfer based on method MLMA-
Avl and report the performance as MLMA-Avl
(multi) in Table 1. The experiment settings largely
follow the previous work (Mayhew et al., 2017).
They employ two source languages for each tar-
get language and use syntactic features to choose
the related source languages. For Spanish and
German, we use English and Dutch as source
languages. English and Spanish are adopted for

Dutch. The multi-source transfer leads to a sig-
nificant improvement for Spanish and German,
but a slight decline for Dutch. In the follow-
up experiment, we find that the Spanish training
set achieves a poor cross-lingual performance on
Dutch. Similar results are observed in the experi-
ments of Spanish to English and Dutch to English.
These results suggest that the cross-lingual trans-
fer may be directional, and we leave this issue for
future work.
Comparison with BERT We also compare the
performance of our MLMA with the released mul-
tilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). As shown in
Table 1, our MLMA-Avl achieves a better perfor-
mance on Spanish and Dutch. For German, BERT
achieves a high performance as it employs effec-
tive subword information through BPE. The archi-
tecture of BERT also performs better than LSTM.

It is worth mentioning that, in previous work
and this work, the corpora used in the experi-
ments are limited to the source and the target
language. In contrast, the multilingual BERT is
jointly learned on Wikipedia of 102 languages and
may benefit from a multi-hop transfer. BERT
employs a shared BPE vocabulary for different
languages, which implicitly performs a subword
alignment similar to MLMA-Iden. Meanwhile,
the proposed MLMA-Mv and MLMA-Avl meth-
ods are compatible with BERT and can be used to
align the inner states of BERT.

3.5 A Case Study of Chinese NER
We conduct experiments and evaluate our ap-
proaches on a distant language pair, English-
Chinese. The experiment results are shown in Ta-

ble 2. Wang and Manning (2014) utilize 80K par-
allel sentences for annotation projection and report
a strong performance. As Chinese and English
do not share the alphabet, the number of identi-
cal strings is significantly smaller than similar lan-
guages pairs such as English-Spanish. Therefore,
the MLMA-Iden achieves a lower result compar-
ing to MUSE which uses adversarial training. The
MLMA-Avl method performs a direct alignment
of internal representations and achieves a signif-
icant improvement over the word-level methods.
The initialization from CLWEs also proves its ef-
fectiveness for distant language pairs by gaining
further improvement and reaching a comparable
result with Wang and Manning (2014). This ex-
periment suggests that cross-lingual transfer is still
challenging between distant language pairs.

3.6 Results for POS

We evaluate our methods on another sequence la-
beling task POS, and the results are shown in Ta-
ble 3. We compare with previous studies using
unsupervised cross-lingual clustering (Fang and
Cohn, 2017) and large-scale parallel corpora (Das
and Petrov, 2011). As shown in Table 3, our mod-
els with deep semantic alignment outperform pre-
vious lexicon-based cross-lingual clustering by a
large margin. When comparing to the previous
method with a small amount of training data, the
MLMA-Avl method obtains an improved accuracy
without training data in the target languages. For
further comparison, We also list the performance
of applying the method from Xie et al. (2018) and

multilingual BERT to the POS task.4

POS mainly relies on the information of each
single word, and parallel corpora providing word
alignment are effective for cross-lingual POS.
Thus, previous annotation projection methods
through parallel corpora are strong approaches
for cross-lingual POS and often achieve a signif-
icantly better performance against previous unsu-
pervised methods. The experimental results show
that the proposed CLCRs are competitive and even
achieve better average accuracy.

3.7 Self-Weighted v.s. Fully-Weighted Sum
As shown in Table 1, 2 and 3, we observe that
Self-Weighted Sum (SWS) generally outperforms
Fully-Weighted Sum (FWS) in NER tasks, while
the opposite is true for POS tasks. SWS allows
weights to vary at each position in a sequence,
while FWS imposes adaptive weights for each hid-
den dimension. We hypothesize that NER is more
context-sensitive and requires models to adapt to
different context information, which makes SWS
a better option. On the other hand, the POS of
words is more independent across different con-
text, but certain feature dimensions in contextual-
ized representations may be critical for making a
judgment. Therefore, FWS has the edge over SWS
for its ability to select out these dimensions.

4 What is Connected during Alignment?

In this section, we dive into the MLMA and in-
vestigate the question of what is connected be-
tween different languages during the alignment.
From English 1B and Spanish Wikipedia, we ran-
domly select 1,000 sentences for each language

4The poor performance of Xie et al. (2018) on en-da is
due to the low quality of word translation pairs generated by
their method.

and extract their cross-lingual contextual represen-
tations using our MLMA-Avl model. We calculate
the nearest neighbors in cosine distance for each
word, and some of them are listed in Table 4.

In these cases, the MLMA can disambiguate
word senses according to context information.
For example, for the word brown in English, the
MLMA groups color brown with verde (green),
and name Brown with Neira (a person name in
Spanish) in the Spanish corpus. The proposed
method is different from unsupervised translation
in that, instead of learning a precise matching
between English and Spanish words, the CLCRs
establishes a high-level semantic connection be-
tween the source and the target language. The next
example demonstrates that the MLMA is able to
distinguish the part-of-speech of words. It con-
nects an English verb chair with a Spanish verb
presidir (preside), while a noun chair with a noun
asiento (seat) in Spanish. To compare with unsu-
pervised cross-lingual word embeddings, we list
the top 5 similar words calculated using MUSE.
As shown in Table 4, MUSE successfully groups
the English word brown with Spanish words that
are related to colors. However, without the help of
contextual information, its ability of word sense
disambiguation is limited.

5 Related Work

Previous work in cross-lingual transfer learning
can be roughly divided into two main branches:
annotation projection and model transfer.

5.1 Annotation Projection
In annotation projection approaches, parallel
or comparable corpora are commonly used
(Yarowsky et al., 2001; Ehrmann et al., 2011; Das
and Petrov, 2011; Li et al., 2012; Täckström et al.,



1036

2013; Wang and Manning, 2014; Ni et al., 2017).
The source language sentences of parallel corpora
are first annotated either manually or by a pre-
trained tagger. Then, annotations on the source
side are projected to the target side through word
alignment to generate distantly supervised train-
ing data. Finally, a model of the target language
is trained on the generated data. Wikipedia con-
tains multilingual articles for various topics and
can thus be used to generate parallel/comparable
corpora or even weakly annotated target language
sentences (Kim et al., 2012).

However, parallel corpora and Wikipedia can
be rare for true low-resource languages. May-
hew et al. (2017) reduce the resource requirement
by proposing a cheap translation method, which
“translates” the training data from the source to
the target language word by word through a bilin-
gual lexicon. While Xie et al. (2018) reduce the
requirement of bilingual lexicons by an unsuper-
vised word-by-word translation through CLWEs.

5.2 Model Transfer

Model transfer methods train a model on the
source language with language-independent fea-
tures. Thus, the trained model can be directly ap-
plied to the target language.

McDonald et al. (2011) design a cross-lingual
parser based on delexicalized features like uni-
versal POS tags. Täckström et al. (2012) re-
veal that cross-lingual word cluster features in-
duced using large parallel corpora are useful. Lex-
icon and Wikipedia also demonstrate effectiveness
for language-independent feature engineering.
Zirikly and Hagiwara (2015) generate multilingual
gazetteers from the source language gazetteers and
comparable corpus. Page categories and link-
age information to entries from Wikipedia are ex-
tracted as strong language-independent features
(wikifier features) (Tsai et al., 2016). Bharadwaj
et al. (2016) facilitate the cross-lingual transfer
through phonetic features, which work well be-
tween languages like Turkish, Uzbek, and Uyghur,
but are not strictly language independent. Re-
cently, CLWEs are used as language-invariant rep-
resentations for direct model transfer in NER (Ni
et al., 2017) and POS (Fang and Cohn, 2017).

Some of the previous work also proposes se-
quence labeling models with shared parameters
between languages for performing cross-lingual
knowledge transfer (Lin et al., 2018; Cotterell and

Duh, 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Ammar et al., 2016;
Kim et al., 2017). However, these models are usu-
ally obtained through joint learning and require
annotated data from the target language.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we focused on a low-resources
cross-lingual setting and proposed transfer learn-
ing methods based on the alignment of deep se-
mantic spaces between different languages. The
proposed multilingual language model bridges dif-
ferent languages by automatically learning cross-
lingual disambiguated representations. Abundant
NER and POS experiments are conducted on the
benchmark datasets. Experimental results show
that our approaches using only monolingual cor-
pora achieve improved performance comparing to
previous strong cross-lingual studies with extra re-
sources.
