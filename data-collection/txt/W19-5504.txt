Abstract

In an era when machine learning and artificial intel-
ligence have huge momentum, the data demand to
train and test models is steadily growing. We intro-
duce CoFiF, the first corpus comprising company
reports in the French language. It contains over
188 million tokens in 2655 reports, covering ref-
erence documents, annual, semestrial and trimes-
trial reports. Our main focus is on the 60 largest
French companies listed in France’s main stock in-
dices CAC40 and CAC Next 20. The corpus spans
over 20 years, ranging from 1995 to 2018. To eval-
uate this novel collection of organizational writ-
ing, we use CoFiF to generate two character-level
language models, a forward and a backward one,
which we use to demonstrate the corpus potential
on business, economics, and management research
in the French language.
The corpus is accessible on Github 1.

1 Introduction
Current research approaches progressively use machine
learning and artificial intelligence to derive knowledge from
large amounts of data. With natural language processing
(NLP) being a crucial part in this progress, knowledge extrac-
tion from textual data becomes increasingly important and
the underlying fuel, texts, are a sought source. While gen-
eral corpora exist for many languages such as The British Na-
tional Corpus [Leech, 1992] for British English, the Corpus
of Spoken Professional American English [Barlow, 2000] for
American English, or the Corpus de Français Parlé Parisien
des années 2000 (CFPP2000) [Branca-Rosoff et al., 2000]
for French, domain-specific corpora are still lacking in many
cases. Since transfer learning, particularly language models
such as ELMo [Peters et al., 2018] or BERT [Devlin et al.,
2018], is currently driving NLP research, large unlabeled cor-
pora play a progressively important role. Examples are the
1 billion word benchmark [Chelba et al., 2013], Wiki-103

Considering the domain of business and economics, espe-
cially for English, corpora such as the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) Corpus [Paul and Baker, 1992], the 10-k Corpus [Ko-
gan et al., 2009] and the 8-k Corpus [Lee et al., 2014] are
popular examples. However, no corpus to date deals with
French texts in the field of economics and finance. Such an
absence hinders the progress in applying NLP approaches on
the textual data related to the financial sector in francophone
countries, particularly France, Canada, Belgium and Switzer-
land. Hence, we present CoFiF, a corpus aggregating French
organizational writing into a source to be analysed in the area
of business, economic and management. CoFiF contains doc-
uments published by companies which have been part of the
Cotation Assistée en Continu (CAC) 403 since 2002. CAC40
contains 40 of the 100 largest companies by market capi-
talization of the stock exchange in Paris. Furthermore, the
CAC40 is France’s main stock index and is dominated by
French companies, thus, it can be taken as a representation of
French companies in general. In addition, we included com-
panies listed at the CAC Next 20 in the corpus. These com-
panies are the 20 largest ones which are listed following the
ones in the CAC40, hence, altogether both indices list the 60
largest French companies. The collected document types pro-
vide a comprehensive and factual overview of a company’s
shape. In addition, their language can also be consulted in
linguistic terms. Previous analyses of company reports for
English have shown their effect on the financial markets, for
instance, Kogan et al. linked 10-k reports to market volatil-
ity and Lee et al. used 8-k reports to predict stock price
movement in terms of [up, down, stay] [Kogan et al., 2009;
Lee et al., 2014].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we first
present previously created French corpora, both general and
specific in the field of economics and finance. Following a
description of CoFiF in section 3, we evaluate our corpus us-
ing a language model in section 4. The paper is concluded in
section 5.

2 Related Work
There is a plethora of corpora available for the French lan-
guage, both for general purposes [Abouda and Baude, 2005;
Eshkol-Taravella et al., 2010; Content et al., 1990; Guillot et
al., 2008; Kunstmann and Stein, 2006] and for specific tasks
in NLP. Vincent and Winterstein developed a French cor-
pus for sentiment analysis [Vincent and Winterstein, 2013].
Grabaretal et al. targeted reports published in the scientific
literature or used in medical education to create a French
corpus with clinical cases [Grabar et al., 2018]. Mariani et
al. presented the NLP4NLP Corpus containing scientific arti-
cles published over a period of 50-year in the field of speech
and natural language processing in various languages, includ-
ing French [Mariani et al., 2018]. Mondada et al. provided
the International Ecological Corpus of French (CIEL) which
promotes comparative analysis in the field of linguistic ecol-
ogy of spoken French in francophone countries [Mondada
and Pfänder, 2016]. The Sequoia corpus [Candito and Sed-
dah, 2012] is a syntactically annotated French corpus contain-
ing phrases from the French Europarl [Koehn, 2005], l’Est
Républicain regional newspaper articles, French Wikipedia,
and documents from the European Medicines Agency. Simi-
larly, Martineau et al. presented a morphosyntactically struc-
tured and annotated corpus (MCVF) to study morphosyn-
tactic variations based on time and social distribution [Mar-
tineau, 2008]. Targeting contemporary French, Benzitoun et
al. [Benzitoun et al., 2016] assembled the ORFÉO which
contains 4 million and 6 million words of spoken and written
French, respectively.

Regarding corpora in economics and finance for other lan-
guages, Kloptchenko et al. [Kloptchenko et al., 2004] were
the pioneers in producing a corpus based on organizational
English content for sentiment analysis for stock market prices
prediction. A significant resource is the 10-K Corpus [Ko-
gan et al., 2009] which is composed of 54,379 annual reports
in English from 10,492 different companies covering a time
interval from 1996 up to 2006. This corpus has paved the
way for further tasks in economics and financial text anal-
ysis. Similarly, Lee et al. created a corpus of 8-k reports
which is subsequently used for stock price prediction [Lee
et al., 2014]. Recently, Händschke et al. [Händschke et al.,
2018] introduced the JOCo corpus which contains 5,000 re-
ports (282M tokens) of corporate annual and social respon-
sibility reports from UK, German and US companies for the
period of 2000 to 2015.

Despite the need, there have been few efforts in creating
French corpora in economics and finance. Verlinde et al. tar-
geted Belgian and French newspapers published from 1986

to 1992 to purposely create a corpus containing 1 million
words to analyze word combinations used in economical dis-
course [Verlinde, 1997]. Similarly, Foltête focused on news-
paper articles published in France and created a corpus to an-
alyze how economical discourse changes with respect to dis-
tributional semantics and transformational grammar [Foltête,
1999]. Focussing on the differences between specialized and
non-specialized texts, Cabré presented a multilingual corpus
in the field of economics containing 78k words [Cabré, 2007].
Gautier described the construction of a corpus based on the
economic articles published in Le Monde and Les Echos for
the study of the relation of neologism and economic crises
[Gautier, 2012]. Gallego introduces a comparable corpus,
COMENEGO, in French and Spanish in business, for trans-
lation purposes and a discursive analysis approach based on
metadiscourse [Gallego-Hernández, 2013]. According to the
literature, no French corpus of significant size is provided in
finance and economics so far. To bridge this gap, we intro-
duce the first French corpus dealing with company reports.

3 Corpus Description
Our selection criteria are based on the coherence of the pub-
lished documents in the field of economics and finance. We
can categorize such documents in four types: reference doc-
uments (documents de référence), which are published an-
nually, usually in the months following the end of the cal-
endar year, and contain information regarding the finan-
cial situation and perspectives of a company; annual results
(résultats annuels) which summarizes a company’s business
and activities throughout the previous year; semestrial re-
sults (résultats semestriels) and trimestrial results (réultats
trimestriels) which are similar to the annual reports except
that they are published every six months and three months,
respectively. We included reference documents since some
companies also consider this document type as the annual
report. Moreover, we found that most companies publish
their reference documents on a regular basis. This is not
the case for other document types, particularly trimestrial re-
sults. All the collected document types report financial results
and provide information to financial analysts, institutional in-
vestors and individual shareholders. In France, the Autorité
des marchés financiers4 (Financial Markets Regulator), en-
sures standardization in reporting financial results by requir-
ing companies to follow a certain template.

Regarding the targeted companies, we focus on the CAC40
and the CAC Next 20. Both indices combined contain 60

of the 100 largest companies by market capitalization of the
stock exchange in Paris, thus we found these an appropriate
choice for our corpus. Furthermore, we consider reports pub-
lished between 1995 and 2019.

3.1 Data Retrieval and Corpus Structure
Having a strong and representative shortlist of companies in
place, collecting documents was mainly done by consulting
company’s website and downloading the reports since 1995.
Although there are companies which provide such documents
classified by year and type, in some cases the collection could
be cumbersome due to lack of organization, website perfor-
mance or non-continuous publishing (e.g. missing years). In
other cases, a company might have changed the name dur-
ing the last two decades, such as ”Orange S.A.” (previously
”France Télécom S.A.”), or is available under a new com-
pany name as outcome of a merge with another company
such as the case of ”Engie” (merged ”Gaz de France” and
”Suez”). Under these circumstances, we consulted the Web to
find archives of previously published documents, particularly
https://www.bnains.org, and included documents published
under previous company names as well. Although the con-
tent of the financial document may be similar in most cases,
such similarity is seen to a lesser extent in structure. Com-
panies publish their financial information in various formats
ranging from plain text and HTML to tabular and graphical
representations. Given the availability of searchable Portable
Document Format (PDF), we only included such documents
in our corpus. The period of 20 years was chosen based on
the availability of reports.

After downloading the reports, we extracted the texts with
the command-line software pdftotext5 in UTF-8. We did not
perform further preprocessing on the datasets as we believe
that certain tasks, such as document structure extraction, may
require different information which should not be affected
by the preprocessing step. Nonetheless, we did not observe

much noise in the collected text. To facilitate document pro-
cessing, we provide meta-data in the structure of the corpus
and the document names. Figure 1 illustrates the structure
of CoFiF where documents are classified based on stock in-
dices, CAC20 and CAC40, company name and document
types. Further information regarding the publication date is
provided in the file name. The structure and the file names in
the PDF and Text directories are identical.

3.2 Corpus Analysis
In the following step, we conducted a corpus analysis with
the help of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [Loper and
Bird, 2002] for the segmentation and counting of tokens as
well as sentences. Table 1 presents the results of the corpus
analysis based on the document types and stock indices.

4 Experiments
To evaluate the corpus and show its potential for NLP tasks
in French, particularly within the business and economic do-
main, we created two character-level language models (LM),
trained using a forward recurrent neural network (RNN) and a
backward RNN. To prepare the data for the LM, we removed
repeated empty lines and breaklines, and aligned the content
at the line beginning if necessary. Both language models
are generated using a modified version of the NLP library
flair [Akbik et al., 2018; Akbik et al., 2019]. To train both
models we apply the following parameters: hidden size
2048, nlayers 1, sequence lenght 250, mini batch size
100, and epochs 3.

In addition to serving as a language model in its natural
sense, it also provides word embeddings which can be used
in downstream tasks such as text classification or sentiment
analysis. The CoFiF word embeddings have shown their use
in a sentence boundary detection task which achieved good
performance obtaining an F1 score of 0.91 [Daudert and Ah-
madi, 2019]. To evaluate both language models, we con-

ducted an experiment based on the sentence perplexity. First,
we extracted 100 randomly chosen sentences from an annual
report external to the corpus. Second, we duplicated these
sentences and modified all 100 duplicates forcing grammat-
ical and syntactical incoherences. In the following step, we
calculated the sentence perplexity for each of the 200 test sen-
tences. Lastly, we evaluated the correctness of the model’s
predictions by using sentence perplexity scores. The model is
correct when it returns a lower perplexity score for the initial
sentence and a higher score for the modified sentence. The
prediction in incorrect When the modified sentence receives
the lower score. From the 100 test sentence pairs, our model
detected all 100 original sentences correctly. Examples are
presented in Table 2.

Furthermore, we trained a Word2Vec model [Mikolov et
al., 2013] on the cleaned textual data of CoFiF and evaluated
the quality of the retrieved word embeddings. Five sample
word embeddings with their neighbours and the respective
cosine similarity are shown in Table 3. Looking at the term
économie, the five neighbours sample suggest that the French
économie has important agriculture, énergie and innovation
sectors. France was the sixth largest agricultural producer
in the world and the largest within the European Union in
20116. The research and innovation sector is also important
to France with a total spending of 2.26% of the gross domes-
tic product (GDP) leading to the fourth position among all the
countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). The energy (énergie) sector plays its
role within the French economy (économie); France is lead-
ing worldwide when it comes to nuclear energy and, as a re-

sult, the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the seven
largest industry nations7. Similarly, one can identify the relat-
edness of terms such as bénefice(gain), profit(profit), verse-
ment(payment), solde(balance), résultat(result), and divi-
dende(dividend). Hence, we can say that the Word2Vec
model can adequately capture the relations between terms in
CoFiF.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a novel corpus comprising French
annual and semester reports named CoFiF. CoFiF contains
a total of 188 million words and is, due to its careful com-
pany selection, a good representation for organizational writ-
ing in the French business and economic domain. Our pre-
liminary analysis shows CoFiF’s potential to foster business,
economic, and management research in the French language.
Furthermore, we created two character-level language models
which can be used in manifold ways such as the calculation
of sentence perplexities or the extraction of word embeddings
for downstream tasks. Altogether, this work aims at paving
the way for further research in this area which was, until now,
hindered by the absence of a publicly available language re-
source.
