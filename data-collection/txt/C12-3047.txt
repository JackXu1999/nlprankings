ABSTRACT 

In this paper, we present a demo that translate Chinese-English organization name based on the 
input organization name’s distribution characteristics on the web. Specifically, we first 
experimentally validate two assumptions that are often used in organization name translation 
using web resources. From experimental results, we find out several distribution characteristics of 
Chinese organization name on the web. Then, we propose a web mining method based on these 
distribution characteristics. Experimental results show that our method is effective. It can 
improve the inclusion rate of correct translations for those Chinese organization names whose 
correct translations often occur on the web, and it can also improve the BLEU score and accuracy 
for those Chinese organization names whose correct translations rarely occur on the web.

1 Introduction 

Named entity (NE) translation is very important to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
tasks, such as cross-language information retrieval and data-driven machine translation. 
Generally NE translation has three main sub-tasks which are person name (PER) translation, 
location name (LOC) translation, and organization name (ON) translation. And ON translation is 
attracting more and more research attention.  

There are a large amount of resources on the web, thus researchers usually assume that for every 
NE to be translated, its correct translation exists somewhere on the web. Based on this 
assumption, recent researchers (Y.Al-Onaizan et al., 2002, Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2007, 
Yang et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2009, Ren et al., 2009, and so on) have focused on translating ON 
with the assistance of web resources. And the performance of ON translation using web resources 
depends greatly on the solution of the following problem: how can we find the web pages that 
contain the correct translations effectively? Solving this problem usually involves some query 
construction methods. Some researchers (Huang et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2009, Ren et al., 2009, 
and so on) prefer to constructing bilingual queries to find the web pages that contain the correct 
translations. They further propose another assumption that both the input NE and its correct 
translation exist somewhere in some mix-language web pages. Based on this assumption, they 
think bilingual queries are the most useful clues that can be used to find these web pages. 

These two assumptions are essential for those ON translation methods using web resources. Their 
validity will determine the validity of those ON translation methods using web resources. So we 
think it is very necessary to validate these two assumptions experimentally. However, to our best 
knowledge, there are no related works on the research of validating these two assumptions.  

In this paper, we focus on the following two issues. The first issue is to experimentally validate 
these two assumptions. The second issue is to propose an effective web mining method for 
Chinese ON translation.  

2 Our Basic Idea 

In this section, we carried out some experiments to validate these two assumptions. We use some 
bilingual ON translation pairs as test data to validate whether these ON translation pairs and their 
monolingual ON parts can be easily found on the web. The test data are extracted from 
LDC2005T34. In order to analyze the validity of these two assumptions thoroughly, we divide 
these ON translation pairs into different groups according to the keyword types of their Chinese 
parts. And 20 groups that have the maximal amount of ON translation pairs are selected as final 
test data. In our experiments, following three kinds of queries are constructed for every ON 
translation pair in the test data: 

Q1: only the Chinese ON. 

Q2: only the English ON. 

Q3: the ON translation pair. 

We obtain at most 10 web pages from Bing (http://www.bing.com/) for every query, and 
compare the inclusion rates of different test groups respectively. For Q1 and Q2, the inclusion 
rate is defined as the percentage of ON translation pairs whose queries are completely contained 

378



in the returned web pages. And for Q3, the inclusion rate is defined as the percentage of ON 
translation pairs whose Chinese parts and English parts are both contained in the returned web 
pages. And the experimental results are shown in table 1.

TABLE 1. INCLUSION RATE COMPARISONS 

From table 1 we can draw following conclusions.  

The first one is that the correct translations for most of Chinese ONs do exist on the web, but 
more effective clues are needed to find them. Besides, experimental results also tell us that only 
bilingual query is not enough to find the web pages that contain the correct translations. This 
conclusion can be further confirmed by another experiment whose results are denoted as Q3’ in 
table 1. The query construction method for Q3’ is the same as the method for Q3, but the 
definition of inclusion rate between them is different. And the inclusion rate for Q3’ is defined as 
the percentage of ON translation pairs whose English parts are contained in the returned web 
pages. In fact, the experimental results of Q3’ are the upper bound of the correct translation 
inclusion rate that can be obtained by using bilingual queries. But they are still far lower than the 
results of Q2, which is the true inclusion rate of the correct translations.  

The second conclusion is that the inclusion rates for different types of Chinese ON are different 
greatly. To further investigate this conclusion, we pick out some ON translation pairs that have 

379



the highest inclusion rate for Q2 and Q3’. We find out that most of the ONs in these ON 
translation pairs are multinational companies, government agencies, research institutes, university 
names and so on. The ONs in these ON translation pairs often occur on the web and the available 
web resources for them are huge. For such kind of an ON translation pair, it is easier to find both 
some monolingual web pages that contain one of its monolingual ONs and some mix-language 
web pages that contain the source ON part and the target ON part. On the other hand, we also 
pick out some ON translation pairs that have the lowest inclusion rate for Q2 and Q3’. We find 
out that the ONs in these ON translation pairs rarely occur on the web directly, and most of the 
ONs in these ON translation pairs have following two characteristics. Firstly they usually have a 
lot of modifiers, and the lengths of them are long too. Secondly, there are usually some nested 
sub-ONs in them. Based on these characteristics, we think if the ON translation pairs that rarely 
occur on the web were segmented into several small translation pairs (such as chunk translation 
pairs), the inclusion rate of these small translation pairs would improve. And further experiments 
confirm our idea. These experimental results are shown in table 2. In table 2, the test data are 
extracted from the ON translation pairs whose English parts cannot be found on the web. Three 
types of chunks in the Chinese ON parts are defined as [Chen and Zong, 2008] did, and these 
chunks are Regionally Restrictive Chunk (RC), Keyword Chunk (KC), and Middle Specification 
Chunk (MC). The test ON translation pairs are chunked and aligned manually and every chunk 
translation pair is viewed as a new ON translation pair. From table 2 we find that both the 
monolingual chunk parts and the chunk translation pairs are easier to be found on the web. We 
take our above idea as the third conclusion. Moreover, from the inclusion rates for Q1 and Q2 in 
table 2 we can see that smaller text units are easier to be found on the web, so this conclusion is 
also suitable to those ON translation pairs that often occur on the web.

3 Our Web Mining Method for Chinese ON Translation 

3.1 Motivations of Our Method 

Based on above analysis, we design a web mining method for Chinese-English ON translation as 
shown in Fig 1.  

Input:      a Chinese ON Oc to be translated 
Output:  a Query set QS and a recommended translation result 
Algorithm:  
1. Segment Oc  into RCc, MCc, and KCc,. 
2. Generate translation candidates for Oc and the segmented chunks, denote these translation 

candidates as Oe, RCe, MCe, and KCe. Add “Oc + Oe”, “Oc + RCe”, “Oc + KCe”, and “Oc + 
MCe” into QS. Take RCe, MCe, and KCe as queries respectively and goto step 3. 

3. Submit input query to search engine and revise this query according to some rules. Repeat 
this procedure until the input query cannot be revised any more. 

4. Take “RCe + MCe”, “KCe + RCe” and “KCe + MCe” as queries respectively and goto step 3. 
5. Take “RCe + MCe + KCe”, “KCe + RCe + MCe” and “KCe + MCe + RCe” as queries 

respectively and goto step 3.  
6. If there is a query that has been revised in step 5, take it as the recommended translation 

result. Otherwise, “RCe MCe KCe” is selected as the recommended translation result. Add 
this recommended result into QS. 

7. Return QS and the recommended translation result.  

FIGURE 1. OUR WEB MINING METHOD  

In Fig 1, we use NEUTrans [Xiao et al., 2009] system to generate translation candidates for the 
input. The training corpus for NEUTrans consists of about 370K bilingual sentences that are 
extracted from the corpora of LDC2005T10, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14 and LDC2005T06. 

In the third step of Fig 1, for a given query q (its original Chinese source text is denoted as qc) 
and the returned web pages, one of following rules is used to revise q, and we denote the revised 
result as  q’. 

Rule 1: If q is completely contained in the web pages, take q as q’.  

Rule 2: If q cannot be completely contained in the web pages, and if we can find such a 
continuous English text s in a web page that is subjected to following three conditions, take s as 
q’. 

(1) Submit s to search engine and it can be completely contained in the returned web pages. 

(2) s has the largest similarity with q. And the similarity is computed with following formula 1.  

381



( , )
( , )

( ) ( )

SameWord q s
Sim q s

Len q Len s
= +     (1) 

This condition is required to solve the reordering problem in ON translation. 

(3) If there is a word wi in s that does not appear in q, we require that wi must have at least one 
dictionary translation item that appears in qc or wi must not have any dictionary translation items. 
This condition is required to solve the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) translation problem and the 
translation item selection problem in ON translation. 

Rule 3: If q cannot be revised by rule 1 and rule 2, take q as q’ directly. 

4 Experiments 

In this section, we evaluate the obtained recommended translation results with the metrics of 
BLEU score and accuracy. In this experiment, test data consists of 500 Chinese ONs that are 
randomly selected from those Chinese ONs whose correct translations don’t exist on the web. 
The entire test ONs are chunked manually. Experimental results are shown in table 3.

TABLE 3. RESULTS OF THE SECOND EXPERIMENT 

From these results we can see that our method can improve the efficiency of web mining greatly 
for Chinese ON translation. Compared with the baseline systems, our method obtains higher 
inclusion rate and higher translation performance. 

Conclusions 

The main contribution of this paper is that we validate the two assumptions that are often used in 
ON translation using web resources. Another contribution of this paper is that we find out some 
distribution characteristics of Chinese ON on the web. These distribution characteristics are very 
useful for designing appropriate web mining method for Chinese ON translation using web 
resources. Besides, we propose a novel web mining method based on these distribution 
characteristic for Chinese ON translation. And experimental results show that our method is 
effective.
