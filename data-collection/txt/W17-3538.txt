Abstract

Monitoring and analysis of complex phenom-
ena attract the attention of both academy and
industry. Dealing with data produced by
complex phenomena requires the use of ad-
vance computational intelligence techniques.
Namely, linguistic description of complex
phenomena constitutes a mature research line.
It is supported by the Computational Theory
of Perceptions grounded on the Fuzzy Sets
Theory. Its aim is the development of com-
putational systems with the ability to generate
vague descriptions of the world in a similar
way how humans do. This is a human-centric
and multi-disciplinary research work. More-
over, its success is a matter of careful design;
thus, developers play a key role. The rLDCP
R package was designed to facilitate the de-
velopment of new applications. This demo in-
troduces the use of rLDCP, for both beginners
and advance developers, in practical use cases.

1 Introduction

Trivino and Sugeno (2013) defined a framework
for Linguistic Description of Complex Phenomena
(LDCP). It is based on the Computational Theory of
Perceptions (CTP) introduced by Zadeh (2001) as a
new tool for paving the way from computing with
numbers to computing with words (Zadeh, 1999).
CTP is rooted in the computational intelligence tech-
nique best suited to deal with approximate reason-
ing and vague concepts, i.e., the Fuzzy Sets The-
ory (Zadeh, 1965; Trillas and Eciolaza, 2015).

LDCP has already been successfully applied in
several multi-disciplinary projects. For example:

describing big data (Conde-Clemente et al., 2017b);
advising how to save energy at home (Conde-
Clemente et al., 2016); describing physical activ-
ity (Sanchez-Valdes et al., 2016); describing drivers’
behavior in driving simulations (Eciolaza et al.,
2013); or describing double stars in astronomy (Ar-
guelles and Trivino, 2013).

Figure 1 depicts the LDCP architecture for Nat-
ural Language Generation in Data-to-text applica-
tions (NLG/D2T). It is inspired on the well-known
NLG pipeline proposed by Reiter and Dale (2000).
The development of new applications with LDCP
comprises the following steps:

• Careful analysis of the phenomenon under con-
sideration, regarding: communicative goal, au-
dience background, and the set of natural lan-
guage expressions (corpus) most commonly
used in the context of the application domain.

• Design of a computational structure (the so-
called Granular Linguistic Model of the Phe-
nomenon, GLMP) which organizes all related
perceptions in a similar way how humans usu-
ally organize their experience by means of nat-
ural language.

• Design of a Report Template easy to customize
in accordance with the audience requirements.

• Implementation of a computational system able
to collect and process raw data, interpret them
according to the previously defined GLMP, and
producing the Report with the most relevant in-
formation to convey to end-users.

Conde-Clemente et al. (2017a) have developed an
R package called rLDCP1 which constitutes a first
implementation in R of the steps enumerated above.
Thus, it facilitates the use of the LDCP architecture
in new applications.

2 Structure of the Demo

This demo describes how to use rLDCP from
scratch. Firstly, we explain how to download and
install rLDCP. Secondly, we detail how to run step
by step the toy example ComfortableRoom from the
point of view of beginners and advance developers.
The goal is describing the comfort in a room with re-
spect to temperature and light intensity data values
previously stored in a “.csv” file.

Then, we show how to use rLDCP for building a
real application: The inProfilePhoto mobile app. We
implement with rLDCP the application described
in (Conde-Clemente et al., 2013) where an NLG sys-
tem guided a person with visual disabilities to take
his/her own profile photos.
