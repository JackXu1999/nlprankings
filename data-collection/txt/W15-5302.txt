Abstract

We present an account of analytic verb
forms in a treebank of Czech texts. Ac-
cording to the Czech linguistic tradition,
description of periphrastic constructions is
a task for morphology. On the other hand,
their components cannot be analyzed sep-
arately from syntax. We show how the
paradigmatic and syntagmatic views can
be represented within a single framework.

1 Introduction

Analytic verb forms (henceforth AVFs) consist of
one or more auxiliaries and a content verb. The
auxiliaries can be seen either as marking the con-
tent verb with morphological categories or as be-
ing part of a multi-word expression, to which the
categories are assigned. This is the perspective
taken by all standard grammar books of Czech,
which treat AVFs as a morphological rather than
a syntactic phenomenon. AVFs are listed in con-
jugation paradigms quite like synthetic forms for a
good reason: from a meaning-based view, whether
a certain category in a certain language happens to
be expressed by a single word or a string of words
is an epiphenomenon.

From a different perspective, each of the com-
ponents has its role in satisfying a syntactic gram-
maticality constraint and in making a contribution
to the lexical, grammatical or semantic meaning
of the whole. This approach is common in both
corpus and generative linguistics (including the-
ories such as LFG or HPSG),1 where each form
is treated as a syntactic word and AVFs belong to
the domain of syntax. As a result, morphological
categories are not assigned to units spanning word
boundaries. This is for several reasons: (i) an AVF
does not emerge as a single orthographical word

1See, e.g., Webelhuth (1995), Dalrymple (1999), Pollard
and Sag (1994).

(often even phonological word); (ii) AVFs may
be expressed by a potentially discontinuous string
of a content verb and multiple auxiliaries, some-
times in an order determined by information struc-
ture rather than by rules of morphology or syntax
proper; (iii) some auxiliary forms share properties
with some content words – like weak pronouns,
the past tense auxiliary is a 2nd position clitic.

Our claim is that the two views are compati-
ble, complementary and amenable to formaliza-
tion within a single framework, combining the
traditional paradigmatic view with a syntagmatic
view. This reconciliatory effort is part of a more
general goal: a choice of different interpretations
of annotated corpus data, depending on the prefer-
ences of a user or an application.

AVFs are assigned a syntactic structure: the (fi-
nite) auxiliary is treated as the surface head, gov-
erning the rest of the form – the deep head.2

In Czech, AVFs are used to express the verbal
categories of mood, tense and voice in periphrastic
passive (all moods and tenses), in periphrastic fu-
ture, in 1st and 2nd person past tense, in pluper-
fect and in present and past conditional. In all
these forms the auxiliary is být ‘to be’. Here we
focus on past tense and conditional forms, includ-
ing pluperfect and past conditional, but the solu-
tion works for all the above AVFs, and covers also
negation of some components of the AVFs by the
prefix ne- and can be extended to some other kinds
of function words, such as prepositions and con-
junctions. In (1)–(4) below we show some prop-
erties of the past and conditional forms. The fi-
nite auxiliary is marked for person, number and
mood, while the l-participle3 is marked for gender
and number. Past tense (1) consists of the aux-
iliary in the present tense and the l-participle of

rization” or “imposition of valency requirements.”

3We avoid the frequently used term past participle be-
cause the same form is also used in present conditional.

the content verb. Present conditional (2) consists
of the conditional auxiliary and the content verb’s
l-participle. Past conditional (3) includes an addi-
tional l-participle of the auxiliary. In (4) we show
that other words can be inserted, the auxiliary
l-participle can be repeated, and any l-participle
can be negated.

We exemplify the solution using a treebank of
Czech. The framework is based on the HPSG.4

The annotation, originally produced by a stochas-
tic dependency parser, is checked by a formal
grammar, using a valency lexicon and imple-
mented in Trale.5 Trees complying with grammat-
ical and lexical constraints are augmented with in-
formation derived from the lexicon and any anno-
tation provided by a stochastic parser.

2 Previous Work

Grammars of Czech take a paradigmatic perspec-
tive, treating AVFs as an exclusively morphologi-
cal phenomenon (Karlík et al., 1995; Cvrček et al.,
2010; Komárek et al., 1986), glossed over without
describing their syntagmatic and word-order prop-
erties. In Komárek et al. (1986), components of
AVFs are assigned a particular grammatical mean-
ing (person, number, tense, mood, voice) but their
syntactic status is not specified.

The syntagmatic approach has been introduced
to Czech by Veselovská (2003) and Veselovská

4See, e.g., Pollard and Sag (1994).
5See http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/hpsg/archive/

projects/trale/. For more details see Jelínek et al. (2014).

and Karlík (2004), who analyze past tense and pe-
riphrastic passive within the Minimalist Program.
A non-transformational account was pursued by
Karel Oliva in an HPSG-inspired prototype gram-
mar checker of Czech (Avgustinova et al., 1995).
HPSG and LFG have been used to account for sim-
ilar phenomena in closely related Polish, where
the border between morphology and syntax is even
less apparent than in Czech: all forms of the past
tense and conditional auxiliaries are floating suf-
fixes, attached either directly to the l-participle,
or to some other preceding word. In the follow-
ing, we briefly review several proposals for Polish,
with an extension to Czech.

Based on the analysis of similar phenomena
in West European languages, Borsley (1999) pro-
poses two structures for modelling Polish AVFs:
(i) classic VP complementation where the auxil-
iary is a subject-raising verb selecting a phrasal
complement headed by an l-participle (Fig. 1),
and (ii) flat structures where the auxiliary subcat-
egorizes for an l-participle and its complements
(Fig. 2).6 The former is used for future tense while
the latter for present conditional and past tense.
This distinction is motivated by the ability or in-
ability of the auxiliary to be preceded by the asso-
ciated l-participle and its complements: while the
future auxiliary allows for VP-preposing, the other
auxiliaries are prohibitive in this respect.

Kupść (2000) follows Borsley (1999) but rejects
the flat structure for past tense and present con-
ditional as it makes incorrect predictions with re-
spect to clitic climbing. Instead, she assumes VP
complementation for all AVFs.

Kupść and Tseng (2005) argue against the uni-
fied treatment of AVFs. Only the future tense aux-
iliary behaves like a full syntactic word. In con-
trast, the forms of conditional auxiliary, albeit syn-

tactic words, are clitics and thus subject to spe-
cific word order constraints (dependencies on var-
ious clitic hosts). Past tense is viewed as a sim-
ple tense and the past tense agreement markings
are treated as inflectional elements, even if they
are not attached to the l-participle. This analysis
builds on (i) an observation that agreement mark-
ings are much more closely bound to the preceding
word than conditional clitics, and (ii) the fact that
there are no agreement markings used in the third
person. As a result, the l-participle becomes the
head of the whole structure. In order to ensure that
the agreement marking appears somewhere in the
structure the head acts as its trigger, carried by an
agreement marker, either the head itself (Fig. 3),
or some other preceding element (Fig. 4).

In light of diachronic and comparative consider-
ations, Tseng and Kupść (2006) and Tseng (2009)
extend the analysis of Kupść and Tseng (2005)
to other Slavic languages, including Czech. The
Czech past auxiliary forms are at the same time
syntactic words and clitics with a restricted distri-
bution (2nd position, cannot be negated). More-
over, the 2nd person singular clitic -s is similar
to the Polish floating suffixes, suggesting that the
head is the l-participle. As a result, the analysis
of the Polish past tense can be applied to Czech
with only a slight modification: the agreement
markings are carried (mostly) by syntactic rather
than morphological elements. No changes are pro-
posed for the analysis of the Czech conditional
either, where the only complication is the sepa-
rable ending -s in the 2nd person singular (bys).
However, the extremely restricted distribution of
this phenomenon (only in combination with the
si and se reflexives, resulting in the sis and ses
forms) does not motivate treating Czech condi-
tional structures like Polish past tense structures.
The authors admit that the analysis based on the
standard VP complementation is equally possible.

3 Our Approach

3.1 Two Types of Heads: Surface and Deep
In addition to strictly linguistic criteria for an op-
timal analysis of AVFs, our choice of the core rep-
resentation format was influenced by the treebank
design, which should allow for the derivation of
syntactic structure and categorial labels of vari-
ous shapes and flavours to be used in queries, re-
sponses and exported data. Adopting a uniform
analysis for all AVFs simplifies the task. Each
AVF is represented as a syntactic phrase with two
constituents: a surface head daughter represent-
ing the auxiliary, and a deep head daughter rep-
resenting the auxiliary’s VP complement, which
includes the content verb.7 Multiple auxiliaries
within a single AVF are surface heads within re-
cursively embedded deep heads (see Fig. 5).8

3.2 Modifications of the HPSG Signature
HPSG represents linguistic data as typed feature
structures. Words and phrases are subtypes of
sign, a structure representing their form, meaning
and combinatorial properties. Fig. 6 shows a sim-
plified representation of an English sentence dogs
bark. Types are in italics, attributes in upright cap-
itals, boxed numbers indicate identity of values.

Each word consists of two parts: PHONOL-
OGY for the analyzed string and SS (SYNSEM)
for its paradigmatic analysis. Phrases have two
additional attributes: SD (SUBJECT-DAUGHTER)
and HD (HEAD-DAUGHTER). The value of SS
has L (LOCAL) as its single attribute; its NON-
LOCAL counterpart, used for discontinuous con-
stituents, is not relevant for our example. The CAT
(CATEGORY) attribute specifies (i) morphosyntac-
tic properties of the expression as its HEAD fea-
tures and (ii) its VALENCY. The CONT (CONTENT)
attribute is responsible for semantic interpretation.

7Cf. Przepiórkowski (2007) for an equivalent distinction
between syntactic and semantic heads.

8The node labels in Fig. 5 are actually feature structure
attributes modelling phrasal daughters, abbreviated as SH and
DH in Fig. 7.

Figure 6: An HPSG representation of a sentence.

Some values are shared due to Head Feature Prin-
ciple – HFP, projecting features of the head daugh-
ter to its phrasal mother, Valency Principle – ValP,
a general valency satisfaction mechanism, and Se-
mantics Principle. Morphosyntactic categories of
the noun relevant for pronominal reference are
the properties of CONTENT’s INDEX, while those
of the verb relevant for agreement are specified
indirectly, as properties of its subject. For lan-
guages with rich morphology, NP-internal agree-
ment and null subjects, such as Czech, other ar-
rangements of morphosyntactic and valency fea-
tures have been proposed.

In addition to the introduction of surface and
deep heads, the standard HPSG signature has been
modified in two main aspects: (i) at least in the
current version, attributes such as LOCAL and
HEAD are missing to simplify annotation of ex-
tensive data – discontinuities are treated as word
order variations and head features are the value
of CATEGORY; and (ii) the signature is extended
by introducing a cross-clasification of morpholog-
ical and morphosyntactic categories along three
dimensions: morphological (inflectional), syntac-
tic and semantic (lexical).9 This is useful espe-
cially for word classes where classification crite-
ria in the three dimensions do not coincide, such

9See Rosen (2014) for more details.

as numerals and pronouns. Their standard defini-
tions are based on semantic criteria, but otherwise
cardinal numerals and personal pronouns behave
like nouns, whereas ordinal numerals and posses-
sive pronouns behave like adjectives. The cross-
classification can also be used to model some regu-
lar derivational relations, e.g., deverbal nouns and
adjectives (inflectional classes) are derived from
verbs (lexical class).

3.3 Representing Analytic Categories
To accommodate AVFs, the 3D classification has
been extended by an analytic dimension. The
AC attribute specifies categories appropriate to the
AVF as a whole. A verbal AC includes three ba-
sic properties: TENSE, MOOD and VOICE. Their
values are encoded in the lexical specifications of
function words, including the deep head’s con-
tribution, which is mediated through the valency
frame of the auxiliary, including the content verb’s
ALEMMA. The rest is the task of ValP and HFP.
More specifically, the surface head and its mother
share their head features, including the analytic
categories, and their deep valency frames – the
deep structure is thus available in the phrasal cat-
egory. Since AC is a head feature, tense, mood
and voice are projected from the auxiliary as the
surface head of the AVF.

3.4 An Example
The mechanism is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 7, us-
ing the past conditional form of the verb spát ‘to
sleep’ (5).10

(5) nebyl
be.PTCP.M.SG.NEG

bych
be.COND.1SG

spal
sleep.PTCP.M.SG

‘I wouldn’t have slept’

Past conditional consists of the finite condi-
tional auxiliary (bych), the l-participle form of the
‘to be’ auxiliary (nebyl) and the l-participle of the
content verb (spal).11

10Fig. 5 ignores word order, which is specified within the
PHON list of the phrase.

11Past conditional may include additional l-participle aux-
iliaries with the meaning unchanged: an iterative and a plain
form (6). Passive past conditional, where two l-participle
auxiliaries are obligatory (7), shows that the iterative is used
to avoid two identical l-participles.

(6) nebyl
be.PTCP.M.SG.NEG

bych
be.COND.1SG

The auxiliary bych is the surface head of the en-
tire structure (see Fig. 5). Its sister phrase, i.e.,
nebyl spal, is the deep head, consisting of nebyl
and spal as the surface and the deep head daughter.
The auxiliary bych takes a single l-participle, un-
specified as a content verb or auxiliary (see Fig. 8
below). This distinction, related to the interpre-
tation of tense and/or voice of the AVF, is han-
dled by grammar – see (8)–(12) below. In our
example, the conditional auxiliary takes an aux-
iliary form nebyl, which in turn can take another
l-participle as part of (i) indicative pluperfect (as
in byl spal, ‘he had slept’), or (ii) past conditional,
as in our example. It is the presence or absence of
the conditional auxiliary that identifies the struc-
ture as conditional or indicative. The substructure
nebyl spal determines its tense as past, the result-
ing phrase is thus identified as past conditional.

The binary tree shown in Fig. 5 is represented
as a feature structure of the sdheaded type (i.e., a
surface/deep-headed phrase) in Fig. 7. The struc-
ture is similar to that in Fig. 6, except for the
additions and some abbreviations: PH stands for
PHONOLOGY, SH for the surface head daughter,
DH for the deep head daughter, C for CATEGORY
and COMPS for non-subject valency.12

The C attribute consists of three parts, repre-
senting three aspects of the category: analytic in
AC, inflectional in IC and lexical in LC.13 The AC
attribute includes the lemma of the content verb
(ALEMMA, shared as 2 with the lexical deep head
and all its deep head projections), its mood, po-
larity (minus due to the negated auxiliary nebyl),
tense and voice (actv for active). As in ALEMMA,
3 shows that the lexical deep head shares AVOICE
with its projections. AMOOD and ATENSE are un-
specified, because they can be determined only
when the AVF is evaluated as a whole. E.g.,
the embedded DH phrase nebyl spal can be either
part of indicative pluperfect or past conditional
and the content verb participle spal can be part of
past or pluperfect indicative, pluperfect indicative,
present conditional or past conditional.

Figure 7: Analysis of nebyl bych spal.

Values of the other two attributes IC and LC are
abbreviated: the categorial type is followed by a
list of attribute values. More importantly, they re-
fer only to the surface head of the phrase. They
are obtained from the input parse. The grammar
checks that some of them (person, number, also
gender) agree with corresponding values in the

13



rest of the predicate and/or in the subject.
Inflectional properties of the surface head as

the finite conditional auxiliary (iFinCond) are first
person singular of the lemma být. As the value of
LC shows, bych is an imperf ective positive (plus)
form of the verb být.

The top-level SS part, concerning the entire
phrase, is followed by two daughters: (i) SH
bych, whose categorial properties are identified
with those of the whole phrase ( 1 , due to HFP),
and whose single valency is identified with the SS
part of its deep head sister ( 5 ); and (ii) DH nebyl
spal. As for AC, the negative polarity minus as the
value of APOL is due to the negative form nebyl.
The rather technical APPLE attribute specifies the
number of l-participles (more) and helps to deter-
mine AMOOD and ATENSE. The attributes IC and
LC refer only to the l-participle (iLPple) nebyl as
the surface head of the embedded phrase in sin-
gular masculine animate. LC (the lexical cate-
gory) states that nebyl is a negative form of the
imperf ective auxiliary být.

The COMPS (non-subject valency) list is empty
– the phrase nebyl spal is saturated. It is made up
of DH, the content verb spal, and SH, the auxil-
iary participle nebyl, whose C is shared with that
its mother’s C ( 4 ) and whose single item on the
COMPS list ( 6 ) is identified with its deep head sis-
ter, the content verb’s SS. The categorial features
of the content verb are specified in SS|C. The form
is positive (APOL plus) and the phrase spal con-
sists of the single form (APPLE one). As above,
the values of the IC and LC attributes refer to the
form spát itself: lemma = spát, masculine animate
form (ma), imperf ective voice, polarity positive
(plus), non-reflexive (reflno) content verb (lVerb-
Main). The intransitive content verb has no non-
subject valency – the COMPS list is empty.

Representations of AVFs are built from: (i)
skeletal phrase structures, converted from depen-
dency trees produced by the parser, including mor-
phosyntactic information about the terminals, and
(ii) valency of auxiliaries (except for subject, va-
lency of content verbs are irrelevant for analytic
predicates).

3.5 Lexical Entries for the Auxiliaries

The forms bych and nebyl, used in Fig. 7, are de-
rived from lexical entries shown in Figs. 8 and 9.

Figure 8: Lexical entry for the conditional auxil-
iary (e.g., bych).

Fig. 8 describes the conditional auxiliary irre-
spective of person or number, i.e., including bych.
The value of C determines the conditional mood
(in AMOOD) for the whole AVF. Its voice is the
same as the voice of its l-participle complement
and of the entire structure. Inflectional category is
finite conditional and lexically a form of the im-
perfective auxiliary být (lVerbAux). The valency
(COMPS) specifies an l-participle (iLPple) whose
deep valency is shared with that of bych itself.
The subject of bych is also shared with that of its
complement, including a potentially null subject.
The lexical entry for the form nebyl in Fig. 9 dif-
fers from the entry for bych in the following re-
spects: (i) no value of mood is present (there is
no AMOOD in the AC attribute), (ii) the type of
the IC attribute is iLPle, i.e., the form nebyl is an
l-participle, and (iii) there is an SC (syntactic cat-
egory) attribute whose sLPple value states that the
form is a syntactic participle rather than iFinPlain,
reserved for 3rd person l-participles.

3.6 Constraints for the Analytic Categories

Additional specifications are due to constraints of
the grammar. Deep and surface heads share their
ALEMMAs (8), deep head shares AVOICE with its
auxiliary (9), l-participle surface head is marked as
APPLE:more if the deep head is also an l-participle
(10), tense is determined by the mood and num-

4 Discussion

We presented a uniform and compact approach
to the annotation of AVFs, supporting effective
search options in a treebank. Information about
an AVF as a whole is contained in its analytic cat-
egory (AC, Fig. 7) in the phrasal node represent-
ing this form (Fig. 5). E.g., content verbs in past
conditional can be retrieved by a straightforward
query quoting appropriate values of the ACAT at-
tributes. The entire AVF, including auxiliaries, is
retrieved when the selection is extended by all sur-
face and deep heads along the analytic projection
of the content verb.

This is an advantage over an approach adopted,
e.g., in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT).14

On its analytic level,15 auxiliaries are immedi-
ate dependents of a content verb (unless coordi-
nation is involved) and sisters of dependents of
other types. Thus it is not easy to identify AVFs
and their type or to infer their properties, e.g., as
a response to a query. On the PDT’s tectogram-
matical level the auxiliaries are absent: an AVF is
represented as a single complex node, but compo-
nents of the complex node on the analytic level can
be recovered since the representations on the two
levels are interlinked. However, the corpus anno-
tated on the tectogrammatical level is too small for
many research tasks.

AVFs can have a complex internal syntax. If
there is a single auxiliary for two or more coordi-
nated content verbs (e.g., in Já jsem přišel a viděl.
‘I came and saw’), the two content verbs as well
as the predicate are identified as active past in-
dicative forms. On the other hand, such structures
are very difficult to identify on the PDT analytic
layer. Searching, e.g., for all present condition-
als, requires a complex query, based on detailed
knowledge of the PDT representation.

The automatically determined analytic cate-
gories can be projected to a different annotation
format, including PDT or CoNLL-U.16 At the very
least, the annotation of content verbs can be ex-
tended by analytically determined specification of
mood, tense and voice. In addition to theoret-
ical interest, some NLP applications may profit
from the identification of AVFs as a distinctive
unit with specific properties. While a certain lan-

tax rather than anything related to AVFs.

guage tends to express morphological meanings
analytically, using auxiliaries and other function
words, a different (synthetic) language may avoid
AVFs. Identification of such equivalent units may
improve the quality of parallel texts alignment and
machine translation. Similarly, a parser trained on
texts where such units are identified can produce
better results.

The first release of a part of the Czech National
Corpus annotated in the style of the PDT ana-
lytic level is due soon. A pilot treebank including
the proposed annotation of analytic categories will
follow, supplemented by the formal grammar and
lexicon. The planned size is in the order of tens of
millions of words. The annotation will include an-
alytic categories and other information added by
the grammar and the lexicon, or a flag identifying
a failure in the application of the grammar and its
possible reason, while the annotation will retain
only information from the parser. At present, the
grammar and the lexicon are developed and tested
on a sample of 1000 sentences from the PDT anno-
tation manual,17 covering a wide range of linguis-
tic phenomena. A proper evaluation is previewed
on a larger sample extracted from real corpus texts.
