Abstract

This document describes the senti.ue
system and how it was used for partici-
pation in SemEval-2014 Task 9 challenge.
Our system is an evolution of our prior
work, also used in last year’s edition of
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. This sys-
tem maintains a supervised machine learn-
ing approach to classify the tweet overall
sentiment, but with a change in the used
features and the algorithm. We use a re-
stricted set of 47 features in subtask B and
31 features in subtask A.
In the constrained mode, and for the five
data sources, senti.ue achieved a score
between 78,72 and 84,05 in subtask A, and
a score between 55,31 and 71,39 in sub-
task B. For the unconstrained mode, our
score was slightly below, except for one
case in subtask A.

1 Introduction

This paper describes the approach taken by a
team of Universidade de Évora’s Computer Sci-
ence Department in SemEval-2014 Task 9: Senti-
ment Analysis in Twitter (Rosenthal et al., 2014).
SemEval-2014 Task 9 has an expression-level
(subtask A) and a message-level (subtask B) polar-
ity classification challenges. The first subtask aims
to determine whether a word (or phrase) is posi-
tive, negative or neutral, within the textual context
in which it appears. The second subtask concerns
the classification of the overall text polarity, which
corresponds to automatically detecting the senti-
ment expressed in a Twitter message. In both sub-
tasks, systems can operate in constrained or un-
constrained mode. Constrained means that learn-

ing is based only on provided training texts, with
the possible aid of static resources such as lexi-
cons. Extra tweets or additional annotated doc-
uments for training are permitted only in uncon-
strained mode.
The system we used to respond to this challenge
is called senti.ue, and follows on from our
previous work on Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Sentiment Analysis (SA). We devel-
oped work in automatic reputation assessment, us-
ing a Machine Learning (ML) based classifier for
comments with impact on a particular target entity
(Saias, 2013). We also participated in the previ-
ous edition of SemEval SA task, where we have
implemented the basis for the current system. In
last year’s solution (Saias and Fernandes, 2013),
we treated both subtasks using the same method
(except the training set). We have updated the
method for subtask A, now considering also the
text around the area to classify, by dedicating new
features to those preceding and following tweet
parts. Text overall sentiment classification is the
core objective of our system, and is performed, as
before, with a supervised machine learning tech-
nique. For subtask B, we fixed some implemen-
tation issues in the previous version, and we went
from 22 to 53 features, explained in Section 3.

2 Related Work

The popularity of social networks and microblog-
ging facilitated the sharing of opinions. To know
whether people are satisfied or not with a particu-
lar brand or product is of great interest to market-
ing companies. Much work has appeared in SA,
trying to capture valuable information in expres-
sions of contentment or discontentment.
Important international scientific events, NLP re-
lated, include SA challenges and workshops. This
was the case in SemEval-2013, whose task 2 (Wil-
son et al., 2013) required sentiment analysis of
Twitter and SMS text messages. Being the pre-

546



decessor task of the challenge for which this work
was developed, it is similar to this year’s Task 9.
The participating systems achieved better results
in contextual polarity subtask (A) than those ob-
tained for the overall message polarity subtask (B).
In that edition, the best results were obtained by
systems in constrained mode. The most common
method was supervised ML with features that can
be related to text words, syntactic function, dis-
course elements relation, internet slang and sym-
bols, or clues from sentiment lexicons. In that
task, the NRC-Canada system (Mohammad et
al., 2013) obtained the best performance, achiev-
ing an F1 of 88.9% in subtask A and 69% in sub-
task B. That system used one SVM classifier for
each subtask, together with text surface based fea-
tures, features associated with manually created
and automatically generated sentiment lexicons,
and n-gram features. Other systems with good re-
sults in that task were GU-MLT-LT (Günther and
Furrer, 2013) and AVAYA (Becker et al., 2013).
The first was implemented in the Python lan-
guage. It includes features for: text tokens af-
ter normalization, stems, word clusters, and two
values for the accumulated positive and accumu-
lated negative SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al.,
2010) scores, considering negation. Its machine
learning classifier is based on linear models with
stochastic gradient descent. The approach taken
in the AVAYA system centers on training high-
dimensional, linear classifiers with a combination
of lexical and syntactic features. This system uses
Bag-of-Words features, with negation represented
in word suffix, and including not only the raw
word forms but also combinations with lemmas
and PoS tags. Then, word polarity features are
added, using the MPQA lexicon (Wiebe et al.,
2005), as well as syntactic dependency and PoS
tag features. Other features consider emoticons,
capitalization, character repetition, and emphasis
characters, such as asterisks and dashes. The re-
sulting model was trained with the LIBLINEAR
(Fan et al., 2008) classification library.
Another NLP task very close to SA is polarity
classification on the reputation of an entity. Here,
instead the sentiment in the perspective of the
opinion holder, the goal is to detect the impact of
this particular opinion on some entity’s reputation.
The diue system (Saias, 2013) uses a supervised
ML approach for reputation polarity classification,
including Bag-of-Words and a limited set of fea-

tures based on sentiment lexicons and superficial
text analysis.

3 Method

This work follows on from our previous partici-
pation in SemEval-2013 SA task, where we have
devoted greater effort to subtask B. We start by ex-
plaining our current approach for this subtask, and
then we describe how such classifier is also used
in subtask A.

3.1 Message Polarity Classification

The senti.ue system maintains a supervised
machine learning approach to perform the over-
all sentiment classification. As before, Python and
the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK1) are used
for text processing and ML feature extraction.
The first step was to obtain the tweet content and
forming the instances of the training set. Dur-
ing the download phase, several tweets were not
found. In constrained mode, we got only 7352 in-
stances available for training.
Tweet preprocessing includes tokenization, which
is punctuation and white space based, negation de-
tection, and lemmatization, through NLTK class
WordNetLemmatizer. After that, the system
runs the ML component. Instead of the solu-
tion we used in 2013, with two differently con-
figured classifiers in a pipeline, we chose to use
a single classifier, which this year is based on
SciKit-Learn2, and to increase the number
of features that are extracted to represent each
instance. The classification algorithm was Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM), using SVC3 class,
with a linear kernel and 10−5 tolerance for stop-
ping criterion. SVC class implementation is based
on libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011), and uses
one-against-one approach for multi-class classifi-
cation. From each instance, the system extracts the
47 features in Figure 1. The first two features rep-
resent the index of the first polarized token. The
following represent the repeated occurrence of a
question mark, and the existence of a token with
negation (not, never). Then there are two fea-
tures that indicate whether there is negation before
positive or negative words. The following 8 fea-

tures indicate whether there are positive or nega-
tive terms, just after, or near, a question mark or
an exclamation mark. We build a table with words
or phrases marked as positive or negative in sub-
task A data. Using this resource, 4 features test the
presence and the count of word n-grams marked
as positive or negative. Then the TA.alike features
represent the same, but after lemmatization and
synonym verification. To find the synonyms of
a term, we used the WordNet (Princeton Univer-
sity, 2010) resource. The probability of each word
belonging to a class was calculated. There are 3
features avgProbWordOn, one per class, that rep-
resent the average of this probability for each in-
stance words. Next 3 features represent the same,
but focusing only on the last 5 words of each text.
Then we have 6 ProbLog2Prob features, repre-
senting the average of P × log2(P ), for all words,
or only the latest 5 words, for all classes. P is
the probability of the word belonging to one class.
One feature cumulates the token polarity values,
according to SentiWordNet. The final 12 features
are based on sentiment lexicons: AFINN (Nielsen,
2011), Bing Liu (Liu et al., 2005), MPQA, and
a custom polarity table with some manually en-
tered entries. For each resource, we count the in-
stance tokens with negative and positive polarity,
and create a feature direction, having the value 1
if countTokens.pos>countTokens.neg, -1 if count-
Tokens.pos<countTokens.neg, or 0.
For the unconstrained mode, the only difference
is the use of more instances for the training set,
with 3296 short texts obtained from SemEval-
2014 Task 4 data4, about laptops and restaurants.

3.2 Contextual Polarity Disambiguation

In this subtask, the download phase fetched only
6506 tweets. These instances have boundaries
marking the substring to classify. Our system
starts by splitting the document into text segments:
fullText, leftText, rightText, sentenceText, chosenText. The
first corresponds to the entire tweet. The follow-
ing represent the text before and the text after the
chosen text. Then we have the sentence where
the chosen text is, and finally the text segment
that systems must classify. The preprocessing de-
scribed before is then applied to each of these text
segments. For each instance, the system gener-
ates the 31 features listed in Figure 2. First 27
features represent 9 values for each chosenText , sen-

tenceText and leftText instance segments. These val-
ues represent the count of polarized tokens, and
the direction (1, 0, or -1, as before), according to
3 sentiment lexicons. The final 4 features have the
overall sentiment classification, using the subtask
B classifier, for each text segment: leftText , right-
Text , sentenceText , and chosenText . In unconstrained
mode the instances used for subtask A training are
the same. The difference with respect to the con-
strained mode is the overall sentiment classifier
used for the last 4 features, which corresponds to
the unconstrained classifier of subtask B.
This subtask has specific features, different from
those used in the previous subtask, and after some
tests with SciKit-Learn classifiers, we found
that, in this case, our best results were not ob-
tained with SVM. For subtask A, we chose Gradi-
ent Boosting classifier5, an ensemble method that
combines the predictions of several models, con-
figured with deviance loss function, 0.1 for learn-
ing rate, and 100 regression estimators with indi-
vidual maximum depth of 4.

4 Results

We submitted four runs, with the system output
for each subtask, and both constrained and uncon-
strained modes. Test set documents come from
five sources: LiveJournal blogs (LJ’14), SMS test
(SMS’13) and Twitter test (T’13) data from last
year, a new Twitter collection (T’14), and 100
tweets whose text includes sarcasm (T’14s). The
primary metric to evaluate the results is the aver-
age F-measure for positive and negative classes.
Table 1 shows the score obtained by our system.
In the constrained mode, and for the five data
sources, senti.ue achieved a score between
78,72 and 84,05 in subtask A, and a score between
55,31 and 71,39 in subtask B. Comparing the
evaluation between constrained and unconstrained
modes, the latter was always a little below, ex-
cept for one case in subtask A and SMS2013 data,
where the extra training data led to a 4% score im-
provement. In this SA challenge there were a total
of 27 submissions in subtask A and 50 submis-
sions in subtask B. Among these, the best score
and the average score for each subtask are shown
in Table 2. In both subtaks, our system result is
above the participating systems average score. In
subtask A and the Twitter Sarcasm 2014 collection
(T’14s), senti.ue achieved the highest score,
with 82,75% in constrained mode.
For each data set, tables 3 and 4 show the preci-
sion and recall of our system result on the high-
est scored mode, per class. In subtask A preci-
sion is between 64 and 99% for positive and nega-
tive classes, taking the value of zero in the neutral
class. For the overall sentiment subtask, precision
is similar among the 3 classes, having the mini-
mum value in the negative class of sarcasm tweets.

5 Conclusions

Continuing last year experience, we participated
in SemEval-2014 Task 9 to test our approach for a
real-time SA system for the English used nowa-
days in social media content. We changed the
method for subtask A, now considering also the
text around the area to classify, by dedicating new
features to it, which led to good results. Our
method for overall sentiment is ML based, using
a restricted set of features that are dedicated to
superficial text properties, negation presence, and
sentiment lexicons. Without a deep linguistic anal-
ysis, our system achieved a reasonable result in
subtask B. The evaluation of our solution, in both
subtasks, shows an appreciable improvement, by
10% or more, when compared to our results in
2013. We believe that the additional training in-
stances used in unconstrained mode and subtask
B, about laptops and restaurants, have a writing
style different from most of the test set documents.
And perhaps this is the cause for lower score in
the unconstrained mode, something that happened
also with many systems in the past edition (Wilson
et al., 2013).
This time, we implemented the contextual polarity
solution based on the subtask B classifier. Given
the results, we intend to do, in the near future, a

549



new iteration of our system where the overall clas-
sifier will depend on (or receive features from) the
current subtask A classifier.
It seems to us that senti.ue feature engineering
can be improved, maintaining this line of develop-
ment. Once stabilized, the introduction of named
entity recognition and a richer linguistic analysis
will help to identify the sentiment target entities,
as the ultimate goal for this system.
