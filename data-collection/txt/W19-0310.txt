Abstract

In this paper, we describe a data processing pipeline used for annotated spo-
ken corpora of Uralic languages created in the INEL (IndigenousNorthern Eurasian
Languages) project. With this processing pipeline we convert the data into a loss-
less standard format (ISO/TEI) for long-term preservation while simultaneously
enabling a powerful search in this version of the data. For each corpus, the input
we are working with is a set of files in EXMARaLDA XML format, which contain
transcriptions, multimedia alignment, morpheme segmentation and other kinds
of annotation. The first step of processing is the conversion of the data into a cer-
tain subset of TEI following the ISO standard ’Transcription of spoken language’
with the help of an XSL transformation. The primary purpose of this step is to
obtain a representation of our data in a standard format, which will ensure its
long-term accessibility. The second step is the conversion of the ISO/TEI files to
a JSON format used by the “Tsakorpus” search platform. This step allows us to
make the corpora available through a web-based search interface. As an addi-
tion, the existence of such a converter allows other spoken corpora with ISO/TEI
annotation to be made accessible online in the future.

1 Introduction
The primary target of our processing pipeline are the corpora that are or will be de-
veloped within the framework of the INEL project (Indigenous Northern Eurasian
Languages)1 (Arkhipov and Däbritz, 2018). The main goal of the project is to develop
annotated spoken corpora for a number of minority languages spoken in Northern
Eurasia, most of themUralic2. At themoment, corpora of Selkup (Uralic > Samoyedic),
Kamas (Uralic > Samoyedic; extinct) and Dolgan (Turkic) are under development.

The long-term project INEL, scheduled to run until 2033, bases its technical de-
velopment on the infrastructure, tools and workflows for curation and publication of
digital resources available at the Hamburg Centre for Language Corpora3, a research
data centre within the CLARIN4 infrastructure with a main thematic focus on spoken
and multilingual data. The available technical solutions were however not developed
for the specific data types created within the INEL project, in particular glossed and
richly annotated transcripts. While the HZSK Repository used for corpus publica-
tion allows for transcript visualization and download, until now there is no advanced
web-based search functionality. The INEL project thus needs to extend not only the
existing workflows, but also the distribution channels to provide their corpora to a
research community requiring easily accessible and highly complex search mecha-
nisms.

Creating corpora from language data that are intended for long-term usage and ac-
cessibility holds various challenges for the used data formats. For each of the different
phases the corpora undergo during their creation, different tools and therefore differ-
ent data formats are needed. Because of the long-term character and the emphasis on
accessibility of the INEL project, standard compliance and openness of the formats
as well as making implicit information explicit also need to be taken into account.
We will describe how we dealt with these challenges using a special data processing
pipeline and using the ISO/TEI Standard Transcription of spoken language5 (ISO/TC
37/SC 4, 2016) with only explicit information for short-term archiving, publishing,
and as the base format for a searching interface.

Through the use of a standard format, the pipeline described in this paper can also
be applied to similar (Uralic) corpora developed in other projects, e.g. the Nganasan
Spoken Language Corpus (Wagner-Nagy et al., 2018).

2 Corpus Data
All corpora in question consist of audio/video files and/or pdf scans of (hand-)written
data, accompanied by the transcription files. The annotation was carried out manu-
ally. It includes morpheme segmentation, glossing, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic
functions, code switching, and other linguistically relevant information. When avail-
able, sound or video are aligned with the transcription. The files also contain par-
allel translations into Russian, English and German. While the transcription data is
initially created with FLEx6 and/or ELAN7, the corpora within the INEL project are
created with the EXMARaLDA8 (Schmidt and Wörner, 2014) desktop software suite
comprising a transcription and annotation editor (Partitur-Editor), a corpus andmeta-
data manager (Coma) and a search and analysis tool (EXAKT). The transcriptions are
stored in the EXMARaLDA Basic Transcription XML format (EXB) and have time-
based references to the media files and multiple annotation tiers. Apart from the doc-
umentation on the creation of the corpus, detailed metadata regarding the raw data,
the transcriptions and the corresponding speakers is stored in an additional file in
the EXMARaLDA Coma XML format (COMA). All corpora in question have a similar
design and similar annotation levels, which makes it possible to create a single set of
converters capable of processing any of the existing corpora, as well as those that will
be created in the course of the project. The EXMARaLDA software suite was chosen
by the project because of the important advantages it offers for the corpus creation
process. The metadata and corpus manager Coma and the desktop search and anal-
ysis tool EXAKT can both be used to manage and continuously assess the growing
data set and also to search and analyze the corpus or any defined subcorpora. While
the EXMARaLDA software might facilitate corpus creation, the time-based EXMAR-
aLDA transcription data model is rather simple and not really suited for precise and
explicit modelling of the INEL transcription data. The glossing comprises annota-
tions which are clearly based on linguistic segments and such segment relations are
not a part of the time-based EXMARaLDA transcription data model. The Basic Tran-
scription format is not in any way tokenized and thus only allows for time-based
annotations, aligned to start and end points shared with a transcription tier on which
the annotation is based. In the INEL data, these start and end points coincide with
token boundaries, though this is not explicitly modelled by the time-based approach.
In Figure 1, you can see an example of a Selkup text annotated in the way described
above.

The transcription files are generated either from (hand-)written text artifacts or
from audio or video recordings. In case of transcriptions accompanied by audio or
video, the EXMARaLDA transcriptions are aligned with these files by linking to time
intervals in themedia files. Some of those texts are dialogues. Since they are produced
by multiple speakers, they contain several sets of tiers described above, one for each
speaker. Finally, each corpus has very detailed metadata, which covers sociolinguistic
background of the speakers and linguistic properties of the texts.

3 Conversion to ISO/TEI XML
While converters from the EXMARaLDA Basic Transcription format to the ISO/TEI
standard are included in the EXMARaLDA software for several transcription conven-
tions, these all assume that transcriptions were created with the time-based inter-
pretation of EXMARaLDA and thus only create time-based annotations. With the
ISO/TEI standard it is however possible to model segment based annotations, e.g.
when further enriching the transcription data using tools such as parsers or taggers.
For the INEL data, we decided to make the implicit information of the EXMARaLDA
transcriptions, i.e. the segments and relations relevant to the annotation, explicit
through corresponding modelling using ISO/TEI. The first objective was to convert
the corpora into a loss-less standard format while turning implicit information into
explicit information, which is especially important for long-term projects. Explicit
data also means to make searching in various tools and converting into different data
formats less error-prone. To achieve this we used the ISO standard “Transcription of
Spoken Language”9, which is based on the TEI guidelines10. To account for the spe-
cific requirements in the INEL project and similar structured projects (like Nganasan
Spoken Language Corpus) we needed to use a defined subset of TEI that is segment-
based and allows for segmentation into sentence, word and morpheme units while
following the ISO standard. EXMARaLDAXMLmodels transcription, description and
annotation tiers as time-based information, linking these segments to the timeline of
the linked media files. In the special case of the INEL corpora, there are also corpus
files created in the EXMARaLDA format that don’t reference any audio or video infor-
mation because they are generated from (hand-)written text artifacts. The timeline in
EXMARaLDA only needs to define events and not necessarily real time information,
so in the text-based files references to those segments are used.

While this time-based format is needed for the transcription tier or ”baseline”, the
annotations in INEL currently are exclusively segment-based, because they refer di-
rectly to the segments transcribed in the baseline tier and not the temporal events of

the linked audio/video files. While still leaving the possibility for time-based anno-
tations open in future work, we decided to convert the time-based annotations (that
we knew to be segment-based) into segment-based annotations during the conver-
sion into the standard ISO/TEI format, thus turning the implicit information we had
into explicit information. The alignment of annotation segments to transcription tier
segments can be deduced from a relation between the annotation and one transcrip-
tion tier and their relation to events in the timeline. In the ISO/TEI conversion the
annotations are linked directly to the segments of the baseline without additional
time information. Depending on the scope of the annotations, annotation segments
in the INEL TEI subset are linked to either sentence, word or morpheme units. Since
these base units are linked to speakers (in EXMARaLDA as well as in the new ISO/TEI
export), the annotation can be assigned to the respective speakers too.

The special subset of the ISO/TEI standard that we used contains automatically
segmented <seg> elements (sentences) that consist of <w> elements (words) and punc-
tuation elements <pc>. The annotations are structured into <span> elements. One
special annotation tier additionally contains the morpheme segmentation, modelled
by spans that have special ids. While there is an <m> element available in the ISO/TEI
standard, we couldn’t use it for our purposes, since <m> elements need to construct
the words, while we need words additionally in a different tier than morphemes
(which is needed for dealing with e.g. null morphemes of which we find many in
our data). The start and end points of the spans can refer to the <seg> elements
(sentences/utterances in the baseline), word elements or other spans (in our case: the
morpheme spans). An sample fragment of a Selkup file in ISO/TEI can be seen in the
Figure 2.

To account for the metadata, a metadata enriched search is planned in the future.
To realize it, the metadata from the Coma XML file concerning the transcriptions
and speakers will be exported in the ISO/TEI files during the conversion additionally,
using the <tei:teiHeader>.

4 Conversion from ISO/TEI to Tsakorpus
Our second objective was to give the linguists access to the corpora through a user-
friendly web-based interface. We use the “Tsakorpus” corpus platform for this. In this
platform, linguistic data is indexed in a document-based Elasticsearch database. The
main index contains sentences (or sentence-like sequences of tokens), each sentence
being a single document. Tsakorpus accepts files in a certain JSON-based format as
its input. Each file corresponds to one corpus text (i.e. one EXMARaLDA transcrip-
tion file in our case) and contains a list of sentences. A sentence contains a list of
tokens, which are also represented as JSON objects, and additional information such
as sentence-level metadata, audio/video alignment and parallel alignment.

In order to index our corpora in Tsakorpus, we wrote a Python script that trans-
forms ISO/TEI files to the JSON files required by the corpus platform. Since all in-
formation potentially relevant for the search is already explicit in the TEI files, the
conversion basically means simply recombining the existing data without recovering
the information stored implicitly (such as grammatical values expressed by null mor-
phemes). The TEI files have a tier-based structure. This means that for each property
(such as part of speech, morpheme segmentation etc.), its values are listed for every
word within an XML node representing that property, and nodes representing differ-
ent properties follow one another. In Tsakorpus JSON, properties of each token are all



120

stored together in the JSON object representing that token. An example featuring a
fragment of a source file and the resulting JSON tokens can be seen in 3 and 4. Several
tier names commonly used by linguistic annotation software (FLEX or Toolbox) are
translated into names reserved for certain annotation types in Tsakorpus. E.g. the
information from the ps tier, which represents part of speech, goes to the gr.pos
tier in the JSON. All unrecognized tier names, such as SyF in the example (syntactic
function) are left unchanged.

There are three processing steps that go beyond simple restructuring described
above.

First, information about the alignment with the media file should be included in
each sentence. In the ISO/TEI files, the alignment is indicated through time point la-
bels such as T3, which come directly from the EXMARaLDA files. In the beginning of
the ISO/TEI document, all these labels are listed with their time offset values in sec-
onds. The name of the media file (one per transcription) associated with the recording
is stored in the sourceDesc node of the ISO/TEI file.

The time point labels at sentence boundaries are replaced with the actual time
offsets in the JSON. Additionally, the source media file is split into overlapping pieces
of small length (60 seconds by default) using ffmpeg. Instead of being associated
with the entire media file, each sentence in the JSON file is associated with one of
these parts. The part for each sentence is chosen in such a way that the middle of
the sentence segment is as close as possible to the middle of the media segment. The
time offsets are changed accordingly. Such an approach allows the user to listen to
the segment they found together with some context, while at the same time avoiding
the need to download the entire media file, which could be quite large.

Second, there is a number of tiers with sentence-level alignment in the source files.
These are alternative transcriptions and translations into Russian, English and Ger-
man. To enable this sort of alignment in Tsakorpus, we are using a scheme intended
for parallel corpora. The aligned segments are stored in the JSON file as separate
sentences. Sentences originating in different tiers have different values of the lang
parameter. The sentences that should be aligned with one another receive the same
“parallel ID”, a value stored in each of them.

Finally, the translations are automatically lemmatized and morphologically ana-
lyzed using the analyzers available for Russian, English and German. As of now, we
have tested the analysis of the Russian tier with mystem (Segalovich, 2003). This may
seem a significant departure from the principle of having all relevant information ex-
plicitly present in the ISO/TEI files. However, we treat this added annotation as an
auxiliary information that is not part of the original annotated corpus and should not
be stored in it. Its only purpose is facilitating the search in the data that already exists
in the corpus. The queries that involve this annotation are not intended to be repli-
cable. Therefore, this annotation is not checked manually and can be superseded by
annotation produced by other morphological analyzers in the future.

After the JSON files are indexed, the corpus becomes available through a web in-
terface. Single-word queries may contain constraints on values in any annotation tier
or their combinations, possibly with regular expression or Boolean functions. Multi-
word queries can additionally include constraints on the distance between the words.
Each search hit is aligned with a multimedia segment, which can be played by clicking
on the sentence.

5 Conclusion
By developing the EXMARaLDA > ISO/TEI and ISO/TEI > Tsakorpus JSON convert-
ers we have achieved two goals. First, the corpora annotated within the framework
of INEL and similar projects can now be exported to a format suitable for long-term
preservation. The version of the ISO/TEI we are using is fit for that purpose because
it is based on an ISO standard and because all potentially relevant information is
made explicit in it. This means that the corpora in question could be reused in the
future without recourse to the software currently employed in the project or to im-
plicit knowledge of its participants. Second, this chain of converters makes it possible
to release the corpora to the public through a user-friendly web interface. This way
of publishing the corpora has an advantage over simply releasing the EXMARaLDA
files in that it does not require the users to install and become acquainted with any
special software.

The ISO/TEI > Tsakorpus JSON converter is open source, which means that any
corpus stored in a similar ISO/TEI form could be easily published online. Projects that
use ISO/TEI for storing annotated spoken corpora exist, e.g. in IRCOM infrastructure
(Liégeois et al., 2015), but are not numerous. The ISO/TEI format is aimed at creating
enhanced interoperability for spoken data through a standardized format. Apart from
the proof of concept work done by integrating transcription data from various tool
formats into an ISO/TEI corpus that can be searched in its entirety, support for various
other scenarios, such as linguistic web services and web-based annotation tools are
in development.

Importantly, the availability of our converter could encourage researchers work-
ing in language documentation projects to export their data to ISO/TEI, which would
be beneficial for their long-term availability.
