Abstract of the talk 

Beyond literal meaning, words have associations 

with sentiment, emotion, colour, and even music. 

Identifying such associations is of substantial ben-

efit for information visualization, data sonifica-

tion, and sentiment analysis, which in turn have 

applications in commerce, education, art, and 

health. I will present methods to generate high-

coverage resources that capture such associations. 

I will show how these resources can be used for 

analyzing emotions in text, detecting personality 

from essays, and generating music from novels. 

Finally, I will show how word-sentiment associa-

tion lexicons have helped create the top-ranking 

systems in recent SemEval competitions on the 

sentiment analysis of social media posts.
