Abstract

Speech acts are the actions that a speaker in-
tends when performing an utterance within
conversations. In this paper, we proposed
speech act classification for asynchronous
conversations on Twitter using multiple ma-
chine learning methods including SVM and
deep neural networks. We applied the pro-
posed methods on the ArSAS tweets dataset.
The obtained results show that superiority of
deep learning methods compared to SVMs,
where Bi-LSTM managed to achieve an accu-
racy of 87.5% and a macro-averaged F1 score
61.5%. We believe that our results are the first
to be reported on the task of speech-act recog-
nition for asynchronous conversations on Ara-
bic Twitter.

1 Introduction

Speech act in linguistics is defined as the ac-
tion that a speaker intends when performing an
utterance such as asking question, recommend-
ing something, greeting or thanking, expressing a
thought or making suggestion. Knowing speak-
ers intention within a conversation is considered
the one of the recent active research in Natural
Language Understanding (NLU); which is called
speech act recognition/classification. Speech act
classification has been utilized in different Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) applications, such
as summarization (Zhang et al., 2013; Bhatia
et al., 2014), rumors verification (Vosoughi, 2015;
Vosoughi and Roy, 2016a), hate speech or cyber-
bullying detection (Gambäck and Sikdar, 2017;
Saravanaraj et al., 2016), and in the educational
forum (Bayat et al., 2016).

Speech act classification task is usually treated
as a multi-class classification problem. Most of
researchers tend to use machine learning (ML)
paradigm for the task in order to analyze and uti-
lize the massive amount of data that found in on-
line conversations. They usually apply their ex-
periments to two type of conversations: 1) syn-
chronous conversations, where the conversation
is one-to-one, such as dialogues, chatting, meet-
ings and transcribed phone conversations; and 2)
asynchronous conversations, where the conversa-
tion is one-to-many such as emails, discussion fo-
rums and social media. Existing work on speech
act classification mostly focuses on English lan-
guage, with some focus on other languages such
as German, French and Korean. Moreover, these
studies have been conducted for both synchronous
and asynchronous conversations. Limited studies
have tackled this task for Arabic, and all focus-
ing on synchronous conversations. To the best of
our knowledge, there is no work so far for Arabic
speech act classification for asynchronous conver-
sations, such as that on social media. Twitter has
become a communication medium containing a
massive amount of data suitable for social and be-
havioural studies. Communication between users
in Twitter can be considered as asynchronous con-
versations, within which people post questions,
express feelings, recommend, request, report, or
claim; all of which can be considered speech acts.
Classifying the speech act of tweets can aid in un-
derstanding the intentions behind users posts, an-
alyzing Twitter content, and understanding how
users interact on social media (Vosoughi and Roy,
2016b).

Recently, an Arabic speech-act and sentiment
corpus (ArSAS) of tweets corpus was released (El-
madany et al., 2018). It contains more than 21K
tweets, annotated with six speech acts. In this pa-
per, this corpus is used to evaluate the effective-
ness of different supervised ML approaches for
speech act classification for Arabic tweets. In our
work, we proposed two approaches based on SVM
and multiple deep learning models to classify Ara-
bic tweets into speech act labels. Our results show
that Bi-LSTM models achieves the highest per-
formance overall and over each of the individual
speech-act classes, where it achieves an accuracy
of 87.5% and a macro-F1 of 0.615.

2 Problem Definition

Linguistically, speech act theory studies the ways
in which the words can be used to carry out ac-
tions rather than transmitting information. The
speech act can be defined as the actions that may
be performed by speakers to carry out their inten-
tions when performing utterances. According to
Searle (Searle, 1975), which is based on Austins
work (Austin, 1975), speech acts can be classified
by their intent of usage and he categorized it into
five categories: Assertive, Directive, Commissive,
Expressive, and Declaration.

The concept of a speech act in Arabic can be
defined in the same manner as in English. How-
ever, a speech act is more profound in the Arabic
rhetoric discipline, which is concerned with the
semantics of stylistic. Rhetoric in Arabic lies be-
tween syntax and semantics and aims to enable the
Arabic speaker to relay his or her intended com-
municative meaning to the listener through the ap-
plication of rhetorical means and eloquent crite-
ria. The speech act as part of Arabic rhetoric is
concerned with the ways of delivering some rele-
vant information with utterance in order to attract
the listeners attention (Abdul-Raof, 2006). In-
terestingly, researchers (Al-Hindawi et al., 2014)
have shown the existence of speech acts in Arabic
prior to the work of Austin and Searle on English
speech acts. They refer to the speech act that is
mentioned in the holy Quran and pointed out that
Arab scholars have seeded the Arabic Speech act
theory even before Austin theory. All the afore-
mentioned examples are written using classical
Arabic; however, our work targets the speech act
in Arabic dialects. For that, we use a domain-
specific taxonomy of six speech act categories

that are commonly seen on Twitter (Vosoughi and
Roy, 2016b), including assertion, recommenda-
tion, expression, question, request, and miscella-
neous. These categories are all derived from Sear-
les taxonomy but modified to make it suitable for
speech acts in Twitter.

3 Literature Review

Extensive research has been conducted on speech
acts classification in different languages using var-
ious techniques. The vast majority of literature
in this field uses either supervised ML techniques
with a variety of lexical, syntactic, contextual, and
semantics features, or adopts deep learning tech-
niques to automatically identify the speech act.

3.1 Trends in Speech Act Recognition

(Cohen et al., 2004) classified English email ac-
cording to the intent of the sender using SVM
classifiers with the use of bi-gram and Part-of-
Speech (POS) tags as features. (OShea et al.,
2010) proposed a novel technique based on func-
tion words (e.g. articles, prepositions, determiners
etc.) that appear in the utterances using decision
tree classifiers. Their results strongly demonstrate
the ability of function words to discriminate be-
tween speech act classes. Bhatia et al. (Bhatia
et al., 2014) used speech act classification to aid
in the summarization of online forum discussion
threads using Nave Bayes and they demonstrated
the effectiveness of speech act labels in summariz-
ing discussion threads. Additionally, (Tavafi et al.,
2013) aimed to determine a domain-independent
classifier that could achieve good results across
all types of conversations (synchronous and asyn-
chronous). They used different ML techniques
such as SVM, Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a set
of domain-independent features, including lexical
features and the length of utterances as another
feature. They demonstrated that HMM classi-
fiers achieved the best performance for speech act
classification on different synchronous and asyn-
chronous English conversations.

Similar techniques was applied for speech-act
recgonition for other languages. For example,
(Kim et al., 2011) used a Decision Tree (DT),
SVM and the Maximum Entropy Model (MEM)
with a set of lexical, grammatical and contextual
features for speech act classification tasks using a
Korean dialogue corpus in a schedule management



185

domain. They showed that SVM outperformed
other classifiers by achieving accuracy equal to
93%. Similarly, (Ko, 2015) used Korean corpus
to conduct an experiment using SVM and k-NN
classifiers with POS and lexical words as features.
Ko also pointed out the inadequacy of the tf.idf
feature weighting scheme for the task due to the
short length of utterances in comparison to the
documents length. He proposed a new weighting
scheme and showed the effectively of SVM with
the new weighting scheme in speech act classifi-
cation using Korean corpus. Additionally, Bayat
et al. (Bayat et al., 2016) used SVM and a set of
lexical, contextual, and syntactic features to clas-
sify German messages posted on an online forum.
They showed the effect of adding features to SVM
classifiers in order to increase the performance for
the task.

Recently, many researchers have recently ap-
plied deep learning techniques using word em-
beddings to capture speech act of the utterance in
synchronous conversations. This is because deep
learning techniques afford a significant advantage
in capturing the semantics of lexical features (Yoo
et al., 2017). The effectiveness of deep learning
techniques for speech act recognition is evident in
the work of (Cerisara et al., 2018), who proposed
a novel deep neural network model based on Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) and validated this model in three
different languages using synchronous conversa-
tion corpora. They demonstrated that the perfor-
mance of this approach is consistent across these
three languages (with an accuracy of 72%, 98%
and 92% for English, Czech and French, respec-
tively). Similarly, (Khanpour et al., 2016) used
LSTM to classify dialogue acts in open-domain
conversations. They reported that the word em-
bedding parameters, dropout regularization, decay
rate and number of layers have a significant im-
pact on the final systems accuracy. (Yoo et al.,
2017) applied a CNN to capture speech acts on
Korean dialogues corpus. Their model has ob-
tained a high accuracy (89%) in the speech act
recognition task. (Kim and Kim, 2018) proposed
an integrated neural network model based on CNN
for identifying speech acts, predictors, and sen-
timents of dialogue utterances. They concluded
that the integrated model can help in increasing
the performance of intention identification. (Lee
and Dernoncourt, 2016) applied both RNN and

CNN on three different synchronous conversations
datasets. They stated that the CNN model outper-
formed the LSTM model for all datasets by a very
small margin.

Recently, more attention was directed to speech
act classification for tweets as a kind of asyn-
chronous conversations. (Zhang et al., 2011) pro-
posed a set of word-based and character-based
features to recognise the speech acts of tweets
in order to analyze tweeters behavior collectively
or individually. They suggested word-based fea-
tures composed of a set of N-grams, abbreviations,
acronyms, vulgar and opinion words, emoticon,
and Twitter-specific features. SVM was used for
this task, and showed a weighted-average F1 value
of nearly 0.70. Another work by (Vosoughi and
Roy, 2016b) explored speech act recognition on
Twitter by training SVM, Naive Bayes, decision
tree and logistic regression classifiers with a set of
semantic and syntactic features. Their approach
in features engineering is similar to (Zhang et al.,
2011), though they added the dependency sub-
trees and POS tags to their syntactic features set.
They achieved a performance with a weighted-
average F1 score equal to 0.70, which is similar
to the results of (Zhang et al., 2011). Further-
more, they also applied their speech act classi-
fier to detect rumors on Twitter based on assertion
speech act detection in tweets (Vosoughi, 2015).
Another work by (Joty and Hoque, 2016) applied
deep learning techniques by proposing a model
that used LSTM and RNNs for speech acts mod-
eling showed the effectiveness on asynchronous
conversations, such as emails and forums.

3.2 Arabic Speech Act Recognition

Much less attention was directed to speech act
classification for Arabic. Only limited amount
of work exist in literature, but only for classify-
ing speech act in Arabic synchronous conversa-
tions. One of the earliest works in this area is
(Graja et al., 2013) who used CRF to perform a
semantic labelling task for spontaneous speech in
Tunisian dialects by using the TuDiCol corpus.
Another work, (Elmadany, 2016; Elmadany et al.,
2016) utilized the JANA corpus to solve the issue
of automatic dialogue act classification for Egyp-
tian Arabic dialect using SVM. Also, (Sherkawi
et al., 2018) applied different machine learning
techniques on a small Arabic corpus. Their cor-
pus is relatively small and written in MSA.



186

Recently, a new corpus of Arabic tweets (Ar-
SAS) annotated speech-act was released (El-
madany et al., 2018), which is the first to model
speech-act in asynchronous conversations for Ara-
bic. Nonetheless, no work has been published on
this data yet. In this paper, we utilise the Ar-
SAS dataset for speech-act classification of Ara-
bic tweets. We believe we are the first exploring
speech act classification for Arabic asynchronous
conversations.

4 Methodology

We propose two different approaches for classify-
ing Arabic tweets into pre-defined speech act cat-
egories: 1) SVM with a set of syntactic and se-
mantic features, and 2) Deep learning with word
embedding using different neural network archi-
tectures.

4.1 Support Vector Machine Model

SVM has demonstrated significant performance
in most of the related work for speech act clas-
sification (Cohen et al., 2004; Elmadany, 2016;
Hemphill and Roback, 2014; Kim et al., 2011;
Ravi and Kim, 2007; Zhang et al., 2013; Tavafi
et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011; Vosoughi, 2015;
Ko, 2015). In preliminary experimentation using
simple bag-of-words as features, we found SVM
to be superior to other basic ML methods includ-
ing Naive Bayes, k-NN, RF and DT. Thus, it was
chosen for further experiments with additional set
of features.

4.1.1 Features Selection
Based on literature, we extracted multiple set of
features from tweets to model speech act. We
grouped the features into three groups: lexical,
syntactic, and structural features.

Lexical features: This is simply the words n-
grams in the tweet text. We used uni-gram, bi-
gram and tri-gram phrases. These features were
extracted after applying preprocessing to the text,
including character normalisation to the different
forms of the Arabic letters {ø , Z , �è , @} and dia-
critics removal (Darwish and Magdy, 2014).

Syntactic features: These features represent
the syntactic style of the text of the tweet, and it
include four sets of features: punctuation marks,
Twitter special characters, Emojis, and Links.
Binary features representing specific punctuation
such as question and exclamation marks are set to

one when appear, since they can be indicative to
specific speech act classes such as expressions, re-
quests or question. In addition, the rest of punctu-
ation marks are combined and added as additional
binary features to indicate the appearance of any
other punctuation marks in the tweet. Twitter spe-
cial characters such as presence of hashtags (#)
and mentions (@) were also used as binary fea-
tures. Hashtags might be an indicative feature of
some speech act classes such as assertion, where
user might use hashtags to announce something.
In addition, emojis are usually used in tweets to
communicate specific feelings thus it was added
as an additional feature. Finally a binary feature
indicating the presence of links in the tweets was
also used.

Structural features: These set of features rep-
resent the structural form of the sentence, and it
includes: (1) The length of the tweet in charac-
ters and words, which was shown previously to be
a useful feature for speech act recognition (Zhang
et al., 2013; Tavafi et al., 2013; Elmadany, 2016).
(2) POS tags of the words in the tweets, which has
been shown to be an effective features in speech
act recognition for English (Zhang et al., 2013;
Vosoughi and Roy, 2016b). We used FARASA
POS tagger 1 for extracting the POS tags. We
modified the tagger to include hashtags, URLs
and emojis as tags within the sequence. Then,
we added uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram PoS se-
quences to the features vector for each tweet.

4.2 Deep Learning Approach

In this paper, we implemented different variants of
deep learning neural network in order to determine
the most effective type of neural network for the
task of Arabic speech act recognition. Two vari-
ants of deep learning approaches were considered
in this task using different architectures: RNN in
particular LSTM and BiLSTM; and CNN. In addi-
tion, several combinations of neural networks vari-
ants have been applied for this task such as CNN
on top of LSTM, CNN on top of BiLSTM, LSTM
on top of CNN, and BiLSTM on top of CNN.

A skip-gram word2vec embedding have been
used to represent the words in each tweet before
inputting them to any neural network. An Arabic
pretrained word embedding has been utilized for
this work called “AraVec” (Soliman et al., 2017).
AraVec is a skip-gram model trained on 70M Ara-

5 Experimental Setup

5.1 Dataset

We utilized the recently published tweets cor-
pus “Arabic Speech Act and Sentiment” (ArSAS)
for our experimentation (Elmadany et al., 2018).
ArSAS contains a large set of 21,081 Arabic
tweets in different Arabic dialects and annotated
by six speech act classes: Assertion, Recom-
mendation, Expression, Question, Request, and
Miscellaneous. The tweets in the corpus covers
20 topics including long-standing topics, events
and entities (celebrities or organization). Table 1
shows few examples of tweets in the corpus with
their corresponding speech act label.

The size of samples in each speech acts class
varies a lot in ArSAS corpus, ranging between 60
samples to 11.7K samples per class. The smallest
two classes are miscellaneous and recommenda-
tion classes that have only 60 and 109 tweets re-
spectively. Therefore, we decided to merge these
two classes into one and called it miscellaneous.
The final distribution of the five classes in the cor-
pus is: expression (11734), assertion (8233), ques-
tion (752), request (183), and miscellaneous (169).

5.2 Classifiers Implementation and Setup

For the SVM classifier, SVM LinearSVC imple-
mented in the SKlearn2 was utilised for our exper-
iments. We examined “One-vs-All” and “One-vs-
One” strategies for SVM, and noticed better per-
formance for the “One-vs-All” implementation,
and thus it was conducted for our experiments.

For the neural network classifiers, we used

our deep learning models, Table 2 describes the
hyper-parameters we used after multiple iterations
for reaching the optimal performance.

5.3 Evaluation

For measuring the performance of our approaches,
we split the data into five folds and applied 5-fold
cross validation for training and testing. Data are
split into folds over the class level, where we in-
sure that 20% of the samples of each class exists
in each fold. This was essential step to ensure the
presence of samples from the small classes in each
fold.

For evaluation, three scores are applied: accu-
racy, micro F-score, and macro F-score. Accu-
racy and micro-F1 should demonstrate the over-
all performance of the approaches, while macro-
F1 would indicate the average performance of the
approaches over each class individually.

6 Results

6.1 SVM Results

Table 3 reports the results obtained when apply-
ing SVM classifier for our task using different
sets of features on the ArSAS dataset with 5-
fold cross-validation. As shown, the performance
of different set of features is almost similar, and
the performance when applying all the set of fea-
tures achieves the best results of accuracy 86.5%,
micro-F1 of 0.862, and macro-F1 of 0.532. While
the overall performance is relatively high, the per-
formance for some of the classes is considerably
low. This could be explained as a reason to the
high imbalance of our classes, where some of the
classes (such as ‘miscellaneous’, ‘requests’, and
‘questions’) are tiny compared to the two ma-
jor classes ‘expression’ and ‘assertion’. Actually,
nearly 90% of the samples in the classes miscella-
neous and request were incorrectly classified.

These results are comparable to the state-of-
the-art in other languages such as English. Com-
paring our work to the work by (Vosoughi and
Roy, 2016b) and (Zhang et al., 2011) for speech
act classification for English tweets, they report in
term of micro F1 (0.69 and 0.70) respectively, and
they also explain this due to the high imbalance
of classes. Our achieved micro-F1 is even higher
0.86. This might indicate the suitability of using
the same techniques —used for English speech act
classification— for the Arabic task.

6.2 Deep Learning Results

Table 4 reports the results obtained when apply-
ing seven different architectures of RNN and CNN
for Arabic speech act classification on the ArSAS
dataset with 5-fold cross-validation. As shown,
the performance of most of the models is close
to those obtained by the SVM models in terms of
accuracy, but consistently higher when measured
using macro-F1. The BiLSTM and the BiLSTM
on top of CNN architectures achieved significantly
higher results in terms of macro-F1 compared to
all the other models, which indicates better per-
formance on the class level. The best performing
model was the BiLSTM model with an accuracy of
87.5%, micro-F1 of 0.86, and macro-F1 of 0.615.
This confirms the effectiveness of using the bidi-
rectional LSTM to capture the context in the tweet,
which the miscellaneous class actually need. Ad-
ditionally, BiLSTM succeeded in recognizing both
question and request classes better than any other
model.

Table 5 shows the performance on the best per-
forming model using BiLSTM on each of the
classes individually. As shown, the performance
over the two large classes ‘assertion’ and ‘expres-
sion’ is high (0.9 and 0.87 F1 respectively) com-
pared to the other classes. The ‘request’ class
achieved the lowest performance (0.2 F1). This
shows the challenge of recognising the speech act
in asynchronous conversations for some of the in-

While our performance is comparable to perfor-

mance in other languages, we believe there is still
large room for improving the performance. We
hope that our work would be considered as a base-
line for future work on speech act classification for
Arabic.

6.3 Discussion

We explored speech act classification in Twitter
using SVM classifier with sets of lexical, syntac-
tic, and structural features, and using several neu-
ral network architectures with pretrained word em-
bedding for word representation. The best SVM
model with all the extracted features has achieved
53.2% in the term of macro-averaged F1 using 5-
folds cross validation on the ArSAS dataset. After
applying deep learning for the task using variants
of neural network architectures, our experiments
showed that all the suggested architectures have
outperformed the best SVM model with the sets
of features. This highlights the superiority of deep
learning models especially for a highly inflected
language such as Arabic, and in particular Arabic
dialect as present in our tweets dataset. BiLSTM
has achieved 61.5% in the term of macro-averaged
F1, which is 8.3% higher than the best SVM model
as shown in Table 6. This confirms the fact that
deep learning usually performing better even with-
out any feature engineering.

Potentially, the performance of BiLSTM might
improve if these extracted features get fed as an
input to the network, especially the PoS tags. PoS
features might give some structural characteristics
to the neural network.

Moreover, the overall performance was highly
affected by the imbalance distribution for the
classes amongst the corpus. During our experi-
mentation, we examined some solutions for this is-
sue, such as data over sampling, but it did not lead
to improved performance. We believe it might be
useful if there are more new examples for the small
classes, which would potentially enhance the per-
formance of neural networks as well.

Furthermore, ArSAS corpus contains labels for
the type of the topic for each tweet such as long-
standing, entity, and event. We suggest consid-
ering this attribute in implementation by training
different classifier for each type of topics sepa-
rately. It might be better for the classifier to clas-
sify tweets in the same type than classifying tweets
from mixed types.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented two ML ap-
proaches for speech act classification in Twitter
platform using dialectical Arabic tweets. An SVM
classifier with different sets of lexical, syntactic,
and structural features was proposed. In addi-
tion, a set of different neural network architectures
was examined for the task. For both approaches,
we exploited the recent published Arabic corpus
called “ArSAS” which has more than 21K tweets
that annotated by six different speech acts, that we
decided to squash to only five classes after merg-
ing the smallest two classes into one. Our re-
sults showed that deep learning is a more effective
approach for speech act classification of Arabic
tweets compared to SVM. In particular, the BiL-
STM implementation achieved the highest perfor-
mance especially with the macro-F1 score that was
61.5% compared to only 53.2% for SVM. The best
achieved overall accuracy for BiLSTM and SVM
were comparable with values of 87.5% and 86.5%
respectively.

As a general observation, all the used tech-
niques have showed an acceptable performance,
especially when compared to the current state-
of-the-art for English speech act classification for
asynchronous conversations. Nevertheless, as we
discussed, there is the potential of multiple direc-
tions for improvements that could be explored in
future work.
