Abstract
The main goal of this paper is to describe to what extent the three main open

word classes in Pite Saami (nouns, verbs and adjectives) can be automatically
assigned to inflectional classes in language technology, specifically for a Finite
State Transducer. For each of these word classes, the relevant structural features
necessary for determining inflectional class membership are described. In this, a
clear difference between the behavior of nouns and verbs, on the one hand, and
that of adjectives, on the other hand, is ascertained. While morphophonology,
as seen in the paradigmatic behavior of all three word classes, is complex and
features a number of types of stem alternations, nouns and verbs are predictable,
while adjectives are not. With this in mind, a basic algorithm for extracting in-
flectional class assignment for nouns and verbs is presented for use in a LEXC
framework. In contrast to this, adjectives must be assigned to inflectional classes
manually. The main TWOLC rules used to trigger morphophonological alterna-
tions are also outlined. The Pite Saami lexicographic database that forms the back-
bone for the LEXC stem files is managed using FileMaker Pro database software,
and the workflow used to extract and update LEXC files from that database is de-
scribed, focussing on the differences between nouns and verbs, and adjectives. In
this, light is shed on how, on the one hand, nominal and verbal inflectional patters
are highly complex yet reliably systematic, while adjective morphophonology is
complex and unpredictable.

jund on LEXC formaadis. Adjektiivide fleksiooniklass tuleb aga määrata käsitsi.
Tuuakse välja ka peamised TWOLC reeglid, mida kasutatakse morfofonoloogilise
vahelduse tekitamiseks. LEXC tüvefailide põhialuseks on pite saami keele leksi-
kograafiline andmebaas, mida hallatakse FileMaker tarkvaraga; artiklis kirjelda-

voogu, keskendudes erinevustele nimisõnade ja verbide, ning adjektiivide vahel.
Näidatakse, et substantiivide ja verbide fleksioonimustrid on küll komplekssed,
kuid väga süstemaatilised, samas kui adjektiivide morfofonoloogia on keeruline
ning raskesti ennustatav.

1 Introduction
Pite Saami is a critically endangered Saami language spoken in Swedish Lapland,
mainly in and around the municipality of Arjeplog.¹ No pedagogical materials have
been published for Pite Saami, although a few speakers have put together some basic
teaching resources for their own use. No digital resources exist from before the turn of
the millennium, and, until recently, no standard orthography existed either. However,
starting in 2008, a local lexicographic project and language documentation project cre-
ated a foundation for digital language technology resources for Pite Saami, as outlined
below. Specifically, a group of Pite Saami language activists carried out a wordlist
project titled Insamling av pitesamiska ord ‘Collection of Pite Saami words’ (Bengtsson
et al. 2008-2012), which ultimately resulted in the publication of the first Pite Saami
dictionary (Bengtsson et al. 2016) and orthographic standard (Wilbur, 2016b), together
in a single volume (Wilbur, 2016a). As a further result of this collaboration, additional
digital linguistic resources are now available for Pite Saami. A searchable version of
the ever-growingwordlist is available on-line at http://saami.uni-freiburg.de/psdp/pite-
lex/. Language technology tools are under development for Pite Saami in cooperation
with Giellatekno at the University of Tromsø; specifically, these consist of a Finite
State Transducer (FST) and a Constraint Grammar.

In mid-2016, the project Syntactic patterns in Pite Saami: A corpus-based explo-
ration of 130 years of variation and change² began compiling a thorough corpus of
both spoken and written Pite Saami texts, the oldest of which were published in the
late 19th century in Halász (1893). Using the combination of the electronic lexicog-
raphy resources and language technology tools mentioned above, corpus creation for
this syntax project is completed as automatically as possible. This idea is presented
in detail in Gerstenberger et al. (2017), but a brief overview is provided here. The
corpus consists of Pite Saami texts (in both spoken and written mode) transcribed in
current orthographic standard and collected in the ELAN format³ and following the
common structure stipulated by projects carried out by the Freiburg Research Group
in Saami Studies.⁴ A python script runs each token through the FST processor, and
then automatically creates annotations for lemma, morphological categories and part
of speech based on this. Simultaneously, an implementation of constraint grammar is
used in order to reduce the number of and, ideally, completely rule out, ambiguities

that occur during FST processing; however, as this project is still at an early stage in
describing syntactic structures in Pite Saami, the constraint grammar implementation
for Pite Saami is also only in an initial stage.

The LEXC files that provide the lexical input to FST are a sort of lexicon them-
selves, since they present a collection of stems assigned to inflectional classes (based
on their morphophonological behavior), as well as a TWOLC file providing ortho-
graphic (phonological) rules for generating and analyzing wordforms. However, the
information contained in the LEXC files for stems is mainly limited to the base form,
the underlying representation and an inflectional class assignment; on the other hand,
the current Pite Saami lexical database contains significantly more information for
each entry, including e.g. translations, gradation patterns and stem extension pat-
terns, just to name a few categories. Because this extensive database exists and is
continually being corrected and supplemented, it is clearly preferable to extract the
relevant LEXC stem files from it, rather than adding these by hand on an individual
basis. The Pite Saami lexical database is managed using the database software File-
Maker Pro.⁵ While FileMaker Pro is hardly ideal from the point of view of likely all
computational linguists,⁶ FileMaker Pro databases can be highly complex, and this is
currently the structure the Pite Saami data is in. Although a better, open-source so-
lution is desired in the medium-term, for the time being, this is the tool used in the
project.

2 Pite Saami morphophonology and FST
While Pite Saami language structures may be represented in the corpus using various
transcriptionmethods, every text in the corpus is at least transcribed using the current
standard orthography (as presented in Wilbur (2016b)).⁷ Entries in the lexicographic
database also use this standard. For this reason, this is also the transcription standard
which provides the character strings used for processing with FST.

As is true for all the Saami languages, paradigmatic stem alternations can be used
to define inflectional classes, and these are prevalent throughout the language’s in-
flected words.⁸ In addition to outlining the LEXC rules for the main open word classes
of nouns, verbs and adjectives, the main TWOLC rules intended for dealing with
the Pite Saami stem alternations in both consonants and vowels (including effects
of vowel harmony) will be presented briefly.

Aside from being stored and run locally, the resources presented in the following
sections are hosted by Giellatekno⁹ at the University of Tromsø. The source doc-
uments (LEXC and TWOLC, among others) can be accessed at https://gtsvn.uit.no/
langtech/trunk/langs/sje/. Language technology tools for analyzing and generating
Pite Saami wordforms can be found online at http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/index.sje.

⁶Cf. Wilbur (2017) for both a description and a critique of FileMaker Pro as a lexical database.
⁷Note that there is no officially recognized orthography for Pite Saami. By the fall of 2017, both the

Norwegian and Swedish Saami parliaments indicated they intend to officially recognize a Pite Saami or-
thography in the near future. It remains to be seen to what extent any official Pite Saami orthography
will adhere to the orthography presented in Wilbur (2016b) (and the accompanying website at saami.uni-
freiburg.de/psdp/stavningsregler/).

⁸An initial approach like this is presented for nouns, verbs and adjectives in the relevant chapters in
Wilbur (2014), but the present analysis goes beyond this, and is informed by continuing research that has
taken place since that publication.

2.1 LEXC inflectional classes for nouns

Noun lemmata are named using the nominative singular wordform, and thus entered
in the database using this form. Example nouns and the information required to calcu-
late the inflectional class for each class are presented in table 1, and an entire nominal
inflectional paradigm for juällge ‘leg/foot’ is provided in table 2. The naming sys-
tem for inflectional classes for nouns is based roughly on Saami linguistic tradition,
and uses the terms even and odd (referring to the syllable count of the nominative
plural form¹⁰) and contr (for ‘contracted’ stems). Subdividing nouns into inflectional
classes is done based on the syllable count of the base form (under ‘Syll.’ in table 2),
and the behavior of a stem final consonant, if there is one at all (under ‘stem-final-
C’). For lemmata with a stem final consonant, noun classes are further determined by
whether the stem final consonant occurs in the nominal singular form and/or in the
other paradigm slots. These features are sufficient to unambiguously assign any given
noun lemma to the correct general inflectional class, and this is done using pattern
recognition in the FileMaker Pro database (see § 3). In fact, further subclasses aris-
ing due to morphophonemic alternations (such as consonant gradation and umlaut)
and variation within Pite Saami also exist, but this somewhat simplified version fully
illustrates the main functionality of the algorithm.

Some recent loan words with three or more syllables and with principle stress
on the penultimate syllable (such as antänna ‘antenna’ or universitähtta ‘university’)
initially may appear to deviate from this system. However, by simply treating the

penultimate and final syllables as the stem, these behave in the same fully predictable
manner as native lemmata.

2.2 LEXC inflectional classes for verbs

Verb lemmata are named using the infinitive wordform, and thus entered in the data-
base using this form. Example verbs and the information required to calculate the
inflectional class for each class are presented in table 3, and an entire verbal inflec-
tional paradigm for buälldet ‘ignite’ is provided in table 4. As with the noun classes,
the naming system for inflectional classes for verbs is based roughly on Saami lin-
guistic tradition, and uses the terms even and odd (referring to the syllable count of
the infinitive form) and contr (for ‘contracted’ stems). Subdividing verbs into inflec-
tional classes is done based on the syllable count of the infinitive form (under ‘Syll.’ in
table 3), and whether a stem extension is present in finite forms.¹¹ These features are
sufficient to unambiguously assign any given verb lemma to the correct general inflec-
tional class, and this is done using pattern recognition in the FileMaker Pro database
(see § 3).

Some recent loan words with three or more syllables and with principle stress
on the penultimate syllable (such as adopterit ‘adopt’) initially may appear to deviate
from this system. However, by simply treating the penultimate and final syllables
as the stem, these behave in the same fully predictable manner as native lemmata.
With this in mind, the only actual exceptions to the above classes are the copula verb
(årrot in the infinitive, but with most inflectional forms based on an l- stem) and the
negation verb (which lacks non-finite forms). As a result, the latter two verb lemmata
are each in an inflectional class of their own.

¹¹Lemmata in the V_EVEN class are further subdivided based on the vowel of the second syllable, but
these supplementary details are not shown here for reasons of simplicity.

features that distinguish them, including the representative examples.

2.3 LEXC inflectional classes for adjectives

The descriptions for noun and verb inflectional classes in the previous two sections
show that assignment to inflectional classes in those cases are quite straightforward.
While the morphophonology is rather complex, especially for nouns, the system is
very consistent, and thus predictable. Indeed, the total number of classes is reasonable
and clearly limited.

On the other hand, the morphophonological behavior of Pite Saami adjectives
is quite the opposite, despite the fact that the basic adjective inflectional paradigm
implemented in the current Pite Saami FST only consists of three slots: attributive,
predicative singular and predicative plural (as opposed to 17 slots for nouns and at
least 21 for verbs).¹² As is the case with assigning inflectional classes to nouns and
verbs, themorphophonemic behavior (as reflected in the orthographic representation)
of a given adjective lemma throughout a paradigm is extracted; this includes stem
alternations in the initial vowel slot and the consonant center (stem gradation), stem
extensions, as well as the form of any discernible suffixes present. The possible values
of the relevant morphophonological criteria are presented in table 5.

Table 6 provides a few examples of differing adjective paradigms in order to pro-
vide an impression for the variation in patterning. Wilbur (2014) sets forth nine adjec-

¹²Whether comparative and superlative forms are types of morphological derivation or inflection, and
whether case-marked adjective forms which occur in elliptical constructions should be included in the core
adjectival paradigm, are theoretical discussions well beyond the scope of the current paper.

tive inflectional classes,¹³ but the current analyses is well beyond that, and currently
has 28 inflectional classes, with new classes added on a fairly regular basis as new
adjectives are added to the database.¹⁴

To provide still another impression of how inconsistent adjectives are, the follow-
ing figures are provided anecdotally. At the time of writing, 99 adjective paradigms
have been deduced as part of ongoing analyses of the Pite Saami lexical database,¹⁵
and, based on this set, 28 different inflectional classes have been found.¹⁶ This number
is likely to increase since more adjective entries in the database have yet to be scruti-
nized, but even if it does not, the ratio of adjective inflectional classes to lemmata is
significantly higher than for nouns or verbs.

While historically, a -s-suffix may be posited as a marker for attributive forms
(Rießler, 2016, 215-228), this is clearly not a productive rule in Pite Saami.¹⁷ Not only
are there plenty of instances for attributive forms without such a suffix, but there are
examples for predicative forms with such a suffix. Any attempts to link stemmutation
patterns such as umlaut or consonant gradation to marking attributive forms is also
fruitless, since there are numerous counter examples.

In addition, variation in adjective wordforms is also more common and seemingly
random compared to noun and verb lemmata, and this makes it even more difficult
to assign adjectives to a specific inflectional class, as they often can belong to more
than one class. For instance, guhkke ‘long’ is the predicative form, while two different
attributive forms are found, in seemingly free variation: guhka and guhkes. Currently,
not enough is known about which adjectives are subject to such variation, so it is too
early to decide whether such lemmata should be considered belonging to a single
inflectional class with variation in its forms, or to two different lemmata, each in its
own inflectional class. For the time being, the latter analysis is preferred.

Ultimately, due to the lack of correlation between the ‘basic’ form of any given ad-
jective lemma (whether this is considered the predicative singular form, as is typically
the case in Saami lexicography, or the attributive form) and the inflectional class it
belongs to, each adjective lemma has to be assigned to an inflectional class manually.
Or, at a very minimum, the attributive form and the predicative form must be paired
manually, and the inflectional class extracted from these forms. This is a significant

¹³Wilbur (2014) uses the phrase “correspondence patterns” (131) in a seeming attempt to avoid the term
inflectional class for adjectives altogether. Indeed, he claims that “there is no clear or consistent mor-
phological relationship synchronically between attributive adjectives and the corresponding predicative
adjectives” (134).

¹⁴Note that this seeming lack of any consistency and higher frequency in variation for adjectives com-
pared to other open word classes is nothing specific to Pite Saami, but true for other Saami languages as
well; cf. e.g., the 25 inflectional classes posited for North Saami attributive adjective forms alone in Sammal-
lahti (1998, 71-73), the 12 inflectional classes posited for North Saami attributive adjective forms in Svonni
(2009, 75-76) (who also points out that “[D]en attributiva formen … bildas (delvis) oregelmässigt” (74)), or
the claim by Rießler (2016, 201) that “the system of attributive and predicative marking is highly irregular
in the Saamic languages”.

¹⁵This dataset formed the basis for the Pite Saami dictionary published as Bengtsson et al. (2016),
but is continually being revised, improved and expanded. It can be accessed at http://saami.uni-
freiburg.de/psdp/pite-lex/.

¹⁶Just as a comparison, the database contains 2437 noun lemmata in five inflectional classes, and 1642
verb lemmata in three inflectional classes.

¹⁷It is common in Saami linguistics to posit the predicative singular form as the base form; however, I
choose not to follow this tradition because of a complete lack of any consistent evidence in the synchronic
system to indicate that the attributive form can be predicted based on the predicative form. Indeed, both
predicative and attributive forms should be included as lexical entries in any lexicographic data collection,
as Svonni (2009, 74) points out for North Saami: “Den attributiva formen böjs alltså inte och bildas (delvis)
oregelmässigt och brukar därför anges i ordböcker”.

difference to the noun and verb lemmata described above, which can be reliably as-
signed to the correct inflectional class based on the basic form and a few supplemental
pieces of information, as indicated in table 1 and table 3 above. Currently, FST inflec-
tional categories for Pite Saami adjectives are named after the predicative singular
form of one of the adjectives in each class, unlike the more generic names used for
noun and verb classes.

2.4 Morphophonological processes in TWOLC

As evidenced by the inflectional classes for nouns, verbs and adjectives described
above, Pite Saami features complex morphophonology (as is typical for all Saami
languages). In addition to marking certain morphological categories using suffixes,
almost every wordform also features non-concatenative morphology in the form of
stem alternations, both in the word-initial vowel slot and in the “consonant center”
(the consonant slot between the first and second vowels of a Pite Saami foot¹⁸). These
two main morphophonological processes occur together, but operate on the initial
vowel and the consonant center independently, and are referred to here as umlaut and
consonant gradation; these are described here briefly. Umlaut is seen in the paradig-
matic alternation of two vowel sets. In the one set, ua (and its allophone uä) alternate
with uo, and in the other, ä alternates with ie, with the former set of each pair lim-
ited to wordforms in grade III. Consonant gradation is a similar alternation in princi-
ple, but concerns paradigmatic alternations in the segments in the consonant center.
Here, a number of patterns are evident, all of which alternate at least in quantity, and
sometimes in quality as well. For instance, a geminate can alternate with a singleton
(rr~r), a preaspirated segment can alternate with its unaspirated equivalent (hp~b),
or a tripartite consonant cluster can alternate with a bipartite cluster, thereby losing
its middle member (jbm~jm).¹⁹ For more details on Pite Saami morphophonology, see
Wilbur (2014, 74-79).²⁰

In addition, there is one phonological feature significant enough to mention here,
partly because it is reflected in orthographic forms: regressive phonological assimi-
lation. It is referred to as vowel harmony, and only applies within a prosodic foot. In
this, a closed back vowel (i or u) in the second vowel slot triggers raising of the initial
vowel. The choice of the resulting vowel depends on the base vowel affected by the
harmony; the possibilities are presented in figure 1.

To analyze and generate these morphophonological alternations and the phono-
logical rule as represented by orthographic character strings in FST, a Two-Level

¹⁸Cf. Wilbur (2014, 25-30) for a description of word-level prosodic structures in Pite Saami.
¹⁹In the actual phonetic realization of this third type, the second member is always pronounced as an

unreleased plosive homorganic with the third consonant in the cluster, e.g. [jp̚m] for <jbm>.
²⁰Note however that the description of vowel harmony on pages 79–81 in Wilbur (2014) is correct in its

essence, but does not accurately reflect the status of this phenomenon as being truly phonological.

Table 7: Pite Saami TWOLC morphophonological triggers and their functions.

Compiler (TWOLC) is used (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). Triggers are defined which
cause these alternations, and are assigned to morphological slots in the definition files
of the various inflectional classes (the LEXC affix files). For instance, weak grade is
represented in the input by the tag ˆWG, and since specific choices for an umlaut vowel
or a consonant set align with weak grade, this tag is introduced in the relevant slots
in the inflectional class definitions. For example, for the nominal inflectional class
N_EVEN, this means that nom.pl, gen, acc, ill.pl, iness, elat, com and abess slots
include the tag ˆWG. A list of the triggers and their functions is found in table 7. A
more thorough example is provided below in § 2.5.

In summary, the Pite Saami TWOLC file contains 13 rules for implementing the
various consonant gradation patters, 5 rules for umlaut, and one for vowel harmony.
In addition, there are supplementary rules for deleting a final consonant, selecting the
voiceless variant of a final plosive, and triggering slot-specific vowel alternations in
the second vowel slot.

2.5 Implementation example

In this section, a selection of TWOLC and LEXC code examples are provided to illus-
trate how morphophonology is implemented in the Pite Saami FST. Specifically, the
generation of an accusative plural form jävrijd for the noun lemma jávvre ‘lake’ is
presented.

To begin with, the code presented in figure 2 is the entry in the LEXC noun stem
file. This provides the upper and lower forms for the lemma,²¹ the assignment to the
nominal inflectional class N_EVEN, and an English translation (just as a reference).

jávvre:jávvre N_EVEN "lake" ;

Figure 2: Code snippet for an example noun stem entry in the LEXC lexicon

From here, the LEXC nominal affix file adds inflectional tags and suffixes to the
upper and lower forms, respectively, as shown in the code presented in figure 3. Here,
the continuation classes mark the form to be generated as being a noun (+N) in plural
accusative (+Pl+Acc) with a suffix -jd (added in two steps). Furthermore, it is mor-
phophonologically characterized by weak grade using the tag ˆWG, and as subject to a
raising of the second vowel slot’s vowel using the tag ˆIJ.

²¹In this example, the entry is redundant because both the upper and lower sides are identical. However,
since many Pite Saami lemmata do not have identical upper and lower representations (cf. e.g. the examples
in 1, 2 and 3 below), all entries contain both sides explicitly, even when redundant.

matched pairs of characters for which the first character is doubled,²² the second in-
stance of the doubled character is deleted when preceded by a vowel as well as fol-
lowed by a vowel, an optional consonant, and, crucially, a ˆWG tag. In the example,
the antepenultimate set is present: v and r in the lemma jávvre, so the second r is
deleted, resulting in a consonant center rv.

The treatment of vowel characters requires two steps in this example. Initially,
the vowel in the second vowel slot is altered from e to i²³ by the rule named “V2 E to
I before j-suffixes” and presented in figure 5. This occurs when preceded by at least

"V2 E to I before j-suffixes"
e:i <=> Vow:+ Cns:+ _ %^IJ:0 ;

featuring a -j-segment

one consonant and at least one vowel character, and, crucially, when followed by a
ˆIJ tag. As a result, the e in the example jávvre becomes i.

The resulting i in the second vowel slot then provides the input for the general
vowel harmony rule, which is called “Default VH” and is presented in figure 6. For this
rule to take effect, a vowel character from a subset represented by the tag VHtrig and
defined in the TWOLC file to consist of [e:i | i | o:u | u ] in a word’s second
vowel slot must be present.²⁴ This then triggers an alternation in the initial vowel

²²Note that the set of character pairs in this rule is in fact much longer, but for reasons of space, it has
been shortened significantly in figure 4.

²³Phonologically speaking, the vowel is raised.
²⁴In the rule in figure 6, the tags # and .#. require a word or compound boundary at the left edge, thus

restricting the affected slot to the initial vowel position.

slot as set forth in the set of matched characters in this rule. In this example, á then
becomes ä.

In summary, the LEXC stem and affix files together with the TWOLC rules can
be implemented in FST to correctly generate and anaylze the form jävrijd as being
a noun in accusative plural for the input lemma string jávvre. Partly with the help
of LEXC tags, the consonant rule outputs rv from an initial rrv, and the two vowel
rules alter the vowels in the first and second vowel slot from initially á and e to ä and
i, respectively, in the inflected form jävrijd.

3 Determining inflectional classes with FileMaker Pro
The Pite Saami lexical database, which is the source of the LEXC files, is currently a
FileMaker Pro database. While this GUI-based software is far from the ideal choice
for programmers or coders, in it essence, it successfully allows one to keep complex
relational data sets.²⁵ The program has its own powerful but cumbersome GUI-based
scripting methodology, and this is used to extrapolate inflectional class assignments
for nouns, verbs and adjectives. The ability to export the database into XML format
makes it possible to then use XSLT to transform the data into the desired plain-text
output structure, which, in this case, is a LEXC stem file.²⁶

3.1 Automatic inflectional classes for nouns and verbs

While stem alternations in word forms within inflectional classes for nouns and verbs
are complex, they are also surprisingly systematic, as indicated in § 2.1 and § 2.2 above.
In almost every case, membership in a specific inflectional class can be derived exclu-
sively from the shape of the citation form. As a result, it is possible to set up algorithms
which automatically assign lemmata to the correct inflectional class.

Here, the basic process is explained. While the lexical database contains more
than just citation forms,²⁷ only entries corresponding to the citation form of a lemma
(in other words, nominative singular for nouns and infinitive for verbs) are subject to
evaluation to begin with. In an initial script, nouns and verbs are identified based on
the value in the part-of-speech field. The syllable count of each entry is determined
automatically with a script that counts vowel grapheme and grapheme combinations.

²⁵Cf. Wilbur (2017, 305-307) for a discussion of advantages and, crucially, disadvantages to using File-
Maker Pro as a lexical database, or indeed for any data set.

²⁶Note that, while an XLT stylesheet can be applied automatically during export from FileMaker Pro, it
is only possible using the outdated version 1.0 of XSLT.

²⁷Because the source of the majority of the entries in the database is a group of native speakers without
any training in linguistics or lexicography, a not insignificant number of entries consist of inflected forms
or sometimes entire phrases.



167

Then, lemmata are further divided into groups based on the syllable count (groups of
bisyllabic and trisyllabic lemmata).

Then, for nouns, the existence of a stem-final consonant is determined, andwhether
this is present in the nominative singular form (the entry itself) and/or in oblique case-
number paradigm slots. This is sufficient to allot the main nominal inflectional classes
(as portrayed in table 1), but sub-classes for inflectional patterns reflecting more spe-
cific morphophonological alternations (such as stem final -e- alternating with stem
final -á-) are assigned based on unicode string values of stem-final segments.

For verbs the process is even more straightforward. Trisyllabic verbs are assigned
to class V_ODD, bisyllabic verbs with a stem extension are in class V_CONTR and all
others are in V_EVEN, as illustrated in table 3. Membership in the further sub-classes
can be determined unambiguously based on the vowel immediately preceding the -t
infinitive suffix.

Compounds are marked by hand in the database, and the resulting inflectional
classes are determined based only on the final compound element. A compound
boundary is inserted which prevents phonological rules (TWOLC) from applying be-
fore it.

With the above process in mind, a noun or verb lexical entry can clearly be as-
signed to the correct inflectional class. Then, a few other smaller FileMaker Pro scrips
extract the appropriate form for the LEXC database files in preparation for exporting.
Thus a noun entry such as biena ‘dog’, which has a bisyllabic stem and lacks a stem-
final consonant, is correctly identified as belonging to N_ODD.The right and left sides of
the LEXC entry are thus calculated in FileMaker Pro as biena and biednag. Similarly,
the verb gullit ‘fish’, which has a bisyllabic stem in the infinitive but a -j-extention
for the stem in a number of paradigm slots, is assigned to the V_CONTR class. These
data and the English translation are then exported from FileMaker Pro into XML. In
the export process, an XSLT style sheet is applied so that the lines in (1) and (2) are
included in the appropriate LEXC stem files:

(1) biena:biednag N_ODD "dog" ;

(2) gullit:gul'li V_CONTR "fish" ;

3.2 Semi-automatic inflectional classes for adjectives

As described in detail in § 2.3, the morphophonology of Pite Saami adjectives is, on
a lexeme-by-lexeme basis, equally complex with that of nouns and verbs, but the as-
signment of adjectives to inflectional classes is significantly less transparent. This is
due not only to common variation among speakers, but also to the vast number of
classes, despite the fact that adjective paradigms only have three slots in their most
basic form. Partly because of this variation and mainly due the lack of any consistent
correspondence of morphophonological behavior across paradigms, it is not possible
to automatically assign inflectional classes to adjective lemmata based on the form of
the lexeme itself.²⁸

Note that it is possible to separate adjectives into a (seemingly) limited set of in-
flectional classes (currently 28), but, crucially, membership in a specific class cannot

²⁸As mentioned above, the question as to whether the attributive form or the predicative form should be
considered representative for a given adjective lemma is in fact impossible to answer in a satisfactory way
(at least synchronically) due to the lack of any consistent correspondence between the two forms; this will
therefore not be further addressed here.



168

be derived from the representative lemma form, syllable count and another data cat-
egory. While the citation form of nouns and verbs is sufficient for inflectional class
assignment in those cases, both the predicative singular and the attributive forms of
a given adjective have their own entry in the Pite Saami lexical database (although
in cases where these forms are the same, there is only one entry, and this is marked
as being valid for both paradigmatic slots). Once the assignment to a specific class is
set, then other wordforms (such as the predicative plural) can be derived (in a com-
putational sense, not morphologically) using the LEXC adjective affix file. For purely
practical purposes, the predicative singular form is used as the base for calculating
the entry in the LEXC adjective stem file.

To deal with the lack of derivable assignability, the current solution in the File-
Maker Pro lexical database consists of two steps. First, inflectional classes are defined
in a related database table. Second, attributive and predicative singular forms are as-
signed to the correct inflectional class on an individual basis. Once inflectional classes
are assigned, then the LEXC stem file can be updated automatically by exporting to
XML and applying an XSLT style sheet, just as for noun and verb lemmata. Due to
the unpredictable nature of adjectives, processing them requires more manual work.
But ultimately, an adjective entry such as årås ‘new’, which has an attributive form
årrå (strong grade, without a stem-final consonant), a predicative singular form årås
(weak grade, with a stem-final consonant) and a predicative plural form årråsa (strong
grade, with a stem-final consonant and plural-marking -a suffix), is classified as be-
longing to A_GALMAS, even though this is done manually. The right and left sides of
the LEXC entry are thus calculated in FileMaker Pro as galmas and galbma, and the
result is a line in the LEXC adjective stem file, as shown in (3).

(3) galmas:galbma A_GALMAS "cold" ;

While the LEXC file is created automatically, the actual assignment to the correct
inflectional class is a manual process, and thus the process is semi-automatic.

4 Summary and implications
In this paper, I have outlined how inflectional classes can be determined for the main
open word classes in Pite Saami (nouns, verbs and adjectives), and how class assign-
ment can be computed using a FileMaker Pro lexical database. Noun and verb mor-
phophonology is quite complex, but is easily predictable based on the representative
lemma form, syllable count and stem-final consonant behavior. Adjectives, on the
other hand, are equally complex, but not reliably assignable to a specific adjective
inflectional class, and thus require manual assignment. Furthermore, I have covered
the basic phonological rules as implemented in TWOLC for Pite Saami. Regardless of
how inflectional class assignment occurs, LEXC files can be extracted on an ongoing
basis from the lexical database in expanding and supplementing the potency of the
Pite Saami FST generator and analyzer.

While the FST backbone is certainly nothing new, its successful implementation
for Pite Saami is an important step towards not only recognition of Pite Saami as
an official Saami language in Norway and Sweden, but also for other revitalization
efforts that are based on language technology (such as spell checkers and pedagog-
ical tools). The language technology infrastructure is not entirely complete at this
stage; for instance, closed word class LEXC files need updating and expanding, and a



169

constraint grammar implementation for reliably avoiding unnecessary wordform am-
biguities in Pite Saami texts is only in its embryonic stages. Nonetheless, the current
set of tools is already being used successfully to automatically annotate tokens in the
Pite Saami corpus of both spoken and written texts by adding lemma, part of speech,
morphophonological categories and English glosses. While using FileMaker Pro is
hardly an ideal solution, it is clearly an effective one in this particular case. Con-
tinued improvement and refinement of the Pite Saami language technology infras-
tructure should prove to be useful for both the language community and linguistics
research in the future.
