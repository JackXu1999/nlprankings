Abstract

Previous research has linked psychological
and social variables to physical health. At the
same time, psychological and social variables
have been successfully predicted from the lan-
guage used by individuals in social media. In
this paper, we conduct an initial exploratory
study linking these two areas. Using the social
media platform of Twitter, we identify users
self-reporting symptoms that are descriptive
of influenza-like illness (ILI). We analyze the
tweets of those users in the periods before, dur-
ing, and after the reported symptoms, explor-
ing emotional, cognitive, and structural com-
ponents of language. We observe a post-ILI
increase in social activity and cognitive pro-
cesses, possibly supporting previous offline
findings linking more active social activities
and stronger cognitive coping skills to a bet-
ter immune status.

1 Introduction

Stylistic variation in spoken and written commu-
nication of different users can provide rich in-
formation about them, such as their sociodemo-
graphic background (Rao et al., 2010; Argamon
et al., 2009; Lampos et al., 2014; Preoţiuc-Pietro
et al., 2015; Flekova et al., 2016), personality
(Schwartz et al., 2013), mental health (De Choud-
hury et al., 2013), mood, beliefs, fears or cogni-
tive patterns (Snowdon et al., 1996). At the same
time, researchers have been observing relations
between factors such as mental health, mental
states, personality, happiness, and physical health,
including direct relation between individual stress
level and resistance to infectious diseases (Cohen
and Williamson, 1991; Martin et al., 1995; Fried-
man, 2000; Smith and Gallo, 2001; Kiecolt-Glaser

sity of Copenhagen, Denmark

et al., 1998; Uchino, 2006). In this paper, we con-
duct an initial exploratory study linking these two
research areas. Using the social media platform
of Twitter, we identify users self-reporting symp-
toms that are descriptive of influenza-like illness
(ILI). We analyze the tweets of those users in the
periods before, during, and after the reported ILI
symptoms, and extract linguistic variables linked
to affective, cognitive, perceptual and social pro-
cesses, as well as personal concerns. We observe
a post-ILI increase in social activity and cognitive
processes, possibly supporting previous findings
that individuals, who spend less time in social ac-
tivities or are less capable of coping with stress,
are associated with a poorer immune status (Fried-
man, 2000; Pressman et al., 2005; Jaremka et al.,
2013; Pennebaker et al., 1997).

2 Related work

Socially stable individuals are at significantly
lower risk for disease (Cohen and Williamson,
1991; Martin et al., 1995; Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
1998; Friedman, 2000). Associations were found
between personality and likelihood of physical
limitations. Chronic negative emotions are asso-
ciated with suppressed immune functioning, and
optimism with lower ambulatory blood pressure
and better immune functioning (Smith and Gallo,
2001). Smolderen et al. (2007) examined stress,
negative mood, negative affectivity and social in-
hibition related to increased vulnerability to in-
fluenza on participants. They concluded that neg-
ative affectivity and perceived stress were associ-
ated with higher self-reporting of ILI.

There is considerable evidence that social isola-
tion is associated with poorer health. Those with
more types of relationships and those who spend
more time in social activities are at lower risk
for disease and mortality than their more isolated



18

counterparts (Friedman, 2000). Subjectively per-
ceived loneliness and small social networks have
also been associated with poorer immune status,
greater psychological stress and poorer sleep qual-
ity (Pressman et al., 2005; Jaremka et al., 2013).
Loneliness was also associated with greater psy-
chological stress and negative affect, less positive
affect, poorer sleep efficiency and quality, and el-
evations in circulating levels of cortisol (Pressman
et al., 2005).

Some of these psychological and social vari-
ables have been previously successfully identified
through an automated stylistic analysis of written
text. For example, a series of natural language
processing (NLP) workshops has been focusing
on predicting depression on Twitter (Coppersmith
et al., 2015b,a; Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015), find-
ing that the frequencies of functional words, aux-
iliary verbs, conjunctions, words indicating cogni-
tive mechanisms, hedging expressions and exclu-
sion words are a strongly predictive feature com-
bination to separate depressed and healthy users.
Earlier work on this topic found that authors with
depressive tendency are more self-focused, use
more frequently the “I” pronoun (Rude et al.,
2004), and discuss in social media topics around
feelings and sadness (Schwartz et al., 2014).

3 Dataset collection

We randomly sampled 14 million UK tweets, col-
lected in the years 2014-2016, and searched for
a small set of word patterns potentially indicative
of having the flu based on previous work (Lam-
pos and Cristianini, 2010, 2012; Lampos et al.,
2015), such as any combination of {I have, I feel,
I’ve got} and {flu, sore throat, high fever, stupid
fever, hate fever, ill} excluding {http, rt, jab, shot,
you, he, she}. We obtained 2,600 tweets matching
the pattern, which we then manually examined, fi-
nally obtaining 1,235 referring to the users them-
selves being sick with a flu, cold, sore throat, or
fever. The false positive tweets were often dis-
cussing news about flu, flu vaccination, or social
media trends such as (Justin) Bieber fever or cabin
fever.

The 1,235 tweets come from 285 users. These
users have been rather verbose on Twitter, produc-
ing 7.2 million tweets, responses and retweets over
the three years. We decided to monitor the period
from 7 days before the user first mentions being
sick, to 14 days after this mention, as our first as-

sumption was that the ILI symptoms last about a
week since the first tweet. However, after the man-
ual empirical exploration of user tweets over time,
we reassessed this hypothesis, and for the rest of
this study we are assuming the peak ILI period
(i.e., the time period when the flu has the most
extreme symptoms) is occurring slightly sooner,
i.e. between one day before and two days after
the time when a user is self-reporting that has the
disease (TSR, time of self-report). We obtained
144,837 tweets, and after filtering out retweets this
averaged to 231 tweets per user over these three
weeks.

4 Statistical analysis method

We extract textual features using the Linguistic In-
quiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al.,
2001), which consists of dozens of lexicons re-
lated to psychological processes (e.g., Affective,
Cognitive, Biological), personal concerns (e.g.,
Work, Leisure, Money) and other categories such
as Fillers, Disfluencies or Swear words. For each
word category, we count a relative occurrence of
the words of that category as a proportion to all
words for a given user in a given time period.

Per set of days d � 3, we calculated the mean
hoi

d

of the occurrences o for a single feature as
hoi

d

=
P

N

i=0 oi/N with N being the number of
users tweeting in that relative period d (e.g. “7
days before TSR” to “5 days before TSR”) and o

i

being a feature value for one user in that period
(e.g. relative proportion of words from category
Family to all words tweeted by that user in that
period). An example is demonstrated on Figure 2.
For each data point hoi

d

, the period d is illustrated
with the horizontal bar and the standard error the
mean SEhoi

d

= sp
N

as a vertical bar. We then
calculate the significance that the mean of the fea-
ture two and more days before the ILI symptoms
TSR differs from the mean of the feature in the as-
sumed ILI symptom peak interval (one day before
to two days after TSR), as well as the significance
that the mean of the feature three and more days
after the ILI symptoms TSR differs from it. The
significance � is calculated as:

�before =
hoibefore � hoiduringq

Before Sickness
After Sickness

Figure 1: Summary of significance of differences in feature value distributions before and after the self-reported sickness.
Generally, we are looking for � values larger than 1.96, corresponding approximately to two-tailed significance test of p = 0.05
for the feature values during and before/after the ILI peak. If in reality the feature distribution in both period was the same, we
would observe these or larger differences in <5% of the cases.

Both the � and the corresponding p-values are
listed in the individual feature plots. Generally,
we are looking for � values larger than 1.96, cor-
responding to two-tailed significance test of p =
0.05, indicating that if in reality the feature dis-
tribution in both periods was the same, we would
observe these or larger differences in < 5% of the
cases. Both the sigmas and the corresponding p-
values are listed in the individual feature plots.

5 Results

Figure 1 shows all differences in feature value dis-
tributions before and after the ILI TSR. While the
values before typically tend to resemble the val-
ues during sickness more closely, the values from
day +3 onwards show several significant (> 2�,
p < 0.05) differences. The relative frequency
of words from Friends and Family LIWC cate-
gories increases after the ILI peak (Fig. 2b and
2a). This indicates that users probably get more
socially involved after recovery, however, the rela-
tively low values in the period before the ILI may
support the hypothesis that individuals spending
less time in social activities are associated with a
poorer immune status (Friedman, 2000; Pressman
et al., 2005; Jaremka et al., 2013). We also ob-
serve a post-ILI increase in the usage of causal
words. Causal words connote terms to explain
cause and effect (e.g. reason, why, because). In-
creased use of words in this category has been pre-
viously found to be related to improved physical

health due to stronger coping skills (Pennebaker
et al., 1997). There is a 2� decrease in impersonal
pronouns after the ILI peak (Fig. 2e). Higher lev-
els of impersonal pronoun usage have been previ-
ously associated to increased anxiety levels (Cop-
persmith et al., 2015a), hence this change could
indicate a post-illness drop in anxiety.

Additional effects observed are: (a) a 2� post-
ILI decrease in assent words such as agree, OK,
yes (Fig. 2c), which surprisingly signals de-
creased levels of agreement with the social group
and is linked to lower-quality social relationships
(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010), and (b) a 3� in-
crease in second person pronouns (Fig. 2f) during
the illness, suggesting focus on others.

We found no significant difference in emotion
levels or the levels of usage of the pronoun “I”.

6 Conclusions and future work

We conduct an initial exploratory study of psy-
cholinguistic attributes of Twitter users before,
during, and after self-reported influenza symp-
toms. We observe a post-ILI change in expres-
sions that correlate with elevated levels of social
activity and cognitive processes. Interestingly, in-
stead of an expected increase in using first-person
pronoun “I” during the ILI peak (focus on self),
we observe a significant increase in second person
pronouns (“you”). We plan to extend this study
by including additional 11,000 ILI events.

Figure 2: Feature values for selected LIWC categories (specified in the sub-captions) averaged across all diagnosed users for
day intervals relative to their ILI symptoms. For each local mean value (blue point), the period of the mean is illustrated with
the horizontal bar and the standard error of the mean as a vertical bar. The horizontal blue stripe visually aids to compare to the
ILI peak standard error interval, and the vertical grey stripe to the ILI peak period. In addition, an average feature value during
the ILI peak is illustrated by a dashed line, compared to the overall average of the feature (yellow line).
