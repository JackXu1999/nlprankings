Abstract

In this paper, we exploit natural language pro-
cessing techniques to build a system that au-
tomatically segments Hadith into its two main
components, Isnad and Matn. We evaluate the
previous attempts to segment Hadith and iden-
tified the limitations in these studies. Then a
Hadith segmentation system is built and tested
with Hadith collections extracted from six dif-
ferent Hadith books. The result demonstrates
that bi-grams are effective in identifying Ha-
dith segments with 92.5% accuracy.

1 Introduction

Advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP),
encouraged researchers to tackle problems associ-
ated with textual data. In this work, we exploit
NLP methods to build a system that automatically
segments Hadith text, which is the collection of
narratives reporting different aspects of Prophet
Muhammad’s life.

Hadith originated in the 7th century and is con-
sidered classical Arabic with unique structure, lin-
guistic features, and patterns that make it suit-
able for applying computational models. More-
over, Hadith possesses historical importance and
is still used by Muslims around the world. This is
because not all Islamic laws and regulations are
mentioned in the Islamic holy book, the Quran.
Hence, producing Hadith resources will be useful
for a wider community including Islamic scholars,
historians, linguists, and computer scientists.

Before building such Hadith resources, it is cru-
cial to explain what constitutes the Hadith litera-
ture. It is a huge collection of Hadiths1 that record
every aspect of the prophet’s life. In addition to
that, there are supporting documents which in-
clude commentaries that explain the Hadith text,

1The plural of Hadith is AHadith, but we will use Hadiths

Figure 1: Hadith Example, Isnad in bold

and biographic material that identify narrators of
Hadith, which is central in studying Hadith au-
thenticity.

Hadith types vary, it could be a short sentence
or long paragraph describing what the prophet said
in a specific incident, a dialogue of the prophet’s
conversation with someone, or a story told by the
prophet’s companions that explain the prophet’s
actions in a specific matter like ’prayer’. Every
Hadith consists of two parts, as shown in Figure
1, the Isnad which is a chain of narrators shown
in bold face text, followed by Matn which is the
actual teaching. However, these parts exist as one
sentence or paragraph where researchers manually
segment Isnad from Matn to focus on one part
(Luthfi et al., 2018). For example, researchers
analyse Isnad to visualizing the chain of narra-
tors (Muazzam Siddiqui, 2014) and identify how
Hadith travelled through time. While other re-
searchers focus on Matn with the aim to categorize
Hadith into subtopics (Saloot et al., 2016).

Although there are research in the area of Ha-
dith computation, it is still in its infancy with limit
contributions (Bounhas, 2019). In fact, there are
no common datasets, benchmarks, or evaluation
measures as pointed in a recent survey of research



on Arabic NLP (Guellil et al., 2019). It shows
that only 11% of the available Arabic resources
are classical-Arabic and none dedicated for Ha-
dith. These resources are mostly dedicated for the
Quran, such as Dukes and Atwell (2012). There-
fore, we aim to build a segmentation model to pro-
duce a Hadith corpus where Isnad and Matn are
annotated to serve the wider research community
and advance the field.
This paper is organized as follows, we survey pre-
vious attempts to identify Isnad segments in sec-
tion 2 and discuss their limitations. Then we in-
troduce the data used to build and test our system
in section 3. After that we present our Hadith seg-
mentation model in section 4, and discuss the re-
sults in section 5.

2 Literature Review

Surveying the literature, we found a number of
attempts to detect Isnad patterns. Table 1 shows
summaries of such work and the following para-
graphs discuss these papers and their limitations.

Muazzam Siddiqui (2014) attempted to segment
Isnad from Matn by using supervised machine
learning (ML) algorithms that require an anno-
tated corpus. Thus, a native Arabic speaker an-
notated Hadith tokens extracted from Sahih Al-
Bukhari2 into five classes (beginning of Person,
inside Person, beginning of Narrator, inside Nar-
rator, and Other) where Narrator corresponds to
names in Isnad, and Person corresponds to names
in Matn.

After annotating the corpus, they studied Hadith
contextual patterns to identify features to be used
in classification. For example, the word ’told us
- A 	J�KYg’ is followed by a narrator’s name in Hadith

Isnad, and the word ’son of - 	áK.’ is part of a name.
Another example is the honorific phrases that al-
ways follows a person’s name. The classifier takes
the training data and features in the form of ’fea-
ture, class’ where each word is classified as ’be-
ginning/inside Person, beginning/ inside Narrator,
or Other’. Then the system classifies new Hadith
tokens and segments the Hadith by finding the end
of the consecutive list of narrators.

Their system’s performance was measured
based on two factors. First, its ability to assign
each token the correct type irrespective of the

2Mohammad AlBukhari, Sahih AlBukhari (2002). Dam-
ascus: Dar Ibn Kathir.

boundaries as long as there is an overlap. Sec-
ond, its ability to correctly find the boundary of
each name independent of type assigned (narrator
or person). The system produced 90% accuracy in
the testing phase. Then for evaluation, they used
another manually labeled Hadith book titled ’Mus-
nad Ahmed’ which contains 5K tokens that pro-
duced 80% accuracy.

Harrag (2014) built a Finite State Transducers
(FST) system to extract Hadith segments which
include Num-Kitab, Title-Kitab, Num-Bab, Title-
Bab, Num-Hadith, Isnad, Matn, Taalik, and Atraf.
He used the beginning of words like ’K’ for Kitab
to identify the book title. Furthermore, he used
punctuation to identify other parts of the Hadith
assuming that all Matn is surrounded by paren-
thesis. These features depend on the Hadith book
used and how well and correctly it is punctuated.
Thus, it cannot be applied to all kinds of Hadith
books. His work measures the system’s perfor-
mance to identify several components of Hadith
that range from Isnad and going deeper into iden-
tifying the narrator’s names. However, for the pur-
pose of our study we only report the result of Isnad
extraction which was 44% precision.

Azmi and Bin Badia (2010) built a system that
aims to draw the tree of narrators, but first Isnad
must be extracted. To extract Isnad, they identi-
fied pre-processing steps which include removing
diacritics and punctuation; apply shallow parsing
to handle noise and leave out words which it is not
able to parse. Using the shallow parsing output,
Noun phrases were the candidate of being a nar-
rator’s name. After pre-processing the data, they
applied context free grammar to identify each seg-
ment in the Hadith by comparing the tokens to the
list of Hadith lexicon they compiled earlier. Since
the goal of their study is to build the tree, their re-
sult reflects the system’s success to draw the tree
and not the segmentation part.

Maraoui et al. (2018) compiled a list of trigger
words that come before, after, and between nar-
rator’s names. Furthermore, they identified words
that mark the termination of each Hadith which are
’ é 	¯ @Q£


@’ or ’ é 	®m�

�
'’. Using these comprehensive lists

of words, they were able to segment Isnad from
Matn for Sahih Albukhari. However, it is not clear
whether it can be used to segment other Hadith
books.

Table 1: Review of Previous Research on Hadith Segmentation

Hadith. First, it extracts each Hadith from the
book by finding the number of each Hadith. Then
the Arabic text is converted to its transliteration to
find the words of transmission based on a list they
compiled. It assumes any words between these
transmission words are the narrator’s names. Once
there are no transmission terms detected, the sys-
tem marks the end of Isnad. However, the exact
point of Hadith segmentation is sometimes am-
biguous even for humans. To overcome this prob-
lem, they have set a threshold of 100 characters
which they picked based on trial and error. This
threshold tells the system if no other transmission
word is detected within the next 100 characters
then Matn starts.

Mahmood et al. (2018) extracted Hadiths from
different sources, but did not mention any Hadith
lexicon list compiled to be used in the Regex. In
fact, Hadith lexicons were encoded in the Regex
which is not fit for re-usability.

2.1 Limitation of Previous Studies

In the previous research, Hadith segmentation was
done using three approaches. First, rule-based that
consists of whitelists (or gazetteers) to identify
names and Isnad specific words, a filtration mech-
anism (or Blacklists) to identify Matn words, and
grammar rules (as a set of regular expressions) to

identify the segmentation point. Second is the ML
approach which consists of data annotation, fea-
ture and algorithm selection, training and classifi-
cation. The third is the FST which depends on the
degree of consistency in a well-structured text.

Looking at Table 1 above, it is evident that
rule-based produced better results. However, it is
not clear if the rule-based approach designed for
one book can be applied to all Hadith books. In
fact, researchers in Mahmood et al. (2018) cre-
ated different regular expressions for the differ-
ent Hadith books which imply that rule-based ap-
proaches cannot be universal. In the other hand,
the ML approach is no better since it requires
training data that represent all kinds of Hadith to
make its performance acceptable when applied to
the different Hadith books. For example, the study
presented in Muazzam Siddiqui (2014) reported a
drop in performance by 10 points once the model
was tested with a different book. Another problem
is associated with FST, segmentation will not work
if the Hadith book does not use unique punctua-
tion that surrounds each segment e.g. parenthesis
around Matn.

Although we try to compare systems perfor-
mance in the table above, it is crucial to clarify
that the approaches are not comparable for two
reasons. First, the data used to test the systems



are different in terms of size and type. Second,
the way system performance was measured is dif-
ferent in every study. For example. The study
in Muazzam Siddiqui (2014) measured the preci-
sion of the system’s ability to annotate the person’s
name as Narrator or not. That is whether each
name is part of Isnad or Matn. Therefore, their
system goal is not to segment but rather to iden-
tify narrators. To sum up, the results column in
the table above for papers (Harrag, 2014)(Maraoui
et al., 2018) (Boella, 2011)(Mahmood et al., 2018)
reflect the segmentation performance, while the
other studies report the performance of named
entity recognition(NER) of narrators in Hadith,
which can be used in segmentation.

3 Data Preparation

Before building the segmenter, testing data must
be prepared. There is a countless number of Ha-
dith books with a varying degree of authenticity.
For the purpose of our project, we include the six
famous books, commonly referred to The Authen-
tic Six or canonical Hadith books. These books
are Sahih Albukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu
Dawood, Sunan Altarmithi, and Sunan Ibn Maja.
From each book, 40 Hadiths were carefully cho-
sen to form 240 Hadiths that include Hadiths with
irregular patterns. This is to ensure we accomplish
two goals. First, overcome the limitation of previ-
ous studies that relied on one book; second, to pro-
duce a realistic performance of a segmenter that
can deal with all types of Hadith books.
Then we gathered data required by our system
to segment Hadith, which we refer to as training
data. It is a list of Isand and Matn segments ex-
tracted from a well-structured Hadith book ’Sahih
Albukhari’. To automate this task, we scrutinize
Hadith parts to find that Isnad consists of a closed
set of words that includes narrators’ names and
transmission words. The example of Isnad in Fig-
ure 2 underlines the unique words in Isnad. A
common pattern in Isnad is the narrator’s name
which takes the form of ’first name - son of- fa-
ther’s name’, so it is two names connected by a
’relation’ word. Narrator’s names are usually fol-
lowed by ’transmission’ words that reflect how the
Hadith was reported e.g. x ’heard’ y or x ’said’.
Hence, transmission words will appear four words
apart at most. Using this information, we cre-
ated a list of Isnad lexicons that consists of ’trans-
mission’ and ’relation’ words. Then we created

Figure 2: Isnad Example, Isnad lexicons underlined

a python script that tokenizes a Hadith and takes
four words at a time to check if an Isnad lexicons
is present. Once it detects a group of four words
with no Isnad lexicons, it assumes the beginning
of Matn text and separates the Hadith at that point.
This approach will automatically detect Isnad with
regular patterns only, so this step intends to collect
the various names of narrators instead of segment-
ing the Hadith.
We manually checked the result of this bootstrap-
ping approach that produced a collection of more
than four thousand Hadiths to form our gold stan-
dard of Isnad and Matn segments.

4 Segmentation Model

In this section, we discuss the techniques and algo-
rithms used to build the Hadith segmenter. Figure
3 shows the structure and components of the Ha-
dith segmenter model which takes in a new Hadith
that goes through a preprocessing phase to remove
diacritics and punctuations. Then Hadith is tok-
enized into N-grams depending on the technique
applied, next each token is labelled as Isnad, Matn
or Neither by comparing it with pre-compiled lists
obtained from the gold standard created earlier as
explained in section 3. Once every token is la-
belled, the model finds the best segmentation point
of the Hadith. In the following lines, we give de-
tails of the techniques used to annotate Hadith to-
kens.

4.1 Tri-gram Technique

In a previous study, we have shown that consider-
ing the meaning of words by using the word em-



Figure 3: Hadith Segmenter Model

bedding technique does not perform well in Hadith
segmentation. This is because such an approach
relies on uni-grams that do not capture the unique
pattern in Isnad. Furthermore, some words exist in
both Isnad and Matn segments, Hence, in this ex-
periment, we aim to capture Isnad patterns by us-
ing the N-gram technique. As illustrated in Figure
3, Isnad and Matn segments are extracted from the
gold standard of segmented Hadiths. Then they
are pre-processed to remove diacritics and punc-
tuations. Finally, tri-gram, bi-gram and uni-gram
lists for Isnad and Matn are created to be the eval-
uation lists in the annotation phase. The reason
three lists are created is that a back-off approach
can handle irregularity and missing information.
For example, if an encountered tri-gram has no
match in the tri-gram list of the training data, it can
be annotated according to its components. Con-
sider a narrator’s full name is not captured in the
lists, then Hadith lexicons like ’ 	áK. - son of ’ will
enable the system to identify this tri-gram as part
of the narrator’s chain and label it ’Isnad’. This
approach is detailed in Algorithm 1. Once every
token is labelled, the system finds the segmenta-
tion point as detailed in Algorithm 2.

This approach produced 48% accuracy where
only 115 out of 240 Hadiths were correctly seg-
mented. To understand this disappointing result,
we inspect the incorrectly segmented Hadith and
found that the system rarely used the tri-gram fea-

Qutaiba told us Marwan bin Muawiya al-Fizari
from Abu Yafour from Al-Walid bin Al-Azar

Masood, which work is better? He said I asked
the Messenger of Allah (PBUH): ”Which action
is dearest to Allah?” He (PBUH) replied, ”Per-
forming the prayer at its earliest fixed time.” I
asked, ”What is next ?”

O prophet, He said, ”Kindness towards parents.”

ture, but rather relied on the bi-gram and uni-gram
features to annotate tokens. Consider the exam-
ple in Table 2, feeding this Hadith to the system
produces 79 tri-grams, of which only 15 found a
match in the tri-gram training set. The remaining
64 tri-grams relied on the bi-gram and uni-gram
training set to be annotated. This dependency on
bi-gram/uni-gram features to annotate Hadith tri-
grams produced unreliable results as illustrated in
the example. The phrase ’ÈA�¯ Cg. P

	
à


@ - that a man

said’ should mark the beginning of Matn, instead
it was labelled as Isnad. This is because when the
system did not find a match in the tri-gram training
set, it applied the back-off approach and searched
in the bi-gram and uni-gram lists. Since it found
a match for the term ’ÈA�¯ said ’ in the Isnad lists,
it labelled the phrase accordingly. Therefore, us-
ing tri-grams did not prove useful in our case for
two reasons. First, the training data is not large

enough to cover all known narrators. Second, it is
obtained from only one Hadith book which does
not include all Hadith lexicons and patterns.

4.2 Bi-gram Technique

To improve the system performance, we omit tri-
gram features and use bi-grams and uni-grams
only.

The bi-gram technique produced better results
as expected with 222 Hadith out of 240 were cor-
rectly segmented, showing 92.5% accuracy. In
fact, it is able to segment Hadiths having differ-
ent structures. For example, the traditional ones
where a Matn start with a prophetic saying as
shown in Table 3. Other Hadith structures in-
clude those containing irregular patterns where
Matn starts with an introductory phrase followed
by the prophetic saying as shown in Table 4, a di-
alogue with the prophet as shown in Table 5, or an
explanation of a prophetic deed as in Table 6.

Then we analyse the faulty output and found
that our system incorrectly segmented some Ha-
diths with irregular patterns. For example, a Ha-
dith may contain a parallel Isnad, which is a chain
of narrators that ends at the prophet followed by
another chain of narrators that ends at the prophet
again, as shown in Table 7. Another example of
an irregular pattern in Isnad is shown in Table 8
which illustrates that Isnad may contain Matn pat-
terns. Finally, Table 9 shows that some Hadith
posses a vague segmentation point. Note that for
space issues some Hadiths in the examples were
truncated as indicated by (...).

from Anas may Allah be pleased with him, the
Prophet

(PBUH), and from Husayn al-Muallim said Qatada
told us from Anas that the Prophet (PBUH) said:
”No one of you becomes a true believer until he
likes for his brother what he likes for himself”.

Muhammad bin Mansour told us, that Sufian said
Yahya bin Said told us about Muslim bin Abi
Maryam a Sheikh from Madinah then I met the
Sheikh and he said he heard Ali bin Abdul Rah-
man say I prayed beside Ibn Omar, while I turned
the gravel he said

Do not fluctuate the gravel, turning the gravel is
from the devil and do as I saw the Messenger of
Allah peace be upon him do...

Table 9: Incorrectly segmented, names should be part of Matn.

5 Discussion

The findings of this study clearly show that us-
ing bi-grams for Hadith segmentation works bet-
ter than tri-grams specifically because our train-
ing data is limited. Although the segmenter result
is promising, not all Hadiths with irregular pat-
terns were correctly segmented. In fact, this can
be vague even for human annotators who are not

experts in Hadith studies. For this reason, we ar-
gue that Hadith can be segmented to fine-grained
segments that go beyond Isnad and Matn. This is
because some Hadith contain information in the
Isnad that was identified as Matn segments by our
system. For example, a Hadith Isnad may include
information about where a specific narrator comes
from, then it continues the chain of narrators. An-



other example is a Hadith that starts a Matn seg-
ment with a piece of introductory information con-
taining names of people which was identified as Is-
nad pattern by our segmenter as in Table 9. Thus,
we aim to make an enhancement to Algorithm 2 to
enable the segmenter output several segments in-
stead of two, then apply probabilistic measures to
identify the exact point of segmentation.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate the need for Hadith
common datasets and our initiative to bridge the
gap by automatically annotating Hadith corpus us-
ing NLP. The main objective of this study is to
build a system that segments and annotates Ha-
dith components, Isnad and Matn. Before build-
ing our system, we evaluated previous attempts
to segment Hadith and found that the successful
techniques rely on hand-crafted tools that cannot
be generalized to segment all Hadith types. Fur-
thermore, these systems were tested on a limited
number of Hadiths from a single book. To ad-
dress these limitations, our segmenter rely on NLP
techniques and tested with Hadiths extracted from
six books to ensure coverage of all Hadith types.
Although it was successful in segmenting Hadith
with 92.5% accuracy, examining the incorrect re-
sults points us to ways of improvements discussed
in the paper.
