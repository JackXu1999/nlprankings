ABSTRACT 

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Part Of Speech (POS) tagset has been prepared for the 
Indian Languages by the POS Tag Standardization Committee of Department of Information 
Technology (DIT), New Delhi, India. The BIS POS tagset aims to ensure standardization in the 
POS tagging of all the Indian Languages. It has been used for POS tagging in the Indian 
Languages Corpora Initiative (ILCI) project which has developed parallel annotated corpora 
consisting of 25000 sentences each from the tourism and the health domain for 11 Indian 
Languages.  

In this paper we present some challenges encountered while using the BIS POS tagset for 
Konkani, a morphologically rich Indian Language, along with the possible solutions to overcome 
these challenges.

1. Introduction 

Annotated text corpora are a basic and a very useful resource for researchers in Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) for developing various language technologies. The annotation of corpora is 
done using a set of tags defined for this purpose. The BIS tagset is a set of tags evolved by the 
POS Tag Standardization committee appointed by the DIT to standardize and streamline the 
process of POS tagging in Indian languages. 

A need for standard tagset along with guidelines for using it arose because a lot of researchers 
were working independently following the tags of their own choice to mark the POS within and 
across languages. This affected the reusability of the tagged data amongst researchers. Hence, in 
order to facilitate interoperability an exercise was made to have a consensus on the style and 
characteristics of POS tagging, so as to arrive at a common standard for tagging in Indian 
Languages. This led to the standardized BIS tagset for POS tagging for Indian Languages. 
Several meetings of experts in the field were held to decide on the tagset and all groups engaged 
in research in NLP were given standard guidelines for annotation. This paper aims at shedding 
light on the peculiarities of the Konkani language that have posed challenges in tagging corpora 
using the standard BIS tagset. The paper is organized as follows – section 2 briefly introduces the 
BIS tagset and the Konkani Language and the challenges encountered while tagging using the 
BIS POS tagset for Konkani are presented in section 3 which is followed by section on 
conclusion and future work. 

2. BIS tagset and Konkani Language  

The BIS POS tagset is prepared keeping in view the comments of experts in the area of NLP and 
Language Technology (LT) for Indian languages. This tagset is an important step taken by DIT to 
ensure that NLP practitioners involved in tagging follow a common tagset while tagging various 
corpora. The tagset initially consisted of 38 tags. These tags were then modified after taking 
inputs from linguists, computer scientists and language experts. More details of the BIS tagset 
can be found in Chaudhary, 2010. The BIS tagset is a commendable effort. But the process of 
tagging was, at times, quite challenging as it was different from the conventional style of tagging 
(for example, the case of marking adverbs of place and location as NSTs (locative nouns) . 

Konkani is an Indo-European (Indo-Aryan) language evolved from Sanskrit. It is a 
morphologically rich Indian language (Almeida, 1989). It is one of the twenty two languages 
included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. It is spoken by the people of the state 
of Goa, in some parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and in some pockets of Kerala. It is influenced 
and enriched by various other languages like Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Arabic, 
Persian, Portuguese and English. It is the official language of Goa with Devanagari as the 
officially recognized script. It is also written in Roman, Kannada, and Malayalam scripts 
(Walawalikar, et.al. 2010). 

2.1 BIS POS tagset for Konkani 

The BIS tagset was used for tagging the Konkani ILCI corpus consisting of a total of 50000 
sentences (730330 tokens). The main objective of the ILCI project was to develop standard 
quality parallel annotated corpora for 11 Indian languages including English language to promote 
NLP research for Indian Languages (Chaudhary, 2010).

3. Issues in tagging using the standardized BIS tagset  

POS tagging is an ongoing process and we may need to modify the tagset to accommodate newer 
findings, etc. Some tags have been modified whereas some are still being discussed. For example, 
in the initial stages of BIS POS discussions, it was decided that names of cities, institutions, 
organizations, people and months were to be tagged as Proper Nouns (NNP) whereas names of 
medicines, diseases, flowers, animals and seasons were to be taken as Common Nouns (NN). 
This decision was later refined. Blood Cancer (a specific type of a Cancer) was tagged as NNP 
and Cancer (a general category of diseases) was tagged as NN. Decisions taken may have to be 
modified and documenting these will help us trace the line of our path. So also this 
documentation will help newcomers in this area to foresee problems which may arise in tagging 
corpora using this tagset. It is important to remember that flexibility in the tagset is for the 
purpose of refinement and accuracy in the tagging process and not for disclosing our earlier 
‘inappropriate’ decisions. We know that words in a language have the capacity to function 
differently when they appear in a sentence. For example, in रां>दFलG जेवण (rAMdilleM jevaNa) 
‘cooked food’, रां>दFलG functions as a modifier whereas रा>ंदFलG in हांवG दनपारां जेवण रां>दFलG 
(hAveM danapArAM jevaNa rAMdilleM) (‘I had cooked food in the afternoon’) functions as a 
verb. The present tagset is used to tag words according to their lexical rather than syntactic 
function. The lacunae if any in this practice may come to light only when we move to higher 
levels of NLP.   

Some of the minor challenges arising from the usage of the proposed BIS tagset while POS 
tagging the ILCI Corpora for Konkani language could be placed under the following main heads: 

149



3.1 Word Sense Disambiguation Challenges 
The hyphen is marked as punctuation in the BIS tagset, but in Konkani it conveys different 
information on different occasions. In some cases, a pair of two words joined by a hyphen is a 
compound word whereas in other cases it may be just a noun phrase. Various senses conveyed by 
the hyphen need to be separated and structurally identified as specific compounds. This would 
facilitate word sense disambiguation. 
Examples: 
• बरG-वायट  bareM-vAyaT  (‘good-bad’). In this example, the hyphen marks a pair of 

antonyms. In isolation, the words in this pair function as adjectives whereas the pair as a 
whole functions as a noun.  
For example, in तG एक बरG चल$  teM eka bareM chalI (‘she is a good girl’), and तG एक वायट 
चल$  teM eka vAyaT chalI (‘she is a bad girl’, बरG bareM ‘good’ and वायट vAyaT ‘bad’ 
both function as adjectives. However, in ताका बरG-वायट समजना tAkA bareM-vAyaT 
samajanA (‘he does not know what is good and what is bad’ i.e. ‘he does not know his 
good’), the pair बरG-वायट bareM-vAyaT functions as noun. 

• The hyphen in the pair बायल-मनीस bAyal manIsa (‘woman-human’) marks a specifier-
specified relationship. In Konkani, मनीस manIsa ‘human being’ is a gender neutral term. 
The following sentences illustrate this point: 
1. तो एक बरो मनीस to ek baro manIs (‘he is a good human being’) 
2. ती एक बर$ मनीस tI ek barI manIs (‘she is a good human being’) 

 
We see that in both the above sentences मनीस ‘human being’ remains the same. However, the 
term can be specified by other gender specific nouns such as दादलो dAdlo (masculine) ‘man’, 
चल$ chalI (feminine/neuter) ‘girl/daughter’, बायल bAyl (feminine) ‘woman’ when it occurs in 
compounds such as दादलो मनीस (‘man-human’), बायल मनीस (‘woman-human’), चल$ मनीस 
(‘girl-human’). For example, in दादFया मनशाक तG कळचGना dAdlya manashAka teM 
kaLacheMnA (‘a male human (i.e. a man) will not understand this’), dAdlo ‘man’ specifies the 
masculine gender of मनीस manIsa ‘human being’. Thus the role of hyphen cannot be ignored in 
the compounds of the above type. 
• In भाट-बGस bhAT- beMsa (‘property-assets’), the hyphen is used to mark a ‘synonymic 

compound’. Such an occurrence of a hyphen is very common in Konkani. For example, 
भांगर-3शगंर, धन-दौलत etc. These synonymous pairs are mostly a combination of a native 
and a foreign language word. For example, in भाट-बGस, the first word is a native word 
whereas the second one is a word from Portuguese. 

• The hyphen in /कताब-ए->हदं kitAba-e-hiMda (‘kitab-e-hind’) is used to highlight a foreign 

title. 

• The hyphen in 10-20 means ‘to’ (i.e. it conveys the inclusion of numerals from 10 to 20). 
The hyphen does occur in other expressions containing numerals. However, it conveys a 

different sense. For example in the Konkani sentence ताका मारपाक सात-आठ मनीस 

आ3शFले (tAkA mArapAka sAta-ATh manIs Ashille) ‘to hit him seven-eight people were 

there’ (i.e. ‘around seven to eight people were present to hit him’), the phrase सात-आठ is 

joined by the hyphen. Here, the hyphen expresses a sense of ‘unsurety’ within the mind of 
the speaker about number of people that were present before him.  

150



• The phrase साड-ेसात sADe-sAta means ‘half past seven’. Such an usage of the hyphen can 

be found in other temporal expressions such as in सवाय-आठ savAya-ATh (quarter past 

eight), etc. It is the hyphen that helps to mark this phrase. 
 

3.2 Punctuation 
Marking an inverted comma as punctuation is misleading in some cases. For example, in ‘कॉKेंस 
पाटL’ चो kA.Ngresa pArTI cha.o (‘of Congress Party’), चो is a suffix of the noun phrase 
‘Congress Party’. This phrase is put in inverted commas as it is a foreign language phrase. Thus 
marking inverted commas in such cases as punctuation is not proper.  
 

3.3 Tagging of spatio-temporal adverbs as NST 
All nouns in Konkani undergo oblique formation before they take a case suffix.  
राम rAm becomes रामा rAmA before it takes any suffix like -क ka, -न na, -चो cho, etc. However, 
the spatio-temporal adverbs take suffixes before undergoing oblique formation. E.g. भायर+लो 
bhAyara + lo> भायलो bhAyalo ‘of outside’, सकयल +Mयान sakayala +chyAna > सकयFयान 
sakayalyAna ‘from below’. 
Moreover, these adverbs take only the above mentioned suffixes. Combinations like भायर +क 
bhAyara +ka ‘to the one outside’ भायर +आंत bhAyara+AMta ‘in the one outside’ are not 
permitted in the language.  If these adverbs are tagged as nouns (NSTs) then they must be treated 
as a special category of nouns. 
 

3.4 Recognition of frozen expressions 
Some expressions in language function in a certain way.  खरG NहणFयार khareM mhaNalyAra 
(Truly/Really speaking) खरG  KhareM in Konkani means ‘truth’ whereas NहणFयार mhaNalyAra 
means ‘having told’ which is a quotative.  
However, when these two words come together, they always function like an adverb. Tagging 
these words individually would serve no purpose.  Some more examples in the same category are 
listed below - 
सांगपाचG NहणFयार sAMgapAcheM mhaNalyAra  “Of-telling if told” means ‘actually’.  
तशG पळेFयार  tasheM paLayalyAra “that way if seen” also means ‘actually’. 
 

3.5 Negation 
One has to be careful in the treatment of negation in Konkani. Negation found in Hindi is not all 
the same in Konkani. In Hindi, negation is mainly a syntactic process whereas in Konkani, it is a 
morphological one. Examples illustrating this point are given below: 
Hindi:  

3.5.1 a नह$.ं मO नह$ ंआउंगा nahIM. maiM nahI AuMgA (‘No. I will not come’) 

3.5.1 b नह$.ं हम नह$ ंआयGगे nahIM. hama nahIM AyeMge (‘No. We will not come’) 
Konkani:  

3.5.2 a ना. हांव येवंचो ना nA. hAMva yevaMcho nA (‘No. I will not come’) 

3.5.2 b ना. आमी येवंच ेनात nA. AmI yevaMche nAt (‘No. We will not come’) 
So also in Hindi, negation occurs at all places as a particle (in the sentences 3.5.1 a and 3.5.1 b), 
whereas in Konkani the first word in 3.5.2 a and 3.5.2 b is a particle and the second one in 3.5.2b 
is a finite verb. 

151



Conclusion and Future Work 

A fruitful comparison between languages (for example between different grammatical 
categories) has been possible because of the BIS tagset. The tagset has helped in bringing to our 
minds the differences existing between Indian Languages. For example, Konkani words marked 
as NSTs (a subcategory of nouns) under the BIS tagset do not have an oblique form whereas 
other subcategories of nouns in Konkani always have an oblique form. However, the tag NST 
seems to work fairly well in other Indian languages. 

Differences between languages which may pose challenges in Indian Language–Indian 
Language translation can be predicted to a fair extent with this tagset. For example, 
postpositions like Hindi का never occur separately in Konkani. One may be tempted to translate 
राम का rAm kA (of Ram) as राम चो rAm -cho which actually should be रामाचो rAmAcho. 

• solutions proposed for the issues faced: 

The BIS tagset has no doubt prepared the ground for fruitful annotations. It is up to the experts of 
each language to examine this tagset closely and suggest necessary refinements pertaining to 
their language. It may not be possible to include new tags to handle current issues but we could 
deal with them keeping the standardized tagset intact.  We propose following suggestions to deal 
with some of the above mentioned issues.  

The hyphen sometimes functions as an integral part of compounds and phrases. Marking it as a 
punctuation mark will mean ignoring the subtle information that it conveys in these occurrences. 
We feel that the role of the hyphen has to be recognized as it would not only help in word sense 
disambiguation (as in the case of बरG-वायट bareM-vAyaT ‘good-bad’) but also bring to light 
certain peculiarities of Konkani (as in the case of भाट-बGस bhAT- beMsa ‘property-assets’ where 
the synonymic compound is formed with a word from Portuguese). 

Frozen expressions, for example can be marked with a special tag at POS level itself so that there 
is no wastage of time in unnecessary work, later. For example, in खरG NहणFयार KhareM 
mhaNalyAra ‘really/truly speaking’ tagging individual words would serve no purpose. Instead 
the token ‘खरG  NहणFयार’ could be marked as FE i.e. frozen expression. The appropriate category 
(i.e. adverb) could be marked at the next level of NLP. 

While recognizing the importance of standardization in the POS tagging of all the Indian 
Languages, we also feel that we should be careful in not to lose on the grammatical peculiarities 
of individual languages as it may have an adverse effect on the later stages of NLP.
