Abstract

Recent approaches to question generation have
used modifications to a Seq2Seq architecture
inspired by advances in machine translation.
Models are trained using teacher forcing to
optimise only the one-step-ahead prediction.
However, at test time, the model is asked to
generate a whole sequence, causing errors to
propagate through the generation process (ex-
posure bias). A number of authors have sug-
gested that optimising for rewards less tightly
coupled to the training data might counter this
mismatch. We therefore optimise directly for
various objectives beyond simply replicating
the ground truth questions, including a novel
approach using an adversarial discriminator
that seeks to generate questions that are in-
distinguishable from real examples. We con-
firm that training with policy gradient meth-
ods leads to increases in the metrics used as
rewards. We perform a human evaluation, and
show that although these metrics have previ-
ously been assumed to be good proxies for
question quality, they are poorly aligned with
human judgement and the model simply learns
to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source.

1 Introduction

Posing questions about a document in natural lan-
guage is a crucial aspect of the effort to automati-
cally process natural language data, enabling ma-
chines to ask clarification questions (Saeidi et al.,
2018), become more robust to queries (Yu et al.,
2018), and to act as automatic tutors (Heilman and
Smith, 2010).

Recent approaches to question generation have
used Seq2Seq (Sutskever et al., 2014) models with
attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014) and a form of
copy mechanism (Vinyals et al., 2015; Gulcehre
et al., 2016). Such models are trained to generate a
plausible question, conditioned on an input docu-
ment and answer span within that document (Zhou

et al., 2018; Du et al., 2017; Du and Cardie, 2018;
Yuan et al., 2017).

There are currently no dedicated question
generation datasets, and authors have used
the context-question-answer triples available in
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). Only a sin-
gle question is available for each context-answer
pair, and models are trained using teacher forc-
ing (Williams and Zipser, 1989). This lack of di-
verse training data combined with the one-step-
ahead training procedure exacerbates the problem
of exposure bias (Ranzato et al., 2015). The model
does not learn how to distribute probability mass
over sequences that are valid but different to the
ground truth; during inference, the model must
predict the whole sequence, and may not be robust
to mistakes during decoding.

Recent work has investigated training the mod-
els directly on a performance based objective, ei-
ther by optimising for BLEU score (Kumar et al.,
2018a) or other quality metrics (Yuan et al., 2017).
By decoupling the training procedure from the
ground truth data, the model is able to explore
the space of possible questions and learn to re-
cover from suboptimal predictions during decod-
ing. While the metrics used seem to be intuitively
good choices, there is an assumption that they are
good proxies for question quality which has not
yet been confirmed.

Our contributions are as follows. We perform
fine tuning using a range of rewards, including a
novel adversarial objective that directly estimates
the probability that a question was generated or
came from the ground truth data. We show that
although fine tuning leads to increases in reward
scores, the resulting models perform worse when
evaluated by human workers. We also demonstrate
that the generated questions exploit weaknesses in
the reward models.



Context
although united methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time , these practices and beliefs can
be traced to the writings of the church ’s founders , especially john wesley and charles wesley ( anglicans ) , but also
philip william otterbein and martin boehm ( united brethren ) , and jacob albright ( evangelical association ) .

Rewards Output
Ground Truth Question who were two of the founders of the united methodist church ?
No fine tuning which two methodist can be traced to the church ’s founders ?
LM according to the writings of the church ’s founders , according to the writings of

the church ’s founders , [...]
QA who in anglicans ?
LM and QA who are the writings of the church ’s founders ?
Discriminator who founded the church ’s founders ?

Table 1: Example generated questions for various fine-tuning objectives. The answer is highlighted in bold. The
model trained on a QA reward has learned to simply point at the answer and exploit the QA model, while the
model trained on a language model objective has learned to repeat common phrase templates.

2 Background

Many of the advances in natural language gen-
eration have been led by machine translation
(MT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al.,
2014; Gulcehre et al., 2016).

Previous work on question generation has made
extensive use of MT techniques. Du et al. (2017)
use a Seq2Seq based model to generate questions
conditioned on context-answer pairs, and build on
this work by preprocessing the context to resolve
coreferences and adding a pointer network (Du
and Cardie, 2018). Similarly, Zhou et al. (2018)
use a part-of-speech tagger to augment the em-
bedding vectors. Both authors perform a human
evaluation of their models, and show significant
improvement over their baseline. Kumar et al.
(2018a) use a similar model, but apply it to the
task of generating questions without conditioning
on a specific answer span. Song et al. (2018)
use a modified context encoder based on multi-
perspective context matching (Wang et al., 2016).

Kumar et al. (2018b) propose a framework for
fine tuning using policy gradients and perform
a human evaluation showing promising results.
However, they use as rewards various similarity
metrics that are still coupled to the ground truth.
Yuan et al. (2017) describe a Seq2Seq model with
attention and a pointer network, with an additional
encoding layer for the answer. They also describe
a method for further tuning their model using pol-
icy gradients, with rewards given by an external
language model and question answering (QA) sys-
tem. Unfortunately they do not perform any hu-

man evaluation to determine whether this tuning
led to improved question quality.

For the related task of summarisation, Paulus
et al. (2017) propose a framework for fine tuning
a summarisation model using reinforcement learn-
ing, with the ROUGE similarity metric used as the
reward.

3 Experimental setup

The task is to generate a natural language ques-
tion, conditioned on a document and the location
of an answer within that document. For exam-
ple, given the input document “this paper investi-
gates rewards for question generation” and answer
“question generation”, the model should produce
a question such as “what is investigated in the pa-
per?”

3.1 Model description

We use the model architecture described by Yuan
et al. (2017). Briefly, this is a Seq2Seq
model (Sutskever et al., 2014) with attention (Bah-
danau et al., 2014) and copy mechanism (Vinyals
et al., 2015; Gulcehre et al., 2016). Yuan et al.
(2017) also add an additional answer encoder
layer, and initialise the decoder with a hidden
state constructed from the final state of the en-
coder. Beam search (Graves, 2012) is used to sam-
ple from the model at inference time. We train
the model using maximum likelihood before fine
tuning. Our implementation achieves a BLEU-4
score (Papineni et al., 2002) of 13.5 on the test set
used by Du et al. (2017), before fine tuning.

Table 2: Changes in automatic evaluation metrics after models were fine tuned on various objectives. QA refers
to the F1 score obtained by a question answering system on the generated questions. LM refers to the perplexity
of generated questions under a separate language model. The discriminator reward refers to the percentage of
generated sequences that fooled the discriminator. Lower LM and NLL scores are better. BLEU scores decreased
in all cases.

3.2 Fine tuning
Generated questions should be formed of language
that is both fluent and relevant to the context and
answer. Following (Yuan et al., 2017), we per-
form fine tuning on a trained model, using rewards
given either by the negative perplexity under a
LSTM language model, or the F1 score attained by
a question answering (QA) system, or a weighted
combination of both. The language model is a
standard recurrent neural network formed of a sin-
gle LSTM layer. For the QA system, we use
QANet (Yu et al., 2018) as implemented by Kim
(2018).

3.3 Adversarial training
Additionally, we propose a novel approach by
learning the reward directly from the training data,
using a discriminator detailed in Appendix A. We
generate questions for each context-answer pair in
the training set using a generator trained by maxi-
mum likelihood, and train the discriminator to pre-
dict whether an input question was generated by
our model, or originated from the training data.
Keeping the discriminator fixed, we then fine-tune
the generator, using as reward the probability esti-

mated by the discriminator that a generated ques-
tion was in fact real. In other words, the gener-
ator is rewarded for successfully fooling the dis-
criminator. We also experiment with interleaving
updates to the discriminator within the fine tuning
phase, allowing the discriminator to become ad-
versarial and adapt alongside the generator.

The rewards described above are used to update
the model parameters via the REINFORCE policy
gradient algorithm (Williams, 1992). We teacher
force the decoder with the generated sequence to
reproduce the activations calculated during beam
search, to enable backpropagation. All rewards are
normalised with a simple form of PopArt (Hasselt
et al., 2016), with the running mean µR and stan-
dard deviation σR updated online during training.
We continue to apply a maximum likelihood train-
ing objective during this fine tuning.

3.4 Evaluation

We report the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the
test set under the different models, as well as the
corpus level BLEU-4 score (Papineni et al., 2002)
of the generated questions compared to the ground
truth. We also report the rewards achieved on the

test set, as the QA, LM and discriminator scores.
For the human evaluation, we follow the stan-

dard approach in evaluating machine translation
systems (Koehn and Monz, 2006), as used for
question generation by Du and Cardie (2018). We
ask three workers to rate 300 generated questions
between 1 (poor) and 5 (good) on two separate cri-
teria: the fluency of the language used, and the
relevance of the question to the context document
and answer.

4 Results

Table 2 shows the changes in automatic metrics for
models fine tuned on various combinations of re-
wards, compared to the model without tuning. In
all cases, the BLEU score reduces, as the training
objective is no longer closely coupled to the train-
ing data. In general, models achieve better scores
on the metrics on which they were fine tuned.
Jointly training on a QA and LM reward results
in better LM scores than training on only a LM
reward; the LM score did not increase smoothly
when used as the sole objective, and we believe
the additional QA reward acts as a form of regular-
isation. We conclude that fine tuning using policy
gradients can be used to attain higher rewards, as
expected.

Table 3 shows the human evaluation scores for
a subset of the fine tuned models. The model fine
tuned on a QA and LM objective is rated as signifi-
cantly worse by human annotators, despite achiev-
ing higher scores in the automatic metrics. In other
words, the training objective given by these reward
sources does not correspond to true question qual-
ity, despite them being intuitively good choices.

The model fine tuned using an adversarial dis-
criminator has also failed to achieve better human

ratings, with the discriminator model unable to
learn a useful reward source. Although the train-
ing process was stable and robust to different ini-
tialisations, and the outputs do not appear to be
significantly worse, we conclude that the discrim-
inator was unable to learn a sufficiently useful dis-
tinction between generated and real questions, and
the additional fine tuning procedure simply added
unwanted noise to the model predictions.

Table 1 shows an example where fine tuning has
not only failed to improve the quality of gener-
ated questions, but has caused the model to ex-
ploit the reward source. The model fine tuned on a
LM reward has degenerated into producing a loop
of words that is evidently deemed probable, while
the model trained on a QA reward has learned that
it can simply point at the location of the answer.
This observation is supported by the metrics; the
model fine tuned on a QA reward has suffered a
catastrophic worsening in LM score of +226.

Figure 1 shows the automatic scores against hu-
man ratings for all rated questions. The correla-
tion coefficient between human relevance and au-
tomatic QA scores was 0.439, and between flu-
ency and LM score was only 0.355. While the
automatic scores are good indicators of whether
a question will achieve the lowest human rating
or not, they do not differentiate clearly between
the higher ratings: training a model on these ob-
jectives will not necessarily learn to generate bet-
ter questions. A good question will likely attain a
high QA and LM score, but the inverse is not true;
a sequence may exploit the weaknesses of the met-
rics and achieve a high score despite being unintel-
ligible to a human. We conclude that fine tuning a
question generation model on these rewards does
not lead to better quality questions.



5 Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate the use of external
reward sources for fine tuning question genera-
tion models to counteract the lack of task-specific
training data. We show that although fine tuning
can be used to attain higher rewards, this does not
equate to better quality questions when rated by
humans. Using QA and LM rewards as a training
objective causes the generator to expose the weak-
nesses in these models, which in turn suggests a
possible use of this approach for generating adver-
sarial training examples for QA models. The QA
and LM scores are well correlated with human rat-
ings at the lower end of the scale, suggesting they
could successfully be used as part of a reranking
or filtering system. We plan to research overgen-
erating questions and using the reward signals to
rerank the outputs, thereby including the induc-
tive bias the rewards represent without allowing
the model to exploit them.

We use an architecture based on a modified
QANet as shown in Figure 2, replacing the out-
put layers of the model to produce a single proba-
bility. Since the discriminator is also able to con-
sider a full context-question-answer triple as input
(as opposed to a context-question pair for the QA
task), we fuse this information in the output layers.

Specifically, we apply max pooling over time to
the output of the first two encoders, and we took
the mean of the outputs of the third encoder that
formed part of the answer span. These three re-
duced encodings were concatenated, a 64 unit hid-
den layer with ReLU activation applied, and the
output passed through a single unit sigmoid output
layer to give the estimated probability that an input
context-question-answer triple originated from the
ground truth dataset or was generated.
