Abstract. To improve the search performance of retrieval methods using co-
citation linkages, this study proposes a technique to enlarge a co-citation net-
work by incorporating satellite documents. This technique specifies satellite 
documents via full-text searches for terms obtained from documents having co-
citation linkages with a seed document; the appropriateness of each co-citation 
linkage is checked by using the strength of the co-citation context based on the 
results of parsing documents that cite the seed document. This study evaluates 
search performance using the proposed technique with IR experiments. Specifi-
cally, the random walk with restart algorithm, which can compute similarities 
between the seed document and each document in the network, is applied to the 
enlarged and initial networks. Scores of the normalized discounted cumulative 
gain (nDCG@K) were then compared. The results indicate that the search per-
formance of the retrieval methods using the enlarged network outperforms 
those of a baseline method using the initial network.

1 INTRODUCTION 

In the field of scientific paper searches, citations are often used to measure implicit 
relationships between documents. One approach to improve the search performance 
of retrieval methods using citation linkages is to enlarge the citation networks by in-
corporating additional information. In the case of a network created using direct cita-
tion linkages, i.e., the linkages between the citing and cited documents, techniques to 
enlarge the network of citations on the basis of additional information, such as citing 
text [1] or user profiles [2], have been reported. 

This study enlarges the networks connected by co-citations. A co-citation is 
defined as a linkage between a pair of documents concurrently cited by a third docu-
ment. In the simplest retrieval method using co-citation, documents having a co-
citation relationship with a given seed document that are known to be relevant are 
presented to the user under the assumption that documents co-cited with such a seed 
document tend to be topically similar to the seed document. Co-citation networks 
have been used in bibliometrics and can also be applied to scientific paper searches 
(e.g., [3]).

This study proposes a technique to enlarge the co-citation network by adding 
word-based linkages. When documents are detected by the co-citation linkage, it is 
possible to obtain more appropriate search terms from the document; such terms may 
not have been included in the original seed document. A set of new search terms may 
yield additional relevant documents that were not identified simply by the co-citation 
linkages or the user‚Äôs original representation of his or her information needs. This 
study defines satellite documents as documents that are specified via full-text searches 
for new search terms. The purpose of the proposed technique is to incorporate these 
satellite documents into the initial network of documents, which is already connected 
by co-citation linkages. 

In addition, the proposed technique attempts to reduce noise satellite docu-
ments incorporated into the initial co-citation network using the co-citation context. 
Some studies (e.g., [3] and [4]) have reported that using the contexts of co-citations 
has positive effects for reducing noise documents when co-citation networks are en-
larged by additional co-citation linkages; therefore, it is feasible to use co-citation 
contexts when enlarging co-citation networks by adding word-based linkages. 

This study empirically evaluates the search performance of retrieval methods 
using the proposed technique with IR experiments. Specifically, the random walk 
with restart (RWR) algorithm [5], which can compute similarities between the seed 
document and each document in the network, is applied to enlarged networks and 
initial networks, and the results are compared by computing scores of the cutoff ver-
sion of the normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG@K). 

2 PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 

2.1 Specifying satellite documents 

Figure 1 shows an initial network comprising document nodes connected by undi-
rected co-citation linkages. In this network, a search query is a seed document that is 
known to be relevant to the information needs of a user. The weight of the edge, w, 
i.e., the strength of the co-citation linkage, is computed as 

w (ùëë1, ùëë2) = cociting (ùëë1, ùëë2). (1) 
Here, d1 and d2 are co-cited documents and cociting(d1, d2) denotes the total 

number of documents co-citing d1 and d2 in the target document set. Note that this 
study denotes a weighted edge between d1 and d2 as Edge (d1, d2, w).

The proposed technique specifies satellite documents by investigating docu-
ments one hop from the seed. This study defines host documents as source documents 
that are used to specify satellite documents. Using the title words of the host docu-
ment as a query, the satellite documents are specified on the basis of a standard full-
text search method; the seed document is excluded from the search target. For exam-
ple, in Figure 1, Document C1, a host document that is one hop from the seed, speci-
fies six satellite documents. In the experiments in this study, the tf-idf retrieval func-
tion of the Indri search engine, which has been developed as part of the Lemur Pro-
ject, was used. The top N documents ranked by this full-text search were adopted as 
satellite documents (e.g., N = 10). 

In addition, as an optional process, the proposed technique attempts to check 
the appropriateness of each host document as a source because inappropriate host 
documents may yield noise. To check appropriateness, this technique uses the 
strength of co-citation context (see e.g., [6] and [7]) identified by parsing the full-text 
of documents that cite the seed and each host. More specifically, this technique exam-
ines reference positions within the text and if references to both the document and the 
seed appear within a paragraph in one or more citing documents, the document is 
selected as a host document because a seed and host co-cited in a strong context are 
expected to be closely related. For example, in Figure 1, if one or more documents 
cite Documents A and C3 in the same paragraph, Document C3 would be selected as a 
host document. Conversely, if no documents cite them in the same paragraph, Docu-
ment C3 would not be selected as a host document. 

2.2 Incorporating satellite documents 

If a satellite document is new, a new node is created with an undirected edge of 
weight 1 connecting the new node to its host. When two host documents share a new 
satellite document, one new node and two edges between the new node and each host 
node are created. In Figure 1, Document T3 is specified by host Documents C1 and C3; 
therefore, a new node T3, Edge (T3, C1, 1), and Edge (T3, C3, 1) are created. In addi-
tion, if a new document has co-citation linkages with documents already existing in 
the initial network or with other new documents, new edges are created and weights 
are assigned using Eq. (1). 

When a satellite document already exists in a given network, the linkage be-
tween the satellite document and its host is used to create a new edge or recalculate 
the weight of a given edge. If the linkage is new for the network, an undirected edge 
of weight 1 is created between the satellite and its host. If the linkage already exists in 
the initial network, the weight of the existing edge is recalculated as 

w (ùëë1, ùëë2) = cociting (ùëë1, ùëë2) + 1. (2) 
Some new linkages may be duplicated in the specified results. In such cases, 

the proposed technique treats them as one combined link and creates one new edge. 
For example, in Figure 1, Document C1 has satellite document C3 and vice versa; 
therefore, only Edge (C1, C3, 1) is incorporated into the network.

2.3 Ranking the documents in the network 

To calculate document scores, the RWR algorithm is applied to the enlarged network. 
This algorithm iteratively investigates the entire network, and the similarity between a 
seed node and each node in the network is calculated (see, e.g., [3] and [8]). Specifi-
cally, the walker starts at a seed node and then either proceeds to the connected nodes 
on the basis of a probability calculated by weights or returns back to the seed node; 
these steps are repeated iteratively until convergence. The long-term visit rate of each 
node is used as a document score; these rates are given by the steady state of 

ùëù = (1 ‚àí ùëü)ÔøΩÃÉÔøΩùëù + ùëüùë†. (3) 
Here, ùëù is an n-dimensional vector (with n being the number of nodes in the 

network), ùë† is an n-dimensional vector with 1 for the seed node and 0 for the others, 
and r is a return probability. This study uses the following 11 values of r in the exper-
iments: 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.99. Also, ÔøΩÃÉÔøΩ is a transition 
probability matrix, and each transition probability between two nodes is the weight of 
an edge, which is normalized by the summation of the weights of the edges connected 
to the current node. In the case shown in Figure 1, the probability ‚ÄúA to C1‚Äù is 0.286 
given as 2/(2+3+2). Therefore, ÔøΩÃÉÔøΩ is an asymmetric matrix, i.e., one direction can be 
different from another direction, e.g., the probability ‚ÄúC1 to A‚Äù is not equal to 0.286.  

3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

As described in Section 2.1, the proposed technique has an optional process. There-
fore, this study evaluates the search performance of two retrieval methods. First, Pro-
posed (all) omits the optional process and simply identifies all documents one hop 
from the seed as host documents. Second, Proposed (context) selects host documents 
using the strength of the co-citation context. For both retrieval methods, the parameter 
N (i.e., the number of retrieved documents per host document) was set to 10 and 100. 
In addition, the study evaluates the search performance of a baseline method that 
applies the RWR algorithm only to the initial co-citation network. In this experiment, 
the three retrieval methods take up to two hops from the seed to create each initial co-
citation network; three or more hops are out of scope. 

To create a special test collection, the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central 
was used. The test collection was constructed by selecting approximately 152,000 
documents from the subset with the condition that the document had at least one cita-
tion linkage with a document in the subset. The test collection contained 100 seed 
documents that were randomly selected from all the documents under the condition 
that each seed document had co-citation linkages with 10 or more documents. 

In addition, this experiment adopted nDCG@K as a metric to evaluate the 
search performance (with K = 5, 10, 50, and 100). A document was considered rele-
vant depending on the degree to which it shared MeSH Descriptors with the target 
seed document. More specifically, the Jaccard coefficient (JC) was used, i.e., when 
nDCG was calculated, the experiment used a relevance score of 3 for documents 
whose JC was 0.3 or more, 2 for documents whose JC was 0.2‚Äì0.3, and 1 for docu-
ments whose JC was 0.1‚Äì0.2.

4 RESULTS 

Search runs for 100 seed documents were executed using each method. 

4.1 Evaluation of incorporated documents 

First, the experiment examined whether the newly incorporated documents were rele-
vant (see Figure 1). Table 1 shows the average number of relevant incorporated doc-
uments; a document is relevant if the JC is 0.1 or more. Further, Table 1 lists the av-
erage ratio of the relevant documents, which is the total number of relevant docu-
ments over 100 search runs divided by the total number of new documents over the 
100 search runs. 

As shown in the table, the numbers of relevant documents were relatively 
large. For example, Proposed (all) incorporated more than 50 new relevant docu-
ments per seed. Therefore, the proposed technique has the potential to improve the 
search performance. 

Further, the ratio of relevant documents for Proposed (context) was higher 
than that of Proposed (all). This result indicates that the checking process using the 
co-citation context tends to exclude inappropriate host documents.

4.2 Evaluation of the ranked retrieval results 

Table 2 shows the average scores of nDCG@K and the results of the paired t-test 
between the baseline method and each retrieval method using the proposed technique. 
Note that this table shows only the scores of the best results ranked by Eq. (3) using 
the aforementioned 11 different r-values.

In Table 2, the maximum scores of the five retrieval results at each K are 
shown in bold. These are the results of Proposed (context) and Proposed (all) with N 
= 100, with the paired t-tests showing statistically significant differences. Therefore, 
the retrieval methods using the proposed technique tended to outperform the baseline 
method. 

Furthermore, the scores of Proposed (context) were higher than those of the 
baseline method in all cases, with the paired t-tests indicating a statistically significant 
difference in most cases. Conversely, some scores of Proposed (all), i.e., with N = 10 
at K = 10 and with N = 100 at K = 5, were lower than those of the baseline method. 
This suggests that the checking process had a stable and positive impact on improving 
the search performance. 

5 CONCLUSION 

This study proposed a technique to enlarge co-citation networks by incorporating 
satellite documents in scientific paper searches. Retrieval methods using the proposed 
technique tended to outperform the baseline method, which was based on the initial 
co-citation network.
