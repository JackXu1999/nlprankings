Abstract

Mental illnesses such as depression and
anxiety are highly prevalent, and therapy
is increasingly being offered online. This
new setting is a departure from face-to-
face therapy, and offers both a challenge
and an opportunity – it is not yet known
what features or approaches are likely to
lead to successful outcomes in such a dif-
ferent medium, but online text-based ther-
apy provides large amounts of data for lin-
guistic analysis. We present an initial in-
vestigation into the application of compu-
tational linguistic techniques, such as topic
and sentiment modelling, to online ther-
apy for depression and anxiety. We find
that important measures such as symptom
severity can be predicted with compara-
ble accuracy to face-to-face data, using
general features such as discussion topic
and sentiment; however, measures of pa-
tient progress are captured only by finer-
grained lexical features, suggesting that
aspects of style or dialogue structure may
also be important.

1 Introduction

Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety
have been called “the biggest causes of misery
in Britain today” (Layard, 2012). The main av-
enue of treatment for such conditions is talking
therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
(CBT); however, there is far greater demand than
can currently be met, and currently only 25% of
sufferers in the UK receive treatment. Therapy is
therefore increasingly being delivered online: this

helps to improve access and reduce waiting times,
and is just as effective as standard therapy (Kessler
et al., 2009). However, this new online setting
provides a challenge of evaluation and optimisa-
tion (Hanley and Reynolds, 2009; Beattie et al.,
2009). Online therapy is a significant departure
from face-to-face therapy, and it is not yet known
exactly what features or approaches are likely to
lead to successful outcomes, or help identify neg-
ative outcomes such as risk to the patient or oth-
ers. Current methods (e.g. controlled studies) are
expensive and time-consuming; we need fast, ac-
curate methods to ensure treatment can be made
effective and efficient in this new context.

Professional communication varies widely
(McCabe et al., 2013b) and aspects of doctor-
patient interaction and language are known to
influence outcomes such as patient satisfaction,
treatment adherence and health status (Ong et
al., 1995; McCabe et al., 2013a). For therapists,
automated methods to analyse therapist-client
communication are of interest as there is little
known about how the quality of communication
influences patient outcome. Identifying patterns
of effective communication – both in terms
of what is spoken about and how it is spoken
about – would help guide training of therapists.
Moreover, it may assist in identifying successful
therapy and perhaps, more importantly, where
communication is not therapeutic and patients are
failing to improve. This may warrant a different or
more intensive therapeutic intervention. Applying
computational linguistic techniques to therapy
data could therefore offer potential to produce
tools which can aid clinicians in predicting out-
comes, diagnosing severity of symptoms and/or
evaluating progress. Recent work on spoken
therapy dialogue has shown promising results in a
range of mental health tasks, including diagnosis
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
depression (DeVault et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013),

and prediction of outcomes in schizophrenia
treatment (Howes et al., 2013).

Online therapy data provides a new challenge
– language and interaction styles differ to face-
to-face – but also an opportunity in the availabil-
ity of large amounts of text data without the need
for automatic speech recognition or manual tran-
scription. Here, we present an initial investiga-
tion into the application of computational linguis-
tic techniques to online therapy for depression and
anxiety. We find that important measures such as
symptom severity can be predicted with compara-
ble accuracy to face-to-face data, and that general
aspects such as discussion topic and sentiment are
useful predictors; and suggest some ways in which
techniques can be adapted for improved perfor-
mance in future.

2 Background

2.1 Computational analysis & mental health

Research into computer-based diagnosis in mental
health goes back at least to the 1960s – see (Over-
all and Hollister, 1964; Hirschfeld et al., 1974)
amongst others – but most systems rely on doctor-
or patient-reported data rather than naturally oc-
curring language. Much recent work similarly
uses self-reported clinical and socio-demographic
data, e.g. to predict treatment resistance in depres-
sion (Perlis, 2013). Some recent natural language
processing (NLP) research examines features of
the language used by patients when discussing
conditions or treatment, e.g. discovering topics
and opinions from online doctor ratings (Paul et
al., 2013) or social media (Paul and Drezde, 2011).

However, aspects of the communication dur-
ing treatment itself are also associated with pa-
tient outcomes (Ong et al., 1995). In the mental
health domain, recent work suggests that, for pa-
tients with schizophrenia both conversation struc-
ture (how communication proceeds in therapy),
and content (what is talked about), can affect out-
comes (McCabe et al., 2013a; John et al., under
review). NLP research has now begun to examine
both. Wallace et al. (2013) model speech acts to
characterise doctor-patient consultations on medi-
cation adherence; Angus et al. (2012) use unsuper-
vised topic models to visualise shared content in
clinical dialogue; Cretchley et al. (2010) use a sim-
ilar approach for a qualititative analysis of topic
and communication style between patients with
schizophrenia and carers. DeVault et al. (2013)

use features of speech, and Yu et al. (2013) mul-
timodal features, from video-mediated dialogue to
detect depression and PTSD with promising accu-
racies (0.66 to 0.74 depending on condition and
task). In face-to-face therapy for schizophrenia,
Howes et al. (2012; 2013) use a combination of
supervised and unsupervised approaches to pre-
dict a range of diagnostic and outcome measures,
including future adherence to treatment (accuracy
0.70); fine-grained lexical features gave reason-
able accuracy, with more general topic features
giving weaker prediction of some outcomes.

2.2 Topic modelling
One focus of research for mental health is there-
fore on methods for analysing content (what is
talked about). Traditional methods, while ef-
fective, involve time-consuming hand-coding of
data (Beattie et al., 2009; John et al., under re-
view); NLP techniques can reduce this require-
ment. Unsupervised probabilistic models (e.g. La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Blei et al. (2003)
and variants) have been widely applied to learn
topics (word distributions) from the data itself,
connecting words with similar meanings and even
distinguishing between uses of words with mul-
tiple meanings (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).
Such techniques have been applied successfully
to structured dialogue e.g. meetings and tuto-
rials (Purver et al., 2006; Eisenstein and Barzi-
lay, 2008), and more recently to dialogues in the
clinical domain (Cretchley et al., 2010; Howes et
al., 2013), with topics found to identify important
themes within therapy conversation such as medi-
cation, symptoms, family and social issues, and to
correlate with outcomes.

2.3 Sentiment and emotion analysis
One aspect of conversation process and style is
the affect or emotion present. NLP research has
generally approached this via the task of senti-
ment detection, distinguishing positive from neg-
ative (and sometimes neutral) stance (Pang and
Lee, 2008). Methods generally take either a
knowledge-rich approach (relying on e.g. dictio-
naries of sentiment-carrying words (Pennebaker
et al., 2007)), or a data-rich approach via (usu-
ally supervised) machine learning over datasets of
sentiment-carrying text (e.g. Socher et al. (2013)).
The former can provide deeper insights, but are
less robust in the face of unexpected vocabulary,
unusual or errorful spelling; the latter are more ro-

8



bust but require training from large datasets. Re-
cent research has attempted finer-grained distinc-
tions, e.g. detecting specific emotions such as
anger, surprise, fear etc; again, approaches can
be characterised as dictionary-based or machine-
learning-based (Chuang and Wu, 2004; Seol et al.,
2008; Purver and Battersby, 2012; De Choudhury
et al., 2012). The resulting sentiment or emotion
ratings have been widely used to determine as-
pects of personality and mental state in various do-
mains. In social media text, Quercia et al. (2011;
2012) found correlations between sentiment and
levels of popularity, influence and general well-
being; O’Connor et al. (2010) with measures of
public opinion. Closer to our application, Liakata
et al. (2012) show that these methods can be ap-
plied to analyse emotion in suicide notes.

2.4 Research questions
Here, similar to (DeVault et al., 2013; Howes et
al., 2013), our primary question is whether these
approaches can be usefully applied to diagnose
conditions and predict outcomes, but in a new
modality – online text-based therapy – which may
require different and/or more robust methods. In
addition, we would like to gain some insight into
which features of language and interaction might
be predictive, in order to help clinicians improve
therapeutic methods, and to assess how general
and transferable any model might be. Our main
questions here are therefore:

• What features of text-based online therapy di-
alogue might help predict symptoms and/or
outcomes? Specifically, how predictive are
conversation topic and emotional content?

• Can we detect them accurately and reli-
ably, using approaches generalisable to large
datasets, across different subjects and condi-
tions?

• Can the features provide any insights into the
treatment process and/or the online modality?

3 Method

3.1 Data
The data used in this study consisted of the tran-
scripts from 882 Cognitive Behavioural Ther-
apy (CBT) treatment dialogues between patients
with depression and/or anxiety and their ther-
apists using an online text-based chat system.
The transcripts are from online CBT provided

by Psychology Online, who deliver ‘live’ therapy
from a qualified psychologist accessed via the in-
ternet (http://www.psychologyonline.
co.uk). Of the 882 transcripts, 837 are between
therapists and patients who were in an ongoing
treatment program or had completed their treat-
ment by the time our sample was collected. There
are 167 patients in this sample (125 females and
42 males), with 35 different therapists (for 2 pa-
tients the identity of the therapist is unknown).
The number of transcripts per patient ranges from
1 to 14, with a mean of 5.011 (s.d. 2.73). For all
of the measures based on the transcripts, as out-
lined below, we included all text typed by both the
therapist and the patient. In addition to the tran-
scripts themselves, each patient normally filled out
two questionnaires prior to each session with their
therapist. These are described below.

3.2 Outcomes
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) This
is a self-administered diagnostic instrument for
common mental disorders (Kroenke and Spitzer,
2002). The PHQ-9 is the depression module,
which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ‘0’
(not at all) to ‘3’ (nearly every day). A higher
score indicates higher levels of depression, with
scores ranging from 0-27. It has been validated
for use (Martin et al., 2006).

Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7)
Similarly, the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a
brief self-report scale of generalised anxiety disor-
der. This is a 7-item scale which scores each of the
items as ‘0’ (not at all) to ‘3’ (nearly every day).
A higher score indicates higher levels of anxiety.

Outcome measures For the data in our sam-
ple, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were highly correlated
(r = 0.811, p < 0.001) so for the results re-
ported below we focus on PHQ-9. As each patient
filled in the PHQ-9 before each consultation, we
used two different outcome measures: PHQ now
– the PHQ-9 score of the patient for the question-
naire completed immediately prior to the consulta-
tion; and PHQ start-now – the difference between
the PHQ-9 score prior to any treatment and PHQ
now, i.e. a measure of progress (how much bet-
ter or worse the patient is since the start of their
treatment). Although these two measures are nu-
merical, one of the general aims of our research
is to identify patients at risk. We therefore bina-
rised the outcome measures and treated our task

9



as a categorisation problem to identify the group
of interest. For PHQ now, these were patients with
moderate to severe symptoms; for PHQ start-now,
patients whose PHQ score had not improved.

3.3 Topics

The transcripts from the 882 treatment consulta-
tions were analysed using an unsupervised proba-
bilistic topic model, using MALLET (McCallum,
2002) to apply standard Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (Blei et al., 2003), with the notion of docu-
ment corresponding to a single consultation ses-
sion, represented as the sequence of words typed
by any speaker. Stop words (common words
which do not contribute to the content, e.g. ‘the’,
‘to’) were removed as usual (Salton and McGill,
1986), but the word list had to be augmented for
text chat conventions and spellings (e.g. unpunc-
tuated “ive”). Additionally, common mispellings
were mapped to their correctly spelled equivalents
using Microsoft Excel’s in-built spellchecker. This
was due to the nature of text chat, in contrast to
transcribed speech or formal text – the word ‘ques-
tionnaire’, for example, was found to have been
typed in 21 different ways. Following (Howes et
al., 2013) we set the number of topics to 20,1 used
the default setting of 1000 Gibbs sampling itera-
tions, and enabled automatic hyperparameter opti-
misation to allow an uneven distribution of topics
via an asymmetric prior over the document-topic
distributions (Wallach et al., 2009).

As Howes et al. (2013) did in face-to-face ther-
apy, we found most topics were composed of co-
herent word lists, with many corresponding to
common themes in therapy e.g. family (Topic 12),
symptoms (16), treatment process (2, 14), and is-
sues in work and social life (19, 5) – see Table 5.

3.4 Sentiment and emotion analysis

Each turn in the transcripts was then annotated for
strength of positive and negative sentiment, and
level of anger. We compared three approaches: the
dictionary-based LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2007)
and two machine learning approaches, the Stan-
ford classifier based on deep neural nets and parse
structure trained on standard text (Socher et al.,
2013), and one based on distant supervision over
social media text, Sentimental (Purver and Bat-

domain.

tersby, 2012).2 None are specifically designed for
therapy dialogue data; however, given the unortho-
dox spelling and vocabulary used in text chat, we
expect machine-learning based approaches, and
training on “noisy” social media text, to provide
more robustness.

We used each to provide a posi-
tive/negative/neutral sentiment value; for LIWC,
we took this from the relative magnitudes of the
posemo and negemo categories. Two human
judges then rated the 85 utterances in one tran-
script independently. Inter-annotator agreement
was good, with Cohen’s kappa = 0.66. Agreement
with LIWC was poor (0.43-0.45); with Stanford
better (0.51-0.54); but best with Sentimental
(0.63-0.80). For anger, LIWC gave only one
utterance a non-zero rating, while Sentimental
provided a range of values. We therefore used
Sentimental in our experiments. Raw values
per turn were scaled to [-1,+1] for sentiment
(-1 representing strong negative sentiment, +1
strong positive), and [0,1] for anger; we then
derived minimum, maximum, mean and standard
deviation values per transcript.

3.5 Classification experiments

We performed a series of experiments, to inves-
tigate whether various features of the transcripts
could enable automatic detection of patient re-
sponses to the PHQ-9. The full range of possible
features were calculated for each transcript – see
Table 1. As well as topic, sentiment and emotion
features as detailed above, we include raw lexi-
cal features to characterise details of content, and
some high-level features (amount of talk; patient
demographics; and therapist identity, known to af-
fect outcomes).

In each case, we used the Weka machine learn-
ing toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) to pre-process
data, and a decision tree classifier (J48), a logis-
tic regression model and the support vector ma-
chine implementation LibLINEAR (Chang and
Lin, 2001) as classifiers. PHQ now was bina-
rised based on the classification in Kroenke and
Spitzer (2002), whereby scores of 10 or over are
moderate to severe and scores of less than 10 are
mild. PHQ start-now was binarised according to
whether there was an improvement (reduction) in
the PHQ score or not. Positive scores indicate

sets using 10-fold cross-validation.3

4 Results

4.1 Correlations

First, we examined statistical associations be-
tween our four outcome measures and our avail-
able features (see Section 3). R-values are shown
for all significant correlations (at the p < 0.05
level) in Tables 2-4. For the PHQ now measure,
a positive correlation means a greater value of the
feature is associated with a greater value of the
PHQ score (i.e. a higher level of symptoms). For
the PHQ start-now measures, a positive correla-
tion means that a greater value of the feature is as-
sociated with a greater improvement in the PHQ
score since the start of treatment. Correlations
greater than ±0.2 are shown in bold.

High-level With patients with a worse (higher)
PHQ score (PHQ now), more words and turns are
typed by both participants. Better overall progress
scores are also weakly associated with the amount
of talk, with fewer turns typed by both participants
if patients’ PHQ score has improved by a greater

3We partition the data into 10 equal subsamples, and use
each subsample as the test data for a model trained on the
remaining 90%. This is repeated for each subsample (the 10
folds), and the test predictions collated to give the overall re-
sults. This partitioning is done by transcript: different tran-
scripts from the same patient may therefore appear in training
and test data within the same fold; our use of low-dimensional
topic/sentiment features should minimise over-fitting, but fu-
ture work will investigate the extent of this effect.

amount since the start of their treatment program
(see Table 2).

Sentiment As shown in Table 3, more negative
sentiment expressed in the transcripts (mean and
minimum), a higher variability of sentiment be-
tween negative and positive (s.d.), and greater lev-
els of anger (mean and maximum) are associated
with worse PHQ scores. More positive sentiments
(mean and maximum) are also associated with bet-
ter progress.

Topic Topics 2, 6, 9, 10, 16 and 17 are neg-
atively correlated with PHQ scores, i.e. higher
levels of these topics are associated with better
PHQ (see Table 4). Some of these topics involve
words related to assessing the patient’s progress
and feedback, e.g. topic 2 includes session, goals
and questionnaires, and topic 17 includes good,
work and positive. Others relate to specific con-
cerns of the patient, e.g. topic 6 (worry, worrying
and problem) and topic 16 (anxiety, fear and sick).
The top twenty words assigned to each topic by
LDA, and the direction of significant correlations
are shown in Table 5.

Conversely, topics 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 18 are
positively correlated with PHQ scores, meaning
more talk assigned to these topics is associated
with worse PHQ. Several of these topics relate to
specific issues, such as topic 5 (sleep, bed, night)
and topic 18 (eating, food, weight). Some of these
topics display overlap with the previous group
(e.g. topics 2 and 4 both contain words reviewing
progress such as session, week, next and last); this
suggests that some topics (e.g. progress or particu-
lar issues) are discussed in importantly (and recog-
nisably) different ways or contexts (possibly dif-
ferent emotional valences – see below), and these
differences are being identified by the automatic
topic modelling.

Similarly, greater amounts of talk in topics 2, 15
and 17 are weakly associated with better progress.
These are the topics identified above as involving
words related to assessing progress, and feedback.
Greater amounts of talk in topic 8 (checking, OCD,
anxiety, rituals) is associated with worse progress.

Cross-correlations between topic and senti-
ment features Previous work has hypothesised
that automatically derived topics may differ from
hand-coded topics in picking up additional factors
of the communication such as valence (Howes et
al., 2013). To explore this on a global level (i.e.

Table 3: Significant correlations of sentiment features and outcomes

at the level of the transcript, rather than at the
finer-grained level of the turn) we examined cross-
correlations between sentiment and topic. This
initial exploration offers support for this hypoth-
esis, as can be seen in Table 6. For example, top-
ics 3 and 4 both contain words relating to feel-
ings and thoughts, but topic 3 is positively corre-
lated with sentiment, while topic 4 is negatively
correlated. These correlations indicate a complex
relationship between topic and sentiment which
should be explored further in future research; a
joint topic-sentiment model might be appropriate
e.g. (Paul et al., 2013). Although some topics
pattern consistently with sentiment (e.g. topic 12,
with words about relatives and relationships, is as-
sociated with negative sentiments and higher lev-
els of anger) some do not (e.g. topic 19 is asso-
ciated with more positive sentiment, but greater
anger). Examination suggests that this topic in-
volves discussions about feelings of anger, but not
necessarily expressing anger, and also may include
talk on how to deal with such feelings (with words
like assertive). These observations may indicate
that in this domain, in which people explicitly talk
about their feelings, fully accurate sentiment and
emotion analysis may require a different approach
than in domains such as social media analysis.

4.2 Classification experiments

Results of classification experiments on different
feature sets are shown in Tables 7-9. For each ex-
periment, the weighted average f-score is shown,
with the f-score for the class of interest shown
in brackets. For PHQ now the class of interest
is patients with high (moderate to severe) PHQ-9
scores; for PHQ start-now we are concerned with

patients who are not getting better. As a baseline,
the proportion of the data in the class of interest in
each case is shown in the first column in Table 7 –
note that these are not exactly 50%, but reflect the
actual proportions in the data (see Section 3.5).

High-level As can be seen in Table 7, if we use
a feature set consisting of high-level features and
AgentID, we are able to predict PHQ now and
PHQ start-now reasonably well (> 0.7). How-
ever, given the nature of the data, it is uncommon
for a therapist to have many clients of the same
age group and gender; these features can therefore
act as a reasonable proxy for identifying individ-
ual patients, meaning that this result is somewhat
spurious. Also, although identity of therapist is an
important factor in therapeutic outcomes (McCabe
et al., 2013a; McCabe et al., 2013b), we would
like to identify aspects of the communication that
explain why particular therapists are more success-
ful than others, and generalise our findings to new
therapists. AgentID was therefore removed in all
subsequent experiments.

Sentiment and topic As shown in Table 8, us-
ing the proportions of derived topics by transcript
as features does allow us to predict whether a pa-
tient has a high PHQ now score reasonably well;
but sentiment alone performs poorly. Combining
sentiment and topic features, however, allows us
to predict PHQ now with scores of around 0.7 (i.e.
approaching the accuracy achieved using high-
level and AgentID features above). Prediction of
the progress measure is less effective.

Words and n-grams For the symptom mea-
sure, using words and n-grams gives f-scores in

ing; one might expect finer-grained lexical fea-
tures (which provide more information via a much
higher-dimensional feature space) to increase pre-
dictivity, as per Howes et al. (2013); on the other
hand, it is also promising as it suggests that mean-
ingful generalisations can be drawn out of this data
using NLP techniques.

For the progress measure, on the other hand, n-
gram features perform better than topic/sentiment
(though not as well as on the symptom measures);
this suggests that there are aspects of the com-
munication that can assist in predicting patient
progress, but that they are not captured by the topic
and sentiment information as currently defined.
This suggests that dialogue structure or style may
play a role; one possibility for exploration is to
look at topic and/or sentiment at a finer-grained
level and examine their dynamics (e.g. are posi-

tive sentiments expressed near the start or end of a
consultation linked to better progress)?

5 Discussion

Standard topic, sentiment and emotion modelling
can be usefully applied to online text therapy dia-
logue, although care is needed choosing and ap-
plying a technique suitable for the idiosyncratic
language and spelling. The resulting information
allows us to predict aspects of symptom sever-
ity and patient progress with reasonable degrees
of accuracy (similar to those achieved with face-
to-face data (DeVault et al., 2013; Howes et al.,
2012)), without requiring knowledge of thera-
pist identity. However, some measures of patient
progress are predicted better with fine-grained,
high-dimensional lexical features, suggesting that
insight into style and/or dialogue structure is re-
quired, beyond simple topic or sentiment analysis.
