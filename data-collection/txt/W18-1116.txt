Abstract
The usage of part-of-day nouns, such as
‘night’, and their time-specific greetings
(‘good night’), varies across languages and
cultures. We show the possibilities that Twit-
ter offers for studying the semantics of these
terms and its variability between countries.
We mine a worldwide sample of multilingual
tweets with temporal greetings, and study how
their frequencies vary in relation with local
time. The results provide insights into the
semantics of these temporal expressions and
the cultural and sociological factors influenc-
ing their usage.

1 Introduction

Human languages are intertwined with their cul-
tures and societies, having evolved together, re-
flecting them and in turn shaping them (Otten-
heimer, 2013; Dediu et al., 2013). Part-of-day
nouns (e.g. ‘morning’ or ‘night’) are an exam-
ple of this, as their meaning depends on how each
language’s speakers organize their daily sched-
ule. For example, while the morning in English-
speaking countries is assumed to end at noon, the
Spanish term (‘mañana’) is understood to span un-
til lunch time, which normally takes place between
13:00 and 15:00 in Spain. It is fair to relate this
difference to cultural (lunch being the main meal
of the day in Spain, as opposed to countries like
the UK, and therefore being a milestone in the
daily timetable) and sociopolitical factors (the late
lunch time being influenced by work schedules
and the displacement of the Spanish time zones
with respect to solar time). Similar differences
have been noted for different pairs of languages
(Jäkel, 2003) and for cultures using the same lan-
guage (Sekyi-Baidoo and Koranteng, 2008), based
on manual study, field research and interviews
with natives. Work on automatically extracting
the semantics of part-of-day nouns is scarce, as

classic corpora are not timestamped. Reiter and
Sripada (2003); Sripada et al. (2003) overcome it
by analyzing weather forecasts and aligning them
to timestamped simulations, giving approximate
groundings for time-of-day nouns and showing id-
iolectal variation on the term ‘evening’, but the
work is limited to English.

The relation between language and sociocul-
tural factors implies that the semantics of part-of-
day nouns (e.g. ’end of the morning’) cannot be
studied in isolation from social habits (e.g. ’typi-
cal lunch time’). A relevant study of such habits
is done by Walch et al. (2016), who develop an
app to collect sleep habits from users worldwide.
While they do not study the meaning of words,
their insights are used for validation.

We propose a new approach to study the se-
mantics of part-of-day nouns by exploiting Twitter
and the time-specific greetings (e.g. ‘good morn-
ing’) used in different cultures. By mining tweets
with these greetings, we obtain a large, worldwide
sample of their usage. Since many tweets come
with time and geolocation metadata, we can know
the local time and country at which each one was
emitted. The main contribution of the paper is to
show how it is possible to learn the semantics of
these terms in a much more extensive way than
previous work, at a global scale, with less effort
and allowing statistical testing of differences in us-
age between terms, countries and languages.

2 Materials and methods

To ground the semantics of greetings we used 5
terms as seeds: ‘good morning’, ‘good afternoon’,
‘good evening’, ‘good night’ and ‘hello’ (a time-
unspecific greeting used for comparison). We
translated them to 53 languages and variants using
Bing translator.1 We use italics to refer to greet-

ings irrespective of the language. 172,802,620
tweets were collected from Sept. 2 to Dec. 7 2016.

For some languages (e.g. Spanish), there is no
differentiation between ‘good evening’ and ‘good
night’, and they both are translated to the same ex-
pression. For some others, some expressions can-
not be considered equivalent, e.g. ‘good morning’
is translated to ‘bonjour’ in French, which is how-
ever commonly used as ‘hello’, or simply as ‘good
day’.

Text preprocessing is not necessary: we rely
on metadata, not on the tweet itself, and only
the seed words are needed to categorize tweets
within a part of day. To clean up the data, we
removed retweets, as they last for hours, bias-
ing the temporal analysis. Duplicate tweets were
kept, as similar messages from different days and
users (e.g. ‘good night!’) are needed for the
task at hand. Tweets need to be associated with a
timestamp and country-level geolocation. Tweets
have a creation time, composed of a UTC time
and a UTC offset that varies depending on the
time zone. However, most tweets are not geolo-
cated and we must rely on the data provided by
the user. This may be fake or incomplete, e.g.
specifying only a village. We used fine-grained
databases2 to do the mapping to the country level
location and performed a sanity check, compar-
ing the Twitter offset to the valid set of offsets for
that country3, to reduce the amount of wrongly ge-
olocated tweets.4 Comparing the solar and stan-
dard time could provide more insights, but this
requires a fine-grained geolocation of the tweets.
We obtained a dataset of 10,523,349 elements,
available at https://github.com/aghie/
peoples2018_grounding: 4,503,077 good
morning’s, 599,586 good afternoon’s, 214,231
good evening’s, 880,003 good night’s and
4,359,797 hello’s.5

3 Results and validation

Given a country, some of the tweets are written
in foreign languages for reasons like tourism or
immigration. This paper refers to tweets written
in official or de facto languages, unless otherwise
specified. Also, analyzing differences according

unfeasible with a large amount of tweets.
5The dataset does not contain tweets from the first two

weeks of October due to logistic issues.

to criteria such as gender or solar time can be rel-
evant. As determining the impact of all those is
a challenge on its own, we focus on the primary
research question: can we learn semantics of the
part-of-day nouns from simple analysis of tweets?
To verify data quality, good morning tweets were
revised: out of 1 000 random tweets from the USA,
97.9% were legitimate greetings and among the
rest, some reflected somehow that the user just
started the day (e.g ‘Didn’t get any good morning
SMS’). We did the same for Spain (98,1% legiti-
mate), Brazil (97.8%) and India (99.6%).

Existing work and dated events are used to rat-
ify the results presented below.

Figure 1: Average day time for the greeting good morning in different countries (USA, Brazil, Spain and India)
for a period from mid October to early December, 2016. Weekends are shaded in gray.

Asian, African and American countries tend to
begin the day earlier than Europe (with excep-
tions, e.g. Germany). The table reflects that coun-
tries in southern Europe (e.g. Spain, Portugal or
Greece) start the day later than the northern ones
(the Netherlands or UK). For some countries, e.g.
France, this information is known to be biased, as
good morning (‘bonjour’) is used all along the day.
A validation at a fine-grained scale is unfeasible,
but the results at the country level are in line with
Figure 3 of Walch et al. (2016), e.g., they state that
Japan, the USA or Germany have earlier wake up
times than Spain, Brazil or Turkey.

The average greeting times for good afternoon
reveal insights that may stem from cultural differ-
ences (e.g. lunch break time). Anglo-Saxon and
South Asian countries have the earliest afternoon
(with averages between 13:00 and 14:00), while in
Mediterranean countries the morning lasts longer
(average greeting times for good afternoon around
15:00 or 16:00). A number of countries under
the influence of the United Kingdom, such as the
United States, Pakistan or India show earlier af-
ternoon times. The opposite happens in South
America, historically influenced by Portuguese
and Spanish colonialism during the Early modern
period, which exhibits later afternoon times.

This poses interesting questions for future work,

such as whether there is a particular reason that
could justify this behavior, like having more simi-
lar cuisine practices. In this context, the adoption
of food practices in colonialism has been already
studied by anthropologists and historians (Earle,
2010). Trigg (2004) points out how in the early
period of the Spanish colonialism in the Ameri-
cas, they ‘civilized’ the Indigenous community by
making them adopt manners, dress and customs.
She points that the role of food was specially rel-
evant due to its large social component, and was
not limited to the way the food was eaten, but also
prepared, served and consumed.

Twitter also reflects differences between coun-
tries regarding night life. On the one hand, Anglo-
Saxon countries wish good night earlier (from
19:49 in the UK to 21:10 in Canada) than other
societies. On the other hand, southern European
countries go to bed later, and some of them even
wish a good night after midnight (e.g. Spain).
Comparing to Walch et al. (2016), we find simi-
lar tendencies. For example, in their study Spain,
Turkey or Brazil use the smartphone until later
than Canada, the USA or the UK, and therefore
they go later to bed. Our Twitter approach also
captures the particular case of Japanese mentioned
by Walch et al.: they wake up very early, but use
the smartphone until late in the night, suggesting a

125



later bed time.
A fine-grained analysis shows how Twitter cap-

tures other cultural and working differences. Fig-
ure 1 charts the average day time for good morning
for the USA, Brazil, Spain and India during part of
the polling period. The time peaks in the week-
ends for many of the countries, showing that Twit-
ter captures how business and work are reduced
during holidays, resulting in later wake up times.

However, this is not visible in some countries
where working conditions are sometimes ques-
tioned (Mosse et al., 2002): for India the weekend
peak is less pronounced, which can be considered
as an indicator that a significant part of its popula-
tion does not enjoy work-free weekends.

The usage of part-of-day expressions can be
helpful to understand more complex issues, such
as how foreigners integrate into a country and
adapt to its daily schedule. We take the USA as
example, as it has a large foreign community of
Spanish speakers, mainly from Mexico (and in
a smaller proportion from other Latin American
countries). If we calculate the average day time
for the Spanish form of ‘good morning’ (‘buenos
dı́as’) in the USA, we obtain that the result is 08:09,
while the corresponding English greeting’s aver-
age time is 08:33. This is reinforced by Figure 2,
where ‘buenos dı́as’ average day time is consis-
tently lower than ‘good morning’.8 This would be
in line to their presence in low-wage jobs that re-
quire to wake up earlier, e.g. waiter, cleaning or
construction work (Flippen, 2012; Liu, 2013).

It is worth noting that, assuming that these
‘buenos dı́as’ greetings come from latinos, those
in the USA wake up even earlier than in their coun-
tries of origin (see Table 1).

Figure 1 also shows how national holidays in-
fluence societies. For example, Nov. 2 (Day of
the Dead) and Nov. 15 (Proclamation of the Re-
public) are holidays in Brazil, producing a peak in
that country’s graph similar to the behavior in the
weekends. Similarly, Nov. 1 (All Saints’ Day) and
Dec. 6 (Constitution Day) are holidays in Spain
and similar peaks are observed too. From Figure 2
we can see how Thanksgiving (Nov. 24 in 2016)
reflects a four-day weekend in the USA: many
businesses allow employees to take this holiday
from Thursday, resulting into a gradual and in-
creasing peak that spans until Sunday. This is cap-

8The peak occurring on 29th October for the Spanish
tweets is due to a case of spam that could not be avoided
according to the procedure described in §2.

Spanish ones. The day after the USA 2016 elec-
tions (Nov. 9), a valley occurs on the good morn-
ing time for the States (Figure 1). The winner was
not known until 03:00, suggesting that the dis-
tribution of greetings reflects social behaviors in
other special events.

3.2 Daily analysis

Twitter can be used to do a time-of-day analy-
sis, e.g., as said in §3.1, ‘bonjour’ is assumed to
be used all along the day. To test this, we take
Canada, where French and English are official lan-
guages. Figure 3 shows how ‘bonjour’ and ‘salut’
(‘hello’) are used all along the day, while ‘good
morning’ is used in the morning hours. English
and French hello’s share a similar distribution.

Figure 4 shows a greeting area chart for the
USA, showing how ‘good evening’ and ‘good af-
ternoon’ are well differentiated, with the transition
happening over 16:30. This contrasts to countries
such as Spain (Figure 5), where the language has

126



a single word (‘tarde’) for ‘evening’ and ‘after-
noon’, whose greeting spans from over 14:00, as
the morning ends late (see §1), to 21:00.

Area plots like these give a clear picture of the
semantics of part-of-day nouns, as they depict the
exact times when they are used. The precise se-
mantics can be grounded more rigorously using
statistical testing to know the exact time intervals
at which people significantly use a specific greet-
ing.

For example, to know when to switch from good
morning to good afternoon in Spanish, we can: (1)
group the number of ‘buenos dı́as’ (‘good morn-
ing’) and ‘buenas tardes’ (‘good afternoon’) by in-

tervals of 10 minutes, and (2) apply a binomial test
to each interval, to determine if one of the greet-
ings is significantly more likely to occur than the
other (assuming equal probability of occurrence).
For example, for Spain, we obtain that the morn-
ing ends at 14:00 (p-value=2 × 10−8 at 14:00,
0.09 at 14:10) and the afternoon starts at 14:40 (p-
value becomes statistically significant again with
4 × 10−7, showing a significant majority of good
afternoon).

4 Conclusion

We crawled Twitter to study the semantics of
part-of-day nouns in different countries and so-
cieties, showed examples from the polled pe-
riod and ratified them against existing research
and dated events. For space reasons we can-
not show insights for all scenarios, but full re-
sults are at https://github.com/aghie/
