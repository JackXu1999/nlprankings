Abstract

In this work, we investigate the task of tex-
tual response generation in a multimodal
task-oriented dialogue system. Our work
is based on the recently released Mul-
timodal Dialogue (MMD) dataset (Saha
et al., 2017) in the fashion domain. We
introduce a multimodal extension to the
Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder
(HRED) model and show that this exten-
sion outperforms strong baselines in terms
of text-based similarity metrics. We also
showcase the shortcomings of current vi-
sion and language models by performing
an error analysis on our system’s output.

1 Introduction

This work aims to learn strategies for textual re-
sponse generation in a multimodal conversation
directly from data. Conversational AI has great
potential for online retail: It greatly enhances user
experience and in turn directly affects user reten-
tion (Chai et al., 2000), especially if the interaction
is multi-modal in nature. So far, most conversa-
tional agents are uni-modal – ranging from open-
domain conversation (Ram et al., 2018; Papaioan-
nou et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2017) to task ori-
ented dialogue systems (Rieser and Lemon, 2010,
2011; Young et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2000; Wen
et al., 2016). While recent progress in deep learn-
ing has unified research at the intersection of vi-
sion and language, the availability of open-source
multimodal dialogue datasets still remains a bot-
tleneck.

This research makes use of a recently released
Multimodal Dialogue (MMD) dataset (Saha et al.,
2017), which contains multiple dialogue sessions
in the fashion domain. The MMD dataset provides
an interesting new challenge, combining recent ef-

forts on task-oriented dialogue systems, as well as
visually grounded dialogue. In contrast to sim-
ple QA tasks in visually grounded dialogue, e.g.
(Antol et al., 2015), it contains conversations with
a clear end-goal. However, in contrast to previ-
ous slot-filling dialogue systems, e.g. (Rieser and
Lemon, 2011; Young et al., 2013), it heavily relies
on the extra visual modality to drive the conversa-
tion forward (see Figure 1).

In the following, we propose a fully data-driven
response generation model for this task. Our work
is able to ground the system’s textual response
with language and images by learning the seman-
tic correspondence between them while modelling
long-term dialogue context.

Figure 1: Example of a user-agent interaction in
the fashion domain. In this work, we are inter-
ested in the textual response generation for a user
query. Both user query and agent response can be
multimodal in nature.

2 Model: Multimodal HRED over
multiple images

Our model is an extension of the recently intro-
duced Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder Decoder
(HRED) architecture (Serban et al., 2016, 2017;



130

Lu et al., 2016). In contrast to standard sequence-
to-sequence models (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever
et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), HREDs model
the dialogue context by introducing a context Re-
current Neural Network (RNN) over the encoder
RNN, thus forming a hierarchical encoder.

We build on top of the HRED architecture to
include multimodality over multiple images. A
simple HRED consists of three RNN modules: en-
coder, context and decoder. In multimodal HRED,
we combine the output representations from the
utterance encoder with concatenated multiple im-
age representations and pass them as input to the
context encoder (see Figure 2). A dialogue is mod-
elled as a sequence of utterances (turns), which in
turn are modelled as sequences of words and im-
ages. Formally, a dialogue is generated according
to the following:

Pθ(t1, . . . tN ) =

N∏
n=1

Pθ(tn|t<n) (1)

where tn is the n-th utterance in a dialogue. For
each m = 1, . . . ,Mn, we have hidden states of
each module defined as:

htextn,m = f
text
θ (h

text
n,m−1, wm,n) (2)

himgn = l
img([gencθ (img1), . . . g

enc
θ (imgk)]) (3)

hcxtn = f
cxt
θ (h

cxt
n−1, [h

text
n,Mn , h

img
n ]) (4)

hdecn,m = f
dec
θ (h

dec
n,m−1, wn,m, h

cxt
n−1) (5)

htextn,0 = 0; h
cxt
0 = 0; h

dec
n,0 = h

cxt
N (6)

where f textθ ,f
cxt
θ and f

dec
θ are GRU cells (Cho

et al., 2014). θ represent model parameters, wn,m
is the m-th word in the n-th utterance and gencθ
is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); here
we use VGGnet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014).
We pass multiple images in a context through the
CNN in order to get encoded image representa-
tions gencθ (imgk). Then these are combined to-
gether and passed through a linear layer limg to get
the aggregated image representation for one turn
of context, denoted by himgn above. The textual
representation htextn,Mn is given by the encoder RNN
f textθ . Both h

text
n,Mn

and himgn are subsequently
concatenated and passed as input to the context
RNN. hcxtN , the final hidden state of the context
RNN, acts as the initial hidden state of the decoder
RNN. Finally, output is generated by passing hdecn,m
through an affine transformation followed by a
softmax activation. The model is trained using

cross entropy on next-word prediction. During
generation, the decoder conditions on the previous
output token.

Saha et al. (2017) propose a similar baseline
model for the MMD dataset, extending HREDs to
include the visual modality. However, for simplic-
ity’s sake, they ‘unroll’ multiple images in a sin-
gle utterance to include only one image per utter-
ance. While computationally leaner, this approach
ultimately loses the objective of capturing multi-
modality over the context of multiple images and
text. In contrast, we combine all the image rep-
resentations in the utterance using a linear layer.
We argue that modelling all images is necessary to
answer questions that address previous agent re-
sponses. For example in Figure 3, when the user
asks “what about the 4th image?”, it is impossi-
ble to give a correct response without reasoning
over all images in the previous response. In the
following, we empirically show that our extension
leads to better results in terms of text-based sim-
ilarity measures, as well as quality of generated
dialogues.

you in knit | Show me something similar to the 4th image but with the
material different

Figure 3: Example contexts for a given system ut-
terance; note the difference in our approach from
Saha et al. (2017) when extracting the training data
from the original chat logs. For simplicity, in this
illustration we consider a context size of 2 previ-
ous utterances. ‘|’ differentiates turns for a given
context. We concatenate the representation vec-
tor of all images in one turn of a dialogue to form
the image context. If there is no image in the utter-
ance, we consider a 04096 vector to form the image
context. In this work, we focus only on the textual
response of the agent.

Figure 2: The Multimodal HRED architecture consists of four modules: utterance encoder, image en-
coder, context encoder and decoder. While Saha et al. (2017) ‘rollout’ images to encode only one image
per context, we concatenate all the ‘local’ representations to form a ‘global’ image representation per
turn. Next, we concatenate the encoded text representation and finally everything gets fed to the context
encoder.

3 Experiments and Results

3.1 Dataset

The MMD dataset (Saha et al., 2017) consists
of 100/11/11k train/validation/test chat sessions
comprising 3.5M context-response pairs for the
model. Each session contains an average of 40
dialogue turns (average of 8 words per textual re-
sponse, 4 images per image response). The data
contains complex user queries, which pose new
challenges for multimodal, task-based dialogue,
such as quantitative inference (sorting, counting
and filtering): “Show me more images of the 3rd
product in some different directions”, inference
using domain knowledge and long term context:
“Will the 5th result go well with a large sized mes-
senger bag?”, inference over aggregate of images:
“List more in the upper material of the 5th image
and style as the 3rd and the 5th”, co-reference res-
olution. Note that we started with the raw tran-
scripts of dialogue sessions to create our own ver-
sion of the dataset for the model. This is done
since the authors originally consider each image as
a different context, while we consider all the im-
ages in a single turn as one concatenated context
(cf. Figure 3).

3.2 Implementation
We use the PyTorch1 framework (Paszke et al.,
2017) for our implementation.2 We used 512
as the word embedding size as well as hidden
dimension for all the RNNs using GRUs (Cho
et al., 2014) with tied embeddings for the (bi-
directional) encoder and decoder. The decoder
uses Luong-style attention mechanism (Luong
et al., 2015) with input feeding. We trained our
model with the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015), with a learning rate of 0.0004 and clipping
gradient norm over 5. We perform early stopping
by monitoring validation loss. For image repre-
sentations, we use the FC6 layer representations
of the VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014),
pre-trained on ImageNet.3

3.3 Analysis and Results
We report sentence-level BLEU-4 (Papineni et al.,
2002), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) and
ROUGE-L (Lin and Och, 2004) using the evalu-
ation scripts provided by (Sharma et al., 2017).

such as ResNet or DenseNet and fine tune the image encoder
jointly, during the training of the model.

textual responses. Our model predictions are shown in blue while the true gold target in red. We are
showing only the previous user utterance for brevity’s sake.

We compare our results against Saha et al. (2017)
by using their code and data-generation scripts.4

Note that the results reported in their paper are on
a different version of the corpus, hence not directly
comparable.

Table 1: Sentence-level BLEU-4, METEOR and
ROUGE-L results for the response generation
task on the MMD corpus. “Cxt” represents con-
text size considered by the model. Our best per-
forming model is M-HRED–attn over a context of
5 turns. *Saha et al. has been trained on a different
version of the dataset.

Table 1 provides results for different configura-
tions of our model (“T” stands for text-only in the
encoder, “M” for multimodal, and “attn” for using
attention in the decoder). We experimented with
different context sizes and found that output qual-
ity improved with increased context size (mod-
els with 5-turn context perform better than those
with a 2-turn context), confirming the observation
by Serban et al. (2016, 2017).5 Using attention
clearly helps: even T-HRED–attn outperforms M-
HRED (without attention) for the same context
size. We also tested whether multimodal input
has an impact on the generated outputs. However,
there was only a slight increase in BLEU score
(M-HRED–attn vs T-HRED–attn).

5Using pairwise bootstrap resampling test (Koehn, 2004),
we confirmed that the difference of M-HRED-attn (5) vs. M-
HRED-attn (2) is statistically significant at 95% confidence
level.

To summarize, our best performing model (M-
HRED–attn) outperforms the model of Saha et al.
by 7 BLEU points.6 This can be primarily at-
tributed to the way we created the input for our
model from raw chat logs, as well as incorporat-
ing more information during decoding via atten-
tion. Figure 4 provides example output utterances
using M-HRED–attn with a context size of 5. Our
model is able to accurately map the response to
previous textual context turns as shown in (a) and
(c). In (c), it is able to capture that the user is ask-
ing about the style in the 1st and 2nd image. (d)
shows an example where our model is able to re-
late that the corresponding product is ‘jeans’ from
visual features, while it is not able to model fine-
grained details like in (b) that the style is ‘casual
fit’ but resorts to ‘woven’.

4 Conclusion and Future Work

In this research, we address the novel task of
response generation in search-based multimodal
dialogue by learning from the recently released
Multimodal Dialogue (MMD) dataset (Saha et al.,
2017). We introduce a novel extension to the
Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED)
model (Serban et al., 2016) and show that our im-
plementation significantly outperforms the model
of Saha et al. (2017) by modelling the full multi-
modal context. Contrary to their results, our gen-
eration outputs improved by adding attention and
increasing context size. However, we also show
that multimodal HRED does not improve signif-
icantly over text-only HRED, similar to observa-
tions by Agrawal et al. (2016) and Qian et al.
(2018). Our model learns to handle textual cor-
respondence between the questions and answers,
while mostly ignoring the visual context. This in-
dicates that we need better visual models to en-

6The difference is statistically significant at 95% confi-
dence level according to the pairwise bootstrap resampling
test (Koehn, 2004).

code the image representations when he have mul-
tiple similar-looking images, e.g., black hats in
Figure 3. We believe that the results should im-
prove with a jointly trained or fine-tuned CNN for
generating the image representations, which we
plan to implement in future work.
