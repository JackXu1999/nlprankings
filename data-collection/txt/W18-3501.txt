Abstract

The aim of this paper is to introduce
the Sociolinguistic Corpus of WhatsApp
Chats in Spanish among College Students,
a corpus of raw data for general use, which
was collected in Mexico City in the second
half of 2017. This with the purpose of of-
fering data for the study of the singularities
of language and interactions via Instant
Messaging (IM) among bachelors. This
article consists of an overview of both the
corpus’s content and demographic meta-
data. Furthermore, it presents the cur-
rent research being conducted with it
—namely parenthetical expressions, oral-
ity traits, and code-switching. This work
also includes a brief outline of similar cor-
pora and recent studies in the field of IM,
which shows the pertinence of the corpus
and serves as a guideline for possible re-
search.

1 Introduction

As digital communication technologies grow
and spread, computer mediated communication
(CMC) (Baron, 1984) —which includes (IM)—
changes and becomes a very distinct sort of in-
teraction. According to Álvarez (2011), a new
discourse level emerges through such interaction
—one that makes the distinction between writing
and speaking less and less clear. This discourse
style has been previously called both spoken writ-
ing (Blanco Rodrı́guez, 2002) and oralized text
(Yus Ramos, 2010).

In order to study such a particular register, it is
necessary to gather a robust corpus. The Sociolin-
guistic Corpus of WhatsApp Chats in Spanish for
College Speech Analysis intends to be a resource

that allows researchers to explore and characterize
conversations held by college students and their
peers, or other kind of participants, via the IM
application known as WhatsApp (hereafter WA).
This corpus is limited to bachelors studying at
Ciudad Universitaria (commonly known as C.U.),
the main campus of the National Autonomous
University of Mexico (UNAM). The reason for
choosing bachelors is because, in Mexico, 94.1%
of the population with an undergraduate degree
or a higher educational level uses the Internet for
communication purposes, this mainly via IM, and
generally they access the net on a smartphone.
Furthermore, most of IM users are 12 to 34 years
old, which is the age group the majority of college
students belong to (INEGI, 2016).

2 State of the Art

2.1 Similar Corpora
Prior to the collection of WA corpora, other
databases were created to allow the study of CMC.
Examples of said data are the NPS Internet Chat-
room Conversations Corpus (Forsyth et al., 2010),
an annotated corpus of interactions in English in
diverse chatrooms, and the Dortmunder Chat Cor-
pus (Beisswenger, 2013), a robust, annotated cor-
pus in German divided in 4 subcorpora, based on
the topic of the chats (free time, learning contexts,
cosultations, and media). In addition to these cor-
pora, it is worth mentioning the NUS SMS Corpus
(Chen and Kan, 2013) which comprises 71,000
messages, both in English and Chinese. Even
though the SMS is not an internet-mediated mean
of communication, it can be compared to interac-
tions via WA.

Although the study of WA chats is a relatively
novel research field, there are several corpora spe-
cialized mostly on them. One of the most impor-



2

tant projects is the one conducted by researchers
of the Universities of Zurich, Bern, Neuchâtel
and Leipzig. The What’s up, Switzerland? cor-
pus (Stark et al., 2014-) has as main aim the
characterization of WA chats and the compari-
son of these to SMS. It has 617 chats written by
1,538 participants. Since just 945 of them con-
sented to have their chats used, the total num-
ber of messages available for linguistic research
is 763,650 comprising 5,543,692 tokens. Only
426 participants shared further demographic in-
formation (Überwasser and Stark, 2017). Given
the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country,
46% of the corpus is in German, 34% in French,
14% in Italian, 3% in Romansh and 3% in English.
The sociodemographic information saved as meta-
data comprises age, gender, educational level, and
place of residence divided in 9 regions. So far, the
publications derived from this project focus not
only on the different levels of language, but also
the role of complementary items in conversation,
such as images, acronyms, emojis, emoticons, and
combination or modification of characters.

Verheijen and Stoop (2016) compiled a corpus
which is a part of the SoNaR project (STEVIN
Nederlandstalig Referentiecorpus) of posts and
WA chats in Dutch. The corpus has 332,657 words
in 15 chats donated by 34 informants. Their meta-
data encompasses informants’ name, birth place
and date, age, gende, educational level, and place
in which the chats were sent. This corpus was
used as one of the bases for a research where WA
and other written forms were compared (Verhei-
jen, 2017).

Hilte et al. (2017) compiled a corpus of chats
between Flemish teenagers aged 13-20 taken from
Facebook Messenger, WA, and iMessage. This,
with the purpose of identifying the impact of so-
cial variables —namely age, gender and educa-
tion— in teenagers’ non-standard use of language
in CMC.

In addition to these, an ongoing project is that
of MoCoDa2 conducted by Beisswenger et al.
(2017), which is a continuation of the preceeding
corpus MoCoDa, and has put together 2,198 inter-
actions with 19,161 user posts.

Nevertheless, all of these authors did not define
what they conceive as a chat. In order to avoid any
misconception, in the making of this corpus we
consider a chat an exchange between two users re-
gardless of length or date. Meaning that it does not

matter when the conversation started, but rather
the wholeness of the txt file.

Although there are, indeed, corpora of WA
chats in Spanish, they are not for general use, but
project-related. Besides, they are not as robust as
the aforementioned. Said corpora are presented in
the following section.

2.2 Research on WhatsApp Chats
Because of their peculiarities, virtual interactions
through diverse platforms like WA, WeChat, Face-
book Messenger, and so forth have drawn the at-
tention of linguists. Some of the previous studies
that have been conducted using similar corpora are
varied in the topics they approach. Some of the
aspects of language that can be studied with so-
ciolinguistic corpora like ours are discourse units
and phenomena such as turns and turntaking,
speech acts, and interactions (Bani-Khair et al.,
2016; Martı́n Gascueña, 2016; Alcántara Plá,
2014; Garcı́a Arriola, 2014); linguistic variation
from a diaphasic, diastratic or diatopic point of
view (Pérez Sabater, 2015; Sánchez-Moya and
Cruz-Moya, 2015); multimodal communication
(verbal, iconic or hybrid) (Sánchez-Moya and
Cruz-Moya, 2015); use of orthotypographic ele-
ments (Vázquez-Cano et al., 2015); the role of
the so-called emojis in communication (Sampi-
etro, 2016b,a; Dürscheid and Siever, 2017); and
even the didactic use of IM for digital and linguis-
tic competence (Gómez del Castillo, 2017).

Another phenomenon that has proved itself to
be interesting is code-switching in IM (Nurhami-
dah, 2017; Zaehres, 2016; Zagoricnik, 2014).
As Al-Emran and Al-Qaysi (2013) have stated
“WhatsApp is found to be the most social net-
working App used for code-switching by both stu-
dents and educators”; which is why authors like
Elsayed (2014) have focused on such population.

3 Methodology

3.1 Sociolinguistic Variables in the Corpus
Considering this is a sociolinguistic corpus, sev-
eral sociodemographic variables were defined as
metadata and divided into two groups:

(a) Balance axes, which are the two variables
that help to keep the balance and represen-
tativeness of the corpus:

• Sex: male or female 1
1We chose sex over gender because it is the sociodemo-



3

• Faculty students are enrolled in: Ar-
chitecture, Sciences, Political and So-
cial Sciences, Accounting and Adminis-
tration, Law, Economy, Philosophy and
Literature, Engineering, Medicine, Vet-
erinary Medicine, Odontology, Psychol-
ogy, Chemistry, and the National School
of Social Work.

Our goal was to collect at least 1% of the
campus’s population maintaining the same
proportion of men and women as in each fac-
ulty.

(b) Post-stratification criteria, whose relevance
will depend on the type of study conducted
with this corpus as main data: age, (open
answer), sexual orientation, (heterosexual,
bisexual or homosexual), birthplace, (any
state in Mexico), current place of residence,
(post code), other languages, (any indige-
nous language spoken in Mexico or any lan-
guage taught at UNAM), education level, (no
formal education, elementary school, mid-
dle school, high school, bachelor’s degree,
master’s degree, doctorate), major, (any un-
dergraduate program offered at the Ciudad
Universitaria campus), occupation, (student,
working student, worker, unemployed or re-
tired), profession (open answer), and kinship
or type of relationship between speakers.

In overall, our corpus has 12 sociolinguis-
tic variables that contribute to a large degree to
the characterization and study of language in IM
among youngsters. Furthermore, this allows our
data to become a subcorpus of a much larger one
in the future.

3.2 Data Collection
After establishing the sociodemographic metadata
to be collected along with WA chats, the team pro-
ceeded to gather the data. In order to ease the
data processing we collected chats with two par-
ticipants only. All chats were donated as text files
sent directly from the donors’ devices, while meta-
data was collected manually. At the initial stage,
the chats were collected using the directed sam-
pling method. A team approached random stu-
dents on campus explaining the project to them
and inviting them to collaborate donating one or
more WA chats. Those who consented to share
graphic variable used by UNAM in its statistics.

their chats -the donors- sent them via email to an
institutional address, then were asked to answer a
survey so the team could gather their and their in-
terlocutor’s sociodemographic information. After
that, the information provided was entered into a
spreadsheet along with a code that made it possi-
ble to link it to the corresponding text file. It is
worth mentioning that the same metadata was col-
lected with both methods.

3.3 Data Processing

The processing of data was done in two different
stages. First, by means of a Python script, the col-
lected data was saved into a spreadsheet. In the
same stage, it was organized in JSON format and
sent to the database as a document file. Second, a
program allowed the users anonymity by changing
their names in every chat to USER1 and USER2,
and by deleting sensitive information —such as
names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, bank
accounts, and so forth.

Currently, queries can be done with both with
Python scripts and MongoDB. Said tools permit
the filtering of results depending on the meta-
data, allowing also the possibility of selecting rel-
evant sociological variables and determining their
ranges. In the future, we will develop an inter-
face that makes the access and consultations to the
database possible.

4 The Corpus

Although the corpus is still being processed, it has
reached a mature stage which allows us to offer a
general panorama of its content and demograph-
ics. The following figures represent the corpus
state by March 2018. Should some changes be
made, the final figures will be presented in future
publications.

4.1 Content

Nowadays, we have 835 chats with 1,325 infor-
mants. After deleting dates, user names and all
messages generated automatically by the app, we
got 66,465 messages, 756,066 tokens and 45,497
types available for linguistic research.

Despite the fact that the vast majority of our
informants are Mexican native Spanish speakers,
texts in some other languages were found as well.
Most of the messages in a language other than
Spanish were written in English, however there
are also texts in French, Japanese, Italian, German,



4

Korean, Greek and Chinese.
Other than that, we were also able to pinpoint

which are the most frequently used lexical words
among the informants. Students seem to be keen
on using the ones displayed in Table 1.

Lexical Words
bien “good/well” 608,401
bueno “good/well” 45,700
amor “love” 44,900
bebé “baby” 40,302
solo “just/alone” 39,563

Table 1: Most frequent lexical words.

As it was previously mentioned, communica-
tion via IM shares several features with oral com-
munication. However, since it lacks physical co-
presence, it is necessary to develop some compen-
sation strategies. Which is why emojis and emoti-
cons are so widespread. The most frequent of
these icons found in the corpus are shown in Ta-
ble 2.

Emojis Emoticons
2,221 xd 1,516
1,015 :V 489

445 :( 453
435 :3 235
249 :) 117

Table 2: Most frequent emojis and emoticons.

4.2 Demographics
As stated above, our corpus was built with the col-
laboration of 1,325 informants (51% women and
49% men), between ages 14 and 60, born in 23 of
the 32 states in Mexico. Such a wide range of in-
formants’ age is due to the fact that some donors
shared chats, held not with peers, but with peo-
ple in their families, coworkers, or friends. Of all
informants, 84.9% are undergraduates studying at
C.U. Out of these students, 51.2% are women and
48.8% are men.

Henceforth, all figures refer only to bachelor in-
formants. 80.7% of bachelors in the corpus were
born in Mexico City, while 11.7% were born in
Estado de México, the biggest state surrounding
the capital. The rest were born in 20 other states
—particularly Hidalgo, Guerrero and Michoacán.

Our corpus have also informants born in Chile (2),
Colombia (1), The United States (1), and 3 that
did not report their birthplace. 77.4% of our infor-
mants live in the city, while 19.4% live in Estado
de México. The remaining 3.2% did not state their
post code.

As to sexual orientation, 88.9% of students in
the corpus declared themselves as heterosexual,
5.5 % bisexual and 5.4 % homosexual. Just .2%
chose not to share such information.

Although the purpose of this corpus is to col-
lect data from Mexican native Spanish speakers,
some informants donated chats with people from
other countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Italy, Lebanon, and the United States, to name a
few. All of these conversations were conducted
mostly in Spanish. As second language, infor-
mants claimed to speak Arabian, Bulgarian, Chi-
nese, English, French, German, modern Greek,
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Nahuatl, Portuguese,
Russian, or Swedish.

The students who donated their chats and their
interlocutors belong to different faculties. The fol-
lowing table presents both the faculty roster at
C.U. and the number of informants by sex.

5 Current Research

At the time of the writing, there are three lines of
research in the study of our corpus. One of them
is parenthetical expressions that can work as re-
pairs, instructions for interpretation, onomatopo-
etic expressions, surrogate prosodic cues to indi-
cate how an utterance should be read, or surrogate
proxemic cues such as emotes —sentences that in-
dicate imaginary actions taking place at the mo-
ment of texting (Christopherson, 2010).

1. * se pone a llorar *
“Starts crying.”

2. (léase como si fuera eco)
“Read as if it were an echo.”

Another research line is the study of oral (phonic)
traits in WA chats, for instance: the emulation
of children’s speech, repetition of vowels to indi-
cate elongation of sounds, omission of letters to
indicate consonant and vowel reduction, haplol-
ogy, use of upper case for emphasis (volume), etc.
(Yus Ramos, 2001)

3. kesestoooo
Standard Spanish: ¿Qué es esto?
“What is this?”

There is also the quantitative approach to code-
switching from a sociolinguistic perspective, fol-
lowed by a qualitative study of the forms and func-
tions of it (Elsayed, 2014).

Figure 1: Code-switching among bachelors.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented a corpus that will make the study
of language usage by college students via an In-
stant Messaging application possible. Its meta-
data will allow research, not only on mere linguis-
tic phenomena, but also the stablishment of corre-
lation between these and sociodemographic vari-
ables. Some of the phenomena that can be studied
in interactions, such as the ones via IM, are phonic

traits, parenthetical expressions, code-switching,
turn-taking, speech acts, linguistic variation, and
usage of emojis and emoticons.

Since the processing of data is still a work in
progress. As next step, we plan to perform an eval-
uation of the anonymization process.

The objective of this corpus is to be used by
both scholars and students in our group for the re-
search of the aforementioned phenomena and oth-
ers, and it is our intention to make it available upon
request for others, with academic purposes only.
