Abstract

We present our submission to the WMT19 Ro-
bustness Task. Our baseline system is the
Charles University (CUNI) Transformer sys-
tem trained for the WMT18 shared task on
News Translation. Quantitative results show
that the CUNI Transformer system is already
far more robust to noisy input than the LSTM-
based baseline provided by the task organizers.
We further improved the performance of our
model by fine-tuning on the in-domain noisy
data without influencing the translation qual-
ity on the news domain.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) is usually evaluated on
text coming from news written by a professional
journalist. However, in practice, MT should cover
more domains, including informal and not care-
fully spelled text that we encounter in the online
world.

Although machine translation quality increased
dramatically in recent years (Bojar et al.,
2018), several studies (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018;
Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018) has shown that the
current systems are sensitive to the source-side
noise. It is also an issue that was not studied inten-
sively in the past because neural systems appear to
be more noise-sensitive than the previously used
statistical systems (Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018).

Recently, Michel and Neubig (2018) prepared a
dataset called Machine Translation of Noisy Text
(MTNT) that focuses exclusively on translating
texts from the online environment. This dataset
is used for the WMT19 Robustness Task.

2 MTNT Dataset and Baselines

The MTNT dataset consists of sentences collected
from Reddit1 posts. Unlike the standard corpora

1http://www.reddit.com

which (in a major part) consist of formal language,
often written by professionals, this dataset con-
tains a substantial number of spelling errors, gram-
matical errors, emoticons, and profanities.

Manual translations are provided with the
source sentences crawled from the web. The trans-
lators were asked to keep all the noise-related
properties of the source sentence.

There are two language pairs included in the
dataset: English-French and English-Japanese in
both directions. The dataset comes in three splits,
for training, validation, and testing. The English-
French part consists of 36k examples in the train-
ing split, 852 examples for validation, 1020 exam-
ples for testing in the En→Fr direction, and 19k,
886, and 1022 examples for training, validation,
and testing respectively in the opposite direction.
For English-Japanese, the dataset is substantially
smaller, with around 6k training examples in both
directions. In our experiments, we focus solely on
the translation between French and English.

We noticed that the MTNT dataset as provided
for the task has some peculiarities that were prob-
ably caused inadvertently during the dataset build-
ing. Namely, the training and validation splits
seem to come from a single alphabetically sorted
file. This means that all validation source sen-
tences start with the letter “Y”, and anything that
comes after “Y” in the alphabetical order. Because
of this, the validation scores are unreliable. More-
over, a system trained on the training split will
have a difficult time translating sentences begin-
ning with e.g. the word “You”, which is a com-
monly seen instance in the online discussion do-
main. This does not affect the test split.

The baseline system introduced with the dataset
is a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model with at-
tention (Bahdanau et al., 2014). The encoder is a
bidirectional LSTM with two layers. The decoder
is a two-layer LSTM. The hidden state dimension

in the LSTMs is 1,024 and the word embedding
size is 512.

The model that was used as a baseline for the
Robustness Task was trained on the WMT15 par-
allel data. Additionally, simple fine-tuning using
stochastic gradient descent on the MTNT data is
shown to improve the translation quality by a large
margin. The translation quality of the system is
tabulated among our systems in Table 2.

3 Related Work

There have been several attempts to increase the
robustness of MT systems in recent years.

Cheng et al. (2018) employ an adversarial train-
ing scheme in a multi-task learning setup in order
to increase the system robustness. For each train-
ing example, its noisy counterpart is randomly
generated. The network is trained to yield such
input representations such that it is not possible to
train a discriminator that decides (based on the in-
put representation) which input is the noisy one.
This method improves both the robustness and the
translation quality on the clean data.

Liu et al. (2018) attempt to make the transla-
tion more robust towards noise from homophones.
This type of noise is common in languages with
non-phonetic writing systems and concerns words
or phrases which are pronounced in the same way,
but spelled differently. The authors of the pa-
per train the word embeddings to capture the pho-
netic information which eventually leads not only
to bigger robustness but also to improved transla-
tion quality in general.

To our knowledge, the only work that specifi-
cally uses the MTNT dataset attempts to improve
the system robustness by emulating the noise in
the clean data (Vaibhav et al., 2019). They in-
troduce two techniques for noise induction, one
employing hand-crafted rules, and one based on
back-translation. The techniques offer a similar
translation quality gains as fine-tuning on MTNT
data.

4 The CUNI Transformer model

Our original plan was to train a system that would
be robust by itself and would not require further
fine-tuning on the MTNT dataset.

As the baseline model, we use the Trans-
former “Big” model (Vaswani et al., 2017) as
implemented in Tensor2Tensor (Vaswani et al.,
2018). We train the model using the procedure

described in Popel (2018) and Popel and Bojar
(2018), which was the best-performing method
for Czech-to-English and English-to-Czech trans-
lation at WMT18 News Translation shared task
(Bojar et al., 2018).

We trained our model on all parallel data avail-
able for the WMT15 News Translation task (Bojar
et al., 2015). We acquired additional synthetic data
by back-translation of the WMT News Crawl cor-
pora (from years 2008–2014 for French and 2011–
2017 for English). We did not include the News
Discussion corpus that we considered too noisy for
training the system. Table 1 gives an overview of
the training data composition.

5 Fine-Tuning

Similarly to the baseline experiments presented
with the MTNT dataset (Michel and Neubig,
2018), we fine-tune our general-domain model on
the MTNT dataset.

We continued the training of the models using
the training part of the MTNT dataset. Unlike the
original model, we used plain stochastic gradient
descent with a constant learning rate for updat-
ing the weights. We executed several fine-tuning
runs with different learning rates and observed that
learning rates smaller than 10−5 do not change
the model outputs at all and learning rates larger
than 10−4 cause the models to diverge immedi-
ately. The models in our final submission were
fine-tuned with a learning rate of 10−4.

6 Results

We evaluate the results on four datasets. The first
one is neswtest2014 (Bojar et al., 2014), a stan-
dard WMT test set consisting of manually trans-
lated newspaper texts where one half is originally
in English and the other half originally in French.

Because of the large amount of training data
available, even the statistical MT systems achieved
high translation quality on the news domain. Be-
cause of that a slightly different test set, newsdis-
cusstest2015, was used as the evaluation test set
for the WMT15 competition (Bojar et al., 2015).
The test set consists of sentences from discus-
sions under news stories from The Guardian and
Le Monde. Even though the topics are the same
as the news stories, the language used in the dis-
cussions is less formal and contains grammatical
and spelling errors, which makes them somewhat
closer to the MTNT dataset.

Finally, we evaluate the models on the test part
of the MTNT dataset (described in Section 2) and
the blind test set for the WMT19 Robustness Task,
which was collected in the same way as the origi-
nal MTNT dataset.

The quantitative results are shown in Table 2.
The Transformer-based baseline outperforms the
RNN-based MTNT baseline by a large margin on
both WMT and MTNT test datasets.

The fine-tuning of the RNN-based models
brings a substantial translation quality boost of 8
and 7 BLEU points in each direction respectively.
This effect is much smaller with our stronger base-
line and only improves the performance by around
2 BLEU points in either direction. This may in-

(top) and French-to-English (bottom) systems with two
different learning rates.

dicate that sufficiently strong models are robust
enough and do not need further fine-tuning for the
type of noise present in the MTNT dataset. Es-
pecially in French-to-English translation, the fine-
tuning improvement is reached at the expense of
decreased translation quality in the news domain.

We observe that the fine-tuning has only a small
negative impact on the translation quality of our
models on the general-domain data. It would be
interesting to see how big impact made the fine-
tuning of the MTNT baseline model, which gained
such a large improvement on the domain-specific
data. However, the authors of the baseline (Michel
and Neubig, 2018) do not report these results.

We plot the learning curves from the progress of
the system fine-tuning in Figure 1. Even though
the fine-tuning improved the model performance
on both language pairs by approximately the same
margin, the courses of the fine-tuning differ fun-
damentally. For English-to-French translation, we
see that the translation quality slowly increases un-
til convergence. For the opposite direction, it im-
proves immediately and keeps oscillating during
the remaining training steps. We found that this
effect was similar regardless of the learning rate.

Although we observed a strong effect of check-
point averaging during the baseline model train-
ing, it has almost no effect on the fine-tuned mod-
els. Therefore, we report only the performance for
parameter checkpoints with the highest validation
BLEU scores.

Table 3 compares the automatic scores with
other WMT19 Robustness Task participants. Our
submission was outperformed by submissions by
Naver Labs Europe in both translation directions.
Their submission used the same architecture as our
submission, but in addition, it employed corpus
tags and synthetic noise generation. Details about
other systems were not known at the time of our
submission.

7 Conclusions

In our submission to the WMT19 Robustness
Task, we experiment with fine-tuning of strong
Transformer-based baselines for translation be-
tween English and French.

Our results show that when using a strong base-
line, the effect of fine-tuning on a domain-specific
dataset is much smaller than for weaker models
introduced as a baseline with the MTNT dataset.
