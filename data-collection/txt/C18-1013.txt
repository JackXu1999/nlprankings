Abstract

Modeling U.S. Congressional legislation and roll-call votes has received significant attention in
previous literature. However, while legislators across 50 state governments and D.C. propose
over 100,000 bills each year, and on average enact over 30% of them, state level analysis has
received relatively less attention due in part to the difficulty in obtaining the necessary data.
Since each state legislature is guided by their own procedures, politics and issues, however, it
is difficult to qualitatively asses the factors that affect the likelihood of a legislative initiative
succeeding. Herein, we present several methods for modeling the likelihood of a bill receiving
floor action across all 50 states and D.C. We utilize the lexical content of over 1 million bills,
along with contextual legislature and legislator derived features to build our predictive models,
allowing a comparison of the factors that are important to the lawmaking process. Furthermore,
we show that these signals hold complementary predictive power, together achieving an average
improvement in accuracy of 18% over state specific baselines.

1 Introduction

Federal institutions in the U.S., like Congress and the Supreme Court, play a significant role in lawmak-
ing, and in many observable ways define our legal system. Thus, as data and computational resources
have become more readily available, political scientists have increasingly been adopting quantitative
methods focused on understanding these entities and the role they play in our society (Katz et al., 2017;
Poole and Rosenthal, 2007; Slapin and Proksch, 2008; Lauderdale and Clark, 2014).

Although many issues are legislated and regulated primarily at the federal level, state governments
have significant power over certain areas. An increasing number of important issues are being decided
at the state or local levels, especially in emerging industries and technologies, such as the gig economy
and autonomous vehicles (Hedge, 1998). Moreover, there are 535 members of Congress who introduce
over 10,000 pieces of legislation a session,1 of which less than 5% is enacted. Similar dynamics exist
at the state level, except on a much broader scale. There are over 7,000 state legislators, in aggregate
introducing over 100,000 pieces of legislation, with over 30% being enacted. In order to be enacted,
every bill must pass through one or more legislative committees and be considered on the chamber floor,
a process we refer to as receiving floor action. This process is one of the most pivotal steps during
lawmaking (Rosenthal, 1974; Hamm, 1980; Francis, 1989; Rakoff and Sarner, 1975), as on average,
only 41% of bills receive floor action, with most legislation languishing in the committees.

Legislative policymaking decisions are extremely complex, and are influenced by a myriad of factors,
ranging from the content of the legislation, to legislators’ personal characteristics, such as profession,
religion, and party and ideological affiliations, to their constituents’ demographics, to governor agendas,
to interest group activities, and to world events (Canfield-Davis et al., 2010; Hicks and Smith, 2009;
Talbert and Potoski, 2002).

Despite this complexity, in this paper we present an approach to better understand state lawmaking
dynamics and the legislative process by focusing on the task of predicting the likelihood that legislation

will reach the floor in each state. As there are many dimensions underlying the content of the legislation,
such as the policy area and ideology of the sponsor (Linder et al., 2018), that may affect the likelihood of
floor action, in addition to text we examine several established contextual legislature and legislator de-
rived features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work quantitatively modeling the floor action
process across all 50 states and using the text of legislation alongside traditional contextual information.

2 Related Work

Much of the work analyzing the federal legislature is aimed at understanding legislator preferences
through the use of voting patterns. One of the most popular techniques in political science is the ap-
plication of spatial, or ideal point, models built from voting records (Poole and Rosenthal, 1985; Poole
and Rosenthal, 2007), that is often used to represent unidimensional or multidimensional ideological
stances (Clinton et al., 2004). However, there is also an increasing literature examining broader legisla-
tive dynamics, such as measuring legislative effectiveness (Harbridge, 2016), evaluating the impact of
legislation on stock prices using legislators’ constituents (Cohen et al., 2012), creating cosponsorship
networks (Fowler, 2006), and examining the role of lobbying (Bertrand et al., 2018; Matthew et al.,
2013),

In recent years a variety of primary and secondary textual legal data, such as legislation, floor debates,
and committee transcripts, has become increasingly available, enabling the NLP community to create
richer multidimensional ideal point estimation (Gerrish and Blei, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2015; Kornilova
et al., 2018), and examine ideology detection from political speech (Iyyer et al., 2014), voting prediction
from debates (Thomas et al., 2006), committee referral (Yano et al., 2012), and enactment (Nay, 2016).

While there is also an increasing amount of state legislative research, states have received significantly
less attention (Hamm et al., 2014). One major reason for this is that quantitative methods require data,
and the availability of data for Congress far exceeds that of states. In fact, Yano et al. (2012) noted “When
we consider a larger goal of understanding legislative behavior across many legislative bodies (e.g.,
states in the U.S., other nations, or international bodies), the challenge of creating and maintaining such
reliable, clean, and complete databases seems insurmountable.” Thus, while there has been scholarship
quantifying the role of committees, it has been limited in scope, to a few sessions or states, or reliant on
survey data (Francis, 1989; Rakoff and Sarner, 1975; Rosenthal, 1974; Hamm, 1980). More recently,
as different kinds of state data has become more accessible, it has enabled studying the affect of interest
groups on legislative activity (Gray and Lowery, 1995), the application of spatial models (Shor et al.,
2010; Shor and McCarty, 2011), and comparisons of textual similarity (Linder et al., 2018).

The contribution of this work is to continue building a broader understanding of state legislative dy-
namics by evaluating how predictable state lawmaking is, and what factors influence that process. We
create a novel task, predicting the likelihood of legislation receiving floor action, and utilize a corpus of
over 1 million bills to build computational models of all 50 states and D.C. We present several baseline
models utilizing various features, and show that combining the legislative and legislator contextual in-
formation with the text content of bills consistently provides the best predictions. Our analysis considers
various factors and their respective importance in the predictive models across the states, showing that
although there are some consistent patterns, there are many variations and differences in what affects the
likelihood in each state.

3 Data

There is state-to-state variation in the legislative procedure of how a bill becomes law, but the path is
largely similar. Legislation is introduced by one or more members of the legislature in their respective
chamber,2 and assigned to one or more standing subject committees.3 Committees are made up of a
subset of members of their respective chamber, and are chaired by the majority party. Once in committee,

2All legislatures are bicameral, with either a House or Assembly as the lower chamber, and the Senate as the upper chamber,
except D.C. and Nebraska, which are unicameral.

3Depending on the state, other groups can introduce legislation, including legislative committees, legislative delegations,
the governor, or non-elected individuals. For the purpose of this work we focus on legislator sponsored legislation.

legislation is subject to debate and amendment only by the committee members, with the successful
outcome being a favorable referral, or a recommendation, to be considered by the full chamber on the
floor.

The primary data we use to model floor action was scraped directly from each state legislatures’
website. For each state, we downloaded legislation, committee, and legislator pages for all sessions that
were publicly accessible. Legislation pages were automatically parsed to determine legislative contextual
metadata, which includes bill text versions, sponsors, committee assignments, and the timeline of actions.
Legislator pages were parsed to obtain sponsor contextual metadata, which includes party affiliation,
committee assignments, and committee roles.

As states demarcate legislative status in the timeline of actions differently, we automatically map
and normalize all textual descriptions of legislative actions to a finite set of statuses.4 These statuses
are used to determine whether a piece of legislation survived committee and received a floor action, or
consideration on the floor. All bills having a status of passed in their introductory chamber, or having
had a recorded floor vote are treated as positive examples, while any status prior to passed is considered
failed, including legislation that was reported out of committee but not considered on the floor.

Finally, since each state follows their own conventions with regard to classifying the type of legislation,
we normalize all legislation across states to two types: resolutions and bills.5

Figure 1a shows the total number of bills introduced and receiving floor action for each state. In
total, our dataset consists of 1.3 million pieces of state legislation, broken into 1 million bills, with 360k
receiving floor action, at an average rate across states of 41%, and 275k resolutions, with 210k receiving
floor action. On average, we have 10 legislative sessions of data per state.6 As bills represent substantive
legislation, with a much lower floor action rate, while resolutions are much more likely to receive floor
action, for the rest of this paper we focus on bills only, and refer to bills and legislation interchangeably.
We include 15 sessions of U.S federal legislation in our data for comparative purposes, with 23k of 172k
bills receiving floor action.

Figure 1b presents the percent of bills receiving floor action. It is interesting to note the difference
in difficulty for legislation to receive floor action in different states. For example, in New Jersey and
Massachusetts, fewer than 15% of bills reach the floor, whereas 75% do in Colorado and Arkansas.7

4.1 Models
In order to not only be able to predict, but also examine the importance of features to our prediction,
we chose three relatively interpretable models for our modeling framework. Formally, let our training

amendment.

data (X,Y ) consist of n pairs (xi, yi)ni=1 where, each xi is a bill and yi a binary indicator of whether
xi received floor action. Let f(xi) be a feature vector representation of xi, and w the parameter vector
indicating the weight of each feature learned by the model.

The first two models are linear classifiers, where the prediction of floor action, ŷi, is given by
sign(w>f(x)). The first is a regularized conditional log-linear model pw(y |x):

pw(y |x) =
exp

{

where Z(x) is the partition function given by

. The model optimizes w according to

The second model is NBSVM (Wang and Manning, 2012), an interpolation between multinomial
Naive Bayes and a support vector machine, which optimizes w according to:

min

where r is the log-count ratio of features occurring in positive and negative examples. The third model
is non-linear, in the form of a tree-based gradient boosted machine (Friedman, 2000), which optimizes
w according to:

Ω(tk) (4)

where K is the number of trees, l is the loss function, typically binomial deviance, and ŷi is given by∑K
k=1 tk(xi) where tk is a tree.
We use the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementation for the log-linear and gradient

boosted models, and implemented NBSVM based on the interpolated version in Wang and Manning
(2012).

As hyperparameters, such as learning rate and regularization, have a significant impact on model per-
formance, we use Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Bergstra et al., 2011) to select the optimal hy-
perparameters for each model on a held-out development set. We used the tree-structured Parzen Estima-
tor (TPE) algorithm implemented in hyperopt for our sequential model-based optimization (Bergstra
et al., 2013). After individually optimizing hyperparameters and training each of the three base models,
we use their outputs to train a meta-ensemble model, a regularized conditional log-linear model, forming
a linear combination over their predictions (Breiman, 1996).

As the lawmaking process in each state, and even within each chamber, is different, we divide the
problem space by state and chamber, building separate models for each subset. Specifically, we consider
each of these as separate problems: upper chamber bills and lower chamber bills. Thus, we have 2
predictions per state, and each prediction is comprised of 4 model outputs, three from the base models,
and one from the meta-ensemble, resulting in 400 models.8

4.2 Features
As there are many dimensions underlying bills that may affect the likelihood of floor action, we compute
and utilize several established contextual legislature and legislator derived features. Previous literature
has proposed various factors that may affect legislation, including the content of bills,9 number of and

9In most previous literature the content is determined via a manual analysis of each bill to establish the scope of impact, the
complexity, or the incremental nature.

identity of sponsors, extra-legislative forms of support, timing of introduction, leadership’s position,
seniority, identity of chairperson of the committee, identity of one’s own party, and membership of the
dominant faction (Hamm, 1980; Rakoff and Sarner, 1975; Harbridge, 2016; Yano et al., 2012).

In order to quantitatively evaluate these factors and establish a strong baseline from which to measure
the affect of text, we include the contextual features shown in Table 1. These indicator features derived
from the sponsors, committees, and bills are meant to capture many of the major factors that are proposed
in the literature.10 To strengthen the representation of legislators in our model beyond the basic features
described above, we compute several measures of legislator effectiveness. The effectiveness score is
calculated from the sponsoring and cosponsoring activity of each legislator, and meant to represent where
they stand in relation to other legislators in successfully passing legislation.11

Similar to Harbridge (2016), the score we compute for each legislator is a combination of several
partial scores, computed for each important stage of the legislative process. Each legislator gets a score
for how many bills they sponsored, getting those bills out of committee, getting them to the floor, passing
their own chamber, passing the legislature, and getting enacted. The score for each stage is further broken
down by how many of those pieces of legislation were substantive, i.e. bills, attempting a meaningful
legal change, versus non-substantive, i.e. resolutions. This results in 12 factors for each individual.
To compute a score for each legislator’s relative performance at each stage to the other members in the
chamber, we create a weighted combination of that legislator’s bills and resolutions, where bills get more
weight, and compute the ratio based on the weighted contribution of the other members in the chamber.
All the stage scores are then combined into a second weighted combination, where each successive stage
in the process gets more weight, to get the final score. Finally, the scores are normalized to 0-10. In
addition to using the effectiveness scores directly as features, we further compute and discretize several
statistics derived from them, including ranks, percentiles, and deviations from the mean thereof.

To further enrich the bill representation beyond contextual information, we utilize the textual content of
the bills. The legislation in our collection is comprised of long documents, with an average of 11 thousand
words, often containing significant amounts of procedural language and pieces of extant statutes. As this
can create additional challenges in identifying the salient points, for this work we chose to focus on
a condensed amount of text, specifically the state provided title and description, that average 17 and
18 words, respectively.12 Both are preprocessed by lowercasing and stemming. We compute the tf-idf
weighting for n-grams of size (1,3) on the training data for each prediction task, and select the top 10k

10Each count based feature, such as number of sponsors, also spawns a number of discretized features, including ranks,
percentiles, and deviations from the mean thereof. We automatically compute companion bills using a cosine-based lexical
similarity.

11This is not a holistic representation of being an effective legislator, as someone may consider themselves effective by not
passing anything, or preventing others from doing so. Members may also be highly influential and their support is needed
behind the scenes but their names do not appear on the legislation. We can only account for recorded activity. Despite the
limitations, we argue this is a fair, if incomplete, assessment of how well the legislator advances their agenda.

12Although this is a coarse approximation of the bill content, we believe it should capture the substantive aspects of the bill.
Full details of the length of documents in each state are given in Table 7 in Appendix A.

While we would like to study the predictability of reaching the floor upon first introduction, bills often

change after introduction and are updated with additional information. Thus, we limit our features to
those available at the time of first introduction.

5 Results

In order to clarify the impact that each set of features described in Section 4.2 has on predictive perfor-
mance, we create five different subsets of features described in Table 2, and train models on each one of
them separately.

The first condition, combined contains all the contextual and text content features. The second
condition, no_txt, removes text content, allowing us to study the importance of all contextual fea-
tures, and by comparing combined to no_txt we can evaluate if text has any complementary infor-
mation to contextual features. The third condition, no_txt_spon further removes sponsor features,
essentially allowing us to study the importance of committee information. By comparing no_txt to
no_txt_spon we can evaluate what sponsors contribute. The fourth and fifth conditions use only
sponsor and only text features, respectively, to study the importance of each individually.

All models for a given condition are built from the same training data and feature space. We measure
and report several performance metrics of our models using 10-fold cross validation. The baseline model
represents guessing the majority class; for some states this means all fail, for others it is all receive floor
action, based on the state specific rate.

Although accuracy is informative with respect to how many correct binary decisions the model made,
as noted in Bradley (1997) for imbalanced problems such as this, where one class dominates, the baseline
accuracy can be very high. As a supplement, it is useful to measure a probabilistic loss, where there is a
cost associated with how correct the decision was. Thus, we move beyond pure predictive performance
and consider the actual probability distributions created by our models under different conditions. The
log-linear and gradient boosted models are probabilistic, while NBSVM is not, thus we train a probability
transformation on top of NBSVM using Platts Scaling to obtain probability estimates.

In additional to accuracy, we measure model performance on log-loss and AUROC (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) (Bradley, 1997). Log-loss, LL is defined as:

LL = − 1
n

n∑
i=1

1(yi = ŷi) log(pi) + (1− 1(yi = ŷi)) log(1− pi) (5)

where 1(yi = ŷi) is an binary indicator function equaling 1 if the model prediction ŷi was correct,
and 0 otherwise. LL equals zero for a perfect classifier, and increases with worse probability estimates.
Specifically, LL penalizes models more the more confident they are in an incorrect classification.

AUROC allows us to measure the relationship between a model’s true positive (TP), how many floor
action bills were correctly predicted as floor action, and false positive rate (FP), how many failed bills
were predicted as floor action. It is defined by:

AUROC =
N∑
i=1

p(TP )∆p(FP ) +

(∆p(TP )∆p(FP )) (6)

Table 3: Average and standard deviation across states on accuracy, log-loss, AUROC for bills on each
feature set.

By considering the TP and FP at different values, we can construct an ROC curve. The area under
that curve, AUROC, can be interpreted as the probability that the model will rank a uniformly selected
positive instance (floor action) higher than a uniformly selected negative instance (failure), or in other
words, the average rank of a positive example. A random model will have a AUROC of 0.5, and a 45-
degree diagonal curve, while a perfect model will have an AUROC of 1, and be vertical, then horizontal.

Table 3 shows the average accuracy, LL, and AUROC with standard deviations for each of the five
conditions. The just_txt model achieves an accuracy of 73%, outperforming the baseline by 5%, and
notably, shows that there is a predictive signal even within the limited amount of text available in the title
and descriptions.

To examine where text content is most and least predictive on its own, we disentangle the average
performance of the just_txt model in Figure 2a, showing the per state and chamber pair change from
baseline. The states that improve the most over baseline, with 15% improvement or more using only
textual features are Oregon, Oklahoma, Tennessee, D.C., South Carolina, Louisiana (lower), Georgia
(lower), and Alabama (lower). On the other hand, text is least predictive in Connecticut, Wyoming,
Idaho, New Jersey, Utah (upper), New Hampshire (upper), North Dakota (upper), all underperforming
the baseline.

The relatively small improvement over baseline of just_txt provides insight into the lawmaking
process, raising the possibility that other contextual factors, outside the subject matter of the legislation,
such as who the sponsors are and what committee the bill is assigned to, are often more important than
the subject of the legislation.

The just_spon model achieves an average accuracy of 76%, slightly outperforming just_txt
with an improvement over baseline of 8%. This further indicates that knowing sponsor related infor-
mation, without reference to the subject of the legislation, is itself highly predictive. In fact, Figure 2b
shows that except for New Hampshire (upper), almost all states achieve gains using sponsor only infor-
mation, with Oklahoma, Texas, and Ohio achieving gains of 30% or more. The committee information in
no_txt_spon, which includes the sponsor committee positions, is even more predictive than sponsor
and text only, and the addition of sponsors in no_txt improves performance by 3.5%.

Including text in the combined model further improves performance by 1.3% over no_txt, and
18% over the majority class baseline, showing the complementary effects of contextual and lexical in-
formation, as this model consistently outperforms all others. Figure 2c shows the per state and chamber
pair baseline and combined model performance. The AUROC performance follows a very similar
trajectory.

On LL, the model performance follows a similar path, with all models showing improvement in prob-
ability estimates from the baseline. LL almost doubles from the combined model’s 0.31 to 0.6 on
baseline. This reinforces that the combined model makes very confident correct predictions. In-
cluding text in the combined improves performance slightly over no_txt, while having just sponsors
or just text decreases the LL to around 0.5.

6 Analysis

All contextual and lexical features considered above are available upon the introduction of a bill, or
shortly thereafter,13 thus the evaluation above indicates how well floor action can be predicted from
the day of introduction. However, after the bill is introduced, subsequent legislative actions indicate
further contextual information about the legislative process. As it is reasonable to assume these actions
carry relevant predictive information, we further examine subsequent events in the legislative process
in the combined+act feature set. We include a binary feature for the occurrence of amendment
introduction and outcomes, votes, committee referral outcomes and readings up to the point of floor
action. By comparing combined+act to combined we can examine how important different events
in the legislative procedure are to predicting floor action.

Table 4: Average accuracy, log-loss, AUROC for bills using legislative events post introduction.

Feature Set Accuracy Log-Loss AUROC
Average SD Average SD Average SD

combined 0.859 0.093 0.31 0.17 0.85 0.21
combined+act 0.94 0.059 0.16 0.12 0.97 0.04

Table 4 shows the results of the combined+act feature set. Accuracy improves to 0.94, while
LL drops by half to 0.16, confirming that legislative events occurring up to the point point of floor
action carry significant complementary information to other contextual factors and are highly indicative
of floor action. While combined+act confirms the predictive power of procedural factors outside
the legislative text, sponsor, and committee assignment, the combined model is arguably the most
important result, as it indicates how well we can predict on features that are available upon introduction.

Beyond the predictions, we are interested in identifying the different features that contribute to legisla-
tive success across the states. As there are both a large number of models, and features in each model,
in order to understand the relative predictive importance of contextual and legislature specific dynamics,
we choose several previously proposed factors deemed to be important for floor action, and compare the
rank and weight they received in each model.

We first examine the median rank and weight given to the following features in the just_spon con-
dition across all states: bipartisan, sponsor in minority, sponsor in majority, and the number of sponsors.
While many of these contextual features are highly ranked, there are many variations and differences
across states. The top half of Table 5 shows the top ten states for which each feature was ranked among
the top 20. For example, the bipartisan feature is ranked in the top 5 in Missouri, Virginia, Maine, and
Mississippi, accounting for up to 6% of the explanatory power. As a comparison, in South Dakota,
Hawaii, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, bipartisanship ranked lower than 200. Whether the
sponsor is in the minority is important in the U.S. Congress, where it is ranked 6th, along with Delaware,
Tennessee, and West Virginia. Being in the majority accounts for 10% in Kentucky, and 7% in Wiscon-
sin. This aligns with previous literature, as Wisconsin is known to have a strong party system (Hamm,

13Some states do not indicate committee assignment immediately, for those we include the first assignment after introduction.

1980), and indeed we find sponsor in majority and in minority features to be ranked 1st and 9th, re-
spectively, while in Texas, which has a much weaker party system, those features are ranked among the
lowest of all states.14

Similar ranking is presented for committee features in the bottom half of Table 5 in the
no_txt_spon condition. The committee features play a similarly predictive role, with the spon-
sors holding membership positions on the committee accounting for over 10% of explanatory power
in Delaware, Connecticut, Maine, and South Dakota.

To examine the difference in probability assigned by the models under different conditions, we chose a
representative example where neither contextual nor lexical features dominate, as shown in Figure 2, and
show the boxplots for Pennsylvania’s lower chamber in Figure 3. Each subfigure shows the probability
of floor action for legislation that received floor action (pass) and did not (failed). In all cases, the median
of the probabilities on legislation that received floor action is higher than the median of the probabilities
on legislation that failed. The combined models median and mean predictions on bills receiving action
are above 90%, and it has the largest difference between the two cases. The no_txt model has a
similar mean, but the probabilities become more distributed on both pass and fail. Removing sponsors
significantly affects the distribution, and shifts the mean lower to 70%. just_spon and just_text
both drop the mean to around 40%.

In addition, we show the calibration curves and distribution of predictions for the same settings in
Figure 4 and ROC curves in Figure 5 in Appendix A. All models are well calibrated, closely following
the diagonal line. The combined model is very confident in its predictions, resembling a bimodal
distribution, placing most predictions close to either 0 or 1 probability. just_spon has the most
distributed probability estimates, while just_txt moves the lower part of the distribution slightly
forward. The combined model is quite accurate, with each subsequent model moving the ROC curve
to the right, and thus allowing more false positives to reach the same true positive rate.15

Finally, we examine language ranked most and least predictive on the just_txt condition for New
Mexico, Pennsylvania, and New York in Table 6.16 Previous literature has proposed several theories on
how content affects legislative passage, including that the more redistributive a policy is perceived, the
higher in controversy, or the greater in scope, the lower the passage likelihood (Rakoff and Sarner, 1975;
Hamm, 1980). While each state has a unique set of issues that are likely to be taken to the floor, and
conversely, to be left in committee, there is also evident overlap. In the top phrases, several states contain

measures. We also see commendation and procedural language, which is often less contentious. In the
bottom phrases, several states have tax related language, and several education related topics.

While outside the scope of this work, in future work we hope to explore the differing language identi-
fied by the model to help identify important questions about the policymaking process in each state, and
allow comparison within states of what successful legislation contains, and across states, of how different
issues take shape. In addition, as we only included a limited amount of text, we would like to explore
how to incorporate the full body text of legislation effectively.

7 Conclusion

In this paper we explored the state legislative process by introducing the task of predicting floor action
across all 50 states and D.C. We presented several baseline models and showed that combining contextual
information about the legislators and legislatures with bill text consistently provides the best predictions,
achieving an accuracy of 86% on which legislation will reach the floor upon first introduction. We
further analyzed various factors and their respective importance in the predictive models across the states,
gaining a broader understanding of state legislative dynamics. While the factors that influence legislative
floor action success are diverse and understandably inconsistent among states, by examining them we
can empirically help elucidate the similarities and differences of the policymaking processes.
