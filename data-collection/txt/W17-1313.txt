Abstract

Cross Language Information Retrieval
(CLIR) systems are a valuable tool to en-
able speakers of one language to search for
content of interest expressed in a different
language. A group for whom this is of par-
ticular interest is bilingual Arabic speakers
who wish to search for English language
content using information needs expressed
in Arabic queries. A key challenge in
CLIR is crossing the language barrier
between the query and the documents.
The most common approach to bridging
this gap is automated query translation,
which can be unreliable for vague or short
queries. In this work, we examine the
potential for improving CLIR effectiveness
by predicting the translation effectiveness
using Query Performance Prediction (QPP)
techniques. We propose a novel QPP
method to estimate the quality of transla-
tion for an Arabic-Engish Cross-lingual
User-generated Speech Search (CLUGS)
task. We present an empirical evaluation
that demonstrates the quality of our method
on alternative translation outputs extracted
from an Arabic-to-English Machine Trans-
lation system developed for this task. Fi-
nally, we show how this framework can be
integrated in CLUGS to find relevant trans-
lations for improved retrieval performance.

1 Introduction

The growing archives of online digital content
are increasingly diverse in style, media and the
language used. Within this content the balance
between use of languages is very uneven. An
important case of this effect is Arabic multimedia
content where the amount of content available
is proportionally very small. This results in a
significant demand from bilingual Arabic speakers
to access information in other languages, most

notably English. Cross Language Information
Retrieval (CLIR) is an effective tool to bridge the
language barrier between user search queries in
one language and the target documents in another
language (Oard and Diekema, 1998; Khwileh et al.,
2016). The simplest and most commonly adopted
approach in CLIR is to use machine translation
(MT) to translate the user’s query. In most cases,
MT is used as a black box as an input stage to an
otherwise unchanged monolingual search system
Many different MT systems have been studied in
CLIR research for different tasks, e.g. (Oard and
Hackett, 1998; Magdy and Jones, 2014). However,
no single MT system has been reported to be
effective for all CLIR tasks.

The effectiveness of an MT system for CLIR
is primarily evaluated by examining the retrieval
quality associated with the translated queries. We
follow this practice in this paper, by considering
translation quality in terms of measured IR
performance on an experimental test collection.
We investigation concentrates on a cross-lingual
user-generated speech search (CLUGS) task
(Khwileh et al., 2015). In this work, we propose
a prediction framework that utilises Query Per-
formance Prediction (QPP) methods to estimate
expected IR performance for specific query
translation based both on the translated query itself
and the output of the translation process. As part
of our investigation we explore the use of QPP to
select from an N-best list of alternative translations
for q query generated by an statistical MT systems.

In the next section we give some background
and describe the motivation behind our CLUGS
task. Section 3 gives an overview of the QPP
approaches that we study in this investigation.
Section 4 introduces our proposed prediction
framework for CLUGS. Section 5 outlines our
experimental settings. Section 6 evaluates the
proposed framework and section 7 shows this
approach can indeed be utilised for finding relevant
translations in CLUGS. Section 8 concludes,
together with some avenues for future work.

2 Cross-lingual Arabic-to-English
Search for User-generated Speech

The current explosive growth in internet-based
social media networks content is creating massive
volumes of online multimedia content. This
includes User-Generated Speech (UGS) content
which is being uploaded to social media sites
websites such as YouTube and Facebook. These
increasing quantities of UGS data, together with its
complex and inconsistent structure, are creating the
need for sophisticated Spoken Content Retrieval
(SCR) systems to locate relevant material. This
presents new challenges and exciting opportunities
for IR research. SCR technologies require the com-
bination of speech processing technologies with IR
methods. SCR typically utilises Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) to generate text transcripts of
spoken audio. At a simple level, SCR can be con-
sidered as the application of IR techniques to ASR
transcripts. However, errors in ASR transcripts and
the nature of spoken content present significant
challenges for SCR (Larson and Jones, 2012).

Figure 1: Example of the content variation issue across
languages: Video search results for Arabic and English queries.

Beyond these challenges in SCR, further
challenges are raised in a multilingual search
setting. As noted earlier, one of the scenarios for
multilingual search is CLIR where a searcher uses
a query in one language to find relevant content
in another one, where relevant content in the query
language is either sparse or not available.

This is a particularly notable issue for Arabic
which is spoken by an estimated 420M speakers
in different countries, making it one of the most-
spoken languages in the world. Arabic has been the
language with the largest growth in Internet users
in the last decade with an estimated 2500% growth.
In 2016, there were an estimated 168M Internet
users with 45% Internet penetration (Internetworld-
stats.com, 2016). However, the Arabic content
available online is still minimal, estimated as being
less than 0.1% of the Internet content. The massive
gap between available content and speakers of the
language means that bilingual Arabic speakers will

often seek relevant content in another language. To
illustrate this situation consider the example in Fig-
ure 1. This shows the search engine with a simple
Arabic query �HAÓñÊªÖÏ @ ¨Ag. Q��@ Ñ 	¢	� ú


	̄ �èQå 	Am×
and the equivalent English query Information
retrieval system lecture
The Google video search engine1 located more
than 29,000 matching results in English with all
top-ranked results being relevant with high-quality
metadata. However, for Arabic, only 203 matching
results were located with only one of the top-10
results indicated as relevant.

2.1 Related Work
Addressing CLIR for Arabic speakers provides a
real-world use case where research into improved
CLIR is important due to its linguistic challenges
and political importance (Darwish et al., 2014).

Relevant linguistic features include the complex-
ity of morphological and syntactic structures that
require special processing. Indeed, MT for Arabic
to English is considered one of the most difficult
challenges in CLIR, and effective techniques
working with special characteristics of the Arabic
language are required (Alqudsi et al., 2014).
Previous CLIR work on Arabic has been limited
to standard text-based TREC 2001/2002 CLEF2

tracks (Oard and Gey, 2002; Besançon et al., 2009;
Darwish et al., 2014). The data collections used
in these tasks were standard Text Arabic news
collection collected from AFP. Another larger AFP
newswire Arabic collection was released by the
INFILE Track in CLEF 2008/2009 (Besançon et
al., 2009), but unfortunately received no partic-
ipation. To date most work on Arabic CLIR has
actually focused on the other side of the story, i.e.
the retrieval of Arabic documents based on English
queries (English-to-Arabic CLIR). Which enabling
access to information from Arabic sources, does
not address the needs to Arabic speakers. In this
work, we study a CLIR task that enables Arabic
users to search for the relevant spoken content from
the English web. In previous work we investigated
the use of Google Translate 3 as a black box
off-the-self MT system for this task (2015) We
found that the main challenges of this task arise due
to noise in the search index for the user-generated
data, and how Arabic translation errors can
significantly harm retrieval effectiveness.

Despite the problems in translation problems
for CLIR encountered when using off-the-shelf

MT systems such as Google and Bing Translate4,
have been observed to outperform open-box MT
systems developed by CLIR researchers for many
language pairs (Zhou et al., 2012). For instance,
during the CLEF 2009 workshop (Leveling et
al., 2009a; Leveling et al., 2009b), the best
performing non-off-the-shelf MT achieved just
70% of the performance achieved by Google
Translate. However, in our earlier work we found
that the use of black-box MT for Arabic is still
ineffective compared to other languages pairs
(such as French-to-English CLIR) (2015).

From examination of the behaviour of MT
systems, it is clear that while the “best” translation
produced by the MT does not always produce
the most effective translation for optimal CLIR
performance, better translations are often produced
with lower translation confidence by the MT
system. In this investigation, we seek to use
Query Performance Prediction (QPP) methods
developed in the IR community, to improve CLEF
effectiveness for Arabic-English search using
an open-box MT system. We then study the
effectiveness of this approach against standard
online black-box MT for a CLUGS search task. In
the next sections we describe these QPP techniques
and how we utilize them in our CLUGS task.

3 Query Performance Prediction

The motivation behind QPP methods in IR is to
estimate the performance of the query at retrieving
relevant documents. This inference can be used to
tune the retrieval settings to maximize the overall
system effectiveness. QPP is divided into pre-
and post-retrieval methods. In pre-retrieval QPP,
prediction is based on analysing the query difficulty
(Hauff et al., 2008; He and Ounis, 2004; He and
Ounis, 2006). The estimated query difficulty
defines that, given a certain query, whether relevant
content is hard (low retrieval performance) or
easy (high retrieval performance) to find. Thus,
difficulty can be used as an indication of the
retrieval performance of the current query. In
post-retrieval QPP, the retrieval results of the query
are analysed to estimate its performance (Kurland
et al., 2011; Shtok et al., 2012). Pre-retrieval
methods are more efficient than post-retrieval,
causing less overhead to the retrieval system since
no retrieval is required for the prediction. In
this work we study the application of both pre-
and post- methods QPP to predict the translation

4https://www.microsoft.com/en-
us/translator/translatorapi.aspx

quality of queries in CLIR. In the next sections we
describe the QPP approaches we use in this task.

3.1 Pre-retrieval QPP

Existing approaches to pre-retrieval QPP are based
on measuring the statistics/characteristics of the
query terms calculated over the index collection.
The most widely used and effective techniques
rely on the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
of query terms, called IDF-based QPP. IDF-based
QPP approaches are implemented by taking an
aggregation of the IDF values across the query
terms such as AvIDF (Average of IDF values), the
SUMIDF (the sum of all values) or MAXIDF (the
maximum value) (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002).
The IDF value for a term in this work has generally
been calculated using the INQUERY formula
explained in (Allan et al., 1995) and (He and
Ounis, 2006). Another common IDF-based QPP is
the Averaged Inverse Collection Term Frequency
(avICTF) of the query terms (Plachouras et al.,
2004; He and Ounis, 2006). The formula for this
predictor is explained in detail in (He and Ounis,
2006). IDF-based predictors have shown positive
correlation with query performance over multiple
standard IR tasks (Plachouras et al., 2004; He and
Ounis, 2004; Hauff et al., 2008; Hauff, 2010).

Other pre-retrieval QPP methods are based on
analysing the linguistic features of the query terms
such as the the query length (AvQL) which is
based on the average number of content words
(non stop-words) in a query (He and Ounis, 2004;
Mothe and Tanguy, 2005; He and Ounis, 2006),
and Query Scope (QS) which makes use of the
document frequencies (DF) of the terms (He and
Ounis, 2004; He and Ounis, 2006). A higher DF
of the query terms indicates that they are very
common, and so probably not helpful for finding
relevant documents, as they would result in a lower
effectiveness of the query.

A more complex technique proposed by Zhao
et al. (2008), is the Summed Collection Query sim-
ilarity (SCQ). SCQ approaches utilise both Term
Frequency (TF) and IDF to predict the query per-
formance. Similar to the IDF-based QPP, there are
also three different aggregation methods of SQC
across the query terms. AvSQC, takes the average
across the query terms; SumSQC, which takes
the sum of all resultant similarities; and MaxSQC
which takes the maximum value among them.
SQC is explained in detail in (Zhao et al., 2008;
Hauff, 2010). Zhao et al. (2008) also proposed
another QPP method that is computationally more
expensive called VarTFIDF. which is based on

102



the distribution of the TF.IDF weights (Zobel and
Moffat, 2006) across the query terms. Similar to
SQC and IDF QPP approaches, VarTFIDF QPP has
a three different versions (SUM,MAX,Avg) based
on the used aggregation across the query terms.

In this work, we argue that IDF is not a good
predictor for this task. This argument is also sup-
ported by our initial investigation of the problem
and the following hypothesis. By definition, IDF
gives a higher weight to unique terms across the
search collection. While this might be useful for a
retrieval model to rank documents, using IDF is not
reliable for QPP since it also gives high values for
translation candidates which are misleading terms.
We define misleaders as terms that are rare across
the collection (hence having high IDF values), but
not relevant to the topic of the current query. These
misleaders can result in query topic drift (Mitra et
al., 1998) and thus negatively impact on retrieval
effectiveness. Another source of misleader terms
is words which are Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) with
respect to the MT. In this situation the MT system
produces incorrect translations of terms which the
MT system cannot by definition translate correctly.

To deal with misleaders arising from IDF issues,
we propose a new simple prediction technique
which we refer to as the Average Term Fluency
(AvgFL). Term fluency estimates whether a query
contains the same terms that appear in relevant doc-
uments. Higher fluency is assumed to lead to better
query-document matching, and hence improved
QPP effectiveness. We rely on the collection
frequency (cf) of each term to indicate its fluency
on the given collection D. The cf is normalized by
the DF to penalize non-helpful terms which appear
in all documents in collection. The proposed
AvgFL is calculated as shown in Equation (1);
where k is the number of t terms in query Q, cft
is the cf which is the number of times t appears
in the collection D. dft indicates the DF which is
the number of documents contains the term t.

3.2 Post-Retrieval QPP

State-of-the-art post-retrieval QPP techniques use
information induced from analyzing the retrieval
scores Score(d) of the results set Dq [res] produced
by retrieval method M , where Dq [res] represents
the list of document ids retrieved for a query
together with their ranks Ri and scores Score(d)
sorted according to their relevancy to a query q.

In probabilistic terms, the resultant score
Score(d) of a document d represents the estimated
relevance probability r of a document d with
respect to q Score(d) ≡ P(d|q, r). These QPP
methods are based on analyzing the performance
of the top k ranked documents, which includes
all documents that have rankRi that is less than k
(∀d�Dq [res]dRi where 06ri6k) (Zhou and Croft,
2007; Shtok et al., 2012).

WIG is a well-established QPP technique based
on the weighted entropy of the top k ranked
documents (Zhou and Croft, 2007). This technique
works by comparing the scores of the top-k doc-
uments ∀d�Dq [k]Score(d) to that obtained by the
corpus Score(D). WIG is defined in equation (2).

WIG(q,M)= 1
k

d�Dk

1√
|q| (Score(d)−Score(D)) (2)

Another similar post-retrieval QPP technique
is the Normalised Query Commitment (NQC)
(Shtok et al., 2012). This technique is based on
estimating the potential amount of query drift
in the list of top k documents by measuring the
standard deviation of their obtained retrieval scores.
A high standard deviation indicates reduced
topic drift and hence probable improved retrieval
effectiveness. NQC is defined in equation (3)
where µ= 1k

Score(d).
NQC(q,M)= 1

(3)
Both WIG and NQC are tuned to have a strong
linear relationship with the performance of the
query in which the only variable that needs to be
decided is the top-k documents.

For our task, we introduce a modified version of
the WIG called Weighted Relevancy Gain (WRG)
that focuses on the scores of the top-ranked as-
sumed relevant documents vs other top-ranked but
assumed non-relevant documents. Unlike previous
predictors, this approach assumes that the set top-k
documents Dq [k] for each query is composed of
two subsets Dq [rel] and Dq [nrel] defined as follows:
Dq

[rel] is the set of rel relevant documents that
are assumed relevant for query q where ∀d�Dq [res]
(dRi where 0 6Ri6 rel < k), and Dq [nrel] is the
set of documents that are assumed non-relevant
and ineffective for Relevancy. These documents
are ranked among the top-k documents and right
after the rel documents (rel < nrel < k) as in
∀d�Dq [res] (dRi where rel<Ri6nrel).

The WRG predictor aims to analyze the
quality of the rel documents by measuring the
likelihood that they contain significant variation.
This is estimated by measuring the weighted
entropy of the assumed rel documents against the

103



top-ranked yet non-relevant nrel set of documents.
Unlike WIG, which uses the centroid of all
non-relevant documents (Score(D)), WRG uses
the centroid of the nrel documents scores :
Cnrel≡Cent(Score(Dq [nrel]))≡ 1nrel

∑
d�Dq

[nrel] Score(d)

as a reference point for estimating of the
effectiveness as shown in equation (4).

WRG(q,Drel)=
1
rel

∑
d�Drel

1√|q|( CnrelScore(d))
(4)

WRG requires 2 parameters: the number of rel
documents and the number of nrel documents to
perform the actual estimation.

4 Using QPP for CLUGS

We propose to utilize QPP for CLUGS as follows.
Assume Tq is an MT translated version of q and
Tq

[n] is the list of n-best translations generated
by an MT translation system T . Assuming Q is
the event of being an effective translation of q
for getting relevant content in CLUGS, the goal
of this prediction task is to estimate P(Tq|q,Q)
(the likelihood of the translation Tq given that a
relevance event happens for q), which seeks to
answer the following question :
What is the probability P(.) for each translation
candidate Tq from the top n-list generated by
translation system T being an effective translation
Q of a query q for CLUGS?
Our proposed framework relies on QPP to rank the
best translations Tq [n] generated by MT system T
based on the probability function P(Tq|q,Q). We
use the previously explained QPP methods in sec-
tion 3 to predict the retrieval effectiveness of each
translation candidate Tq. For example, we assume
that AvICTF can be taken as prediction function F
to indicate the effectiveness of translations candi-
dates Tq as P(Tq|q,Q) ≡ F(Tq) ≡ AvICTF (Tq).

5 Experimental Setup

In order to evaluate QPP for our CLUGS task
we configured three modules as follows. A CLIR
system, an MT system to generate the N-best
translations, and a QPP system to parse each query
candidate of the n-best list and assign a prediction
value to it.

The CLUGS task is similar to the one described
in (Khwileh et al., 2015). The task is based on the
blip1000 collection which contains 14,838 tran-
scripts automatically extracted using an ASR sys-
tem from videos which were uploaded to a video-
sharing website by 2,237 different uploaders, cover-
ing a 25 different topics (Schmiedeke et al., 2013).

For the query topic set, we use a modified
monolingual adhoc version of the 60 different
original English topics developed within the
MediaEval 2012 Search and Hyperlinking task5

which was developed by Khwileh et al. (2016).
To setup the CLIR system, similar to the

procedure adopted in our earlier investigation
(2015), we used two native Arabic (AR) speakers
who are also fluent on English (EN) to write their
equivalent versions of the queries in Arabic for
each of these EN topics.

We configured and trained an AR-to-EN MT
system to translate each AR query to EN. Our MT
system is a phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003), that
is developed using the Moses Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).
Word alignments in both directions were calculated
using a multi-threaded version of the GIZA++ 6

tool (Gao and Vogel, 2008). The parameters of our
MT system were tuned on a development corpus
using Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003).
The AR-to-En MT system was trained using the
bilingual training corpora listed in Table 1 from
LDC for MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) training.
The size of the tuning set is 111.8K and 138.2K
of Arabic and English tokens. All AR data are
tokenised using MADA-ARZ version 0.4 (Habash
et al., 2013).

We extracted the top 100 translations list for

overall number of query candidates generated by
was 5,863 with an average of over 90 different
translations per query. These queries were used in
searching the EN ASR transcripts extracted from
the blip1000 collection.

IR component of our experimental setup. Stop

words were removed based on the standard Terrier
list, and stemming performed using the Terrier
implementation of Porter stemming. Retrieval was
carried out using the PL2 retrieval model using
the settings recommended for this CLUGS task
in Khwileh et al. (Khwileh et al., 2016), with
the empirically-determined hyper-parameters that
c=1.

5.1 Parameters
Tuning for the Post-retrieval QPP

As explained in section 3.2, post-retrieval QPP
methods require some parameters to be tuned. For
the experiments reported in this work, we used the
following approach to tune NQC, WIG and WRG.
We used the optimal paradigm, proposed in (Shtok
et al., 2012), that is based on using values of free
parameters that yield optimal prediction perfor-
mance for each predictor on set of queries. We
used the 60 monolingual EN queries as test set to
obtain these optimal parameters for each predictor.
Parameters k (in WIG and NQC), rel and nrel (in
WRG) were tuned through manual data sweeping
within the range of [5, 100] with an interval of
5, and through the range of [100,500] with an
interval of 50. The optimal k parameters obtained
for WIG was 10, while for NQC it was 150, these
are indeed similar to those recommended in (Shtok
et al., 2012). For the WRG, we found that 30 is
the optimal parameter for rel and 60 for nrel.

6 Evaluating Prediction Quality

The effectiveness of QPP methods is usually
evaluated by measuring correlation between
values assigned by the QPP method and the actual
performance, in terms of average precision (AP),
of each query. The quality of each predictor is
evaluated in our CLUGS task by measuring the
Pearson linear correlation coefficient ρ between
both the AP, which is measured using human
relevant assessment for each candidate translation
for extracted 100-best and the values assigned to
these queries by each prediction method. For each
predictor, we follow the implementation reported
in the citation shown in the first column of Table
2. For the SQC and VarTFIDF, we report only the
best result obtained out of the three aggregations
(Max, Avg and Sum) due to space limitations. In
addition to Pearson’s correlation, we also tested
Kendalls tau and Spearman correlations to report
the nonlinear relationship between these predictors
and the retrieval performance. The prediction
quality for each of these predictors on our CLUGS
task is shown in Table 2.

6.1 Pre-retrieval Quality

As can be seen from the results shown in Table 2,
IDF-based predictors are found to have the least
robustness across other predictors. The reliability
issue regarding misleading terms (as discussed in
section 3.1) significantly impacts the prediction
quality of these predictors. To further illustrate this
issue, consider the example query
. �I. K
ñË@ ©

�̄ @ñÓ �ém.×QK. ð Õæ
Ò
�JË �H@QK
ñ�J 	̄ñ

This query has two candidates EN translations (T1
and T2) as follows:
T1 : “ �H@QK
ñ�J 	̄ñ
for the development and web design” and
T2 : “ �H@QK
ñ�J 	̄ñ for the development and design
internet”.

The main difference between these translations
is “web” vs “internet”. While the word “internet”
is more unique term with a higher IDF value, it
is considered as a misleader to this query since it
shifts the original topic of the query “web design”.
Thus, this has resulted in a query topic-drift, and
hence a false prediction of its performance.

In contrast, prediction quality is improved for
all QPP methods which are less focused on the
uniqueness of the terms and do not rely solely on
the IDF in its calculation (i.e. Qs, SQC). AvgFL
is shown to have the highest quality over all tested
QPP methods, showing a consistent statistically
significant prediction across different correlation
measures. This arises as result of its robustness in
utilising the fluency measure to discriminate be-
tween different translations, penalising these which
are OOV or very unique words in the collection.

6.2 Post-retrieval Quality

The post-retrieval QPP methods are more robust
and perform better than the pre-retrieval methods
overall. This is due to the fact that post-retrieval
methods are based on the actual scores of the
translations in which at least one retrieval run
was used for the prediction. Unlike, pre-retrieval
methods, post-retrieval requires exhaustive
parameter tuning, as explained in section 5.1. Both
parameter tuning and the time required to generate
the post-retrieval QPP was a major efficiency issue
by comparison to pre-retrieval QPR (average time
to generate the pre-retrieval QPPs was around 10%
to that of the post-retrieval QPPs). WRG has the
highest prediction quality across all predictors.
The robustness of WRG is due to the fact that it
relies on stronger evidence; which is the score of
the relevant documents. While NQC/WIG rely
only on one parameter, i.e. the top k ranked doc-

uments, WRG relies on further tuning of the top k
parameter into both the rel and nrel documents to
provide better estimation. This, on one hand, helps
WRG to identify relevant translations that can in
fact distinguish the relevant document from the
non relevant ones, but on the other hand, raises effi-
ciency concerns about WRG, since it takes almost
twice the time required for WIG/NQC tuning.

7 Finding
Relevant Translations in CLUGS

In this section, we investigate the potential for these
QPP techniques to be used in an adaptive CLIR
algorithm that is able to automatically identify the
most relevant translations. The main idea is to use
the translation candidate that is predicted to have
the highest retrieval effectiveness for each query.
Using the same settings explained in section 5, we
implement the adaptive CLIR algorithm as follows.
1. For each query, the MT system is used to

generate up to the 100-best possible translations
which form a selection pool.

2. QPP is used to score each translation candidate
from the selection pool based on its estimated
retrieval performance.

3. Retrieval is then performed using the translation
that is predicted to be most effective.
We investigate using all QPP methods 8 shown

in Table 2 to evaluate this adaptive CLIR algorithm.
We compare these adaptive CLIR techniques to

three baselines as follows:
Google translate as example of an off-shelf black-
box MT tool, similar to our work in (Khwileh et al.,
2015); SingleBest, which is the 1-best translation
output generated by Moses MT;
100BestAP, which uses the ground-truth data to get
the best performing translation in terms of AP from
the 100-best translations generated by Moses MT.

8We used the same parameters learned for post-retrieval
QPP in 5.1

The adaptive and baseline retrieval performance
results for the CLIR experiments are shown in
Table 3 in terms of the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) obtained. For clarity, we also report the
percentage of improvement over each of these
baselines as an additional columns (i.e. the over
SingleBest column indicates the improvement in
MAP over the SingleBest baseline).

The Baseline CLIR results from Table 3 show
that black-box Google MT out-performed the
SingleBest output from the open-box Moses by
11.8% which confirms the previously reported
results in (Leveling et al., 2009b) that using
black-box MT can be easier and more effective
than just using the Singlebest. On the other
hand, the result from the open-box with ideal AP
(100BestAP) confirms that the open-box MT can
indeed be improved by looking at other translations
candidates that are more relevant for CLIR.

The Adaptive CLIR using Pre-Retrieval block of
Table 3 shows how pre-retrieval QPP can be used to
find the best translation from the 100-best extracted.
This confirms the conclusion obtained from Table 2
where the proposed method is the most effective in
getting the single best translation for CLIR with ef-
fectiveness comparable to that of the black box MT
system and obtained 11% performance improve-
ment over the SingleBest baseline. The Adaptive
CLIR using Post-Retrieval block of Table 3 shows
how the post-retrieval QPP methods are the most
effective for finding the most effective translation
in CLIR. This confirms previously reported conclu-
sions on comparing pre-retrieval and post-retrieval,
i.e. that post-retrieval QPP is always more effective
(Hauff, 2010). The WRG predictor is the most ef-
fective with significant improvement 28% over the
SingleBest and 14% over the black-box. This also
confirms that the correlation results reported in Ta-
ble 2 where WRG has the highest correlation to AP
when it comes to predicting the translation quality.

Overall, results from Table 3 indicate that
QPP techniques can indeed help re-ranking the
translation candidates of open-box MT, and hence
improve its translation quality for CLIR purposes.
Both AvgFL and WRG predictors, which were
designed specifically for this task, served as an
adequate reference to find the most effective trans-
lations and improve over the SingleBest output that
is suggested originally by the MT system. How-
ever, none of the reported adaptive CLIR results
were able to match or even come close to the ideal
performance baseline (100BestAP). This suggests
that there is still scope for further improvement.
By contrast, these QPP methods are a stand-alone
IR metric that is completely unsupervised and
works on a query-by-query basis. Training a
machine-learning algorithm that combines several
QPPs together with other MT-based signals may
achieve more robust/accurate prediction for this
task. We leave this investigation for future work.

8 Conclusions

This paper has presented a framework for pre-
dicting translation quality for a CLUGS task.
We proposed a novel unsupervised approach
to estimate the effectiveness of a translation
when there is no human evaluation of retrieval
available. Our experimental investigation reveals
that IDF-based prediction is not effective for this
task because of the misleading very unique terms
which can result in unreliable prediction. We
proposed a new Pre-retrieval QPP technique for
this task called AvgFL that is designed to detect
misleading very unique and OOV words.

For post-retrieval QPP, we also proposed WRG
(Weighted Relevancy Gain) that is modified
version of the well-established WIG predictor

(Zhou and Croft, 2007) and tuned to focus on the
information entropy of the relevant documents.
Our experimental investigation reports the robust-
ness of these proposed approaches in predicting the
translation effectiveness for an Ar-to-En CLUGS
task over other state-of-art QPP methods. We
found that post-retrieval QPP can be more accurate
than pre-retrieval QPP for this task, although it
suffers from efficiency issues. Finally, our exper-
iments demonstrated how these predictors could
be utilised by a CLIR model that is adaptively able
to find the most-relevant translations for IR.

For future work, we plan to experiment with
combining different QPP techniques together with
other MT-based signals for improved prediction
quality. We also plan to use the proposed frame-
work to develop a new CLIR model to estimate the
translation quality from different MT systems with
different translation outputs.
