Abstract 

This paper presents the metadata schema for 

describing language resources (LRs) cur-

rently under development for the needs of 

META-SHARE, an open distributed facility 

for the exchange and sharing of LRs. An es-

sential ingredient in its setup is the existence 

of formal and standardized LR descriptions, 

cornerstone of the interoperability layer of 

any such initiative. The description of LRs 

is granular and abstractive, combining the 

taxonomy of LRs with an inventory of a 

structured set of descriptive elements, of 

which only a minimal subset is obligatory; 

the schema additionally proposes recom-

mended and optional elements. Moreover, 

the schema includes a set of relations cater-

ing for the appropriate inter-linking of re-

sources. The current paper presents the main 

principles and features of the metadata 

schema, focusing on the description of text 

corpora and lexical / conceptual resources.

2 Introduction 

The very diverse and heterogeneous landscape 

of huge amounts of digital and digitized re-

sources collections (publications, datasets, 

multimedia files, processing tools, services and 

applications) has drastically transformed the 

requirements for their publication, archiving, 

discovery and long-term maintenance. Digital 

repositories provide the infrastructure for de-

scribing and documenting, storing, preserving, 

and making this information publicly available 

in an open, user-friendly and trusted way. Re-

positories represent an evolution of the digital 

libraries paradigm towards open access, ad-

vanced search capabilities and large-scale dis-

tributed architectures.  

META-SHARE (www.meta-share.eu) is a 

sustainable network of repositories of lan-

guage data, tools and related web services 
documented with high-quality metadata, ag-

gregated in central inventories allowing for 

uniform search and access to resources.  

In the context of META-SHARE, the term 

metadata refers to descriptions of Language 

Resources, encompassing both data sets (tex-

tual, multimodal/multimedia and lexical data, 

grammars, language models etc.) and tools / 

technologies / services used for their 

processing. 

3 Design principles for the metadata 
model 

The metadata descriptions constitute the means 

by which LR users identify the resources they 

seek. Thus, the META-SHARE metadata 

model (Gavrilidou et al., 2010) forms an 

integral part of the search and retrieval me-

chanism, with a subset of its elements serving 

as the access points to the LRs catalogue. The 

model must therefore be as informative and 

flexible as possible, allowing for multi-faceted 

search and viewing of the catalogue, as well as 

dynamic re-structuring thereof, offering LR 

consumers the chance to easily and quickly 

spot the resources they are looking for among 

84



a large bulk of resources. Although META-

SHARE aims at an informed community (HLT 

specialists), this is by no means interpreted as a 

permission to create a complex schema; user-

friendliness of the search interface should be 

supported by a well motivated, easy-to-

understand schema. 

In this effort, we have built upon three main 

building blocks: 

(a) study of previous initiatives (the most 
widespread in the LT area metadata models & 

LR catalogue descriptions
1
). The study has 

focused on the following issues: LR typolo-

gies, metadata elements currently in use and/or 

recommended, value types and obligatoriness 

thereof. 

(b) user requirements, as collected through 
a survey conducted in the framework of the 

project (Federmann et al., 2011). 

(c) the recommendations of the e-IRG re-
port of ESFRI (e-IRG, 2009), in what concerns 

its purpose of usage, its aims and its features.  

The basic design principles of the META-

SHARE model are: 

 semantic clarity: clear articulation of a 
term's meaning and its relations to other terms  

 expressiveness: successful description of 
any type of resource 

 flexibility: provision of complete descrip-
tions of resources but also of minimal but in-

formative descriptions  

 customisability: adequate description of 
all types of resources (from the provider's 

perspective) and identification of the appropri-

ate resource (user's perspective).  

 interoperability (for exchange and har-
vesting purposes): mappings to at least the

Dublin Core metadata & other widely used 

schemas and link of all elements to the ISOcat 

Data Categories  

 user friendliness: provision of an editor to 
aid LR description  

 extensibility: allow for future extensions, 
as regards both the model itself and the cover-

age of more resource types as they become 

available.  

 harvestability: allow harvesting of the 
metadata (OAI-compatible). 

4 The metadata model essentials 

As a general framework, the mechanism we 

have decided to adopt is the component-based 

mechanism proposed by the ISO DCR model 

grouping together semantically coherent ele-

ments which form components and providing 

relations between them (Broeder et al., 2008). 

More specifically, elements are used to encode 

specific descriptive features of the LRs, while 

relations are used to link together resources 

that are included in the META-SHARE reposi-

tory (e.g. original and derived, raw and anno-

tated resources, a language resource and the 

tool that has been used to create it etc.), but 

also peripheral resources such as projects that 

created the LRs, standards used, related docu-

mentation etc.  

The set of all the components and elements 

describing specific LR types and subtypes 

represent the profile of this type. Obviously, 

certain components include information com-

mon to all types of resources (e.g. identifica-

tion, contact, licensing information etc.) and 

are, thus, used for all LRs, while others (e.g. 

components including information on the con-

tents, annotation etc. of a resource) differ 

across types. The LR provider will be pre-

sented with proposed Profiles for each type, 

which can be used as templates or guidelines 

for the completion of the metadata description 

of the resource. Experience has proved that LR 

providers need guidelines and help in the 

process of metadata addition to their resources, 

and the Profiles are to be interpreted in this 

way and not as rigid structures to be adhered 

to.  

In order to accommodate flexibility, the 

elements belong to two basic levels of descrip-

tion:  

 an initial level providing the basic ele-
ments for the description of a resource (mi-

nimal schema), and  

85



 a second level with a higher degree of 
granularity (maximal schema), providing more 

detailed information on each resource and cov-

ering all stages of LR production and use. 

This has advantages for addition of metadata 

descriptions from scratch in two steps, first 

implementing the minimal schema, and subse-

quently, but not necessarily, the maximal 

schema. Harvesting is also served better by 

distinguishing between the two levels. Finally, 

LRs consumers can initially identify the re-

sources best suited for their needs through the 

first level, and by accessing the second level, 

inspect the exact features of the resource.  

The minimal schema contains those ele-

ments considered indispensable for LR de-

scription and identification. It takes into ac-

count the views expressed in the user survey 

concerning which features are considered suf-

ficient to give a sound "identity" to a resource.  

It is considered as the "guarantee level" for 

interoperability as regards LR identification 

and metadata harvesting.  

These two levels contain four classes of 

elements:  

 the first level contains Mandatory (M) and 
Condition-dependent Mandatory (MC) ele-

ments (i.e. they have to be filled in when spe-

cific conditions are met), while  

 the second level includes Recommended 
(R, i.e. LRs producers are advised to include 

information on these elements) and Optional 

(O) elements. 

For each element, the appropriate field type 

has been chosen among the following options: 

free text, closed list of values, open list of val-

ues (recommended values are provided but 

users can add their own), numeric fields and 

special fields (e.g. urls, dates, phone numbers 

etc.). Special attention has been given to the 

choice of the field type, taking into considera-

tion user requirements and metadata providers' 

practices; the intention has been to balance 

appropriately user-added with system-driven 

values in order to make the most of each ap-

proach. Consistency checking of user-added 

values will enhance the final results in the 

course of the META-SHARE operation.  

Currently, the schema has been imple-

mented as an XML schema (XSD), while im-

plementation in RDF is also under considera-

tion.

2
  In the current version, all relations are 

represented in the form of elements. 

To cater for semantic interoperability with 

other metadata schemas, all elements will be 

linked to existing ISOcat DCR data categories 

(ISO 12620, 2009) and, if they have no coun-

terpart, they will be added to the DCR with 

appropriate definitions.  

5 The META-SHARE ontology 

META-SHARE takes a more global view on 

resources, which aims to provide users not on-

ly with a catalogue of LRs (data and tools) but 

also with information that can be used to en-

hance their exploitation. For instance, research 

papers that document the production of a re-

source as well as standards and best practice 

guidelines can play an informative role for LR 

users and an advisory role for prospective LR 

producers; similarly, information on the usage 

of a certain resource, as pointed out in the user 

interviews, is considered valuable for LR users 

wishing to find whether a certain resource is 

appropriate for their own application and the 

steps that they should take to get the best re-

sults.  

Thus, the metadata model and its associated 

taxonomy should cover all types of resources 

(in the broad sense) to be included in META-

SHARE. 

In the proposed META-SHARE ontology, a 

distinction is made between LR per se and all 

other related resources/entities, such as:  

 reference documents related to the re-
source (e.g. papers, reports, manuals etc.) 

 persons and organizations involved in 
their creation and use (e.g. creators, funders, 

distributors etc.) 

 related projects and activities (e.g. fund-
ing projects, activities of usage etc.) 

 licenses (for the distribution of the LRs). 
In the META-SHARE ontology, some of 

the entities will correspond to digital objects: 

for instance, all LRs descriptions will have a 

pointer to the resource itself, licenses and ref-

erence documents will point to document files 

(included in META-SHARE) etc. Entities such 

as persons and organizations, of course, can 

optionally be linked to external links (e.g. URL 

pointers for personal webpages). All these enti-

ties will be included in META-SHARE only so 

far as they are related to a LR.  

The metadata model focuses on LRs per se 

(data and tools). For all other entities of the 

ontology, we take into account metadata sche-

mas and relevant formats that have been de-

86



vised specifically for them, e.g. CERIF for re-

search entities (projects, actors etc.), BibTex 

for bibliographical references etc.  

6 Proposed LR taxonomy 

Central to the model is the LR taxonomy, 

which allows us to organize the resources in a 

more structured way, taking into consideration 

the specificities of each type.  

The study of the existing LR taxonomies has 

revealed their diversity, which hampers the 

request for interoperability.
3
 

The proposed LR taxonomy constitutes an 

integral part of the metadata model, whereby 

the types of LRs (attributes and values) belong 

to the element set. The resourceType is the 

basic element according to which the LR types 

and subsequently the specific profiles are de-

fined and may take one of the following val-

ues:  

 corpus (including written/text, 
oral/spoken, multimodal/multimedia corpora) 

 lexical / conceptual resource (includ-
ing terminological resources, word lists, se-

mantic lexica, ontologies etc.) 

 language description (including 
grammars, language models, typological data-

bases, courseware etc.)  

 technology / tool / service (including 
basic processing tools, applications, web ser-

vices etc. required for processing data re-

sources) 

 evaluation package (for packages of 
datasets, tools and metrics used for evaluation 

purposes).  

It should be noted here that, according to the 

practice of the HLT community, the term "lan-

guage resource" is reserved for a collec-

tion/compilation of items (text, audio files 

etc.), mainly of considerable size or (in the

onomy discrepancies, cf. Gavrilidou et al. (2011). 

case of tools) able to perform a well-defined 

task. Parts of LRs clearly identifiable can also 

be considered as LRs on their own: for in-

stance, monolingual components of multilin-

gual corpora can (and should) be regarded as 

monolingual corpora themselves. But the focus 

is on the set rather than the unit (e.g. single 

text / audio file, in the case of corpora, or word 

/ entry, in the case of lexica). 

Further sub-classification is dependent upon 

sets of type-dependent features, which allow 

the viewing of the same resource along mul-

tiple dimensions. Thus, for instance language 

as an organizing feature can be used to bring 

together monolingual corpora / lexica and mo-

nolingual parts of multilingual corpora / lexica. 

Similarly, domain, format, annotation features 

etc. can be used as different dimensions ac-

cording to which the catalogue of LRs can be 

accessed.  

7  Contents of the model 

The core of the model is the ResourceInfo 

component (Figure 1), which contains all the 

information relevant for the description of a 

LR. It subsumes components and elements that 

combine together to provide this description. A 

broad distinction can be made between the 

"administrative" components, which are com-

mon to all LRs, and the components that are 

idiosyncratic to a specific LR type (e.g. Corpu-

sInfo, LexicalConceptualResourceInfo etc., as 

explained further below). For instance, ele-

ments needed for the description of video re-

sources are only used for the specific media-

Type. 

The set of components that are common to 

all LRs are the following: 

 the IdentificationInfo component in-
cludes all elements required to identify the re-

source, such as the resource full and short 

name, the persistent identifier (PID, to be as-

 
Figure 1 - ResourceInfo - the common components for all LRs 

87



signed automatically by the system), identifiers 

attributed by the source organization or other 

entities (e.g. ELRA, LDC identifiers) etc. 

 the PersonInfo component provides in-
formation about the person that can be con-

tacted for further information or access to the 

resource 

 all information relative to versioning 
and revisions of the resource is included in the 

VersionInfo component 

 crucial is the information on the legal is-
sues related to the availability of the resource, 

specified by the DistributionInfo component, 

which provides a description of the terms of 

availability of the resource and its attached 

LicenseInfo component, which gives a descrip-

tion of the licensing conditions under which 

the resource can be used; linking to the license 

documents themselves is also possible through 

the relevant relation. 

 the ValidationInfo component provides 
at least an indication of the validation status of 

the resource (with Boolean values) and, if the 

resource has indeed been validated, further 

details on the validation mode, results etc. 

 the ResourceCreationInfo and its de-
pendent components group together informa-

tion regarding the creation of a resource (crea-

tion dates, funding information such as fund-

er(s), relevant project name etc.) 

 the UsageInfo component aims at pro-
viding information on the intended use of a 

resource (i.e. the application(s) for which it 

was originally designed) and its actual use (i.e. 

applications for which it has already been 

used, projects in which it has been exploited, 

products and publications having resulted from 

its use etc.). 

 the MetadataInfo is responsible for all 
information relative to the metadata record 

creation, such as the catalog from which the 

harvesting was made and the date of harvesting 

(in the case of harvested records) or the crea-

tion date and metadata creator (in case of 

records created from scratch using the metada-

ta editor) etc. 

 the ResourceDocumentationInfo pro-
vides information on publications and docu-

ments describing the resource; basic docu-

ments (e.g. manuals, tagset documents) can 

(and should be) included in the META-

SHARE repository; the possibility to introduce 

links to published web documents and/or im-

port bibliographic references in standard for-

mats will be catered for 

 finally, the ContentInfo component de-
scribes the essence of the resource, specifying 

the resourceType and the mediaType elements, 

which give rise to specific components, dis-

tinct for each LR type, as presented below. 

A further set of four components enjoy a 

"special" status in the sense that they can be 

attached to various components, namely Per-

sonInfo, OrganizationInfo, CommunicationInfo 

and SizeInfo. For instance, PersonInfo and Or-

ganizationInfo can be used for all per-

sons/organizations acting as resource creators, 

distributors etc. Similarly, sizeInfo can be used 

either for the size of a whole resource or, in 

combination with another component, to de-

scribe the size of parts of the resource (e.g. per 

domain, per language etc.).  

The ContentInfo component (Figure 2) is 

meant to group together descriptive informa-

tion as regards the contents of the resource. 

The elements included are: 

 description: free text of the resource 

Figure 2 - The ContentInfo component and its elements 

88



 resourceType with the values corpus, lex-
ical/conceptual resource, language description, 

technology/tool/service, evaluation package 

 mediaType (used for data resources) & 
mediaTypeCompatibility (used for tools): the 

notion of medium constitutes an important de-

scriptive and classificatory element for corpora 

but also for tools; it is preferred over the writ-

ten/spoken/multimodal distinction, as it has 

clearer semantics and allows us to view re-

sources as a set of modules, each of which can 

be described through a distinctive set of fea-

tures. The following media type values are fo-

reseen: 

 text: used for resources with only 
written medium (and modules of spoken and 

multimodal corpora),  

 audio (+ text): the audio feature set 
will be used for a whole resource or part of a 

resource that is recorded as an audio file; its 

transcripts will be described by the relevant 

Text feature set 

 image (+ text): the Image feature 
set is used for photographs, drawings etc., 

while the Text set will be reserved for its cap-

tions 

 video:  moving image (+ text) (+ 
audio (+ text): used for multi-media corpora, 

with Video for the moving image part, Audio 

for the dialogues, and Text referring to the 

transcripts of the dialogues and/or subtitles 

 sensorimotor: used for sensorimo-
tor  resources which contain data collected 

through the use of relevant equipment (gloves, 

helmets, body suits, laryngographs, etc.) and 

used to  measure the activity of non-verbal 

modalities (such as gestures, facial expres-

sions, body movements, gaze, articulatory ac-

tivity, etc.) and their interaction with objects, 

be it common objects or control sequences of 

human-machine interaction (keyboard, mouse, 

touch screen).  

A resource may consist of parts belonging to 

different types of media: for instance, a multi-

modal corpus includes a video part (moving 

image), an audio part (e.g. dialogues) and a 

text part (subtitles and/or transcription of the 

dialogues); a multimedia lexicon includes the 

text part, but also a video and/or an audio part; 

a sign language resource is also a good exam-

ple for a resource with various media types. 

Similarly, tools can be applied to resources of 

particular types of medium: e.g. a tool can be 

used both for video and for audio files.  

Each of the values of the resourceType and 

mediaType gives rise to a new component, re-

spectively: 

 CorpusInfo, LexicalConceptualResour-
ceInfo, LanguageDescriptionInfo, Technolo-

gyToolServiceInfo and EvaluationPackageInfo 

which include information specific to each LR 

type (e.g. subtypes of corpora and lexi-

cal/conceptual resources, tasks performed for 

tools etc.) 

 TextInfo, AudioInfo, VideoInfo, Im-
ageInfo and SensorimotorInfo which provide 

information depending on the media type of a 

resource; this information can be broadly de-

scribed as belonging to one of the following 

categories (all represented in the form of com-

ponents and elements): 

 content: it mainly refers to lan-
guages covered in the resource and classifica-

tory information (e.g. domains, geographic 

coverage, time coverage, setting, type of con-

tent etc.) 

 format: file format, size, duration, 
character encoding etc.; obviously, this infor-

mation is more media-type-driven (e.g. we 

have different file formats for text, audio and 

video files) 

 creation: this is to be distinguished 
from the ResourceCreationInfo which is at-

tached to the resource level; at the resource 

level, it is mainly used to give information on 

funding but also on anything that concerns the 

creation of the resource as a whole; at the me-

dia-type level, it refers to the creation of the 

specific files, e.g. the original source, the cap-

ture method (e.g. scanning and web crawling 

for texts, vs. recording methods for audio files)  

89



 linguistic information encoding: the 
relevant components include information on 

the types, theoretic models, methods, tools etc. 

used for adding linguistic information to the 

resource, which takes the form of encoding for 

lexica and annotation for corpora and tools; it 

is both resource-type- and media-type-driven 

(e.g. morpho-syntactic tagging, parsing, se-

mantic annotation is used for text files, while 

transcription, prosody annotation etc. for audio 

parts/corpora etc.). 

The mandatory generic components and 

elements thereof for the description of a re-

source (for the minimal schema) are: 

 IdentificationInfo, incl. name of the re-
source and persistent identifier 

 ContentInfo: all elements (description, 
resourceType & mediaType) are mandatory 

 DistributionInfo: availability must be 
filled in and depending on the type of availa-

bility, further elements are mandatory (e.g. 

license, distributor and distribution/access me-

dium for all available resources, types of re-

strictions for resources available under restric-

tions etc.) 

 MetadataInfo: depending on the way the 
metadata record has been created (harvesting 

vs. manual creation), a different set of ele-

ments must be filled in, some of which are au-

tomatically provided (e.g. metadataCreation-

Date vs. harvestingDate, metadataCreator vs. 

source etc.) 

 PersonInfo: at least an email must be 
provided for the contact person. 

Depending on the resource type, a further 

set of components are mandatory. 

In the next sections, we provide a more de-

tailed view of text corpora and lexical / con-

ceptual resources as exemplary cases of the 

model. 

8 Text corpora 

Text corpora are  marked as such by the ele-

ment resourceType=corpus & mediaType=text 

and their description must include a CorpusIn-

fo component and a TextInfo one (Figure 3). 

As aforementioned, here we include, alongside 

the traditional text corpora, also the textual 

parts of audio corpora (transcriptions) and vid-

eo ones (e.g. subtitles). 

Besides the generic components, the type 

dependent information for text corpora is 

represented in the following components: 

 LingualityInfo: it provides information 
on the linguality type (mono-/bi-/multilingual 

corpora) and multilinguality type of text re-

sources (parallel vs. comparable corpora) 

 LanguageInfo: it comprises information 
on the language(s) of a resource and can be 

repeated for all languages of the resource; a 

LanguageVarietyInfo component is foreseen to 

supply further information if the resource in-

cludes data in regional language varieties, di-

alects, slang etc. 

 SizeInfo: it provides information on the 
size of the whole resource but it can also be 

attached to every other component that needs a 

specification of size (e.g. size per language, 

per format etc.);  

 AnnotationInfo: it groups information 
on the annotation of text corpora, such as spe-

cification of the types of annotation level (e.g. 

segmentation, alignment, structural annotation, 

lemmatization, semantic annotation etc.), an-

notation methods and tools etc.  

The above four components are obligatory 

for all text corpora. A further set of compo-

nents are recommended: 

 
 

Figure 3 - Excerpt of the CorpusInfo component focusing on text corpora 

90



 FormatInfo: it gives information on the 
format (in the form of mime-type) of the cor-

pus 

 CharacterEncodingInfo: it includes in-
formation on character encoding of the re-

source  

 TextCorpusCreationInfo: it is used to 
provide specific information on the creation of 

the text files, as aforementioned; 

 finally, four components are used to 
give information on the classification of the 

corpus, namely: TimeCoverageInfo (for the 

time period of the texts), GeographicCovera-

geInfo (for the geographic region from which 

the texts are collected), DomainInfo (present-

ing the domains covered by the corpus) and 

TextGenreInfo (for the text genre / text type of 

the texts). 

9 Lexical / Conceptual resources 

The type dependent subschema for lexical / 

conceptual resources (LCRs) is activated if the 

resourceType element of the ContentInfo com-

ponent has the value lexicalConceptualRe-

source (Figure 4). If this condition is verified, 

the LexicalConceptualResourceInfo compo-

nent becomes mandatory. In this component a 

first mandatory element is lexicalConceptua-

lResourceType, where the provider is asked to 

define the type of LRC under description. 

There is still an open debate on what should be 

the values to be given in this part and as to 

which should be the labels thereof. An open 

list is currently proposed, its suggested values 

being: wordList; computationalLexicon; ontol-

ogy; wordnet; thesaurus; framenet; termino-

logicalResource; machineReadableDictionary. 

Providers can choose to add other values if 

they consider these not appropriate. 

Two optional components are foreseen: 

 LexicalConceptualResourceCreationIn-
fo, where information on the originalSource, a 

string field where the main sources (dictiona-

ries, grammars, lexica, corpora,) for the crea-

tion of the LCR are listed; creationMode, with 

a closed list of values (automatic, semi-

automatic, manual, mixed interactive); crea-

tionModeDetails, which allows to further spe-

cify the theoretical and practical principles that 

guided the creation of the resource; creation-

Tool, a repeatable element where either a 

string, a url or a hyperlink can be entered, the 

latter enabling the provider to create a connec-

tion between the resource and the tool(s) used 

for its development. 

 LexicalConceptualResourceEncodingIn-
fo (which is recommended) groups all informa-

tion regarding the contents of the LCR; it in-

cludes the following elements: the mandatory 

element encodingLevel with an open list of 

values (e.g. phonetics; phonology; semantics), 

the optional but more detailed linguisticInfor-

mation  with a complex set of suggested values 

of a varying degree of granularity (e.g. par-

tOfSpeech, syntax-SubcatFrame, semantics-

relations, semantics-Relations-Synonyms, se-

mantics-Relations-Antonyms etc.) and the op-

tional extratextualInformation (with values 

images, videos, soundRecordings); this last 

element can be used for multimedia lexica; if a 

more detailed account is considered appropri-

ate, the AudioInfo, VideoInfo, ImageInfo com-

ponents can also be used. 

The TextInfo and its subsumed components 

are also to be used for the description of LCRs; 

the only exceptions are the TextGenre and An-

notation components, which are specific to text 

corpora.

10 Conclusions and future work 

The current version contains, besides the gen-

eral presentation of the model, the application 

of the model to text corpora & to LCRs as pre-

sented above. The next steps include: 

 extension to other media and LR types: 
the application of the model to the remaining 

media types (audio,  video, image, sensorimo-

tor) and LR types (languageDescription; tech-

nologyToolService; evaluationPackages) is 

ongoing. In this process, the expressive power 

of the model is being tested and it is expected 

that new components and elements will arise.  

 exemplary instantiations: a set of re-
sources selected to represent all LR and media 

types is being described according to the mod-

el, in order to test its functionality; these re-

sources with their descriptions will be up-

loaded in the prototype infrastructure for test-

ing and exemplification purposes.   

 discussion with experts group: this ver-
sion of the model will be communicated to the  

metadata experts group that has been set up 

within WP7, with the purpose of getting feed-

back for its  improvement.  

 implementation of the schema for the 
description of LRs produced or collected by 

three collaborating projects, namely META-

NET4U, CESAR and META-NORD.
