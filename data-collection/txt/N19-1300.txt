Abstract

In this paper we study yes/no questions that are
naturally occurring — meaning that they are
generated in unprompted and unconstrained
settings. We build a reading comprehension
dataset, BoolQ, of such questions, and show
that they are unexpectedly challenging. They
often query for complex, non-factoid informa-
tion, and require difficult entailment-like infer-
ence to solve. We also explore the effective-
ness of a range of transfer learning baselines.
We find that transferring from entailment data
is more effective than transferring from para-
phrase or extractive QA data, and that it, sur-
prisingly, continues to be very beneficial even
when starting from massive pre-trained lan-
guage models such as BERT. Our best method
trains BERT on MultiNLI and then re-trains it
on our train set. It achieves 80.4% accuracy
compared to 90% accuracy of human anno-
tators (and 62% majority-baseline), leaving a
significant gap for future work.

1 Introduction

Understanding what facts can be inferred to be true
or false from text is an essential part of natural
language understanding. In many cases, these in-
ferences can go well beyond what is immediately
stated in the text. For example, a simple sentence
like “Hanna Huyskova won the gold medal for Be-
larus in freestyle skiing.” implies that (1) Belarus
is a country, (2) Hanna Huyskova is an athlete, (3)
Belarus won at least one Olympic event, (4) the
USA did not win the freestyle skiing event, and so
on.

To test a model’s ability to make these kinds of
inferences, previous work in natural language in-

P: The Great Storm of 1987 was a violent extratropical

cyclone which caused casualties in England, France
and the Channel Islands . . .

A: Yes. [An example event is given.]

Q: Does France have a Prime Minister and a President?
P: . . . The extent to which those decisions lie with the

Prime Minister or President depends upon . . .

exist.]

ference (NLI) proposed the task of labeling candi-
date statements as being entailed or contradicted
by a given passage. However, in practice, gen-
erating candidate statements that test for complex
inferential abilities is challenging. For instance,
evidence suggests (Gururangan et al., 2018; Jia
and Liang, 2017; McCoy et al., 2019) that simply
asking human annotators to write candidate state-
ments will result in examples that typically only
require surface-level reasoning.

In this paper we propose an alternative: we test
models on their ability to answer naturally occur-
ring yes/no questions. That is, questions that were
authored by people who were not prompted to
write particular kinds of questions, including even
being required to write yes/no questions, and who
did not know the answer to the question they were
asking. Figure 1 contains some examples from our
dataset. We find such questions often query for



2925

non-factoid information, and that human annota-
tors need to apply a wide range of inferential abili-
ties when answering them. As a result, they can be
used to construct highly inferential reading com-
prehension datasets that have the added benefit of
being directly related to the practical end-task of
answering user yes/no questions.

Yes/No questions do appear as a subset of some
existing datasets (Reddy et al., 2018; Choi et al.,
2018; Yang et al., 2018). However, these datasets
are primarily intended to test other aspects of
question answering (QA), such as conversational
QA or multi-step reasoning, and do not contain
naturally occurring questions.

We follow the data collection method used
by Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019) to gather 16,000 naturally occurring yes/no
questions into a dataset we call BoolQ (for
Boolean Questions). Each question is paired with
a paragraph from Wikipedia that an independent
annotator has marked as containing the answer.
The task is then to take a question and passage as
input, and to return “yes” or “no” as output. Fig-
ure 1 contains some examples, and Appendix A.1
contains additional randomly selected examples.

Following recent work (Wang et al., 2018), we
focus on using transfer learning to establish base-
lines for our dataset. Yes/No QA is closely related
to many other NLP tasks, including other forms
of question answering, entailment, and paraphras-
ing. Therefore, it is not clear what the best
data sources to transfer from are, or if it will
be sufficient to just transfer from powerful pre-
trained language models such as BERT (Devlin
et al., 2018) or ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). We
experiment with state-of-the-art unsupervised ap-
proaches, using existing entailment datasets, three
methods of leveraging extractive QA data, and us-
ing a few other supervised datasets.

We found that transferring from MultiNLI, and
the unsupervised pre-training in BERT, gave us the
best results. Notably, we found these approaches
are surprisingly complementary and can be com-
bined to achieve a large gain in performance.
Overall, our best model reaches 80.43% accuracy,
compared to 62.31% for the majority baseline and
90% human accuracy. In light of the fact BERT
on its own has achieved human-like performance
on several NLP tasks, this demonstrates the high
degree of difficulty of our dataset. We present our
data and code at https://goo.gl/boolq.

2 Related Work

Yes/No questions make up a subset of the read-
ing comprehension datasets CoQA (Reddy et al.,
2018), QuAC (Choi et al., 2018), and Hot-
PotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and are present in
the ShARC (Saeidi et al., 2018) dataset. These
datasets were built to challenge models to under-
stand conversational QA (for CoQA, ShARC and
QuAC) or multi-step reasoning (for HotPotQA),
which complicates our goal of using yes/no ques-
tions to test inferential abilities. Of the four, QuAC
is the only one where the question authors were
not allowed to view the text being used to an-
swer their questions, making it the best candidate
to contain naturally occurring questions. How-
ever, QuAC still heavily prompts users, including
limiting their questions to be about pre-selected
Wikipedia articles, and is highly class imbalanced
with 80% “yes” answers.

The MS Marco dataset (Nguyen et al., 2016),
which contains questions with free-form text an-
swers, also includes some yes/no questions. We
experiment with heuristically identifying them in
Section 4, but this process can be noisy and the
quality of the resulting annotations is unknown.
We also found the resulting dataset is class imbal-
anced, with 80% “yes” answers.

Yes/No QA has been used in other contexts,
such as the templated bAbI stories (Weston et al.)
or some Visual QA datasets (Antol et al., 2015;
Wu et al., 2017). We focus on answering yes/no
questions using natural language text.

Question answering for reading comprehension
in general has seen a great deal of recent work (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2017), and there
have been many recent attempts to construct QA
datasets that require advanced reasoning abili-
ties (Yang et al., 2018; Welbl et al., 2018; Mi-
haylov et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2018; Zhang
et al., 2018). However, these attempts typically
involve engineering data to be more difficult by,
for example, explicitly prompting users to write
multi-step questions (Yang et al., 2018; Mihaylov
et al., 2018), or filtering out easy questions (Zellers
et al., 2018). This risks resulting in models that do
not have obvious end-use applications since they
are optimized to perform in an artificial setting. In
this paper, we show that yes/no questions have the
benefit of being very challenging even when they
are gathered from natural sources.

Natural language inference is also a well

studied area of research, particularly on the
MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) and SNLI (Bow-
man et al., 2015) datasets. Other sources of
entailment data include the PASCAL RTE chal-
lenges (Bentivogli et al., 2009, 2011) or Sci-
Tail (Khot et al., 2018). We note that, although Sc-
iTail, RTE-6 and RTE-7 did not use crowd work-
ers to generate candidate statements, they still use
sources (multiple choices questions or document
summaries) that were written by humans with
knowledge of the premise text. Using naturally
occurring yes/no questions ensures even greater
independence between the questions and premise
text, and ties our dataset to a clear end-task. BoolQ
also requires detecting entailment in paragraphs
instead of sentence pairs.

Transfer learning for entailment has been stud-
ied in GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SentE-
val (Conneau and Kiela, 2018). Unsupervised
pre-training in general has recently shown excel-
lent results on many datasets, including entailment
data (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Rad-
ford et al., 2018).

Converting short-answer or multiple choice
questions into entailment examples, as we do
when experimenting with transfer learning, has
been proposed in several prior works (Demszky
et al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018; Khot et al., 2018).
In this paper we found some evidence suggesting
that these approaches are less effective than us-
ing crowd-sourced entailment examples when it
comes to transferring to natural yes/no questions.

Contemporaneously with our work, Phang et al.
(2018) showed that pre-training on supervised
tasks could be beneficial even when using pre-
trained language models, especially for a textual
entailment task. Our work confirms these results
for yes/no question answering.

This work builds upon the Natural Questions
(NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which contains
some natural yes/no questions. However, there are
too few (about 1% of the corpus) to make yes/no
QA a very important aspect of that task. In this pa-
per, we gather a large number of additional yes/no
questions in order to construct a dedicated yes/no
QA dataset.

3 The BoolQ Dataset

An example in our dataset consists of a question,
a paragraph from a Wikipedia article, the title of
the article, and an answer, which is either “yes”

or “no”. We include the article title since it can
potentially help resolve ambiguities (e.g., corefer-
ent phrases) in the passage, although none of the
models presented in this paper make use of them.

3.1 Data Collection

We gather data using the pipeline from
NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), but with an
additional filtering step to focus on yes/no
questions. We summarize the complete pipeline
here, but refer to their paper for a more detailed
description.

Questions are gathered from anonymized, ag-
gregated queries to the Google search engine.
Queries that are likely to be yes/no questions are
heuristically identified: we found selecting queries
where the first word is in a manually constructed
set of indicator words3 and are of sufficient length,
to be effective.

Questions are only kept if a Wikipedia page is
returned as one of the first five results, in which
case the question and Wikipedia page are given to
a human annotator for further processing.

Annotators label question/article pairs in a
three-step process. First, they decide if the ques-
tion is good, meaning it is comprehensible, unam-
biguous, and requesting factual information. This
judgment is made before the annotator sees the
Wikipedia page. Next, for good questions, annota-
tors find a passage within the document that con-
tains enough information to answer the question.
Annotators can mark questions as “not answer-
able” if the Wikipedia article does not contain the
requested information. Finally, annotators mark
whether the question’s answer is “yes” or “no”.
Annotating data in this manner is quite expensive
since annotators need to search entire Wikipedia
documents for relevant evidence and read the text
carefully.

Note that, unlike in NQ, we only use ques-
tions that were marked as having a yes/no an-
swer, and pair each question with the selected pas-
sage instead of the entire document. This helps
reduce ambiguity (ex., avoiding cases where the
document supplies conflicting answers in different
paragraphs), and keeps the input small enough so
that existing entailment models can easily be ap-
plied to our dataset.

We combine 13k questions gathered from this

“were”, “have”, “has”, “can”, “could”, “will”, “would”}.

pipeline with an additional 3k questions with
yes/no answers from the NQ training set to reach
a total of 16k questions. We split these questions
into a 3.2k dev set, 3.2k test set, and 9.4k train
set, ensuring questions from NQ are always in the
train set. “Yes” answers are slightly more common
(62.31% in the train set). The queries are typically
short (average length 8.9 tokens) with longer pas-
sages (average length 108 tokens).

3.2 Analysis

In the following section we analyze our dataset to
better understand the nature of the questions, the
annotation quality, and the kinds of reasoning abil-
ities required to answer them.

3.3 Annotation Quality

First, in order to assess annotation quality, three
of the authors labelled 110 randomly chosen ex-
amples. If there was a disagreement, the au-
thors conferred and selected a single answer by
mutual agreement. We call the resulting labels
“gold-standard” labels. On the 110 selected ex-
amples, the answer annotations reached 90% ac-
curacy compared to the gold-standard labels. Of
the cases where the answer annotation differed
from the gold-standard, six were ambiguous or
debatable cases, and five were errors where the
annotator misunderstood the passage. Since the
agreement was sufficiently high, we elected to use
singly-annotated examples in the training/dev/test
sets in order to be able to gather a larger dataset.

3.4 Question Types

Part of the value of this dataset is that it contains
questions that people genuinely want to answer.
To explore this further, we manually define a set
of topics that questions can be about. An author
categorized 200 questions into these topics. The
results can be found in the upper half of Table 1.

Questions were often about entertainment me-
dia (including T.V., movies, and music), along
with other popular topics like sports. However,
there are still a good portion of questions ask-
ing for more general factual knowledge, including
ones about historical events or the natural world.

We also broke the questions into categories
based on what kind of information they were re-
questing, shown in the lower half of Table 1.
Roughly one-sixth of the questions are about
whether anything with a particular property exists
(Existence), another sixth are about whether a par-
ticular event occurred (Event Occurrence), and an-
other sixth ask whether an object is known by a
particular name, or belongs to a particular cate-
gory (Definitional). The questions that do not fall
into these three categories were split between re-
questing facts about a specific entity, or requesting
more general factual information.

We do find a correlation between the nature of
the question and the likelihood of a “yes” answer.
However, this correlation is too weak to help out-
perform the majority baseline because, even if the
topic or type is known, it is never best to guess the
minority class. We also found that question-only
models perform very poorly on this task (see Sec-
tion 5.3), which helps confirm that the questions

Reasoning Types Yes/No Question Answering Examples
Paraphrasing (38.7%) Q: Is Tim Brown in the Hall of Fame?
The passage explicitly asserts or refutes
what is stated in the question.

P: Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

A: Yes. [“inducted into” directly implies he is in Hall of Fame.]
By Example (11.8%) Q: Are there any nuclear power plants in Michigan?
The passage provides an example or
counter-example to what is asserted by
the question.

P: . . . three nuclear power plants supply Michigan with about 30% of its elec-
tricity.

A: Yes. [Since there must be at least three.]
Factual Reasoning (8.5%) Q: Was designated survivor filmed in the White House?
Answering the question requires using
world-knowledge to connect what is
stated in the passage to the question.

P: The series is. . . filmed in Toronto, Ontario.
A: No. [The White House is not located in Toronto.]

Implicit (8.5%) Q: Is static pressure the same as atmospheric pressure?
The passage mentions or describes en-
tities in the question in way that would
not make sense if the answer was not
yes/no.

P: The aircraft designer’s objective is to ensure the pressure in the aircraft’s
static pressure system is as close as possible to the atmospheric pressure. . .

A: No. [It would not make sense to bring them “as close as possible” if those
terms referred to the same thing.]

Missing Mention (6.6%) Q: Did Bonnie Blair’s daughter make the Olympic team?
We can conclude the answer is yes or
no because, if this was not the case, it
would have been mentioned in the pas-
sage.

P: Blair and Cruikshank have two children: a son, Grant, and daughter, Blair....
Blair Cruikshank competed at the 2018 United States Olympic speed skat-
ing trials at the 500 meter distance.

A: No. [The passage describes Blair Cruikshank’s daughter’s skating accom-
plishments, so it would have mentioned it if she had qualified.]

Other Inference (25.9%) Q: Is the sea snake the most venomous snake?
The passage states a fact that can be
used to infer whether the answer is true
or false, and does not fall into any of the
other categories.

P: . . . the venom of the inland taipan, drop by drop, is the most toxic among all
snakes

A: No. [If inland taipan is the most venomous snake, the sea snake must not
be.]

do not contain sufficient information to predict the
answer on their own.

3.5 Types of Inference

Finally, we categorize the kinds of inference re-
quired to answer the questions in BoolQ4. The def-
initions and results are shown in Table 2.

Less than 40% of the examples can be solved
by detecting paraphrases. Instead, many ques-
tions require making additional inferences (cate-
gories “Factual Reasoning”, “By Example”, and
“Other Inference”) to connect what is stated in the
passage to the question. There is also a signifi-
cant class of questions (categories “Implicit” and
“Missing Mention”) that require a subtler kind of
inference based on how the passage is written.

3.6 Discussion

Why do natural yes/no questions require inference
so often? We hypothesize that there are several
factors. First, we notice factoid questions that ask
about simple properties of entities, such as “Was
Obama born in 1962?”, are rare. We suspect this
is because people will almost always prefer to

4Note the dataset has been updated since we carried out
this analysis, so it might be slighly out-of-date.

phrase such questions as short-answer questions
(e.g., “When was Obama born?”). Thus, there
is a natural filtering effect where people tend to
use yes/no questions exactly when they want more
complex kinds of information.

Second, both the passages and questions rarely
include negation. As a result, detecting a “no” an-
swer typically requires understanding that a pos-
itive assertion in the text excludes, or makes un-
likely, a positive assertion in the question. This
requires reasoning that goes beyond paraphras-
ing (see the “Other-Inference” or “Implicit” exam-
ples).

We also think it was important that annotators
only had to answer questions, rather than generate
them. For example, imagine trying to construct
questions that fall into the categories of “Missing
Mention” or “Implicit”. While possible, it would
require a great deal of thought and creativity. On
the other hand, detecting when a yes/no ques-
tion can be answered using these strategies seems
much easier and more intuitive. Thus, having an-
notators answer pre-existing questions opens the
door to building datasets that contain more infer-
ence and have higher quality labels.

4 Training Yes/No QA Models

Models on this dataset need to predict an output
class given two pieces of input text, which is
a well studied paradigm (Wang et al., 2018).
We find training models on our train set alone
to be relatively ineffective. Our best model
reaches 69.6% accuracy, only 8% better than
the majority baseline. Therefore, we follow the
recent trend in NLP of using transfer learning.
In particular, we experiment with pre-training
models on related tasks that have larger datasets,
and then fine-tuning them on our training data. We
list the sources we consider for pre-training below.

Entailment: We consider two entailment
datasets, MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) and
SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015). We choose these
datasets since they are widely-used and large
enough to use for pre-training. We also ex-
periment with ablating classes from MultiNLI.
During fine-tuning we use the probability the
model assigns to the “entailment” class as the
probability of predicting a “yes” answer.

Multiple-Choice QA: We use a multiple choice
reading comprehension dataset, RACE (Lai et al.,
2017), which contains stories or short essays
paired with questions built to test the reader’s
comprehension of the text. Following what was
done in SciTail (Khot et al., 2018), we convert
questions and answer-options to statements by
either substituting the answer-option for the
blanks in fill-in-the-blank questions, or appending
a separator token and the answer-option to the
question. During training, we have models
independently assign a score to each statement,
and then apply the softmax operator between
all statements per each question to get state-
ment probabilities. We use the negative log
probability of the correct statement as a loss
function. To fine-tune on BoolQ, we apply the
sigmoid operator to the score of the question given
its passage to get the probability of a “yes” answer.

Extractive QA: We consider several meth-
ods of leveraging extractive QA datasets, where
the model must answer questions by selecting text
from a relevant passage. Preliminary experiments
found that simply transferring the lower-level
weights of extractive QA models was ineffective,
so we instead consider three methods of con-

structing entailment-like data from extractive QA
data.

First, we use the QNLI task from GLUE (Wang
et al., 2018), where the model must determine if a
sentence from SQuAD 1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
contains the answer to an input question or not.
Following previous work (Hu et al., 2018), we
also try building entailment-like training data from
SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). We concate-
nate questions with either the correct answer, or
with the incorrect “distractor” answer candidate
provided by the dataset, and train the model to
classify which is which given the question’s sup-
porting text.

Finally, we also experiment with leveraging
the long-answer portion of NQ, where models
must select a paragraph containing the answer
to a question from a document. Following our
method for Multiple-Choice QA, we train a
model to assign a score to (question, paragraph)
pairs, apply the softmax operator on paragraphs
from the same document to get a probability
distribution over the paragraphs, and train the
model on the negative log probability of selecting
an answer-containing paragraph. We only train on
questions that were marked as having an answer,
and select an answer-containing paragraph and
up to 15 randomly chosen non-answer-containing
paragraphs for each question. On BoolQ, we
compute the probability of a “yes” answer by
applying the sigmoid operator to the score the
model gives to the input question and passage.

Paraphrasing: We use the Quora Question
Paraphrasing (QQP) dataset, which consists of
pairs of questions labelled as being paraphrases or
not.5 Paraphrasing is related to entailment since
we expect, at least in some cases, passages will
contain a paraphrase of the question.

Heuristic Yes/No: We attempt to heuristi-
cally construct a corpus of yes/no questions from
the MS Marco corpus (Nguyen et al., 2016). MS
Marco has free-form answers paired with snippets
of related web documents. We search for answers
starting with “yes” or “no”, and then pair the
corresponding questions with snippets marked as
being related to the question. We call this task
Y/N MS Marco; in total we gather 38k examples,

Pairs

80% of which are “yes” answers.

Unsupervised: It is well known that unsu-
pervised pre-training using language-modeling
objectives (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018;
Radford et al., 2018), can improve performance
on many tasks. We experiment with these meth-
ods by using the pre-trained models from ELMo,
BERT, and OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (see Section 5.2).

5 Results

5.1 Shallow Models

First, we experiment with using a linear classi-
fier on our task. In general, we found features
such as word overlap or TF-IDF statistics were
not sufficient to achieve better than the majority-
class baseline accuracy (62.17% on the dev set).
We did find there was a correlation between the
number of times question words occurred in the
passage and the answer being “yes”, but the corre-
lation was not strong enough to build an effective
classifier. “Yes” is the most common answer even
among questions with zero shared words between
the question and passage (with a 51% majority),
and more common in other cases.

5.2 Neural Models

For our experiments that do not use unsupervised
pre-training (except the use of pre-trained word
vectors), we use a standard recurrent model with
attention. Our experiments using unsupervised
pre-training use the models provided by the au-
thors. In more detail:

Our Recurrent model follows a standard recur-
rent plus attention architecture for text-pair clas-
sification (Wang et al., 2018). It embeds the
premise/hypothesis text using fasttext word vec-
tors (Mikolov et al., 2018) and learned charac-
ter vectors, applies a shared bidirectional LSTM
to both parts, applies co-attention (Parikh et al.,
2016) to share information between the two parts,
applies another bi-LSTM to both parts, pools the
result, and uses the pooled representation to pre-
dict the final class. See Appendix A.2 for details.

Our Recurrent +ELMo model uses the language
model from Peters et al. (2018) to provide con-
textualized embeddings to the baseline model out-
lined above, as recommended by the authors.

Our OpenAI GPT model fine-tunes the 12
layer 768 dimensional uni-directional transformer

from Radford et al. (2018), which has been pre-
trained as a language model on the Books cor-
pus (Zhu et al., 2015).

Our BERTL model fine-tunes the 24 layer 1024
dimensional transformer from Devlin et al. (2018),
which has been trained on next-sentence-selection
and masked language modelling on the Book Cor-
pus and Wikipedia.

We fine-tune the BERTL and the OpenAI GPT
models using the optimizers recommended by the
authors, but found it important to tune the opti-
mization parameters to achieve the best results.
We use a batch size of 24, learning rate of 1e-5,
and 5 training epochs for BERT and a learning rate
of 6.25e-5, batch size of 6, language model loss of
0.5, and 3 training epochs for OpenAI GPT.

5.3 Question/Passage Only Results
Following the recommendation of Gururangan
et al. (2018), we first experiment with models that
are only allowed to observe the question or the
passage. The pre-trained BERTL model reached
64.48% dev set accuracy using just the question
and 66.74% using just the passage. Given that
the majority baseline is 62.17%, this suggests
there is little signal in the question by itself, but
that some language patterns in the passage cor-
relate with the answer. Possibly, passages that
present more straightforward factual information
(like Wikipedia introduction paragraphs) correlate
with “yes” answers.

5.4 Transfer Learning Results
The results of our transfer learning methods are
shown in Table 3. All results are averaged over
five runs. For models pre-trained on supervised
datasets, both the pre-training and the fine-tuning
stages were repeated. For unsupervised pre-
training, we use the pre-trained models provided
by the authors, but continue to average over five
runs of fine-tuning.

QA Results: We were unable to transfer
from RACE or SQuAD 2.0. For RACE, the
problem might be domain mismatch. In RACE
the passages are stories, and the questions often
query for passage-specific information such as the
author’s intent or the state of a particular entity
from the passage, instead of general knowledge.

We would expect SQuAD 2.0 to be a bet-
ter match for BoolQ since it is also Wikipedia-
based, but its possible detecting the adversarially-

better than the majority baseline, so we do not include them here.

does not relate well to yes/no QA.

We got better results using QNLI, and even
better results using NQ. This shows the task of
selecting text relevant to a question is partially
transferable to yes/no QA, although we are only
able to gain a few points over the baseline.

Entailment Results: The MultiNLI dataset
out-performed all other supervised methods by
a large margin. Remarkably, this approach is
only a few points behind BERT despite using
orders of magnitude less training data and a much
more light-weight model, showing high-quality
pre-training data can help compensate for these
deficiencies.

Our ablation results show that removing the
neutral class from MultiNLI hurt transfer slightly,
and removing either of the other classes was very
harmful, suggesting the neutral examples had
limited value. SNLI transferred better than other
datasets, but worse than MultiNLI. We suspect
this is due to limitations of the photo-caption
domain it was constructed from.

Other Supervised Results: We obtained a

Marco. Although Y/N MS Marco is a yes/no
QA dataset, its small size and class imbalance
likely contributed to its limited effectiveness. The
web snippets it uses as passages also present a
large domain shift from the Wikipedia passages in
BoolQ.

Unsupervised Results: Following results on
other datasets (Wang et al., 2018), we found
BERTL to be the most effective unsupervised
method, surpassing all other methods of pre-
training.

5.5 Multi-Step Transfer Results

Our best single-step transfer learning results were
from using the pre-trained BERTL model and



2932

MultiNLI. We also experiment with combining
these approaches using a two-step pre-training
regime. In particular, we fine-tune the pre-trained
BERTL on MultiNLI, and then fine-tune the re-
sulting model again on the BoolQ train set. We
found decreasing the number of training epochs to
3 resulted in a slight improvement when using the
model pre-trained on MultiNLI.

We show the test set results for this model, and
some other pre-training variations, in Table 4. For
these results we train five versions of each model
using different training seeds, and show the model
that had the best dev-set performance.

Given how extensively the BERTL model has
been pre-trained, and how successful it has been
across many NLP tasks, the additional gain of 3.5
points due to using MultiNLI is remarkable. This
suggests MultiNLI contains signal orthogonal to
what is found in BERT’s unsupervised objectives.

5.6 Sample Efficiency

In Figure 2, we graph model accuracy as more of
the training data is used for fine-tuning, both with
and without initially pre-training on MultiNLI.
Pre-training on MultiNLI gives at least a 5-6 point
gain, and nearly a 10 point gain for BERTL when
only using 1000 examples. For small numbers of
examples, the recurrent model with MultiNLI pre-
training actually out-performs BERTL.

5.7 Discussion

A surprising result from our work is that the
datasets that more closely resemble the format of
BoolQ, meaning they contain questions and multi-
sentence passages, such as SQuAD 2.0, RACE, or

Y/N MS Marco, were not very useful for transfer.
The entailment datasets were stronger despite con-
sisting of sentence pairs. This suggests that adapt-
ing from sentence-pair input to question/passage
input was not a large obstacle to achieving transfer.
Preliminary work found attempting to convert the
yes/no questions in BoolQ into declarative state-
ments did not improve transfer from MultiNLI,
which supports this hypothesis.

The success of MultiNLI might also be surpris-
ing given recent concerns about the generalization
abilities of models trained on it (Glockner et al.,
2018), particularly related to “annotation artifacts”
caused by using crowd workers to write the hy-
pothesis statements (Gururangan et al., 2018). We
have shown that, despite these weaknesses, it can
still be an important starting point for models be-
ing used on natural data.

We hypothesize that a key advantage of
MultiNLI is that it contains examples of contra-
dictions. The other sources of transfer we con-
sider, including the next-sentence-selection objec-
tive in BERT, are closer to providing examples of
entailed text vs. neutral/unrelated text. Indeed,
we found that our two step transfer procedure only
reaches 78.43% dev set accuracy if we remove the
contradiction class from MultiNLI, regressing its
performance close to the level of BERTL when just
using unsupervised pre-training.

Note that it is possible to pre-train a model on
several of the suggested datasets, either in succes-
sion or in a multi-task setup. We leave these ex-
periments to future work. Our results also sug-
gest pre-training on MultiNLI would be helpful for
other corpora that contain yes/no questions.

6 Conclusion

We have introduced BoolQ, a new reading com-
prehension dataset of naturally occurring yes/no
questions. We have shown these questions are
challenging and require a wide range of infer-
ence abilities to solve. We have also studied how
transfer learning performs on this task, and found
crowd-sourced entailment datasets can be lever-
aged to boost performance even on top of lan-
guage model pre-training. Future work could in-
clude building a document-level version of this
task, which would increase its difficulty and its
correspondence to an end-user application.

A.1 Randomly Selected Examples

We include a number of randomly selected exam-
ples from the BoolQ train set in Figure 3. For each
example we show the question in bold, followed
by the answer in parentheses, and then the passage
below.

A.2 Recurrent Model

Our recurrent model is a standard model from the
text pair classification literature, similar to the one
used in the GLUE baseline (Wang et al., 2018)
and the model from Chen et al. (2017). Our model
has the following stages:

Embed: Embed the words using a character
CNN following what was done by Seo et al.
(2017), and the fasttext crawl word embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2018). Then run a BiLSTM
over the results to get context-aware word hy-
pothesis embeddings 〈u1, u2, u3, ...〉 and premise
embeddings 〈v1, v2, v3, ...〉.

Co-Attention: Compute a co-attention ma-
trix, A, between the hypothesis and premise
where Aij = w1 · ui + w2 · vj + w3 · (ui ◦ vj),
◦ is elementwise multiplication, and w1, w2, and
w3 are weights to be learned.

Attend: For each row in A, apply the soft-
max operator and use the results to compute
a weighed sum of the hypothesis embeddings,
resulting in attended vectors 〈ũ1, ũ2, ...〉. We use
the transpose of A to compute vectors 〈ṽ1, ṽ2, ...〉
from the premise embeddings in a similar manner.

Pool: Run another BiLSTM over
〈[v1; ṽ1; ṽ1 ◦ v1], [v2; ṽ2; ṽ2 ◦ v2], ...〉 to get

embeddings 〈h1, h2, ...〉. Then pool these embed-
dings by computing attention scores ai = w · hi,
p = softmax(a), and then the sum v∗ =

∑
i pihi.

Likewise we compute p∗ from the premise.

Classify: Finally we feed [v∗; p∗] into a fully
connected layer, and then through a softmax layer
to predict the output class.

We apply dropout at a rate of 0.2 between
all layers, and train the model using the Adam
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014). The learning
rate is decayed by 0.999 every 100 steps. We use
200 dimensional LSTMs and a 100 dimensional
fully connected layer.

Is there a catalytic converter on a diesel? (Y)
A catalytic converter is an exhaust emission control device that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an

internal combustion engine into less-toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction (an oxidation and a reduction reaction).
Catalytic converters are usually used with internal combustion engines fueled by either gasoline or diesel–including lean-burn
engines as well as kerosene heaters and stoves.

Is there a season 2 of Pride and Prejudice? (N)
Pride and Prejudice is a six-episode 1995 British television drama, adapted by Andrew Davies from Jane Austen’s 1813

novel of the same name. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Produced by Sue Birtwistle
and directed by Simon Langton, the serial was a BBC production with additional funding from the American A&E Network.
BBC1 originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The A&E Network aired the series
in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996. There are six episodes in the series.

Is Saving Private Ryan based on a book? (N)
In 1994, Robert Rodat wrote the script for the film. Rodat’s script was submitted to producer Mark Gordon, who liked it and

in turn passed it along to Spielberg to direct. The film is loosely based on the World War II life stories of the Niland brothers.
A shooting date was set for June 27, 1997.

Is The Talk the same as The View? (N)
In November 2008, the show’s post-election day telecast garnered the biggest audience in the show’s history at 6.2 million

in total viewers, becoming the week’s most-watched program in daytime television. It was surpassed on July 29, 2010,
during which former President Barack Obama first appeared as a guest on The View, which garnered a total of 6.6 mil-
lion viewers. In 2013, the show was reported to be averaging 3.1 million daily viewers, which outpaced rival talk show The Talk.

Does the concept of a contact force apply to both a macroscopic scale and an atomic scale? (N)
In the Standard Model of modern physics, the four fundamental forces of nature are known to be non-contact forces.

The strong and weak interaction primarily deal with forces within atoms, while gravitational effects are only obvious on an
ultra-macroscopic scale. Molecular and quantum physics show that the electromagnetic force is the fundamental interaction
responsible for contact forces. The interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the
electromagnetic interactions between protons and electrons of the atomic constituents of these objects. Everyday objects
do not actually touch; rather, contact forces are the result of the interactions of the electrons at or near the surfaces of the objects.

Legal to break out of prison in Germany? (Y)
In Mexico, Belgium, Germany and Austria, the philosophy of the law holds that it is human nature to want to escape. In

those countries, escapees who do not break any other laws are not charged for anything and no extra time is added to their
sentence. However, in Mexico, officers are allowed to shoot prisoners attempting to escape, and an escape is illegal if violence
is used against prison personnel or property, or if prison inmates or officials aid the escape.
