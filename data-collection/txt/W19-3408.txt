Abstract
This study explores the relation between lexi-
cal concreteness and narrative text quality. We
present a methodology to quantitatively mea-
sure lexical concreteness of a text. We ap-
ply it to a corpus of student stories, scored
according to writing evaluation rubrics. Lex-
ical concreteness is weakly-to-moderately re-
lated to story quality, depending on story-type.
The relation is mostly borne by adjectives and
nouns, but also found for adverbs and verbs.

1 Introduction

The influential writing-style guide, The Elements
of Style (1999), (a.k.a. Strunk and White), recom-
mends writers to ‘prefer the specific to the gen-
eral, the definite to the vague, the concrete to
the abstract.’ This involves two related but dis-
tinct notions, two different senses of the word
’concrete’ - tangible and specific. Tangibility, or
the concreteness/abstractness continuum relates to
objects and properties that afford sensorial per-
ception - tangible things that can be seen, heard,
smelled and touched. The specificity notion relates
to the amount and level of detail that is conveyed
in a story, to what extent things are presented in
specific rather than general terms. The two no-
tions go hand in hand, since to provide specific
details the writer often has to mention more con-
crete objects and attributes and use less abstract
terms. There are exceptions. Emotions and states
of mind are usually not concrete (i.e. tangible)
entities, though they are often specific. Numeri-
cal quantities (e.g. 6 million dollars, 30% of the
population) are quite specific but not quite senso-
rially concrete. Still, the importance of both con-
creteness and specificity for good writing is fre-
quently mentioned in writer guides (Hacker and
Sommers, 2014), in advice to college students
(Maguire, 2012) and in recommendations for busi-
ness writers (Matson, 2017).

College writing labs often suggest that students
can improve their writing by including more con-
crete details in their essays.1 Concreteness is also
noted as an important aspect of writing literacy for
K-12 education. The Common Core State Stan-
dards2 (a federally recommended standard in the
USA) specifies the following capability for stu-
dents in Grade 6: “Develop the topic with relevant
facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or
other information and examples.” Despite its pur-
ported importance, few studies have measured lex-
ical concreteness in stories, and no studies ex-
plored a quantitative relation between concrete-
ness and story quality.

This work explores lexical concreteness in nar-
rative essays. We use a quantitative measure, uti-
lizing per-word concreteness ratings. We investi-
gate whether better stories are more concrete and
whether the story type (e.g. hypothetical situa-
tion versus personal narratives) influences the con-
creteness trends. We also perform a fine-grained
analysis by parts-of-speech (nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives and adverbs) to explore how their concrete-
ness varies with story quality.

2 Related Work

The literature on using lexical concreteness for
analysis of writing is rather limited.3 Louis and
Nenkova (2013) used imageability of words as
a feature to model quality of science-journalism
writing. For reading, concrete language was found
to be more comprehensible and memorable than
abstract language (Sadoski et al., 2000, 1993).
Concreteness has also been related to reader en-
gagement, promoting interest for expository mate-
rials (Sadoski, 2001).

Researchers have also looked at developmen-
tal aspects of mastery in producing expository
and narrative texts. Proportion of abstract nouns
in language production increases with age and
schooling, although it is more pronounced in ex-
pository than in narrative writing (Ravid, 2005).
Berman and Nir-Sagiv (2007) have found that the
proportion of very concrete nouns tends to de-
crease from childhood to adulthood, whereas the
proportion of abstract nouns tends to increase,
in both expository and narrative texts. Sun and
Nippold (2012) conducted a study in which stu-
dents ages 11-17 were asked to write a personal
story. The essays were examined for the use of
abstract nouns (e.g., accomplishment, loneliness)
and metacognitive verbs (e.g., assume, discover).
The use of both types of words significantly in-
creases with age. Goth et al. (2010) analyzed fa-
bles created by sixth graders (age 12) and found
that boys use more concrete terms than girls.

How are concrete and abstract words identi-
fied and measured is an important methodological
point. Goth et al. (2010) used the Coh-Metrix tool
(Graesser et al., 2004), which measured individ-
ual word concreteness “using the hypernym depth
values retrieved from the WordNet lexical taxon-
omy, and averaged across noun and verb cate-
gories.” Berman and Nir-Sagiv (2007) rated nouns
manually, using a four-level ordinal ranking. The
most concrete (level 1) included objects and spe-
cific people; level 2 - categorial nouns, roles and
locations (teacher, city, people). Higher abstrac-
tions were: level 3 - rare nouns (e.g., rival, cult),
and abstract but common terms such as fight, war;
level 4: low frequency abstract nouns (e.g. rela-
tionship, existence). Sun and Nippold (2012) used
a dichotomous distinction (abstract/non-abstract)
while manually rating all nouns in their data set.
Abstract nouns were defined as intangible entities,
inner states and emotions.

In psycholinguistic research, the notion of
word concreteness became prominent due to the
dual-coding theory of word representation (Pavio,
2013, 1971). Experimental studies often uti-
lize the MRC database (Coltheart, 1981), which
provides lexical concreteness ratings norms for
4,292 words. Such ratings were obtained ex-
perimentally, averaging across ratings provided
by multiple participants in rating studies. Re-
cently, Brysbaert et al. (2013) provided concrete-
ness norms for 40,000 English lemmas. This new

ity of narrative.

3 Data

We used a corpus of narrative essays4 provided by
Somasundaran et al. (2018). The corpus consists
of 940 narrative essays written by school students
from grade levels 7-12. Each essay was written in
response to one of 18 story-telling prompts. The
total size of the corpus is 310K words, and average
essay length is 330 words.

The writing prompts were classified according
to the type of story they are calling for, using the
three-fold schema from Longobardi et al. (2013)
- Fictional, Hypothetical and Personal. Table 1
presents the prompt titles, story types and essay
counts. Example prompts are shown in the ap-
pendix.

3.1 Essay scores
All essays were manually scored by experienced
research assistants (Somasundaran et al., 2018),
using a rubric that was created by education ex-
perts and teachers, and presented by Smarter
Balanced assessment consortium, an assessment
aligned to U.S. State Standards for grades K-12
(Smarter Balanced, 2014b,a).

The essays were scored along three traits (di-
mensions): Organization, Development and Con-
ventions. Organization is concerned with event
coherence, whether the story has a coherent start
and ending, and whether there is a plot to hold all
the pieces of the story together. It is scored on a
scale of 0-4 integer points. Development evaluates
whether the story provides vivid descriptions, and
whether there is character development. It is also
scored on a scale of 0-4 integer points, with 4 be-
ing the highest score. The Conventions dimension
evaluates language proficiency, and is concerned
with aspects of grammar, mechanics, and punctu-
ation. Scores are on a scale of 0-3 integer points
(3 is the highest score).

Somasundaran et al. (2018) computed Narrative
and Total composite scores for each essay. The
Narrative score (range 0-8) is the sum of Organi-
zation and Development scores. Total score (range
0-11) is the sum of Organization, Development
and Conventions. Not surprisingly, the Organiza-
tion, Development, Narrative and Total scores are
highly intercorrelated (0.88 and higher, see Table
3 in Somasundaran et al. (2018)). For the present
study, we used the Narrative scores, focusing on
essay narrative quality and de-emphasizing gram-
mar and mechanics.

Table 2: Content word counts by part-of-speech, with
counts and proportion of tokens that did not have con-
creteness scores, for 940 essays.

3.2 Concreteness scores
We focus on concreteness of only the content
words in the essays and ignore all function words.
Each essay in the data set was POS-tagged with

the Apache OpenNLP 5 tagger, and further analy-
sis filtered in only nouns, verbs, adjective and ad-
verbs. Those content words were checked against
the database of concreteness scores (Brysbaert
et al., 2013). The database provides real-valued
ratings in the 1-5 range, from very abstract (score
1) to very concrete (score 5.0). For words that
were not matched in the database, we checked if
the lemma or an inflectional variant of the word
was present in the database (using an in-house
morphological toolkit). The database does not in-
clude names, but the essays often include names
of persons and places. For our scoring, any names
(identified by POS-tags NNP or NNPS), that were
not found in the database, were assigned a uniform
concreteness score of 4.0.

Concreteness scores were accumulated for each
essay as described above. Average and median
concreteness score was computed for each es-
say, separately for each of the categories (nouns,
verbs, adjective and adverbs), and also jointly for
all content-words. The total numbers of content
words are given in Table 2. The concreteness-
ratings coverage for our data is 97.8%.

4 Results

Pearson correlations of essay scores with per-
essay levels of concreteness are presented in Table
3. Overall, the correlation of average-concreteness
with essay score is r=0.222, which is consid-
ered a weak correlation (Evans, 1996). Break-
down by parts of speech shows that adjectives
have the highest correlation of concreteness with
score (0.297), followed by that for nouns (0.251),
and adverbs (0.231). The correlation is weak-
est for verbs, only 0.122. Results for median-
concreteness per essay show a similar pattern,
though nouns now overtake adjectives.

Average C. Median C.
nouns 0.251 0.284
verbs 0.122 0.113

Next, we present the correlations of concrete-
ness levels with essay scores for each of the six
prompts that have more than 50 essays (Table
4A). For two of the prompts, Travel and At First
Glance, average concreteness of nouns is moder-
ately correlated with essay narrative score (r =
0.4). For four prompts, adjectives show weak
correlation with essay scores (from 0.21 to 0.35),
while for the Travel prompt, average concreteness
of adjectives is moderately correlated with essay
narrative score (r=0.4). For four prompts, the av-
erage concreteness of adverbs is weakly correlated
with essay score (0.24 to 0.33). For verbs, only
one prompt, Weirdest Day Ever. shows some cor-
relation of concreteness with essay score (0.33).

Next, we grouped essays by three types of story
that their prompts were classified into. This move
allows to use data from all essays. Results are pre-
sented in Table 4B. The Fictional story type has
the highest correlation of concreteness and essay
score (r=0.413), and it also has the highest cor-
relation for nouns, for adjectives and for adverbs
(as compared to other story types). Stories of the
Hypothetical type show weak (yet significant) cor-
relation of concreteness with scores, for nouns,
verbs, adjectives and overall. Interestingly, the
Personal story type shows the least relation of con-
creteness to scores, 0.138 overall; the adjectives
there have correlation of 0.237, adverbs 0.209, and
the nouns barely reach 0.2.

The results above suggest that the relation of
concreteness to essay score varies for different
story types. We checked whether the essays from
three story types differ in concreteness or qual-
ity. An analysis of variance of narrative scores

for three groups, F(2,937)=1.427, p=0.241, re-
veals that they did not differ in the average qual-
ity of stories. We also compared the average per-
essay concreteness for the three groups. Mean
concreteness for Fiction essays is 2.91, for Hypo-
thetical essays it is 2.99, and 2.90 for Personal. An
analysis of variance, F(2,937)=19.774, p<0.0001,
shows that average concreteness is not equal in
those groups. Post hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD
test) indicated that only the Hypothetical group
differed significantly from the two other groups.
Those results indicate that the different strength of
correlation between lexical concreteness and es-
say score that we observe in the three groups is not
due to between-group differences in either narra-
tive scores or lexical concreteness.

5 Conclusions

We presented a novel methodology for computing
per-text lexical concreteness scores. For student-
written stories, lexical concreteness is weakly to
moderately positively correlated with narrative
quality. Better essays score higher on lexical con-
creteness and use relatively less abstract words.
While those results support the old adage ‘prefer
the concrete to the abstract’, we also found that
this relation varies for different story-types. It is
prominent for Fictional stories, less pronounced
for Hypothetical stories, and rather weak for Per-
sonal stories. Nouns and adjectives carry this rela-
tion most prominently, but it is also found for ad-
verbs and verbs. This study lays the groundwork
towards automatic assessment of lexical concrete-
ness. In future work we will extend its application
for text evaluation and feedback to writers.

A Appendix

Example prompts for three types of text styles:

Personal Experience: “Proudest Moment” -
There are moments in everyones lives when they
feel pride and accomplishment after completing
a challenging task. Write a story about your
proudest moment.
Hypothetical Situation: “You are the Teacher” -
Pretend that one morning you wake up and find
out that you’ve become your teacher for a day!
What happened? What do you do? Do you learn
anything? Write a story about what happens. Use
your imagination!
Fictional Story: “Message in a Bottle” -
Throughout the years, many have placed mes-
sages in sealed bottles and dropped the bottles
into the ocean where they eventually washed up
