Abstract 

Vlogs provide a rich public source of data 
in a novel setting. This paper examined the 
continuous sentiment styles employed in 
27,333 vlogs using a dynamic intra-textual 
approach to sentiment analysis. Using 
unsupervised clustering, we identified 
seven distinct continuous sentiment 
trajectories characterized by fluctuations of 
sentiment throughout a vlog’s narrative 
time. We provide a taxonomy of these 
seven continuous sentiment styles and 
found that vlogs whose sentiment builds up 
towards a positive ending are the most 
prevalent in our sample. Gender was 
associated with preferences for different 
continuous sentiment trajectories. This 
paper discusses the findings with respect to 
previous work and concludes with an 
outlook towards possible uses of the 
corpus, method and findings of this paper 
for related areas of research. 

1 Introduction 

Vlogging or video-blogging has become one of the 
most popular video formats on social media 
platforms like YouTube. Vlogs have been referred 
to as ‘conversational video-blogs’ (Biel and Gatica-
Perez, 2010) or ‘monologue-like’ videos (Aran et 
al., 2014), and are officially defined in the 
Cambridge dictionary of English as “a record of 
your thoughts, opinions or experiences that you 
film and publish on the internet”1. The vast amount 
of vlogs on YouTube comprises a rich body of 
visual and textual data, usually covering a 
vlogger’s daily life. The transcripts of vlogs 
provide researchers with ample opportunity to

dictionary/english/vlog 

examine natural language in this young field of 
communication. Nevertheless, little attention has 
thus far been paid to investigating the language 
used in YouTube vlogs. 

Much of the literature concerning Youtube vlogs 
focuses on the visual modality (Aran et al., 2014) 
or meta-indicators such as views and subscriber 
counts (Borghol et al., 2012). With the current 
study, we aim to address this gap in the literature 
by automatically analyzing the linguistic styles 
used by YouTube’s vloggers. Building on a novel 
approach to examining the continuous sentiment 
structure, we seek to shed light on the different 
temporal trajectories used by vloggers, and, by 
doing so, we expect to gain a deeper understanding 
of language use in vlogs. 

1.1 Previous research on vlogs 
Research on YouTube vlogs has thus far mainly 
focused on metadata indicators and how they 
impact video popularity. For example, a 
pronounced "rich-get-richer" effect regarding 
video popularity is often found. When controlling 
for the content, previous views are the best 
predictor of later video popularity (Borghol et al., 
2012). In addition, video age also predicts 
popularity: when the content is similar, early 
uploaders have an advantage over later uploaders 
in terms of popularity (Borghol et al., 2012). 
Furthermore, related video recommendations 
shown during or after a playing video also serve as 
an important indicator of the view count for 
YouTube videos (Zhou et al., 2010).  

Another strand of research has examined the 
visual content of vlogs. Across 2,268 single-person 
YouTube videos, four clusters of user activity level

(e.g., stationary or in motion), editing choices, and 
video quality were identified (Aran et al., 2014). 
Videos from a cluster with highly edited, active 
vlogs received more views than simple 
conversational videos in which the vlogger is 
stationary in front of the camera. Concerning audio 
data, videos in which the vlogger is “talking more, 
faster, and using few pauses” receive more views 
on average (Biel and Gatica-Perez, 2010). 
Similarly, the distance of the vlogger to the camera, 
looking time, and ‘looking-while-speaking’ were 
also found to significantly correlate with view 
count. It has been suggested that these nonverbal 
characteristics might be related to specific 
personality traits that promote effective 
communication and video popularity (Biel and 
Gatica-Perez, 2010). Lastly, a smaller line of 
research examines the linguistic content of 
YouTube vlogs. For example, a manual inspection 
of a random sample of 100 vlogs suggests that 
female vloggers are more likely than male vloggers 
to vlog about personal matters (Molyneaux et al., 
2008). In contrast, male YouTubers focused more 
on entertainment and technology. Research on the 
linguistic content of vlogs is scarce, which is why 
the present paper presents a novel methodology 
and corpus for examining the text modality. In the 
next section, the proposed method is explained in 
conjunction with previous research utilizing intra-
textual sentiment analysis. 

1.2 Continuous sentiment trajectories 
With increasing amounts of textual data available 
online, diverse methods for examining natural 
language and its linguistic style and content are 
applied on a large scale. Applications range from 
the automated detection of fake reviews (Ott et al., 
2013), fake news (Thorne et al., 2018; Pérez-Rosas 
et al., 2018) and lies and truths (Mihalcea and 
Strapparava, 2009; Kleinberg et al., 2018) to 
detecting political sentiments (Cambria, 2016). 

One important strand of computational 
linguistics examines the sentiment of texts (i.e., 
how positive or negative the emotional valence of 
the content is). Typically, a sentiment score is 
reported for a piece or section of text (e.g., a 
sentence or a whole text). However, a recently 
emerged literature examines shifts in emotional 
valence throughout a text (hence intra-textual) to 
assess sentiment over time. This focus on the 
temporal dimension resembles work on storyline 
extraction, where the timeline of events is 

considered, including events that give rise to a 
‘climax’ of a story (Caselli and Vossen, 2016). With 
intra-textual sentiment analysis, it is also possible 
to visualize language use leading to a climax in 
(positive or negative) sentiment. This method has 
thus far been applied to extract the intra-textual 
sentiment dynamics in novels (Gao et al., 2016) 
and was used to identify key narrative moments. 
Within this same context, Jockers (2015a) analyzed 
the intra-textual sentiments of over 40.000 novels 
using hierarchical clustering and observed six 
shapes, each representing a common sentiment 
structure in novels (e.g., a ‘man-in-hole' structure 
showcasing a positive-negative-positive 
sentiment). 

A few studies have further examined emotional 
plot shapes in different bodies of text. Six common 
emotional arcs were found to underlie 1,327 
fictional stories, termed the ‘rags to riches’ (i.e., a 
rise in sentiment), ‘tragedy’ or ‘riches to rags’ (i.e., 
a fall in sentiment), ‘man in hole’ (i.e., fall-rise), 
‘Icarus’ (i.e., rise-fall), ‘Cinderella’ (i.e., rise-fall-
rise), and ‘Oedipus’ styles (i.e., fall-rise-fall; see 
Reagan et al., 2016). Comparing these emotional 
arcs to the number of downloads for each of the 
fiction titles, the authors suggest that ‘Icarus', 
‘Oedipus', and ‘Man in a hole' are the most 
successful plot shapes.  

In a different study IBM's Watson Tone 
Analyzer was used to examine the continuous 
trajectories (i.e., in terms of emotion: e.g., joy; 
language: e.g., analytical language, and 
personality: e.g., extraversion) in public speaking 
(Tanveer et al., 2018). The authors investigated the 
audience’s perception of linguistic structures of 
2,007 publicly available TED talks. After 
identifying clusters and comparing these to ratings 
on the TED website, they found that ‘flat’ (i.e., less 
diverse) plot shapes are more likely to be rated as 
‘long-winded', emphasizing the importance of 
narrative variety for speech success. Furthermore, 
the majority of speeches showed a positive ending. 
While specific linguistic (or visual) characteristics 
of a video may not be accessible prior to watching 
a video, its style and structure may play a role in 
capturing and holding on to the attention of a 
viewer. Since video streaming services tend to only 
consider “quality views” (i.e., longer than X 
amount of time, (YouTube.com, 2018), examining 
the continuous sentiment styles over narrative time 
may be a worthwhile endeavor.

1.3 The current study 
This investigation aims to use intra-textual 
sentiment analysis to examine the continuous 
sentiment styles used in YouTube vlogs. 
Specifically, we primarily aim to identify distinct 
trajectories of continuous sentiment. In addition, 
we explore the sentiment styles’ relationship to 
gender and their overall prevalence on YouTube. 
Besides these aims, we introduce a novel method 
of extracting sentiment that is sensitive to valence 
shifters but can be used on non-punctuated data 
(e.g., YouTube vlogs). We also present a publicly 
available corpus of YouTube vlog transcripts. 

2 Data 

The data and code used to produce the analysis and 
data in this paper are publicly available.2 3 

2.1 Vlog selection 
Vlogs were selected by choosing vlog channels 
(i.e., where YouTubers post their videos) from a list 
of the top 250 YouTube channels (ranked by 
subscriber count) in the ‘People & Blogs' category 
(retrieved from www.socialblade.com on 29 March 
2018). Channels were selected for inclusion if the 
videos on the channel were in English and the 
channel solely focused on vlogs – excluding 
channels with gaming, music and prank videos. 
The aim was to select a sample of 20 female and 20 
male vloggers from the list of 250 YouTube 
channels. However, the majority of channels in this 
list were male or family vloggers, resulting in a 
somewhat unbalanced sample. After inspecting all 
250 channels in the list, 37 channels that satisfied 
the aforementioned criteria remained. 

2.2 Scraping vlog transcripts 
To obtain vlog transcripts, we accessed all videos 
published on the selected YouTube channels and 
used www.downsub.com to access video 
transcripts. That website downloads and returns 
YouTube transcripts for a specified video URL 
directly in the browser. We developed a python 
script that takes video URLs as input and 
communicates indirectly with YouTube via 
downsub.com to request and retrieve video 
transcripts. We did not differentiate between 
manually-added and automatically-generated

aaron188/narrative_structures.  

transcripts but encountered several cases in which 
neither was available for a certain video. In this 
case, we ignored the affected video and proceeded 
without considering it further in the analysis. 

2.3 Preprocessing 
The retrieved transcripts were XML-encoded, and 
the preprocessing included the removal of all XML 
tags to provide human-readable sequences. 
Furthermore, each row of the XML transcripts 
contained the word sequence of the vlog with its 
corresponding start and end time. Since the 
YouTube transcripts do not include any 
punctuation information, we decoded each row by 
removing the XML tags and merged the resulting 
human-readable sequences to one continuous 
string for each vlog. 

2.4 Feature extraction 
The primary aim of this investigation was to 
examine the continuous sentiment structures of 
popular vlogs. Taking inspiration from previous 
work on the narrative arcs of novels (Gao et al., 
2016), we wanted to analyze how the sentiment of 
the spoken content of a vlog moves dynamically 
throughout the vlog’s narrative time. When 
conducting sentiment extraction, an important 
consideration is the treatment of valence shifters 
that influence the meaning of a sentiment. For 
example, an utterance such as “this was not a bad 
day” should be rated as a positive sentiment since 
the valence of “bad” is shifted through the negator 
“not”. Existing methods of extracting sentiment, 
however, either ignore valence shifters (Jockers, 
2015b) or are sentence-based (i.e., they provide 
weighted sentiments only per sentence, e.g., the R-
package sentimentr, Rinker, 2018b). Since the 
scraped transcripts are non-punctuated, but we also 
wanted to account for valence shifters, we built a 
“naïve context” sentiment extractor that is sensitive 
to negators (e.g., not, doesn’t), [de-]amplifiers 
(e.g., really, hardly), and adversative conjunctions 
(e.g., but, however). The rationale is inspired by the 
algorithm behind sentimentr (Rinker, 2018b) but 
extends that approach to data that are non-
punctuated or very brief.  

Specifically, our algorithm identifies each 
sentiment as matched with the ‘Jockers & Rinker 
Polarity Lookup Table’ from the lexicon R package 

3 Code for feature extraction algorithm:

aaron188/naive_context_sentiment 



3584

(Rinker, 2018a) and then constructs a “naïve 
context” cluster (i.e., without relying on 
punctuation or other structure) around that 
sentiment (here: two words before and after the 
sentiment). For each context cluster, the raw 
sentiment is then weighted by the presence of 
valence shifters. For example, “this was not a bad 
day in the sun” would result in a cluster around the 
identified sentiment word “bad” of (not a bad day 
in). The weights assigned to the valence shifters in 
this study (Negator: -1.00, Amplifier: 1.50, De-
amplifier: 0.50, Adversative conjunction: 0.25) are 
motivated by those in the similar software package 
sentimentr. 4  Lastly, the sentiment word in the 
cluster is replaced by its sentiment value: (-1, 1, -
0.75, 1, 1). We can then calculate the product of all 
vector elements and retrieve the weighted 
sentiment of that cluster (e.g., 0.75 for “not a bad 
day in”).  

We performed the naïve sentiment extraction on 
each vlog transcript resulting in a vector consisting 
of zeros (for words that did not match the sentiment 
lookup table) and weighted sentiment values. That 
vector was transformed to a standardized narrative 
time from 0 to 100 using the discrete cosine 
transformation from the syuzhet R package 
(Jockers, 2015b). The sentiment values were scaled 
from -1 (lowest sentiment per vlog transcript) to +1 
(highest sentiment per vlog transcript). The 
transformation yielded a vector of 100 sentiment 
coordinates for each transcript. 

3 Results 

3.1 Corpus statistics 
The final corpus consisted of the transcripts of 
27,333 vlogs from 24 vloggers with a total corpus 
size of 40,318,924 words and vlogs accounting for 
more than 24 billion views. These are all vlogs of 
which we were able to retrieve a transcript of at 
least ten words. Table 1 shows that female vloggers 
were underrepresented in the sample. More than 
half of the vlogs stem from male vloggers and a 
third from families who vlog. Since view count is 
highly dependent on the number of days the vlog is 
online, we corrected the view count for each vlog 
by dividing it by the number of days it was online. 
We then excluded 462 vlogs (1.69%) that were 
considered view count outliers (i.e., more than

emerge in literature. The algorithm is available as an R-
implementation to modify these values. 

three standard deviations above the mean). All 
subsequent analyses were conducted on the final 
sample with these outliers excluded. 

3.2 Identifying continuous sentiment styles 
The primary aim of this paper was to examine 
whether the narrative structure of vlogs can be 
captured by a few overarching sentiment styles. We 
used the binned sentiments extracted for each vlog 
in an unsupervised non-hierarchical k-means 
cluster analysis. Using the within-cluster-sum-of-
squares in a scree plot for 1 to 30 clusters, we 
observed an inflection after seven clusters and 
therefore decided to build a k-means model with 
k=7 (Figure 1 and 2).  

The k-means model assigned one cluster to each 
vlog transcript, and we subsequently averaged the 
continuous sentiment structure of all vlogs

belonging to each cluster. Figure 1 and 2 show the 
distinct average shapes of the continuous sentiment 
structures of each cluster. The dotted red lines 
indicate the upper and lower boundaries of the 
sentiment shape +/- one standard deviation; the 
blue lines show the 99% confidence intervals. The 
seven plot shapes represent the average sentiment 
of all vlogs in that shape cluster in each bin of 
standardized narrative time (1-100). For example, 
for the first shape (Figure 1, second plot), the 
sentiment starts highly positive in the first quantile 
of the narrative time and then quickly dips below 
zero to moderately negative sentiment. Halfway 
through the narrative time, the sentiment 
neutralizes and becomes negative again until the 
last quantile from which it gradually becomes less 
negative and ends in a nearly neutral sentiment.  

Table 2 proposes a taxonomy of these seven 
continuous sentiment styles of YouTube vlogs and 
provides descriptive statistics for each. We used a 
linear mixed effects model to test for an effect of 
the clusters on the view count and transcript length. 
To account for dependence in the data (i.e., that we 
have multiple transcripts per vlogger), we included 
the vlogger as a random effect in the model. The 

analysis indicated that there was no significant 
difference in the corrected view count between the 
clusters; non-standardized b-coefficient of cluster 
= 6.78, se = 7.40, t(451.25) = 0.92, p = .360. Nor 
was there a difference in transcript length; b = -
1.23, se = 2.07, t(114.10) = -0.60, p = .552. Thus, it 
is not statistically justified to argue that one 
particular narrative style attracted more views than 
others. Nor do these results provide support for a 
relationship between a vlog’s length (as measured 
by the number of words in its transcript) and a 
particular sentiment style (e.g., that lengthier vlogs 
contain more sentiment shifts). 

A one-sided Chi-square test revealed that the 
number of vlogs was not uniform per cluster, X2(6) 
= 720.61, p < .001. The observed frequencies of 
vlogs in each cluster deviated significantly from 
the frequency that is expected if the vlogs were 
distributed uniformly (n = 3832, 14.29%). 
Standardized residuals (z-scores) of the observed 
relative to the expected frequencies can be used to 
examine which observations deviated in which 
direction. There were significantly more vlogs than 
expected in the “downhill-from-here” cluster (z = 
8.30), the “rags-to-riches” cluster (z = 7.64), and

“twin peaks” style significantly more often than 
expected and used the “end-on-a-high-note” style 
significantly less often than expected (* = 
significant at p < .01). For female vloggers, the 
most used continuous sentiment style was “riches 
to rags”, while they used “end-on-a-high-note” less 
often than expected. Male vloggers preferred the 

"end-on-a-high-note" style while they used the 
styles "downhill from here" and "twin peaks" less 
often. Since we did not ascertain a balanced gender

4 Discussion 

In this paper, we examined the continuous 
sentiment structures of a new corpus of YouTube 
vlog transcripts using intra-textual sentiment 
analysis. We were able to identify seven distinct 
continuous sentiment styles. The “rags to riches”, 
“riches to rags” and the “end-on-a-high-note” 
styles displayed an alternating pattern with one 
shift between predominantly positive and negative 
content. By contrast, the “bump in the road” and 
“twin peaks” styles show a marked negative 
middle part of the vlog and an overall positive 
sentiment with a slightly negative beginning and 
end, respectively. The most volatile styles were the 
“downhill from here” and the “mood swings” 
styles with both showing three shifts in sentiment.  

While no continuous sentiment style was related 
to higher view counts, we observed that the “end-
on-a-high-note” style was the most common in our 
corpus. The pattern of this particular style suggests 
that vloggers build up their content towards a 
positive ending following the idea to ‘end strong’, 
possibly to engage their viewers to keep watching 
subsequent videos. A similar trajectory was found 
for TED speeches (Tanveer et al., 2018), 
suggesting that YouTube vloggers may employ 
strategies similar to those of prolific public 
speakers. However, since the “downhill from here” 
style is second most frequent in our dataset, these 
findings do not indicate any tendency to a general 
sentiment development over time. In fact, the 
“downhill from here” and “end on a high note” 
styles exhibit a somewhat opposing behavior since 
the first gradually decreases the sentiment over 
time whereas the second aims at developing a 
positive sentiment towards the end of the video. 
When projecting this observation to the gender-
specific findings, one can see that the differences 
between family, female and male vloggers might 
account for these contradictory findings. Both 
family and female vloggers (representing 45.83% 
of all vloggers) used the “downhill from here” 
more often than male vloggers, whereas male 
vloggers used the “end on a high note” style most 
often. 

 Gender differences might help further 
understand vlog style choice: family vloggers used 
the "twin peaks" style more often than female or 
male vloggers, with the latter significantly under-
using that style. Female vloggers resorted to the 
"riches to rags" style most often, while male 
vloggers preferred the "end-on-a-high-note" style.

Vlogs made by females started with a definite 
positive buildup followed by a marked dip towards 
clear negative sentiment and a gradual increase 
towards the positive near the end of the vlog. 
Family vloggers were the only ones who preferred 
a style that ended with a sentiment leading toward 
the negative. 

Contrary to the findings of Tanveer et al. (2018), 
we did not find support for the notion that diverse 
styles characterized by higher sentiment volatility 
are more popular: both YouTuber's themselves, as 
well as the audience, did not show a preference for 
the most volatile narrative styles. The intra-textual 
analysis approach helped us to uncover dynamics 
in the sentiment of vlogs that would otherwise have 
been blurred by an overall sentiment score. In 
many cases (e.g., for the “rags to riches” and 
“riches to rags” styles) the sentiment dynamics 
would have canceled each other out to a neutral 
sentiment.  

4.1 Limitations 
Despite the interesting initial findings using the 
new corpus of vlog transcripts and the linguistic-
temporal analysis, the current study is not without 
its limitations. First, we partially relied on 
automated transcription of the vlogs, so the 
retrieved transcripts consisted of texts generated 
with YouTube’s speech recognition software. 
Although recent advancements in machine 
learning research provide promising improvements 
to speech recognition (LeCun et al., 2015; Zhang et 
al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2017a) and contributed to 
an accuracy increase of fifty percent for YouTube’s 
automatic captions in English (Official YouTube 
Blog, 2017), the automatic generation of YouTube 
video captions remains a challenging task (Liao et 
al., 2013). It could be that potential inaccuracies 
might have affected our findings and future studies 
could set out to replicate our results using user-
provided high-quality vlog transcripts.  

Second, the sample consisted of YouTubers that 
already are successful concerning subscriber count, 
and we might, therefore, have painted a skewed 
picture of the vlogging landscape. For future 
studies, it would be interesting to look at potential 
moderating variables such as the vloggers 
‘vlogging age’ or the vlog’s topic. Possibly, the use 
of sentiment (and other linguistic dimensions) 
might differ between starting YouTubers and those 
who are more prolific and regularly attract millions 
of views.  

Third, by using vlog transcripts, we resorted 
solely to the linguistic modality of vlogs and did 
not look at the use of visual aspects in the vlogs. 
Using a similar dynamic method, future studies 
could look at how the use of visual content behaves 
and interacts with language use over the narrative 
time. 

4.2 Future work 
Using the corpus, method, and findings presented 
here as a starting point, we hope that future 
research can extend this exploratory work.  

• For example, it would be interesting to 
perform unsupervised clustering analyses 
on the vlog level to find “vlog-twins” or 
even “vlogger-twins”. Using 
observations that are similar in a 
multidimensional feature space could be 
exploited for semi-experimental studies 
where the effects of individual variables 
(e.g., a change in vlogging style) can be 
isolated towards drawing conclusions of 
causal nature.  

• Moreover, the sentiment is only one 
dimension of the linguistic aspects of 
vlogs, and the current analysis might be 
extended to different constructs. For 
example, a significant challenge lies in 
detecting extremist content on social 
media platforms like YouTube (Burgess, 
2017) and the dynamic approach might 
help uncover extremist parts in videos 
and enable a more fine-grained inspection 
of vlogs.  

• The temporal aspect of narrative time 
could be broadened so that the evolution 
of the narrative style across videos of 
individual vloggers can be captured. This 
would be a useful method to identify 
changes in vlogging strategy.  

• Finally, the intra-textual method might 
help in detecting online misinformation 
or deception within texts. A major 
challenge, for example, for linguistic 
deception detection lies in identifying lies 
embedded within a mostly truthful 
statement (Bachenko et al., 2008). 
Similarly, it would be interesting to 
examine whether a dynamic linguistic-
temporal approach as used here can aid in 
the detection of misinformation online 



3589

(e.g., Pérez-Rosas et al., 2018). The 
method used here and in a few related 
studies (Jockers, 2015a; Gao et al., 2016) 
could, therefore, also be of interest to 
researchers across disciplines. 

5 Conclusion 

Vlogging is a unique and novel means of 
communication. We explored the transcripts of 
vlogs as a source for linguistic analysis, and, by 
looking at intra-textual sentiment dynamics of each 
vlog, we identified seven distinct continuous 
sentiment styles. Vlogs ending on a positive note 
were the most prevalent, and we observed that 
gender was associated with different vlogging style 
preferences. The current paper presented an initial 
glimpse at the rich data source of vlogs, and a 
dynamic sentiment analysis approach helped 
uncover continuous sentiment structures. As such 
we hope the corpus, method, and findings 
presented here function as an impetus towards 
more analyses on this emerging means of online 
communication.
