Abstract

Human languages have multiple strategies that allow us to discriminate objects in a vast variety
of contexts. Colours have been extensively studied from this point of view. In particular, previous
research in artificial language evolution has shown how artificial languages may emerge based
on specific strategies to distinguish colours. Still, it has not been shown how several strategies of
diverse complexity can be autonomously managed by artificial agents . We propose an intrinsic
motivation system that allows agents in a population to create a shared artificial language and
progressively increase its expressive power. Our results show that with such a system agents
successfully regulate their language development, which indicates a relation between population
size and consistency in the emergent communicative systems.

1 Introduction

Over the past two decades, language evolution studies have attracted the attention of researchers work-
ing on domains such as biology, anthropology, artificial life or linguistics. This multitude of perspectives
provides a rich variety of techniques on how to address this issue, including including agent-based mod-
elling, which consists in studying the emergence and evolution of artificial languages, i.e. human-like
communicative systems, in a population of artificial agents through recurrent peer-to-peer interactions
(Smith et al., 2003; Steels, 2012). Results using this approach have shed light on the emergence of spa-
tial relations (Spranger, 2013), case systems (van Trijp, 2013), colour categories (Bleys, 2010) or syntax
(Garcia-Casademont and Steels, 2016).

In most of these experiments the control of the complexity relies on the experimenter, who carefully
selects the stages of the experiment, constraining the language development. Insights from different
models dealing with complexity come from research in AI and robotics, where a number of studies
where a number of studies tried to specify how agents regulate the complexity of their actions in an
autonomous way. Several models have been proposed, including error reduction (Andry et al., 2001),
prediction (Marshall et al., 2004), interest (Merrick and Maher, 2009) or curiosity (Oudeyer et al., 2007).

These systems have been deeply inspired by psychological studies on the role of motivation (see
Graham (1996) for an overview). According to Ryan and Deci (2000), motivation can be defined as “to
be moved to do something”. Psychologists further distinguish two types of motivation, depending on the
reasons to perform an action: extrinsic, when the interest relies on the outcome of the action, or intrinsic,
when the action itself results inherently enjoyable. Both types of motivation can incite to take part in the
same activity. For example, a tennis player can work on improving her slice shots because she wants to
win her next tournament or because she enjoys improving her technique.

This paper presents a simulation experiment to study how a population provided with the Autotelic
principle (2004), a computational motivation system inspired on the Flow theory (1990), is able to self-
organize and extend the expressive power of a shared communication system for the continuous domain
of colour. Agents play a language game1 and they use this motivation system to decide on the complexity

of both the context of the interaction and the utterances they formulate and comprehend.
In the next section of the paper, we describe Flow Theory and an operational computational version,

the Autotelic Principle, that allow agents to autonomously regulate their development. Section 3 briefly
reviews artificial language evolution research on the domain of colour, the case study in which the mo-
tivational system is tested. Section 4 presents the experiment design in detail: how agents interact, the
different communicative tasks, how the context of interactions is chosen and the different operational
mechanisms agents use to emerge and align a shared communicative system. Finally, sections 5 and 6
presents the experimental results and conclusions.

2 Flow theory and architecture

Csı́kszentmihályi wanted to understand what moves people to be absorbed in complex activities that do
not provide an external reward, such as rock climbing, painting or sculpting. He found that the reason
was that participants found these activities inherently enjoyable. He called these activities autotelic, as
the motivational driving force (telos) comes from the individual itself (auto).

Based on these observations he developed the Flow theory (1990). Autotelic activities can be explained
based on the relation of two dimensions (Figure 1a): challenge, a certain task to be done, and skill, the
abilities that a person has to tackle that task. This relation accounts for the range of different mental
states that people experience when they are involved in an autotelic activity: boredom, when the skills
are too high for the current challenge, anxiety, when the challenge is too difficult given the current skills,
and flow, when there is a balance between both. He identified the latest as the optimal state of experience.
This state provides the best scenario for further enlarging their skills. As a consequence, the state of flow
is in in continuous motion, as skills evolve over time. Participants seek to stay in flow state, therefore
becoming self-motivated.

Inspired by the work of Csı́kszentmihályi, Steels (2004) proposed the Autotelic principle, an opera-
tional version of the Flow theory to provide artificial agents with a system to self-regulate their develop-
ment. As in the Flow theory, the balance between challenge and skills acts as the motivational driving
force in agents. Agents use this relation to identify their internal state (boredom, anxiety or flow) and
consequently react to it increasing or decreasing their challenges.

2.1 Challenge management

The principle establishes two different phases, operational and shake-up. The first one corresponds to
the state of flow: agents explore a particular challenge and try to develop the abilities required to cope
with it. The latest is reached when agents are either in a state of anxiety or boredom. It acts as a trigger
to adjust the challenge to be addressed in order to look for a more balanced challenge-skills relation.
In case of boredom a more demanding challenge should be attempted. In contrast, a more accessible
challenge should be tackled in an anxiety state.

Challenges are characterised as a set of parameters: given a multi-dimensional parameter space P ,
a challenge pi is defined as a vector < pi,1, pi,2, ..., pi,n >, where pi,j corresponds to the value of the
parameter j in the challenge i. Agents are able to generate more complex or manageable challenges
by changing the specific configuration of a challenge. The space of possible challenges depends on the
number of parameters of the set and the different values each parameter can have.

2.2 Skill evaluation

Agents indirectly measure their skills based on their performance. Each challenge is monitored with
a value in the range [0,1] where 1 represents optimal performance for that task. This value is used to
compute the confidence an agent has in its skill level to accomplish a particular challenge. A confidence
value of 1 is interpreted as boredom as it indicates that the agent has acquired the skills to handle the
current task. On the other hand, a steady value of 0 is interpreted as anxiety as it shows that the agent is
not succeeding in expanding its abilities to cope with the actual challenge.

After each interaction, the confidence on the current challenge is updated taking into account the
individual competences of the agent and the outcome of the interaction. When the interaction is a

Figure 1: According to Csı́kszentmihályi (Figure 1a), individuals enter a state of flow when they correctly
balance their skills against the selected challenges when performing particular activities. A mismatch of
this balance may lead to anxiety (i.e. the challenge is too big) or boredom (i.e. the challenge is too easy).

success, the confidence value is updated as follows: confi = confi−1 + δincrease, where confi and
confi−1 are the current and previous confidence values and δincrease is set to 0.005. On the con-
trary, when the outcome of an interaction is a failure the confidence value is updated in this way:
confi = confi−1 − δdecrease+ indcomp, where δdecrease is set to 0.02 and indcomp is the value in
the range [0,0.015] that corresponds to the evaluation of the individual competences of the agent.

This motivation system has been used before in experiments of language emergence in discrete do-
mains (Steels and Wellens, 2007; Cornudella et al., 2015). The work presented here differs from previous
experiments in that it tests the autotelic principle in a continuous domain. In this experiment agents need
to self-organize a communicative system but also agree on the meanings associated with their lexicons:
colours are no longer discrete values but rather points in a three dimensional feature space and member-
ship prototypes are values in the range [0,1].

3 A case study on colour

Research on the domain of colour has been of great interest to a lot of researchers, due to the differences
observed in how colours are described in human languages (Berlin and Kay, 1969). It is commonly
accepted that a colour space, the space of colours that can be perceived, is organised in different colour
categories, subsets of this space (Figure 1b). Colour prototypes are the best representation of a particular
colour category in a colour space (Rosch, 1973). Formally, a colour space is composed of a set of colour
prototypes {c1, c2, ..., cn}. Given the colour prototype ck, its associated cell Rk, which determines the
associated colour category, contains every point whose distance to ck is shorter or equal to the distance
to any other prototype ci.

Although the research in this domain is extensive, most studies have focused on the use of single
terms to describe colours. Experiments by Simpson and Tarrant (1991) and Lin et al. (2001) showed
that only 15% of colour samples were described using a single colour term when human subjects were
asked to describe colour samples without any restriction. These results provide evidence to the fact that
usually people prefer to express more information about the colours they are describing instead of only
employing single terms.

Colour has been of particular interest to researchers working on artificial language evolution. The
majority of models have focused on the emergence of single colour terms (Steels et al., 2005; Belpaeme
and Bleys, 2007; Baronchelli et al., 2010; Baronchelli et al., 2015), but some attempts to model more
complex descriptions also exist. In this respect, the most advanced contribution is the work of Bleys
(2009; 2009; 2012). In his doctoral thesis (2010) different language strategies, a particular method to
express one area of meaning, are explained and studied. These language strategies are then tested on

1648



artificial language evolution experiments, showing how these models can emerge and be learned by a
population of artificial agents.

4 Experiment

In this section the design of the experiment is explained: the particular language game agents play, the
different communicative challenges of the experiment, how the contexts of interactions are determined
and the operational mechanisms agents use to develop and align their language. The experiment is
implemented in Babel22, a multi-agent experiment framework (Loetzsch et al., 2008).

4.1 Language Game
The experiment consists in recurrent communicative interactions in a population of artificial agents
equipped with the autotelic principle situated in a particular context. In every interaction a randomly
selected pair of agents is picked from the population. One of them assumes the role of speaker and the
other the role of hearer. The goal of the interacting agents is to communicate about one colour sample
from the context.

The specific language game that agents play is called multi-word guessing game. The speaker selects
the context of the interaction, based on the challenge it is currently addressing, and randomly picks a
colour sample as topic3. When the speaker is able to discriminatingly conceptualise the topic into a
meaning predicate it uses its language component to formulate an utterance which is transmitted as text
to the hearer. The hearer tries to comprehend the utterance and constructs hypotheses about the topic. If
the hearer has only one hypothesis, it points to the interpreted topic.

If the hypothesis corresponds to the topic, the speaker gives positive feedback and the interaction
ends. On the other hand, if the hypothesis does not correspond to it, the speaker gives negative feedback
to the hearer and points to the intended topic. When the hearer has no or multiple hypotheses it signs
to the speaker that it could not identify the topic. The speaker then gives feedback by pointing to the
intended topic. The interaction is a success only when the hearer has one hypothesis about the topic that
corresponds with the topic selected by the speaker. Otherwise, the result of the interaction is a failure.

4.2 Challenges
Agents can use different language strategies to communicate about colour samples. These strategies
are identified as the three communicative challenges of the experiment and were previously analysed
in Bleys (2010): basic colour, graded membership and graded category combination4. A parameter
level is associated to each challenge, according to its complexity. Agents use this parameter to move
between challenges, depending on their internal state. Agents are able to perform three operations on
the colour space: add a colour prototype, compute the distance between a colour sample and its closer
colour prototype (Figure 2a) and transform the colour space towards a colour prototype (Figure 2b).

In the basic colour strategy a single term is used to describe a colour sample. Agents use this term
to refer to the closest colour prototype. An example for English would be to use a term as “green” to
describe a colour sample. In the experiment, agents are initialised with an empty vocabulary and colour
space. This means that they need to converge both on a classification of the colour space into colour
prototypes and on the terms associated to each colour prototype.

The graded membership strategy characterises a colour sample by expressing both the closest colour
prototype and the distance between the colour sample to it. This strategy is observed, for instance, in
English, where it is possible to describe a colour sample by combining a basic colour term with adverbs
such as “very” or the postfix “-ish”, as in “very blue” or “greenish”. When addressing this challenge,
agents also need to agree on both the membership prototypes and the terms associated with them.

Lastly, the graded category combination strategy describes a colour sample by referring to two colour
and one membership prototypes. Agents first identify the closest colour prototype to the colour sample

and transform the colour space towards that prototype. Agents classify again the colour sample on
the transformed colour space, obtaining a second colour prototype5. Finally, they express how close
the colour sample is to the identified colour prototype in the transformed colour space using a graded
membership term. “Very dark green” or “blueish purple” are examples of this strategy in English.

The complexity of a communicative task is determined by its number of cognitive operations: al-
gorithms that encode a particular cognitive function used in conceptualisation and interpretation. This
number differs among the different challenges and is used to determine its level. Moreover, more com-
plex colour descriptions can reuse skills developed on earlier stages.

4.3 Context

The world consist of 268 different colour samples in the CIE 1967 L*A*B* colour space. Colour samples
are represented in three dimensions: the L* dimension represents lightness, the A* dimension roughly
redness-greenness and the B* approximately yellowness-blueness. The difference between two colour
samples is determined by their Euclidean distance. The world contains the focal colours and the con-
sensus samples6 for English and colour samples created when combining two focal colours in different
percentages: 25%, 45%, 55% and 75%, respectively.

colour challenge

(b) Example of a context for the graded
membership challenge

(c) Example of a context for the graded
category combination challenge

Figure 3: Example of the different contexts speakers can create, depending on their current challenge.

In each interaction the speaker selects the context, which is a subset of the colour samples present in
the world. It chooses both the size of the context and the different colour samples that are part of it.
The choice depends on the current challenge of the speaker. In the basic colour challenge the context
is created by randomly picking three focal colours of English. In the graded membership challenge the
speaker chooses five random samples from the consensus samples for English. Finally, in the graded
category combination challenge the speaker picks six colour samples that correspond to the combination
of two focal colours for English. Figure 3 provides an example of each context.

5In the experiment agents can classify the colour sample to the same colour prototype twice, before and after transforming
the colour space. For instance, they can create utterances as “blueish blue” if the colour sample is very close to a certain colour
prototype.

4.4 Operational mechanisms
Agents create and learn constructions, which can be seen as form-meaning pairs. Constructions are
stored in the construction inventory of the agent, which defines its vocabulary and grammar. Agents make
use of their construction inventory to formulate, verbalise a conceptualised meaning, and comprehend,
extract the meaning representation of an input utterance. Agents start the experiment with an empty
vocabulary and enlarge it using different diagnostics, used to identify problems during an interaction,
and repairs, processes to solve diagnosed problems.

Invention: the speaker cannot find a discriminating colour or membership prototype in formulation,
caused by the lack of a relevant colour or membership prototype.

• Diagnostic: the speaker cannot come up with a discriminative conceptualization of the topic.
• Repair for lack of relevant colour prototype: the speaker creates a colour prototype C and sets the

colour sample of the topic as its colour prototype. Additionally, the speaker invents a new term t for
the colour prototype and creates a new construction relating C with t.

• Repair for lack of relevant membership prototype: the speaker creates a new membership prototype
M and sets its value to the distance between the colour sample and the prototype of its closest colour
category. Additionally, the speaker invents a new term t for the membership prototype and creates
a new lexical construction relating M with t.

Adoption: the hearer cannot identify the topic due to an unknown word t, which can refer to either a
colour or a membership prototype.

• Diagnostic: the hearer encounters an unknown word in the input utterance.
• Repair for unknown word that refers to a colour prototype: the hearer uses the feedback from the

speaker to create a colour prototype C with the colour sample of the topic as its colour prototype.
Additionally, the hearer creates a new construction relating C with t.

• Repair for unknown word that refers to a membership prototype: the hearer uses the feedback from
the speaker to create a new membership prototype M and sets its value to the distance between the
colour sample and the prototype of its closest colour category. Additionally, the hearer creates a
new lexical construction relating M with t.

Moreover, agents can also create and learn grammatical constructions. These constructions allow
agents to express meaning predicates not captured by lexical constructions and restrict the ambiguity of
multi-word sentences by imposing form constraints.

4.5 Alignment
In the previous subsection we have introduced adoption, which allows hearers to learn new word-
meaning associations for both colour and membership prototypes. When adopting an unknown word
agents have to decide between adding the observed colour or membership prototype as a new prototype
to their inventory or associate the unknown word to an existing one. The decision is based on how close
the observed prototype is from the closest prototype in the inventory. A new prototype will be added
when the Euclidean distance between both prototypes is bigger than 0.05. When the hearer associates
the word to an already existing prototype it introduces competition in its construction inventory, as at
least two constructions refer to the same prototype. For instance, the terms “blue” and “azul” would be
competitors if they are associated to the same colour prototype.

Agents are provided with a mechanism called alignment to manage the competition between construc-
tions in their construction inventory. Each construction has a score with a value between 0.0 and 1.0,
and is initialized at 0.5. Scores are used by agents to decide which constructions apply to express one
meaning, selecting the one with the highest score. After each interaction the scores of the constructions
of the interacting agents are updated using an alignment method called lateral inhibition (De Vylder and

1651

agent has different prototype values. After each successful interaction the involved membership values
of the interacting agents are adjusted. At the end of the simulation the population converges to similar
prototypes.

Tuyls, 2006). When a construction has reached a score of 0.0 is removed from the construction inventory
of the agent.

Alignment takes into account the outcome of the interaction (i.e. communicative success or failure) to
update the scores of the constructions. In a successful interaction both speaker and hearer increase the
constructions used by a score δincrease and punish their competing constructions by a score of δdecrease.
If the result of the interaction is a failure, the speaker punishes the constructions used by a score of
δdecrease. In the experiment both δincrease and δdecrease are set to 0.1.

Agents also align their prototypes. After a successful interaction that involved a membership
prototype M, both speaker and hearer update the value m associated to that prototype as follows:
mi = mi−1 − δrate(mi−1 − acti), where mi and mi−1 are the current and previous values of M and
acti the activation of the topic. In the experiment δrate is set to 0.05. Figure 4 illustrates the alignment
of membership prototypes in a population of five agents.

5 Experimental results

All experimental results have been tested on ten runs, to ensure the consistency of the results. In each trial
agents start with an empty construction inventory and colour and membership inventories. The following
measures are reported:

• Communicative success measures the average performance of the population in the communicative
task. When the communication is successful a value of 1.0 is recorded, 0.0 otherwise.

• Alignment success measures the average cohesion of the construction inventory on the population.
A value of 1.0 is recorded when there was communicative success and both agents would use the
same constructions to refer to the topic of that interaction, 0.0 otherwise.

• Lexical stability measures the average scores of lexical constructions of the population. A value of
1.0 means that all lexical constructions on each agent have the maximum score.

• Confidence in challenge measures the average confidence that the population has for a certain chal-
lenge level. It has a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

The resulting dynamics of the experiment with a population of ten agents are shown in Figure 5.
Agents start addressing the first challenge, on which the population has to create and coordinate their

1652



construction inventory for basic colour terms. Agents gain confidence for this challenge fast, as both the
communicative success and the confidence value for the first challenge rapidly increase. An abrupt drop
occurs around interaction 2000, when agents start to reach maximum confidence. As it corresponds to
the internal state of boredom, agents enter in the shake-up phase and move to the second challenge. In
the course of the second challenge agents are exposed to a bigger diversity of contexts, which makes the
alignment of membership prototypes and its associated lexical constructions more difficult. This is also
reflected in the evolution of lexical stability, as the average score of lexical constructions drops despite
the fact that agents are converging to an optimal lexicon for basic colour terms.

Figure 5: Resulting dynamics of the experiment for a population of 10 agents averaged over 10 runs of
30000 interactions. By the end of the simulation all agents in the population reach a steady communica-
tive success value above 90% and maximum confidence for the three challenges. Error bars represent the
maximum and minimum across the different experimental runs.

An overlap between the second and third challenge starts approximately at interaction 5000 where a
fraction of the population has already reached maximum confidence for the second challenge. At this
point agents identify their internal state as boredom and are motivated to attempt the third challenge.
Communication success progressively improves as population succeeds in aligning their construction
inventory and membership prototypes. As a consequence of this alignment, alignment success also
increases and reaches the same value as communicative success. By interaction 30000 all agents in
the population have reached maximum confidence for the three challenges and a steady communicative
success value above 90%.

Bleys (2010) showed that agents using these strategies cannot come up with a discriminative conceptu-
alisation in certain situations, which explains why the population does not reach a 100% communicative
success even when all agents have reached the highest confidence score for all challenges. However,
lexical stability settles to a value around 95%, which means that not all lexical constructions in the pop-
ulation have a score of 1.0. This is caused by different membership categories no longer used but still in
the lexicon of some agents. Therefore, population has not fully converged to a minimal lexicon, although
they manage to communicate successfully in most contexts.

We have studied the relation between lexical stability and communicative success by testing the same
configuration on different populations. Figure 6a presents the resulting communicative success, align-
ment and lexical stability for a population of two, five, ten and twenty agents (3000, 10000, 50000 and
150000 interactions, respectively). Results show a slight reduction of communicative success as popula-
tion size increases. More importantly, a little discrepancy between communicative success and alignment
is observed in bigger populations. This gap occurs because in some interactions agents prefer distinct

1653



discriminative conceptualisations for certain topics. In other words, different prototypes are triggered as
more accurate conceptualisations of the topic in a particular context and therefore agents select different
terms to describe the same colour sample.

Figure 6: Effect of population size. Figure 6a presents the resulting communicative success, alignment
and lexical stability scores in a population of two, five, ten and twenty agents. The scale on the Y-axis is
set to the range [0.8,1]. Figure 6b displays the average membership and colour prototypes for the same
populations.

This effect can be explained by the fact that bigger populations converge to systems with more mem-
bership prototypes (Figure 6b). An increased number of membership prototypes requires more time to
align: this helps prototypes which are not spread over the population to stay longer in individual inven-
tories as they are less used. The decrease in communicative success is therefore explained by (a) a lower
alignment of agents’ construction inventories and membership prototypes and (b) longer presence of non
spread membership prototypes among the population that are used in conceptualisation. These results
suggest that smaller populations could be able to arise more consistent communicative systems for the
domain of colour.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have studied how a population of agents provided with a motivation system to regu-
late their complexity is able to develop an artificial language of increasing expressive power to refer to
colours. Agents using this system develop to their construction inventory in three progressive stages:
they first (a) converge on a language for colour prototypes and then extend its expressive power by (b)
developing categories to express degrees of similarity between a colour sample and a colour prototype
and (c) combining colour prototypes.

The results obtained show that a population of agents equipped with an architecture of flow success-
fully manages to progressively develop its communicative skills when trying to remain in a state of flow.
Moreover, simulations with different population sizes show that bigger populations converge to systems
with more membership prototypes on average.
