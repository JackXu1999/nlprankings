Abstract

In this paper we present the GDI classification entry to the second German Dialect Identification
(GDI) shared task organized within the scope of the VarDial Evaluation Campaign 2018. We
present a system based on SVM classifier ensembles trained on characters and words. The system
was trained on a collection of speech transcripts of five Swiss-German dialects provided by the
organizers. The transcripts included in the dataset contained speakers from Basel, Bern, Lucerne,
and Zurich. Our entry in the challenge reached 62.03% F1 score and was ranked third out of eight
teams.

1 Introduction

Discriminating between dialects and language varieties is a challenging aspect of language identification
that sparked interest in the NLP community in the past few years. As evidenced in a recent survey
(Jauhiainen et al., 2018), a number of papers have been published on this topic on dialects of Arabic
(Tillmann et al., 2014) and Romanian (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2016), and language varieties of English (Lui
and Cook, 2013) and Portuguese (Zampieri et al., 2016).

This challenge motivated the organization of a number of competitions such as the Discriminating
between Similar Languages (DSL) shared tasks which included language varieties and similar languages
(Zampieri et al., 2014; Zampieri et al., 2015; Malmasi et al., 2016b), the MGB challenge 2017 (Ali et al.,
2017) on Arabic, the PAN lab on author profiling, which in 2017 included varieties and dialects (Rangel
et al., 2017), and finally the first German Dialect Identification (GDI) shard task in 2017 (Zampieri et al.,
2017). The GDI shared task 2017 preceded the second GDI shared task (Zampieri et al., 2018) in which
our team, GDI classification, participated.

In this paper we describe the GDI classification system trained to identify four dialects of (Swiss)
German. The GDI dataset included speech transcripts from speakers from Basel, Bern, Lucerne, and
Zurich. The system is based on an ensemble of multiple SVM classifiers trained on words and char-
acters as features. Our approach is inspired by the approach of Malmasi and Zampieri (2017b), which
was ranked first in the first edition of the GDI task and also performed well on identifying dialects of
Arabic (Malmasi and Zampieri, 2017a). We build on the experience of previous work of members of the
GDI classification team improving a system that we have previously applied to a similar classification
task, namely author profiling (Ciobanu et al., 2017).

2 Related Work: The First GDI Shared Task

There have been a few studies on German dialect identification published before the first GDI shared
task, using different corpora and evaluation methods (Scherrer and Rambow, 2010; Hollenstein and
Aepli, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, the first GDI shared task organized in 2017 was the first
attempt to provide a benchmark for this task.

The GDI shared task 2017 setup and dataset were similar to those of the 2018 edition presented in more
detail in Section 3. The results of the 2017 edition along with a reference to each system description paper
are presented in Table 1.

Table 1: GDI shared task 2017: Closed submission results.

The ten teams who competed in the first GDI challenge applied different computational methods to ap-
proach the task. These include linear SVM classifiers (Çöltekin and Rama, 2017; Bestgen, 2017), string
kernels (Ionescu and Butnaru, 2017), Naive Bayes classifiers (Barbaresi, 2017), and SVM ensembles
(Malmasi and Zampieri, 2017b), which achieved the first place in 2017. For this reason, this is the
approach we apply in our GDI identification system.

3 Data

In this paper we used only the dataset provided by the GDI organizers. The dataset is part of the
ArchiMob corpus (Samardžić et al., 2016).1 It contains transcripts of interviews with speakers from
Basel (BS), Bern (BE), Lucerne (LU), and Zurich (ZH). The interviews have been transcribed using the
‘Schwyzertütschi Dialäktschrift’ system (Dieth, 1986).

The evaluation was divided into two tracks. In the first of them organizers provided participants with a
test set containing the four aforementioned dialects included in the training set. In the second track they
provided a test set containing the four dialects plus a ‘surprise’ dialect not included in the training set.
We opted to participate only in the first track which contained only previously ‘seen’ dialects.

The dataset comprise nearly 25,000 instances divided in training, development, and test partitions as
presented in Table 2.

Partition Instances
Training 14,647
Development 4,659
Test 5,543
Total 24,849

4 Methodology

The system that we propose for the GDI shared task consists of an ensemble of classifiers, namely SVMs.
In this approach, we employ the methodology proposed by Malmasi and Dras (2015).

Ensembles of classifiers are deemed useful when there are disagreements between the comprising
classifiers, which can use different features, training data, algorithms or parameters. The scope of the en-
semble is to combine the results of the classifiers in such a way that the overall performance is improved

over the individual performances of the classifiers. Ensembles have proven useful in various tasks, such
as complex word identification (Malmasi et al., 2016a) and grammatical error diagnosis (Xiang et al.,
2015).

To distinguish the classifiers, we employ a different type of features for each of them. After obtaining
predictions from each classifier, they need to be combined, to obtain the final predictions of the ensemble.
To implement this system we used the Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) library. For the individual
classifiers, we used LinearSVC,2 an SVM implementation based on the Liblinear library (Fan et al.,
2008), with a linear kernel. For the ensemble, we used the VotingClassifier,3 with a majority rule fusion
method: for each instance, the class that has been predicted by the majority of the classifiers is considered
the final prediction of the ensemble. When there are ties, this implementation chooses the final prediction
based on the ascending sort order of all labels.

4.1 Features

Each classifier from the ensemble uses one of the following features with TF-IDF weighting:

• Character n-grams, with n in {1, ..., 8};

• Word n-grams, with n in {1, 2, 3};

• Word k-skip bigrams, with k in {1, 2, 3}.

We obtain, thus, 14 classifiers. Training the individual classifiers, we achieve the results reported in
Table 3. The features that lead to the best results are character 4-grams. The SVM using these features
obtains 0.621 F1 score during our evaluation on the development dataset. In Table 4 we report the most
informative character 4-grams for each class.

Feature F1 (macro)
Character 1-grams 0.349
Character 2-grams 0.569
Character 3-grams 0.618
Character 4-grams 0.621
Character 5-grams 0.604
Character 6-grams 0.583
Character 7-grams 0.555
Character 8-grams 0.509
Word 1-grams 0.617
Word 2-grams 0.529
Word 3-grams 0.381
Word 1-skip bigrams 0.532
Word 2-skip bigrams 0.541
Word 3-skip bigrams 0.544

Table 3: Classification F1 score for individual classifiers on the development dataset.

To improve the performance of the SVM classifier using character 4-grams as features, we built various
ensembles and performed a grid search with the purpose of determining the optimal value for the SVM
regularization parameter C. We searched in {10−3, ..., 103} and obtained the optimal value 1. Experi-
menting with different classifiers as part of the ensemble, we determined the optimal feature combination
to be character n-grams with n in {2, 3, 4, 5}. This ensemble obtained 0.638 F1 score on the development
dataset.

5 Results

We submitted a single run for the GDI task for the official evaluation. The results of our system and of a
random baseline (provided by the organizers) on the test dataset are reported in Table 5. The run that we
submitted corresponds to our best performing SVM ensemble, comprising 4 classifiers, each using one of
the following features: character n-grams with n in {2, 3, 4, 5}. Our system was ranked third, obtaining
0.6203 F1 score on the test set, significantly outperforming the random baseline, which obtained 0.2521
F1 score on the test set.

In the official evaluation, the ranking was made taking statistical significance into account, and thus
our team ranked third. The best performing team obtained 0.685 F1 score on the test dataset.

Table 5: Results for the GDI shared task on the test dataset.

Looking at the confusion matrix of our system (see Figure 1), we notice that BS is identified correctly
most often, while LU is at the opposite end, with the lowest number of correctly classified instances. Out
of the misclassified instances, we noticed that LU sentences are very often identified as BE.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we presented the GDI identification entry for the GDI shared task at VarDial 2018. We
employed an ensemble of SVM classifiers, continuing our previous work in this direction (Ciobanu
et al., 2017). We obtained 0.6203 F1 score on the test dataset, ranking third in the competition. We
experimented with various character and word n-gram features, and obtained our best performance with
an ensemble of four classifiers, each using a different group of features. A variation of this system has
been submitted for the Indo-Aryan language identification (ILI) shared task at VarDial 2018 (Ciobanu et
al., 2018), achieving good performance, ranking third out of eight teams.

As future work, we intend to improve our ensemble implementation and to experiment with other
features as well as in Bestgen (2017), in order to improve the performance of our system.
