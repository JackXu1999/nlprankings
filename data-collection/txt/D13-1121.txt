Abstract

We present a method for automatically acquir-
ing knowledge for case alternation between
the passive and active voices in Japanese. By
leveraging several linguistic constraints on al-
ternation patterns and lexical case frames ob-
tained from a large Web corpus, our method
aligns a case frame in the passive voice to a
corresponding case frame in the active voice
and finds an alignment between their cases.
We then apply the acquired knowledge to a
case alternation task and prove its usefulness.

1 Introduction

Predicate-argument structure analysis is one of the
fundamental techniques for many natural language
applications such as recognition of textual entail-
ment, information retrieval, and machine transla-
tion. In Japanese, the relationship between a pred-
icate and its argument is usually represented by us-
ing case particles1 (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006;
Taira et al., 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2011). However,
since case particles vary depending on the voices,
we have to take case alternation into account to rep-
resent predicate-argument structure. There are thus
two major types of representations: one uses surface
cases, and the other uses normalized-cases for the
base form of predicates. For example, while the Ky-
oto University Text Corpus (Kawahara et al., 2004),
one of the major Japanese corpora that contains an-
notations of predicate-argument structures, adopts

1Japanese is a head-final language. Word order does not
mark syntactic relations. Instead, postpositional case particles
function as case markers.

the former representation, the NAIST Text Corpora
(Iida et al., 2007), another major Japanese corpus,
adopts the latter representation.

Examples (1) and (2) describe the same event in
the passive and active voices, respectively. When
we use surface cases to represent the relationship be-
tween the predicate and its argument in Example (1),
the case of “女 (woman)” is ga2 and the case of “男
(man)” is ni.2 On the other hand, when we use the
normalized-cases for the base form, the case of “女
(woman)” is wo2 and the case of “男 (man)” is ga,
which are the same as the surface cases in the active
voice as in Example (2).

(1) 女が 男に 突き落とされた．
woman-ga man-ni was pushed down

(A woman was pushed down by a man.)

(2) 男が 女を 突き落とした．
man-ga woman-wo pushed down
(A man pushed down a woman.)

Both representations have their own advantages.
Surface case analysis is easier than normalized-case
analysis, especially when we consider omitted ar-
guments, which are also called zero anaphors (Na-
gao and Hasida, 1998). In Japanese, zero anaphora
frequently occurs, and the omitted unnormalized-
case of a zero anaphor is often the same as the
surface case of its antecedent (Sasano and Kuro-
hashi, 2011). Therefore, surface case analysis suits
zero anaphora resolution. On the other hand, when

2Ga, wo, and ni are typical Japanese postpositional case par-
ticles. In most cases, they indicate nominative, accusative, and
dative, respectively.

we focus on the resulting predicate argument struc-
tures, the normalized-case structure is more useful.
Specifically, since a normalized-case structure rep-
resents the same meaning in the same representa-
tion, normalized-case analysis is useful for recog-
nizing textual entailment and information retrieval.

Therefore, we need a system that first analyzes
surface cases and then alternates the surface cases
with normalized-cases. In particular, we focus on
the transformation of the passive voice into the ac-
tive voice in this paper. Passive-to-active voice
transformation in English can be performed system-
atically, which does not depend on lexical infor-
mation in most cases. However, in Japanese, the
method of transformation depends on lexical infor-
mation. For example, while the case particle ni in
Example (1) is alternated with ga in the active voice,
the case particle ni in Example (3) is not alternated in
the active voice as in Example (4) even though both
their predicates are “突き落とされた (be pushed
down).”

(3) 女が 海に 突き落とされた．
woman-ga sea-ni was pushed down

(A woman was pushed down into the sea.)

(4) 女を 海に 突き落とした．
woman-wo sea-ni pushed down

(φ pushed down a woman into the sea.)

The ni case in Example (1) indicates agent. On
the other hand, the ni case in Example (3) indicates
direction. To determine the difference is important
for many NLP applications including machine trans-
lation. In fact, Google Translate (GT)3 translates
Examples (1) and (3) as “Woman was pushed down
in the man” and “Woman was pushed down in the
sea,” respectively, which may be because GT cannot
distinguish between the roles of ni in Examples (1)
and (3).

(5) 賞が 男に 贈られた．
prize-ga man-ni was awarded

(A prize was awarded to a man.)

In example (5), although the ni-case argument
“男 (man)” is the same as in Example (1), the case
particle ni indicates recipient and is not alternated
in the active voice. These examples show that case

alternation between the passive and active voices in
Japanese depends on not only predicates but also ar-
guments, and we have to consider their combina-
tions. Since it is impractical to manually describe
the case alternation rules for all combinations of
predicates and arguments, we have to acquire such
knowledge automatically.

Thus, in this paper, we present a method for ac-
quiring the knowledge for case alternation between
the passive and active voices in Japanese. Our
method leverages several linguistic constraints on al-
ternation patterns and lexical case frames obtained
from a large Web corpus, which are constructed for
each meaning and voice of each predicate.

2 Related Work

Levin (1993) grouped English verbs into classes on
the basis of their shared meaning components and
syntactic behavior, defined in terms of diathesis al-
ternations. Hence, diathesis alternations have been
the topic of interest for a number of researchers
in the field of automatic verb classification, which
aims to induce possible verb frames from corpora
(e.g., McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 2004; Joa-
nis et al. 2008; Schulte im Walde et al. 2008; Li and
Brew 2008; Sun and Korhonen 2009; Theijssen et al.
2012). Baroni and Lenci (2010) used distributional
slot similarity to distinguish between verbs undergo-
ing the causative-inchoative alternations, and verbs
that do not alternate.

There is some work on passive-to-active voice
transformation in Japanese. Baldwin and Tanaka
(2000) empirically identified the range and fre-
quency of basic verb alternation, including active-
passive alternation, in Japanese. They automatically
extracted alternation types by using hand-crafted
case frames but did not evaluate the quality. Kondo
et al. (2001) dealt with case alternation between the
passive and active voices as a subtask of paraphras-
ing a simple sentence. They manually introduced
case alternation rules on the basis of verb types and
case patterns and transformed passive sentences into
active sentences.

Murata et al. (2006) developed a machine-
learning-based method for Japanese case alterna-
tion. They extracted 3,576 case particles in passive
sentences from the Kyoto University Text Corpus

and tagged their cases in the active voice. Then,
they trained SVM classifiers using the tagged cor-
pus. Their features for training SVM were made
by using several lexical resources such as IPAL
(IPA, 1987), the Japanese thesaurus Bunrui Goi Hyo
(NLRI, 1993), and the output of Kondo et al.’s
method.

3 Lexicalized Case Frames

To acquire knowledge for case alternation, we ex-
ploit lexicalized case frames that are automatically
constructed from 6.9 billion Web sentences by using
Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s method. In short,
their method first parses the input sentences, and
then constructs case frames by collecting reliable
modifier-head relations from the resulting parses.

These case frames are constructed for each predi-
cate like PropBank frames (Palmer et al., 2005), for
each meaning of the predicate like FrameNet frames
(Fillmore et al., 2003), and for each voice. However,
neither pseudo-semantic role labels such as Arg1 in
PropBank nor information about frames defined in
FrameNet are included in these case frames. Each
case frame describes surface cases that each predi-
cate has and instances that can fill a case slot, which
is fully lexicalized like the subcategorization lexicon
VALEX (Korhonen et al., 2006).

We list some Japanese postpositional case parti-
cles with their typical grammatical functions in Ta-
ble 1 and show examples of case frames in Table
2.4 Ideally, one case frame is constructed for each
meaning and voice of the target predicate. However,
since Kawahara and Kurohashi’s method is unsuper-
vised, several case frames are actually constructed

4Niyotte in Table 2 is a Japanese functional phrase that in-
dicates agent in this case. We treat niyotte as a case particle in
this paper for the sake of simplicity.

for each meaning and voice. For example, 59 and
eight case frames were respectively constructed for
the predicate in the passive voice “突き落とされる
(be pushed down)” and in the active voice “突き落
とす (push down)” from 6.9 billion Web sentences.
Table 2 shows the 4th and 5th case frames for “突き
落とされる (be pushed down)” and the 2nd and 4th
case frames for “突き落とす (push down).”

Table 3 shows an example of case frames for
“殴る (hit),” which includes no-case. Here, the
Japanese postpositional case particle “no” roughly
corresponds to “of,” that is, “X no Y” means “Y of
X,” and thus no-case is not an argument of the target
predicate. While Kawahara and Kurohashi’s method
basically collects arguments of the target predicate,
the phrase of no-case that modifies the direct object
of the predicate is also collected as no-case. This
is because, as we will show in the next section, this
phrase can be represented as ga-case in the passive
voice.

4 Passive-Active Transformation in
Japanese

Morphologically speaking, the passive voice in
Japanese is expressed by using the auxiliary verbs
“れる (reru)” and “られる (rareru),” whose past
forms are “れた (reta)” and “られた (rareta),” re-
spectively. For example, the verb in the base form
“突き落とす (tsukiotosu, push down)” is trans-
formed into the past passive form “突き落とされ
た (tsukiotosa-reta, was pushed down).” Case al-
ternations accompany passive-active transformation
in Japanese. There are only two case alternations
at most in passive-active transformation. One is the
case represented as ga in the passive voice, and the
other is the case represented as ga in the active voice.

Japanese passive sentences can be classified into
three types in accordance with what is represented
as ga-case in the passive voice: direct passive, in-
direct passive, and possessor passive.

In direct passive sentence, the object of the pred-
icate in the active voice is represented as ga-case.
Examples (1), (3), and (5) are all direct passive sen-
tences. The case that is represented as ga in the ac-
tive voice is usually represented as ni, niyotte, kara,
or de in the passive sentence. In the first sentence of
Examples (6) and (7),5 ga-cases in the active voice
are represented as niyotte and kara, respectively. On
the other hand, ga-case in the passive sentence is al-
ternated with wo or ni as shown with broken lines in
the second sentence of Examples (6) and (7).

(6) P: 原因が...... 男によって 特定された．
cause-ga..... man-niyotte was identified
(The cause was identified by a man.)

A: 男が 原因を...... 特定した．
man-ga cause-wo...... identified
(A man identified the cause.)

5“P” denotes a passive sentence and “A” denotes the corre-
sponding active sentence in these examples.

(7) P: 男が...... 女から 話しかけられた．
man-ga..... woman-kara was talked to
(A man was talked to by a woman.)

A: 女が 男に...... 話しかけた．
woman-ga man-ni.... talked to

(A woman talked to a man.)

Indirect passive is also called adversative pas-
sive, in which an indirectly influenced agent is repre-
sented with ga. For example, “私 (I),” the argument
represented with ga in the first sentence of Exam-
ple (8), does not appear in the active voice, i.e. the
second sentence of Example (8). In the case of in-
direct passive, ga-case in the active sentence is al-
ways alternated with ni-case in the passive sentence
as shown with solid lines in Examples (8).

(8) P: 私が...... 子供に 泣かれた．
I-ga..... child-ni was cried

(I’ve got a child crying.)

A: 子供が 泣いた．(A child cried.)
child-ga cried

Possessor passive is similar to indirect passive in
that the argument represented with ga-case does not
appear as an argument of the predicate in the ac-
tive voice. Therefore, possessor passive is some-
times treated as a kind of indirect passive. How-
ever, in the case of possessor passive, the argument
appears in the active sentence as a possessor of the
direct object. For example, the ga-case argument
“女 (woman)” in the passive sentence of Example
(9) does not appear as an argument of the predicate
“殴った (hit)” in the active sentence but appears in
the phrase that modifies the direct object “頭 (head)”
with the case particle no, which indicates that “女
(woman)” is the possessor of “頭 (head).”

(9) P: 女が...... 男に 頭を 殴られた．
woman-ga..... man-ni head-wo was hit

(A woman was hit on the head by a man.)

A:男が 女の...... 頭を 殴った．
man-ga woman-no..... head-wo hit
(A man hit the head of a woman.)

In conclusion, the number of case alternation pat-
terns accompanying passive-active transformation in
Japanese is limited. Ga-case in the passive voice can

1216



be alternated only with either wo, ni, or no, or does
not appear in the active voice. Ga-case in the active
voice can be represented only by ni, niyotte, kara,
or de in the passive voice. Hence, it is sufficient to
consider only their combinations.

5 Knowledge Acquisition for Case
Alternation

5.1 Task Definition
Our objective is to acquire knowledge for case al-
ternation between the passive and active voices in
Japanese. We leverage lexical case frames obtained
from a large Web corpus by using Kawahara and
Kurohashi (2002)’s method and align cases of a case
frame in the passive voice and cases of a case frame
in the active voice. As described in Section 2, sev-
eral case frames are constructed for each voice of
each predicate. Our task consists of the following
two subtasks:

1. Identify a corresponding case frame in the ac-
tive voice.

2. Find an alignment between cases of case
frames in the passive and active voice.

Figure 1 shows the overview of our task. If a case
frame in the passive voice is input, we identify a cor-
responding case frame in the active voice, and find
an alignment between cases by using the algorithm
described in Section 5.3. In this example, an active
case frame “突き落とす-4 (push down-4)” is iden-
tified as a corresponding case frame for the input
passive case frame “突き落とされる-5 (be pushed
down-5)” and ga, ni, and kara-cases in the passive
case frame are aligned to wo, ga, and kara-cases in
the active case frame, respectively.

5.2 Clues for Knowledge Acquisition
We exploit three clues for corresponding case frame
identification and case alignment as follows:

1. Semantic similarity between the instances of
the aligned cases: simSEM .

2. Case distribution similarity between the corre-
sponding case frames: simDIST .

3. Preference of alternation patterns: fPP .

Figure 1: The overview of our task.

Semantic similarity The instances of the aligned
cases should be similar. For example, the instances
of the ga-case of the case frame “突き落とされ
る-5 (be pushed down-5)” and the wo-case of the
case frame “突き落とす-4 (push down-4),” which
are considered to be aligned and represent patient,
are similar. Thus, we exploit semantic similarity
simSEM between the instances of the corresponding
cases.

We first define an asymmetric similarity measure
between C1 and C2, each of which is a set of case
slot instances, as follows:

sima(C1, C2) =
1
|C1|

∑

i1∈C1
max
i2∈C2

(sim(i1, i2)),

where sim(i1, i2) is the similarity between instances.
In this study, we apply a distributional similarity
measure (Lin, 1998), which was computed from
the Web corpus used to construct the case frames.
We next define a symmetric similarity measure be-
tween C1 and C2 as an average of sima(C1, C2) and
sima(C2, C1).

sims(C1, C2)=
1
2
(sima(C1, C2)+sima(C2, C1)).

Then we define semantic similarity of a case
alignment A between case frames CF1 and CF2.

simSEM (A) =
1
N

N∑

i=1

sims(C1,i, C2,a(i)),

1217



where N denotes the number of case slots of CF1,
C1,i denotes a set of instances of the i-th case slot of
CF1, and C2,a(i) denotes the set of the aligned case
instances of CF2. A denotes the alignment {c1,1→
c2,a(1), c1,2→c2,a(2), . . . , c1,N→c2,a(N)} where cn,i
denotes the case name that corresponds to Cn,i.

Case distribution similarity Although arguments
are often omitted in Japanese, arguments that are
usually mentioned explicitly in the passive voice
will be also explicitly mentioned in the active voice.
Hence, the frequency distribution of cases can be a
clue for case alignment. In this study, we exploit the
following cosine similarity of frequency distribution
as case distribution similarity:

simDIST (A)=cos((|C1,1|, . . . , |C1,N |),
(|C2,a(1)|, . . . , |C2,a(N)|)).

As an example, consider the alignment between a
passive case6 “選ばれる-1 (be selected-1)” and the
corresponding active case frame “選ぶ-13 (select-
13)” in Table 4. The alignment A1 = {ga →
wo, ni→ni, NIL→ga} is considered to be correct.
However, if we consider only the semantic similar-
ity, an alignment A2 = {ga → ni, ni → ga, wo →
wo} is selected, because the alignment A2 has the
highest semantic similarity. On the other hand, the
case distribution similarity

simDIST (A1) = cos((17722, 122273, 0),
(33338, 800, 382))≈ 0.167

is much larger than

simDIST (A2) = cos((17722, 122273, 96),
(800, 382, 33338))≈ 0.016.

Thus, the alignment A1 would be selected by con-
sidering the case distribution similarity.

Preference of alternation patterns Some alter-
nation patterns often appear, and others do not.
For example, as Murata et al. (2006) reported,
whereas 96.47% of ga-case is alternated with wo-
case in passive-active transformation in Japanese,

6This case frame should not have wo-case. However, since
we constructed case frames automatically, some case frames
have improper cases.

and “選ぶ-13 (select-13).” The numbers following case
names denote the total numbers of case slot instances.

only 27.38% of ni-case is alternated with ga-case.
Therefore, when we can use development data, we
exploit a weighting factor fPP (A) that is deter-
mined on the development data and takes into ac-
count the preference of alternation patterns. We de-
fine fPP (A) as follows:

fPP (A)=w(ga→cga to)×w(cto ga→ga), (i)

where cga to is the case in the active voice to which
ga-case in the passive voice is aligned, cto ga is the
case in the passive voice which is aligned to ga-
case in the active voice, and w(c1→ c2) denotes the
weight of the case alternation “c1→c2.”
5.3 Algorithm

Algorithm 1 presents our algorithm for identifying
a corresponding case frame and finding an align-
ment between cases in pseudo-code. Our algo-
rithm first makes all possible combinations of a
case frame in the active voice (cfactive), a case in
the active voice to which ga-case in the passive
voice is aligned (cga to), and a case in the passive
voice which is aligned to ga-case in the active voice
(cto ga) on the basis of the linguistic constraints,
and then evaluates the score for the combinations
{cfactive, cga to, cto ga} by the following equation:

score=simSEM (A)×simDIST (A)α×fPP (A), (ii)

where α is a parameter that controls the impact of
the case distribution similarity.7 When we can use

7Since fP P (A) is defined with a set of weights of case alter-
nation patterns, fP P (A) contains these weights implicitly, and
thus there is only a single explicit weight in equation (ii).

Algorithm 1: Identifying a corresponding case
frame and finding an alignment between cases.
Input: a case frame in the passive voice: cfpassive, and

a set of case frames in the active voice: CFSactive
Output: a case frame and an alignment between cases: A

12: end for

development data, we tune α on the development
data; otherwise we set α = 1. Since some combi-
nations of cga to and cto ga never occur, our algo-
rithm filters them out in line 5 of the algorithm. Af-
ter checking all combinations, the combination with
the highest score is output.

6 Evaluation of the Acquired Knowledge

We applied our algorithm to the case frames that
are automatically constructed from a corpus consist-
ing of about 6.9 billion Japanese sentences from the
Web. Of course, these case frames contain improper
ones, that is, several frames mix several meanings
or usages of the predicates. Thus, it is difficult to
evaluate the acquired knowledge itself. Instead, we
evaluate the usefulness of the acquired knowledge
on a case alternation task between the passive and
active voices.

6.1 Setting and Algorithm for Case Alternation

We basically used the same data as Murata et
al. (2006). As mentioned in Section 2, they extracted
3,576 case particles in passive sentences from the
Kyoto University Text Corpus, and tagged their
cases in the active voice. Since they treated posses-
sor passive as a kind of indirect passive, they did not
adopt the case alternation between ga and no. In ad-
dition, their data included some annotation errors.
We thus modified 21 annotations,8 five of which

8The modified version of the data is publicly available at
http://alaginrc.nict.go.jp/case/src/kaku1.1.tar.gz.

were changed to the case alternation between ga and
no. Note that there were some cases where multiple
possible case particles were tagged to one instance.
We adopted evaluation metrics called “Eval. B” by
Murata et al., that is, we judged the output to be cor-
rect when the output was included in possible an-
swers. We performed experiments on the following
three types of data settings.

1. Experiments without either development or
training data.

2. Experiments with development data.

3. Experiments with training data.

Experiments without either development or
training data In the first setting, we aligned the
input passive case frame to one of the active case
frames of the same predicate only by using simSEM
and simDIST with the parameter α = 1. Therefore,
this setting is fully unsupervised. In this setting, the
input surface cases are alternated as follows:

1. If a passive sentence is input, perform syntac-
tic and surface case structure analysis by us-
ing Kawahara and Kurohashi (2006)’s model.9

Their model identified a proper case frame for
each predicate, and assigned arguments in the
input sentence to case slots of the case frame.

2. By using the acquired knowledge for case alter-
nation, alternate input surface cases with cases
in the active voice.

We call this model Model 1. For example, if Ex-
ample (10) is input, the ga-case argument is assigned
to the ga-case of the case frame “突き落とされる-5
(be pushed down-5).” Since this case is aligned to
the wo-case of the case frame “突き落とす-4 (push
down-4)” as shown in Figure 1, this ga-case is alter-
nated with wo-case.

Experiments with development data In the sec-
ond setting, we aligned the input passive case frame
to one of the active case frames of the same pred-
icate by using simSEM , simDIST , and fPP with α
tuned on the development data. In advance, we di-
vided the tagged data into two parts just as Murata
et al. (2006) did, both of which contained 1,788 case
particles, and performed 2-fold cross-validation. We
used one part for development and the other for test-
ing, and vice versa.

We tuned w(ga → cga to), w(cto ga → ga) in
Equation (i), and α in Equation (ii) by a simple
hill-climbing strategy. Since the candidate cases for
cga to are ni, niyotte, kara, de, and NIL, and the can-
didate cases for cto ga are wo, ni, no, and NIL, we
defined parameter vector x as follows:

x=(w(ga→ni),w(ga→niyotte),w(ga→kara),
w(ga→de),w(ga→NIL),w(wo→ga),
w(ni→ga),w(wo→no),w(NIL→ga), α).

Algorithm 2 shows the hill-climbing algorithm for
tuning the parameter vector x, where faccuracy(x) is
a function that returns the case alternation accuracy
on the development data with parameter x. This al-
gorithm varies one parameter at a time with a step-
size of 0.1 until there is no accuracy improvement
in the development data. After acquiring knowledge
for case alternation with the tuned parameter, we ap-
plied the same method for case alternation as the first
setting. We call this model Model 2.

Experiments with training data In the third set-
ting, we also performed 2-fold cross validation, that
is, we used one part of the divided tagged corpus

for training and the other for testing, and vice versa.
Although we basically applied Murata et al. (2006)’s
method, which is based on SVMs, we added the out-
put of Model 2 as a new feature.

Specifically, we first tuned the parameter vector x
on the training data and acquired the knowledge for
case alternation with the tuned parameter. By us-
ing the acquired knowledge, we alternated the input
cases in both the training and test data and obtained
the resulting case of Model 2. Note that, we did not
use any annotations for the test data in this process.
We then trained the SVMs on the training data and
applied them to the test data using the resulting case
as a new feature. We call this model Model 3.

6.2 Results and Discussion

Table 5 shows the results of the experiments without
training data. Baseline is a system that outputs the
most frequently alternated cases in the development
data, which was also used by Murata et al. (2006).
The baseline score was higher than that reported by
Murata et al. because we modified 21 annotations.
We also performed experiments without using case
distribution similarity or semantic similarity. We
call these models in the first setting Model 1S and
Model 1D, and these models in the second setting
Model 2S and Model 2D, respectively.

Although Models 1S , 1D, and 1 were fully un-
supervised models, Models 1S and 1 significantly10

outperformed the baseline model (p-values of Mc-
Nemar (1947)’s test were smaller than 0.00001). On
the other hand, the difference between Models 1S

10In this paper, we call a difference significant if the p-value
of McNemar (1947)’s test is less than 0.01.

and 1 is not statistically significant, and thus the ef-
fect of the case distribution similarity was not con-
firmed by these experiments.

Models 2S , 2D, and 2 were models with parame-
ter tuning. Parameter tuning significantly improved
the performance. In addition, the difference between
Models 2S and 2 and the difference between Models
2D and 2 were both significant (p-values of McNe-
mar’s test were 0.00032 and 0.00039, respectively),
and thus we confirmed the usefulness of the two sim-
ilarity measures. The parameter α that controls the
impact of the case distribution similarity was tuned
to 0.3, which means semantic similarity between the
instances of the aligned cases is more important than
case distribution similarity for this task.

Table 6 compares Murata et al.’s method and our
method with training data. We used Murata et al.’s
method without feature selection because it achieved
the highest performance on this setting. Their
method’s score was higher than that they reported,
again due to the corpus modification. The difference
between their method and our method was signifi-
cant (p-value of McNemar’s test was 0.00011), and
we confirmed the usefulness of the acquired knowl-
edge for case alternation.

Table 7 shows an example of case alternation be-
tween the passive and active voices. When the pas-
sive sentence was input, the argument “松樹さん
が......(Mr. Matsuki-ga......)” was first assigned to ga-case
of the case frame “殴られる-2 (be hit-2).” Since this
case was aligned to no-case of the case frame “殴
る-2 (hit-2),” the input ga-case was alternated with
no-case. On the other hand, the cases of the other ar-
guments “バットで (bat-de)” and “頭を (head-wo)”
were output as they were in the passive sentence.

We now list three error causes observed in our ex-
periments of the case alternation task:
1) The passive voice in Japanese is expressed by us-
ing the auxiliary verbs “れる (reru)” and “られる
(rareru).” However, these auxiliary verbs can rep-

Input Text:
· · · 松樹さんが..... 金属バットで 頭を 殴られ、· · ·

Mr. Matsuki-ga..... metal bat-de head-wo was hit
(. . . Mr. Matsuki was hit on the head with a metal bat . . . )

Identified passive case frame:
Case Frame: “殴られる-2 (be hit-2)”
{何者か (someone):2,部員 (member):1, · · · }-niyotte
{女性 (woman):5,女児 (girl)):4, · · · }-ga.....
{頭 (head):3944,顔 (face):1186, · · · }-wo
{鈍器 (blunt weapon):84,バット (bat):45, · · · }-de

· · ·

Corresponding active case frame and case alignment:
Case alignment: {niyotte→ga, ga →no, wo→wo, de→de}
Case Frame: “殴る-2 (hit-2)”
{男 (man):51,拳 (fist):30,誰か (someone):23, · · · }-ga
{自分 (myself):360,私 (I):223, · · · }-no.....
{頭 (head):5424,顔 (face):3215, · · · }-wo
{拳 (fist):316,平手 (palm):157,拳 (fist):43, · · · }-de

· · ·

case was alternated with no-case.

resent several other meanings, such as honorific and
possibility. Since Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s
method does not distinguish between these mean-
ings, our case frames sometimes contain improper
cases such as wo-case in case frame “選ばれる-1
(be selected-1)” in Table 4.

2) In some passive sentences, there are two surface
ni-cases as in Example (11). However, our method
does not assume such sentences, and thus cannot
deal with them properly.

(11) 男に オフィスに 派遣された．
man-ni office-ni was sent
(φ was sent to the office by a man.)

3) Agent of a predicate can be represented by us-
ing several types of case particles in the passive
voice. For example, “会社 (company)” in Exam-
ple (12) is the agent of “雇用した (employed),”
which can be represented by either of ni, niyotte,
and kara in the passive voice. Since Kawahara and
Kurohashi (2002)’s method can not recognize the
exchangeablity of case particles, some case frames
contain several cases of the same semantic role.
However, since our method enforces a one-to-one
alignments, only one of these cases is properly
aligned to the corresponding case in the active voice.

6.3 Application to Alternation between the
Causative and Active Voices

To confirm the applicability of our framework to
other types of alternation than the active-passive al-
ternation, we applied our framework to case alter-
nation between the causative and active voices. The
causative voice in Japanese is a grammatical voice
and is expressed by using the auxiliary verbs “せる
(seru)” and “させる (saseru).” We basically used
the same algorithm as Algorithm 1 for acquiring
the knowledge for case alternation, but used differ-
ent constraints on case alternation patterns because
possible case alternation patterns are different from
those of active-passive alternation. Specifically, we
replaced the third and fourth lines of Algorithm 1
with “for each cto ga ∈ {NIL, ni}” and “for each
cga to ∈ {wo, ni},” respectively, based on linguistic
analysis of active-causative alternation in Japanese.

We used a part of the data created by Murata and
Isahara (2003) to evaluate the usefulness of the ac-
quired knowledge. Their data consists of 4,671 case
particles in passive or causative sentences from the
Kyoto University Text Corpus with their cases in
the active voice. We first extracted 524 case par-
ticles that were extracted from causative sentences.
Since the annotation quality was not very high, we
manually checked all tags and modified inappropri-
ate ones. We then performed 2-fold cross valida-
tion experiments. Table 8 shows experimental re-
sults. Baseline is a system that outputs the most fre-
quently alternated cases in the training data. The dif-
ference between Murata et al. (2006)’s model11 and
our method was significant (p-value of McNemar’s
test was 0.0019), and we confirmed the applicability
of our framework to active-causative alternation.

7 Conclusions and Future Directions

We have presented a method for automatically ac-
quiring knowledge for case alternation between the
passive and active voices in Japanese. Our method

11In this experiment, we used the same features as those used
by Murata and Isahara (2003).

Baseline 0.781 (409/524)

Murata et al. (2006)’s model 0.836 (438/524)

aligned an input case frame in the passive voice to
a corresponding case frame in the active voice and
found an alignment between their cases. We then
applied the acquired knowledge to a case alternation
task and proved its usefulness.

The knowledge we have to manually construct is
only the knowledge of linguistic constraints on case
alternation patterns. The other types of knowledge
are automatically acquired from a large raw cor-
pus. Thus, although this paper focused on the active-
passive alternation in Japanese, our framework is ap-
plicable to the other types of case alternation and to
other languages, especially similar languages such
as Korean. We plan to apply our framework to other
types of case alternation such as case alternation be-
tween intransitive and transitive verbs.
