In its early development, machine translation adopted rule-based approaches, which
can include the use of language syntax. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the inception
of the statistical machine translation (SMT) approach, where translation models can be
learned automatically from a parallel corpus rather than created manually by humans.
Initial SMT models were word-based and phrase-based, without the use of syntactic
knowledge. In phrase-based SMT, a source sentence is first segmented into phrases and
then translated phrase-by-phrase with some reordering of the translated phrases in the
target sentence. This has posed challenges when translating between two syntactically
different languages. Syntax-based SMT approaches take advantage of syntactic knowl-
edge within the framework of SMT. This book provides an introduction to syntax-based
SMT approaches. It is a valuable resource for those who are interested in syntax-based
SMT.

The book consists of seven chapters. There is not an introduction chapter in this
book, aside from the preface, which can be considered as a brief introduction. Readers
are referred to Koehn (2010) for background knowledge. I think an introduction chapter
categorized into sections would have been useful, before proceeding to describe the var-
ious models. The first two chapters provide principles applicable across various syntax-
based SMT approaches. The next three chapters describe syntax-based SMT decoding
in detail; this constitutes half of the book. Selected extended topics are provided in the
next chapter, which is followed by a concluding chapter.

Chapter 1 describes the models and formalisms applicable to syntax-based SMT.
The first section describes the phrasal translation units in phrase-based SMT, its limi-
tations, and how tree structures address the limitations of the phrase-based approach.
This explanation is useful as translation units are the key difference between the phrase-
based and syntax-based SMT approaches. The next two sections describe the grammar
formalisms and the statistical models that define syntax-based SMT. The section that
covers the grammar formalisms (i.e., synchronous context-free grammar [SCFG] and
synchronous tree-substitution grammar [STSG]), would have been clearer if their dif-
ferences were presented in a side-by-side illustrating example. The remainder of the
chapter discusses different categories of syntax-based SMT approaches and the history
of these approaches, which include string-to-string, string-to-tree, tree-to-string, and

tree-to-tree SMT approaches. Although the syntax-based translation model in Galley
et al. (2006) falls under the string-to-tree category, I wonder why hierarchical phrase-
based SMT, or Hiero (Chiang 2007), is not explicitly put under the string-to-string
category, since Hiero also uses “unlabeled hierarchical phrases where there is no rep-
resentation of linguistic categories.”

Chapter 2 focuses on how the statistical framework of a syntax-based SMT approach
learns its model from a word-aligned and parsed parallel text. The first section explains
how phrase pairs are extracted as translation rules from a word-aligned sentence pair
in phrase-based SMT (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003), highlighting the definition of a
phrase as a sequence of words and the alignment-consistency property of a phrase
pair as defined in Och and Ney (2004). The remainder of the chapter introduces three
predominant instantiations of syntax-based models: hierarchical phrase-based SMT
(Hiero) (Chiang 2007), which is a non-labeled syntax-based SMT approach arising from
the phrase-based approach; syntax-augmented machine translation (SAMT), which
introduces the notion of soft labels while keeping the nonlinguistic phrase notion;
and GHKM (Galley et al. 2004), which only extracts translation rules consistent with
constituency parse subtrees. This chapter is nicely organized and it is easy to follow
the gradual evolution from phrase-based SMT to GHKM.

Chapter 3 introduces the decoding formalism in the form of a directed hypergraph,
defined as a set of vertices and a set of directed hyperedges. The first section introduces
the notion of a weighted parse forest represented in a weighted hypergraph, represent-
ing alternative parse trees of a sentence. I found it important to pay careful attention
to this section, in order to understand the next section and the following chapters. The
next section presents various algorithms on a hypergraph to translate a sentence in a
hypergraph representation of possible tree derivations. Overall, I found this chapter to
contain many technical details. The last section of this chapter provides historical notes
on the sources of these concepts. This chapter needs to be read before the next chapter,
which assumes understanding of the concepts introduced in Chapter 3.

Chapter 4 describes tree decoding—that is, decoding with the constituency parse
tree of a source sentence as its input, focusing on the tree-to-string approach. The first
two sections highlight decoding with local and non-local features, where non-local fea-
tures accommodate n-gram language models and are more complex than local features.
The next section is devoted to an in-depth description of a beam search algorithm on
the parse tree of a source sentence. The description could have been improved if the
running example showed the decoding steps. The next two sections present extensions
to the concepts introduced in the earlier part of this chapter, by providing references to
more efficient hypergraph operations. The content of this section requires readers who
are interested in implementing an efficient tree-based algorithm to go through the cited
references. Brief historical notes conclude this chapter nicely, by pointing to relevant
materials for further reading.

Chapter 5 describes string decoding with a source sentence string as its input.
The first two sections describe beam search decoding algorithms in a binary SCFG,
namely, a maximum of two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side of each rule,
adopted in Hiero and SAMT. The algorithms covered are a basic algorithm and an
optimized algorithm. The complexity comparison between the two is nicely presented
here, emphasizing the complexity reduction achieved by algorithm optimization.
The handling of non-binary rules is described in the following section, illustrated by
GHKM rule extraction. A mid-chapter summary section divides this chapter into two
parts: beam search decoding and parsing. The second part describes parsing algorithms
in the context of shared-category SCFG, assuming the same set of non-terminal symbols

for the left-hand and right-hand sides of a rule, followed by a section extending the
algorithm to STSG and distinct-category SCFG. The organization of this chapter is
excellent. However, I feel that the inclusion of distinct-category SCFG decoding does not
fit well into this chapter, as string decoding in string-to-tree SMT requires no knowledge
of the source syntax. The historical notes also do not provide any references of prior
work on string decoding using distinct-category SCFG.

Chapter 6 contains various selected topics on syntax-based SMT. The first section
discusses tree transformations, which make translation rule learning more effective.
The description of non-context-free models serves as a prelude to the next section on
dependency-based SMT, which covers dependency treelet (equivalent to the tree-to-
string approach) and string-to-dependency (equivalent to the string-to-tree approach).
The next section focuses on the ability of syntax-based SMT to have a more grammatical
output compared with phrase-based SMT, although there is still room for improvement,
including the use of unification grammars and semantic properties. Finally, the last
section of this chapter explains how MT evaluation benefits from syntax-based SMT
principles. Overall, this chapter enriches readers’ knowledge beyond basic syntax-based
SMT in the earlier chapters. I would also suggest the inclusion of phrase-based decoding
approaches that use syntax-based features (Cherry 2008; Chang et al. 2009).

Chapter 7 nicely concludes this book by discussing the comparison between phrase-
based and syntax-based SMT approaches and proposing possible future developments
of syntax-based SMT. The chapter also highlights that syntax-driven MT predates
statistical MT, as I mentioned at the beginning of this review.

Overall, I found this book to be a useful reference book for those interested in
syntax-based SMT. The book is well organized, which makes it easy for readers to refer
to specific aspects of syntax-based SMT. An improvement can be made to the presenta-
tion of ideas in this book. Throughout the book, there are many technical keywords,
resulting from the complexity of syntax-based SMT. It would be useful to highlight
these keywords in a side bar to remind readers that they are important keywords. In
addition, although examples are given throughout the book, it would be even more
useful to use these examples to illustrate how the algorithms work, so that readers can
gain a better understanding of the algorithms.
