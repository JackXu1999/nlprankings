Abstract 

The differences in the frequencies of 

some parts of speech (POS), particu-

larly function words, and lexical diver-

sity in male and female speech have 

been pointed out in a number of pa-

pers. The classifiers using exclusively 

context-independent parameters have 

proved to be highly effective. Howev-

er, there are still issues that have to be 

addressed as a lot of studies are per-

formed for English and the genre and 

topic of texts is sometimes neglected. 

The aim of this paper is to investigate 

the association between context-

independent parameters of Russian 

written texts and the gender of their 

authors and to design predictive re-

gression models. A number of correla-

tions were found. The obtained data is 

in good agreement with the results ob-

tained for other languages. The model 

based on 5 parameters with the highest 

correlation coefficients was designed. 

1 Introduction 

Differences in male and female speech have 

long been of linguists’ interest. However, they 

used to be investigated by means of the qualitative 

methods and were largely descriptive, whereas 

these days the quantitative analysis methods are 

being employed and the goal of the ongoing paper 

to identify the gender of text authors using numer-

ical values of text parameters. The fundamental 

paper in the field is the one called “Automatically 

Categorizing Written Texts by Author Gender” 

(Koppel et al., 2002). The text parameters were 

morphological, i.e. context-independent (405 

common function words, i.e. pronouns, articles, 

prepositions, and conjunctions, POS n-grams, 

n=1,2,3). It was found that even if the number of 

parameters is reduced to 8 most frequent function 

words (FW), the classifier shows the accuracy of 

80 %. Usefulness of morphological features in 

gender identification was shown in studies for dif-

ferent European languages (Argamon et al., 2003; 

Bortolato, 2016; Mikros, 2013; Newman et al., 

2008; Rangel and Rosso, 2013; Sarawgi et al., 

2011; Schler et al., 2006). 

As NLP tools are being employed a lot these 

days, the list of the text parameters used to identi-

fy the gender of text authors has been largely ex-

panded (see Rangel et al. (2016) for review). 

However, as correctly noted by Company and 

Wanner (2014), «nearly all state-of-the-art works 

in the area still very much depend on the datasets 

they were trained and tested on, since they heavily 

draw on content feature». We think that in order 

to continue improving the gender profiling meth-

ods, especially those ones which can be applied in 

for forensic settings, it is necessary to further ex-

plore the associations between text author gender 

and context independent parameters in different 

languages, not only Western European ones.  

Slavic languages have been underrepresented in 

authorship profiling studies until now, but recently 

the problem of gender identification in Slavic lan-

guages has been raised. For example, in a recent 

paper by Sboev et al. (2016) it was shown that us-

ing topic independent features gives 86 % accura-

cy of gender identification, however the paper 

presents no analysis of the differences between 

male and female texts.  

The aim of this paper is to study the association 

between topic independent parameters of Russian 

written texts and the gender of the authors and to 

design predictive regression models. It should be 

noted that we deliberately avoid parameters di-

rectly indicating author gender (some forms of 

verbs, etc.) since they are easily imitated.

2 Methods 

2.1 Corpus 

This study utilised a specially designed corpus 

designed for authorship profiling studies, RusPer-

sonality, which contained, aside from the texts 

themselves, metadata with information about the 

authors (gender, age, education, psychological 

testing data, etc.). All of the texts in the corpus 

were written in the presence of the researchers in 

order to prevent borrowings. The texts were man-

ually written and then converted into the digital 

format preserving the original style. These are all 

samples of what is called natural written speech. 

All of the texts contained an average of 130-160 

words. The texts are short, which makes the task 

more daunting, since most stylometric features 

exhibit authorship quantitative patterns in larger 

texts (Mikros, 2013) but makes it more similar to 

those in forensic settings. 

Each author was instructed to write one or two 

texts choosing among topics “A Letter to a 

Friend”, “Description of a Picture”, “How I Spent 

Yesterday”, “Why I Am Perfect for this Position 

(any)”, etc. We selected only those authors who 

chose to write two texts.  

All the authors are students of Russia’s largest 

universities and they are all native speakers of 

Russian. So, it is assumed that participants have 

similar social and educational background. 

Each text from a male author with specific top-

ic and genre should be matched by a text in the 

same topic and genre from a female author. The 

total number of texts was 1112 with 112 chosen 

for testing the models and 1000 for designing 

them. Then 1000 texts were used to design two 

subcorpora. In the first one (“joined”) made up by 

texts written by the same author, they were both 

joined into one and processed as one text (500 

texts in total).  In the second subcorpus (“sepa-

rate”) each text was processed individually (1000 

texts in total). Both subcorpora were processed 

individually. 

2.2 Text processing 

All of the texts were processed using morphologi-

cal analyzer for the Russian language pymorphy2 

(https://pymorphy2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) 

able to normalize, decline and conjugate words, 

provide analyses or give predictions for unknown 

word. Also all of the texts were processed using 

an online service istio.com. The text parameters 

were only those that were not consciously con-

trolled: indicators of lexical diversity of a text, 

POS (17 broad categories, see 

https://pymorphy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/gr

ammemes.html for tagset), different ratios of POS 

(a total of 78 parameters). While choosing the pa-

rameters we stuck to the criteria set forth by Oak-

es (2014) Firstly, the parameter should be frequent 

enough so that the results are statistically reliable 

(we chose only the parameters with the frequency 

more than 0 in no less than 50 % of the texts). 

Secondly, the parameter needs to be objectively 

countable. 

2.3 Mathematical analysis 

To estimate the association between gender and 

text parameters, we calculated Pearson's correla-

tion coefficient r (t-tailed) using SPSS Statistics 

software. 

3 Results 

A large number of the parameters of the texts 

were correlated with the gender of their authors 

with r in the range 0.25-0.39 (р  0.05; they are 

not presented due to lack of space). We have cho-

sen only the parameters that were shown to corre-

late with the gender of authors in the joined and 

separate subcorpora and then 5 of them that had 

the highest averaged r were selected. 

1. Type-token ratio (TTR). This is the most 

commonly used index of lexical diversity of a text 

(Hardie and McEnery, 2006). Given a text t, let Nt 

be the number of tokens in t and Vt be the number 

of types in t, then the simplest measure for the 

TTR of the text t is: 

  /TTRt Vt Nt   (1) 

Note that the measure in eq. (1) is a number de-

fined in [0, 1], since for any text results 1 ≤ Vt ≤ 

Nt. 

Since the texts in subcorpora were of a different 

length, we calculated TTR in the first one hundred 

words of each text. Indeed, TTR-value is known 

to depend on the length of the analysed text and 

therefore the comparison of values makes sense at 

the same number of tokens (Caruso et al., 2014: 

139). 

The index was calculated using istio.com. The 

averaged correlation coefficient r = 0.39. 

2. Percentage of the 100 most frequent Rus-

sian words divided by text length in words (aver-

70



   

aged r = -0.322). The list of the words was taken 

from Lyashevskaya, Sharov, 2009. 

3. The index of formality. It was calculated 

using the following formula (Nini, 2014): 

F = (noun + adjective + preposition – pronoun – verbs 

– participles – adverbs – interjections + 100)/2  (2) 

Averaged r = 0.315. 

4. The index of the lexical density. It was cal-

culated as a ratio of function words to content 

words multiplied by 100 % in a text. It is also 

known as an index of functional density (Nini, 

2014), averaged r= -0.295. 

5. Percentage of prepositions and modifiers 

(so called pronoun-like adjectives, i.e. такой 

“such”, какой “what”, всякий “any”, мой “my”, 

наш “our”, ваш “your”, тот “that”, этот “this”, 

etc.) (averaged r = 0.243). 

For each text parameter a linear regression 

model was designed. In order to properly estimate 

the obtained result, let us determine the average 

arithmetic values from the solution of the five 

equations:

GENDER

GENDER 
   (3) 

Let us assume that a design value in the range 

[0; 0.499] indicates that the author of a text is fe-

male and in the range [0.500; 1] shows that they 

are male. According to our experiments, this ap-

proach proved to be more accurate than using sin-

gle linear regression model over all of the features 

in combination. 

Let us determine the accuracy of the model. Ac-

curacy, in this context, is the ratio of the number of 

texts that were correctly classified according to the 

author gender to the total number of texts. The cal-

culations suggest that gender was correctly identi-

fied in 65% of women and 63% of men. Thus, the 

accuracy of the approach was 64% (averaged accu-

racy for “joined” and “separate” subcorpora). 

4 Discussion 

The analysis showed that in Russian written 

texts by men compared to those by women, the 

index of lexical diversity and the proportion of 

prepositions and modifiers are higher; their texts 

are more formal (see Figure 1 for details). 

Overall, the data are in good agreement with 

the results obtained for other languages.  

A high degree of lexical diversity in male texts 

was pointed out by Argamon et al. (2003) as well 

as significantly higher mean word lengths, which 

was also identified in the study performed by 

Oschepkova (2003) using Russian texts by differ-

ent social groups (students and prisoners). Fewer 

clichés were also found in Russian male speech. 

We argue that a higher index of lexical diversity 

in texts by men is due to the above differences: in 

“male” texts there are fewer most frequent words, 

the majority of which are function words. 

  

  

 

Figure 1: Graphs illustrat-

ing the differences in 

mean values and SD of 

the selected parameters 

for texts by women and 

men 

Argamon et al. (2003) found that males use the 

informational features attributive adjectives and 

prepositions significantly more often and had sig-

nificantly higher mean word lengths in nonfiction 

texts. In fiction texts, men used significantly more 

nouns and prepositions. 

Rangel and Rosso (2013) also observed male 

preference for prepositions and female preference 

for pronouns and interjections. A high level of 

“formality” in male texts was also reported in a 

large number of studies (see a detailed review in 

Nini, 2014). According to the literature, this is in-

dicative of profound cognitive differences in the 

linguistic profiles of men and women: reporting is 

more important for men while rapport is more 

significant for women; therefore, texts by men 

seem more “formal” and those by women more 

“contextual” (see Heylighen and Dewaele (2002) 

for more detail). It is interesting to compare this 

with the paper by Säily et al. (2011), which shows 

that the prevalence of nouns in texts by men as 

opposed to pronouns in those by women was 

common in personal letters written in English 

from 1415 to 1681. Indeed, this shows that the 

above gender differences seem to be universal 

(see also Johannsen et. al., 2015). 

In a paper by Nini (2014) it was shown that 

“the more personal a text becomes the less likely 

71



   

it is to show a gender pattern of the rapport/report 

type. In other words, in a register in which indi-

viduals are already pressed to be Involved and 

person-centred then there is no room for variation 

between rapport and report discourse, thus block-

ing the gender pattern from emerging” (p. 132). 

However, this effect is retained in Russian per-

sonal texts such as letters to a friend. 

As for the ratio of function and content words, 

it is not commonly employed in studies related to 

gender identification but is used in other sorts of 

analysis (García and Martín, 2007). E.g., it was 

shown to be significant in distinguishing Alz-

heimer’s patients and healthy individuals, i.e. it is 

indicative of some personal cognitive features 

(Kernot et al., 2017). As far as gender identifica-

tion is concerned, using Italian literary texts 

Bortolato (2016) showed that this parameter is 

more informative than frequencies of function 

words (particularly, conjunctions and pronouns) 

individually. 

5 Conclusions 

In this paper we have proved that there are dif-

ferences between male and female texts in a num-

ber of morphological indices and TTR level. 

Some of these differences are in agreement with 

the previous findings for other languages, which 

suggests that they are universal. We argue that it 

is necessary that a list of context-independent text 

parameters is expanded and Russian texts of other 

genres are explored. 

There are currently plans to account for the re-

lations between the text parameters selected for 

analysis as well as to apply other methods of sta-

tistical analysis. 

It is also essential that the parameters that are 

easily to imitate while pretending to be someone 

of the opposite sex are investigated. Therefore we 

have collected a text corpus named Russian Gen-

der Imitation Corpus. Each author was instructed 

to write three texts on the same topic (out of a list 

of five) in their natural style, as someone of the 

opposite sex, someone else of the same sex. Stud-

ies of the corpus would enable us to identify 

which parameters changed while taking on the 

role of the other gender and which ones persist 

even during conscious imitation.  

In addition, it is essential to analyse the gender 

characteristics of authors of texts with respect to 

their personality traits and femininity/masculinity, 

laterality, etc. As correctly pointed out by Nini 

(2014, p. 34), it can be assumed that “the real dif-

ferences in the linguistic patterns adopted by peo-

ple depend on their personality and/or hormone 

levels and that genders are different to the extent 

that on average different genders are prone to dif-

ferent personality orientations and/or hormone 

levels”. Taking this into account, in future it will 

be useful to treat gender as non-binary category.  

This analysis to be conducted during further re-

search would allow one to develop a more current 

and deeper insight into the way gender is mani-

fested in written texts and to develop more accu-

rate methods of identifying the gender of indi-

viduals based on the quantitative parameters of 

their texts for forensic settings.
