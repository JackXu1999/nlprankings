Abstract
DIRA is a query expansion tool that gen-
erates search terms in Standard Arabic
and/or its dialects when provided with
queries in English or Standard Arabic. The
retrieval of dialectal Arabic text has re-
cently become necessary due to the in-
crease of dialectal content on social me-
dia. DIRA addresses the challenges of
retrieving information in Arabic dialects,
which have significant linguistic differ-
ences from Standard Arabic. To our
knowledge, DIRA is the only tool in exis-
tence that automatically generates dialect
search terms with relevant morphological
variations from English or Standard Ara-
bic query terms.

1 Introduction

The Arabic language poses two problems for in-
formation retrieval (IR). First, Arabic is mor-
phologically rich, which increases the likelihood
of mismatch between words used in queries and
words in documents. Much work has been done
on addressing this issue in the context of Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA), primarily using dif-
ferent methods of stemming and query reformula-
tion (Al-Kharashi and Evens, 1999; Darwish et al.,
2005; Habash et al., 2006; Larkey et al., 2007).1

Secondly, the Arabic-speaking world displays
diglossia, meaning that a standard language,
MSA, co-exists with dialects, such as Egyptian
Arabic (EGY). The dialects differ from MSA in
many dimensions, which limits the effectiveness
of using MSA tools to handle the dialects. Rel-
evant to IR are lexical and morphological differ-
ences. Lexically, different words may be used to

MSA. Table 1 presents the same set of four words

Morphologically, the dialects may use different
forms from MSA, e.g., the short phrase ‘he writes’
appears as I.

ferences between MSA and dialect morphology
can be rather large: Habash et al. (2012a) report
that over one-third of EGY words cannot be ana-
lyzed using an MSA morphological analyzer; and
Habash and Rambow (2006) report similar figures
for Levantine verbs.

Furthermore, while MSA has a standard orthog-
raphy, the dialects are not orthographically stan-
dardized, which leads to the coexistence of mul-
tiple spellings for the same word, e.g., the future
marker in EGY may be written as ë h or h H. We
address this problem in the context of natural lan-
guage processing of Arabic dialect by proposing a
conventional orthography for representing dialec-

tal Arabic elsewhere (Habash et al., 2012b).
Traditionally, almost all written Arabic was in

MSA and not in the dialects. The retrieval of
dialectal Arabic text has recently become neces-
sary due to the increase of dialectal content on so-
cial media that is not “curated” (i.e., not chosen
or edited by professionals). Our tool, DIRA (Di-
alectal [Arabic] Information Retrieval Assistant),
is a query expansion tool that generates search
terms, comprising both lexical and morphological
variants, in MSA and EGY when provided with
queries in English or MSA. No stemming deci-
sions are made as part of DIRA in order to al-
low its output to be usable by a variety of IR sys-
tems with different stemming decisions. While
the problem of morphological richness in IR has
been addressed before, our DIRA system is, to
our knowledge, the only system that addresses the
problem of dialectal variation.

In the next three sections, we discuss DIRA’s
functionality, some of DIRA’s implementation de-
tails, and two use scenarios.

2 DIRA’s Functionality

DIRA is designed to be used as a component in
a cross-lingual information retrieval system (Gey
and Oard, 2001). Its purpose is to allow English
and Arabic speakers to search for MSA and di-
alectal content using English or MSA queries. For
instance, teachers and language learners may use
English queries in DIRA to search the web for sen-
tences containing certain MSA or EGY inflected
word forms. An Arabic speaker may use MSA
queries in DIRA to search for online EGY content.

The interface accepts English or MSA lemmas
(citation forms) as input. MSA lemmas can be
undiacritized or (partially) diacritized. Depend-
ing on user choice, DIRA outputs a set of MSA
or EGY inflected forms for each lemma. The ex-
pansions are scored and ranked based on their fre-
quency of use in large MSA and EGY corpora.
Advanced settings give the users of DIRA the abil-
ity to specify weights for different inflectional fea-
ture values such as singular number, imperfective
aspect, masculine gender, etc. This allows the sys-
tem to prefer certain feature values that may be
used more often in certain types of content. For
instance, 1st and 2nd person may be used more of-
ten than 3rd person in blog articles while the con-
verse may be true for news related articles. The
weight of specific feature-value pairs can also be
set to zero, thus eliminating their corresponding
inflected forms from the expanded query.

We demonstrate DIRA’s utility in a web appli-
cation that uses Google search as the IR system. In
this application, DIRA first translates (if needed)
user queries (in English or MSA) and then mor-
phologically expands the lemmas in the target lan-
guage or dialect. Google’s boolean search oper-
ators are used to concatenate a user-selected sub-
set of the generated search terms to build the final
search query. This final search query is used to
perform a Google search for related online mate-
rial. The demo web application shows the gen-
erated search terms as well as the Google search
results. See Figures 1 and 2.

The online demo is available at
http://nlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/dira.

3 DIRA’s Implementation

DIRA expansion consists of three stages: lemma
translation, morphological generation, and out-
put ranking. First, DIRA translates each in-
put lemma into a set of target lemmas using a
trilingual English-MSA-EGY dictionary contain-
ing about 70,000 entries (Diab et al., in prepara-
tion). Second, DIRA morphologically expands the
target lemmas into sets of inflected word forms
using a target-language morphological generator
(Habash, 2007). For MSA, the generator uses the
databases of the BAMA/SAMA morphological
analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004; Graff et al., 2009).
For EGY, it uses the databases of the CALIMA-
ARZ analyzer (Habash et al., 2012a). Since the
CALIMA-ARZ analyzer maps a set of common
spelling variations to the conventional orthogra-
phy we use for EGY (Habash et al., 2012b), in
generation mode, different spelling variants are
produced. This is a desirable feature as it allows
us to match more terms. In order to speed up the
expansion process, DIRA utilizes a lookup cache
created from large MSA and EGY corpora and ex-
tended online with new generated forms. Third,
DIRA ranks the expansions using a weighted com-
bination of (a) lemma-feature probabilities esti-
mated from large MSA and EGY annotated cor-
pora, and (b) user-provided weights for various
feature-value pairs.

The DIRA framework has been designed to be
easily extended to other dialects. At a minimum, a
dialectal-MSA-English dictionary and a databases
for morphological generation are required. Addi-
tional optional resources include corpora for the
new dialects that can be used to estimate different
probabilities.

query ‘see’ and requested that the translation and expansion target Egyptian Arabic.

4 Two Use Scenarios

We discuss next two use scenarios. In the first sce-
nario, a teacher of Arabic as a foreign language
wishes to use real materials to teach the negation
forms in Egyptian Arabic. This scenario is il-
lustrated in Figure 1. She selects English as the
input language and Egyptian Arabic as the out-
put language. She chooses to search for the verb
“see”. The system provides an English gloss for
each lemma to help semantically distinguish dif-
ferent lemmas. The teacher can change the lemma
choice, but she doesn’t because the first lemma is
strongly dialectal. To see the available inflected
forms for this lemma, she clicks on the plus sign
next to the lemma. The online system proposes a
maximum of five inflected forms per lemma. The
first two are automatically selected by the system
and both happen to express morphological nega-
tion. She additionally selects the third term, which
is also negated.

As soon as the English search query is entered,
the system immediatelty returns four lemmas, uses
two inflected forms of the top-ranked lemma to
construct the search query, and diisplays the re-
sults of the search with that seach query. The
query and the results of the Google search are
shown on the right hand side of the interface. As
the user modifies the choice of lemma or inflected

forms on the left-hand side of the interface, the
query and search results are immediately updated
to the right. In Figure 1, we see the search query
is the disjunction of the three inflected forms our
user selected.

In the second scenario, a native speaker of Ara-
bic who may not know Egyptian Arabic wishes to
conduct a search in Egyptian Arabic. This sce-
nario is illustrated in Figure 2. He selects Stan-
dard Arabic as the input language and Egyptian
Arabic as the output language. He enters the MSA
question ‘ú



æQÓ 	áK



@’ Âyn mrsy ‘where is Morsi’ as

his base query. DIRA expands identifies two pos-
sible lemma matches for each term. For the first
word, it generates the verbal lemma 	á�K



@ Âyn ‘ion-

ize’ and the interrogative particle lemma 	á�

	
¯ fyn

‘where’. For the second word, it generates the
noun lemma úæQÓ mrsý ‘harbor’ and the proper

noun lemma ú


æQÓ mrsy ‘Morsi’. For both terms,

the first lemma is automatically selected. The
user deselects the system’s automatic choices and
clicks on the second reading for each term as these
choices fit his intended query. As in the first sce-
nario, after each choice is made, the query terms
are adjusted and the search results presented im-
mediately.
