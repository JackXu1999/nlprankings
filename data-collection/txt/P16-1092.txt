Abstract

Lexico-semantic knowledge of our native
language provides an initial foundation for
second language learning. In this paper,
we investigate whether and to what extent
the lexico-semantic models of the native
language (L1) are transferred to the sec-
ond language (L2). Specifically, we focus
on the problem of lexical choice and in-
vestigate it in the context of three typolog-
ically diverse languages: Russian, Span-
ish and English. We show that a statistical
semantic model learned from L1 data im-
proves automatic error detection in L2 for
the speakers of the respective L1. Finally,
we investigate whether the semantic model
learned from a particular L1 is portable to
other, typologically related languages.

1 Introduction

Lexico-semantic knowledge of our native lan-
guage is one of the factors that underlie our ability
to communicate and reason about the world. It is
also the knowledge that guides us in the process of
second language learning. Lexico-semantic vari-
ation across languages (Bach and Chao, 2008)
makes lexical choice a challenging task for sec-
ond language learners (Odlin, 1989). For instance,
the meaning of the English expression pull the
trigger is realised as *push the trigger in Russian
and Spanish, possibly leading to errors of lexical
choice by Russian and Spanish speakers learning
English. Our native language (L1) plays an essen-
tial role in the process of lexical choice. When
choosing between several linguistic realisations in
L2, non-native speakers may rely on the lexico-
semantic information from L1 and select a trans-
lational equivalent that they deem to match their
communicative intent best. For example, Russian

speakers *do exceptions and offers instead of mak-
ing them, and *find decisions instead of finding so-
lutions, since in Russian do and make have a sin-
gle translational equivalent (delat’), and so do de-
cision and solution (resheniye). As a result, non-
native speakers who tend to fall back to their L1
translate phrases word-for-word, violating English
lexico-semantic conventions.

The effect of L1 interference on lexical choice
in L2 has been pointed out in a number of stud-
ies (Chang et al., 2008; Rozovskaya, 2010; Ro-
zovskaya, 2011; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011). Some
of these studies also demonstrated that using L1-
specific properties, such as the error patterns of
speakers of a given L1 or L1-induced paraphrases,
improves the performance of automatic error cor-
rection in non-native writing. However, neither of
the approaches has constructed a semantic model
from L1 data and systematically studied the effects
of its transfer onto L2. In addition, most previous
work has focused on error correction, bypassing
the task of error detection for lexical choice. Lex-
ical choice is one of the most challenging tasks
for both non-native speakers and automated error
detection and correction (EDC) systems. The re-
sults of the most recent shared task on EDC, which
spanned all error types including lexical choice,
show that most teams either did not propose any
algorithms for this type of errors or did not per-
form well on them (Ng, 2014).

In this paper, we experimentally investigate
the influence of L1 on lexical choice in L2
and whether lexico-semantic models from L1 are
transferred to L2 during language learning. For
this purpose, we induce L1 and L2 semantic mod-
els from corpus statistics in each language in-
dependently, and then use the discrepancies be-
tween the two models to identify errors of lexi-
cal choice. We focus on two types of verb–noun
combinations, VERB–DIRECT OBJECT (dobj) and

974



SUBJECT–VERB (subj), and consider two widely
spoken L1s from different language families –
Russian and Spanish. We conduct our experiments
using the Cambridge Learner Corpus (Nicholls,
2003), containing writing samples of non-native
speakers of English. Spanish speakers account for
around 24.6% of the non-native speakers repre-
sented in this corpus and Russian speakers for 4%.

Our experiments test two hypotheses: (1) that
L1 effects in the lexical choice in L2 reveal them-
selves in the difference of the word association
strength in the L1 and L2; and (2) that L1 lexico-
semantic models are portable to other, typologi-
cally related languages. To the best of our knowl-
edge, our paper is the first one to experimentally
investigate these questions. Our results demon-
strate that L1-induced information improves auto-
matic error detection for lexical choice, confirm-
ing the hypothesis that L1 speakers rely on se-
mantic knowledge from their native language dur-
ing L2 learning. We test the second hypothesis
by verifying that Russian speakers exhibit similar
trends in errors with the speakers of other Slavic
languages, and Spanish speakers with the speakers
of other Romance languages. We find that the L1-
induced information from Russian and Spanish is
effective in assessing lexical choice of the speak-
ers of other languages for both language groups.

2.1 Error detection in content words

Early approaches to collocation error detection re-
lied on manually created databases of correct and
incorrect word combinations (Shei and Pain, 2000;
Wible et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2008). Con-
structing such databases is expensive and time-
consuming, and therefore, more recent research
turned to the use of machine learning techniques.

Leacock et al. (2014) note that most approaches
to detection and correction of collocation errors
compare the writer’s word choice to the set of al-
ternatives using association strength measures and
choose the combination with the highest score, re-
porting an error if this combination does not coin-
cide with the original choice (Futagi et al., 2008;
Östling and Knutsson, 2009; Liu et al., 2009).
This strategy is expensive as it relies on compar-
ison with a set of alternatives, limited in capac-
ity as it depends on the quality of the alternatives
generated and circular as the detection cannot be
performed independently of the correction. Our

approach alleviates these problems, since error de-
tection depends on the original combination only.

Some previous approaches focused on correc-
tion only (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Kochmar
and Briscoe, 2015), and although they show
promising results, they have not attempted to per-
form error detection in lexical choice. Kochmar
and Briscoe (2014) focus on error detection, but
their system addresses adjective–noun combina-
tions and does not use L1-induced information.

2.2 L1 factors in L2 writing

The influence of an L1 on lexical choice in L2
and the resulting errors have been previously stud-
ied (Chang et al., 2008; Östling and Knutsson,
2009; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011). These works fo-
cus on errors in particular L1s and use the trans-
lational equivalents directly to improve candidate
selection and quality of corrections. Dahlmeier
and Ng (2011) show that L1-induced paraphrases
outperform approaches based on edit distance, ho-
mophones, and WordNet synonyms in selecting
the appropriate corrections.

Rozovskaya and Roth (2010) show that an error
correction system for prepositions benefits from
restricting the set of possible corrections to those
observed in the non-native data. Rozovskaya and
Roth (2011) further demonstrate that the models
perform better when they use knowledge about er-
ror patterns of the non-native writers. According
to their results, an error correction algorithm that
relies on a set of priors dependent on the writer’s
preposition and the writer’s L1 outperforms other
methods. Madnani et al. (2008) show promising
results in whole-sentence grammatical error cor-
rection using round-trip translations from Google
Translate via 8 different pivot languages.

The results of these studies suggest that L1 is a
valuable source of information in EDC. However,
all these works use isolated translational equiva-
lents and focus on error correction only. In con-
trast, we construct holistic semantic models of L1
from L1 corpora and use these models to perform
the more challenging task of error detection.

3 Data

We first use large monolingual corpora in Span-
ish, Russian and English to build word association
models for each of the languages. We then apply
the resulting models for error detection in the En-
glish learner data.

975



3.1 L1 Data

Spanish data The Spanish data was extracted
from the Spanish Gigaword corpus (Mendonca et
al., 2011), a one billion-word collection of news
articles in Spanish. The corpus was parsed using
the Spanish Malt parser (Nivre et al., 2007; Balles-
teros et al., 2010). We extracted VERB–SUBJECT
and VERB–DIRECT OBJECT relations from the
output of the parser, which we then used to build
an L1 word association model for Spanish.

Russian data The Russian data was extracted
from the RU-WaC corpus (Sharoff, 2006), a
two billion-word representative collection of texts
from the Russian Web. The corpus was parsed us-
ing Malt dependency parser for Russian (Sharoff
and Nivre, 2011), and the VERB–SUBJECT and
VERB–DIRECT OBJECT relations were extracted
from the parser output to create an L1 word as-
sociation model for Russian.

Dictionaries and translation Once the L1 word
associations have been computed for the verb–
noun pairs, we identify possible translations for
verbs and nouns (in each pair) in isolation, as a
language learner might do. To create the trans-
lation dictionaries, we extracted translations from
the English–Spanish and English–Russian edi-
tions of Wiktionary, both from the translation sec-
tions and the gloss sections if the latter contained
single words as glosses. We focus on verb–noun
pairs, therefore multi-word expressions were uni-
versally removed. We added inverse translations
for every original translation. We then created
separate translation dictionaries for each language
and part-of-speech tag combination from the re-
sulting collection of translations.

3.2 L2 data

To build the English word association model, we
have used a combination of the British National
Corpus (Burnard, 2007) and the UKWaC (Baroni
et al., 2009). The corpora were parsed by the
RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006) and VERB–
SUBJECT and VERB–DIRECT OBJECT relations
were extracted from the parser output. Since the
UKWaC is a Web corpus, we assume that the data
contains a certain amount of noise, e.g. typograph-
ical errors, slang and non-words. We filter these
out by checking that the verbs and nouns in the ex-
tracted relations are included in WordNet (Miller,
1995) with the appropriate part of speech.

3.3 Learner data

To extract the verb–noun combinations that have
been used by non-native speakers in practice,
we use the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC),
which is a 52.5 million-word corpus of learner En-
glish collected by Cambridge University Press and
Cambridge English Language Assessment since
1993 (Nicholls, 2003). It comprises English ex-
amination scripts written by learners of English
with 148 different L1s, ranging across multiple
examinations and covering all levels of language
proficiency. A 25.5 million-word component of
the CLC has been manually error-annotated.

We have preprocessed the CLC with the RASP
parser (Briscoe et al., 2006), as it is robust when
applied to ungrammatical sentences. We have then
extracted all dobj and subj combinations: in total,
we have extracted 187, 109 dobj and 225, 716 subj
combinations. We have used the CLC error anno-
tation to split the data into correct combinations
and errors. We note that some verb–noun com-
binations are annotated both as being correct and
as errors, depending on their wider context of use.
To ensure that the annotation we use in our exper-
iments is reliable and not context-dependent, we
have empirically set a threshold to filter out am-
biguously annotated instances. The set of correct
word combinations includes only those word pairs
that are used correctly in at least 70% of the cases
they occur in the CLC; the set of errors includes
only those that are used incorrectly at least 70% of
the time.

3.4 Experimental datasets

We split the annotated CLC data by language and
relation type. Table 1 presents the statistics on
the datasets collected.1 We extract the verb–noun
combinations from the CLC texts written by native
speakers of Russian (RU) and Spanish (ES) to test
our first hypothesis, as well as by speakers of ALL
L1s in the CLC to test our second hypothesis. We
then filter the extracted relations using the trans-
lated verb–noun pairs from Russian and Spanish
corpora.

We note that Russian and Spanish have compa-
rable number of word combinations in L1-specific
subsets – 10K-12K for dobj and subj combina-
tions – and comparable error rates (ERR). We
also note that the error rates in the dobj sub-

sets are higher than in subj subsets, presumably,
because VERB–SUBJECT combinations allow for
more flexibility in lexical choice. We find a large
number of translated word combinations in other
L1s, and it is interesting to note that the error
rates are higher across multiple languages than in
the same L1s, which corroborates our second hy-
pothesis that the lexico-semantic models from L1s
transfer to L2. The last two columns of Table
1 show how diverse our datasets are in terms of
verbs and nouns used in the constructions: for ex-
ample, RUdobj subset contains combinations with
786 different verbs and 1, 918 different nouns.

4 Methods

Our approach to detecting lexico-semantic trans-
fer errors relies on the intuition that a mismatch
between the lexico-semantic models in two lan-
guages reveals itself in the difference in word as-
sociation scores. We argue that a high association
score of a verb–noun combination in L1 shows
that it is a collocation in L1, but low association
score of its translational equivalent in L2 signals
an error in L2 stemming from the lexico-semantic
transfer. Following previous research (Baldwin
and Kim, 2010), we measure the strength of verb–
noun association using pointwise mutual informa-
tion (PMI). Figure 1 illustrates this intuition. In
Russian, both *find decision vs. find solution have
a high PMI score. However, in English the latter
has a high PMI while the former has a negative
PMI. We expect such a discrepancy in word asso-
ciation to be an indicator of error of lexical choice,
driven by the L1 semantics.

We treat the task of lexico-semantic transfer er-
ror detection as a binary classification problem and
train a classifier for this task. The classifier uses
a combination of L1 and L2 semantic features. If
our hypothesis holds, we expect to see an improve-
ment in the classifier’s performance when adding
L1 semantic features.

Figure 1: Russian to English interface for *find
decision.

4.1 L2 lexico-semantic features

We experiment with two types of L2 features:
lexico-semantic features and semantic vector
space features.

Lexico-semantic features include:

• pmi in L2: we estimate the association
strength between the noun and verb using the
combined BNC and UKWaC corpus;

• verb and noun: the identity of the verb and
the noun in the pair, encoded in a numerical
form in the range of (0, 1). The motivation
behind that step is that certain words are more
error-prone than others and converting them
into numerical features helps the classifier to
use this information.

Semantic vector space features Kochmar and
Briscoe (2014) obtained state-of-the-art results in
error detection by using the semantic component
of the content word combinations. We reimple-
ment these features and test their impact on our
task. We extracted the noun and verb vectors from
the publicly available word2vec dataset of word
embeddings for 3 million words and phrases.2 The
300-dimensional vectors have been trained on a
part of Google News dataset (about 100 billion
words) using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013).
The dobj and subj vectors are then built using
element-wise addition on the vectors (Mitchell
and Lapata, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013; Kochmar
and Briscoe, 2014).

Once the compositional vectors are created, the
method relies on the idea that correct combina-
tions can be distinguished from the erroneous ones
by certain vector properties (Vecchi et al., 2011;
Kochmar and Briscoe, 2014). We implement a set
of numerical features based on the following prop-
erties of the vectors:

2code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

977



• length of the additive (vn) vector
• cosvn∧n – cosine between the vn vector and

the noun vector

• cosvn∧v – cosine between the vn vector and
the verb vector

• dist10 – distance to the 10 nearest neigh-
bours of the vn vector

• lex-overlap – proportion of the 10 near-
est neighbours of the vn vector containing the
verb/noun

• comp-overlap – overlap between the 10
neighbours of the vn vector and 10 neigh-
bours of the verb/noun vector

• cosv∧n – cosine between the verb and the
noun vectors.

The 10 nearest neighbours are retrieved in the
combined semantic space containing word embed-
dings and additive phrase vectors. All features, ex-
cept for the last one, have been introduced in pre-
vious work and showed promising results (Vecchi
et al., 2011; Kochmar and Briscoe, 2014). For ex-
ample, it has been shown that the distance from the
constructed word combination vector to its nearest
neighbours is one of the discriminative features of
the error detection classifier. Manual inspection of
the vectors and nearest neighbours shows that the
closest neighbour to *find decision is see decision
with the similarity of 0.8735 while the closest one
to find solution is discover solution with the simi-
larity of 0.9048.

We implement an additional cosv∧n feature
based on the intuition that the distance between the
verb and noun vectors themselves may indicate a
semantic mismatch and thus help in detecting lex-
ical choice errors.

4.2 L1 lexico-semantic features
We first quantified the strength of association be-
tween the L1 verbs and nouns in the original L1
data, using PMI. We then generated a set of possi-
ble translations for each verb–noun pair in L1 us-
ing the translation dictionaries. Each verb–noun
pair in the CLC was then mapped to one of the
translated L1 pairs and its L1 features. We used
the following L1 features in classification:

• pmi in L1: we estimate the strength of asso-
ciation on the original L1 corpora;

• difference between the PMI of the verb–
noun pair in L1 and in L2.

4.3 Classification

Classifier settings We treat the task as a binary
classification problem and apply a linear SVM
classifier using scikit-learn LinearSVC
implementation.3 The error rates in Table 1 show
that we are dealing with a two-class problem
where one class (correct word combinations) sig-
nificantly outnumbers the other class (errors) by
up to 11:1 (on RUsubj). To address the problem
of class imbalance, we use subsampling: we ran-
domly split the set of correct word combinations
in n samples keeping the majority class baseline
under 0.60, and run n experiments over the sam-
ples. We apply 10-fold cross-validation within
each sample. The results reported in the follow-
ing sections are averaged across the samples for
each dataset.

Evaluation The goal of the classifier is to detect
errors, therefore we primarily focus on its perfor-
mance on the error class and, in addition to ac-
curacy, report precision (P), recall (R) and F1 on
this class. Previous studies (Nagata and Nakatani,
2010) suggest that systems with high precision in
detecting errors are more helpful for L2 learning
than systems with high recall as non-native speak-
ers find misidentified errors very misleading. In
line with this research, we focus on maximising
precision on the error class.

Baseline We compare the performance of our
different feature sets to the baseline classifier
which uses L2 co-occurrence frequency of the
verb and noun in the pair as a single feature. Fre-
quency sets a competitive baseline as it is often
judged to be the measure of acceptability of an ex-
pression and many previous works relied on the
frequency of occurrence as an evidence of accept-
ability (Shei and Pain, 2000; Futagi et al., 2008).

5 Experimental Results

To test our hypothesis that lexico-semantic mod-
els are transferred from L1 to L2, we first run the
set of experiments on the L1 subsets of the CLC
data, that is RU → RUCLC and ES → ESCLC ,
where the left-hand side of the notation denotes
the lexico-semantic model and the right-hand side
the L1 of the speakers that produced the word pairs
extracted from the CLC. We incrementally add the
features, starting with the set of lexico-semantic

features in L2 that are readily available without
reference to the L1, and later adding L1 semantic
features, and measure their contribution.

5.1 L2 lexico-semantic features

The first system configuration we experiment with
uses the set of lexico-semantic features from L2.
Table 2 reports the results. Our experiments show
that a classifier that uses L2 PMI (pmiEn) as a
single feature performs with relatively high accu-
racy: on all four datasets it outperforms the base-
line classifier achieving an increase from 7.54%
(on ESdobj) up to 14.77% (on ESsubj) in accuracy.

Adding the noun as a feature decreases perfor-
mance of the classifier and we do not further use
this feature. The verb used as an additional fea-
ture consistently improves classifier performance.

5.2 L2 semantic vector space features

Next, we test the combination of the semantic vec-
tor space features (sem) and combine them with
two L2 lexico-semantic features including pmiEn
and verb (denoted as ftEn hereafter for brevity).
Table 3 reports the results.

We note that the semantic vector space features
on their own yield precision of 50%− 52% on the
error class in dobj combinations and lower than
50% on subj combinations. This suggests that the
classifier misidentifies correct combinations as er-
rors more frequently than it correctly detects er-
rors. Moreover, recall of this system configura-
tion is also low on all datasets. Adding the seman-
tic vector space features to the other L2 semantic
features, however, improves the performance, as
shown in Table 3. As both groups of features refer
to the phenomena in L2, the results suggest that
they complement each other.

L2 lexico-semantic features, L1→ L1CLC .

5.3 L1 lexico-semantic features

Finally, we add the L1 lexico-semantic features to
the well-performing L2 features (pmi and verb).
The combination of L1 lexico-semantic features
with the L2 lexico-semantic and semantic vec-
tor space features achieves lower results, there-
fore we do not report them here. The use of L1
pmi improves both the accuracy and the F-score
of the error class (see Table 4). For the ease of
comparison, we also include the results obtained
using a combination of L1 lexico-semantic fea-
tures (denoted ftEn). The addition of the explicit
difference feature between the two PMIs has
not yielded further improvement. This is likely to
be due to the fact that the classifier already implic-
itly captures the knowledge of this difference in
the form of individual L1 and L2 PMIs.

We note that the system using a combination of
L1 and L2 lexico-semantic features gains an ab-
solute improvement in accuracy from 1.04% for
RUsubj to 2.55% on ESdobj . The performance on
the error class improves in all but one case (Pe
on RUdobj), with an absolute increase in F1 up to
7.66%. The system has both a higher coverage in
error detection (a rise in recall) and a higher pre-
cision. The improvement in performance across
all four datasets is statistically significant at 0.05
level. These results demonstrate the effect of
lexico-semantic model transfer from L1 to L2.

6 Effect on different L1s

Next, we test our second hypothesis that a lexico-
semantic model from one L1 is portable across
several L1s, in particular, typologically related
ones. We first experiment with the data repre-
senting all L1s in the CLC and then with the data
representing a specific language group. We com-
pare the performance of the baseline system us-
ing verb–noun co-occurrence frequency as a single
feature, the system that uses L2 semantic features
only and the system that combines both L2 and L1
semantic features.

6.1 Experiments on all L1s

Table 1 shows that using the translated verb–noun
combinations from our L1s (RU and ES) we are
able to find a large amount of both correct and er-
roneous combinations in different L1s in the CLC
including RU and ES (see ALL). This gives us an
initial confirmation that the lexico-semantic mod-
els may be shared across multiple languages.

We then experiment with error detection across
all L1s represented in the CLC. The results are
shown in Table 5. The baseline system achieves
similar performance on RU → ALLCLC as on
RU → RUCLC , and better performance on ES →
ALLCLC than on ES → ESCLC . The results ob-
tained with the L2 lexico-semantic features are
also comparable: the system achieves an absolute
increase in accuracy of up to 9.86% for the model
transferred from RUsubj , reaching an accuracy of
around 65 − 66% with balanced performance in
terms of precision and recall on errors.

When the L1 lexico-semantic features are added
to the model, we observe an absolute increase in
the accuracy ranging from 0.57% (for RUsubj) to
1.43% (for ESdobj). The Spanish lexico-semantic
model has a higher positive effect on all measures,
including precision on the error class. Although
the addition of the L1 lexico-semantic features
does not have a significant effect on the accuracy
and precision, the system achieves an absolute im-
provement in recall of up to 12.71% (on RUdobj).
That is, the system that uses L1 lexico-semantic
features is able to find more errors in the data orig-
inating with a set of different L1s. Generally, the
results of the Spanish model are more stable and
comparable to the results in the previous Section,
which may be explained by the fact that Spanish is
more well-represented in the CLC.

6.2 Experiments on related L1s

The results on ALL L1s confirm our expectations:
since we have extracted verb–noun combinations
that originate with two particular L1s from the set
of all different L1s in the CLC, and then used the
L1 lexico-semantic features, the system is able to
identify more errors thus we observe an improve-
ment in recall. The precision, however, does not
improve, possibly because the set of errors in ALL
L1s is different from that in the two L1s we rely
on to build the lexico-semantic models. The final
question that we investigate is whether the lexico-
semantic models of our L1s are directly portable
to typologically related languages. If this is the
case, we expect to see an effect on the precision of
the classifier as well as on the recall.

We experiment with the following groups of re-
lated languages ordered by the number of verb–
noun pairs we found in the CLC data:

• RU group: Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak,
Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Slovene;

• ES group: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
French, Catalan, Romanian, Romansch.

In addition to investigating the effect of the
L1 lexico-semantic model on the whole language
group, we also consider its effects on individual
languages. We chose Polish for the RU model, and
Italian for the ES model as these two languages
have the most data representing their native speak-
ers in the CLC. Table 6 shows the number of verb–
noun combinations and error rates for the language
groups and these individual languages.

The results are presented in Tables 7 and 8.
They exhibit similar trends in the change of the
system performance on L1 → L1 GROUP as we

see for L1 → ALL L1s. Adding the L1 lexico-
semantic features has only a minor effect on accu-
racy and precision, and a more pronounced effect
on recall. On the contrary, when we test the system
on one particular related L1 (Table 8) we observe
the opposite effect: with the exception of ESsubj
data, precision and accuracy improve, suggesting
that the error detection system using L1-induced
information identifies errors more precisely.

Overall, the observed gains in performance in-
dicate that L1 semantic models contribute infor-
mation to lexical choice error detection in L2 for
the speakers of typologically related languages.
This in turn suggests that there may be less seman-
tic variation within a language group than across
different language groups.

7 Discussion and data analysis

The best accuracy achieved in our experiments
is 71.19% on ESsubj combinations. However,
previous research suggests that error detection in
lexical choice is a difficult task. For instance,
Kochmar and Briscoe (2014) report that the agree-
ment between human annotators on error detection
in adjective–noun combinations is 86.50%.

We then qualitatively assessed the performance
of our systems by analysing what types of errors

the classifiers reliably detect and what types of er-
rors the classifiers miss across all runs over the
samples. Some of the most reliably identified er-
rors in both RU and ES datasets include:

• verbs offer, propose and suggest which are
often confused with each other. Correctly
identified errors include *offer plan vs. sug-
gest plan, *propose work vs. offer work and
*suggest cost vs. offer cost;

• verbs demonstrate and show where demon-
strate is often used instead of show as in
*chart demonstrates;

• verbs say and tell particularly well identified
with the ES model. Examples include *say
idea instead of tell idea and *tell goodbye in-
stead of say goodbye.

These examples represent lexical choice errors
when selecting among near-synonyms, and viola-
tions of verb subcategorization frames. The error
in *find solution discussed throughout the paper is
also reliably identified by the classifier across all
runs. It is interesting to note that in the pair of
verbs do and make, which are often confused with
each other by both Russian and Spanish L1 speak-
ers, errors involving make are identified more reli-
ably than errors involving do: for example, *make
business is correctly identified as an error, while
*do joke is missed by the classifier.

Many of the errors missed by the classifier are
context-dependent. Some of the most problematic
errors involve errors in combinations with verbs
like be and become. Such errors do not result from
an L1 lexico-semantic transfer and it is not surpris-
ing that the classifiers miss them.

8 Conclusion

We have investigated whether lexico-semantic
models from the native language are transferred
to the second language, and what effect this trans-
fer has on lexical choice in L2. We focused on two
typologically different L1s – Russian and Spanish,
and experimentally confirmed the hypothesis that
statistical semantic models learned from these L1s
significantly improve automatic error detection in
L2 data produced by the speakers of the respec-
tive L1s. We also investigated whether the seman-
tic models learned from particular L1s are portable
to other languages, and in particular to languages
that are typologically close to the investigated L1s.
Our results demonstrate that L1 models improve
the coverage of the error detection system on a
range of other L1s.
