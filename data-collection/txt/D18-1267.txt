Abstract

In this paper we advocate the use of bilin-
gual corpora which are abundantly available
for training sentence compression models.
Our approach borrows much of its machin-
ery from neural machine translation and lever-
ages bilingual pivoting: compressions are ob-
tained by translating a source string into a
foreign language and then back-translating it
into the source while controlling the transla-
tion length. Our model can be trained for
any language as long as a bilingual corpus is
available and performs arbitrary rewrites with-
out access to compression specific data. We
release1 MOSS, a new parallel Multilingual
Compression dataset for English, German, and
French which can be used to evaluate com-
pression models across languages and genres.

1 Introduction

Sentence compression aims to produce a summary
of a single sentence that retains the most important
information while preserving its fluency. The task
has attracted much attention due to its potential
for applications such as text summarization (Jing,
2000; Madnani et al., 2007; Woodsend and Lap-
ata, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), subtitle
generation (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004; Luoto-
lahti and Ginter, 2015), and the display of text on
small-screens (Corston-Oliver, 2001).

The bulk of research on sentence compression
has focused on a simplification of the task in-
volving exclusively word deletion (Knight and
Marcu, 2002; Riezler et al., 2003; Turner and
Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and La-
pata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009), whereas a
few approaches view sentence compression as a
more general text rewriting problem (Galley and
McKeown, 2007; Woodsend and Lapata, 2010;
Cohn and Lapata, 2013). Irrespective of how

the compression task is formulated, most previ-
ous work relies on syntactic information such as
parse trees to help decide what to delete from a
sentence or which rules to learn in order to rewrite
a sentence using less words. More recently, there
has been much interest in applying neural network
models to natural language generation tasks, in-
cluding sentence compression (Rush et al., 2015;
Filippova et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Kikuchi
et al., 2016). Filippova et al. (2015) focus on
deletion-based sentence compression which they
model as a sequence labeling problem using a re-
current neural network with long short-term mem-
ory units (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber
1997). Rush et al. (2015) capture the full gamut of
rewrite operations drawing insights from encoder-
decoder models recently proposed for machine
translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015).

Neural network-based approaches are data-
driven, relying on the ability of recurrent archi-
tectures to learn continuous features without re-
course to preprocessing tools or syntactic infor-
mation (e.g., part-of-speech tags, parse trees).
In order to achieve good performance, they re-
quire large amounts of training data, in the re-
gion of millions of long-short sentence pairs.2

Existing compression datasets are several orders
of magnitude smaller. For example, the Ziff-
Davis corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2002) con-
tains 1,067 sentences and originated from a col-
lection of news articles on computer products.
Clarke and Lapata (2008) create two manual cor-
pora sampled from written (1,433 sentences) and
spoken sources (1,370 sentences). Cohn and La-
pata (2013) elicit manual compressions for 625
sentences taken from newspaper articles. More
recently, Toutanova et al. (2016) crowdsource a
larger corpus which contains manual compres-
sions for single and multiple sentences (about
26,000 pairs of source and compressed texts).

2Rush et al. (2015) use approximately four million train-
ing instances and Filippova et al. (2015) two million.

Since large scale compression datasets do not
occur naturally, they must be somehow approx-
imated, e.g., by pairing headlines with the first
sentence of a news article (Filippova and Altun,
2013; Rush et al., 2015). As a result, the train-
ing corpus construction process must be repeated
and reconfigured for new languages and domains
(e.g., many headline-first sentence pairs are spu-
rious and need to be filtered using language and
domain specific heuristics). And although it may
be easy to automatically obtain large scale training
data in the news domain, it is not clear how such
data can be sourced for many other genres with
different writing conventions.

Our work addresses the paucity of data for sen-
tence compression models. We argue that multi-
lingual corpora are a rich source for learning a va-
riety of rewrite rules across languages and that ex-
isting neural machine translation (NMT) models
(Sutskever et al. 2014; Bahdanau et al. 2015) can
be easily adapted to the compression task through
bilingual pivoting (Mallinson et al., 2017) coupled
with methods which decode the output sequence
to a desired length (e.g., subject to language and
genre requirements). We obtain compressions by
translating a source string into a foreign language
and then back-translating it into the source while
controlling the translation length (Kikuchi et al.,
2016). Our model can be trained for any language
as long as a bilingual corpus is available, and can
perform arbitrary rewrites while taking advantage
of multiple pivots if these exist.We also demon-
strate that models trained on multilingual data per-
form well out-of-domain.

Although our approach does not employ com-
pression corpora for training, for evaluation pur-
poses, we create MOSS, a new Multilingual
Compression dataset for English, French, and Ger-
man. MOSS is a parallel corpus containing doc-
uments from the European parliament proceed-
ings, TED talks, news commentaries, and the EU
bookshop. Each document is written in English,
French, and German, and compressed by native
speakers of the respective language who process
a document at a time. We obtain five compres-
sions per document leading to 2,000 long-short
sentence pairs per language. Like previous related
resources (Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and La-
pata, 2013; de Loupy et al., 2010) our corpus is cu-
rated manually, however it differs from Toutanova
et al. (2016) in that it contains compressions for
individual sentences, not documents.

There has been relatively little interest in com-
pressing languages other than English. A few
models have been proposed for Japanese (Hori
and Furui, 2004; Hirao et al., 2009; Harashima
and Kurohashi, 2012), including a neural network
model (Hasegawa et al., 2017) which repurposes
Filippova and Altun’s (2013) data construction
method for Japanese. There is a compression cor-
pus available for French (de Loupy et al., 2010),
however, we are not aware of any modeling work
on this language. Overall, there are no standard-
ized datasets in languages other than English, ei-
ther for training or testing.

Our contributions in this work are three-fold:
a novel application of bilingual pivoting to sen-
tence compression; corroborated by empirical re-
sults showing that our model scales across lan-
guages and text genres without additional supervi-
sion over and above what is available in the bilin-
gual parallel data; and the release of a multilin-
gual, multi-reference compression corpus which
can be effectively used to gain insight in the
compression task and facilitate further research in
compression modeling.

2 Pivot-based Neural Compression

In our pivot-based sentence compression model
an input sequence is first translated into a for-
eign language, and then back into the source lan-
guage. Unlike previous paraphrasing pivoting
models (Mallinson et al., 2017), we parameterize
our translation models with a length feature, which
allows us to produce compressed output. We de-
fine two models, performing compression in one
step or alternatively in two steps which affords
more flexibility in model output.

2.1 NMT Background
In the neural encoder-decoder framework for MT
(Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014),
an encoder takes in a source X = (x1, ...,xTx) of
length Tx and the decoder generates a target se-
quence (y1, ...,yTy) of length Ty. Let hi be the hid-
den state of the source symbol at position i, ob-
tained by concatenating the forward and backward
encoder RNN hidden states, hi = [

−→
hi ;
←−
hi ]. We de-

viate from previous work (Bahdanau et al., 2015;
Sutskever et al., 2014) in that we initialize the de-
coder with the average of the hidden states, fol-
lowing Sennrich et al. (2017):

s0 = tanh(Winit
∑Txi=1 hi

Tx
) (1)



2455

where Winit is a learnt parameter. Our decoder is a
conditional recurrent neural network, specifically
a gated recurrent unit (GRU, Cho et al., 2014) with
attention, which we denote as cGRUatt . cGRUatt
takes as input the previous hidden state s j−1, the
source annotations C = h1, ...,hTx , and the previ-
ously decoded symbol y j−1 in order to update its
hidden state s j, which is used to decode symbol y j
at position j:

s j = cGRUatt(s j−1,y j−1,C) (2)

cGRUatt consists of three components. The first
combines the previously decoded symbol y j−1 and
the previous hidden state s j−1 to generate an inter-
mediate representation s′j. The attention mecha-
nism, AT T , inputs the entire context set C along
with intermediate hidden state s′j in order to com-
pute the context vector c j:

c j = AT T (C,s′j) =
Tx

∑
i

αi jhi (3)

αi j =
exp(ei j)

∑Txk=1 exp(ek j)
(4)

ei j = f (s′j,hi) (5)

Where αi j is the normalized alignment weight be-
tween the source symbol at position i and the tar-
get symbol at position j, and f is a feedfoward
neural network.

Finally, we generate s j, the hidden state
of cGRUatt , by using the intermediate representa-
tion s′j and the context vector c j. Given s j, y j−1,
and c j the output probability p(y j|s j,y j−1,c j) is
computed using a feedforward neural network
with a softmax activation. We define the proba-
bility of sequence y as:

P(y|x;θ) =
Ty

∏
j=1

p(y j|s j,y j−1,c j) (6)

2.2 Length Control
To be able to produce compressed sentences, we
parameterize our model with a length vector which
allows to control the output length. Our approach
is similar to the LenInit model of Kikuchi et al.
(2016), however we use a GRU instead of an
LSTM. The hidden state of the decoder consists
of the average of the encoder’s hidden states but
also a length vector LV , a learnt parameter, which
is scaled by the desired target length Ty′ . We there-
fore rewrite Equation (1) as follows:

s′0 = tanh
(

Winit
[∑Txi=1 hi

Tx
;LV ·Ty′

])
(7)

As such we now define our model as:

P(y|x,Ty′ ;θ) (8)

During training, the target length is set to Ty′ = Ty.
However, at test time, the target length generally
varies according to the domain, genre, and lan-
guage at hand. We determine the target length ex-
perimentally based on a small validation set.

2.3 Pivoting

Pivoting is often used in machine translation to
overcome the shortage of parallel data, i,e., when
there is no translation path from the source lan-
guage to the target by taking advantage of paths
through an intermediate language. The idea dates
back at least to Kay (1997), who observed that am-
biguities in translating from one language onto an-
other may be resolved if a translation into some
third language is available, and has met with suc-
cess in phrase-based SMT (Wu and Wang, 2007;
Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) and more recently in
neural MT systems (Firat et al., 2016).

We use pivoting to provide a path from a source
English sentence, via an intermediate foreign lan-
guage, to English in a compressed form. We pro-
pose to extend Mallinson et al.’s (2017) approach
to multi-pivoting, where a sentence x is translated
to K-best foreign pivots, Fx = { f1, ..., fK}. The
probability of generating compression y = y1...yTy
is decomposed as:

P(y|x) =
Fx

∑
f

P(y| f ;
−→
θ ) ·P( f |x;

←−
θ ) (9)

which we approximate as the tokenwise weighted
average of the pivots:

P(y|x)≈
Ty

∏
j=1

Fx

∑
f

P(y j|y< j, f )P( f |x) (10)

where y< j = y1, ...y j . To ensure a probability dis-
tribution, we normalize the K-best list Fx, such
that the translation probabilities sum to one. We
use beam search to decode tokens by conditioning
on multiple pivoting sentences. The results with
the best decoding scores are considered candidate
compressions.

To ensure the model produces compressed out-
put, we extend the pivoting approach in two ways.
In single step compression, one of the translation

F

∑
f

P(y| f ,Ty′ ;

We find that dual-compression performs better
when the system is expected to drastically com-
press the source sentence (e.g., in a headline gen-
eration task). Imposing a high compression ra-
tio from the start tends to produce unintelligible
text. The model attempts to reduce the length of
the source at all costs, even at the expense of be-
ing semantically faithful to the input. Performing
two moderate compressions in succession reduces
both length and content conservatively and as a re-
sult produces more meaningful text.

In Figure 1 we illustrate how the pivot-based
model sketched above can successfully control the
output of the generated compressions. We show
the output of a single-step compression model on
three languages initialized with varying compres-
sion rates3 (see Section 4 for details on how the
models were trained and tested). The compression
rate (CR) is used to determine length parameter of
Equation (8):

Ty′ = Tx ·CR (11)

language (Mallinson et al., 2017). We can see that
the majority of sentences are generated with length
close to the desired compression rate.

3 The MOSS Dataset

For evaluation purposes, we created a multilingual
sentence compression corpus in English, German,
and French. The corpus was collated from exist-
ing document and sentence aligned multilingual
datasets which vary both in terms of topic and
genre. We sampled five documents each from:

1. Europarl, the European Parliament Proceed-
ings Parallel Corpus (Koehn, 2005), has been
used extensively in machine translation re-
search; it contains the minutes of the Euro-
pean parliament and is a spoken corpus of
formulaic nature; speakers take part in de-
bating various issues concerning EU policy
(e.g., taxation, environment).

2. The TED parallel Corpus (Cettolo et al.,
2012) contains transcripts in multiple lan-
guages of short talks devoted to spreading
powerful ideas on a variety of topics ranging
from science to business and global issues.

3. The EU bookshop corpus (Skadiņš et al.,
2014) contains publications from European
institutions covering a variety of topics such
as refugees, gender equality, and travel.

4. The News Commentary Parallel Corpus con-
tains articles downloaded from Project Syn-
dicate, an international media organization
that publishes commentary on global topics
(e.g., economics, world affairs).

We obtained compressions using the Crowd-
flower platform. Crowdworkers were given in-
structions that explained the task and defined sen-
tence compression with the aid of examples. They

were asked to compress while preserving the most
important information, ensuring the sentences re-
mained grammatical and meaning preserving. An-
notators were encouraged to use any rewriting op-
erations that seemed appropriate, e.g., to delete
words, add new words, substitute them, or reorder
them. Annotation proceeded on a document-by-
document basis, line-by-line. Crowdworkers com-
pressed the first twenty lines of each document and
we elicited five compression per document. Exam-
ple compressions are shown in Table 1.

Table 2 presents various statistics on our cor-
pus. As can be seen, Europarl contains the longest
sentences across languages (see column SL), TED
contains the shortest sentences, while the other
two corpora are somewhere in-between. We also
observe that crowdworkers compress the least
when it comes to TED (see column CR), which is
not surprising given the brevity of the utterances.
Overall, French speakers seem more conservative
when shortening sentences compared to English
and German. In general, compression rates are
genre dependent, they range from 0.58 (for En-
glish Europarl) to 0.84 (for German TED). We also
examined the degree to which crowdworkers para-
phrase the source sentence using Translation Edit
Rate (TER; Snover et al., 2006), a measure com-

monly used to automatically evaluate the quality
of machine translation output. We used TER to
compute the (average) number of edits required
to change a long sentence to shorter output. We
also report the number of edits by type, i.e., the
number of insertions, substitutions, deletions, and
shifts needed (on average) to convert long to short
sentences. We observe that crowdworkers perform
a fair amount of rewriting across corpora and lan-
guages. The most frequent rewrite operations are
deletions followed by substitutions, shifts, and in-
sertions.

4 Experimental Setup

Neural Machine Translation Training Nema-
tus (Sennrich et al., 2017) was used as the ma-
chine translation system for all our experiments.
We generally used the default settings and training
procedures as specified within Nematus. All net-
works have a hidden layer size of 1,000, and an
embedding layer size of 512. In addition, layer
normalization (Ba et al., 2016) was used. Dur-
ing training, we used ADAM (Kingma and Ba,
2014), a minibatch size of 80, and the training set
was reshuffled between epochs. We also employed
early stopping.

We used up to four encoder-decoder NMT
models in our experiments (BLEU scores4

shown in parentheses): English→French (27.03),
French→English (29.14), English→German
(28.3), and German→English (31.19). German
training/test data was taken from the WMT16
shared task and French from the WMT14 shared
task. The training data was 4.2 million and
39 million sentence pairs for en-de, and en-fr,
respectively. We also used back-translated mono-
lingual training data, from the news domain,
(Sennrich et al., 2016a) in training for the German
systems. The data was pre-processed using
standard scripts found in MOSES (Koehn et al.,
2007). Rare words were split into sub-word units,
using byte pair encoding (BPE; Sennrich et al.
2016b). The BPE operations are shared between
language directions.

We experimented with various model variants
using one or multiple pivots. The compression
rate (see Equation (8)) was tuned experimentally
on the validation set which consists of one doc-
ument from each domain (20 source sentences;
100 compression-pairs). Compression rates varied
from 0.55 to 0.85 and were broadly comparable to
those shown in Table 2.

4BLEU scores were calculated using mteval-v13a.pl.

Comparison Systems We compared our model
against ABS, a sequence-to-sequence attention-
based model, developed by Rush et al. (2015).
This model was trained on a monolingual dataset
extracted from the Annotated English Gigaword
corpus (Napoles et al., 2011). The dataset con-
sists of approximately 4 million pairs of the first
sentence from each source document and its head-
line. We also trained LenInit (Kikuchi et al., 2016)
on the same corpus which is conceptually sim-
ilar to ABS but additionally controls the output
length using a length embedding vector (as de-
scribed in Section 2.2).5 Unfortunately, we could
not train these models for French or German, since
there are no monolingual sentence compression
datasets available at a similar scale. An obvious
workaround is to translate Gigaword to French and
German and then train compression models on the
translated data. As the quality of the translation
is relatively poor, we also translated German or
French into English, compressed it with ABS and
LenInit trained on the Gigaword corpus, and then
translated the compressions back to French or Ger-
man. Finally, we include a prefix (Pfix) baseline
which does not perform any rewriting but simply
truncates the source sentence so that it matches the

MOSS Evaluation We assessed model perfor-
mance using three automatic metrics which rep-
resent different aspects of the compression task
and have been found to correlate well with hu-
man judgments (Toutanova et al., 2016; Clarke
and Lapata, 2006). These include a recall met-
ric based on skip bi-grams, any pair of words in a
sequence allowing for gaps of size four6 (RS-R);
a recall metric based on bi-grams of dependency
tree triples (D2-R); and bi-gram ROUGE (R2-F1).
We used the Stanford neural network parser (Chen
and Manning, 2014) to obtain dependency triples.

Table 3(a) reports results on English with a
model which controls the output length (L) and
uses either a single pivot (SP; K = 1) or multi-
ple pivots (MP; K = 10). We experimented with
French (fr) or German (de) as pivot languages.
All pivot-based models perform compression in a
single step (see Section 2.3). Dual-step compres-

5We used our own implementation of ABS and LenInit
which on DUC-2004 obtained ROUGE scores similar to those
published in Rush et al. (2015) and Kikuchi et al. (2016).

6We add a begin-of-sentence marker at the start of the can-
didate and reference sentences.

sion obtained inferior results which we omit for
the sake of brevity. As can be seen, models which
use a single pivot are better than those using mul-
tiple ones (German is better than French; see SPde
vs SP f r). More pivots might introduce noise at the
expense of translation quality.

Overall, pivot-based models outperform ABS
and LenInit. This is perhaps to be expected since
these models are tested on out of domain data
with different vocabulary and writing conventions;
MOSS does not contain any newspaper articles.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to train ABS and
LenInt on in-domain data as compression data
only exists for the headlines-first sentences pairs.
As an upper bound, we also report how well hu-
mans agree with each other, treating one (ran-
domly selected) reference as system output and
computing how it agrees with the rest (row Gold
in Table 3). All models lag significantly behind
human performance on this task.

Tables 3(b) and 3(c) report results on French
and German, respectively. For these languages, we
obtained best results with English as pivot, using a
single-step compression model. ABS and LenInit
perform poorly when trained directly on transla-
tions of Gigaword into French and German; their
performance improves considerably when they are
trained on the Gigaword and used to compress En-
glish translations of French or German (ABSen,
LenIniten). Again, we observe that our models
(SPL ,en, MPL ,en) outperform the comparison sys-
tems across all metrics and that using a single
pivot yields better compressions. Example com-
pressions are given in Table 4 where we show out-
put produced by ABS and SP for each language
(see the supplementary material for more exam-
ples). Finally, notice that automatic scores for the
prefix baseline across languages are misleadingly
high, since it simply repeats the source sentence up
to a fixed length without performing any rewriting.

We also elicited human judgments through the
Crowdflower platform. We asked crowdworkers to
rate the grammaticality of the target compressions
and whether they preserved the most important in-
formation from the source. In both cases, they
used a five-point rating scale where a high num-
ber indicates better performance. We randomly
selected 25 sentences from each corpus from the
test portion of MOSS, i.e., 100 long-short sen-
tence pairs per language. We compared compres-
sions generated by our model (SPL ), with ABS
models for the three languages, the prefix base-
line, and (randomly selected) gold-standard ref-
erence (Ref) compressions from MOSS. All sys-
tems used the length parameter to allow compar-
isons with approximately the same compression
rates. We collected five ratings per compression.
Our results are summarized in Table 5. We show
mean ratings for grammaticality (Gram), impor-
tance (Imp) and their combination (column Avg).
Across languages our model (SPL) significantly
(p < 0.05) outperforms comparison systems (Pfix,
ABS) on both dimensions of grammaticality and
importance (significance tests were performed us-
ing a student t-test). All systems are significantly
worse (p < 0.05) than the human reference com-
pressions.

Finally, in Table 6 we analyze the output of
our best model (SPL ) using the same statistics
we applied to the human compressions (see Ta-
ble 2). As can be seen, the model generally com-
pressess more aggressively and applies more ed-

and TER scores are higher for all three languages).
Although the rate of deletions is similar to hu-
mans, insertions, substitutions and shifts happen
to a greater extent for our model, indicating that it
performs a good amount of paraphrasing.

DUC-2004 Evaluation Besides MOSS, we eval-
uated our model on the benchmark DUC-2004
task-1 dataset. In this task, the aim is to create
a very short summary (75 bytes) for a document.
The evaluation set consists of 500 source docu-
ments (from the New York Times and Associated
Press Wire services) each paired with four human-
written (reference) summaries. We follow previ-
ous work (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016)
in compressing the first sentence of the document
and presenting this as the summary. To make the
evaluation unbiased to length, the output of all sys-
tems is cut-off after 75-characters and no bonus is
given for shorter summaries.

Our results are shown in Table 7. To com-
pare with existing methods, we also report ROUGE
(Lin, 2004) unigram and bigram overlap (Lin,
2004) and the longest common subsequence
(ROUGE-L).9 We employed a dual step com-
pression model (see Section 2) as preliminary ex-
periments showed that it was superior to single-
stage variants. We compared single and multi-
ple pivot models against existing ABS and ABS+
(Rush et al., 2015), two encoder-decoder models
trained on the English Gigaword. ABS+ applies
minimum error rate (MERT) training as a copy-

ing mechanism. LenEmb and LenInit include a
length parameter (Kikuchi et al., 2016), whereas
RAS uses a specialized recurrent neural network
architecture (Elman, 1990). We also report how
well DUC-2004 abstractors agree with each other
(row Gold in Table 7). Example compressions are
given in Table 8, where we show output produced
by SPL ,de and a human reference (see the supple-
mentary material for further examples).

Using automatic metrics we see that our model
generally performs worse compared to these sys-
tems and that German is the best pivot for English.
Although the objective of this paper is not to ob-
tain state-of-the-art scores on this evaluation set,
it is interesting to see that our model is able to
compress out-of-domain. We do not have access
to headline-first sentence pairs, while all compar-
ison systems do. We also elicited human judg-
ments on the compressions of 100 lead sentences
whose documents were randomly selected from
the DUC-2004 test set. We compared the prefix
baseline, our model (SPL ,de), ABS+ (Rush et al.,
2015), LenEmb (Kikuchi et al., 2016), Topiary
(Zajic et al., 2004), and a randomly selected ref-
erence. Topiary came top in almost all measures
in the DUC-2004 evaluation; it first compresses
the lead sentence using linguistically motivated
heuristics and then enhances it with topic key-
words. Crowdworkers rated grammaticality and
importance, using a five-point scale; we collected
five ratings per compression.

As shown in Table 9 ABS+ has the lead with our
system following suit. In terms of grammaticality,
ABS+ and SPL ,de are not significantly different
from the gold standard or from each other (Pfix,
Topiary, and LenEmb are significantly worse than
Gold; p < 0.05). In terms of importance, pairwise
differences between systems and the gold standard
are not significant. Overall, we observe that SPL ,de
performs comparably to ABS+ even though it was

not trained on any compression specific data. In-
spection of system output reveals that our model
performs more paraphrasing than comparison sys-
tems (a conclusion also confirmed by the statistics
in Table 6).

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that multilingual cor-
pora can be used to bootstrap compression mod-
els across languages and text genres. Our ap-
proach adapts existing neural machine translation
machinery to the compression task coupled with
methods which decode the output to a desired
length. An interesting direction for future work
would be to train our model using reinforcement
learning (Ranzato et al., 2016; Zhang and Lapata,
2017) in order to control the compression output
more directly. Moreover, although we do not use
any direct supervision in our experiments, it would
be interesting to incorporate it as a means of do-
main adaptation (Cheng et al., 2016).
