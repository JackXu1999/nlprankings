Abstract

Because most multiword expressions
(MWEs), especially verbal ones, are seman-
tically non-compositional, their automatic
identification in running text is a prerequi-
site for semantically-oriented downstream
applications. However, recent developments,
driven notably by the PARSEME shared task
on automatic identification of verbal MWEs,
show that this task is harder than related tasks,
despite recent contributions both in multilin-
gual corpus annotation and in computational
models. In this paper, we analyse possible
reasons for this state of affairs. They lie in the
nature of the MWE phenomenon, as well as
in its distributional properties. We also offer
a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art
systems, which exhibit particularly strong
sensitivity to unseen data. On this basis, we
claim that, in order to make strong headway
in MWE identification, the community should
bend its mind into coupling identification of
MWEs with their discovery, via syntactic
MWE lexicons. Such lexicons need not
necessarily achieve a linguistically complete
modelling of MWEs’ behavior, but they
should provide minimal morphosyntactic
information to cover some potential uses, so
as to complement existing MWE-annotated
corpora. We define requirements for such
a minimal NLP-oriented lexicon, and we
propose a roadmap for the MWE community
driven by these requirements.

1 Introduction

Multiword expression (MWE) is a generic term
which encompasses a large variety of linguistic
objects: compounds (to and fro, crystal clear,
a slam dunk ‘an easily achieved victory’)1, ver-
bal idioms (to take pains ‘to try hard’), light-verb

1Henceforth, we highlight in bold the lexicalized com-
ponents of MWEs, i.e. those always realized by the same
lexemes.

constructions (to pay a visit ), verb-particle con-
structions (to take off ), institutionalized phrases
(traffic light ), multiword terms (neural net-
work ) and multiword named entities (Federal
Bureau of Investigation). They all share the
characteristic of exhibiting lexical, morphosyntac-
tic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyn-
crasies (Baldwin and Kim, 2010). Most notably,
they usually display non-compositional semantics,
i.e. their meaning cannot be deduced from the
meanings of their components and from their syn-
tactic structure in a way deemed regular for the
given language. Computational methods are, con-
versely, mostly compositional, therefore they of-
ten fail to model and process MWEs appropriately.
Special, MWE-dedicated, treatment can be envis-
aged, provided that we know which parts of the
text are concerned, i.e. we should be able to per-
form MWE identification.

MWE identification (MWEI) consists in auto-
matically annotating MWEs occurrences in run-
ning text (Constant et al., 2017). In other words,
we need to be able to distinguish MWEs (e.g. take
pains) from regular word combinations (e.g. take
gloves) in context. This task proves very chal-
lenging for some categories of MWEs, as evi-
denced by two recent PARSEME shared tasks on
automatic identification of verbal MWEs (Savary
et al., 2017; Ramisch et al., 2018). We claim that
the difficulty of this task lies in the nature of id-
iosyncrasies that various categories of MWEs ex-
hibit with respect to regular word combinations.
Namely, whereas many constructions (e.g. named
entities) have a good generalisation potential for
machine learning NLP methods, other MWEs, e.g.
verbal ones, are mostly regular at the level of to-
kens, so the generalisation power of mainstream
machine learning is relatively weak for them.
However, they are idiosyncratic at the level of
types (sets of surface realizations of the same ex-



80

pression), therefore type-specific information, ex-
ploited by MWE discovery methods and encoded
in lexicons, should be very helpful for MWEI.

This paper is a position statement based on an
analysis of the state of the art in MWEI. We claim
that, in order to make strong headway in MWEI,
the community should bend its mind into cou-
pling this task with MWE discovery via syntac-
tic MWE lexicons. Such lexicons need not nec-
essarily achieve a linguistically complete mod-
elling of MWEs’ behavior, but they should provide
minimal morphosyntactic information to cover
some potential uses, so as to complement existing
MWE-annotated corpora. This also implies that,
in building such lexicons, we can take advantage
of the rich body of works dedicated to MWE dis-
covery methods (Evert, 2005; Pecina, 2008; Sere-
tan, 2011; Ramisch, 2015), provided that they are
extended, so as to: (i) cover most syntactic types
of MWEs, (ii) produce not only lists of newly dis-
covered MWE entries but also their type-specific
morphosyntactic properties.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. We discuss some linguistic properties of
MWEs (Sec. 2) and state-of-the-art results (Sec. 3)
relevant to our claims. We propose a scenario for
coupling MWEI with MWE discovery via syntac-
tic MWE lexicons (Sec. 6). Finally, we conclude
by proposing a roadmap for the future efforts of
the MWE community (Sec. 7).

2 The nature of MWEs

We propose to divide MWE categories roughly
into two meta-categories, depending on the na-
ture of the processes which provoke their lexical-
ization, that is, the assignment of conventional,
fixed, non-compositional meanings. On the one
hand, there are multiword named entities (NEs)
and multiword terms, henceforth called sublan-
guage MWEs (SL-MWEs), whose form-meaning
association is usually determined by sublanguage
experts. Because such expert groups are more
or less restricted and have dedicated nomencla-
ture instruments (scientific publications, naming
committees, etc.), and because technological do-
mains and real-world entities to name develop
rapidly, multiword terms and NEs strongly prolif-
erate. On the other hand, general language MWEs
(GL-MWEs)2 are coined by much larger commu-

2The border between SL-MWEs and GL-MWEs is fuzzy,
but this characterization is useful for our argumentation.

nities of speakers via informal processes, and take
longer to be established in a language. This prolif-
eration speed property (henceforth referred to as
Pprolif) is the first SL-MWE vs. GL-MWE discrep-
ancy we are interested in.

The second property (henceforth, Pdiscr) is the
nature of discrepancies which statistically distin-
guish MWEs from regular word combinations.
SL-MWEs exhibit peculiarities at the level of to-
kens (individual occurrences). For instance multi-
word NEs are usually capitalized and often con-
tain, follow or precede trigger words (Bureau,
river, Mr.). Multiword terms often contain words
which are less likely in general than in techni-
cal language (neural ). GL-MWEs, conversely, are
mostly regular at the level of tokens (e.g. they use
no capitalization, are rarely signaled by triggers,
and contain common frequent words) but idiosyn-
cratic at the level of types (sets of surface real-
izations of the same expression). For instance, to
take pains ‘to try hard’ does not admit noun in-
flection (i.e. to take the pain cannot be interpreted
idiomatically), while similar regular word com-
binations like to take gloves and to relieve pains
have very similar meaning to their morphosyntac-
tic variants to take the glove or to relieve the pain.

The third relevant property (Psim) is the compo-
nent similarity among MWEs. A strong similar-
ity, whether at the level of surface forms or at the
level of semantics, often occurs between compo-
nents of different SL-MWEs. For instance, new
multiword terms are often created by modifica-
tion or specialization of previously existing ones
(neural network, neural net, recurrent neural
network, neural network pushdown automata,
etc.). Also, many types of NEs come in se-
ries in which some components are identical and
some others vary within a given semantic class,
e.g. American/Brazilian/French/Ethiopian Red
Cross, Nigerian Red Cross Society, Ira-
nian/Iraki Red Crescent Society, Saudi Red
Crescent Authority. In GL-MWEs, the degree
of Psim depends on the category. It is stronger in
light-verb constructions, i.e. verb-noun combina-
tions in which the verb is semantically void or
bleached, and the noun is predicative3, as in to
make a decision and to pay a visit. Many light-
verb constructions are similar to each other be-

3A noun is predicative if it has at least one
semantic argument, according to the PARSEME
guidelines (http://parsemefr.lif.univ-mrs.fr/
parseme-st-guidelines/1.1).

cause of the predicative nature of the nouns but
also because they contain one of the few very fre-
quent light verbs like make, take, etc. (Savary
et al., 2018). Note, however, that these verbs,
are also highly frequent in regular constructions,
i.e. Psim is moderate but Pdiscr is still restricted
to the level of types. Component similarities are
weaker among inherently reflexive verbs, like (PL)
znaleźć się ‘find oneself’. On the one hand, inher-
ently reflexive verbs always contain a (mostly un-
inflected) reflexive clitic (here: się) governed by
a verb. On the other hand, semantically similar
verbs do not systematically form inherently reflex-
ive verbs, e.g. (PL) wyszukać ‘find’ is a synonym
of znaleźć ‘find’ but *wyszukać się ‘find oneself’
is ungrammatical. Finally, verbal idioms, which
cover diverse syntactic structures, are largely dis-
similar to each other but similar to regular con-
structions, e.g. to take pains ‘to try hard’ is a
MWE but to take aches is not.

The fourth property (Pambig) is the very low am-
biguity of word combinations appearing in MWEs.
These combinations are ambiguous because they
can occur both with idiomatic and with literal
readings, as in examples (1) vs. (2) below. Am-
biguity is considered one of the major challenges
posed by MWEs in NLP (Constant et al., 2017).
However, recent work (Savary et al., 2019) shows
that, although most combinations of MWEs’ com-
ponents could potentially be used literally, they are
rarely used so in corpora. Namely, in 5 languages
from different language genera, the idiomaticity
rate of verbal MWEs, i.e. the proportion of id-
iomatic occurrences with respect to the total num-
ber of idiomatic and literal occurrences, ranges
from 0.96 to 0.98. This means that, whenever
the morphosyntactic conditions for an idiomatic
reading are fulfilled, this reading occurs almost
always. A similarly high idiomaticity rate (0.95)
was also observed for Polish on other, non-verbal
categories of MWEs: nominal, adjectival, and
adverbial GL-MWEs, as well as multiword NEs
(Waszczuk et al., 2016). This property might be
related to the fact that ambiguity is reduced with
the addition of words to the context, a hypothe-
sis that has been employed in word-sense disam-
biguation for many years (Yarowsky, 1993).

(1) We often took pains not to harm them.
‘We often tried hard not to harm them.’

(2) I could not

take the

::::
pain any longer.

Finally, the fifth property (Pzipf) we are inter-

ested in is the Zipfian distribution of MWEs. As
most language phenomena, few MWE types oc-
cur frequently in texts, and there is a long tail
of MWEs occurring rarely (Ha et al., 2002; Ry-
land Williams et al., 2015). The success of ma-
chine learning generalization relies on dealing
with rare or unseen events, based on their similar-
ity with frequent ones. Such similarity is hard to
define for the heterogeneous phenomena included
under the MWE denomination.

3 State of the art in MWE identification

In this section we offer a comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art results with respect to two axes:
SL-MWEs vs. GL-MWEs and seen vs. unseen
data. All results are indicated in terms of the F1-
measure, with the exact-match metric. In other
words, a prediction for a text fragment is consid-
ered correct only when the identified unit corre-
sponds to exactly the same words as in the gold
standard.4 For most SL-MWE results, the F1-
measure additionally accounts for categorisation,
i.e. a correctly identified span of words must also
be assigned the correct NE category.

3.1 Identification of sublanguage MWEs
For SL-MWEs, identification methods have been
developed for decades, but most often fuse multi-
word objects with single-word ones. Two typical
examples are NE recognition and term identifica-
tion. In these two domains, state-of-the-art results
have been encouraging or good already in early
systems and evaluation campaigns.

In the CoNLL 2002 and 2003 shared tasks
on NE recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002;
Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), dedi-
cated mainly to person, organization and location
names, the top-3 systems obtained F1-measures
of 0.71, 0.74, 0.77, and 0.86, with datasets of
20,000, 13,000, 18,000 and 35,000 annotated NEs,
for German, Dutch, Spanish and English, respec-
tively. All of these systems used machine learning
techniques such as hidden Markov models, deci-
sion trees, MaxEnt classifiers, conditional random
fields, support-vector machines, recurrent neural
networks, with features that often included exter-
nal entity list lookup.5 Yadav and Bethard (2018)
provide more recent state-of-the-art results for NE

token-based, in the PARSEME shared task campaigns.

recognition based on neural networks on the same
datasets. There, the best results mostly exceed
0.78 for German, 0.85 for Dutch and Spanish, and
0.9 for English, even without external dictionary
lookup. In Slavic languages, where NE recogni-
tion is substantially hardened by the rich declen-
sion of nouns and adjectives, stable benchmarking
data are still missing.6 Sample results can be cited
in Polish, where relatively rich NE-annotated cor-
pora and lexicons are available. Reference tools
achieve the F1-measure of 0.71 (Marcińczuk et al.,
2017) and 0.77 (Waszczuk et al., 2013) with meth-
ods based on conditional random fields.

As for term identification, several domain-
specific benchmarking datasets allowed for sys-
tem development and comparison. For instance,
the best systems for biomedical term identification
obtain F1-measure of about 0.81, 0.85 and 0.88
on disorder, chemical and gene/protein names, re-
spectively (Campos et al., 2012).

While single-word and multiword NEs and
terms are fused in the above results, good hints ex-
ist that the results on multiword NEs and terms are
comparable or better than results on single-word
items. Firstly, the majority of NEs and terms in
corpora consist of several words. For instance, in
the 110,000-token English Wiki50 corpus (Vincze
et al., 2011), around 65% of annotated NEs and
terms consist of at least 2 words. Also in the
JNLPBA and i2b2 shared tasks on biomedical and
medical NE recognition, 55% and 58%, respec-
tively, of all terms are multiword terms (Campos
et al., 2012). Secondly, some NE recognition ef-
forts were explicitly dedicated to boosting per-
formance for multiword NEs and terms. For in-
stance, Downey et al. (2007) achieve F1=0.74 on
the recognition of multiword named entities in a
web corpus with a very simple system based on
n-gram statistics. A baseline system using bidi-
rectional recurrent neural networks (BiLSTM) by
Campos et al. (2012) achieves the F1-measure of
0.74 and 0.81 on bigrams, which are the most fre-
quent multiword terms in the i2b2 and JNLPBA
corpora.

3.2 Identification of general-language MWEs

Within GL-MWEs, multilingual benchmarking
data are available mainly for verbal MWEs via
editions 1.0 and 1.1 of the PARSEME shared tasks

6In the first shared task on NE recognition in Balto-Slavic
languages (Piskorski et al., 2017), only test data but no anno-
tated training data were published.

(Savary et al., 2017; Ramisch et al., 2018). In edi-
tion 1.1, the scores (across 19 languages) for the
top-3 systems range from 0.5 to 0.58. The per-
language scores vary greatly due to corpus size
variety and typological differences between lan-
guages. Table 1 shows the corpus sizes and the
best system F1-measure for the 6 languages whose
corpora contain at least 5,000 annotated verbal
MWEs.7 The results of the best systems, with and
without neural networks, never exceed 0.68, with
the exception of Romanian, which has a low per-
centage of unseen data in the test corpus.

the PARSEME shared task 1.1 for 6 languages with the
largest corpora.

These results are not directly comparable to
those from Sec. 3.1 because evaluation measures
partly differ (e.g., NE recognition includes cate-
gorisation), the sets of languages hardly overlap,
and corpus sizes are largely below those of the
CoNLL corpora.8 Still, it is clear that MWEI is
a particularly hard problem and it is important to
understand the vulnerabilities (if any) of current
approaches.

3.3 Challenges of unseen data
The PARSEME shared task 1.1 introduced
phenomenon-specific evaluation measures which

7Hungarian is left out because its corpus consists of spe-
cialized law texts. Language codes in the tables are: Bulgar-
ian (BG), French (FR), Polish (PL), Portuguese (PT), Roma-
nian (RO), Turkish (TR).

8The PARSEME shared task 1.0 results for Czech, with
12,000 annotated verbal MWEs, come up to F1 = 0.72
with a non-neural system. This might be comparable to the
CoNLL-2002 results for Dutch, with 13,000 annotated NEs
and the top F1-measure of 0.74 for a non-neural system.
However, as many as 69% of the annotated verbal MWEs
in the Czech corpus are inherently reflexive verbs (IRVs),
such as se bavit ‘amuse oneself’⇒‘play’, which are rela-
tively easy to predict due to the moderate strength of Psim.
The Czech corpus was not annotated from scratch but con-
verted from a previously annotated resource, and inherently
reflexive verbs are probably over-represented there. The rate
of inherently reflexive verbs in other Slavic languages in the
PARSEME corpora range from 0.3 to 0.48.



83

focus on known challenges posed by MWEs.
Thus, results were reported separately for con-
tinuous vs. discontinuous, multi-token vs. single-
token, seen vs. unseen, and identical-to-train
vs. variant-of-train verbal MWEs.9 The most dra-
matic performance differences appear in the seen
vs. unseen opposition. A verbal MWE from the
corpus is considered seen if another verbal MWE
with the same multiset of lemmas is annotated at
least once in the training corpus. For instance,
given the occurrence of has a new look in the
training corpus, the following verbal MWEs from
the test corpus would be considered:

• seen: has a new look, had an appealing look,
has a look of innocence, the look that he had

• unseen: has a look at this report, gave a look
to the book, walk that he had, took part, etc.

Tab. 2 shows the PARSEME shared task 1.1
results achieved on seen and unseen data for 3
of the 6 previously analysed languages. French
and Turkish were left out since no lemmas are
provided for 20-30% of their test data. Ro-
manian is skipped because only 5% of its test
corpus corresponds to unseen data. We focus
on the overall best systems in the closed and
open track10: TRAVERSAL (Waszczuk, 2018)
and SHOMA (Taslimipoor and Rohanian, 2018).
The former applies sequential conditional ran-
dom fields extended to tree structures, while the
latter feeds word embeddings to convolutional
and recurrent neural networks, which are given
to a decision layer based on conditional random
fields. On unseen data in the 3 languages un-
der study, TRAVERSAL’s score never exceeds
0.20, and the performance is 3.9 (for Portuguese)
to 6.1 (for Bulgarian) times worse than on seen
data. SHOMA’s generalization power is greater: it
achieves a score of 0.18 (for Polish) to 0.31 (for
Bulgarian and Portuguese) on unseen data, which
is still 2.5 (for Portuguese) to 4.6 (for Polish) times
worse than for seen expressions.

It is also interesting to see which unseen verbal
MWEs categories have been correctly identified
by both systems. Tab. 2 reveals that generalization
is the strongest for inherently reflexive verbs and

can additionally use external resources (lexicons, word em-
beddings, language models trained on external data, etc.).

light-verb constructions, likely due to the moder-
ate inter-MWE component similarity (Psim) dis-
cussed in Sec. 2. Still, it is far below the general-
ization power in SL-MWEs (see below), probably
because Pdiscr is related to types but not tokens.

As far as SL-MWE identification is concerned,
we are aware of only one study explicitly dedi-
cated to the impact of unseen data. Namely, Au-
genstein et al. (2017) compare the performance of
3 state-of-the-art named-entity recognition tools
on 19 NE-annotated datasets in English. For
the CoNLL corpora cited in Sec. 3.1, the scores
achieved on unseen data range from 0.81 to 0.94.
The scores for out-of-domain unseen data are sig-
nificantly lower but still exceed 0.61 for the 2 best
systems. Unseen NEs are defined in this study as
those with surface forms present only in the test,
but not in the training data, which differs from the
PARSEME shared task 1.1 definition (where data
with different surface forms are considered seen if
they have seen multisets of lemmas). Still, mor-
phosyntactic variability in English NEs should be
relatively low, therefore we may safely deduce that
MWEI on unseen data performs significantly bet-
ter on SL-MWEs in a morphologically-poor lan-
guage than on GL-MWEs in morphologically-rich
languages. We believe that this is more related to
the SL-MWE vs. GL-MWEs distinction than to ty-
pological differences between languages.11

To conclude, the challenges posed by unseen
data to MWEI seem significantly harder for GL-
MWEs than for SL-MWEs. We attribute this fact
to the different nature of the two phenomena. SL-
MWEs differ from regular word combinations at
the level of tokens (Pdiscr) and exhibit strong sim-
ilarities among components (Psim). These proper-
ties can be leveraged by machine learning tools,
whether supervised (e.g. using character-level fea-
tures or word embeddings, to account for surface
and semantic similarity of NEs components, re-
spectively) or unsupervised (e.g. based on con-
trastive measures for terms), notably to general-
ize over unseen data. Conversely, GL-MWEs are
mostly idiosyncratic at the level of types but not
tokens (Pdiscr) and show moderate or weak com-
ponent similarities (Psim). These charateristics are
hard to tackle by systems which model MWEI as a
tagging problem, except if features based on type-

11PARSEME shared task 1.1 results for identical-to-train
vs. variant-of-train items, presented in the next section, cor-
roborate this intuition: TRAVERSAL and SHOMA handle
morphosyntactic variability much better than lexical novelty.

specific idiosyncrasies are used. The few token-
specific hints (if any) which may help such sys-
tems generalize over unseen data are mostly lim-
ited to the presence of particular light verbs or
function words. Their role resembles the one of
trigger words and nested entities in NE recogni-
tion (Sec. 2), but, differently from the latter, they
are also highly frequent in regular constructions,
which hinders their discriminative power for GL-
MWEs.

3.4 Progress potential in seen data
Since unseen GS-MWEs prove drastically hard to
identify, it is interesting to understand how much
progress might be achieved on seen data. We be-
lieve that this potential of improvement is rela-
tively high due to several factors.

Firstly, the low effective ambiguity of MWEs
(Pambig) means that identifying morphosyntac-
tically well-formed combinations of previously
seen MWE components constitutes a strong base-
line for MWEI. For instance, Pasquer et al.
(2018b) propose a very simple baseline for verb-
noun MWE identification in which previously
seen verb-noun pairs are tagged as MWEs as soon
as they have the same lemmas as a seen MWE and
maintain a direct dependency relation, whatever
the label and direction of this dependency. This
very simple method achieves F1=0.88 on French.
A comparable result was observed in the 2016
DiMSUM shared task (Schneider et al., 2014), in
which a rule-based baseline was ranked second.
This system extracted MWEs from the training
corpus and then annotated them in the test cor-
pus based on lemma/part-of-speech matching and
heuristics such as allowing a limited number of in-
tervening words (Cordeiro et al., 2016).

Secondly, there is a large gap to bridge for
seen data whose surface form is not identical to
the ones seen in train. Tab. 3 shows that, in-
deed, the difference between identical-to-train and

variant-of-train scores ranges from 0.12 (in Polish
for TRAVERSAL and Portuguese for SHOMA) to
0.37 (in Bulgarian for SHOMA). At the same time,
Pasquer et al. (2018a) show that morphosyntactic
variability, relatively high in verbal MWEs, can be
neutralized with dedicated methods. Namely, co-
occurrences of previously seen MWE components
can be effectively recognized by a Naive Bayes
classifier, with features leveraging type-specific
idiosyncrasies (Pdiscr). This method scored the
best in the PARSEME shared task 1.1 for Bulgar-
ian, even if it was restricted to the seen data only.

Thirdly, significant progress can also be
achieved if another important challenge is explic-
itly addressed: discontinuity of verbal MWEs. For
instance, Rohanian et al. (2019) employ neural
methods combining convolution and self-attention
mechanisms and obtain impressive improvements
over the best PARSEME shared task systems.

Finally, not only annotated training corpora but
also MWE lexicons can provide information about
seen data. The two next sections describe the state
of the art in lexical description of MWEs, and in-
tegration of MWE lexicons in NLP methods.

Describing MWEs in dictionaries dedicated to hu-
man users has a long-standing lexicographic tra-
dition, but its synergies with NLP have not been
straightforward (Gantar et al., 2018). More for-
mal linguistic modeling of MWEs has also been
carried out for decades, notably in the frameworks



85

of the Lexicon Grammar (Gross, 1986) and of the
Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (Mel’čuk
et al., 1988; Pausé, 2018). These approaches as-
sume that units of meaning are located at the level
of elementary sentences (predicates with their ar-
guments) rather than of words, and MWEs, espe-
cially verbal, are special instances of predicates
in which some arguments are lexicalized. Those
works paved the way towards systematic syntac-
tic description of MWEs, but suffered from insuf-
ficient formalization and required substantial ac-
commodation to be applicable to NLP (Constant
and Tolone, 2010; Lareau et al., 2012).

With the growing understanding of the chal-
lenges which MWEs pose to NLP, a large num-
ber of (fully or partly) NLP-dedicated lexicons
have been created for many languages (Losne-
gaard et al., 2016). These resources can be clas-
sified notably along 3 axes, according to (i) the ac-
count of the morpho-syntactic structure of a MWE
and its variants, (ii) lexicon-corpus coupling, (iii)
number of entries.

Along axis (i), there is a gradation in the com-
plexity of the related formalisms. The simplest are
raw lists of MWEs, sometimes accompanied with
selected morphosyntactic variants, collected from
large corpora or automatically generated (Stein-
berger et al., 2011).

More elaborate are approaches based on finite-
state-related formalisms. They usually indicate the
morphological categories and features of individ-
ual MWE components, and offer rule-based com-
binatorial description of their variability patterns
(Karttunen et al., 1992; Breidt et al., 1996; Oflazer
et al., 2004; Silberztein, 2005; Krstev et al., 2010;
Al-Haj et al., 2014; Lobzhanidze, 2017; Czere-
powicka and Savary, 2018). They mostly cover
continuous (e.g. nominal) MWEs in which mor-
phosyntactic phenomena remain local (Savary,
2008). Therefore, additionally to the intentional
format, i.e. rules describing the analysis and pro-
duction of MWE instances, they often come with
an extensional format, which stores the MWE in-
stances (inflected forms) themselves. Plain-text
extensional lists can be straightforwardly matched
against a text. Such finite-state frameworks do
not account for deep syntax and for interactions
of MWE lexicalized components with external el-
ements. Therefore, they are not well adapted to
verbal MWEs.

Finally, there exist syntactic lexicons in which

MWEs are most often covered jointly with sin-
gle words. On the one hand, there are ap-
proaches meant to be theory-neutral (Grégoire,
2010; Przepiórkowski et al., 2017; McShane et al.,
2015), i.e. they implicitly assume the existence
of regular grammar rules, and explicitly describe
only those MWE properties which do not con-
form to these rules. Although these lexicons suf-
fer from insufficient formalization (Lichte et al.,
2019), they could be successfully applied to pars-
ing after ad hoc conversion to particular grammar
formalisms. On the other hand, some approaches
accommodate some types of MWEs directly in
the lexicons of computational grammars within
particular grammatical frameworks: head-driven
phrase structure grammar (Sag et al., 2002; Copes-
take et al., 2002; Villavicencio et al., 2004; Bond
et al., 2015; Herzig Sheinfux et al., 2015), lexi-
cal functional grammar (Attia, 2006; Dyvik et al.,
2019), tree-adjoining grammar (Abeillé and Sch-
abes, 1989, 1996; Vaidya et al., 2014; Lichte and
Kallmeyer, 2016), and dependency grammar (Di-
aconescu, 2004).

Along axis (ii), most recent approaches are usu-
ally coupled with corpora, but to a different de-
gree. PDT-Vallex (Urešová, 2012) is a Czech va-
lency dictionary fully aligned with the Prague De-
pendency Treebank, i.e. new frames were added
as they were encountered during manual annota-
tion of the corpus. These frames are also linked
to their corpus instances. Similarly, SemLex (Be-
jček and Straňák, 2010), is a MWE lexicon boot-
strapped from pre-existing dictionaries (not neces-
sary corpus-based) and further developed hand-in-
hand with the PDT annotation. It contains syntac-
tic structures of MWE entries to which corpus oc-
currences are linked. In Walenty (Przepiórkowski
et al., 2014), a Polish valency dictionary, the ini-
tial set of entries stems from pre-existing single-
word e-dictionaries, which were then extended to
MWEs and described as exhaustively as possible
as to their valency frames. All frames are doc-
umented with attested examples, preferably but
not necessarily from the National Corpus of Pol-
ish. In DUELME (Grégoire, 2010), a Dutch MWE
lexicon, all MWE were automatically acquired
from a large raw corpus on the basis of a short
list of morpho-syntactic patterns. Lexicon entries
contain example sentences illustrating the use of
MWEs. Finally, when MWEs were directly ac-
commodated in implemented formal grammars,



86

the choice of MWEs to model is rarely docu-
mented but was probably motivated by a possibly
high syntactic and semantic variety of construc-
tions rather than by corpus frequencies, even if at-
tested examples support the grammar engineering.

Along axis (iii), the sizes of the existing MWE
lexical resources vary greatly, from several dozen
to several tens of thousands of MWE entries. This
coverage is often inversely correlated with the
richness and precision of the linguistic description.

5 MWE lexicons in MWE identification

Handcrafted MWE lexicons, as those addressed
in the previous section, can significantly enhance
MWEI. In sequence tagging MWEI methods, such
resources can be used as sources of lexical fea-
tures (Schneider et al., 2014). In parsing-based ap-
proaches they may serve as a basis for word-lattice
representation of an input sentence, in which the
compositional vs. MWE interpretation of a word
sequence is represented jointly (Constant et al.,
2013). The impact of lexical resources on MWEI
is explicitly addressed by Riedl and Biemann
(2016). Using a CRF-based MWEI system, they
show that the addition of an automatically discov-
ered lexicon of MWEs can benefit MWEI quality.

The systems competing in PARSEME shared
tasks used lexical resources to a much lesser de-
gree. In both editions only one, rule-based, sys-
tem applied a MWE lexicon, for French in edition
1.0 and for English, French, German and Greek
in edition 1.1 (Nerima et al., 2017). Other sys-
tems, even those from the open track, employed
only one type of external resources, namely word
embeddings, but no MWE lexicons. This is prob-
ably due mainly to the fact that the competition
was meant to promote cross-lingual methods, but
few or no MWE lexical frameworks offer large
MWEs lexicons for many languages. The re-
sources covered by the (Losnegaard et al., 2016)
survey are numerous and cover at least 19 lan-
guages, but their formats are not uniform so MWE
identifiers cannot easily integrate them. Another
reason might be that the complex constraints im-
posed by MWEs, especially verbal ones, call for
complex formalisms, whose expressive power is
hard to accommodate with mainstream machine
learning methods. Still, current MWEI identifiers
are able to benefit from rich joint syntactic and
MWE annotation, notably to neutralize variability
(cf. Sec. 3).

6 Towards syntactic lexicons for MWE
identification

As discussed in Sec. 2, MWEs exhibit a Zipfian
distribution (Pzipf), which means that the power
to generalize over unseen data is crucial for high-
quality MWEI. However, as seen in Sec. 3, cur-
rent MWEI methods badly fail on unseen data. At
the same time, performance on seen items can be
very high if morphosyntactic variability is appro-
priately accounted for.

The straightforward idea is then to maximize
the quantity of the seen data. This proposal is of
course trivial with respect to most learning prob-
lems in NLP. But we believe that its applicability
is particularly relevant in the domain of GL-MWE
identification for at least four reasons. Firstly,
there is a particularly acute discrepancy between
the performance on seen vs. unseen data, as dis-
cussed in Sec. 3, so the potential of the gain in this
respect is huge. Secondly, unsupervised discov-
ery of (previously unseen) MWEs has a rich bib-
liography and proves particularly effective when
type-specific idiosyncrasies are exploited (Pdiscr),
for instance, in verb-noun idiom discovery (Fazly
et al., 2009). Thirdly, the low effective ambiguity
of word combinations occurring in MWEs (Pambig)
implies scarcity of naturally occurring negative ex-
amples. Therefore, the Zipfian distribution (Pzipf)
can be partly balanced, with minor bias, by com-
plementing a (small) annotated corpus with sev-
eral minimal positive occurrence examples for
lower-frequency MWEs discovered in very large
corpora by unsupervised methods. Fourthly, the
relatively low proliferation speed (Pprolif) of GL-
MWEs makes them good candidates for large-
coverage lexical encoding. Thus, it should be pos-
sible to produce relatively stable and high-quality
lexical resources via manual validation of unsu-
pervised discovery methods.

The conclusions from Sec. 4 and 5 also speak
in favor of the use of lexical MWE resources in
MWEI, especially if they are offered in a unified
format for many languages, and if they carry infor-
mation similar to what can be found in treebanks.

These observations lead us to propose the fol-
lowing scenario for future development in MWEI.

• Automatic identification of GL-MWEs
should be systematically coupled with MWE
discovery via syntactic lexicons.

• In such lexicons, for each MWE type, one



87

should be able to retrieve at least: (i) the
lemmas and parts of speech of its lexical-
ized components, (ii) its syntactically least
marked dependency structure preserving the
idiomatic reading (Savary et al., 2019),12 (iii)
the description of some of its morphosyntac-
tic variants13 preserving the idiomatic read-
ing, e.g. those judged most frequent or most
discriminating.

• If the lexicon is stored in an intentional for-
mat, it should be distributed with its exten-
sional equivalent. The simplest form of an
extensional format is a set of corpus exam-
ples for each MWE entry, with syntactic and
MWE annotation.

• The extensional format should be compatible
with standard corpus formats,14 so as to re-
quire minimal effort from corpus-based tools
in completing the existing corpora with the
lexicon examples.

• The lexicon should encode with high priority
those MWEs which occur rarely or never in
the reference corpora, i.e. the corpora anno-
tated for MWEs and used for training MWE
identifiers. This is in sharp contrast to the ex-
isting NLP-oriented MWE lexicons more or
less strongly coupled with reference corpora
(see Sec. 4).

Note that exhaustiveness of this description, and
notably of the morphosyntactic variation, is not re-
quired. This feature should make the lexical en-
coding adventure relatively feasible, with the help
of fully and/or semi-automatic methods.

7 Roadmap

To complement the proposal of MWE discov-
ery/identification interface from the previous sec-
tion, we suggest that the MWE community should
more thoroughly address the challenges posed to
MWEI by unseen data. In the short run, fu-
ture shared tasks on MWEI might, for instance,

12A form with a finite verb is less marked than one with an
infinitive or a participle, a non-negated form is less marked
than a negated one, the active voice is less marked than the
passive, a form with an extraction is more marked than with-
out, etc.

13Following (Savary et al., 2019), we understand a vari-
ant of a given MWE as a set of all its occurrences sharing
the same coarse syntactic structure, i.e. the same lexicalized
lemmas, POS and dependency relations.

14PARSEME corpora for verbal MWEs use
an extension of the CoNNL-U format (https:
//universaldependencies.org/format.html) called cupt
(http://multiword.sourceforge.net/cupt-format)

propose subtasks dedicated specifically to unseen
data. New MWEI tools may leverage the type-
specific idiosyncrasy of MWEs (Pdiscr), so as to
achieve better generalization over unseen data.

The community should also put more effort
into the development of large-coverage syntactic
MWE lexicons. To this end, the MWE discov-
ery task should be redefined so that not only bare
lists of MWE candidates but also their syntactic
structures for at least some morphosyntactic vari-
ants are extracted (Weller and Heid, 2010). Many
existing discovery methods are dedicated to se-
lected MWE categories, syntactic patterns and lan-
guages. New methods should, conversely, be more
generic so as to cover the large variety of MWE
categories and adapt to many languages. In or-
der to incrementally achieve high quality for such
resources (e.g. via manual validation), MWE dis-
covery should not be performed from scratch, but
should take as input and enrich existing MWE
lexicons. MWE discovery evaluation measures
should explicitly account for this enrichment as-
pect.

Steps should also be taken towards defining
MWE lexicon formats which would be compat-
ible with the recommendations from Sec. 6. To
this end, a shared task on lexicon format defini-
tions and/or lexicon construction methods could
be organized. A mid-long-term objective of the
community would then be to produce unified mul-
tilingual reference datasets which would consist
both of MWE-annotated corpora (extended to new,
non-verbal MWE categories) and of NLP-oriented
MWE lexicons. We believe that these steps are
necessary to bridge the performance gap between
MWEI and other NLP tasks, so that MWEI be-
comes a regular component of traditional NLP text
analysis pipelines.
