Abstract
Computational modeling of human multi-
modal language is an emerging research
area in natural language processing spanning
the language, visual and acoustic modalities.
Comprehending multimodal language requires
modeling not only the interactions within each
modality (intra-modal interactions) but more
importantly the interactions between modal-
ities (cross-modal interactions). In this pa-
per, we propose the Recurrent Multistage Fu-
sion Network (RMFN) which decomposes the
fusion problem into multiple stages, each of
them focused on a subset of multimodal sig-
nals for specialized, effective fusion. Cross-
modal interactions are modeled using this mul-
tistage fusion approach which builds upon in-
termediate representations of previous stages.
Temporal and intra-modal interactions are
modeled by integrating our proposed fusion
approach with a system of recurrent neural net-
works. The RMFN displays state-of-the-art
performance in modeling human multimodal
language across three public datasets relat-
ing to multimodal sentiment analysis, emotion
recognition, and speaker traits recognition. We
provide visualizations to show that each stage
of fusion focuses on a different subset of mul-
timodal signals, learning increasingly discrim-
inative multimodal representations.

1 Introduction
Computational modeling of human multimodal
language is an upcoming research area in natu-
ral language processing. This research area fo-
cuses on modeling tasks such as multimodal sen-
timent analysis (Morency et al., 2011), emotion
recognition (Busso et al., 2008), and personality
traits recognition (Park et al., 2014). The multi-
modal temporal signals include the language (spo-
ken words), visual (facial expressions, gestures)
and acoustic modalities (prosody, vocal expres-
sions). At its core, these multimodal signals are

Figure 1: An illustrative example for Recurrent Mul-
tistage Fusion. At each recursive stage, a subset of
multimodal signals is highlighted and then fused
with previous fusion representations. The first fu-
sion stage selects the neutral word and frowning
behaviors which create an intermediate represen-
tation reflecting negative emotion when fused to-
gether. The second stage selects the loud voice
behavior which is locally interpreted as empha-
sis before being fused with previous stages into a
strongly negative representation. Finally, the third
stage selects the shrugging and speech elongation
behaviors that reflect ambivalence and when fused
with previous stages is interpreted as a representa-
tion for the disappointed emotion.

highly structured with two prime forms of in-
teractions: intra-modal and cross-modal interac-
tions (Rajagopalan et al., 2016). Intra-modal inter-
actions refer to information within a specific modal-
ity, independent of other modalities. For example,
the arrangement of words in a sentence according



151

to the generative grammar of a language (Chomsky,
1957) or the sequence of facial muscle activations
for the presentation of a frown. Cross-modal in-
teractions refer to interactions between modalities.
For example, the simultaneous co-occurrence of a
smile with a positive sentence or the delayed oc-
currence of a laughter after the end of a sentence.
Modeling these interactions lie at the heart of hu-
man multimodal language analysis and has recently
become a centric research direction in multimodal
natural language processing (Liu et al., 2018; Pham
et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017), multimodal speech
recognition (Sun et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2017;
Harwath and Glass, 2017; Kamper et al., 2017), as
well as multimodal machine learning (Tsai et al.,
2018; Srivastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012; Ngiam
et al., 2011).

Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have
demonstrated the existence of multistage aggre-
gation across human cortical networks and func-
tions (Taylor et al., 2015), particularly during the in-
tegration of multisensory information (Parisi et al.,
2017). At later stages of cognitive processing,
higher level semantic meaning is extracted from
phrases, facial expressions, and tone of voice, even-
tually leading to the formation of higher level cross-
modal concepts (Parisi et al., 2017; Taylor et al.,
2015). Inspired by these discoveries, we hypoth-
esize that the computational modeling of cross-
modal interactions also requires a multistage fusion
process. In this process, cross-modal representa-
tions can build upon the representations learned
during earlier stages. This decreases the burden on
each stage of multimodal fusion and allows each
stage of fusion to be performed in a more special-
ized and effective manner.

In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Multi-
stage Fusion Network (RMFN) which automati-
cally decomposes the multimodal fusion problem
into multiple recursive stages. At each stage, a sub-
set of multimodal signals is highlighted and fused
with previous fusion representations (see Figure 1).
This divide-and-conquer approach decreases the
burden on each fusion stage, allowing each stage
to be performed in a more specialized and effective
way. This is in contrast with conventional fusion
approaches which usually model interactions over
multimodal signals altogether in one iteration (e.g.,
early fusion (Baltrušaitis et al., 2017)). In RMFN,
temporal and intra-modal interactions are modeled
by integrating our new multistage fusion process

with a system of recurrent neural networks. Overall,
RMFN jointly models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions for multimodal language analysis and
is differentiable end-to-end.

We evaluate RMFN on three different tasks re-
lated to human multimodal language: sentiment
analysis, emotion recognition, and speaker traits
recognition across three public multimodal datasets.
RMFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in all
three tasks. Through a comprehensive set of ab-
lation experiments and visualizations, we demon-
strate the advantages of explicitly defining multiple
recursive stages for multimodal fusion.

2 Related Work

Previous approaches in human multimodal lan-
guage modeling can be categorized as follows:
Non-temporal Models: These models simplify
the problem by using feature-summarizing tempo-
ral observations (Poria et al., 2017). Each modality
is represented by averaging temporal information
through time, as shown for language-based senti-
ment analysis (Iyyer et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016)
and multimodal sentiment analysis (Abburi et al.,
2016; Nojavanasghari et al., 2016; Zadeh et al.,
2016; Morency et al., 2011). Conventional su-
pervised learning methods are utilized to discover
intra-modal and cross-modal interactions without
specific model design (Wang et al., 2016; Poria
et al., 2016). These approaches have trouble mod-
eling long sequences since the average statistics do
not properly capture the temporal intra-modal and
cross-modal dynamics (Xu et al., 2013).
Multimodal Temporal Graphical Models: The
application of graphical models in sequence mod-
eling has been an important research problem. Hid-
den Markov Models (HMMs) (Baum and Petrie,
1966), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Laf-
ferty et al., 2001), and Hidden Conditional Random
Fields (HCRFs) (Quattoni et al., 2007) were shown
to work well on modeling sequential data from the
language (Misawa et al., 2017; Ma and Hovy, 2016;
Huang et al., 2015) and acoustic (Yuan and Liber-
man, 2008) modalities. These temporal graphical
models have also been extended for modeling mul-
timodal data. Several methods have been proposed
including multi-view HCRFs where the potentials
of the HCRF are designed to model data from
multiple views (Song et al., 2012), multi-layered
CRFs with latent variables to learn hidden spatio-
temporal dynamics from multi-view data (Song



152

et al., 2012), and multi-view Hierarchical Sequence
Summarization models that recursively build up hi-
erarchical representations (Song et al., 2013).
Multimodal Temporal Neural Networks: More
recently, with the advent of deep learning, Re-
current Neural Networks (Elman, 1990; Jain and
Medsker, 1999) have been used extensively for lan-
guage and speech based sequence modeling (Zilly
et al., 2016; Soltau et al., 2016), sentiment analy-
sis (Socher et al., 2013; dos Santos and Gatti, 2014;
Glorot et al., 2011; Cambria, 2016), and emotion
recognition (Han et al., 2014; Bertero et al., 2016;
Lakomkin et al., 2018). Long-short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997a) have also been extended for multimodal set-
tings (Rajagopalan et al., 2016) and by learning
binary gating mechanisms to remove noisy modali-
ties (Chen et al., 2017). Recently, more advanced
models were proposed to model both intra-modal
and cross-modal interactions. These use Bayesian
ranking algorithms (Herbrich et al., 2007) to model
both person-independent and person-dependent fea-
tures (Liang et al., 2018), generative-discriminative
objectives to learn either joint (Pham et al., 2018) or
factorized multimodal representations (Tsai et al.,
2018), external memory mechanisms to synchro-
nize multimodal data (Zadeh et al., 2018a), or low-
rank tensors to approximate expensive tensor prod-
ucts (Liu et al., 2018). All these methods assume
that cross-modal interactions should be discovered
all at once rather than across multiple stages, where
each stage solves a simpler fusion problem. Our
empirical evaluations show the advantages of the
multistage fusion approach.

3 Recurrent Multistage Fusion Network

In this section we describe the Recurrent Multi-
stage Fusion Network (RMFN) for multimodal lan-
guage analysis (Figure 2). Given a set of modalities{l(anguage), v(isual), a(coustic)}, the signal
from each modality m ∈ {l, v, a} is represented as
a temporal sequence Xm = {xm1 ,xm2 ,xm3 ,�,xmT },
where xmt is the input at time t. Each sequence Xm
is modeled with an intra-modal recurrent neural
network (see subsection 3.3 for details). At time t,
each intra-modal recurrent network will output a
unimodal representation hmt . The Multistage Fu-
sion Process uses a recursive approach to fuse all
unimodal representations hmt into a cross-modal
representation zt which is then fed back into each
intra-modal recurrent network.

3.1 Multistage Fusion Process

The Multistage Fusion Process (MFP) is a modular
neural approach that performs multistage fusion to
model cross-modal interactions. Multistage fusion
is a divide-and-conquer approach which decreases
the burden on each stage of multimodal fusion,
allowing each stage to be performed in a more spe-
cialized and effective way. The MFP has three main
modules: HIGHLIGHT, FUSE and SUMMARIZE.

Two modules are repeated at each stage:
HIGHLIGHT and FUSE. The HIGHLIGHT mod-
ule identifies a subset of multimodal signals from[hlt,hvt ,hat ] that will be used for that stage of fu-
sion. The FUSE module then performs two sub-
tasks simultaneously: a local fusion of the high-
lighted features and integration with representa-
tions from previous stages. Both HIGHLIGHT
and FUSE modules are realized using memory-
based neural networks which enable coherence
between stages and storage of previously mod-
eled cross-modal interactions. As a final step, the
SUMMARIZE module takes the multimodal repre-
sentation of the final stage and translates it into a
cross-modal representation zt.

Figure 1 shows an illustrative example for mul-
tistage fusion. The HIGHLIGHT module selects
“neutral words” and “frowning” expression for the
first stage. The local and integrated fusion at this
stage creates a representation reflecting negative
emotion. For stage 2, the HIGHLIGHT module
identifies the acoustic feature “loud voice”. The
local fusion at this stage interprets it as an expres-
sion of emphasis and is fused with the previous
fusion results to represent a strong negative emo-
tion. Finally, the highlighted features of “shrug”
and “speech elongation” are selected and are lo-
cally interpreted as “ambivalence”. The integration
with previous stages then gives a representation
closer to “disappointed”.

3.2 Module Descriptions

In this section, we present the details of the three
multistage fusion modules: HIGHLIGHT, FUSE
and SUMMARIZE. Multistage fusion begins with
the concatenation of intra-modal network outputs
ht =�m∈M hmt . We use superscript [k] to denote
the indices of each stage k = 1,�,K during K
total stages of multistage fusion. Let ⇥ denote the
neural network parameters across all modules.
HIGHLIGHT: At each stage k, a subset of the

multimodal signals represented in ht will be au-

Figure 2: The Recurrent Multistage Fusion Network for multimodal language analysis. The Multistage
Fusion Process has three modules: HIGHLIGHT, FUSE and SUMMARIZE. Multistage fusion begins
with the concatenated intra-modal network outputs hlt,hvt ,hat . At each stage, the HIGHLIGHT module
identifies a subset of multimodal signals and the FUSE module performs local fusion before integration
with previous fusion representations. The SUMMARIZE module translates the representation at the final
stage into a cross-modal representation zt to be fed back into the intra-modal recurrent networks.

tomatically highlighted for fusion. Formally, this
module is defined by the process function fH :

a[k]t = fH(ht ; a[1∶k−1]t ,⇥) (1)
where at stage k, a[k]t is a set of attention weights
which are inferred based on the previously as-
signed attention weights a[1∶k−1]t . As a result,
the highlights at a specific stage k will be depen-
dent on previous highlights. To fully encapsu-
late these dependencies, the attention assignment
process is performed in a recurrent manner using
a LSTM which we call the HIGHLIGHT LSTM.
The initial HIGHLIGHT LSTM memory at stage
0, cHIGHLIGHT[0]t , is initialized using a networkM
that maps ht into LSTM memory space:

cHIGHLIGHT[0]t =M(ht ; ⇥) (2)
This allows the memory mechanism of the
HIGHLIGHT LSTM to dynamically adjust to the
intra-modal representations ht. The output of the
HIGHLIGHT LSTM hHIGHLIGHT[k]t is softmax ac-
tivated to produce attention weights a[k]t at every
stage k of the multistage fusion process:

a[k]t j = exp (h
HIGHLIGHT[k]
t j)

∑�hHIGHLIGHT[k]t �d=1 exp (hHIGHLIGHT[k]t d)
(3)

and a[k]t is fed as input into the HIGHLIGHT
LSTM at stage k + 1. Therefore, the HIGHLIGHT
LSTM functions as a decoder LSTM (Sutskever

et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) in order to capture the
dependencies on previous attention assignments.
Highlighting is performed by element-wise multi-
plying the attention weights a[k]t with the concate-
nated intra-modal representations ht:

h̃[k]t = ht ⊙ a[k]t (4)
where ⊙ denotes the Hadamard product and h̃[k]t
are the attended multimodal signals that will be
used for the fusion at stage k.
FUSE: The highlighted multimodal signals are

simultaneously fused in a local fusion and then in-
tegrated with fusion representations from previous
stages. Formally, this module is defined by the
process function fF :

s[k]t = fF (h̃[k]t ; s[1∶k−1]t ,⇥) (5)
where s[k]t denotes the integrated fusion represen-
tations at stage k. We employ a FUSE LSTM to
simultaneously perform the local fusion and the
integration with previous fusion representations.
The FUSE LSTM input gate enables a local fusion
while the FUSE LSTM forget and output gates en-
able integration with previous fusion results. The
initial FUSE LSTM memory at stage 0, cFUSE[0]t , is
initialized using random orthogonal matrices (Ar-
jovsky et al., 2015; Le et al., 2015).
SUMMARIZE: After completing K recur-

sive stages of HIGHLIGHT and FUSE, the
SUMMARIZE operation generates a cross-modal



154

representation using all final fusion representations
s[1∶K]t . Formally, this operation is defined as:

zt = S(s[1∶K]t ; ⇥) (6)
where zt is the final output of the multistage fusion
process and represents all cross-modal interactions
discovered at time t. The summarized cross-modal
representation is then fed into the intra-modal re-
current networks as described in the subsection 3.3.

3.3 System of Long Short-term Hybrid
Memories

To integrate the cross-modal representations zt
with the temporal intra-modal representations, we
employ a system of Long Short-term Hybrid Mem-
ories (LSTHMs) (Zadeh et al., 2018b). The
LSTHM extends the LSTM formulation to include
the cross-modal representation zt in a hybrid mem-
ory component:

imt+1 = �(Wmi xmt+1 +Umi hmt +Vmi zt + bmi ) (7)
fmt+1 = �(Wmf xmt+1 +Umf hmt +Vmf zt + bmf ) (8)
omt+1 = �(Wmo xmt+1 +Umo hmt +Vmo zt + bmo ) (9)
c̄mt+1 =Wmc̄ xmt+1 +Umc̄ hmt +Vmc̄ zt + bmc̄ (10)
cmt+1 = fmt ⊙ cmt + imt ⊙ tanh(c̄mt+1) (11)
hmt+1 = omt+1 ⊙ tanh(cmt+1) (12)

where � is the (hard-)sigmoid activation function,
tanh is the tangent hyperbolic activation function,⊙ denotes the Hadamard product. i, f and o are
the input, forget and output gates respectively. c̄mt+1
is the proposed update to the hybrid memory cmt
at time t + 1 and hmt is the time distributed output
of each modality. The cross-modal representation
zt is modeled by the Multistage Fusion Process as
discussed in subsection 3.2. The hybrid memory
cmt contains both intra-modal interactions from in-
dividual modalities xmt as well as the cross-modal
interactions captured in zt.

3.4 Optimization
The multimodal prediction task is performed using
a final representation E which integrate (1) the last
outputs from the LSTHMs and (2) the last cross-
modal representation zT . Formally, E is defined as:

E = (�
m∈M h

m
T )�zT (13)

where� denotes vector concatenation. E can then
be used as a multimodal representation for super-
vised or unsupervised analysis of multimodal lan-
guage. It summarizes all modeled intra-modal

and cross-modal representations from the multi-
modal sequences. RMFN is differentiable end-to-
end which allows the network parameters ⇥ to be
learned using gradient descent approaches.

4 Experimental Setup

To evaluate the performance and generalization of
RMFN, three domains of human multimodal lan-
guage were selected: multimodal sentiment analy-
sis, emotion recognition, and speaker traits recog-
nition.

4.1 Datasets

All datasets consist of monologue videos. The
speaker’s intentions are conveyed through three
modalities: language, visual and acoustic.
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis involves analyz-
ing speaker sentiment based on video content. Mul-
timodal sentiment analysis extends conventional
language-based sentiment analysis to a multimodal
setup where both verbal and non-verbal signals
contribute to the expression of sentiment. We use
CMU-MOSI (Zadeh et al., 2016) which consists
of 2199 opinion segments from online videos each
annotated with sentiment in the range [-3,3].
Multimodal Emotion Recognition involves iden-
tifying speaker emotions based on both verbal and
nonverbal behaviors. We perform experiments on
the IEMOCAP dataset (Busso et al., 2008) which
consists of 7318 segments of recorded dyadic dia-
logues annotated for the presence of human emo-
tions happiness, sadness, anger and neutral.
Multimodal Speaker Traits Recognition in-
volves recognizing speaker traits based on multi-
modal communicative behaviors. POM (Park et al.,
2014) contains 903 movie review videos each an-
notated for 12 speaker traits: confident (con), pas-
sionate (pas), voice pleasant (voi), credible (cre),
vivid (viv), expertise (exp), reserved (res), trusting
(tru), relaxed (rel), thorough (tho), nervous (ner),
persuasive (per) and humorous (hum).

4.2 Multimodal Features and Alignment

GloVe word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014),
Facet (iMotions, 2017) and COVAREP (Degottex
et al., 2014) are extracted for the language, visual
and acoustic modalities respectively 1. Forced
alignment is performed using P2FA (Yuan and
Liberman, 2008) to obtain the exact utterance times

dio features by computing the expectation of their
modality feature values over each word utterance
time interval (Tsai et al., 2018).

4.3 Baseline Models

We compare to the following models for mul-
timodal machine learning: MFN (Zadeh et al.,
2018a) synchronizes multimodal sequences using a
multi-view gated memory. It is the current state of
the art on CMU-MOSI and POM. MARN (Zadeh
et al., 2018b) models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions using multiple attention coefficients
and hybrid LSTM memory components. GME-
LSTM(A) (Chen et al., 2017) learns binary gating
mechanisms to remove noisy modalities that are
contradictory or redundant for prediction. TFN
(Zadeh et al., 2017) models unimodal, bimodal
and trimodal interactions using tensor products.

BC-LSTM (Poria et al., 2017) performs context-
dependent sentiment analysis and emotion recog-
nition, currently state of the art on IEMOCAP. EF-
LSTM concatenates the multimodal inputs and
uses that as input to a single LSTM (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997b). We also implement
the Stacked, (EF-SLSTM) (Graves et al., 2013)
Bidirectional (EF-BLSTM) (Schuster and Paliwal,
1997) and Stacked Bidirectional (EF-SBLSTM)
LSTMs. For descriptions of the remaining base-
lines, we refer the reader to EF-HCRF (Quattoni
et al., 2007), EF/MV-LDHCRF (Morency et al.,
2007), MV-HCRF (Song et al., 2012), EF/MV-
HSSHCRF (Song et al., 2013), MV-LSTM (Ra-
jagopalan et al., 2016), DF (Nojavanasghari et al.,
2016), SAL-CNN (Wang et al., 2016), C-MKL
(Poria et al., 2015), THMM (Morency et al., 2011),
SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Park et al., 2014)
and RF (Breiman, 2001).

4.4 Evaluation Metrics

For classification, we report accuracy Ac where c
denotes the number of classes and F1 score. For re-
gression, we report Mean Absolute Error MAE and
Pearson’s correlation r. For MAE lower values in-
dicate stronger performance. For all remaining met-
rics, higher values indicate stronger performance.

5 Results and Discussion

5.1 Performance on Multimodal Language

Results on CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and POM are
presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3 respectively2. We
achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results for
all domains, highlighting RMFN’s capability in hu-
man multimodal language analysis. We observe
that RMFN does not improve results on IEMO-
CAP neutral emotion and the model outperforming
RMFN is a memory-based fusion baseline (Zadeh
et al., 2018a). We believe that this is because neu-
tral expressions are quite idiosyncratic. Some peo-
ple may always look angry given their facial config-
uration (e.g., natural eyebrow raises of actor Jack
Nicholson). In these situations, it becomes useful
to compare the current image with a memorized
or aggregated representation of the speaker’s face.
Our proposed multistage fusion approach can eas-
ily be extended to memory-based fusion methods.

2Results for all individual baseline models are in supple-
mentary. State-of-the-art (SOTA)1/2/3 represent the three best
performing baseline models on each dataset.

5.2 Analysis of Multistage Fusion

To achieve a deeper understanding of the multi-
stage fusion process, we study five research ques-
tions. (Q1): whether modeling cross-modal inter-
actions across multiple stages is beneficial. (Q2):
the effect of the number of stages K during multi-
stage fusion on performance. (Q3): the comparison
between multistage and independent modeling of
cross-modal interactions. (Q4): whether modeling
cross-modal interactions are helpful. (Q5): whether
attention weights from the HIGHLIGHT module
are required for modeling cross-modal interactions.
Q1: To study the effectiveness of the multistage fu-
sion process, we test the baseline RMFN-R1 which
performs fusion in only one stage instead of across

multiple stages. This model makes the strong as-
sumption that all cross-modal interactions can be
modeled during only one stage. From Table 4,
RMFN-R1 underperforms as compared to RMFN
which performs multistage fusion.
Q2: We test baselines RMFN-RK which perform
K stages of fusion. From Table 4, we observe
that increasing the number of stages K increases
the model’s capability to model cross-modal in-
teractions up to a certain point (K = 3) in our
experiments. Further increases led to decreases
in performance and we hypothesize this is due to
overfitting on the dataset.
Q3: To compare multistage against independent
modeling of cross-modal interactions, we pay close
attention to the performance comparison with re-
spect to MARN which models multiple cross-
modal interactions all at once (see Table 5). RMFN
shows improved performance, indicating that mul-
tistage fusion is both effective and efficient for hu-
man multimodal language modeling.
Q4: RMFN (no MFP) represents a system of
LSTHMs without the integration of zt from the
MFP to model cross-modal interactions. From Ta-
ble 5, RMFN (no MFP) is outperformed by RMFN,
confirming that modeling cross-modal interactions
is crucial in analyzing human multimodal language.
Q5: RMFN (no HIGHLIGHT) removes the
HIGHLIGHT module from MFP during multistage
fusion. From Table 5, RMFN (no HIGHLIGHT)
underperforms, indicating that highlighting multi-
modal representations using attention weights are
important for modeling cross-modal interactions.

5.3 Visualizations
Using an attention assignment mechanism during
the HIGHLIGHT process gives more interpretabil-
ity to the model since it allows us to visualize
the attended multimodal signals at each stage and

Figure 3: Visualization of learned attention weights across stages 1,2 and 3 of the multistage fusion process
and across time of the multimodal sequence. We observe that the attention weights are diverse and evolve
across stages and time. In these three examples, the red boxes emphasize specific moments of interest. (a)
Synchronized interactions: the positive word “fun” and the acoustic behaviors of emphasis and elongation
(t = 5) are synchronized in both attention weights for language and acoustic features. (b) Asynchronous
trimodal interactions: the asynchronous presence of a smile (t = 2 ∶ 5) and emphasis (t = 3) help to
disambiguate the language modality. (c) Bimodal interactions: the interactions between the language and
acoustic modalities are highlighted by alternating stages of fusion (t = 4 ∶ 7).
time step (see Figure 3). Using RMFN trained
on the CMU-MOSI dataset, we plot the attention
weights across the multistage fusion process for
three videos in CMU-MOSI. Based on these vi-
sualizations we first draw the following general
observations on multistage fusion:
Across stages: Attention weights change their be-
haviors across the multiple stages of fusion. Some
features are highlighted by earlier stages while
other features are used in later stages. This supports
our hypothesis that RMFN learns to specialize in
different stages of the fusion process.
Across time: Attention weights vary over time and
adapt to the multimodal inputs. We observe that the
attention weights are similar if the input contains
no new information. As soon as new multimodal
information comes in, the highlighting mechanism
in RMFN adapts to these new inputs.
Priors: Based on the distribution of attention
weights, we observe that the language and acoustic
modalities seem the most commonly highlighted.
This represents a prior over the expression of senti-
ment in human multimodal language and is closely
related to the strong connections between language
and speech in human communication (Kuhl, 2000).
Inactivity: Some attention coefficients are not ac-
tive (always orange) throughout time. We hypoth-
esize that these corresponding dimensions carry

only intra-modal dynamics and are not involved in
the formation of cross-modal interactions.

5.4 Qualitative Analysis

In addition to the general observations above, Fig-
ure 3 shows three examples where multistage
fusion learns cross-modal representations across
three different scenarios.
Synchronized Interactions: In Figure 3(a), the
language features are highlighted corresponding
to the utterance of the word “fun” that is highly
indicative of sentiment (t = 5). This sudden change
is also accompanied by a synchronized highlight-
ing of the acoustic features. We also notice that the
highlighting of the acoustic features lasts longer
across the 3 stages since it may take multiple stages
to interpret all the new acoustic behaviors (elon-
gated tone of voice and phonological emphasis).
Asynchronous Trimodal Interactions: In Fig-
ure 3(b), the language modality displays ambigu-
ous sentiment: “delivers a lot of intensity” can be
inferred as both positive or negative. We observe
that the circled attention units in the visual and
acoustic features correspond to the asynchronous
presence of a smile (t = 2 ∶ 5) and phonological
emphasis (t = 3) respectively. These nonverbal be-
haviors resolve ambiguity in language and result in
an overall display of positive sentiment. We further



158

note the coupling of attention weights that highlight
the language, visual and acoustic features across
stages (t = 3 ∶ 5), further emphasizing the coordina-
tion of all three modalities during multistage fusion
despite their asynchronous occurrences.
Bimodal Interactions: In Figure 3(c), the lan-
guage modality is better interpreted in the context
of acoustic behaviors. The disappointed tone and
soft voice provide the nonverbal information useful
for sentiment inference. This example highlights
the bimodal interactions (t = 4 ∶ 7) in alternating
stages: the acoustic features are highlighted more
in earlier stages while the language features are
highlighted increasingly in later stages.

6 Conclusion

This paper proposed the Recurrent Multistage Fu-
sion Network (RMFN) which decomposes the mul-
timodal fusion problem into multiple stages, each
focused on a subset of multimodal signals. Ex-
tensive experiments across three publicly-available
datasets reveal that RMFN is highly effective in
modeling human multimodal language. In addi-
tion to achieving state-of-the-art performance on all
datasets, our comparisons and visualizations reveal
that the multiple stages coordinate to capture both
synchronous and asynchronous multimodal inter-
actions. In future work, we are interested in merg-
ing our model with memory-based fusion methods
since they have complementary strengths as dis-
cussed in subsection 5.1.
