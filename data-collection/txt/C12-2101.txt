ABSTRACT 

We present a strategy and the early results of the mapping of plWordNet – one of the largest such 
language resources in existence – onto Princeton WordNet. The fundamental structural premise 
of plWordNet differs from those of most other wordnets: lexical units rather than synsets are the 
basic building blocks. The addition of new material to plWordNet is consistently informed by 
semantic relations and by various analyses of large corpora. The mapping is difficult because of 
the subtly distinct structures and because of WordNet’s focus on synsets. We have designed a set 
of inter-lingual semantic relations and an effective mapping procedure. In the course of mapping, 
we have discovered a range of systematic differences between plWordNet and WordNet, and 
proposed ways of accounting for such differences.

1 Introduction 

We present a strategy and the preliminary results of the mapping of Polish WordNet [plWordNet] 
onto Princeton WordNet [PWN] (Fellbaum 1998). There have been many attempts to build such 
mappings for wordnets, including EuroWordNet [EWN] (Vossen 1998, Vossen 2002), 
MultiWordNet (Bentivogli, et al. 2000; Bentivogli & Pianta 2000), AsianWordNet (Robkop et al. 
2010) and IndoWordNet (Sinha, et al. 2006, Bhattacharyya 2010). Those projects usually took 
advantage of EWN’s transfer-and-merge method, which largely consisted in the translation of 
most of PWN’s structure and content into the target language. In contrast with this, plWordNet’s 
design and construction are independent of EWN or PWN, though inevitably substantially 
influenced by both. A unique corpus-based method was employed (Maziarz et al. 2012, Piasecki 
et al. 2009). Synsets in plWordNet are merely groups of similarly interconnected lexical units 
[LUs], and it is the LU that is the basic element of the network. We aim at linking two largely 
independent lexical systems. An inter-lingual mapping procedure connects plWordNet synsets 
with PWN synsets via an ordered set of inter-lingual semantic relations. Mapping is manual, but 
it is very strongly supported by automatic prompting and bookkeeping. Nouns are by far the most 
numerous class in PWN and in plWordNet, so we decided to test our procedure by the mapping 
of plWordNet nouns in specific domains: people*, artefacts*, places*, family relationships, food, 
drinks, time units, illnesses, economic vocabulary*, scientific disciplines and names connected 
with thinking and communication*. (The domains marked with * have been covered selectively.) 

2 The mapping procedure 

Our mapping procedure has three steps: recognize the sense of a source language synset S, search 
for candidate target-language synset(s) to link S with, and select the target-language synset and 
the appropriate inter-lingual relation [I-relation]. The mapping goes from plWordNet, so our 
source synsets are Polish synsets. The relations are applied in the following order: synonymy, 
hyponymy, hypernymy, meronymy, holonymy, near-synonymy, inter-register synonymy 
(Rudnicka et al. 2012). Once the highest possible relation has been established, others are no 
longer searched for and applied. 

The procedure’s first step is the proper identification of the source synset’s sense. While very few 
plWordNet synsets have glosses, the considerably more frequent comments partly make up for 
the absence of glosses. Still, plWordNet is largely relation-based, so the key (sense) denominator 
will be the position of the given set of synonymous LUs in the overall wordnet structure. 
Nevertheless, the plWordNet editor begins with reading all LUs in the synset, plus the glosses or 
comments if there are any. For example, consider the Polish synset {zagranica 1, obczyzna 1, 
obce terytorium 1} (countries abroad, foreign lands, foreign territory):  

(Example 1) {zagranica 1, obczyzna 1, obce terytorium 1} —I-holonymy→ {foreign country 1} 
 {zagranica 1} —hypo→ {strefa 2}  {foreign country 1} —hypo→ {state 4} 
 {zagranica 1} —meronymy→ {świat 2} 

The editor now considers the wordnet structure: the immediate hypernyms/hyponyms and 
meronyms and holonyms, if there are any. These are strefa and świat (zone, world). In case of 
doubts or difficulties with determining the synset sense, the editor considers the direct and 
indirect hypernyms (or other relations). Once the sense of the analysed synset has been 
established (‘area located beyond the borders of a given country’), the editor can move to the 

1040



next stage: seek the equivalent target synset in PWN. First, automatic prompts are checked if they 
are present. We re-implemented an automated mapping algorithm described in (Daudé et al. 
2003, Daudé et al. 2000). If there is no prompt, the editor’s language intuitions help select among 
target-language LUs one or two candidates which share the sense of the source-language synset 
(‘foreign country’). These candidate LUs are located in PWN and their synsets are analysed with 
respect to their sense and position in the wordnet structure (hypernym state). Special attention 
must be paid to their immediate hypernym(s) and hyponyms (or other relations if there are any), 
since these are going to be juxtaposed with the equivalent relations of the target synset. The 
editor must check if there already exist, or are likely to be posited, inter-lingual synonymy links 
between any of the immediate relations of the source and the target synset. When such links exist 
or are likely to be established for most of the immediate relations, and the gloss of the target 
synset also matches the sense of the source synset, the inter-lingual synonymy is granted between 
the two synsets in question; otherwise, the next candidate is considered. 

When the editor has exhausted the list of candidates to test, the previously chosen candidates are 
checked for their potential of linking via other relations. In Example 1, we could try linking our 
source synset with {world 4, earth 9, Earth 1, globe 1} and then {terrestial planet 1}; or with 
{solar system} via I-meronymy, because this synset can be a synonym of {świat 2}, a meronym 
of our source synset. That is not correct: the source synset {zagranica 1, obczyzna 1, obce 
terytorium 1} is in the domain of political organization, while the target synset is in the domain 
of geography, so the link must be dismissed. Next, we check the potential for linking of the 
candidate target synset {foreign country 1} —hyper→ {state 4} and decide that the source synset 
can be linked to this target synset via I-holonymy. 

Since the start of our project in March 2012 we have introduced 28061 I-relation instances, see 
Table 1. The frequency of specific relations almost ideally agrees with the proposed ranking, 
based on our intuitions, concerning meaning closeness and the identity and inclusion of denotata 
sets. Surprisingly, I-hyponymy and I-hypernymy account for half of all inter-lingual relations. 
This suggests that the structures of plWordNet and PWN differ non-trivially.

3 Mapping dilemmas and their solutions 

In the course of mapping, we have faced dilemmas resulting both from the differences in the 
conceptual and lexico-grammatical structure of English and Polish, and from different 
methodological assumptions which underlie the construction of plWordNet and PWN. 

3.1 Lexico-grammatical differences 

The existence of lexical gaps is an obvious problem: concepts either are not lexicalised in one of 
the languages or do not exist in its extra-linguistic reality and conceptual structure (cultural gaps). 
An example of the former is the English word chantry meaning “a chapel endowed for singing 
Masses for the soul of the donor” (adopted from PWN’s definition of {chantry 2}). The concept 
is not lexicalised in Polish, though it exists in its extra-linguistic reality, so {chantry 2} is linked 

1041



to its closest Polish equivalent {kaplica wotywna 1} via I-near synonymy which signals partial 
correspondence in meaning and/or structure: 

(Example 2) {chantry 2} —hypo→ {chapel 1} —hypo→ {place of worship 1} 
{kaplica wotywna 1} —hypo→ {miejsce kultu 1} {place of worship 1} —I-hypo→ {miejsce kultu 1} 
{chantry 2} ←I-near-synonymy→ {kaplica wotywna 1} 

Cultural gaps can be the names of occupations or administrative functions never present in the 
other language’s reality, thus not lexicalised. An apt example is {kaowiec 1}, a Polish term 
denoting an institution’s employee responsible for the organization of cultural and recreational 
events in the Communist times. It is linked to the PWN synset {organizer 1 ...} meaning “a 
person who brings order and organization to an enterprise” via the I-hyponymy relation, which is 
the most often used relation in such cases: 

(Example 3) {kaowiec 1} —hypo→ {pracownik oświaty 1}; {organizator 1} 
{organizator 1 } —I-hyper→ {organizer 1 ...} {kaowiec 1} —I-hypo→ {organizer 1 …} 

The last type of lexical gaps is a mismatch resulting from different structuring of information, as 
in the case of English and Polish family relation hierarchies. Polish lexicalizes the distinction 
between the brother of one’s father (stryj or stryjek) and one’s mother (wuj or wujek), although 
the former term is marked and slowly becomes obsolete. Both terms are present in plWordNet. 
The unmarked term {wujek 2} is linked to its English equivalent {uncle 1} via the I-synonymy 
relation, while the marked term {stryj 1} is linked to {uncle 1} via I-hyponymy: 

(Example 4) {stryj 1} —hypo→ {wujek 2} 
{wujek 2} —I-near-synonymy→ {uncle 1}  {stryj 1} —I-hypo→ {uncle 1} 

The contrast can be expressed in English using the premodifying adjectives paternal and 
maternal, but the phrases paternal uncle and maternal uncle are not LUs in PWN. It is important 
to distinguish all these gaps from dictionary-content gaps due to differences in sources or 
methodology of building the two wordnets. (We repair most dictionary-content gaps in 
plWordNet and catalogue such gaps in PWN for possible future use.) Clearly, our most preferred 
I-synonymy relation cannot be used in either instance. Still, most of these cases can be handled 
by the I-hyponymy/hypernymy relation which we treat as the second option. Occasionally, we 
resort to I-meronymy/holonymy and I-near-synonymy. 

Another type of dilemma is to do with the divergent degree of gender lexicalisation in English 
and Polish. Polish feminine nominal forms are frequent, while most of English nouns are not 
marked for gender, e.g., the English word cousin and Polish kuzyn ‘cousinmasc’ and kuzynka 
‘cousinfem’. The most natural strategy to adopt here is again to resort to I-hyponymy, making the 
English {cousin 1} the hypernym of both Polish {kuzyn 1} and {kuzynka 1}, which can easily be 
construed as two sub-types of a more general concept. Interestingly, there are also mixed English 
synsets consisting of feminine and masculine forms (and sometimes also unmarked forms), as in 
{bondswoman 1, bondsman 2} or {chairman 1, chairwoman 1, chairperson 1}. I-hypernymy 
links such synsets to the corresponding Polish synsets lexically differentiated for gender. 

(Example 5) {bondswoman 1, bondsman 2} —I-hyper→ {gwarant 1, poręczyciel 1}; {poręczycielka 2} 

Apart from lexically marked gender, Polish has a variety of other marked forms such as 
diminutives and augmentatives, which either do not appear or are very rare in English. 
plWordNet has a special relation of markedness (nacechowanie in Polish) to show the links 

1042



between base forms and their derivatives. Crucially, it is a relation between LUs, not synsets. It 
has three variants: istota młoda ‘young creature’, diminutywność ‘diminutiveness’ and 
augmentatywność i ekspresywność ‘augmentativeness and expressiveness’. Polish LUs which 
denote young creatures but are not derivative forms, such as cielę or cielak ‘calf’, prosię or 
prosiak ‘piglet’, are linked to {młodzik, młodziak 2} ‘young animal’ via hyponymy. 
Analogically in PWN, synsets denoting young animals are attached by hyponymy to synsets 
denoting young sub-kinds of animals, such as {young mammal 1}. Now, PWN often places LUs 
denoting young animals with diminutive forms, when such forms exist, e.g., {kitten 1, kitty 3}, or 
{piglet 1, piggy 1, shoat 1, shote 1}. Since LUs denoting young creatures and diminutive LUs are 
not always in the same synsets, they are linked to PWN synsets via I-hyponymy relation, e.g., 

(Example 6) {prosiaczek 1} —dimin→ {prosiak 1} 
{kitten 1, kitty 3}, {piglet 1, piggy 1, shoat 1, shote 1 } —hypo→ {young mammal 1} 
{piglet 1, ..} —I-hypernymy→ {prosiak 1, prosię 2}; {prosiaczek 1, prosiątko 2} 

In the rare cases without direct equivalents, I-synonymy will be applied. If an item has no English 
equivalents, we opt for I-hyponymy to link it to its English hypernyms. 

3.2 Structural differences 

3.2.1 Synonymy and synsets 

The different strategy of synset construction and the resulting different idea of intra-lingual 
synonymy have led to systematic structural discrepancies. To begin with, plWordNet 
systematically distinguishes between count and mass nouns and never places them in the same 
synset. Conversely, PWN often neutralises this distinction at the synset level, putting both mass 
and count LUs into one synset (e.g. {furniture 1, piece of furniture 1, article of furniture 1}) 
(Miller 1998: 36). Such cases may cause problems for mapping, because it is hard to determine 
which plWordNet synset should be linked via I-synonymy, if any. I-hyponymy could be also 
applied to link the count nouns and mass noun plWordNet synsets to such “mixed” PWN synset: 

(Example 7) {mebel 1} —I-hypo→ {furniture 1, piece of furniture 1, article of furniture 1} 
{mebel 1} —hypo→ {element wyposażenia 1}, {sprzęt 2} {mebel 1} —meronymy→ {umeblowanie 1} 
{umeblowanie 1} —I-hypo→ {furniture 1, piece of furniture 1, article of furniture 1} 

There also are PWN synsets with singular and plural forms of the same lemma, e.g., {dumpling, 
dumplings 1} with singular and plural hyponyms such as {matzo ball 1}, {wonton 1}, {gnocchi 
1}. These are also linked via I-hyponymy to their corresponding plWordNet synsets: 

(Example 8) {pierog 1, pieróg 2} —I-hypo→ {dumpling 1, dumplings 1} 
   {pierogi 1} —I-hypo→ {dumpling 1, dumplings 1} 
   {matzo ball 1}, {wonton 1}, {gnocchi 1} —hypo→ {dumpling 1, dumplings 1} 

The differently defined synonymy affects the definition of hyponymy in plWordNet and PWN. In 
PWN, singular and collective nouns (pluralia tantum) may be hyponyms/hypernyms of each 
other. This is impossible in plWordNet: {dumpling 1, dumplings 1} ‘small balls or strips of 
boiled or steamed dough’ is a hypernym of synsets {gnocchi} ‘(Italian) a small dumpling made 
of potato or flour or semolina that is boiled or baked and is usually served with a sauce or with 
grated cheese’, {matzo ball, matzoh ball, matzah ball} ‘a Jewish dumpling made of matzo meal; 
usually served in soup’ and {won ton, wonton} ‘a Chinese dumpling filled with spiced minced 

1043



pork; usually served in soup’. A somewhat drastic, though maybe not unmotivated, case of using 
a broad notion of synonymy in PWN is the synset {monte 1, four-card monte 1, three-card monte 
1} ‘a gambling card game of Spanish origin; 3 or 4 cards are dealt face up and players bet that 
one of them will be matched before the others as the cards are dealt from the pack one at a time’. 
It is obvious that a four-card monte is not a synonym of a three-card monte, they are just both 
hyponyms of monte. In Poland monte is not so popular. There only is a three-card monte – trzy 
karty (literally ‘three cards’). The synsets were joined by inter-language hyponymy, since the 
English equivalent three-card monte of the Polish LU is in the PWN synset: 

(Example 9) {trzy karty 1} —I-hypo→ {monte 1, four-card monte 1, three-card monte 1} 

To sum up, we consistently use I-hyponymy in all cases of mixed PWN synsets. 

3.2.2 Differently defined relations 

There is a lot of correspondence between the set of linguistic relations employed by PWN and 
plWordNet and their respective construction, but there are differences. They are reflected in the 
structure of both wordnets and may have consequences for the mapping. To give an example, 
PWN uses the conjunction or in its definitions, thus allowing for the hypernymy and/or, while 
plWordNet restricts its hypernymy to and. For example, the PWN synset {musical 1, …} was 
given the gloss ‘a play or film whose action and dialogue is interspersed with singing and 
dancing’; it received the following relational description in PWN (two instances of hyponymy): 

(Example 10)  {musical, musical comedy, musical theater} —hypo→ {movie, film, picture, …}, 
{musical, musical comedy, musical theater} —hypo→ {play 2}. 

The word musical gained a similar definition in (Dubisz 2004): “a theatre or film spectacle with 
comedic or melodramatic content, consisting of oral, sung or danced parts”. We had to split the 
concept into theatrical musical and musical film in order to avoid or-hyponymy: 

(Example 11)  {musical 1, komedia muzyczna} —hypo→ {film 1, obraz 6} ‘movie, picture’, 
{musical 2} —hypo→ {przedstawienie 7} ‘play' 

Or-hyponymy was banned from plWordNet in order to preserve the transitivity of hyponymy. For 
example, the English synset {musical 1, ...} also contains synonyms musical comedy and musical 
theatre. The first is a synonym of musical (Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online). The second 
clearly refers to theatrical musical (Oxford English Dictionary). In fact, the latter LU should be a 
hyponym, not a synonym, of musical in the broader sense. This leads to a paradox: two 
synonyms of the synset have both hyponymy relations (to a play and to a film), while music(al) 
theatre has only one (to a play). The opposite could be noted in plWordNet where the LU 
komedia muzyczna could be found in the meaning film musical. It is linked to {film 1, obraz 6} 
‘movie, picture’ with hyponymy and is, of course, a synonym of Polish musical 1. It seems that 
in PWN hyponymy is only partly transitive and in some cases synonymy captures cases of 
hyponymy. Musicals from PWN and plWordNet had to be, naturally, linked with I-hyponymy: 

(Example 12) Pol. {musical 1, komedia muzyczna} —I-hypo→ Eng. {musical 1, …} 
Pol. {musical 2} —I-hypo→ Eng. {musical 1, …} 

Relations are not the only source of difficulty. Glosses also pose dilemmas during mapping. 
A case of thriller ‘a suspenseful adventure story or play or movie’ is somehow similar to musical. 
Here the connective or appears twice, surprisingly followed by only one hyponymy: 

1044



(Example 13) {thriller 1} —hypo→ {adventure story 1, heroic tale 1} 

(Dubisz 2004) gives a very similar definition: “a movie, novel or play whose sensational and 
supenseful action is imbued with elements of mystery, horror and eeriness; a thriller”. In 
plWordNet we distinguish three senses according to the medium: (a) ‘movie’, (b) ‘novel’, (c) 
‘play’. Unfortunately the English gloss does not fit the English relation instance for thriller, so 
we are not sure whether Polish {thriller 1} should be linked to English {thriller} with I-
synonymy (according to the English relation instance) or whether all three Polish thrillers ought 
to be connected with the English synset with I-hyponymy (according to the English gloss). We 
chose the former solution, assuming that for a wordnet relations are more important than glosses: 

(Example 14) Pol. {thriller 1} `novel’ —I-syn→ Eng. {thriller 1}, 
Pol. {thriller 2, dreszczowiec 1} ‘movie’ —I-hypo→ Eng. {movie, film, picture, …}, 
Pol. {thriller 3} ‘play’ —I-hypo→ Eng. {play 2} 

3.2.3 Different relations to code the same conceptual dependencies 

Sometimes equivalent synsets are differently interlinked within the two wordnets, e.g., {jewelry, 
jewellery} is linked via hyponymy to synsets {bracelet, bangle} ‘jewelry worn around the wrist 
for decoration’, {ring, band} ‘consisting of a circlet of precious metal (often set with jewels) 
worn on the finger’, {earring} ‘jewelry to ornament the ear; usually clipped to the earlobe or 
fastened through a hole in the lobe’ and many others. The Polish counterpart of jewellery – 
biżuteria – is linked to the equivalents of ring (pierścionek, pierścień), bracelet (bransoletka) and 
earring (kolczyki, klipsy) and so on. Linking is with a different relation type, holonymy (the part 
subtype). So, the equivalent synsets appear in different structures: 

(Example 15) {jewellery} —hyper→ {bracelet} vs. {biżuteria} —holonymy→ {bransoletka}. 

We have discussed in Section 3.1 plWordNet’s markedness relation, which has no exact 
counterpart in PWN (is-a-derivative-of, is too broad for our purposes). There are a few more 
nominal relations specific to plWordNet. The inhabitant relation is quite instructive. In PWN, the 
synset {American 1} ‘native or inhabitant of the United States’ is linked to the synset {United 
States, United States of America, America, the States, US, U.S., USA, U.S.A.} via the member 
meronymy relation. In plWordNet, {Amerykanin 2} and {USA, Ameryka, Stany Zjednoczone, 
Stany} are connected via the inhabitant relation, because Amerykanie (Americansplural) inhabit 
Ameryka and this is expressed by the systematic derivational relation (Maziarz et al. 2011). 
Despite this difference, the synsets will be linked via I-synonymy: 

(Example 16) {United States, ...} ←I-synonymy→ {USA, Ameryka, Stany Zjednoczone, Stany} 
      ↑meronymy (member) ↑    ↑inhabitant↑ 
        {American 1}   ←I-synonymy→  {Amerykanin 2} 

The two wordnets differ not only in the repertory of lexico-semantic relations but also in sense 
distinctions. We have already discussed the case of English thriller, strongly interrelated with 
three ‘thrillers’ in plWordNet, and musical which in plWordNet gained two equivalent musicals 
(its I-hyponyms). The case of chapel and kaplica is similar. In PWN chapel was given a 
definition ‘a place of worship that has its own altar’. Because in plWordNet senses are 
distinguished by relations in which a particular word-sense pair is involved, Polish kaplica had 
two meanings: ‘autonomous building with its own altar’ and ‘part of another building (church or 
cloister) with its own altar’. Relation instances of the two synsets are illustrated below: 

1045



(Example 17) {kaplica 1} ‘chapel, autonomous building’ —hypo→ {świątynia} ‘temple’ 
{kaplica 1} —hyper→ {kaplica przycmentarna, …} ‘cemetery chapel’ 
{kaplica 2} ‘chapel, part of another building’ —hypo→ {pomieszczenie 3} ‘room’ 
{kaplica 2} —mero:place→ {klasztor 1} ‘monastery’ {kaplica 2} —mero:place→ {kościół 2} ‘church’ 

The two senses do have different lexical neighbourhoods, so we assume that they should stay 
separate. PWN shows an alternative way of describing the concept ‘chapel’. Instead of splitting 
the sense, it was kept intact and linked to a higher hypernym {place of worship, …}. At a first 
glance the two approaches appear justified. Unfortunately, the hypernym {place of worship, 
house of prayer, house of God, house of worship} was itself linked to {building, edifice} and was 
given too narrow a definition ‘any building where congregations gather for prayer’, although 
{chapel} has two hyponyms which clearly are not buildings: {lady church} ‘a small chapel in a 
church; dedicated to the Virgin Mary’ and {side chapel} ‘a small chapel off the side aisle of a 
church’. Despite this inconsistency we decided to link our {kaplica 1} and {kaplica 2} with I-
hyponymy with {chapel 1}, assuming that it has both meanings: 

(Example 18) {kaplica 1} ‘building’ —I-hypo→ {chapel 1} ‘a place of worship’, 
{kaplica 2} ‘room’ —I-hypo→ {chapel 1} ‘a place of worship’. 

3.2.4 Dictionary-content mismatches 

Mapping is also made more difficult by dictionary content gaps. We have decided that, though 
we could improve plWordNet, we were not supposed to make any changes inside PWN. What is 
a dictionary gap? Lexical gaps are caused by specificities of the two languages, dictionary gaps 
are produced by limitations of any dictionary/thesaurus/wordnet size. For example, in PWN 
names of artists are restricted to only one domain of art even in cases when they apply quite 
systematically to more than one domain. For example, {impressionist 1} ‘a painter who follows 
the theories of Impressionism’ has one hypernym relation instance to {painter 1}, although there 
is a clear evidence that the word could be used also to indicate impressionist musicians (see the 
entry in (Procter 1978)) or poets (see impressionism in (Myers, Wukasch 2003)). Polish 
impresjonista ‘impressionist painter, musician or poet’ is defined using two and-hypernyms 
artysta ‘artist’ and przedstawiciel ‘exponent (of an artistic trend)’. We cope with the lexical 
database mismatch between PWN and plWordNet simply using I-hyponymy between more 
specific English {impressionist 1} and broader Polish {impresjonista 1}. 

Conclusion and perspectives 

The system of inter-lingual relations and the mapping procedure proposed in this paper have been 
shown to work successfully. We have managed to map about 28000 plWordNet synsets onto 
PWN synsets. All edited plWordNet synsets have been linked to PWN’s synsets by one of the 
proposed inter-lingual relations. The manual mapping was enhanced by an automatic prompt 
system, which turned out to be useful. The created mapping is especially valuable in that we have 
been linking two completely independently created large-scale wordnets. It enabled a systematic 
comparison of plWordNet’s and PWN’s structure and content, but also plWordNet’s verification 
and correction. We have encountered mapping dilemmas which boil down to lexico-grammatical 
differences between English and Polish and to structural incompatibilities resulting from different 
methodologies which underlie the construction of the two wordnets; we have proposed 
systematic solutions.
