Abstract

Though the community has made great
progress on Machine Reading Comprehension
(MRC) task, most of the previous works are
solving English-based MRC problems, and
there are few efforts on other languages mainly
due to the lack of large-scale training data. In
this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine
Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task for
the languages other than English. Firstly, we
present several back-translation approaches
for CLMRC task, which is straightforward to
adopt. However, to accurately align the answer
into another language is difficult and could
introduce additional noise. In this context,
we propose a novel model called Dual BERT,
which takes advantage of the large-scale train-
ing data provided by rich-resource language
(such as English) and learn the semantic re-
lations between the passage and question in a
bilingual context, and then utilize the learned
knowledge to improve reading comprehension
performance of low-resource language. We
conduct experiments on two Chinese machine
reading comprehension datasets CMRC 2018
and DRCD. The results show consistent and
significant improvements over various state-
of-the-art systems by a large margin, which
demonstrate the potentials in CLMRC task. 1

1 Introduction

Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has
been a popular task to test the reading ability of the
machine, which requires to read text material and
answer the questions based on it. Starting from
cloze-style reading comprehension, various neural
network approaches have been proposed and mas-
sive progresses have been made in creating large-
scale datasets and neural models (Hermann et al.,
2015; Hill et al., 2015; Kadlec et al., 2016; Cui

ymcui/Cross-Lingual-MRC.

et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Dhingra et al.,
2017). Though various types of contributions had
been made, most works are dealing with English
reading comprehension. Reading comprehension
in other than English has not been well-addressed
mainly due to the lack of large-scale training data.

To enrich the training data, there are two tradi-
tional approaches. Firstly, we can annotate data
by human experts, which is ideal and high-quality,
while it is time-consuming and rather expensive.
One can also obtain large-scale automatically gen-
erated data (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015;
Liu et al., 2017), but the quality is far beyond
the usable threshold. Another way is to exploit
cross-lingual approaches to utilize the data in rich-
resource language to implicitly learn the relations
between <passage, question, answer>.

In this paper, we propose the Cross-Lingual
Machine Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task
that aims to help reading comprehension in low-
resource languages. First, we present several
back-translation approaches when there is no or
partially available resources in the target language.
Then we propose a novel model called Dual BERT
to further improve the system performance when
there is training data available in the target lan-
guage. We first translate target language train-
ing data into English to form pseudo bilingual
parallel data. Then we use multilingual BERT
(Devlin et al., 2019) to simultaneously model the
<passage, question, answer> in both languages,
and fuse the representations of both to generate fi-
nal predictions. Experimental results on two Chi-
nese reading comprehension dataset CMRC 2018
(Cui et al., 2019) and DRCD (Shao et al., 2018)
show that by utilizing English resources could
substantially improve system performance and the
proposed Dual BERT achieves state-of-the-art per-
formances on both datasets, and even surpass hu-
man performance on some metrics. Also, we

conduct experiments on the Japanese and French
SQuAD (Asai et al., 2018) and achieves substan-
tial improvements. Moreover, detailed ablations
and analysis are carried out to demonstrate the
effectiveness of exploiting knowledge from rich-
resource language. To best of our knowledge, this
is the first time that the cross-lingual approaches
applied and evaluated on realistic reading compre-
hension data. The main contributions of our paper
can be concluded as follows.

• We present several back-translation based read-
ing comprehension approaches and yield state-
of-the-art performances on several reading
comprehension datasets, including Chinese,
Japanese, and French.

• We propose a model called Dual BERT to si-
multaneously model the <passage, question>
in both source and target language to enrich the
text representations.

• Experimental results on two public Chinese
reading comprehension datasets show that the
proposed cross-lingual approaches yield signif-
icant improvements over various baseline sys-
tems and set new state-of-the-art performances.

2 Related Works

Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has
been a trending research topic in recent years.
Among various types of MRC tasks, span-
extraction reading comprehension has been enor-
mously popular (such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016)), and we have seen a great progress on re-
lated neural network approaches (Wang and Jiang,
2016; Seo et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2016; Cui
et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019), especially those
were built on pre-trained language models, such
as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). While massive
achievements have been made by the community,
reading comprehension in other than English has
not been well-studied mainly due to the lack of
large-scale training data.

Asai et al. (2018) proposed to use runtime ma-
chine translation for multilingual extractive read-
ing comprehension. They first translate the data
from the target language to English and then ob-
tain an answer using an English reading com-
prehension model. Finally, they recover the cor-
responding answer in the original language us-
ing soft-alignment attention scores from the NMT

model. However, though an interesting attempt
has been made, the zero-shot results are quite low,
and alignments between different languages, es-
pecially for those have different word orders, are
significantly different. Also, they only evaluate
on a rather small dataset (hundreds of samples)
that was translated from SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016), which is not that realistic.

To solve the issues above and better exploit
large-scale rich-resourced reading comprehension
data, in this paper, we propose several zero-
shot approaches which yield state-of-the-art per-
formances on Japanese and French SQuAD data.
Moreover, we also propose a supervised approach
for the condition that there are training samples
available for the target language. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach, we carried out ex-
periments on two realistic public Chinese read-
ing comprehension data: CMRC 2018 (simplified
Chinese) (Cui et al., 2019) and DRCD (traditional
Chinese) (Shao et al., 2018). Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness by modeling train-
ing samples in a bilingual environment.

3 Back-Translation Approaches

In this section, we illustrate back-translation ap-
proaches for cross-lingual machine reading com-
prehension, which is natural and easy to imple-
ment. Before introducing these approaches in de-
tail, we will clarify crucial terminologies in this
paper for better understanding.

• Source Language: Rich-resourced and has suf-
ficient large-scale training data that we aim to
extract knowledge from. We use subscript S for
variables in the source language.

• Target Language: Low-resourced and has only
a few training data that we wish to optimize on.
We use subscript T for variables in the target
language.

In this paper, we aim to improve the machine
reading comprehension performance in Chinese
(target language) by introducing English (source
language) resources. The general idea of back-
translation approaches is to translate <passage,
question> pair into the source language and gen-
erate an answer using a reading comprehension
system in the source language. Finally, the
generated answer is back-translated into the tar-
get language. In the following subsections, we
will introduce several back-translation approaches

for cross-lingual machine reading comprehension
task. The architectures of the proposed back-
translation approaches are depicted in Figure 1.

3.1 GNMT

To build a simple cross-lingual machine reading
comprehension system, it is straightforward to uti-
lize translation system to bridge source and target
language (Asai et al., 2018). Briefly, we first trans-
late the target sample to the source language. Then
we use a source reading comprehension system,
such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), to generate
an answer in the source language. Finally, we use
back-translation to get the answer in the target lan-
guage. As we do not exploit any training data in
the target language, we could regard this approach
as a zero-shot cross-lingual baseline system.

Specifically, we use Google Neural Machine
Translation (GNMT) system for source-to-target
and target-to-source translations. One may also
use advanced and domain-specific neural machine
translation system to achieve better translation
performance, while we leave it for individuals, and
this is beyond the scope of this paper.

However, for span-extraction reading compre-
hension task, a major drawback of this approach
is that the translated answer may not be the exact
span in the target passage. To remedy this, we pro-
pose three simple approaches to improve the qual-
ity of the translated answer in the target language.

3.2 Simple Match

We propose a simple approach to align the trans-
lated answer into extract span in the target pas-
sage. We calculate character-level text overlap
(for Chinese) between translated answer Atrans
and arbitrary sliding window in target passage
PT [i:j]. The length of sliding window ranges
len(Atrans) ± δ, with a relax parameter δ. Typ-
ically, the relax parameter δ ∈ [0, 5] as the length
between ground truth and translated answer does
not differ much in length. In this way, we would
calculate character-level F1-score of each candi-
date spanPT [i:j] and translated answerAtrans, and
we could choose the best matching one accord-
ingly. Using the proposed SimpleMatch could en-
sure the predicted answer is an exact span in tar-
get passage. As SimpleMatch does not use tar-
get training data either, it could also be a pipeline
component in zero-shot settings.

3.3 Answer Aligner

Though we could use unsupervised approaches
for aligning answer, such as the proposed Sim-
pleMatch, it stops at token-level and lacks seman-
tic awareness between the translated answer and
ground truth answer. In this paper, we also pro-
pose two supervised approaches for further im-
proving the answer span when there is training
data available in the target language.

The first one is Answer Aligner, where we feed



1589

translated answer Atrans and target passage PT
into the BERT and outputs the ground truth an-
swer span AT . The model will learn the seman-
tic relations between them and generate improved
span for the target language.

3.4 Answer Verifier

In Answer Aligner, we did not exploit question
information in target training data. One can also
utilize question information to transform Answer
Aligner into Answer Verifier, as we use complete
〈PT ,QT ,AT 〉 in the target language and addi-
tional translated answer Atrans to verify its cor-
rectness and generate improved span.

4 Dual BERT

One disadvantage of the back-translation ap-
proaches is that we have to recover the source an-
swer into the target language. To remedy the is-
sue, in this paper, we propose a novel model called
Dual BERT to simultaneously model the training
data in both source and target language to better
exploit the relations among <passage, question,
answer>. The model could be used when there
is training data available for the target language,
and we could better utilize source language data to
enhance the target reading comprehension system.
The overall neural architecture for Dual BERT is
shown in Figure 2.

4.1 Dual Encoder

Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Trans-
formers (BERT) has shown marvelous perfor-
mance in various NLP tasks, which substantially
outperforms non-pretrained models by a large
margin (Devlin et al., 2019). In this paper, we use
multi-lingual BERT for better encoding the text in
both source and target language. Formally, given
target passage PT and question QT , we organize
the input XT for BERT as follows.

[CLS] QT [SEP] PT [SEP]

Similarly, we can also obtain source training sam-
ple by translating target sample with GNMT,
forming input XS for BERT. Then we use XT
and XS to obtain deep contextualized representa-
tions through a shared multi-lingual BERT, form-
ing BT ∈ RLT ∗h, BS ∈ RLS∗h, where L repre-
sents the length of input and h is the hidden size
(768 for multi-lingual BERT).

4.2 Bilingual Decoder
Typically, in the reading comprehension task, at-
tention mechanism is used to measure the relations
between the passage and question. Moreover,
as Transformers are fundamental components of
BERT, multi-head self-attention layer (Vaswani
et al., 2017) is used to extract useful information
within the input sequence.

Specifically, in our model, to enhance the target
representation, we use a multi-head self-attention
layer to extract useful information in source BERT
representation BS . We aim to generate target
span by not only relying on target representation
but also on source representation to simultane-
ously consider the <passage, question> relations
in both languages, which can be seen as a bilingual
decoding process.

Briefly, we regard target BERT representation
BT as query and source BERT representation BS
as key and value in multi-head attention mecha-
nism. In original multi-head attention, we calcu-
late a raw dot attention as follows. 2 This will
result in an attention matrix ATS that indicate raw
relations between each source and target token.

ATS = BT ·B>S , ATS ∈ RLT ∗LS (1)

To combine the benefit of both inter-attention
and self-attention, instead of using Equation 1,
we propose a simple modification on multi-
head attention mechanism, which is called Self-
Adaptive Attention (SAA). First, we calculate
self-attention ofBT andBS and apply the softmax
function, as shown in Equation 2 and 3. This is de-
signed to use self-attention to filter the irrelevant
part within each representation firstly, and inform
the raw dot attention on paying more attention to
the self-attended part, making the attention more
precise and accurate.

AT = softmax(BT ·B>T ) (2)
AS = softmax(BS ·B>S ) (3)

Then we use self-attention AT and AS , inter-
attention ATS to get self-attentive attention ÃTS .
We calculate dot product between AST and BS to
obtain attended representation R′ ∈ RLT ∗h.

ÃTS = AT ·ATS ·AS>, ÃTS ∈ RLT ∗LS (4)
R′ = softmax(ÃTS) ·BS (5)

2We omit rather extensive formulations of representation
transformations and kindly advise the readers refer to the at-
tention implementation in BERT: https://github.com/google-
research/bert/blob/master/modeling.py#L558

4.3 Auxiliary Output
In order to evaluate how translated sample behaves
in the source language system, we also generate
span prediction for source language using BERT
representation BS directly without further calcu-
lation, resulting in the start and target prediction
P sS , P

e
S (similar to Equation 8). Moreover, we

also calculate cross-entropy loss Laux for trans-
lated sample (similar to Equation 9), where a λ
parameter is applied to this loss.

Instead of setting λ with heuristic value, in this
paper, we propose a novel approach to better ad-
just λ automatically. As the sample was generated
by the machine translation system, there would

be information loss during the translation process.
Wrong or partially translated samples may harm
the performance of reading comprehension sys-
tem. To measure how the translated samples as-
semble the real target samples, we calculate co-
sine similarity between the ground truth span rep-
resentation in source and target language (denoted
as H̃S and H̃T ). When the ground truth span rep-
resentation in the translated sample is similar to
the real target samples, the λ increase; otherwise,
we only use target span loss as λ may decrease to
zero.

The span representation is the concatenation of
three parts: BERT representation of ground truth
start Bs ∈ Rh, ground truth end Be ∈ Rh, and
self-attended span Batt ∈ Rh, which considers
both boundary information (start/end) and mixed
representation of the whole ground truth span. We
use BERT representation B3 to get a self-attended
span representation Batt using a simple dot prod-
uct with average pooling, to get a 2D-tensor.

The overall loss for Dual BERT is composed by
two parts: target span loss LT and auxiliary span
loss in source language Laux.

L = LT + λLaux (13)

3We mask out the values that out of span.

5.1 Experimental Setups
We evaluate our approaches on two public Chi-
nese span-extraction machine reading comprehen-
sion datasets: CMRC 2018 (simplified Chinese)
(Cui et al., 2019)4 and DRCD (traditional Chi-
nese) (Shao et al., 2018)5. The statistics of the two
datasets are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Statistics of CMRC 2018 and DRCD.

Note that, since the test and challenge sets are
preserved by CMRC 2018 official to ensure the in-
tegrity of the evaluation process, we submitted our
best-performing systems to the organizers to get
these scores. The resource in source language was
chosen as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) training
data. The settings of the proposed approaches are
listed below in detail.

• Tokenization: Following the official BERT im-
plementation, we use WordPiece tokenizer (Wu
et al., 2016) for English and character-level tok-
enizer for Chinese.

• BERT: We use pre-trained English BERT on
SQuAD 1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) for ini-
tialization, denoted as SQ-Ben (base) and SQ-
Len (large) for back-translation approaches. For
other conditions, we use multi-lingual BERT
as default, denoted as Bmul (and SQ-Bmul for
those were pre-trained on SQuAD).6

• Translation: We use Google Neural Ma-
chine Translation (GNMT) system for transla-
tion.7 We evaluated GNMT system on NIST
MT02/03/04/05/06/08 Chinese-English set and
achieved an average BLEU score of 43.24, com-
pared to previous best work (43.20) (Cheng
et al., 2018), yielding state-of-the-art perfor-
mance.

7https://cloud.google.com/translate/

• Optimization: Following original BERT im-
plementation, we use ADAM with weight decay
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) using an ini-
tial learning rate of 4e-5 and use cosine learning
rate decay scheme instead of the original linear
decay, which we found it beneficial for stabiliz-
ing results. The training batch size is set to 64,
and each model is trained for 2 epochs, which
roughly takes 1 hour.

• Implementation: We modified the TensorFlow
(Abadi et al., 2016) version run squad.py
provided by BERT. All models are trained on
Cloud TPU v2 that has 64GB HBM.

5.2 Overall Results

The overall results are shown in Table 2. As
we can see that, without using any alignment
approach, the zero-shot results are quite lower
regardless of using English BERT-base (#1)
or BERT-large (#2). When we apply Sim-
pleMatch (#3), we observe significant improve-
ments demonstrating its effectiveness. The An-
swer Aligner (#4) could further improve the per-
formance beyond SimpleMatch approach, demon-
strating that the machine learning approach could
dynamically adjust the span output by learning the
semantic relationship between translated answer
and target passage. Also, the Answer Verifier (#5)
could further boost performance and surpass the
multi-lingual BERT baseline (#7) that only use tar-
get training data, demonstrating that it is beneficial
to adopt rich-resourced language to improve ma-
chine reading comprehension in other languages.

When we do not use SQuAD pre-trained
weights, the proposed Dual BERT (#8) yields sig-
nificant improvements (all results are verified by
p-test with p < 0.05) over both Chinese BERT
(#6) and multi-lingual BERT (#7) by a large mar-
gin. If we only train the BERT with SQuAD
(#9), which is a zero-shot system, we can see
that it achieves decent performance on two Chi-
nese reading comprehension data. Moreover, we
can also pursue further improvements by con-
tinue training (#10) with Chinese data starting
from the system #9, or mixing Chinese data with
SQuAD and training from initial multi-lingual
BERT (#11). Under powerful SQuAD pre-trained
baselines, Dual BERT (#12) still gives moder-
ate and consistent improvements over Cascade
Training (#10) and Mixed Training (#11) baselines

5.3 Results on Japanese and French SQuAD

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective
approach called SimpleMatch to align translated
answer to original passage span. While one may
argue that using neural machine translation atten-
tion to project source answer to original target pas-
sage span is ideal as used in Asai et al. (2018).
However, to extract attention value in neural ma-
chine translation system and apply it to extract the
original passage span is bothersome and compu-
tationally ineffective. To demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of using SimpleMatch instead of using
NMT attention to extract original passage span
in zero-shot condition, we applied SimpleMatch
to Japanese and French SQuAD (304 samples for
each) which is what exactly used in Asai et al.
(2018). The results are listed in Table 3.

From the results, we can see that, though our
baseline (GNMT+BERTLen) is higher than previ-
ous work (Back-Translation (Asai et al., 2018)),
when using SimpleMatch to extract original pas-
sage span could obtain competitive of even larger

improvements. In Japanese SQuAD, the F1 score
improved by 9.6 in Asai et al. (2018) using
NMT attention, while we obtain larger improve-
ment with 11.8 points demonstrating the effective-
ness of the proposed method. BERT with pre-
trained SQuAD weights yields the best perfor-
mance among these systems, as it does not require
the machine translation process and has unified
text representations for different languages.

5.4 Ablation Studies

In this section, we ablate important components in
our model to explicitly demonstrate its effective-
ness. The ablation results are depicted in Table 4.

As we can see that, removing SQuAD pre-

trained weights (i.e., using randomly initialized
BERT) hurts the performance most, suggesting
that it is beneficial to use pre-trained weights
though the source and the target language is dif-
ferent. Removing source BERT will degenerate to
cascade training, and the results show that it also
harms overall performance, demonstrating that it
is beneficial to utilize translated sample for bet-
ter characterizing the relations between <passage,
question, answer>. The other modifications seem
to also consistently decrease the performance to
some extent, but not as salient as the data-related
components (last two lines), indicating that data-
related approaches are important in cross-lingual
machine reading comprehension task.

6 Discussion

In our preliminary cross-lingual experiments, we
adopt English as our source language data. How-
ever, one question remains unclear.

Is it better to pre-train with larger data in a
distant language (such as English, as oppose to
Simplified Chinese), or with smaller data in closer
language (such as Traditional Chinese)?

To investigate the problem, we plot the multi-
lingual BERT performance on the CMRC 2018
development data using different language and
data size in the pre-training stage. The results are
depicted in Figure 3, and we come to several ob-
servations.

Firstly, when the size of pre-training data is
under 25k (training data size of DRCD), we can
see that there is no much difference whether we
use Chinese or English data for pre-training, and
even the English pre-trained models are better than
Chinese pre-trained models in most of the times,
which is not expected. We suspect that, by us-
ing multi-lingual BERT, the model tend to provide
universal representations for the text and learn the
language-independent semantic relations among
the inputs which is ideal for cross-lingual tasks,

thus the model is not that sensitive to the lan-
guage in the pre-training stage. Also, as train-
ing data size of SQuAD is larger than DRCD, we
could use more data for pre-training. When we
add more SQuAD data (>25k) in the pre-training
stage, the performance on the downstream task
(CMRC 2018) continues to improve significantly.
In this context, we conclude that,

• When the pre-training data is not abundant,
there is no special preference on the selection
of source (pre-training) language.

• If there are large-scale training data available
for several languages, we should select the
source language as the one that has the largest
training data rather than its linguistic similar-
ity to the target language.

Furthermore, one could also take advantages of
data in various languages, but not only in a bilin-
gual environment, to further exploit knowledge
from various sources, which is beyond the scope
of this paper and we leave this for future work.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine
Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task. When
there is no training data available for the tar-
get language, firstly, we provide several zero-
shot approaches that were initially trained on En-
glish and transfer to other languages, along with
three methods to improve the translated answer
span by using unsupervised and supervised ap-
proaches. When there is training data available
for the target language, we propose a novel model



1594

called Dual BERT to simultaneously model the
<passage, question, answer> in source and tar-
get languages using multi-lingual BERT. The pro-
posed method takes advantage of the large-scale
training data by rich-resource language (such as
SQuAD) and learns the semantic relations be-
tween the passage and question in both source
and target language. Experiments on two Chi-
nese machine reading comprehension datasets in-
dicate that the proposed model could give con-
sistent and significant improvements over various
state-of-the-art systems by a large margin and set
baselines for future research on CLMRC task.

Future studies on cross-lingual machine reading
comprehension will focus on 1) how to utilize var-
ious types of English reading comprehension data;
2) cross-lingual machine reading comprehension
without the translation process, etc.
