Abstract

There has recently been a lot of work try-
ing to use images of referents of words for
improving vector space meaning represen-
tations derived from text. We investigate
the opposite direction, as it were, trying to
improve visual word predictors that iden-
tify objects in images, by exploiting dis-
tributional similarity information during
training. We show that for certain words
(such as entry-level nouns or hypernyms),
we can indeed learn better referential word
meanings by taking into account their se-
mantic similarity to other words. For other
words, there is no or even a detrimental
effect, compared to a learning setup that
presents even semantically related objects
as negative instances.

1 Introduction

Someone who knows the meaning of the word
child will most probably know a) how to distin-
guish children from other entities in the real world
and b) that child is related to other words, such as
girl, boy, mother, etc. Traditionally, these two as-
pects of lexical meaning—which, following (Mar-
coni, 1997), we may call referential and inferen-
tial, respectively—have been modeled in quite dis-
tinct settings. Semantic similarity has been a pri-
mary concern for distributional models of word
meaning that treat words as vectors which are ag-
gregated over their contexts, cf. (Turney and Pan-
tel, 2010; Erk, 2016). Identifying visual referents
of words, on the other hand, is a core require-
ment for verbal human/robot interfaces (HRI) (Roy
et al., 2002; Tellex et al., 2011; Matuszek et al.,
2012; Krishnamurthy and Kollar, 2013; Kenning-
ton and Schlangen, 2015). Here, word meanings
have been modeled as predictors that can be ap-

plied to the visual representation of an object and
predict referential appropriateness for that object.

This paper extends upon recent work on learn-
ing models of referential word use on large-scale
corpora of images paired with referring expres-
sions (Schlangen et al., 2016). As in previous
approaches in HRI, that work treats words during
training and application as independent predictors,
with no relations between them. Our starting as-
sumption here is that this misses potentially use-
ful information: e.g., that the costs for confusing
referents of child vs. boy should be much lower
than for confusing referents of child vs. car. We
thus investigate whether knowledge about seman-
tic similarities between words can be exploited to
learn more accurate visual word predictors, ac-
counting for this intuition that certain visual ob-
ject distinctions are semantically more important
or costly than others.

We explore two methods for informing visual
word predictors about semantic similarities in a
distributional space: a) by sampling negative in-
stances of word such that they contain more dis-
similar objects, b) by labeling instances with a
more fine-grained real-valued supervision signal
derived from pairwise distributional similarities
between object names. We find that the latter,
similarity-based training method leads to substan-
tial improvements for particular words such as
entry-level nouns or hypernyms, whereas predic-
tors for other words such as adjectives do not ben-
efit from distributional knowledge. These results
suggest that, in principle, semantic relatedness
might be promising knowledge source for training
more accurate visual models of referential word
use, but it also supports recent findings showing
that distributional models do not capture all as-
pects of semantic relatedness equally well (Rubin-
stein et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016).

2 Models for Referential Word Meaning

We model referential word meanings as predictors
that can be applied to the visual representation of
an object and return a score indicating the appro-
priateness of the word for denoting the object. We
describe now different ways of defining these pre-
dictors with respect to semantic similarity.

Words as Predictors (WAP) We train a binary
classifier for each word w in the vocabulary. The
training set for each word w is built as follows:
all visual objects in an “image + referring expres-
sion” corpus that have been referred to as w are
used as positive instances, the remaining objects
as negative instances. Thus, the set of object im-
ages divides into w and ¬w, with the consequence
that all negative instances are considered equally
dissimilar from w. The classifiers are trained with
logistic regression (using `1 penalty). (This is the
(Schlangen et al., 2016) model.)

Undersampling similar objects (WAP-NOSIM)
As discussed above, it is intuitive to assume that
a visual classifier that distinguishes referents of a
word from other objects in an image should be
less penalized for making errors on objects that
are categorically related. For instance, the clas-
sifier for child should be less penalized for giving
high probabilities to referents of boy than to ref-
erents of car. A straightforward way to introduce
these differences during training is by undersam-
pling negative instances that have been referred to
by very similar words. (E.g., undersampling boy
instances as negative instances for the child classi-
fier.) This should allow the word classifier to focus
on visual distinctions between objects that are se-
mantically more important. When compiling the
training set of a WAP-NOSIM classifier for word w,
we look at its 10 most similar words in the vocab-
ulary according to a distributional model (trained
with word2vec, see below) and remove their in-
stances from the set of negative instances ¬w.
Word as Similarity Predictors (SIM-WAP) In-
stead of removing similar objects from the training
set of a word model, we can task the model with
directly learning similarities, by training it as a lin-
ear regression on a continuous output space. When
building the training set for such a word predictor
w, instead of simply dividing objects into w and
¬w instances, we label each object with a real-
valued similarity obtained from cosine similarity

between w and v in a distributional vector space,
where v is the word used to refer to the object.
Object instances where v = w (i.e., the positive
instances in the binary setup) have maximal simi-
larity; the remaining instances have a lower value
which is more or less close to maximal similarity.
This then yields a more fine-grained labeling of
what is uniformly considered as negative instances
in the binary set-up.

We transform the cosine similarities between
words in our vocabulary into standardised z scores
(mean: 0, sd: 1). When there are several word can-
didates used for an object in the corpus, we sim-
ply use the word v that has maximal similarity to
our target word w. The predictors are trained with
Ridge Regression.

3 Experimental Set-up

We focus on assessing to what extent similarity-
based visual word predictors capture the referen-
tial meaning of a word in a more accurate way, and
distinguish its potential referents from other ran-
dom objects. To factor out effects of composition-
ality and context that arise in reference generation
or resolution, we measure how well a predictor for
a word w is able to retrieve from a sampled test set
objects that have been referred to by w (Schlangen
et al., 2016; Zarrieß and Schlangen, 2016a) evalu-
ate on full referring expressions).

Data As training data, we use the training split
of the REFERIT corpus collected by (Kazemzadeh
et al., 2014), which is based on the medium-sized
SAIAPR image collection (Grubinger et al., 2006)
(99.5k image regions). For testing, we use the
training section of REFCOCO corpus collected by
(Yu et al., 2016), which is based on the MSCOCO
collection (Lin et al., 2014) containing over 300k
images with object segmentations. This gives us
a large enough test set to make stable predictions
about the quality of individual word predictors,
which often only have a few positive instances in
the test set of the REFERIT corpus. We follow
(Schlangen et al., 2016) and select words with a
minimum frequency of 40 in these two data sets,
which gives us a vocabulary of 793 words.

Evaluation For each word, we sample a test set
that includes all its positive instances, and posi-
tive vs. negative instances at a ratio of 1:100. We
apply the word classifier to all test instances and
assess how well it identifies (retrieves) its posi-

tive instances, i.e. visual objects that have been re-

age precision, corresponding to the area under the
curve (AUC) metric. In Section 4, we report per-
formance over the entire vocabulary and the subset
of entry-level nouns extracted from annotations in
the REFERIT corpus (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014).

Image and Word Embeddings Following
(Schlangen et al., 2016), we derive representa-
tions of our visual inputs with a convolutional
neural network, “GoogLeNet” (Szegedy et al.,
2015), that was trained on data from the ImageNet
corpus (Deng et al., 2009), and extract the final
fully-connected layer before the classification
layer, to give us a 1024 dimensional representation
of the region. We add 7 features that encode infor-
mation about the region relative to the image: the
(relative) coordinates of two corners, its (relative)
area, distance to the center, and orientation of the
image. The full representation hence is a vector of
1031 features. As distributional word vectors, we
use the word2vec representations provided by
Baroni et al. (2014) (trained with 5-word context
window, 10 negative samples, 400 dimensions).

4 Results

Overall In Table 1, we show the means of the
average precision scores achieved by the individ-
ual word predictors. Generally, the differences be-
tween the overall means for the different models
are mostly small, but we will see below that there
are more pronounced differences when looking at
particular parts of the vocabulary. On the REFERIT
test set, the simple binary classifiers (WAP) have
a slight advantage over the similarity-based meth-
ods. On REFCOCO, SIM-WAP performs best, im-
proving slightly over wac on the entire vocabulary
and substantially when looking at the subset of
entry-level nouns. By contrast, the WAP-NOSIM

Table 2: Evaluation of word predictors for hyper-

classifiers (trained with under sampling of simi-
lar objects) perform slightly worse as compared
to the standard binary classifiers on all test sets.
First, this suggests that there is an effect of cor-
pus or domain. Performance is substantially lower
on REFCOCO than on REFERIT, but the similarity-
based predictors generalize better across the data
sets. Second, this shows that under sampling is not
a good way of dealing with similar objects when
training word predictors whereas in similarity-
based training the model does take advantage of
distributional knowledge, at least in certain cases.

Individual Words As shown in Table 1, the
similarity-based training has a strong positive ef-
fect for entry-level nouns, whereas the effect on
the overall vocabulary is rather small. This further
suggests that distributional similarities improve
certain word predictors substantially, whereas oth-
ers might be affected even negatively. Therefore,
in the following, we report average precision for
individual words, namely for those cases where
similarity-based regression has the strongest posi-
tive or negative effect as compared to binary clas-
sification (see Tables 3 and 4 showing average pre-
cision scores, number of positive instances of the
word in the train and test set, and their seman-
tic neighbours in the vocabulary, according to the
vector space). We also look at hypernyms (Table
2) which are not easy to learn in realistic referring
expression data as more specific nouns are usually
more common or natural (Ordonez et al., 2016).

Where similarities help Table 3 shows results
for words where SIM-WAP improves most over
the binary WAP model on REFCOCO. It seems
that especially some low-frequent words benefit
from knowledge about object similarities, improv-
ing their average precision by more than 30% or
40% on the test set that contains more positive in-
stances even than were observed during training.

Table 3: Top 5 improvements for SIM-WAP over
WAP, for rare and more-frequent words

Similarly, predictors for hypernyms and their plu-
ral versions improve substantially, see Table 2. All
of these example words have semantic neighbours
that are also visually similar. Similarity-based
training of word predictors hence is very bene-
ficial for rare words (during training) that have
near-synonymy relations to other words in the cor-
pus. The positive effect here probably relates to
“feature-sharing”, as the predictor for “trailer” is
allowed to learn from the positive instances of
“truck”, rather than having to discriminate be-
tween the referents of the two words.

Where similarities do not help In Table 4, we
can see results for words where similarity-based
training does not help. For words with more
than 50 training instances, distributional similar-
ities degrade performance most for adjectives and
words expressing visual attributes (color, shape,
location). In these cases, distributional similarities
group attributes from the same scale (color or loca-
tion), but do not account for the fact that these are
visually distinct, such as in the case of e.g ’upper’
and ’lower’. Similarly, distributional similarities
between colors seem to be misleading rather than
helpful, cf. (Zarrieß and Schlangen, 2016b) for a
study on color adjectives on the same corpus. This
effect seems to be related to findings on antonyms
in distributional modeling (Nguyen et al., 2016).
Overall, as words corresponding to attributes are
quite frequent in the referring expression data, the
negative effect of similarity-based training seems
to balance out the positive effect found for certain
nouns in the overall evaluation. Similar effects can
also be found for nouns where semantic similar-
ities predicted by a distributional model seem to
diverge strongly from visual similarity that would

5 Discussion and Conclusion

Even with access to powerful state-of-the-art ob-
ject recognizers that classify objects in images into
thousands of categories with high accuracy, it is
still a challenging task to model referential mean-
ings of individual words and to capture various vi-
sual distinctions between semantically similar and
dissimilar words and their referents. In contrast to
abstract objects labels that are annotated consis-
tently in image corpora, word use in referring ex-
pressions is more flexible, and subject to a range
of communicative factors, in such a way that e.g.
some instances of child will be named not by this
but by similar words.

Our findings suggest that linking distributional
similarity to models for visual word predictors
capturing referential meaning is promising to ac-
count for the fact that the negative instances used
for training word predictors vary in their degree
of semantic similarity to the positive instances of
a word. We explored two different ways of inte-
grating this information—by undersampling and
by directly predicting similarity—and found the
prediction approach to work better, especially for
low- and medium-frequent words that have a range
of lexically similar neighbors in the model’s vo-
cabulary.

In a similar vein, zero-shot learning approaches
to object recognition (Frome et al., 2013; Lazari-
dou et al., 2014; Norouzi et al., 2013) have
transferred visual knowledge from known object
classes to unknown classes via distributional simi-
larity. Here, we show that visual knowledge can be

89



transferred between words in a corpus of referring
expressions, by taking into account their semantic
relation while learning.

Our results suggest that the exploration of joint
improvement of inferential (i.e., similarity-based)
and referential aspects of meaning should be a
fruitful avenue for future work.
