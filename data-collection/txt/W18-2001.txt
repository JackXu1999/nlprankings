How are Standards Important for MT?
1. Help with data and system interoperability

2. Implemented in software we want to use—so 
we deal with them whether or not we want to

3. Provide higher reliability/certainty than other 
methods of language ID, data exchange, and 
term retrieval

4. Provide guidance, replicability, and 
comparability in assessments

5. Sometimes cited/required in Requests for 
Proposal or in contracts—must show 
compliance 
• Direct specification

• Minimal technical proficiency, minimal cost; technical 
delta; etc. This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-SAThis Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND

Fragmentation, Heterogeneity, and Non-
Interoperability

“Current approaches to Machine Translation (MT) or professional 
translation evaluation, both automatic and manual, are characterized by

• A high degree of fragmentation, heterogeneity and a lack of 
interoperability between methods, tools and data sets. 

• As a consequence, it is difficult to reproduce, interpret, and compare 
evaluation results.”

held at LREC, 24 May 2016.

Increasing Collaboration of MT and CAT

• MT increasingly used in commercial environments

• Agile configurations of MT and Computer Assisted 
Translation (CAT)
• MT as an option in CAT

• Predictive MT in CAT

• Documents with different parts done with different 
methods

• Decisions of customer or service provider of tools to use

• Need for evaluations that encompass many 
approaches or that are neutral to the approach

• What role will standards have to play in the future?

• Are there viable and preferable alternatives to using standards?

• How can we make the standards more useful to the translation 
environment, particularly with MT?

• Where do we have gaps or issues?

• Where do we need additional work?

• Do we have the right organizations represented?

• Do we have the right people working on the standards?

Wherefore Language Codes?

• Demand by industry for codes for more languages

• Need for less ambiguity and overlap

• Need for linguistic rather than bibliographic orientation
• Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC 21)

• ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2

• Most commonly used system among linguists was The Ethnologue

• Need for consistency

16

Codes for the Representation of Language

• ISO 639-1 ar Arabic

• ISO 639-2 ara Arabic

• ISO 639-3 aeb Tunisian Arabic

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Status

• Correlated with many other standards

• Worldwide use

• Implemented for two decades in Microsoft, depending on keyboard

• ISO 639 up for review
• Meetings in March to discuss processes

• New ISO standards in development to supplement ISO 639
• Variants

• Registers

21

Issues

• Not coordinated with speech community

• Variable width difficult to implement with older databases

• Too few Q codes

• People repurposing codes because they like the mnemonics or 
because they are trying to express dialects or other information 
within the three-character format

• Difficult to meet requirements for new codes (although easier than it 
used to be!)

22

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Why is ISO 639 important for MT?

• Automatic language identification 
• Is not available for all languages and dialects

• Is not always possible with very small numbers of words

• Correctly tagged text needed, particularly in languages with less 
textual material, for
• Identification of text

• Application of tools

• Incorrectly tagged text can result in 
• Use of wrong tools on the data (e.g., spellchecker)

• Use of data incorrectly (e.g., in Translation Memories)
