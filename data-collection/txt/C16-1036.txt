Abstract

This paper introduces a continuous system capable of automatically producing the most adequate
speaking style to synthesize a desired target text. This is done thanks to a joint modeling of the
acoustic and lexical parameters of the speaker models by adapting the CVSM projection of the
training texts using MR-HMM techniques. As such, we consider that as long as sufficient variety
in the training data is available, we should be able to model a continuous lexical space into a con-
tinuous acoustic space. The proposed continuous automatic text to speech system was evaluated
by means of a perceptual evaluation in order to compare them with traditional approaches to the
task. The system proved to be capable of conveying the correct expressiveness (average adequacy
of 3.6) with an expressive strength comparable to oracle traditional expressive speech synthesis
(average of 3.6) although with a drop in speech quality mainly due to the semi-continuous nature
of the data (average quality of 2.9). This means that the proposed system is capable of improving
traditional neutral systems without requiring any additional user interaction.

1 Introduction

It is clear that in recent times there has been an increase in the penetration rates of speech technologies
and applications based in speech recognition or speech synthesis are more and more common. Speech
synthesis systems in particular have improved greatly in terms of speech intelligibility, speech quality
or naturalness in neutral read speech situations regardless of the technology (Barra-Chicote, 2011). The
problem appears when one needs to develop applications such as dialogue systems or robotic interfaces,
for which a more expressive way of speaking is more appropriate.

One of the main problems regarding expressive speech synthesis is the vast amount of possibilities
that have to be taken into account. Human expressiveness is not a discrete space but a continuous one,
and speaking styles vary greatly from person to person and even from time period to time period. As
such, obtaining enough data to cover all the requirements can become a very difficult task and scalability
a significant problem. This is why statistical parametric speech synthesis is better fitted to the task.
While unit-selection based systems have been proven to be more than capable of providing good quality

expressive speech (Adell et al., 2012; Andersson et al., 2010), the adaptability of HMM-based systems
allows us to better face the scalability problem.

The objective of the present paper is to introduce a complete TTS system capable of predicting the
most adequate speaking style in order to automatically adapt the produced voice to the target text. For that
objective we propose a continuous system based both in Continuous Vector Space Modeling (CVSM)
(Tonta and Darvish, 2010; Klein et al., 2011) and Multi-regression HMM (MR-HMM) (Fujinaga et al.,
2001), CVSM to model the expressive training texts as a continuous space and MR-HMM to make use
of that continuous space as auxiliary features for the HMM modeling. This results in a system capable
of characterizing input texts as a vector, which at the same time ends up producing the adequate acoustic
model associated to the input text. As such, as long as sufficient variety in the training data is available,
we would be able to model a continuous lexical space into a continuous acoustic space.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe corpus considered for training
the system. Section 3 gives a theoretical background to the proposed system and then explains in detail
the proposed method. Then, section 4 describes the perceptual evaluations environment, whose results
are described in section 4.1. Finally in section 5 we present the conclusions to be drawn from this paper
together with some ideas for future work.

2 Speech Corpus

For the present research we wanted to combine text processing techniques and speech synthesis tech-
niques, so the considered corpus had to not only cover a number of speaking styles with a reason-
able amount of text data, but also consist of speech from a single speaker, so that the synthesis models
could provide high quality synthetic speech. For that reason we utilized our self-designed and recorded
database: Spanish Speaking Styles.

2.1 Spanish Speaking Styles
Spanish Speaking Styles (SSS) is a speaking styles corpus recorded for a single male professional speaker
in 4 different speaking styles, with about 1 hour of speech per speaking style. The 4 speaking styles
(news broadcasting, interviews, live sports broadcasts and political speech) cover a large spectrum of
the expressive map (as can be seen in the F0-rhythm map that we can see in figure 1) while being
recognizable.

Two of the speaking styles (news and political speech) are scripted and the other two (live sports
broadcasts and interviews) unscripted. A summary of the database can be seen in table 1.

POLITICAL SPEECH 116 utts, 56min 21 utts, 11min
TOTAL 750 utts, 3h40min 84 utts, 36min

3 Expressive Speech Synthesis based on CVSM and MR-HMM

The ideal expressive TTS system should be able to handle any kind and any number of expressiveness
without requiring costly labeling or manipulations every time we want to add any new one. With this
purpose in mind the concept of a continuous system (i.e. a system in which expressiveness is treated as
a complete space instead of as discrete entities) fits perfectly. That is, in real life expressiveness present
overlap between them because there are not clear frontiers, so being able to take into account those
overlaps in the shape of a dynamic synthesizer would be ideal.

3.1 Continuous Vector Space Modeling
Traditional information retrieval techniques such as TF-IDF (Fautsch and Savoy, 2010) are commonly
based on the assumption that all the terms of the vocabulary lists of the documents do not have any re-
lationship to each other, which is ultimately false as language has semantic relationships that we should
be able to model (Tonta and Darvish, 2010; Klein et al., 2011). With that consideration in mind Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer et al., 2013), nowadays referred to as Con-
tinuous Vector Space Modeling (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2013; Andreas and Ghahramani, 2013)
was born.

CVSM aims to exploit the relationships between terms ti and documents dj by transforming them
into an alternate ”semantic” vector space, where both terms and documents are described by vectors of
similar dimensionality and directions, enabling direct comparisons (Olmos et al., 2013; Cosma and Joy,
2012).

Typically this step is done by means of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Reinsch,
1970; Henry et al., 2010), through which the latent semantic structure of the WTDM is shown.

3.2 Multi-Regression HMM
Multi-regression HMM is a particular kind of adaptation in which the model parameters are adapted
depending on auxiliary features instead of the acoustic features themselves. Initially this was developed
to exploit the correlation between F0 and the spectral features (Fujinaga et al., 2001), which significantly
improved isolated word recognition rates in a speech recognition task. Numerically speaking, the multi-
regression formula for M auxiliary features is defined as follows:

µ = r0 + r1�1 + . . .+ r1�M (1)

Where r0...M are the regression coefficients and r�...M the M auxiliary features. This particularity can
be exploited in speech synthesis to model additional information in the speaker models such as speaking
styles or emotions (Nose and Kobayashi, 2012; Ling et al., 2013), and it has been used for applications
as varied as generating walking motion models (Niwase et al., 2005).

3.3 Proposed System
Figure 2 shows the proposed flowchart for the continuous, MRHMM-based system. There we can see
many fundamental differences with the discrete and semi-continuous approach, both at training time and
at synthesis time.

Figure 2: Schematic of the proposed continuous approach to the expressive TTS system.

Most notably, there is no traditional adaptation process involved in the system, but a MR-HMM adap-
tation that takes the CVSM projections of each training text file as the control vector ~x′ for a training
process that outputs a new model that combines both neutral and expressive information. Also we can
see how there is no need for a centroid estimation, as there is no genre prediction carried out at synthesis
time. Instead, only the CSVM matrices are kept as the output so that at synthesis time the synthesis text
can be projected to obtain ~x′i, which will be used directly at the speech generation process. This process
is then capable of producing an expressive speech output without relying in any genre prediction system,
only in the CVSM projections of the synthesis texts.

4 Perceptual Evaluation

For the proposed perceptual evaluation we considered two approaches to the continuous modeling: a
first one that directly utilized the CVSM-projected vectors ~x′ and a second one that normalized each
component by the maximum of their respective component ~̄x′ = {v1/vMAX1, . . . , v4/vMAX4} where
vMAXi = max (vi)∀vi in the training data. The second approach was considered in case reducing the
dispersion of the control vector values helped the MR-HMM re-estimation process. The same normal-
ization was applied to the synthesis control vectors. In total 8 systems were evaluated (2 versions with
4 speaking styles each), which following the Latin Square approach (Gao, 2005), meant that we needed
8 different utterances to be synthesized for all the systems to be presented to the listeners in a random
order without repetitions.

372



The test itself was carried out by means of a web interface, where the evaluator was presented with a
button to play the audio sample and the transcription of the uttered texts. The samples could be played as
many times as desired. Then, the listener was asked to rate the utterances in the traditional 5 point MOS
evaluation in terms of adequacy of the utterance to the text (from not adequate to very adequate), speech
quality (from very bad to very good) and perceived expressive strength when comparing to a hypothetical
neutral version (very low to very high).

Regarding the speaker models, the whole train section of SSS database and the neutral speech of
the same speaker present in SEV database (Barra-Chicote et al., 2008) were modeled into an average
voice model (AVM) by applying Speaker Adaptive Training (SAT) (Anastasakos et al., 1997) with three
feature streams with their ∆ and ∆2 coefficients: logarithm of the fundamental frequency (1 coefficient),
mel-cepstral analysis coefficients (MCEP, 60 coefficients) and aperiodicity bands (25 coefficients). The
models were adapted by means of the CSMAPLR algorithm (Yamagishi et al., 2009).

In terms of the statistical significance of the results, we applied the Wilkoxon Signed-Rank Test for
a 95% confidence ratio in order to obtain the error margins. 16 subjects took part in each evaluation to
guarantee double coverage of the Latin square matrix.

4.1 Evaluation Results
Figures 4 to 3 show the results for both continuous system evaluations (C Normalized for the normal-
ized version and Continuous for the non-normalized one), together with neutral speech (N), traditional
emotional system (S) and natural voice (NAT). The results for the non-continuous systems have been
extracted from other works to serve as a reference. It is important to emphasize that this evaluation con-
sidered only utterances that could be synthesized, which represented a 65% for the normalized version
and 60% for the non-normalized one, details for each system-style interaction can be seen in table 2.

Synth. Rate C Normalized Continuous
Interview 48% 43%

News 81% 67%
Speech 81% 90%
Sports 52% 38%

Average 65% 60%

Table 2: Percentage of synthesizable test sentences for each system-style pair. C Normalized represents
the normalized implementation of the continuous system and Continuous the non-normalized one.

Speech quality (figure 3) does show some bad results, an average quality of 2.93 for the basic system
and 2.73 for the normalized system, which is significantly worse than all other systems. This is supposed
to be mainly because the continuous system introduces a large amount of artifacts. This effect was
somewhat expected due to the inherent semi-continuous nature of the SSS database: the professional
speaker was asked to interpret the four speaking styles showing as little variation as possible so that
they were clear representatives of their paralinguistic characteristics, so modeling them in a continuous
fashion is not possible without additional data. More varied data or a more naturally continuous task is
expected to fare better for the continuous system.

On the other hand, in the adequacy results (figure 4) we can see how the system provides significant
increases when compared to traditional neutral systems. In the case of the normalized system, the average
adequacy is 3.47 and 3.60 for the non-normalized version, not significantly worse than the 3.78 of the
traditional expressive synthesis. Interviews, due to its extremely conversational nature was not modeled
adequately.

Finally perceived expressive intensity results (figure 5) show a similar image to adequacy. Significantly
better than using a neutral system, both proposed continuous systems show a 3.51 average perceived
expressive intensity, which is once again comparable to the 3.65 of the non-predictive speech synthesis.
Even so the systems are far from the 4.07 of natural speech and are much better than the 2.51 of neutral
speech.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We have introduced a complete TTS system is capable of synthesizing the most adequate expressiveness
to the target text without relying in genre prediction techniques, just by making use of the CVSM projec-
tion of the input text as a control factor of the speaker model, which vastly increases the versatility of the
system as we remove the need for labeling the training data genre. This system proved to be capable of
conveying the correct expressiveness (average adequacy of 3.6) with an expressive strength comparable
to oracle traditional expressive speech synthesis (average of 3.6) although at a significant drop in speech
quality mainly due to the semi-continuous nature of the data (average quality of 2.9).

374



All in all we have introduced a different approach to expressive speech synthesis where the system
automatically adjusts the produced speaking style according to the text to be synthesized without requir-
ing any output from the user besides providing adequate training data. The system has shown that it is
capable of significantly improving the traditional neutral speech synthesis systems in the task, and also
of providing similar adequacy and perceived expressive strength rates than those of natural voice.

For future work we want to consider a broader array of expressiveness, in order to find a problem
where the continuous modeling fits naturally: a more complete speaking styles collection, or even con-
sidering sub-spaces of speaking styles, including more conversational speaking styles in an attempt to
solve the problems that arose with interviews. Another field that we want to work on is on bringing
our systems into the DNNs and RNNs world. This task will prove challenging as there is still not many
researches underway on DNN-based expressive speech synthesis. Finally, carrying out evaluations in
real life systems such as car navigation systems or robotic assistants in scenarios not as constrained as
the ones we evaluated would provide much needed information on how research systems fare in the real
world, which would undoubtedly give hints on where more to focus our efforts.
