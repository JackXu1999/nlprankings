Abstract

The paper describes overt marking of in-
formation structure in the indigenous An-
dean language Aymara. In this paper we
show that although the word order is free,
Aymara is not a discourse-configurational
language (Kiss, 1994); instead, informa-
tion structure is expressed only morpho-
logically by pragmatic suffixes. The mark-
ing of ‘topic’ is more flexible that the
marking of ‘focus’ (be it at the clause level
or NP-internal). Since overt marking of
information structure is partial, this pa-
per also devotes considerable attention to
the resolution of underspecification in Ay-
mara.

1 Introduction

Chomsky’s original approach to formal syntax as-
sumes that sentences consist of constituents and
that the type and order of these constituents define
configurations that specify grammatical relations.
As has been shown by Hale (1983), there are lan-
guages in which word order has no or limited rele-
vance for grammatical relations and the respective
constituent trees are flat. In most such languages,
word order is said to specify information struc-
ture (hence the name discourse-configurational
languages coined by Kiss (1994), as opposed
to syntax-configurational languages). We show
that Aymara is neither syntax-configurational nor
discourse-configurational. In this language, in-
formation structure is expressed solely morpho-
logically. This is very rare and therefore Ay-
mara is very important for the research of informa-
tion structure in general. As Bossong (2009) puts
it (referring to Aymara and Quechua): “Cross-
linguistically, grammemes explicitly expressing
the function of theme are not very frequent; gram-
memes expressing the function of the rheme are a

highly marked typological rarity [. . . ]. Still more
idiosyncratic is the combination of the thematic
marker with a grammeme combining the two func-
tions of question and negation.”

We are not aware of any other language (except
for, to some extent, Quechua) in which word or-
der is irrelevant to information structure. Hard-
man (2000) says about Aymaran languages that
“[t]he structural elements of a sentence may occur
in any order and are at the disposal of the speaker
for stylistic play.” Hardman et al. (2001) say that
word order in Aymara “affects only style, not the
grammar nor basic semantics.” Bossong (1989)
says about Quechua (which is typologically very
similar) that “word order is not only free but it
is not primarily used as a means for expressing
pragmatic functions as such.” A detailed analy-
sis of morphological information structure mark-
ing in Aymara can thus shed light on this module
of grammar which is not expressed morphologi-
cally in most languages.

Section 2 presents basic facts about Aymara.
Section 3 describes the overtly marked discourse
categories in Aymara. Section 4 describes the
means of morphosyntactic, semantic and prag-
matic referent identification. Section 5 treats prag-
matic marking in complex predicates. Finally, we
conclude in Section 6.

2 Basic Facts about Aymara

Aymara is spoken by communities in a region en-
compassing Bolivia, Chile and Peru, extending
north of Lake Titicaca to south of Lake Poopó, be-
tween the western limit of the Pacific coast val-
leys and eastward to the Yungas valleys. The lan-
guage is spoken by roughly two million speakers,
over half of whom are Bolivian. The rest reside
in Peru and Chile. The Aymaran family (com-
prised of Aymara, Jaqaru, and Kawki) is a lin-
guistic isolate with no close relative. Aymara is

98



an affixal polysynthetic1 language (according to
Mattissen’s (2006) classification) with a rich mor-
phology. It is SOV with modifier-head word order.
Aside from the morphologically unmarked sub-
ject, all syntactic relations are case-marked, typi-
cally on the NP head. Roots can be divided into
nouns (including qualitative words), verbs, and
particles. Suffixes, which may have a morpholog-
ical or syntactic effect, can be classified as nomi-
nal, verbal, transpositional, independent, or prag-
matic suffixes. The category of independent suf-
fixes is comprised of three suffixes which are not
classifiable as members of either nominal or verbal
morphology which likewise cannot be said to be
pragmatic suffixes. These suffixes generally occur
prior to inflectional morphology and/or the prag-
matic suffixes. Pragmatic suffixes, by comparison,
typically suffix to the last word of the entire sen-
tence and/or the NP or VP. As their name suggests,
their function is overall pragmatic in nature. Nom-
inal and verbal suffixes can be subdivided into
inflectional and derivational categories, but given
the ease with which category-changing transposi-
tional suffixes attach to words of any category, of-
ten multiple times, it is common to find words with
several nominal, verbal, transpositional, and inde-
pendent suffixes.

Detailed information can be found in (Hardman
et al., 2001; Briggs, 1976; Adelaar, 2007; Cerrón-
Palomino and Carvajal, 2009; Yapita and Van der
Noordaa, 2008).

3 Overt Marking of Information
Structure

As mentioned in the introduction, word order in
Aymara is not used to express information struc-
ture. As an example, consider the following sen-
tences in English (syntax-configurational), Rus-
sian (discourse-configurational) and Aymara (sub-
script N marks contextually new, i.e. nonpre-
dictable information):

(1)
(a) Peter cameN

It’s PeterN who came (*Came Peter)
(b) Pëtr prišëlN

Prišël PëtrN
(c) Pedrox jutiwaN or JutiwN Pedroxa

PedrowN jutixa or Jutix PedrowaN
1See (Baker, 1996).

Due to overt morphological marking of infor-
mation structure, there are discontinuous phrases
in which the “gap” is not motivated by pragmat-
ics, such as (2)2. The corresponding tree is given
in Figure 1.

(2) Juma-n-x
you-gen-ref

jiw-i-w
die-smpl3→3-npred

kimsa
three

ch’iyar
black

phisi-ma-xa
cat-poss2-ref

“Your three black cats died.”

jiwiwNPRED

phisimaxaREF

jumanxREF kimsa ch’iyar

Figure 1: The surface syntax tree of (2) with a dis-
continuous noun phrase

Of course, the possessive pronoun jumanx could
also form a continuous constituent with the rest of
the NP. Or, it might be omitted since the posses-
siveness is already expressed with the suffix -ma
(phisimaxa).

Overt marking of information structure is oblig-
atory in Aymara. A sentence without proper prag-
matic suffixes (or with marking that would destroy
intersentential cohesion) is considered ill-formed.
It should also be noted that the marking of infor-
mation structure is orthogonal to the morphosyn-
tactic expression of evidentiality.3

3.1 Referentiality
Aymara has overt marking of referentiality. The
notion of referentiality roughly corresponds to

2We use the following abbreviations in the glosses:
ACC=accusative, AG=agentive, AGGR=aggregator,
ALL=allative, BEN=benefactive, CAUS=causative,
COM=comitative, CONJ=conjectural, DIR=directive,
FUT=future tense, GEN=genitive, HON=honorific,
HUM=human, IMPER=imperative, INCMPL=incompletive,
INF=infinitive, LIM=limitative, LOC=locative, MIR=mirative,
NEG=negative, NPRED=nonpredictable, PAST=past tense,
PART=past participle, POSS=possessive, POSS1=1st person
possessive, POSS2=2nd person possessive, POSS3=3rd
person possessive, POT=potential, PROGR=progressive,
QM=question marker, REF=referential, REFL=reflexive,
SMPL=simple tense, TRGRDS=transgressive (differ-
ent subject), TRGRSS=transgressive (same subject),
VRBL=verbalizer

3Aymara has a three-way system of evidentiality: wit-
nessed, knowledge through language, and inferred.

99



what Sgall et al. (1986) call ‘contextual bound-
edness’. We follow Sgall’s (2009) terminology
here: “[Contextually bound] items are presented
by the speaker as referring to entities assumed to
be easily accessible by the hearer(s), in the pro-
totypical case ‘given’. They refer to ‘established’
items, i.e. to those that were mentioned in the pre-
ceding co-text and thus still are sufficiently salient,
or to the permanently established ones (indexicals,
those given by the relevant culture or technical do-
main, etc.).”4

For the majority of bilingual speakers, referen-
tiality is optionally marked with the suffix -xa,5

however for monolinguals it is done so more con-
sistently. There are also slight dialectal differ-
ences.

For example, in (3) the verb is marked as refer-
ential because the event is known from the context
(the speaker supposes that the hearer knows that
someone came, otherwise he would not ask).

(3) Khiti-s
who-qm

jut-i-xa?
come-SMPL3→3-REF

“Who did come?”

On the other hand, in (5) the verb is not marked
as referential because it expresses an event which
is apparently unknown to the hearer (since he has
expressed surprise in (4)).

(4) Aka-n-ka-sk-ta-sä
this-loc-vrbl-progr-smpl2→3-mir
“Oh, you are here!”

(5) Jïsa,
yes

wasüru-w
yesterday-npred

kutin-x-ta
return-COMPL-SMPL1→3
“Yes, I came back yesterday.”

The adverbial expression wasüruw “yesterday”
is marked as nonpredictable6 (even though it is
inherently referential) because it is more salient
than the verb7 (B is surprised to see A because

4We do not use the terminology ‘topic-focus’ or ‘theme-
rheme’ because the paradigms of suffixes that express infor-
mation structure do not correlate with it. For example, the
two paradigms are not always mutually exclusive (two suf-
fixes from different paradigms can mark the same word).

5In the literature this suffix is usually called “topic
marker” or “attenuator”.

6This grammatical feature is described in the next subsec-
tion.

7“More salient” means that it is more important in the cur-
rent context. Informally, we could also say “less predictable”.
The scale of salience is important for intersentential referent
identification.

he thought that A had left or was about to leave).
Nonetheless, the verb is nonpredictable, too, be-
cause B does not know what exactly happened (A
may have come back earlier or may not have left
at all).

Note that -xa marks referentiality, not
known/given information, as illustrated in (6).

(6) Qharüru-x
tomorrow-ref

sara-:-wa
go-fut1→3-npred

“I will go tomorrow.”

The adverbial expression qharürux “tomorrow”
is marked as referential because it is inherently ref-
erential but there is no marking which would spec-
ify if it is predictable or not (the verb is already
marked as nonpredictable and there can be at most
one NPRED-marker per clause, as explained in the
next subsection).8

It should be noted the the REF-marking is priva-
tive, i.e. the absence of -xa does not mean that the
entity is not referential.

3.2 Nonpredictability
Entities are nonpredictable if they are ‘new’ to
the hearer (cf. the usual dichotomy of informa-
tion structure known/given vs. unknown/new).9

Overt marking of nonpredictability in Aymara is
much more consequent than that of referentiality.
In affirmative sentences, the most salient nonpre-
dictable entity is marked with the suffix -wa.10

The placement of the NPRED-marker can be best
explained by question/answer pairs, such as (7)
and (8).

(7) Khiti-taki-s
who-ben-qm

ut-x
house.acc-ref

uta-ch-ta-xa
house-caus-smpl2→3-ref
“For whom did you build the house?”

8A reviewer suggested to compare pragmatic marking
in Aymara with ‘topic’-markers in Japanese and/or Korean.
First of all, whereas in the mentioned languages, topic mark-
ing interferes with case marking, in Aymara they are orthog-
onal. Also, in Aymara the use of pragmatic markers does not
affect word order. Finally, there are no free topics as in the
following sentence from (Iwasaki, 2013):

Zoo-waTOP hana-gaNOM nagai
“The elephant; its nose is long.”
In Aymara, even if the word order of a NP is relaxed, all

parts of the NP agree with each other.
9Again, we follow Sgall’s (2009) terminology: “[Contex-

tually non-bound] items are presented as not directly pre-
dictable in the given context, as ‘new’ information (at least
as chosen from a set of available alternatives).”

10In the literature this suffix is often called “affirmative”,
“emphasizing”, or “declarative”.

100



(8) Jilata-ja-taki-w
brother-poss1-ben-npred
(uta-ch-t-xa)
house-caus-smpl1→3-ref
“(I built it) for my brother.”

In negative sentences, the NPRED-marker is
usually attached to the negative particle jani, as
in (9).

(9) Jani-w
not-npred

kullaka-ma-r
sister-poss2-all

uñj-k-t-ti
see-incmpl-smpl1→3-neg
“I did not see your sister.”

However, if an argument of the verb is more
salient than the verb (i.e., it is contrastive), it at-
tracts the NPRED-marker, as in (10).

(10) Kullaka-ma-ru-w
sister-poss2-all-npred

jan
not

uñj-k-t-ti
see-incmpl-smpl1→3-neg
“It is your sister whom I did not see.”

There are constructions in which NPRED-marks
are disallowed, for example in imperative con-
structions or in those marked with the conjectural
evidential suffix:

(11) Chur-ita-ya
give-imper2→1-hon
“Give it to me, please.”

(12) Jut-chi-ni
come-conj-fut3→3
“Maybe he will come.”

NPRED-unmarked affirmative sentences in the
future tense tend to have imperative meaning:

(13) Sara-ñäni
go-fut4→3
“Let us go.”

An affirmative sentence without NPRED-
marking in the future tense does not alter the
context of the present discourse and may have
modal meaning (Hardman et al., 2001):

(14) Nay
I

sar-ä-xa
go-fut1→3-ref

“I will go, right? / Should I go?”

Noun phrases introduced by mä “one” are indef-
inite and therefore always nonpredictable. Noun
phrases with the determiners aka “this”, uka
“that”, khaya (khä) “yonder” and khuri “away
yonder” are definite and therefore usually pre-
dictable unless they are explicitly NPRED-marked
(in which case they are contrastive). The following
example illustrates that referentiality and nonpre-
dictability do not exclude each other.

(15) Aka
this

warmi-mpi-w
woman-com-npred

mä
one

jisk’a
small

marka-n
village-loc

jiki-s-t-xa
meet-refl-smpl1→3-ref

“It is this woman whom I met in a small
village.”

In verbal complexes, the main (nonfinite) verb
may be NPRED-marked, as in (16) and (17):

(16) T’ant’
bread.ACC

ala-ñ-w
buy-inf-npred

mun-ta
want-smpl1→3
“I want to buy bread.”

(17) T’ant’
bread.ACC

al-iri-w
buy-ag-npred

sara-sk-ta
go-progr-smpl1→3
“I am going to buy bread.”

3.3 Deeply Embedded Nonpredictable
Elements

Nonpredictability is usually marked at clause level
but it can occur inside a noun phrase11 if it
is required by the discourse context, as in (18)
(from (Hardman et al., 2001)).12

(18) Naya-n-x
I-gen-ref

pusi-w
four-NPRED

uta-ja-x
house-poss1-ref

utj-itu
exist-smpl3→1

“As for houses, I have four.”

This example shows that REF and NPRED mark-
ers need not appear at the end of a (semantic)
phrase. Similarly, a nominal modifier may follow

11Hajičová et al. (1998) call this kind of information-
structural marking proxy focus.

12In this example, pusiw is not contrastive, it is simply an
answer to the question How many houses do you have? Of
course, one could say just Pusiwa.

101



its governor if its information structure status dif-
fers from that of its head in which case both words
receive pragmatic marking, as in (19) (from (Hard-
man et al., 2001)).

(19) Uka-x
that-ref

apilla-x
oca-REF

luxu-cha-ta-wa
freeze-caus-part-npred
“That is FROZEN oca.”

Aymara is a radically nonconfigurational lan-
guage.13 However, even languages from this class
may pose word order constraints on “deeply” em-
bedded phrases. Indeed, in Aymara noun phrases
have more rigid word order than clause con-
stituents.14 For example, while (20) is well-
formed, (21) is ill-formed because the modifier
suma “good” does not precede its head.

(20) Suma
good

chuq’i-w
potato-npred

aka
this

marka-n-x
village-loc-ref

ach-u
grow-smpl3→3

“In this village grow good potatoes.”

(21) *Chuq’i-w
potato-npred

suma
good

aka
this

marka-n-x
village-loc-ref

ach-u
grow-smpl3→3

Intended meaning: “In this village grow
good potatoes.”

Nevertheless the order of a nominal modifier
and its head is not restricted if both have a prag-
matic marker, as in (22)–(24).

(22) Suma-w
good-npred

aka
this

marka-n-x
village-loc-ref

chuq’i-x
potato-ref

ach-u
grow-smpl3→3

“GOOD potatoes grow in this village.”

(23) Uta-cha-ña-taki-x
house-caus-inf-ben-ref

qala-x
stone-ref

alluxa-w
a-lot-npred

apthapi-ña
gather-inf

“One must gather MANY stones to build a
house.”

13In terms of the generative grammar, languages with the
rule S → C+ at clause level.

14Unlike, for example, in Latin, where the word order of
NPs is less rigid although not completely free.

(24) Qullq-x
money.acc-ref

allux-w
a-lot.acc-npred

ap-kat-ta
put-dir-smpl1→3
“I collected A LOT of money.”

Thus Aymara, like many nonconfigurational
languages, allows discontinuous constituents. For
example, in (22), the noun phrase sumaw chuq’ix
“good potatoes” is discontinuous because aka
markanx “in this village” is not part of its surface
syntax subtree.

3.4 Focalizers
“Focalizers” (i.e. focusing operators, in English
adverbs such as only, even, also, always, at least,
etc., see (Hajičová et al., 1998)) are mostly ex-
pressed by suffixes in Aymara. In many cases, the
word with a focalizing suffix attracts the NPRED-
marking, as in (25)–(28).

(25) Kimsa-ni-ki-w
three-hum-lim-npred

sar-i
go-smpl3→3

“Only three went.”

(26) Wawa-pa-x
child-poss3-ref

may-ni-ki-wa
one-hum-lim-npred

“He has only one child.”

(27) Iki-ña-k-w
sleep-inf-lim-npred
mun-t-xa
want-smpl1→3-ref
“I only want to sleep.”

(28) Nay
I

kuna-w
what-npred

sar-t-xa
go-smpl1→3-ref

“Even I went.”

Another pattern is attaching the independent ag-
gregator -sa to the focalized word together with
NPRED-marking of the verb, as in (29) and (30).

(29) Naya-s
I-aggr

sara-rak-t-wa
go-‘also’-smpl1→3-npred

“I also went.”

(30) Juma-ki-s
you-lim-aggr

yati-sma-wa
know-pot2→3-npred

“At least you should know it.”

The focalizing negative particle jani “not” at-
tracts the NPRED-marking in unmarked cases (but

102



see (10)). Two focalizers can be combined, as in
the case of jani and puni “always” which gives
the form janipuni “never” or jani and raki “also”
which gives the form janiraki “neither”. Both
forms attract the NPRED-marking.

3.5 Resolving Underspecification
As was demonstrated in the above description,
overt marking of information structure in Aymara
is partial, as it leaves some elements underspec-
ified. Since Aymara is a radical pro-drop lan-
guage15 (any argument of the verb may be unex-
pressed, not only the subject), predictable argu-
ments are often omitted. As a consequence, direct
objects are usually omitted if they can be inferred
from the context, as in (31).16

(31) Tata-ja-taki-w
father-poss1-ben-npred
ala-sk-t-xa
buy-progr-smpl1→3-ref
“I am buying it for my father.”

It follows that if a verb is NPRED-marked and
has an overt object, the latter is nonpredictable,
too, unless it is REF-marked, as in (32).

(32) Naya-w
I-npred

um-x
water.acc-ref

wayu-ni-:-xa
carry-dir-fut1→3-ref
“It is me who will bring the water.”

The same holds for other verbal arguments.
The only ambiguity arises from inherently referen-
tial expressions which appear REF-marked or un-
marked (e.g., qharürux/qharüru “tomorrow”) and
this marking does not correlate with their nonpre-
dictability.17

3.6 Intersentential Cohesion
Overt marking of information structure, described
in the previous section, has crucial importance
for intersentential cohesion and can be helpful for
coreference resolution. Consider, for example, the
following two sentences:

15See (Cole, 1987).
16The sentence is an answer to the question Who are you

buying it for?
17It is possible that the category of referentiality is under-

going a reanalysis as a result of language contact. A more
detailed analysis of the speech of monolingual speakers is
needed.

(33) Mä
one

marka-n
village-loc

mä
one

jisk’a
small

imilla-w
girl-NPRED

utj-i
exist-smpl3→3
“There was a little girl in a village.”

(34) Jupa-x
she-ref

Mariya
María

suti-ni-wa
name-poss-npred

“Her name was María.”

In (33), both noun phrases as well as the verb
are nonpredictable. The noun imilla “girl” is
NPRED-marked (i.e., marked as the most salient
part of the utterance) because in (34), it is referred
to by the pronoun jupa “he/she”.

The analysis of utterances in texts such as sto-
ries and narratives reveals that Aymara speakers
consequently take intersentential cohesion into ac-
count when they decide where to place pragmatic
markers.

4 Referent Identification

Surface and deep syntax as well as semantics oper-
ate on isolated sentences. Now we will discuss the
formalization of pragmatics, the level of discourse
context.

For the purposes of this subsection we assume
that we have a discourse that consists of sentences
s1, . . . , sn and that we have the corresponding fea-
ture structures f1, . . . , fn. An entity we call a fea-
ture structure that represents a person, an object or
an event (an event may be dynamic if described by
a verb or statal if described by a nominal predi-
cate). Every entity has a special attribute, INDEX,
to represent coreferences.

The discourse context is formally a list of
indices (values of the INDEX attribute) C =
〈i1, . . . , im〉. The sentences are processed one by
one. At the beginning, C = ∅. For every fi, we do
the following:

1. For every entity in fi, we try to find its refer-
ent in C (we describe below how referents are
identified). If a referent was found for an en-
tity, its index in C is moved to the beginning
of the list. Otherwise, a new index is assigned
to the entity and prepended to the list.

2. The index of the NPRED-marked entity is
moved (or prepended) to the beginning of C.

There are various strategies of identification of
referents in the preceding discourse that can com-
bine to resolve ambiguities.

103



4.1 Morphosyntactic Referent Identification
Aymara has a rich system of switch-reference suf-
fixes that help to identify referents in the discourse
context. For example, the sentence

(35) Tumasi-xi
Thomas-ref
klasi-n-ka-ska-:n-wa
class-loc-vrbl-progr-past3→3-npref
“Thomasi was in the class room.”

may be followed by the following sentence:

(36) Yatichiri-xj
teacher-ref

manta-n-isin-x
enter-dir-trgrss-ref

nuw-i-wa
hit-smpl3→3-npred
“When the teacherj entered, hej hit himi.”

The first sentence adds the index of the en-
tity Tumasixi “Thomas” to C. The second sen-
tence adds the index of the entity Yatichirixj “the
teacher” to C. Furthermore, there are two unre-
solved (covert) pronouns that represent the actor
and the patient of nuwiwa “to hit”. In this case the
switch-reference transgressive suffix -sina speci-
fies that the actor of nuwiwa is the actor of man-
tasinx “entered”, thus the actor of nuwiwa has the
index i. The patient is coindexed with the next
entity in C with which it agrees morphologically
(e.g., in terms of animacy) or semantically. On the
other hand, the sentence

(37) Yatichiri-xj
teacher-ref

manta-n-ipan-x
enter-dir-trgrds-ref

nuw-i-wa
hit-smpl3→3-npred
“When the teacherj entered, hei hit himj .”

changes the indexes of the pronouns in the ma-
trix sentence because the switch-reference trans-
gressive suffix -ipana specifies that the subject of
mantanipanx is different from that of nuwiwa.

4.2 Semantic Referent Identification
If there is the sentence

(38) Tumasi-mpi
Thomas-com

Marya-mpj
Mary-com

uñj-t-wa
see-smpl1→3-npred
“I saw Thomasi and Maryj .”

followed by

(39) Jani-w
not-npred

usuri-:-ta-p
pregnant-vrbl-part-poss3

yat-k-t-ti
know-incmpl-smpl1→3-neg
“I did not now that shej was pregnant.”

the referent identification of the covert pronoun
which is the actor of usurïtap “that she was preg-
nant” is not morphosyntactically restricted (Ay-
mara has one pronoun, jupa, for both “he” and
“she”) but it is semantically restricted. It is obvi-
ous that the semantic information of this kind has
to come from the lexicon. Likewise, there will be
lexically encoded semantic gender for words such
as tayka “mother”, jilata “brother”, imilla “girl”,
etc.

4.3 Pragmatic Referent Identification
As described in Subsection 3.6, explicitly NPRED-
marked entities are more salient than other non-
predictable entities in the same sentence. If there
is the sentence

(40) Tayka-ma-wi
mother-poss2-npred
yatichiri-ma-mpj
teacher-poss2-com

jik-i-si
meet-smpl3→3-refl

(41) Usuta-:-ta-m-x
sick-vrbl-part-poss2-ref

“Shei already knew that you were sick.”

the actor of yatxiwa “s/he already knew” is coin-
dexed with taykamaw “your mother” because this
entity is NPRED-marked in the first sentence and
therefore more salient (it precedes other entities in
C). If we move the NPRED-marker in the first sen-
tence to the “teacher”, the meaning of the second
sentence will change:

(42) Tayka-ma-xi
mother-poss2-ref
yatichiri-ma-mpi-wj
teacher-poss2-com-npred
jik-i-si
meet-smpl3→3-refl
“Your motheri met your teacherj .”

5 Complex Predicates

A special case of pragmatic marking represent
the so-called complex predicates, i.e. monoclausal
predicates composed of (at least) two predicative
elements. In such constructions, a (fully) semantic
verb combines with a modal or auxiliary element
to express complex predication such as causative,
volitive, supine, etc. The concept of complex
predicates, elaborated by Alsina (1996), has been
applied to a number of phenomena and languages
including, for example, Hindi light verbs (Mo-
hanan, 1994) or Turkish causatives (Çetinoğlu et
al., 2008). We will leave aside the rather compli-
cated formal treatment of these constructions in
unification-based grammars (Homola and Coler,
2013) and focus on the linguistic description of
these form in Aymara from the pragmatic point of
view here.

Sentences (16) and (17) are examples of com-
plex predicates. The constructions contain only
one NPRED-marker, i.e. they are monoclausal and
should be represented by a single feature structure
with a complex functor. For (16), we get:

(44)



FUNC ‘muna-’

ARGS

〈
subjact,




FUNC ‘ala-’
ARGS 〈subjact,

dobjpat〉


pat




For (17), we get:

(45)



FUNC ‘sara-’

ARGS

〈
subjact,




FUNC ‘ala-’
ARGS 〈subjact,

dobjpat〉


pat

〉




In a more concise notation, (44) can be written
as:

(46) muna(subjact, ala(subjact, dobjpat)pat)

Likewise, (45) can be written as:

(47) sara(subjact, ala(subjact, dobjpat)pat)

Unlike in languages with morphologically
formed volitive verbal complexes, such as

Guaraní, in Aymara such constructions are formed
syntactically (i.e. the complex predicate value is
not created in the lexicon). As for motion verbs,
such as (45), there is a morphological alternative:

(48) Jichha-x
now-REF

t’ant
bread.ACC

ala-ni-rapi-:ma-wa
buy-DIR-BEN-FUT1→2-NPRED
“I will go to buy bread for you now.”

Further evidence that such predicates are mon-
oclausal is the fact that polypersonal agreement is
expressed on the auxiliary or modal verb, not the
full one, as in (49) and (50).

(49) Ch’uq
potato.ACC

alja-ñ-w
sell-INF-NPRED

mun-sma
want-SMPL1→2
“I want to sell potatoes to you.”

(50) Tump-iri-w
visit-AG-NPRED

jut-sma
come-SMPL1→2

“I came to visit you.”

It is noteworthy that a complex predicate with a
motion verb can have two complements, namely a
locative phrase and a verbal complement:

(51) Al-iri-w
buy-AG-NPRED

Chukiaw
La.Paz.ACC

sara-:na
go-SMPL3→3
“He went to La Paz to buy it.”

Even more evidence for monoclausality can be
found in sentences like (52):

(52) Chukiaw
La.Paz.ACC

sara-ñ-w
go-INF-NPRED

mun-t-x
want-SMPL1→3-REF

irnaqa-ña-taki-xa
work-INF-BEN-REF

“I want to go to La Paz for work.”

In (52), the nominalized verb irnaqañatakixa
“to work” depends on sarañw “to go” creating a
long-distance dependency. Without considering
the verbal complex sarañw muntx a monoclausal
predicate, it would be linguistically counterintu-
itive and computationally hard to parse the sen-
tence.

It is obvious from the mentioned examples
that the NPRED-marker tends to attach to the full

105



verb. This fact supports the hypothesis that modal
(deictic) syntactic elements should be considered
synsemantic, i.e. at the level of deep syntax they
should be represented as attributes of the nodes of
their heads rather then autonomous nodes or fea-
ture structures. This approach, adopted by us, is
consistent with (Sgall et al., 1986).

We omit from the discussion morphologi-
cally built complex predicates, such as causatives
(e.g. (53)). In other languages where they are ex-
pressed syntactically, they would be treated in the
same way as the constructions described above.

(53) Jacha-y-t-wa
cry-CAUS-SMPL1→3-NPRED
“I made him/her cry.”

6 Conclusions

We have described the overt marking of informa-
tion structure and its pivotal role both in intersen-
tential cohesion in Aymara as well as coreference
resolution. Through an analysis of morphological
information structure marking with pragmatic suf-
fixes in this language, we illustrate the irrelevance
of word order for information structure. While
overt marking of referentiality is not always conse-
quent, nonpredictability is marked with strict regu-
larity. Having demonstrated that nonpredictability
can be marked both at clause level and inside a NP
and that focalizing suffixes tend to attract NPRED
morphology, we explained how underspecification
is resolved, noting, for example, that the overt ob-
ject of a NPRED-marked verb is also unpredictable
unless it is REF-marked. We also treated the iden-
tification of morphosyntactic, semantic and prag-
matic referents through a formalization of prag-
matics. The specifics of pragmatic marking in
complex predicates show how the NPRED-marker
typically attaches to the full verb thus supporting
the hypothesis that modal syntactic constructions
should be considered monoclausal.
