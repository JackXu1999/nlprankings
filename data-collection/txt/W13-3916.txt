Abstract
This paper presents an audio-based interaction technology that
lets the user have full control over her home environment and at
detecting distress situations for the elderly and frail population.
We introduce the PATSH framework which performs real-time
recognition of voice commands anywhere in the home and de-
tail its architecture and the state-of-the-art processing technolo-
gies it employs. This system was evaluated in a realistic Smart
Home with three user groups: seniors, visually impaired people
and people with no special needs. Results showed the valid-
ity of the PATSH approach and shed light on its usability for
people with special needs.

1. Introduction
Due to the demographic change and ageing in developed coun-
tries, the number of older persons is steadily increasing. In this
situation, the society must find solutions to allow these people
to live in their home as comfortably and safely as possible by
assisting them in their daily life. This concept, known as Ambi-
ent Assisted Living (AAL) aims at anticipating and responding
to the special needs of these persons. In this domain, the devel-
opment of Smart homes and intelligent companions is seen as a
promising way of achieving in-home daily assistance [1]. How-
ever, given the diverse profiles of the senior population (e.g.,
low/high technical skill, disabilities, etc.), complex interfaces
should be avoided. Nowadays, one of the best interfaces seems
to be the speech interface, that makes possible interaction using
natural language so that the user does not have to learn complex
computing procedures or jargon. Moreover, it is well adapted
to people with reduced mobility and to some emergency sit-
uations because the user doesn’t need to be close to a switch
(”hands free” system). Despite all this, very few Smart Home
projects have seriously considered speech recognition in their
design [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Part of this can be attributed to the
complexity of setting up this technology in a real environment
and to important challenges that still need to be overcome [9].

In order to make in home voice control a success and a
benefit for people with special needs, we argue that a complete
framework for audio analysis in Smart Home must be designed.
This framework should be able to provide real-time response,
to analyse concurrently several audio channels, to detect audio
events, to filter out noise and to perform robust distant speech

recognition. Furthermore, in contrast with current triggered-by-
button ASR systems commonly found in smart phone, this voice
control should be able to work in an “hand free” manner in case
the person is not able to move. Another important aspect is the
respect for privacy: the system should not disseminate any raw
personal data outside the home without the user’s consent. Our
approach, called PATSH is a step toward these goals. The orig-
inality of the approach is to consider these problems together
while they have mostly been studied separately.

To the best of our knowledge, the main trends in audio tech-
nology in Smart Homes are related to augmented human ma-
chine interaction (e.g., voice command, conversation) and se-
curity (mainly fall detection and distress situation recognition).
Regarding security, the main application is the fall detection us-
ing the signal of a wearable microphone which is often fused
with other modalities (e.g., accelerometer) [4, 3]. However, the
person is constrained to wear these sensors at all times. To ad-
dress this constraint, the dialogue system developed by [6] was
proposed to replace traditional emergency systems that requires
too much change in the lifestyle of the elders. However, the
prototype had a limited vocabulary (yes/no dialogue), was not
tested with aged users and there is no mention about how the
noise was taken into account. Most of the speech related re-
search or industrial projects in AAL are actual highly focused
on dialogue to build communicative agent (e.g., see the EU
funded Companions or CompanionAble projects or the Semvox
system 1). These systems are often composed of ASR, NLU,
Dialogue management and TTS parts supplying the user the
ability to communicate with the system in an interactive fash-
ion. However, it is generally the dialogue module (manage-
ment, modelling, architecture, personalization, etc.) that is the
main focus of these projects (e.g., see Companions, OwlSpeak
or Jaspis). Moreover, this setting is different from the Smart
Home one as the user must be close to the avatar to speak (i.e.,
not a distant speech setting). In [7], a communicative avatar was
designed to interact with a person in a smart office. In this re-
search, enhanced speech recognition is performed using beam-
forming and a geometric area of recording. But this promising
research is still to be tested in a multiroom and multisource re-
alistic home.

Designing and applying speech interfaces in Smart Home
to provide security reassurance and natural man-machine inter-
action is the aim of the SWEET-HOME2 project. With respect

to this short state-of-the-art, the project addresses the important
issues of distant voice command recognition and sound source
identification. The outcomes of this research are of high im-
portance to improve the robustness of the systems mentioned
above. In this paper, we introduce the PATSH system which
perform the real-time identification of the voice command any-
where in the home. Its architecture and the state-of-the-art pro-
cessing technologies employed are detailed in Section 2. This
system was evaluated in a realistic Smart Home with three user
groups: people with no special needs, seniors and, visually im-
paired people. These experiments are summarised in Section 3.
PATSH was used on-line (vs. off-line) during the experiment,
these results are analysed in Section 4. The paper finishes with
a short outlook of future work.

2. The Audio Analysis System
The SWEET-HOME system is composed of an Intelligent Con-
troller which analyses the streams of data and makes decision
based on these. This framework acquires data from sensors and
interprets them, by means of IA techniques, to provide contex-
tual information for decision making. The description of this
intelligent controller is out of the scope of the paper, the reader
is thus referred to [12] for further details. This system uses a
two-level ontology to represent the different concepts handled
during the processing which also contains SWRL instances to
automatise some of the reasoning. An important aspect is the
relationship between the knowledge representation and the de-
cision process which uses a dedicated Markov Logic Network
approach to benefit from the formal logical definition of deci-
sion rules as well as the ability to handle uncertain facts inferred
from real data. The location of the inhabitant was determined
by the intelligent controller that analysed continuously the data
stream of the smart-home (not only audio) and made decisions
based on the recognized voice commands and this contextual
information.

Therefore, the streams of data are composed of all the
usual home automation data sensors (switches, lights, blinds,
etc.), multimedia control (uPnP), and the audio events pro-
cessed in real-time by the multi-channel audio analysis sys-
tem: PATSH. Indeed, this section describes the overall archi-
tecture of PATSH, details the sound/speech discrimination and
the ASR part.

2.1. PATSH framework

The global architecture of PATSH is illustrated in Figure 1.
The PATSH framework is developed with the .Net cross plat-
form technology. The main data structure is the Sound object,
which contains a segment of the multidimensional audio signal
whose interpretation is continuously refined during the process-
ing pipeline. PATSH deals with the distribution of the data
among the several plugins that perform the processing to in-
terpret the audio events. The execution can be done, in paral-
lel, synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the settings
stored in a simple configuration file. In SWEET-HOME, the plu-
gins were actually developed in C or C++ and PATSH includes
the mechanism to transfer sound events from the plugins to the
PATSH framework and vice-versa.

In the SWEET-HOME configuration, PATSH runs plugins
that perform the following tasks:

1. Multichannel data Acquisition through the NI-
DAQ6220E card. Seven channels are acquired at 16kHz
(16 bits quantification);

2. Sound Detection and Extraction, detecting the start and
end of sound events on each channel in parallel;

3. Sound/Speech Discrimination, discriminating speech
from other sounds to extract voice commands;

4. Sound Classification, recognizing daily living sounds
(not developed in this paper, see [13] for details);

5. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applying speech
recognition to events classified as speech and extracting
vocal orders; and

6. Presentation, communicating the sound event to the In-
telligent Controller. If a vocal order is detected and ac-
cording to the context (activity and localisation of the
user in the flat), a home automation command is gener-
ated to make the light up, close the curtains or emit a
warning message thanks to a voice synthesizer.

The PATSH framework was developed to process on-line
sound objects continuously detected on the 7 audio channels.
However, it exists a bottleneck between the acquisition task and
the event processing task. Given that one sound event can be
simultaneously detected by several channels, the amount of the
sound events in the queue can quickly rise.

2.2. Sound Event Detection

The detection of the occurrence of an audio event is based on the
change of energy level of the 3 highest frequency coefficients
of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in a sliding window
frame (last 2048 samples without overlapping). Each time the
energy on a channel goes beyond a self-adaptive threshold, an
audio event is detected until the energy decrease below this level
for at least an imposed duration [2]. At the end of the detection,
the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is computed by dividing the
energy in the event interval and the previous energy in a window
outside this interval. This process is operated on each channel
independently.

2.3. Sound/Speech Discrimination

Once sound occurrences are detected, the most important task is
to distinguish speech from other sounds. In everyday life, there
is a large number of different sounds, modelling all of them is ir-
relevant. For the SWEET-HOME project, distant voice command
and distress situation detection, speech is the most important
sound class. The method used for speech/sound discrimination
is a GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) classification.

The Sound/Speech Discrimination stage has a very impor-
tant role: firstly, vocal orders must not be missed, secondly,
daily living sounds must not be sent to the ASR because unde-
sirable sentences could be recognized. To recognize only vocal
orders and not all sentences uttered in the flat, all sound events
shorter than 150 ms and longer than 2.2 seconds were ignored
as well as those whose SNR is below 0 dB. These values were
chosen after a statistical study on our data bases.

2.4. Voice order recognition

In a Smart Home, the microphones are generally set in the
ceiling and on the wall. This places the study in a distant-
speech context where microphones may be far from the speaker
and may record different noise sources. Moreover, the appli-
cation calls for quick decoding so that voice commands are
sent as soon as possible to the intelligent controller. This is
why we used the Speeral tool-kit [10] developed by the LIA

(Laboratoire d’Informatique d’Avignon). Indeed, its 1xRT con-
figuration allows a decoding time similar to the signal du-
ration. Speeral relies on an A∗ decoder with HMM-based
context-dependent acoustic models and trigram language mod-
els. HMMs are classical three-state left-right models and state
tying is achieved by using decision trees. Acoustic vectors are
composed of 12 PLP (Perceptual Linear Predictive) coefficients,
the energy, and the first and second order derivatives of these 13
parameters.

The acoustic models of the ASR system were trained on
about 80 hours of annotated speech. Furthermore, acoustic
models were adapted to the speech of 23 speakers recorded in
the same flat during previous experiments by using Maximum
Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) [8]. A 3-gram Language
Model (LM) with a 10K lexicon was used. It results from the
interpolation of a generic LM (weight 10%) and a domain LM
(weight 90%). The generic LM was estimated on about 1000M
of words from the French newspapers Le Monde and Gigaword.
The domain LM was trained on the sentences generated using
the grammar of the application (see Fig. 3). The LM combina-
tion biases the decoding towards the domain LM but still allows
decoding of out-of-domain sentences. A probabilistic model
was preferred over using strictly the grammar because it makes
it possible to use uncertain hypotheses in a fusion process for
more robustness.

3. Experiments in real conditions
3.1. Experimental flat

Experiments were run in the DOMUS smart home. Figure 2
shows the details of the flat. It is a thirty square meters suite
flat including a bathroom, a kitchen, a bedroom and a study, all
equipped with 150 (konnex) KNX sensors and actuators. The
flat has been equipped with 7 radio microphones set in the ceil-
ing for audio analysis. A specialized communication device,
e-lio, from the Technosens company was used to initiate a com-
munication between the user and a relative.

3.2. Voice orders

Possible voice orders were defined using a very simple gram-
mar as shown on Figure 3. Each order belongs to one of three
categories: initiate command, stop command and emergency
call. Except for the emergency call, every command starts with
a unique key-word that permits to know whether the person is

talking to the smart home or not. In the following, we will use
‘Nestor’ as key-word:

set an actuator on: (e.g. Nestor ferme fenêtre)
key initiateCommand object

stop an actuator: (e.g. Nestor arrête)
key stopCommand [object]

emergency call: (e.g. Nestor au secours)

The grammar was built after a user study that showed that
targeted users would prefer precise short sentences over more
natural long sentences [11]. In this study, although most of the
older people spontaneously controlled the home by uttering sen-
tences, the majority said they wanted to control the home using
keywords. They believe that this mode of interaction would be
the quickest and the most efficient. This study also showed that
they also had tendency to prefer or to accept the ‘tu’ form (in-
formal in French) to communicate with the system given this
system would be their property.

3.3. Scenarios and experiments

To validate the system in realistic conditions, we built scenarios
in which every participant was asked to perform the following
activities: (1) Sleeping; (2) Resting: listening to the radio; (3)
Feeding: preparing and having a meal; and (4) Communicating:
having a talk with a remote person thanks to e-lio. Therefore,
this experiment allowed us to process realistic and representa-
tive audio events in conditions which are directly linked to usual
daily living activities. Moreover, to evaluate the decision mak-
ing, some specific situations were planned in the scenarios. For
instance, for the decision regarding the activation of the light,

Figure 3: Excerpt of the grammar of the voice orders (terminal symbols are in French)

given that the bedroom had two lights (the ceiling and the bed-
side one) as well as the kitchen (above the dinning table and
above the sink), the four following situations were planed:

1. Situation 1. The person is having a meal on the kitchen
table. The most appropriate light is the one above the
table.

2. Situation 2. The person is cleaning up the bedroom. The
most appropriate light is the ceiling one.

3. Situation 3. The person is cleaning the sink and doing
the dishes. The most appropriate light is the one above
the sink.

4. Situation 4. The person has just finished a nap. The
most appropriate light is the bedside one.

Each participant had to use vocal orders to make the light
on or off, open or close blinds, ask about temperature and ask to
call his or her relative. The instruction was given to the partici-
pant to repeat the order up to 3 times in case of failure. In case
of, a wizard of Oz was used in case of persistent problem.

Sixteen participants (including 7 women) without special
needs were asked to perform the scenarios without condition on
the duration. A visit, before the experiment, was organized to
ensure that the participants will find all the items necessary to
perform the scenarios. It was necessary to explain the right way
to utter vocal orders and to use the e-lio system. Before the
experiment, the participant was asked to read a text of 25 short
sentences in order to adapt the acoustic models of the ASR for
future experiments. The average age of the participants was
38 years (19-62, min-max) and the experiment lasted between
23min and 48min. The scenario includes at least 15 vocal orders
for each participant but more sentences were uttered because of
repetitions.

3.4. Acquired Corpus

During the experiment, audio data were recorded and saved in
two ways. Firstly, the 7-channel raw audio signal was stored
for each participant to make subsequent analysis possible. In
total, 8h 52min 36s of data was recorded for the 16 participants.
Secondly, the individual sound events automatically detected by
PATSH were recorded to study the performances of this frame-
work.

Apart from daily living sounds and sentences uttered in the
flat by the participant, PATSH also detected the system mes-
sages (vocal synthesizer) and the e-lio communications. Over-
all, 4595 audio events were detected whose 993 were speech
and 3503 were other noise occurrences. The number of events

corresponding to each category –speech or everyday living
sound– is displayed Table 1.

In this study, we are only interested in recognizing vocal or-
ders or distress sentences. All other spontaneous sentences and
system messages are not irrelevant. Therefore, the global audio
records were annotated using Transcriber in order to extract the
syntactically correct vocal orders, results are shown in Table 2.
The average SNR and duration are 15.8dB and 1s, this SNR
value is low compared to studio conditions (SNR≥35dB). As
the home automation system needs only one correct sentence to
interact, only the less noisy channel was kept. The number of
vocal orders is different for each speaker because if a vocal or-
der was not correctly recognized, the requested action was not
operated by the intelligent controller (light on or off, curtains up
or down. . . ) and thus the speaker often uttered the order two or
three times. Thanks to this annotation, an oracle corpus was ex-
tracted. The comparison between experimental real-time results
with thus obtained with the same ASR on the oracle corpus will
allow to analyse the performance of the PATSH system.

4. Results
4.1. Discrimination between speech and sounds

The detection part of the system is not specifically evaluated
because of the lack of time to label all the sound events on
the 7 channels. However, all the results presented take into
account the performances of the detection because the signals
are extracted automatically by the system. The sound/speech
discrimination misclassified 108 sound and 232 speech occur-
rences which gives a total error rate of about 7.4% which is in
line with other results of the literature [13]. 23.4% of speech oc-
currences were classified as sound. Theses poor performances
are explained by the fact that PATSH was not successful in
selecting the best audio event among the set of simultaneous
events and thus the events with low SNR introduced errors and
were not properly discriminated. For the sounds, 3.1% of sound
occurencies are classified as speech. Sounds such as dishes, wa-
ter flow or electric motor were often confused with speech. For
instance, when certain persons stirred the coffee and chocked
the spoon on the cup or when they chocked plates and cutlery,
the emitted sounds had resonant frequencies very close to the
speech one. This is emphasizing the difficulty of the task and
models must be improved to handle these problematic samples.

4.2. Home automation order recognition

The global performance of the system is directly related to vo-
cal order recognition. The DER (Domotic Error Rate) is shown
in Table 3, the 2nd and 5th columns "Expe." indicates the re-
sults for the real-time experiment. This error rate is evaluated
after filtering at the input of the intelligent controller and in-
cludes the global effects of all stages: detection, discrimina-
tion between speech and sound, ASR. When the uttered voice
orders were not respecting the grammar, for example when a
sentence such as “Nestor heure” is uttered instead of the com-
mand “Nestor donne l’heure”, these utterances were discarded.
Moreover, some speakers’ utterances exceeded the 2.2s dura-
tion threshold because of their hesitation, therefore correspond-
ing vocal orders were not analysed and considered as missed.
In case of music in the room, vocal orders were often longer be-
cause of the mixing between speech and music. Consequently
future experiments will need to set the threshold to 2.5s and to
include a short training step to allow the participant to become
familiar with this technology.

The ASR system used generic acoustic models without
adaptation to the speaker and then regional or foreigner accent
may have an influence: it’s in particular the case for S10 (Ara-
bic) and S14 (Alsatian). The participants S07 and S15 show

low performance because they were not able to follow the given
instructions, the presence of large part of silence mixed with
noise between the words is analysed as phoneme and therefore
increases the error rate.

Part of the errors was due to the way PATSH managed si-
multaneous detections of one sound event. At this time of the
process, the SNR is not known with a sufficient precision and
the choice is not perfect. Then, in some cases, a part of the
speech signal is missed (beginning or end of the order) and this
introduces a bad recognition. Moreover, very often the detec-
tion is not perfectly simultaneous and more than one channel is
analysed by the ASR. Therefore, some improvement were intro-
duced in PATSH for future experiments: that consisted in mak-
ing the decision after the end of detection on the 7 threads (each
thread corresponding to one channel) thanks to a filtering win-
dow of 500ms. The disadvantage is that the system is slowed
down with a delay of 500ms but this will avoid the recognition
of bad extracted sentences and this is compensated by the anal-
ysis of only the signal of the best channel.

An important aspect is the decoding time because the de-
vice must be activated with a delay as short as possible. In this
experiment, the decoding times reached up to 4 seconds which
was a clear obstacle for usage in real condition. Hopeful, this
has been reduced.

5. Preliminary Results from experiments
with the aged and visually impaired

population
The method has also been applied in the same context but with
aged and visually impaired people. The aim was both to validate
the technology with this specific population and to perform a
user study to assess the adequacy of this technology with the
targeted users and to compare with the other user studies of the
literature [14, 11].

Between the two experiments, several corrections were ap-
plied to PATSH so that the sound/speech discrimination was
greatly improved as well as the speech decoding time. The mea-
sured decoding time was 1.47 times the sentence duration; as
the average duration of a vocal order was 1.048s, the delay be-
tween the end of the utterance and the execution of the order
was 1.55s. This is still not a satisfactory delay but this does not
prevent usage in real conditions.

5.1. Experimental set up

In this experiment, eleven participants either aged (6 women) or
visually impaired (2 women, 3 men) were recruited. The aver-
age age was 72 years (49-91, min-max). The aged persons were

103



fully autonomous but were living alone. The participants were
asked to perform 4 scenarios involving daily living activities
and distress or risky situations.

1. The participant is eating her breakfast and is preparing
to go out. She asked the house to turn on the light, close
the blinds or ask for the temperature while doing these
activities.

2. The participant is coming back from shopping and is go-
ing to have a nap. She asked the same kind of commands
but in this case, a warning situation alerts about the front
door not being locked.

3. The participant is going to the study to communicate
with one relative through the dedicated e-lio system. Af-
ter the communication, the participant simulates a sud-
den weakness and call for help.

4. The participant is waiting in the study for friends going
to visit her. She tests various voice orders with the radio,
lights and blinds.

During this experiment, 4 hours and 39 minutes of data was
collected including the same sensors as the one previously de-
scribed in Section 3.4.

5.2. First feedbacks

All the participants went through a questionnaire and a debrief-
ing after the experiment. We are still in the process of analysing
the results but overall, none of the aged or visually impaired
persons had any difficulty in performing the experiment. They
all appreciated to control the house by voice.

It is worth emphasizing that aged people preferred the man-
ual interaction because this was quicker. However, they liked
the voice warning in case of risky situations. Regarding the
visually impaired participants, they found that the voice com-
mand would be more adequate if it could enable performing
more complex or dangerous tasks than controlling blinds or ra-
dio. For instance, by enabling them to use the household appli-
ances. Overall, half of the participants found the system adapted
for their use.

6. Discussion
Overall, the performance of the system was still low but the
results showed there is room for improvement. Sound/Speech
discrimination has been improved since the beginning of the
experiment and continue to be improved. The biggest problems
were the response time which was unsatisfactory (for 6 partici-
pants out of 16) and the mis-understanding of the system which
implied to repeat the order (8/16). These technical limitations
were reduced when we improved the ASR memory manage-
ment and reduced the search space. After this improvement,
only one participant with special needs complained about the
response time. None of the encountered problem challenged
the PATSH architecture. That is why we are studying the pos-
sibility of releasing the code publicly.

The grammar was not the focus of the project but it has
been built to be easily adaptable at the word level (for instance,
if someone wants to change “Nestor” for another word). All
the 16 participants found the grammar easy to learn. Only four
of them found the keyword “Nestor” unnatural while the oth-
ers found it natural and funny. However, this approach suffers
a lack of natural adaptivity to the user’s preferences, capacities
and culture as any change would require technical intervention.

For instance, [15] emphasized that elder Germans tend to ut-
ter longer and politer commands than their fellow countrymen
which contrast with our findings. Despite longitudinal studies
are require to understand human preferences regarding voice or-
ders, methods to adapt on-line the grammar to the user must be
developed.

The acquired corpus made it possible to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the audio analysis software. But interest goes far be-
yond this experiment because it constitutes a precious resource
for future work. Indeed, one of the main problems that im-
pede researches in this domain is the need for a large amount
of annotated data (for analysis, machine learning and reference
for comparison). The acquisition of such datasets is highly ex-
pensive both in terms of material and of human resources. For
instance, in a previous experiment involving 21 participants in
the DOMUS smart home, the acquisition and the annotation of
a 33-hour corpus has cost approximatively 70ke. Thus, mak-
ing these datasets available to the research community is highly
desirable. This is why we are studying the possibility of mak-
ing part of it available to the society as we did in our previous
project [16].

7. Conclusion

This paper presents the PATSH system, the audio processing
module of the voice controlled SWEET-HOME system which
performs real-time identification of voice commands in the
home for assisted living. In this system, the identified sound
events are sent to an intelligent controller for final context-aware
decision about the action to make on the house [17]. The exper-
iments made in the Smart Home to evaluate the system showed
promising results and validate the approach. This technology
can benefit both the disabled and the elderly population that
have difficulties in moving or seeing and want security reas-
surance.

Our application of this technology within a realistic Smart
Home, showed that one of the most sensible tasks is the
speech/noise discrimination [9]. According to the SNR level,
the performance can be quite poor, which has side effects on
both the ASR and the sound classification (and then on the de-
cision making). Another issue is linked to the lack of handling
of simultaneous sound event records. These fill the sound ob-
ject queue, which is the system bottleneck, and thus slow down
the processing while real-time performances are required. To
increase the performance and free this bottleneck, we had im-
plemented a filtering strategy to remove low SNR audio events
as well as too delayed events. The preliminary results showed
a significant increase in performance. In a second step, PATSH
will be modified to allow in real-time a multisource ASR thanks
to the Driven Decoding Algorithm [18].

Although the participants had to repeat, sometimes up to
three times, the voice command, they were overall very ex-
cited about commanding their own home by voice. We are
still in the process of analysing the results of the experiment
which included seniors and visually impaired people to get es-
sential feedback from this targeted population. Future work
will include improvements of the speech recognition in noisy
environment and customisation of the grammar as well as ex-
periments using specialised communication devices to enhance
user’s communication capacity.
