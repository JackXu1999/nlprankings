Abstract
We propose a novel two-layered attention net-
work based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory for sentiment analysis. The novel
two-layered attention network takes advantage
of the external knowledge bases to improve the
sentiment prediction. It uses the Knowledge
Graph Embedding generated using the Word-
Net. We build our model by combining the
two-layered attention network with the super-
vised model based on Support Vector Regres-
sion using a Multilayer Perceptron network for
sentiment analysis. We evaluate our model on
the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2017 Task
5. Experimental results show that the proposed
model surpasses the top system of SemEval
2017 Task 5. The model performs significantly
better by improving the state-of-the-art system
at SemEval 2017 Task 5 by 1.7 and 3.7 points
for sub-tracks 1 and 2 respectively.

1 Introduction

With the rise of microblogging websites, people
have access and option to reach to the large crowd
using as few words as possible. Microblog and
news headlines are one of the common ways to
dispense information online. The dynamic nature
of these texts can be effectively used in the finan-
cial domain to track and predict the stock prices
(Goonatilake and Herath, 2007). These can be
used by an individual or an organization to make
an informed prediction related to any company or
stock (Si et al., 2013).

This gives rise to an interesting problem of sen-
timent analysis in financial domain. A study in-
dicates that sentiment analysis of public mood de-
rived from Twitter feeds can be used to eventu-
ally forecast movements of individual stock prices
(Smailović et al., 2014). An efficient system for
sentiment analysis is a core component of a com-
pany involved in financial stock market price pre-
diction.

Social media texts are prone to word shortening,
exaggeration, lack of grammar and appropriate
punctuations. Moreover, the word limit constraint
forces a user to limit their content and squeeze in
their opinion about companies. These inconsisten-
cies make it challenging to solve any natural lan-
guage processing tasks including sentiment analy-
sis (Khanarian and Alwarez-Melis, 2012).

Bag-of-words and named entities were used by
Schumaker and Chen (2009) for predicting stock
market. For predicting the explicit and implicit
sentiment in the financial text, de Kauter et al.
(2015) used a fine-grained sentiment annotation
scheme. Kumar et al. (2017) used a classical su-
pervised approach based on Support Vector Re-
gression for sentiment analysis in financial do-
main. Oliveira et al. (2013) relied on multiple
regression models. Akhtar et al. (2017) used
an ensemble of four different systems for pre-
dicting the sentiment. It used a combination of
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997), Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) (Kim, 2014) and Support Vector
Regression (SVR) (Smola and Schölkopf, 2004).
Yang et al. (2016) used a hierarchical attention net-
work to build the document representation incre-
mentally for document classification.

Our model focuses on interpretability and us-
age of knowledge bases. Knowledge bases have
been recognized important for natural language
understanding tasks (Minsky, 1986). Our main
contribution is a two-layered attention network
which utilizes background knowledge bases to
build good word level representation at the pri-
mary level. The secondary attention mechanism
works on top of the primary layer to build mean-
ingful sentence representations. This provides a
good intuitive working insight of the attention net-
work.

2 Proposed Methodology

We propose a two-layered attention network
which leverages external knowledge for sentiment
analysis. It consists of a bidirectional Long Short-
Term Memory (BiLSTM) (Graves et al., 2005)
based word encoder, word level attention mech-
anism for capturing the background knowledge
and a sentence level attention mechanism aimed
at grasping the context and the important words.
The output of the two-layered attention network
is then ensembled with the output of the feature
based SVR using the Multilayer perceptron based
approach described in Akhtar et al. (2017). The
overall ensembled system is shown in Figure 2.
Each of the components is explained in the fol-
lowing subsections and an overview of the two-
layered attention network is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Two-layered attention network

2.1 Two Layered Attention Model

2.1.1 BiLSTM based word encoder
A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a special
kind of Recurrent Neural Network. It handles the
long-term dependencies where the current output
is dependent on many prior inputs. BiLSTM, in
essence, is a combination of two different LSTM
- one working in forward and the other working in
the backward direction. The contextual informa-
tion about both past and future helps in determin-
ing the current output.

The two hidden states
−→
ht and

←−
ht for forward and

backward LSTM are the information about past
and future respectively at any time step t. Their
concatenation ht = [

−→
ht ,
←−
ht] provides complete in-

formation. Each word of the sentence is fed to the
network in form of word embeddings which are
encoded using the BiLSTM.

2.1.2 Word Level Attention
External knowledge in form of Knowledge Graph
Embedding (Yang et al., 2015) or top-k simi-
lar words are captured by using the word level
attention mechanism. This serves the purpose
of primary attention which leverages the external
knowledge to get the best representation for each
word. At each time step we get V(xt) relevant
terms of each input xt with vi being the embed-
ding for each term. (Relevant terms and embed-
dings are described in next section). The primary
attention mechanism assigns an attention coeffi-
cient to each of relevant term having index i ∈
V(xt):

αti ∝ hTt Wvvi (1)
where Wv is a parameter matrix to be learned.

mt =
∑

i∈V (xt)
αtivi (2)

ĥt = mt + ht (3)

The knowledge aware vector (mt) is calculated
as Equation 2, which is concatenated with the hid-
den state vector to get the final vector representa-
tion for each word.

2.1.3 Sentence Level Attention
The secondary attention mechanism captures im-
portant words in a sentence with the help of con-
text vectors. Each final vector representing the
words is assigned a weight indicating its relative
importance with respect to other words. The at-
tention coefficient αt for each final vector repre-
sentation is calculated as:

αt ∝ ĥTt Wsus (4)

H =
∑

t

αtĥt (5)

where Ws is a parameter matrix and us is the con-
text vector to be learned. H is finally fed to a one
layer feed forward neural network.

2.2 Relevant Terms and Embeddings
External knowledge can provide explicit infor-
mation for the model which the training data
lacks. This helps the model to make better pre-
dictions. We relied on Knowledge Graph Embed-
dings based on WordNet and Distributional The-
saurus to get relevant terms and their correspond-
ing embeddings for each word in the text.

2.2.1 Knowledge Graph Embedding
WordNet1 is a lexical database which contains
triplets in the form of (subject, relation, object).
Both subject and object are synsets in WordNet.
Each word in the text serves as the subject of the
triplet. The relevant terms for the current word
are the triplets having the current word as the sub-
ject. We then employ Knowledge Graph Embed-
dings to learn the representation of the triplet. A
100-dimensional dense vector representation for
each subject, relation and object were learned us-
ing the DistMult approach (Yang et al., 2015) and
concatenated. These served as the relevant em-
beddings. An example of triplet in WordNet is
(bronze age, part of, prehistory).

2.2.2 Distributional Thesaurus
Distributional Thesaurus (DT) (Biemann and
Riedl, 2013) is an automatically computed word
list which ranks words according to their seman-
tic similarity. We use a pre-trained DT to expand
a current word. For each current word, top-4 tar-
get words are found which are the relevant terms.
The relevant embeddings are obtained by using a
300-dimensional pre-trained Word2Vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)
model. An example of the DT expansion of the
word ’touchpad’ is mouse, trackball, joystick and
trackpad.

2.3 Feature Based Model - SVR
The following hand-crafted features are extracted
and used to train a Support Vector Regression
(SVR).
- Tf-Idf: Term frequency-inverse document fre-
quency (Tf-Idf) reflects the importance of each
word in a document. We use Tf-Idf score as a fea-
ture value for each word.
- Lexicon Features: Sentiment lexicons are an
important resource for sentiment analysis. We em-
ploy the following lexicons: Bing Liu opinion lex-
icon (Ding et al., 2008) and MPQA subjectivity

1https://wordnet.princeton.edu

lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), SentiWordNet (Bac-
cianella et al., 2010) and Vader sentiment (Gilbert,
2014). From the above lexicons we extracted the
agreement score (Rao and Srivastava, 2012) and
the count of the number of occurrences of all pos-
itive and negative words in the text.
- Word embedding: We use the 300-dimensional
pre-trained Word2Vec and GloVe embedding. The
sentence embedding was obtained by concatenat-
ing the embedding for all words in the sentence.

3 Experiments

3.1 Dataset

We evaluate our proposed approach for sentiment
analysis on the benchmark datasets of SemEval-
2017 shared task 5. The task ’Fine-Grained Senti-
ment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News’
(Keith Cortis and Davis, 2017) had two sub-tracks.
Track 1 - ’Microblog Messages’ had 1,700 and
800 train and test instances respectively. Track 2
- ’News Statements & Headlines’ had 1,142 and
491 train and test instances respectively. The task
was to predict a regression score in between -1 and
1 indicating the sentiment with -1 being negative
and +1 being positive.

3.2 Implementation Details

We implement our model using Tensorflow and
Scikit-learn on a single GPU. We use a single layer
BiLSTM with the two-layered attention mecha-
nism followed by a one layer feed forward neural
network. The number of units in each LSTM cell
of the BiLSTM was 150. The batch size was 64
and the dropout was 0.3 (Srivastava et al., 2014)
with the Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) optimizer.
The length of context vector in the secondary at-
tention network was 300. For each experiment,
we report the average of five random runs. Cosine
similarity is a measure of similarity. It represents
the degree of agreement between the predicted and
gold values. Cosine similarity was used for evalu-
ation as per the guideline.

3.3 Results
We compare our system with the state-of-the-art
systems of SemEval 2017 Task 5 and the system
proposed by Akhtar et al. (2017). Table 1 shows
evaluation of our various models. Team ECNU
(Lan et al., 2017) and Fortia-FBK (Mansar et al.,
2017) were the top systems for sub-tracks 1 and
2 respectively. Team ECNU and Fortia-FBK re-
ported a cosine similarity of 0.777 and 0.745 for
sub-tracks 1 and 2 respectively. Team ECNU em-
ployed a number of systems - Support Vector Re-
gression, XGBoost Regressor, AdaBoost Regres-
sor and Bagging Regressor ensembled together.
Team Fortia-FBK used a Convolutional Neural
Network for this task. The system proposed by
Akhtar et al. utilizes an ensemble of LSTM, GRU,
CNN and a SVR and reported a cosine similarity
of 0.797 and 0.786 for the two sub-tracks.

Our proposed system has a cosine similarity
of 0.794 and 0.782 for sub-tracks 1 and 2 re-
spectively. The proposed system performs signif-
icantly better than top systems of SemEval 2017
Task 5 for both the tasks. Moreover, the sys-
tem performs at par with the system proposed by
Akhtar et al. with half the number of subsystems
involved in the ensemble. This shows that our pro-
posed system is not only robust since it performs
for both the task equally well but also powerful as
it involves fewer subcomponents while having the
same expressive power.

The two-layered attention network alone per-
forms better than the best system of SemEval 2017
Task for both the sub-track. It manages to achieve
much higher score than any of the deep learn-
ing component utilized by the system proposed by
Akhtar et al. (2017) as shown in Table 2. This
shows that the two-layered attention network helps
to reduce overall model complexity without com-
promising the performance.

3.4 Error Analysis

We performed error analysis and observed that the
proposed system faces difficulty at times. Follow-
ing are the situations when the system failed and
incorrectly predicted values of the opposite polar-
ity:
• Sometimes the system fails to identify an inten-
sifier. In the example below, ’pure’ is used as an
intensifier.
Text : Pure garbage stock
Actual: -0.946 Predicted: 0.042
• The system fails when it does not have enough
real-world information. In the example below, a
low share price is a good opportunity to buy for
an individual but from a company’s point of view,
a low share price does not indicate a prosperous
situation.
Text : Good opportunity to buy
Actual: -0.771 Predicted: 0.260

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an ensemble of a novel
two-layered attention network and a classical su-
pervised Support Vector Regression for sentiment
analysis. The two-layered attention network has
an intuitive working. It builds the representa-
tion hierarchically from word to sentence level uti-
lizing the knowledge bases. The proposed sys-
tem performed remarkably well on the benchmark
datasets of SemEval 2017 Task 5. It outperformed
the existing top systems for both the sub-tracks
comfortably. Experimental results demonstrate
that the system improves the state-of-the-art sys-
tem of SemEval 2017 Task 5 by 1.7 and 3.7 points
for sub-tracks 1 and 2 respectively. This robust
system can be effectively used as a submodule in
an end-to-end stock market price prediction sys-
tem.
