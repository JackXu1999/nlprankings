Abstract

Text summarization aims at compressing long
documents into a shorter form that conveys
the most important parts of the original docu-
ment. Despite increased interest in the com-
munity and notable research effort, progress
on benchmark datasets has stagnated. We crit-
ically evaluate key ingredients of the current
research setup: datasets, evaluation metrics,
and models, and highlight three primary short-
comings: 1) automatically collected datasets
leave the task underconstrained and may con-
tain noise detrimental to training and evalua-
tion, 2) current evaluation protocol is weakly
correlated with human judgment and does not
account for important characteristics such as
factual correctness, 3) models overfit to layout
biases of current datasets and offer limited di-
versity in their outputs.

1 Introduction

Text summarization aims at compressing long tex-
tual documents into a short, human readable form
that contains the most important information from
the source. Two strategies of generating sum-
maries are extractive (Dorr et al., 2003; Nallapati
et al., 2017), where salient fragments of the source
document are identified and directly copied into
the summary, and abstractive (Rush et al., 2015;
See et al., 2017), where the salient parts are de-
tected and paraphrased to form the final output.

The number of summarization models intro-
duced every year has been increasing rapidly.
Advancements in neural network architec-
tures (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al.,
2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017)
and the availability of large scale data (Sandhaus,
2008; Nallapati et al., 2016a; Grusky et al., 2018)
enabled the transition from systems based on
expert knowledge and heuristics to data-driven
approaches powered by end-to-end deep neural

models. Current approaches to text summa-
rization utilize advanced attention and copying
mechanisms (See et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2017;
Cohan et al., 2018), multi-task and multi-reward
training techniques (Guo et al., 2018; Pasunuru
and Bansal, 2018; Kryściński et al., 2018), rein-
forcement learning strategies (Paulus et al., 2017;
Narayan et al., 2018b; Dong et al., 2018; Wu
and Hu, 2018), and hybrid extractive-abstractive
models (Liu et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2018;
Gehrmann et al., 2018; Chen and Bansal, 2018).
Many of the introduced models are trained on the
CNN/DailyMail (Nallapati et al., 2016a) news
corpus, a popular benchmark for the field, and are
evaluated based on n-gram overlap between the
generated and target summaries with the ROUGE
package (Lin, 2004).

Despite substantial research effort, the progress
on these benchmarks has stagnated. State-of-the-
art models only slightly outperform the Lead-3
baseline, which generates summaries by extract-
ing the first three sentences of the source doc-
ument. We argue that this stagnation can be
partially attributed to the current research setup,
which involves uncurated, automatically collected
datasets and non-informative evaluations proto-
cols. We critically evaluate our hypothesis, and
support our claims by analyzing three key compo-
nents of the experimental setting: datasets, evalua-
tion metrics, and model outputs. Our motivation is
to shift the focus of the research community into
developing a more robust research setup for text
summarization.

2 Related Work

2.1 Datasets

To accommodate the requirements of mod-
ern data-driven approaches, several large-scale
datasets have been proposed. The majority of



541

available corpora come from the news domain. Gi-
gaword (Graff and Cieri, 2003) is a set of arti-
cles and corresponding titles that was originally
used for headline generation (Takase et al., 2016),
but it has also been adapted to single-sentence
summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al.,
2016). NYT (Sandhaus, 2008) is a collection of ar-
ticles from the New York Times magazine with ab-
stracts written by library scientists. It has been pri-
marily used for extractive summarization (Hong
and Nenkova, 2014; Li et al., 2016) and phrase-
importance prediction (Yang and Nenkova, 2014;
Nye and Nenkova, 2015). The CNN/DailyMail
(Nallapati et al., 2016a) dataset consists of ar-
ticles with summaries composed of highlights
from the article written by the authors themselves.
It is commonly used for both abstractive (See
et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2017; Kryściński et al.,
2018) and extractive (Dong et al., 2018; Wu and
Hu, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) neural summariza-
tion. The collection was originally introduced
as a Cloze-style QA dataset by Hermann et al.
(2015). XSum (Narayan et al., 2018a) is a col-
lection of articles associated with one, single-
sentence summary targeted at abstractive models.
Newsroom (Grusky et al., 2018) is a diverse col-
lection of articles sourced from 38 major online
news outlets. This dataset was released together
with a leaderboard and held-out testing split.

Outside of the news domain, several datasets
were collected from open discussion boards and
other portals offering structure information. Red-
dit TIFU (Kim et al., 2018) is a collection of
posts scraped from Reddit where users post their
daily stories and each post is required to contain a
Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR) summary. Wiki-
How (Koupaee and Wang, 2018) is a collection of
articles from the WikiHow knowledge base, where
each article contains instructions for performing
procedural, multi-step tasks covering various ar-
eas, including: arts, finance, travel, and health.

2.2 Evaluation Metrics

Manual and semi-automatic (Nenkova and Pas-
sonneau, 2004; Passonneau et al., 2013) evaluation
of large-scale summarization models is costly and
cumbersome. Much effort has been made to de-
velop automatic metrics that would allow for fast
and cheap evaluation of models.

The ROUGE package (Lin, 2004) offers a set
of automatic metrics based on the lexical over-

lap between candidate and reference summaries.
Overlap can be computed between consecutive
(n-grams) and non-consecutive (skip-grams) sub-
sequences of tokens. ROUGE scores are based
on exact token matches, meaning that computing
overlap between synonymous phrases is not sup-
ported.

Many approaches have extended ROUGE with
support for synonyms and paraphrasing. ParaE-
val (Zhou et al., 2006) uses a three-step compari-
son strategy, where the first two steps perform op-
timal and greedy paraphrase matching based on
paraphrase tables before reverting to exact token
overlap. ROUGE-WE (Ng and Abrecht, 2015) re-
places exact lexical matches with a soft seman-
tic similarity measure approximated with the co-
sine distances between distributed representations
of tokens. ROUGE 2.0 (Ganesan, 2018) leverages
synonym dictionaries, such as WordNet, and con-
siders all synonyms of matched words when com-
puting token overlap. ROUGE-G (ShafieiBavani
et al., 2018) combines lexical and semantic match-
ing by applying graph analysis algorithms to the
WordNet semantic network. Despite being a step
in the direction of a more comprehensive evalu-
ation protocol, none of these metrics gained suf-
ficient traction in the research community, leav-
ing ROUGE as the default automatic evaluation
toolkit for text summarization.

2.3 Models

Existing summarization models fall into three cat-
egories: abstractive, extractive, and hybrid.

Extractive models select spans of text from
the input and copy them directly into the sum-
mary. Non-neural approaches (Neto et al., 2002;
Dorr et al., 2003; Filippova and Altun, 2013; Col-
menares et al., 2015) utilized domain expertise
to develop heuristics for summary content selec-
tion, whereas more recent, neural techniques al-
low for end-to-end training. In the most common
case, models are trained as word- or sentence-
level classifiers that predict whether a fragment
should be included in the summary (Nallapati
et al., 2016b, 2017; Narayan et al., 2017; Liu et al.,
2019; Xu and Durrett, 2019). Other approaches
apply reinforcement learning training strategies to
directly optimize the model on task-specific, non-
differentiable reward functions (Narayan et al.,
2018b; Dong et al., 2018; Wu and Hu, 2018) .

Abstractive models paraphrase the source doc-



542

uments and create summaries with novel phrases
not present in the source document. A com-
mon approach in abstractive summarization is to
use attention and copying mechanisms (See et al.,
2017; Tan et al., 2017; Cohan et al., 2018). Other
approaches include using multi-task and multi-
reward training (Paulus et al., 2017; Jiang and
Bansal, 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Pasunuru and
Bansal, 2018; Kryściński et al., 2018), and unsu-
pervised training strategies (Chu and Liu, 2018;
Schumann, 2018).

Hybrid models (Hsu et al., 2018; Liu et al.,
2018; Gehrmann et al., 2018; Chen and Bansal,
2018) include both extractive and abstractive
modules and allow to separate the summarization
process into two phases – content selection and
paraphrasing.

For the sake of brevity we do not describe de-
tails of different models, we refer interested read-
ers to the original papers.

2.4 Analysis and Critique

Most summarization research revolves around
new architectures and training strategies that im-
prove the state of the art on benchmark problems.
However, it is also important to analyze and ques-
tion the current methods and research settings.

Zhang et al. (2018) conducted a quantitative
study of the level of abstraction in abstractive
summarization models and showed that word-
level, copy-only extractive models achieve com-
parable results to fully abstractive models in the
measured dimension. Kedzie et al. (2018) offered
a thorough analysis of how neural models perform
content selection across different data domains,
and exposed data biases that dominate the learn-
ing signal in the news domain and architectural
limitations of current approaches in learning ro-
bust sentence-level representations. Liu and Liu
(2010) examine the correlation between ROUGE
scores and human judgments when evaluating
meeting summarization data and show that the
correlation strength is low, but can be improved
by leveraging unique meeting characteristics, such
as available speaker information. Owczarzak
et al. (2012) inspect how inconsistencies in hu-
man annotator judgments affect the ranking of
summaries and correlations with automatic eval-
uation metrics. The results showed that system-
level rankings, considering all summaries, were
stable despite inconsistencies in judgments, how-

ever, summary-level rankings and automatic met-
ric correlations benefit from improving annotator
consistency. Graham (2015) compare the fitness
of the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) and a
number of different ROUGE variants for evaluat-
ing summarization outputs. The study reveals su-
perior variants of ROUGE that are different from
the commonly used recommendations and shows
that the BLEU metric achieves strong correlations
with human assessments of generated summaries.
Schulman et al. (2015) study the problems related
to using ROUGE as an evaluation metric with
respect to finding optimal solutions and provide
proof of NP-hardness of global optimization with
respect to ROUGE.

Similar lines of research, where the authors put
under scrutiny existing methodologies, datasets, or
models were conducted by Callison-Burch et al.
(2006, 2007); Tan et al. (2015); Post (2018) in ma-
chine translation, (Gkatzia and Mahamood, 2015;
Reiter and Belz, 2009; Reiter, 2018) in natu-
ral language generation, Lee et al. (2016); Chen
et al. (2016); Kaushik and Lipton (2018) in read-
ing comprehension, Gururangan et al. (2018); Po-
liak et al. (2018); Glockner et al. (2018) in natu-
ral language inference, Goyal et al. (2017) in vi-
sual question answering, and Xian et al. (2017)
in zero-shot image classification. Comments on
the general state of scholarship in the field of ma-
chine learning were presented by Sculley et al.
(2018); Lipton and Steinhardt (2019) and refer-
ences therein.

3 Datasets

3.1 Underconstrained task
The task of summarization is to compress long
documents by identifying and extracting the most
important information from the source documents.
However, assessing the importance of information
is a difficult task in itself, that highly depends on
the expectations and prior knowledge of the target
reader.

We show that the current setting in which mod-
els are simply given a document with one associ-
ated reference summary and no additional infor-
mation, leaves the task of summarization under-
constrained and thus too ambiguous to be solved
by end-to-end models.

To quantify this effect, we conducted a human
study which measured the agreement between dif-
ferent annotators in selecting important sentences

raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby’s employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is
Yankee hall-of-famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw
its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000
to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby’s auction Wednesday. The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted ’a new generation
to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.’, The letters had beamed from atop Yankee stadium near grand
concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. (...)

There was not a single buyer at the auction at Sotheby’s

The once iconic and attractive pack of 13 letters that was

from a fragment of text. We asked workers to write
summaries of news articles and highlight sen-
tences from the source documents that they based
their summaries on. The experiment was con-
ducted in two settings: unconstrained, where the
annotators were instructed to summarize the con-
tent that they considered most important, and con-
strained, where annotators were instructed to write
summaries that would contain answers to three
questions associated with each article. This is sim-
ilar to the construction of the TAC 2008 Opin-
ion Summarization Task 1. The questions associ-
ated with each article where collected from human
workers through a separate assignment. Experi-
ments were conducted on 100 randomly sampled
articles, further details of the human study can be
found in Appendix A.1.

Table 2 shows the average number of sentences,
per-article, that annotators agreed were important.

The rows show how the average changes with the
human vote threshold needed to reach consensus
about the importance of any sentence. For exam-
ple, if we require that three or more human votes
are necessary to consider a sentence important, an-
notators agreed on average on the importance of
0.627 and 1.392 sentences per article in the un-
constrained and constrained settings respectively.
The average length (in sentences) of sampled arti-
cles was 16.59, with a standard deviation of 5.39.
The study demonstrates the difficulty and ambigu-
ity of content selection in text summarization.

We also conducted a qualitative study of sum-
maries written by annotators. Examples compar-
ing summaries written in the constrained and un-
constrained setting are shown in Table 1. We no-
ticed that in both cases the annotators correctly
identified the main topic and important fragments
of the source article. However, constrained sum-
maries were more succinct and targeted, with-
out sacrificing the natural flow of sentences. Un-

constrained writers tended to write more verbose
summaries that did not add information. The study
also highlights the abstractive nature of human
written summaries in that similar content can be
described in unique ways.

3.2 Layout bias in news data

Figure 1: The distribution of important sentences over
the length of the article according to human annotators
(blue) and its cumulative distribution (red).

News articles adhere to a writing structure
known in journalism as the ”Inverted Pyra-
mid” (PurdueOWL, 2019). In this form, initial
paragraphs contain the most newsworthy informa-
tion, which is followed by details and background
information.

To quantify how strongly articles in the
CNN/DM corpus follow this pattern we conducted
a human study that measured the importance of
different sections of the article. Annotators read
news articles and selected sentences they found

most important. Experiments were conducted on
100 randomly sampled articles, further details of
the human study are described in Appendix A.3.
Figure 1 presents how annotator selections were
distributed over the length of the article. The
distribution is skewed towards the first quarter of
the length of articles. The cumulative plot shows
that nearly 60% of the important information was
present in the first third of the article, and approxi-
mately 25% and 15% of selections pointing to the
second and last third, respectively.

It has become standard practice to exploit such
biases during training to increase performance of
models (See et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2017;
Kryściński et al., 2018; Gehrmann et al., 2018;
Jiang and Bansal, 2018; Pasunuru and Bansal,
2018), but the importance of these heuristics has
been accepted without being quantified. These
same heuristics would not apply to books or legal
documents, which lack the Inverted Pyramid lay-
out so common in the news domain, so it is impor-
tant that these heuristics be part of ablation stud-
ies rather than accepted as default pre-processing
step.

3.3 Noise in scraped datasets

Given the data requirements of deep neural net-
works and the vast amounts of diverse resources
available online, automatically scraping web con-
tent is a convenient way of collecting data for new
corpora. However, adapting scraped content to the
needs of end-to-end models is problematic. Given
that manual inspection of data is infeasible and hu-
man annotators are expensive, data curation is usu-
ally limited to removing any markup structure and
applying simple heuristics to discard obviously
flawed examples. This, in turn, makes the quality
of the datasets heavily dependent on how well the
scraped content adheres to the assumptions made
by the authors about its underlying structure.

This issue suggests that available summariza-
tion datasets would be filled with noisy examples.
Manual inspection of the data, particularly the ref-
erence summaries, revealed easily detectable, con-
sistent patterns of flawed examples Many such ex-
amples can be isolated using simple regular ex-
pressions and heuristics, which allows approxi-
mation of how widespread these flaws are in the
dataset.

We investigated this issue in two large sum-
marization corpora scraped from the internet:

4 Evaluation Metrics

4.1 Weak correlation with human judgment
The effectiveness of ROUGE was previously eval-
uated (Lin, 2004; Graham, 2015) through statisti-
cal correlations with human judgment on the DUC
datasets (Over and Yen, 2001, 2002, 2003). How-
ever, their setting was substantially different from
the current environment in which summarization
models are developed and evaluated.

To investigate the robustness of ROUGE in the

setting in which it is currently used, we evaluate
how its scores correlate with the judgment of an
average English-speaker using examples from the
CNN/DM dataset. Following the human evalu-
ation protocol from Gehrmann et al. (2018), we
asked annotators to rate summaries across four di-
mensions: relevance (selection of important con-
tent from the source), consistency (factual align-
ment between the summary and the source), flu-
ency (quality of individual sentences), and coher-
ence (collective quality of all sentences). Each
summary was rated by 5 distinct judges with the
final score obtained by averaging the individual
scores. Experiments were conducted on 100 ran-
domly sampled articles with the outputs of 13
summarization systems provided by the original
authors. Correlations were computed between
all pairs of Human-, ROUGE-scores, for all sys-
tems. Additional summaries were collected from
annotators to inspect the effect of using multiple
ground-truth labels on the correlation with auto-
matic metrics. Further details of the human study
can be found in Appendix A.2.

Results are shown in Table 5. The left section
of the table presents Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cients and the right section presents Kendall rank
correlation coefficients. In terms of Pearsons’s co-
efficients, the study showed minimal correlation
with any of the annotated dimensions for both ab-
stractive and extractive models together and for
abstractive models individually. Weak correla-
tion was discovered for extractive models primar-
ily with the fluency and coherence dimensions.

We hypothesized that the noise contained in the
fine-grained scores generated by both human an-
notators and ROUGE might have affected the cor-
relation scores. We evaluated the relation on a
higher level of granularity by means of correlation
between rankings of models that were obtained
from the fine-grained scores. The study showed
weak correlation with all measured dimensions,
when evaluated for both abstractive and extractive
models together and for abstractive models indi-
vidually. Moderate correlation was found for ex-
tractive models across all dimensions. A surpris-
ing result was that correlations grew weaker with
the increase of ground truth references.

Our results align with the observations from Liu
and Liu (2010) who also evaluated ROUGE out-
side of its original setting. The study highlights the
limited utility in measuring progress of the field

solely by means of ROUGE scores.

4.2 Insufficient evaluation protocol
The goal of text summarization is to automati-
cally generate succinct, fluent, relevant, and fac-
tually consistent summaries. The current evalua-
tion protocol depends primarily on the exact lexi-
cal overlap between reference and candidate sum-
maries measured by ROUGE. In certain cases,
ROUGE scores are complemented with human
studies where annotators rate the relevance and
fluency of generated summaries. Neither of the
methods explicitly examines the factual consis-
tency of summaries, leaving this important dimen-
sion unchecked.

To evaluate the factual consistency of existing
models, we manually inspected randomly sam-
pled articles with summaries coming from ran-
domly chosen, abstractive models. We focused
exclusively on factual incorrectness and ignored
any other issues, such as low fluency. Out of 200
article-summary pairs that were reviewed manu-
ally, we found that 60 (30%) contained consis-
tency issues. Table 4 shows examples of dis-
covered inconsistencies. Some of the discovered
inconsistencies, despite being factually incorrect,
could be rationalized by humans. However, in
many cases, the errors were substantial and could
have severe repercussions if presented as-is to tar-
get readers.

5 Models

5.1 Layout bias in news data
We revisit the problem of layout bias in news data
from the perspective of models. Kedzie et al.

(2018) showed that in the case of news articles,
the layout bias dominates the learning signal for
neural models. In this section, we approximate
the degree with which generated summaries rely
on the leading sentences of news articles.

We computed ROUGE scores for collected
models in two settings: first using the CNN/DM
reference summaries as the ground-truth, and sec-
ond where the leading three sentences of the
source article were used as the ground-truth, i.e.
the Lead-3 baseline. We present the results in Ta-
ble 6.

For all examined models we noticed a substan-
tial increase of overlap across all ROUGE variants.
Results suggest that performance of current mod-
els is strongly affected by the layout bias of news
corpora. Lead-3 is a strong baseline that exploits
the described layout bias. However, there is still
a large gap between its performance and an upper
bound for extractive models (extractive oracle).

5.2 Diversity of model outputs
Models analyzed in this paper are considerably
different from each other in terms of architectures,
training strategies, and underlying approaches.
We inspected how the diversity in approaches
translates into the diversity of model outputs.

We computed ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-4 scores
between pairs of model outputs to compare them
by means of token and phrase overlap. Results are
visualized in Figure 2, where the values above and
below the diagonal are ROUGE-1 and -4 scores
accordingly, and model names (M-) follow the or-
der from Table 6.

Table 6: ROUGE (R-) scores computed for different models on the test set of the CNN/DM dataset. Left: Scores
computed with the original reference summaries. Right: Scores computed with Lead-3 used as the reference.

We notice that the ROUGE-1 scores vary con-
siderably less than ROUGE-4 scores. This sug-
gests that the models share a large part of the vo-
cabulary on the token level, but differ on how they
organize the tokens into longer phrases.

Comparing results with the n-gram overlap be-
tween models and reference summaries (Table 6)
shows a substantially higher overlap between any
model pair than between the models and reference
summaries. This might imply that the training data
contains easy to pick up patterns that all models
overfit to, or that the information in the training
signal is too weak to connect the content of the
source articles with the reference summaries.

6 Conclusions

This critique has highlighted the weak points of
the current research setup in text summarization.
We showed that text summarization datasets re-
quire additional constraints to have well-formed
summaries, current state-of-the-art methods learn
to rely too heavily on layout bias associated with
the particular domain of the text being summa-
rized, and the current evaluation protocol reflects
human judgments only weakly while also failing
to evaluate critical features (e.g. factual correct-
ness) of text summarization.

We hope that this critique provides the summa-
rization community with practical insights for fu-
ture research directions that include the construc-
tion of datasets, models less fit to a particular do-

main bias, and evaluation that goes beyond current
metrics to capture the most important features of
summarization.
