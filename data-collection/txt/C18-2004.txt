Abstract 

T-Know is a knowledge service system based on the constructed knowledge graph of Tradi-

tional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Using authorized and anonymized clinical records, medicine 

clinical guidelines, teaching materials, classic medical books, academic publications, etc., as 

data resources, the system extracts triples from free texts to build a TCM knowledge graph by 

our developed natural language processing methods. On the basis of the knowledge graph, a 

deep learning algorithm is implemented for single-round question understanding and multiple-

round dialogue. In addition, the TCM knowledge graph also is used to support human-computer 

interactive knowledge retrieval by normalizing search keywords to medical terminology. 

1 Introduction 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of precious intangible cultural heritages of the Chinese 

nation. After thousands of years of development, it has been evolved as a distinct and unique theoretical 

medical system. Compared with disease treatment only, TCM pays more attention to living conditions 

and advocates timely adjustment of diet and rest to deal with physical discomforts. This philosophy has 

an advantage in dealing with sub-health status and chronic disease management (Wang, et al., 2007). 

With the increasing attention of health from public, the demands of reliable and convenient TCM 

knowledge services are increasing. 

In recent years, there are great progresses being made in domain-specific knowledge graph construc-

tion. On TCM, a number of literature databases have been established. These digital resources contain-

ing rich TCM knowledge can be utilized to capture knowledge elements to serve public and benefit 

health management (Gao, et al., 2012). There are several existing TCM knowledge service platforms, 

such as TCMKS (Yu, et al., 2014). However, most of the systems target for medical professionals rather 

than public. A typical situation is that, their search functions allow formal TCM terms only, causing 

common users without TCM background difficulties to obtain required information without rich TCM 

background. Therefore, how to utilizing natural language methods to analyze informal or even vague 

queries for more convenient public services is an essential issue (Xu, et al., 2016).  

To that end, we propose the T-Know, a user-friendly knowledge service system based on a TCM 

knowledge graph. The overall system architecture is shown as Figure 1.The system has two major mod-

ules: a question answering module and a knowledge retrieval module. The TCM knowledge graph inte-

grates diversified data to enrich knowledge search and usage. The question answering module utilizes 

deep learning models to understand questions by analyzing question intents. The question answering 

module provides an interface for common users in both single-round question answering and multi-

round dialogue ways. The knowledge retrieval module integrates TCM terminology and synonym dic-

tionaries to extend search keywords semantically. The module can also navigate common users to use 

the TCM knowledge retrieval in an interactive way.

2 The TCM Knowledge Graph 

In order to construct the TCM knowledge graph, authorized and anonymized clinical records, clinical 

guidelines, teaching materials, classic medical books, and academic publications are collected as data 

resources. The unstructured texts were preprocessed including Chinese word segmentation, stop word 

removal and word semantic labelling. After that, medical named entity recognition and relation extrac-

tion were implemented using a Bi-LSTM+CRF algorithm to obtain <Entity, Relation, Entity> triples. 

Finally, the knowledge graph was verified and automatically constructed from the extracted triples. 

The constructed TCM knowledge graph mainly contains five types of nodes: Diseases, Symptoms, 

Syndromes, Prescriptions and Chinese Herbals. There are diversified logical relations among the nodes. 

We also integrate a reasoning function besides the TCM knowledge graph to support entity or relation 

deduction through of the reasoning of logical relations among entity nodes. The constructed TCM 

knowledge graph contains more than 10,000 nodes and 220,000 relations currently.  

3 The TCM Question Answering Module 

1) Question Processing 

Medical Named Entity Reorganization: We use a Bi-LSTM+CRF model to achieve named entity 

recognition, as reported in (Huang, et al., 2015), on different types of TCM texts. In the Bi-LSTM+CRF 

model, the first layer is a look-up layer, in which each word in a question sentence can be presented as 

a vector by using a pre-trained or randomly initialized word embedding matrix. The second layer is a 

bi-directional LSTM, which automatically extracts the characteristics of the sentence. Thus, the word 

embedding sequence of each word in the sentence can be the input of the bi-directional LSTM. It then 

splices implicit state sequence output by a forward LSTM in terms of locations to obtain a complete 

implicit state sequence. The third layer is a CRF layer, which labels sentence-level sequences. 

Relation Extraction: Multi-channel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to determine 

the relations between a pair of entities in a given free question (Xu, et al., 2016). Specifically, two CNNs 

channels are used. One is used to capture syntax information and the other is to capture context infor-

mation. The convolutional layer of each channel accepts an input of variable length, while returns a 

vector of fixed length using the Maximum Sampling method. These fixed-length vectors are combined 

together to form the input of final softmax classifier, whose output vector dimension equals to the total 

number of relation categories and the value of each dimension equals to the degree of confidence 

mapped to the corresponding predicates in the knowledge graph. 

2) Single-round Question Answering 

Entity Linking: Entity linking plays a vital role in the TCM concept association and normalization 

(Liu, et al., 2016). After medical named entity identification, an entity linking tool named as S-MART 

is used to obtain associated entities in the TCM knowledge graph.  



17

Joint Disambiguation of Entities and Relations: Under normal circumstances, both named entity 

recognition and entity relation extraction are independently predicted. The errors generated in the pro-

cesses are usually difficult to avoid. We use a joint optimization model to select a globally optimal 

‘entity-relation’ configuration from the candidate results of entity linking and relation extraction. The 

process of optimizing the globally configuration can be treated as a sorting problem in essence. To find 

‘reasonable’ entity- relation configuration, TCM knowledge is applied to sort entity-relations, that is, 

the ‘reasonable’ entity-relation configuration should be more common in the TCM knowledge graph so 

as to efficiently locate answers to users’ questions using the TCM knowledge graph. 

3) Multi-round Dialogue 

Multi-round dialogue refers to the management of multiple-round interactions while keeping context 

linkage. It contains entity linking for recognizing entities and joint disambiguation, through which, a 

topic and the certain slot are resolved and then stored. After that, the scope of the topic is identified. 

Given a new question, the system judges whether it follows the previous topic. If it follows, the question 

is regarded as in the same dialogue. Otherwise, it is treated as a new multi-round dialogue.  

Forward facing centers strategy was adopted for anaphora resolution. When context information is 

insufficient to identify specific entity, a ranked list of discourse entities will be displayed to users along 

with inquiry. User’s input straight after this list will be preferentially considered as the decision of entity 

assignment. If none of listed candidates is mentioned, then the entity of input question will be treated as 

constrain of last question to joint next round disambiguates. The screen snapshots of the whole TCM 

question answering module is presented as Figure 2.

logue; right: the single-round question answering) 

4 The TCM Knowledge Retrieval Module 

1) Search Word Extension 

Search word extension provides users with a guided retrieval, that is, the entity node in the knowledge 

graph can be located according to search words and corresponding entity attributes can be returned as a 

retrieval guide. For example, if a user asking about a specific disease, the module returns with disease 

interpretation, the disease property and other relevant information. In addition to retrieving entities, the 

user can also retrieve relations. For example, if the user asking a syndrome of a specific disease, all the 

associated syndromes of the disease are regarded as relevant information and are returned. Moreover, 



18

to assistant common users in the usage of the module, a list of TCM terminology and synonym diction-

aries are integrated. The module will display matched synonyms of search words when a user simply 

type an informal medical term as a search word. The search word extension function is demonstrated as 

Figure 3.

2) Human-computer Interactive Retrieval 

The Human-computer interactive retrieval module consists of entity-relation visualization, relevant 

illustration and knowledge association. The entity-relation visualization assists common users to view 

all associated entities and relations for a specific entity. When a user clicks an entity node, the module 

automatically presents related entities whose distances below a specific threshold. The relations between 

the nodes also are displayed. When a node or link is clicked, related knowledge information will be 

extracted and be displayed as the detailed explanation of the node to users as relevant illustration. The 

knowledge association provides users with relevant knowledge to search content according to the clas-

sical TCM logic of ‘Theory-Approach-Prescription-Medicine’. From the expertise, contents are associ-

ated to different categories. For instance, associated contents are similar disease or frequently co-occur-

rence disease when search content is a disease, and the associated contents are co-occurrence Chinese 

herbal or same efficacy Chinese herbal when search content is a Chinese herbal. Through this TCM 

association, the interactive retrieval module can serve common and professional users who has partial 

knowledge about TCM better. The interactive retrieval module is shown as Figure 4
