Abstract
The paper describes Tilde’s work on developing a neural machine translation (NMT) tool for
the 2017-2018 Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The tool was developed by
combining the European Commission’s eTranslation service with a set of customized, domain-
adapted NMT systems built by Tilde. The central aim of the tool is to assist staff members,
translators, EU delegates, journalists, and other visitors at EU Council Presidency events in
Estonia, Bulgaria, and Austria. The paper provides details on the workflow used to collect,
filter, clean, normalize, and pre-process data for the NMT systems; and the methods applied
for training and adaptation of the NMT systems for the EU Council Presidency. The paper also
compares the trained NMT systems to other publicly available MT systems for Estonian and
Bulgarian, showing that the custom systems achieve better results than competing systems.

1 Introduction

The administrative work of the European Union (EU) is led by the Presidency of the Council of
the EU, which is hosted by a different EU Member State every six months. During its half-year
term, the hosting country is tasked with organizing hundreds of high-level events, including
conferences and administrative meetings. As the EU Council Presidency brings together dele-
gates and journalists from 28 EU Member States – home to the EU’s 24 official languages – the
issue of language barriers becomes a major challenge for the politically important event.

To overcome language barriers during the EU Council Presidency in 2017-2018, the North-
ern Europe-based language technology company Tilde developed a multilingual communica-
tion tool that enables automated translation at scale by combining customized neural machine
translation (NMT) systems and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) eTranslation service for
the EU’s official languages, developed by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for
Translation.1 Tilde first developed a prototype version of the EU Council Presidency Translator
for the 2015 EU Council Presidency in Latvia.

eTranslation is a building block of the European Commission’s CEF program, which “sup-
ports trans-European networks in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy”2

with building blocks that “facilitate the delivery of digital public services across borders.”3 Ac-
cording to the European Commission’s CEF Digital website4,

“the central aim of [the CEF eTranslation service] is to help European and national

public administrations exchange information across language barriers in the EU, by
providing machine translation capabilities that will enable all Digital Service Infras-
tructures to be multilingual. CEF eTranslation builds on the existing machine trans-
lation service of the European Commission, MT@EC, developed by the Directorate-
General for Translation (DGT). MT@EC translation engines are trained using the
vast Euramis translation memories, comprising over 1 billion sentences in the 24 of-
ficial EU languages, produced by the translators of the EU institutions over the past
decades.”

By combining the CEF eTranslation service with custom NMT engines developed by Tilde,
the EU Council Presidency Translator is used to translate text snippets, documents, and websites
using a responsive online translation website and a computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool
plugin. The main users for the translation tools include EU Council Presidency staff members,
public sector translators in the hosting country of the Presidency, EU delegates, and interna-
tional journalists covering the events. The service was first utilized during the 2017 EU Council
Presidency in Estonia5, from July-December 2017, and featured NMT systems for Estonian, a
highly inflected, agglutinative language with just 1.5 million native speakers.

The customized NMT systems for Estonian were built utilizing Tilde’s methods for de-
veloping state-of-the-art NMT systems for complex languages. The methods include extensive
data collection, corpus filtering (i.e., noise removal), data pre-processing, unknown phenomena
modelling, and training of NMT models with state-of-the-art recurrent neural network architec-
tures. Additionally to the custom NMT systems, the EU Council Presidency Translator provides
access to all of the machine translation (MT) systems from the CEF eTranslation service, for
translation between the 24 official languages of the EU and English.

In 2018, the EU Council Presidency Translator has been expanded to feature customized
NMT systems for Bulgarian6, to support the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency in January-June
of 2018. The tool has been integrated directly into the official website of the Bulgarian EU
Council Presidency, eu2018bg.bg, where the site’s many users from throughout the world can
find the translation tool in the main menu under the heading “Media.” The tool will be further
expanded and adapted to include customized NMT systems for German to support the upcoming
Austrian EU Council Presidency, in the second half of 2018.

To date, the EU Council Presidency Translator has been used to translate over 4.5 million
words. This encompasses translation requests made in the last three months of the Estonian
EU Council Presidency (following the launch of the tool in late September 2017) and the first
two months of the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency (from January 1 to February 19, 2018).
95% of translation requests were made for the customized NMT systems developed by Tilde
for Estonian and Bulgarian.

Since its launch in September 2017, the EU Council Presidency Translator has received
accolades from the European Commission7, from staff translators at the EC’s translation direc-
torate, from the Ministry for the 2018 Bulgarian EU Council Presidency8, as well as from the
prime ministers of Italy and Greece9, who were introduced to the tool at the EU Digital Summit
in Tallinn, Estonia.

In this paper, we describe the unique multilingual challenges faced by the EU Council
Presidency, the Presidency’s stated requirements for a multilingual communication tool, and

The paper is further structured as follows: Section 2 describes the challenges and require-

ments for the EU Council Presidency Translator; Section 3 provides a general overview of the
EU Council Presidency Translator; Section 4 describes the interfaces that can be used by users
to access the MT systems of the EU Council Presidencies; Section 5 describes the methods used
to develop the custom NMT systems; and Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Challenges and Requirements for the EU Council Presidency Translator

The numerous EU delegates, international journalists, and foreign visitors at the events orga-
nized by each hosting country of the EU Council Presidency represent speakers of (at least the)
24 official languages of the EU. Preparation of documents, press releases, event information,
cultural programmes, and other texts in all 24 languages would be a costly endeavour for the
hosting country. Therefore, the EU Council Presidency requires machine translation systems
that can allow the participating parties to consume all the information produced by the hosting
country in its own official language.

In addition, the hosting country gathers these thousands of visitors in its own capital city,
where local news and information is produced in the language of the hosting country. Therefore,
the EU Council Presidency also required machine translation systems that produced highly
fluent translations for the official language of the hosting country (Estonian in 2017, Bulgarian
and German in 2018).

To make these systems available for the wide variety of individuals attending official EU
Council Presidency events the EU Council Presidency also required the above-mentioned ma-
chine translation systems to be made as easily usable as possible, i.e., integrated into user-
friendly online tools, including the official website of the EU Council Presidency. These tools
should allow for the translation of various types of content: text snippets, full documents (e.g.,
various OpenDocument10 or Office Open XML11 formats), websites, and professional transla-
tion files (e.g., Translation Memory eXchange (TMX)12, XML Localisation Interchange File
Format (XLIFF)13, etc.).

The main challenges posed by these requirements were as follows:

• Integration of CEF eTranslation service for all 24 official EU languages.

• Development of customized NMT systems for the official languages of the hosting coun-
tries in 2017-2018 (Estonian, Bulgarian, German).

• Development of user-friendly tools for utilizing the machine translation systems (respon-
sive online interface, integration in the official website of the EU Council Presidency, etc.).

• Development of text, document, website translation functionality.

• Development of a MT plugin for staff and public sector translators in the hosting country
to utilize in CAT tools.

3 Infrastructure for the EU Council Presidency Translator

To facilitate translation needs of the EU Council Presidencies, the EU Council Presidency
Translator has been developed as a toolkit (see Figure 1 for an overview) that utilizes services

Figure 1: Architecture of the EU Council Presidency Translator

of both the Tilde MT platform (Vasiļjevs et al., 2012) and the CEF eTranslation service. The
Tilde MT platform performs two tasks:

1. Serves as an MT system broker that receives translation requests (text snippets, translation
segments, documents, and websites) from the two main translation interfaces (the transla-
tion website and the CAT tool plugin) and routes the requests to specific MT systems for
translation. This architecture allows not only to utilise Tilde MT and eTranslation systems
in one user interface, but it also allows to integrate other external MT provider systems
within the MT broker in a way that no changes have to be made to the EU Council Presi-
dency Translator’s user interfaces.

2. Provides access to the customized EU Council Presidency NMT systems that have been
trained and adapted to better translate texts specific to the topics covered by each of the
EU Council Presidencies.

4 Translation Interfaces for the EU Council Presidencies

Translators of the EU Council Presidencies, as well as journalists, EU delegates, and other
visitors, can use two types of MT interfaces to translate texts, documents, and websites written
in the local language of the hosting country into English or content written in English into their
own language.

4.1 EU Council Presidency Translation Website
The EU Council Presidency Translator is available online, in a special website linked to the
main page of the official EU Council Presidency website.14 The website is an online translation
workspace that allows users to translate texts, full documents (preserving document formatting),
and websites in the 24 official EU languages. The portal is customized for each EU Council

lator websites

of the document translation form for both Estonian and Bulgarian EU Council presidencies is
depicted in Figure 2.

4.2 CAT Tool Plugin
The EU Council Presidency Translator is also available for professional translators who use the
SDL Trados Studio15 CAT tool with the help of a plugin. The plugin enables users specifi-
cally, public administration translators and staff of the EU Council Presidency to utilize the
eTranslation service and the custom NMT systems in their everyday work. The plugin pro-
vides functionality for translation task pre-translation or translation suggestion preparation in a
segment-by-segment translation scenario.

5 Customized NMT Systems

Customized NMT systems for the EU Council Presidencies were developed using the Tilde MT
platform, which provides the necessary functionality for corpora cleaning, data pre-processing,
and post-processing, as well as allows to deploy NMT systems in a scalable cloud-based infras-
tructure. The following processing steps were performed to train each of the NMT systems:

• First, parallel and monolingual corpora were collected. The EU Presidency systems have
two main goals: 1) to help EU Council Presidency staff members to prepare translations
of documents related to the EU Council presidency, and 2) to help visitors of the hosting
country to get acquainted with current events taking place in the hosting country. There-
fore, the MT systems have two broad target domains - EU Council Presidency and news
content. To ensure that the NMT systems are capable of translating such content, focussed
web crawling was performed to collect parallel and monolingual data from government
and media websites. Additionally, parallel and (in-domain) monolingual data were se-
lected from the Tilde Data Library16 or supplied by the project’s partners.

• Then, the parallel corpora were filtered, cleaned, and normalized using corpora processing
tools from Tilde MT. The filtering procedure identifies and removes sentence pairs with
the following issues: equal source and target content (i.e., source-source or target-target

entries), sentence splitting issues (e.g., a part of a sentence aligned to a full sentence), for-
eign (neither source, nor target) language sentences, words, or phrases in source or target
sentences, sentence alignment (i.e., non-parallel sentence pair) issues, data redundancy is-
sues, and data corruption issues (e.g., due to errors caused by optical character recognition
or wrong formatting of documents). For more details on the filtering procedures, see the
paper by Pinnis et al. (2017b). The data were further cleaned and normalized by removing
HTML and XML tags, byte order marks, control symbols, escaped characters (e.g., ”\n”,
”\r”), empty braces and curly tags (specific to some CAT tools), decoding XML entities,
normalizing whitespace characters and punctuation marks (e.g., quotation marks, apostro-
phes, dashes, etc.), and separating ligatures (specific to data that are acquired using OCR
methods).

• The normalized data were further pre-processed using language-specific tools for non-
translatable entity (e.g., e-mail address, file or URL address, various tag and alphanumeric
code, etc.) identification, tokenization, and truecasing.

• Following the methodology by Pinnis et al. (2017a), for the Bulgarian EU Presidency
we trained NMT models that are more robust to unknown phenomena than vanilla NMT
models. To do this, we supplemented the parallel corpus with a synthetic version of the
same parallel corpus, which had content words replaced with unknown word tokens in a
random manner. To make sure that the same words were replaced on both (source and
target) sides, we performed word alignment of the corpus using fast-align (Dyer et al.,
2013) and restricted the replacement to only those content words that had non-ambiguous
(one-to-one) word alignments.

• Once the data were pre-processed, NMT models were trained using the Nematus (Sen-
nrich et al., 2017) toolkit. All NMT models were sub-word (Sennrich et al., 2015) level
attention-based encoder-decoder models with multiplicative long short-term memory units
(MLSTM; Krause et al. (2016)). For training, we used the MLSTM model implementation
and the NMT training configuration defined by Pinnis et al. (2017b). More specifically, the
NMT models were trained using a vocabulary of 25,000 word parts, an embedding layer
of 500 dimensions, recurrent layers of 1024 dimensions, dropout rate of 0.2 for recurrent
layers and 0.1 for input and output embedding layers, and gradient clipping with a thresh-
old of 1. For parameter updates, the Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) optimizer with a learning rate
of 0.0001 was used.

• When the baseline systems were trained (i.e., they reached the Nematus early stopping
criterion of not improving for more than 10 times on validation data), we performed back-
translation of in-domain monolingual data in order to prepare synthetic corpora for domain
adaptation. The synthetic corpora were filtered, cleaned, normalized and pre-processed us-
ing the same workflow that was used to process the parallel corpora. This allowed ensuring
that excess noise (i.e., possible NMT mistranslations) was filtered out before performing
domain adaptation.

• Finally, NMT model domain adaptation was performed using new training corpora that
consisted in balanced proportions (i.e., one-to-one) of the initial training data and the syn-
thetic back-translated data. The one-to-one proportion allows the NMT model to adapt to
the required domain, but, at the same time, it allows the model to remember what it had
learned during the initial training phase.

Further, we will analyse the data used for training of the NMT systems and the evaluation
results of the Estonian (see Section 5.1) and Bulgarian (see Section 5.2) EU Council Presidency
NMT systems.

5.1 NMT Systems for the Estonian EU Council Presidency

The Estonian EU Council Presidency NMT systems were trained on a mixture of publicly avail-
able and proprietary corpora. The largest corpora among the publicly available corpora were
the Open Subtitles (Tiedemann, 2009) (release of 2016), DTG-TM (Steinberger et al., 2012),
Tilde MODEL (Rozis and Skadiņš, 2017), DCEP (Hajlaoui et al., 2014), Microsoft Translation
Memories and UI Strings Glossaries (Microsoft, 2015), and Europarl (Koehn, 2005) parallel
corpora. The public corpora amounted to approximately half of all the training data. The other
half was comprised of proprietary data from the Tilde Data Library.

For domain adaptation, we collected parallel and monolingual corpora from the Estonian
EU Council Presidency website17 and monolingual corpora from various local news agencies.
The crawling was restricted to only local resources as the main goals of the EU Council Pres-
idency systems are to enable better translation for content specific to the topics covered by the
EU Council Presidency and the topics covered in the news of the hosting country (and not to
cater for general translation tasks).

Statistics of the data used for training of the NMT systems are given in Table 1. The data
show that for training of the Estonian-English and English-Estonian NMT systems, a substantial
amount of data (almost 19 million sentence pairs) were used. The table also shows that the
in-domain Estonian monolingual corpus that was used for domain adaptation of the English-
Estonian system was more than two times larger than the English monolingual corpus. This is
due to the fact that local content in English is much harder to obtain as it is available in much
smaller quantities.

The training progress of the baseline NMT systems, as well as the NMT system adaptation
process, is depicted in Figure 3. The figure shows that domain adaptation did improve transla-
tion quality for the English-Estonian NMT system (by more than one BLEU point), however,
the quality increase for the Estonian-English system was rather insignificant (only 0.15 BLEU
points). This may be partially explained by the significantly smaller amount of in-domain mono-
lingual data that were available for the creation of the synthetic parallel corpus.

After training and adaptation, we performed automatic evaluation of all NMT systems
(both baseline and adapted systems) using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ChrF2 (Popović,
2015), and CharacTER (Wang et al., 2016) (one standard and two newer evaluation metrics
that show higher correlation scores to human judgements compared to BLEU for Slavic and
Finno-Ugric languages (Bojar et al., 2017)). The results of the evaluation are given in Table 2.
The table includes also evaluation results for Google Translate18 and the English-Estonian and
Estonian-English CEF eTranslation systems.

The evaluation was performed using two different evaluation sets: 1) the ACCURAT bal-
anced evaluation set (Skadiņa et al. (2012); a broad domain evaluation set), and 2) an evaluation
set created from the parallel corpora of the Estonian EU Council Presidency website (covering
also news on various events and topics concerning the Presidency). The results show that both

adapted NMT systems achieve the best translation quality on the in-domain evaluation set. I.e.,
the adapted systems are better suited for translation of texts that cover EU Council Presidency
related topics than other compared systems. The results also show that the baseline NMT sys-
tem for English-Estonian achieves better quality than all competing systems with the adapted
system still outperforming other systems also on the broad domain evaluation set. This shows
that the adapted NMT systems are also highly competitive broad domain NMT systems.

5.2 NMT Systems for the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency
Similarly to the Estonian NMT systems, the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency NMT systems
were also trained on a mixture of publicly available and proprietary corpora. The largest corpora
among the publicly available corpora were the DTG-TM, Tilde MODEL, Microsoft Translation
Memories and UI Strings Glossaries, DCEP, and Europarl parallel corpora. The public cor-
pora amounted to approximately 79% of all the training data. Slightly over 14% of the data
for training of the baseline systems were provided by the project’s partners, the Department
of Computational Linguistics (DCL) of the Institute for Bulgarian Language (IBL) of the Bul-
garian Academy of Sciences.19 The remaining 7% of the data comprised of proprietary data
from the Tilde Data Library. For domain adaptation, monolingual corpora were collected by
DCL from various local (for the Bulgarian and English monolingual corpus) and also interna-
tional (for the English monolingual news corpus) news websites. For the English data, only
documents with explicit mentions of Bulgaria were selected.

Statistics of the data used for training of the NMT systems are given in Table 3. The
data show that for training of the Bulgarian NMT systems, we used a corpus that was almost 3
times smaller than the parallel corpus that was used to train the baseline NMT systems for the
Estonian EU Presidency. However, for the Bulgarian NMT systems, we supplemented the data
with synthetically generated data (see Section 5 for details on the synthetic data). Therefore, the
total number of sentence pairs that were used for training was almost two times larger than in
the initial training data. Because the in-domain monolingual data comprised of approximately
the same amount of sentences as the initial training data, the data sets for domain adaptation

reached even 24 million sentence pairs (where approximately 75% amount for all the synthetic
data).

The training and adaptation progress for the Bulgarian NMT systems is depicted in Fig-
ure 4. The figure shows that (similarly to the trend visible for the Estonian NMT systems) do-
main adaptation did improve translation quality for the English-Bulgarian NMT system (how-
ever, in this case, the improvement was by almost three BLEU points). However, the domain
adaptation failed for the Bulgarian-English NMT system. We believe that this may be the result
of a too broad coverage of the English monolingual corpus. Because the system has to trans-
late from Bulgarian into English, the English monolingual corpus (for the domain adaptation to
work) has to represent what texts in Bulgarian will cover (and not what foreigners may want to
write about Bulgaria in English).

The automatic evaluation was performed using two evaluation data sets: 1) a current news
evaluation data set, and 2) an EU Council Presidency evaluation data set that covers texts re-

Table 4: Automatic evaluation results of the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency NMT (PNMT)
systems

lated to the topics covered by the Bulgarian EU Council Presidency. Both evaluation sets were
prepared by DLC for evaluation of the EU Council Presidency NMT systems. The results in
Table 4 show that for Bulgarian-English the best results are achieved by the Google Translate
systems. As mentioned above, domain adaptation for this language pair did not produce better
results, which may be the result of domain adherence issues of the monolingual data. However,
our baseline NMT systems show significantly better results than the eTranslation systems. This
tendency is evident also if we look at the results for the English-Bulgarian systems. However,
according to BLEU, the English-Bulgarian adapted NMT system does outperform all other sys-
tems on the EU Council Presidency data set. This means that for content covering the EU
Council Presidency, the adapted NMT system will be the most suited system.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the EU Council Presidency Translator developed by Tilde for the
2017-2018 EU Council Presidency. We discussed the architecture of the translation tool and the
two main user interfaces - the translation website and the CAT tool plugin. The translation tool
is available to all translators, EU delegates, journalists, and other visitors of the EU Council
Presidencies in Estonia and Bulgaria. It will also be available for the Austrian EU Council
Presidency in the second half of 2018.

In the six months since its launch in September 2017, the EU Council Presidency Transla-
tor has helped to translate content amounting to over 4.5 million words (or approximately 470
thousand sentences). The main translation directions for both the Estonian and Bulgarian EU
Council Presidencies so far have been between English and the official languages of the hosting
countries (amounting to approximately 95% of all translated words).

By applying Tilde’s own methods for developing domain-specific NMT systems for com-
plex languages, we were able to create customized NMT systems that outperformed the general
eTranslation systems by up to 4 BLEU points for Estonian, and by up to 8 BLEU points for
Bulgarian. Tilde’s customized NMT systems for Estonian and Bulgarian outperformed Google
Translate’s general domain NMT engines for the respective language pairs by up to 1 BLEU
point.

The tool proves that, when integrated into user-friendly tools, NMT can be successfully
applied to enable multilingual communication at high-profile, politically important international
events gathering thousands of visitors. The tool also shows that NMT is useful not only for
professional translators to boost their productivity, but also as a reading and document analysis
tool for a wide range of users in their everyday work, such as EU delegates and international
journalists. By applying NMT to their work, users can access information in multiple languages
and enjoy better understanding of information, thus helping to promote the aims of goals of
high-level events such as the Presidency of the Council of the EU.
