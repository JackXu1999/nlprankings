Abstract

Sense annotation and lexicon building are
costly affairs demanding prudent invest-
ment of resources. Recent work on mul-
tilingual WSD has shown that it is possi-
ble to leverage the annotation work done
for WSD of one language (SL) for another
(TL), by projecting Wordnet and sense
marked corpus parameters of SL to TL.
However, this work does not take into ac-
count the cost of manually cross-linking
the words within aligned synsets. Further,
it does not answer the question of “Can
better accuracy be achieved if a user is
willing to pay additional money?” We
propose a measure for cost-beneﬁt analy-
sis which measures the “value for money”
earned in terms of accuracy by invest-
ing in annotation effort and lexicon build-
ing. Two key ideas explored in this pa-
per are (i) the use of probabilistic cross-
linking model to reduce manual cross-
linking effort and (ii) the use of selective
sampling to inject a few training examples
for hard-to-disambiguate words from the
target language to boost the accuracy.

1 Introduction

ever, creation of sense marked corpora has always
remained a costly proposition, especially for some
of the resource deprived languages.

To circumvent

this problem, Khapra et al.
(2009) proposed a WSD method that can be ap-
plied to a language even when no sense tagged
corpus for that language is available. This is
achieved by projecting Wordnet and corpus pa-
rameters from another language to the language
in question. The approach is centered on a novel
synset based multilingual dictionary (Mohanty et
al., 2008) where the synsets of different languages
are aligned and thereafter the words within the
synsets are manually cross-linked. For example,
the word WL1 belonging to synset S of language
L1 will be manually cross-linked to the word WL2
of the corresponding synset in language L2 to in-
dicate that WL2 is the best substitute for WL1 ac-
cording to an experienced bilingual speaker’s in-
tuition.

We extend their work by addressing the follow-
ing question on the economics of annotation, lex-
icon building and performance:

• Is there an optimal point of balance between
the annotation effort and the lexicon build-
ing (i.e. manual cross-linking) effort at which
one can be assured of best value for money in
terms of accuracy?

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of
the most widely investigated problems of Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Previous works have
shown that supervised approaches to Word Sense
Disambiguation which rely on sense annotated
corpora (Ng and Lee, 1996; Lee et al., 2004) out-
perform unsupervised (Veronis, 2004) and knowl-
edge based approaches (Mihalcea, 2005). How-

To address the above question we ﬁrst propose
a probabilistic cross linking model to eliminate
the effort of manually cross linking words within
the source and target language synsets and cali-
brate the resultant trade-off in accuracy. Next, we
show that by injecting examples for most frequent
hard-to-disambiguate words from the target do-
main one can achieve higher accuracies at optimal

556

cost of annotation. Finally, we propose a measure
for cost-beneﬁt analysis which identiﬁes the op-
timal point of balance between these three related
entities, viz., cross-linking, sense annotation and
accuracy of disambiguation.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2 we present related work. In sec-
tion 3 we describe the Synset based multilingual
dictionary which enables parameter projection. In
section 4 we discuss the work of Khapra et al.
(2009) on parameter projection for multilingual
WSD. Section 5 is on the economics of multilin-
gual WSD. In section 6 we propose a probabilistic
model for representing the cross-linkage of words
within synsets.
In section 7 we present a strat-
egy for injecting hard-to-disambiguate cases from
the target language using selective sampling. In
section 8 we introduce a measure for cost-beneﬁt
analysis for calculating the value for money in
terms of accuracy, annotation effort and lexicon
building effort. In section 9 we describe the exper-
imental setup. In section 10 we present the results
followed by discussion in section 11. Section 12
concludes the paper.

2 Related Work

Knowledge based approaches to WSD such as
Lesk’s algorithm (Lesk, 1986), Walker’s algo-
rithm (Walker and Amsler, 1986), Conceptual
Density (Agirre and Rigau, 1996) and PageRank
(Mihalcea, 2005) are less demanding in terms of
resources but fail to deliver good results. Super-
vised approaches like SVM (Lee et al., 2004) and
k-NN (Ng and Lee, 1996), on the other hand, give
better accuracies, but the requirement of large an-
notated corpora renders them unsuitable for re-
source scarce languages.

Recent work by Khapra et al. (2009) has shown
that it is possible to project the parameters learnt
from the annotation work of one language to an-
other language provided aligned Wordnets for two
languages are available. However, their work does
not address the question of further improving the
accuracy of WSD by using a small amount of
training data from the target language. Some sim-
ilar work has been done in the area of domain
adaptation where Chan et al. (2007) showed that
adding just 30% of the target data to the source

data achieved the same performance as that ob-
tained by taking the entire source and target data.
Similarly, Agirre and de Lacalle (2009) reported a
22% error reduction when source and target data
were combined for training a classiﬁer, compared
to the case when only the target data was used for
training the classiﬁer. However, such combining
of training statistics has not been tried in cases
where the source data is in one language and the
target data is in another language.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous work
has attempted to perform resource conscious all-
words multilingual Word Sense Disambigua-
tion by ﬁnding a trade-off between the cost (in
terms of annotation effort and lexicon creation ef-
fort) and the quality in terms of F-score.

3 Synset based multilingual dictionary

A novel and effective method of storage and use
of dictionary in a multilingual setting was pro-
posed by Mohanty et al. (2008). For the purpose
of current discussion, we will refer to this multi-
lingual dictionary framework as MultiDict. One
important departure in this framework from the
traditional dictionary is that synsets are linked,
and after that the words inside the synsets
are linked. The basic mapping is thus between
synsets and thereafter between the words.

Concepts
04321: a
youthful
male
person

L1 (English) L2 (Hindi) L3 (Marathi)
{malechild,
boy}

{lwкA
(ladkaa),
bAlк
(baalak),
bQcA
(bachchaa)}

{m(cid:0) lgA
(mulgaa),
porgA
(por-
gaa), por
(por)}

Table 1: Multilingual Dictionary Framework

Table 1 shows the structure of MultiDict, with one
example row standing for the concept of boy. The
ﬁrst column is the pivot describing a concept with
a unique ID. The subsequent columns show the
words expressing the concept in respective lan-
guages (in the example table, English, Hindi and
Marathi). After the synsets are linked, cross link-
ages are set up manually from the words of a
synset to the words of a linked synset of the pivot
language. For example, for the Marathi word
m(cid:0) lgA (mulgaa), “a youthful male person”, the

557

correct lexical substitute from the corresponding
Hindi synset is lwкA (ladkaa). The average num-
ber of such links per synset per language pair is
approximately 3.

4 Parameter Projection

Khapra et al. (2009) proposed that the various
parameters essential for domain-speciﬁc Word
Sense Disambiguation can be broadly classiﬁed
into two categories:

Wordnet-dependent parameters:

• belongingness-to-dominant-concept
• conceptual distance
• semantic distance

Corpus-dependent parameters:

• sense distributions
• corpus co-occurrence

They proposed a scoring function (Equation (1))
which combines these parameters to identify the
correct sense of a word in a context:

S∗ = arg max

i

(θiVi +Xj∈J

where,

Wij ∗ Vi ∗ Vj)

(1)

tasks of (a) constructing a Wordnet from scratch
and (b) collecting sense marked corpora for mul-
tiple languages are tedious and expensive. Khapra
et al. (2009) observed that by projecting relations
from the Wordnet of a language and by project-
ing corpus statistics from the sense marked cor-
pora of the language to those of the target lan-
guage, the effort required in constructing seman-
tic graphs for multiple Wordnets and collecting
sense marked corpora for multiple languages can
be avoided or reduced. At the heart of their work
lies the MultiDict described in previous section
which facilitates parameter projection in the fol-
lowing manner:
1. By linking with the synsets of a pivot re-
source rich language (Hindi, in our case), the cost
of building Wordnets of other languages is partly
reduced (semantic relations are inherited). The
Wordnet parameters of Hindi Wordnet now be-
come projectable to other languages.
2. For calculating corpus speciﬁc sense distri-
butions, P (Sense Si|W ord W ), we need the
counts, #(Si, W ). By using cross linked words
in the synsets, these counts become projectable to
the target language (Marathi, in our case) as they
can be approximated by the counts of the cross
linked Hindi words calculated from the Hindi
sense marked corpus as follows:

i ∈ Candidate Synsets
J = Set of disambiguated words
θi = BelongingnessT oDominantConcept(Si)
Vi = P (Si|word)
Wij = CorpusCooccurrence(Si, Sj)

∗ 1/W N ConceptualDistance(Si, Sj)
∗ 1/W N SemanticGraphDistance(Si, Sj)
The ﬁrst component θiVi of Equation (1) captures
inﬂuence of the corpus speciﬁc sense of a word in
a domain. The other component Wij ∗ Vi ∗ Vj cap-
tures the inﬂuence of interaction of the candidate
sense with the senses of context words weighted
by factors of co-occurrence, conceptual distance
and semantic distance.

Wordnet-dependent parameters depend on the
structure of the Wordnet whereas the Corpus-
dependent parameters depend on various statis-
tics learnt from a sense marked corpora. Both the

P (Si|W ) =

#(Si, marathi word)

Pj #(Sj , marathi word)

P (Si|W ) ≈

#(Si, cross linked hindi word)

Pj #(Sj , cross linked hindi word)

The rationale behind the above approximation
is the observation that within a domain sense dis-
tributions remain the same across languages.

5 The Economics of Multilingual WSD

The problem of multilingual WSD using parame-
ter projection can be viewed as an economic sys-
tem consisting of three factors. The ﬁrst factor is
the cost of manually cross-linking the words in a
synsets of the target language to the words in the
corresponding synset in the pivot language. The
second factor is the cost of sense annotated data
from the target language. The third factor is the
accuracy of WSD The ﬁrst two factors in some

558

sense relate to the cost of purchasing a commod-
ity and the third factor relates to the commodity
itself.

The work of Khapra et al. (2009) as described
above does not attempt to reach an optimal cost-
beneﬁt point in this economic system. They place
their bets on manual cross-linking only and set-
tle for the accuracy achieved thereof. Speciﬁ-
cally, they do not explore the inclusion of small
amount of annotated data from the target language
to boost the accuracy (as mentioned earlier, su-
pervised systems which use annotated data from
the target language are known to perform bet-
ter). Further, it is conceivable that with respect
to accuracy-cost trade-off, there obtains a case
for balancing one cost against the other, viz., the
cost of cross-linking and the cost of annotation.
In some cases bilingual lexicographers (needed
for manual cross-linking) may be more expensive
compared to monolingual annotators. There it
makes sense to place fewer bets on manual cross-
linking and more on collecting annotated corpora.
On the other hand if manual cross-linking is cheap
then a very small amount of annotated corpora
can be used in conjunction with full manual cross-
linking to boost the accuracy. Based on the above
discussion, if ka is the cost of sense annotating
one word, kc is the cost of manually cross-linking
a word and A is the accuracy desired then the
problem of multilingual WSD can be cast as an
optimization problem:

minimize wa ∗ ka + wc ∗ kc

s.t.

Accuracy ≥ A

where, wc and wa are the number of words to be
manually cross linked and annotated respectively.
Ours is thus a 3-factor economic model (cross-
linking, annotation and accuracy) as opposed to
the 2-factor model (cross-linking, accuracy) pro-
posed by Khapra et al. (2009).

6 Optimal cross-linking

As mentioned earlier, in some cases where bilin-
gual lexicographers are expensive we might be in-
terested in reducing the effort of manual cross-
linking. For such situations, we propose that
only a small number of words, comprising of the

most frequently appearing ones should be manu-
ally cross linked and the rest of the words should
be cross-linked using a probabilistic model. The
rationale here is simple:
invest money in words
which are bound to occur frequently in the test
data and achieve maximum impact on the accu-
racy. In the following paragraphs, we explain our
probabilistic cross linking model.

The model proposed by Khapra et al. (2009) is
a deterministic model where the expected count
for (Sense S, Marathi Word W ), i.e., the num-
ber of times the word W appears in sense S is
approximated by the count for the correspond-
ing cross linked Hindi word. Such a model as-
sumes that each Marathi word links to appropri-
ate Hindi word(s) as identiﬁed manually by a lex-
icographer. Instead, we propose a probabilistic
model where a Marathi word can link to every
word in the corresponding Hindi synset with
some probability. The expected count for (S, W )
can then be estimated as:

E[#(S, W )] = X

hi∈cross links

P (hi|W, S) ∗ #(S, hi) (2)

where, P (hi|W, S) is the probability that the word
hi from the corresponding Hindi synset is the
correct cross-linked word for the given Marathi
word. For example, one of the senses of the
Marathi word maan is {neck} i.e. “the body
part which connects the head to the rest of the
body”. The corresponding Hindi synset has 10
words {gardan, gala, greeva, halak, kandhar and
so on}. Thus, using Equation (2), the expected
count, E[C({neck}, maan)], is calculated as:

E[#({neck}, maan)] =

P (gardan|maan,{neck}) ∗ #({neck}, gardan)

+ P (gala|maan,{neck}) ∗ #({neck}, gala)
+ P (greeva|maan,{neck}) ∗ #({neck}, greeva)
+ . . . so on f or all words in the Hindi synset

Instead of using a uniform probability distribution
over the Hindi words we go by the empirical ob-
servation that some words in a synset are more
representative of that sense than other words, i.e.
some words are more preferred while expressing
that sense. For example, out of the 10 words in

559

the Hindi synset only 2 words {gardan, gala} ap-
peared in the corpus. We thus estimate the value
of P (hi|W, S) empirically from the Hindi sense
marked corpus by making the following indepen-
dence assumption:

P (hi|W, S) = P (hi|S)

The rationale behind the above independence as-
sumption becomes clear if we represent words and
synsets using the Bayesian network of Figure 1.
Here, the Hindi word hi and the Marathi word W

Figure 1: Bayesian network formed by a synset S
and the constituent Hindi and Marathi words

are considered to be derived from the same par-
ent concept S. In other words, they represent two
different manifestations- one in Hindi and one in
Marathi- of the same synset S. Given the above
representation, it is easy to see that given the par-
ent synset S, the Hindi word hi is independent of
the Marathi word W .

7 Optimal annotation using Selective

Sampling

In the previous section we dealt with the ques-
tion of optimal cross-linking. Now we take up
the other dimension of this economic system, viz.,
optimal use of annotated corpora for better accu-
racy. In other words, if an application demands
higher accuracy for WSD and is willing to pay for
some annotation then there should be a way of en-
suring best possible accuracy at lowest possible
cost. This can be done by including small amount
of sense annotated data from the target language.
The simplest strategy is to randomly annotate text
from the target language and use it as training
data. However, this strategy of random sampling
may not be the most optimum in terms of cost.
Instead, we propose a selective sampling strategy
where the aim is to identify hard-to-disambiguate

words from the target language and use them for
training.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1.
First, using the probabilistic cross linking
model and aligned Wordnets we learn the param-
eters described in Section 4.
2. We then apply this scoring function on un-
tagged examples (development set) from the tar-
get language and identify hard-to-disambiguate
words i.e., the words which were disambiguated
with a very low conﬁdence.
3. Training instances of these words are then in-
jected into the training data and the parameters
learnt from them are used instead of the projected
parameters learnt from the source language cor-
pus.

Thus, the selective sampling strategy ensures
that we get maximum value for money by spend-
ing it on annotating only those words which would
otherwise not have been disambiguated correctly.
A random selection strategy, in contrast, might
bring in words which were disambiguated cor-
rectly using only the projected parameters.

8 A measure for cost-beneﬁt analysis

We need a measure for cost-beneﬁt analysis based
on the three dimensions of our economic system,
viz., annotation effort, lexicon creation effort and
performance in terms of F-score. The ﬁrst two di-
mensions can be fused into a single dimension by
expressing the annotation effort and lexicon cre-
ation effort in terms of cost incurred. For example,
we assume that the cost of annotating one word is
ka and the cost of cross-linking one word is kc ru-
pees. Further, we deﬁne a baseline and an upper
bound for the F-score. In this case, the baseline
would be the accuracy that can be obtained with-
out spending any money on cross-linking and an-
notation in the target language. An upper bound
could be the best F-score obtained using a large
amount of annotated corpus in the target domain.
Based on the above description, an ideal measure
for cost-beneﬁt analysis would assign a
1. reward depending on the improvement over the
baseline performance.
2. penalty depending on the difference from the
upper bound on performance.
3.

reward inversely proportional to the cost in-

560

curred in terms of annotation effort and/or manual
cross-linking.

skilled bilingual lexicographers and skilled mono-
lingual annotators.

Based on the above wish-list we propose a mea-

sure for cost-beneﬁt analysis. Let,

M GB = M arginal Gain over Baseline (M GB)

=

P erf ormance(P ) − Baseline(B)

Cost(C)

M DU = M arginal Drop f rom U pperbound (M DU )

=

U pperBound(U ) − P erf ormance(P )

Cost(C)

then

CostBenef it(CB) = M GB − M DU

9 Experimental Setup

We used Hindi as the source language (SL) and
trained a WSD engine using Hindi sense tagged
corpus. The parameters thus learnt were then pro-
jected using the MultiDict (refer section 3 and
4) to build a resource conscious Marathi (TL)
WSD engine. We used the same dataset as de-
scribed in Khapra et al. (2009) for all our ex-
periments. The data was collected from two do-
mains, viz., Tourism and Health. The data for
Tourism domain was collected by manually trans-
lating English documents downloaded from In-
dian Tourism websites into Hindi and Marathi.
Similarly, English documents for Health domain
were obtained from two doctors and were manu-
ally translated into Hindi and Marathi. The Hindi
and Marathi documents thus created were manu-
ally sense annotated by two lexicographers adept
in Hindi and Marathi using the respective Word-
nets as sense repositories. Table 2 summarizes
some statistics about the corpora.

As for cross-linking, Hindi is used as the pivot
language and words in Marathi synset are linked
to the words in the corresponding Hindi synset.
The total number of cross-links that were man-
ually setup were 3600 for Tourism and 1800 for
Health. The cost of cross-linking as well as
sense annotating one word was taken to be 10 ru-
pees. These costs were estimated based on quo-
tations from lexicographers. However, these costs
need to be taken as representative values only and
may vary greatly depending on the availability of

10 Results

Tables 3 and 4 report the average 4-fold perfor-
mance on Marathi Tourism and Health data using
different proportions of available resources, i.e.,
annotated corpora and manual cross-links. In each
of these tables, along the rows, we increase the
amount of Marathi sense annotated corpora from
0K to 6K. Similarly, along the columns we show
the increase in the number of manual cross links
(MCL) used. For example, the second column of
Tables 3 and 4 reports the F-scores when proba-
bilistic cross-linking (PCL) was used for all words
(i.e., no manual cross-links) and varying amounts
of sense annotated corpora from Marathi were
used. Similarly, the ﬁrst row represents the case
in which no sense annotated corpus from Marathi
was used and varying amounts of manual cross-
links were used.

We report three values in the tables, viz., F-
score (F), cost in terms of money (C) and the cost-
beneﬁt (CB) obtained by using x amount of anno-
tated corpus and y amount of manual cross-links.
The cost was estimated using the values given in
section 9 (i.e., 10 rupees for cross-linking or sense
annotating one word). For calculating, the cost-
beneﬁt baseline was taken as the F-score obtained
by using no cross-links and no annotated corpora
i.e. 68.21% for Tourism and 67.28% for Health
(see ﬁrst F-score cell of Tables 3 and 4). Similarly
the upper bound (F-scores obtained by training on
entire Marathi sense marked corpus) for Tourism
and Health were 83.16% and 80.67% respectively
(see last row of Table 5).

Due to unavailability of large amount of tagged
Health corpus, the injection size was varied from
0-to-4K only. In the other dimension, we varied
the cross-links from 0 to 1/3rd to 2/3rd to full only

(refer to Tables 3 and 4). However, to give an
idea about the soundness of probabilistic cross-
linking we performed a separate set of experi-
ments by varying the number of cross-links and
using no sense annotated corpora. Table 5 sum-
marizes these results and compares them with the
baseline (Wordnet ﬁrst sense) and skyline.

In Table 6 we compare our selective sampling
strategy with random sampling when fully proba-
bilistic cross-linking (PCL) is used and when fully
manual cross-linking (MCL) is used. Here again,
due to lack of space we report results only on
Tourism domain. However, we would like to men-
tion that similar experiments on Health domain
showed that the results were indeed consistent.

Finally, in Table 7 we compare the accuracies
obtained when certain amount of annotated corpus
from Marathi is used alone, with the case when the
same amount of annotated corpus is used in con-
junction with probabilistic cross-linking. While
calculating the results for the second row in Table
7, we found that the recall was very low due to the
small size of injections. Hence, to ensure a fair
comparison with our strategy (ﬁrst row) we used
the Wordnet ﬁrst sense (WFS) for these recall er-
rors (a typical practice in WSD literature).

11 Discussions

We make the following observations:
1. PCL v/s MCL: Table 5 shows that the proba-
bilistic cross-linking model performs much better
than the WFS (a typically reported baseline) and
it comes very close to the performance of manual
cross-linking. This establishes the soundness of
the probabilistic model and suggests that with a
little compromise in the accuracy, the model can
be used as an approximation to save the cost of
manual cross-linking. Further, in Table 7 we see
that when PCL is used in conjunction with cer-
tain amount of annotated corpus we get up to 9%
improvement in F-score as compared to the case
when the same amount of annotated corpus is used
alone. Thus, in the absence of skilled bilingual
lexicographers, PCL can still be used to boost the
accuracy obtained using annotated corpora.
2. Selective Sampling v/s Random Annotation:
Table 6 shows the beneﬁt of selective sampling
over random annotation. This beneﬁt is felt more

when the amount of training data injected from
Marathi is small. For example, when an annotated
corpus of size 2K is used, selective sampling gives
an advantage of 3% to 4% over random selection.
Thus the marginal gain (i.e., value for money) ob-
tained by using selective sampling is more than
that obtained by using random annotation.
3. Optimal cost-beneﬁt: Finally, we address the
main message of our work, i.e., ﬁnding the best
cost beneﬁt. By referring to Tables 3 and 4, we
see that the best value for money in Tourism do-
main is obtained by manually cross-linking 2/3rd
of all corpus words and sense annotating 2K tar-
get words and in the Health domain it is obtained
by manually cross-linking 2/3rd of all corpus
words but sense annotating only 1K words. This
suggests that striking a balance between cross-
linking and annotation gives the best value for
money. Further, we would like to highlight that
our 3-factor economic model is able to capture
these relations better than the 2-factor model of
Khapra et al. (2010). As per their model the best
F-score achieved using manual cross-linking for
ALL words was 73.34% for both Tourism and
Health domain at a cost of 36K and 18K respec-
tively. On the other hand, using our model we ob-
tain higher accuracies of 76.96% in the Tourism
domain (using 1/3rd manual cross-links and 2K
injection) at a lower total cost (32K rupees) and
75.57% in the Health domain (using only 1/3rd
cross-linking and 1K injection) at a lower cost
(16K rupees).

12 Conclusion

We reported experiments on multilingual WSD
using different amounts of annotated corpora and
manual cross-links. We showed that there exists
some trade-off between the accuracy and balanc-
ing the cost of annotation and lexicon creation.
In the absence of skilled bilingual lexicographers
one can use a probabilistic cross-linking model
and still obtain good accuracies. Also, while sense
annotating a corpus, careful selection of words us-
ing selective sampling can give better marginal
gain as compared to random sampling.
