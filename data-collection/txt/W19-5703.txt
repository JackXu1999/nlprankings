Abstract
In binary propositional constructions S1 con
S2, the Strong Kleene connectives explain fil-
tering of S1’s and S2’s presuppositions de-
pending on their logical relations with their
non-presuppositional content. However, the
presuppositions derived by the Strong Kleene
connectives are weak conditional presupposi-
tions, which raise the “proviso problem” in
cases where no filtering is motivated. Weak
Kleene connectives do not face this problem,
but only because their presuppositions are of-
ten too strong, and hence do not account for
filtering phenomena altogether. While various
mechanisms have been proposed to allow fil-
tering without the proviso problem, their re-
lations with the standard trivalent Kleene sys-
tems have remained unclear. This paper shows
that by sacrificing truth-functionality, we un-
cover a rich domain of possibilities in triva-
lent semantics in between the Weak Kleene
and Strong Kleene connectives. These systems
derive presupposition filtering while avoiding
the proviso problem. The Kleene-style opera-
tors studied are generalized to arbitrary binary
functions, which further clarifies the connec-
tion between their different “repair” strategies
and presupposition projection.

1 Introduction

Logical theories of natural language semantics
and pragmatics treat presupposition (Beaver and
Geurts, 2014) as a special sort of inference, which
in the following examples we denote ‘ ’:

(1) Sue stopped smoking
  Sue used to smoke

The king of France is bald
  There is a (unique) king of France

Dan regretted visiting LA
  Dan visited LA

It was Zoe who stole my car
  Someone stole my car

What makes presuppositions semantically dis-
tinguished from other entailments is their spe-
cial projection properties: presuppositions are pre-
served under various operators that make other en-
tailments disappear. For instance, the complex
sentences in (2)-(4) below embed the sentence Sue
stopped smoking, whose non-presuppositional en-
tailment Sue doesn’t smoke is not entailed by any
of these complex sentences. By contrast, the state-
ment Sue used to smoke is also a presupposition of
sentences (2)-(4). In semantic jargon we say that
presuppositions are “projected” from conditionals,
negation and epistemic modals.1

(2) If Sue stopped smoking then Dan is happy
now.

(3) It is not the case that Sue stopped smoking.

(4) Possibly, Sue stopped smoking.

We treat such basic projections in trivalent se-
mantics, where natural language sentences are rep-
resented using propositions that denote 1 (true),
0 (false) or  (presupposition failure). We say
that a proposition ϕ is bivalent if ��ϕ��M ~�  for
any model M . Basic entailment, presupposition
and bivalent-presupposition relations are defined
as follows (Keenan, 1973; Beaver, 1997):

Definition 1.1. For propositions ϕ and ψ:
1When it comes to complex sentences like (2)-(4), the lit-

erature is divided on the status of projected presuppositions
like Sue used to smoke: semantic theories treat projected pre-
suppositions as logically entailed from one reading of the em-
bedding sentence; pragmatic theories (Gazdar, 1979; Chier-
chia and McConnel-Ginet, 1990) see them as instances of de-
feasible reasoning. With the rest of the literature on semantic
presupposition, we here assume a logical entailment account,
embracing a systematic ambiguity of sentences like (2)-(4).
Under one reading the presupposition is suspended, e.g. using
Bochvar’s assertion operator (Beaver and Krahmer, 2001) or
Heim’s strategy of local accommodation (Heim, 1983). This
suspension is highlighted in contexts it is not the case that
Sue stopped smoking, since she never smoked, which were
the center of the Russell-Strawson debate.



ϕ� ψ � ϕ entails ψ if

for every model M : if ��ϕ��M �1 then ��ψ��M �1
ϕ  ψ � ϕ presupposes ψ if

for every model M : if ��ϕ��M ~� then ��ψ��M �1
ψ � MBPϕ � ψ is the maximal bivalent
presupposition (MBP) of ϕ if

for every model M : ��ϕ��M ~� iff ��ψ��M �1
To construct elementary presuppositional

propositions from bivalent propositions, we
employ Blamey’s transplication operation on
bivalent propositions (Blamey, 1986; Beaver and
Krahmer, 2001). For bivalent propositions ϕ1 and
ϕ2, the transplication ϕ1 � ϕ2 is defined by:
��ϕ1 � ϕ2��M �  ��ϕ2��M ��ϕ1��M � 1

 ��ϕ1��M � 0
For instance, using the bivalent propositions US

and S, we employ the following treatments of sim-
ple natural language sentences:

(5) a. Sue used to smoke US

b. Sue doesn’t smoke  S

c. Sue stopped smoking US �  S
In this analysis, (5c) entails but doesn’t presuppose
(5b), and presupposes (hence entails) (5a), as intu-
itively required. Furthermore, (5a) is the maximal
bivalent presupposition of (5c).

For any bivalent ϕ1, ϕ2 and ψ, the implication
operator in the Weak Kleene system (WK, Table
1) satisfies the following:

(WK1) MBPϕ1 � ϕ2� ψ � ϕ1
For instance, in sentence (2), property (WK1) cor-
rectly accounts for the projection of the presuppo-
sition Sue used to smoke. Implication in the Strong
Kleene system (SK, Table 2) supports a weaker
presupposition:

(SK1) MBPϕ1 � ϕ2� ψ � ϕ1 - ψ
This property means that SK implication expects
sentence (2) to presuppose Sue used to smoke or
Dan is happy, invoking the intuitively irrelevant
disjunct Dan is happy. This kind of derivation of
irrelevant disjuncts in presuppositions is referred
to as the “proviso problem” (Geurts, 1996), and
appears with all SK connectives (see e.g. (10) be-
low).

Table 2: Strong Kleene (SK) connectives

However, as has been often observed (Peters,
1979; Beaver, 1997), other cases of presupposi-
tion projection reveal substantial advantages to SK
connectives over WK connectives in terms of their
linguistic adequacy. Let us consider for example
the following sentence:

(6) If Sue used to smoke, she stopped smoking.

Sentence (6), unlike (2), is not felt to presuppose
that Sue used to smoke, and similarly sentence (7)
below:

(7) If Sue used to smoke Marlboros, she stopped
smoking.

In semantic jargon, we say that sentences (6)
and (7) are cases of presupposition filtering. In
these sentences, the antecedent Sue used to smoke
(Marlboros) entails the presupposition Sue used to
smoke of the consequent. As a result, that presup-
position gets “filtered out” and is not projected as
an entailment of the conditional sentence. Such
linguistic facts about filtering are accounted for by
SK connectives but not by WK connectives. For
WK and SK implication, this is exemplified by the
following facts for any bivalent ϕ,ψ1 and ψ2:

(WK2) MBPϕ� ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1
(SK2) MBPϕ� ψ1 � ψ2 � ϕ� ψ1



Thus, for sentences (6) and (7), WK implication
counter-intuitively expect the MBP to be Sue used
to smoke. By contrast, (SK2) correctly expects the
MBPs of these sentences to be tautological, which
accounts for presupposition filtering.

Conditional MBPs as in the SK system have
been argued to also be intuitively correct in cases
that do not involve simple filtering (Karttunen and
Peters, 1979; Heim, 1983; Beaver, 2001). For in-
stance, let us consider sentence (8) below:

(8) If Sue used to smoke, she stopped smoking
Marlboros.

In this conditional sentence, the antecedent is
asymmetrically entailed by the consequent. Fact
(WK2) above means that the WK implication op-
erator expects the MBP of (8) to be Sue used to
smoke Marlboros. This is incorrect, for such an
MBP would entail the antecedent in sentence (8),
with would counter-intuitively treat the sentence
as equivalent to the non-conditional sentence Sue
stopped smoking Marlboros. To avoid this prob-
lem, Karttunen and Peters (1979) and others pro-
posed treatments where the MBP of sentence (8)
is as paraphrased below:

(9) If Sue used to smoke, she used to smoke
Marlboros.

When analyzed as a material implication, this con-
ditional statement is also what fact (SK2) about
Strong Kleene implication expects as the MBP of
sentence (8).

To summarize, while both the WK implication
and the SK implication deal with basic projec-
tion problems, they are facing complementary dif-
ficulties. The WK implication often “projects too
much”, failing to filter out presuppositions in the
consequent, or at least conditionalize them. In
other cases, however, WK implication is advan-
tageous to the conditional presuppositions derived
by the SK implication. These SK-based presuppo-
sitions are often too weak, and lead to the so-called
“proviso problem” for SK implication.

Similar puzzles appear with the other binary
propositional connectives in the Kleene truth ta-
bles. For instance, the WK and SK conjunction
connectives satisfy the following:

(WK3) MBPϕ , ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1
(SK3) MBPϕ , ψ1 � ψ2 � ϕ� ψ1
For instance, with EX, S/SM and US/USM for
“Sue exercises”, “Sue smokes (Marlboros)” and

“Sue used to smoke (Marlboros)”, respectively,
this leads to the following analyses of the sen-
tences below:

(10) Sue exercises a lot and stopped smoking
  Sue used to smoke

by (WK3): MBPEX , US �  S � US
3 (no proviso problem)

by (SK3): MBPEX , US �  S � EX� US
7 (proviso problem)

(11) Sue used to smoke Marlboros and stopped
smoking~  Sue used to smoke
by (WK3): MBPUSM , US �  S � US

7 (no filtering)

by (SK3): MBPUSM , US �  S � USM� US
3 (tautological presupposition, hence filtering)

(12) Sue used to smoke and stopped smoking
Marlboros~  Sue used to smoke Marlboros2

by (WK3): MBPUS , USM �  SM � USM
7 (no filtering or conditional presupposition)

by (SK3): MBPUS , USM �  SM � US� USM
3 (conditional presupposition)

Table 3 summarizes the theoretical puzzle for
the WK and SK connectives. To solve this puz-
zle, we should like a trivalent account of presup-
position projection to avoid proviso-like presup-
positions while allowing presupposition filtering
and conditional presuppositions. This paper pro-
poses such an account, by considering the possi-
bilities that open up once we renounce the truth-
functionality of the WK and SK connectives.

Table 3: Kleene systems and presupposition projection

2To see that Sue used to smoke Marlboros is not sim-
ply presupposed by the sentence in (12), we should look at
sentences where such conjunctions are embedded, as in: if
Sue used to smoke and stopped smoking Marlboros, then she
might be smoking now other brands of cigarettes. This makes
it clear that the statement Sue used to smoke Marlboros is not
projected as a presupposition of the conditional, hence, rea-
sonably, also not of the conjunction that it contains.



2 Kleene systems of intermediate
strength

This section develops two trivalent systems that
on the one hand account for presupposition filter-
ing and conditional presuppositions, and on the
other hand avoid the unnecessarily weak presup-
positions that lead to the “proviso problem” with
SK connectives. This account involves employing
inferential relations between arguments of binary
propositional operators. While such inferences be-
tween operands have occasionally been employed
under various assumptions (Beaver, 1999; Las-
siter, 2012; Mandelkern, 2016), we aim here to
employ them within a purely trivalent semantics
that allows a better insight the role of Kleene con-
nectives in natural language semantics, in search
for a linguistically adequate “intermediate” triva-
lent semantics in between WK and SK.3

2.1 Entailment relations and presupposition
filtering

Let us first reconsider the contrast between
sentences (10) and (11), which are restated below:

(10’) Sue exercises a lot and stopped smoking.

(11’) Sue used to smoke Marlboros and
stopped smoking.

As we saw, sentence (10) intuitively presupposes
that Sue stopped smoking, whereas sentence (11)
does not. This kind of difference in filtering is
often analyzed in terms of whether the presuppo-
sition of the second conjunct is entailed by the first
conjunct (Mandelkern, 2016). In example (11)
the first conjunct Mary used to smoke Marlboros
entails the MBP Sue used to smoke of the second
conjunct. Such an entailment is missing in (10).
These facts are used as the source of filtering in
(11) and the lack thereof in (10).

Formalizing this filtering principle in trivalent
semantics, we get the following restriction on the
interpretation of ϕ , ψ:

3The present modification of Kleene systems is orthogo-
nal to the familiar proposal in (Peters, 1979), where the “in-
termediate” Kleene system is aimed to treat left-right asym-
metries of presupposition projection with binary connectives
(Mandelkern et al., 2017). This kind of asymmetry does
not concern “proviso problems” that result from presuppo-
sitions of the righthand operand, which are the focus of the
present paper. Peters’s asymmetries are introduced in the cur-
rent non-truth-functional proposal (see note 6 below), but if
needed they can also be removed.

(13) Left-to-right filtering in conjunctions ϕ , ψ:

If ϕ�MBPψ, then MBPϕ�MBPϕ , ψ
In words: if the left-hand conjunct ϕ in a con-
junction ϕ,ψ entails the maximal presupposition
of the right-hand conjunct ψ, then that presuppo-
sition gets “filtered out”, i.e. all presuppositions
of ϕ , ψ are inherited from ϕ. In example (11),
the left-hand conjunct (Sue used to smoke) is biva-
lent, hence (13) correctly expects the conjunction
to also be bivalent. This accounts for the “filter-
ing” of the presupposition in the right-hand con-
junct. At the same time, (13) on its own does
not expect filtering in (10), where the entailment
ϕ�MBPψ does not hold.

As illustrated by the WK analysis of sentence
(11) (section 1), WK conjunction does not sat-
isfy the condition in (13), hence its failure to ac-
count for filtering phenomena in such sentences.
By contrast, the following fact about SK conjunc-
tion makes it clear that it does satisfy (13):

(14) ��MBPϕ ,SK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈
¤̈

1 ��MBPϕ��M �1 and ��MBPψ��M �1
or ��ϕ��M �0 or ��ψ��M �0

0 otherwise

Fact (14) about SK conjunction leads to its desir-
able filtering property, but it also leads to proviso
problems as in (10), for there are cases where the
entailment ϕ � MBPψ does not hold, but SK
conjunction admits models where ��ϕ , ψ��M is
bivalent although ��ψ��M � – namely, the models
M where ��ϕ��M �0.

To address these problems of the WK and SK
systems, it is useful to first observe their take on
the following question:

(Q) Let op2 be a bivalent binary propositional op-
erator, and let op3 be the corresponding triva-
lent operator. Which formulas ϕ,ψ and mod-
elsM admit a bivalent value for ��ϕop3ψ��M
when ��ϕ��M � or ��ψ��M �?

The WK system treats the value ‘’ as “nonsense”,
and accordingly, its answer on (Q) is “no formulas,
and no models”.

The SK system treats the value ‘’ as “un-
known”, and uses the fact that certain values of
an argument of a binary function may determine
the result of the function regardless of the value



of the other argument. For the standard biva-
lent connectives, these “decisive values” are 0 for
both operands of conjunction, 1 for both operands
of disjunction, and 0/1 respectively for the left-
hand/righthand operand of implication.4 The an-
swer of the SK system to (Q) may then be ex-
pressed as follows:

(A1) SK’s answer on (Q): All formulas, and any
model where the value ��ϕ��M or ��ψ��M de-
termines the result of op2.
(Motivation: extract as much information as
possible from known values)

The proviso problem demonstrates that for nat-
ural language, the answer in (A1) is too liberal.
The problem lies in the fact that the SK answer al-
lows “saving” a formula ϕop3ψ from having a ‘’
value in some model, with no respect to whether
the formula can also be “saved” in the same way
in other models. Thus, supposing that the second
conjunct in sentence (10) involves a presupposi-
tion failure, we see that SK incorrectly “saves”
the conjunction from failure if the first conjunct
is false. At the same time, SK correctly treats such
a conjunction as a failure in models where the first
conjunct is true. We consider this “global insta-
bility” of the way failures are handled in SK as the
source of the proviso problem. Instead of (A1), we
propose a “globally stable” variant of SK’s answer
to (Q). Since this answer minimally strengthened
WK, we refer to the system on which it is based as
‘WK�’. The “WK� answer” is informally stated
below:

(A2) WK� answer on (Q): Only formulas where
a failure of one operand guarantees that the
other operand also fails, or else has a value
that determines the result of op2.
(Motivation: extract as much information as
possible from known values in formulas that
can be globally saved from failure)

This answer, put informally here, summarizes a
common linguistic intuition about the contrast be-
tween sentences (10) and (11). In sentence (11) it
is guaranteed than whenever the second conjunct
fails, the first conjunct is false. This is the value
that determines the result of bivalent conjunction,
hence can “save” the formula from failing.5 There

4Some bivalent connectives, specifically exclusive dis-
junction, do not have decisive values. For such connectives,
the “WK and SK answers” above give identical results, as
they do for formulas like ϕ - ψ ,  ϕ , ψ.

5Cases where both conjuncts fail are discussed below.

is no such guarantee for sentence (10). Thus, an-
swer (A2) employs the general SK reasoning, but
only for “saving”, or “repairing”, some of the pre-
supposition failures that SK addresses: those fail-
ures that can be globally saved from failing the for-
mula (or, using another metaphor: can be globally
“repaired”).

Following this reasoning, in (15) below we de-
fine a conjunction operator that, like SK conjunc-
tion, satisfies the condition in (13), but without
the general property (14). The operator in (15)
“strengthens” WK conjunction to satisfy property
(13), hence we refer to it as a strengthened WK
(WK�) conjunction operator, which is denoted
‘.WK’:

(15) Conjunction in WK�:
For propositional formulas ϕ and ψ, withM
a class of models andM >M s.t. ��ϕ��M and��ψ��M are inductively specified, we define:

��ϕ .WK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈
¤

��ϕ , ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
��ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�1
 otherwise

The first clause in definition (15) standardly re-
tains bivalent conjunction. The second clause
makes sure to respect the condition (13). 6 An
advantage of the .WK operator over SK conjunc-
tion is the avoidance of proviso problems as in
(10): falsity of ϕ entails falsity of ϕ .WK ψ only
if the condition in the second clause of definition
(15) holds, which is not the case in (10). Formally,
for any bivalent propositions ϕ,ψ1 and ψ2, we ob-
serve the following fact on the WK, WK� and SK
conjunction operators:

6Note that this clause is asymmetric: it makes WK� con-
junction respect the condition in (13), but not the symmetric
condition (if ψ�MBPϕ, then MBPψ�MBPϕ,ψ).
Modifying (15) into a symmetric version is straightforward,
but it is questionable if such left-right symmetry (similar to
that of the SK connectives) would be empirically motivated,
as it would expect right-to-left filtering, which is empiri-
cally dubious (Peters, 1979; Mandelkern et al., 2017). Thus,
to simplify the presentation in this paper, we here only de-
fine operators that derive asymmetric filtering and conditional
presuppositions.



(16) Assuming that ϕ� ψ1, we have:

WK7 MBPϕ ,WK ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1
WK�3 MBPϕ .WK ψ1 � ψ2 � 

(17) Assuming that ϕ ~� ψ1, we have:
SK7 MBPϕ ,SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1
WK�3 MBPϕ .WK ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1

The  symbol standardly refers to the univalent
proposition denoting 1 in all models. In (16), the
‘3’/‘7’ symbols mark the correct/incorrect treat-
ment of filtering in sentences like (11). In (17)
they mark the avoidance/retainment of the proviso
problem in sentences like (10).

A disadvantage of WK� conjunction over SK
conjunction is that the second clause in defi-
nition (15) makes WK� conjunction non-truth-
functional, as it relies on logical relations within
the whole class of modelsM.7

The .WK operator follows the general “repair”
strategy of SK conjunction. When the second
clause in (15) is met, the assignment of the inter-
pretation of ϕ to ��ϕ .WK ψ��M is motivated by the
wish to preserve the following classical property
of bivalent conjunction:

��ϕ��M �0 � ��ϕ , ψ��M �0.
Similarly, the following classical property of ma-
terial implication motivates the treatment of filter-
ing with conditionals as in (7):

��ϕ��M �0 � ��ϕ� ψ��M �1.
With disjunction the motivation is to preserve the
following property:

��ϕ��M �1 � ��ϕ - ψ��M �1.
This motivation is geared by filtering as in the fol-
lowing disjunctive example, which does not pre-
suppose that Sue used to smoke:

(18) Either Sue never smoked Marlboros, or she
stopped smoking.

These considerations about filtering with condi-
tionals and disjunction lead to the following def-

7This drawback of WK� conjunction is shared with other
previous “globalist” accounts of the proviso problem (Las-
siter, 2012; Mandelkern, 2016). If desirable, it might be re-
moved by couching definition (15) within a possible world
semantics, replacing quantification over models by quantifi-
cation over indices in a given model.

initions of the respective WK� operators, in anal-
ogy to (15) above:8

(19) Implication and disjunction in WK�:

��ϕ .�WK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈
¤

��ϕ� ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
�� ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�1
 otherwise

��ϕ /WK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈
¤

��ϕ - ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
��ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�0
 otherwise

Based on the“WK� answer” in (A2) above, the
reasoning behind all these definitions is general,
as is further explored in section 3.

The WK� conjunction operator, as well as WK�

disjunction and implication, also deals with cases
where the first conjunct is not bivalent, as in the
following example:

(20) [Sue stopped drinking but continued to
smoke two Marlboro packs a day], and [now
she has finally also stopped smoking].

Intuitively, sentence (20) presupposes that Sue
used to drink. This requirement holds indepen-
dently of Sue’s smoking habits. Definition (15)
makes sure that the presupposition Sue used to
drink of the first conjunct in (20) gets projected,
despite the filtering of the presupposition Sue used
to smoke of the second conjunct. In general: for
any proposition ϕ that is presupposed by ϕ, we
have ϕ presupposed by ϕ .WK ψ as well.9

8Since the 0 value in the left argument similarly deter-
mines the result of both conjunction and material implica-
tion, the general principle underlying left-to-right filtering
with implication is the same as for conjunction in (13). By
contrast, with disjunction, the 1 value determines the re-
sult, hence the general principle analogous (13) is: if  ϕ �
MBPψ, then MBPϕ�MBPϕ - ψ.

9Proof: LetM be a model where ��ϕ.WKψ��M ~�. Thus,
either clause 1 or 2 of definition (15) is satisfied. Clause 1
trivially entails ��ϕ��M ~�. Clause 2 entails ��ϕ .WK ψ��M �
��ϕ��M , from which we also conclude ��ϕ��M ~� . If ϕ  
ϕ, then in every model M s.t. ��ϕ .WK ψ��M ~� , we have
��ϕ��M �1. We conclude that ϕ .WK ψ  ϕ.



Definitions (15) and (19) quantify over models
in a way that accounts for filtering phenomena as
in the following example (Beaver, 1999) :

(21) If Jane takes a bath, Bill will be annoyed that
there is no more hot water.

As Beaver notes, while the relation between tak-
ing a bath and lack of hot water is by no means
logical, in normal conversations the presupposi-
tion there is no more hot water of the consequent
in (21) gets filtered out. In general, this filtering
is on a par with the filtering phenomena discussed
above, where the relations between conjuncts are
logical. However, there is one empirical caveat: an
entailment ϕ�MBPψ in (13) which is not log-
ical but restricted to a designated class of models
can be explicitly denied in conversation. For in-
stance, when a given context explicitly denies the
relation between taking a bath and lack of hot wa-
ter, filtering in (21) disappears:

(22) The hot water supply in Bill’s place uses gas
heating, so that no single person could pos-
sibly take a bath that would stop the hot wa-
ter supply. At present there’s some prob-
lem with Bill’s heating system. Not knowing
that, Bill suggests Jane, who is staying at his
place, to take a bath whenever she pleases.
If Jane takes a bath, Bill will be annoyed (to
hear from her) that there is no more hot wa-
ter.

Unlike the use of sentence (21) in an out-of-the-
blue context, in the context of (22) sentence (21)
does presuppose that there in no more hot wa-
ter. Thus, due to the explicit denial in (22) of any
causal relation between Jane’s bath and the lack
of hot water, filtering does not take place. Us-
ing a given class of modelsM in definitions (15)
and (19), rather than all possible models, allows
the filtering mechanism to take into account im-
plicit epistemic assumptions, without getting into
the separate question of how these assumptions
should be modeled. A similar point is made in
(Mandelkern, 2016) in relation to a framework of
context-change potentials.

2.2 Conditional presuppositions
The WK� operators defined above do not expect
conditional presuppositions, which were exempli-
fied in sentence (8), restated below:

(8’) If Sue used to smoke, she stopped smoking
Marlboros.

In this case the MBP of the consequent Sue used
to smoke Marlboros asymmetrically entails the an-
tecedent. The second clause in the definition of
the WK� implication operator in (19) does not
hold in such cases. Accordingly, this operator in-
correctly expects the presupposition Sue used to
smoke Marlboros to be projected in (8). Formally,
for any bivalent propositions ϕ,ψ1 and ψ2, we ob-
serve the following fact on the SK and WK� im-
plication operators:

(23) Assuming that ψ1�ϕ and ϕ ~�ψ1, we have:
SK3 MBPϕ�SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1
WK�7 MBPϕ .�WK ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1

The ‘3’/‘7’ symbols mark here the cor-
rect/incorrect modelling of conditional pre-
suppositions in sentences like (8).

Treating this kind of problem has led previous
work to assume that the MBP of sentences like (8)
should be expressed by the following disjunction:

(24) Either Sue never smoked or she used to
smoke Marlboros.

Within a trivalent system, this treatment of (8) is
generalized using the following condition:

(25) Left-to-right conditional presuppositions in
implications ϕ� ψ:

If MBPψ� ϕ, then:
 ϕ - MBPϕ ,MBPψ�MBPϕ� ψ.

In words: when the MBP of the consequent ψ
in ϕ � ψ entails the antecedent ϕ, the negation
of ϕ satisfies the MBP of ϕ � ψ, as a possible
alternative to the straightforward WK-based pre-
supposition MBPϕ , MBPψ. Principle (25)
correctly makes the disjunction in (24) entail the
MBP of sentence (8), as expected by the Strong
Kleene system. Indeed, SK implication satisfies
(25). However, as in relation to presupposition
filtering, this treatment of conditional presuppo-
sitions comes at the cost of leading to the proviso
problem.

A simple trivalent extension of WK� derives
some of the most typical conditional presupposi-
tions that were addressed in the literature.10 We

10There are empirical questions on whether conditional
presuppositions are needed at all (Mandelkern, 2016). On
the other hand, there are also empirical questions on whether
principle (25) can cover all conditional presuppositions
(Schlenker, 2011). For space and time limitations I ignore



refer to this extension as weakened SK (SK�), and
base its behavior on the following answer to ques-
tion (Q) above regarding the formulas that allow a
repair of a presupposition failure:

(A3) SK� answer on (Q): Only formulas as in
WK� (cf. (A2)) as well as formulas where if
one operand has a value that determines the
result of op2, the other operand fails.
(Motivation: as in (A2), plus the additional
motivation to extract information from a sin-
gle known value only when this is globally
required in order to save a formula from a
failure)

Minimal strengthening of the ‘ .�WK’ opera-
tor using this principle leads to the following
operator, which we denote ‘ .�SK’:

(26) Implication in SK�:
For propositional formulas ϕ and ψ, withM
a class of models andM >M s.t. ��ϕ��M and��ψ��M are inductively specified, we define:

��ϕ .�SK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈¤

��ϕ� ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
�� ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�1
or
��ϕ��M  ~�1 and ¦M  >M:
if ��ϕ��M  ~�1 then ��ψ��M �

 otherwise

This definition of SK� implication agrees with
SK implication on conditional presuppositions for
sentences like (8), but, like WK� and unlike SK,
does not generate proviso problems. Formally, for
any bivalent propositions ϕ,ψ1 and ψ2, we have:

(27) a. Filtering – if ϕ� ψ1:
SK3: MBPϕ�SK ψ1 � ψ2 � 
SK�3: MBPϕ .�SK ψ1 � ψ2 � 

these questions here. I believe that further linguistic work is
needed in order to determine if conditional presuppositions,
or certain types thereof, should be semantically derived. The
SK� system is only presented here as one natural extension
of WK�, with no claims for empirical comprehensiveness.

b. Cond.Pres. – if ψ1 � ϕ:
SK3: MBPϕ�SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1
SK�3: MBPϕ .�SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1

c. No Proviso – if ϕ ~� ψ1 and ψ1 ~� ϕ:
SK7: MBPϕ�SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1
SK�3: MBPϕ .�SK ψ1 � ψ2 � ψ1

This establishes that in cases like (8), SK� impli-
cation shows the desirable properties of SK impli-
cation, without the undesirable proviso problem.

The way in which definition (26) quantifies over
models accounts for conditional presuppositions
that are not triggered by logical entailment, but
only due to contextually salient inferential rela-
tions, similarly to filtering in sentence (21). For
instance, according to (Schlenker, 2011), sentence
(28) below has the presupposition in (29):

(28) If John visits his parents for Christmas, his
sister too will give them hard time.

(29) If John visits his parents for Christmas,
someone (namely John) will give them hard
time.

This presupposition is treated here by assuming a
contextual entailment from John visits his parents
for Christmas to someone will give John’s parents
a hard time, which is of course far from being a
logical entailment.

The reasoning behind the definition of SK� im-
plication is also used in the following definitions
of conjunction and disjunction:

(30) Conjunction and disjunction in SK�:

��ϕ .SK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈¤

��ϕ , ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
��ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�1
or
��ϕ��M  ~�1 and ¦M  >M:
if ��ϕ��M  ~�1 then ��ψ��M �

 otherwise



��ϕ /SK ψ��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈¤

��ϕ - ψ��M ��ϕ��M ~� and ��ψ��M ~�
��ϕ��M ��ψ��M � and ¦M  >M:

if ��ψ��M � then ��ϕ��M  ~�0
or
��ϕ��M  ~�0 and ¦M  >M:
if ��ϕ��M  ~�0 then ��ψ��M �

 otherwise

Similarly to SK� implication, these conjunction
and disjunction operators admit conditional pre-
suppositions while avoiding the proviso problem.
Thus, when ϕ, ψ1 and ψ2 are bivalent, we get:

If ψ1 � ϕ: MBPϕ .SK ψ1 � ψ2 �  ϕ - ψ1.
If ψ1 �  ϕ: MBPϕ /SK ψ1 � ψ2 � ϕ - ψ1.
2.3 Summary
We have defined two sets of binary operators, re-
ferred to as ‘WK�’ and ‘SK�’, which satisfy the
following, for any operator op and trivalent propo-
sitions ϕ and ψ:

MBPϕopWKψ � MBPϕopWK� ψ
� MBPϕopSK� ψ � MBPϕopSKψ

Further, we have shown (wit. (27c), (23), (16)):

MBPϕopSKψ ~� MBPϕopSK� ψ
~� MBPϕopWK� ψ ~� MBPϕopWKψ

This describes a hierarchy where SK/WK opera-
tors derive the weakest/strongest presuppositions,
respectively. Equivalently, and more in line with
common nomenclature, Strong Kleene operators
have the strongest “failure conditions” (the nega-
tion of their MBPs) whereas the failure conditions
of Weak Kleene operators are the weakest. In
terms of this “strength”, the WK� and SK� op-
erators are properly in between the two classical
Kleene connectives.

3 Repair and value determination with
general binary functions

The key to the proposal in section 2 is in the gen-
eral specification of “repair” conditions for fail-
ures in propositional arguments. These are princi-
ples that specify the situations under which a pre-
supposition failure in one of a binary function’s
arguments may still allow the function to return a
value. Following (George, 2008, 2014), we aim to
make the reasoning behind our proposal more ex-

plicit by generalizing it to arbitrary functions. Un-
like George’s work, we do not necessarily seek to
generalize the Strong Kleene connectives, which
lead to the proviso problem, but rather to avoid
this problem using intermediate levels of presup-
position projection as in the WK� and the SK� op-
erators. This section generalizes these operators to
arbitrary binary functions.

Given a set X ` E and an element  in E �X ,
we denote X � X 8 . Following (de Groote
and Lebedeva, 2010), we view presupposition fail-
ure () as an “exception”, which should be opti-
mally “handled” or “repaired”. A repair strategy
α is a method for defining fα � A �B � C
for any given binary function f � A �B� C.

The Weak Kleene strategy is “no repair”. Thus,
fWK � A �B� C is defined by:
(31) fWKx, y �

 fx, y x > A and y > B
 x� or y�

By contrast, Strong Kleene is based on a “maximal
repair” strategy. A function f SK � A�B� C
is capable of “repairing” failures of its left/right
whenever the result of f can be determined by the
value of the right/left argument alone, respectively.
This notion of left/right (L/R) determination is de-
fined as follows:

Definition 3.1. For any function f � A�B� C
and value c > C, we say that:

A value a > A L-determines f as c if ¦y >
B.fa, y � c
A value b > B R-determines f as c if ¦x >
A.fx, b � c
Using the notion of L-determination, we define the
L-determination function LDf � A � C of a
function f � A �B� C as follows:
(32) LDfx �

 c x > A and x L-determines f as c
 otherwise

Symmetrically, the R-determination function
RDf � B � C of f is defined by:

(33) RDfy �
 c y > B and y R-determines f as c
 otherwise

Bivalent conjunction, disjunction and implication
satisfy:



LD,0 � RD,0 �0 LD,1 � RD,1 �
LD-1 � RD-1 �1 LD-0 � RD-0 �
LD
�
0� RD

�
1�1 LD

�
1� RD

�
0�

Using the LD and RD functions, we define a
Strong Kleene function f SK � A � B � C
for any binary function f � A �B� C:

(34) f SKx, y �¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈¤

fx, y x > A and y > B
c c > C and LDfx � c

or RDfy � c
 otherwise

It will be observed that the standard WK/SK con-
nectives (tables 1 and 2) apply the respective re-
pair strategies (31)/(34) to the bivalent connec-
tives. Like their propositional instantiations in the
Kleene tables, the more general strategies (31) and
(34) are “local” in that for given values x and
y, they completely determine the value fαx, y
based on f , x and y. By contrast, the WK� and
SK� operators of section 2 rely on entailments be-
tween propositional formulas, hence they are not
local in this sense (as mentioned above, the WK�

and SK� operators are not truth-functional).

In order to compare the WK and SK strategies
(31) and (34) to global generalizations of the WK�

and SK� operators, we first define global versions
of the former. Let M be a model over expres-
sions within a type system for n-place functions
and products (e.g. van Benthem (1991)). For any
type τ , we standardly denote DMτ for the domain
of values of type τ in M , allowing partial func-
tion values. For any such type and model, we as-
sume that the exceptional value  is not in DMτ ,
and denote DM



τ � DMτ . For an expression
exp of type τ , we need to specify an element of
DM



τ as the denotation of exp. This element is de-
noted ��exp��M. Globalizing the WK and SK re-
pair strategies above, we assume that F is a binary
function expression of type a Ybc, and exp1 and
exp2 are expressions of type a and b, respectively.
We assume by induction that for every model
M >M: ��F ��M >DMaYbc, ��exp��M>DMa  and��exp��M>DMb .
Definition 3.2. The global WK and SK strate-

gies for ��F exp1, exp2��M are defined by:
��F WKexp1, exp2��M �
��F ��MWK��exp1��M , ��exp2��M

��F SKexp1, exp2��M �
��F ��MSK��exp1��M , ��exp2��M

For example, let ‘mult’ denote a the standard
binary multiplication operator over real number
expressions, and let ‘~’ denote the standard par-
tial division operator over real number expres-
sions. Let ��1~r��M be inductively specified as 
in models M where ��r��M � 0. Considering
the Kleene-repaired expression multαr,1~r,
we observe that any model M s.t. ��r��M �
0 satisfies ��multWKr,1~r��M �  whereas��multSKr,1~r��M � 0.

Generalizing the and WK� and SK� operators
of section 2 involves considering the global strate-
gies they employ. In such global strategies, we
need to classify which expressions F exp1, exp2
are “repairable” in cases of failure of exp2. This
classification depends on the denotations of F ,
exp1 and exp2 in different models. We start out
with generalizing the WK� operators. Definition
3.3 below specifies the conditions under which the
WK� strategy is allowed to “repair” failures of
exp2. As in definition 3.2, we are given a binary
function expression F of type aYbc, and expres-
sions exp1 and exp2 of type a and b, respectively,
s.t. for every model M >M: ��F ��M > DMaYbc,��exp��M >DMa  and ��exp��M >DMb .
Definition 3.3. Given a class of modelsM, let c >
�M>MD

M
c , and suppose that every modelM >M

where ��exp2��M � and ��exp1��M ~� satisfies:
LD��F ��M ��exp1��M � c. Then we say that the
expression F exp1, exp2 is R-repairable as c.
In words: an expression F exp1, exp2 is R-
repairable when there is a value c of type c
shared by all models, and for all models, c is L-
determined by the value of exp1 for F whenever
exp2 fails and exp1 does not.

11

Example 1: Let us again consider the expression
multr,1~r. The expression 1~r denotes  pre-
cisely in those models where the value of r is 0,
which L-determines the result of mult as 0. Thus,
multr,1~r is R-repairable with respect to stan-

11For the sake of presentation, this condition is stronger
than necessary: we might as well require the value c to only
be shared by models where exp2 fails and exp1 does not.



dard models of the real numbers.

Example 2: Let us consider the expression
F r,ºr over the real numbers, where F x, y
is defined by 0 for x � �3 and by x � y other-
wise. In models where r � �3, this is the value
of the left-hand argument of the expression F ,
which L-determines the result of the function that
F denotes. Accordingly, for r � �3 the value of
F SKr,ºr is 0, which repairs the failure of ºr.
However, since the expression

º
r fails for all neg-

ative values of r other than �3, and these values
do not L-determine the value of F , the expression
F r,ºr is not generally R-repairable.

Example 2 highlights a general difference be-
tween the SK repair strategy and the WK� repair
strategy employed in section 2. The SK connec-
tives deal with failures of the right-hand value in
all models where the value of the left-hand value
L-determines the result. By contrast, the WK� op-
erators only deal with failures of the right-hand
argument as long as any such failure entails that
the value of the left-hand argument L-determines
the result. Thus, our propositional WK� opera-
tors only deal with failures of ψ formulas in R-
repairable formulas of the form ϕ op ψ. To gen-
eralize this WK� strategy, we again let F be a bi-
nary function expression of type a Y bc, and let
exp1 and exp2 be expressions of type a and b, re-
spectively. We assume by induction that for every
model M >M: ��F ��M > DMaYbc, ��exp��M >
DMa



and ��exp��M >DMb .
Definition 3.4. The (global) WK� strategy for��F exp1, exp2��M is defined by:
��F WK�exp1, exp2��M �
¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈¤

��F exp1, exp2��M��exp1��M ~� and ��exp2��M ~�
c LD��F ��M ��exp1��M � c > �M>MDMc

and F exp1, exp2 is R-repairable as c
 otherwise

The propositional WK� operators of section 2 are
instances of definition 3.4, which is also applica-
ble to binary functions more generally. For in-
stance, based on the facts in examples 1 and 2
above, we conclude that multWK

�r,1~r � 0
when r � 0, but FWK

�r,ºr �  when r � �3,
in contrast with F SKr,ºr � 0. This is by virtue

of the R-reparability of multr,1~r and the non-
R-reparability of F r,ºr.

The generalization of the SK� operators of
section 2 is similarly obtained, by reversing
the direction of the implication in the definition
of R-reparability. We call this notion anti-R-
reparability and define it as follows:

Definition 3.5. Given a class of modelsM, let c >
�M>MD

M
c , and suppose that every model where

LD��F ��M ��exp1��M � c, we have ��exp2��M �
. Then we say that the expression F exp1, exp2
is anti-R-repairable as c.

In words: an expression F exp1, exp2 is anti-R-
repairable when there is a value c of type c shared
by all models, and in all models where c is L-
determined by exp1 for F , the evaluation of exp2
fails.

The expression F r,ºr of example 2 above
is an instance of an anti-R-repairable expression,
for the only value of r that L-determines the value
of this expression, namely r � �3, fails the right-
hand argument.

In the following definition we use the notion of
anti-R-reparability to generalize the SK� strategy.

Definition 3.6. The (global) SK� strategy for��F exp1, exp2��M is defined by:
��F SK�exp1, exp2��M �¢̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈
¦̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈̈
¨̈̈̈̈
¤

��F exp1, exp2��M��exp1��M ~� and ��exp2��M ~�
c LD��F ��M ��exp1��M � c > �M>MDMc

and F exp1, exp2 is R-repairable as c
or anti-R-repairable as c

 otherwise

Definition 3.6 adds to definition 3.4 the possi-
bility that the expression F exp1, exp2 is anti-
R-repealable. The propositional SK� operators of
section 2 are instances of definition 3.6, which is
also applicable to binary functions more generally.
For instance, the expression F r,ºr in example
2 satisfies F SK

�r,ºr � 0 when r � �3. Still,
in terms of its repair potential, the SK� strategy
is weaker than the SK strategy. The following ex-
ample illustrates that with a non-propositional ex-
pression.

Example 3: Let us consider the expression
Gr,ºs, where Gx, y is defined by 0 for x @ 0
and by x � y otherwise. In models where r � �5
and s � �3, the value of the left-hand argument



(�5) L-determines the value of G. Accordingly,
when r � �5 and s � �3, the value of GSKr,ºs
is 0 despite the failure of

º
s.12 By contrast, there

are models where the expression
º
s fails and r is

positive, hence does not L-determine the value of
G. Conversely, there are also models where the ex-
pression

º
s does not fail and r is negative, hence

L-determines the value of G. This means that the
expression Gr,ºs is neither R-repairable nor
anti-R-repairable. As a result, in models where
r � �5 and s � �3, the expression GSK

�r,ºs
fails, unlike its SK parallel.

From the definitions above and examples 1-3
we conclude that the more general repair strategies
for binary functions show the same hierarchy that
we pointed out for the propositional connectives:
the SK strategy is the most general repair strategy,
WK allows no repair, whereas the repair strategies
of WK� and SK� are properly in between these
two extremes.

4 Concluding remarks

This paper proposed new binary operators on
truth-value denoting expressions, which, unlike
the Weak Kleene connectives, allow filtering and
conditional presuppositions, and unlike the Strong
Kleene connectives, do not face the “proviso”
problem. We defined asymmetric operators that
allow left-to-right filtering (the “Weak Kleene
plus” operators) as well as conditional presupposi-
tions (the “Strong Kleene minus” operators) with-
out proviso-like problems. These operators were
generalized for arbitrary binary function expres-
sions, which reveals the centrality of values that
left/right-determine the result of a function for the
treatment of presupposition projection in trivalent
semantics.

One last note is in place about the special sta-
tus of Strong Kleene (SK) connectives in the treat-
ment of the third truth-value . As has been previ-
ously observed (Muskens, 1995; Beaver and Krah-
mer, 2001), SK conjunction and disjunction are
greatest lower bound and least upper bound opera-
tors, respectively, with respect to the less-or-equal
partial order, where ‘1’ and ‘0’ are treated numer-
ically and ‘’ is treated numerically as ½. This

12We may consider this kind of case as an illustration of
a “proviso problem” for non-propositional binary functions:
L-determination by the left-hand argument guarantees a suc-
cessful evaluation of the function in cases when its right-hand
argument fails, even if that failure is logically unrelated to L-
determination.

gives the following lattice structure in SK trivalent
logic (see Fitting (1991) for generalizations):

When it comes to theories of presupposition pro-
jection, this formal elegance has an empirical
price: the SK-based partial order is a proper subset
of the order determined by the Tarskian notion of
entailment (Keenan, 1973; Beaver, 1997) in defi-
nition 1.1. Tarskian entailment in trivalent seman-
tics supports the following preorder:

Importantly, when it comes to entailment in natu-
ral language there is reason to prefer the Tarskian
preorder to the SK partial order. For instance, the
sentence Sue has stopped shouting intuitively en-
tails the sentence Sue is not shouting, but the for-
mer can denote ‘’ while the latter denotes ‘0’
(e.g. in situations where Sue has just started shout-
ing). This indicates that the preorder determined
by the Tarskian condition is advantageous to the
SK-based partial order as a basis for a trivalent
semantics of presuppositions. The 0 and  val-
ues are distinguished by their projection but no
by their support of entailment relations. This is
expected by the Tarskian preorder and not by the
SK partial order. Thus, although the SK truth ta-
bles are logically natural, and indeed have led to
interesting logical results, their modelling of the
 value as “unknown” or “in between 0 and 1”
is the source of their proviso problem when used
for meanings of natural language operators. A lin-
guistically more adequate view ensues from treat-
ing the  value as a “failure” or an “exception” as
in the Weak Kleene connectives or (de Groote and
Lebedeva, 2010). This requires further inquiries
into intermediate systems like the WK� or SK�

operators that were studied above. These opera-
tors sacrifice truth-functionality – or, more gener-
ally, locality or at least extensionality – but model
filtering and conditional presuppositions similarly
to the Strong Kleene connectives, without running
into their well-known problems.
