Abstract

Pre-trained embeddings such as word embed-
dings and sentence embeddings are fundamen-
tal tools facilitating a wide range of down-
stream NLP tasks. In this work, we investigate
how to learn a general-purpose embedding of
textual relations, defined as the shortest de-
pendency path between entities. Textual rela-
tion embedding provides a level of knowledge
between word/phrase level and sentence level,
and we show that it can facilitate downstream
tasks requiring relational understanding of the
text. To learn such an embedding, we cre-
ate the largest distant supervision dataset by
linking the entire English ClueWeb09 corpus
to Freebase. We use global co-occurrence
statistics between textual and knowledge base
relations as the supervision signal to train
the embedding. Evaluation on two relational
understanding tasks demonstrates the useful-
ness of the learned textual relation embed-
ding. The data and code can be found at

1 Introduction

Pre-trained embeddings such as word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014;
Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018) and sen-
tence embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Kiros
et al., 2015) have become fundamental NLP tools.
Learned with large-scale (e.g., up to 800 billion to-
kens (Pennington et al., 2014)) open-domain cor-
pora, such embeddings serve as a good prior for
a wide range of downstream tasks by endowing
task-specific models with general lexical, syntac-
tic, and semantic knowledge.

Inspecting the spectrum of granularity, a repre-
sentation between lexical (and phrasal) level and
sentence level is missing. Many tasks require rela-
tional understanding of the entities mentioned in
the text, e.g., relation extraction and knowledge
base completion. Textual relation (Bunescu and

Mooney, 2005), defined as the shortest path be-
tween two entities in the dependency parse tree
of a sentence, has been widely shown to be the
main bearer of relational information in text and
proved effective in relation extraction tasks (Xu
et al., 2015; Su et al., 2018). If we can learn a
general-purpose embedding for textual relations,
it may facilitate many downstream relational un-
derstanding tasks by providing general relational
knowledge.

Similar to language modeling for learning
general-purpose word embeddings, distant super-
vision (Mintz et al., 2009) is a promising way
to acquire supervision, at no cost, for training
general-purpose embedding of textual relations.
Recently Su et al. (2018) propose to lever-
age global co-occurrence statistics of textual and
KB relations to learn embeddings of textual re-
lations, and show that it can effectively combat
the wrong labeling problem of distant supervision
(see Figure 1 for example). While their method,
named GloRE, achieves the state-of-the-art per-
formance on the popular New York Times (NYT)
dataset (Riedel et al., 2010), the scope of their
study is limited to relation extraction with small-
scale in-domain training data.

In this work, we take the GloRE approach
further and apply it to large-scale, domain-
independent data labeled with distant supervision,
with the goal of learning general-purpose textual
relation embeddings. Specifically, we create the
largest ever distant supervision dataset by linking
the entire English ClueWeb09 corpus (half a bil-
lion of web documents) to the latest version of
Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), which contains
45 million entities and 3 billion relational facts.
After filtering, we get a dataset with over 5 million
unique textual relations and around 9 million co-
occurring textual and KB relation pairs. We then
train textual relation embedding on the collected

dataset in a way similar to (Su et al., 2018), but
using Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) instead
of vanilla RNN as the encoder for better training
efficiency.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the learned
textual relation embedding, we experiment on
two relational understanding tasks, relation ex-
traction and knowledge base completion. For re-
lation extraction, we use the embedding to aug-
ment PCNN+ATT (Lin et al., 2016) and improve
the precision for top 1000 predictions from 83.9%
to 89.8%. For knowledge base completion, we
replace the neural network in (Toutanova et al.,
2015) with our pre-trained embedding followed by
a simple projection layer, and gain improvements
on both MRR and HITS@10 measures. Our major
contributions are summarized as following:

• We propose the novel task of learning
general-purpose embedding of textual rela-
tions, which has the potential to facilitate a
wide range of relational understanding tasks.

• To learn such an embedding, we create the
largest distant supervision dataset by linking
the entire English ClueWeb09 corpus to Free-
base. The dataset is publicly available1.

• Based on the global co-occurrence statistics
of textual and KB relations, we learn a textual
relation embedding on the collected dataset
and demonstrate its usefulness on relational
understanding tasks.

2 Related Work

Distant supervision methods (Mintz et al., 2009)
for relation extraction have been studied by a num-
ber of works (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al.,
2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2015; Lin
et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017). (Su
et al., 2018) use global co-occurrence statistics of

1https://github.com/czyssrs/GloREPlus

textual and KB relations to effectively combat the
wrong labeling problem. But the global statistics
in their work is limited to NYT dataset, capturing
domain-specific distributions.

Another line of research that relates to ours is
the universal schema (Riedel et al., 2013) for re-
lation extraction, KB completion, as well as its
extensions (Toutanova et al., 2015; Verga et al.,
2016). Wrong labeling problem still exists since
their embedding is learned based on individual re-
lation facts. In contrast, we use the global co-
occurrence statistics as explicit supervision signal.

3 Textual Relation Embedding

In this section, we describe how to collect large-
scale data via distant supervision (§3.1) and train
the textual relation embedding (§3.2).

3.1 Global Co-Occurrence Statistics from
Distant Supervision

To construct a large-scale distant supervision
dataset, we first get the English ClueWeb09
corpus (Callan et al., 2009), which contains
500 million web documents. We employ the
FACC1 dataset (Gabrilovich et al., 2013) to map
ClueWeb09 to Freebase. We identify over 5 billion
entity mentions in ClueWeb09 and link them to
Freebase entities. From the linked documents, we
extract 155 million sentences containing at least
two entity mentions. We then use the Stanford
Parser (Chen and Manning, 2014) with universal
dependencies to extract textual relations (short-
est dependency paths) between each pair of en-
tity mentions2, leading to 788 million relational
triples (subject, textual relation, object), of which
451 million are unique.

Following (Su et al., 2018), we then collect the
global co-occurrence statistics of textual and KB
relations. More specifically, for a relational triple
(e1, t, e2) with textual relation t, if (e1, r, e2) with

2To be more precise, only shortest dependency paths with-
out any other entity on the path are extracted.

KB relation r exists in the KB, then we count it
as a co-occurrence of t and r. We count the to-
tal number of co-occurrences of each pair of tex-
tual and KB relation across the entire corpus. We
then normalize the global co-occurrence statistics
such that each textual relation has a valid proba-
bility distribution over all the KB relations, which
presumably captures the semantics of the textual
relation. In the end, a bipartite relation graph is
constructed, with one node set being the textual re-
lations, the other node set being the KB relations,
and the weighted edges representing the normal-
ized global co-occurrence statistics.

Filtering. When aligning the text corpus with the
KB, we apply a number of filters to ensure data
quality and training efficiency: (1) We only use
the KB relations in Freebase Commons, 70 do-
mains that are manually verified to be of release
quality. (2) Only textual relations with the num-
ber of tokens (including both lexical tokens and
dependency relations) less than or equal to 10 are
kept. (3) Only non-symmetric textual relations are
kept, because symmetric ones are typically from
conjunctions like ”and” or ”or”, which are less of
interest. (4) Only textual relations with at least two
occurrences are kept. After filtering, we end up
with a relation graph with 5,559,176 unique tex-
tual relations, 1,925 knowledge base (KB) rela-
tions, and 8,825,731 edges with non-zero weight.
It is worth noting that these filters are very conser-
vative, and we can easily increase the scale of data
by relaxing some of the filters.

3.2 Embedding Training

Considering both effectiveness and efficiency, we
employ the Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al.,
2017) to learn the textual relation embedding.
It has been shown to excel at learning general-
purpose representations (Devlin et al., 2018).

The embedded textual relation token sequence
is fed as input. For example, for the textual rela-

tion
dobj←−− founded nsubj−−−→, the input is the em-

bedded sequence of {< −dobj >, founded,<
nsubj >}. We project the output of the encoder
to a vector z as the result embedding. Given a
textual relation ti and its embedding zi, denote
{r1, r2, ..., rn} as all KB relations, and p̃(rj |ti) as
the global co-occurrence distribution, the weight
of the edge between textual relation ti and KB re-
lation rj in the relation graph. The training objec-

tive is to minimize the cross-entropy loss:

L = −
∑
i,j

p̃(rj |ti)log(p(rj |ti)), (1)
Where

p(rj |ti) = (softmax(Wzi + b))j . (2)
W and b are trainable parameters.

We use the filtered relation graph in §3.1 as our
training data. To guarantee that the model gen-
eralizes to unseen textual relations, we take 5%
of the training data as validation set. Word em-
beddings are initialized with the GloVe (Penning-
ton et al., 2014) vectors3. Dependency relation
embeddings are initialized randomly. For the
Transformer model, we use 6 layers and 6 atten-
tion heads for each layer. We use the Adam opti-
mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with parameter set-
tings suggested by the original Transformer pa-
per (Vaswani et al., 2017). We train a maximum
number of 200 epochs and take the checkpoint
with minimum validation loss for the result.

We also compare with using vanilla RNN in
GloRE (Su et al., 2018). Denote the embedding
trained with Tranformer as GloRE++, standing for
both new data and different model, and with RNN
as GloRE+, standing for new data. We observe
that, in the early stage of training, the validation
loss of RNN decreases faster than Transformer.
However, it starts to overfit soon.

4 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the usefulness of the
learned textual relation embedding on two popu-
lar relational understanding tasks, relation extrac-
tion and knowledge base completion. We do not
fine-tune the embedding, and only use in-domain
data to train a single feedforward layer to project
the embedding to the target relations of the do-
main. We compare this with models that are
specifically designed for those tasks and trained
using in-domain data. If we can achieve com-
parable or better results, it demonstrates that the
general-purpose embedding captures useful infor-
mation for downstream tasks.

4.1 Relation Extraction
We experiment on the popular New York Times
(NYT) relation extraction dataset (Riedel et al.,
2010). Following GloRE (Su et al., 2018), we aim
at augmenting existing relation extractors with the
textual relation embeddings. We first average the

textual relation embeddings of all contextual sen-
tences of an entity pair, and project the average
embedding to the target KB relations. We then
construct an ensemble model by a weighted com-
bination of predictions from the base model and
the textual relation embedding.

Same as (Su et al., 2018), we use PCNN+ATT
(Lin et al., 2016) as our base model. GloRE++
improves its best F1-score from 42.7% to 45.2%,
slightly outperforming the previous state-of-the-
art (GloRE, 44.7%). As shown in previous work
(Su et al., 2018), on NYT dataset, due to a signif-
icant amount of false negatives, the PR curve on
the held-out set may not be an accurate measure
of performance. Therefore, we mainly employ
manual evaluation. We invite graduate students
to check top 1000 predictions of each method.
They are present with the entity pair, the predic-
tion, and all the contextual sentences of the entity
pair. Each prediction is examined by two students
until reaching an agreement after discussion. Be-
sides, the students are not aware of the source of
the predictions. Table 1 shows the manual eval-
uation results. Both GloRE+ and GloRE++ get
improvements over GloRE. GloRE++ obtains the
best results for top 700, 900 and 1000 predictions.

4.2 Knowledge Base Completion

We experiment on another relational understand-
ing task, knowledge base (KB) completion, on
the popular FB15k-237 dataset (Toutanova et al.,
2015). The goal is to predict missing relation facts
based on a set of known entities, KB relations, and
textual mentions. (Toutanova et al., 2015) use a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to model tex-
tual relations. We replace their CNN with our pre-
trained embedding followed by one simple feed-
forward projection layer.

As in (Toutanova et al., 2015), we use the best
performing DISTMULT and E+DISTMULT as the
base models. DISTMULT (Yang et al., 2015)
learns latent vectors for the entities and each re-
lation type, while model E (Riedel et al., 2013)

learns two latent vectors for each relation type, as-
sociated with its subject and object entities respec-
tively. E+DISTMULT is a combination model that
ensembles the predictions from individual models,
and is trained jointly. We conduct experiments us-
ing only KB relations (KB only), using their CNN
to model textual relations (Conv), and using our
embedding to model textual relations (Emb).

The models are tested on predicting the object
entities of a set of KB triples disjoint from the
training set, given the subject entity and the rela-
tion type. Table 2 shows the performances of all
models measured by mean reciprocal rank (MRR)
of the correct entity, and HITS@10 (the percent-
age of test instances for which the correct en-
tity is ranked within the top 10 predictions). We
also show the performances on the two subsets
of the test set, with and without textual mentions.
The pre-trained embedding achieves comparable
or better results to the CNN model trained with in-
domain data.

we apply t-SNE visualization (Maaten and Hinton,
2008) on the learned embedding of ClueWeb vali-
dation set.

We filter out infrequent textual relations and as-
sign labels to the textual relations when they co-
occur more than half of the times with a KB rela-
tion. The visualization result of GloRE++ embed-
ding associating with the top-10 frequent KB rela-
tions is shown in Figure 2. As we can see, sim-
ilar textual relations are grouped together while
dissimilar ones are separated. This implies that
the embedding model can well generate textual re-
lation representation for unseen textual relations,
and can potentially serve as relational features to
help tasks in unsupervised setting.

Case Study To show that the embedding model
generalizes to unseen textual relations via captur-
ing crucial textual sub-patterns, we randomly pick
some textual relations in NYT train set but not
in ClueWeb train set, and compare with its top-
5 nearest neighbors in ClueWeb train set, based on
the similarity of the learned embedding. A case
study is shown in Table 3. We can see that the
KB relation place of birth often collocates with a
preposition in indicating the object fits into a lo-
cation type, and some key words like born. To-

gether, the sub-structure born in serves as a strong
indicator for place of birth relation. There is al-
most always some redundant information in the
textual relations, for example in the textual rela-

tion
nsubjpass←−−−−−− born nmod:on−−−−−→ nov. nmod:in−−−−−→, the

sub-structure nmod:on−−−−−→ nov. does not carry crucial
information indicating the target relation. A good
textual relation embedding model should be capa-
ble of learning to attend to the crucial semantic
patterns.
