Abstract

We study the problem of domain adaptation
for neural abstractive summarization. We
make initial efforts in investigating what in-
formation can be transferred to a new domain.
Experimental results on news stories and opin-
ion articles indicate that neural summariza-
tion model benefits from pre-training based on
extractive summaries. We also find that the
combination of in-domain and out-of-domain
setup yields better summaries when in-domain
data is insufficient. Further analysis shows
that, the model is capable to select salient con-
tent even trained on out-of-domain data, but
requires in-domain data to capture the style for
a target domain.

1 Introduction

Recent text summarization research moves to-
wards producing abstractive summmaries, which
better emulates human summarization process
and produces more concise summaries (Nenkova
et al., 2011). Built on the success of sequence-
to-sequence learning with encoder-decoder neu-
ral networks (Bahdanau et al., 2014), there has
been growing interest in utilizing this framework
for generating abstractive summaries (Rush et al.,
2015; Wang and Ling, 2016; Takase et al., 2016;
Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017). The
end-to-end learning framework circumvents ef-
forts in feature engineering and template construc-
tion as done in previous work (Ganesan et al.,
2010; Wang and Cardie, 2013; Gerani et al., 2014;
Pighin et al., 2014), by directly learning to detect
summary-worthy content as well as generate flu-
ent sentences.

Nevertheless, training such systems requires
large amounts of labeled data, which creates a
big hurdle for new domains where training data is
scant and expensive to acquire. Consequently, we
raise the following research questions:

Input (News):The Department of Defense has identi-
fied 441 American service members who have died
since the start of the Iraq war. It confirmed the
death of the following American yesterday: DAVIS,
Raphael S., 24, specialist, Army National Guard;
Tutwiler, Miss.; 223rd Engineer Battalion.
Abstract: Name of American newly confirmed dead
in Iraq ; 441 American service members have died
since start of war.
Input (Opinion): WHEN the 1999 United States Ry-
der Cup team trailed the Europeans, 10-6, going into
Sunday’s 12 singles matches at the Country Club out-
side Boston, Ben Crenshaw, the United States cap-
tain, issued a declaration of confidence in his golfers.
“I’m a big believer in faith ,” Crenshaw said firmly
in his Texas twang . “ I have a good feeling about
this.” The next day , Crenshaw’ cavalry won the firsts
even singles matches. With a sudden 13-10 lead ,
the turnaround put unexpected pressure on the Euro-
peans, . . .

umn discusses US team’s poor performance against
Europe in Ryder Cup.

• domain adaptation: whether we can lever-
age available out-of-domain abstracts or extractive
summaries to help train a neural summarization
system for a new domain?
• transferable component: what information is

transferable and what are the limitations?
In this paper, we attempt to shed some light on

the above questions by investigating neural sum-
marization on two types of documents with major
difference: news stories and opinion articles from
The New York Times Annotated Corpus (Sand-
haus, 2008). Sample articles and human written
abstracts are shown in Figure 1. We select a rea-
sonably simple task on generating short news sum-
mary for multi-paragraph documents.

Contributions. We first investigate the effect of
parameter initialization via pre-training on extrac-
tive summaries. A large-scale dataset consisting
of 1 million article-extract pairs is collected from
The New York Times for use. Experimental results
show that this step improves summarization per-
formance measured by ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

We then treat news stories as source domain and
opinion articles as target domain, and make ini-
tial tries for understanding the feasibility of do-
main adaptation. Importantly, by testing on opin-
ion article summarization, the model leveraging
data from both source and target domains yields
better performance than in-domain trained model
when in-domain training data is rare.

Furthermore, we interpret the learned model
to understand what information is transferred to
a new domain. In general, a model trained on
out-of-domain data can learn to detect summary-
worthy content, but may not match the generation
style in the target domain. Concretely, we observe
that the model trained on news domain pays sim-
ilar amount of attention to summary-worthy con-
tent (i.e., words reused by human abstracts) when
tested on news and opinion articles. On the other
hand, human writers tend to employ new words
unseen from the input when constructing opinion
abstracts. End-to-end evaluation results imply that
the model trained on out-of-domain data fails to
capture this aspect.

The above observations suggest that the neural
summarization model learns to 1) identify salient
content, and 2) generate summaries with a style
as in the training data. The first element might be
transferable to a new domain, while not so much
for the second.

2 The Neural Summarization Model

In this work, we choose the attentional sequence-
to-sequence model with pointer-generator mech-
anism (See et al., 2017) for study. Briefly, the
model learns to generate a sequence of tokens
{yi} based on the following conditional probabil-
ity: p(yi = w|y1, . . . , yi−1, x) = pgenPvocab(w)+
(1− pgen)

∑
i:wi=w

ati
Here Pvocab(w) denotes the probability to gen-

erate a new word from vocabulary, pgen is a
learned parameter that chooses between generat-
ing and copying, depending on the hidden states
and attention distribution. This model enhances

the original attention model (Bahdanau et al.,
2014) by incorporating pointer-network (Vinyals
et al., 2015), which allows the decoder to copy ac-
curate information from input. Due to space limi-
tation, we refer the readers to original paper (See
et al., 2017) for model details.

For experiments, we employ bidirectional re-
current neural network (RNN) as encoder and uni-
directional RNN as decoder, both implemented by
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with 256 hid-
den units. Input and output data are lowercased as
described in (See et al., 2017).

3 Datasets and Experimental Setup

Primary Data. Our primary data source is The
New York Times Annotated Corpus (Sandhaus,
2008) (henceforth called NYT-annotated). Com-
pared with other commonly used dataset for ab-
stractive summarization, NYT-annotated has more
variation in its abstracts, such as paraphrase and
generalization. It also comes with other human la-
bels we could use to characterize the type of ar-
ticles. The whole dataset consists of 1.8 million
articles, of which 650,000 are annotated with hu-
man constructed abstracts. Articles longer than 15
tokens and abstracts longer than 10 tokens are ex-
tracted for use in our study (as in Figure 1).

The resulting dataset are further separated into
two types based on their taxonomy tags1: NEWS
stories and OPINION articles. We believe these
two types of documents are different enough in
terms of topics, summary style, and lexical level
language use, that they could be treated as differ-
ent domains for our study. We collected 100,824

1The corpus comes with taxonomic classifiers tags. Arti-
cles with tag “News” are treated as news stories; for the rest,
the ones with “Opinion”,“Editorial”, or “Features” are treated
as opinion articles.

articles for NEWS which is treated as source do-
main, and 51,214 for OPINION as target domain.
The average length for documents of NEWS is
680.8 tokens, and 785.6 tokens for OPINION. The
average lengths for abstracts are 23.14 and 19.13
for NEWS and OPINION.

We also make use of the section tag, such as
Business, Sports, Arts, to calculate the topic dis-
tribution for these two domains. About 57% of
the documents of NEWS are about Sports, whereas
more than 78% documents of OPINION are about
Arts. We also observe different levels of subjec-
tivity based on the percentage of strong subjective
words taken from MPQA lexicon (Wilson et al.,
2005). On average 4.1% of the tokens in OPINION
articles are strong subjective, compared to 2.9%
for NEWS stories. This shows the topics and word
usage are essentially different between these two
domains.

Characterizing Two Domains. Here we character-
ize the difference between NEWS and OPINION
by analyzing the distribution of word types in ab-
stracts and how often human reuse words from
input text to construct the summaries. Overall,
81.3% of the words in NEWS abstracts are reused
from input, compared with 75.8% for OPINION.
The distribution for words of different part-of-
speech is displayed on the left of Figure 2, which
shows that there are relatively more Nouns in
OPINION. In the same figure, we display the
percentage of words in abstract that are reused
from input, which suggests that human tends to
reuse more nouns and verbs for NEWS abstracts.
Furthermore, the distribution of Named Entities
words and subjective words in abstracts are de-
picted in Figure 3.

Model Pre-training Dataset. We further col-
lect lead paragraphs and article descriptions for

1,435,735 articles from The New York Times
API2. About 71% of these descriptions are the
first sentences in the lead paragraphs, and thus
can be considered as extractive summaries. About
one million lead paragraph and description pairs
are retained for pre-training3 (henceforth NYT-
extract).

Training Setup. We randomly divide NYT-
annotated into training (75%), validation (15%),
and test (10%) for both news and opinion. Exper-
iments are conducted with the following setups:
1) IN-DOMAIN: Training and testing are done
in the same domain, for NEWS and OPINION;
2) OUT-OF-DOMAIN: training on source domain
NEWS, and testing on target domain OPINION;
and 3) MIX-DOMAIN: training on source domain
NEWS and then on target domain OPINION, and
testing on OPINION. Training stops when the
trend of loss function on validation set starts in-
creasing.

Evaluation Metrics. We use automatic evalua-
tion on recall-oriented ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and
precision-oriented BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).
We consider ROUGE-2 which measures bigram
recall, and ROUGE-L which takes into account
the longest common subsequence. We also eval-
uate on BLEU which measures precision up to bi-
grams.

4 Results

Effect of Pre-training with Extracts. We first
evaluate whether pre-training can improve sum-
marization performance for IN-DOMAIN setups,
where we initialize model parameters by training
on NYT-extract for about 20,000 iterations. Oth-
erwise, parameters are randomly initialized. Re-
sults are displayed in Table 1. We also consider
two baselines, BASELINE1 outputs the first sen-
tence, BASLINE2 selects the first 22 (news) and
15 (opinion) tokens (with similar lengths as hu-
man summaries).

As can be seen, the pre-training step improves
performance for NEWS, whereas the performance
on OPINION remains roughly the same. This might
be due to the fact that news abstracts reuse more

3Unsupervised language model (Ramachandran et al.,

2016) can also be used for parameter initialization before our
pre-training step. Here our goal is to allow the model to learn
searching for summary-worthy content, in addition to gram-
maticality and language fluency.

Effect of Domain Adaptation. Here we evalu-
ate on domain adaptation, where OPINION is the
target domain. From Figure 4, we can see that
when In-domain data is insufficient Mix-domain
training yields better performance. As more In-
domain training data becomes available, it out-
performs Mix-domain training. Baseline for se-
lecting the first sentence as summary is also dis-
played. Sample summaries in Figure 5 also shows
that OUT-OF-DOMAIN training tends to generate
summary in similar style to the source domain,
while MIX-DOMAIN training introduces the style
of the target domain. In our dataset, the first sen-
tences of summaries for OPINION are usually in
the form of [PERSON] reviews/criticizes/columns
[EVENT], but the summaries for NEWS usually
start with event descriptions directly. Such style
difference is reflected in OUT-OF-DOMAIN and
MIX-DOMAIN too.

We further classify the words in gold-standard
summaries based on if they are seen in abstracts
during training and then whether they are taken
from the input text. We examine whether they
are generated correctly. Full training set of opin-
ion is used for in-domain and mix-domain train-
ing. Table 2 shows that among in-domain models,
the model trained for news are superior at gener-
ating tokens mentioned in the input, compared to
the model trained for opinion (33.7% v.s. 22.0%).
Nonetheless, model trained for opinion is better
at generating new words not in the input (8.2%
vs. 2.6%). This is consistent with our observa-
tion that in opinion domain human editors favors

Further Analysis. Here we study what informa-
tion is transferable cross domains by investigating
the attention weights assigned to the input text.
What can be transferred. We start with input
words with highest attention weights when gen-
erating the summaries. Among these, we show the
percentage over different word categories as in Ta-
ble 3. For named entities, model trained on out-of-
domain data pays more attention to PERSON and
less attention to ORGANIZATION, while the in-
domain trained model does reverse . This is con-
sistent with the fact that opinion abstracts contains
more PERSON and less ORGANIZATION than
news abstracts (see Figure 3). This suggests that
the identification of summary-worthy named enti-
ties might be transferable from NEWS to OPINION.
Similar effect is also observed for nouns and verbs,
though less significant.
Attention change for domain adaptation. We
also examine the percentage of attention paid to
summary-worthy words. For every output to-
ken we pick the input token with highest atten-
tion weight, and count the ones reused by hu-

man. For IN-DOMAIN test on NEWS, on aver-
age 29.57% of the output tokens have highest at-
tention on summary-worthy words. For OUT-OF-
DOMAIN test on OPINION, the number is 15.93%;
for MIX-DOMAIN, it is 26.08%. This shows the
ability to focus on salient words is largely kept for
MIX-DOMAIN training. Additionally, as can be
seen in Table 3, model trained on MIX-DOMAIN
puts more attention weights on PERSON (and
all named entities) and nouns, but less attention
on verbs and subjective words, compared with
the model trained OUT-OF-DOMAIN. This again
aligns with our observation for the domain differ-
ence based on abstracts as in Figures 2 and 3.

Domain adaptation has been studied for a wide
range of natural language processing tasks (Blitzer
et al., 2007; Florian et al., 2004; Daume III, 2007;
Foster et al., 2010). However, little has been done
for investigating summarization systems (Sandu
et al., 2010; Wang and Cardie, 2013). To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study
the adaptation of neural summarization models for

new domain. Furthermore, Recent work in neural
summarization mainly focuses on specfic exten-
sions to improve system performance (Rush et al.,
2015; Takase et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Nalla-
pati et al., 2016; Ranzato et al., 2015). It is un-
clear how to adapt the existing neural summariza-
tion systems to a new domain when the training
data is limited or not available. This is a question
we aim to address in this work.

6 Conclusion

We investigated domain adaptation for abstrac-
tive neural summarization. Experimental results
showed that pre-training model with extractive
summaries helps. By analyzing the attention
weight distribution over input tokens, we found
the model was capable to select salient informa-
tion even trained on out-of-domain data. This
points to future direcions where domain adapta-
tion techniques can be developed to allow a sum-
marization system to learn content selection from
out-of-domain data while acquiring language gen-
erating behavior with in-domain data.
