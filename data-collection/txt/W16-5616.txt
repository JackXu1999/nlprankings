Abstract

What is the information content of news-based
measures of sentiment? How are they re-
lated to aggregate economic fluctuations? I
construct a sentiment index by measuring the
net amount of positive expressions in the cor-
pus of Economic news articles produced by
Reuters over the period 1987 - 2013 and across
12 countries. The index successfully tracks
fluctuations in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
at the country level, is a leading indicator of
GDP growth and contains information to help
forecast GDP growth which is not captured by
professional forecasts. This suggests that fore-
casters do not appropriately incorporate avail-
able information in predicting future states of
the economy.

1 Introduction

To date, there is limited cross-country evidence for
the role that sentiment might play in explaining ag-
gregate economic fluctuations. In this paper, I show
how measures of aggregate beliefs extracted from
news articles are related to GDP growth. I build
upon a recent and fast-growing literature which re-
lates information extracted from text to economic
and financial variables ((Tetlock, 2007), (Baker et
al., 2016), (Garcia, 2013)). The approach commonly
used in this literature measures sentiment using pre-
existing dictionaries. 1

1An alternative approach employed in (Choi and Varian,
2012) uses Google search results to forecast near-term values
of economic indicators.

I build my sentiment index by measuring the net
amount of positive expressions in the collection of
Economic news articles from Reuters covering 12
countries over the period 1987 - 2013. The in-
dex successfully tracks GDP growth over time and
across countries. Is sentiment a leading indicator of
GDP growth? I estimate an autoregressive model
GDP growth to which I add news-based sentiment
measures. Coefficients on news-based sentiment
measures are jointly significant at the country level
for 10 out of 12 countries in my sample. Senti-
ment variables reduce in-sample forecast errors of
GDP growth by 9.1% on average across countries
compared to an autogressive process. This indicates
that news sentiment is a leading indicator of GDP
growth.

Do news-based sentiment measures simply aggre-
gate other well-established leading indicators? I test
whether news-based sentiment measures contain in-
formation which is not reflected in professional fore-
casters’ expectations. I run predictive regressions of
annual GDP growth on consensus forecasts data at
different forecasting horizons. I then add to the re-
gressions my news sentiment index measured prior
to the release of the consensus forecasts. Includ-
ing sentiment reduces in-sample forecast errors by
19% on average across countries. News-based senti-
ment measures contain information which is not in-
cluded in forecasters’ expectations. Reductions in
forecast errors are larger for longer forecasting hori-
zons, which reflect the fact the long-term forecast
are inherently hard. Reductions in forecast errors
are also larger during bad times, which indicates that
forecasters might be underreacing to bad news.

2 News-based Sentiment

2.1 Data Description

My dataset contains news articles extracted from
Factiva.com, an online database which provides ac-
cess to news archives from around the world. One
can retrieve articles by querying a set of tags such
as the source, the main topics and the locations as-
sociated with an article. A proprietary algorithm
attributes topics and location tags to articles and is
constant across the database.

Table (1) presents summary statistics of the news
articles in my corpus. I focus on articles produced
by Reuters News, which is the most comprehensive
stream of news over time and across countries. I
have collected all the news articles containing the
topics tag ”Economic news” and covering a set of
12 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India,
Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzer-
land, South Africa, South Korea, and the United
Kingdom. The time window is December 1998 to
September 2013 for developed countries (Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom), and June 1987 to September 2013
for developing countries (Argentina, Brazil, India,
Indonesia, South Africa and South Korea). For each
article, I have automatically extracted the times-
tamp, the title, the main text, the topics and the loca-
tions tags.

Table 2: The 20 Most Frequent Negative and Posi-
tive Words.

2.2 Text Processing

I combine dictionaries of positive and negative
words compiled by (Loughran and McDonald,
2011) for financial texts and by (Young and Soroka,
2012) for political and economic texts. I search for
inflections of each word in these dictionaries which
are present in my corpus. Given a root tonal word
(e.g. ”lose”), I retrieve all the inflected words in the
news corpus (”losing”, ”looser”, ”lost”, ”loss”, etc
...) and add them to the dictionaries. I check the rel-
evance of the most frequent words and eliminate the
ones which are irrelevant. My dictionary of positive
words contains 3,527 items and the one with nega-
tive words contains 7,109 items.

Table 2 shows that the most frequent positive and
negative words indeed reflect the sentiment typically
associated with economic and financial outcomes.

Here is an example of an article in which the main
location tag is Argentina (in bold) and one of the
topic tags is ”Economic news” (in bold):2

Title: Argentina’s Peronists defend Menem’s labor
reforms.
Timestamp: 1996-09-02
Text: BUENOS AIRES, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The
Argentine government Monday tried to counter
criticisms of President Carlos Menem’s proposals
for more flexible labor laws, arguing that not just
workers would contribute to new unemployment
insurance. Menem angered trade unions, already in
disagreement over his fiscal austerity programmes,
by announcing a labor reform package Friday
including suspending collective wage deals and
replacing redundancy payouts with unemployment
insurance.
Topics: Labor/Personnel Issues, Corpo-
rate/Industrial News, Economic/Monetary Policy,
Economic News, Political/General News, Labor
Issues, Domestic Politics
Locations: Argentina, Latin America, South
America

The dictionary-based approach is straightforward
and transparent, yet some words are not properly
classified. To improve accuracy, I normalize 373
negative forms such as ”no longer”, ”neither”, ”not
having”, etc ... to ”not” as proposed in (Young and
Soroka, 2012). I then build a second pair of lists of
positive and negative expressions which appear pre-
ceded by a ”not”. A positive (negative) word pre-
ceded by a ”not” is classified as negative (positive).
Finally, I normalize 783 ambiguous expressions to
correctly account for their tone. For instance, the ex-
pression ”lose support” would be classified as neu-
tral, so I normalize it to be counted as negative.

2.3 Sentiment Index

Using this classification of tonal expressions, a sim-
ple measure sentiment is the difference between the
fraction of positive expressions and the fraction of
negative expressions in each article. This measure
is unlikely to capture all the nuances of a text, but it
is likely to give a good indication of how news tone
varies across country and over time.

Let tij be the number of occurrences of word i in
article j. Let nij (pij) be the number of occurrences
of negative (positive) word i in document j. Corre-

spondingly, let p̄ij (n̄ij) the number of occurrences
of negative (positive) word i in document j preceded
by a ”not”.

The positivity of article j is given by:

πj =
∑

i pij +
∑

i p̄ij −
∑

i n̄ij∑
i tij

. (1)

In the numerator, the first term corresponds to the
weighted sum of all the positive words. The second
term corresponds to the weighted sum of negative
words preceded by a ”not”. The last term corre-
sponds to the weighted sum of positive words pre-
ceded by a ”not”.

Similarly, the negativity of article j is given by:

νj =
∑

i nij +
∑

i n̄ij −
∑

i p̄ij∑
i tij

. (2)

The net positivity of article j is given by:

sj = πj − νj . (3)

3 Sentiment and GDP Growth

Figure (1) shows that my sentiment index success-
fully tracks fluctuations in GDP growth at the coun-
try level. The first natural question is whether or not
sentiment is a leading indicator of GDP growth.

3.1 Granger Causality Tests

To show this, I estimate the autoregressive dis-
tributed lag model described by equation (4):

yt,c = α+
p∑

i=1

βi,cyt−i,c+
q∑

i=1

γi,cπt−i,c+
q∑

i=1

ζi,cνt−i,c+�t,c,

(4)

where yt,c is the log GDP growth between t and t+3
months in country c and �t,c is the error term. I first
estimate an autoregressive process of GDP growth
at a quarterly frequency and at the country level by
choosing the number of lags p which minimizes the
AIC criterion. I then add monthly lags of positive

and negative sentiment (averaged at a monthly fre-
quency), again choosing the number of lag values q
using the AIC criterion.

Table (3) shows that lags of negative sentiment are a
leading indicator of GDP growth at the country level
for 9 out of the 12 countries in my sample. Lags of
positive sentiment are a leading indicator of GDP
growth for half of the country in my sample. This
evidence is consistent with previous literature using
news-based measures of sentiment which finds that
most of the textual information is contained in neg-
ative words ((Loughran and McDonald, 2011)). In
the case of India however, while I cannot reject the
hypothesis that lags of negative sentiment are jointly
equal to zero, I can reject the hypothesis that lags
of positive sentiment are jointly equal to zero. This
suggests that positive sentiment measures might also
be worth considering as a leading indicator of GDP
growth.

Figure (2) shows that on average across countries,
forecast errors of next quarter GDP growth diminish
by 9.1% when news-based sentiment measures are
included in the ADL(p,q) model described by equa-

3.2 News Sentiment and Consensus Forecast

Several aggregate time series (e.g. weekly ini-
tial jobless claims, monthly payroll employment,
etc...) are well known for containing informa-
tion to help measure current economic conditions
((Aruoba et al., 2009)). Does my sentiment in-
dex simply combine information already contained
in these well-known leading indicators? Obtaining
data on leading indicators of GDP growth across
countries is challenging, but these leading indica-
tors should presumably be included in professional
forecasters’ information set. Since 1989, Consen-
sus Economics Inc. provides a monthly survey of
professional forecasters who are asked to forecast
annual GDP growth across countries. For each re-
alization of yearly GDP growth, the dataset contains
GDP growth forecasts made by public and private
economic institutions for each horizon h=1,...,24
months. (Fildes and Stekler, 2002) show that survey-
based consensus forecasts are most of the time more
accurate than those generated by time series models.
The other advantage of forecasts produced by Con-
sensus Economics is its common format for a large
cross section of emerging market countries. If pro-
fessional forecasters use all available information in
producing their forecasts, the information contained
in my news-based sentiment measures should not re-
duce the forecast errors of predictive regressions of
GDP growth using consensus forecasts.

Predictive regressions of GDP growth using consen-
sus forecasts and news-based sentiment measures
are described by equation (5):

yt,c = α+βyt−h,c+γ
q∑

i=1

πt−h−i,c+ζ
q∑

i=1

νt−h−i,c+�t,c,

(5)

where yt,c is the log GDP growth between t and
t + 12 months in country c and �t,c is the error
term. First, I estimate predictive regressions of GDP
growth on consensus forecasts at the country level

3All the regressions’ forecast errors are measured in sample
by computing the regressions’ root mean square errors (RMSE).

for each horizon h = 1, ... , 24. Because sample sizes
are small, estimating coefficients for each lagged
measure of sentiment would lead to large standard
errors. I instead include moving averages of my pos-
itive and negative sentiment measures (averaged at
a monthly frequency); the moving average horizon
q is chosen by minimizing regressions’ forecast er-
rors.4

On average across countries and horizons, forecast
errors diminish by 19% when news-based sentiment
measures are included in predictive regressions of
GDP growth on consensus forecasts. The top right
panel of figure (3) shows that, on average across
horizons, forecast errors diminish for each country
in my sample. The top left panel shows that this re-
duction is larger for longer horizon: the average re-
duction in forecast error goes from 12% for horizons
up to 12 months, to 25% for horizons longer than 12
months. This evidence supports a model of informa-
tion frictions where forecasters slowly incorporate
textual information in forming their forecasts.

It is well established that forecast errors tend to
be larger during bad times. Does the reduction in
forecast errors resulting from the inclusion of sen-
timent measures differentially improve forecasts of
good and bad times? I fit an H-P filter to quarterly
GDP growth times series at the country level ((Ho-
drick and Prescott, 1997)). Good (bad) times are
defined to be the periods when the realized annual
GDP growth is above (below) the trend produced by
the H-P filter. I use the estimates of the model de-
fined by equation (5) and I separately compute the
forecast errors measured during good and bad times.
The middle column of figure (3) presents forecast
errors of good times and the right column presents
forecast errors of bad times.

Forecast errors of good times diminish by 13% on
average as a result of the inclusion sentiment mea-
sures in equation (5). The improvement in forecast
error goes up to 21% during bad times. The mid-
dle left and bottom left panel of figure (3) shows
that the same result holds if I restrict the sample
to short (long) forecasting horizons: during good
times, forecast errors diminish by 10% (15%) on av-

4To be clear, sentiment variables are lagged to only include
information released prior to the forecasts.

countries and horizons when news-based sentiment measures
are included in predictive regressions of GDP growth on con-
sensus forecasts for GDP growth (see equation (5)). In the left
column, forecast errors are averaged across countries. In the
right column they are averaged across horizons. The left panel
shows forecast errors during both good and bad times; the mid-
dle panel shows forecast errors during good times; the right

times are determined with respect to an HP filter estimated on
quarterly GDP growth data. A period is considered to be a good
(bad) time if annual GDP growth is above (below) the trend es-
timated by the HP filter. Errors bars represent standard errors.

erage; during bad times they diminish by 16% (28%)
on average.

If forecasters where simply slowly incorporating in-
formation but correctly assigning weights when up-
dating their forecasts, I should not observe a differ-
ence in changes in predictive accuracy between good
and bad times. The fact that reductions in forecast
error are larger in bad times than in good times sug-
gests that forecasters tend to underreact to negative
information.

4 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper describes the information content of
news-based measures of sentiment and their rela-
tionship to fluctuations in GDP growth. Sentiment
measures tracks fluctuations in GDP and we show
that they are a leading indicator of GDP growth at
the country level for 10 out of 12 countries in our
sample. Sentiment measures contain information
which is not accounted for by professional forecast-
ers. News-based sentiment measures lead to a 19%
average reduction in forecast error of GDP growth
relative to consensus forecasts. Reductions in fore-
cast errors are larger for longer forecasting horizons
which suggests that forecasters slowly incorporate
textual information into their forecasts. Reductions
in forecast errors are also larger during bad times
which indicates that forecasters tend to underreact
to bad news.

From a policy perspective, news-based measures of
sentiment provide a direct, real-time, automated and
inexpensive measures of aggregate sentiment about
current and future economic conditions, especially
for countries for which official statistics might be
sparse, inaccurate or noisy. As a result, it could help
policy makers react in a more efficient manner to
changes in economic conditions.
