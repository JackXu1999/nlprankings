Abstract

Twitter has become one of the most import channels to spread latest scholarly information be-
cause of its fast information spread speed. How to predict whether a scholarly tweet will be
retweeted is a key task in understanding the message propagation within large user communities.
Hence, we present the real-time scholarly retweeting prediction system that retrieves scholarly
tweets which will be retweeted. First, we filter scholarly tweets from tracking a tweet stream.
Then, we extract Tweet Scholar Blocks indicating metadata of papers. At last, we combine
scholarly features with the Tweet Scholar Blocks to predict whether a scholarly tweet will be
retweeted. Our system outperforms chosen baseline systems. Additionally, our system has the
potential to predict scientific impact in real-time.

1 Introduction

The volume of information about scientific papers is enormous on Twitter, and most data is real-time,
even before the paper content is published and shortly after the notifications of acceptance. Besides, lots
of scholars post tweets to express their excitement when their papers got accepted (Priem and Costello,
2010). We call the tweets that imply accepted papers scholarly tweets (STs) and the rest non-scholarly
tweets (NSTs). Retweeting is an action of reposting others’ tweet by using the retweet button on Twitter
or other mechanism. To help understand the message propagation within large user communities, we
develop a real-time scholarly retweeting prediction system.

Our task is to predict whether a ST will be retweeted. The problem of retweeting prediction has at-
tracted more and more attention. Zhang et al. (2016) propose a deep learning method to predict retweet-
ing. However, due to the special and structural ways using combinations of different Tweet Scholar
Blocks (TSBs) encoding scholarly information about papers, venues, and authors, different methods
should be explored to solve our task.

In this work, we propose a real-time scholarly retweeting prediction system by exploiting TSBs and
scholarly features. We only focus on retweets made using the retweet button in Twitter. Under this
circumstance, the tweet-retweet connection is unambiguously and can be retrieved directly by Twitter’s
API. At first, we trace a data stream by tracking “paper accepted” in Twitter using the Twitter API,
but there are some NSTs in the data stream, so we build a classification model to filter ST tweets. It is
investigated that most STs consist of text blocks called Twitter Scholar Blocks (TSBs) indicating meta
data, and we build a sequence tagger to extract TSBs to gather metadata information. At last, we build a
binary classification model by combining TSBs with scholarly information in Twitter to predict whether
the ST will be retweeted. Experimental results show that our system outperforms chosen baseline systems
and has the potential to predict scientific impact in real-time.

2 Real-time Scholarly Retweeting Prediction System

2.1 System Overview

Given a tweet t, our goal is first to learn a function STF that estimate the likelihood of whether t is a
scholarly tweet, then learn a function RP to estimate the probability of whether t will be retweeted. By
incorporating with the TSBs and scholarly features, we use the system to predict whether the STs will be
retweeted. The framework of our approach is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 Scholarly Tweets Filter

We regard filtering STs from the data stream as a classification problem. In our scholarly tweets filter
(STF) module, we build a classification model based on support vector machine.

To capture the information in social networks, we design a feature user’s scholarly membership of
academic institutions by examining whether user descriptions contain one of the high-frequency words
of academic institution names in Wikipedia (we choose top sixty words in experiments). Additionally,
we design bag of words, words with trending symbols and length of the tweet as features. We also
find that almost no one would hide happiness if her paper were accepted, and we use a tweet-specified
sentiment analysis API1 to generate sentiment labels for tweets.

2.3 Tweet Scholar Block Extractor

Inspired by previous works on structuring tweets (Luo et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2015), we investigate that
researchers post STs in structural ways using combinations of different Tweet Scholar Blocks (TSBs)
encoding scholarly information about papers, venues, and authors. In this work, we propose six types
of TSBs: Author, the names of authors; Title, the title of the paper; Venue, the short or entire name of
the venue; Time, the time when the venue will be held; Place, the place where the venue will be held;
Other, the rest part of tweet text. An example of extracted TSBs of a tweet is given in Figure 2.

In our tweet scholar block extractor (TSBE) module, we build a sequence tagger based on conditional
random fields with BIO schema. We use tokens starting with “@”, surrounded by pairwise symbols,
capitalized, trending symbols, POS-Tagging labels and NER labels as our features. Tokens starting
with “@” in STs are often mentioned co-authors. Besides, the paper titles usually occupy up to 40% text
content which is often surrounded by pairwise symbols or all capitalized to show different formats.

2.4 Retweeting Predictor

In our retweeting predictor (RP) module, we build a classification model based on support vector machine
(SVM). Apart from using text information generated from the extracted TSBs as our features, we take
scholarly features from social networks information in Twitter into account. Apart from extracted TSBs,
we categorize the rest scholarly features into following two categories:

Author Social Features: Previous work shows that the overall impact of all co-authors should have the
potential to influence a paper’s quality and popularity (Dong et al., 2015). We use extracted Author type
of TSBs to find the authors in ST tweets. We think the influence of an individual is related to her friend’s

number, followers number, and statuses quantity. To show the influence of a group, we calculate
the sum, maximum value, minimum value and average value of influences of all participants in that
group. In spite of these, we design a binary feature indicating whether a user is verifiedas verification
is used by Twitter mostly to confirm the authenticity of celebrity accounts.

Venue Popularity Features: Different venues have large differences in their influences. Since the
well-respected venues are better platforms for researchers to publish their work or results, our intuition
is that better sites help scholars spread their scientific impact more. Scholars often use Twitter as a note-
taking tool (Mapes, 2016) during venues, so the number of statuses in the venue topic may reflect the
popularity and influence of the site. Considering the developments and the trends of the venues, we also
take the total historical quantity of statuses into account.

3.1 Data Preparation and Experiment Settings

To evaluate our system, we first track a tweets stream posted from Jan. 2012 to Apr. 2018 by tracking
the key phrase “paper accepted” using Twitter API. randomly crawl 6,500 tweets Then we randomly
sample 6,500 tweets and manually label them as STs and NSTs for training scholarly tweets filter. Next,
we choose 1,400 original STs out of them by checking their “retweeted status” attributes are empty from
Twitter API. We use tweet-specific annotators (Owoputi et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2011) to tokenize those
tweets and get pos-tagging and NER labels, then manually label TSBs in BIO schema for training our
tweet scholar block extractor. Last but not least, we get the golden labels of whether an original ST will
be retweeted by finding the corresponding retweets. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation is used in
our experiments and accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.

3.2 Baseline Comparison and Feature Selection

We choose two baselines, the one is random prediction (Random), the other is an CNN model (Zhang et
al., 2016) (SUA-ACNN). Then we compare the result of using TSBE and golden TSBs with RP (TSBE+RP
and Golden+RP respectively). To find the best feature conjunction, we use a greedy feature selection
method in which we first choose the best feature set out of several randomly generated sets and then
iteratively append features that yield better performance. The setting of using best feature set is called

TSBE+RP Best and Golden+RP Best respectively. Results are shown in Table 2. Besides, Table 1
demonstrates some predicted examples of our TSBE+RP Best system.

Approach Accuracy
Random 62.43%
SUA-ACNN 76.29%
RP 90.36%
TSBE+RP 87.43%
RP Best 94.50%
TSBE+RP Best 90.57%

Table 2: Comparing With Baselines and the Best Feature Conjunction

Overall, our system outperforms the baseline, and it is feasible to predict scientific impact in Twitter
in real time. Moreover, the performance of TSBE+RP is lower than the performance of RP on manually
labeled TSBs, because the errors produced in TSBE might affect the performance of RP. Besides, the
best feature conjunction consisted of Sum Friends Count, Sum Followers Count, Max Followers Count.

3.3 Ablation Study
To find the effectiveness of each feature and which features are in particular highly valued by RP Best, we
also removed each feature from RP Best and TSBE+RP Best respectively to evaluate the effectiveness
of each feature by the decrement of accuracy.

By comparing the results shown in Table 3, we can see that Sum Followers Count is very effective to
our RP Best. The reason might be that Sum Followers Count is more suitable to stand for the influence
of the authors’ group.

Approach Accuracy
RP Best 94.50%
RP Best-Sum Friends Count 89.57%
RP Best-Sum Followers Count 88.93%
RP Best-Max Followers Count 89.14%
TSBE+RP Best 90.57%
TSBE+RP Best-Sum Friends Count 86.71%
TSBE+RP Best-Sum Followers Count 85.14%
TSBE+RP Best-Max Followers Count 86.43%

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose our real-time scholarly retweeting prediction system which solves the scholarly
tweets retweeting prediction problem. We introduce the three modules in our system: scholarly tweets
filter, tweet scholar block extractor and retweeting predictor. In addition, our system has the potential
to predict scientific impact in real-time. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our model
outperforms the baseline systems. Hope our system can help researchers to stand on the shoulders of
right giants.
