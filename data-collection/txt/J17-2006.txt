Studies in referring expression generation (REG) have shown different effects of referential
overspecification on the resolution of certain descriptions. To further investigate effects of this
kind, this article reports two eye-tracking experiments that measure the time required to rec-
ognize target objects based on different kinds of information. Results suggest that referential
overspecification may be either helpful or detrimental to identification depending on the kind of
information that is actually overspecified, an insight that may be useful for the design of more
informed hearer-oriented REG algorithms.

1. Introduction

In natural language generation, referring expression generation (REG) is the computa-
tional task of producing descriptions that enable the hearer to identify a target object
(Dale and Reiter 1995). REG may be divided into two fairly independent subtasks:
content selection (deciding what to say) and surface realization (deciding how to say
it). In this article we will focus on the content selection task of definite descriptions,
as in “the man wearing a dark suit,” “the young man on the left,” and so forth.

Central to the present discussion is the issue of referential overspecification
(Pechmann 1989). The inclusion of more information than required for disambig-
uation (e.g., to produce descriptions as in “the bird on top of the mailbox” in a context
in which there is only one visible bird) is common in language use, and it is known
to affect reference resolution in a number of ways. In particular, studies such as in
Arts et al. (2011) have shown that overspecified descriptions may help identification,

whereas studies such as in Engelhardt, Demiral, and Ferreira (2011) have shown that
adding certain modifiers in this way may actually slow down comprehension.

Knowing whether a particular piece of information may help or impair identifi-
cation is crucial for the design of hearer-oriented REG algorithms. Assuming that we
would like to generate descriptions that are easy to identify, this knowledge may shed
light on long-standing issues in REG such as the question of when to use relational
properties for the purpose of identification (e.g., as in the “bird on top of the mailbox”).
On the one hand, algorithms such as in Dale and Haddock (1991) make use of relations
as a last resort, that is, only when it is not possible to produce a uniquely identifying
atomic description. On the other hand, studies such as Viethen and Dale (2011) suggest
that using relations may be common even when relations are not required for dis-
ambiguation. Clearly, one possible way of deciding when to use a relational property
is by assessing its impact on identification.

To investigate when referential overspecification may help or impair identifi-
cation, we report on two eye-tracking experiments that measure the time spent
examining objects in a visual context based on different kinds of information. Our
findings suggest that easily recognizable properties may help identification, whereas
other properties may have the opposite effect. These results are consistent with pre-
vious work in the field, and pave the way for the design of more informed hearer-
oriented REG algorithms.

2. Related Work

Human speakers often include redundant information when referring to a target object,
and existing approaches to REG have long attempted to mimic this behavior (Dale and
Reiter 1995). Generally speaking, however, these studies do not address the question of
whether referential overspecification may be helpful or not from the hearer’s perspec-
tive. Exceptions are briefly discussed here.

A number of studies in REG and related fields have found that overspecified
descriptions may lead to faster identification. The work in Arts et al. (2011) compares
identification times required by minimally distinguishing descriptions (e.g., “the but-
ton”) and overspecified alternatives (e.g., “the round white button”). Results show that
identification is faster (or at least not slower) when additional information is presented.
The study also considered the use of overspecified spatial relations, and found that
including information about vertical position (e.g., above, below) also leads to faster
identification times.

Similarly, the work in Paraboni and van Deemter (2014) considers the use of over-
specified spatial relations to facilitate search in large or structurally complex spatial
domains. The study focuses on a number of situations in which minimally distin-
guishing descriptions may lead to confusion or even misidentification, as in “the
button behind a chair” in a context in which there are two chairs, but the intended
one is not the nearest chair from a hearer’s perspective. In situations of this kind,
it is argued that the use of overspecified spatial relations, as in “the button behind
a chair, on the left side” not only help, but may be actually required for successful
identification.

Other studies, by contrast, have found that referential overspecification may be
detrimental to identification. In Engelhardt, Baileyand, and Ferreira (2006), eye tracking
and ERP studies showed that hearers require additional time to execute instructions that
contain an overspecified prepositional phrase modifier as in “put the apple on the towel
in the box” in a context containing one apple on a towel and a second empty towel.

Referential overspecification in this case was found to lead to temporary confusion
about where the apple should be placed. Similarly, the work in Engelhardt, Demiral,
and Ferreira (2011) assessed how quickly participants could orient attention to an object
upon hearing descriptions as in “the red square” in a context in which the reference to
color could be either necessary or not. Results showed that referential overspecification
leads to longer reaction times.

3. Current Work

We now report on two eye-tracking experiments that measure the time spent examining
objects in a visual context based on different kinds of information. The first experiment
(Section 3.1) focuses on the use of overspecified relational properties, and the second
(Section 3.2) focuses on the use of atomic properties. In both cases, we would like to
show that referential overspecification may be either helpful or detrimental, depending
on the effort required to recognize the additional information.

3.1 Experiment 1: Overspecification Using Relational Properties

Consider a simple domain conveying seven- and eight-pointed stars with alphanumeric
labels as in Figure 1. In this domain, we will focus on situations of reference in which
a target description (e.g., “the letter”) may be overspecified with the addition of a
relational property (e.g., “the letter inside an eight-pointed star”).

In this domain, we assume that recognizing an object shape (i.e., determining
whether a star has seven or eight points) requires more time than recognizing a label
type (i.e., determining whether a star contains a letter or number). Thus, we will say
that object shapes are comparatively “difficult” to recognize, and that label types are
comparatively “easy.” This basic assumption, although plausible in the current context,
will be verified as part of the subsequent data analysis.

We consider four experimental conditions in Table 1. Conditions min.D and min.E
make use of atomic descriptions that may be either difficult (e.g., “the eight-pointed
star”) or easy (“the letter”) to recognize. These will be compared to alternatives in which
a second property is overspecified, and which may in principle be either difficult or
easy as well. In the original (Portuguese) descriptions considered in the experiment, the
added information is to be interpreted as being restrictive, that is, readers will assume
that the information is in principle required for disambiguation.

In this setting, our goals are twofold: We would like to show that overspecified
relational properties that are easy to recognize may help identification, and that those
that are difficult to recognize may have the opposite effect. To this end, we designed

an experiment in which participants were required to identify target objects in stimulus
images as in Figure 1. In doing so, we measured the time spent examining every indi-
vidual object on screen with the aid of a gaze-tracking device. In order to minimize the
effects of task awareness, however, our focus is on the inspection of distractor objects,
and not on the target itself.1 Our research hypotheses are as follows:

h1a: Adding an easily recognizable relational property to a minimally distinguishing
description will decrease mean inspection times.

h1b: Adding a relational property that is difficult to recognize to a minimally
distinguishing description will increase mean inspection times.

Hypothesis h1a predicts that referential overspecification facilitates identification
along the lines of Arts et al. (2011) and Paraboni and van Deemter (2014). This will
be tested by comparing mean inspection times required by minimally distinguishing
descriptions conveying a property that is difficult to recognize (condition min.D, as in
“the eight-pointed star”) with overspecified alternatives using a property that is easier
to recognize (overspec.DE, as in “the eight-pointed star containing a letter”). Inspection
times are expected to decrease from min.D to overspec.DE.

Hypothesis h1b predicts that referential overspecification impairs identification
along the lines of Engelhardt, Demiral, and Ferreira (2011) and Engelhardt, Baileyand,
and Ferreira (2006). This will be tested by comparing inspection times required by
minimally distinguishing descriptions conveying only the property that is easy to rec-
ognize (condition min.E, as in “the letter”) with the overspecified alternatives using the
property that is more difficult to recognize (overspec.ED, as in “the letter inside an eight-
pointed star”). Inspection times are expected to increase from min.E to overspec.ED.

In both cases, we notice that our focus is on the comparison between short and long
descriptions with restrictive reading, and we do not compare the two overspecified al-
ternatives directly. This contrasts with the work in Clarke, Elsner, and Rohde (2015), for
example, which investigates the relation between order of mention and visual salience.

Subjects 25 undergraduate students acting as volunteers. Participants were on aver-
age 20.4 years old (min = 18 and max = 23), predominantly male (19, or 76%), and had
normal or corrected vision. All participants were native Portuguese speakers.

Procedure Each trial was run individually, and included practice time to familiar-
ize subjects with the task. Participants were required to identify the target objects

1 For instance, target identification had to be fully acknowledged by pressing the space bar, a decision that
may affect its overall visualization time in a way that does not occur in the case of distractors.

mentioned on each scene and press the space bar to acknowledge this. No mention was
made of the distractor objects, which were the true focus of the experiment. Stimulus
images were presented individually in random order, and included the instruction
conveying the description of the intended target, presented (in Portuguese) in the
central portion of the screen, as in “Look at the eight-pointed star.” Inspection times
were computed by considering all visits to distractor objects on screen, from the moment
in which the scene was displayed until identification. When the participant’s gaze was
not upon any of the eight objects on screen, inspection times were not computed.

Materials The experiment made use of purpose-built software to present the stimuli
and to compute inspection times of screen objects. We used a set of 24 images similar to
those in Figure 1 representing 8 experimental items and 16 fillers. All images showed
eight star objects with a description in the center.2

As a means to increase the chances that at least one distractor object would be
visited before reaching the target, in the experimental items the target object is always
placed in one of the screen corners. For that reason, filler items were included so as to
place targets in the inner screen positions as well. The angle of inclination of each object
was altered so as to make the recognition of the star shape more difficult, and it has
no particular meaning for the experiment. Also as a means to increase the chances of
visiting at least one distractor object during search, each experimental condition was
tested twice by alternating label types (letters/numbers) and shapes (seven- or eight-
pointed), and also by varying object positions.

Results Table 2 shows the mean gain in distractor inspection times for the two over-
specification strategies over the minimally distinguishing alternatives. All p values
were obtained by using the Satterthwaite approximation.

Before discussing our main hypotheses, we will briefly examine the basic assump-
tion upon which the experiment was built, namely, the assumption that recognizing
a star shape (seven- or eight-pointed) is more difficult than recognizing a label type
(letter/number). We found that referring to an object shape (min.D) demands longer
identification times than referring to a label type (min.E). The difference is significant,
according to a one-way ANOVA test (F(1,48) = 16.3442, MSE = 22133.65 p < 0.001).
We also compared the time required by descriptions that refer to letters and numbers,
and by descriptions that refer to seven- and eight-pointed objects. In both cases, there
was no significant difference in using either alternative.

For our main hypotheses, we report results from a linear mixed-effects analysis
of the relationship between distractor recognition times and cognitive effort. As fixed
effect, we entered cognitive effort (easy / difficult) into the model. As random effects

further investigation on the choice of search paths (to be discussed in a subsequent paper).

455

we had intercepts for subjects and items, and also by-subject and by-item random slopes
for the effects of cognitive effort.

Regarding hypothesis h1a, we notice that adding an easily recognizable property
decreases inspection times. This offers support to hypothesis h1a. Regarding h1b, the
opposite effect is observed: Adding a property that is more difficult to recognize in-
creases inspection times. A likelihood ratio test of the full model against the model
without this effect shows that the difference is significant (χ2(1) = 4.9366, p = 0.02629).

Discussion Because readers do not know in advance whether a piece of information
is overspecified or not, they are forced to take the entire description into account
when searching for its target. Thus, if the redundant information happens to be easily
recognizable (e.g., an object label), the additional property may facilitate identification.
This outcome is consistent with Arts et al. (2011), Paraboni and van Deemter (2014),
and others. On the other hand, if the redundant information turns out to be difficult
to recognize (e.g., star shape), then referential overspecification will have the opposite
effect. This outcome is consistent with studies such as Engelhardt, Demiral, and Ferreira
(2011).

3.2 Experiment 2: Overspecification Using Atomic Properties

In the domain considered in Experiment 1, the difference between so-called easy and
difficult properties was self-explanatory. In our second experiment, we would like to
provide further evidence that referential overspecification may help or impair identi-
fication in more subtle situations by considering a visual domain containing character
pairs of letters and numbers, as in Figure 2, and by focusing on situations in which the
landmark portion of a relational description may either refer to a more general class of
objects (e.g., “the even number followed by a letter”) or to a subcategory (e.g., “the even
number followed by a consonant”).

Analogously to the recognition of star shapes and labels in Experiment 1, we assume
that recognizing whether a character is a letter is easier than recognizing whether it is
a consonant, and we will make use of three experimental conditions min, overspec.G,
and overspec.S in Table 3. These conditions differ from each other only in the kind of
referring expression under consideration. The min condition makes use of the minimally
distinguishing atomic description “the even number.” In both overspec conditions, this
same atomic description is overspecified by adding a reference to a landmark object
(i.e., “the adjacent character”). Condition overspec.G refers to the more general property

Condition Translated example Portuguese original description

min the even number o número par
overspec.G the even number followed by a letter o número par seguido de uma letra
overspec.S the even number followed by a consonant o número par seguido de uma consoante

“letter,” whereas overspec.S refers to the more specific property “consonant.” As in
Experiment 1, the overspecified alternatives (in Portuguese) have a restrictive reading.

An identification task similar to Experiment 1 was carried out. Our research
hypotheses are as follows:

h2a: Adding a more general atomic property to a minimally distinguishing description
will decrease mean inspection times.

h2b: Adding a more specific atomic property to a minimally distinguishing description
will increase mean inspection times.

Hypothesis h2a predicts that overspecification using the more general property
“letter” facilitates identification just like any property that is easily recognizable
(cf. Experiment 1). This will be tested by comparing inspection times required by
minimally distinguishing descriptions (min, as in “the even number”) with the over-
specified alternative using a more general property (overspec.G, as in “the even
number followed by a letter”). Inspection times are expected to decrease from min to
overspec.G.

Hypothesis h2b predicts that referential overspecification using the more specific
property “consonant” will impair identification just like those properties that are diffi-
cult to recognize (cf. Exp.1). This will be tested by comparing inspection times required
by minimally distinguishing descriptions (min, as in “the even number”) with the
overspecified alternative using a more specific property (overspec.S, as in “the even
number followed by a consonant”). Inspection times are expected to increase from min
to overspec.S.

Subjects 25 undergraduate students who responded to an invitation to act as volun-
teers. Participants were on average 20.4 years old (min = 18 and max = 25) and had
normal or corrected vision. All participants were male native speakers of Portuguese.

Procedure Same as in Experiment 1.

Materials Stimuli consisted of 20 images similar to those in Figure 2 representing
6 experimental items and 14 images regarded as fillers for our current purposes. All
images showed eight character pairs with a description in the center. Once again, ex-
perimental items always placed the target object in one of the screen corners, and fillers
were designed so as to place the target in the four inner positions as well. Further scene
variation was implemented by alternating letters and numbers, and also by changing
the object positions across images.

Results Table 4 shows the mean gain in distractor inspection times for the two
overspecification strategies over the min alternative, with p values obtained from the

Satterthwaite approximation. We report results from a linear mixed-effects analysis of
the relationship between distractor recognition times and specificity, having specificity
(general / specific) as a fixed effect, intercepts for subjects and items, and also by-subject
and by-item random slopes for the effects of specificity.

Regarding hypothesis h2a, we notice that adding a more general property decreases
mean inspection times. Regarding h2b, we notice that adding a more specific property
has the opposite effect. A likelihood ratio test of the full model against the model
without this effect shows that the difference is significant (χ2(1) = 13.28, p = 0.009984).

Discussion Once again, referential overspecification may be either helpful or detri-
mental, depending on the effort (presently modeled by examples of general/specific
properties) required to process redundant information marked as restrictive. Adding an
easily recognizable property (“letter”) helps, whereas adding a more “difficult” prop-
erty (“consonant”) impairs identification. This outcome is consistent with Experiment 1,
but it is now observed in the use of a redundant atomic property (as opposed to using
a redundant relational property, cf. Section 3.1).

4. Final Remarks

This article addressed the issue of how the effort involved in the recognition of over-
specified information may affect identification. Our findings suggest that easily rec-
ognizable properties may facilitate identification, whereas properties that are more
difficult to recognize may have the opposite effect. These observations were shown
to hold for relational and atomic properties alike, and are in principle consistent
with existing studies that argue that referential overspecification helps identification,
and also with those that claim the opposite.

From a computational perspective, these insights are potentially relevant in a num-
ber of ways. In particular, we notice that inspection times may provide a suitable
account of salience for hearer-oriented REG. Knowing the amount of time required to
recognize different kinds of property may guide attribute selection in incremental-like
algorithms (Dale and Reiter 1995), for example, by considering properties that require
less cognitive effort first. Similarly, the effort required to recognize a relational property
may guide the decision of whether to use a relation or not, which is a longstanding
issue in the REG field (Dale and Haddock 1991; Viethen and Dale 2011). The design of
a REG algorithm along these lines—which would require measuring cognitive effort in
advance—is left as future work.

We note also that our study was carried out by taking a hearer-oriented perspective,
that is, by assuming that we would like to generate descriptions that facilitate identifi-
cation. This raises the question of whether speakers may actually favor the use of easy
properties in this way, or how often they do so. A speaker-oriented study of this kind is
also left as future work.
