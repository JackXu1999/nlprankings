Abstract

This paper describes LIUM submis-
sions to WMT17 News Translation Task
for English↔German, English↔Turkish,
English→Czech and English→Latvian
language pairs. We train BPE-based at-
tentive Neural Machine Translation sys-
tems with and without factored outputs
using the open source nmtpy framework.
Competitive scores were obtained by en-
sembling various systems and exploiting
the availability of target monolingual cor-
pora for back-translation. The impact
of back-translation quantity and quality is
also analyzed for English→Turkish where
our post-deadline submission surpassed
the best entry by +1.6 BLEU.

1 Introduction

This paper describes LIUM Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) submissions to WMT17
News Translation Task for English↔German,
English↔Turkish, English→Czech and
English→Latvian language pairs. We exper-
imented with and without back-translation data
for English↔German and English↔Turkish
which are respectively described in Sections 3
and 4. For the latter pair, we also present an
analysis about the impact of back-translation
quality and quantity as well as two architectural
ablations regarding the initialization and the
output of recurrent decoder (Section 3).

Experiments for English→Czech and
English→Latvian are performed using Fac-
tored NMT (FNMT) (García-Martínez et al.,
2016) systems. FNMT is an extension of NMT
which aims at simultaneously predicting the
canonical form of a word and its morphological
information needed to generate the final surface

form. The details and results are presented in sec-
tion 5. All submitted systems1 are trained using
the open source nmtpy2 framework (Caglayan
et al., 2017).

2 Baseline NMT

Our baseline NMT is an attentive encoder-decoder
(Bahdanau et al., 2014) implementation. A bi-
directional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Chung
et al., 2014) encoder is used to compute source
sentence annotation vectors. We equipped the en-
coder with layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), a
technique which adaptively normalizes the incom-
ing activations of each hidden unit with a learnable
gain and bias, after empirically observing that it
improves both convergence speed and translation
performance.

A conditional GRU (CGRU) (Firat and Cho,
2016; Sennrich et al., 2017) decoder with atten-
tion mechanism is used to generate a probability
distribution over target tokens for each decoding
step t. The hidden state of the CGRU is initialized
using a non-linear transformation of the average
encoder state produced by the encoder. Follow-
ing Inan et al. (2016); Press and Wolf (2017), the
feedback embeddings (input to the decoder) and
the output embeddings are tied to enforce learn-
ing a single target representation and decrease the
number of total parameters by target vocabulary
size × embedding size.

We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as the
optimizer with a learning rate of 4e−4. Weights
are initialized with Xavier scheme (Glorot and
Bengio, 2010) and the total gradient norm is
clipped to 5 (Pascanu et al., 2013). When stated,
three dropouts (Srivastava et al., 2014) are ap-
plied after source embeddings, encoder hidden

states and pre-softmax activations respectively.
The training is early stopped if validation set
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) does not improve
for a given number of consecutive validations. A
beam size of 12 is used for beam-search decod-
ing. Other hyper-parameters including layer di-
mensions and dropout probabilities are detailed
for each language pair in relevant sections.

3 English↔Turkish
3.1 Training

We use SETIMES2 which consists of 207K paral-
lel sentences for training, newsdev2016 for early-
stopping, and newstest2016 for model selection
(internal test). All sentences are normalized and
tokenized using normalize-punctuation and tok-
enizer 3 from Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Train-
ing sentences that have less than 3 and more
than 50 words are filtered out and a joint Byte
Pair Encoding (BPE) model (Sennrich et al.,
2016b) with 16K merge operations is learned on
train+newsdev2016. The resulting training set has
200K sentences and 5.5M tokens (Table 1) where
∼63% and ∼50% of English and Turkish vocabu-
laries is composed of a common set of tokens.

Turkish 12433 = 6285 Common + 6148 Tr

Combined 16189

Table 1: Sub-word statistics for English, Turkish
and Combined vocabularies.

All models use 200-dimensional embeddings
and GRU layers with 500 hidden units. The
dropout probability Pdrop is used for all 3 dropouts
and set to 0.2 and 0.3 for EN→TR and TR→EN
respectively. The validation BLEU is computed
after each ∼1/4 epoch and the training stops if no
improvement is achieved after 20 consecutive val-
idations.

Data Augmentation Due to the low-resource
characteristic of EN↔TR, additional training
data has been constructed using back-translations
(BT) (Sennrich et al., 2016a) where target-side
monolingual data is translated to source lan-
guage to form a Source→Target synthetic cor-
pus. newscrawl2016 (1.7M sentences) and

3The tokenizer is slightly modified to fix handling of apos-
trophe splitting in Turkish.

newscrawl2014 (3.1M sentences) are used as
monolingual data for Turkish and English respec-
tively. Although we kept the amount of synthetic
data around ∼150K sentences for submitted sys-
tems to preserve original-to-synthetic ratio, we
present an analysis about the impact of synthetic
data quantity/quality as a follow-up study in Sec-
tion 3.3. All back-translations are produced using
the NMT systems described in this study.

3-way Tying (3WT) In addition to tying feed-
back and output embeddings (Section 2), we ex-
periment with 3-way tying (3WT) (Press and
Wolf, 2017) only for EN→TR where we use the
same embeddings for source, feedback and output
embeddings. A combined vocabulary of∼16K to-
kens (Table 1) is then used to form a bilingual rep-
resentation space.

Init-0 Decoder The attention mechanism (Bah-
danau et al., 2014) introduces a time-dependent
context vector (weighted sum of encoder states)
as an auxiliary input to the decoder allowing
implicit encoder-to-decoder connection through
which the error back-propagates towards source
embeddings. Although this makes it unnecessary
to initialize the decoder, the first hidden state of the
decoder is generally derived from the last (Bah-
danau et al., 2014) or average encoder state (Sen-
nrich et al., 2017) in common practice. To under-
stand the impact of this, we train additional Init-0
EN→TR systems where the decoder is initialized
with an all-zero vector instead of average encoder
state.

3.2 Submitted Systems

Each system is trained twice with different seeds
and the one with better newstest2016 BLEU is
kept when reporting single systems. Ensembles by
default use the best early-stop checkpoints of both
seeds unless otherwise stated. Results for both di-
rections are presented in Table 2.

TR→EN baseline (E1) achieves 14.2 BLEU on
newstest2017. The (E2) system trained with ad-
ditional 150K BT data surpasses the baseline by
∼2 BLEU on newstest2017. The EN→TR system
used for BT is a single (T5) system which is itself
a BT-enhanced NMT. A contrastive system (E3)
with less dropout (Pdrop = 0.2) is used for our fi-
nal submission which is an ensemble of 4 systems
(2 runs of E2 + 2 runs of E3). In overall, an im-
provement of ∼3.7 BLEU over the baseline sys-

289



tem is achieved by making use of a small quantity
of BT data and ensembling.

EN→TR baseline (T1) achieves 11.1 BLEU on
newstest2017 (Table 2). (T2) which is augmented
with 150K synthetic data, improves over (T1) by
2.5 BLEU. It can be seen that once 3-way tying
(3WT) is enabled, a consistent improvement of up
to 0.6 BLEU is obtained on newstest2017. We
conjecture that 3WT is beneficiary (especially in a
low-resource regime) when the intersection of vo-
cabularies is a large set since the embedding of a
common token will now receive as many updates
as its occurrence count in both sides of the cor-
pus. On the other hand, the initialization method
of the decoder does not seem to incur a significant
change in BLEU. Finally, using an ensemble of
4 3WT-150K-BT systems with different decoder
initializations (2xT5 + 2xT6), an overall improve-
ment of 4.9 BLEU is obtained over (T1). As a
side note, 3WT reduces the number of parameters
by ∼10% (12M→10.8M).

3.3 Follow-up Work

We dissect the output layer of CGRU NMT (Sen-
nrich et al., 2017) which is conditioned (Equa-
tion 1) on the hidden state ht of the decoder, the
feedback embedding yt−1 and the weighted con-
text vector ct. We experiment with a simple output
(Equation 2) which depends only on ht similar to
Sutskever et al. (2014). The target probability dis-
tribution is computed (Equation 3) using softmax
on top of this output transformed with Wo.

ot = tanh(Whht + yt−1 +Wcct) (1)

ot = tanh(Whht) (2)

P (yt) = softmax(Woot) (3)

Table 3: Impact of back-translation quantity and
quality for EN→TR: all systems are 3WT, (B0) is
the same as (T4) from Table 2.

As a second follow-up experiment, we analyse
the impact of BT data quantity and quality on final
performance. Four training sets are constructed by
taking the original 200K training set and gradually
growing it with BT data of size 150K, 690K, 1.0M
and 1.7M (all-BT) sentences respectively. The
source side of the monolingual Turkish data used
to create the synthetic corpus are translated to En-
glish using two different TR→EN systems namely
(E1) and (E2) where the latter is better than former
on newstest2016 by 2.4 BLEU (Table 2).

The results are presented in Table 3 and 4. First,
(B1) trained with only synthetic data turns out to
be superior than the baseline (B0) by 3.2 BLEU.
The ensemble of (B1) even surpasses our primary
submission. Although this may indicate the im-
pact of training set size for NMT where a large
corpus with synthetic source sentences leads to
better performance than a human-translated but
small corpus, a detailed analysis would be neces-
sary to reveal other possible reasons.

Second, it is evident that increasing the amount
of BT data is beneficial regardless of original-
to-synthetic ratio: the system (B6) achieves
+4.6 BLEU compared to (B0) on newstest2017
(11.6→16.2). The single (B6) is even slightly
better than our ensemble submission (Table 4).
The +2.4 BLEU gap between back-translators E1
and E2 does not seem to affect final performance
where both groups achieve more or less the same
scores.

Finally, the Simple Output seems to perform
slightly better than the original output formula-
tion. In fact, our final post-deadline submission
which surpasses the winning UEDIN system4 by
1.6 BLEU (Table 4) is an ensemble of four (B6)
systems two of them being SimpleOut. Condition-
ing the target distribution over the weighted con-
text vector ct creates an auxiliary gradient flow
from the cross-entropy loss to the encoder by skip-
ping the decoder. We conjecture that conditioning
only over the decoder’s hidden state ht forces the
network (especially the decoder) to better learn the
target distribution. Same gradient flow also hap-
pens for feedback embeddings in the original for-
mulation (Equation 1).

4 English↔German
We train two types of model: first is trained with
only parallel data provided by WMT17 (5.6M
sentences), the second uses the concatenation
(9.3M sentences) of the provided parallel data and
UEDIN WMT16 back-translation corpus 5. Prior
to training, all sentences are normalized, tokenized
and truecased using normalize-punctuation, tok-
enizer and truecaser from Moses (Koehn et al.,
2007). Training sentences with less than 2 and
more than 100 units are filtered out. A joint
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) model (Sennrich et al.,
2016b) with 50K merge operations is learned on
the training data. This results in a vocabulary of
50K and 53K tokens for English and German re-
spectively.

The training is stopped if no improvement is ob-
served during 30 consecutive validations on new-

stest2015. Final systems are selected based on
newstest2016 BLEU.

4.1 Submitted Systems
EN→DE The baseline which is an NMT with
256-dimensional embeddings and 512-units GRU
layers, obtained 23.26 BLEU on newstest2017
(Table 5). The addition of BT data improved this
baseline by 1.7 BLEU (23.26→24.94). Our pri-
mary submission which achieved 26.60 BLEU is
an ensemble of 4 systems: 2 best checkpoints of
an NMT and 2 best checkpoints of an NMT with
0-initialized decoder (See section 3.1).

DE→EN Our primary DE→EN system (Ta-
ble 5) is an ensemble without back-translation
(No-BT) of two NMT systems with different di-
mensions: 256-512 and 384-640 for embeddings
and GRU hidden units respectively. Our post-
deadline submission which is an ensemble with
back-translation (BT) improved over our primary
system by +4.5 BLEU and obtained 33.9 BLEU on
newstest2017. This ensemble consists of 6 differ-
ent systems (by varying the seed and the embed-
ding and the GRU hidden unit size) trained with
WMT17 and back-translation data.

5 English→{Czech,Latvian}
The language pairs English→Czech and
English→Latvian are translated using a Fac-
tored NMT (FNMT) system where two symbols
are generated at the same time. The FNMT
systems are compared to a baseline NMT system
similar to the one described in Section 2.

5.1 Factored NMT systems
The FNMT system (García-Martínez et al., 2016)
is an extension of NMT where the lemma and the
Part of Speech (PoS) tags of a word (i.e. factors)

291



are produced at the output instead of its surface
form. The two output symbols are then combined
to generate the word using external linguistic re-
sources. The low frequency words in the training
set can benefit from sharing the same lemma with
other high frequency words, and also from shar-
ing the factors with other words having the same
factors. The lemma and its factors can sometimes
generate new surface words which are unseen in
the training data. The vocabulary of the target lan-
guage contains only lemmas and PoS tags but the
total number of surface words that can be gen-
erated (i.e. virtual vocabulary) is larger because
of the external linguistic resources that are used.
This allows the system to correctly generate words
which are considered unknown words in word-
based NMT systems.

We experimented with two types of FNMT sys-
tems which have a second output in contrast to
baseline NMT. The first one contains a single hid-
den to output layer (h2o) which is then used by two
separate softmaxes while the second one contains
two separate h2o layers each specialized for a par-
ticular output. The lemma and factor sequences
generated by these two outputs are constrained to
have the same length.

The results reported in Tables 6 and 7 are
computed with multi-bleu.perl which makes them
consistently lower than official evaluation matrix
scores6.

5.2 Training

All models use 512-dimensional embeddings and
GRU layers with 1024 hidden units. The val-
idation BLEU is computed after each 20K up-
dates and the training stops if no improvement is
achieved after 30 consecutive validations. The rest
of the hyperparameters are the same as Section 2.

The NMT systems are trained using all the pro-
vided bitext processed by a joint BPE model with
90K merge operations. The sentences longer than
50 tokens are filtered out after BPE segmenta-
tion. For FNMT systems, BPE is applied on the
lemma sequence and the corresponding factors are
repeated when a split occurs.

We also trained systems with synthetic data
which are initialized with a previously trained
model on the provided bitext only. For these sys-
tems, the learning rate is set to 0.0001 and the val-
idations are performed every 5K updates in order

6http://matrix.statmt.org

to avoid overfitting on synthetic data and forget-
ting the previously learned weights. Two mod-
els with different seeds are trained for NMT and
FNMT systems for ensembling purposes.

5.3 N-best Reranking

We experimented with different types of N-best
reranking of hypotheses generated with beam
search (beam size = 12) using our best FNMT.
For each hypothesis, we generate the surface form
with the factors-to-word procedure, which can be
ambiguous. Since a single {lemma, factors} pair
may lead to multiple possible words, k possible
words are considered for each pair (with k being
10 for Czech and 100 for Latvian). Finally, the
hypotheses are rescored with our best word-based
NMT model to select the 1-best hypothesis.

For English→Latvian, we have also performed
N-best reranking with two Recurrent Neural Net-
work Language Models (RNNLM), a simple
RNNLM (Mikolov et al., 2010) and GRU-based
RNNLM included in nmtpy. The RNNLMs are
trained on WMT17 Latvian monolingual corpus
and the target side of the available bitext (175.2M
words in total). For the FNMT system, the log
probability obtained by our best word-based NMT
model is also used in addition to the RNNLM
scores. The reranking is done using the nbest tool
provided by the CSLM toolkit7 (Schwenk, 2010).
(The score weights were optimized with CON-
DOR (Vanden Berghen and Bersini, 2005) to max-
imize the BLEU score on newsdev2017 set.)

5.4 English→Czech
The English→Czech systems are trained using
approximately 20M sentences from the relevant
news domain parallel data provided by WMT17.
Early stopping is performed using newstest2015
and newstest2016 is used as internal test set. All
datasets are tokenized and truecased using the
Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). PoS tagging
is performed with Morphodita toolkit (Straková
et al., 2014) as well as the reinflection to go from
factored representation to word. Synthetic data
is generated from news-2016 monolingual corpus
provided by Sennrich et al. (2016a). In order to
focus more on the provided bitext, five copies of
news-commentary and the czeng news dataset are
added to the backtranslated data. Also, 5M sen-

tences from the czeng EU corpus applying modi-
fied Moore-Lewis filtering with XenC (Rousseau,
2013). We end up with about 14M sentences and
322M words for English and 292M for Czech.

5.5 English→Latvian
The English→Latvian systems are trained using
all the parallel data available for the WMT17 eval-
uation campaign. Data selection was applied to
the DCEP corpus resulting in 2M parallel sen-
tences.The validation set consists of 2K sentences
extracted from the LETA corpus and newsdev2017
is used as internal test set.

Monolingual corpora news-2015 and 2016 were
backtranslated with a Moses system Koehn et al.
(2007). Similarly to Czech, we added ten copies
of the LETA corpus and two copies of Europarl
and rapid to perform corpus weighting. The final
corpus contains 7M sentences and 172M words for
English and 143M for Latvian.

All the Latvian preprocessing was provided by
TILDE.8 Latvian PoS-tagging is done with the LU
MII Tagger (Paikens et al., 2013). Since there is no
tool for Latvian to convert factors to words, all the
available WMT17 monolingual data has been au-
tomatically tagged and kept in a dictionary. This
dictionary maps the lemmas and factors to their
corresponding word. After preprocessing, we fil-
ter out training sentences with a maximum length
of 50 or with a source/target length ratio higher
than 3.

5.6 Analysis
We observe that including the synthetic parallel
data in addition to the provided bitext results in
a big improvement in NMT and FNMT for both

language pairs (see systems CS2 and CS5 in Ta-
ble 6 and LS2 and LS6 in Table 7). Applying the
ensemble of several models also gives improve-
ment for all systems (CS1-CS2 and LS1-LS4). N-
best reranking of FNMT systems (systems CS6
and LS7) shows bigger improvement when trans-
lating into Latvian than into Czech. This is due to
the quality of the dictionary used for reinflection
in each language. The Morphodita tool for Czech
includes only good candidates, besides a simi-
lar tool is not available for Latvian. The rerank-
ing with RNNLM gives an improvement for the
NMT and FNMT systems when translating Lat-
vian (LS3 and LS8). As a follow-up work after
submission, we ensembled two models applying
reranking for Latvian and got improvements (LE2-
LE4). Finally, the submitted translations for NMT
and FNMT systems obtain very similar automatic
scores. However, FNMT systems explicitly model
some grammatical information leading to differ-
ent lexical choices, which might not be captured
by the BLEU score. Human evaluation shows
for EN-LV task that NMT system obtained 43%
of standardized mean direct assessment score and
FNMT system obtained 43.2% showing a small
improvement in FNMT system. Both systems ob-
tained 55.2% in EN-CS task. Other analysis has
been done (Burlot and Yvon, 2017) about mor-
phology strength showing good results in EN-LV
task. FNMT system helps when the corpus is not
huge, this is the case of EN-LV task but EN-CS
dataset is huge. Therefore, NMT system has al-
ready the information to learn the morphology.

6 Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we presented LIUM machine trans-
lation systems for WMT17 news translation task
which are among the top submissions according
the official evaluation matrix. All systems are
trained using additional synthetic data which sig-
nificantly improved final translation quality.

For English→Turkish, we obtained (post-
deadline) state-of-the-art results with a small
model (∼11M params) by tying all the embed-
dings in the network and simplifying the output
of the recurrent decoder. One other interesting ob-
servation is that the model trained using only syn-
thetic data surpassed the one trained on genuine
translation corpus. This may indicate that for low-
resource pairs, the amount of training data is much
more important than the correctness of source-side
sentences.

For English→Czech and English→Latvian
pairs, the best factored NMT systems performed
equally well compared to NMT systems. How-
ever, it is important to note that automatic met-
rics may not be suited to assess better lexical and
grammatical choices made by the factored sys-
tems.
