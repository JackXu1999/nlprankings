Abstract
For machine translation, a vast majority of
language pairs in the world are considered
low-resource because they have little paral-
lel data available. Besides the technical chal-
lenges of learning with limited supervision, it
is difficult to evaluate methods trained on low-
resource language pairs because of the lack of
freely and publicly available benchmarks. In
this work, we introduce the FLORES evalua-
tion datasets for Nepali–English and Sinhala–
English, based on sentences translated from
Wikipedia. Compared to English, these are
languages with very different morphology and
syntax, for which little out-of-domain paral-
lel data is available and for which relatively
large amounts of monolingual data are freely
available. We describe our process to col-
lect and cross-check the quality of translations,
and we report baseline performance using sev-
eral learning settings: fully supervised, weakly
supervised, semi-supervised, and fully unsu-
pervised. Our experiments demonstrate that
current state-of-the-art methods perform rather
poorly on this benchmark, posing a challenge
to the research community working on low-
resource MT. Data and code to reproduce our
experiments are available at https://github.
com/facebookresearch/flores.

1 Introduction

Research in Machine Translation (MT) has seen
significant advances in recent years thanks to im-
provements in modeling, and in particular neural
models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al.,
2015; Gehring et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017),
as well as the availability of large parallel cor-
pora for training (Tiedemann, 2012; Smith et al.,

2013; Bojar et al., 2017). Indeed, modern neural
MT systems can achieve near human-level trans-
lation performance on language pairs for which
sufficient parallel training resources exist (e.g.,
Chinese–English translation (Hassan et al., 2018)
and English–French translation (Gehring et al.,
2016; Ott et al., 2018a).

Unfortunately, MT systems, and in particular
neural models, perform poorly on low-resource
language pairs, for which parallel training data
is scarce (Koehn and Knowles, 2017). Improv-
ing translation performance on low-resource lan-
guage pairs could be very impactful considering
that these languages are spoken by a large fraction
of the world population.

Technically, there are several challenges to
solve in order to improve translation for low-
resource languages. First, in face of the scarcity
of clean parallel data, MT systems should be able
to use any source of data available, namely mono-
lingual resources, noisy comparable data, as well
as parallel data in related languages. Second,
we need reliable public evaluation benchmarks to
track progress in translation quality.

Building evaluation sets on low-resource lan-
guages is both expensive and time-consuming be-
cause the pool of professional translators is lim-
ited, as there are few fluent bilingual speakers for
these languages. Moreover, the quality of profes-
sional translations for low-resource languages is
not on par with that of high-resource languages,
given that the quality assurance processes for the
low-resource languages are often lacking or un-
der development. Also, it is difficult to verify the
quality of the human translations as an non-native
speaker, because the topics of the documents in
these low-resource languages may require knowl-

edge and context coming from the local culture.
In this work, we introduce new evaluation

benchmarks on two very low-resource language
pairs: Nepali–English and Sinhala–English. Sen-
tences were extracted from Wikipedia articles
in each language and translated by professional
translators. The datasets we release to the commu-
nity are composed of a tune set of 2559 and 2898
sentences, a development set of 2835 and 2766
sentences, and a test set of 2924 and 2905 sen-
tences for Nepali–English and Sinhala–English re-
spectively.

In §3, we describe the methodology we used
to collect the data as well as to check the qual-
ity of translations. The experiments reported in
§4 demonstrate that these benchmarks are very
challenging for current state-of-the-art methods,
yielding very low BLEU scores (Papineni et al.,
2002) even using all available parallel data as well
as monolingual data or Paracrawl1 filtered data.
This suggests that these languages and evaluation
benchmarks can constitute a useful test-bed for
developing and comparing MT systems for low-
resource language pairs.

2 Related Work

There is ample literature on low-resource MT.
From the modeling side, one possibility is to de-
sign methods that make more effective use of
monolingual data. This is a research avenue
that has seen a recent surge of interest, starting
with semisupervised methods relying on back-
translation (Sennrich et al., 2015), integration of a
language model into the decoder (Gulcehre et al.,
2017; Stahlberg et al., 2018) all the way to fully
unsupervised approaches (Lample et al., 2018b;
Artetxe et al., 2018), which use monolingual data
both for learning good language models and for
fantasizing parallel data. Another avenue of re-
search has been to extend the traditional super-
vised learning setting to a weakly supervised one,
whereby the original training set is augmented
with parallel sentences mined from noisy com-
parable corpora like Paracrawl. In addition to
the challenge of learning with limited supervi-
sion, low-resource language pairs often involve
distant languages that do not share the same al-
phabet, or have very different morphology and
syntax; accordingly, recent work has begun to

1https://paracrawl.eu/

explore language-independent lexical representa-
tions to improve transfer learning (Gu et al., 2018).

In terms of low-resource datasets, DARPA
programs like LORELEI (Strassel and Tracey,
2016) have collected translations on several low-
resource languages like English–Tagalog. Unfor-
tunately, the data is only made available to the pro-
gram’s participants. More recently, the Asian Lan-
guage Treebank project (Riza et al., 2016) has in-
troduced parallel datasets for several low-resource
language pairs, but these are sampled from text
originating in English and thus may not general-
ize to text sampled from low-resource languages.

In the past, there has been work on extract-
ing high quality translations from crowd-sourced
workers using automatic methods (Zaidan and
Callison-Burch, 2011; Post et al., 2012). However,
crowd-sourced translations have generally lower
quality than professional translations. In contrast,
in this work we explore the quality checks that are
required to filter professional translations of low-
resource languages in order to build a high quality
benchmark set.

In practice, there are very few publicly avail-
able datasets for low-resource language pairs, and
often times, researchers simulate learning on low-
resource languages by using a high-resource lan-
guage pair like English–French, and merely lim-
iting how much labeled data they use for train-
ing (Johnson et al., 2016; Lample et al., 2018a).
While this practice enables a framework for easy
comparison of different approaches, the real prac-
tical implications deriving from these methods can
be unclear. For instance, low-resource languages
are often distant and often times corresponding
corpora are not comparable, conditions which are
far from the simulation with high-resource Euro-
pean languages, as has been recently pointed out
by Neubig and Hu (2018).

3 Methodology & Resulting Datasets

For the construction of our benchmark sets we
chose to translate between Nepali and Sinhala into
and out of English. Both Nepali and Sinhala are
Indo-Aryan languages with a subject-object-verb
(SOV) structure. Nepali is similar to Hindi in its
structure, while Sinhala is characterized by exten-
sive omissions of arguments in a sentence.

Nepali is spoken by about 20 million people
if we consider only Nepal, while Sinhala is spo-

6100

ken by about 17 million people just in Sri Lanka2.
Sinhala and Nepali have very little publicly avail-
able parallel data . For instance, most of the par-
allel corpora for Nepali–English originate from
GNOME and Ubuntu handbooks, and account for
about 500K sentence pairs.3 For Sinhala–English,
there are an additional 600K sentence pairs au-
tomatically aligned from from OpenSubtitles (Li-
son et al., 2018). Overall, the domains and quan-
tity of the existing parallel data are very lim-
ited. However, both languages have a rather large
amount of monolingual data publicly available
(Buck et al., 2014), making them perfect candi-
dates to track performance on unsupervised and
semi-supervised tasks for Machine Translation.

3.1 Document selection

To build the evaluation sets, we selected and pro-
fessionally translated sentences originating from
Wikipedia articles in English, Nepali and Sin-
hala from a Wikipedia snapshot of early May
2018. To select sentences for translation, we
first selected the top 25 documents that contain
the largest number of candidate sentences in each
source language. To this end, we defined can-
didate sentences4 as: (i) being in the intended
source language according to a language-id classi-
fier (Bojanowski et al., 2017)5, and (ii) having sen-
tences between 50 and 150 characters. Moreover,
we considered sentences and documents to be in-
adequate for translation when they contained large
portions of untranslatable content such as lists of
entities6. To avoid such lists we used the following
rules: (i) for English, sentences have to start with
an uppercase letter and end with a period; (ii) for
Nepali and Sinhala, sentences should not contain
symbols such as bullet points, repeated dashes, re-
peated periods or ASCII characters. The docu-
ment set, along with the categories of documents

2See https://www.ethnologue.com/language/npi
and https://www.ethnologue.com/language/sin.

3Nepali has also 4K sentences translated
from English Penn Tree Bank at http://
www.cle.org.pk/software/ling_resources/
UrduNepaliEnglishParallelCorpus.htm, which is
valuable parallel data.

4We first used HTML markup to split document text into
paragraphs. We then used regular expressions to split on
punctuation, e.g. full-stop, poorna virama (\u0964) and ex-
clamation marks.

5This is a necessary step as many sentences in foreign lan-
guage Wikipedias may be in English or other languages.

6For example, the Academy Awards page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_
for_Best_Supporting_Actor.

is presented in the Appendix, Table 8.

After the document selection process, we ran-
domly sampled 2,500 sentences for each language.
From English, we translated into Nepali and Sin-
hala, while from Sinhala and Nepali, we only
translated into English. We requested each string
to be translated twice by different translators.

3.2 Quality checks

Translating domain-specialized content such as
Wikipedia articles from and to low-resource lan-
guages is challenging: the pool of available trans-
lators is limited, there is limited context available
to each translator when translating one string at a
time, and some of the sentences can contain code-
switching (e.g. text about Buddhism in Nepali or
Sinhala can contain Sanskrit or Pali words). As a
result, we observed large variations in the level of
translation quality, which motivated us to enact a
series of automatic and manual checks to filter out
poor translations.

We first used automatic methods to filter out
poor translations and sent them for rework. Once
the reworked translations were received, we sent
all translations (original or reworked) that passed
the automatic checks to human quality checks.
Translations which failed human checks, were dis-
regarded. Only the translations that passed all
checks were added to the evaluation benchmark,
although some source sentences may have less
than two translations. Below, we describe the au-
tomatic and manual quality checks that we applied
to the datasets.

Automatic Filtering. The guiding principles
underlying our choice of automatic filters are:
(i) translations should be fluent (Zaidan and
Callison-Burch, 2011), (ii) they should be suffi-
ciently different from the source text, (iii) trans-
lations should be similar to each other, yet not
equal; and (iv) translations should not be translit-
erations. In order to identify the vast majority
of translation issues we filtered by: (i) applying
a count-based n-gram language model trained on
Wikipedia monolingual data and removing trans-
lations that have perplexity above 3000.0 (English
translations only), (ii) removing translations that
have sentence-level char-BLEU score between the
two generated translations below 15 (indicating
disparate translations) or above 90 (indicating sus-
piciously similar translations), (iii) removing sen-

tences that contain at least 33% transliterated
words, (iv) removing translations where at least
50% of words are copied from the source sentence,
and (v) removing translations that contain more
than 50% out-of-vocabulary words or more than
5 total out-of-vocabulary words in the sentences
(English translations only). For this, the vocab-
ulary was calculated on the monolingual English
Wikipedia described in Table 2.

Manual Filtering. We followed a setup similar
to direct assessment (Graham et al., 2013). We
asked three different raters to rate sentences from
0–100 according to the perceived translation qual-
ity. In our guidelines, the 0–10 range represents
a translation that is completely incorrect and in-
accurate, the 70–90 range represents a translation
that closely preserves the semantics of the source
sentence, while the 90–100 range represents a per-
fect translation. To ensure rating consistency, we
rejected any evaluation set in which the range of
scores among the three reviewers was above 30
points, and requested a fourth rater to break ties,
by replacing the most diverging translation rating
with the new one. For each translation, we took the
average score over all raters and rejected transla-
tions whose scores were below 70.

To ensure that the translations were as fluent as
possible, we also designed an Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk (AMT) monolingual task to judge the flu-
ency of English translations. Regardless of con-
tent preservation, translations that are not fluent in
the target language should be disregarded. For this
task, we then asked five independent human an-
notators to rate the fluency of each English trans-
lation from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent), and retained
only those above 3.Additional statistics of auto-
matic and manual filtering stages can be found in
Appendix.

3.3 Resulting Datasets

We built three evaluation sets for each language
pair using the data that passed our automatic and
manual quality checks: dev (tune), devtest (valida-
tion) and test (test). The tune set is used for hyper-
parameter tuning and model selection, the valida-
tion set is used to measure generalization during
development, while the test set is used for the final
blind evaluation.

To measure performance in both directions (e.g.
Sinhala–English and English–Sinhala), we built
test sets with mixed original-translationese (Ba-

reduce the effect of the source language on the
quality of the resulting evaluation benchmark, di-
rect and reverse translations were mixed at an ap-
proximate 50-50 ratio for the devtest and test sets.
On the other hand, the dev set was composed of
the remainder of the available translations, which
were not guaranteed to be balanced. Before selec-
tion, the sentences were grouped by document, to
minimize the number of documents per evaluation
set.

In Table 1 we present the statistics of the re-
sulting sets. For Sinhala–English, the test set
is composed of 850 sentences originally in En-
glish, and 850 originally in Sinhala. We have ap-
proximately 1.7 translations per sentence. This
yielded 1,465 sentence pairs originally in English,
and 1,440 originally in Sinhalese, for a total of
2,905 sentences. Similarly, for Nepali–English,
the test set is composed of 850 sentences orig-
inally in English, and 850 originally in Nepali.
This yielded 1,462 sentence pairs originally in En-
glish and 1,462 originally in Nepali, for a total of
2,924 sentence pairs. The composition of the rest
of the sets can be found in Table 1.

In Appendix Table 6, we present the aggre-
gate distribution of topics per sentence for the
datasets in Nepali–English and Sinhala–English,
which shows a diverse representation of topics
ranging from General (e.g. documents about tires,
shoes and insurance), History (e.g. documents
about history of the radar, the Titanic, etc.) to Law
and Sports. This richness of topics increases the
difficulty of the set, as it requires models that are
rather domain-independent. The full list of docu-
ments and topics is also in Appendix, Table 8.

4 Experiments

In this section, we first describe the data used for
training the models, we then discuss the learning
settings and models considered, and finally we re-
port the results of these baseline models on the
new evaluation benchmarks.

4.1 Training Data

Small amounts of parallel data are available
for Sinhala–English and Nepali–English. Statis-
tics can be found in Table 2. This data
comes from different sources. Open Subtitles
and GNOME/KDE/Ubuntu come from the OPUS
repository7. Global Voices is an updated version
(2018q4) of a data set originally created for the
CASMACAT project8. Bible translations come
from the bible-corpus9. The Paracrawl corpus
comes from the Paracrawl project10. The filtered
version (Clean Paracrawl) was generated using the
LASER model (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2018) to get
the best sentence pairs having 1 million English to-
kens as specified in Chaudhary et al. (2019). We
also contrast this filtered version with a randomly
filtered version (Random Paracrawl) with the same
number of English tokens. Finally, our multi-
lingual experiments in Nepali use Hindi mono-
lingual (about 5 million sentences) and English-
Hindi parallel data (about 1.5 million parallel sen-
tences) from the IIT Bombay corpus11.

4.2 Training Settings

We evaluate models in four training settings. First,
we consider a fully supervised training setting us-
ing the parallel data listed in Table 2.

Second, we consider a fully unsupervised set-
ting, whereby only monolingual data on both
the source and target side are used to train the
model (Lample et al., 2018b).

Third, we consider a semi-supervised setting
where we also leverage monolingual data on the
target side using the standard back-translation
training protocol (Sennrich et al., 2015): we train
a backward MT system, which we use to translate
monolingual target sentences to the source lan-
guage. Then, we merge the resulting pairs of noisy

(back-translated) source sentences with the orig-
inal target sentences and add them as additional
parallel data for training source-to-target MT sys-
tem. Since monolingual data is available for both
languages, we train backward MT systems in both
directions and repeat the back-translation process
iteratively (He et al., 2016; Lample et al., 2018a).
We consider up to two back-translation iterations.
At each iteration we generate back-translations us-
ing beam search, which has been shown to per-
form well in low-resource settings (Edunov et al.,
2018); we use a beam width of 5 and individually
tune the length-penalty on the dev set.

Finally, we consider a weakly supervised setting
by using a baseline system to filter out Paracrawl
data using LASER (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2018)
by following the approach similar to Chaudhary
et al. (2019), in order to augment the original train-
ing set with a possibly larger but noisier set of par-
allel sentences.

6103

For Nepali only, we also consider training us-
ing Hindi data, both in a joint supervised and
semi-supervised setting. For instance, at each it-
eration of the joint semi-supervised setting, we
use models from the previous iteration to back-
translate English monolingual data into both Hindi
and Nepali, and from Hindi and Nepali mono-
lingual data into English. We then concatenate
actual parallel data and back-translated data of
the same language pair together, and train a new
model. We also consider using English-Hindi data
in the unsupervised scenario. In that setting, a
model is pretrained in an unsupervised way with
English, Hindi and Nepali monolingual data using
the unsupervised approach by Lample and Con-
neau (2019), and it is then jointly trained on both
the Nepali–English unsupervised learning task and
the Hindi-English supervised task (in both direc-
tions).

4.3 Models & Architectures

We consider both phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (PBSMT) and neural machine
translation (NMT) systems in our experiments.
All hyper-parameters have been cross-validated
using the dev set. The PBSMT systems use
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), with state-of-the-
art settings (5-gram language model, hierarchical
lexicalized reordering model, operation sequence
model) but no additional monolingual data to train
the language model.

The NMT systems use the Trans-
former (Vaswani et al., 2017) implementation in
the Fairseq toolkit (Ott et al., 2019); preliminary
experiments showed these to perform better than
LSTM-based NMT models. More specifically,
in the supervised setting, we use a Transformer
architecture with 5 encoder and 5 decoder layers,
where the number of attention heads, embedding
dimension and inner-layer dimension are 2, 512
and 2048, respectively. In the semi-supervised
setting, where we augment our small parallel
training data with millions of back-translated
sentence pairs, we use a larger Transformer
architecture with 6 encoder and 6 decoder layers,
where the number of attention heads, embedding
dimension and inner-layer dimension are 8, 512
and 4096, respectively. When we use multilin-
gual data, the encoder is shared in the {Hindi,
Nepali}–English direction, and the decoder is
shared in the English–{Hindi, Nepali}direction.

We regularize our models with dropout, label
smoothing and weight decay, with the correspond-
ing hyper-parameters tuned independently for
each language pair. Models are optimized with
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) using β1 = 0.9,
β2 = 0.98, and � = 1e − 8. We use the same
learning rate schedule as Ott et al. (2018b). We
run experiments on between 4 and 8 Nvidia V100
GPUs with mini-batches of between 10K and
100K target tokens following Ott et al. (2018b).
Code to reproduce our results can be found at
https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores.

4.4 Preprocessing and Evaluation
We tokenize Nepali and Sinhala using the Indic
NLP Library.12 For the PBSMT system, we to-
kenize English sentences using the Moses tok-
enization scripts. For NMT systems, we instead
use a vocabulary of 5K symbols based on a joint
source and target Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE; Sen-
nrich et al., 2015) learned using the sentencepiece
library13 over the parallel training data. We learn
the joint BPE for each language pair over the raw
English sentences and tokenized Nepali or Sinhala
sentences. We then remove training sentence pairs
with more than 250 source or target BPE tokens.

We report detokenized SacreBLEU (Post, 2018)
when translating into English, and tokenized
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) when translating
from English into Nepali or Sinhala.

4.5 Results
In the supervised setting, PBSMT performed quite
worse than NMT, achieving BLEU scores of
2.5, 4.4, 1.6 and 5.0 on English–Nepali, Nepali–
English, English–Sinhala and Sinhala–English, re-
spectively. Table 3 reports results using NMT in
all the other learning configurations described in
§4.2. There are several observations we can make.

First, these language pairs are very difficult, as
even supervised NMT baselines achieve BLEU
scores less than 8. Second and not surprisingly,
the BLEU score is particularly low when translat-
ing into the more morphologically rich Nepali and
Sinhala languages. Third, unsupervised NMT ap-
proaches seem to be ineffective on these distant
language pairs, achieving BLEU scores close to 0.
The reason for this failure is due to poor initializa-
tion of the word embeddings.

Table 3: BLEU scores of NMT using various learning settings on devtest (see §3). We report detokenized Sacre-
BLEU (Post, 2018) for {Ne,Si}→En and tokenized BLEU for En→{Ne,Si}.

Poor initialization can be attributed to to the
monolingual corpora used to train word embed-
dings which do not have sufficient number of over-
lapping strings, and are not comparable (Neubig
and Hu, 2018; Søgaard et al., 2018).

Fourth, the biggest improvements are brought
by the semi-supervised approach using back-
translation, which nearly doubles BLEU for
Nepali–English from 7.6 to 15.1 (+7.5 BLEU
points) and Sinhala–English from 7.2 to 15.1 (+7.9
BLEU points), and increases +2.5 BLEU points
for English–Nepali and +5.3 BLEU points for
English–Sinhala.

Fifth, additional parallel data in English-Hindi
further improves translation quality in Nepali
across all settings. For instance, in the Nepali–
English supervised setting, we observe a gain of
6.5 BLEU points, while in the semi-supervised
setting (where we back-translate also to and from
Hindi) the gain is 6.4 BLEU points. Similarly,
in the unsupervised setting, multilingual training
with Hindi brings Nepali–English to 3.9 BLEU
and English–Nepali to 2.5 BLEU; if however, the
architecture is pretrained as prescribed by Lam-
ple and Conneau (2019), BLEU score improves to
18.8 BLEU for Nepali–English and 8.3 BLEU for
English–Nepali.

Finally, the weakly supervised baseline using
the additional noisy parallel data described in §4.1
improves upon the supervised baseline in all four
directions. This is studied in more depth in Table 4
for Sinhala–English and Nepali–English. With-
out any filtering or with random filtering, BLEU
score is close to 0 BLEU. Applying the a fil-
tering method based on LASER scores (Artetxe
and Schwenk, 2018) provides an improvement
over using the unfiltered Paracrawl, of +5.5 BLEU
points for Nepali–English and +7.3 BLEU points
for Sinhala–English. Adding Paracrawl Clean
to the initial parallel data improves performance
by +2.0 and +3.7 BLEU points, for Nepali–
English and Sinhala–English, respectively.

Table 4: Weakly supervised experiments: Adding noisy par-
allel data from filtered Paracrawl improves translation quality

Table 2.

5 Discussion

In this section, we provide an analysis of the per-
formance on the Nepali to English devtest set us-
ing the semi-supervised machine translation sys-
tem, see Figure 1. Findings on other language di-
rections are similar.
Fluency of references: we observe no correla-
tion between the fluency rating of human refer-
ences and the quality of translations as measured
by BLEU. This suggests that the difficulty of the
translation task is not related to the fluency of the
references, at least at the current level of accuracy.
Document difficulty: we observe that translation
quality is similar across all document ids, with a
difference of 10 BLEU points between the docu-
ment that is the easiest and the hardest to trans-
late. This suggests that the random sampling pro-
cedure used to construct the dataset was adequate
and that no single Wikipedia document produces
much harder sentences than others.
Original vs translationese: we noticed that docu-
ments originating from Nepali are harder to trans-
late than documents originating in English. This
holds when performing the evaluation with the
supervised MT system: translations of original
Nepali sentences obtain 4.9 BLEU while Nepali
translationese obtain 9.1 BLEU. This suggests that
the existing parallel corpus is closer to English
Wikipedia than Nepali Wikipedia.

Figure 1: Analysis of the Ne→En devtest set using the semi-supervised machine translation system. Left: sentence level
BLEU versus AMT fluency score of the reference sentences in English; source sentences that have received more fluent human
translations are not easier to translate by machines. Right: average sentence level BLEU against Wikipedia document id from
which the source sentence was extracted; sentences have roughly the same degree of difficulty across documents since there is
no extreme difference between shortest and tallest bar. However, source sentences originating from Nepali Wikipedia (blue)
are translated more poorly than those originating from English Wikipedia (red). Documents are sorted by BLEU for ease of
reading.

5.1 Domain drift

To better understand the effect of domain mis-
match between the parallel dataset and the
Wikipedia evaluation set, we restricted the
Sinhala–English training set to only the Open Sub-
titles portion of the parallel dataset, and we held
out 1000 sentences for “in-domain” evaluation of
generalization performance. Table 5 shows that
translation quality on in-domain data is between
10 and 16 BLEU points higher. This may be due to
both domain mismatch as well as sensitivity of the
BLEU metric to sentence length. Indeed, there are
on average 6 words per sentences in the Open Sub-
titles test set compared to 16 words per sentence
in the FLORES devtest set. However, when we
train semi-supervised models on back-translated
Wikipedia data whose domain better matches the
“Out-of-domain” devtest set, we see much larger
gains in BLEU for the “Out-of-domain” set than
we see on the “In-domain” set, suggesting that do-
main mismatch is indeed a major problem.

Open Subtitles FLORES (devtest)

Sinhala–English
Supervised 23.5 7.2
Semi-sup. 28.1 (+20%) 15.1 (+210%)

English–Sinhala
Supervised 11.0 1.2
Semi-sup. 11.8 (+7%) 6.5 (+542%)

Table 5: In-domain vs. out-of-domain translation per-
formance (BLEU) for supervised and semi-supervised
NMT models. We report BLEU on a held-out subset of
1,000 sentences from the Open Subtitles training data
(see Table 2) and on devtest (see §3). Semi-supervised
models are trained on back-translated Wikipedia data.

6 Conclusions

One of the biggest challenges in MT today is
learning to translate low-resource language pairs.
Research in this area not only faces formidable
technical challenges, from learning with limited
supervision to dealing with very distant languages,
but it is also hindered by the lack of freely and
publicly available evaluation benchmarks.

In this work, we introduce and freely release to
the community FLORES benchmarks for Nepali–
English and Sinhala–English . Nepali and Sinhala
are languages with very different syntax and mor-
phology than English; also, very little parallel data
in these language pairs is publicly available. How-
ever, a good amount of monolingual data, paral-
lel data in related languages, and Paracrawl data
exist in both languages, making these two lan-
guage pairs a perfect candidate for research on
low-resource MT.

Our experiments show that current state-of-the-
art approaches perform rather poorly on these new
evaluation benchmarks, with semi-supervised and
in particular multi-lingual neural methods outper-
forming all the other model variants and training
settings we considered. We perform additional
analysis to probe the quality of the datasets. We
find no evidence of poor construction quality, yet
observe that the low BLEU scores are partly due to
the domain mismatch between the training and test
datasets. We believe that these benchmarks will
help the research community on low-resource MT
make faster progress by enabling free access to
evaluation data on actual low-resource languages
and promoting fair comparison of methods.

B Statistics of automatic filtering and manual filtering

Figure 2: Histogram of averaged translation quality score. We ask three different raters to rate each sentence from
0–100 according to the perceived translation quality. In our guidelines, the 0–10 range represents a translation that
is completely incorrect and inaccurate; the 11–29 range represents a translation with few correct keywords, but
the overall meaning is different from the source; the 30–50 range represents a translation that contains translated
fragments of the source string, with major mistakes; the 51–69 range represents a translation which is understand-
able and conveys the overall meaning of source string but contains typos or grammatical errors; the 70–90 range
represents a translation that closely preserves the semantics of the source sentence; and the 90–100 range repre-
sents a perfect translation. Translations with averaged translation score less than 70 (red line) are removed from
the dataset.

Figure 3: Histogram of averaged AMT fluency score of English translations. We ask five different raters to rate
each sentence from 1–5 according to its fluency. In our guidelines, the 1–2 range represents a sentence that is not
fluent, 3 is neutral, while the 4–5 range is for fluent sentences that raters can easily understand. Translations with
averaged fluency score less than 3 (red line) are removed from the dataset.

Table 7: Percentage of translations that did not pass the automatic and manual filtering checks. We first use
automatic methods to filter out poor translations and send those translations back for rework. We then collect
translations that pass the automatic filtering and send them to two human quality checks, one for adequacy and the
other for fluency. Note that the percentage of sentences that did not pass manual filtering is among those sentences
that passed the automatic filtering.
