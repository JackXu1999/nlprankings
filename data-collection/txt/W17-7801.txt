Abstract 

and 

in  Austria 

In  this  paper  we  present  a  semantic 
enrichment  approach  for  linking  two 
distinct  data  sets:  the  ÖBL  (Austrian 
Biographical  Dictionary) 
the 
(Database  of  Bavarian 
dbo@ema 
Dialects 
electronically 
mapped).  Although  the  data  sets  are 
different  in  their  content  and  in  the 
structuring  of  data,  they  contain  similar 
common  “entities”  such  as  names  of 
persons.  Here  we  describe  the  semantic 
enrichment  process  of  how  these  data 
sets  can  be  inter-linked  through  URIs 
(Uniform  Resource  Identifiers)  taking 
person  names  as  a  concrete  example. 
Moreover,  we  also  point  to  societal 
benefits  of  applying  such  semantic 
enrichment  methods  in  order  to  open 
and  connect  our  resources  to  various 
services.

Introduction 

 

In  the  Digital  Humanities  discourse,  the 
establishment  of  data  networks  and  creation  of 
links between different resources has been a key 
aspect. The linking of resources not only aims at 
enrichment,  but  more 
importantly  also  at 
providing wider access to data resources in local 
but  also  global  digital  infrastructures.  As  a 
consequence data use and re-use is enabled.  
One widely practised way of enabling semantic 
enrichment  and  linking  is  by  means  of  open-
source 
semantic  web 
technologies.  For  example  DBpedia  Spotlight 
(Mendes et al., 2011) provides the possibility to 
automatically 
documents  with 
mentions  of  DBpedia  resources.  The  tool  uses 
as  resource  types  the  classes  of  the  DBpedia 
Ontology,  thus  enabling  the  user  to  annotate 

relying  on

it  on  documents  written 

documents  with  272  different  entity  types. 
Furthermore, the user can choose the annotation 
domain by selecting the classes of the Ontology 
or  by  defining  them  via  a  SPARQL  query. 
Although DBpedia Spotlight is a powerful tool, 
it limits entity linking to only one resource, and 
was  developed  for  the  English  language.  To 
apply 
in  other 
languages, the models used by Spotlight have to 
be  adapted.  Babelfy  (Moro  et  al.,  2014)  uses  a 
graph-based approach to perform entity linking 
and  word  sense  disambiguation,  relying  on 
BabelNet  1.1.1  -  a  semantic  network  of 
Wikipedia  and  WordNet1  -  in  order  to  provide 
LOD2 
fragments. 
Babelfy’s main asset is the use of a multilingual 
encyclopedic 
resource 
knowledge  as  well,  however 
it  has 
the 
drawback,  that  the  resources  used  for  word 
sense  disambiguation  and  entity  linking  cannot 
be defined or chosen by the user. For knowledge 
networks  to  be  created  across  resources  and 
applied to  various  data  sets,  there is  a  need  for 
data to be processed by means of computational 
linguistic  tools  and  matched  preferably  against 
domain specific authority resources.

2  Data and resources 

The  data  behind  the  inter-linking  process  of 
the projects APIS and exploreAT! are extracted 
from the resources ÖBL (Austrian Biographical 
Dictionary;  Gruber  and  Feigl,  2009)  and 
dbo@ema7  (Database  of  Bavarian  Dialects  in 
Austria electronically  mapped) (cf. Wandl-Vogt 
et al., 2008).  In the realization of both projects, 
the  Austrian  Centre  for  Digital  Humanities 
(ACDH-ÖAW8)  plays  an  important  role.  They 
rely  on  data  from  the  respective  resources 
(ÖBL,  dbo@ema)  which  contain  similar  types 
of  elements  such  as  persons, 
locations, 
institutions and titles of written works.  In ÖBL 
this  concerns  the  names  of  important  historical 
figures, names of cities and countries relevant to

the  lives  of  the  people  in  the  biographies,  as 
well as titles of books, journals, or publications 
mentioned in the biographies. In the dbo@ema, 
on the other hand, we are dealing with names of 
locations  and  regions,  names  of  data  collectors 
or  authors  and  also  titles  of  dictionaries, 
dissertations  and  literature.  The  benefit  of 
linking the above mentioned data sets resides in 
the  possibility  to  enrich  the  biographies  with 
missing  information  contained  in  the  entries  of 
the dbo@ema and vice versa. Often for example 
the  list  of  literature  works  is  incomplete  in 
either  ÖBL  or  dbo@ema,  by  linking  the  two 
resources, the missing information can be added 
the other resource.

The ÖBL contains around 18.500 biographies 
and  serves  as  the  reference  work  for  APIS,  a 
project  which  aims  to  investigate  whether  a 
large  scale  lexicon  can  be  used  as  the  basis  of 
quantitative data analysis and how biographical 
research 
the  digital 
transformation  process  realized  in  APIS.  The 
lexicon  contains  biographies  of 
important 
historical  figures  from  the  Austro-Hungarian 
Monarchy  having  lived  in  the  time  period  of 
1815-1950.  The  data  is  not  only  published  in 
print,  but  it  is  also  available  in  the  machine 
readable XML format for the APIS project. An 
example  of  a  typical  ÖBL  data  entry  in  XML 
format is provided in Appendix. It is taken from 
the  biography  of  Johann  Willibald  Nagl,  an 
Austrian writer and germanist having lived and 
worked  on  the  turn  of  the  century.  The  entry 
contains  some  structured  information  in  XML 
elements  such  as  Geburt  (containing  place  and 
date  of  birth),  however  the  majority  of  the 
information  (in  this  specific  example  referring 
to  the  studies  and  the  career  path  of  August 
Schreiber)  is  embedded  in  the  unstructured 
XML  element  Haupttext  (i.e.  main  text).  The 
ÖBL  data  set  contains  not  only  the  18.500 
persons  the  biographies  were  written  about  but 
also  additional  individuals  mentioned  in  the 
main  text.  This  set  of  names  together  with  the 
persons  in  dbo@ema  creates  the  basis  for 
connecting 
two  projects  APIS  and 
exploreAT! via an automatic alignment process.  
The dbo@ema, on the other hand is to-date a 
part  of  the  Database  of  Bavarian  dialects  in 
Austria  (DBÖ)  which  forms  the  basis  of  the 
project  exploreAT!.  The  project  explores  this

dialect  data  of  the  Bavarian  dialects  in Austria 
from  perspectives  of  cultural  lexicography, 
semantic 
technologies,  visual  analysis  and 
citizen  science.  The  dbo@ema  is  a  MySQL 
database  that  comprises  of  a  collection  of 
dialect words of various fields of everyday life. 
Part  of  the  database  comprises  of  the  digitised 
data  originally  collected  by  means  of  paper 
questionnaires as well as the digitized entries of 
the plants (~32.000 headwords) and mushrooms 
collections  (~  1.000  headwords),  also  include 
names  of  places  and  regions  in  the  former 
Austro-Hungarian  Empire,  as  well  as  names  of 
data  collectors  or  authors  of  dictionaries, 
dissertations  or 
literature.  Data  concerning 
persons  involved  in  the  collection  are  for  the 
bigger  part  derived  from  internal  archival 
material  of  the  institute.  Initially,  the  available 
questionnaire  data  was  manually  entered  in 
TUSTEP 
(TUebingen  System  of  TExt 
processing  Programs)9,  a  professional  toolbox 
for  scholarly  processing  of  textual  data.  All  in 
all, the DBÖ counts around 3.5 million records 
and an estimated 200,000 headwords. 

3  Applying  semantic  web  technologies 
to inter-link heterogeneous  DH data 
sets 

In  many  projects  dealing  with  digital 
collections,  digital  content  is  generated  from 
scanned  books,  dictionaries,  maps,  etc. This  is, 
however, just the prerequisite for establishing a 
knowledge  base  which  is  usable  and  reusable 
within and across different disciplines. In order 
to  make  data  more  widely  available  in  a 
network  of  relevant  sources,  the  enrichment 
with  Linked  Open  Data 
is  key. 
Enrichment 
to  be 
is  a  process 
established  in  order  to  open  up  DH  data  sets 
(e.g.  lexicons,  encyclopedia,  dictionaries,  etc.) 
not only to the public, but also to the members 
of the research community and to industry.

that  has 

The  projects  APIS  and  exploreAT!  face  the 
challenge  that  the  valuable  information  they 
contain  is  embedded  in  different  data  models 
and  data  formats,  and  therefore  they  are  not 
completely  transparent  and  reusable  for  the

types,  among 

interested 
researchers,  domain  experts  and 
citizens. It is also the case in many other Digital 
Humanities  (DH)  projects  that  they  partially 
comprise of the same information embedded in 
different  resources. APIS  and  exploreAT!  have 
common  entity 
them  being 
persons,  locations,  names  of  written  works, 
which  when  being  identified  and  aligned,  can 
serve  as  the  basis  for  inter-linking  the  two 
projects.  This  allows  for  adding  missing 
information  from  the  complementary  data  set, 
uncovering  and  visualizing  networks  of 
common  entities,  and  expanding  the  search 
space by introducing new, joined data sets to the 
previously limited research environment. 
 

The  motivation  to  semantically  enrich  the 
ÖBL  data  collection  -  a  historically  and 
culturally  rich  heritage  data  -  is  a  main  goal  in 
the APIS project. We designed a workflow that 
is also applicable for the semantic annotation of 
other DH collections as well. This workflow is 
set  up  by  first  identifying  candidates  for  the 
linking process, in the second step linking them 
automatically  to  LOD  resources  and  finally 
approving and curating the results. In our study, 
we  link  entities  to  GeoNames  and  GND,  and 
plan  to  further  extend  the  pool  of  used  LOD 
resources with VIAF10. We use the linked LOD 
resources  to  enrich  our  data  with  missing 
information (e.g. to add name variants, latitude, 
longitude,  if  available  URI  of  corresponding 
Wikipedia article, etc. to our data sets), to detect 
possible errors in our data sets by comparing the 
information 
the 
information  contained  in  GeoNames/GND,  and 
to  make  it  machine  readable  and  searchable 
through  publishing  it  eventually  in  the  LOD 
cloud.  However 
significant 
vocabularies  such  as  GeoNames  and  GND  do 
not only provide valuable information, but also 
challenge  computational 
linguistic  systems. 
Some  of  the  problems  are  caused  by  the 
incompleteness  of  authority  files,  not  all 
person/place/institution  names  are  contained  in 
LOD  vocabularies.  However  this  problem  can 
be addressed by adding further resources to the 
system, for this reason we are planning to index 
VIAF in addition to GeoNames and GND. If an 
entity is present in a vocabulary, information in

a  biography  might  still  not  be  enough  to

only information about spouses, siblings, tutors, 
etc.  mentioned  in  the  biography  are  their  name 
and their relationship (father of, spouse, tutor of, 
etc.)  to  the  person  the  biography  was  written 
about. In this case relation extraction can help to

implemented  a  rule  based  approach  using  the

automatic disambiguation consist of fine-tuning 
the  Solr  indexes  of  place  names  and  person 
names, and adapting them to the characteristics 
of  the  input  data.  We  apply  heuristics  such  as 
indexing  only  person  names  from  geographical 
areas  relevant  to  the  data  sets  ÖBL  and 
dbo@ema. Thus we can decrease false matches 
caused  by  name-collisions  between  individuals 
having  born,  lived  and  died  in  areas  other  than 
ÖBL/ dbo@ema related ones.

For  the  realization  of  the  entity  linking, 
Apache  Stanbol12  has  been  chosen  as  an  open-
source, 
extendible 
implementation  framework  to  work  with.  The 
benefit  of  using Apache  Stanbol  is,  on  the  one 
hand its ability to create Referenced Sites (i.e. a 
local Apache Solr13 index of a knowledge base) 
from  any 
(publicly  available)  RDF-XML 
resource  and to  perform  Entity  Linking  against 
the  compiled  site.  Furthermore,  Stanbol  allows 
the  user  to  take  advantage  of  the  integrated 
Natural 
(NLP) 
frameworks such as OpenNLP14 in a free, open 
source  environment.  In APIS  we  have  set  up  a 
procedure  to  convert  unstructured,  full  text

Although  correction  methods  can  reduce  the 
error  rate  of  automatic  Entity  Linking,  some 
manual  correction  is  still  required,  hence  we 
foresee  a  manual  data  curation  process  to 
complement and correct the shortcomings of the 
automatic process. 

4  Data set analysis 

Analyzing  the  person  names  in  the  data  sets 
ÖBL  and  dbo@ema  the  following  figures 
emerged: in the ÖBL (counting the biographies 
written  until  the  beginning  of  the  project)  life 
stories  of  18219  persons  comprise  the  data  set 
of the APIS project, whereas the dbo@ema data 
resource  contains  8841  person  names.  When 
aligning  the  two  data  sets,  results  showed  that 
402  person  names  are  identical,  given  the 
criteria that the first name and the last name of 
the  corresponding  dbo@ema  and  ÖBL  entries 
have to  match exactly. Due to the fact, that the 
two data sets differ in how they model personal 
data (e.g. the ÖBL second name contains all the 
name variants of a person in a comma separated 
format,  whereas  the  dbo@ema  contains  a 
comma  in  the second  name  before  noble  titles) 
the  number  of  matches  between  the  two

resources  could  be  higher  after  reconciliation. 
Our analysis thus shows a first rough estimation 
about  how  many  persons  are  potentially 
overlapping  in  the  two  collections.  Further 
manual  curation  is  necessary  considering  that 
information  for  the  correct  identification  of  a 
person  is  often  missing  in  the  database.  The 
dbo@ema  often  lacks  the  information  about 
date  and  place  of  birth.  In  this  case  additional 
knowledge, such as the publications or names of 
relatives  can  be  used  to  identify  and  correctly 
find  the  person  from  the  dbo@ema  in  the 
Austrian  Biographical  Dictionary.  When 
narrowing down the criteria to exactly match on 
the first name, last name and year of birth, there 
are  only  35  entries  found  that  occur  in  both 
resources.  The  small  number  of  matches  can 
also be attributed to the fact, that in many cases 
basic  information  is  missing  for  the  exact 
identification  of  a  person.  To  overcome  this 
problem,  a  system  has  been  developed  in  the 
frame  of  the  APIS  project,  where  manual 
curation  of  entities  such  as  persons,  locations, 
institutions,  works  and  events  is  possible.  We 
foresee  that  a  manual  review  process  will  be 
carried  out  after  the  automatic  linking  of  the 
dbo@ema and ÖBL person data sets, in order to 
approve  correctly  established 
links,  revise 
erroneous 
add  missing 
information to both data sources. 
 

connections  and 

The  following  example  illustrates  how  the 
knowledge  sources  ÖBL  and  dbo@ema  are 
connected  to  each  other  via  the  GND  URI 
assigned to Johann Willibald Nagl, an Austrian 
writer  and  Germanist  appearing  in  both  data 
sets.  Nagls  ÖBL  biography  has  been  published 
online,  and  his  personal  data  (name,  date  and 
place  of  birth,  date  and  place  of  death)  is  also 
recorded in the dbo@ema database (see the two 
entries  of  Nagl  in  the  Appendix).  The  link 
between the two instances has been established 
by means of the Stanbol Entity Linking Module, 
which  identifies  Johann  Willibald  Nagl  as  a 
candidate for entity matching and looks it up in 
the Solr index created from GND person names.

With  the  help  of  a  web  application  being 
developed in APIS we are planning to evaluate 
the  quality  of 
linking  process.  The 
application is designed to support automatic and 
manual  annotation  within  one  system,  thus 
allowing  automatic  evaluation  of  annotation 
tasks.

In  this  paper  we  discussed  the  linking  of 
person  names  in  two  data  sets,  the  ÖBL  and 
dbo@ema. Our applied method has shown, that 
through the automatic entity linking process, the 
same  persons  occurring  in  different  resources 
can  be  detected  and  connected.  Through  the 
established  links  and  by  applying  the  relation 
extraction  method  implemented  in  the  APIS 
project,  a  link  across  the  data  sets  ÖBL  and 
dbo@ema  can  be  revealed,  giving  valuable 
information  of 
relations  among  persons 
mentioned. Our method is only in its developing 
stages  and  this  paper is  a  first  introduction.  By 
generating person networks including additional 
information  existent  in  the  ÖBL  or  dbo@ema, 
our  “social  network”  could  provide  a  valuable 

6

source  of  information  also  for  non-specialists. 
As  persons  mentioned  in  the  two  resources  are 
also  connected 
to  a  variety  of  personal 
information  (profession,  birth  place,  etc.), 
opening up and connecting our data sets to other 
services  for  societal  benefits  is  another  main 
goal.  Services  that  could  potentially  benefit 
from  our  generated  knowledge 
include 
Europeana collections or Museums. Connecting 
the  information  from  our  ÖBL  and  dbo@ema 
resources  to  current  collections  would  offer  a 
fruitful  collaboration  for  giving  citizens  access 
to otherwise hidden information.
