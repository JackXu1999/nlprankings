Abstract

Recent results show that both TAG and
Minimalist grammars can be enriched with
rational constraints without increasing their
strong generative capacity, where a con-
straint is rational iff it can be computed by
a bottom-up tree automaton. This raises the
question which aspects of syntax can be ad-
equately formalized using only such con-
straints. One of hardest phenomena com-
monly studied by syntacticians is binding
theory. In this paper, we give a high-level
implementation of (the syntactic parts of)
binding theory in terms of rational con-
straints, and we argue that this implemen-
tation is sufficiently powerful for natural
language. This conclusion is backed up
by data drawn from English, German, and
American Sign Language.

1 Introduction

Finite-state methods and tools are ubiquitous in
computational linguistics due to their ease of use,
attractive closure properties, and efficient runtime
behavior. At the level of trees, they are repre-
sented by rational constraints. A constraint is
called rational iff it defines a regular tree lan-
guage iff it can be computed by a bottom-up tree
automaton iff it is definable in monadic second-
order logic with predicates for immediate domi-
nance and linear precedence (Gécseg and Steinby,
1997).

Recently it was demonstrated that rational con-
straints can be added to TAG as well as Minimal-
ist grammars (MGs; Stabler, 2011) without in-
creasing their strong generative capacity (Rogers,
2003; Mönnich, 2006; Graf, 2011; Kobele, 2011).
At least in the case of MGs it is also known that

rational constraints are the most powerful class of
constraints for which this result holds. Therefore
any aspect of syntax that cannot be expressed in
terms of rational constraints requires a proper ex-
tension of the framework. Quick surveys in Graf
(2011) and Kobele (2011) suggest that rational
constraints are powerful enough for a rich vari-
ety of modifications and embellishment put for-
ward in the syntactic literature. One problematic
area, however, is binding theory, which is some-
times claimed to be NP-complete (Ristad, 1993)
and thus firmly outside the realm of finite-state
computability. In this paper we give a high-level
implementation of (syntactic) binding theory in
terms of rational constraints; we also argue that
this implementation is sufficiently powerful for
natural language and discuss potential counterex-
amples from several languages, foremost English
and American Sign Language (ASL).
Organization. The paper is laid out as follows. In
Sec. 2 we discuss the limitations of rational theo-
ries of binding and what they nonetheless need to
be capable of accounting for. The major stum-
bling block turns out to be the disjoint reference
requirement on pronouns. We give a finite-state
implementation in Sec. 3 that successfully cap-
tures this condition as long as there is an upper
bound on the number of antecedents needed for all
the pronouns in a specific domain. Sec. 4 demon-
strates that this assumption is empirically feasible.

2 Object Domain

Binding theory is a very active research area, with
proposals ranging from the purely syntactic to the
purely discourse-driven and covering almost ev-
ery shade in between. Thus it isn’t particularly
surprising that there is no consensus as to what

189



exactly a theory of binding needs to account for.
In this section we delineate the scope of a rational
theory of binding and highlight the main empir-
ical issue such an approach faces. We will see
that there are parts of binding theory that prov-
ably cannot be recast as rational constraints, but
also that those aren’t the aspects formal grammar
formalisms like TAG or MGs should be concerned
with.

A distinction is often made in the linguistic lit-
erature between syntactic binding and discourse
binding (Reinhart, 1983; Kiparsky, 2002; Reu-
land, 2011). Syntactic binding regulates the dis-
tribution of pronominals on a structural level and
thus is sensitive to c-command and locality ef-
fects.1 Discourse binding, on the other hand, is
agnostic about structure and cares mostly about
the compatibility of certain readings with an es-
tablished common ground and various pragmatic
considerations. For example, John cannot syntac-
tically bind him in John likes him due to a locality
constraint, but discourse binding might be possi-
ble nonetheless if the sentence is a facetious reply
to the statement that nobody likes John. The con-
ditions on discourse binding are rather ephemeral
(see Heim,1̇998 for further examples) and must be
evaluated with respect to highly detailed models
of the context of utterance. Thus it should come
as no surprise that we consider discourse binding
beyond the reach of rational constraints and focus
only on syntactic binding.

The decision to ignore any kind of non-
syntactic binding is also motivated by the formal
results of Ristad (1993). Ristad gives a proof that
canonical binding theory is NP-complete, which
entails that it cannot be captured by finite-state
devices. But his proof relies on configurations
where arguably no syntactic binding is involved,
such as weak crossover, ellipsis and Principle C
effects, all of which are assumed to be (at least
partially) regulated by semantics nowadays.

Syntactic binding is still a fuzzy concept,
though: does it regulate the availability of spe-
cific readings modulo discourse considerations,
or merely determine the syntactic distribution of
pronominals? The former implies the latter, but
not the other way round — verifying that a par-
ticular reading is available is not the same thing
as ensuring that a given sentence is grammatical

1We use pronominal as a catch-all term to refer to
anaphors and reflexives as well as pronouns.

under some interpretation. Seeing how both TAG
and MGs are primarily formal models of syntax,
we opt for the latter interpretation. A rational the-
ory of binding determines for any given sentence
whether it has some grammatical reading, while
the computation of available readings is relegated
to a dedicated semantic apparatus (Bonato, 2005;
Kobele, 2006).

This decision is further corroborated by an ob-
servation by Rogers (1998). Rogers implements
Principles A and B of the canonical binding the-
ory (Chomsky, 1981) in terms of rational con-
straints and proves that any rational binding the-
ory must be index-free. In the absence of indices
one can only guarantee that a suitable antecedent
exists for any given pronominal, but not which
specific constituent in the tree serves this role (un-
less there is exactly one).

Index-Free A rational binding theory does not
evaluate specific indexations. It only ensures
that some grammatical assignment of indices
exists.

This condition is at odds with common practice
among linguists, where sentences are analyzed
with respect to specific readings.

At least for English, though, the distinction is
irrelevant if one is interested only in regulating
the distribution of pronominals rather than their
interpretation. First of all, Index-Free is inconse-
quential for anaphora such as himself, whose dis-
tribution is regulated by Principle A. Principle
A requires for every anaphor to be syntactically
bound within its binding domain, but crucially,
two anaphors contained in the same binding do-
main may share an antecedent. Therefore we do
not need to know whether two anaphors have the
same referent, and indices — whose sole purpose
is to denote referents — are redundant.

This leaves us with the case of pronouns. Ac-
cording to the standard binding theory, a pronoun
must not be coreferent with any material in the
same binding domain. Hence a sentence like John
told Mary that he likes him is ungrammatical if
both pronouns are supposed to be bound by John.
However, pronouns can always get an interpreta-
tion from discourse; the pronouns in the example
sentence might refer to male individuals distinct
from John. Pronouns do not need a syntactic an-
tecedent at all, and hence they have the same dis-
tribution as normal DPs. This means that Princi-

190



ple B can be ignored and Index-Free is once again
irrelevant.

One might be tempted to conclude, then, that
Rogers’s rational binding theory is empirically
adequate despite the mandatory absence of in-
dices and consider the issue solved. But the
arguments above do not hold in full generality.
English has a rather impoverished inventory of
pronominals, and the bifurcation into anaphors
and pronouns is too simple from a cross-linguistic
perspective. Kiparsky (2002; 2012) proposes to
stratify pronominals depending on the maximum
size of their binding domain and whether there are
configurations in which they must be disjoint in
reference from other DPs. Pronominals with such
a disjointness requirement are obviative or, equiv-
alently, show obviation. Kiparsky’s system gives
rise to ten distinct types, eight of which are at-
tested empirically (see Tab. 1).

Our previous argument that Index-Free is un-
problematic for anaphors because they need not
be disjoint in reference carries over to all pronom-
inals that lack obviation effects. Likewise, indices
aren’t required for any pronominals that do not
need a syntactic antecedent, for the reasons we
just discussed. This still leaves us with two at-
tested subclasses, though: I) long-distance reflex-
ives such as Swedish sig that need an antecedent
which belongs to the same finite clause but is not a
coargument, and II) pronouns like Marathi aapan.
that cannot receive a referent from context or dis-
course. In neither case can the problem of deter-
mining the correct distribution be separated from
obviation, so that Rogers’s implementation is in-
sufficient in its current form.

What is needed, then, is a strategy for dealing
with obviation effects that can be implemented
with rational constraints. In combination with
suitable modifications of the definition of binding
domain in Rogers (1998), this would be enough to
cover all instances of syntactic binding identified
by Kiparsky (the first three columns in Tab. 1).

Note that this is relevant even if one is only in-
terested in English. While unrestricted him can
appear in the same positions as standard DPs
(i.e. R-expressions), the distributions of discourse
bound him and syntactically bound him are in-
comparable (more on that in Sec. 4). At the same
time, unrestricted him is mostly restricted to deic-
tic uses, which are comparatively rare. Since him
is actually bound in most instances and the type

of binding gives rise to different distributions, an
efficient mechanism for syntactic binding is es-
sential under more realistic conditions where not
every pronoun can be assumed to introduce a new
referent.

In sum, the basic duty of binding theory from
the perspective of formal grammars is to regu-
late the distribution of various pronominal forms
(where, depending on the ultimate goals, one
might want to distinguish between homophonous
pronouns that belong to distinct classes). More
ambitious goals, such as computing specific
meanings or incorporating conditions imposed by
discourse, are beyond the reach of rational con-
straints and best left to additional machinery. This
does not mean that the task at hand is trivial,
though. Since rational constraints cannot keep
track of indexations, it is unclear how the require-
ments of obviative pronouns are to be handled.
The next section offers a simple solution to this
issue.

3 Computing Obviation

As just discussed, the only challenge to a rational
binding theory is posed by pronominals that both
need a syntactic antecedent and show obviation
effects. Other pronominals either do not involve
syntactic binding or are easily reigned in by ex-
tending the size of the binding domain in Rogers’s
(1998) definition of Principle A. For the problem-
atic subclass of pronominals — be it Swedish sig,
Marathi aapan. , or syntactically bound pronouns
in English — there are two constraints to be taken
care of: I) every pronoun has an antecedent, and
II) no two pronouns that must be disjoint in refer-
ence have the same antecedent.

Suppose that we have some well-defined notion
of obviation domain such that every pronominal
belongs to at least one obviation domain and only
pronominals belonging to the same one can (but
need not) be required to be disjoint in reference.
In addition, there is some procedure A such that
for each pronominal p in tree t,A(p, t) is the set of
viable antecedents of p in t. In the case of canon-
ical binding theory, the two would be supplied by
the definition of binding domains on the one hand
and c-command on the other. Then I) and II) can
be verified as follows.

Given a tree t and sequence P :=
〈p1, . . . , pi−1 � pi, . . . , pn〉 of pronominals
in t, n ≥ 0, the debt of P is

Table 1: Cross-linguistic classification of pronominals according to Kiparsky (2002; 2012)

• 0 if i− 1 = n,

• 0+debt(〈p1, . . . , pi � pi+1, . . . , pn〉) if there
is some pj , j < i, such that pj and pi need
not be disjoint in reference in t,

• 1 + debt(〈p1, . . . , pi � pi+1, . . . , pn〉) other-
wise.

Assume t contains obviation domains
O1, . . . , On, n ≥ 1, and let pro(Oi) be the
set of pronominals contained by Oi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Furthermore, let φ be some arbitrary pro-
cedure for totally ordering any given set
P ⊆ pro(Oi), debt(P ) := debt(〈�〉 · φ(P )),
and A(P, t) := |⋃p∈P A(p, t)|. Then con-
ditions I) and II) above are satisfied in t iff
for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n and P ⊆ pro(Oi),
A(P, t) ≥ debt(P ).

Proof. Suppose A(P, t) ≥ debt(P ) for every
P ⊆ pro(Oi). Then in particular A({p} , t) ≥
debt({p}) for every p ∈ pro(Oi), implying I). As
for II), let Ω be the smallest set containing all ob-
viative p ∈ pro(Oi). By assumption A(P, t) ≥
debt(P ) for all P ⊆ Ω, too, which entails that
for any arbitrary choice of p1, . . . pn ∈ Ω, n ≥ 2,
there are at least n available antecedents. It fol-
lows immediately that no two pi, pj ∈ Ω need to
share an antecedent.

In the other direction, we prove the contrapos-
itive: violation of I) or II) implies that A(P, t) <
debt(P ) for some P ⊆ pro(Oi). If I) does not
hold, then there is some p such that A({p} , t) =
0 < 1 = debt({p}). Now let Ω be defined as
before. It is easy to see that if II) is necessar-
ily violated, then for some P ⊆ Ω, A(P, t) <
debt(P ).

Intuitively, our condition states that for ev-
ery collection of mutually obviative pronominals,
there are enough antecedents such that no two
pronominals need to share a referent. It is crucial
that we consider every subset of a given obviation
domain, for otherwise a pronominal with many
available antecedents could pay off debt induced

by other pronominals. For example, if A(p1, t) =
2 and A(p2, t) = 0, then A({p1, p2} , t) = 2 =
debt({p1, p2}) yet p2 has no viable antecedents
at all and thus cannot be bound.

Let us quickly work through an example. Con-
sider the clause that he wants him to entertain
him. According to standard linguistic assump-
tions, it consists of two overlapping obviation
domains, O1 := that he wants him and O2 :=
him to entertain him. Each obviation domain has
a debt of 2, and each pronoun needs at least one
possible antecedent. Any masculine singular DP
that c-commands the entire clause is a viable an-
tecedent for the pronouns. Hence we correctly
predict (1b) but not (1a) to be grammatical if all
pronouns are meant to be syntactically bound.

(1) a. * John said that he wants him to en-
tertain him.

b. John told Bill that he wants him to
entertain him.

Note that almost all morphological require-
ments on the antecedent (gender, animacy, etc.)
can be encoded as part of the procedure A if one
considers them relevant to syntax. The major ex-
ception is number, which also needs to be taken
into account in the definition of the debt func-
tion. At first sight this seems rather trivial: in-
stead of a single debt value, the function now re-
turns a pair encoding the minimum required num-
ber of singular and plural antecedents. However,
a plural pronominal can be bound by two singu-
lar DPs, so every time one is encountered there
is a choice of either increasing the singular an-
tecedent threshold by 2 or the plural antecedent
threshold by 1. Rather than a pair of values, then,
we actually need to keep track of a set of such
constantly updated pairs, and the cardinality of
said set doubles with every new plural pronom-
inal. Singular and plural antecedents must be
counted separately, too, and for every obviation
domain O and P ⊆ O there must be some pair
d := 〈sg , pl〉 ∈ debt(P ) such that sg and pl do
not exceed the number of singular and plural an-

192



tecedents, respectively.
Things might be even more involved, because

at least some sentences seem to marginally allow
for a singular pronoun to partially overlap in ref-
erence with a plural pronominal, even in cases
where the former should be obviative.

(2) Johni and Peterj agreed that theyi+j like
himi.

Unfortunately the binding properties of plural
pronominals (let alone dual) still aren’t particu-
larly well understood, so we have to leave it to
future research for now.

Even when the complications introduced by
plural are taken into account, though, the proce-
dure proposed here can be computed by rational
constraints iff the following holds.

Rational Base Obviation domains, mandatory
disjointness in reference, and possible an-
tecedents can be determined by rational con-
straints.

Limited Obviation There is some finite upper
bound k on the range of debt .

The relevance of Rational Base is obvious in both
directions. The necessity of Limited Obviation
follows immediately from the fact that rational
constraints are computable by bottom-up tree au-
tomata, which by virtue of being finite-state can
only count up to some fixed threshold k. In the
right-to-left direction, it suffices to observe that
both the debt function and the cardinality com-
parison A(P, t) ≥ debt(P ) can easily be stated
in monadic second-order logic — definability in
which is equivalent to being rational — if Lim-
ited Obviation holds together with Rational Base.

To our knowledge, Rational Base is satisfied
for all theories of binding commonly entertained
in the literature (cf. Rogers’s implementation).
Whether Limited Obviation is tenable is an em-
pirical question. Is there an upper bound on the
number of required antecedents per obviation do-
main?

4 Empirical Evaluation

In this section we investigate a range of data
drawn primarily from English in an attempt to
elicit a counterexample to Limited Obviation.
Since Limited Obviation can be falsified only
by instances of syntactic binding, we assume

that pronouns are indeed syntactically bound un-
less there is evidence to the contrary. We also
make heavy use of quantified DPs, which aren’t
as amenable to discourse binding as their non-
quantified counterparts. In particular, DPs quan-
tified by no are viable antecedents for syntactic
binding, but not for discourse binding, as it evi-
denced by the paradigm in (3).

(3) a. Every player was given a card. He
was delighted.

b. * No player was given a card. He
was upset.

c. Every/No player was upset that he
wasn’t given a card.

Discourse binding is the only option in (3a) and
(3b) (besides introducing an entirely new refer-
ent), whereas (3c) also allows for syntactic bind-
ing. A no-quantified DP is a licit antecedent in the
latter example, but not the former.

Besides the restriction to syntactic binding, it
is also clear from our definitions that Limited
Obviation is trivially satisfied for every obvia-
tion domain that may only contain a bounded
number of pronouns. So if there exists a coun-
terexample to Limited Obviation in natural lan-
guage, it must involve an obviation domain with-
out such a bound. The literature on binding con-
tains not a single mention of a language where
obviation domains are larger than a single CP
(keep in mind that we only consider pronomi-
nals here; there are of course instances of ob-
viation domains extending beyond several CPs,
but those involve R-expressions such as proper
names). There are three ways of accommodating
an unbounded number of pronouns inside a single
CP: adjunction, TP/VP/DP-recursion, and coordi-
nation. Let’s consider one after another.

4.1 Adjuncts
In English, pronouns inside adjuncts usually do
not show obviation effects. Native speakers of En-
glish agree that the sentence below has a reading
in which the pronoun is bound by the quantified
DP.

(4) Every/No/Some woman put the box down
in front of her.

Even speakers that prefer a reflexive instead of the
pronoun still consider this sentence grammatical
under the intended reading.

193



In cases where obviation occurs, pronouns con-
tained by distinct adjuncts do not obviate each
other, so debt is increased by at most one point,
irrespective of the number of adjuncts.

(5) a. * Every/No/Some priest sacrificed a
goat for him/in honor of him.

b. Every/No/Some Egyptian goddess
asked of some priest that he sacri-
fice a goat for her in honor of her.

In (5a), the pronoun must introduce a new refer-
ent or be at least discourse-bound. Otherwise it
would be locally bound by the priest-DP, and this
reading is not available. In the perfectly accept-
able (5b), on the other hand, the same adjuncts
are clause mates and each one contains a pronoun
that is bound by the quantified subject of the next
higher clause. Note that in the minimally dif-
ferent (6) below, the pronouns inside the adjunct
must still be disjoint in reference from the embed-
ded subject. Consequently, they can be bound by
priest iff he is bound by god (this reading, albeit
odd, is indeed available).

(6) Every/No/Some Egyptian god asked of
some priest that he sacrifice a goat for him
in honor of him.

Taken together the data corroborates our initial
claim: pronouns inside adjuncts usually aren’t ob-
viative, but when they are the obviation effect
does not extend to adjuncts contained in the same
clause. This guarantees that debt is increased by
only one point no matter how many adjuncts are
present.

A similar pattern emerges in German, where
some speakers treat pronouns inside PP-adjuncts
as obviative yet pronouns contained by distinct
PPs do not obviate each other.

‘Every/no/some student asked his
sister to hide a cheat sheet next to
him for him.’

4.2 TP-Recursion

Nested TPs do not endanger the empirical ade-
quacy of Limited Obviation. This is witnessed by
the paradigm in (8).

(8) a. * Every/No/Some patient said [CP
that [TP he wants [TP him to be se-
dated ]]].

b. * Every/No/Some patient said that
he wants him to sedate him.

c. Every/No/Some patient told some
doctor that he wants him to sedate
him.

d. Every/No/Some patient told some
doctor that he incorrectly believes
him to want him to sedate him.

The ungrammaticality (8a) shows that the ECM
subject must be disjoint from the subject of the
embedded clause, so obviation domains span at
least an entire TP and may partially overlap. At
the same time it is clear that the embedded sub-
ject pronoun can be bound by the matrix subject,
indicating that obviation domains do not extend
beyond CPs. Comparing (8b) to (8c), we see that
the overlap in nested TPs is limited to Spec,TP,
since two antecedents are enough for three pro-
nouns, which implies that the embedded subject
and the object of the ECM clause can have the
same referent. This conclusion is further corrobo-
rated by (8d), in which two antecedents are suffi-
cient to satisfy the binding requirements of four
pronouns. It follows, then, that the debt of n
nested TPs, n ≥ 1, is determined by the maxi-
mum of the debts of the individual TPs. As long
as the debt of individual TPs is finitely bounded,
so is the debt of nested TPs.

4.3 VP-Recursion

It is commonly assumed that English does not al-
low for VPs to be nested without an intervening
TP. To the degree that one is willing to entertain

194



VP-recursion as a possible analysis for some con-
structions in English, it seems to behave exactly
like TP-recursion.

(9) a. * Every/No/Some patient said that
he made him operate on him.

b. Every/No/Some doctor told some
patient that he made him watch
him operate on him.

4.4 DP-Recursion
The absence of obviation effects with pronouns
inside DPs in English is a well-established fact.

(10) Every/No/Some politician liked the (pho-
tographer’s) picture of him.

(11) Every/No/Some politician enjoyed the
(consultant’s) presentation to him.

It is a contentious issue whether the observed be-
havior is due to DPs establishing new obviation
domains or pronouns losing their obviative prop-
erties in these configurations. For our purposes,
though, the underlying cause of this pattern is ir-
relevant as long as it carries over to nested DPs,
which is indeed the case.

(12) Every/No/Some post-modern artist must
paint at least one [picture of [him and a
picture of him]].

(13) Every/No/Some facetious client wanted
to see a [presentation of [a presentation to
him] to him].

The first sentence has a grammatical reading in
which every post-modern artist amust paint a pic-
ture that depicts both a and some other picture
of a. In order for this reading to be licensed the
two pronouns inside the DP need to be coreferent,
wherefore they do not obviate each other. One
could wonder whether this might be due to the
presence of a conjunction, but this objection does
not apply to (13), which has an analogous read-
ing. Some speakers dislike both sentences, but
their judgment is independent of a specific inter-
pretation and thus has no bearing on determining
obviation requirements. We conclude that nested
DPs do not give rise to unbounded debt.

4.5 Coordination
Coordination exhibits a very peculiar pattern that
to our knowledge has gone unnoticed in the em-
pirical literature so far: coordination of syntacti-

cally bound pronouns is grammatical iff the coor-
dinated pronouns are distinct.

(14) a. Every/No/Some football player
told every/no/some cheerleader
that the coach wants to see him
and her in the office.

b. * Every/No/some football player
told every/no/some masseur that
the coach wants to see him and
him in the office.

It is unclear what exactly the relevant notion
of distinctness is. Several languages have dis-
tinct pronouns with identical morphological fea-
ture specifications that differ with respect to de-
grees of discourse salience, e.g. Latin is, iste, ille,
and dieser and jener in German. Marcel den
Dikken (p.c.) points out that a similar contrast ex-
ists in Dutch and that the Dutch analogue of (14b)
seems well-formed if one coordinated pronoun is
replaced by one of these alternate pronouns.

We are unsure whether the same holds true of
German, but fascinating as this question might be,
it is ultimately orthogonal to the issue at hand, viz.
whether coordination can lead to unbounded debt.
Latin, German, and Dutch still have only a fi-
nite inventory of distinct pronoun types, so unless
arbitrarily many identical tokens of one of these
types can be coordinated, we are still guaranteed
a finite bound on debt even if the pronouns would
all obviate each other.

4.6 American Sign Language
Curiously, the analogue of (14b) is well-formed in
ASL, so identical pronouns may indeed be coor-
dinated.

(15) [all wrestler]i inform [someone
swimmer]j that proi and proj will
ride-in-vehicle limo go-to dance
‘Every wrestler told some swimmer that
the two of them would ride in a limo to
the dance.’

It is important to keep in mind, however, that
ASL’s binding mechanism differs in essential re-
spects from that of English. Foremost, it has
distinctively deictic flavor to it. Referential ex-
pressions are assigned distinct loci in front of the
speaker, and a pronoun is realized by pointing at
a previously established locus. So in (15), the
signer would first map every wrestler and some

195



swimmer to specific loci, which we indicate by the
subscripts i and j, respectively. In order to refer
back to them in the coordination, the signer sim-
ply points at the intended loci. That is to say, proi
and proj in the sentence above represent only the
act of retrieving referents from their loci via point-
ing, no discrete morphological forms beyond that
are involved. Pronouns are pointers.

Considering the deictic nature of all pronouns
in ASL, one might suspect that (15) involves dis-
course binding rather than syntactic binding. Af-
ter all, (14b) is perfectly grammatical in English
if the pronouns are used deictically by simultane-
ously pointing at two specific individuals. More-
over, binding in ASL lacks several properties of
syntactic binding. Foremost, the denotational do-
main of a pronoun must be non-empty, meaning
that a DP quantified by no is not a suitable an-
tecedent.

(16) a. [each politics person]i tell-story
proi want win

b. * [no politics person]i tell-story proi
want win

‘Every/No politiciani said hei wants
to win.’

As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, dis-
course binding across sentences in English is sub-
ject to a similar restriction, making it rather un-
likely that these instances of binding in ASL are
truly syntactic. Further evidence along these lines
is presented by Schlenker (2011; 2012). Recent
work of Rudnev and Kimmelman (2011) on Rus-
sian Sign Language also suggests that it is the
norm for binding conditions in signed languages
to differ from those of spoken languages, rather
than the exception.

When these observations are added to our own,
it seems that neither English nor ASL furnish
a decisive counterexample to Limited Obviation.
Consequently, a rational theory of binding seems
empirically feasible.

5 Conclusion

We have shown that if one is content with a theory
that can only verify the existence of some gram-
matical reading for a given phrase structure tree
— rather than evaluating specific readings — the
major challenge to a rational theory of binding
is posed by pronouns that need a syntactic an-
tecedent yet must not be coreferent with any other

material within the bounds of some locality do-
main. This problem can be tackled by a system
that builds on obviation domains, antecedents,
and the notion of debt, which represents the num-
ber of antecedents that must be present in order
to satisfy all binding requirements. As long as
the debt of obviation domains is finitely bounded,
the proposed system is finite-state computable.
No convincing counterexample to this assumption
could be found in English or ASL. While it is dif-
ficult to estimate from the existing binding liter-
ature whether this result will carry over to other
languages due to the scarcity of pertinent data, we
are confident that potential counterexamples will
also turn out not to be truly syntactic in nature.
