Abstract

This paper proposes a new dependency-based
analysis of coordination that generalizes over
existing  analyses  by  combining  symmetrical
and  asymmetrical  analyses  of  coordination
into a DAG structure. The new joint structure
is  shown to be theoretically  grounded in the
notion of  connections  between words just  as
the formal definition of other types of depen-
dencies.  Beside  formalizations  of  shared  de-
pendents  (including  right-node  raising),
paradigmatic  adverbs,  and embedded coordi-
nations,  a  completely  new  formalization  of
non-constituent coordination is proposed.

1 Introduction

Coordination  is  a  special  case  of  paradigmatic
phenomena  which  extend  to  reformulation  and
disfluency.  A  paradigmatic  phenomenon occurs
when a segment Y of an utterance fills the same
syntactic position as X.1 For example in (1)  to
(3), apply to offers a position that has been con-
jointly  taken  by several  nouns,  called  the  con-
juncts.

(1) A similar technique is almost impossible to
apply to cotton, soybeans and rice.

(2) A similar technique is almost impossible to
apply to cotton, uh high quality cotton.

(3) A similar technique is almost impossible to
apply to cotton, (or) maybe linen.

Sentence (1) is an example of a coordination, (2)
of a reformulation, (3) is an intermediate case on
the  continuum  between  the  two  as  shown  in
Blanche-Benveniste  et  al.  (1984).  We  consider
1 The term  paradigmatic is commonly used to de-

note a set of elements that are of the same para-
digm because  they can  replace  one  another.  We
prefer this term to paratactic used by Popel et al.
(2013) following Tesnière 1959 chap. 133 who op-
poses  hypotaxis (=  subordination in  modern
terms) and parataxis (= coordination) because to-
day paratactic commonly refers to cases of coor-
dination without conjunction (= juxtaposition).

that a formalization of coordination must be ex-
tensible to other paradigmatic phenomena in par-
ticular to cases where two elements occupy the
same syntactic position without being connected
by  subordinating  conjunctions  (Gerdes  &  Ka-
hane 2009). The conjuncts of such paradigmatic
structures form the layers of a paradigmatic pile
whose dependency structure will  be laid out in
this article. 

This article proposes and justifies a new, com-
parably complex, dependency analysis of coordi-
nation  and  other  paradigmatic  phenomena  that
goes beyond the commonly assumed tree struc-
ture of dependency. We are concerned with the
formal  and  linguistic  well-foundedness  of  the
syntactic analysis and each node and each link of
the syntactic  structure should be motivated ex-
clusively and falsifiably by syntactic criteria. The
goal is not to provide a minimal and computa-
tionally  simple  structure  that  simply  expresses
the necessary semantic distinctions.  We believe
that  theoretical  coherence of the analysis  is  al-
ways an advantage, including for machine learn-
ing.

In section 2, we recap the difficulties of repre-
senting  coordination  in  dependency  and  other
frameworks.  Section 3 exposes the notions and
criteria at the basis of our new analysis. Section 4
is dedicated to simple coordinations, Section 5 to
shared dependents (including right-node raising),
Section  6  to  non-constituent  coordination.  We
then turn to paradigmatic  adverbs  in Section 7
and  embedded  coordination  in  8.  Before  con-
cluding we show cases of coordinations that are
not paradigmatic phenomena in Section 9.

2 Coordination and dependency

It is a well known fact that function, rather than
constituent  type  are  relevant  for  coordinative
constraints.2 We will provide further evidence for

the  adequateness  of  dependency  rather  than
phrase structure for the description of coordina-
tion.

Nevertheless,  dependency  grammars  (just  as
other syntactic theories, including categorial and
phrase structure) are “head-driven” in the sense
that syntax is mainly considered as the analysis
of government.3 However, paradigmatic phenom-
ena are by definition orthogonal to government
structures and their integration into dependency
structures  is  up  for  debate  because  commonly,
dependencies express head-daughter relations.

Existing dependency annotation schemes dif-
fer widely on the analysis of paradigmatic phe-
nomena,  thus  reflecting  important  underlying
syntactic  choices,  which  often  remain  implicit.
Ivanova et al. (2012), while comparing different
dependency schemes, note that “the analysis of
coordination represents a well-known area of dif-
ferences” and even on a simple example like cot-
ton,  soybeans  and  rice,  “none  of  the  formats
agree.”

The high frequency of paradigmatic phenom-
ena also implies that the choice of their syntactic
analysis has important ramifications on the struc-
ture as a whole: Dependency distance and gov-
ernment-dependent  relations  both  vary  signifi-
cantly  with  the  type  of  representation given to
paradigmatic phenomena, see Popel et al. (2013)
for measures on the impact of the choices for co-
ordination.

Syntactic analyses of coordination can gener-
ally be divided into two families of symmetrical
and asymmetrical analyses (and mixed forms can
be placed on a scale between these two families).
Symmetrical analyses aim to give equal status to
each  conjunct.  Asymmetrical  analyses on  the
contrary give a special status to one, commonly

common  constituent  type  of  an  architect and
proud of it.

3 We call  government the property of words to im-
pose  constraints  on  other  words,  which  can  be
constraints  on  their  nature  (e.g.  their  part  of
speech), their morphological and syntactic mark-
ers, or their topological (linear) position. For ex-
ample, in English, a verb imposes on its direct ob-
ject to be a noun phrase (or, if verbal, to be trans-
ferred into the infinitive form, Tesnière 1959), to
carry the oblique case in case of pronouns, and to
take  a  position  behind  the  verb.  A word,  called
governor, offers a syntactic position for each se-
ries of constraints it can impose on other words.

the first,  of the conjuncts,  and iteratively place
the other conjuncts below the special one.

A symmetrical analysis (Tesnière 1959, Jack-
endoff 1977, Hajič et al. 1999:222) constitutes a
higher abstraction from the surface because the
tree structure is independent of linear order of the
conjuncts. However, placing the conjuncts on an
equal  level  poses the problem of choice of  the
governor among the different participants in the
coordination.4

Some  work  on  coordination  in  dependency
grammar,  while  showing  the  usefulness  of  de-
pendency  trees  for  the  expression  of  the  con-
straints,  never  actually  propose  a  dependency
structure  for  the  coordination  itself  (Hudson
1988,  Osborne  2006,  2008).  Some  even  argue
against any kind of dependency analysis of coor-
dination on the basis  that  it  is  a different  phe-
nomenon altogether: “The only alternative to de-
pendency analysis which is worth considering is
one in  terms of  constituent  structure,  in  which
the conjuncts and the conjunction are PARTS of
the whole coordinate structure.” (Hudson 1988)

An  asymmetrical  analysis,  in  its  Mel’čukian
variant  (Mel’čuk  1988,  used  in  CoNLL 2008,
Surdeanu et al. 2008) and in its Stanfordian vari-
ant (de Marneffe & Manning 2008), on the con-
trary, represents better the surface configuration:
The  coordinating  conjunction  usually  forms  a
syntactic unit (cf. Section 3) with the following
phrase (and rice in the above example) and only
an asymmetrical  analysis  contains this  segment
as a subtree.

X-bar  type  phrase  structures  just  as  depen-
dency annotations that only allow trees, therefore
excluding multiple governors for the same node,
have  to  make  a  choice  between a  symmetrical
and an asymmetrical analysis. Some annotation
schemes,  however,  do  not  want  to  make  this
choice.  The notion of  “weak head”,  introduced

4 Under the condition that the resulting structure has
to be a dependency tree, the coordinative conjunc-
tion is the only possible choice of governor. Some
treebanks (Hajič et al. 1999) then go as far as us-
ing punctuation like commas as tokens that head a
conjunction-less  paradigmatic  structure.  We con-
sider that punctuation plays a role in transcribing
prosodic breaks, but certainly does not correspond
to a syntactic unit and is therefore not part of the
syntactic structure.
If the tree structure condition is relaxed the result
can combine the  conjuncts  as  co-heads (Tesnière
1959, Kahane 1997).

by Tseng 2002 and put forward by Abeillé 2003,
to  designate  coordinating  conjunctions,  for  ex-
ample  and, implies selective feature sharing be-
tween the other conjuncts and e.g. and as well as
rice.  Recent  work  by Chomsky (2013)  equally
assumes “that although C [the conjunction] is not
a  possible  label  [of  the  resulting  coordinated
structure], it must still be visible for determining
the structure.” A result, of course, is a more gen-
eral  “weakening” of  the  notion of  “head” as  a
whole,  while  dodging  the  underlying  central
question about the limits of head-driven syntax.

3 Criteria for syntactic structures 

In order to justify our choices of representation,
it  is  necessary to recall  the basic  objectives  of
any syntactic structure. 

Firstly,  syntactic  structures  indicate how dif-
ferent  words of the sentence combine. Govern-
ment  is  one mode of  combination,  but  not  the
only  one  –  dependencies  do  not  always  corre-
spond to government. In the case of a pile, an el-
ement Y takes the same position as an element X
that precedes. Even if the two conjuncts X and Y
are in a paradigmatic relation (they can commute
and  each  conjunct  alone  can  occupy  the  posi-
tion),  they  are  in  a  syntagmatric  relation:  they
combine into a new unit, which must be encoded
by a dependency.

Secondly, the syntactic representation is inter-
mediate between meaning and sound. The syn-
tactic representation thus has to allow us to com-
pute on one hand, the semantic representation in-
cluding the predicate-argument relations between
lexical  meanings,  and  on  the  other  hand,  the
topological constituents observed on the surface
(Gerdes & Kahane 2001).

Thirdly, the representation constrains the pos-
sible combinations of the words: A certain num-
ber of combinations are eliminated by the impos-
sibility to associate them with a phonological or
semantic representation , but equally the impos-
sibility to associate a syntactic structure to an ut-
terance constitutes  a strong filter on the allowed
combinations (from a generative point of view,
this is even the primary filter). Consequently, a
good  syntactic  representation  has  to  be  suffi-
ciently constrained so that most badly formed ut-
terances cannot obtain a syntactic representation
(while,  of  course,  all  well-formed  utterances
have to obtain a syntactic representation). Recall
that  we  propose  a  performance  grammar  and

from our point of view, disfluent utterances (such
as (2)) are considered well-formed. Our syntactic
representation is also designed for the extraction
of a grammar that holds constraints on each type
of dependencies:  Constraints  on the orientation
of  the  dependency  (head-initial  or  head-final),
constraints on the POS of the governor and of the
dependent  including  sub-categorization  con-
straints  attached  to  the  governor  of  the  depen-
dency relation (e.g. the constraint that a depen-
dent object can only depend on a transitive verb).
This  set  of  constraints  has to  allow telling un-
grammatical from well-formed utterances.

We  will  adopt  the  following  principles.  We
consider  that  any  part  of  a  sentence  that  can
stand alone with the same meaning is a syntactic
unit.  As  soon  as  a  syntactic  unit  can  be  frag-
mented into two units X and Y, we consider that
there is a syntactic connection between X and Y
(Gerdes  &  Kahane  2011).  Syntactic  dependen-
cies are oriented connections linking a head with
its dependent. The notation X → Y means that Y
depends on X. Note that we distinguish the terms
head and governor: if Y depends on X, then X is
the governor of Y and X is the head of the unit
XY. So the head of a unit U belongs to U, while
the governor of U is an element outside U and
connected with U.

4 Syntactic structure of coordination

In a coordination like  onions and rice, the seg-
ment  and rice forms a syntactic unit, because it
can stand alone:

(4) I want onions. And rice.
(5) Spk1: I want onions. Spk2: And rice?

This data implies that  and and  rice are con-
nected  by  a  dependency.  We  can  contrast  this
with  onions  and,  which  cannot  stand alone.  In
other words, coordination is syntactically asym-
metrical.

The choice of the head of the phrase and rice
is  not  trivial.  For  instance Mazziota (2011) ar-
gues that in Old French the junctor5 is optional,

5 Junctor is a more general term than “coordinating
conjunction”,  introduced  by  Blanche-Benveniste
et al. (1990) and Ndiaye (1989), as a variant of the
term “jonctif”  used by Tesnière  (1959).  Cf.  also
the term “pile marker” used by Gerdes & Kahane
(2009). We prefer to avoid the term coordinating
conjunction because  junctors  can  also  appear  in
paradigmatic piles other than coordination, like Fr.
c’est-à-dire ‘that is’.

which is a good argument in favor of and as a de-
pendent  of  the  conjunct.  Equally,  the  Stanford
Dependency scheme (SD, de Marneffe & Man-
ning 2008) and subsequently the Universal De-
pendency Treebank (McDonald et al. 2013) de-
scribe junctors as adjuncts. Nevertheless, gener-
ally,  a  phrase  like  and  rice does  not  have  the
same distribution as  rice,  which is sufficient to
consider that and controls the distribution of the
phrase and is a head. But the distribution of the
phrase  depends  also  on  the  conjunct:  and  rice
can combine with a noun (onions and rice) but it
cannot  combine  with  a  verb  (*Peter  eats  and
rice).  This means that both elements bear head
features (see the notion of  weak head in section
2).  In  a  dependency-based  analysis  this  means
that both elements should be linked to the gover-
nor of the phrase, which is not possible in a stan-
dard dependency analysis using a tree structure.

We will slightly relax the tree constraints and
consider two kinds of dependencies: pure (or pri-
mary)  dependencies and  secondary  dependen-
cies. We adopt the following principles:

• Principle 1: There is exactly one pure depen-
dency between two units that combine.

• Principle 2:  As soon as  X combines  with Y
and a subset A of Y controls the combination
of X and Y, there is a dependency between X
and A.

In consequence, if Y = AB and both A and B con-
trol the combination of X and Y, there will be ei-
ther a pure dependency between X and A and a
secondary dependency between X and B or the
reverse. As A and B are also connected, the struc-
ture is no longer necessarily a tree but a DAG.

We apply our principles with X = onions, A =
and, and B = rice. As the junctor and can be ab-
sent (onions, rice, beans …; onions, maybe rice),
we consider that B is the main head of AB and
postulate  a  pure  dependency  between  the  two
conjuncts, that we call a paradigmatic link. This
link  is  doubled  by  a  secondary  link  between
onions and  and, which is the secondary head of
and rice. The secondary status of this link is also
justified by the fact that onions and is not a syn-
tactic unit. We call such a link a bequeather.

As and and rice are co-heads of  and rice, we
do not have clear arguments to decide which one
governs the other. As soon as we suppress one of
the two dependencies  between  onions  and  and
rice and favor one of the two co-heads, the link

is automatically oriented and we either obtain the
Mel’čukian analysis (onions → and → rice) or
Mazziotta's analysis (onions → rice → and). As
rice is  the  semantic  argument  of  and  and  an
obligatory complement of and, we decide to treat
rice as the dependent of and.

Let us now consider the combination between
the pile and its governor:

(6) I want onions and rice.

We remark that both conjuncts can form a unit
with  want,  the  governor  of  the  pile  (I  want
onions;  I want rice). This allows us to postulate
that both conjuncts have head features which li-
censes a connection with the governor. We con-
sider that  the first  conjunct  opens the potential
connection  with  the  governor  and  is  the  main
head. Consequently,  onions receives a pure (ob-
ject) dependency from want, while  rice receives
a secondary dependency, which we call an inher-
ited dependency (Fig. 1).

Secondary dependencies,  represented by dot-
ted arrows, double pure dependencies, but while
a bequeather link anticipates a pure dependency,
an inherited link is inherited from a pure depen-
dency (Fig. 2).

5 Shared dependent (including Right Node
Raising)

A pile can have syntactic dependents shared by
several  conjuncts.  In (7),  Peter and houses are
shared by the conjuncts buys and sells (Fig. 3).

(7) Peter buys and sells houses.

In dependency grammar, the subject and the ob-
ject  are  encoded  in  a  completely  symmetrical
way.  For  Generative  Grammarians,  the  stipula-

tion of a VP makes the case of  houses particu-
larly  complicated,  a  configuration  which  is
known as “Right Node Raising” (Postal 1974).6

Sharing cannot be easily modeled by a depen-
dency tree.7 Mel’cuk (2015:vol. 3, 493) considers
different  solutions  for  distinguishing  individual
from  shared  dependents  and  settles  finally  for
“groupings”  where  the  nodes  involved  in  the
conjunction are grouped together excluding the
shared  dependent:  old←[men→and→women].
Tesnière (1959: ch. 143-145) analyzes sharing by
multiple  heads,  as  we  propose:  A  dependent
shared by several conjuncts is governed by each
of them. We modify this analysis by considering
that only one of these dependencies is a pure de-
pendency. We consider that the shared dependent
is  above  all  the  dependent  of  the  nearest  con-
junct, because they can form a prosodic unit to-
gether. The dependency between a conjunct and
a shared dependent is inherited by the other con-
juncts and we annotate that by an inherited de-
pendency, which allows us to disambiguate cases
like (8). In both cases, old is a dependent of men,

6 In  English,  there  is  nevertheless  an  asymmetry
since the  left  sharing  (Peter buys  buildings  and
sells apartments) is better than simultaneous right
and left sharing (as in (7)) which again is easier
than  only  right  sharing  (?Peter  sells  and  Mary
buys houses) These preferences can be taken into
account  without  postulating  a  VP,  by penalizing
right sharing without left sharing.

7 Sharing can be represented in a symmetrical anal-
ysis (Hajič et al. 1999) by placing the shared de-
pendent as a dependent of the junctor, which itself
is the head of the conjuncts. Not only do we reject
the symmetric analysis and the junctor as the head
(in particular because a paradigmatic pile does not
need a junctor), but also a link between the junctor
and the shared dependent violates our principles,
since these two elements do not combine to form a
syntactic unit.

but the relation is optionally inherited by women
(Fig. 4).

(8) old men and women

This encoding, following the asymmetrical anal-
ysis  of  coordination,  allows us  to  compute  the
desired syntactic and prosodic units. Each word
that is governed both by a pure dependency and
an inherited dependency is a shared dependent.
Each  conjunct  is  the  projection  of  the  word
linked by the paradigmatic links with the exclu-
sion of shared dependents and the pile is the pro-
jection of  the first  conjunct  without  the  shared
dependents. We thus obtain the units:

a. ((old men) and (women))
b. old ((men) and (women))

No satisfying phrase structure representation ex-
ists  for  piles  where  the  shared  dependent  does
not modify the head of each conjunct, as for ex-
ample in (9):

(9) Congratulations to Miss Fisher and to Miss
Howell who are both marrying their fiancés
this summer. (www.st-peters.kent.sch.uk)

Here,  the  PPs  to  Miss  Fisher and  to  Miss
Howell are  coordinated but only the NPs  Miss
Fisher and Miss Howell are modified by the rela-
tive phrase. The analysis of this example is un-
problematic in our annotation scheme.

Following  our  principles,  we  have  only  one
pure dependency between to Miss Fisher and to
Miss  Howell,  which  is  a  paradigmatic  link  be-
tween the heads of the two PPs, that is, the two
to.  We  introduce  a  lateral  paradigmatic  link,
which  is  a  secondary  dependency,  between
Fisher and Howell, because they share a depen-
dent (the relative clause).8 This link is justified
for two reasons: First, we think that the piling of
8 Lateral dependencies are a third case of secondary

dependencies.  While  an  inherited  dependency
doubles a pure dependency with the same gover-
nor and a bequeather, a pure dependency with the
same dependent,  a  lateral  dependency doubles  a
pure dependency more or  less  parallelly.  It  only
occurs  if  at  least  one  of  the  elements  sharing a
common dependent is a non-trivial nucleus (i.e. it
has more than one node).

two units is supported by parallelism and that the
elements of a pile tend to forge secondary lateral
links. Second, the lateral link allows us to sepa-
rately state the following constraints (Fig. 6):

• Constraint 1: Governors of a shared dependent
must  be  linked  by  a  (eventually  lateral)
paradigmatic link.

• Constraint  2:  Each  lateral  paradigmatic  link
has  a  corresponding plain paradigmatic  link,
and  the  chains  from the  plain  to  the  lateral
paradigmatic link form nuclei.

Nuclei have been introduced in Kahane (1997,
see also Osborne 2008 who calls them predicate
chains). A verbal nucleus is a chain of words that
behaves like a single verb in some constructions,
such as  extraction or  coordination.  A link in  a
verbal nucleus can be a complex verbal form (is
talking),  but  also  V-Vinf  (can  talk),  V-to-Vinf
(want to talk), V-Adj (is easy), V-N, especially in
light  verb  constructions  (have  the  right),  and
even V-that-V (think that  X talks).  A governed
preposition can also form a nucleus with its gov-
ernor in languages allowing preposition strand-
ing  like  English  (talk  to,  but  not  parler  à in
French, see footnote 12). A nominal nucleus is a
chain of nouns and prepositions. A link in a nom-
inal nucleus can be Prep-N (to Miss Fisher) or
N-Prep-N (the end of the movie).

In  example  (10) (Osborne  2006),  admire is
conjunct of the nucleus think → that → distrust
and the lateral paradigmatic link between admire
and  distrusts validates the sharing of the object
this politician.

(10) [Some  people  admire],  but  [I  think  that
many more people distrust] this politician

Constraint 2 excludes cases where the “path”
between the head of a conjunct and a shared de-
pendent is not a nucleus like in ???Peter (plays on

and knows the guy who owns) this piano (knows
→ guy → who → owns is not a nucleus).9

6 Non-constituent coordination

Non-constituent  coordination  (NCC)  can  be  il-
lustrated by:

(11) Peter went to  Paris yesterday and  London
today.

This  construction  is  problematic  for  con-
stituency-based  formalisms,  as  well  as  depen-
dency-based ones, because there is only one co-
ordination with a unique junctor (and) involving
two  phrases  with  two  different  syntactic  func-
tions,  Paris and  yesterday. But while it is ques-
tionable  to  consider  that  Paris  and  yesterday
form a syntactic unit together, it is difficult not to
consider  that  London and  today form one,  be-
cause the latter words can stand alone (with the
junctor):

(12) Peter went to Paris yesterday. And London
today.

We thus consider that there is a pure depen-
dency between London and today we call a NCC
dependency. The two elements linked by a NCC
dependency  pile  on  two independent  elements,
here  Paris and  yesterday,  which  supposes  that
we have two lateral  piles  (Gerdes  and Kahane
2009). But following our principles, we postulate
only one pure dependency between went to Paris
yesterday and  London today,  which means that
we  have  a  standard  paradigmatic  link  between
Paris and London and a lateral paradigmatic link
between yesterday and today. The junctor is ana-
lyzed as a marker of the main paradigmatic link,
which give us the structure of Fig. 7.
9 RNR is rather common in reformulations,  which

are  also paradigmatic  piles.  In (i)  is is  reformu-
lated in may appear, which is a nucleus:
(i)  {  what  I’m saying here  is  |  what  I’m saying
here  may  appear  }  very  pessimistic  (translation
from the Rhapsodie treebank)
We analyze (i) with a main paradigmatic link be-
tween  is and  may and a lateral paradigmatic link
between is and appear.

We also introduce a lateral NCC dependency
between Paris and yesterday. This secondary link
is  justified  1)  by  the  fact  that  Paris  yesterday
tend to receive a prosodic shape similar to  Lon-
don today,  which are linked by a NCC depen-
dency,10 and 2) because it allows us to express
the constraints on the introduction of a NCC de-
pendency in two steps (Fig. 8):

• Constraint 1: A NCC dependency between X'
and Y' is only possible if there is a configura-
tion  with  X –para→X',  Y –lat-para→Y',  and
X –lat-NCC→X'.

• Constraint 2: X and Y can be linked by a lat-
NCC dependency only if they depend on the
same nucleus.11

Constraint  2  is  verified  in  our  example,  be-
cause went to is a verbal nucleus.12 The following
examples from Sailor and Thoms (2013) confirm
that the governor must be a nucleus :

(13) a. I claimed that I was a spy to impress John
and an astronaut to impress Bill
b. * I taught the guy that knows Icelandic
how to dance and Faroese how to sing.

10 The placement of double junctors like either … or
shows that the coordination is indeed between the
“non-constituents” (Sag et al. 1985):
(i) Il donnera soit le disque à Susanne, soit le livre

à Marie ‘He will give either the disk to Susanne
or the book to Mary’

11 Bruening  (2015)  postulates  that  the  governor  of
the two lateral piles (here  went to) is a prosodic
unit.  We  agree  but  go  further,  considering  that
such a segment is actually a syntactic unit, even if
it is not a constituent. Kahane (1997) proposed to
explicitly  introduce this  unit,  the nucleus,  in  the
syntactic structure by way of bubbles.

12 Note that the same construction is not possible in 
French, which does not accept preposition strand-
ing:
(i) a. Pierre était à Paris hier et à Londres aujour-

d’hui.
b. ??Pierre était à Paris hier et Londres aujour-
d’hui.

c. The witness will testify to whether John
knew  Icelandic  tomorrow  and  whether  he
knew Faroese next week.
d. * The witness will testify to whether John
knew  Icelandic  tomorrow  and  he  knew
Faroese next week.

In a,  the governor is the nucleus  claimed →
that → was, and in b, the nucleus will → testify
→ to → whether → knew. Conversely, taught →
guy → that → knows in b is not a nucleus due to
the link guy → that, nor will → testify → to →
whether  in  d,  because  a  complementizer  like
whether can only be part of a nucleus with the
verb it complementizes (as in c).

In  the  same vein,  the  case  of  gapping as  in
(14) can be described as a special case of NCC
with two lateral  piles (Peter →  Mary and  fire-
men → police) and a NCC dependency between
Mary and police.

(14) Peter wants us to call the firemen and Mary
the police.

The constraints are similar and (14) is possible
because  Peter and firemen depends on the same
verbal nucleus wants →  to  →  call.  We see on
this example that some elements of the nucleus
can have dependents that are not involved in the
piling (here  us).13 The same property holds with
the object a book in the next example:
(15) Peter gave a book to John and Mary to Ann.

7 Junctors and paradigmatic adverbs

Next  to  the  conjuncts,  a  pile  can  contain  two
kinds of elements we want to distinguish:

• Junctors are  the  elements  that  connect
the conjuncts of a pile. Junctors have a
role only inside the pile, i.e. if we only
conserve  one  layer  of  a  pile,  junctors
cannot be maintained:

(16) All I can remember is black beans, onions,
and maybe rice. (source: web)

(17) *All I can remember is and rice.

• Paradigmatic  adverbs  (Nølke  1983,
Masini & Pietrandrea 2010), on the con-
trary, can be maintained:

(18) All I can remember is maybe rice.

13 As  opposed  to  that,  conjuncts  involved  in  NCC
cannot share a dependent, see Osborne (2006):
(i) * Susan repairs old [bicycles in winter] and 
[cars in summer]

Traditionally, in a sentence like  (18), the ad-
verb maybe is analyzed, as any common adverb,
as a modifier of the verb (is → maybe), but in
(16) the  layer  and maybe  rice  clearly forms  a
phrase (it can be uttered alone for instance). In
fact  we  think  that  maybe  rice  forms  a  phrase
even in  (18). Paradigmatic adverbs clearly have
scope  over  one  particular  element  of  the  sen-
tence:

(19) a. Peter will maybe give the book to Mary
(unless he will only lend it)
b. Peter will give maybe the book to Mary
(or maybe something else)
c. Peter will give the book maybe to Mary
(or maybe to another person)

In a sentence like c,  maybe to Mary forms a se-
mantic and a prosodic unit, which suggest a link
between the adverb and the following phrase.14
We  stipulate  that  such  adverbs  always  take  a
phrase as argument, even if no overt second con-
junct is present. Thus, the types of syntactic rela-
tions of maybe in (16), (18), and (19) are identi-
cal and very different from quickly in (20).
(20) Peter will quickly give the book to Mary.

We  conclude  that  maybe and  rice are  con-
nected  in  (16) and  (18).  Moreover,  they  both
have head features: If the distribution of  maybe
rice is similar to the distribution of rice, it is nev-
ertheless restricted by maybe (for instance maybe
rice  cannot be the complement of a preposition:
*She spoke about maybe rice). As for the junctor,
we decide that  rice is  the dependent  of  maybe
and  that  the  dependency  from the  governor  of
maybe rice (here  and)  is  attributed to  rice and
doubled by a bequeather link to maybe.

Even  if  junctors  and  paradigmatic  adverbs
have  a  similar  representation,  they  restrict  the
distribution of their argument in a different way,
which  can be easily  encoded by different  con-
straints on a bequeather link governing one or the
other.

14 In  a  V2  language  like  German,  vielleicht  der
Maria ‘maybe to Mary’ can go to the initial posi-
tion, which identifies the combination of vielleicht
and  der Maria as a constituent.

8 Embedded Piles 
It is well known that a tree-based asymmetrical
dependency  analysis  of  coordination  cannot
catch nested coordinations (cf. note 7). Consider
a classical example like :
(21) We  are  looking  for  someone  who  speaks

French and German or Italian.
Two interpretations are possible :

a. { French | and  { German | or Italian } }
b. { { French | and German } | or Italian }

In our analysis, in both cases we have the third
layer  (or  Italian)  attached  to  the  second  layer
(and German) : French → and → German → or
→ Italian.15 But in case a,  Italian  inherits a de-
pendency  from  and because  it  is  coordinated
with the dependent German of and, while in case
b, or Italian is a shared dependent and or inherits
a dependency from French, which is coordinated
with German.

Fig.  11 gives  the  two interpretations  of  (22)
with their corresponding syntactic structures. At
the semantic level, the junctor is the head of a
coordination  and  takes  the  conjuncts  as  argu-
ments (Mel’čuk 2015: vol. 1, 237). In the case of
embedding, one junctor will be the argument of
the other. We can see how the semantic depen-
dency between the two junctors is distributed on
the conjuncts at the syntactic level.

15 Mel’čuk (1988) proposes, in case b, to attach  or
Italian to the head of the group French and Ger-
man, that is to French. We disagree with this anal-
ysis  because  or Italian  is  a shared dependent of
both French and German, and as usual it must be
attached  to  the  last  conjunct  it  modifies,  that  is
German. In any case, in the tree Mel’čuk obtains,
French  has two dependents :  German ← and ←
French → or → Italian. This tree is semantically
ambiguous and correspond also to (French or Ital-
ian) and German, which is not at all equivalent to
the b interpretation of our example.

9 Coordination without pile
Coordination is not always a paradigmatic phe-
nomena piling two elements of the same kind.16 
(22) Mary speaks English and well.
In cases like this, the second conjunct (well) does
not hold the same syntactic position as the first
conjunct  (Marys  speaks  English).  We  consider
that we have here a coordination between illocu-
tionary units. In fact, the speaker makes two as-
sertions in  (22) (Mary speaks English and  She
does it well) in one dependency structure consist-
ing of two illocutionary  units.  We model  these
coordinations without the use of ellipsis, only by
distinguishing dependency structure spans and il-
locutionary units (Kahane et al. 2013). The junc-
tor in (22) is analyzed as usual with a bequeather
and a pure dependency between the junctor and
the conjuncts (speaks → and → well). Yet, we do
not consider this construction to be a pile and we
analyze this sentence without paradigmatic or in-
herited links.

10 Conclusion
We have proposed a dependency grammar for-
malization of several cases of coordination, argu-
ing  for  multiple  governors,  and  thus  a  DAG
structure. Two types of links are considered, pri-
mary and secondary links. The primary links in-
duce a tree structure.17 Three types of secondary
links are considered:  inherited,  bequeather,  and
lateral dependencies, each of them corresponding
to a different arrangement of primary links.
16 In the Rhapsodie treebank (Kahane et al. 2013), a

33,000  word  dependency  treebank  of  spoken
French we have a dozen of such examples such as:
(i)  on  veut  bien  parler  avec  vous  mais  après  le
déménagement  ‘we  are  willing  to  talk  with  you
but after the moving’

17 More precisely primary dependencies governed by
a bequeather link must be inverted to obtain a tree.

Following Gerdes  & Kahane  (2009),  we  argue
for a paradigmatic link,  which is  present in all
paradigmatic  phenomena,  involving  junctors  or
not, ranging from simple coordination, over jux-
tapositions, to phenomena that are more typical
for spoken language like disfluency and reformu-
lation. Conversely, we have shown that junctors
can be involved in non-paradagmatic phenomea
(section 9).
We have proposed a completely new formaliza-
tion of NCC. We consider that, although NCC in-
volves two parallel paradigmatic piles filling two
different  syntactic  positions,  the  second  layer
forms a syntactic unit. Such a unit can only be
formed by the second layer of a coordination and
cannot  appear  outside  of  a  paradigmatic  con-
struction.18
We  have  also  proposed  a  formalization  of
paradigmatic  adverbs,  a  frequent  sight  in
paradigmatic phenomena but rarely considered in
the studies on coordination. 
However, from a theoretical and practical point
of view, it  is  important to note that  we have a
structure that is much more complex than a sim-
ple dependency tree. It remains to be shown that
such a complex annotation scheme can be ma-
chine-learned  and  thus  automatized.  We  think
that  doubling some links  as  we do allows dis-
tributing  and  relocalizing  the  constraints  on
smaller configurations, which could improve the
model.  Orféo, the ongoing follow-up project of
Rhapsodie started in 2013, will have to answer
that question as the new project attempts to real-
ize these annotations on large amounts of spoken
and written data.

We thank the Depling reviewers for their critical

Osborne provided valuable insight on early ver-
sions of this paper.

18 This includes so-called partial utterances:
(i) Spk1: I go to Paris on Monday.

Spk2: And London when?
We consider that the second speech turn is gov-
erned by the first one and we have here a typical
NCC. The only specificity of this NCC is to be
distributed on two illocutionary units. Such a de-
scription implies that we do not have to consider
the second speech turn as an elliptic utterance. It is
simply an utterance that pursues the syntactic con-
struction of the previous utterance.  Such continu-
ations are very common in our corpus of spoken
French.
