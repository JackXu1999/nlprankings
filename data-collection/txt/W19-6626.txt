Abstract

Neural machine translation (NMT) has set
new quality standards in automatic transla-
tion, yet its effect on post-editing produc-
tivity is still pending thorough investiga-
tion. We empirically test how the inclusion
of NMT, in addition to domain-specific
translation memories and termbases, im-
pacts speed and quality in professional
translation of financial texts. We find that
even with language pairs that have re-
ceived little attention in research settings
and small amounts of in-domain data for
system adaptation, NMT post-editing al-
lows for substantial time savings and leads
to equal or slightly better quality.

1 Introduction

The use of neural networks for sequence transduc-
tion (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever
et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) has led to as-
tounding progress in the field of machine trans-
lation (MT), establishing a new level of quality
in applications such as automatic news translation
(Sennrich et al., 2016b; Hassan et al., 2018). Nev-
ertheless, the creation of publication-grade trans-
lations still requires human involvement (Läubli
et al., 2018; Toral et al., 2018a), and previous work
has explored human–machine collaboration in the
form of post-editing, where human experts revise
machine translated text where necessary.

Empirical investigations of post-editing produc-
tivity with NMT are still scarce, especially for lan-
guage combinations that do not include English as

either the source or target language. In this paper,
we describe and discuss the results of a productiv-
ity test of domain-adapted NMT with the in-house
translation team of Migros Bank, a mid-sized fi-
nancial institution based in Zurich, Switzerland.
We evaluate the use of NMT under typical work-
ing conditions, focussing on two rarely explored
language pairs—German (DE) to French (FR) and
Italian (IT)—and texts from a specialised domain:
banking and finance. We show that using NMT in
combination with translation memories (TMs) and
terminology databases (TBs) enables professional
translators to work faster with no loss (or slight
gains) in quality, even with limited in-domain data
for system adaptation.

2 Background

Early assessments of post-editing productivity
were focussed on technical texts. While a study
by Krings (1994) with user manuals for techni-
cal appliances and rule-based MT found mixed re-
sults, interest in post-editing grew with the advent
of statistical MT (SMT), which enabled time sav-
ings of up to 40 % in film subtitling (Volk, 2008;
de Sousa et al., 2011) and software localisation
(Plitt and Masselot, 2010). Subsequent work con-
cluded that significant time savings can also be
achieved in more complex domains such as legal
(Federico et al., 2012) or marketing texts (Läubli
et al., 2013).

Many productivity tests explored either transla-
tion from or into English (e. g., Plitt and Mas-
selot, 2010), or translation between closely re-
lated languages such as Swedish and Danish (e. g.,
Volk, 2008). Green et al. (2013) conducted a
large-scale experiment from English into three tar-
get languages with different canonical word or-
der: Arabic (VSO), French (SVO), and German

(SOV). While post-editing was significantly faster
than translation from scratch for all combinations,
it is unclear whether their findings would equally
apply to language pairs that do not include English,
particularly if less MT training material is avail-
able. We investigate two language pairs that have
received little attention in post-editing research:
DE–FR and DE–IT.

The effect of using NMT rather than SMT on
translation productivity has not yet been conclu-
sively assessed. One of the first studies contrast-
ing NMT and SMT quality found that NMT pro-
duces less morphological, lexical, and word order
errors, thus reducing post-editing effort by 26 %
in English to German subtitle translation (Ben-
tivogli et al., 2016). However, post-editing effort
was measured with HTER (Snover et al., 2006),
a distance-based metric. Castilho et al. (2017)
found that although more fluent, post-editing NMT
rather than SMT output did not save time in an
educational domain due to a higher number of
omissions, additions, and mistranslations. Con-
versely, time savings doubled with NMT (+36 %)
compared to SMT (+18 %) in literary translation
(Toral et al., 2018b). The number of studies on
NMT post-editing productivity is still limited, and
further studies are needed, not least because find-
ings obtained with different domains and language
combinations are difficult to compare. The present
study contributes data on NMT post-editing speed
and quality in the financial domain.

Previous productivity tests used different exper-
imental designs. In early work, Krings (1994)
found that post-editing of rule-based MT resulted
in a decrease in translation time by 7 % when
translators used pen and paper, but an increase by
20 % when they used a computer instead. Plitt
and Masselot (2010) and Green et al. (2013) com-
pared post-editing to translation from scratch, us-
ing purpose-built web interfaces that showed one
source sentence at a time, paired with a target text

box that was either populated with MT or empty.
Proponents of field tests have argued that while
improving control of extraneous variables, such
designs reduce experimental validity in that they
isolate translators from tools long indispensable
in professional workflows, namely software work-
benches that show multiple sentences at a time and
suggestions from TMs and TBs (Federico et al.,
2012; Läubli et al., 2013). We chose an in-situ de-
sign where translators had access to the tools and
resources known from their daily work.

3 Assessment of Translation Productivity

We conducted a productivity test of domain-
adapted NMT on the premises of Migros Bank.
Subjects translated texts under two experimental
conditions. In TM-ONLY, they used the trans-
lation workbench known from their their daily
work, including a domain-specific TM, a domain-
specific TB, and any online services (except ma-
chine translation) of choice. The same setup was
used in POST-EDIT, except that sentences with no
fuzzy match of at least 80 % in the TM were pop-
ulated with MT within the translation workbench.
We did not show MT where high fuzzy matches
were available because editing high fuzzy matches
is more efficient (Sánchez-Gijón et al., 2019).

Materials We used four German source texts
from Migros Bank. The texts had not been trans-
lated by any of the translators involved in the ex-
periment before, and had been excluded from the
MT training material (see below). The TMs con-
tained several exact and high fuzzy matches for
each text (Table 1).

To pretranslate sentences in POST-EDIT, we
trained WMT17-style bi-RNN systems (Sennrich
et al., 2017) using the marian toolkit (Junczys-
Dowmunt et al., 2016). The training material
consisted of 6 million out-of-domain segments
from publicly available OPUS corpora (Tiede-

mann, 2009), as well as 385’320 and 186’647
in-domain segments for FR and IT, respectively.
We filtered both in- and out-of-domain segments
through a set of mostly length-based heuristics
(Zwahlen et al., 2016), and oversampled the for-
mer as a simple means of domain adaptation.
While this has proven effective in other contexts
(e. g., Sennrich et al., 2016a), we note that trans-
lation quality could likely be improved by means
of more advanced techniques such as fine-tuning
(Luong and Manning, 2015) or multi-domain mod-
elling (Chu et al., 2017).

Subjects A total of four professional translators
took part in the productivity test, two each for the
target languages FR (FR-1, FR-2) and IT (IT-1,
IT-2). All were members of Migros Bank’s inter-
nal translation team. They were therefore familiar
both with the software used and with the language
and terminology of the documents to be trans-
lated. FR-1, who joined the organisation shortly
before the experiment, was less experienced than
the other participants. All subjects had been post-
editing outputs of the MT systems used in the ex-
periment (see above) for three months, and had re-
ceived four hours of post-editing training.

Procedure Each subject translated the four Ger-
man source texts in the same order. Conditions
were counterbalanced (Table 2). Subjects were
first briefed about the purpose and data collected
during the experiment. They were then given 60
minutes to work on each text, which we announced
would likely not be enough to translate all sen-
tences. There were 10-minute breaks between
working blocks, and a 30-minute break in the mid-

dle of the experiment. A post-experimental survey
concluded the experiment.

We encountered no problems with data collec-
tion, with the exception of a temporary failure of
IT-1’s screen in the last working block. The device
went into standby mode, which was not reported
immediately and resulted in a total interruption of
4 minutes, which we deducted from the respec-
tive session before calculating translation speed as
shown in Table 2.

3.1 Speed

We report translation speed as the number of tar-
get words produced per hour. To account for TM
matches, we derive a TM coverage coefficient R
for each text:

R = 1a+ 0.9b+ 0.8c, (1)

where a is the percentage of 100 %, b the percent-
age of 90 %, and c the percentage of 80 % TM
matches. We then adjust the number of words W
translated in each experimental block as

W ∗ = (1−R)W. (2)

This approximation assumes uniform distribution
of TM matches within texts.

Results are shown in Table 2. FR subjects pro-
duced 584.81 and 934.14 words per hour in TM-
ONLY and POST-EDIT, respectively, an increase
of 59.74 %. The difference was less marked in
IT, with 452.67 and 494.57 words per hour pro-
duced in TM-ONLY and POST-EDIT, respectively
(9.26 %).

While focussing on descriptive statistics due to
small sample size, we also fit linear-mixed effects
models for inferential analysis. Carter and Woj-
ton (2018) show that very small sample sizes can
attain sufficient power when a single fixed effect
factor is of interest, albeit at a greater risk of type I
errors. We use experimental condition (TM-ONLY
vs. POST-EDIT) as the fixed effect factor, and ran-
dom intercepts for subjects and texts. The models
show no deviation from homoscedasticity or nor-
mality in visual inspection of residual plots and
Shapiro-Wilk tests. Likelihood ratio tests show
a significant main effect of experimental condi-
tion in FR (χ2(1) = 9.74, p < .01), but not IT
(χ2(1) = 0.93, p = .33).

3.2 Quality

The translations produced in the experiment were
reviewed by university lecturers in professional
translation, who were remunerated at standard
hourly rates. Experts did not know which transla-
tions were produced using MT. The quality of each
translation was independently assessed by two ex-
perts, who assigned scores on a 6-point scale (1 =
worst, 6 = best) for coherence, cohesion, grammar,
style, cultural adequacy, and overall impression.

Results are shown in Table 3. Each cell is an
average over 8 scores: 4 texts evaluated by two ex-
perts. Note that experts assigned separate scores
for overall impression, which may therefore devi-
ate from the average over scores for the other crite-
ria. Average per-text scores for overall impression
are included in Table 2.

Considering overall impression, experts did not
find a difference in quality between texts produced
with and without MT in FR. In IT, texts translated
with MT received slightly higher scores (+0.13).
MT improved coherence (+0.50), style (+0.50),
and cultural adequacy (+0.25) in FR, as well as

grammar (+0.13) and cultural adequacy (+0.25)
in IT. Cohesion, on the other hand, was found to
be better in texts produced without MT in both FR
(−0.25) and IT (−0.25).

4 Discussion

While the minimum speed hardly differed between
TM-ONLY and POST-EDIT , the latter allowed
for higher average and maximum speed. In FR,
the highest speed measured in POST-EDIT was
1237.13 words per hour (FR-2, text B), as opposed
to 682.64 words per hour in TM-ONLY (FR-2, text
C). In IT, the maximum speed in POST-EDIT was
647.87 words (IT-1, text C), and 553.00 words per
hour in TM-ONLY (IT-2, text C).

Three out of four translators were faster in
POST-EDIT on average. IT-2 did not benefit from
MT: With an average speed of 511.28 words per
hour in TM-ONLY and 468.64 words per hour in
POST-EDIT, the subject was 8.34 % slower. Pre-
vious research has shown that not all translators
benefit equally from MT (e. g., Plitt and Masselot,
2010; Koehn and Germann, 2014), which calls
for large sample sizes in productivity tests (Green
et al., 2013). Although improving robustness, in-
volving a large number of translators is not always
possible in practice – in our case, the in-house
translation team had no more than four members,
and involving external translators would have in-
troduced other confounds (such as domain knowl-
edge) that are hard to control for. We also note that
IT-2 produced translations of above-average qual-
ity (Tables 2, 3), suggesting that MT may be less
beneficial when aiming for maximum quality.

Another observation that warrants discussion is
the difference in productivity between the two tar-
get languages. Again, one possible explanation
is the small number of participants and measure-
ments. A larger number of measurements would

allow more accurate conclusions to be drawn as
to whether the maximum speed achieved in FR
(FR-2, text B) is to be treated as an outlier, or if
translators will repeatedly achieve a throughput of
more than 1,000 words per hour with MT. More-
over, the DE–IT engine was trained with less in-
domain material than the DE–FR engine. This
resulted in lower raw MT quality for IT, which
in turn may have resulted in lower productivity.1

Screen recordings also showed that IT translators
made more stylistic changes to MT outputs, but
apart from slightly higher quality scores overall
(Table 3), we cannot quantify this finding and leave
a more detailed analysis to future work.

With respect to quality, our results confirm pre-
vious findings that post-editing leads to similar
or better translations (e. g., Green et al., 2013).
An interesting nuance is that we find a slight,
but consistent decrease in textual coherence within
post-edited translations in both language pairs.
As the research community is increasingly fo-
cussing on document-level MT, translation work-
bench providers will need to ensure integrability
for future experimentation in real-life settings.

5 Conclusion

We have assessed the impact of NMT on trans-
lation speed and quality in the banking and fi-
nance domain. Despite working with language
pairs that have received limited attention in re-
search contexts and employing a simple means of
domain adaptation, the use of NMT enabled pro-
fessional translators to work faster: 59.74 % in
DE–FR and 9.26 % in DE–IT. Unlike a number of
previous studies, these improvements are not rela-
tive to translation from scratch, but to translation
with domain-specific TMs and TBs within a cus-
tomary translation workbench, which sets a higher
baseline in terms of translation speed.

NMT did not have a negative impact on quality.
To the contrary, scores assigned by expert raters
were slightly higher for post-edited DE–IT transla-
tions. Screen recordings showed that IT translators
devoted more time to stylistic changes of NMT
output, underpinning the importance of translator
training in cases where NMT is to be used to opti-
mise throughput rather than quality.

Another factor that likely contributed to the dif-

1However, Koehn and Germann (2014) find that between-
subjects variance is higher than between-systems variance in
post-editing.

ference between time savings in DE–FR and DE–
IT is that roughly half as much in-domain train-
ing data was available for the latter. While fur-
ther investigation will be needed to determine the
impact of in-domain data volume and more ad-
vanced domain adaptation techniques, our results
suggest that NMT has the potential of increas-
ing translation productivity even with complex text
types, little-researched language pairs, and limited
amounts of in-domain training data. The present
study contributes empirical evidence for DE–FR
and DE–IT translation of financial texts, and we
hope to encourage similar investigations with other
languages and domains.
