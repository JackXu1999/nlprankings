Abstract

This paper describes a pilot NER system for
Twitter, comprising the USFD system en-
try to the W-NUT 2015 NER shared task.
The goal is to correctly label entities in a
tweet dataset, using an inventory of ten types.
We employ structured learning, drawing on
gazetteers taken from Linked Data, and on un-
supervised clustering features, and attempting
to compensate for stylistic and topic drift – a
key challenge in social media text. Our result
is competitive; we provide an analysis of the
components of our methodology, and an ex-
amination of the target dataset in the context
of this task.

1 Introduction

Social media is a very challenging genre for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) (Derczynski et al., 2013a),
providing high-volume linguistically idiosyncratic text
rich in latent signals, the correct interpretation of which
requires diverse contextual and author-based informa-
tion. Consequently, this noisy content renders NLP
systems trained on more consistent, longer documents,
such as newswire, mostly impotent (Derczynski et al.,
2015b). Suffering from a sustained dearth of annotated
Twitter datasets, it may be useful to understand what
makes this genre tick, and how our existing techniques
and resources can be generalised better to fit such a
challenging text source.

This paper has focused on introducing our Named
Entity Recognition (NER) entry to the WNUT eval-
uation challenge (Baldwin et al., 2015), which builds
on our earlier experiments with Twitter and news NER
(Derczynski and Bontcheva, 2014; Bontcheva et al.,
2013; Cunningham et al., 2002). In particular, we push
data sources and representations, using what is know
about Twitter so far to construct a model that informs
our choices. Specifically, we attempt to compensate for
entity drift; to harness unsupervised word clustering in
a principled fashion; to bring in large-scale gazetteers;
to attenuate the impact of terms frequent in this text
type; and to pick and choose targeted gazetteers for
specific entity types.

2 Datasets

The training and development sets provided with the
challenge were drawn from the Ritter et al. (2011) cor-
pus. This was a set of 2394 tweets from late 2010,
annotated with ten entity types, including the “other”
type. A later release in the challenge gave a set of
420 tweets from 2015, annotated in the same way
(dev 2015). As no other tweet corpora use this 10-class
entity model, we stuck with this data for the supervised
parts of our approach.

For language modelling, we used a set of 250
million tweets drawn from the Twitter garden hose,
which is a fair 10% sample of all tweets (Kergl et al.,
2014). These were reduced to just English tweets using
langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012), and then tokenized
using the twokenizer tool (Connor et al., 2010), which
gives the same tokenization as used in the input and
evaluation corpora.

In addition, we used three sources of gazetteers. The
first two were manually created, and covered named
temporal expressions (Brucato et al., 2013) and first
person names (Cunningham et al., 2002). The last
comprised more recent data, drawn automatically from
Freebase as part of a distant supervision approach to
entity detection and relation annotation (Augenstein et
al., 2014).

3 Method

The WNUT Twitter NER task required us to address
many data sparsity challenges. Firstly, the datasets in-
volved are simply very small, making it hard to gen-
eralise in supervised learning, and meaning that effect
sizes cannot be reliably measured. Secondly, Twitter
language is arguably one of the noisiest and idiosyn-
cratic text genres, which manifests as a large number of
word types, and very large vocabularies due to lexical
variation (Eisenstein, 2013). Thirdly, the language and
especially entities found in tweets change over time,
which is commonly referred to as drift. The majority
of the WNUT training data is from 2010, and only a
small amount from 2015, leading to a sparsity in ex-
amples of modern language. Therefore, in our machine
learning approach, many of the features we introduce
are there to combat sparsity.

3.1 Unsupervised Clustering

We use an unsupervised clustering of terms to generate
word type features. The goal of this is to gain a pro-
gressive reduction in the profusion of word types in-
trinsic to the text type. 250 million tweets from 2010-
2012 were used to generate 2,000 word classes using
Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992). Typically 1,000
or fewer are used; the larger number of classes was cho-
sen because it helpfully increased the expressivity of
the representation (Derczynski et al., 2015a), while re-
taining a useful sparsity reduction. These hierarchical
classes were represented using bit depths of 3-10 in-
clusive, and then 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20, one feature per
depth. The typical levels are 4, 6, 10 and 20, though
selection of bit depths to use often yields brittle feature
sets (Koo et al., 2008), and so we leave it to the clas-
sifier to decide which ones are useful. These choices
are examined in our post-exercise investigations into
the model, Section 5.1, and the clusters provided with
this paper. Finally, we also include the Brown class
paths for the previous token.

To aid in filtering out common tokens and reducing
the impact they may have as e.g. spurious gazetteer
matches, we incorporate a term frequency from our
language model. This is applied to terms that are in
the top 50,000 found in our garden hose sample, and
represented as a feature having a value scaled in pro-
portion to the term’s relative frequency, multiplied by
100 to reduce underflows and ensure it has an effective
impact.

3.2 Morpho-Syntactic Features

To model context, we used reasonably conventional
features: the token itself, the uni- and bigrams in a
[−2, 2] offset window from the current token, and both
wordshape (e.g. London becomes Xxxxxx) and reduced
wordshape (London to Xx) features.

We also included a part-of-speech tag for each token.
These were automatically generated by a custom tweet
PoS tagger using an extension of the PTB tagset (Der-
czynski et al., 2013b).

To capture orthographic information, we take suffix
and prefix features of length [1..3].

Capitalisation is notoriously unreliable in tweets,
and also often overfitted to by newswire systems
trained on more canonical forms of text. To wean these
systems away from capitals while trying to minimise
false negatives, we used case-insensitive gazetteers to
generate gazetteer features.

3.3 Gazetteers

While we collected and experimented with a variety of
gazetteers, the most helpful ones were:

• Freebase gazetteers mined for distant supervi-
sion (Augenstein et al., 2014);

• ANNIE first name lists (Cunningham et al., 2002);

NE type Freebase type
company /business/business operation,

/organization/organization
facility /architecture/building, /architecture/structure,

/travel/tourist attraction
geo-loc /location/location

sportsteam /sports/sports team

Table 1: NE types and corresponding Freebase types
used for creating gazetteers

• First name trigger terms (Derczynski and
Bontcheva, 2014);

• Lists of named temporal expressions (Brucato et
al., 2013), used due to the prevalence of festival
and event names in the other category.

Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) is a large knowl-
edge base consisting of around 3 billion facts1. As
such, it has been used extensively as background
knowledge for NLP tasks such as entity and relation
extraction (Augenstein et al., 2014). Gazetteers for
the 10 entity types were retrieved from Freebase semi-
automatically. Some of the types correspond to Free-
base types directly, e.g. person corresponds to /peo-
ple/person, but for other types such as product there are
no directly corresponding types. To build gazetteers,
we therefore retrieved all Freebase types for all entities
in the training corpus and selected the most prominent
Freebase types per entity type in the gold standard. The
list of Freebase types corresponding to each entity type
in the gold standard is listed in Table 1.

For each Freebase type, separate gazetteers were cre-
ated for entity names and alternative names (aliases),
since the latter tend to be of lower quality.

There were several other gazetteer sources that we
tried but which did not work very well: IMDb dumps,2

Ritter’s LabeledLDA lists (Ritter et al., 2011) (du-
plicated in the baseline system), and ANNIE’s other

gazetteers (largely consisting of organisations, loca-
tions, and date entities) en masse. Each of these in-
troduced a drop in performance or an unstable perfor-
mance, possibly due to the increased ambiguity. This is
a known problem with discriminative learning – only a
certain amount of gazetteers may be used as features in
this way before performance of a discriminative learner
drops (Smith and Osborne, 2006).

3.4 Learning Models and Representation
As BIO NE chunking is readily framed as a se-
quence labeling problem, we experimented with struc-
tured learning. Out of CRF using L-BFGS updates,
CRF with passive-aggressive updates to combat Twit-
ter noise (Derczynski and Bontcheva, 2014), and struc-
tured perceptron (also useful on Twitter noise (Jo-
hannsen et al., 2014)), CRF L-BFGS provided the best
performance on our dataset for the ten-types task.

3.5 Training Data
In our final system, we included the dev 2015 data,
to combat drift present in the corpus. We anticipated
that the test set would be from 2015. The original
dataset was harvested in 2010, long enough ago to
be demonstrably disadvantaged when compared with
modern data (Fromreide et al., 2014), and so it was
critical to include something more. The compensate for
the size imbalance – the dev 2015 data is 0.175 the size
of the 2010 data – we weighted down the older dataset
to by 0.7, as suggested by (Cherry and Guo, 2015), im-
plemented by uniformly scaling individual feature val-
ues on older instances. This successfully reduced the
negative impact of the inevitable drift.

4 Performance
Our results are given in Table 2. As can be seen, the
best results were achieved for the person and geo-loc
entity types. It is also worth noting that performance
on the notypes task is significantly better across all met-
rics, which indicates that the system is capable of iden-
tifying entities correctly, but encounters issues with
their type classification.

We found that the biggest contributions to our sys-
tem’s performance were the Freebase gazetteer fea-

tures, and using Brown clusters with high values of m
(the number of classes) and large amounts of recent in-
put data. This led our computational efforts in the last
week to be based around running the biggest Brown
clustering task that we could in time.

We also noted during testing that, while passive-
aggressive CRF updates helped with single-type en-
tity recognition in tweets (Derczynski and Bontcheva,
2014), it was detrimental to an all-types system. It
was also not helpful for the no-types task, where L-
BFGS updates again gave better performance. This is
rational: the all-types and multiple-types tasks are ef-
fectively similar when contrasted with the single-types
task, in that they require the recognition of many dif-
ferent kinds of named entity.

Finally, we found that other gazetteer types were not
helpful to performance; taking for example all of the
ANNIE gazetteers, gazetteers from IMDb dumps, en-
tity names extracted from other Twitter NER corpora,
or entities generated through LLDA (Ritter et al., 2011)
all decreased performance. We suspect this is due to
their swamping already-small input dataset with too
great a profusion of information, c.f. Smith and Os-
borne (2006).

In addition, we tried generating semi-supervised data
using vote-constrained bootstrapping, but this was not
helpful either – presumably due to the initially low per-
formance of machine-learning based tools on Twitter
NER making it hard to develop semi-supervised boot-
strapped training data, no matter how stringent the fil-
tering of autogenerated examples.

For the final run, we were faced with a decision
about fitting. We could either choose a configuration
that minimised training loss on all the available train-
ing data (train + dev + dev 2015), but risked overfit-
ting to it. Alternatively, we could choose a configura-
tion that fit less well, in order to avoid overfitting. In
the end, we decided to adopt the above principled ap-
proach, assuming that final data would be from 2015,
and therefore down-weighting training data from prior
years. We also evaluated the system while including
the dev 2015 data in the training set, to see how well
we would match it.

5 Analysis
5.1 Features
In terms of features, we looked at the strongest-
weighted observations in the notypes model, to see
what the general indicators are of named entities in
tweets. The largest of these are shown in Table 3.
Of note is that features indicating URLs, hashtags and
usernames indicate against an entity; lowercase words
including punctuation, or comprising only punctuation,
are not entities; being proceeded by at indicates being
in an entity (+ve B weight and -ve O weight); being
preceded by of, and or with suggests an entity; short
words and hashtag-shaped words are not entities; be-
ing followed by tonight suggests being inside an entity;

numbers rarely start entities; and being matched by an
entry in the video games gazetteer suggests being an
entity.

One cluster prefix was indicative of being outside an
entity. This cluster prefix contained four subclusters,
each dominated by lot of frequently-occurring dates
(e.g. September with 12368 mentions in the source
data) and less-frequent date spellings like Wedneaday
or rarer occasions Pentecost, but also a lot of less-
frequent noise entries, some of which were potentially
named entities (e.g. #ITV3, Buggati, Katja). The noise
present suggests that, while the clustering is working
well, there are not enough clusters; for 250M tweets,
we should use m > 2000 (Derczynski et al., 2015a).

We also looked at the Brown clusters most indicative
of entity starts in the typed task, to get an idea of how
these clusters helped. Results are shown in Table 4.
Without going into too much detail – the cluster paths

are distributed with this work, and on the web,3 for fur-
ther examination – some top-level observations can be
made. Firstly, the preceding word is often influential;
note the large number of prev features. Secondly, the
clusters prefixed 111100- contained words often used
as the first term in many kinds of entity, suggesting
distributional similarities in the first words of named
entities. As Brown clustering is based on bigram dis-
tributionality, this finding aligns with the existence of
highly-weighted common preceding tokens seen in the
model weights for the notypes task. Thirdly, Brown
clusters are more useful for some entity types than oth-
ers; there are more features for person, company and
geo-loc types than others.

Note the large-weighted shallow-depth features for
entities. One is for the terms found before a sport-
steam entity (but not a person, note the -ve weight):
prev p3x010. This cluster subtree contains many ad-
jectives, possessive pronouns and determiners (the, ur,
dis, each, mah, his etc.). The terms helpful when not
preceding geo-locs were close to this subtree, differing
only in its least-significant bit: prev p3x011. This other
large-weighted shallow-depth feature was also useful
for avoiding first terms of person entities. Its cluster
subtree contains common nouns and qualifiers (one,
people, good, shit, day, great, little), though it is not
immediately clear how these terms were helpful; per-
haps the prominence of this subtree feature is due to its
frequency alone, and better regularisation is needed to
handle it.

5.2 Gold standard
When developing the system, we encountered sev-
eral problems and inconsistencies in the gold standard.
These issues are partly a general problem of develop-
ing gold standards, i.e. the more complicated the task
is, the more humans tend to disagree on correct an-
swers (Tissot et al., 2015). For Twitter NERC with
10 types, some of the tokens are very difficult to la-
bel because the context window is very small (140
characters), which then also leads to acronyms being
used very frequently to save space, and because world
knowledge about sports, music etc. is required.

In particular, the following groups of problems in the
gold standard training corpus were identified:

Broad categories: While some of the NE types are
well-defined (e.g. person, geo-loc), other types are very
broad and therefore pose a big challenge. This is al-
ready evident by the number of gazetteers created per
type (see Table 1), i.e. those broad categories consist
of many different subtypes. Since the training set is
very small, only a handfull of examples are observed
for each subtype (e.g. video game), which makes train-
ing a classifier for those types very challenging. One
of the most challenging types was products, as many
different things can be products.

3See http://derczynski.com/sheffield/resources/gha.250M-
c2000.tar

51



Overlapping types: Some NEs belong to more than
one type, which makes the classification task even more
difficult. For example, it is difficult to distinguish
between companies and their products with the same
name. There are also inconcistent examples of this in
the gold standard, e.g. “I: O just: O bought: O Dior: B-
product mascara: O”. In this example, “Dior” should
be annotated as a company, but “Dior mascara” as a
product from that company.

The type other: Since annotation guidelines are not
available for the gold standard, we rely entirely on ex-
amples in the training set to identify what subtypes be-
long to the type “other”. While most examples seem
to be public holidays and events, the type also seems
to be used for overlapping or otherwise unclear tokens.
Examples for this are “Radio 1” (a broadcasting organ-
isation), “UMASS” (a university), “Edmonton Journal”
(a broadcasting organisation), “Dems” (democrats, a
group of people or a policical party). The type “other”
is also one for which annotation guidelines differ heav-
ily – meaning performance does not increase if we try
to aggregate the gold standard corpus with over avail-
able Twitter NER gold standards.

Inconsistent annotation for hashtags: Important
words in tweets are often preceded by a hashtag to
emphasise them, e.g. “#JenniferAniston quote of the
day”. Despite the fact that many of the 327 tokens
starting with hashtags were named entities, only 5 of
them are annotated with NE types (#Vh1: B-other,
#Astros: B-sportsteam, #Denver: B-geo-loc, #Padres:
B-sportsteam, #BB11: B-tvshow). The false negatives
belong to different NE types and are mostly easy to
spot (e.g. #BROOKLYN, #lindsaylohan). A related
problem is the annotation of direct mentions of Twitter
accounts with @ in sentences, e.g in “All: O caught:
O up: O with: O @SHO weeds: O !: O”. In that sen-
tence, “@SHO weeds” refers to the Showtime TV se-
ries “Weeds” and should be annotated as tvshow. How-
ever, all tokens starting with @ are annotated as O, so
even though this is not neccessarily correct, it is con-
sistent within the gold standard.

6 Conclusion
This paper has described the USFD system entered
in W-NUT 2015. It achieves performance through
unsupervised feature generation, through Freebase
gazetteers, and through weighting input data according
to its origin date in order to account for drift. This lead
to state-of-the-art Twitter NER performance.
