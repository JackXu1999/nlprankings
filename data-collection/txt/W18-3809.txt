Abstract 

We introduce the contemporary Amharic corpus, which is automatically tagged for morpho-

syntactic information. Texts are collected from 25,199 documents from different domains and 

about 24 million orthographic words are tokenized. Since it is partly a web corpus, we made 

some automatic spelling error corrections. We have also modified the existing morphological 

analyzer, HornMorpho, to use it for automatic tagging. 

1 Introduction 

Amharic is a Semitic language that serves as the working language of the Federal Government of Ethi-

opia. Next to Arabic, it is the most spoken Semitic language. Though it plays several roles, it is consid-

ered one of the less-resourced languages. This is because it lacks basic tools and resources for carrying 

out natural language processing research and applications. 

One of the main hurdles in natural language processing of Amharic is the absence of sizable, clean 

and properly tagged corpora. Since Amharic is morphologically rich and the boundary of the syntactic 

word in an orthographic word is unclear in most cases. Even if it is possible to use some techniques of 

collecting a big corpus from the web, the basic natural language tasks like POS tagging or parsing would 

be challenging if we base our analysis on orthographic words. In Amharic, orthographic words represent 

different linguistic units. It is possible for an orthographic word to represent a phrase, a clause, or a 

sentence. This is because some syntactic words like prepositions, conjunctions, axillaries, etc. can be 

attached to other lexical categories. Thus, for proper tagging and syntactic analysis, these morphemes 

should be separated from their phonological host. In this project, we made an effort to collect, segment, 

and tag text documents from various sources. 

2 Related Works 

Even though Amharic is a less-resourced language, there are some corpus collections by different initi-

atives. Since the introduction of the notion of considering the web as a corpus, which is motivated for 

practical reasons of getting larger data with open access and low cost, there have been corpora of differ-

ent sizes for Amharic. In this section, we describe three corpora: the Walta Information Center (WIC), 

the HaBit (amWaC17), and the An Crúbadán. 

The WIC corpus is a medium-sized corpus of 210,000 tokens collected from 1,065 Amharic news 

documents (Demeke and Getachew, 2006)⁠⁠. The corpus is manually annotated for POS tags. The number 

of tag-sets, which is proposed based on the orthographic word, is 31. They use compound tag-sets for 

those words with prepositions and conjunctions. Even though they distinguish some subclasses of a 

given category (like noun and verb), the distinction no longer exists when these forms attach prepositions 

and/or conjunctions. However, they propose independent tags for both prepositions and conjunctions 

without favoring segmentation of these clitics. In the annotation process, annotators were given training

and guidelines. Each annotator was given a different news article. They were asked to write the tags by 

hand and the annotation was given to a typist to insert the handwritten tag into the document. In such a 

process, there may be some loss of information which could be attributed to the inconsistencies of the 

annotation (Gambäck et al., 2009; Tachbelie and Menzel, 2009; Yimam et al., 2014) ⁠. In the WIC report, 

they did not provide the annotation consistencies measurement and method of keeping consistency dur-

ing the process of the annotation. According to the recent report of Rychlý and Suchomel (2016) ⁠, the 

efficiency of an automatic tagger developed or trained on this corpus is 87.4%. Since this corpus can be 

accessible to most NLP researchers on Amharic, it is used to train a stemmer (Argaw and Asker, 2007), 

Named Entity recognition (Alemu, 2013) ⁠⁠ and a chunker (Ibrahim and Assabie, 2014) ⁠.  

 The HaBit corpus, called amWaC17 (Amharic ‘Web as Corpus’, the year 2017) is another web 

corpus, which was developed by crawling using SpiderLing (Rychlý and Suchomel, 2016) ⁠⁠. Most of the 

crawling was done in August 2013, October 2015, and January 2016. The current version includes a web 

corpus crawled from May to September 2017 and consists of 30.5 million tokens collected from 75,509 

documents. The corpus is cleaned and tagged for POS using a TreeTagger trained on WIC. They have 

used the same tag-sets used in WIC and followed the same principles as WIC in tagging tokens. 

The An Crúbadán corpus was developed under the project called corpus building for under-resourced 

languages. The initiative aimed at the creation of text corpora for a large number of under-resourced 

languages by crawling the web (Scannell, 2007) ⁠⁠. The project collected written corpora for more than 

2,000 languages. Amharic was one of the languages to be included in this project. The Amharic corpus 

consists of 16,970,855 words crawled from 9,999 documents. The major sources used are Amharic Wik-

ipedia, Universal Declaration of Human Right, and JW.org. This corpus is a list of words with their 

frequencies. 

In the three corpora mentioned above, the written or orthographic form is considered as a word. Syn-

tactic words like prepositions, conjunctions, and articles are not separately treated. In other words, clitics 

were not segmented from their host. In addition, though it is possible to collect authentic data entry from 

the web, such sources are inaccurate. As Amharic is not standardized, in these sources one may face lots 

of variation and expect to find misspellings, typographical errors, and grammatical errors. This calls for 

manual or automatic editing. 

3 Data Collection and Preprocessing 

3.1 Data Collection 

The Contemporary Amharic Corpus (CACO) is collected from archives of various sources which are 

edited and made available for the public. All of the documents are written in modern or contemporary 

Amharic. Table 1 summarizes documents used in the corpus.

3.2 Preprocessing 

The preprocessing of the documents involves spelling correction, normalization of punctuation marks, 

and sentence extraction from paragraphs. In the documents, different types of misspellings are observed. 

Misspellings result from missed out spaces (e.g., አንዳንድየህክምናተቋማትናባለሙያዎቻቸው), replacing letters 

with visually similar characters (e.g., ቇጠረ for ቆጠረ), and typographical errors. In addition, four Amharic 

phonemes have one or more homophonic character representations. The homophonic characters are 

commonly observed to be used interchangeably, which can be considered real-word misspellings. To 

correct the misspellings, we used the spelling corrector developed by Gezmu et al. (2018). Mainly the 

spelling corrector is employed to correct the first two types of spelling errors. As intensive manual in-

tervention is needed to select the correct spelling from the plausible suggestions for typographical errors, 

in the current version of the corpus we have not corrected the typographical errors. To deal with the 

problems of real-word spelling errors resulting from homophonic letters, we adhere to the Ethiopian 

Languages Academy (ELA) spelling reform (ELA, 1970; Aklilu, 2004). Following their reform, homo-

phonic characters are replaced with their common forms; ሐ and ኀ are replaced with ሀ, ሠ with ሰ, ዐ with 

አ, and ፀ with ጸ. 

The other issue that needs attention is normalization of punctuation marks. Different styles of punc-

tuation marks have been used in the documents. For instance, for double quotation mark two single 

quotation marks, “, ”, ‹‹, ››,  ``,  ", « or » are used. Thus, normalization of punctuation marks is a non-

trivial matter. We normalized all types of double quotes by ", all single quotes by ', question marks (e.g., 

？and ፧) by ?, word separators (e.g., : and ፡) by plain space, full stops (e.g., :: and ፡፡) by ።, exclamation 

marks (e.g., ! and ！) by !, hyphens (e.g., :-, and ፡—) by ፦, and commas (e.g., ፥ and ÷) by ፣.  
From the collected documents, sentences are identified and extracted by their boundaries—either dou-

ble colon-like symbols (።) or question marks (?)—and are tokenized based on the orthographic-word 

boundary, a white space. 

About 1.6 million sentences are collected from the documents. When the sentences are tokenized by 

plain space as a word boundary, around 24 million orthographic words are found. We build a 3-gram 

language model using the corpus. The corpus statistics are given in Table 2.

4 Segmentation and Tagging 

4.1 Amharic Orthography 

The Amharic script is known as Ge’ez or Ethiopic. The system allows representing a consonant and a 

vowel together as a symbol. Each symbol represents a CV syllable. However, a syllable in Amharic may 

have a CVC structure. It is worth taking into account that the writing system does not mark gemination. 

Gemination is phonemic; it can bring meaning distinctions and in some cases can also convey grammat-

ical information. 

As in other languages, Amharic texts show variation in writing compound words. They can be written 

in three ways: with a space between the compound words (e.g., ሆደ ሰፊ /hodə səffi/ “patient”, ምግብ ቤት 

/mɨgɨb bet/ “restaurant”), separated by a hyphen (e.g., ስነ-ልሳን /sɨnə-lɨsan/ “linguistics”, ስነ-ምግባር /sɨnə-

mɨgɨbar/ “behavior”) or written as a single word (e.g., ቤተሰብ /betəsəb/ “family”, ምድረበዳ /mɨdrəbəda/ 

“desert”). 

Orthographic words, which are separated by whitespace (semicolon in old documents), may be cou-

pled with function words like a preposition, a conjunction or auxiliaries. In most cases, an orthographic 

word may function as a phrase (e.g., ከቤትዋ /kəbətwa/ “from her house”), a clause (e.g., የመጣው 

/jəmmət‘t‘aw/ “the one who came”), or even a sentence (e.g., አልበላችም /ʔalbəllaʧʧɨm/ “She did not eat.”). 



68

In addition, the writing system allows people to write in a phonemic form (the abstract form or what one 

intends to say) or in a phonetic form (what is actually uttered). As a result, we have different forms for 

a given word.  

All the above features need to be addressed in processing Amharic texts. Some of the above problems 

call for standardization efforts to be made, whereas others are due to the decision to write what is in 

mind and what is actually produced. Furthermore, for proper syntactic analyses, clitics could be seg-

mented. We used an existing morphological analyzer with some improvements to perform the possible 

segmentation and tagging. 

4.2 Proposed Tag-sets 

As we have indicated in Section 2, most works on POS tags in Amharic are based on orthographic words. 

In such approach, they proposed compound tagsets for words with other syntactic words. Tagged corpora 

following this approach may not be used for syntactic analyses. For syntactic analysis, we need infor-

mation about the structure within a phrase, a clause and a sentence. Tagging with a bundle of tagset will 

hide such syntactic information.  

    Since one of the main objectives of the tagging task is to provide lexical information that can be 

employed for syntactic analysis like parsing, we suggest that syntactic words should be the unit of anal-

ysis for tagging rather than orthographic words. In light of this, we can follow what is proposed by 

Seyoum et al. (2018). In this work, a syntactic word is used for the analysis in favor of a lexicalist 

syntactic view. They suggested that clitics should be segmented as a pre-processing step. Since manual 

segmentation is very costly and time taking, we opted for doing morphological segmentation using an 

existing tool that could be closer to our intention. For this purpose, we have found HornMorpho to be a 

possible candidate with some improvement. Although this tagset has not yet been fully integrated into 

HornMorpho, we use it for analysis since no other analyzer has comparable coverage. 

4.3 HornMorpho Analysis and Limitations 

HornMorpho (Gasser, 2011) is a rule-based system for morphological analysis and generation. As in 

many other modern computational morphological systems, it takes the form of a cascade of composed 

finite-state transducers (FSTs) that implement a lexicon of roots and morphemes, morphotactics, and 

alternation rules governing phonological or orthographic changes at morpheme boundaries (Beesley and 

Karttunen, 2003). To handle the complex long-distance dependencies between morphemes that charac-

terize the morphology of Amharic, the transducers in HornMorpho are weighted with feature structures, 

an approach originally introduced by Amtrup (2003). During transduction, the feature structure weights 

on arcs that are traversed are unified, resulting in transducer output that includes an accumulated feature 

structure as well as a character string. In this way, the transducers retain a memory of where they have 

been, allowing the system to implement agreement and co-occurrence constraints and to output charac-

ters based on morphemes encountered earlier in the word. 

As an example, consider the imperfective forms of Amharic verbs, which, as in other Semitic lan-

guages, include subject person/gender/number agreement prefixes as well as suffixes. The prefix t- en-

codes either third person singular feminine or second person singular masculine, singular feminine or 

plural. The suffix following an imperfective stem, or absence thereof, may disambiguate the prefix. Once 

it has seen the prefix, the HornMorpho transducer “remembers” the set of possible subject person, gen-

der, and number features that are consistent with the input so far. When it reaches the suffix (or finds 

none), it can reduce the set of possible features (or reject the word if an inconsistent suffix is found). So 

in the word ትፈልጊያለሽ /tɨfəllɨgijalləʃ/ “you (sing. fem.) want,” where we have t - fəllɨg - i - alləʃ, the 
presence of the suffix -i following the stem -fəllɨg- tells HornMorpho to constrain the subject person and 

number to second person singular feminine; without the proper prefix, HornMorpho would reject the 

word at this point. 

The major focus in the development of HornMorpho was on lexical words not on function words. 

More specifically, it analyzes nouns and verbs. Since Amharic adjectives behave like nouns, HornMor-

pho does not distinguish between adjectives and nouns. In addition, compound words and light verb 

constructions (in version 2.5) are not handled. It also gives wrong results when it gets words with more 

than two clitics attached to a word. For instance, በበኩላቸው /bəbbəkkulaʧʧəw/ “from his/her side or per-

spective” (this word occurs 4,293 times in the amWaC17). For this word, the system guessed fifteen 

analyses. Furthermore, since clitics are not considered as separate words, the system does not give any 



69

analysis for clitics. Therefore, in order to use this tool for tagging a big corpus, we need to improve the 

coverage of the tool. 

4.4 Improvement to HornMorpho 

For the purposes of this paper, we modified HornMorpho in several ways. Since the major focus of 

HornMorpho is to give analysis for nouns and verbs, it does not give morphological analysis for syntactic 

words. However, as a result of the improvement, it distinguishes more parts-of-speech (verbs, nouns, 

adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, and adpositions). Morphological analysis for constructions like light 

verbs, compound nouns and verbs, are now included in the improved version. As a rule-based system, it 

has limited lexicon. The improved version, however, recognizes personal and place names. For our pur-

pose, we have enhanced the coverage of the lexicon.

  <w pos="PUN">። </w>

Figure 1. An example sentence that is tagged with HornMorpho. 

 

Figure 1 shows an example sentence from our corpus that is tagged by HornMorpho, በዚሁ የደረጃ ዝርዝር 
አንድም ኢትዮጵያዊ አልተካተተም ። /bəzihu jədərəʤa zɨrzɨr ʔandɨmm ʔitjop’ɨjawi ʔaltəkatətəm./ “No Ethiopian 
has been included in the ranking list,” transliterated as bezihu yedereja zrzr 'andm 'ityoPyawi 'altekate-

tem ።. The HornMorpho segmenter puts the stem between {}, gives a POS label for the lexical word, 
and labels grammatical morphemes, which are mostly function words, that are separated by hyphens, 

with features/tags. For verbs, the stem is represented as a sequence of root consonants and a template 

consisting of root consonant positions, vowels and gemination characters. The root consonants and tem-

plate are separated by a “+”, the root consonant positions in the template are represented by numbers, 

and underscore indicates gemination. During analysis by HornMorpho, the Amharic text is transliterated 

to Latin script using the System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII (Firdyiwek and Yaqob, 1997). 

5 Conclusion and Future Works 

In this paper, we have introduced a new resource, CACO, a partly web corpus of Amharic. The corpus 

has been collected from different sources with different domains including newspapers, fiction, histori-

cal books, political books, short stories, children books and the Bible. These sources are believed to be 

well edited but still need automatic editing. The corpus consists of 24 million tokens from 25,199 doc-

uments. It is automatically tagged for POS using HornMorpho. We made some modifications to Horn-

Morpho for the tagging. In doing so, we noticed that Amharic orthographic words should be properly 

segmented in a preprocessing stage. Currently, we have more words with unclassified tags because of 

the limitation of HornMorpho. Therefore, as future work, we plan to enhance HornMorpho for automatic 

tagging. In addition, we plan to increase the size of the data and apply our method to other existing 

corpora.
