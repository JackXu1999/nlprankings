Abstract 

This paper describes various Indonesian language resources that Agency for the Assessment and 

Application of Technology (BPPT) has developed and collected since mid 80’s when we joined 

MMTS (Multilingual Machine Translation System), an international project coordinated by CICC-

Japan to develop a machine translation system for five Asian languages (Bahasa Indonesia, 

Malay, Thai, Japanese, and Chinese). Since then, we have been actively doing many types of 

research in the field of statistical machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis 

which requires many text and speech corpus. Most recent cooperation within ASEAN-IVO is the 

development of Indonesian ALT (Asian Language Treebank) has added new NLP tools. 

1 Introduction 

As a national language of Indonesia, Bahasa Indonesia has been used as a lingua franca in the multi-

lingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the 

world, after China, India and the United States. Of its large population, around 255 million people, the 

majority speak Indonesian, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. 

Aside from speaking the national language, most Indonesians are fluent in any of more than 746 

distinct regional languages (Amalia, 2016) such as Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese, which are 

commonly used at home and within the local community. Most formal education, and nearly all na-

tional media and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian. Throughout the archi-

pelago, Bahasa Indonesia has become the language that bridges the language barrier among Indonesi-

ans who have different mother-tongues.  

In recent years, countries in the same region tend to establish some free trade areas such as ASEAN 

Economic Community (AEC), European Union (EU), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 

(APEC). This opens opportunities to accelerate economic growth for Indonesia. However, these ef-

forts are hindered due to the lack ability of Indonesians in communicating with foreigners. 

BPPT has started collecting language resources since 1987 as part of the development of a multilin-

gual machine translation system in a project called "The Research and Development Cooperation Pro-

ject on a Machine Translation System for Japan and its Neighbouring Countries". At the end of the 

project, many Indonesian language resources have been resulted, such as Indonesian basic dictionary, 

Indonesian grammar rule for analysis and generation system, Indonesian monolingual text corpus, and 

Indonesian gazetteer.  

We have continued collecting language resources to improve the system which has been developed 

and the development of other natural language processing systems. The needs for the development of 

statistical machine translation with Indonesian as source language, Indonesian speech recognition and 

Indonesian speech synthesizer led to the development of other language resources, which are parallel 

corpora and speech corpora for ASR and TTS. 

2 Indonesian Gazetteer 

Indonesia is the world's largest island country, with more than thirteen thousand islands and has 34 

provinces, of which five have Special Administrative status. Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct

native ethnic and linguistic groups. This big country also has many districts, regencies, lakes, mounts, 

ports, airports, rivers, capes, bays, etc. Regarding this diversity, it needed to compile Indonesian Gaz-

etteer as one of the language resources.  Table 1 lists entries of the Indonesian Gazetteer.

3 Indonesian Monolingual Corpus 

Up to now, we have collected around 10.5 million sentences in an Indonesian monolingual corpus. 

The sentences were taken from various sources available on the internet such as national newspa-

pers/magazines and governmental institutions (presidential speech, meeting transcriptions, trial tran-

scriptions, etc.) by using HTTrack, a free offline browser utility (Roche et al., 2007). Table 2 lists all 

the corpora obtained from various sources.

PTIK-BPPT collected around 311,737 sentences in an Indonesian-English parallel corpus to aid our 

research in statistical machine translation. The sentences were taken from various sources available on 

the internet such as national newspapers/magazines and governmental institutions by using HTTrack, 

a free offline browser utility. We hired some professional translators to check the correctness of the 

parallel corpus manually. Table 3 lists all parallel corpus obtained from various sources. 

 

The Asian Language Treebank (ALT) project aims to advance the state-of-the-art Asian natural 

language processing (NLP) techniques through the open collaboration for developing and using ALT. 

The project is a joint effort of six institutes for making a parallel treebank for seven languages: 

English, Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Malay, Myanmar, and Vietnamese. In creating Indonesian - 

ALT, it requires tools to speed up the development.  Some of these tools have been provided by the 

ALT project but for Indonesian we will use tools that were created from previous projects. Among 

them are POS Tagger, Syntax Tree Generator, Shallow Parser, word alignment, etc. Indonesian tree-

bank resulted from this project will be utilize to enhance the exising tools and to create new tools in 

the field of NLP using state of the art techniques. Indonesian treebank is also expected to help the ad-

vancement of NLP researches in Indonesia. 

 

5 Automatic Speech Recognition  

To develop automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, training data in the form of speech corpus is 

required.  The speech corpus for ASR must have a rich combination of uttered phonemes in the target-

ed language. And to make the ASR system speaker independent, the corpus should be created from 

speech recordings of many speakers with various ages and gender.  Currently we have two set of 

speech corpus created for Indonesian ASR.  The first one was made in 2010 for the joint development 

project with PT. INTI
[7]

 to develop an Indonesian ASR system called PERISALAH.  This speech cor-

pus, consists of total 100,000 utterances uttered by 400 people.  The utterances were coming from 

around 7800 unique sentences.  The speakers consists of 200 adults male and 200 adults female, with 

the following composition: 40% Javanese, 20% Sundanese, 20% from Batak, 5% from Minang, 5% 

from Makassar, 5% from Maluku, and 5% from Papua, Bali and Madura.  The ages of the speakers are 

within 20 to 50 years old.  The total duration of the speech data is more than 133 hours. The average 

time per utterance is around 5 seconds, the longest utterance time is 22 seconds, and the shortest utter-

ance time is 1.5 seconds.  The speech data in this corpus was recorded as a single channel data with a 

16KHz sampling rate and a 16-bit data size.  The file format used for storing the data is WAV format.  

This first corpus set was already tested to create an acoustic model for Indonesian ASR with WER of 

around 20% using Julius
[8]

 as the ASR engine. Since the PERISALAH corpus was created as a joint 

development, the ownership was a shared one, so it is not publicly available.   

The second set of the corpus was created in 2013, this second corpus was planned to be made pub-

licly available for research and education purposes.  The second corpus consists of total 49,000 utter-

ances uttered by 200 people, where each person speaks around 245 sentences.  The speakers were con-

sists of 100 male and 100 female, and the age-range were within 15 to 50 years old.  Around 30% of 

the speakers were high-school students.  The sentence used in this corpus comes from 5,000 unique 

sentences. The file format used to store the data is WAV with single channel recording, a 16KHz sam-

pling rate and a 16-bit data size.  The total duration of the speech data is more than 95 hours.  The av-

erage time per utterance is around 6.8 seconds, the longest utterance time is 29 seconds, and the short-

est utterance time is 1.0 seconds.  This second corpus is planned to be released for research and educa-

tion community at the end of 2016. 

 

6 Speech Corpus for The Development of An Indonesian TTS System 

For developing an Indonesian TTS system, PTIK-BPPT now uses 3 sets of speech corpus. Set 1 and 2 

consists of 5,000 WAV files each, and set 3 consists of 15,645 WAV files. Table 4 describes details of 

the speech corpus.

7 Conclusion 

BPPT has collected language resources to develop Indonesian-English statistical machine translation 

system, Indonesian ASR and text-to-speech system. The language resources will help the advancement 

of MT, ASR, and TTS research in Bahasa Indonesia and any NLP-related research in general. The ex-

isting data is enough for developing MT, ASR and TTS for the Bahasa Indonesia language but it needs 

more efforts. We have developed MT, ASR and TTS systems based on this data with adequate per-

formance. Currently we also involved in the development of Asian Language Treebank to enrich our 

NLP resources. Currently all resources are for internal use only, but in the end of 2016 we are plan-

ning to release most of these resources for research and education communities under Common 

Criteria (CC-BY).
