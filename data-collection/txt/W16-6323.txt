Keynote Lecture-2
Neural Models of Text Normalization for Speech Applications

Richard Sproat
Google, New York

Joint work with Navdeep Jaitly, Kyle Gorman and Ke Wu

In  this  talk,  I  will  present  our  recent  research  on  applying  attention-based  RNN's  to  the  problem of  text
normalization for speech applications, in particular text-to-speech. In this task, we want to transform an input
text, e.g. "A baby giraffe is 6ft tall and weighs 150lb", into a sequence of words that represents how that text
would be read, e.g. "a baby giraffe is six feet tall and weighs one hundred fifty pounds". The state of the art for
the complete text normalization problem to date still uses the 20-year-old technology of rule-based weighted
finite-state transducers.
We show that RNNs provide an attractive data-driven approach, but that there are issues with it producing the
occasional unacceptable error, such as reading "£" as "euro". We propose some possible solutions to those errors,
and discuss future directions for this research.
