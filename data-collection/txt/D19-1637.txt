Abstract

Classical Chinese poetry is a jewel in the trea-
sure house of Chinese culture. Previous poem
generation models only allow users to employ
keywords to interfere the meaning of gener-
ated poems, leaving the dominion of gener-
ation to the model. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel task of generating classical Chi-
nese poems from vernacular, which allows
users to have more control over the semantic
of generated poems. We adapt the approach
of unsupervised machine translation (UMT) to
our task. We use segmentation-based padding
and reinforcement learning to address under-
translation and over-translation respectively.
According to experiments, our approach sig-
nificantly improve the perplexity and BLEU
compared with typical UMT models. Further-
more, we explored guidelines on how to write
the input vernacular to generate better poems.
Human evaluation showed our approach can
generate high-quality poems which are com-
parable to amateur poems.

1 Introduction

During thousands of years, millions of classical
Chinese poems have been written. They contain
ancient poets’ emotions such as their apprecia-
tion for nature, desiring for freedom and concerns
for their countries. Among various types of clas-
sical poetry, quatrain poems stand out. On the
one hand, their aestheticism and terseness exhibit
unique elegance. On the other hand, composing
such poems is extremely challenging due to their
phonological, tonal and structural restrictions.

Most previous models for generating classical
Chinese poems (He et al., 2012; Zhang and Lap-
ata, 2014) are based on limited keywords or char-
acters at fixed positions (e.g., acrostic poems).

∗Equal contribution

Since users could only interfere with the semantic
of generated poems using a few input words, mod-
els control the procedure of poem generation. In
this paper, we proposed a novel model for classical
Chinese poem generation. As illustrated in Figure
1, our model generates a classical Chinese poem
based on a vernacular Chinese paragraph. Our ob-
jective is not only to make the model generate aes-
thetic and terse poems, but also keep rich semantic
of the original vernacular paragraph. Therefore,
our model gives users more control power over the
semantic of generated poems by carefully writing
the vernacular paragraph.

Although a great number of classical poems and
vernacular paragraphs are easily available, there
exist only limited human-annotated pairs of poems
and their corresponding vernacular translations.
Thus, it is unlikely to train such poem generation
model using supervised approaches. Inspired by
unsupervised machine translation (UMT) (Lam-
ple et al., 2018b), we treated our task as a transla-
tion problem, namely translating vernacular para-
graphs to classical poems.

However, our work is not just a straight-forward
application of UMT. In a training example for
UMT, the length difference of source and target
languages are usually not large, but this is not true
in our task. Classical poems tend to be more con-
cise and abstract, while vernacular text tends to be
detailed and lengthy. Based on our observation on
gold-standard annotations, vernacular paragraphs
usually contain more than twice as many Chinese
characters as their corresponding classical poems.
Therefore, such discrepancy leads to two main
problems during our preliminary experiments: (1)
Under-translation: when summarizing vernac-
ular paragraphs to poems, some vernacular sen-
tences are not translated and ignored by our model.
Take the last two vernacular sentences in Figure



6156

Figure 1: An example of the training procedures of our model. Here we depict two procedures, namely back
translation and language modeling. Back translation has two paths, namely ES → DT → ET → DS and DT →
ES → DS → ET . Language modeling also has two paths, namely ET → DT and ES → DS . Figure 1 shows only
the former one for each training procedure.

1 as examples, they are not covered in the gener-
ated poem. (2) Over-translation: when expand-
ing poems to vernacular paragraphs, certain words
are unnecessarily translated for multiple times.
For example, the last sentence in the generated
poem of Figure 1, as green as sapphire, is back-
translated as as green as as as sapphire.

Inspired by the phrase segmentation schema
in classical poems (Ye, 1984), we proposed the
method of phrase-segmentation-based padding to
handle with under-translation. By padding po-
ems based on the phrase segmentation custom
of classical poems, our model better aligns po-
ems with their corresponding vernacular para-
graphs and meanwhile lowers the risk of under-
translation. Inspired by Paulus et al. (2018), we
designed a reinforcement learning policy to penal-
ize the model if it generates vernacular paragraphs
with too many repeated words. Experiments show
our method can effectively decrease the possibility
of over-translation.

The contributions of our work are threefold:
(1) We proposed a novel task for unsupervised

Chinese poem generation from vernacular text.
(2) We proposed using phrase-segmentation-

based padding and reinforcement learning to ad-
dress two important problems in this task, namely
under-translation and over-translation.

(3) Through extensive experiments, we proved

the effectiveness of our models and explored how
to write the input vernacular to inspire better po-
ems. Human evaluation shows our models are able
to generate high quality poems, which are compa-
rable to amateur poems.

Classical Chinese Poem Generation Most pre-
vious works in classical Chinese poem genera-
tion focus on improving the semantic coherence of
generated poems. Based on LSTM, Zhang and La-
pata (2014) purposed generating poem lines incre-
mentally by taking into account the history of what
has been generated so far. Yan (2016) proposed
a polishing generation schema, each poem line is
generated incrementally and iteratively by refining
each line one-by-one. Wang et al. (2016) and Yi et
al. (2018) proposed models to keep the generated
poems coherent and semantically consistent with
the user’s intent. There are also researches that fo-
cus on other aspects of poem generation. (Yang et
al. (2018) explored increasing the diversity of gen-
erated poems using an unsupervised approach. Xu
et al. (2018) explored generating Chinese poems
from images. While most previous works gener-
ate poems based on topic words, our work targets
at a novel task: generating poems from vernacular
Chinese paragraphs.
Unsupervised Machine Translation Compared



6157

with supervised machine translation approaches
(Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), un-
supervised machine translation (Lample et al.,
2018a,b) does not rely on human-labeled parallel
corpora for training. This technique is proved to
greatly improve the performance of low-resource
languages translation systems. (e.g. English-Urdu
translation). The unsupervised machine transla-
tion framework is also applied to various other
tasks, e.g. image captioning (Feng et al., 2019),
text style transfer (Zhang et al., 2018), speech
to text translation (Bansal et al., 2017) and clin-
ical text simplification (Weng et al., 2019). The
UMT framework makes it possible to apply neu-
ral models to tasks where limited human labeled
data is available. However, in previous tasks that
adopt the UMT framework, the abstraction levels
of source and target language are the same. This
is not the case for our task.
Under-Translation & Over-Translation Both
are troublesome problems for neural sequence-
to-sequence models. Most previous related re-
searches adopt the coverage mechanism (Tu et al.,
2016; Mi et al., 2016; Sankaran et al., 2016).
However, as far as we know, there were no suc-
cessful attempt applying coverage mechanism to
transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017).

3 Model

3.1 Main Architecture

We transform our poem generation task as an un-
supervised machine translation problem. As il-
lustrated in Figure 1, based on the recently pro-
posed UMT framework (Lample et al., 2018b), our
model is composed of the following components:

• Encoder Es and decoder Ds for vernacular
paragraph processing

• Encoder Et and decoder Dt for classical
poem processing

where Es (or Et) takes in a vernacular paragraph
(or a classical poem) and converts it into a hidden
representation, and Ds (or Dt) takes in the hid-
den representation and converts it into a vernac-
ular paragraph (or a poem). Our model relies on
a vernacular texts corpus S and a poem corpus T.
We denote S and T as instances in S and T respec-
tively.

The training of our model relies on three proce-
dures, namely parameter initialization, language

modeling and back-translation. We will give de-
tailed introduction to each procedure.
Parameter initialization As both vernacular and
classical poem use Chinese characters, we initial-
ize the character embedding of both languages in
one common space, the same character in two lan-
guages shares the same embedding. This initial-
ization helps associate characters with their plau-
sible translations in the other language.
Language modeling It helps the model generate
texts that conform to a certain language. A well-
trained language model is able to detect and cor-
rect minor lexical and syntactic errors. We train
the language models for both vernacular and clas-
sical poem by minimizing the following loss:

Llm = E
S∈S

[− logP (S|Ds(Es(SN ))]+

E
T∈T

[− logP (T |Dt(Et(TN ))],
(1)

where SN (or TN ) is generated by adding noise
(drop, swap or blank a few words) in S (or T ).
Back-translation Based on a vernacular para-
graph S, we generate a poem TS using Es and Dt,
we then translate TS back into a vernacular para-
graph STS = Ds(Et(TS)). Here, S could be used
as gold standard for the back-translated paragraph
STs . In this way, we could turn the unsupervised
translation into a supervised task by maximizing
the similarity between S and STS . The same also
applies to using poem T as gold standard for its
corresponding back-translation TST . We define
the following loss:

Lbt = E
S∈S

[− logP (S|Ds(Et(TS))]+

E
T∈T

[− logP (T |Dt(Es(ST ))].
(2)

Note that Lbt does not back propagate through
the generation of TS and ST as we observe no im-
provement in doing so. When training the model,
we minimize the composite loss:

L = α1Llm + α2Lbt, (3)

where α1 and α2 are scaling factors.

3.2 Addressing Under-Translation and
Over-Translation

During our early experiments, we realize that the
naive UMT framework is not readily applied to
our task. Classical Chinese poems are featured for



6158

its terseness and abstractness. They usually focus
on depicting broad poetic images rather than de-
tails. We collected a dataset of classical Chinese
poems and their corresponding vernacular transla-
tions, the average length of the poems is 32.0 char-
acters, while for vernacular translations, it is 73.3.
The huge gap in sequence length between source
and target language would induce over-translation
and under-translation when training UMT models.
In the following sections, we explain the two prob-
lems and introduce our improvements.

3.2.1 Under-Translation

By nature, classical poems are more concise and
abstract while vernaculars are more detailed and
lengthy, to express the same meaning, a vernacular
paragraph usually contains more characters than a
classical poem. As a result, when summarizing a
vernacular paragraph S to a poem TS , TS may not
cover all information in S due to its length limit. In
real practice, we notice the generated poems usu-
ally only cover the information in the front part of
the vernacular paragraph, while the latter part is
unmentioned.

To alleviate under-translation, we propose
phrase segmentation-based padding. Specifically,
we first segment each line in a classical poem
into several sub-sequences, we then join these sub-
sequences with the special padding tokens <p>.
During training, the padded lines are used instead
of the original poem lines. As illustrated in Figure
2, padding would create better alignments between
a vernacular paragraph and a prolonged poem,
making it more likely for the latter part of the ver-
nacular paragraph to be covered in the poem. As
we mentioned before, the length of the vernacu-
lar translation is about twice the length of its cor-
responding classical poem, so we pad each seg-
mented line to twice its original length.

According to Ye (1984), to present a stronger
sense of rhythm, each type of poem has its unique
phrase segmentation schema, for example, most
seven-character quatrain poems adopt the 2-2-3
schema, i.e. each quatrain line contains 3 phrases,
the first, second and third phrase contains 2, 2,
3 characters respectively. Inspired by this law,
we segment lines in a poem according to the cor-
responding phrase segmentation schema. In this
way, we could avoid characters within the scope
of a phrase to be cut apart, thus best preserve the
semantic of each phrase.(Chang et al., 2008)

Figure 2: A real example to show the effectiveness
of our phrase-segmentation-based padding. Without
padding, the vernacular paragraph could not be aligned
well with the poem. Therefore, the text in South
Yangtze ends but the grass and trees have not withered
in red is not covered in the poem. By contrast, they are
covered well after using our padding method.

3.2.2 Over-Translation
In NMT, when decoding is complete, the decoder
would generate an <EOS>token, indicating it has
reached the end of the output sequence. However,
when expending a poem T into a vernacular Chi-
nese paragraph ST , due to the conciseness nature
of poems, after finishing translating every source
character in T , the output sequence ST may still be
much shorter than the expected length of a poem‘s
vernacular translation. As a result, the decoder
would believe it has not finished decoding. In-
stead of generating the <EOS>token, the decoder
would continue to generate new output characters
from previously translated source characters. This
would cause the decoder to repetitively output a
piece of text many times.

To remedy this issue, in addition to minimizing
the original loss function L, we propose to mini-
mize a specific discrete metric, which is made pos-
sible with reinforcement learning.

We define repetition ratio RR(S) of a para-
graph S as:

RR(S) = 1− vocab(S)
len(S)

, (4)

where vocab(S) refers to the number of distinc-
tive characters in S, len(S) refers the number
of all characters in S. Obviously, if a gener-
ated sequence contains many repeated characters,
it would have high repetition ratio. Following the
self-critical policy gradient training (Rennie et al.,

Table 1: Statistics of our dataset

2017), we define the following loss function:

Lrl = E
S∈S

[(RR(STS )− τ) logP (S|Ds(Et(TS))],
(5)

where τ is a manually set threshold. Intuitively,
minimizing Lrl is equivalent to maximizing the
conditional likelihood of the sequence S given
STS if its repetition ratio is lower than the thresh-
old τ . Following (Wu et al., 2016), we revise the
composite loss as:

L′ = α1Llm + α2Lbt + α3Lrl, (6)

where α1, α2, α3 are scaling factors.

4 Experiment

The objectives of our experiment are to explore the
following questions: (1) How much do our mod-
els improve the generated poems? (Section 4.4)
(2) What are characteristics of the input vernacu-
lar paragraph that lead to a good generated poem?
(Section 4.5) (3) What are weaknesses of gener-
ated poems compared to human poems? (Section
4.6) To this end, we built a dataset as described in
Section 4.1. Evaluation metrics and baselines are
described in Section 4.2 and 4.3. For the imple-
mentation details of building the dataset and mod-
els, please refer to supplementary materials.1

4.1 Datasets

Training and Validation Sets We collected a cor-
pus of poems and a corpus of vernacular literature
from online resources. The poem corpus contains
163K quatrain poems from Tang Poems and Song
Poems, the vernacular literature corpus contains
337K short paragraphs from 281 famous books,
the corpus covers various literary forms including
prose, fiction and essay. Note that our poem cor-
pus and a vernacular corpus are not aligned. We
further split the two corpora into a training set and
a validation set.

1Our data and code is publicly available at
https://github.com/whaleloops/interpoetry

Test Set From online resources, we collected 487
seven-character quatrain poems from Tang Poems
and Song Poems, as well as their corresponding
high quality vernacular translations. These poems
could be used as gold standards for poems gener-
ated from their corresponding vernacular transla-
tions. Table 1 shows the statistics of our training,
validation and test set.

4.2 Evaluation Metrics

Perplexity Perplexity reflects the probability a
model generates a certain poem. Intuitively, a bet-
ter model would yield higher probability (lower
perplexity) on the gold poem.

BLEU As a standard evaluation metric for ma-
chine translation, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001)
measures the intersection of n-grams between the
generated poem and the gold poem. A better gen-
erated poem usually achieves higher BLEU score,
as it shares more n-gram with the gold poem.

Human evaluation While perplexity and BLEU
are objective metrics that could be applied to
large-volume test set, evaluating Chinese poems
is after all a subjective task. We invited 30 human
evaluators to join our human evaluation. The hu-
man evaluators were divided into two groups. The
expert group contains 15 people who hold a bach-
elor degree in Chinese literature, and the amateur
group contains 15 people who holds a bachelor de-
gree in other fields. All 30 human evaluators are
native Chinese speakers.

We ask evaluators to grade each generated poem
from four perspectives: 1) Fluency: Is the gen-
erated poem grammatically and rhythmically well
formed, 2) Semantic coherence: Is the generated
poem itself semantic coherent and meaningful,
3) Semantic preservability: Does the generated
poem preserve the semantic of the modern Chi-
nese translation, 4) Poeticness: Does the generated
poem display the characteristic of a poem and does
the poem build good poetic image. The grading
scale for each perspective is from 1 to 5.

4.3 Baselines

We compare the performance of the following
models: (1) LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhu-
ber, 1997); (2)Naive transformer (Vaswani et al.,
2017); (3)Transformer + Anti OT (RL loss);
(4)Transformer + Anti UT (phrase segmentation-
based padding); (5)Transformer + Anti OT&UT.

4.4 Reborn Poems: Generating Poems from
Vernacular Translations

As illustrated in Table 2 (ID 1). Given the vernac-
ular translation of each gold poem in test set, we
generate five poems using our models. Intuitively,
the more the generated poem resembles the gold
poem, the better the model is. We report mean
perplexity and BLEU scores in Table 3 (Where
+Anti OT refers to adding the reinforcement loss
to mitigate over-fitting and +Anti UT refers to
adding phrase segmentation-based padding to mit-
igate under-translation), human evaluation results

in Table 4.2

According to experiment results, perplexity,
BLEU scores and total scores in human evalu-
ation are consistent with each other. We ob-
serve all BLEU scores are fairly low, we be-
lieve it is reasonable as there could be multiple
ways to compose a poem given a vernacular para-
graph. Among transformer-based models, both
+Anti OT and +Anti UT outperforms the naive
transformer, while Anti OT&UT shows the best
performance, this demonstrates alleviating under-
translation and over-translation both helps gener-
ate better poems. Specifically, +Anti UT shows
bigger improvement than +Anti OT. According to
human evaluation, among the four perspectives,
our Anti OT&UT brought most score improve-
ment in Semantic preservability, this proves our
improvement on semantic preservability was most
obvious to human evaluators. All transformer-

formance is worse as shown in Table 3.

based models outperform LSTM. Note that the av-
erage length of the vernacular translation is over
70 characters, comparing with transformer-based
models, LSTM may only keep the information in
the beginning and end of the vernacular. We an-
ticipated some score inconsistency between expert
group and amateur group. However, after analyz-
ing human evaluation results, we did not observed
big divergence between two groups.

4.5 Interpoetry: Generating Poems from
Various Literature Forms

Chinese literature is not only featured for classi-
cal poems, but also various other literature forms.
Song lyric(宋词), or ci also gained tremendous
popularity in its palmy days, standing out in classi-
cal Chinese literature. Modern prose, modern po-
ems and pop song lyrics have won extensive praise
among Chinese people in modern days. The goal
of this experiment is to transfer texts of other lit-
erature forms into quatrain poems. We expect the
generated poems to not only keep the semantic of
the original text, but also demonstrate terseness,
rhythm and other characteristics of ancient poems.
Specifically, we chose 20 famous fragments from
four types of Chinese literature (5 fragments for
each of modern prose, modern poems, pop song
lyrics and Song lyrics). We try to As no ground
truth is available, we resorted to human evaluation
with the same grading standard in Section 4.4.

Comparing the scores of different literature
forms, we observe Song lyric achieves higher
scores than the other three forms of modern liter-
ature. It is not surprising as both Song lyric and

quatrain poems are written in classical Chinese,
while the other three literature forms are all in ver-
nacular.

Comparing the scores within the same litera-
ture form, we observe the scores of poems gener-
ated from different paragraphs tends to vary. After
carefully studying the generated poems as well as
their scores, we have the following observation:

1) In classical Chinese poems, poetic images
(意象) were widely used to express emotions and
to build artistic conception. A certain poetic image
usually has some fixed implications. For example,
autumn is usually used to imply sadness and lone-
liness. However, with the change of time, poetic
images and their implications have also changed.
According to our observation, if a vernacular para-
graph contains more poetic images used in classi-
cal literature, its generated poem usually achieves
higher score. As illustrated in Table 2, both para-
graph 2 and 3 are generated from pop song lyrics,
paragraph 2 uses many poetic images from clas-
sical literature (e.g. pear flowers, makeup), while
paragraph 3 uses modern poetic images (e.g. spar-
rows on the utility pole). Obviously, compared
with poem 2, sentences in poem 3 seems more
confusing, as the poetic images in modern times
may not fit well into the language model of classi-
cal poems.

2) We also observed that poems generated from
descriptive paragraphs achieve higher scores than
from logical or philosophical paragraphs. For ex-
ample, in Table 2, both paragraph 4 (more descrip-
tive) and paragraph 5 (more philosophical) were

selected from famous modern prose. However,
compared with poem 4, poem 5 seems semanti-
cally more confusing. We offer two explanations
to the above phenomenon: i. Limited by the 28-
character restriction, it is hard for quatrain poems
to cover complex logical or philosophical expla-
nation. ii. As vernacular paragraphs are more de-
tailed and lengthy, some information in a vernac-
ular paragraph may be lost when it is summarized
into a classical poem. While losing some infor-

descriptive paragraph, it could make a big differ-

4.6 Human Discrimination Test

We manually select 25 generated poems from ver-
nacular Chinese translations and pair each one
with its corresponding human written poem. We
then present the 25 pairs to human evaluators and
ask them to differentiate which poem is generated
by human poet.3

As demonstrated in Table 6, although the gen-
eral meanings in human poems and generated po-
ems seem to be the same, the wordings they em-
ploy are quite different. This explains the low
BLEU scores in Section 4.3. According to the test
results in Table 7, human evaluators only achieved
65.8% in mean accuracy. This indicates the best
generated poems are somewhat comparable to po-
ems written by amateur poets.

We interviewed evaluators who achieved higher
than 80% accuracy on their differentiation strate-
gies. Most interviewed evaluators state they real-
ize the sentences in a human written poem are usu-
ally well organized to highlight a theme or to build
a poetic image, while the correlation between sen-
tences in a generated poem does not seem strong.
As demonstrated in Table 6, the last two sen-
tences in both human poems (marked as red) echo
each other well, while the sentences in machine-

3We did not require the expert group’s participation as
many of them have known the gold poems already. Thus us-
ing their judgments would be unfair.

Human

黄沙碛里客行迷，四望云天直下低。
Within yellow sand moraine guest travels lost,

looking around found sky and clouds low.

however I need to travel more west than anxi.

绝域从军计惘然，东南幽恨满词笺。
It’s hard to pay for the ambition of the military field,
the anxiety of situation in southeast is all over poems.

一箫一剑平生意，负尽狂名十五年。
A flute and sword is all I care about in my life,

15 years have failed the reputation of ”madman”.

Machine

从军疆场志难酬，令人怅望东南州。
It’s hard to fulfill my ambition on the military field,
the situation in the southeast states are troublesome.

形容仗剑敌平戎，情怀注满赋雪愁。
I would like to use my sword to conquer my enemy,

yet my feelings are full of worry like the snow.

Table 6: Examples of generated poems and their cor-
responding gold poems used in human discrimination
test.

generated poems seem more independent. This
gives us hints on the weakness of generated po-
ems: While neural models may generate poems
that resemble human poems lexically and syntac-
tically, it’s still hard for them to compete with hu-
man beings in building up good structures.

5 Discussion

Addressing Under-Translation In this part, we
wish to explore the effect of different phrase seg-
mentation schemas on our phrase segmentation-
based padding. According to Ye (1984), most
seven-character quatrain poems adopt the 2-2-3
segmentation schema. As shown in examples in
Figure 3, we compare our phrase segmentation-
based padding (2-2-3 schema) to two less common
schemas (i.e. 2-3-2 and 3-2-2 schema) we report
our experiment results in Table 8.

The results show our 2-2-3 segmentation-
schema greatly outperforms 2-3-2 and 3-2-2
schema in both perplexity and BLEU scores. Note
that the BLEU scores of 2-3-2 and 3-2-2 schema
remains almost the same as our naive baseline
(Without padding). According to the observation,
we have the following conclusions: 1) Although
padding better aligns the vernacular paragraph to
the poem, it may not improve the quality of the
generated poem. 2) The padding tokens should
be placed according to the phrase segmentation
schema of the poem as it preserves the semantic
within the scope of each phrase.
Addressing Over-Translation To explore the ef-
fect of our reinforcement learning policy on al-
leviating over-translation, we calculate the rep-
etition ratio of vernacular paragraphs generated
from classical poems in our validation set. We
found naive transformer achieves 40.8% in rep-
etition ratio, while our +Anti OT achieves 34.9%.
Given the repetition ratio of vernacular paragraphs
(written by human beings) in our validation set
is 30.1%, the experiment results demonstrated
our RL loss effectively alleviate over-translation,
which in turn leads to better generated poems.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel task of gen-
erating classical Chinese poems from vernacular
paragraphs. We adapted the unsupervised machine
translation model to our task and meanwhile pro-
posed two novel approaches to address the under-
translation and over-translation problems. Experi-
ments show that our task can give users more con-
trollability in generating poems. In addition, our
approaches are very effective to solve the prob-

lems when the UMT model is directly used in this
task. In the future, we plan to explore: (1) Apply-
ing the UMT model in the tasks where the abstrac-
tion levels of source and target languages are dif-
ferent (e.g., unsupervised automatic summariza-
tion); (2) Improving the quality of generated po-
ems via better structure organization approaches.
