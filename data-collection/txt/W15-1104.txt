Abstract

In conversation, speakers tend to echo the lin-
guistic style of the person they are interact-
ing with. This paper contributes to a body of
work that addresses how this linguistic style
coordination is affected by the social context
in which the interaction occurs. In particu-
lar, we investigate the effect that an agent’s
social network centrality has on the coordina-
tion exhibited in replies to their utterances. We
find that linguistic coordination is positively
correlated with social network centrality and
that this effect is greater than previous results
showing a similar connection between status-
based power and linguistic coordination. We
conjecture that the social value of coordina-
tion may reside in the wish to conform to the
linguistic norms of a community.

1 Introduction

In communicative contexts, there is more to lan-
guage use than the individual processing of repre-
sentations. When two or more interlocutors take part
in a conversation, they engage in a joint activity —
a type of social interaction that requires an intricate
level of interpersonal coordination. This often leads
to interlocutors converging on similar patterns of
language use, including phonetic production (Kim
et al., 2011; Babel, 2012), lexical choice (Brennan,
1996), use of function words (Niederhoffer and Pen-
nebaker, 2002), and of syntactic constructions (Pick-
ering and Ferreira, 2008).

It is a matter of debate what mechanisms give rise
to the observed convergences and whether different
factors may simultaneously and complementarily be

at play. For instance, the “collaborative” approach
led by Clark (1996) considers that adaptation or en-
trainment is mainly motivated by the communicative
need to reach mutual understanding, which leads
to speakers reasoning about their common ground
(Clark and Murphy, 1982; Brennan and Clark, 1996;
Brennan and Hanna, 2009). In contrast, Picker-
ing and Garrod (2004) have argued that stimulus-
response priming is the key mechanism underlying
alignment of representations in conversation (Brani-
gan et al., 1995; Pickering and Garrod, 2006; Reit-
ter and Moore, 2014). Yet, within social psychology
researchers have emphasised the role of social pro-
cesses and goals as triggers of linguistic “imitation”
(Shepard et al., 2001; Giles, 2008; Babel, 2012).

In this paper, we contribute to this latter line of
research by investigating the effects of social fac-
tors on linguistic coordination. In particular, we ex-
ploit notions of network centrality from Social Net-
work Analysis (Wasserman, 1994) to study the ex-
tent to which an individual’s position in a social net-
work is connected to differences in linguistic adap-
tation observed within a community. We use online
discussions amongst Wikipedia1 editors as our case
study, leveraging a corpus compiled by Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012), who found that the
social status of editors (whether they have the role
of administrator) is relevant to explain the patterns
of linguistic coordination observed in this online
community. In the present study we show that net-
work centrality factors (which are largely implicit)
also bear on linguistic coordination in this scenario,
largely independently of explicit social status.

The paper proceeds as follows: In Sections 2
and 3, we introduce key notions related to socially-
driven linguistic coordination and social network
analysis, respectively, and review related work in
these areas. In Section 4, we put forward our work-
ing hypotheses. The experimental setup and the par-
ticular measures we use to test these hypotheses are
described in Section 5. In Section 6, we present our
results in detail. Finally, we conclude in Section 7
with a discussion of the implications of these results.

2 Socially-Driven Linguistic Coordination

The influence of social factors on how we linguisti-
cally communicate with each other has been studied,
amongst others, by sociologists working within the
framework of Conversation Analysis (Atkinson and
Drew, 1979; Heritage, 2005) and by social psychol-
ogists employing more quantitative approaches such
as Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles,
2008). CAT claims that linguistic adaptation is moti-
vated by individuals’ aim to be socially accepted and
to negotiate the social distance that separates them
from their interlocutors (increasing, maintaining, or
decreasing it). Such adaptation can take place at dif-
ferent levels: pitch, vocabulary, gestures, etc. (Giles
et al., 1991). An approach in this direction has been
put forward by Pennebaker and colleagues, who fo-
cus on style matching, in particular the matching of
function words such as pronouns, articles, and quan-
tifiers (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007). For instance,
it has been shown that function word matching in
speed dating conversations predicts relationship ini-
tiation and stability (Ireland et al., 2011) and that it
is indicative of relative social status between inter-
locutors (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002). An
advantage of focusing on function words is that their
choice is genuinely stylistic, i.e. not directly related
to the topic of the conversation and thus largely do-
main independent.

Linguistic style matching has been exploited by
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) to investi-
gate power differences in two domains: the com-
munity of Wikipedia editors and the U.S. Supreme
Court. The authors found that power differences be-
tween interlocutors bear upon the degree to which a
speaker echoes the linguistic style of the addressee
to whom they are responding. In the Wikipedia

domain (which is the most relevant for our own
study), it was observed that speakers tend to linguis-
tically coordinate more with editors who have the
role of administrator. Adminship confers a certain
authority since these editors can block user accounts
and protect or delete Wikipedia pages.2 Therefore
admins have a higher social status than other edi-
tors (non-admins), which endows them with status-
based power.

We examine the same corpus of textual conversa-
tional exchanges amongst Wikipedia editors, but in
addition to status-based power, we consider linguis-
tic style coordination in relation to an individual’s
position in a social network structure. In particu-
lar, we investigate the effect that a speaker’s network
centrality has on how much other individuals coor-
dinate with her linguistically.

3 Importance in Social Network Structure

A social network is a graph model of a community
where nodes represent individuals (of some kind)
and edges represent links between those individu-
als. Edges may be weighted to capture the strength
of certain links or directed to represent asymmetri-
cal relationships. Given a social network, one may
extract information about how important an individ-
ual is in the community. Importance is of course a
slippery notion. Which individuals are important de-
pends on what it means to be important in a particu-
lar community and how these criteria are encoded in
the network model. Network centrality is a family
of measures that attempt to capture importance by
assigning a numerical value to each node based on
its position in the network structure. We shall con-
sider two measures of network centrality, which will
be defined in Section 5.3.

High centrality might be seen as a source of power
(be it status-based or of some other kind), but this is
not always so. A case in point are exchange net-
works: An exchange network is one where social
relations involve the exchange of valued commodi-
ties, be they physical, like goods and services, or
less tangible, like affection or information. In such
networks, power often increases with access to non-
central individuals who have less choice in partners

for exchange. In such situations it may present a
power advantage not to be centrally located (Cook
et al., 1983). Regardless of whether importance cor-
responds to high or low centrality values in a partic-
ular social community, network centrality certainly
does not confer any institutionalised title or explicit
authority. For this reason we consider centrality as
related to implicit social power, to be considered in
parallel with status-based power.

The ease with which social network structure can
be extracted from online communities has made
network analysis of such communities a very ac-
tive method of research in different fields concerned
with social interaction at large, not necessarily with
language (Chakrabarti, 2003; Guha et al., 2004;
Leskovec et al., 2010). In sociolinguistics, however,
the effect of network structure on language had been
observed long before the prevalence of the Inter-
net. Sociolinguists have examined the relationship
between social network features and aspects of lin-
guistic variation and change to draw conclusions on
how the linguistic behaviour of individuals reflects
their membership in small-scale social clusters (Mil-
roy, 1987; Milroy and Milroy, 1997). For example,
Eckert (1988) considers the effects of the social net-
work of suburban Detroit area adolescents on their
susceptibility to phonological innovations. She ar-
gues that linguistic change can be better explained
by features of the social network than by unstruc-
tured demographic data and that alignment of lin-
guistic styles is an important factor in maintaining
acceptance in a rapidly developing social structure.

Thanks to the ubiquity of the Internet, it is now
possible to apply social network analysis techniques
to address sociolinguistic concerns to much larger
amounts of linguistic data than ever before. Here we
exploit this opportunity, in particular the availability
of interactional data from a rich online community
such as the Wikipedia editors. Although Wikipedia
has been used as a testbed to study the connection
between structural network properties and factors
such as contentious topics (Laniado et al., 2011),
quality improvement of Wikipedia articles (Kittur
and Kraut, 2008) or editing activity (Crandall et al.,
2008), to the best of our knowledge this is the first
study that investigates the links between social net-
work features of this community and linguistic style
coordination amongst its members.

4 Hypotheses

We investigate the following three hypotheses that
relate linguistic style coordination to the concept of
social network centrality:

H1. Speakers coordinate more towards individuals
that occupy more central social positions.

H2. Individuals in more central social network po-
sitions tend to possess status-based power.

H3. The effect hypothesized in H1 holds indepen-
dently of any effect observed in relation to H2.

While we are primarily interested in the relation-
ship between linguistic coordination and network
centrality, we do so in a context where something
is known about the status-based power born by in-
dividuals: We have access to the adminship role
of editors and editors themselves are aware of the
admin status of other users.3 We expect to find
that social network centrality correlates with status-
based power, i.e., that individuals at the centre stage
of the community are more likely to be admins
(H2). With this in mind, we would like to sepa-
rate the effect of status-based power on coordination
from that of implicit centrality-based power (H3).
Given that linguistic style coordination correlates
with status-based power (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al., 2012), it is not enough simply to show that
it also correlates with network centrality (H1) since
such a result may be wholly explained by status-
based power as a confounding factor.

5 Experimental Setup

In this section we describe the corpus used in our ex-
periments and define the measures of linguistic co-
ordination and network centrality that we compute
from the data.

5.1 Data

The Wikipedia Talk Page Conversations Corpus
consists of a collection of exchanges from Wikipedia
editors’ user talk pages. A talk page, as opposed to
a Wikipedia article, is a page for discussion between

3There is a symbol identifying admins as such on their
Wikipedia user page, although it is worth noting that no such
identifying marks are visible where discussions take place.

31



editors that is not part of the content of Wikipedia.
User talk pages, which are not associated with a
particular article, tend to feature more community-
oriented discussions.4

The corpus contains information on 26,397 users,
including whether or not the editor is a Wikipedia
administrator (an admin). There are 1,825 admins.
Each utterance (or post) is annotated with metadata
including the username of the editor who made the
post and which previous contribution it is a reply
to (if any). Of 391,294 total posts in the corpus,
we consider a subset of 342,800 that were made by
users whose admin status is known (i.e., by one of
the 26,397 for whom we have metadata). The corpus
was collected in August 2011 and made available by
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012).5

We derived a weighted network structure from the
corpus as follows: A node was created for each indi-
vidual. Undirected, weighted edges were formed be-
tween editors based on the number of direct replies
between them. An edge with weight w between user
a and user b indicates that w is the total number
of times user a replied to a post of user b or visa
versa. The edges in this model are intended to rep-
resent the degree to which two users know each other
(as members of the Wikipedia editors’ community).
The talk page is the locus of an editor’s involvement
in Wikipedia as a community. The rationale for our
edge definition is that a’s reply to b’s contribution is
directed at b as a member of the community. The
more that a and b reply to one another, the better
connected they are in the network.

The resulting network was pruned to its largest
connected component such that there is a path be-
tween every pair of nodes. Pruning eliminated 575
users from 556 different disconnected components
(mostly singletons). The final network consists of
25,822 nodes and 103,992 edges with an average
weight of 3.3.

5.2 Linguistic Coordination Measures

We want to measure how much participants align
their language with that of the interlocutors to whom
they are immediately replying. Following Danescu-

4http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:
Talk_page_guidelines

5http://www.cs.cornell.edu/˜cristian/Echoes_
of_power.html

Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012), we use the pres-
ence of a word in a particular category of func-
tion words as linguistic style markers. We con-
sider the same eight categories of functional mark-
ers as these authors: quantifiers, personal pronouns,
impersonal pronouns, articles, auxiliary verbs, con-
junctions, prepositions, and adverbs. However,
while Danescu-Niculeascu-Mizil and colleagues use
the markers provided by the commercial text analy-
sis software LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2007),6 we
compiled our own list of markers for each of these
eight categories using freely available frequency
lists of part-of-speech classes from the British Na-
tional Corpus (Burnard, 2000).7 We took the most
common words for each relevant POS (manually fil-
tering out any content words) to match the length
of the LIWC category lists reported in the software
documentation.8

Linguistic style coordination quantifies the degree
to which an agent b immediately echoes the linguis-
tic style of agent a. We use the linguistic style co-
ordination measure Cm(b, a) defined by Danescu-
Niculeascu-Mizil, et al. (2012), where the coordina-
tion of b (the speaker) towards a (the target) with re-
spect to a markerm encodes how much a’s use ofm
increases the probability that b will use that marker
in her reply to a, relative to the overall frequency of
m in b’s replies to a:9

Cm(b, a) = P (Emub | Emua)− P (Emub)
where Emu indicates that utterance u exhibits a
marker m and (ua, ub) belongs to the set of pairs
of utterances made by b in response to a. If none of
the utterances of a that b responds to exhibit m, then
Cm(b, a) is undefined.

We introduce a variant of this measure that con-
siders the coordination of a group of speakers B to-
wards an individual a by making the same calcula-
tion across all utterance pairs (ua, uB) where some
member of B is replying to individual a. When B

8The relevant LIWC documentation can be found at http:

//www.liwc.net/descriptiontable1.php. Our lists of
markers are freely available upon request.

9This ensures that Cm(b, a) captures the influence of a’s use
of marker m on b’s immediate reply. It may be that b uses m
more in general when speaking to a, but such an effect would
have no bearing on Cm(b, a).

32



is the set of all members of a social network who
have addressed a, we refer to Cm(B, a) as a’s coor-
dination received. This is the main measure we will
employ in the analyses reported in Section 6.

It is sometimes desirable to have a single score
that combines a’s coordination received across all
markers. This is made complicated by the fact
that coordination may be undefined for one or more
markers. Since we generally consider coordination
received by a in the context of a’s membership in
some groupA (e.g., admins), there are several differ-
ent aggregation schemes available. Again, we fol-
low Danescu-Niculeascu-Mizil et al. (2012) in the
naming and definition of these schemes, but apply
them to coordination received.

Aggregate 1 Take a simple average across mark-
ers, but only for those users a in A for whom
Cm(B, a) is defined for all markers. Otherwise
the aggregate is undefined for a.

Aggregate 2 Wherever Cm(B, a) is undefined,
substitute with the average ofCm(B, a′) across
those a′ in A for whom it is defined.

Aggregate 3 Whenever Cm(B, a) is undefined,
substitute with the average ofCm

′
(B, a) across

those m′ for which it is defined.

When taking an average aggregate coordination re-
ceived over a group of users A, aggregate 1 takes
into account only those users for whom all mea-
sures are defined. Aggregates 2 and 3 take into ac-
count all users for whom at least one measure is
defined, but exhibit slightly different smoothing as-
sumptions. Aggregate 2 assumes that people in B
would have behaved towards a with regard to m as
they did towards the rest of A, whereas aggregate 3
assumes that members of B would have behaved to-
wards a with regard to m as they did with regard to
the other markers.

5.3 Network Centrality Measures

As mentioned in Section 3, a network centrality
measure assigns a numerical value to each individ-
ual in the network based on features of their position
in the graph. This value is intended to represent the
importance of that individual in the social network.

What kind of importance it captures depends on ex-
actly how centrality is calculated. Here we consider
two well-known measures of network centrality.

Eigenvector centrality (Bonacich, 1987) tries to
capture the notion that your importance in a network
depends on the importance of your closest contacts.
Let M(n) be the neighborhood of n; that is, the
nodes in N that share an edge with n. Then the
Eigenvector centrality of n∗ is defined by

EC(n∗) =
1
λ

∑
n∈M(n∗)

EC(n)

where λ is a constant, the eigenvalue. There may
be multiple values of λ for which the Eigenvector
centrality is defined, but taking the largest value pro-
vides a consistent measure across the network.

Betweenness centrality (Freeman, 1977) mea-
sures how much a node contributes to the over-
all connectivity of the network. Nodes who lie on
more shortest paths between pairs of other nodes
have higher Betweenness centrality. Specifically it
looks at all of the shortest paths between each pair
of nodes, and counts how many of them contain the
node in question. Letting Path(m,n) stand for the
set of shortest paths between m and n, the Between-
ness centrality of n∗ is defined by:

BC(n∗) =
∑

n6=m∈N

|{σ ∈ Path(m,n)|n∗ ∈ σ}|
|Path(m,n)|

Both Eigenvector and Betweenness centrality mea-
sures have generalizations for weighted networks
which we use here. For Betweenness, path length is
calculated using the inverse weight of edges (so that
paths along edges with higher weights are consid-
ered shorter). For Eigenvector centrality, the notion
of “neighbour” is adjusted so that adjacent nodes
connected with a higher weight count for more. We
use the implementation of these algorithms avail-
able in the Python library NetworkX (Hagberg et al.,
2008).10

6 Analyses and Results

To investigate our hypotheses regarding the impact
of social network position on linguistic coordina-
tion, we computed scores for all the measures in-

troduced in the previous section (coordination re-
ceived, Eigenvector and Betweenness centrality) for
each individual in the social network. Table 1 pro-
vides some basic descriptive statistics.

6.1 Coordination and Status-Based Power
We start by replicating the relevant result by
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012), according to
which Wikipedia editors coordinate more towards
admins than non-admins. We compare the average
linguistic coordination received by each of these two
social groups for each functional marker as well as
for each of the aggregate measures. The results are
shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, in all cases in-
dividuals coordinate significantly more towards ad-
min addressees than towards non-admins (indepen-
dent Welch two sample t-test, p < 0.001). We are
thus able to reproduce this basic result despite the
fact that we use a self-compiled list of functional
markers instead of the full power of the LIWC tool
(Pennebaker et al., 2007). The results we obtain
are in fact stronger, since we observe high levels of
significance for all aggregate measures and markers
while Danescu-Nicolescu-Mizil and colleagues ob-
tained significant results only for the aggregate mea-
sures and for conjunctions, indefinite pronouns, ad-
verbs and articles. We point out however that re-
gardless of the high significance values across the
board, the size of the effect is larger for the aggre-
gate measures (average Cohen’s d = 0.2) than for
any of the individual markers (for which the effect
size is in fact very small: on average d < 0.15).11

6.2 Coordination and Centrality
We now turn to investigate each of the hypotheses
formulated in Section 4. Our data provide evidence

11Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012) do not report effect
size and hence a more detailed comparison is not possible.

in support of H1 (speakers coordinate more towards
individuals that occupy more central social posi-
tions). As shown in Table 2, we find significant (al-
beit weak) positive correlations in all cases between
the level of coordination received by an individual a
(Cm(B, a)) and a’s position in the social network,
as quantified by Eigenvector and Betweenness cen-
trality scores.12 Betweenness centrality correlates
slightly better with coordination received.

We consider an individual highly central with re-
spect to some centrality measure if this individual’s
centrality score is higher than one standard devia-
tion above the mean score. Given the large amount
of variation in our dataset (see Table 1), this is a
very selective criterion: Out of 25,822 editors, only
119 (∼0.5%) are highly Eigenvector-central and 239
(∼0.9%) are highly Betweenness-central. We ob-
serve that speakers coordinate more with individu-

als that are highly central, significantly so for most
of the aggregate measures, pronouns and quantifiers
(independent Welch two sample t-test; see Figure 2).
The average effect size for the aggregate measures is
d = 0.32 for Eigenvector centrality and d = 0.35 for
Betweenness centrality.

Regarding H2 (individuals in more central so-
cial network positions tend to possess status-based
power), in our dataset only 29% of editors who are
highly Eigenvector-central are also admins. The
percentage goes up to 53% in the case of highly
Betweenness-central editors. Editors with admin
status make up around 45% of those individuals who
are highly central according to at least one mea-
sure (319 editors) and around 49% of those who are
highly central according to both measures (39 edi-
tors). To further investigate the connection between
status-based power as represented by adminship and
network centrality, we examined the mean central-
ity scores of admin versus non-admin editors. We
find that on average admins are more centrally po-
sitioned in the network than non-admins. An inde-
pendent Welch t-test confirms that this is significant
for both Eigenvector centrality (p < 0.5, Cohen’s
d = 0.07) and Betweenness centrality (p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.22), although the effect is practically
nonexistent for the former centrality measure. Thus,
H2 is only relatively supported, with Betweenness
centrality exhibiting a closer connection with admin-
ship than Eigenvector centrality.

Finally, to assess H3 (the effect hypothesized in
H1 holds independently of any effect observed in re-

lation to H2), we compared the average coordination
received scores for admins and non-admins within
each class of highly central users. Our aim was to
check whether users coordinate more towards edi-
tors who are both administrators and highly central
in the social network. As shown in Figure 3 (left),
no effects of adminship were found (for all mark-
ers and aggregate measures, p > 0.05 in an inde-
pendent Welch t-test), which provides evidence sup-
porting the hypothesis. Analogous calculations were
made for users who are not highly central (Figure 3,
right). Amongst these, significant differences were
found (albeit with small effect sizes: 0.16 < d < 0.2
across the board for both centrality measures), with
admins receiving more linguistic coordination for all
markers and aggregate measures.13

7 Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper we have put forward the hypothesis that
speakers coordinate more with targets who occupy a
more central position in the social context in which
the communication takes place. We have provided
evidence for this claim by measuring linguistic style
coordination in the Wikipedia talk pages corpus.

We confirmed the result by Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil et al. (2012) that correlates coordination with
explicit status-based power represented by admin-
ship, and went on to show that there is a further pos-
itive relationship between how much linguistic style
coordination an editor receives and her network cen-
trality. Furthermore, while editors coordinate more
with admins in general, we found that adminship
has no significant effect on how much coordination
highly central editors receive. We may conclude
that in certain situations, considerations of network
centrality trump explicit status-based power in de-
termining how much a speaker immediately aligns
with the person to whom she is responding.

This conclusion provides evidence for the claim
of Communication Accommodation Theory accord-
ing to which linguistic adaptation is motivated by
the desire for social acceptance (Giles, 2008). Ex-
actly how aligning with highly central members of

13We chose this analysis over a regression analysis because
the data violates the normality assumption and is affected by
very severe heteroscedasticity, i.e., the variance in the error is
not constant, with very large residuals when the centrality mea-
sures are low and much smaller ones as they increase.

Figure 3: Linguistic style coordination towards admins/non-admins among users with high (left) and low (right)
Eigenvector/Betweenness centrality.

the community achieves this goal is open to some
interpretation, though it is likely that there is more
than one mechanism at play. We consider two pos-
sibilities.

First, aligning with highly central community
members can be seen as an instance of aligning to
power, since network centrality (especially Eigen-
vector centrality) is often used as a proxy for im-
plicit social power. Aligning with highly central
members helps to achieve social acceptance since
those with implicit social power have more power to
grant it. This interpretation is supported by our re-
sults: Just as coordination more closely follows net-
work centrality than it does adminship, it is natural
to assume that the power to confer social acceptance
more closely follows implicit social power than it
does any official title.

The second possible interpretation has more ex-
pressly linguistic motivations. It has been observed
that those in central social positions make more ut-
terances characteristic of the group they are central
to (Eckert, 1988; Kooti et al., 2012). Since learn-
ing the linguistic practices of a community is impor-
tant to social acceptance, it is beneficial to coordi-
nate with highly central members of the community
as a way of picking up those linguistic practices. In
other words, coordination towards a highly central
individual may have a social goal that does not have
anything to do with that individual in particular, but
rather with adapting to the linguistic norms of the
community at large.

Although Eigenvector centrality is most closely
associated with implicit power (Bonacich, 1987), we

found that in the Wikipedia corpus it is actually Be-
tweenness centrality that correlates somewhat more
strongly with coordination. This may have some-
thing to say about the relationship between the two
mechanisms mentioned above. While it may still
be true that people align to power for the immedi-
ate social benefit, the greater effect of Betweenness
centrality suggests that the social benefit of coordi-
nation may be mediated by something more than the
power of the individual who is being responded to.
One possible explanation is that community mem-
bers who are more vital to the connectivity of the
social network (i.e., those with high Betweenness
centrality) tend to conform better with the linguistic
norms of the community as a whole (rather than, for
example, to the norms of some clique or subgroup).
Assuming that some of the social motivations for
alignment are expressly linguistic, this would ex-
plain why Betweenness centrality correlates better
with coordination received than the centrality mea-
sure more typically associated with social power.
More research is needed to determine whether (a)
community members with high Betweenness cen-
trality better represent the linguistic norms of the
community and (b) immediate linguistic coordina-
tion is the mechanism by which those norms are
propagated.

The results of this paper are suggestive in both
those regards, while providing good evidence that,
at the very least, network centrality is a more impor-
tant factor in linguistic coordination than is formal
status-based power.
