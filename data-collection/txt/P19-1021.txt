Abstract

It has been shown that the performance of neu-
ral machine translation (NMT) drops starkly
in low-resource conditions, underperforming
phrase-based statistical machine translation
(PBSMT) and requiring large amounts of aux-
iliary data to achieve competitive results. In
this paper, we re-assess the validity of these
results, arguing that they are the result of lack
of system adaptation to low-resource settings.
We discuss some pitfalls to be aware of when
training low-resource NMT systems, and re-
cent techniques that have shown to be espe-
cially helpful in low-resource settings, result-
ing in a set of best practices for low-resource
NMT. In our experiments on German–English
with different amounts of IWSLT14 training
data, we show that, without the use of any aux-
iliary monolingual or multilingual data, an op-
timized NMT system can outperform PBSMT
with far less data than previously claimed. We
also apply these techniques to a low-resource
Korean–English dataset, surpassing previously
reported results by 4 BLEU.

1 Introduction

While neural machine translation (NMT) has
achieved impressive performance in high-resource
data conditions, becoming dominant in the field
(Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015;
Vaswani et al., 2017), recent research has ar-
gued that these models are highly data-inefficient,
and underperform phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (PBSMT) or unsupervised meth-
ods in low-data conditions (Koehn and Knowles,
2017; Lample et al., 2018b). In this paper, we
re-assess the validity of these results, arguing that
they are the result of lack of system adaptation to
low-resource settings. Our main contributions are
as follows:

Figure 3: BLEU scores for English-Spanish sys-
tems trained on 0.4 million to 385.7 million
words of parallel data. Quality for NMT starts
much lower, outperforms SMT at about 15 mil-
lion words, and even beats a SMT system with a
big 2 billion word in-domain language model un-
der high-resource conditions.

How do the data needs of SMT and NMT com-
pare? NMT promises both to generalize better (ex-
ploiting word similary in embeddings) and condi-
tion on larger context (entire input and all prior
output words).

We built English-Spanish systems on WMT
data,7 about 385.7 million English words paired
with Spanish. To obtain a learning curve, we used

1
1024 ,

1
512 , ...,

2 , and all of the data. For SMT, the

language model was trained on the Spanish part of
each subset, respectively. In addition to a NMT
and SMT system trained on each subset, we also
used all additionally provided monolingual data
for a big language model in contrastive SMT sys-
tems.

Results are shown in Figure 3. NMT ex-
hibits a much steeper learning curve, starting with
abysmal results (BLEU score of 1.6 vs. 16.4 for

1
1024 of the data), outperforming SMT 25.7 vs.
24.7 with 116 of the data (24.1 million words), and
even beating the SMT system with a big language
model with the full data set (31.1 for NMT, 28.4
for SMT, 30.4 for SMT+BigLM).

the test set using NMT system trained on varying
amounts of training data. Under low resource con-
ditions, NMT produces fluent output unrelated to
the input.

The contrast between the NMT and SMT learn-
ing curves is quite striking. While NMT is able to
exploit increasing amounts of training data more
effectively, it is unable to get off the ground with
training corpus sizes of a few million words or
less.

To illustrate this, see Figure 4. With 11024 of the
training data, the output is completely unrelated to
the input, some key words are properly translated
with 1512 and

1
256 of the data (estrategia for strat-

egy, elección or elecciones for election), and start-
ing with 164 the translations become respectable.

3.3 Rare Words

Conventional wisdom states that neural machine
translation models perform particularly poorly on
rare words, (Luong et al., 2015; Sennrich et al.,
2016b; Arthur et al., 2016) due in part to the
smaller vocabularies used by NMT systems. We
examine this claim by comparing performance on
rare word translation between NMT and SMT
systems of similar quality for German–English
and find that NMT systems actually outperform
SMT systems on translation of very infrequent
words. However, both NMT and SMT systems
do continue to have difficulty translating some
infrequent words, particularly those belonging to
highly-inflected categories.

For the neural machine translation model, we
use a publicly available model8 with the training
settings of Edinburgh’s WMT submission (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016a). This was trained using Ne-

tion studies.

SMT in different data conditions, showing
that when following our best practices, NMT

words of parallel training data.

2 Related Work

2.1 Low-Resource Translation Quality
Compared Across Systems

Figure 1 reproduces a plot by Koehn and Knowles
(2017) which shows that their NMT system only
outperforms their PBSMT system when more than
100 million words (approx. 5 million sentences) of
parallel training data are available. Results shown
by Lample et al. (2018b) are similar, showing that
unsupervised NMT outperforms supervised sys-
tems if few parallel resources are available. In
both papers, NMT systems are trained with hyper-
parameters that are typical for high-resource set-



212

tings, and the authors did not tune hyperparame-
ters, or change network architectures, to optimize
NMT for low-resource conditions.

2.2 Improving Low-Resource Neural
Machine Translation

The bulk of research on low-resource NMT has
focused on exploiting monolingual data, or par-
allel data involving other language pairs. Meth-
ods to improve NMT with monolingual data range
from the integration of a separately trained lan-
guage model (Gülçehre et al., 2015) to the train-
ing of parts of the NMT model with additional ob-
jectives, including a language modelling objective
(Gülçehre et al., 2015; Sennrich et al., 2016b; Ra-
machandran et al., 2017), an autoencoding objec-
tive (Luong et al., 2016; Currey et al., 2017), or
a round-trip objective, where the model is trained
to predict monolingual (target-side) training data
that has been back-translated into the source lan-
guage (Sennrich et al., 2016b; He et al., 2016;
Cheng et al., 2016). As an extreme case, mod-
els that rely exclusively on monolingual data have
been shown to work (Artetxe et al., 2018b; Lample
et al., 2018a; Artetxe et al., 2018a; Lample et al.,
2018b). Similarly, parallel data from other lan-
guage pairs can be used to pre-train the network
or jointly learn representations (Zoph et al., 2016;
Chen et al., 2017; Nguyen and Chiang, 2017; Neu-
big and Hu, 2018; Gu et al., 2018a,b; Kocmi and
Bojar, 2018).

While semi-supervised and unsupervised ap-
proaches have been shown to be very effective for
some language pairs, their effectiveness depends
on the availability of large amounts of suitable
auxiliary data, and other conditions being met. For
example, the effectiveness of unsupervised meth-
ods is impaired when languages are morphologi-
cally different, or when training domains do not
match (Søgaard et al., 2018)

More broadly, this line of research still accepts
the premise that NMT models are data-inefficient
and require large amounts of auxiliary data to
train. In this work, we want to re-visit this point,
and will focus on techniques to make more ef-
ficient use of small amounts of parallel training
data. Low-resource NMT without auxiliary data
has received less attention; work in this direction
includes (Östling and Tiedemann, 2017; Nguyen
and Chiang, 2018).

3 Methods for Low-Resource Neural
Machine Translation

3.1 Mainstream Improvements
We consider the hyperparameters used by Koehn
and Knowles (2017) to be our baseline. This base-
line does not make use of various advances in
NMT architectures and training tricks. In contrast
to the baseline, we use a BiDeep RNN architec-
ture (Miceli Barone et al., 2017), label smoothing
(Szegedy et al., 2016), dropout (Srivastava et al.,
2014), word dropout (Sennrich et al., 2016a), layer
normalization (Ba et al., 2016) and tied embed-
dings (Press and Wolf, 2017).

3.2 Language Representation
Subword representations such as BPE (Sennrich
et al., 2016c) have become a popular choice to
achieve open-vocabulary translation. BPE has one
hyperparameter, the number of merge operations,
which determines the size of the final vocabulary.
For high-resource settings, the effect of vocabu-
lary size on translation quality is relatively small;
Haddow et al. (2018) report mixed results when
comparing vocabularies of 30k and 90k subwords.

In low-resource settings, large vocabularies re-
sult in low-frequency (sub)words being repre-
sented as atomic units at training time, and the
ability to learn good high-dimensional representa-
tions of these is doubtful. Sennrich et al. (2017a)
propose a minimum frequency threshold for sub-
word units, and splitting any less frequent subword
into smaller units or characters. We expect that
such a threshold reduces the need to carefully tune
the vocabulary size to the dataset, leading to more
aggressive segmentation on smaller datasets.1

3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
Due to long training times, hyperparameters are
hard to optimize by grid search, and are of-
ten re-used across experiments. However, best
practices differ between high-resource and low-
resource settings. While the trend in high-resource
settings is towards using larger and deeper mod-
els, Nguyen and Chiang (2018) use smaller and
fewer layers for smaller datasets. Previous work
has argued for larger batch sizes in NMT (Mor-
ishita et al., 2017; Neishi et al., 2017), but we

1In related work, Cherry et al. (2018) have shown that,
given deep encoders and decoders, character-level models
can outperform other subword segmentations. In preliminary
experiments, a character-level model performed poorly in our
low-resource setting.



213

find that using smaller batches is beneficial in low-
resource settings. More aggressive dropout, in-
cluding dropping whole words at random (Gal and
Ghahramani, 2016), is also likely to be more im-
portant. We report results on a narrow hyperpa-
rameter search guided by previous work and our
own intuition.

3.4 Lexical Model
Finally, we implement and test the lexical model
by Nguyen and Chiang (2018), which has been
shown to be beneficial in low-data conditions. The
core idea is to train a simple feed-forward net-
work, the lexical model, jointly with the original
attentional NMT model. The input of the lexical
model at time step t is the weighted average of
source embeddings f (the attention weights a are
shared with the main model). After a feedforward
layer (with skip connection), the lexical model’s
output hlt is combined with the original model’s
hidden state hot before softmax computation.

Our implementation adds dropout and layer nor-
malization to the lexical model.2

4 Experiments

4.1 Data and Preprocessing
We use the TED data from the IWSLT 2014
German→English shared translation task (Cettolo
et al., 2014). We use the same data cleanup and
train/dev split as Ranzato et al. (2016), resulting
in 159 000 parallel sentences of training data, and
7584 for development.

As a second language pair, we evaluate our sys-
tems on a Korean–English dataset3 with around
90 000 parallel sentences of training data, 1000 for
development, and 2000 for testing.

For both PBSMT and NMT, we apply the same
tokenization and truecasing using Moses scripts.
For NMT, we also learn BPE subword segmen-
tation with 30 000 merge operations, shared be-
tween German and English, and independently for
Korean→English.

and for KO→EN data.

To simulate different amounts of training re-
sources, we randomly subsample the IWSLT train-
ing corpus 5 times, discarding half of the data at
each step. Truecaser and BPE segmentation are
learned on the full training corpus; as one of our
experiments, we set the frequency threshold for
subword units to 10 in each subcorpus (see 3.2).
Table 1 shows statistics for each subcorpus, in-
cluding the subword vocabulary.

Translation outputs are detruecased, detok-
enized, and compared against the reference with
cased BLEU using sacreBLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002; Post, 2018).4 Like Ranzato et al. (2016),
we report BLEU on the concatenated dev sets for
IWSLT 2014 (tst2010, tst2011, tst2012, dev2010,
dev2012).

4.2 PBSMT Baseline

We use Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to train a
PBSMT system. We use MGIZA (Gao and Vo-
gel, 2008) to train word alignments, and lmplz
(Heafield et al., 2013) for a 5-gram LM. Feature
weights are optimized on the dev set to maxi-
mize BLEU with batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster,
2012) – we perform multiple runs where indicated.
Unlike Koehn and Knowles (2017), we do not use
extra data for the LM. Both PBSMT and NMT can
benefit from monolingual data, so the availability
of monolingual data is no longer an exclusive ad-
vantage of PBSMT (see 2.2).

4.3 NMT Systems

We train neural systems with Nematus (Sennrich
et al., 2017b). Our baseline mostly follows the
settings in (Koehn and Knowles, 2017); we use
adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) and perform early
stopping based on dev set BLEU. We express our
batch size in number of tokens, and set it to 4000
in the baseline (comparable to a batch size of 80
sentences used in previous work).

We subsequently add the methods described in
section 3, namely the bideep RNN, label smooth-
ing, dropout, tied embeddings, layer normaliza-
tion, changes to the BPE vocabulary size, batch

size, model depth, regularization parameters and
learning rate. Detailed hyperparameters are re-
ported in Appendix A.

5 Results

Table 2 shows the effect of adding different meth-
ods to the baseline NMT system, on the ultra-low
data condition (100k words of training data) and
the full IWSLT 14 training corpus (3.2M words).
Our ”mainstream improvements” add around 6–7
BLEU in both data conditions.

In the ultra-low data condition, reducing the
BPE vocabulary size is very effective (+4.9
BLEU). Reducing the batch size to 1000 token re-
sults in a BLEU gain of 0.3, and the lexical model
yields an additional +0.6 BLEU. However, ag-
gressive (word) dropout6 (+3.4 BLEU) and tuning
other hyperparameters (+0.7 BLEU) has a stronger
effect than the lexical model, and adding the lex-
ical model (9) on top of the optimized config-
uration (8) does not improve performance. To-
gether, the adaptations to the ultra-low data setting
yield 9.4 BLEU (7.2→16.6). The model trained
on full IWSLT data is less sensitive to our changes
(31.9→32.8 BLEU), and optimal hyperparameters
differ depending on the data condition. Subse-
quently, we still apply the hyperparameters that
were optimized to the ultra-low data condition (8)

simplicity.

For a comparison with PBSMT, and across
different data settings, consider Figure 2, which
shows the result of PBSMT, our NMT baseline,
and our optimized NMT system. Our NMT base-
line still performs worse than the PBSMT system
for 3.2M words of training data, which is con-
sistent with the results by Koehn and Knowles
(2017). However, our optimized NMT system
shows strong improvements, and outperforms the
PBSMT system across all data settings. Some
sample translations are shown in Appendix B.

For comparison to previous work, we report
lowercased and tokenized results on the full
IWSLT 14 training set in Table 3. Our results
far outperform the RNN-based results reported by
Wiseman and Rush (2016), and are on par with the
best reported results on this dataset.

Table 4 shows results for Korean→English,
using the same configurations (1, 2 and 8) as
for German–English. Our results confirm that
the techniques we apply are successful across
datasets, and result in stronger systems than pre-
viously reported on this dataset, achieving 10.37

BLEU as compared to 5.97 BLEU reported by Gu
et al. (2018b).

6 Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that NMT is in fact a suit-
able choice in low-data settings, and can outper-
form PBSMT with far less parallel training data
than previously claimed. Recently, the main trend
in low-resource MT research has been the bet-
ter exploitation of monolingual and multilingual
resources. Our results show that low-resource
NMT is very sensitive to hyperparameters such
as BPE vocabulary size, word dropout, and oth-
ers, and by following a set of best practices, we
can train competitive NMT systems without re-
lying on auxiliary resources. This has practical
relevance for languages where large amounts of
monolingual data, or multilingual data involving
related languages, are not available. Even though
we focused on only using parallel data, our re-
sults are also relevant for work on using auxiliary
data to improve low-resource MT. Supervised sys-
tems serve as an important baseline to judge the ef-
fectiveness of semisupervised or unsupervised ap-
proaches, and the quality of supervised systems
trained on little data can directly impact semi-
supervised workflows, for instance for the back-
translation of monolingual data.

A Hyperparameters

Table 5 lists hyperparameters used for the different
experiments in the ablation study (Table 2). Hy-
perparameters were kept constant across different
data settings, except for the validation interval and
subword vocabulary size (see Table 1).

B Sample Translations

Table 6 shows some sample translations that rep-
resent typical errors of our PBSMT and NMT
systems, trained with ultra-low (100k words) and
low (3.2M words) amounts of data. For unknown
words such as blutbefleckten (‘bloodstained’) or
Spaniern (‘Spaniards’, ‘Spanish’), PBSMT sys-
tems default to copying, while NMT systems pro-
duce translations on a subword-level, with vary-
ing success (blue-flect, bleed; spaniers, Spani-
ans). NMT systems learn some syntactic dis-
ambiguation even with very little data, for ex-
ample the translation of das and die as relative
pronouns (’that’, ’which’, ’who’), while PBSMT
produces less grammatical translation. On the
flip side, the ultra low-resource NMT system ig-
nores some unknown words in favour of a more-
or-less fluent, but semantically inadequate trans-
lation: erobert (’conquered’) is translated into
doing, and richtig aufgezeichnet (’registered cor-
rectly’, ‘recorded correctly’) into really the first
thing.
