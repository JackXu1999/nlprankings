Abstract

We describe the system entered by the
National Research Council Canada in
the SemEval-2014 L2 writing assistant
task. Our system relies on a standard
Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion trained on generic, publicly available
data. Translations are produced by taking
the already translated part of the sentence
as fixed context. We show that translation
systems can address the L2 writing assis-
tant task, reaching out-of-five word-based
accuracy above 80 percent for 3 out of 4
language pairs. We also present a brief
analysis of remaining errors.

1 Introduction

The Semeval L2 writing assistant task simulates
the situation of an L2 language learner trying to
translate a L1 fragment in a L2 context. This is
clearly motivated by a L2 language learning sce-
nario.

However, a very similar scenario can be en-
countered in Computer-Aided Translation. Trans-
lation memories retrieve from a large corpus of al-
ready translated documents the source segments
that best match a new sentence to be translated.
If an exact source match is found, the correspond-
ing target translation can be expected to be suit-
able with little or no post-editing. However, when
only approximate matches are found, post-editing
will typically be required to adapt the target side
of the partially matching source segment to the
source sentence under consideration. It is possible
to automate this process: standard string matching
algorithms and word alignment techniques can be
used to locate the parts of the source segment that
do not match the sentence to translate, and from

there the parts of the target segment that need to
be modified (Biçici and Dymetman, 2008; Simard
and Isabelle, 2009; Koehn and Senellart, 2010).
The task of translating a L1 fragment in L2 con-
text therefore has much broader application than
language learning. This motivation also provides
a clear link of this task to the Machine Translation
setting. There are also connections to the code-
switching and mixed language translation prob-
lems (Fung et al., 1999).

In our work, we therefore investigate the use
of a standard Phrase-Based Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) system to translate L1 frag-
ments in L2 context. In the next section, we de-
scribe the SMT system that we used in our submis-
sion. We then describe the corpora used to train
the SMT engine (Section 3), and our results on the
trial and test data, as well as a short error analysis
(Section 4).

section

2 System Description

The core Machine Translation engine used for all
our submissions is Portage (Larkin et al., 2010),
the NRC’s phrase-based SMT system. Given a
suitably trained SMT system, the Task 5 input is
processed as follows. For each sentence with an
L1 fragment to translate, the already translated
parts are set as left and right context. The L1 frag-
ment in L2 context is sent to the decoder. The
output is a full sentence translation that ensures 1)
that the context is left untouched, and 2) that the
L1 fragment is translated in a way that fits with the
L2 context.

We now describe the key components of the MT
system (language, translation and reordering mod-
els), as well as the decoding and parameter tuning.

Translation Models We use a single static
phrase table including phrase pairs extracted from
the symmetrized HMM word-alignment learned

192



on the entire training data. The phrase table con-
tains four features per phrase pair: lexical esti-
mates of the forward and backward probabilities
obtained either by relative frequencies or using the
method of Zens and Ney (2004). These estimates
are derived by summing counts over all possible
alignments. This yields four corresponding pa-
rameters in the log-linear model.

Reordering Models We use standard reorder-
ing models: a distance-based distortion feature, as
well as a lexicalized distortion model (Tillmann,
2004; Koehn et al., 2005). For each phrase pair,
the orientation counts required for the lexicalized
distortion model are computed using HMM word-
alignment on the full training corpora. We esti-
mate lexicalized probabilities for monotone, swap,
and discontinuous ordering with respect to the pre-
vious and following target phrase. This results in
a total of 6 feature values per phrase pair, in addi-
tion to the distance-based distortion feature, hence
seven parameters to tune in the log-linear model.

Language Models When translating L1 frag-
ments in L2 context, the L2 language model (LM)
is particularly important as it is the only compo-
nent of the SMT system that scores how well the
translation of the L1 fragment fits in the existing
L2 context. We test two different LM configura-
tions. The first of these (run1) uses a single static
LM: a standard 4-gram, estimated using Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995) on the tar-
get side of the bilingual corpora used for training
the translation models. In the second configuration
(run2), in order to further adapt the translations to
the test domain, a smaller LM trained on the L2
contexts of the test data is combined to the train-
ing corpus LM in a linear mixture model (Foster
and Kuhn, 2007). The linear mixture weights are
estimated on the L2 context of each test set in a
cross-validation fashion.

Decoding Algorithm and Parameter Tuning
Decoding uses the cube-pruning algorithm (Huang
and Chiang, 2007) with a 7-word distortion limit.
Log-linear parameter tuning is performed using a
lattice-based batch version of MIRA (Cherry and
Foster, 2012).

3 Data

SMT systems require large amounts of data to
estimate model parameters. In addition, transla-
tion performance largely depends on having in-

domain data to train on. As we had no informa-
tion on the domain of the test data for Task 5, we
chose to rely on general purpose publicly avail-
able data. Our main corpus is Europarl (Koehn,
2005), which is available for all 4 language pairs
of the evaluation. As Europarl covers parliamen-
tary proceedings, we added some news and com-
mentary (henceforth ”News”) data provided for
the 2013 workshop on Machine Translation shared
task (Bojar et al., 2013) for language pairs other
than nl-en. In all cases, we extracted from the cor-
pus a tuning (“dev”) set of around 2000 sentence
pairs. Statistics for the training data are given in
Table 1.

The trial and test data each consist of 500 sen-
tences with L1 fragments in L2 context provided
by the organizers. As the trial data came from Eu-
roparl, we filtered our training corpora in order to
remove close matches and avoid training on the
trial data (Table 1 takes this into account).

All translation systems were trained on lower-
cased data, and predictions were recased using a
standard (LM-based) truecasing approach.

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Results on Trial and Simulated Data
Our first evaluation was performed on the trial data
provided by the Task 5 organizers. Each example
was translated in context by two systems:

run1: Baseline, non-adapted system (marked 1
below);

run2: Linear LM mixture adaptation, using a
context LM (marked 2 below).

Table 2 shows that our run1 system already
yields high performance on the trial data, while

uation script: (W)ord and (F)ragment accuracy at

adapting the language model on the L2 contexts
in run2 provides a clear gain in the top-1 results.
That improvement all but disappears when taking
into account the best out of five translations (ex-
cept maybe for nl-en). The BLEU scores1 are
very high (97-98) and the word error rates (not
reported) are around 1%, suggesting that the sys-
tem output almost matches the references. This
is no doubt due to the proximity between the trial
data and the MT training corpus. Both are fully or
mainly drawn from Europarl material.

In order to get a less optimistic estimate of per-
formance, we automatically constructed a num-
ber of test examples from the WMT News Com-
mentary development test sets. The L1 source
segments and their L2 reference translations were
word aligned in both directions using the GIZA++
implementation of IBM4 (Och and Ney, 2003)
and the grow-diag-final-and combination heuris-
tic (Koehn et al., 2005). Test instances were cre-
ated by substituting some L2 fragments with their
word-aligned L1 source within L2 reference seg-
ments. Since the goal was to select examples that
were more ambiguous and harder to translate than
the trial data, a subset of interesting L1 phrases
was randomly selected among phrases that oc-
cured at least 4 times in the training corpus and
have a high entropy in the baseline phrase-table.
We selected roughly 1000 L1 phrases per language
pair. For each occurrence p1 of these L1 phrases in
the news development sets, we identify the short-
est L2 phrase p2 that is consistently aligned with

p1.2 A new mixed language test example is con-
structed by replacing p2 with p1 in L2 context.

Results on that simulated data are given in Ta-
ble 3. Performance is markedly lower than on the
trial data. This is due in part to the fact that the
News data is not as close to the training material
as the official trial set, and in part to the fact that
this automatically extracted data contains imper-
fect alignments with an unknown (but sizeable)
amount of “noise”. However, it still appears run2
consistently provides several points of increase in
performance for the top-1 results, over the base-
line run1. Performance on the 5-best is either un-
affected or lower, and the gain in BLEU is much
lower than in Table 2 although the resulting BLEU
is around 96%.

4.2 Test Results
Official test results provided by the organizers
are presented in Table 4. While these results
are clearly above what we obtained on the syn-
thetic news data, they fall well below the perfor-
mance observed on the trial data. This is not un-
expected as the trial data is unrealistically close
to the training material, while the automatically
extracted news data is noisy. What we did not
expect, however, is the mediocre performance of
LM adaptation (run2): while consistently better
than run1 on both trial and news, it is consistently
worse on the official test data. This may be due to
the fact that test sentences were drawn from differ-
ent sources3 such that it does not constitute a ho-
mogeneous domain on which we can easily adapt
a language model.

For German and Spanish, and to a lesser extent
2As usual in phrase-based MT, two phrases are said to be

consistently aligned, if there is at least one link between their
words and no external links.

3According to the task description, the test set is based
on ”language learning exercises with gaps and cloze-tests, as
well as learner corpora with annotated errors”.

proportion of all test fragments containing out-of-
vocabulary tokens; failed align is the proportion of
fragments which our system cannot align to any of
the reference translations by forced decoding.

for French and Dutch, the BLEU and Word Error
Rate (WER) gains are much higher on the test than
on the trial data, although the resulting BLEU are
around 86-92%. This results from the fact that the
amount of L1 material to translate relative to the
L2 context was significantly higher on the test data
than it was on the trial data (e.g. 17% of words on
en-es test versus 7% on trial).

4.3 Error Analysis

On the French and, especially, on the Dutch data,
our systems suffer from a high rate of out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) source words in the L1 frag-
ments, i.e. words that simply did not appear in our
training data (see Table 5). In the case of Dutch,
OOV’s impose a hard ceiling of 88% on fragment-
level accuracy. These problems could possibly be
alleviated by using more training data, and incor-
porating language-specific mechanisms to handle
morphology and compounding into the systems.

We also evaluate the proportion of reference tar-
get fragments that can not be reached by forced
decoding (Table 5). Note that to produce trial
and test translations, we use standard decoding to

predict a translation that maximizes model score
given the input. Once we have the reference
translation, we use forced decoding to try to pro-
duce the exact reference given the source frag-
ment and our translation model. In some situa-
tions, the correct translations are simply not reach-
able by our systems, either because some target
word has not been observed in training, some part
of the correspondence between source and target
fragments has not been observed, or the system’s
word alignment mechanism is unable to account
for this correspondence, in whole or in part. Ta-
ble 5 shows that this happens between 6% ans
26% of cases, which gives a better upper bound on
the fragment-level accuracy that our system may
achieve. Again, many of these problems could be
solved by using more training data.

To better understand the behavior of our sys-
tems, we manually reviewed 220 sentences where
our baseline French-English system did not ex-
actly match any of the references. We annotated
several types of errors (Table 6). The most fre-
quent source of errors is incorrect sense (35%), i.e.
the system produced a translation of the fragment
that may be correct in some setting, but is not the
correct sense in that context. Those are presum-
ably the errors of interest in a sense disambigua-
tion setting. A close second (34%) were errors
involving incorrect syntax in the fragment transla-
tion, which points to limitations of the Statistical
MT approach, or to a limited language model.

The last third combines several sources of er-
rors. Most notable in this category are non-
idiomatic translations, where the system’s output
was both syntactically correct and understandable,
but clearly not fluent (e.g. “take a siesta” for “have
a nap”); We also identified a number of cases

195



where we felt that either the source segment was
incorrect (eg “je vais évanouir” instead of “je vais
m’évanouir”), or the references were incomplete.
Table 7 gives a few examples.

5 Conclusion

We described the systems used for the submissions
of the National Research Council Canada to the
L2 writing assistant task. We framed the problem
as a machine translation task, and used standard
statistical machine translation systems trained on
publicly available corpora for translating L1 frag-
ments in their L2 context. This approach lever-
ages the strengths of phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation, and therefore performs particu-
larly well when the test examples are close to the
training domain. Conversely, it suffers from the
inherent weaknesses of phrase-based models, in-
cluding their inability to generalize beyond seen
vocabulary, as well as sense and syntax errors.
Overall, we showed that machine translation sys-
tems can be used to address the L2 writing assis-
tant task with a high level of accuracy, reaching
out-of-five word-based accuracy above 80 percent
for 3 out of 4 language pairs.
