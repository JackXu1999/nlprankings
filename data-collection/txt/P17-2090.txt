Abstract

The quality of a Neural Machine Transla-
tion system depends substantially on the
availability of sizable parallel corpora. For
low-resource language pairs this is not the
case, resulting in poor translation qual-
ity. Inspired by work in computer vi-
sion, we propose a novel data augmenta-
tion approach that targets low-frequency
words by generating new sentence pairs
containing rare words in new, synthetically
created contexts. Experimental results on
simulated low-resource settings show that
our method improves translation quality
by up to 2.9 BLEU points over the baseline
and up to 3.2 BLEU over back-translation.

1 Introduction

In computer vision, data augmentation techniques
are widely used to increase robustness and im-
prove learning of objects with a limited number of
training examples. In image processing the train-
ing data is augmented by, for instance, horizon-
tally flipping, random cropping, tilting, and al-
tering the RGB channels of the original images
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Chatfield et al., 2014).
Since the content of the new image is still the
same, the label of the original image is preserved
(see top of Figure 1). While data augmentation
has become a standard technique to train deep net-
works for image processing, it is not a common
practice in training networks for NLP tasks such
as Machine Translation.

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al.,
2014) is a sequence-to-sequence architecture
where an encoder builds up a representation of the
source sentence and a decoder, using the previous

LSTM hidden states and an attention mechanism,
generates the target translation.

To train a model with reliable parameter estima-
tions, these networks require numerous instances
of sentence translation pairs with words occurring
in diverse contexts, which is typically not avail-
able in low-resource language pairs. As a result
NMT falls short of reaching state-of-the-art per-
formances for these language pairs (Zoph et al.,
2016). The solution is to either manually annotate
more data or perform unsupervised data augmen-
tation. Since manual annotation of data is time-
consuming, data augmentation for low-resource
language pairs is a more viable approach. Re-
cently Sennrich et al. (2016a) proposed a method
to back-translate sentences from monolingual data
and augment the bitext with the resulting pseudo
parallel corpora.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
approach, translation data augmentation (TDA),
that augments the training data by altering existing
sentences in the parallel corpus, similar in spirit to
the data augmentation approaches in computer vi-
sion (see Figure 1). In order for the augmentation
process in this scenario to be label-preserving, any
change to a sentence in one language must pre-

serve the meaning of the sentence, requiring sen-
tential paraphrasing systems which are not avail-
able for many language pairs. Instead, we propose
a weaker notion of label preservation that allows to
alter both source and target sentences at the same
time as long as they remain translations of each
other.

While our approach allows us to augment
data in numerous ways, we focus on augment-
ing instances involving low-frequency words, be-
cause the parameter estimation of rare words is
challenging, and further exacerbated in a low-
resource setting. We simulate a low-resource set-
ting as done in the literature (Marton et al., 2009;
Duong et al., 2015) and obtain substantial im-
provements for translating EnglishÑGerman and
GermanÑEnglish.

2 Translation Data Augmentation

Given a source and target sentence pair (S,T), we
want to alter it in a way that preserves the semantic
equivalence between S and T while diversifying as
much as possible the training examples. A number
of ways to do this can be envisaged, as for example
paraphrasing (parts of) S or T. Paraphrasing, how-
ever, is by itself a difficult task and is not guaran-
teed to bring useful new information into the train-
ing data. We choose instead to focus on a subset of
the vocabulary that we know to be poorly modeled
by our baseline NMT system, namely words that
occur rarely in the parallel corpus. Thus, the goal
of our data augmentation technique is to provide
novel contexts for rare words. To achieve this we
search for contexts where a common word can be
replaced by a rare word and consequently replace
its corresponding word in the other language by
that rare word’s translation:

original pair augmented pair
S : s1, ..., si, ..., sn S

1 : s1, ..., s1i, ..., sn
T : t1, ..., tj , ..., tm T

1 : t1, ..., t1j , ..., tm

where tj is a translation of si and word-aligned to
si. Plausible substitutions are those that result in a
fluent and grammatical sentence but do not neces-
sarily maintain its semantic content. As an exam-
ple, the rare word motorbike can be substituted in
different contexts:

Sentence [original / substituted] Plausible
My sister drives a [car / motorbike] yes
My uncle sold his [house / motorbike] yes
Alice waters the [plant / motorbike] no (semantics)
John bought two [shirts / motorbike] no (syntax)

Implausible substitutions need to be ruled out dur-
ing data augmentation. To this end, rather than re-
lying on linguistic resources which are not avail-
able for many languages, we rely on LSTM lan-
guage models (LM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhu-
ber, 1997; Jozefowicz et al., 2015) trained on large
amounts of monolingual data in both forward and
backward directions.

Our data augmentation method involves the fol-
lowing steps:

Targeted words selection: Following common
practice, our NMT system limits its vocabulary V
to the v most common words observed in the train-
ing corpus. We select the words in V that have
fewer than R occurrences and use this as our tar-
geted rare word list VR.

Rare word substitution: If the LM suggests a
rare substitution in a particular context, we replace
that word and add the new sentence to the training
data. Formally, given a sentence pair pS, T q and a
position i in S we compute the probability distri-
bution over V by the forward and backward LMs
and select rare word substitutions C as follows:
ÝÑC “ ts1i P VR : topKPForwardLMS ps1i | si´11 quÐÝC “ ts1i P VR : topKPBackwardLMS ps1i | si`1n qu
C “ ts1i | s1i P ÝÑC ^ s1i P ÐÝC u

where topK returns the K words with highest con-
ditional probability according to the context. The
selected substitutions s1i, are used to replace the
original word and generate a new sentence.

Translation selection: Using automatic word
alignments1 trained over the bitext, we replace the
translation of word si in T by the translation of its
substitution s1i. Following a common practice in
statistical MT, the optimal translation t1j is chosen
by multiplying direct and inverse lexical transla-
tion probabilities with the LM probability of the
translation in context:

t1j “ argmax
tPtransps1iq

P ps1i | tqP pt | s1iqPLMT pt | tj´11 q

If no translation candidate is found because the
word is unaligned or because the LM probability

alignments and a bilingual lexicon with lexical translation
probabilities from the low-resource bitext.

568



is less than a certain threshold, the augmented sen-
tence is discarded. This reduces the risk of gener-
ating sentence pairs that are semantically or syn-
tactically incorrect.

Sampling: We loop over the original parallel
corpus multiple times, sampling substitution po-
sitions, i, in each sentence and making sure that
each rare word gets augmented at most N times so
that a large number of rare words can be affected.
We stop when no new sentences are generated in
one pass of the training data.

Table 1 provides some examples resulting from
our augmentation procedure. While using a large
LM to substitute words with rare words mostly re-
sults in grammatical sentences, this does not mean
that the meaning of the original sentence is pre-
served. Note that meaning preservation is not an
objective of our approach.

Two translation data augmentation (TDA) se-
tups are considered: only one word per sentence
can be replaced (TDAr“1), or multiple words per
sentence can be replaced, with the condition that
any two replaced words are at least five positions
apart (TDArě1). The latter incurs a higher risk
of introducing noisy sentences but has the poten-
tial to positively affect more rare words within the
same amount of augmented data. We evaluate both
setups in the following section.

lighted [original / substituted] and [original /
translated] words.

3 Evaluation

In this section we evaluate the utility of our ap-
proach in a simulated low-resource NMT scenario.

3.1 Data and experimental setup

To simulate a low-resource setting we randomly
sample 10% of the EnglishØGerman WMT15
training data and report results on newstest 2014,
2015, and 2016 (Bojar et al., 2016). For reference
we also provide the result of our baseline system
on the full data.

As NMT system we use a 4-layer attention-
based encoder-decoder model as described in (Lu-
ong et al., 2015) trained with hidden dimension
1000, batch size 80 for 20 epochs. In all experi-
ments the NMT vocabulary is limited to the most
common 30K words in both languages. Note that
data augmentation does not introduce new words
to the vocabulary. In all experiments we prepro-
cess source and target language data with Byte-
pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016b) using
30K merge operations. In the augmentation exper-
iments BPE is performed after data augmentation.

For the LMs needed for data augmentation, we
train 2-layer LSTM networks in forward and back-
ward directions on the monolingual data provided
for the same task (3.5B and 0.9B tokens in En-
glish and German respectively) with embedding
size 64 and hidden size 128. We set the rare word
threshold R to 100, top K words to 1000 and max-
imum number N of augmentations per rare word
to 500. In all experiments we use the English LM
for the rare word substitutions, and the German
LM to choose the optimal word translation in con-
text. Since our approach is not label preserving we
only perform augmentation during training and do
not alter source sentences during testing.

We also compare our approach to Sennrich et al.
(2016a) by back-translating monolingual data and
adding it to the parallel training data. Specifically,
we back-translate sentences from the target side of
WMT’15 that are not included in our low-resource
baseline with two settings: keeping a one-to-one
ratio of back-translated versus original data (1 : 1)
following the authors’ suggestion, or using three
times more back-translated data (3 : 1).

We measure translation quality by single-
reference case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) computed with the multi-bleu.perl
script from Moses.

3.2 Results

All translation results are displayed in Table 2.
As expected, the low-resource baseline performs
much worse than the full data system, re-iterating

the importance of sizable training data for NMT.
Next we observe that both back-translation and
our proposed TDA method significantly improve
translation quality. However TDA obtains the best
results overall and significantly outperforms back-
translation in all test sets. This is an important
finding considering that our method involves only
minor modifications to the original training sen-
tences and does not involve any costly translation
process. Improvements are consistent across both
translation directions, regardless of whether rare
word substitutions are first applied to the source
or to the target side.

We also observe that altering multiple words in
a sentence performs slightly better than altering
only one. This indicates that addressing more rare
words is preferable even though the augmented
sentences are likely to be noisier.

To verify that the gains are actually due to the
rare word substitutions and not just to the repeti-
tion of part of the training data, we perform a fi-
nal experiment where each sentence pair selected
for augmentation is added to the training data un-
changed (Oversampling in Table 2). Surprisingly,
we find that this simple form of sampled data
replication outperforms both baseline and back-
translation systems,2 while TDArě1 remains the
best performing system overall.

We also observe that the system trained on aug-
mented data tends to generate longer translations.
Averaging on all test sets, the length of translations
generated by the baseline is 0.88 of the average
reference length, while for TDAr“1 and TDArě1
it is 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. We attribute this
effect to the ability of the TDA-trained system to
generate translations for rare words that were left

2Note that this effect cannot be achieved by simply con-
tinuing the baseline training for up to 50 epochs.

untranslated by the baseline system.

4 Analysis of the Results

A desired effect of our method is to increase the
number of correct rare words generated by the
NMT system at test time.

To examine the impact of augmenting the train-
ing data by creating contexts for rare words on
the target side, Table 3 provides an example for
GermanÑEnglish translation. We see that the
baseline model is not able to generate the rare
word centimetres as a correct translation of the
German word zentimeter . However, this word is
not rare in the training data of the TDArě1 model
after augmentation and is generated during trans-
lation. Table 3 also provides several instances of
augmented training sentences targeting the word
centimetres. Note that even though some aug-
mented sentences are nonsensical (e.g. the speed
limit is five centimetres per hour), the NMT sys-
tem still benefits from the new context for the rare
word and is able to generate it during testing.

Figure 2 demonstrates that this is indeed the
case for many words: the number of rare words
occurring in the reference translation (VR X Vref )
is three times larger in the TDA system output
than in the baseline output. One can also see that
this increase is a direct effect of TDA as most
of the rare words are not ‘rare’ anymore in the
augmented data, i.e., they were augmented suffi-
ciently many times to occur more than 100 times
(see hatched pattern in Figure 2). Note that during
the experiments we did not use any information
from the evaluation sets.

To gauge the impact of augmenting the con-
texts for rare words on the source side, we ex-
amine normalized attention scores of these words
before and after augmentation. When translating

TDArě1 translation the tunnel has a UNK measuring meters 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres wide .

Examples of ‚ the average speed of cars and buses is therefore around 20 [kilometres / centimetres] per hour .

for the word ‚ all suites and rooms are very spacious and measure between 50 and 70 [m / centimetres]
centimetres ‚ all we have to do is lower the speed limit everywhere to five [kilometers / centimetres] per hour .

during test time. The translation of the baseline does not include the rare word centimetres, however, the
translation of our TDA model generates the rare word and produces a more fluent sentence. Instances of
the augmentation of the word centimetres in training data are also provided.

EnglishÑGerman with our TDA model, the at-
tention scores for rare words on the source side
are on average 8.8% higher than when translating
with the baseline model. This suggests that hav-
ing more accurate representations of rare words
increases the model’s confidence to attend to these
words when encountered during test time.

Finally Table 4 provides examples of cases
where augmentation results in incorrect sentences.
In the first example, the sentence is ungrammati-

cal after substitution (of / yearly), which can be the
result of choosing substitutions with low probabil-
ities from the English LM topK suggestions.

Errors can also occur during translation selec-
tion, as in the second example where betraut is an
acceptable translation of entrusted but would re-
quire a rephrasing of the German sentence to be
grammatically correct. Problems of this kind can
be attributed to the German LM, but also to the
lack of a more suitable translation in the lexicon
extracted from the bitext. Interestingly, this noise
seems to affect NMT only to a limited extent.

5 Conclusion

We have proposed a simple but effective ap-
proach to augment the training data of Neural
Machine Translation for low-resource language
pairs. By leveraging language models trained
on large amounts of monolingual data, we gen-
erate new sentence pairs containing rare words
in new, synthetically created contexts. We show
that this approach leads to generating more rare
words during translation and, consequently, to
higher translation quality. In particular we re-
port substantial improvements in simulated low-
resource EnglishÑGerman and GermanÑEnglish
settings, outperforming another recently proposed
data augmentation technique.
