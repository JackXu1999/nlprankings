Abstract

This paper presents a statistical model to
predict Japanese word order in the dou-
ble object constructions. We employed a
Bayesian linear mixed model with man-
ually annotated predicate-argument struc-
ture data. The findings from the refined
corpus analysis confirmed the effects of
information status of an NP as ‘given-
new ordering’ in addition to the effects of
‘long-before-short’ as a tendency of the
general Japanese word order.

1 Introduction

Because Japanese exhibits a flexible word order,
potential factors that predict word orders of a
given construction in Japanese have been recently
delved into, particularly in the field of compu-
tational linguistics (Yamashita and Kondo, 2011;
Orita, 2017). One of the major findings relevant to
the current study is ‘long-before-short’, whereby
a long noun phrase (NP) tends to be scrambled
ahead of a short NP (Yamashita and Chang, 2001).

This paper sheds light on those factors in dou-
ble object constructions (DOC), where either (1)
an indirect object (IOBJ) or (2) a direct object
(DOBJ) can precede the other object:

Taro-SBJ

‘Taro gave Hanako a book.’

(2) Taro-ga
Taro-SBJ

hon-o
book-DOBJ

Hanako-ni
Hanako-IOBJ

ageta.
gave

‘Taro gave Hanako a book.’

Since both of the word orders are available,
studies in theoretical syntax have been disputing
about what is the canonical word order under the
hypothesis of deriving one word order (i.e., either

IOBJ-DOBJ or DOBJ-IOBJ) from another in the
context of derivational syntax (Hoji, 1985; Miya-
gawa, 1997; Matsuoka, 2003). In this paper, we do
not attempt to adjudicate upon the dispute solely
based on the frequency of the two word orders in
a corpus, but aim to detect principal factors that
predict the word order in the DOC, which may
eventually lead to resolving the issue in theoreti-
cal syntax. To that end, we employed a Bayesian
linear mixed model with potential factors affecting
the word orders as a preliminary study.

Other than the factor ‘long-before-short’ pro-
posed in previous studies, the key factor in the
current study is an information status of an NP
in a given context under the theoretical frame-
work of information structure (Lambrecht, 1994;
Vallduvı́ and Engdahl, 1996). The framework
provides us key categories, such as (information-
ally) given/old, new, topic, and focus, to classify
an NP as how it functions in a particular con-
text. We assume the information status as one
of the principle predictors based on the following
two reasons; (i) a discourse-given element tends
to precede a discourse-new one in a sentence in
Japanese (Kuno, 1978, 2004; Nakagawa, 2016),
(ii) focused or new elements in Japanese tend to
appear in a position immediately preceding the
predicate (Kuno, 1978; Kim, 1988; Ishihara, 2001;
Vermeulen, 2012). These two claims regarding the
general word order of Japanese are combined into
the following hypothesis regarding the word or-
ders in the DOC.

(3) Our hypothesis:
In the DOC, a discourse-given object
tends to appear on the left of the other ob-
ject, and a discourse-new object tends to
be on the right side.

Incorporating the information status of an NP
with another factor ‘long-before-short’ proposed
in the previous studies, we built a statistical model

portant advantage of our study is that, with the lat-
est version of the corpus we used (See Section 3),
the information status of an NP can be analyzed
not simply by bipartite groups as either pronoun
(given) or others (new) but by the number of co-
indexed items in a preceding text.

2 Preceding Work

Table 1 shows a comparison with the latest corpus
studies on Japanese word ordering.

Sasano and Okumura (2016) explored the
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions (either SUBJ-IOBJ-DOBJ-PRED or
SUBJ-DOBJ-IOBJ-PRED) by a large-scale web
corpus. The web corpus contains 10 billion sen-
tences parsed by the Japanese morphological an-
alyzer JUMAN and the syntactic analyzer KNP.
In their analysis, the parse trees without syntac-
tic ambiguity were extracted from the web corpus,
and the word order was estimated by verb types
with a linear regression and normalized pointwise
mutual information. Their model did not include
any inter-sentential factors such as coreference.

Orita (2017) made a statistical model to predict
a scrambled word order as (direct) object-subject.
She used the NAIST Text corpus which has a man-
ual annotation of predicate-argument structure and
coreference information. She explored the effect
of syntactic priming, NP length, animacy, and
given-new bipartite information status (given was
defined as having a lexically identical item in a
previous text). Her frequentism statistical analysis
(simple logistic regression) did not detect a signif-
icant effect of the given-new factor on the order of
a subject and an object.

As a preliminary study which features coref-
erential information as a potential factor, we
used manual annotation of syntactic dependencies,
predicate-argument structures and coreference in-

formation, employing a Bayesian statistical analy-
sis on the small-sized well-maintained data.

3 Experiments

3.1 Corpora: BCCWJ-PAS

We used the ‘Balanced Corpus of Contempo-
rary Written Japanese’ (BCCWJ) (Maekawa et al.,
2014), which includes morphological informa-
tion and sentence boundaries, as the target cor-
pus. The corpus was extended with annotations
of predicate-argument structures as BCCWJ-PAS
(BCCWJ Predicate Argument Structures), based
on the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007) com-
patible standard. We revised all annotations of the
BCCWJ-PAS data, including subjects (with case
marker -ga), direct objects (with case marker -o),
and indirect objects (with case marker -ni), as well
as coreferential information of NPs. After the revi-
sion process, syntactic dependencies of BCCWJ-
DepPara (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016) were
overlaid on the predicate-argument structures.

We extracted 4-tuples of subject (subj), direct
object (dobj), indirect object (iobj) and predi-
cate (pred) from the overlaid data. Excluding
4-tuples with zero-pronoun, case alternation, or
inter-clause dependencies from the target data, we
obtained 584 samples of the 4-tuples.

Figure 1 shows an example sentence from BC-
CWJ Yahoo! Answer sample (OC09 04653). The
surface is segmented into base phrases, which is
the unit to evaluate the distance between two con-
stituents as in the following pairs of the 4-tuples:
subj-pred (distsubjpred), dobj-pred (dist

dobj
pred), iobj-pred

(distiobjpred), subj-iobj (dist
subj
iobj ), subj-dobj (dist

subj
dobj ),

and iobj-dobj (distiobjdobj). The distance was calcu-
lated from the rightmost word in each pair. For
example, in Figure 1, distsubjpred is identified as the
distance between “” and “” as 4.

general Japanese word-order tendency, lengths of
constituents were modeled as fixed effects in the
statistical analysis. The lengths of subject, direct
object and indirect object were calculated based
on a mora count (in pronunciation) available in
BCCWJ as N subjmora, N

dobj
mora, and N

iobj
mora, respec-

tively. For example, in Figure 1, N subjmora is the
number of morae of “ ” (sono kanojoga), which
is 6. Note that an NP may contain more than one
base phrase including an embedded clause. We
evaluated the maximum span of the dependency
subtree in BCCWJ-DepPara as a length of the NP.

In addition, the numbers of coreferent items in
a preceding text were modeled as fixed effects.
The numbers of coreferent items for subject, di-
rect object and indirect object were obtained from
the BCCWJ-PAS annotations as N subjcoref , N

dobj
coref ,

and N iobjcoref , respectively. Table 2 shows the ba-
sic statistics of the distance, mora, and number of
coreferent items.

3.2 Statistical Analysis
We used Bayesian linear mixed models (Sorensen
et al., 2016) (BLMM) for the statistical analysis on
the distance between arguments as well as an argu-
ment and its predicate. We modeled the following
formula:

distleftright ∼ Normal(µ, σ)

µ ← α+ βsubjmora ·N subjmora + β
subj
coref ·N

subj
coref

+βdobjmora ·Ndobjmora + β
dobj
coref ·N

dobj
coref

+βiobjmora ·N iobjmora + β
iobj
coref ·N

iobj
coref .

distleftright (e.g. dist
subj
iobj : distance between subject

(left) and indirect object (right)) stands for the dis-
tance between left and right elements, which is

modeled by a normal distribution with average µ
and stdev σ. µ is defined by a linear formula with
an intercept α and two types of interest coeffi-
cients. N subjmora, N

dobj
mora, and N

iobj
mora are the number

of morae of a subject, a direct object, and an indi-
rect object, respectively. The subject and objects
can be composed of more than one phrase, and
when they contain a clause, the number of morae
was defined with the clause length.
N subjcoref , N

dobj
coref , and N

iobj
coref stand for the num-

ber of preceding coreferent NPs of a subject, a di-
rect object, and an indirect, respectively. βab are
the slope parameters for the coefficients Nab . Note
that the distance was measured by the number of
base phrase units, and a minus value indicates a
distance in an opposite direction.

We ran 4 chains × 2000 post-warmup iteration,
and all models were converged.

4 Results and Discussions

4.1 Results

Table 3 shows the estimated parameters by the
BLMM; the values are means with standard devi-
ations (in brackets). The findings are summarized
as follows.

First, the distance between a subject and its
predicate (distsubjpred) is affected only by the num-
ber of morae of a subject, which indicates that a
longer subject NP has a longer distance from its
predicate.

Second, the distance between a direct object and
its predicate (distdobjpred) is affected by the number of
morae of the direct object, the number of its pre-
ceding coreferent items, and the number of morae
of the indirect object. It indicates that i) a longer
direct object has a longer distance from its predi-
cate, ii) a direct object with more coreferent items
in a preceding text has a longer distance from its
predicate, and iii) a longer indirect object makes
shorter the distance between the direct object and
its predicate.

Third, the distance between an indirect object
and its predicate (distiobjpred) is affected by the num-
ber of morae of the indirect object, the number
of its preceding coreferent items, the number of
morae of a direct object, and the number of pre-
ceding coreferent items of a subject. It indicates
that i) a longer indirect object has a longer distance
from its predicate, ii) an indirect object with more
coreferent items in a preceding text has a longer
distance from its predicate, iii) a longer direct ob-

ject makes shorter the distance between the indi-
rect object and its predicate, and iv) a subject with
more coreferent items makes shorter the distance
between the indirect object and its predicate.

The distance between arguments (distsubjiobj ,

distsubjdobj , and dist
iobj
dobj) represents nearly the same

tendency as the combination of the predicate-
argument distance. However, the number of morae
of an argument is correlated with the length of the
argument (i.e., the number of base phrases), and
thus, the distance between the leftmost and right-
most arguments (e.g. subject, direct object) is af-
fected by the number of morae of the middle argu-
ment (e.g. N iobjmora).

4.2 Discussions

The results revealed that the subject tends to pre-
cede the direct and indirect objects in the double
object constructions. Although the indirect object
tends to precede the direct object, it is not signifi-
cant (p=0.09).

The estimated coefficients for the number of
coreferent items (Ndobjcoref for dist

dobj
pred and N

iobj
coref

for distiobjpred) support our hypothesis in (3) as
‘given-new ordering’ for the direct and indirect
objects. An object with many preceding corefer-
ent items tends to be farther from a corresponding

predicate.
The estimated coefficients for the number of

morae (N subjmora for dist
subj
pred, N

dobj
mora for dist

dobj
pred and

N iobjmora for dist
iobj
pred) indicate that the orders of all

arguments in the DOC follow ‘long-before-short’.
It is also confirmed by the minus values as the esti-
mated coefficients for the number of morae of one
object in relation to the order of the other object
and its predicate (Ndobjmora for dist

iobj
pred and N

iobj
mora

for distdobjpred), suggesting that a longer object tends
to precede the other object in the DOC.

5 Conclusions

This article presents a Bayesian statistical analy-
sis on Japanese word ordering in the double ob-
ject constructions. It revealed the ‘given-new or-
dering’ for the indirect and direct objects and also
confirmed the ‘long-before-short’ tendency for all
of the arguments in the constructions.

Setting off from the current preliminary study,
our future work is to investigate effects of verb
type and animacy of an NP. We are currently an-
notating the labels of a Japanese thesaurus ‘Word
List by Semantic Principles’ (WLSP) (Kokurit-
sukokugokenkyusho, 1964), which enables us to
explore those effects.
