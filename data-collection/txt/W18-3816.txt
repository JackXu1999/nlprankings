Abstract

This paper performs a detailed analysis on the alignment of Portuguese contractions, based on
a previously aligned bilingual corpus. The alignment task was performed manually in a subset
of the English-Portuguese CLUE4Translation Alignment Collection. The initial parallel corpus
was pre-processed and a decision was made as to whether the contraction should be maintained
or decomposed in the alignment. Decomposition was required in the cases in which the two
words that have been concatenated, i.e., the preposition and the determiner or pronoun, go in
two separate translation alignment pairs (PT - [no seio de] [a União Europeia] EN - [within]
[the European Union]). Most contractions required decomposition in contexts where they are
positioned at the end of a multiword unit. On the other hand, contractions tend to be maintained
when they occur at the beginning or in the middle of the multiword unit, i.e., in the frozen part
of the multiword (PT - [no que diz respeito a] EN - [with regard to] or PT - [além disso] EN -
[in addition]. A correct alignment of multiwords and phrasal units containing contractions is
instrumental for machine translation, paraphrasing, and variety adaptation.

1 Introduction

The past decade has seen a significant advance in the field of machine translation mainly due to the
growth of publicly available corpora, from which an enormous amount of translation alignments have
been extracted. Alignments of multiword units and other phrases represent the driving force in the devel-
opment of translation systems and the success of systems like Google Translate, which has a great deal to
do with huge lexical coverage available in the large amounts of corpora that they have access to (Barreiro
et al., 2014b) and from which translation alignments are extracted. But the quality of these alignments
is also very important. For example, several authors have pointed out that the integration of multiword
units in translation models based on linguistic knowledge is considered as an impact factor in obtaining
better quality translations (cf. (Chiang, 2005), (Marcu et al., 2006), or (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006),
among others). Expert participation extends to the gathering, enhancement and integration of language
resources including non-contiguous multiword unit alignments (Barreiro and Batista, 2016). Above all,
high quality machine translation depends on the quality of the alignments used in the processes of ma-
chine learning. Some systems use unsupervised learning, in which the machine itself decides which
segments of a source-language phrase align with which target language phrase segments (Och and Ney,
2000), while others use supervised learning based on previous alignments made manually by linguists
(Blunsom and Cohn, 2006). In this paper, we focus on the alignment of multiword units where con-
tractions occur, a challenge that has been overlooked in the existing literature and can be responsible
for grammatical errors in translations.

A contraction is a word formed from two or more words of different parts-of-speech (most frequently)
or the same part-of-speech (more seldom) that would otherwise appear next to each other in a sequence.
For example, in English the most common contractions are those where the word not is added to an

auxiliary verb in negative sentences, with omission of internal letters (e.g., is not → isn’t) or those con-
sisting of combinations of pronouns with auxiliary verbs, in which a word or a syllable is substituted by
an apostrophe (e.g., it is → it’s). These contractions are mainly used in speech and informal writing, but
not in formal writing as in the Romance languages, where contractions are non-optional. The most com-
mon contractions in the Romance languages are those where prepositions are contracted with articles or
pronouns with addition, replacement, or omission of letters. For example, in Portuguese the contraction
nas "in, at the" results from the concatenation of the preposition em with the feminine plural definite
article as; in Italian, the contraction degli "of" results from the concatenation of the preposition di with
the masculine plural definite article gli; in Spanish, the contraction al "to, at the" results from the con-
catenation of the preposition a with the masculine singular definite article el; in French, the contraction
aux "at, for, to the" results from the concatenation of the preposition à with the masculine plural definite
article les. However, contractions can also be composed of two words with the same part-of-speech, e.g.,
two determiners (la une → l’une) or two prepositions (de après → d’après), as in French.

We describe a linguistically motivated approach to the alignment of multiword units where contrac-
tions occurring in these multiword units are required to be decomposed, except in specific circumstances
determined by the context, such as when they constitute a non-variable (non-inflecting) element of a
frozen multiword unit. Decomposition allows the correct alignment of a multiword unit, such as the
prepositional compound apesar de "in spite of", in the sense that it separates the preposition de "of" that
is part of the multiword from a concatenated element, in this case, the feminine singular definite article
a "the" that is not part of the multiword, but rather belongs to the phrase or expression that immediately
follows it (e.g., apesar da → [apesar de] [a NP]. Similarly, the masculine plural definite article os "the"
in the expression à luz de "in light of" requires to be split from the preposition de (e.g., [à luz dos] →
[à luz de] [os NP). However, the contraction of the preposition a "at" with the feminine singular definite
article a in this expression is not decomposed from its composed form à, because it represents a fixed
element of the multiword unit, never changing its form. Failure to align and process correctly these
multiword units involving contractions containing elements that are external to them leads to errors in
the translated texts. Even if these errors do not affect the understanding of the translated text, they may
compromise the quality of the translation leading to greater post-editing efforts.

In our experiment, a linguist has pre-processed manually a subset of the reference Europarl parallel
corpus (Koehn, 2005) containing 400 Portuguese-English parallel sentences. From this subset corpus, the
EN–PT CLUE4Translation Alignment Collection was achieved by adopting the methodology described
in Section 3 for the alignment of Portuguese multiwords and other phrasal units involving contractions
in the original corpus. This methodology was achieved during the development of the CLUE Alignment
Guidelines, a set of linguistically-informed guidelines for the alignment translation or paraphrastic units
in bitexts. In other words, the Guidelines were developed in two separate sets of documents containing
statements by which to determine courses of action regarding the alignment of multiwords and other
phrasal units, depending on whether these linguistic units are used in translation (CLUE4Translation
Alignment Guidelines) or in paraphrasing (CLUE4Paraphrasing Alignment Guidelines). The approach
reinforces the weight of multiwords as objects of representation in the alignment between the source
and the target languages. This is independent of the source-target being two different languages (e.g.,
translation), two language varieties (e.g., variety adaptation), or the same language (e.g., paraphrases).
The annotation of the subset corpus was performed with the CLUE-Aligner tool (Barreiro et al., 2016),
a paraphrastic and translation unit aligner built to provide an efficient solution in the alignment of non-
contiguous multiword units. CLUE-Aligner was developed within the eSPERTo project1, whose ob-
jective is to develop a context-sensitive, linguistically enhanced paraphrase system that can be used in
natural language processing applications, such as intelligent writing aids, summarization tools, smart
dialogue systems, language learning, among others. Our broader research aims to contribute to new ma-

chine translation systems that produce high quality translation for which linguistically-based alignments
are extremely important.

2 Related Work

In NLP tasks, contractions are problematic for several reasons, among them: (i) two or more function
words2 mostly with different parts-of-speech overlap, which makes syntactic analysis and generation
difficult; (ii) in cross-language analysis, the contrast between languages that have contractions and lan-
guages that do not have them, or do not have them in the same contexts, may present additional dif-
ficulties. Although, most parsers and part-of-speech taggers can process contractions successfully, the
alignment of segments in a parallel pair of sentences, where one particular segment corresponds to a
contraction in one language and to more than one segment (no contraction) in the other language has not
been adequately addressed in alignment annotation guidelines or alignment research (cf. (Och and Ney,
2000), (Lambert et al., 2005), (Graça et al., 2008), or (Tiedemann, 2011), among others). For example,
the Portuguese contraction of the preposition em and the demonstrative pronoun este in neste corresponds
to two words in English (in this) and in Spanish (en esta), as illustrated in example (1).

PT - com o intuito de conseguir um avanço neste (em + este) domínio

In addition, the freely available parallel corpora most used in alignment tasks (Koehn, 2005) have
not been pre-processed in order to make possible the correct alignment of the pairs of multiword units
involving contractions. These shortcomings and lack of adequate directives to guide annotators in align-
ment tasks are responsible for machine translation errors, but they also affect negatively other NLP tasks
involving alignment resources, such as paraphrasing, among others. Our contraction pre-processing task
aims to advance the state of the art alignment taking into consideration the correct alignment of multi-
word units where contractions existed in the original corpus.3 The methodology used to decide whether
contractions need to be decomposed for the alignment of their canonical forms or whether they are re-
quired to be maintained inside the multiword unit is presented in Section 3.

The Romance languages have peculiar behaviour with regards to the use of contractions. Some lan-
guages require a particular contraction, other languages require another type of contraction. Our method-
ology is consistent with regards to decomposition of contractions when they refer to aligning canonical
forms, i.e., separate words like a preposition and a determiner cannot align with a contraction or when
they are part of a frozen compound or fixed expression. For example, the English lexical bundle in that
sense requires the contraction in the Portuguese translation nesse sentido to be maintained. The equiv-
alents in the remaining Romance languages do not contain contractions (en ese sentido in Spanish, and
en ce sens in French).

3 Methodology

In our alignment task, the PT–EN CLUE4Translation parallel corpus was pre-processed for a framework
decision regarding whether its contractions should be decomposed or maintained. Sections 3.1 and 3.2
discuss the alignment issues specific to each one of the decisions, with a set of real-world alignment
examples, which aid in the understanding of the issues raised. Initially, the pre-processing task consisted
of a semi-manual decomposition by a linguist of all contractions. Decomposition allowed for the correct
alignment of multiword units where contracted forms required to be split so that those multiwords and
the phrases that follow them could be mapped to the corresponding elements in the source language, as
illustrated in Section 3.1. Subsequently, all the decomposed forms were reviewed and the decomposed

2Function or structure words, such as prepositions, determiners, auxiliary verbs and pronouns, among others, have little
lexical or ambiguous meaning, and are used to express grammatical (or structural) relationships with other words within a
sentence. They are extensively described in grammars. Function words are in contrast with content or lexical words, which
include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and most adverbs, normally containing very specific meanings listed in the dictionaries.

forms in multiwords and frozen expressions were changed back to contractions, as described in Section
3.2. This methodology prioritized decomposition for statistical reasons only. The number of contractions
that need to be decomposed in the corpus is much greater than the number of contractions that require to
be maintained.

3.1 Decomposed Contractions

The Portuguese word do "of the" occurring in the original corpus corresponds to the contraction of the
preposition de with the masculine definite article o that agrees with its masculine noun modifier grupo
in the phrase em nome do meu grupo "on the behalf of my group". This contraction was decomposed in
two elements, the preposition de "of" and the masculine singular definite article o "the" (de + o) in order
to align correctly both the canonical form (lemma) of the compound word em nome de "on behalf of",
and the noun phrase o meu grupo "my group", where the preposition of the contraction goes with the
compound and the definite article goes with the noun phrase, i.e., the decomposition is required to make
possible that the two concatenated words go in two different alignment pairs, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Similar decomposition has taken place in contractions such as those illustrated in examples (2)–(5).

(2) EN - across + [the Atlantic]
PT - do outro lado de (do = [de+o]) [o Atlântico]

(3) EN - issues like + [the NP]
PT - questões como a de (dos = [de+os]) [os NP]

(4) EN - with respect to + [the N]
PT - quanto a (ao = [a+o]) [o N]

(5) EN - fully approves [NP: the joint position of the council]
PT - dá a sua total aprovação a (à = [a+a]) [NP: a posição comum do conselho]

Decomposition of contractions also has implication in coordination. For example, the coordinated
noun phrases o parlamento "the parliament" and o conselho "the council" illustrated in Figure 2 are di-
rect complements of the Portuguese prepositional verb realizado por "carried out by". While in English
the preposition by of the prepositional verb is not repeated before the second noun phrase, in Portuguese
there is repetition of the preposition por in the coordination introduced by the prepositional verb real-
izado por [NP] e por [NP]. The CLUE-Aligner alignment tool allows the alignment of the non-contiguous
coordinating structure, excluding the NP elements (gaps), which are the variable elements of the coordi-
nation, and making possible to align them separately. Alignment methodologies require these linguistic
nuances captured in translation to be handled correctly.

decomposition of the contraction pelo into the preposition por of the prepositional verb and the masculine
singular definite article o of the coordinated NP.

3.2 Non-decomposed Contractions

In a second pre-processing step, decomposed contractions à = a + a "to + the", na = em + a "in +
the", and do = de + o "of + the" were restored in non-compositional multiword units, such as the fixed
expressions à luz de "in light of" already mentioned in Section 1, à data "at the time" illustrated in Figure
3, and na ordem do dia "the next item" in the corpus (better translated as "in the agenda"), illustrated in
Figure 4.

4 Analysis of Preliminary Results

Preliminary results confirmed that most contractions require decomposition in contexts where they are
part of a multiword unit. For example, the most frequent contractions in the corpus, (de + a, de + o, de
+ os, and em + a), with more than 50 occurrences each, establish syntactic relationships between multi-
words, such as compounds, prepositional nouns, etc., some of which are discontinuous (e.g. centrar-se
[] em "to deal with"). In these contractions, the preposition establishes the final border of the first phrase
(i.e., the last word in the phrase), and the determiner establishes the initial border of the phrase imme-
diately after (i.e., the first word in the phrase). The second noun phrase can be a named entity (e.g.,
União Europeia "European Union", Ásia "Asia"), or a term (e.g., capital de risco "risk capital", fundos
de pensão "pension funds"), but, there are also occurrences of contractions that require decomposition
in contexts where the preposition is part of a multiword unit (the last word of the multiword, e.g., em
relação a "with regard to" and the determiner is part of a regular noun phrase, e.g., as observações "the
comments". Table 1 presents the frequency of contractions in contexts in which they require decomposi-
tion.

With regards to contractions that cannot be decomposed, most of them occur in the beginning or in
the middle of the multiword unit, seldom in the end. For example, the contractions no, neste, pelo, and
às in the multiwords no que diz respeito a "with regard to", neste momento "at this time", pelo contrário
"on the contrary", and às 12h30 "at 12.30 p.m." cannot be decomposed, because they are not positioned
in the border with the next phrase. The same goes for the contraction à in the multiword unit até à data
"so far", which occurs in a middle position. Exceptionally, the contraction disso in the multiword além
disso "in addition" also remains undecomposed, because it corresponds to a fixed adverbial expression.
Table 2 presents the frequency of contractions in contexts in which they cannot be decomposed.

Table 2: Frequency of contractions in contexts in which they cannot be decomposed

A few observations are worth noting with regards to undecomposeable contractions. One of them is
that there are some semantico-syntactic patterns that function as linguistic constraints. For example, the
contractions às, nos, or pelos cannot be decomposed when used with time-related named entities, such
as às seis horas da tarde "at 6 p.m", às sextas-feiras "on Fridays", nos anos sessenta "in the sixties",
or pelos anos seguintes "for all years ahead", among others. Another important observation is that, in
normal circumstances, contractions of prepositions with pronouns, such as consigo in the expression
consigo próprio "with itself" should not be decomposed.

The alignment task has given us cause to reflect on how certain linguistic units have been aligned in
previous research work. As far as alignments involving the contraction phenomenon, have there been
discussions on whether the contraction should be maintained or decomposed in cases such as muitos dos
presentes nesta assembleia "many in the house", or pelas mais variadas razões "for a variety of reasons"?
What about other linguistic phenomena? Is there scientific ground to establish "strict" boundaries for
aligning paraphrastic units or translation units or are alignment decisions sometimes arbitrary? While
this is not the first attempt to establish guidelines for alignment tasks, we have made an attempt to treat
contractions in a scientific way, either maintaining the contraction at the beginning and the middle of a



129

multiword unit or decomposing the contraction at the end of the multiword unit. The resulting alignment
data may still contain errors, but we tried to make decisions in more than an ad-hoc fashion.

5 Final Remarks

Language experts’ involvement in machine translation is essential in pre-editing tasks to improve the
quality of the text to be translated (input or source text), and in post-editing tasks to improve the translated
text (output or target text). High quality machine translation is directly related to the human factor,
namely to the intervention of language specialists involved in translation and their role in the validation
of correct translation alignments. When used in machine translation systems, alignments containing
linguistic knowledge contribute to improved accuracy, reduced computational complexity and ambiguity,
and improved translation quality, as illustrated for the contractions described in this paper. Given that
contractions can be a frequent phenomenon in a language, the results that can be obtained through their
correct alignment in a system can be significantly better than those obtained in a purely statistic or
ad-hoc manner. But, there are other linguistic phenomena that require further examination. Without a
suitable linguistic approach to the alignment task, and limited to the capacity of the algorithms, systems
will continue to be overloaded with poor quality alignments, which will create translation of limited
quality, requiring a greater post-editing effort. However, there is still a shortage of manually annotated
alignments that can be used in training and evaluation for many language pairs or language variants,
especially those with scarce resources. In this paper, we have used a methodology to align multiword
units involving contractions, which pose a challenge to their correct alignment. The proposed alignment
methodology does not depend on the application, so the pairs of aligned multiwords and phrases can
be used in translation, paraphrasing, variety adaptation and other NLP tasks. We also hope that the
linguistic knowledge learned in our alignment task can help solve problems related to the alignment of
multiword units, provide better solutions to process and align them, and ultimately serve to build a more
sophisticated automatic alignment tool.
