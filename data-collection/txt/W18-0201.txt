Abstract

This paper describes the test of a dependency parsing method which is based
on bidirectional LSTM feature representations and multilingual word embedding,
and evaluates the results on mono- and multilingual data. The results are similar
in all cases, with a slightly better results achieved using multilingual data. The
languages under investigation are Komi-Zyrian and Russian. Examination of the
results by relation type shows that some language specific constructions are cor-
rectly recognized even when they appear in naturally occurring code-switching
data.

1 Introduction
Spontaneous speech data of small, endangered languages most commonly contain
code-switching, ad-hoc borrowings and other kinds of language contact phenomena
originating from the non-target contact language(s). Consequently, spoken corpora
originating from such data contain numerous utterances in which linguistic elements
from at least two languages co-occur. The most usual occurrences are combinations
of target-language utterances including lexical and morphological elements from the
contacting majority language. Corpus data of this type represents a particular chal-
lenge for morphological analysis and especially for dependency parsing. Although
the basic morphological properties can usually be analyzed on the basis of individ-
ual languages and parsers can be targeted towards those, the syntactic dependencies
are inevitably interspersed individual tokens from different languages, and thereby
cannot be easily approached with tools that are able to target only monolingual data.

The present paper looks at an approach that has been introduced as The Multi-
lingual BIST-Parser by Lim and Poibeau (2017). The tool was developed in order to
perform dependency parsing on considerably low-resource languages, and the work
was originally carried outwithin the CONLL-U Shared Task for 2017. Lim and Poibeau
(2017) have shown that multilingual word embeddings can be used to train a model
that combines data from multiple languages, and these seem to be particularly use-
ful in low-resource scenarios where one of the languages has only a small amount of
available training data.

The target language in the present paper is Komi-Zyrian (henceforth Komi), which
belongs to the Permic branch of the Uralic language family. The language is spo-
ken predominantly in the Komi Republic of the Russian Federation by approximately
160,000 speakers. Computational linguistic research on Komi is so far only in a devel-
opment stage. However, an FST morphological analyzer and a (rudimentary) syntac-
tic parser based on Constraint Grammar are available at Giellatekno/Divvun – Saami
Language Technology at UiTTheArctic University of Norway¹ andwork on a complete
Constraint Grammar description to be implemented into a rule-based syntactic parser
is currently carried out in collaboration by Giellatekno, the Izhva Komi Documenta-
tion Project Gerstenberger et al. (2016, 2017) and FU-Lab², which has also created a
written Komi National corpus (with over 30M words), free electronic dictionaries and
a Hunspell checker (including morpheme lists).

Our own initial dependency parsing tests were conducted by testing various dif-
ferent language pairs with Komi as parts of multilingual word-embedding models, in
order to find out which combinations can reach the best performance. In our earlier
tests, the best results were achieved when the majority of the training data were from
a genealogically related language, in this case Finnish. This went against our hypoth-
esis that the genealogically unrelated contemporary contact languages would have
been particularly useful from a NLP perspective due to prolonged language contact
and resulting convergence in Komi grammar and lexicon. Although it is possible to
build truly multilingual models, such as a parser that combines Finnish, Russian and
Komi word embeddings and training corpora in order to operate on Komi, we found
that a bilingual Finnish-Komimodel performed best in our tests for monolingual Komi
data. However, especially if the results were analyzed more in detail beyond the LAS

and UAS scores (for explanation of these evaluation metrics, see Kübler et al., 2009,
79), the different language pairs will likely show different benefits and drawbacks in
distinct areas of analysis, and testing the parsing method on data that naturally con-
tains materials from both languages used in training is used here as one method to
tease apart language specific changes in parser’s behavior.

The next part of the paper describes this problem in further detail with examples
from spoken language corpora.

2 Problem Description
The first example 1 is taken from the spoken Iźva (dialectal) Komi corpus Blokland
et al. (2009–2017) (henceforth called IKDP) and represents naturally occurring spoken
language mixed with Russian elements (Russian marked in boldface).

parents-pl-comit

тундра-ын.
tundra-ines

‘Until the school age I went to the tundra together with my parents.’

The example starts with a Russian prepositional phrase meaning ’until the school
age’, but it is followed by a direct shift to Komi. The word for ‘parents’ is also Russian,
but it is inflected according to Komi morphological rules and in the same manner as
native Komi words would be inflected. Such morphologically integrated nouns are of-
ten described as Russian loanwords in Komi, but as will be argued in Section 6 below,
this approach may not be very applicable in the context of Uralic languages spoken
in Russia. We are therefore referring to it as a ”mixed” form. In order to compare the
sentences, two bilingual Komi-Russian native speakers³ have translated the example
into both languages. It must be noted that because both Komi and Russian have rather
flexible word orders, this aspect is not taken into account in the present analysis, al-
though there is clear variation in both languages with respect to the semantic nuances
of different orderings.

Note also that the purely Komi variant of the example sentence would still include
two lexical items of Russian origin, namely school and tundra. Although the basic
sentence structure may look similar, Komi and Russian have rather different syntactic
structures overall. For instance, Komi uses cases extensively alongwith postpositions,
whereas Russian uses predominantly prepositions.

For the sake of thoroughness, it is also worth looking into one possible way to
express the utterance entirely in Russian.

Based on different Universal Dependency (UD) corpora, the dependency structure
of the Komi variant should be analyzed as in 4.

Based on these examples, we can conclude that a correctly analyzed dependency
structure for the mixed utterance would be as presented in 6, as it effectively combines
the relevant parts of the Russian and Komi annotations. As the applied annotation
model is the same, the monolingual dependencies should not differ from multilingual
ones.

Although the Multilingual BIST-parser is trained with multilingual material, the
goal has been primarily to parse the lesser resourced language. All earlier tests have
been conducted using strictly monolingual data, although different assumptions can
be made about the parallel structures in the languages included in the model. Ap-
plying the parser to data that truly contains syntactic constructions specific to only
the individual languages within the same utterances reveals about the parser’s abil-
ity to correctly identify structures of this type. If both distinctly Russian and Komi
constructions can be parsed successfully within the same sentence, this indicates that
the model is able to learn and deduce language-specific structures even when they
co-occur. This would open up new possibilities for automatic analysis of such kind of
data.

3 Related Studies
Multilingual dependency parsing aims at building a dependency tree for several lan-
guages using one and the same model. Three major approaches have been suggested



5

for tackling such a task: 1) the cross-lingual annotation projection approach, 2) the
joint modeling approach, and 3) the cross-lingual representation learning approach
(cf. Guo et al., 2015). The main idea of the cross-lingual annotation projection ap-
proach is to project the syntactic annotations trough word alignments from a source
language onto a target language (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Tiedemann, 2014). In a
similar way, the joint modeling approach is carried out using projected dependency
information for grammar inductions (Liu et al., 2013) and rule-based work (Naseem
et al., 2010, 2012).

The cross-lingual representation learning method is focused on learning cross-
lingual features by aligning (or mapping) feature representations (e.g. embedding)
between the source and target languages. In general, cross-lingual representation
learning can be divided into two approaches depending on whether or not the parser
uses lexicalized features (e.g. word embedding). Since it is relatively easy to train a
parser using supervised learning, many existing cross-lingual representation learning
studies have been conducted with the delexicalized approach using POS tag-sets and
word sequences (McDonald et al., 2011, 2013; Dozat et al., 2017). Such an approach
includes training a dependency model with the source language (e.g. English), then
processes the target language (e.g. French) using the model trained according to the
source language. On the other hand, the lexicalized approach is able to adapt diverse
lexical features while in training. The features adapted for the dependency parsing
include cross-lingual word cluster features (Täckström et al., 2012), multilingual word
embeddings (Guo et al., 2015, 2016; Ammar et al., 2016b,a) and language identification
embeddings (Naseem et al., 2012; Ammar et al., 2016a).

From the perspective of code-switching, conversational code-switching problems
have been studied mainly with regard to language identification (e.g. Solorio et al.,
2014; Barman et al., 2014) and information extraction (e.g. Sharma et al., 2014) prob-
lems. This is because in order to process cross-lingual dependency parsing, language
identification and morphological analysis for those languages must precede the pro-
cessing. Ammar et al. (2016b) suggested that his multilingual model-transfer parser
could be used to parse input with code-switching but were not able to conduct the
experiment due to the lack appropriate test corpora.

4 Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing
In this study, we invested our effort in developing the cross-lingual representation
learning method with lexicalized features for the dependency parsing of code-switch-
ing scenarios. All the cross-lingual approaches discussed in Section 3, can be applied
for our study, but in terms of the availability of language resources, cross-lingual
representation learning is considered the best choice because of the lack of annotated
corpora. Also in regard to the performance, existing studies have already shown that
representation learning with lexical features performs better than the other models
(Ammar et al., 2016a; Lim and Poibeau, 2017).

In this section, we describe two main ideas for parsing code-switching data using
the cross-lingual representation learning approach. One of the main goals of our
research is to build cross-lingual word embeddings based on supervised learning. The
other is to find a way to address adapting cross-lingual word embedding in order to
build a dependency parsing model.

4.1 Cross-Lingual Word Representations

As discussed in Section 3, adding lexical information for feature representations can
improve performance in cross-lingual parsing. Various approaches have been inves-
tigated for the training of cross-lingual word embeddings mainly for resource-rich
languages. Moreover, most of these approaches relied on the existence of a paral-
lel corpus, especially for languages from the Indo-European family (cf. Ammar et al.,
2016a; Guo et al., 2016). As we discussed earlier, however, this study focuses on code-
switching scenarios in low-resource language data. Thus, we are constrained by the
fact that there is no parallel corpus and no larger annotated dataset for training a
dependency parser for the (low-resource) target language Komi. However, it must
be noted that even for low-resource languages, we need raw texts as the minimum
resource to train a word embedding. In this study, we trained a monolingual embed-
ding for Komi by using raw text available in the public domain. The Komi texts used
have been taken from the National Library of Finland’s Fenno-Ugrica collection⁴, and
proofread versions of those Public Domain texts are available in FU-Lab’s portal Komi
Nebögain⁵. Niko Partanen has created a list of books included both in Fenno-Ugrica
and FU-Lab⁶, and the currently available data adds up to one million tokens. For
the contact language Russian we have used pre-trained Wikipedia word embeddings
published by Facebook and described in Bojanowski et al. (2016).

In a similar manner to the low-resource constraints, Artetxe et al. (2017) sug-
gested a powerful method for projecting two monolingual embeddings in a single
vector space with almost no bilingual data. Traditionally, the projection (or mapping)
method for word embeddings requires a large parallel corpus or a bilingual dictio-
nary in order to map two different word embeddings in a distributional space (Artetxe
et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2015). However, Artetxe et al. (2017) showed a possible method
for mapping two different embeddings based on the reinforcement learning approach
with just 25 pairs of vocabularies but with almost no degradation of performance. The
main idea in this method is to project two embeddings trained by different languages
based on the linear transformation with bilingual word pairs.

The projection method can be described as follows. Let X and Y be the source
and target word embedding matrix so that xi refers to ith word embedding of X and
yj refers to jth word embedding of Y. And let D is a binary matrix, where Dij = 1, if
x i and yj are aligned. Our goal is then to find a transformation matrix W such that
Wx approximates y. This is done by minimizing the sum of squared errors (following
Artetxe et al., 2017), cf. 7.

The method is relatively simple to apply in our case because once we have a bilin-
gual dictionary available, converting the dictionary asD is not a problem. We followed
Artetxe’s 2017 mapping idea to train a bilingual word embedding for Komi-Russian
using a bilingual dictionary. The size of the dictionary used for training is 7,642 pairs,
and the projected word embedding is 5.9G. Those dictionaries and projected word

embedding are accessible in a public repository.⁷ Dictionary is extracted from Jack
Rueter’s Komi-Zyrian dictionaries that have translations to several languages.⁸

4.2 Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing Model

As discussed in Section 3, the major idea of the cross-lingual representation learning
method is to take aligned features, especially syntactic and lexical features. Since the
Universal Dependencies (UD) (Nivre et al., 2017) model provides cross-linguistically
consistent grammatical annotation, we do not need to consider aligning syntactic
features among the languages (i.g., POS tags, dependency tags). However, in terms of
the semantic point of view, ignoring lexical features may lead to a lack of semantic
information not only in monolingual but also in multilingual dependency parsing.

A recent multilingual parsing experiment, the CoNLL 2017 shared task, has ad-
dressed dependency parsing for low-resource languages using amultilingual approach
(Zeman et al., 2017). The main approach was cross-lingual representation learning,
andmost teams applied the delexicalizedmodel to process the low-resource languages
with around 20 samples of annotated sentences. However, the LATTICE team (Lim
and Poibeau, 2017) suggested concatenating a bilingual word embedding as a lexical-
ized feature, which is mapped by a bilingual dictionary taken from Swadesh lists. In
practice larger dictionaries would improve the result, and this has been done later, but
the shared task had strictly specified resources. On the other hand, a small dictionary
seems to be enough to align the embeddings reasonably well. All features, including
lexicalized ones, are then fed into a bidirectional Long Short-TermMemory (LSTM) to
take concatenated feature representations for each token. By using the concatenated
features (vectors) as an input, Lim and Poibeau applied graph-based parsing, which
views the parsing problem as a search for the best-scored tree graph.

As Lim and Poibeau (2017) suggested, the BiLSTM feature representation with lex-
icalized features is crucial for multilingual dependency parsing, particularly in low-
resource scenarios. Since we assume that there are no UD corpora for low-resource
languages, one common alternative approach is to take a training corpus from an-
other language. Once we find a grammatically related language, we then simply train
a dependency model with the mapped bilingual word embedding and a UD corpus of
the related language. Although the training corpus is written in the related language,
the system is possible to replace tokens with ones from the low-resource language
by using pre-trained bilingual word embeddings, in which vocabulary items with the
same meaning are mapped between two languages. LSTM is a specific type of Recur-
rent Neural Network (RNN), so it also has hidden layer with hidden vectors for each
sequence, h = (h₁,h₂,…,hn). If we look at the hidden layer in a sequence i, it is defined
as in 8.

(8) hi = (Wthti + Whhhi₋₁ + bh)

The basic LSTM model is able to make use of the previous context based on the
computation Whhhi₋₁ (to put it simply, we can think of Whh as a hidden input weight
matrix and hi₋₁ as the previous value of the hidden layer). Thus, BiLSTM can store con-
texts from the LSTMboth in regular order (LSTMfₒrwₐrd) and inverse order (LSTMbₐckwₐrd).
For further details on the LSTM model, see Huang et al. (2015) and Cho (2015).

For the current study, we have extended the parser by Lim and Poibeau (2017)
using the multilingual word embeddings proposed in Section 4.1. The bilingual dic-
tionaries used in the word embedding alignment contained several thousands of word
pairs, and the recent study by Artetxe et al. (2017) shows that the dictionary size we
operate with should be large enough to reach a high level of alignment accuracy.

5 Experiment Design
The following section discusses in more detail the creation and use of the corpora used
for training and testing.

5.1 Training Corpora

Theapplied tools have been developed specifically for parsing low-resource languages,
and this study originates from the same background. The main part of training data
consists of a Russian UD v2.0 corpuswith 3,850 sentences⁹, while the Komi part, which
we have prepared, is only 40 sentences.

5.2 Testing Corpora

The early-stage Komi-Zyrian Universal Dependency corpus was used for the model
training¹⁰, as this makes the results comparable with our earlier studies and was read-
ily available. All in all, the tests in this studywere performed on three different subsets
or variants of test corpora, which are described below. All of the data used is publicly
available in the IWCLUL branch of the repository.

1. Monolingual written Komi test corpus: 80 sentences

2. Multilingual written Komi-Russian test corpus, based on the monolingual cor-
pus but adapted to contain constructions comparable to those that occur in spo-
ken data: 80 sentences

3. SpokenKomi test corpus, contains spontaneous code-switching and code-mixing:
25 sentences

Similar to our earlier research, the monolingual Komi testing corpus was used as
onemethod for evaluating the baseline for the results. Another Komi corpus currently
being built will eventually includemore spoken data, however it is not directly compa-
rable with the monolingual testing corpus as the examples are entirely different. The
spoken language data, although dialectal, is still phonologically and morphologically
close to the written language, and in this case the data were slightly normalized in or-
der to harmonize the transcription conventions with the orthographic representation
in the written corpora used.

As the kinds of constructions we were interested in analyzing tend to occur only
in spontaneous spoken language, it was not possible to use a parallel corpus of writ-
ten texts to compare the performance as such. Instead, another approach was adopted
in which the code-switching-like elements were inserted into an originally monolin-
gual testing corpus. It must be stressed that the Russian elements were not inserted

randomly, but were carefully crafted to follow patterns observed in the real spoken
data. The creation of mixed test corpus was helped by the large number of available
translations for the texts used. To illustrate this, we can take one sentence that is part
of the testing corpus:

(9) Шофер-ыс,
driver-3sg

том
young

зонка
boy

на,
still

дзик-ӧдз
totally-term

растеряйтч-ис
get_confused-pst.3sg

.

‘Driver, still a young boy, got totally confused.’

As the same source book has translations into multiple minority languages of Rus-
sia, with the original Russian version, there is always access to multilingual versions
of the same text segments. In this case the Russian version is as presented below:

(10) Водитель
driver

машин-ы,
car-gen

еще
still

молодой
young

парнишка,
boy

совсем
totally

растеря-л-ся.
get_confused-pst.refl

‘Driver, still a young boy, got totally confused.’

With translations available, it is possible to compare the examples into occur-
rences that there are in spoken language corpus that naturally contains intermixed
Russian. Although the details vary, we can at least add pointers into example sen-
tences in spoken corpus that contain comparable occurrences, although they naturally
would never be identical, or comparable from only one point of view. The example
sentence above has been restructured in following way, Russian in bold:

(11) Шофер-ыс,
driver-3sg

том
young

зонка
boy

на,
still

совсем
totally

растеря-л-ся.
get_confused-pst-refl

‘Driver, still a young boy, got totally confused.’

The acceptability of the adapted sentences can be justified at least partly by the
test corpus design, of which up to 35% originates from texts that have parallel variants
in Russian. This has been very useful in order to examine how similar the sentences
would be in different languages. Additionally, 40% of the testing corpus has been
translated from Komi into Russian. In the majority of cases, the basic structure has
indeed been so similar that the Russian and Komi versions should, to a large extent,
display identical dependency structures with core relations, although the details still
differ substantially. It is left outside the current investigation whether the translations
that are present are the most natural ways to express these ideas in either of the
languages, as the goal was primarily evaluate how the parser behaves in this kind of
scenario.

In order to make these decisions explicit, the mixed corpus version has an addi-
tional metadata field spoken_comparison, which contains a link to the IKPD corpus of
spoken language recordings that exhibits comparable Russian constructions. In this
case we have pointed into examples where Russian adverb совсем is used on place of
native Komi дзик, as well as recordings that exhibit insertions of Russian verb forms.
The examples are not supposed to be identical, but illustrate that the modification
bears some connection to what can be observed in real data. Some of the observed
phenomena are relatively rare (although present) in Komi, but are described as com-
mon in other Uralic languages, such as Erzya, by Janurik (2017). The presence of



10

Russian items and their different types in either natural or artificial test corpora does
not reflect the frequencies with which they occur larger spoken corpus, as no studies
have been conducted that would provide metrics that could be used.

It has to be emphasized that the goal of this exercise has not been to create new
data that would be directly useful for any other purposes, but to have a dataset that
is comparable to the monolingual test corpus, and would be close enough to realistic
phenomena that we observe in spoken data that we can use it to evaluate the parser’s
behaviour.

One of the available metrics comes from on-going research in which the items
of Russian origin have been tagged in different text types. This examination shows
that the rate of Russian items was, depending on the speaker, somewhere between
20%-40%, which is similar to the proportions used here.

6 Evaluation Strategy
The results are evaluated according to their LAS and UAS scores, but in order to
analyze more precisely how the parser interacts with the constructions specific to
Komi and Russian, we have examined some of these constructions in further detail.
The recognition accuracy is also calculated separately for each dependency relation
type. For evaluation purposes, the languages have been tagged into the misc-field of
CONLL-U files, but the parser has not been aware of this information, and it is used
only for evaluation.

There is a small portion of tokens occurring in the Komi corpus that are identical
in form and function with corresponding Russian items. These are mainly particles
and conjunctions. In the misc-field of the test corpus, these items have been classified
with the tag ”mixed”, as their form and function are nearly identical in both languages.
In addition to this, the ”mixed” category also contains tokens that cannot be clearly
defined as lexical items of either Komi or Russian, such as non-adapted Russian verb
stems with Komi inflections.

Note that our analysis of a ”mixed” category is also in line with the recent sociolin-
guistic description of similar contact-induced phenomena in Erzya (Janurik, 2017, 64,
89). According to this study, distinguishing between borrowing and code-switching
is often very difficult in the case of Erzya and Russian. The same criteria seem to
apply with regard to Komi-Russian language contact as well. Recent borrowings not
displaying clear Russian morphology have therefore also been tagged as mixed, as
the lack of phonological adaptation often makes them identical to the Russian alter-
natives, and using the Russian origin as the main criteria seems perfectly sensible.

The tokens that are unambiguously Russian and exhibit Russian morphology are
tagged as Russian, so that it is possible to compare these parts of the corpus. The
percentages of different languages across the testing corpora is as follows in Table 1.

The accuracy is also evaluated independently for a few grammatical structures
in which the constituent order or relation type would differ in the two languages. In
Komi noun phrases, nouns modify other nouns directly in the nominative, whereas in
Russian, this would be accomplished using derived adjectives. In possessive construc-
tions, the languages employ opposite strategies: possessor–possessed in Komi and
possessed–possessor in Russian. Due the restrictions on the training data, it would
be assumed that the parser would be more sensitive towards the Russian strategies,
as the exposure to the Komi patterns has been minimal.

When evaluating the results, the possibility of mistakes remaining in training and

testing data itself cannot be excluded. As there are very few annotated datasets for
Komi, it is not always perfectly clear what would be the most adequate annotation or
relation in every case. Further work with Universal Dependencies on smaller Uralic
languages will certainly shed light also into best ways to analyze Komi data.

7 Results
The LAS and UAS scores of the tested corpora are presented in Table 2. The results
varied significantly by epoch, and all tests were run for 10 iterations. The differences
were particularly large within the spoken corpus, as the parsing accuracy of individ-
ual sentences had direct relation to the scores as whole, just because the number of
analyzed tokens was so small. Addition of individual sentences would make scores
fluctuate very much, whereas other corpora behave more consistently, which indi-
cates that test corpus of approximately hundred sentences in the test corpus seems to
be enough for consistency in results.

The test corpora containing more Russian produce slightly better results. The
reason seems to be that the parser is more sensitive towards recognizing Russian, as
both Russian training corpus and the word embedding used are significantly larger.
Indeed, when the parser is run on the identical settings to Russian test corpus, the
LAS score is almost 70,00. This happens even under scenario where the parser is
specifically targeted to parse Komi, and will first try to look for tokens from Komi
part of word embedding. The examination of language-tagged tokens showed that
the dependency relation types were analyzed correctly on average 10% more often
on Russian tokens than with Komi tokens. The difference in recognizing heads was
even higher in favor of Russian. This seems to reflect the generally higher accuracy
in respect to Russian, which is explainable by the larger resource portions used in
training. On the other hand, preliminary tests done after the research for this paper
was conducted indicated that simply building the Komi word embeddings from larger
text corpus would improve the monolingual Komi score and bring those closer to one
another.

One way to test the cross-linguistic applicability of the parser is to look into con-
structions that are specific only to one of the languages. Earlier mentioned uses of
prepositions and postpositions in Russian and Komi seem to be properly recognized.
In the manually mixed test corpus half of the adpositions were in Komi and half in
Russian (13/13), and in the best epochs they contained only individual errors. The
roots were located correctly 80% if the time. Table 3 presents the accuracy percent-
ages for different dependencies in monolingual and mixed test corpora in . The spo-
ken corpora is not presented here due to its small size and thereby sporadic number
of different relations.

Table 3: The comparison to processed results between regular Komi corpus (Komi
only) and the code-switching corpus (Artificially mixed corpus) for each dependency
relations.

It seems that the rarer dependencies are also generally poorer in their accuracy,
with many never being recognized correctly. As this is evaluation of just the best
epoch, the accuracy of zero doesn’t mean that the parser would never recognize this
relation, but the poor accuracy seems to be consistent across tests. This may be con-
nected to the small size of Komi training corpus which contained only 40 sentences,
and thereby there are lots of relations which occur only sporadically there as well.
However, the table Table 3 also shows that with some relations the accuracy is much



13

better than for others.
One reason for high accuracy with adpositions could be explained by their very

high frequency and relatively small number of distinct forms. Some attention has to be
paid into the situationwith obliques, which are almost uniformly parsed incorrectly in
Komi test corpus. Within the Russian part of the mixed corpus the recognition accu-
racy increases, and this gain comes from the Russian part. In Komi part of the corpus
obliques are most commonly parsed as nominal subjects. Across all training epochs
this is most commonly mis-identified relation. Within Russian part the obliques are
generally parsed correctly. In case of Russian the obliques are usually marked with
prepositions and distinct case such as prepositional or dative.

In the monolingual Komi corpus and in Komi part of the mixed corpora very fre-
quently mis-parsed relation was nominal subjects being analyzed as nominal modi-
fiers. Right after this comes the analysis of nominal objects as nominal subjects.

Some of the results match fit typological differences between Komi and Russian.
For example, noun modifiers in certain contexts were recognized much worse than
could be expected. Even when constructions share lexical items with Russian, the
parser systematically recognizes the first element as the head, probably reflecting Rus-
sian pattern where the order would be reversed, or the first component be an adjective
and the relation thus amod instead of nmod.

As mentioned above, the adpositions were generally parsed correctly, irrespec-
tive оf their language or direction. There were individual Komi postpositions which
seemed to be often parsed incorrectly, but these were either used in non-prototypical
way or were relatively rare otherwise. So rarer types were recognized worse, which
may be related to the general difficulties in recognizing obliques as well, as those have
hardly any prototypical form in which they appear in Komi.

8 Conclusion
According to our analysis, the Multilingual BIST-parser described in Lim and Poibeau
(2017) is able to parsewith comparable accuracymonolingual data and code-switching
data. The analysis of parsing result of different dependency relation labels showed
that some are recognized considerably more often than others, and especially with
rarer relations the accuracy is suffering. There are some relations which show large
differences between language pairs used in model training, such as obliques, but also
cross-linguistically differently behaving categories, for example adpositions, which
are recognized considerably well even when they occur in same sentences in code-
switching data.

At the moment the main reason for relatively poor accuracy seems to be a lack
of larger training corpus. At the moment the training has been done only with 40
sentences, which is by any standards very little. However, it is so small that compa-
rable dataset could be easily created for virtually any language, and thereby the results
are encouraging for extending this approach to new languages. Another aspect that
needs more rigorous testing is the alignation and quality of word embeddings used.
The currently used Komi embedding was built from onemillion token text corpus, and
possibly an increase in the embedding size could already bring improvements to the
performance. On the other hand, also Russian embeddings, although large, are from
Wikipedia and could be improved by including wider variety of text types. Evaluating
the minimum size that is needed for embeddings is also important in order to estimate
how well suited the proposed method is for low-resource languages.



14

One additional concern is that as all training data and word embeddings are based
on written data. Thereby there are many features of spoken language, such as dis-
course particles, which occur rarely if at all in any of these sources, even when the
corpora would be relatively large. Although the discourse particles were in this case
analyzed better than majority of the relations, there are still certainly numerous con-
structions that tend to occur mainly in spoken data. One of these are particular mixed
forms which are likely never found in monolingual resources of these two languages,
and thereby cannot directly benefit from the method tested in this paper. The IKDP
Komi corpus counts approximately 300,000 tokens at present and training new word
embeddings from this data alone doesn’t seem reasonable right now. However, as
regular transcription work increases the corpus size over time, reaching a million or
more tokens should be reasonable in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile further ex-
periments should be conducted on building word embeddings that mix spoken and
written varieties, and thereby also contain spoken data with code-switching. Nat-
urally, increasing the sizes of training and test corpora for Komi is also a foremost
priority for our own future research.
