Abstract
Automatic machine learning systems can in-
advertently accentuate and perpetuate inappro-
priate human biases. Past work on examin-
ing inappropriate biases has largely focused
on just individual systems. Further, there is
no benchmark dataset for examining inappro-
priate biases in systems. Here for the first
time, we present the Equity Evaluation Cor-
pus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English
sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases
towards certain races and genders. We use
the dataset to examine 219 automatic senti-
ment analysis systems that took part in a re-
cent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 ‘Affect
in Tweets’. We find that several of the systems
show statistically significant bias; that is, they
consistently provide slightly higher sentiment
intensity predictions for one race or one gen-
der. We make the EEC freely available.

1 Introduction

Automatic systems have had a significant and ben-
eficial impact on all walks of human life. So
much so that it is easy to overlook their potential
to benefit society by promoting equity, diversity,
and fairness. For example, machines do not take
bribes to do their jobs, they can determine eligi-
bility for a loan without being influenced by the
color of the applicant’s skin, and they can pro-
vide access to information and services without
discrimination based on gender or sexual orien-
tation. Nonetheless, as machine learning systems
become more human-like in their predictions, they
can also perpetuate human biases. Some learned
biases may be beneficial for the downstream appli-
cation (e.g., learning that humans often use some
insect names, such as spider or cockroach, to refer
to unpleasant situations). Other biases can be in-
appropriate and result in negative experiences for
some groups of people. Examples include, loan el-
igibility and crime recidivism prediction systems

that negatively assess people belonging to a cer-
tain pin/zip code (which may disproportionately
impact people of a certain race) (Chouldechova,
2017) and resumé sorting systems that believe that
men are more qualified to be programmers than
women (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Similarly, senti-
ment and emotion analysis systems can also per-
petuate and accentuate inappropriate human bi-
ases, e.g., systems that consider utterances from
one race or gender to be less positive simply be-
cause of their race or gender, or customer support
systems that prioritize a call from an angry male
over a call from the equally angry female.

Predictions of machine learning systems have
also been shown to be of higher quality when deal-
ing with information from some groups of people
as opposed to other groups of people. For exam-
ple, in the area of computer vision, gender clas-
sification systems perform particularly poorly for
darker skinned females (Buolamwini and Gebru,
2018). Natural language processing (NLP) sys-
tems have been shown to be poor in understanding
text produced by people belonging to certain races
(Blodgett et al., 2016; Jurgens et al., 2017). For
NLP systems, the sources of the bias often include
the training data, other corpora, lexicons, and
word embeddings that the machine learning algo-
rithm may leverage to build its prediction model.

Even though there is some recent work high-
lighting such inappropriate biases (such as the
work mentioned above), each such past work has
largely focused on just one or two systems and re-
sources. Further, there is no benchmark dataset
for examining inappropriate biases in natural lan-
guage systems. In this paper, we describe how
we compiled a dataset of 8,640 English sentences
carefully chosen to tease out biases towards cer-
tain races and genders. We will refer to it as
the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC). We used
the EEC as a supplementary test set in a recent

43



shared task on predicting sentiment and emotion
intensity in tweets, SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect
in Tweets (Mohammad et al., 2018).1 In partic-
ular, we wanted to test a hypothesis that a sys-
tem should equally rate the intensity of the emo-
tion expressed by two sentences that differ only in
the gender/race of a person mentioned. Note that
here the term system refers to the combination of a
machine learning architecture trained on a labeled
dataset, and possibly using additional language re-
sources. The bias can originate from any or several
of these parts. We were thus able to use the EEC to
examine 219 sentiment analysis systems that took
part in the shared task.

We compare emotion and sentiment intensity
scores that the systems predict on pairs of sen-
tences in the EEC that differ only in one word cor-
responding to race or gender (e.g., ‘This man made
me feel angry’ vs. ‘This woman made me feel an-
gry’). We find that the majority of the systems
studied show statistically significant bias; that is,
they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment
intensity predictions for sentences associated with
one race or one gender. We also find that the bias
may be different depending on the particular af-
fect dimension that the natural language system is
trained to predict.

Despite the work we describe here and what
others have proposed in the past, it should be noted
that there are no simple solutions for dealing with
inappropriate human biases that percolate into ma-
chine learning systems. It seems difficult to ever
be able to identify and quantify all of the inap-
propriate biases perfectly (even when restricted to
the scope of just gender and race). Further, any
such mechanism is liable to be circumvented, if
one chooses to do so. Nonetheless, as developers
of sentiment analysis systems, and NLP systems
more broadly, we cannot absolve ourselves of the
ethical implications of the systems we build. Even
if it is unclear how we should deal with the inap-
propriate biases in our systems, we should be mea-
suring such biases. The Equity Evaluation Corpus
is not meant to be a catch-all for all inappropri-
ate biases, but rather just one of the several ways
by which we can examine the fairness of sentiment
analysis systems. We make the corpus freely avail-
able so that both developers and users can use it,
and build on it.2

2 Related Work

Recent studies have demonstrated that the systems
trained on the human-written texts learn human-
like biases (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan
et al., 2017). In general, any predictive model
built on historical data may inadvertently in-
herit human biases based on gender, ethnicity,
race, or religion (Sweeney, 2013; Datta et al.,
2015). Discrimination-aware data mining focuses
on measuring discrimination in data as well as on
evaluating performance of discrimination-aware
predictive models (Zliobaite, 2015; Pedreshi et al.,
2008; Hajian and Domingo-Ferrer, 2013; Goh
et al., 2016).

In NLP, the attention so far has been primar-
ily on word embeddings—a popular and powerful
framework to represent words as low-dimensional
dense vectors. The word embeddings are usually
obtained from large amounts of human-written
texts, such as Wikipedia, Google News articles,
or millions of tweets. Bias in sentiment analysis
systems has only been explored in simple systems
that make use of pre-computed word embeddings
(Speer, 2017). There is no prior work that sys-
tematically quantifies the extent of bias in a large
number of sentiment analysis systems.

This paper does not examine the differences in
accuracies of systems on text produced by differ-
ent races or genders, as was done by Hovy (2015);
Blodgett et al. (2016); Jurgens et al. (2017); Buo-
lamwini and Gebru (2018). Approaches on how
to mitigate inappropriate biases (Schmidt, 2015;
Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Kilbertus et al., 2017; Ryu
et al., 2017; Speer, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao
et al., 2018) are also beyond the scope of this pa-
per. See also the position paper by Hovy and
Spruit (2016), which identifies socio-ethical im-
plications of the NLP systems in general.

3 The Equity Evaluation Corpus

We now describe how we compiled a dataset of
thousands of sentences to determine whether auto-
matic systems consistently give higher (or lower)
sentiment intensity scores to sentences involving a
particular race or gender. There are several ways
in which such a dataset may be compiled. We
present below the choices that we made.3

3Even though the emotion intensity task motivated some
of the choices in creating the dataset, the dataset can be used
to examine bias in other NLP systems as well.

Total 8,640

Table 1: Sentence templates used in this study.

We decided to use sentences involving at least
one race- or gender-associated word. The sen-
tences were intended to be short and grammati-
cally simple. We also wanted some sentences
to include expressions of sentiment and emotion,
since the goal is to test sentiment and emotion sys-
tems. We, the authors of this paper, developed
eleven sentence templates after several rounds
of discussion and consensus building. They are
shown in Table 1. The templates are divided into
two groups. The first type (templates 1–7) in-
cludes emotion words. The purpose of this set is to
have sentences expressing emotions. The second
type (templates 8–11) does not include any emo-
tion words. The purpose of this set is to have non-
emotional (neutral) sentences.

The templates include two variables: <person>
and <emotion word>. We generate sentences
from the template by instantiating each variable
with one of the pre-chosen values that the variable
can take. Each of the eleven templates includes
the variable <person>. <person> can be instan-
tiated by any of the following noun phrases:

• Common African American female or male
first names; Common European American
female or male first names;

• Noun phrases referring to females, such as ‘my
daughter’; and noun phrases referring to males,
such as ‘my son’.

For our study, we chose ten names of each kind
from the study by Caliskan et al. (2017) (see Ta-
ble 2). The full lists of noun phrases representing
females and males, used in our study, are shown in
Table 3.

Table 3: Pairs of noun phrases representing a female
or a male person used in this study.

The second variable, <emotion word>, has two
variants. Templates one through four include a
variable for an emotional state word. The emo-
tional state words correspond to four basic emo-
tions: anger, fear, joy, and sadness. Specifically,
for each of the emotions, we selected five words
that convey that emotion in varying intensities.
These words were taken from the categories in the
Roget’s Thesaurus corresponding to the four emo-
tions: category #900 Resentment (for anger), cat-
egory #860 Fear (for fear), category #836 Cheer-
fulness (for joy), and category #837 Dejection (for
sadness).4 Templates five through seven include
emotion words describing a situation or event.
These words were also taken from the same the-
saurus categories listed above. The full lists of
emotion words (emotional state words and emo-
tional situation/event words) are shown in Table 4.

We generated sentences from the templates by
replacing <person> and <emotion word> vari-
ables with the values they can take. In total, 8,640
sentences were generated with the various combi-
nations of <person> and <emotion word> values
across the eleven templates. We manually exam-

4The Roget’s Thesaurus groups words into about 1000
categories. The head word is the word that best represents
the meaning of the words within the category. Each category
has on average about 100 closely related words.

matically well-formed.5 Notably, one can derive
pairs of sentences from the EEC such that they
differ only in one word corresponding to gender
or race (e.g., ‘My daughter feels devastated’ and
‘My son feels devastated’). We refer to the full set
of 8,640 sentences as Equity Evaluation Corpus.

4 Measuring Race and Gender Bias in
Automatic Sentiment Analysis Systems

The race and gender bias evaluation was carried
out on the output of the 219 automatic systems
that participated in SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect
in Tweets (Mohammad et al., 2018).6 The shared
task included five subtasks on inferring the affec-
tual state of a person from their tweet: 1. emotion
intensity regression, 2. emotion intensity ordinal
classification, 3. valence (sentiment) regression,
4. valence ordinal classification, and 5. emotion
classification. For each subtask, labeled data were
provided for English, Arabic, and Spanish. The
race and gender bias were analyzed for the system
outputs on two English subtasks: emotion inten-
sity regression (for anger, fear, joy, and sadness)
and valence regression. These regression tasks
were formulated as follows: Given a tweet and an
affective dimension A (anger, fear, joy, sadness,
or valence), determine the intensity of A that best
represents the mental state of the tweeter—a real-
valued score between 0 (least A) and 1 (most A).
Separate training and test datasets were provided
for each affective dimension.

5In particular, we replaced ‘she’ (‘he’) with ‘her’ (‘him’)
when the <person> variable was the object (rather than the
subject) in a sentence (e.g., ‘I made her feel angry.’). Also,
we replaced the article ‘a’ with ‘an’ when it appeared before
a word that started with a vowel sound (e.g., ‘in an annoying
situation’).

6This is a follow up to the WASSA-2017 shared task on
emotion intensities (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017).

Training sets included tweets along with gold
intensity scores. Two test sets were provided
for each task: 1. a regular tweet test set (for
which the gold intensity scores are known but
not revealed to the participating systems), and
2. the Equity Evaluation Corpus (for which no
gold intensity labels exist). Participants were told
that apart from the usual test set, they are to run
their systems on a separate test set of unknown
origin.7 The participants were instructed to train
their system on the tweets training sets provided,
and that they could use any other resources they
may find or create. They were to run the same
final system on the two test sets. The nature of the
second test set was revealed to them only after the
competition. The first (tweets) test set was used
to evaluate and rank the quality (accuracy) of the
systems’ predictions. The second (EEC) test set
was used to perform the bias analysis, which is
the focus of this paper.
Systems: Fifty teams submitted their system out-
puts to one or more of the five emotion inten-
sity regression tasks (for anger, fear, joy, sadness,
and valence), resulting in 219 submissions in to-
tal. Many systems were built using two types
of features: deep neural network representations
of tweets (sentence embeddings) and features de-
rived from existing sentiment and emotion lexi-
cons. These features were then combined to learn
a model using either traditional machine learning
algorithms (such as SVM/SVR and Logistic Re-
gression) or deep neural networks. SVM/SVR,
LSTMs, and Bi-LSTMs were some of the most
widely used machine learning algorithms. The
sentence embeddings were obtained by training a
neural network on the provided training data, a
distant supervision corpus (e.g., AIT2018 Distant
Supervision Corpus that has tweets with emotion-
related query terms), sentiment-labeled tweet cor-
pora (e.g., Semeval-2017 Task4A dataset on senti-
ment analysis in Twitter), or by using pre-trained
models (e.g., DeepMoji (Felbo et al., 2017), Skip
thoughts (Kiros et al., 2015)). The lexicon fea-
tures were often derived from the NRC emo-
tion and sentiment lexicons (Mohammad and Tur-
ney, 2013; Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Mohammad,
2018), AFINN (Nielsen, 2011), and Bing Liu Lex-
icon (Hu and Liu, 2004).

7The terms and conditions of the competition also stated
that the organizers could do any kind of analysis on their sys-
tem predictions. Participants had to explicitly agree to the
terms to access the data and participate.

46



We provided a baseline SVM system trained
using word unigrams as features on the training
data (SVM-Unigrams). This system is also
included in the current analysis.
Measuring bias: To examine gender bias, we
compared each system’s predicted scores on the
EEC sentence pairs as follows:

• We compared the predicted intensity score for
a sentence generated from a template using a
female noun phrase (e.g., ‘The conversation
with my mom was heartbreaking’) with the
predicted score for a sentence generated from
the same template using the corresponding
male noun phrase (e.g., ‘The conversation with
my dad was heartbreaking’).
• For the sentences involving female and male

first names, we compared the average predicted
score for a set of sentences generated from a
template using each of the female first names
(e.g., ‘The conversation with Amanda was
heartbreaking’) with the average predicted
score for a set of sentences generated from
the same template using each of the male first
names (e.g., ‘The conversation with Alonzo was
heartbreaking’).

Thus, eleven pairs of scores (ten pairs of scores
from ten noun phrase pairs and one pair of scores
from the averages on name subsets) were exam-
ined for each template–emotion word instantia-
tion. There were twenty different emotion words
used in seven templates (templates 1–7), and no
emotion words used in the four remaining tem-
plates (templates 8–11). In total, 11 × (20 × 7 +
4) = 1, 584 pairs of scores were compared.

Similarly, to examine race bias, we compared
pairs of system predicted scores as follows:
• We compared the average predicted score for

a set of sentences generated from a template
using each of the African American first names,
both female and male, (e.g., ‘The conversation
with Ebony was heartbreaking’) with the
average predicted score for a set of sentences
generated from the same template using each of
the European American first names (e.g., ‘The
conversation with Amanda was heartbreaking’).

Thus, one pair of scores was examined for each
template–emotion word instantiation. In total, 1×
(20×7+4) = 144 pairs of scores were compared.

For each system, we calculated the paired two
sample t-test to determine whether the mean dif-
ference between the two sets of scores (across the

two races and across the two genders) is signifi-
cant. We set the significance level to 0.05. How-
ever, since we performed 438 assessments (219
submissions evaluated for biases in both gender
and race), we applied Bonferroni correction. The
null hypothesis that the true mean difference be-
tween the paired samples was zero was rejected if
the calculated p-value fell below 0.05/438.

5 Results

The two sub-sections below present the results
from the analysis for gender bias and race bias,
respectively.

5.1 Gender Bias Results
Individual submission results were communicated
to the participants. Here, we present the summary
results across all the teams. The goal of this
analysis is to gain a better understanding of biases
across a large number of current sentiment anal-
ysis systems. Thus, we partition the submissions
into three groups according to the bias they show:
• F=M not significant: submissions that showed

no statistically significant difference in intensity
scores predicted for corresponding female and
male noun phrase sentences,
• F↑–M↓ significant: submissions that consis-

tently gave higher scores for sentences with
female noun phrases than for corresponding
sentences with male noun phrases,
• F↓–M↑ significant: submissions that consis-

tently gave lower scores for sentences with
female noun phrases than for corresponding
sentences with male noun phrases.

For each system and each sentence pair, we
calculate the score difference ∆ as the score for
the female noun phrase sentence minus the score
for the corresponding male noun phrase sentence.
Table 5 presents the summary results for each of
the bias groups. It has the following columns:
• #Subm.: number of submissions in each group.

If all the systems are unbiased, then the number
of submissions for the group F=M not signifi-
cant would be the maximum, and the number of
submissions in all other groups would be zero.
• Avg. score difference F↑–M↓: the average ∆

for only those pairs where the score for the
female noun phrase sentence is higher. The
greater the magnitude of this score, the stronger
the bias in systems that consistently give higher
scores to female-associated sentences.

Table 5: Analysis of gender bias: Summary results
for 219 submissions from 50 teams on the Equity Eval-
uation Corpus (including both sentences with emotion
words and sentences without emotion words).

• Avg. score difference F↓–M↑: the average ∆
for only those pairs where the score for the
female noun phrase sentence is lower. The
greater the magnitude of this score, the stronger
the bias in systems that consistently give lower
scores to female-associated sentences.

Note that these numbers were first calculated sepa-
rately for each submission, and then averaged over
all the submissions within each submission group.
The results are reported separately for submissions
to each task (anger, fear, joy, sadness, and senti-
ment/valence intensity prediction).

Observe that on the four emotion intensity pre-
diction tasks, only about 12 of the 46 submissions
(about 25% of the submissions) showed no statis-
tically significant score difference. On the valence
prediction task, only 5 of the 36 submissions (14%
of the submissions) showed no statistically signif-
icant score difference. Thus 75% to 86% of the
submissions consistently marked sentences of one
gender higher than another.

When predicting anger, joy, or valence, the
number of systems consistently giving higher
scores to sentences with female noun phrases (21–
25) is markedly higher than the number of systems
giving higher scores to sentences with male noun
phrases (8–13). (Recall that higher valence means

more positive sentiment.) In contrast, on the fear
task, most submissions tended to assign higher
scores to sentences with male noun phrases (23) as
compared to the number of systems giving higher
scores to sentences with female noun phrases (12).
When predicting sadness, the number of submis-
sions that mostly assigned higher scores to sen-
tences with female noun phrases (18) is close to
the number of submissions that mostly assigned
higher scores to sentences with male noun phrases
(16). These results are in line with some com-
mon stereotypes, such as females are more emo-
tional, and situations involving male agents are
more fearful (Shields, 2002).

Figure 1 shows the score differences (∆) for in-
dividual systems on the valence regression task.
Plots for the four emotion intensity prediction
tasks are available on the project website.8 Each
point (s, t, l) on the plot corresponds to the
difference in scores predicted by the system on
one sentence pair. The systems are ordered by
their rank (from first to last) on the task on the
tweets test sets, as per the official evaluation met-
ric (Spearman correlation with the gold intensity
scores). We will refer to the difference between
the maximal value of ∆ and the minimal value of
∆ for a particular system as the ∆–spread. Ob-
serve that the ∆–spreads for many systems are
rather large, up to 0.57. The top 10 systems as
well as some of the worst performing systems tend
to have smaller ∆–spreads while the systems with
medium to low performance show greater sensi-
tivity to the gender-associated words. Also, most
submissions that showed no statistically signifi-
cant score differences (shown in green) performed
poorly on the tweets test sets. Only three systems
out of the top five on the anger intensity task and
one system on the joy and sadness tasks showed
no statistically significant score difference. This
indicates that when considering only those sys-
tems that performed well on the intensity predic-
tion task, the percentage of gender-biased systems
are even higher than those indicated above.

These results raise further questions such as
‘what exactly is the cause of such biases?’ and
‘why is the bias impacted by the emotion task
under consideration?’. Answering these questions
will require further information on the resources
that the teams used to develop their models, and
we leave that for future work.

Figure 1: Analysis of gender bias: Box plot of the score differences on the gender sentence pairs for each system on the
valence regression task. Each point on the plot corresponds to the difference in scores predicted by the system on one sentence
pair. s represents F↑–M↓ significant group, t represents F↓–M↑ significant group, and l represents F=M not significant
group. For each system, the bottom and top of a grey box are the first and third quartiles, and the band inside the box shows the
second quartile (the median). The whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR = Q3 - Q1) from the edge of the
box. The systems are ordered by rank (from first to last) on the task on the tweets test sets as per the official evaluation metric.

Average score differences: For submissions that
showed statistically significant score differences,
the average score difference F↑–M↓ and the
average score difference F↓–M↑ were ≤ 0.03.
Since the intensity scores range from 0 to 1,
0.03 is 3% of the full range. The maximal score
difference (∆) across all the submissions was
as high as 0.34. Note, however, that these ∆s
are the result of changing just one word in a
sentence. In more complex sentences, several
gender-associated words can appear, which may
have a bigger impact. Also, whether consistent
score differences of this magnitude will have
significant repercussions in downstream applica-
tions, depends on the particular application.
Analyses on only the neutral sentences in EEC
and only the emotional sentences in EEC: We
also performed a separate analysis using only
those sentences from the EEC that included no
emotion words. Recall that there are four tem-
plates that contain no emotion words.9 Tables 6
shows these results. We observe similar trends
as in the analysis on the full set. One noticeable
difference is that the number of submissions that
showed statistically significant score difference is
much smaller for this data subset. However, the
total number of comparisons on the subset (44)
is much smaller than the total number of compar-
isons on the full set (1,584), which makes the sta-
tistical test less powerful. Note also that the av-
erage score differences on the subset (columns 3

parisons (ten paired noun phrases and one pair of averages
from first name sentences).

task were evaluated only on sentences with anger
words). The results (not shown here) were similar
to the results on the full set.

5.2 Race Bias Results

We did a similar analysis for race as we did for
gender. For each submission on each task, we
calculated the difference between the average pre-
dicted score on the set of sentences with African
American (AA) names and the average predicted
score on the set of sentences with European Amer-
ican (EA) names. Then, we aggregated the results
over all such sentence pairs in the EEC.

Table 7 shows the results. The table has the
same form and structure as the gender result ta-
bles. Observe that the number of submissions with
no statistically significant score difference for sen-
tences pertaining to the two races is about 5–11
(about 11% to 24%) for the four emotions and 3
(about 8%) for valence. These numbers are even
lower than what was found for gender.

The majority of the systems assigned higher
scores to sentences with African American names
on the tasks of anger, fear, and sadness intensity
prediction. On the joy and valence tasks, most
submissions tended to assign higher scores to sen-

tences with European American names. These
tendencies reflect some common stereotypes that
associate African Americans with more negative
emotions (Popp et al., 2003).

Figure 2 shows the score differences for individ-
ual systems on race sentence pairs on the valence
regression task. Plots for the four emotion inten-
sity prediction tasks are available on the project
website. Here, the ∆–spreads are smaller than on
the gender sentence pairs—from 0 to 0.15. As in
the gender analysis, on the valence task the top 13
systems as well as some of the worst performing
systems have smaller ∆–spread while the systems
with medium to low performance show greater
sensitivity to the race-associated names. However,
we do not observe the same pattern in the emotion
intensity tasks. Also, similar to the gender analy-
sis, most submissions that showed no statistically
significant score differences obtained lower scores
on the tweets test sets. Only one system out of the
top five showed no statistically significant score
difference on the anger and fear intensity tasks,
and none on the other tasks. Once again, just as
in the case of gender, this raises questions of the
exact causes of such biases. We hope to explore
this in future work.

6 Discussion

As mentioned in the introduction, bias can orig-
inate from any or several parts of a system: the
labeled and unlabeled datasets used to learn differ-
ent parts of the model, the language resources used
(e.g., pre-trained word embeddings, lexicons), the
learning method used (algorithm, features, param-
eters), etc. In our analysis, we found systems
trained using a variety of algorithms (traditional
as well as deep neural networks) and a variety of
language resources showing gender and race bi-
ases. Further experiments may tease out the extent
of bias in each of these parts.

We also analyzed the output of our baseline
SVM system trained using word unigrams (SVM-
Unigrams). The system does not use any language
resources other than the training data. We observe
that this baseline system also shows small bias in
gender and race. The ∆-spreads for this system
were quite small: 0.09 to 0.2 on the gender sen-
tence pairs and less than 0.002 on the race sen-
tence pairs. The predicted intensity scores tended
to be higher on the sentences with male noun
phrases than on the sentences with female noun

phrases for the tasks of anger, fear, and sadness
intensity prediction. This tendency was reversed
on the task of valence prediction. On the race
sentence pairs, the system predicted higher inten-
sity scores on the sentences with European Ameri-
can names for all four emotion intensity prediction
tasks, and on the sentences with African American
names for the task of valence prediction. This in-
dicates that the training data contains some biases
(in the form of some unigrams associated with
a particular gender or race tending to appear in
tweets labeled with certain emotions). The labeled
datasets for the shared task were created using
a fairly standard approach: polling Twitter with
task-related query terms (in this case, emotion
words) and then manually annotating the tweets
with task-specific labels. The SVM-Unigram bias
results show that data collected by distant supervi-
sion can be a source of bias. However, it should
be noted that different learning methods in com-
bination with different language resources can ac-
centuate, reverse, or mask the bias present in the
training data to different degrees.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We created the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC),
which consists of 8,640 sentences specifically cho-
sen to tease out gender and race biases in natural
language processing systems. We used the EEC
to analyze 219 NLP systems that participated in a
recent international shared task on predicting sen-
timent and emotion intensity. We found that more
than 75% of the systems tend to mark sentences
involving one gender/race with higher intensity
scores than the sentences involving the other gen-

der/race. We found such biases to be more widely
prevalent for race than for gender. We also found
that the bias can be different depending on the par-
ticular affect dimension involved.

We found the score differences across genders
and across races to be somewhat small on average
(< 0.03, which is 3% of the 0 to 1 score range).
However, for some systems the score differences
reached as high as 0.34 (34%). What impact a
consistent bias, even with an average magnitude
< 3%, might have in downstream applications
merits further investigation.

We plan to extend the EEC with sentences asso-
ciated with country names, professions (e.g., doc-
tors, police officers, janitors, teachers, etc.), fields
of study (e.g., arts vs. sciences), as well as races
(e.g., Asian, mixed, etc.) and genders (e.g., agen-
der, androgyne, trans, queer, etc.) not included in
the current study. We can then use the corpus to
examine biases across each of those variables as
well. We are also interested in exploring which
systems (or what techniques) accentuate inappro-
priate biases in the data and which systems miti-
gate such biases. Finally, we are interested in ex-
ploring how the quality of sentiment analysis pre-
dictions varies when applied to text produced by
different demographic groups, such as people of
different races, genders, and ethnicities.

The Equity Evaluation Corpus and the proposed
methodology to examine bias are not meant to
be comprehensive. However, using several ap-
proaches and datasets such as the one proposed
here can bring about a more thorough examination
of inappropriate biases in modern machine learn-
ing systems.
