Abstract 

We report on the first, still on-going effort to 

integrate verb MWEs in an LFG grammar of 

Modern Greek (MG). Text is lemmatized and 

tagged with the ILSP FBT Tagger and is fed 

to a MWE filter that marks 

Words_With_Spaces in MWEs. The output is 

then formatted to feed an LFG/XLE grammar 

that has been developed independently. So far 

we have identified and classified about 2500 

MWEs, and have processed 40% of them by 

manipulating only the lexicon and not the 

rules of the grammar.  

Research on MG MWEs (indicatively, 

Anastasiadi-Simeonidi, 1986; Fotopoulou, 1993; 

Mini et al., 2011) has developed collections of 

MWEs and discussed classification, syntax and 

semantics issues. To the best of our knowledge, 

this is the first attempt to obtain deep parses of a 

wide range of types of MG verb MWEs with rich 

syntactic structure. 

1 The parsing system  

We take advantage of the mature ILSP FBT 

Tagger (Papageorgiou et al., 2000) that is an 

adaptation of the Brill tagger trained on MG text. 

It uses a PAROLE compatible tagset of 584 tags. 

The tagger works on the output of a sentence 

detection and tokenisation tool and assigns a 

lemma and a set of tags corresponding to an 

exhaustive morphological analysis of tokens   

(Fig. 1). The tagger is a black box for our system 

and allows for no preprocessing of MWEs, as it 

would be possible if the XFST/XLE component 

was used (Attia, 2006). We have been working 

on a system that aims to move as much as 

possible of the parsing burden from the 

LFG/XLE component to a MWE recognizer (the 

‘filter’) at the same time allowing for ‘natural’ 

LFG analyses.  Oflazer et al. (2004) discuss a 

similar preprocessing step but they focus on the 

retrieval and not on the deep parsing of verb 

MWEs. Our filter, implemented in Perl, scans the 

output of the tagger for strings containing verb 

MWEs and feeds a script (‘formatter’) that yields 

a format readable by an LFG/XLE grammar. 

1.1 The filter lexicon 

The filter consults the ‘filter lexicon’ where each 

verb MWE entry is specified for the following:  

1. Compositionality. Certain verb MWEs can 

take a compositional interpretation. For instance, 

the free subject, flexible (Sag et al, 2001) verbal 

33



MWE κάνω μαύρα μάτια να σε δω (9) has no 

compositional interpretation while the semi-fixed 

MWE τις_αρπάζω (2) “to be beaten up”, can take 

the compositional interpretation “grab/steal 

them-FEM”. The filter lexicon specifies which 

MWEs will be eventually assigned both MWE 

and compositional XLE parses.  

2. The lemmatized form of Words_With_Spaces 

(WWS) whether they are independent fixed 

MWEs or substrings of a MWE. For instance, the 

lemmatised WWS μαύρος_μάτι would be stored 

for WWS μαύρα μάτια  of the MWE (9).  

3. PoS of the WWS. For instance, we have 

classified the WWS ταπί-και-ψύχραιμος 

‘penniless and calm’(6) as adjective; however, 

only the second conjunct (ψύχραιμος ‘calm’) is 

an adjective while the first conjunct ταπί is an 

indeclinable non-Greek word that occurs with 

this type of MWE only. Regarding distribution, 

the conjunction behaves as an adjective. In 

general, we have relied on distribution criteria in 

order to assign PoS to WWSs.  

4. Morphological constraints on the lemmatized 

constituents of a WWS that uniquely identify 

fixed or semi-fixed MWE substrings. For 

instance, for the adjective μαύρα in the WWS 

μαύρα μάτια (9) the lemma of the adjective 

μαύρος is stored together with the tags adjective-

plural-accusative-neutral-basic. 

5. Multiple WWSs if different word orders of the 

same WWS occur, for instance πίνει [το αίμα του 

κοσμάκη]WWS [gloss: drink the blood of people] 

and πίνει [του κοσμάκη το αίμα]WWS ‘takes a lot 

of money from people by applying force’. 

1.2 The filter 

The filter, implemented in Perl, reads the tagged 

sentence from an xml file (the output of the 

tagger), checks it for MWEs and feeds it to the 

formatter if no MWE or a MWE that can take a 

compositional interpretation is found. Strings 

containing MWEs are preprocessed by the filter: 

their fixed parts are replaced with the 

corresponding WWS and morphological 

constraints and the resulting new string is sent to 

the formatter. The filter can identify all word 

permutations available to a listed MWE. 

2 An outline of the LFG analysis  

The output of the formatter is parsed with an 

LFG grammar of MG. The grammar includes 

sublexical rules that parse the output of the 

tagger and ensure information flow from the 

tagger to XLE. The sub-lexical trees can be seen 

in the c-structure of Fig. 1. MG MWEs are rich 

in syntactic structure despite any simplifications 

that might result from the usage of WWSs. In 

agreement with Gross (1998a; 1998b) and Mini 

et al. (2011) who argue that MWEs and 

compositional structures can be treated with 

more or less the same grammar, we have so far 

manipulated only the lexicon  but not the 

grammar rules. Identification of phrasal 

constituents within the MWEs relies on possible 

permutations and the ability of XPs to intervene 

between two words, thus indicating the border 

between two constituents. Grammatical functions 

are identified with diagnostics that apply to 

compositional expressions such as morphological 

marking and WH questions. The types of 

syntactic structure we have treated thus far are: 

1. Fixed verb WWS (Table 1:1): no inflection or 

word permutation. 

(1)  πάρε         πέντε 

      take-2-sg-IMP    five-numeral 

      ‘You are silly.’ 

2. Free subject-verb (Table 1:2): inflecting,  

SV/VS word order.  

(2) O     Πέτρος    τις                   άρπαξε 

      the Peter-nom CL-pl-fem-acc grab-3-sg-past 

      ‘Petros was beaten up.’ 

3&4. Impersonal verb-complement: inflecting, 

fixed object (Table 1:3) or saturated sentential 

subject (Table 1:4), intervening XPs between the 

verb and its object or subject, VO/OV word 

order (but not VS/SV).  

(3) Έριξε               καρεκλοπόδαρα χθες.  

      pour-3-sg-past chair-legs          yesterday 

      ‘It rained cats and dogs yesterday.’ 

(4) Έχει                  γούστο       να βρέξει. 

       have-3-sg-pres gusto-noun to rain 

      ‘Don’t tell me that it might rain.’

C: compositional. Only lemmatised forms are given. 

5&6. Free subject-copula-complement: 

inflecting copula, complement fixed (Table 1:5), 

intervening XPs between the subject and the 

verb or between the copula and the complement, 

constituent permutations.  

(5) Μένει                  η    Ρέα        στήλη άλατος 

      be-left-3-sg-pres the Rea-nom stele-of-salt 

     ‘Rea was left speechless.’ 

Alternatively, the complement may inflect 

(Table 1:6) and agree with the free subject.  

(6) Και  μένει                  η   Ρέα  

     and   be-left3-sg-pres the Rea-sg-fem-nom   

     ταπί          και  ψύχραιμη 

     penniless and  calm-sg-fem-nom 

    ‘Rea lost all her money.’ 

7. Free subject-verb-fixed object with subject 

bound possessive (Table 1:7): inflecting verb, 

object modified with a subject bound possessive 

weak pronoun, intervening XPs between the 

object and the verb, constituent permutations.  

(7) έφαγε/άρπαξε      η Ρέαj              το  

     eat/grab-3-sg-past the Rea-nom  the 

ξύλο της χρονιάς      της j 

 beating the year-gen    weak-pron-fem-gen 

     ‘Rea was beaten up.’ 

8&9. Free subject (controller)-verb-object- 

subordinated clause with controlled subject: 

inflecting verb, object possibly fixed (Table 1: 

9), the subordinated clause possibly semi-fixed 

(Table 1:8), intervening XPs, VSO/OVS word 

orders.  

(8) Έριξαν               άδεια να πιάσουν    γεμάτα 

      throw-3-pl-past empty to catch-3-pl full 

      ‘Τhey tried to obtain information.’ 

(9) έκανε                  η      μάνα                     του    

      make-3-sg-past  the    mother-sg-nom    hisj      

μαύρα  μάτια  να τον   δει 

      black    eyes    to  himj see-3-sg 

    ‘It took his mother a long time to meet him.’ 

The transitive verb ρίχνω “throw” (8) is used as 

a control verb only in (8). An alternative analysis 

that would insure identity of subjects could treat 

the exemplified MWE as a coordination 

structure. We opted for the control approach and 

defined a special entry of the verb ρίχνω “throw” 

because the particle να typically introduces 

35



(probably controlled) subordinated clauses and 

the constraints on verbal forms are those of να-

subordination and not of coordination.   

10. Free subject-verb-object (Table 1:10): 

inflecting verb, fixed or non-fixed object, 

intervening XPs and OVS/VOS word order. 

(10) Οι  άνθρωποι             τράβηξαν             τότε   

        the people-pl-nom      pull-3-pl-past      then  

του λιναριού τα   πάθη 

        the  linen       the  sufferings 

       ‘People suffered a lot then.’ 

3 Conclusions and future research 

This is ongoing work but up to this point, natural 

analyses of the verb MWEs are possible with the 

standing rule component of our LFG grammar of 

MG. On the other hand, the entries of the two 

lexica we have developed, namely the filter and 

the XLE lexicon, provide a rich resource for 

studying the features of the idiomaticity that 

verb MWEs bring into ‘normal’ MG 

(indicatively, see discussion of (8)).   In the 

immediate future, we will use the same 

methodology to parse the remaining types of 

MWE in our collection and will draw on the 

accumulated evidence to study the linguistic 

phenomena observed in verb MWEs against 

more general semasio-syntactic properties of 

MG, for instance the role of control 

constructions and of animacy in this language. 

We will consider a more sophisticated design of 

the filter. Last, we plan to investigate the issue of 

semantic representation of MWEs.
