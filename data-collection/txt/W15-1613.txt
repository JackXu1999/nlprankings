Abstract

This paper presents a resource and the associated
annotation process used in a project of interlink-
ing Czech and English verbal translational equiv-
alents based on a parallel, richly annotated depen-
dency treebank containing also valency and seman-
tic roles, namely the Prague Czech-English Depen-
dency Treebank. One of the main aims of this project
is to create a high-quality and relatively large em-
pirical base which could be used both for linguistic
comparative research as well as for natural language
processing applications, such as machine translation
or cross-language sense disambiguation. This paper
describes the resulting lexicon, CzEngVallex, and
the process of building it, as well some interesting
observations and statistics already obtained.

1 Introduction
The present paper describes a cross-language verbal va-
lency mapping between Czech and English and the pro-
cess of capturing it in an annotated language resource.
The result thereof is our Czech-English verbal valency
lexicon called CzEngVallex, which explicitly links cor-
responding verbal senses and their valency arguments.
As this mapping is based on the parallel Prague Czech-
English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT), which also
contains monolingual valency annotation on each side,
we are getting a powerful, real-text-based complex of
interlinked resources for a comparative description of
verb senses and their argument structure in the context
of translation equivalents.

While having the aforementioned relations captured in
an explicit way will help cross-language linguistic com-
parison studies, it will also serve as training and testing
material for multilingual natural language processing ap-
plications, most notably machine translation in systems
using deep analysis with semantic elements (such as ar-
gument and semantic role labeling).

We are not aware of similar work which links aligned
valency lexicons to a parallel dependency treebank, even

though the resources as such do exist: a Japanese–English
lexicon is described in (Fujita and Bond, 2004b). Simi-
lar lexicons have been suggested by Dorr (1997), Uszko-
reit (2002) or Baldwin et al. (1999). Fujita and Bond
(2004a) suggest an automatic extraction of valency from
plain bilingual lexicons, but no subjective evaluation of
the valency entries themselves is given.

The overview of the aim of the project described
here is given in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we introduce
the basis for building CzEngVallex—the underlying par-
allel Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank and
the corresponding monolingual valency lexicons. The
CzEngVallex lexicon itself and the process of annotating
it is described in Sect. 4, and we conclude with Sect. 5.

2 Comparing Czech and English Valency
This idea of a bilingual valency lexicon linked to a
treebank comes from an exploratory and theoretically-
oriented project for comparison of valency behavior of
Czech and English verbs, which, of course, needs an an-
notated corpus material. Generalizing over the collected
data—several thousand aligned verbs, linked to tens of
thousand corpus occurrences—should give us more in-
sight into the basic patterns of cross-language relations.

2.1 Valency in the FGD
This project is based on the valency theory of the Func-
tional Generative Description (FGD) (Sgall et al., 1986)
and on its application to the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) annotation style (Hajič et al., 2006). In this
dependency approach, valency is seen as the ability of
some lexical items (in general, not only verbs) to select
for certain complementations in order to form larger units
of meaning (Panevová, 1974). The governing lexical
unit then governs both the morphosyntactic properties1 of
the dependent elements and their semantic interpretation
(roles). The number and form of the dependent elements

1Morphological properties of verb arguments, or rather constraints
on their use specific to every verb/argument combination, are very
prominently present in inflectional languages such as Czech.

constituting the valency structure of a given verb sense is
represented by a valency frame, which is listed in a va-
lency lexicon.

According to FGD, the valency relation is a part of
deep syntax (tectogrammatic layer of linguistic descrip-
tion). Every head-dependent relation is labeled by a
functor denoting the role of the dependent relative to its
head. While the FGD describes two dimensions of va-
lency complementation, we can simplify to say that each
verb frame (for a given verb sense) contains both verb ar-
guments as well as adjuncts. The main functors used for
verb arguments are Actor/Bearer (ACT), Patient (PAT),
Addressee (ADDR), Origin (ORIG) and Effect (EFF).2

The set of adjuncts (free modifications) is about 50 large
(Mikulová et al., 2006; Urešová, 2011a).

3 CzEngVallex Source Data
3.1 The Czech-English Parallel Corpus
The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
(PCEDT) (Hajič et al., 2011; Hajič et al., 2012)3 is a
sentence-aligned parallel treebank with automatic word
alignments based on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
section of Penn treebank4 and its manual translation to
Czech. It contains manual annotation of morphology
and syntax for Czech and for English on approx. 50,000
sentences (about a million words), i.e., all the usual
“merged” 2,312 files of the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus.

It is annotated on several layers, of which the tec-
togrammatical layer (cf. Sect. 2.1) includes also the an-
notation of verbal valency relations by referring, for each
verb occurrence in the corpus, to the PDT-Vallex and
EngVallex valency lexicons (see Sect. 3.2 and 3.3).5

3.2 PDT-Vallex – The Czech Valency Lexicon
The Czech valency lexicon PDT-Vallex (Hajič et al.,
2003; Urešová, 2011b) has been developed as part of the
PDT annotation effort. Valency frames representing verb
senses in this lexicon are grouped by headwords (lem-
mas). Each frame contains the following fields: a unique
ID, labeled valency frame members (“slots”), their obli-
gatoriness and required surface forms. The frames are
accompanied by example fragments of Czech sentences,
taken almost exclusively from the PDT. Additional notes
help to distinguish the meaning of the individual valency
frames for the same headword.

The version of PDT-Vallex used to build CzEngVallex
contains 11,933 valency frames for 7,121 verbs. The

2These would roughly correspond to Arg0, Arg1, etc. in the Prop-
Bank style of argument labeling.

verbs and frames come mostly from the data appearing
in the latest versions of the PDT and PCEDT.

3.3 EngVallex – The English Valency Lexicon
EngVallex has been created by a (largely manual) adap-
tation of an already existing similar resource for English,
the PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002), to the FGD
valency format and to PDT labeling standards (Cinková,
2006). During the adaptation process, arguments were
re-labeled, obligatoriness was marked for each valency
slot and frames with identical meaning were merged (and
some split as well). Links to the original PropBank frame
file and roleset have been kept wherever possible.

EngVallex was used for the annotation of the English
part of the PCEDT. It contains 7,148 valency frames for
4,337 verbs.

4 Building CzEngVallex
4.1 Structure of CzEngVallex
CzEngVallex builds on all the resources mentioned in
Sect. 3. It connects pairs of valency frames in the PCEDT
(verb senses) which are translations of each other, align-
ing their arguments as well. This resource cannot be used
independently, since it refers to the valency frame de-
scriptions contained in both PDT-Vallex and EngVallex,
and it also relies on the PCEDT.

The structure of this new resource, which is techni-
cally a single XML file, is shown in Fig. 1.6 Aligned
pairs of verb frames are grouped by the English verb
frame (<en_frame>), and for each English verb sense,

6Similar scheme is used in (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006).

125



their Czech counterparts are listed (<frame_pair>). For
each of such pairs, all the aligned valency slots are listed
and referred to by the functor assigned to the slot in the
respective valency lexicon. In this example, for the pair
abandon7 – opustit (lit. leave [alone]) the first two ar-
guments match perfectly (ACT:ACT, PAT:PAT) and the
third argument in English (EFF) does not match any ar-
gument for this particular Czech counterpart, while for
the pair abandon – zříci se (lit. get rid of [for sth]), the
third English argument maps to a Czech adjunct (SUBS,
substitution).

It must be noted here that while all verb–verb pairs
have been aligned, annotated, and included in this pair-
ing, there are also many verb–non-verb or non-verb–verb
pairs, which have been left aside for this first version of
CzEngVallex as none of the underlying lexicons include
a complete description of other parts-of-speech.

4.2 The Annotation Process
During the actual annotation process, we have manu-
ally aligned English and Czech verbs and their argu-
ments (and in some clear cases also adjuncts). After care-
fully checking all occurrences of any given valency frame
pair in the PCEDT, we included it in CzEngVallex us-
ing the structure described in Sect. 4.1, which is based
on (Šindlerová and Bojar, 2009; Bojar and Šindlerová,
2010).8 The process is helped by automatic preprocess-
ing steps.

4.2.1 Preprocessing and Data Preparation
The following steps had been taken before the manual

annotation proper started:

• automatic pre-alignment using GIZA++ word align-
ment (Och and Ney, 2003) and a projection to deep
dependency trees (taken from the original PCEDT);

• grouping the occurrences of the same verb sense
pairs together to simplify annotation.

4.2.2 Annotation Environment
The annotation interface for manual valency frame

alignment9 has been built as an extension of the TrEd
annotation environment (Pajas and Fabian, 2011). TrEd
is a fully customizable and programmable graphical ed-
itor and viewer for any tree-like structures. It allows
displaying and editing sentential tree structures anno-
tated on multiple linguistic layers. The new CzEngVallex
TrEd extension uses the data format of the Treex NLP

7Frame ID ev-w1f2, which has been created from abandon.02 in
the PropBank, as in Noriega abandoned command ... for an exile.

8These papers describe only a pilot experiment; the current process
differs from their suggestions in several substantial respects.

9There are other environments for manual alignment, such as
(Melamed, 1998; Samuelsson and Volk, 2007; Ahrenberg et al., 2002),
but they work on plain text or phrases, not dependency trees.

Figure 2: Highlighted alignment in the annotation tool TrEd;
color-coding: green for verbs, blue for arguments/adjuncts

framework (Žabokrtský, 2011; Popel and Žabokrtský,
2010) and pre-existing TrEd extensions for PCEDT, PDT-
Vallex, and EngVallex.

The annotation interface includes keyboard macros to
change values of individual attributes or to add or delete
whole nodes from the structure. Links between English
and Czech nodes are added or changed in a drag-and-drop
fashion.

4.2.3 Manual Annotation Workflow
The environment described in Sect. 4.2.2 is used to

display, edit, collect, and store the alignments between
Czech and English valency frames.

Each annotator has their own copy of the treebank, the
lexicons, and the valency frame pairing to work on. The
changes done by the annotators are merged in the last
stage of the process. Any problems encountered, such as
wrong annotation in the treebank, or wrong translation,
are reported by the annotators through a note system for
later corrections.

During the annotation process, the annotator is handed
a set of all available sentences for a given verb sense
pair. Since verb nodes and their complementations in the
PCEDT are automatically pre-aligned (see Sect. 4.2.1), a
verb sense pairing suggestion is displayed for each sen-
tence by visually highlighting the pre-alignments (Fig. 2).

The annotator then manually corrects the automatic
pre-alignments in the sentence. Then, if the pair is seen
for the first time, it is inserted into CzEngVallex by the

126



annotator (a new CzEngVallex entry is created). For sub-
sequent occurrences, the annotation environment is used
to check the pair against the already existing CzEng-
Vallex entry. If any conflict arises, annotators can mark
material for further analysis. Typically, errors in either
the PCEDT annotation or in the valency lexicons are im-
plied in such cases.

4.3 Lexicon and Corpus: Statistics

Verb Frame PCEDT Tokens
Language types types verbs aligned
English 3,288 4,967 130,514 86,573
Czech 4,192 6,776 118,189 85,606

Table 1: Alignment coverage statistics - CzEngVallex/PCEDT

Table 1 contains some statistics about the new re-
source. It shows that the financial domain of the WSJ
(866,246 English tokens/953,187 Czech tokens) is not
very rich in terms of different verbs used: only 4,967
different verb frames (which correspond to a medium-
grained sense inventory) on the English side and 6,776
different verb frames on the Czech side have been
aligned. However, 19,916 different alignment pairs have
been collected: this shows that in translation, even if in a
restricted domain, translators use a very rich set of syn-
onyms. The verbs with the highest number of different
alignments are be (353 different verbs aligned to it in
Czech), make (203) and take (171); conversely, it is být
(184), mít (104) and získat (70) (lit. be, have and gain,
respectively).

Comparing the aligned pairs with the complete mono-
lingual valency lexicons (see Sect. 3), about 57% of PDT-
Vallex (Czech) verb frames are covered, compared to
about 69% of covered EngVallex frames. Token-wise,
over 66% of English verb nodes (over 72% Czech ones)
have been successfully aligned and match CzEngVallex
pairings; the rest are aligned to nouns or other parts-
of-speech, or impossible to align at all. These numbers
jump to 75/86% (English/Czech) if we discount verbs not
aligned to any node.

Statistics for the number of differing members are
shown in Table 2. We can see that only about 45% frames
match fully, i.e., have the same number of arguments and
the same labels. Many frames differ in one or two mem-
bers (47%) while more divergent pairings are a relatively
rare occurrence. The differences can be in part explained
by the different behavior of the verbs (i.e., not a full se-
mantic match), but a large number of them can be at-
tributed to a certain degree of ambiguity in label assign-
ments, which could be harmonized in future versions of
the valency dictionaries (Šindlerová et al., 2014).

5 Conclusions
While the statistics themselves provoke an inquiry into
translation practice, the goal is to investigate primarily
the cases where the straightforward alignment did not
happen, i.e., those 25/14% verbs not aligned to a verb,
or not matching CzEngVallex pairings. Some of these
cases can be extracted by inspecting the data where com-
ments have been added by the annotators, and others by
simple technical means (finding verbs with no matching
alignment, finding verbs aligned to nouns, adjectives, or
other structurally divergent structures).

In addition, we plan to use the newly created re-
source for NLP tasks, such as MT, or to provide features
for cross-language machine learning tasks, such as verb
sense disambiguation.

The new resource itself, as described here, after neces-
sary quality check and corrections of the underlying data
for consistency reasons, will be published under a Cre-
ative Commons license and included with the next edition
of the PCEDT.
