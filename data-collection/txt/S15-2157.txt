Abstract

This paper describes our contribution to the
SemEval-2015 task 17 on “Taxonomy Extrac-
tion Evaluation”. We propose a hypernym de-
tection system combining three modules: a
lexico-syntactic pattern matcher, a morpho-
syntactic analyzer and a module retrieving hy-
pernym relations from structured lexical re-
sources. Our system ranked first in the compe-
tition when considering the gold standard and
manual evaluation, and second in the overall
ranking. In addition, the experimental results
show that all modules contribute to finding hy-
pernym relations between terms.

1 Introduction

Because of globalization and rapid technological
evolution, it is no longer feasible to manually cre-
ate and manage taxonomies for the large variety of
scientific and technological (sub)domains. In ad-
dition to domain-specific terminology, also com-
panies desire to build their own mono- or bilin-
gual taxonomies containing the relevant sector- and
company-specific terminology. This clear need for
automatisation has encouraged researchers to inves-
tigate how terminological and semantically struc-
tured resources such as taxonomies or ontologies
can be automatically constructed from text (Bie-
mann, 2005).

Different approaches have been proposed to au-
tomatically detect hierarchical relations between
terms: pattern-based approaches (Hearst, 1992; Pan-
tel and Ravichandran, 2004), statistical and machine

learning techniques (Ritter et al., 2009), distribu-
tional approaches (Caraballo, 1999; van der Plas and
Bouma, 2005; Lenci and Benotto, 2012), morpho-
syntactic approaches (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2011)
and word class latices (Navigli and Velardi, 2010).

The SemEval-2015 “Taxonomy Extraction Eval-
uation” Task (Bordea et al., 2015) is concerned
with automatically finding relations between pairs
of terms and organizing them in a hierarchical struc-
ture. In this way, the task assumes that a list of do-
main specific terms is already available in order to
focus on the relation detection between these terms.

To tackle this SemEval taxonomy learning task,
we propose a multi-modular approach that combines
lexico-syntactic, morphological and external struc-
tured lexical information. We will describe our hy-
pernym detection system in Section 2. The results
of the evaluation are presented in Section 3, while
Section 4 concludes this paper.

2 System Description

Our hypernym detection system contains three main
components: a lexico-syntactic pattern-based ap-
proach, a morpho-syntactic analyzer and a module
retrieving hypernym relations from a structured lex-
ical resource. Each module takes as input a domain
specific term list.

2.1 Pattern-based Approach

The first module that automatically detects hyper-
nym relations is a lexico-syntactic pattern-based ap-
proach, based on Hearst (1992). These patterns are
implemented as a list of regular expressions contain-
ing lexicalized expressions (e.g. like), as well as iso-

944



lated Part-of-Speech tags (e.g. noun) and chunk tags,
which represent different Part-of-Speech sequences
(e.g. noun phrase (NP) = determiner + adjective +
noun, adjective + noun, etc.). An example of these
manually defined patterns is “NP {, NP}* {,} or/and
other NP”,1 as in “green beans, carrots, peas and
other vegetables”, which results in four hypernym
pairs, being (vegetables, green beans), (vegetables,
carrots), (vegetables, peas) and (vegetables, onions).

Domain specific corpus. As this module aims to
find hypernym relations by detecting terms occur-
ring in specific lexico-syntactic constructions, we
first needed to compile a domain specific corpus
containing these terms. To compile the corpus, we
used the the BootCaT toolkit (Baroni and Bernar-
dini, 2004), which can be used to build a specialized
web-based corpus starting from a list of seed terms.
We considered the different term lists for task 17 as
the “seed terms” to build the domain specific cor-
pora, by allowing 10 queries per seed term. Due
to technical reasons (the Bing search engine that is
used by BootCat only allows 5000 queries per user
account), we only compiled corpora for three do-
mains, being equipment, food and science. As a
post-processing step, we removed all sentences con-
taining (1) only URL links or (2) no domain specific
term, resulting in three corpora containing about 12
million tokens for the food domain, 6 million tokens
for the equipment domain and 27 million tokens for
the science domain.

Linguistic preprocessing. We performed a num-
ber of linguistic preprocessing steps in order to en-
rich the original web-based corpus: (1) tokenisa-
tion, (2) Part-of-Speech Tagging, (3) Lemmatisa-
tion and (4) Chunking. All linguistic preprocessing
was per performed by means of the LeTs Preprocess
toolkit (Van de Kauter et al., 2013).

Lexico-syntactic pattern matching. The result-
ing linguistically preprocessed corpus is the input
for the pattern-based module. Example 1 shows a
sentence matching the pattern:

{other}* NP such as NP {, NP}* {(and-or) NP}*

1Curly brackets indicate optional parts of the pattern.

resulting in the two hypernym pairs (cranberry
products, tablets) and (cranberry products, cap-
sules). As can be seen in example 1, the lexi-
calised parts of the patterns (other and such as in
this case) are not considered for the generation of
the hyponym–hypernym tuples.

(1) other other JJ B-NP
cranberry cranberry NN I-NP
products product NNS I-NP
such such JJ B-AP
as as IN I-AP
tablets tablet NNS B-NP
and and CC O
capsules capsule NNS B-NP

We optimized the pattern-based model presented
by (Lefever et al., 2014) in different ways. The ef-
ficiency of the module was improved by only con-
sidering noun phrases containing a maximum of 6
consecutive nouns and by ignoring named entities.
This appeared to be necessary as the web-based cor-
pus contains a lot of lists and enumerations, causing
problems for the recursive way the regular expres-
sions are built. Precision, on the other hand, was im-
proved by ignoring tuples containing both terms as
hypernym and hyponym (e.g. hand truck – truck and
truck – hand truck) and by only considering patterns
that revealed to obtain high precision in previous re-
search (Lefever et al., 2014).

Finally, the output of the pattern-based module is
filtered by only considering tuples where both terms
(either lemma or full form) occur in the term list of
the considered domain.

2.2 Morpho-syntactic Analyzer
Our second hypernym detection module applies a
morpho-syntactic approach where the morphologi-
cal structure of compound terms is used to extract a
hypernym-hyponym relation from this term. This
approach is inspired by the head-modifier princi-
ple (Sparck Jones, 1979) stating that in a compound
noun, the linear arrangement of the compound parts
expresses the kind of information being conveyed,
the head referring to the more general semantic cat-
egory, whereas the modifiers restrict the sense of the
compound term. This way, the complete compound
term can be considered as a hyponym of the head
term. We implemented rules for three different syn-
tactic hypernym-hyponym relations in compounds:

945



1. Single-word terms: If term T0 is a suffix string
of term T1, T0 is considered to be a hyper-
nym of T1. Examples of hypernym pairs de-
tected within single-word terms are (sacher-
torte, torte), (candlepin, pin) and (psycholin-
guistics, linguistics).

2. Multiword terms: If term T0 is the head term
of term T1, T0 is considered to be a hypernym
of T1. It is important to mention that we also
allow multiple possible hypernyms in case dif-
ferent terms occur as suffixes of the compound
term, e.g. phu quoc fish sauce is the hyponym
of both sauce and fish sauce. As the head of
a nominal phrase appears at the right edge of
a multiword NP in English, the last constituent
of the NP is regarded as the head of the com-
pound, and thus as the hypernym of the com-
plete term, as is the case in the generated hy-
pernym pair (béarnaise sauce, sauce).

3. Complex prepositional phrases: If term T0 is
the first part of a term T1 containing a noun
phrase + preposition + noun phrase, T0 is
considered to be a hypernym of T1. In the
case of a prepositional compound phrase, the
head is situated at the left edge of the com-
pound term. Examples of such hypernym pairs
are (sociology of culture, sociology) and (soup
all’imperatrice, soup)

In addition, we added some restrictions to these
general rules in order to improve the precision of the
module. First, we set a threshold of minimum three
characters for the detection of valid hypernyms. An
example of invalid hypernyms filtered out this way
is tu that could be detected as a hypernym of pe-
sarattu, both terms occurring in the food term list.
Second, we noticed that food terms (etc. dishes) are
often loan words from other languages. Therefor we
added a list of foreign adjectival affixes (e.g. french
affix al/ale) that should not be considered as a hy-
pernym of the compound term. This way we pre-
vent for instance ale to be detected as the hypernym
of chicken provencale or café royale.

2.3 Structured Lexical Resources: WordNet
The third hypernym detection module retrieves in-
formation from an external lexical resource, being

WordNet in this case. This module looks up the
synsets in WordNet for all domain-specific terms
and retrieves all hypernyms appearing in the full hi-
erarchical path of these synsets. Hypernym tuples
containing identical terms were removed. Examples
of hyponym-hypernym pairs retrieved from Word-
Net are (semantics, science) and (semantics, linguis-
tics).

2.4 Combined System
To generate the final list of hypernym relations, we
combined the output of all three modules and re-
moved all doubles from the hyponym–hypernym
pair list.

3 Results

The resulting taxonomies are evaluated through
comparison with gold standard relations collected
from existing domain specific ontologies and Word-
Net. In addition, expert evaluation has been per-
formed on the hypernym relations submitted by the
participants. The system organizers calculated pre-
cision, recall and F-score as well as a cumulative
Fowlkes & Mallows measure, which is inspired by
clustering evaluation and takes into account the hi-
erarchical structure of the gold standard taxonomy
and the taxonomy that is produced by the system.

In addition, a number of structural measures were
calculated such as the number of distinct vertices
and edges, the number of connected components and
intermediate nodes to evaluate whether the taxon-
omy connects all nodes with the root. From this
evaluation it was clear that our taxonomy contains
cycles, which is conflicting with correct hierarchical
relations. For more detailed information about the
gold standards and evaluation metrics, we refer to
(Bordea et al., 2015). Table 1 lists the averaged Pre-
cision, Recall, F-measure and Fowlkes & Mallows
scores for all participating systems, while Table 2
lists the individual scores for the three domains in
which we participated. The very high recall scores
for the WN data sets can be explained by the fact
that our system also contains a module that retrieves
hypernym relations from WordNet.2

2We included a WordNet module, since originally only Ba-
belNet was specified as the gold standard for the task. At eval-
uation time, however, WordNet was also used to evaluate the
taxonomies.

As we wanted to gain more insights in the contri-
bution of the different modules, we also calculated
precision and recall per module for the different term
lists. The results per module and for the combined
system are shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Precision (P) and recall (R) from relation overlap
scores per hypernym detection module per domain.

We notice that the WordNet module indeed
achieves very high recall for the WN test sets, but
that the recall for the more technical term lists is
much lower (with only 0.021 for the Equipment data
set). The recall achieved by the pattern-based mod-
ule is also very modest, with scores ranging from
0.005 (Equipment) to 0.063 (WN Science). The
Morpho-syntactic Module, on the other hand, con-
tributes in a consistent way to the recall for all term
lists. Finally, table 3 also shows that the obtained re-
call by the system that combines all different mod-

ules consistently beats the recall of the individual
modules for all test sets. With regard to precision,
we observe that the morpho-syntactic approach ob-
tains very good results for all the different test do-
mains, resulting in system precision scores that out-
perform all participating systems.

A qualitative analysis of the output revealed short-
comings of the different hypernym detection mod-
ules. As discussed above, the morpho-syntactic
module achieves good recall. The downside is that
the module clearly over generates. Examples of
invalid hypernym pairs are for instance (pineapple
juice, apple juice), (hot and sour soup, sour soup)
and (ice cream, cream). Although WordNet is a
manually verified taxonomy, we also discovered in-
valid hypernym pairs in the output of the WordNet
module. For the food domain, for instance, we dis-
covered that all beverages have “food” as an inher-
ited hypernym, resulting in hypernym pairs such as
(pineapple juice, food) and (absinth, food).

4 Conclusion

To tackle the SemEval “Taxonomy Extraction Eval-
uation” task, we proposed a hypernym detection sys-
tem combining a lexico-syntactic pattern matcher,
a morpho-syntactic analyzer and a module retriev-
ing hypernym relations from WordNet and showed
promising results for the different test domains. An-
alyzing the recall per hypernym detection module
revealed that all modules contribute to the final
hyponym–hypernym list generated by the combined
system.
In future work, we would like to improve the recall
of the system by adding additional hypernym detec-
tion modules (e.g. a distributional model built on the
basis of the domain corpora). We will also add a
dedicated module to construct the taxonomy based
on the hierarchical relations in order to remove the
cycles from the resulting taxonomy.
