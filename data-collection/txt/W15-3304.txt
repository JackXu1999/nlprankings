Abstract

Categorial grammars are attractive be-
cause they have a clear account of un-
bounded dependencies. This accounting
is especially important in Mandarin Chi-
nese which makes extensive usage of un-
bounded dependencies. However, parsers
trained on existing categorial grammar an-
notations (Tse and Curran, 2010) extracted
from the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et
al., 2005) are not as accurate as those
trained on the original treebank, possibly
because enforcing a small set of infer-
ence rules in these grammars leads to large
sets of categories, which cause sparse data
problems. This work reannotates the Penn
Chinese Treebank into a generalized cat-
egorial grammar which uses a larger rule
set and a substantially smaller category set
while retaining the capacity to model un-
bounded dependencies. Experimental re-
sults show a statistically significant im-
provement in parsing accuracy with this
categorial grammar.

1 Introduction

Categorial grammar annotations are attractive be-
cause they have a transparent syntactic-semantic
interface and provide a natural account of traces
(Rimell et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2012). This
is especially important in parsing Chinese, which
generates 1.5 times as many traces as English
and makes heavy use of unbounded dependen-
cies (Kummerfeld et al., 2013). Unfortunately,
the accuracy of parsers trained on existing cate-
gorial grammar reannotations (Chinese CCGbank;
Tse and Curran, 2010) of the Penn Chinese Tree-
bank (Xue et al., 2005) is much lower than that
of parsers trained on the original Treebank (Tse
and Curran, 2012). This may be because previous

attempts used Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG; Steedman, 2000; Steedman, 2012), which
is strongly lexicalized (Karttunen, 1989), using a
small set of language-independent rules and con-
sequently a large set of language-dependent cate-
gories. This strong lexicalization may contribute
to sparse data problems.

This work reannotates the Penn Chinese Tree-
bank into a ‘moderately lexicalized’ generalized
categorial grammar, similar to that defined for En-
glish by Nguyen et al (2012), which uses a larger
set of language-specific inference rules and a sub-
stantially smaller category set. Experimental re-
sults show a statistically significant gain in parsing
accuracy from this moderately lexicalized gram-
mar over parsing with a strongly lexicalized CCG.

2 Grammar Framework

A generalized categorial grammar (GCG; Bach,
1981; Nguyen et al., 2012)1 is a tuple
〈P,O,R,W,M〉 (Oehrle, 1994) consisting of a set
P of primitive category types, a set O of type-
constructing operators, a set R of inference rules, a
set W of vocabulary items, and a mapping M from
vocabulary items to complex category types. A set
of complex category types C may then be defined
as: P ⊂C; C×O×C ⊂C; nothing else is in C.

The mapping M in a GCG defines a category
type c and a constraint function g encoded by each
lexeme w ∈ W, using the notation w 7→ c : g. En-
coded constraints are expressed using dependency
functions,2 labeled with dependency types or argu-
ment position numbers: f0, f1, f2, etc. For exam-
ple, a constraint function g may consist of a sin-
gle ‘0’-labeled dependency to a constant ‘people’:

1Nguyen et al (2012) notate the ‘//’ and ‘\\’ operators of
Bach (1981) as -g and -h, mnemonic for ‘gap’ and ‘heavy
shift’.

2Dependencies shown here can be interpreted as a
shorthand for distributed representations of sentence mean-
ings compatible with cognitive computational neuroscientific
models of episodic memory (Schuler and Wheeler, 2014).

3 Chinese Syntax in GCG

Chinese is typically an SVO language, but it also
has several SOV constructions, such as the focus
constructions triggered by lian ‘even,’ or the ba
construction, where the affected patient is moved
to the preverbal position. Most adverbial modi-
fiers are pre-verbal and most nominal modifiers,
including relative clauses, are pre-nominal.

The set of primitive category types for Man-
darin Chinese, P, P ⊂ C, contains the following
primitive categories, generally labeled with the
part of speech of the head of the category:

V: verb-headed clause
N: noun-headed phrase or clause
D: de-clause
C: cardinal number
Q: quantificational phrase
A: adjectival phrase or nominal modifier
R: adverbial phrase or verbal modifier
B: verbal complement of ba
E: verbal complement of bei

The set of type-constructing operators O for
Mandarin Chinese includes -a and -b operators
for unsatisfied requirements of preceding or suc-
ceeding arguments, -c and -d operators for unsatis-
fied requirements of preceding or succeeding con-
juncts, and a -g operator for unsatisfied require-
ments of gap categories.3 A GCG category con-
sists of a primitive category followed by one or
more unsatisfied dependencies, each consisting of
an operator followed by another category.

The set of inference rules R is described below.

3.1 Argument composition

The basic operation of most categorial grammars
is argument composition. However, unlike most
categorial grammars, the GCG described in this
paper defines composition rules to explicitly en-
code dependencies between lexical items. Specif-
ically, inference rules for argument composition
are defined as follows, where c ∈C, p ∈ P and each
ϕ ∈ {-a, -b}×C:
c:g pϕ1..n-1-ac:h⇒ pϕ1..n-1:λx g (fn x)∧ (h x) (Aa)
pϕ1..n-1-bc:g c:h⇒ pϕ1..n-1:λx (g x)∧h (fn x) (Ab)

3Following (Nguyen et al., 2012), directional operators
such as forward and backward slashes (‘\’ and ‘/’) are not
used because some operators, such as gap operators in tough
constructions, are undirected.

The first composition rule Aa stipulates that
when a predicate h of category pϕ1..n-1-ac takes
a preceding argument g of category c as its n-th
argument, the syntactic dependency that g is h’s
n-th argument is added. The second composition
rule Ab is an argument composition rule taking a
succeeding argument.

3.2 Modifier composition

Inference rules for modifier composition apply
preceding or succeeding modifiers of category
p-bd to modificands of category c, where p ∈
{A,R}, d ∈ {N,V}:
p-bd:g c:h⇒ c:λx∃y (gy)∧ (h x)∧ (f1 y)=x (Ma)
c:g p-bd:h⇒ c:λx∃y (g x)∧ (hy)∧ (f1 y)=x (Mb)

The modifier composition rules Ma and Mb estab-
lish a ‘1’-labeled dependency from the modifier to
the modificand. With argument and modifier com-
position rules, we can derive the Chinese sentence
shown in (1).

(1) ‘Shanghai, in the aspect of finance, develops fast.’

上海

Ab
N

Aa
R-bV

发展

develop
V-aN

迅速

fast
R-bV

Mb
V-aN

Ma
V-aN

Aa
V

The separate modifier composition rules in
GCG make it possible to reuse modifier categories
across different contexts. For example, in (1), 在
金融方面 ‘in the aspect of finance’ is an adver-
bial modifier, having the category R-bV. It has
the same category when the phrase is a sentential
modifier as shown in (2). Consequently,在 ‘at’ in
both (1) and (2) has the same category R-bV-bN,
which means it takes a succeeding nominal argu-
ment to become an adverbial modifier.

(2) ‘In the aspect of finance, Shanghai develops fast.’

In contrast, since CCG enforces a restricted set
of inference rules, it needs to provide two differ-
ent categories, (S\NP)/(S\NP)/NP and S/S/NP
for 在 in (1) and (2). In total, Chinese CCGbank

26



has 91 different categories for在, since the prepo-
sitional phrase headed by 在 can modify con-
stituents of various syntactic categories. In con-
trast, Chinese GCG annotations only have 9 dif-
ferent categories for在.

Another example of differing lexicalization is
the category of the tense aspect 了 in Chinese,
which can either occur immediately after a verb or
after the whole verb phrase to indicate past tense.
Although generalized backward crossed composi-
tion (Steedman, 2000) helps aspect/tense particles
in Chinese usually retain their canonical category
(S\NP)\(S\NP), there are still 59 different cate-
gories for了 in Chinese CCGbank (Tse and Cur-
ran, 2010), and most of them are semantically in-
distinguishable.

3.3 Nominal and quantificational expressions
Mandarin Chinese does not have determiners such
as ‘the’ or ‘a’ in English, so there is no empiri-
cal motivation to distinguish NP and N categories.
However, classifiers or measure words, glossed as
‘M’ in (3), are obligatory when a noun is quanti-
fied by a number. This unit of measure is needed
for quantification of nouns because the lack of
number morphology in Chinese makes all nouns
behave as mass nouns (Allan, 1977; Borer, 2005).

(3) ‘three people’
三

three
C

个

M
Q-bN-aC

AaQ-bN

人

people
N

AbQ

We propose a separate category Q for quantifica-
tional expressions because they can be predicative,
as in (4), which makes them different from com-
mon nouns. A zero-head rule Z, where c,d,e ∈ C,
converts the Q category to V-aN to make the quan-
tificational expression predicative.

e:g⇒ c-ad:λx (f0 x)=pred∧g (f2 x) (Z)

(4) ‘He is three.’

他

he
N

三
three

C

岁

years old
Q-aC

AaQ
ZV-aN

了

ASP
R-bV MbV-aN AaV

Classifiers like年 ‘years,’岁 ‘years-old’ and天
‘day’ already contain the nominal information, so
they do not require nominal arguments like other

classifiers. Classifiers of this type have a differ-
ent category ‘Q-aC’ to reflect this combinational
difference. By doing so, the numbers receive the
same category C in both 三天 ‘three days,’ and
三个人 ‘three people.’ However, in both Chinese
Treebank and CCGbank, the category ‘M’ is used
for both types of classifiers, which results in num-
bers like 三 ‘three’ having the category QP/M in
‘three days’ and the category (NP/NP)/M in ‘three
people’ in Chinese CCGbank. This is not de-
sirable because it expends training examples on
an artificial distinction between the numbers 三
‘three’ in each of these expressions, which are se-
mantically the same.

3.4 Topicalization
Topicalization in Mandarin can involve either
movement of a topicalized constituent or not. The
topicalization which involves movement is similar
to that of English, in which the object is usually
moved to the sentence initial position and a gap is
left behind, as shown in (5).4

(5) ‘The rice, I ate.’

饭

rice
N

我

I
N

吃了
ate

V-aN-bN GaV-aN-gN
AcV-gN

FaV
The non-movement topicalization occurs much
more frequently in Mandarin, in which the subject
of the sentence usually has an ‘association’ rela-
tion to the topic, as shown in (6).

(6) ‘Of him, the appetite is good.’

他

he
N

胃口

appetite
N GcN-gN

很好

good
V-aN

AcV-gN
FaV

The referent of the subject in the non-movement
topicalization needs to be further specified by the
topic. Although topics are seen to be associated
with other constituents of the sentence, especially
in colloquial expressions, only associations with
subjects are observed in the Treebank data. There-
fore in our analysis of this type of topicaliza-
tion, the subject undergoes a unary type conver-
sion from N to N-gN to introduce a gap, which is

4The verb吃 and the tense particle了 are separate tokens,
shown together here to simplify the derivation. We apply the
same simplification to很好 in following examples.

27



later discharged by the topic to capture the ‘asso-
ciation’ relation between the subject and the topic.

Inference rules for gap composition are:

pϕ1..n-1oc⇒ pϕ1..n-1-gc:λvx (g x)∧ (fn x)=v (Ga)
c:g⇒ c-gd:λvx (g x)∧ (f1 v)=x (Gb)

N:g⇒ N-gN:λvx (g x)∧∃e (de-assoe xv) (Gc)
where p ∈ P, o ∈ {-a, -b}, c ∈ C, d ∈ {A-bN,R-bV}
and ϕ ∈ {-a, -b} ×C. Rule Ga hypothesizes a gap
as a preceding or succeeding argument, rule Gb
hypothesizes a nominal or adverbial modifier gap
and rule Gc hypothesizes a gap which is associated
with the subject in topicalization.

Non-local arguments, each consisting of a non-
local operator and argument category ψ ∈ {-g}×C,
are then propagated to consequents from all pos-
sible combinations of antecedents. For d:g e:h⇒
c:( f gh) ∈ {Aa–b, Ma–b}:
dψ1..m:g eψm+1..n:h⇒

cψ1..n:λv1..n f (gv1..m) (hvm+1..n) (Ac–d, Mc–d)

Rules Ac–d and Mc–d stipulate non-local prop-
agation through argument and modifier composi-
tion.

Inference rules for filler attachment apply
gapped clauses to topicalized phrases as fillers.
For c ∈C, and p ∈ P:

p:g c-gp:h⇒ c:λx∃y (gy)∧ (hy x) (Fa)
In contrast, Tse and Curran (2010) analyze the

topic in non-movement topicalization as a senten-
tial modifier, which gives 他 ‘he’ in (6) the cate-
gory S/S, serving as a sentential modifier for the
sentence 胃口很好 ‘appetite is good.’ This anal-
ysis conflates sentential adverbial modifiers such
as ‘today’ with topics such as ‘he’ in (6), yielding
incorrect dependencies and expending probability
mass on ungrammatical derivations (e.g.with top-
ics conjoined with adverbs).

3.5 Relative and appositive clauses
In Mandarin relative clauses, the particle 的 ‘de’
takes a preceding clause containing a gap to form a
relative clause modifying a succeeding noun. The
modified noun is the filler of the gap in the relative
clause. The inference rules for relative clauses ap-
ply the gapped de-clause to the modificand as a
filler. For c ∈C:

D-gc:g N:h⇒ N:λx (h x)∧∃y (g xy) (R)
A GCG analysis of a relative clause with an ob-

ject gap is shown in (7).

Our analysis of topicalization in (6) makes it easy
to account for a relative clause which relativizes
a topic. In (6) for example, relativizing the topic
他 ‘he’ yields a nominal phrase containing a non-
restrictive relative clause 胃口很好的他, ‘he
whose appetite is good.’ A GCG analysis of this
nominal phrase is shown in (8).

(8) ‘he whose appetite is very good’

appetite
N GcN-gN

很好

very-good

RN

Appositive clauses in Mandarin Chinese are
formed with the same的 ‘de’ particle used in rel-
ative clauses. However, unlike relative clauses,
appositive clauses do not involve any gap con-
stituent. In this GCG analysis of appositive
clauses, 的 ‘de’ receives the same category as it
does in relative clauses. But the noun which takes
an appositive clause as complement has the cate-
gory N-aD to take a preceeding de-clause to fur-
ther specify the content of the noun. An appositive
clause in this grammar is shown in (9).

(9) ‘the idea that high tech cannot be reached’
高科技

high tech
N

高不可攀

cannot-be-reached
V-aN AaV

的

de
D-aV AaD

想法

N-aD AaN

In the analyses described above, relative clauses
with different types of gaps are differentiated, and
relative clauses in general receive different analy-
ses than appositive clauses. In the analysis of Tse
and Curran (2010), a relative clause can only have
either a subject or object gap in Chinese. Rela-
tive clauses that relativize topics receive the same
categories as appositive clauses. This analysis
blurs the distributional difference between certain
types of relative clauses and appositive clauses,
decreasing PCFG estimates of both types of rel-
ative clauses given the same (conflated) category.

3.6 Ba and bei constructions

Ba constructions in Mandarin Chinese require the
affected patients of certain verbs to occur before
the verb, instead of after the verb. For example,
鱼 ‘fish’ in (10) is the object of 吃 ‘eat’ and it
occurs before the verb ‘eat.’ In the Penn Tree-
bank,把 ba takes a clause as argument. Therefore,
鱼吃了 ‘fish ate’ in (10) is analyzed as a clausal
complement of ba. This analysis makes ‘fish’ the
subject of the verb ‘eat,’ instead of the object.
Consequently, for example, Stanford dependen-
cies extracted from Treebank annotations of this
sentence have both ‘nsubj (吃‘eat,’ 猫‘cat’)’ and
‘nsubj (吃‘eat,’鱼‘fish’),’ which is not correct.

V-aN-bN TB-aN-aN AaB-aN
AbV-aN AaV

In our analysis, we propose that the particle ba
takes a ba-verb as its complement. Ba-verbs are
derived from transitive verbs with the type conver-
sion rule given below.5

5This rule is constrained by fact that the function g is pre-
served, and its usage is constrained by parsing probabilities
for particular categories. Following Featherston (2005) and
Crocker and Keller (2005), the model described in this pa-
per assumes that grammaticality judgements are gradient and
determined by probabilities of compositional inferences oc-
curring in the experience of a particular language user.

c:g⇒ d:g (T)
Using the type conversion rule T, we change a
transitive verb V-aN-bN to B-aN-aN to capture
the fact that the verb that occurs within a ba con-
struction takes a preceeding second argument.

The particle 把 ba is assigned the category V-
aN-b(B-aN), with coindexation between the ref-
erent of its subject (f1 x) and the referent of the
subject of its complement (f1 (f2 x)).

把 ‘ba’ 7→ V-aN-b(B-aN):λx (f0 x)=ba
∧ (f1 x)=(f1 (f2 x))

Usually, the affected patient is the direct object
of a transitive verb, as shown in (10), but there
are cases where some verbs can only occur in ba
constructions or bei constructions. These types of
verbs are ba-verbs to begin with and do not need to
be changed from transitive verbs. They are given
the general category B-aN-aN-bN. Many resulta-
tive verbs (VRD, in treebank annotation) have this
category. An example is given in (11).

Mandarin Chinese uses the particle 被 bei to
construct passive sentences. In bei constructions,

29



the patient argument of a verb, usually the sec-
ond argument of a transitive verb or a ba-verb, is
moved to the subject position of the clause. We
propose the particle 被 bei takes a bei-verb as its
complement. Bei-verbs, which are of the category
E-aN-gN, are derived from E-aN-bN by introduc-
ing a gap by rule Ga. E-aN-bN is derived by the
type conversion rule T from V-aN-bN or B-aN-
aN, transitive verbs or ba-verbs. Here is the lexi-
cal entry we propose for the bei particle.

被 ‘bei’ 7→ V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN:
λx (f0 x)=bei∧ (f3 x)=(f1 (f2 x))

The lexical entry of 被 bei stipulates that the
first argument of bei is the subject of its second ar-
gument, the VP complement, E-aN-gN. Since the
agent in the passive voice construction is optional
(as it is in passive voice in English), the category
of the bei particle can have a type change from
V-aN-b(E-aN-gN)-bN to V-aN-b(E-aN-gN). The
inference rule (Fc) is proposed for the composi-
tion of gap dependencies contained within suc-
ceeding arguments, where p ∈ P, ϕ ∈ {-a, -b}×C,
and ψ ∈ {-g}×C.

pϕ1...n−1-b(dψ):g dψ:h
⇒ pϕ:λx h (f1 x) (fn x) ∧g x (Fc)

Using rule Fc, the first argument of the bei particle
becomes the filler of the gap in the bei verb. This
rule also supports an analysis of tough construc-
tions in Chinese.

An example bei-construction which contains a
transitive verb is shown in (12).

The Penn Treebank uses the category ‘LB’ for
the bei particle where the optional agent argument
occurs, and ‘SB’ for the bei particle where it is
elided. Tse and Curran (2010) follow the Treebank
annotation, proposing two different categories for
the bei particle. For example the CCG category for
‘LB’ is (S\NPy)/(S\NPx/NPy)/NPx, in which a
coindexation scheme is used to ensure that the sub-
ject of bei is coindexed with the object of its verbal
complement. The ba particle, with the category

(S\NPy)/(S\NPy/NPx)/NPx, is different from bei
only in the coindexing scheme. However, if the
passivized verb is not a transitive verb, such as誉
为 ‘titled-as’ in Figure 1, it is hard to infer what
the coindexing scheme should be like in the CCG
analysis.

Figure 1 shows a GCG derivation of a sentence
from the Chinese Treebank. We use this sentence
to illustrate how topicalization, passive voice, and
relative clauses are analyzed in the GCG frame-
work and what kind of dependencies we can ex-
tract from GCG derivations.

4 Experiments

We use a set of reannotation rules similar to those
described by Nguyen et al. (2012) to reannotate
the Penn Chinese Treebank into GCG trees. These
reannotation rules work within a perl script that
traverses each bracketed sentence in the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank by selecting each pair of match-
ing brackets from the top of the tree to the bot-
tom, then running a sed-like pattern substitution
rule on each selection. With around 200 annota-
tion rules, we currently fully annotate 71% of sen-
tences (18,505 sentences out of 26,062) from the
Penn Chinese Treebank 5 and 6.

In order to evaluate the Chinese GCG annota-
tions in terms of parsing accuracy, we compare
the parsing performance of a latent-variable parser
trained on Chinese GCG annotations with that of
the same parser trained on Chinese CCG annota-
tions. The Chinese CCGbank is obtained by con-
verting the Penn Chinese Treebank into CCG an-
notations according to Tse and Curran (2012).6

We divided the fully annotated sentences in both
grammars into training, development and test sec-
tions according to the section divisions suggested
by Tse and Curran (2012). In order to have a
better understanding of how the parsing perfor-
mance changes with the size of the training data,
we trained the Chinese CCG parser on both the
full training set (ccg.full) and the same training
set used for training the Chinese GCG parser
(ccg.same). The detailed section divisions are
shown in Table 1.

For the two CCG parsers, ccg.full and ccg.same,
we use the Petrov and Klein (2007) latent variable
PCFG trainer, with 5 split-merge cycles, which
is the best setting indicated by Tse and Curran
(2012). As with CCG, we ran the Petrov et al.

reannotated training corpus. The PCFG trainer
was used ‘off the shelf’ and run with its default pa-
rameters, only varying the number of split-merge
iterations on the development section. We found 5
split-merge iterations yielded the best parsing per-
formance in the development section.

Tables 2 and 3 show the parsing performance of
the parsers on the development and test sets. The
parsing results show that a larger training set is
beneficial to the parsing performance of the Chi-
nese CCG parer; the parsing performance of the
CCG parser trained on the full training set per-
forms consistently better than the parser trained on
71% of the training set. The GCG parser, trained
on 71% of the training set, seems to parse rea-
sonably well even compared with the CCG parser
trained on the full training set. It is worth noting
that the GCG parser is much higher in tagging ac-
curacy than the CCG parser, which supports our
hypothesis that the CCG parser might suffer from
sparse data problems.

However, direct comparison of the parsing per-
formance of these two parsers is not fair because
these two grammars define different categories and
different tree structures. In order to ensure a fair
comparison between these grammars, it is neces-
sary to have them produce exactly the same tar-
get representation. In this experiment, we test
the parsing performance of these two grammars
on a common test set of sentences to which the
two grammars assign the same tree structure when
syntactic labels and unary branches are removed,
see Figure 2. We found 984 sentences in the test
set which have exactly the same unlabeled binary
structures (Figure 2c) in both grammars.

Table 4 shows the parsing results (F1) on parses
with both syntactic category labels and unary
branches removed (NoUnary+NoLab). After re-

moving unary branches, the parses have exclu-
sively binary tree structures and have identical re-
sults for precision, recall and F1 in parsing eval-
uations. Since both grammars predict exactly the
same binary tree structures with exactly the same
(‘X’) categories, significance testing is performed
on these predictions using bootstrap resampling.

Results in Table 4 show that the parsing per-
formance of the Petrov and Klein (2007) parser
trained on the GCG-reannotated corpus is more
accurate with strong significance (p < 0.001) than
the same parser trained on the CCG-reannotated
corpus of the same size. We observe a significant
improvement (p < 0.05) of the GCG parser over
the CCG parser trained on the full training set.

We believe that the Chinese CCG parser suffers
from data sparsity effects. Excluding those words
which are only associated with one preterminal
category, the lexical-categorial confusion rate is
3.45 for the Chinese CCG annotations and 2.59
for the Chinese GCG annotations, which is also
reflected in the large gap (more than 5 points) be-
tween their tagging accuracy. Enforcing a small
set of language-independent inference rules in the
Chinese CCG-annotations might have some for-
mal appeal, but it leads to a large set of syntac-
tic categories, many of which, such as nominal or
adverbial modifiers, are syntactically or semanti-
cally indistinguishable. Since the GCG described
in this paper uses a larger set of inference rules
and consequently fewer category labels, it suffers
fewer sparse data effects.

Figure 2: Constructing common test set

from the Penn Chinese Treebank. Unlike previous
efforts using strongly lexicalized CCG (Tse and
Curran, 2010), the reannotated corpus described
in this paper adopts a policy of moderate lexical-
ization, allowing both inference rules and lexical
categories to be language-specific. This modera-
tion offers considerable representational freedom,
particularly in modeling Chinese ba-, bei-, and de-
constructions, which make substantial use of un-
bounded dependencies. Experimental results ap-
pear to show that, while there may be some for-
mal appeal to a small universal set of language-
independent combinators (Steedman, 2000; Steed-
man, 2002; Steedman, 2012), the large category
set resulting from it might impose an empirical
cost for parsing tasks.
