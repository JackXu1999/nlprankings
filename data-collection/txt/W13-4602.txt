Abstract

Clinical decision support systems necessi-
tate a disease knowledge base, which com-
prises a set of clinical findings for each
disease. To efficiently represent the find-
ings, this paper explores the relationship
between clinical vocabulary and findings
in medical literature through quantitative
and qualitative analysis of representative
disease databases. Although the data vol-
ume and the analyzed features are limited,
the observations suggested the following.
First, there are sets of clinical findings that
are essential for physicians, but the ma-
jority of findings in medical literature are
not the essential ones. Second, deviation
of term frequency for clinical findings vo-
cabulary is minimal, and clinical findings
require appropriate grammar for efficient
representation of findings. Third, appro-
priate mapping of clinical findings with
clinical vocabulary would allow the effi-
cient expression of clinical findings.

1 Introduction

Clinical decision support systems necessitate a
knowledge base of diseases, which comprises ef-
ficient representations of signs and symptoms for
certain diseases. Such a knowledge base may ef-
ficiently represent a disease with relation to a set
of predefined findings, such as headache and nau-
sea. However, it is commonly observed that the
derivatives of such findings become a diagnostic
clue in the actual diagnosis process. For example,
morning headache may suggest a tumor in the cra-
nium, whereas cerebral hemorrhage may accom-
pany sudden headache. These cases illustrate that,
in clinical medicine, signs and symptoms modi-
fied with other elements may form a meaningful
cluster that carries clinically valuable information.

In order to represent the “concepts of clinical
findings” in an efficient manner, we are required to
maintain appropriate vocabulary, as well as a va-
riety of modifiers, such as where, when, and how
the signs appear. For an ontology of diseases, the
analysis of the relationship between such vocabu-
lary for clinical findings and concepts of clinical
findings is indispensable for efficient knowledge
representation.

Accordingly, the paper performs quantitative
and qualitative analysis of the vocabulary and
the concepts of clinical findings in a couple of
representative disease databases, OMIM (Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (McKusick, 2007)
and Orphanet (Aymé and Schmidtke, 2007). In
Section 2, we analyze the vocabulary of clinical
findings, by assessing the impact of the vocabu-
lary size against the coverage of words in descrip-
tions of diseases. In Section 3, variations of clini-
cal findings concepts are analyzed by assessing the
expressions of clinical findings in the same texts.
These analyses are followed by Section 4, which
discusses the observations of the preceding sec-
tions. Section 5 summarizes a survey of related
work, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Variation of clinical findings
vocabulary

In this section, the distribution of the terms for
clinical findings is measured by taking simple
statistics of terms used in OMIM and Orphanet.
OMIM contains descriptions of approximately
two thousand diseases in free format texts, and Or-
phanet has six thousand entries for diseases, in-
cluding rare diseases. In the processing, MetaMap
(Aronson and Lang, 2010; Aronson, 2001) is first
applied to the texts, to extract the terms related
to clinical findings. MetaMap is a tool to map
phrases in a given medical literature text with
UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) ter-
minology (Lindberg et al., 1993), coupled with

their semantic category. Then, the following sub-
ject categories of UMLS terms are used to ex-
tract clinical findings in the text: Acquired Abnor-
mality, Anatomical Abnormality, Cell or Molec-
ular Dysfunction, Congenital Abnormality, Dis-
ease or Syndrome, Embryonic Structure, Injury
or Poisoning, Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction,
Neoplastic Process, Sign or Symptom, and Virus.
Lastly, the frequency of the extracted terms is
measured, and the coverage of the symptomatic
terms in the documents is calculated by increasing
the vocabulary size in order of the term frequency.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of
the terms. As illustrated, the coverage of the
terms increases by adding terms for clinical find-
ings into the vocabulary, and the top 2000 words
covers 85% of the terms for clinical findings in
the databases. Beyond this point, the coverage be-
comes less responsive to the addition of terms, be-
cause they are infrequently used in the target doc-
uments. The figure suggests that the difference be-
tween OMIM and Orphanet for the observed ten-
dency is minimal.

To assess the size constraint of the vocabu-
lary, we measured the percentage of simple words
in the description of diseases. A clinical find-
ing can be a word, such as fever, a phrase, such
as periodic fever, or a sentence. If the por-
tion of word findings is limited among all ex-
pression types, the unlimited vocabulary size by
itself cannot achieve the appropriate representa-
tion of clinical findings. To estimate the upper
bound of the contribution by the unlimited vo-
cabulary, we analyzed the findings described in
randomly selected OMIM documents (Document
IDs: 108450, 113450 118450, 123450, 140450,

ings in OMIM 20 documents

259450, 265450, 267450, 305450, and 311450).
The 20 texts included 1368 clinical findings in to-
tal. A sample phrase and a sentence are excerpted
below:

“with most patients dying within 10 years of on-
set”
(OMIM 203450: Alexander Disease)

“No females manifested any symptoms.”
(OMIM 305450: Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome)

Table 1 shows the breakdown of the finding cat-
egories in the selected texts. The “Noun” cate-
gory is for single word. The “Phrase” category
is for phrases, which comprise phrases that repre-
sent either a concept, or a set of concepts. “Con-
cept” includes phrases that can be mapped to a
clinical concept, such as “mental retardation” and
“Tetralogy of Fallot”. “Set of concepts” is for
phrases that are mapped to multiple concepts. As
the table illustrates, the noun category accounts
for only 18.6% of the expressions for clinical find-
ings. Even if appropriate terminologies cover sim-
ple concepts for clinical findings (34.8%), they
share only 53.4% of the entire findings and 46.6%
of the expressions still necessitate phrases and sen-
tences. Although the distinction of a concept and
a set of concepts can be ambiguous in some cases,
this tendency suggests that even the unlimited vo-
cabulary cannot appropriately express all the clin-
ical findings because the portion for vocabulary is
limited in the actual descriptions of diseases.

3 Variation of clinical findings concepts

The last section explored the vocabulary, required
to express clinical findings. This section, in-
versely, examines clinical finding concepts in the
descriptions of diseases. For this purpose, we used
a set of clinical findings, compiled by Dr. Keijiro
Torigoe for his rudimentary diagnostic reminder
system (Torigoe et al., 2003). The dataset com-
prises 597 clinical manifestations, which include
common signs and symptoms as well as entries
for typical laboratory examinations results, such
as high white blood cell counts and low platelets.
The analysis in this section utilizes the essential
findings for physicians to code clinical findings in
the annotated OMIM texts. The entire setting is
illustrated in Figure 2.

First, we performed dictionary matching of the
essential finding, against the annotated OMIM
texts (Process 1, Figure 2). The simple dictio-
nary match showed that the essential findings ac-
counted for only 1.5% of the annotated elements.
Second, we applied a stemmer, Snowball (Porter,
2001), before the matching, which increased the

recall to 4.7% (Process 2, Figure 2). Third, for
further performance gain, we processed the essen-
tial findings with MetaMap and compiled the set
of 586 findings in UMLS Concept Unique Iden-
tifiers (CUI). Then, we performed the matching
against the result of the MetaMap processing on
the OMIM texts, which resulted in a 3.1% match
(Process 3, Figure 2).

The three stages illustrated that the essential
findings account for only 5% of the clinical find-
ings in the sample documents, and the failure
analysis suggested the following. First of all,
MetaMap mostly ignores prepositions and verbs,
which constitute essential parts in the expression
of the clinical findings. Second, MetaMap seg-
ments the texts into minimum phrases that have
corresponding CUI. However, annotators with a
clinical background tend to group multiple phrases
together, because they carry meaningful informa-
tion as clinical findings. This results in the further
mismatch between the MetaMap output and the
concepts of clinical findings. Lastly, the dataset
of essential findings could have missed some fre-
quent terms.

To verify the last conjecture and to detect un-
known frequent findings, we analyzed the failure
cases of UMLS matching. For this purpose, we
applied the same processing on the entire OMIM
and Orphanet texts and extracted unmatched cases
(Process 4, Figure 2). The output was sorted
in order of frequency and grouped into 10 clus-
ters, each of which contained 100 words. Fig-
ures 3 and 4 show the word count of terms in
each cluster (Note the range of y-axis is limited).
As illustrated, the first clusters of both graphs ex-
hibited striking peaks (Orphanet: 19898 counts
and OMIM: 86085 counts) for the top 100 words.
However, a detailed look revealed that half of the
terms were useless (NG class), because they are
functional terms that were mistakenly included by
the tag heuristics. The class Border denotes bor-
derline cases, which are clinical terms, but which
do not carry clinical meaning in the context, such
as (the) disease and (the) symptom.

Accordingly, we extracted the acceptable OK
terms in the top 1000 unmatched words and mea-
sured their contribution to the frequency distribu-
tion of the terms in the target documents. As Fig-
ure 5 illustrates, the contribution of the unmatched
words is limited: the top 100 unmatched words
accounted for 6.8% of the findings word count
for Orphanet documents, and 3.1% of the find-
ings word count for OMIM documents. In all,
the 1000 unmatched words contained 543 words
for Orphanet and 278 words for OMIM, which ac-
counted for 14.6% and 4.8% in the entire word
count, respectively. The Orphanet cases outper-
formed the OMIM cases, which could be partially
attributed to the difference in word counts (49,342

against 361,566). The majority of the cases in the
frequent unmatched words were technical terms,
such as microcephaly, hypertelorism, and facial
dysmorphism, which could be frequent for certain
classes of genetic disorders but clinically uncom-
mon.

The observation suggests that the number of es-
sential clinical findings is approximately several
hundreds, far below a thousand. These findings
account for just a few percent of clinical find-
ings documented in the descriptions of diseases
in representative disease databases. The concepts
of clinical findings in medical literature are di-
verse. Although some of the clinical finding con-
cepts might be well-known, such as anatomical
and congenital anomalies, most of them are clini-
cally uncommon and do not appear often in liter-
ature. Although manual matching might increase
the percentage, it is not likely that the overall pic-
ture would change.

4 Discussion

This paper explores the relationship between
clinical vocabulary and clinical findings through
the analysis of disease descriptions compiled in
OMIM and Orphanet. Figure 6 summarizes the
observations. The essential findings, found as
nouns in literature, are limited in number. This is
supported by other datasets. For example, Logo-
scope (Nash, 1960) is a manually operated diag-
nostic tool called the “diagnostic slide rule”, and
it defines a set of 82 essential findings. MeSH
(National Library of Medicine, 1963) has a cat-
egory for essential findings named “pathological
conditions and symptoms”, which includes 635
terms. Infrequent findings are the other type of
nouns, which can be mapped to corresponding
terms in standardized vocabulary. There are other
types of clinical findings, distinctive and descrip-
tive findings, although the classification is ten-
tative. Distinctive findings are those expressed
by phrases, and descriptive findings are the most
complex findings, which can be expressed only by
sentences.

It is desirable that the findings are properly

mental retardation
intellectual deficiency
intellectual impairment
language delay
learning difficulties
poor school performance
delayed psychomotor development
psychomotor delay
psychomotor retardation

Table 2: Expressions for mental retardation

mapped onto the clinical findings vocabulary.
However, it is not an easy task to map them, as
suggested throughout the paper. For appropriate
representation of clinical findings concepts, vo-
cabulary alone cannot bridge the gap, and a gram-
mar with appropriate descriptive power is indis-
pensable. However, there is a tradeoff between the
descriptive power and the cost for knowledge ac-
quisition and representation.

The knowledge acquisition of clinical findings
is still a challenging task for Natural Language

11



Processing (NLP). Physicians may describe a find-
ing in a sentence, which is common for patho-
logical and radiological findings. Such a finding
might have a corresponding term, and an elabo-
rated system might cleverly map the sentence into
a standardized vocabulary. However, this pro-
cess involves various tasks, such as processing of
negation, dependency, ambiguity, and abstraction,
most of which are still unreliable for clinical use at
this point. Even mapping of phrases is a challenge.
For example, physicians may describe the concept
“mental retardation” in diverse ways. Table 2 de-
notes how the concept is expressed in OMIM and
Orphanet. Although MetaMap is a useful tool for
mapping clinical terms, it still falls short of the re-
quired performance, to map sentences and phrases
into standardized vocabulary.

The high cost of knowledge acquisition also ap-
plies to knowledge representation. Structured de-
scription of knowledge requires a grammar, which
also burdens the data utilization process. Accord-
ingly, it would be beneficial to reduce the cost for
data representation, in addition to the improve-
ment of knowledge acquisition performance. In
this regard, physicians may express findings in
phrases and sentences, when the findings are un-
familiar, or when they do not recall the appropri-
ate terms even if one exists that corresponds to the
concept. Examples include laboratory findings as
illustrated at the bottom of Figure 6. Because a
noun is the simplest form of knowledge, mapping
of sentences and phrases into the terms might con-
tribute to reducing the representation cost as well
as the cost for data utilization.

5 Related works

Numerous research efforts have been made in the
field of Natural Language Processing toward pre-
cise acquisition and representation of knowledge
in clinical medicine.

First of all, there is a class of works aimed at
boosting the accuracy of finding clinical mani-
festations in medical texts. Since the pioneering
work (Sneiderman et al., 1996) in this problem
domain, there have been various studies that in-
vestigated basic technologies required for accurate
mining. Chapman proposed negation detection
(Chapman et al., 2001) for clinical texts, which
was extended to context handling methods (Chap-
man et al., 2007). Other groups focused on knowl-
edge acquisition of diseases (Achour et al., 2001;

Aleksovska-Stojkovska and Loskovska, 2010).
Second, researchers have worked on the knowl-

edge representation issue for clinical findings. In
addition to UMLS (Lindberg et al., 1993), which
is used in this paper, SNOMED-CT (International
Health Terminology Standard Development Or-
ganisation, 2001), MeSH (National Library of
Medicine, 1963), OpenGALEN (Rector et al.,
2003), and MedDRA (MedDRA Maintenance and
Support Services Organization, 2007) have been
used for the representation of clinical concepts.
There are other studies in this domain (Sager et
al., 1994; Cimino, 1991; Kong et al., 2008; Peleg
and Tu, 2006).

Lastly, there have been several lines of work
that explored the tools for information extrac-
tion on clinical reports. For example, (Fried-
man et al., 1994) developed Medical Language
Extraction and Encoding (MedLEE) to encode
clinical documents in a structured form. The
Mayo Clinic also developed a similar NLP sys-
tem (cTakes) (Savova et al., 2010) for clinical re-
ports and TEXT2TABLE (Aramaki et al., 2009)
targeted Japanese discharge summaries.

6 Conclusion

This paper investigated clinical vocabulary and
clinical finding concepts. Because the analysis is
made with a limited set of data, further study is re-
quired for more rigorous proof. Nevertheless, the
current observations suggest the following.

First, there are essential findings for physicians
and, in medical literature, the majority of the find-
ings do not fall into the category. This observation
is consistent with the fact that annotated findings
tend to span multiple words.

Second, the deviation of the term frequency for
clinical findings vocabulary is minimal, and the
vocabulary alone cannot express all the clinical
findings. Even with the UMLS terminology, the
expressive power is limited, which necessitates an
appropriate grammar for structured descriptions of
findings.

Third, knowledge acquisition of clinical find-
ings is costly, and the grammar would escalate the
cost for representation, as well as the cost for data
utilization. However, appropriate mapping of clin-
ical findings and clinical vocabulary, particularly
for infrequent terms, might contribute toward ex-
pressing clinical findings without increasing the
cost for representation and for utilization.
