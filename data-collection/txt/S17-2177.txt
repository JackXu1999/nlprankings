Abstract 

This study proposes a system to automati-
cally analyze clinical temporal events in a 
fine-grained level in SemEval-2017. Sup-
port vector machine (SVM) and condition-
al random field (CRF) were implemented 
in our system for different subtasks, in-
cluding detecting clinical relevant events 
and time expression, determining their at-
tributes, and identifying their relations 
with each other within the document. Do-
main adaptation was the main challenge 
this year. Unified Medical Language Sys-
tem was consulted to generalize events 
specific to each domain. The results 
showed our system’s capability of domain 
adaptation. 

1 Introduction 

This study proposes a system to participate in the 
Clinical TempEval 2017 shared task, which fo-
cuses on the detection and classification of tem-
poral events in clinical data. To better utilize the 
information in clinical data, temporal event ex-
traction is fundamental in previous researches 
(Bethard et al., 2016). Unlike previous studies, 
the training and the test data are in different do-
mains this year. The task is further separated into 
two phases: unsupervised domain adaption and 
supervised domain adaption. We took part in the 
supervised domain adaption where data of 591 
records of colon cancer patients and 30 records of 
brain cancer patients from Mayo clinic were giv-
en. Based on the THYME corpus (Styler IV et al., 
2014), we propose a framework that automatical-
ly analyzes clinical temporal events in a fine-
grained level. Our framework identifies temporal 

events in unstructured text and further labels 
every event with its attributes.  

The task consists of three major subtasks. The 
first one is to detect clinical relevant events and 
time expressions in a given medical record. From 
the unstructured text, both the spans of time ex-
pressions and the spans of event mentions are 
identified.  

The second subtask is analyzing the attributes 
of time expressions and event mentions. A time 
expression will be classified into one of six types: 
DATE, TIME, DURATION, QUANTIFIER, 
PREPOSTEXP, and SET. An event mention con-
tains four properties such as type of an event, po-
larity, degree and modality. Our model labels the-
se four properties to every event mention.   

The final subtask is to determine two kinds of 
relations within the text. DocTimeRel is the rela-
tion between the document creation time and an 
event mention. Four types of DocTimeRel includ-
ing BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP, and BE-
FORE-OVERLAP are annotated in THYME. In 
addition to DocTimeRel, our model also recog-
nizes the narrative container of an event mention 
called TLINK in this task. There are five types of 
TLINK, including BEFORE, CONTAIN, OVER-
LAP, BEGINS-ON, and ENDS-ON.  

The outcomes of our system are not only the 
clinical temporal events, but also their detailed 
properties and their temporal relations with other 
events. The results of our framework can be fur-
ther used to discover relationships between ill-
nesses, symptoms, medications, and procedures.  

2 Methods 

Our system contains five modules: the first one 
identifies the span and the type of each event 
mention; the second one determines the other re-

maining attributes of an event mention; the third 
one identifies the span and the type of each time 
expression; the fourth one determines the TLINK 
between each pair of event mention and time ex-
pression in the same sentence; the fifth one deter-
mines the TLINK between each pair of event 
mentions in the same sentence.  

2.1 Preprocessing 
We ran Stanford CoreNLP toolkit (Manning et al., 
2014) on all the clinical data. This toolkit generat-
ed POS and NER for each word, and depend-
encies for each sentence in the clinical data. A dic-
tionary was built based on Unified Medical Lan-
guage System  (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004) with 
five categories of different genre of medical relat-
ed words, including DIAGNOSIS, EXAMINE, 
MEDICINE, POSITION and SURGERY. All of 
these were utilized in the following steps. 

2.2 Event Mention Identification 
In this module, we tried to identify the span de-
noting an event and its type. There are three types 
of event mentions, including ASPECTUAL, EV-
IDENTIAL, and N/A. ASPECTUAL event men-
tions often turn out to be verbs indicating some-
thing would happen later in the timeline, like “re-
occur”, “continue”, etc. EVIDENTIAL events are 
usually verbs like “show”, “reveal”, and “con-
firm”, which show how doctors come to identify 
and learn about other events. N/A events are most-
ly composed of medical related words like “nau-
sea”, “surgery”, and “operate”.  

We built a four-way linear SVM classifier us-
ing scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) to classify 
a word into ASPECTUAL, EVIDENTIAL, N/A, 
or non-event. In other words, span identification 
and type classification are done simultaneously. 
Features for our SVM classifier are listed as fol-
lows: 
Lexical Feature: n-gram of nearby words, and 
character n-gram within the target word 
POS Feature: POS n-gram of nearby words 
Named Entity Type: type of named entities iden-
tified by NER 
Orthographic Feature: orthographic n-gram of 
nearby words obtained by substituting all upper-
case letters, lowercase letters, and digits with ‘A’, 
‘a’, and ‘0’. 
Structural Features: 1) position of the target 
word divided by the sentence length, and 2) the 

length of the path from the target word to the root 
in the dependency-parsing tree.  
UMLS Category: the category of the target word 
based on UMLS. 

 Since training set and test set come from two 
different domains, i.e., colon cancers versus brain 
cancers, there may be some medical terms in test 
set but not appearing in training set. In this study, 
UMLS dictionary was consulted to cluster the 
medical terms into the five categories in order to 
deal with domain adaptation problem and reduce 
sparseness. For example, terms specific to colon 
cancer “right hemicolectomy” and “rectum” 
would be transformed into “SURGERY” and 
“POSITION”, respectively, while building n-gram 
features. 

2.3 Event Attribute Identification 
Besides modality, polarity, and degree, we include 
DocTimeRel from the relation subtask here be-
cause it is also an attribute along with an event 
mention. We trained a multi-class linear SVM 
classifier for each of the four attributes. The fea-
tures described in Section 2.2 were used. In addi-
tions, we introduced time related features for 
DocTimeRel, including tense of verbs within the 
same sentence, n-gram and POS n-gram of time 
related terms within the same sentence, and the 
relative position of the time related terms within 
the same sentence.  

2.4 Time Expression Identification 
Time expression identification is different from 
event mention identification because time expres-
sion is less affected by the change of domain. 
However, its spans are more diverse than those in 
event mention. For instance, a SET time expres-
sion is usually composed of multiple words like 
“three times a week”. By contrast, a PRE-
POSTEXP is mostly just one word only, like 
“preoperative”. To deal with the issue of diverse 
spans, we used CRF1 to develop this module be-
cause of its ability in sequence labeling. Similarly 
to Section 2.2, we also determined the span and 
the type simultaneously. 

Besides those features (UMLS Category ex-
cluded) used in Section 2.2, we added some other 
features, including the existence of pre-post relat-
ed characters (“pre”, “post”, “peri”, and “intra”), 
the existence of a number, and whether there is a

duration condition in the same sentence (“for”, 
“since”, “through”, “until”, and “in”).  

2.5 TLINKs between Event Mentions and 
Time Expressions 

TLINK is determined between event mentions, 
and between event mentions and time expressions. 
TLINKs are mostly linked within the same sen-
tence, thus we focused on identifying TLINKs 
within sentences.  

Two multi-class SVM classifiers were built for 
five subtypes in TLINK: the first one was trained 
to identify TLINKs given a pair of time expres-
sion and event mention, which we called “TE 
classifier”, and the second one was trained to 
identify TLINKS given a pair of event mentions, 
which we called “EE classifier”.  

Features we used are shown as follows: 
Features for both classifiers: types, attributes, 
tokens and POS of the pair of mentions, punctua-
tions between the pair of mentions, tense of the 
nearest verbs, and dependency path between the 
pair of mentions.   
Features only for EE classifier: if exists a time 
expression which is linked to both event mention 
by the TE classifier, types of the two TLINKs 
were considered as features 

3 Results 

We used the clinical data provided in the super-
vised domain adaption, which contained 591 rec-
ords of colon cancer patients and 30 records of 
brain cancer patients, to train our system. Table 1 
shows the results of event mentions, time expres-
sion and relations, where F1 stands for F1 score, P 
stands for precision, and R stands for recall.

4 Discussion 

The F1 scores of event mentions in brain cancer 
patients are lower than in colon cancer patients. It 
is mostly contributed by the decrease in precision. 
Without the ground truths, we can only assume 
that our system still learned some domain-specific 
features to tell event apart from non-event under 
the replacement of words with classes according 
to UMLS. The scores of TLINK have the same 
problem as event mentions. 

Interestingly, the performance of time expres-
sion, which we thought to be free from the chal-
lenge of domain adaptation, decreases drastically 
in all three scores. It is certain that some domain 
specific features played big roles in our system. 
However, without the ground truths, it is difficult 
to identify the problem. 

 CRF and SVM were both experimented for 
time expressions and shown in Table 3. With the 
same features, CRF performed better than SVM in 
F1 score and precision. The results show that CRF 
has a better performance in sequence labeling. 
Advanced deep learning model including convo-
lution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural 
network (RNN) will be explored in the future due 
to their advantages in sequence labeling.

Compared to the best results of other runs in 

this shared task, which is shown in Table 4, Doc-
TimeRel is the most poorly predicted attribute by 
our system. DocTimeRel is the relationship be-
tween an event and its document creation time. 
However, the features we chose for this subtask 
were all confined to one sentence. Adding features 
capturing the time representations within neigh-
boring sentences, within the section, or even with-
in whole document should increase the perfor-
mance.  

TLINK is another attributes that our system 
performed notably worse than the first place. This 
is possibly due to the chain effect where TLINK 
was determined based on event mentions and time 
expressions that were already with worse perfor-
mance. Once ruling out this possibility, we can 
then focus on how to improve our TLINK mod-
ule. 

5 Conclusion  

In this paper, we proposed a system to participate 
in the Clinical TempEval 2017 shared task. Our 
system not only identified the clinical temporal 
events, but also their detailed properties and their 
temporal relations with other events.  It can also 
take on the challenge of domain adaptation where 
only a few data from targeted domain was given 
while the other data were from different domain. 
Our system adopted SVM and CRF for different 
subtasks. The results were in the third place in su-
pervised domain adaptation. 

In future works, we will focus on the increasing 
the performance in DocTimeRel and explore deep 
learning algorithms.
