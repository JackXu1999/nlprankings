Abstract

Machine Translation has made significant
achievements for the past decades. How-
ever, in many languages, the complex-
ity with its rich inflection and agglutina-
tion poses many challenges, that forced
for manual translation to make the cor-
pus available. The divergence in lexi-
cal, syntactic and semantic in any pair
of languages makes machine translation
more difficult. And many systems still de-
pend on rules heavily, that deteriates sys-
tem performance. In this paper, a study
on divergence in Malayalam-Tamil lan-
guages is attempted at source language
analysis to make translation process easy.
In Malayalam-Tamil pair, the divergence
is more reported in lexical and structural
level, that is been resolved by using bilin-
gual dictionary and transfer grammar. The
accuracy is increased to 65 percentage,
which is promising.
Keywords- Translational divergence; se-
mantic; syntactic; lexical;

1 Introduction

The problem with divergence in machine trans-
lation in a complex topic, which can be defined
as the differences that occur in language with re-
spect to the grammar. The divergence mainly oc-
curs when these occur a translation from a source
language to the target language. For any MT sys-
tem, this topic is very crucial as to obtain an accu-
rate translation, it is very much needed to resolve
the nature of translational divergence. This diver-
gence can be seen at different levels. Based on the
complexity that occur in the specific translation,
divergence affects the translation quality. Some
translational divergences are universal in the sense
that they occur across the languages while certain

others are specific with respect to the language
pair (Lavanya et al., 2005; Saboor and Khan,
2010). Hence, the divergence in the translation
need to be studied both perspectives that is across
the languages and language specific pair (Sinha,
2005).The most problematic area in translation is
the lexicon and the role it plays in the act of creat-
ing deviations in sense and reference based on the
context of its occurrence in texts (Dash, 2013).

Indian languages come under Indo-Aryan or
Dravidian scripts. Though there are similarities
in scripts, there are many issues and challenges
in translation between languages such as lexical
divergences, ambiguities, lexical mismatches, re-
ordering, syntactic and semantic issues, structural
changes etc. Human translators try to choose the
correct wording by using knowledge from various
sources, and the factors like phonology, orthogra-
phy, morphology as well as knowledge of the per-
son, and cultural differences influences the trans-
lation. Therefore, it is hard to get a translation
of one person as same as other translator. MT
is a complex and challenging research area be-
cause language translation itself is very difficult.
While human processes language understanding
and translation on many levels, but a machine pro-
cesses data, with its linguistic form and structure,
it is difficult to get the sense. This requires more
of cognitive and intelligent systems in NLP, rather
than considering MT development only in linguis-
tic point of view. Many works have been per-
formed based on linguistic and lexical level, but
MT across the languages is a challenging task for
several reasons like, the difference in the structure
of source and target languages, ambiguity, multi-
word units like idioms, phrases and tense genera-
tion and many more. In this paper, we have con-
sidered two Dravidian languages Malayalam and
Tamil and various challenges and issues in seman-
tic and syntactical in both the languages are dis-
cussed.189



Malayalam and Tamil belong to Dravidian lan-
guage family. Malayalam and Tamil are closely
related to each other in grammar with a rich liter-
ary tradition. However, Malayalam is highly influ-
enced by Sanskrit language at lexical, grammat-
ical and phonemic levels where as Tamil is not.
The Noun morphology is same in both the lan-
guages as the word may contain the root alone
or root with suffixes attached to it. Agglutination
is widely seen in Tamil and Malayalam. In both
languages, the case markers are found to be at-
tached to the nouns and pronouns. Post-positions
are also seen to be attached to these. Morphology
includes inflection, sandhi, and derivation. The
Tamil verbs inflect for person, number and gender
whereas Malayalam verbs do not. Hence the gen-
der marking of the noun is not a relevant feature
when Malayalam is considered.

Language divergence in most cases result in the
ambiguities in translation. The divergence issue
across a language is associated with many fac-
tors ranging from linguistic, cultural, and societal
to psychological aspects of the languages. Syn-
tactic and lexico-semantic divergence is the two
board categories of divergence proposed by Dorr.
Sentence level ambiguities are referred as syntac-
tic while at the word level is semantic. A hybrid
approach to develop the Malayalam to Tamil MT
system comprising paradigm, rule and machine
learning methods are proposed. The system deals
with the analysis, transfer, and generation process.
The issues being raised in the various stages in
the development of the Machine Translation are
discussed here. The next section deals with the
related works carried out in this area. In sec-
tion 3, various translational divergences are con-
sidered with respect to Malayalam and Tamil lan-
guages. Some other types of divergences found
while translation are discussed in next section.
Fifth sections give the methods for handling the
divergence and finally the paper is concluded in
section 6.

2 State of Art

Dorr (1994) gives a systematic solution to the
problem of divergence derived from the formal-
ization of two different information namely the
linguistic ground on which the lexical and se-
mantic divergence are based and the technique to
solve these problems. The paper explains mainly
seven types of divergence with examples with re-

spect to English, Spanish and German. The paper
focuses on Thematic, promotional, demotional,
structural, conflational, categorical and lexical di-
vergences. Barnett et al. (1994) divide distinc-
tions between source and target languages into
two categories mainly translation divergences and
translation mismatches. The information con-
veyed in source and target language remain same
while the structure of the sentence differ in transla-
tional divergence (1990). In definition of lexical-
semantic representation and translation mappings
is described. The paper discussed on the justifi-
cation for distinguishing promotional and demo-
tional divergence, the limits imposed on the range
of repositioning possibilities, notion of full cover-
age in context of lexical selection and resolution of
interacting divergence types. The paper concludes
with a brief description of UNITRAN, a system
for translation across a variety of languages, which
accommodates the divergence types.

Nizar and Dorr (2002) proposed a novel ap-
proach to handle divergence in translation in a
Generation-Heavy Hybrid Machine Translation
(GHMT)system. Deep symmetric knowledge of
source and target language is required for these ap-
proach. Various examples are illustrated to show
the interaction between statistical and symbolic
knowledge in GHMT system.

Dorr (1990) presented a mechanisms for map-
ping an underlying lexical-conceptual structure to
a syntactic structure used by the UNITRAN. Also
explains the ways to solve the problem of thematic
divergences in machine translation. The solution
is implemented in the bidirectional system for En-
glish, Spanish, and German. The two types of
thematic divergence namely the reordering of ar-
guments for a given predicate and reordering of
predicates with respect to arguments or modifiers
is explained. They presented three mechanisms to
solve the thematic divergences with a set of gen-
eral linking routines

Zhiwei (2006) describes different types of trans-
lation divergence in Machine Translation. Even
though, translation divergence occurs at all phases
of MT, the author concentrated on the translation
divergence in the transfer phase. The translational
divergence that are found in lexical selection in
target language, in tense in thematic relation, in
head-switch, in structure, in category, in conflation
is described. The ambiguity with respect to syn-
tactical, semantic and contextual that relate with190



the co-occurrence based approaches for the selec-
tion of translation equivalence. The author also
suggests the use of feature vector to represent the
co-occurrence cluster. The paper proposes some
suggestions in Mt system.

Akeel and Mishra (2013) discussed about the
language divergences and the ambiguities present
in English to Arabic machine translation and the
control methods used to resolve the same. the
authors have implemented English to Arabic ma-
chine translation system using ANN and rule
based approach. The proposed system is capable
of handling conventional type of ambiguities like
lexical and syntactic ambiguity and also structural
divergences. The lexical ambiguities include cat-
egory, homograph, transfer or translational, pro-
noun reference, gender and number. The word-
order, agreement, tense and aspect are various
structural divergence explained in the paper.

Dave et al. (2001) have studied the language
divergence between English and Hindi. This pa-
per also studied the implication of language diver-
gence in machine translation using Universal Net-
working Language (UNL), introduced by united
Nation University, to facilitate the transfer and
exchange of information over the internet. The
language divergence between these languages is
considered as divergence between SOV and SVO
classes of languages. Two criteria are considered
for deciding the effectiveness of an interlingua.
The first criteria is that the meaning conveyed by
source text should be apparent from the interlin-
gual representation. The next is a generator should
be able to produce a target language sentence that
a native speaker of that language accepts as nat-
ural. The use of lexical resources in constructing
a semantically rich dictionary semi-automatically
with an overview of major differences between
English and Hindi is described. The syntactic and
lexical-semantic divergences between Hindi and
English from a computational linguistic perspec-
tive is explained.

Kulkarni et al. (2014) studied various diver-
gence pattern that occurred between English and
Marathi language pair translation. Their study in-
volved the divergences based on lexico-sematic
and syntactic. They further classified lexico-
semantic divergence into thematic divergence,
structural divergence, promotional and demo-
tional divergence, conflational and inflational di-
vergence, categorical divergence and lexical diver-

gence. Syntactic divergence include constituent-
order divergence, adjunction divergence, null-
subject divergence and pleonastic divergences.
They also focused on divergence that occurred
in English and Marathi machine translation that
are common. These include divergence found in
replicative words, morphological gaps, determiner
systems, honorific differences, word related diver-
gences. All the translation divergences are ex-
plained with relevant examples.

Jayan et al. (2012) conducted a study to know
the pattern of the source and target languages and
the morphophonemic changes occurring during
the translation of a sentence. The paper focused on
the different types of divergence that occur among
this language pair. The non-configurational na-
ture of Malayalam is being explained with vari-
ous examples. Author discusses the complexity
of translational divergence among their language
pair and provides a solution to classify and resolve
the divergence problem. The paper gives a brief
idea about the English Malayalam MAT system
based on the Anglabharathi, which is an interlin-
gua based approach.

Goyal and Sinha (2009) discusses the transla-
tion pattern between English-Sanskrit and Hindi
- Sanskrit of various constructions to identify the
divergence in these language pairs. Through this
the authors come up with strategies to handle these
situations and also with correct translations. The
base of their classification of translation diver-
gence is presented by Dorr (1994).

Sinha and Thakur (2005) studied different pat-
terns of translation divergences both from Hindi to
English and English to Hindi keeping in view the
classification of translation divergence proposed
by Dorr. They have observed that there are a num-
ber of areas in Hindi-English translation pair that
fall under translation divergence but cannot be ac-
counted for within the existing parameters of clas-
sification strategy.

Mishra and Mishra (2009) proposed a method to
detect and implement the adaptation rules for the
divergence in English to Sanskrit machine trans-
lation. The divergences in language between En-
glish and Sanskrit can be considered as represent-
ing the divergences between SVO (Subject - Verb -
Object) and SOV (Subject - Object - Verb) classes
of languages. The type of divergence detected is
based on different aspects like linguistic to socio-
and psycho-linguistic, role of conjunctions and191



particles, participle, gerunds and socio-cultural as-
pects. They have performed a novel method that
uses rules and ANN technique to detect and im-
plement the adaptation rules for the divergence in
English to Sanskrit machine translation.

Gupta and Chatterjee (2003) presented adap-
tation for English-Hindi EBMT. They have dis-
cussed the issue of adaptation, in general, with
special emphasis to divergence. Their work looks
at adaptation of EBMT between English and
Hindi. They have given special attention to the
study of divergence by recognizing six different
categories of divergence and providing schemes
for identifying them

3 Translational Divergence

The divergence study is mainly dealt with lan-
guages. Divergence is a language dependent phe-
nomenon and is not necessary that same set of
divergences will occur across all the languages.
Lexico-semantic translation divergences are ac-
counted for by means of parameterization of the
lexicon (Dorr, 1993). The reason behind diver-
gence mainly lies with the incompatibility of a lan-
guage with another, a common phenomenon for
almost all natural languages. There are situations
where a sentence in the source language needs to
be translated in the target language in entirely dif-
ferent forms, making the task of both translations
a difficult process.

3.1 Conflational and Inflational Divergence

Conflational divergence occurs when the sense
conveyed by a single word is expressed by two or
more words in one of the languages. The opposite
case of conflational divergence is referred to by in-
flational divergence. The problem due to the lex-
ical gap, an instance where there is an absence of
a wordto express a specific concept of the source
word in the target language during the translation
process. Not all the words in one language have
equivalent words in another language. In some
cases a word in one language is to be expressed
by a group of words or phrases in another. For ex-
amples:
ed (vala) : 
0ñ � U,Pñ P`�ñ �(ñ (Pñ (kiNaR-
Rai muuTum maraccaTTam)
u]S (peeta) : Hajhñ ��Xñ XHñ H,Pñ �2Hñ L
(paalil ceyyappaTum inippu)
In²teÉ (kaal˜veLLa): Ha88ñ :ñ �*Hñ H�:
(paattatin aTippakuti)

3.2 Lexical Divergence

This type of divergences arises mainly due to the
lack of an exact lexical map for a word or con-
struction in one language into another. Most of
the conflational and inflational divergence overlap
with lexical divergence.

3.3 Syntactic Ambiguity

A word may belong to more than one POS
category, resulting in the syntactic ambiguity.
This is a problem with the parsing resulting in the
source language. There is a lack of one-to-one
correspondence of parts of speech between two
languages. For examples: can be INTF or PRP,
can be NN or PSP, can be PSP or VM etc.
Ae°/PRP A}Xbqw/QF Zrcw/NN _ho²/NN
\oÁm/VM u]nbo/VM ./SYM
(avan/̃PRP atrayuM/QF duuraM/NN basil˜/NN
ninn/VM pooyi/VM ./SYM )
Ae°/PRP AeotS/NST \oÁm/PSP CuÃn³/RB
Clºo/VM ./SYM
(avan˜/PRP aviTe/NST ninn/PSP ippooL˜/RB
iRangngi/VM ./SYM)
In the first sentence, word “\oÁm” refers to
“stood” while in the second sentence the same
word means “from”. Another example

3.4 Null Subject Divergence

In Malayalam subject dropping can be seen fre-
quently. But Tamil has restrictions in subject drop-
ping. If the verb occurring in Tamil is an action at
the end of a sentence, then subject dropping is not
possible. But if it occurs in a statement, null sub-
ject construction is possible.

3.5 Agreement Divergence

Given two languages may have completely differ-
ent structures. Malayalam is free-word order lan-
guage while Tamil has SOV structure, so to iden-
tify the phrase performing the function of the sub-
ject in the sentence is a challenging process. Gen-
der issues in translation are a subject that serves
to point out the limitations of machine translation.
The agreement between the subject and verb is
one of the problematic issues in MT. The Tamil
verbs depend on the PNG (Person Number Gen-
der) information about nouns. Malayalam verbs
do not depend on this information. Hence the gen-
der marking of the noun is not a relevant feature
when Malayalam is considered.192

From the above Table 1, for a single word “ecq-
I ”we have present tense “ecqÁq”, past tense “e-
Áq” and future tense “ecqw” in Malayalam, there
have eleven forms for each tense in Tamil depend-
ing the agreement of a verb with the subject.

3.6 Semantic Divergence

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) or Lexical
Ambiguity Resolution is a fundamental task,
which processes to identify the sense of a word
in a given sentence. Words can have more than
one meaning and sometimes group of words or
whole sentence may have more than one meaning
in a language resulting in the ambiguities.Words
having multiple meanings are called polysemy.
Word disambiguation is another major challenge
in translation where a same word can act differ-
ently based on the context. For examples:
chw (rasaM) - A\qõrXo, Ilo, Cww, cqNo,
AõocqNo, ta±·qlo

(anubhuuti, kaRi, ishTaM, ruci, abhiruci, mer˜
kkuRi)
djoXanb uNcqeI³ uN±¿qÉ IqcqaqjIm chw

Iko·qÁXm Zi\t¿ hinbo·qw.

(laLitamaaya ceeruvakaL˜ceert̃tuLLa kurumuLak

rasaM kazhikkunnat dahanatte sahaayikkuM.)
Ae\m ASq¿otSbnbo FuÁnSm A}X chw CÈ.

(avan˜aTuttuTeyaayi ennooT atra rasaM illa.)

The word in the above two sentences clearly
distinguishes the difference in meanings respec-
tively “curry” and “realization”. Other examples:
\S (naTa) - }Iob, \S·qI, ]So

(kRIya , naTakkuka , paTi)
ASo (aTi) - NqeSjem , ]nZw, XÈm

(cuvaTaLav , paadaM , tall)
en\w (vaanaM) - an\w, Aõoan\w

(maanaM , abhimaanaM)
D¿cw (uttaraM) - alq]So, uNnuZny¿cw, Xnºm

(maRupaTi, coodyoottaraM, taangng)

From the above examples here the word “\-
S” can act as Noun as well as Verb depending
on the context. This is applicable for both
the languages. Thus the differences are either
because of the absence of a concept or due to the
differences at the level of identifying concepts.
The case where there is an absence of a concept
is comparatively easier to handle than the cases
where the domains overlap with other domains.193



Unless the correct meaning is captured, there are
more chances for incorrect translation.

3.7 Structural Divergence

Both the languages have almost same grammatical
structures. But there occurs some minor variations
in the construction of the sentences
Ae° CÁtd ho\oabm·m u]nbo. Rn\qw.

( avan˜innale sinimaykk pooyi. njaanuM. )
�pñ �@ñ  :�`Hñ H(8ñ :@ñ �Pñ �Haañ . @aPñ
�Ha�ñ .
(avan ndeeRR tiraippTattindkum poonaan.
ndaanum pooneen. )
In the above example, in second sentence, its not
necessary to specify “u]nbo” poyi with “Rn\qw”
njaanuM as its understood from the sentence
construction. But in Tamil, this construction is not
seen.

4 Other issues in Translation

4.1 Idiom Translation

An idiom can be defined as a phrase or sentence
whose meaning is not specific from meaning of
its individual units and that must be learnt as a
whole unit. These are used in written as well as
verbal communication, giving a stylistic way of
delivering a message. While translating idioms
from Malayalam to Tamil, some phrases can only
be translated with correct sense, but some others
can only be transliterated only.

Rñ Dp�8hñ haPñ �Hañ @hñ h
(minnuvatellaam poonnalla.)
In the above example, the correct translation is
possible but in below example literal translation
of the phrase gives an incorrect translation.

(kaiyaala puRatte teengnga poole.)
P:hñ �Phñ M�@ �Hah
(matil meel puunai poola )

4.2 Divergence in Copula Transfer

A copula is a verb or verb like word, capable of
functioning as a main verb in a sentence. These
are different from action verbs grammatically and
semantically. In Malayalam, “BIm ” (aak) and
“D¾m ” (uNT) functions as copula while Tamil
lacks copula.
cna\m hpXtb Cww BWm.

(raaman siitaye ishTaM aaN.)
�`aP�ñ � ��8�X J*�ñ �Pñ
(iraamavukku ciitaiyai pitikkum)
While translating from Malayalam to Tamil, cop-
ula is not needed as the translation without copula
gives a meaningful sentence in Tamil .

4.3 Stylistic Variations

All languages have its own style. There are
sentences in Malayalam for which direct transla-
tion in Tamil is not possible. There occur such
sentences where many to one mappings can be
seen from Malayalam to Tamil. The example
below depicts this nature:
\p FeotS u]nIqÁq.

( nii eviTe pookunnu)
\p Fuºn½m u]nIqÁq.

( nii engngooTT pookunnu)
C �@ñ �ñ �� �Ha
`aXñ
(nii efkai pookiraay)
\p FeotSbnWm u]nIqÁXm.

\p Fuºn½nWm u]nIqÁXm.

(nii engngooTTaaN pookunnu)
C �@ñ �ñ �� �Ha
`aXñ
(nii efkai pookiraay)

For the all four sentences shown above in
Malayalam, there is only one equivalent transla-
tion in Tamil. In Malayalam, there is usages like
“InWqÁq¾m ” (kaaNunnuNT) , “u]nIqÁq¾m”
(pookunnuNT). Tamil doesn’t have these struc-
ture, which makes error in translation.
Rn° \ntj Aet\ InWqÁq¾m.

(ndaan ndaaLai avanee paarppeen.)
@añ @a� �p� Hañ̀ �ñ �rd�ñ

(ndaan ndaaLai avanai paarkkavirukkiReen.)

Other difference mostly found is the drop-
ping of a word from a sentence in Tamil which is a
must in Malayalam. In the examples given below,
“HÁm ” (onn) from first sentence and “Hcq” (oru)
from second sentence is droped. The following
examples demonstrate this typical characteristics.

5 Handling Divergences

The divergence found in the MT system cannot
be handled completely by the system itself as
sometimes there may not be word meanings that
can be replaced exactly. Various modules are
built for bridging the divergence encountered
while translating the text from Malayalam to
Tamil. The linguistics modules are very crucial
for any machine translation. A combination of
linguistic as well as statistical machine learning
techniques are used to build translation capability.
Various modules included in the MT system are
Malayalam morphological analyser which is a
paradigm based, parts of speech tagger and chun-
ker statistical based, lexical transfer comprising
the bilingual dictionary, morphological generator
for Tamil with some additional minute modules.
The architecture of the system is based on the
analyse-transfer-generate.

Figure 1: System Architecture

In the present study, the divergence issues are
solved at the analysis part only ie at the source
side. The analysis of the source language side
deals with different modules. At each level
various grammatical rules are incorporated to get
a much better result. The Figure 2 depicts the
increase in the accuracy when certain rules are
applied.
The test was carried out for 100 sentences from
various domains, When rules are not given the
accuracy obtained ranges from 47-55%. At the
same time when certain rules were included in
different modules for rectifying the errors , the

accuracy increased to 53-65%. The divergences at
the lexical are solved using bilingual dictionary.
The structural transformations are carried out at
the Transfer grammar module.

Figure 2: Accuracy Graph

The structural transformations are carried out at
the Transfer grammar module. The Lexical di-
vergences are solved using bilingual dictionary.
Many rules are incorporated at various modules
for rectifying the errors occurring during the trans-
lation process.

6 Conclusion

Identifying the patterns of divergence in any lan-
guages is very crucial to obtain a quality machine
translation system. The translational divergence
requires combinations of manipulations both at
the lexical and structural level. Some important
types of divergence related to translation based
on Dorr’s classification from Malayalam to Tamil
are discussed in this paper. Both manual and ma-
chine translation among this language pair is taken
in view. The divergence found can be semantic
or syntactic types. Various patterns of translation
divergence found at different phases of machine
translation is examined.
