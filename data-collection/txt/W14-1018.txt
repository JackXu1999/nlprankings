Abstract 

The main Lingenio MT products are based on rule-based architectures. In the presentation we show 
how knowledge from corpora is integrated into the systems using the language analysis- and 
translation-components in a bootstrapping approach. This relates to the bilingual dictionaries, but 
also to learning decisions concerning the selection of syntactic rules and semantic readings in 
parsing and semantic evaluation. These strategies contribute both to improve the quality of the 
systems and to shorten go-to-market of new products significantly. Also a number of attractive spin-
off functions can be generated from them which, in addition, can be used for designing new types 
of products and as preparatory and postediting features in MT systems whose core is of type SMT.
