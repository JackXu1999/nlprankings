Abstract 

The present paper investigates the phenomenon of antonym canonicity by providing new behavioural 
and distributional evidence on Italian adjectives. Previous studies have showed that some pairs of 
antonyms are perceived to be better examples of opposition than others, and are so considered 
representative of the whole category (e.g., Deese, 1964; Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). Our goal is 
to further investigate why such canonical pairs (Murphy, 2003) exist and how they come to be 
associated. In the literature, two different approaches have dealt with this issue. The lexical-categorical 
approach (Charles and Miller, 1989; Justeson and Katz, 1991) finds the cause of canonicity in the high 
co-occurrence frequency of the two adjectives. The cognitive-prototype approach (Paradis et al., 2009; 
Jones et al., 2012) instead claims that two adjectives form a canonical pair because they are aligned 
along a simple and salient dimension. Our empirical evidence, while supporting the latter view, shows 
that the paradigmatic distributional properties of adjectives can also contribute to explain the 
phenomenon of canonicity, providing a corpus-based correlate of the cognitive notion of salience.  

1 Introduction 
Antonymy is one of the most important semantic relations between words and/or word-senses (Lyons, 
1977; Cruse, 1986; Murphy, 2003; Jones et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2012; Paradis et al., 2009; Paradis et 
al., 2012; Van de Weijer et al., 2012) and a key organizational principle of the mental lexicon and of 
adjectives in particular. One important phenomenon about antonymy is that some adjectival pairs are 
perceived to be better examples of the relation than others, even when near-synonymic alternatives are 
available (Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2012). For example, if we ask what the 
antonym of hot is, the majority of speakers will answer cold, even if freezing and cool are near-
synonyms of cold and both express opposite concepts of hot. Thus, hot – cold is perceived as a better 
example of antonymy than hot – freezing or hot – cool. Antonymic pairs such as hot – cold are 
typically called canonical antonyms (Murphy, 2003) and the whole phenomenon – which is the central 
topic of the present paper – is known as antonym canonicity. 

As first showed by Deese (1964) and later confirmed by others psycholinguistics studies (Gross et 
al., 1989; Charles and Miller, 1989; Paradis et al., 2009), members of canonical pairs are the ones 
eliciting one another in free word association tasks and whose responses are shared by the majority of 
speakers. Additionally, canonical pairs are perceived to be in opposition even when no context is 
available and they are stable across word senses (Lehrer, 2002; Murphy, 2003). Murphy (2003) and 
Paradis et al. (2009) claim that a canonical pair arises when two words that are semantically in 
opposition become “conventionalized” as a pair in language, that is they are strongly associated and 
learnt as a form-sense unit. Thus, cognitive evidence suggests that conceptual opposition is not a 
sufficient condition for an antonymic pair to be a canonical pair. At this point two questions arise: why 
do canonical pairs exist at all? What are the conditions that determine antonym canonicity? 

Another question concerns the nature itself of canonicity. Gross et al. (1989) support a dichotomous

view, according to which a small group of canonical antonyms is strictly contrasted with a larger 
group of non-canonical ones. On the other hand, the fact that speakers are able to discriminate between 
“better” and “less good” instances of antonymy led some linguists to suggest that canonicity is a scalar 
phenomenon showing a prototypical structure, rather than a dichotomous one (Herrmann et al., 1986; 
Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). In this sense, antonymic pairings would be aligned along a 
continuum of “goodness of opposition” with a few pairs – canonical ones – as representative members 
of the relation. As also confirmed by the data reported in the following sections, it is possible to 
individuate different degrees of canonicity, depending on reciprocal elicitation frequency of the 
adjectives, a fact that we also use as the main criterion to define canonicity. 

The aim of this research is to bring new evidence on antonym canonicity and on its possible 
explanations. In particular, we show that pairs of adjectival antonyms with different degrees of 
canonicity exist in Italian as well, thereby complementing available data about English and Swedish 
and supporting the cross-linguistic validity of the phenomenon. In the next section, we discuss the two 
main models of canonicity. In the second part of the paper, we present the results of an elicitation 
experiment and distributional analysis of Italian canonical antonyms. 

2 Models of canonicity 
The existence of a group of antonymic pairs whose members elicit one another in free word 
association tasks was first reported by Deese (1964). He noticed that this kind of association seems to 
be consistent with most frequent English adjectives and proposed that two adjectives form a canonical 
pair because they share linguistic contexts (Deese, 1964; Deese, 1965). Two major models of 
canonicity have been proposed in the literature. Following the terminology used by Paradis et al. 
(2009), we refer to them as the lexical-categorical approach and the cognitive-prototype approach. 

The former approach was developed within the structuralist framework, which is based on the 
assumption that the relations are the semantic primitives, meanings therefore derive from the relations 
words have among them in the lexical network (e.g., Lyons, 1977). In this sense, antonyms form a set 
of “stored lexical association”, with an adjective having or not having a canonical antonym. This view 
is best exemplified by the way adjectives are organized in the Princeton WordNet model (Miller, 
1995). Antonymy is treated here as a lexical relation and a group of canonical pairs – the direct 
antonyms – is strictly contrasted with a group of non-canonical ones – the indirect antonyms –, 
thereby creating a strict dichotomy. In order to explain canonicity within the lexical-categorical model, 
Charles and Miller (1989) claim that Deese’s idea that direct (canonical) adjectives share linguistic 
contexts can be defined in two different ways: according to the substitutability hypothesis, two 
adjectives are learned as direct antonyms because they are interchangeable in most contexts, while 
according to the co-occurrence hypothesis, direct antonyms co-occur in sentences significantly more 
often than chance. Charles and Miller (1989) bring psychological evidence supporting the latter view, 
and Miller and Charles (1991) add that the substitutability hypothesis by itself would not allow to 
discriminate between antonyms and synonyms, since they both tend to co-occur in similar contexts. 
Additionally, Justeson and Katz (1991) individuate some syntactic patterns in which antonymic 
adjectives are often found to co-occur, such as between X and Y and X or Y. Moreover, Fellbaum 
(1995) argues that also nominal, verbal and cross-categorical antonyms (e.g., to begin (V) – endless 
(Adj)) co-occur in a sentence more often than chance, suggesting that antonyms do not have to be 
adjectives or to belong to the same syntactic category to express semantic opposition. Therefore, 
antonym canonicity would be explained by the syntagmatic nature of the relation, in accord with the 
co-occurrence hypothesis (Charles and Miller, 1989; Justeson and Katz, 1991). 

On the other hand, the cognitive-prototype approach – developed in the Cognitive Linguistic 
framework – argues that producing antonyms is not a matter of automatic lexical association but a 
knowledge-driven process (Murphy and Andrews, 1993; Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). 
Meanings are here considered to be conceptual in nature, therefore they do not form a stored network 
but are constantly negotiated by the speakers in the contexts where they occur, thanks to general 
cognitive processes (Paradis et al., 2009; Paradis et al., 2015). As suggested by Murphy and Andrews 
(1993) and later showed by Jones et al. (2007) and Van de Weijer et al. (2012), conceptual opposition 
turned out to be the cause of lexical relation, instead of the other way around. This evidence has led to 
treat antonymy as a context-sensitive semantic relation. In this respect, canonicity is a scalar 

167



phenomenon: Antonymic pairs are aligned along a continuum from “better” to “less good” examples 
of the relation – as first noted by Herrmann et al. (1986) –, but at the same time the category shows a 
prototype structure (Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009). Various studies have in fact pointed out the 
special status canonical antonyms enjoy, since the members of a canonical pair have both a relation of 
opposition and a strong lexical entrenchment in memory. The relation is therefore semantic and lexical 
(Jones et al., 2007; Paradis et al., 2009; Van de Weijer et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012). In diagnosing 
an adjectival pair as canonical, Paradis et al. (2009) suggest that what is crucial is the dimension of 
alignment, which has to be cognitive salient. This means that the antonymic pairs perceived as the best 
examples of the relation by the speakers would be the ones describing simple (i.e., easily identifiable) 
properties, in which the two members occupy the opposite poles, with equal distance from the 
midpoint. 

The behavioural data on Italian adjectives reported in the sections below confirm that antonym 
canonicity has indeed the gradient nature predicted by the cognitive-prototype model. Moreover, we 
show that canonicity has also an important distributional correlate, which however does not depend on 
their syntagmatic co-occurrence, as claimed by Miler & Charles (1989), but rather on their 
paradigmatic distributional similarity. 

3 Elicitation Experiment 
We have conducted an elicitation experiment to identify antonymic pairs with different degrees of 
canonicity in Italian. Each participant was asked to provide the best opposite for some Italian 
adjectives, divided in two different test sets. The antonymic pairs obtained in such way were classified 
accordingly to the frequency of reciprocal elicitation. Subject's production frequency has then been 
used to categorize the elicited data into canonical and non-canonical pairs: Two adjectives A and B are 
canonical if and only if A elicited B as the most frequent response and vice versa. 

The elicited pairs were later analysed with respect to their frequency of co-occurrence (in terms of 
Pointwise Mutual Information, as a measure of association strength). The aim was to evaluate the 
lexical-categorical approach, in particular to test whether the co-occurrence hypothesis provides a 
good explanation of canonicity. 

Even if the experiment was designed following the guidelines of Paradis et al. (2009), stimuli were 
selected on the basis of a different criterion, namely concreteness. Moreover, we also added adjectives 
that could generate morphologically derived antonyms. Furthermore, according to the view of 
canonicity as a scalar phenomenon (Herrmann et al., 1986; Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 2009), we 
expect that the number of response for each adjective will be extremely variable. 

3.1 Stimuli 

Two different datasets were used in the elicitation experiment and tested separately. The first set – Set1 
– was formed by 70 Italian adjectives selected manually on the basis of their concreteness: 35 were 
concrete adjectives – describing a concrete property (e.g., aperto “open”) – while 35 were abstract 
ones (e.g., felice “happy”). Unmarked members of canonical pairs from Paradis et al. (2009) and Jones 
et al. (2007) were included in this test set, conveniently translated. The second test set – Set2 – was 
formed by all the adjectives elicited by Set1, removing duplicates and items already included in Set1. 
Set2 has therefore been used to investigate which adjectives mutually elicit each other. Set2 consists of 
132 stimulus words. Nonce words were included in both Set1 and Set2 and subjects were instructed to 
identify them. This was necessary in order to ensure that all participants were native Italian speakers. 

3.2 Task 

The task was performed on the online crowdsourcing platform Crowdflower.com1. Each participant 
was asked to provide the best opposite for 10 randomized adjectives from one of the two test sets. For 
each item a specific blank space was provided. Responses were automatically collected by the 
platform. Twenty answers were collected for each stimulus word. An example was given in the 
instructions, along with the recommendation to write one single word for each stimulus and mark 
nonce words. The participants were all Italian native speakers.

3.3 Results 

As a pre-processing step, orthographic and typing errors were corrected and non-pertinent responses 
were cancelled (e.g., synonyms). Nouns, verbs and adverbs were eliminated or transformed into 
adjectives. 

Data were then analysed taking into account the number of distinct responses provided from the 
participants for each stimulus adjective. As expected, the results confirm the previous findings stating 
the existence of a continuum of lexical association (Herrmann et al., 1986; Paradis et al., 2009). The 
mean value of distinct responses per adjective is 2.85, but the number varies from a minimum of 1 to a 
maximum of 10 distinct responses (see Table 1). The standard deviation value, 2.96, indicates that the 
majority of stimulus elicited just one or two antonyms. Moreover, Set1 was more consistent than Set2. 
Set1 responses mean value is 2.14 (sd 1.54), while Set2 responses mean value is 3.23 (sd 2.53).  

Type-Token Ratio and Entropy were calculated in order to evaluate the amount of dispersion in 
responses. An entropy value equal to 0 was observed for 75 stimulus adjectives, suggesting they all 
elicited one and the same antonym (e.g., veloce “fast”, buono “good”, vivo “alive”, facile “easy”). The 
highest entropy values were instead observed for abstract adjectives and for a group of Set2 stimuli 
(e.g., sciocco “fool”, 0.92; austero “austere”, 0.9; serio “serious”, 0.85; libero “free”, 0.75). 
 

Category Response mean Std. deviation Entropy mean

Set1 2.14 1.54 0.15 
Set2 3.23 2.53 0.25 

 
Table 1. Response and entropy mean for the two datasets. 

 
We investigated to what extent adjective frequency estimated in a corpus2 and concreteness 

influence the amount of dispersion in responses – in terms of entropy values. The first parameter does 
not seem to be correlated with entropy values (Pearson's correlation value, r= -0.211), indicating that 
the number of responses obtained is independent from the frequency the adjective is used in texts. On 
the other hand, there is a significant difference between entropy values of concrete and abstract 
adjectives, the abstract ones eliciting more different antonyms (Wilcoxon: p-value < 0.001, W=6670). 

Stimuli were then paired with each antonym and we recorded the reciprocity of their elicitation, 
taking into account how many times the two members of each pair elicited one another (i.e., the 
frequency of reciprocal elicitation across participants). Among the 446 pairs emerged, 250 were not 
analysed because one of the members was not included in the stimuli. Remaining pairs were classified 
on the basis of their frequency of reciprocal elicitation into three groups: non-reciprocal, reciprocal 
and canonical. We observed 66 non-reciprocal pairs and 130 reciprocal ones. The canonical antonyms 
are a subset of the reciprocal pairs, for which the first member elicited as most frequent response the 
second one and vice versa. These consist of 65 pairs (see Appendix A). 

Furthermore, different patterns of adjective reciprocity were individuated. Participants strongly 
agreed on 24 pairs, which were perceived as perfectly binary. Two different antonyms were provided 
for 16 adjectives in a one-to-two match. In the majority of these cases the two options were 
respectively an opaque and a morphologically derived antonym (e.g., attivo – passivo/inattivo “active 
– passive/inactive”, felice – triste/infelice “happy – sad/unhappy”, vestito – nudo/svestito “dressed – 
naked/undressed”, perfetto – difettoso/imperfetto “perfect – defective/imperfect”). The other two 
reciprocity patterns were one-to-many and many-to-many. We observed the former in five cases (i.e., 
concreto “concrete”, comico “comical”, fragile “fragile”, libero “free”, intelligente “smart”), in which 
a single adjective elicited up to 8 possible antonyms and the relation held also in the opposite 
direction. Four instances of the many-to-many patterns were observed (i.e., mobile “movable”, 
improvviso “sudden”, calmo/tranquillo “calm/quiet”, sbagliato “wrong”), where multiple and complex 
relations arose defining a highly complex semantic field of antonyms and synonyms. 
                                                

2The adjectives frequencies were recorded on the Italian online corpus PAISÀ. It is a fully annotated corpus of authentic 
contemporary Italian texts from the web. It contains about 250M tokens. It is freely available at this website: 
http://www.corpusitaliano.it/. 

169



In order to look more deeply into the canonicity phenomenon and its lexical or semantic nature, we 
recorded on the Italian online corpus PAISÀ the co-occurrence frequency of each pair3 – and 
compared it with their expected frequency. The difference turned out to be always statistically 
significant (chi-squared test: p-value < 0.05), both for canonical and non-canonical pairs. 

Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) was also calculated and used as a measure of lexical 
association between the adjectives. We limited the analysis only to pairs with co-occurrence frequency 
≥ 5. These were 217 pairs: 63 canonical – 27 abstract and 36 concrete – and 154 non-canonical – 91 
abstract and 63 concrete. Moreover, pairs were marked according to frequency of production in both 
directions. Complete production data were observed for 138 pairs – all the 63 canonical pairs and 75 
non-canonical, 36 concrete and 39 abstract. 

There is a significant difference between the PMI of canonical and non-canonical pairs (t-test: p-
value < 0.001, t = 6.7144). This confirms the statement that canonical antonyms have a strong lexical 
association. Actually, the correlation values between PMI and subjects production frequency reveal an 
interesting pattern. For canonical antonyms, no significant Pearson's correlation was observed (r = 
0.107), suggesting that even the best examples of the relation could have a low PMI value. 
Conversely, the correlation between PMI and subject production frequency for non-canonical pairs is 
significantly higher (r = 0.419): The more the two members of a non-canonical pair are lexically 
associated the more they tend to elicit one another.  

Concreteness does not influence these values. Even if abstract adjectives elicit more possible 
antonyms, abstract and concrete pairs are not significant different with respect to PMI values (t-test: p-
value=0.1928, t=-1.3068). Both (non-)canonical abstract and (non-)canonical concrete pairs can be 
found and we can assume that concreteness is not a parameter of influence in canonicity. However, it 
is worth noting that the majority of abstract pairings – both canonical and non-canonical – are 
morphologically derived. 

To sum up, both canonical and non-canonical pairs co-occur significantly more often than chance, 
against the prediction of the lexical-categorical approach. On the other hand, it is true that canonical 
adjectives have higher association strength as measured by PMI, even if this value does not correlate 
with subject production frequency. That is, there are frequently produced canonical pairs, which have 
low values of association strength. Conversely, PMI appear to correlate (albeit moderately) with the 
subject production frequency of non-canonical pairs. We can surmise that the fact they are strongly 
associated allow speakers to recognize them as antonyms, increasing their production frequency. 

4 Distributional Analysis 
The results of the elicitation experiment did not fully support the lexical-categorical model of antonym 
canonicity, and are instead consistent with the gradient interpretation of canonicity advocated by the 
cognitive-prototype approach. However, the notion of “salient dimension”, which is central to the 
latter model, is not defined in a precise way. Moreover, when a pair such as hot – cold – whose 
dimension is clearly identifiable as TEMPERATURE in its basic literal interpretation – is used in a 
metaphorical sense, its dimension of alignment is not equally easy to identify. 

With the aim of providing a more solid empirical grounding to this notion, we propose a 
distributional interpretation of the concept of “salient dimension” as similarity of the nominal contexts 
co-occurring with adjectives. Therefore, we argue that the salience of the dimension expressed by 
canonical adjectives depends on the fact that they share a high number of similar nominal co-
occurrence contexts. As a matter of fact, if – as stated by Lehrer (2002) – a canonical pair can extend 
its opposition to a new semantic field when one of the members acquires a new sense, we would 
expect both members of the opposition to occur with the same nouns, thanks to the great amount of 
possible ontological domains they can apply in. Moreover, Paradis et al. (2015) demonstrate that 
members of canonical pairs are used in the same semantic contexts and structures not only when they 
co-occur but also when they are used individually. In the present case, we define nominal contexts of 
co-occurrence as the nouns each adjective modifies or is a predicate of. We have then represented 
adjectives with distributional vectors and used the cosine as a measure of context similarity. Since we 
assume that canonical pairs share a higher number of contexts than non-canonical ones, we predict that 
                                                

3Co-occurrence frequencies were estimated using a text window from 0 to >3, specifying both words had to be tagged as 
adjective, and restricting search within sentence boundaries.

the cosine values of canonical pairs are significantly higher than those for non-canonical pairs. 

4.1 Data 

The distributional analysis was performed on the 138 pairs with co-occurrence frequency ≥ 5 and 
mutually produced by the subjects. Eight pairs were removed because one of the members was not 
included in the distributional model used for this analysis (cf. below) or were erroneously lemmatized 
(i.e., as past participle forms). Therefore, the distributional analysis was performed on 130 pairs, 62 
canonical and 68 non-canonical. 

4.2 Procedure 

Noun-adjective co-occurrences were automatically extracted from La Repubblica corpus (Baroni et al., 
2004) with LexIt (Lenci, 2014)4. All the nouns each adjective in the test pairs modifies or is a predicate 
of were collected. Co-occurrences were weighted with Positive PMI (PPMI) and represented as a 
multidimensional vector for each adjective. The cosine was used to measure the distributional 
similarity of each test pair (Turney and Pantel, 2010). Therefore, the higher the cosine of an antonymic 
pair, the more its members tend to co-occur with the same nouns. 

4.3 Results 

The overall mean cosine is 0.11 (sd 0.07) (see Table 2). Considering the two groups separately a 
relevant difference can be noted. The mean cosine value for the canonical pairs is 0.21 (sd 0.2), while 
for non-canonical ones is 0.12 (sd 0.17). Moreover, maximum cosine for canonical pairs (0.44) is 
much larger than the maximum one for non-canonical pairs (0.27). 
 

Category Mean Std. Deviation Max. Value 
All Pairs 0.11 0.07 - 
Canonical (62) 0.21 0.20 0.44 
Non-canonical (68) 0.12 0.17 0.27 

 
Table 2. Mean cosine and maximum values. 

 
The difference between the cosines of canonical and non-canonical adjectives is highly significant 

(Wilcoxon test: p-value < 0.001, W=313). Once again, it turned out that concreteness is not a relevant 
factor. Nevertheless, it seems interesting to notice that canonical pairs with the lowest cosine values 
are the morphologically derived and abstract ones. What seems to be relevant is the correlation 
between cosine values and pair production frequency. The Pearson's correlation for canonical pairs (r 
= 0.29), though weak, is clearly larger than that for non-canonical ones (r = 0.07). In general, the 
distributional analysis shows that the goodness of opposition of a canonical pair of antonyms tends to 
be directly proportional to the distributional similarity of the adjectives with respect to the nominal 
contexts they co-occur with. 

5 Summary and Discussion 
The aim of the present paper was to identify antonymic pairs with different degrees of canonicity in 
Italian. We have defined as canonical those adjectives with the highest mutual production frequency in 
an elicitation task. We also intended to verify if – as suggested by Herrmann et al. (1986), Murphy 
(2003) and Paradis et al. (2009) – canonicity is a scalar phenomenon, that is if pairs are distributed on 
a scale – a continuum of “goodness of opposition” – from better to less good examples of the relation. 
The second goal of our research was to further investigate the canonicity phenomenon in order to 
explain the different behaviour of canonical and non-canonical antonyms. In particular, we tested the 
two previous approaches in the literature – lexical-categorical and cognitive-prototype – to determine

which are the parameters that cause the strong association between the two members of a canonical 
pair. An elicitation experiment and a distributional analysis were carried out. 

The elicitation experiment confirmed the existence of a continuum of “goodness of opposition”, as 
already stated by the cognitive-prototype approach and contrary to the dichotomous view of the 
relation offered by the lexical-categorical approach. We observed pairs with strong agreement among 
the participants – only one or two distinct antonyms were elicited for a given stimulus – as well as 
adjectives that produced up to 10 distinct responses. Moreover, classifying pairs as canonical and non-
canonical on the basis of the frequency of production allowed us to individuate different patterns of 
reciprocity, corresponding to different degrees of canonicity. Thus, as already stated by Jones et al. 
(2007), we can state that canonicity – and the whole antonymy relation in general – is not strictly 
binary in the sense that it does not require exclusivity. On the other hand, a small group of pairs 
obtained full agreement among the speakers, since members produced one another as unique response 
in the elicitation experiment. These pairs have a strong lexical association and entrenchment in 
memory, and confirm the prototypical internal structure of antonymy (Murphy, 2003; Paradis et al., 
2009). Interestingly, these results also suggest the cross-linguistic validity not only of the scalar and 
prototypical structure of antonymy, but also of what adjectives are considered the best examples of the 
relation. Italian data, in fact, reveal a picture highly similar to the previous studies on Swedish and 
English and the best examples of the relation are the same in the three languages. 

For what concern how canonical antonyms come to be associated, the elicitation experiment offered 
the possibility to evaluate the lexical-categorical approach. As noticed, observed co-occurrence 
frequency was always larger than expected both for canonical and non-canonical pairs. This means 
that both canonical and non-canonical pairs co-occur significantly more often than chance. Hence, the 
co-occurrence hypothesis alone is not sufficient to explain the existence of the canonicity phenomenon 
because it does not allow to discriminate between canonical and non-canonical antonyms. We found 
instead a correlation between PMI values and production frequency for the non-canonical pairs. This 
means that association strength, as measured by PMI, is a good indicator of the tendency of non-
canonical antonyms to elicit one another, suggesting that the more they are observed and used together 
in text the more they are perceived as “good” antonyms. 

Even if production statistics support the cognitive-prototype approach, the notion of “salience of 
dimension” used by such explanation lacks clear empirical criteria. As already mentioned, when a pair 
is used in a metaphorical sense the dimension of alignment is not so easy to identify. This seems to be 
confirmed by the behaviour of abstract and morphologically derived pairs, whose behaviour deserve 
further investigation. Therefore, we have proposed a distributional interpretation of the notion of 
salient dimension. We carried out a distributional analysis of the nouns co-occurring with the 
adjectives (in modification and predication contexts), assuming that the opposition between the two 
members of a canonical pair is stable across their senses. Thus, our hypothesis is the more the 
antonyms occur in the same nominal contexts, the more they are perceived as canonical. Vector cosine 
was used as a measure of the distributional similarity of adjectives in nominal contexts. As predicted, 
we found a significant difference between the cosine values of canonical and non-canonical pairs. This 
means that the members of a canonical pair tend to modify or be predicate of the same nouns. 

In summary, our experimental evidence suggests that, contra Charles and Miller (1989, strong 
paradigmatic distributional similarity, rather than syntagmatic co-occurrence, is the distinctive feature 
of canonicity. Two adjectives form a canonical pair because they are used to describe the same things 
and the same situations, but from two opposite points of view. What can be tall can be also short, as 
what is hot can be also cold. This allows the opposition to be moved into a new semantic field when 
one of the members of a canonical pair acquires a new sense (Lehrer, 2002). Hence, high frequency of 
co-occurrence – in similar syntactic structures – has to be considered as an effect of this kind of 
relation. As correctly argued by Miller and Charles (1991), paradigmatic substitutability can not be 
used to characterize antonymy in general, since this feature is also shared by other semantic relations, 
most notably synonymy. However, paradigmatic substitutability can instead be used as an empirical 
criterion to define the subset of canonical adjectives. It is in fact likely that paradigmatic 
substitutability is also one of the factors determining the high cognitive salience of the property 
expressed by canonical adjectives.
