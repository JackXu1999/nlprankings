Abstract
How do journalists mark quoted content
as certain or uncertain, and how do read-
ers interpret these signals? Predicates such
as thinks, claims, and admits offer a range
of options for framing quoted content ac-
cording to the author’s own perceptions of
its credibility. We gather a new dataset
of direct and indirect quotes from Twit-
ter, and obtain annotations of the perceived
certainty of the quoted statements. We
then compare the ability of linguistic and
extra-linguistic features to predict readers’
assessment of the certainty of quoted con-
tent. We see that readers are indeed influ-
enced by such framing devices — and we
find no evidence that they consider other
factors, such as the source, journalist, or
the content itself. In addition, we examine
the impact of specific framing devices on
perceptions of credibility.

1 Introduction

Contemporary journalism is increasingly con-
ducted through social media services like Twit-
ter (Lotan et al., 2011; Hermida et al., 2012). As
events unfold, journalists and political commen-
tators use quotes — often indirect — to convey
potentially uncertain information and claims from
their sources and informants, e.g.,

Figure 1: Indirect quotations in Twitter

A key pragmatic goal of such messages is to
convey the provenance and uncertainty of the

quoted content. In some cases, the author may also
introduce their own perspective (Lin et al., 2006)
through the use of framing (Greene and Resnik,
2009). For instance, consider the use of the word
claims in Figure 1, which conveys the author’s
doubt about the indirectly quoted content.

Detecting and reasoning about the certainty of
propositional content has been identified as a key
task for information extraction, and is now sup-
ported by the FactBank corpus of annotations for
newstext (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2009). However,
less is known about this phenomenon in social
media — a domain whose endemic uncertainty
makes proper treatment of factuality even more
crucial (Morris et al., 2012). Successful automa-
tion of factuality judgments could help to detect
online rumors (Qazvinian et al., 2011), and might
enable new applications, such as the computation
of reliability ratings for ongoing stories.

This paper investigates how linguistic resources
and extra-linguistic factors affect perceptions of
the certainty of quoted information in Twitter. We
present a new dataset of Twitter messages that use
FactBank predicates (e.g., claim, say, insist) to
scope the claims of named entity sources. This
dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk work-
ers who gave ratings for the factuality of the
scoped claims in each Twitter message. This en-
ables us to build a predictive model of the fac-
tuality annotations, with the goal of determining
the full set of relevant factors, including the pred-
icate, the source, the journalist, and the content
of the claim itself. However, we find that these
extra-linguistic factors do not predict readers’ fac-
tuality judgments, suggesting that the journalist’s
own framing plays a decisive role in the cred-
ibility of the information being conveyed. We
explore the specific linguistic feature that affect
factuality judgments, and compare our findings
with previously-proposed groupings of factuality-
related predicates.

2 Text data

We gathered a dataset of Twitter messages from
103 professional journalists and bloggers who
work in the field of American Politics.1 Tweets
were gathered using Twitter’s streaming API, ex-
tracting the complete permissible timeline up to
February 23, 2014. A total of 959,754 tweets were
gathered, and most were written in early 2014.

Our interest in this text is specifically in quoted
content — including “indirect” quotes, which may
include paraphrased quotations, as in the examples
in Figure 1. While labeled datasets for such quotes
have been created (O’Keefe et al., 2012; Pareti,
2012), these are not freely available at present. In
any case, the relevance of these datasets to Twitter
text is currently unproven. Therefore, rather than
train a supervised model to detect quotations, we
apply a simple dependency-based heuristic.

• We focus on tweets that contain any member of
a list of source-introducing predicates (we bor-
row the terminology of Pareti (2012) and call
this the CUE). Our complete list — shown in
Table 1 — was selected mainly from the exam-
ples presented by Saurı́ and Pustejovsky (2012),
1We used the website http://muckrack.com.

Report say, report, tell, told, observe, state,
accord, insist, assert, claim, main-
tain, explain, deny

Knowledge learn, admit, discover, forget, forgot
Belief think, thought, predict, suggest,

guess, believe
Doubt doubt, wonder, ask, hope
Perception sense, hear, feel

(cues) and groups (Saurı́, 2008).

but with reference also to Saurı́’s (2008) dis-
sertation for cues that are common in Twitter.
The Porter Stemmer is applied to match inflec-
tions, e.g. denies/denied; for irregular cases
not handled by the Porter Stemmer (e.g., for-
get/forgot), we include both forms. We use the
CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger (Owoputi
et al., 2013) to select only instances in the verb
sense. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the
cues and Figure 3 shows the distribution of the
cue groups. For cues that appear in multiple
groups, we chose the most common group.
• We run the Stanford Dependency parser to

obtain labeled dependencies (De Marneffe et
al., 2006), requiring that the cue has outgoing
edges of the type NSUBJ (noun subject) and
CCOMP (clausal complement). The subtree
headed by the modifier of the CCOMP relation
is considered the claim; the subtree headed by
the modifier of the NSUBJ relation is consid-
ered the source. See Figure 4 for an example.
• We use a combination of regular expressions

and dependency rules to capture expressions
of the type “CLAIM, according to SOURCE.”
Specifically, the PCOMP path from according
is searched for the pattern according to *.
The text that matches the * is the source and the
remaining text other than the source is taken as
the claim.
• Finally, we restrict consideration to tweets in

which the source contains a named entity or
twitter username. This eliminates expressions
of personal belief such as I doubt Obama will
win, as well as anonymous sources such as
Team sources report that Lebron has demanded
a trade to New York. Investigating the factual-
ity judgments formed in response to such tweets
is clearly an important problem for future re-
search, but is outside the scope of this paper.

This heuristic pipeline may miss many relevant
tweets, but since the overall volume is high, we

3 Annotation

We used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to col-
lect ratings of claims. AMT has been widely used
by the NLP community to collect data (Snow et
al., 2008), with “best practices” defined to help
requesters best design Turk jobs (Callison-Burch
and Dredze, 2010). We followed these guidelines
to perform pilot experiments to test the instruction
set and the quality of responses. Based on the pi-
lot study we designed Human Intelligence Tasks
(HITs) to annotate 1265 claims.

Each HIT contained a batch of ten tweets and
rewarded $0.10 per hit. To ensure quality con-
trol we required the Turkers to have at least 85%
hit approval rating and to reside in the United
States, because the Twitter messages in our dataset
were related to American politics. For each tweet,

we obtained five independent ratings from Turk-
ers satisfying the above qualifications. The rat-
ings were based on a 5-point Likert scale rang-
ing from “[-2] Certainly False” to “[2] Certainly
True” and allowing for “[0] Uncertain”. We also
allowed for “Not Applicable” option to capture
ratings where the Turkers did not have sufficient
knowledge about the statement or if the statement
was not really a claim. Figure 6 shows the set of
instructions provided to the Turkers, and Figure 5
illustrates the annotation interface.2

We excluded tweets for which three or more
Turkers gave a rating of “Not Applicable,” leaving
us with a dataset of 1170 tweets. Within this set,
the average variance per tweet (excluding “Not
Applicable” ratings) was 0.585.

4 Modeling factuality judgments

Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we
now model the factors that drive these ratings.

4.1 Predictive accuracy

First, we attempt to determine the impact of vari-
ous predictive features on rater judgments of fac-
tuality. We consider the following features:
• Cue word: after stemming
• Cue word group: as given in Table 1
• Source: represented by the named entity or

username in the source field (see Figure 4)
• Journalist: represented by their Twitter ID
• Claim: represented by a bag-of-words vector

from the claim field (Figure 4)
These features are used as predictors in a series

of linear ridge regressions, where the dependent
variable is the mean certainty rating. We throw
out tweets that were rated as “not applicable” by a
majority of raters, but otherwise ignore “not appli-
cable” ratings of the remaining tweets. The goal
of these regressions is to determine which fea-
tures are predictive of raters’ factuality judgments.
The ridge regression regularization parameter was
tuned via cross-validation in the training set. We
used the bootstrap to obtain multiple training/test

splits (70% training), which were used for signifi-
cance testing.

Table 3 reports mean average error for each fea-
ture group, as well as a baseline that simply re-
ports the mean rating across the training set. Each
accuracy was compared with the baseline using a
paired z-test. Only the cue word features pass this
test at p < .05. The other features do not help,
even in combination with the cue word.

While these findings must be interpreted with
caution, they suggest that readers — at least, Me-
chanical Turk workers — use relatively little inde-
pendent judgment to assess the validity of quoted
text that they encounter on Twitter. Of course,
richer linguistic models, more advanced machine
learning, or experiments with more carefully-
selected readers might offer a different view. But
the results at hand are most compatible with the
conclusion that readers base their assessments of
factuality only on the framing provided by the
journalist who reports the quote.

4.2 Cue words and cue groups

Given the importance of cue words as a sig-
nal for factuality, we want to assess the factual-
ity judgments induced by each cue. A second
question is whether proposed groupings of cue
words into groups cohere with such perceptions.
Saurı́ (2008) describes several classes of source-

introducing predicates, which indicate how the
source relates to the quoted claim. These classes
are summarized in Table 1, along with frequently-
occuring cues from our corpus. We rely on Fact-
Bank to assign the cue words to classes; the only
word not covered by FactBank was sense, which
we placed in predicates of perception.

We performed another set of linear regressions,
again using the mean certainty rating as the de-
pendent variable. In this case, there was no train-
ing/test split, so confidence intervals on the result-
ing parameters are computed using the analytic
closed form. We performed two such regressions:
first using only the individual cues as predictors,
and then using only the cue groups. Results are
shown in Figures 7 and 8; Figure 7 includes only
cues which appear at least ten times, although all
cues were included in the regression.

The cues that give the highest factuality coef-
ficients are learn and admit, which are labeled as
predicates of knowledge. These cues carry a sub-
stantial amount of framing, as they purport to de-
scribe the private mental state of the source. The
word admit often applies to statements that are
perceived as damaging to the source, such as Bill
Gates admits Control-Alt-Delete was a mistake;
since there can be no self-interest behind such
statements, they may be perceived as more likely
to be true.

Several of the cues with the lowest factuality co-
efficients are predicates of belief: suggest, predict
and think. The words suggest, think, and believe
also purport to describe the private mental state of
the source, but their framing function is the op-
posite of the predicates of knowledge: they im-
ply that it is important to mark the claim as the
source’s belief, and not a widely-accepted fact.
For example, Mubarak clearly believes he has the
military leadership’s support.

A third group of interest are the predicates of
report, which have widely-varying certainty coef-
ficients. The cues according, report, say, and tell

are strongly predictive of certainty, but the cues
claim and deny convey uncertainty. Both accord-
ing and report are often used in conjunction with
impersonal and institutional sources, e.g., Cuc-
cinelli trails McAuliffe by 24 points , according to
a new poll. In contrast, insist, claim, and deny im-
ply that there is uncertainty about the quoted state-
ment, e.g., Christie insists that Fort Lee Mayor
was never on my radar. In this case, the fact that
the predicate indicates a report is not enough to
determine the framing: different sorts of reports
carry radically different perceptions of factuality.

5 Related work

Factuality and Veridicality The creation of
FactBank (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2009) has en-
abled recent work on the factuality (or “veridical-
ity”) of event mentions in text. Saurı́ and Puste-
jovsky (2012) propose a two-dimensional factual-
ity annotation scheme, including polarity and cer-
tainty; they then build a classifier to predict an-
notations of factuality from statements in Fact-
Bank. Their work on source-introducing predi-
cates provides part of the foundation for this re-

search, which focuses on quoted statements in so-
cial media text. de Marneffe et al. (2012) conduct
an empirical evaluation of FactBank ratings from
Mechanical Turk workers, finding a high degree of
disagreement between raters. They also construct
a statistical model to predict these ratings. We are
unaware of prior work comparing the contribution
of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,
source and journalist features) for factuality rat-
ings. This prior work also does not measure the
impact of individual cues and cue classes on as-
sessment of factuality.

Credibility in social media Recent work in the
area of computational social science focuses on
understanding credibility cues on Twitter. Such
studies have found that users express concern over
the credibility of tweets belonging to certain topics
(politics, news, emergency). By manipulating sev-
eral features of a tweet, Morris et al. (2012) found
that in addition to content, users often use addi-
tional markers while assessing the tweet credibil-
ity, such as the user name of the source. The search
for reliable signals of information credibility in so-
cial media has led to the construction of automatic
classifiers to identify credible tweets (Castillo et
al., 2011). However, this prior work has not ex-
plored the linguistic basis of factuality judgments,
which we show to depend on framing devices such
as cue words.

6 Conclusion

Perceptions of the factuality of quoted content are
influenced by the cue words used to introduce
them, while extra-linguistic factors, such as the
source and the author, did not appear to be rele-
vant in our experiments. This result is obtained
from real tweets written by journalists; a natural
counterpart study would be to experimentally ma-
nipulate this framing to see if the same perceptions
apply. Another future direction would be to test
whether the deployment of cue words as framing
devices reflects the ideology of the journalist. We
are also interested to group multiple instances of
the same quote (Leskovec et al., 2009), and exam-
ine how its framing varies across different news
outlets and over time.
