Abstract

The results obtained by the BUAP team at
Task 1 of SemEval 2014 are presented in this
paper. The run submitted is a supervised ver-
sion based on two classification models: 1)
We used logistic regression for determining
the semantic relatedness between a pair of
sentences, and 2) We employed support vec-
tor machines for identifying textual entailment
degree between the two sentences. The be-
haviour for the second subtask (textual entail-
ment) obtained much better performance than
the one evaluated at the first subtask (related-
ness), ranking our approach in the 7th position
of 18 teams that participated at the competi-
tion.

1 Introduction

The Compositional Distributional Semantic Models
(CDSM) applied to sentences aim to approximate
the meaning of those sentences with vectors summa-
rizing their patterns of co-occurrence in corpora. In
the Task 1 of SemEval 2014, the organizers aimed
to evaluate the performance of this kind of models
through the following two tasks: semantic related-
ness and textual entailment. Semantic relatedness
captures the degree of semantic similarity, in this
case, between a pair of sentences, whereas textual
entailment allows to determine the entailment rela-
tion holding between two sentences.

This document is a description paper, therefore,
we focus the rest of it on the features and models we
used for carrying out the experiments. A complete
description of the task and the dataset used are given
in Marelli et al. (2014a) and in Marelli et al. (2014b),
respectively.

The remaining of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. In Section 2 we describe the general model
we used for comparing two sentences and the set of
the features used for constructing the vectorial rep-
resentation for each sentence. Section 3 shows how
we integrate the features calculated in a single vector
which fed a supervised classifier aiming to construct
a classication model that solves the two aforemen-
tioned problems: semantic relatedness and textual
entailment. In the same section we show the ob-
tained results. Finally, in Section 4 we present our
findings.

2 Description of the Distributional
Semantic Model Used

Given a sentence S = w1w2 · · ·w|S|, with wi a sen-
tence word, we have calculated different correlated
terms (ti,j) or a numeric vector (Vi) for each word
wi as follows:

1. {ti,j|relation(ti,j, wi)} such as “relation” is
one the following dependency relations: “ob-
ject”, “subject” or “property”.

2. {ti,j|ti,j = ck · · · ck+n} with n = 2, · · · , 5, and
ck ∈ wi; these tokens are also known as n-
grams of length n.

3. {ti,j|ti,j = ck · · · ck+((n−1)∗r)} with n =

145



2, · · · , 5, r = 2, · · · , 5, and ck ∈ wi; these to-
kens are also known as skip-grams of length
n.

4. Vi is obtained by applying the Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) algorithm implemented in the
R software environment for statistical comput-
ing and graphics. Vi is basically a vector of val-
ues that represent relation of the word wi with
it context, calculated by using a corpus con-
structed by us, by integrating information from
Europarl, Project-Gutenberg and Open Office
Thesaurus.

3 A Classification Model for Semantic
Relatedness and Textual Entailment
based on DSM

Once each sentence has been represented by means
of a vectorial representation of patterns, we con-
structed a single vector, −→u , for each pair of sen-
tences with the aim of capturing the semantic relat-
edness on the basis of a training corpus.

The entries of this representation vector are calcu-
lated by obtaining the semantic similarity between
each pair of sentences, using each of the DSM
shown in the previous section. In order to calcu-
late each entry, we have found the maximum similar-
ity between each word of the first sentence with re-
spect to the second sentence and, thereafter, we have
added all these values, thus, −→u = {f1, · · · , f9}.

Given a pair of sentences S1 =
w1,1w2,1 · · ·w|S1|,1 and S2 = w1,2w2,2 · · ·w|S2|,2,
such as each wi,k is represented according to the
correlated terms or numeric vectors established
at Section 2, the entry fi of −→u is calculated
as: fl =

∑|S1|
i=1 max{sim(wi,1, wj,2)}, with

j = 1, · · · , |S2|.
The specific similarity measure (sim()) and the

correlated term or numeric vector used for each fl is
described as follows:

1. f1 : wi,k is the “object” of wi (as defined
in 2), and sim() is the maximum similar-
ity obtained by using the following six Word-
Net similarity metrics offered by NLTK: Lea-
cock & Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow,
1998), Lesk (Lesk, 1986), Wu & Palmer (Wu
and Palmer, 1994), Resnik (Resnik, 1995), Lin

(Lin, 1998), and Jiang & Conrath1 (Jiang and
Conrath, 1997).

2. f2 : wi,k is the “subject” of wi, and sim() is
the maximum similarity obtained by using the
same six WordNet similarity metrics.

3. f3 : wi,k is the “property” of wi, and sim() is
the maximum similarity obtained by using the
same six WordNet similarity metrics.

4. f4 : wi,k is an n-gram containing wi, and sim()
is the cosine similarity measure.

5. f5 : wi,k is an skip-gram containing wi, and
sim() is the cosine similarity measure.

6. f6 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA,
and sim() is the Rada Mihalcea semantic sim-
ilarity measure (Mihalcea et al., 2006).

7. f7 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA,
and sim() is the cosine similarity measure.

8. f8 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA,
and sim() is the euclidean distance.

9. f9 : wi,k is numeric vector obtained with LSA,
and sim() is the Chebyshev distance.

All these 9 features were introduced to a logistic
regression classifier in order to obtain a classifica-
tion model which allows us to determine the value of
relatedness between a new pair of sentences2. Here,
we use as supervised class, the value of relatedness
given to each pair of sentences on the training cor-
pus.

The obtained results for the relatedness subtask
are given in Table 1. In columns 2, 3 and 5, a large
value signals a more efficient system, but a large
MSE (column 4) means a less efficient system. As
can be seen, our run obtained the rank 12 of 17, with
values slightly below the overall average.

3.1 Textual Entailment

In order to calculate the textual entailment judgment,
we have enriched the vectorial representation previ-
ously mentioned with synonyms, antonyms and cue-

words (“no”, “not”, “nobody” and “none”) for de-
tecting negation at the sentences3 . Thus, if some of
these new features exist on the training pair of sen-
tences, we add a boolean value of 1, otherwise we
set the feature to zero.

This new set of vectors is introduced to a support
vector machine classifier4, using as class the textual
entailment judgment given on the training corpus.

The obtained results for the textual entailment
subtask are given in Table 2. Our run obtained the
rank 7 of 18, with values above the overall average.
We consider that this improvement over the related-
ness task was a result of using other features that
are quite important for semantic relatedness, such
as lexical relations (synonyms and antonyms), and
the consideration of the negation phenomenon in the
sentences.

4 Conclusions

This paper describes the use of compositional distri-
butional semantic models for solving the problems

antonyms were collected from Wikipedia.

of semantic relatedness and textual entailment. We
proposed different features and measures for that
purpose. The obtained results show a competitive
approach that may be further improved by consider-
ing more lexical relations or other type of semantic
similarity measures.

In general, we obtained the 7th place in the official
ranking list from a total of 18 teams that participated
at the textual entailment subtask. The result at the
semantic relatedness subtask could be improved if
we were considered to add the new features taken
into consideration at the textual entailment subtask,
an idea that we will implement in the future.
