Abstract

Code-Mixing (CM) is the phenomenon
of alternating between two or more lan-
guages which is prevalent in bi- and
multi-lingual communities. Most NLP
applications today are still designed
with the assumption of a single inter-
action language and are most likely to
break given a CM utterance with mul-
tiple languages mixed at a morphologi-
cal, phrase or sentence level. For ex-
ample, popular commercial search en-
gines do not yet fully understand the
intents expressed in CM queries. As
a first step towards fostering research
which supports CM in NLP applica-
tions, we systematically crowd-sourced
and curated an evaluation dataset for
factoid question answering in three CM
languages - Hinglish (Hindi+English),
Tenglish (Telugu+English) and Tamlish
(Tamil+English) which belong to two lan-
guage families. We share the details of
our data collection process, techniques
which were used to avoid inducing lexi-
cal bias amongst the crowd workers and
other CM specific linguistic properties of
the dataset. Our final dataset, which is
available freely for research purposes, has
1,694 Hinglish, 2,848 Tamlish and 1,391
Tenglish factoid questions and their an-
swers. We discuss the techniques used by
the participants for the first edition of this
ongoing challenge.

1 Introduction

Code-Mixing (CM) is formally defined as the
embedding of linguistic units such as phrases,
words, and morphemes of one language into
an utterance of another language, which is
commonly observed in multilingual communi-
ties ((Myers-Scotton, 1997), (Poplack, 1980),

(Muysken, 2000)). Traditionally, some studies
(Yow and Patrycia, 2011) have viewed the mix-
ing of two independent codes as lack of fluency
of the segment of population in either of the lan-
guages. However, an alternate perspective (Mil-
roy and Muysken, 1995) argues that mixing of
two traditionally isolated linguistic codes poten-
tially creates a third legitimate code. Researchers
(Crystal, 1997) have also presented several socio-
cultural reasons and motivations for switching.
There have been studies to depict the usage of
particular language based on the emotional at-
tachment and the sentiment of the person towards
that topic (Rudra et al., 2016). In this paper,
we adopt the perspective of descriptive linguis-
tics and make an effort to describe this prevalent
form of language as it occurs, without adopting a
prescriptive approach.

Ubiquitous access to social media tools and
platforms have also made CM the preferred
choice for both formal and informal commu-
nication. In such settings, where the commu-
nication is either semi-formal or informal, re-
searchers ((Bali et al., 2014), (Barman et al.,
2014)) have observed a higher tendency for multi-
lingual speakers to use CM. We studied a sam-
ple of conversation logs from a commercial chit-
chat based conversational agent in the Indian mar-
ket. The agent was trained to engage in infor-
mal chat conversations with the help of a database
of Twitter conversations from the Indian mar-
ket. Since India is a multilingual country with
a large number of multilingual speakers, we no-
tice that users often freely use each language in-
dividually or their CM versions while convers-
ing with the agent. We notice that, in around
3% of overall conversations, users were found to
be chatting with the agent in CM language such
as ‘hello, kya chal raha hai’ (Meaning: hello,
what’s up?). Interestingly, in cases where the re-
sponse of the agent was in CM language such as
‘sorry yaar’ (Meaning: sorry friend), users too



30

responded back in CM language in 27% of those
times. There have been other studies regarding
the quantitative and qualitative aspects of code-
switching on social media along similar lines (Hi-
dayat, 2008). However, a large number of NLP
applications, such as Question Answering (QA),
Dialogue Systems, Summarization etc, still con-
tinue to be designed with the assumption of a
single interaction language such as English (Brill
et al., 2002), Hindi ((Kumar et al., 2005)), Chi-
nese ((Yongkui et al., 2003), (Sun et al., 2008)).
Such systems are most likely to break given a CM
utterance which has multiple languages mixed at
sentence, phrase or morphological level. Hence,
it is highly imperative for researchers to focus on
building more robust end-user NLP applications
which can understand and process CM language.

Building a good evaluation dataset for Factoid
QA in CM is wrought with challenges such as a)
ensuring that the annotators are unbiased in any-
way to artificially use CM b) recruiting a good
team of native bi-lingual speakers as annotators
c) maintaining a good quality and diversity of
questions across intents, answer types and enti-
ties. In this paper, we describe our experience
in dealing with the above challenges while cre-
ating the dataset. We used a crowd-sourcing plat-
form for collecting data where the crowd work-
ers were restricted to only native language (Hindi,
Telugu and Tamil) speakers. We shared a detailed
set of guidelines and instructions about the task
with the crowd workers and also ran them through
some basic quality checks before collection of ac-
tual data. Finally, we were able to collect around
1,694 Hinglish, 2,848 Tamlish and 1,391 Tenglish
factoid questions along with their answers. We
have organized a Code-Mixed Question Answer-
ing challenge based on this data for the first edi-
tion of this challenge. There are 7 teams that reg-
istered and took the data from us. In this paper,
we discuss the preliminary techniques that 2 of
these groups used. To summarize, the following
are the main contributions of this paper:
• We curated an evaluation dataset for the task
of Factoid QA in CM languages with more than
5000 QA pairs for Hinglish, Tamlish and Tenglish
languages. We also make it freely available for re-
search purposes.
• We share our experiences related to eliciting
lexically unbiased CM questions by using images
as anchor points.
• We present the techniques used in the first edi-
tion of the CM QA challenge.

2 Related Work

Early work in this domain include investigat-
ing CM phenomenon in a formal and compu-
tational framework (Joshi, 1982) and develop-
ing formalisms (Goyal et al., 2003), (Sinha and
Thakur, 2005). Recent years have seen atten-
tion towards part of speech tagging for CM lan-
guages and gathering corpora ((Vyas et al., 2014),
(Solorio and Liu, 2008), (Jamatia et al., 2015),
(Soto and Hirschberg, 2017)) for it. Language
identification in mixed language scenarios has
also been studied recently ((Barman et al., 2014),
(Chittaranjan et al., 2014)) and has also been
aggressively addressed as a shared task at ma-
jor conferences ((Solorio et al., 2014), (Sequiera
et al., 2015)). Some of the other applications
that were picked up in research in CM over the
past few years include Named Entity Recogni-
tion (Zirikly and Diab, 2015), semantic parsing
(Duong et al., 2017), dependency parsing (Par-
tanen et al., 2018) and shallow parsing (Sharma
et al., 2016). While the above work focusses on
important language processing challenges in CM,
we are more interested in end-user NLP applica-
tions which support CM such as Factoid QA in
CM languages.

Eliciting a corpus of CM questions by para-
phrasing an English question was used to perform
question classification (Raghavi et al., 2015).
While this method has the advantage of having
a ground truth parallel text, the possibility of lex-
ical bias from the English question while framing
the code-mixed question exists. An extension to
this work was proposed by building an end-to-end
web based CM question answering system named
WebShodh (Chandu et al., 2017). Efforts have
been made to develop cross lingual QA systems
that take questions in English and answer back
in English but search for candidate answers in
Hindi newspapers (Sekine and Grishman, 2003)
along with other machine learning approaches
(Nanda et al., 2016). There has been some work
in the early 2000s to generate a dialog based QA
system in Telugu to support Railway inquiries
(Reddy and Bandyopadhyay, 2006). This kind
of cross language QA system is being researched
for European languages as well (Neumann and
Sacaleanu, 2003). A dataset of 506 questions
from messages from Facebook was proposed in
the Bengali-English CM domain (Banerjee et al.,
2016). Our dataset is over ten times larger than
this data and takes into account the lexical varia-
tion brought in by collecting questions from im-
ages and code-mixed articles.

3 Dataset Collection
In order to study differences between lexical
bias from entrainment and elicit lexically diverse
questions, we employ two modes of data col-
lection: eliciting code-mixed questions from a)
images and b) code-mixed articles. The for-
mer are general questions and the latter are con-
text specific questions (similar to machine read-
ing). Techniques of collecting queries for a di-
alog system by presenting scenarios symbolically
and diagrammatically was previously used (Black
et al., 2011) in order to minimize supplying lex-
ical and phrasal cues. For collection of Hinglish
data, we used both these approaches whereas for
collecting Tenglish and Tamlish data, we used
only images. This is because for Hinglish, we
could find informative blogging websites based
on which it is easier to frame factoid code-mixed
questions. However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, during the time of our annotation, such fact
based code-mixed content was still not available
in Tenglish/Tamlish. It is also noted that it is less
likely to get questions that have abstract answers
(beyond the realm of physical entities) when they
are collected based on images.

3.1 Challenges in Code-Mixed Factoid
Questions Collection

We faced the following challenges during the
data collection task.
1. How would we eliminate the bias towards
using English in general scenarios while using
a search engine etc.,? In other words, we need
to encourage crowd workers to provide us with
data that is neither biased to English monolingual
questions due to preconceptions of the language
preference while interacting with a computer, nor
bias them to provide mixed language data if it
does not feel natural to them.
2. How do we eliminate responses from people
who are not native speakers? To mitigate this
problem, we have given the instructions to each
of these target languages in romanized code-
mixed version of the corresponding languages
mixed with English. This has the dual advantage
of being understood only by those who have
enough competence in the matrix language as
well as easing them into code-mixing and making
them comfortable with it.
3. How do we elicit factoid questions? This is
a trivial issue. We had to explain what a factoid
question is while providing sufficient examples
of factoid and non-factoid questions.
4. How do we collect questions that are general
enough that they could be answered without

providing the context of the images (for image
based questions)? The design of the task to col-
lect questions based on images, in order to study
the comparative lexical bias when a code-mixed
article is given, has resulted in a lot of questions
that are related to multi-modal reasoning. For
example, Tenglish question ‘image lo entha
mandi unnaaru?’ (Meaning: How many people
are there in the image?) requires a visual in order
to answer. We removed such questions in the post
processing after data collection.

We ensured a good mix of categories while se-
lecting the target fulcrum entity images (exam-
ple: guitar, bicycle), location (example: Eiffel
Tower, Golden Gate Bridge), person (example:
Roger Federer, Eminem), event (example: World
War 2, Dandi March). Out of these, we manually
selected 80 images from which factoid questions
can be asked. To gather questions based on arti-
cles, we first scraped documents from hinglishpe-
dia.com, randomly selected 80 articles from them
and made sure that all of them were code-mixed.
The crowd-workers are then requested to form
factoid questions based on these articles such that
the answers to the questions are present in the cor-
responding article.

3.2 Crowd-sourcing for Question & Answer
Collection

We engaged with two streams of demographics
while collecting the data: university students and
crowd-workers. Each participant is allowed to
provide us with only 20 questions to avoid idi-
olectic biases i.e, biases of each individual. In
the first step, we performed the activity in a more
controlled environment in university classrooms.
The instructors of the classrooms were requested
to give a brief presentation we made about what
code-mixing is along with some example ques-
tions. This was performed to alleviate the bias
against mixing while interacting with a machine.
The students (with native languages among Hindi,
Telugu and Tamil) were given clear explanations
about factoid and non-factoid questions in order
to elicit the right kind of questions for our task.

In the second phase, we migrated this setup
to Amazon Mechanical Turk task, where crowd-
workers were redirected to our interface1 of
mixed language instructions based on their native
language. Each accepted Human Intelligence Test

Table 1: Data Statistics: The code-mixing metrics for Hinglish (Hindi+English), Tamlish
(Tamil+English) and Tenglish (Telugu+English) questions

(HIT) was compensated with $2.50 on the Turk
setup. We have got a lot more responses for Tam-
lish questions as compared to both Hinglish and
Tenglish together as reflected in Table 1. In this
scenario, although the turkers have not been for-
mally explained about what code-mixing is apart
from providing them with instructions and exam-
ples, most of the data we received included mixed
language Romanized questions. While in the for-
mer scenario, the collected questions were ex-
plicitly moderated to remain within bilingual and
multilingual environments, like in India, the latter
scenario does not ensure this, as they do not have
to be present in India. The extent of code-mixing
and fluency of the questions may vary as com-
pared to the questions collected from Indian class-
room environment due to the difference in their
socio-cultural environments. Though we have
mentioned in the instructions to provide us with
questions that sound natural to the participants,
we acknowledge that it may not have been com-
pletely natural as they were explicitly requested to
mix two languages. The third phase involves col-
lecting answers to all the questions. Monolingual
questions and image-based questions that contain
referring expressions, such as ‘in this figure’ were
removed before collecting answers. To filter out
noisy and random answers, the set-up includes
a qualifying CM question for which we clearly
knew the answer. When collecting answers, we
only accept them from workers who correctly an-
swer the qualifying question.

3.3 Curation and Post-processing

After data collection, we removed duplicate en-
tries and also performed one step of human veri-
fication. This responsibility was divided into two
phases. The first step was employing certain post
processing steps in order to remove the questions
that did not match the presented specifications
and rejecting them. One major problem is the
use of referring expressions and determiners cor-
responding to the images about which the ques-
tions were asked. In each of the three languages,
we made a list of all possible spelling variants
of referring expressions like ‘image/picture mein’

(Meaning: in the image), ‘ye’ (Meaning: this),
’iss’ (Meaning: this) and separated the questions
that contain these expressions. The same pro-
cess was not done for questions collected based
on code-mixed articles. This is because referring
expressions corresponding to the given text do not
hinder searching for an answer in the given snip-
pet. Lexical level language identification is per-
formed to remove the questions that do not have
atleast one word from both the languages. These
selected questions after filtering are then curated
and gone through manually to add back the ques-
tions that made sense before rejecting the HITs.
The next level of curation was performed during
the answer collection phase. This was necessary
because it was still possible to bypass these cura-
tion conditions. For example, there were some en-
tries that seemed like English queries with an ad-
ditional suffix belonging to the corresponding na-
tive language at the end of some of the words. For
example, ‘Whatil isil waterfalla borderil America
and Canada?’ (Tamlish question for ‘What is the
waterfall in the border of America and Canada’).
On the other hand there are queries that seemed
to have been translated using an online translation
tool into the matrix language and randomly insert-
ing some English words in between. For example,
‘Mein which Indian state did Mother Teresa kaam
kiya?’ (Hinglish question). This example seems
to be a lexical level translation of first, eighth and
ninth words of the English question ‘In which In-
dian state did Mother Teresa work (past-tense)?’
into Hindi. 67.87% of the data collected from
Turk was acceptable and passed our curation tests.
Among the remaining, about 21% were rejected
due to the use of referring expressions, 11% due
to erroneous attempts by typing junk words. All
the questions passed the curation tests for more
than 90% of the accepted HITs and some of the
questions were acceptable for the remaining 10%.
This implies that the instructions provided for the
task were sufficiently clear to elicit CM factoid
questions. The above are the statistics for the data
corresponding to the crowd sourced platform that
might provide a baseline estimate for collecting
useful data for this domain on such platforms.



33

Since the number of curators is much less (ap-
proximately 6 people) than the number of crowd-
workers, we need to understand that the curation
process is much more expensive in terms of man-
ual effort. The above steps are taken to elicit qual-
ity data for our purposes. The tasks of collect-
ing questions and answers were deliberately sep-
arated for two reasons. One is to ensure clarity of
the task and make sure that the users are giving
naturally code-mixed questions and asking them
to provide answers in English within the same
task might lead to unnecessary biases or confu-
sion. The second reason is that when asked to pro-
vide questions and answers together, one might
tend to ask the simplest questions to which an-
swers are already known to them. This in turn
might have reduced the variety of questions for
the same anchor point. We have also collected
feedback about each question whether it is a fac-
toid and if additional multi-modal information is
needed to answer it, during the answer collection
phase.

4 Data Analysis

Recent studies have focused on empirical mea-
surements of code-switching (Guzmán et al.,
2017). The multilingual index(M-Index), Lan-
guage Entropy and Integration index(I-index)
measure the extent of mixing and switching fre-
quency. Table 1 presents the statistics of out
dataset along with these metrics for mixing. The
average number of words per question is higher in
Hinglish compared to Tamlish and Tenglish. The
M-index for all the 3 language pairs are in com-
parable ranges while it is slightly less for Tam-
lish. The questions are provided along with the
following information: (1) language information
(2) question type annotated as ‘context depen-
dent’ (for article based questions) and ‘context in-
dependent’ (for images based questions) and (3)
corresponding article for article based questions.

4.1 Answer Type Distribution
In order to analyze the distribution of question
types in our dataset, we sampled questions, from
Tenglish and Hinglish, which contain either of the
following two selected images - ‘Taj Mahal’ and
‘Hiroshima’. We use the coarse and fine-grained
type hierarchies proposed by (Li and Roth, 2006)
for annotating the questions. For the first im-
age: ‘Taj Mahal’, we had 91 Tenglish questions
and 71 Hinglish questions. For Tenglish ques-
tions, the distribution of coarse level types were
34 PERSON, 8 ENTITY, 30 LOCATION and 19
NUMERIC. For Hinglish questions, the coarse-

type distribution was found to be 25 PERSON,
9 ENTITY, 22 LOCATION and 15 NUMERIC.
An interesting observation we noticed was that -
there were 23 Tenglish and 17 Hinglish variants
of the question ‘Who built Taj Mahal?’ and simi-
larly there were 12 Tenglish and 8 Hinglish vari-
ants of the question ‘In which city is Taj Mahal
located?’. A similar analysis for the other focus
entity ‘Hiroshima’ gave us 21 Tenglish questions
distributed as 7 NUMERIC, 9 LOCATION, 4 EN-
TITY, 1 PERSON type questions and 14 Hinglish
questions distributed as 10 NUMERIC, 2 LOCA-
TION, 1 ENTITY and 1 PERSON type ques-
tions. Among these we observed 4 and 8 vari-
ants in Tenglish and Hinglish respectively for the
question ‘In which year did attack on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki take place?’. These statistics re-
veal that, for the same image shown to them, par-
ticipants issued questions resulting in a variety of
answer types in the target code-mixed languages.
Figure 1 shows the percentage distribution of the
question types for ‘Taj Mahal’ and ‘Hiroshima’
across the three language pairs.

In order to gain better intuitions on the ‘why
and how’ of code-mixing, the collected ques-
tions are studied with respect to idiolectic lan-
guage preferences, i.e the idiosyncrasies of mix-
ing the languages and the extent of code-mixing
across languages. To study the individual mix-
ing biases in the data, Multilingual Index is calcu-
lated for each individual in each of the language
pairs. Figure 2 shows histograms for idiolects of
Hinglish, Tenglish and Tamlish. As can be ob-
served from the figure, Hinglish and Tenglish has
many crowd-workers towards the higher end of
multilingual index whereas Tamlish has a rather
smoother distribution except for the last range.

4.2 Lexical Bias in Article based Questions

The bias of copying the words was mitigated to
an extent by the usage of images as anchor points
to collect questions. However, studying the lex-
ical bias when a code-mixed article is given acts
as a proxy to study entrainment. The variant of
expressing the questions from code-mixed arti-
cles serves two purposes. One is to study the dif-
ferences in difficulty of down stream task of re-
trieving for question answering as compared to
the image based questions. In this category of
questions, the answer is present in the snippets
that are given and the focus is primarily on re-
trieving the answers from within the given text.
The second is to study the varying lexical biases
to frame a question when code-mixed content is
given versus when it is not. To study this empiri-

Figure 2: Histograms for Multilingual index for idiolects for Hinglish, Tenglish and Tamlish

cally, we calculated the percentage of intersection
of words between question and articles. The av-
erage of overlapping words is 54.20%, while the
minimum and maximum are 12.5% and 92.31%
respectively. Similarly, the longest overlapping
subsequences have a mean of 2.24 with a mini-
mum of 1 word and a maximum of 16 words.

4.3 Mixing Phenomena observed in the Data
One of the interesting categories of mixing that
is observed in the data is mixing gender infor-
mation of the native and the mixed form of the
word. For example, consider the question from
the data, ‘earth kab form hui thi?’ (English mean-
ing: When was Earth formed?). A paraphrase of
the same question is ‘dharthi kab form hui thi?’.
In Hindi, the gender of the verb has to agree with
the subject. While the gender of Earth is mas-
culine (which should have agreed with ‘hua’ and
not ‘hui’), the gender of dharthi (which agrees
with ‘hui’) is feminine as perceived by a native
speaker. But as observed in the question, feminine
form ‘hui’ is used with ‘Earth’ which is mixed
word from English. Sebba (2009) refers to this as
one type of ’harmonization strategy’ in language
mixing and it is one that he says might be typi-
cal of highly literate bilinguals. We believe the
naturalness of the data is highly dependent on the
nativity of annotators. Throughout our process,
we took as much care to ensure that we use na-
tive speakers of the language for our annotation.
However, there were still a few exceptions. We

also tried avoiding completely random, spurious
and noisy inputs by checking if they were simply
permutations of the original input and their lexi-
cally translated words.

A known problem in dealing with code-mixed
text is non-standardized Romanization of native
language when mixed with English. Phonologi-
cal perceptions of a syllable can be represented
differently. For example, from the data a cou-
ple of the very frequent such variations are ‘kon’
and ‘kaun’ for ‘who’ in Hindi, and ‘he’ and ‘hai’
for ‘is’ in Hindi. For both these words, the lat-
ter variants are closer to the pronunciation of the
Hindi words, but the other sounds are in col-
loquial usage frequently as well. Consider the
question, ‘Friends serial ke kitne seasons ba-
naye ja chukein hain?’ (Meaning: How many
seasons were made for Friends serial?). Using
‘n’ in ‘chukein’ indicates that the person liter-
ally transliterated the Hindi spelling into Roman
spelling because colloquially the ‘n’ sound is of-
ten omitted while speaking. A similar obser-
vation applies to the word ‘kartein’ (Meaning:
do). Similarly, ‘pe’ is a more colloquial usage
of the word ‘par’ (Meaning: on). Though ‘pe’
is never used in standard written Hindi, the data
collected has both variants of the words. Sim-
ilar observations in Tenglish data include vari-
ations for ‘cheyinchaadu’ and ‘ceyincadu’ (both
the words mean ‘did’). This problem compounds
in Tenglish since Telugu is an agglutinative lan-



35

guage. For example, in the variants ‘chesthu un-
aadu’ and ‘chesthunnadu’ (meaning: have been
doing (masculine form)), the two words can be
written together as a single word or separately.

Some of the examples show forcible mixing
since the instructions specifically mentioned to
provide code-mixed questions. For example, ‘An-
droid ko Google ne kab buy kiya tha?’ (Mean-
ing: ‘When did Google buy Android?’). The
word ‘khareed’ which means ‘buy’ is a very com-
mon Hindi word and in such cases, the native
word is used more naturally as opposed to the
mixed word. 10 such examples were selected
from Hinglish and shown to 5 native speakers of
Hindi to annotate if they seem natural, unnatural
or neutral. All these examples were marked as ei-
ther unnatural (36%) or neutral (64%) and none
of them were marked as natural. This shows that
there is some pattern or notion of mixing words
for native speakers.

In some other examples, we also observed what
can be considered an opposite of forced mix-
ing. For example, in question ‘1994 mein pre-
mier kiya hua pramukh American comedy TV
saathiyon ka naam kya hai?’ (Meaning: What
is the name of the famous American comedy
TV show Friends that was premiered in 1994?),
words like ‘pramukh’ (Meaning: famous) and
‘saathiyon’ (Meaning: friends) are less common
in common usage compared to their English mix-
ing counterparts. Also, note that this is uncom-
mon since the named entity ‘Friends’ is translated
to the Hindi counterpart. Another known phe-
nomenon is the mixing of languages at morpho-
logical level which was observed very commonly
in the data. This poses a problem for word level
modeling or formulation for addressing the down
stream tasks such as our current case of question
answering. For example, in the Tenglish ques-
tion ‘Eiffel Tower ni entha mandi architectlu de-
sign chesaru?’ (Meaning: How many architects
designed Eiffel Tower?), the word ‘architectlu’
(Meaning: architects) is mixed at morphological
level by English word ‘architect’ and Telugu suf-
fix ‘lu’, which is a plural marker.

5 CM QA Challenge: Techniques

The CM QA challenge was announced and broad-
casted during the summer of 2017. The task is
to provide a ranked list of relevant answers for
given CM queries. The image based questions
are annotated as ‘general’ and the article based
questions are provided with the corresponding ar-
ticles. While 7 teams have registered to take part
in the challenge and have collected data from the

organizers, a couple of teams have successfully
completed participating in the challenge. In this
section, we discuss the techniques used by two
participating groups to address the first edition of
this challenge.

As discussed in Section 3, there are 2 cate-
gories of questions; (1) general questions where
there is no context, and (2) article based questions
for which the answers are retrieved from a given
context. To address the latter type, paragraphs
from Wikipedia are leveraged as general context.
One team (from Deutsche Forschungszentrum für
Künstliche Intelligenz (DFKI)) addressed this by
identifying the named entities in the CM query
and look them up in the summaries of Wikipedia
articles 2. These summaries typically contain
5 sentences. The second team (from IIIT Hy-
derabad) trained a similarity model using DSSM
(Huang et al., 2013) to retrieve and rank the an-
swer bearing sentences from Wikipedia. Both the
groups have worked along similar lines to address
questions with general context.

The team from DFKI dealt with article based
questions as well. At this stage, both the cat-
egories of questions contain query and informa-
tion about relevant paragraph. A pre-trained Doc-
ument Reader model DrQA proposed by Chen
et al. (2017) on a popular machine reading QA
dataset SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is used
for this domain. This model answers open do-
main factoid questions using Wikipedia by not
considering document retrieval. An open source
implementation of this model3 is used and our re-
sults are lower than we expected: average EM
is 0.0691 and average F1 is 0.1001 on the train-
ing dataset. In the category of general ques-
tions (image based) where the relevant paragraph
is not given, the predicted answer is similar in
meaning to the ground truth but can be broader.
For instance, when the Hinglish answering ‘em-
inem ka profession kya hai?’ (Meaning: What
is Eminem’s profession?), this system gives ‘rap-
per, record producer, and actor’, as compared to
‘Rapper’. Though the system is correct, the an-
swer gathered included only ‘rapper’ which most
data collection techniques for QA face an issue.
To train these models, Hindi embedding space
is mapped into the English one. A standard ap-
proach in relation to Hindi was investigated by
(Bhattacharya et al., 2016) involving finding a
translation matrix (using linear regression) that
minimizes the reconstruction error between target
language embeddings and translated embeddings.

This idea is developed by using a neural network
and a random forest regression to find translation
matrix. By using Polyglot Hindi and English em-
beddings with Universal Word-Hindi Dictionary
we achieve MSE score of 0.057.

6 Challenges observed in CM QA

Gathering more data: The training subset con-
tains 1295 unique question-answer pairs, which
poses a significant challenge to train complex
models from scratch. As an alternative, a trans-
fer learning technique can be used, using a model
pre-trained on a large-scale open-domain fac-
toid dataset, such as SQuAD. For instance, com-
munity question answering forums can be used,
which naturally contains a lot of code-mixed lan-
guage due to the extensive borrowing of technical
terms. Such setup has two benefits: it eases the
problem of collecting new data and alleviates the
need to manually label it.
Spell Checking: Since the question-answer pairs
are coming from an informal background, some
of them are misspelt. Language identification is
an overhead to deal with this using traditional
spell checking techniques. An extensive use of
dictionaries is the most obvious approach, but a
more practical solution might be to use character-
based methods and introduce artificial noise to
make models more robust.
Romanization variability: It should also be
noted that apart from spell checking, there is vari-
ability in romanization output. For example, the
Hindi word ‘jidhar’(Meaning: where) can either
be written as ‘jidhr’. As it is unclear which of
the models of transliteration would a user prefer,
a developer needs to keep all options open.
Poor translation from open source tools: In
many cases, translation tools completely distort
the meaning of the sentence. An illustrative ex-
ample of this is: ‘Sun ka colour kya hai?’ (What
is the colour of the Sun?) - ‘What is the color of
listening?’ and so on. As one can see, an En-
glish collocation ‘full name’ is not preserved, but
translated into ‘Fullham’. In some cases it can be
explained by the incorrect use of capitalization:
‘niagara falls kaunse desh mein hai?’ is translated
into ‘What is the name of the person who is suf-
fering from diabetes?’, but using capitalized ‘N’
gives correct translation. It is worth noting that
incorrect query translation contributed to approx-
imately 35% of errors.
Answer granularity: Moreover, while perform-
ing error analysis, we have found a few cases
where a level of required granularity for an an-
swer was unclear. A common type of error for the

model was to output ‘Champ de Mars in Paris,
France’ when asked ‘Eiffel Tower kahan hai?’
(Where is the Eiffel Tower?), while the ground
truth answer was ‘france’. Errors like that account
for approximately 7% of all the wrong predictions
in the development set. Such cases suggest that
considerable attention must be paid during label-
ing of a corpus. One can either keep a list of ac-
ceptable answers or provide refined guidelines for
both annotators and developers. In the latter, it
might help to analyze human performance on the
same dataset to understand what is the most com-
mon answer granularity level.
Cross-lingual embeddings: Finally, when work-
ing with neural models, we have to carefully
approach the construction of embedding spaces.
While in the current version we have worked
only with English translations, a neater approach
would be to directly use both languages. (Ruder,
2017) provides an extensive survey of the avail-
able approaches. Whereas more and more re-
sources are emerging for Hindi, such as MUSE
(Conneau et al., 2017), few researchers have ad-
dressed the task for Telugu and Tamil.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, as a first step towards fostering
research in the area of Factoid QA in CM lan-
guages, we present our evaluation dataset consist-
ing of more than 5000 crowd-sourced questions
along with their answers in three CM languages -
Hinglish, Tenglish and Tamlish. We received a lot
more Tamlish questions on crowd sourced plat-
form compared to the other two languages. We
also shared our experiences while curating this
evaluation dataset such as usage of images as an-
chor points to avoid lexical biasing towards CM.
We have looked at the extent of lexical biasing of
the words in article based questions. In future, we
would also like to see if the participants are invert-
ing the language for the words present in the ar-
ticles. The dataset features a diverse range of an-
swer types across all the CM languages. We also
shared some interesting properties of this dataset
related to lexical bias and other phenomenon re-
lated to code mixing. In future, we would like
to explore techniques to generate synthetic CM
data from large-scale datasets.We plan on con-
tinuing the data collection process to elicit more
data. This paper also reports the first edition of the
challenge and plan on continuing it in the coming
years as well. We have made our dataset freely
available for research purposes to encourage more
research work and result in significant advances in
the area of Factoid QA in CM languages.
