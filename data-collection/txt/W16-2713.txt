Abstract

Transliteration is the phonetic translation
between two different languages. There
are many works that approach translit-
eration using machine translation meth-
ods. This paper describes the official base-
line system for the NEWS 2016 workshop
shared task. This baseline is based on a
standard phrase-based machine translation
system using Moses. Results are between
the range of best and worst from last year’s
workshops providing a nice starting point
for participants this year.

1 Introduction

Transliteration of Name Entities is a useful task
for many natural language processing applications
such as cross-language information retrieval, in-
formation extraction or even machine translation.
NEWS workshop has provided for various edi-
tions the opportunity to share strategies of translit-
eration and compare results among different sites.
NEWS workshop this year offers training, devel-
opment and test corpus for 14 language pairs. The
final goal of this paper is to offer a baseline system
for the NEWS 2016 workshop. Since a general
strategy for transliteration has been to use tech-
niques of machine translation, e.g. (Rama and
Gali, 2009; David, 2012), we have chosen to use
the phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003).

The phrase-based machine translation system
tries to find the most probable target sentence
given the source sentence. The theory behind
phrase-based system has evolved from the noisy
channel to the log-linear model, which is the one
used nowadays. This model combines several fea-
ture functions including the translation and lan-
guage model, the reordering model and the lexical
models.

The only requirement to train a phrase-based
system is to have a parallel corpus at the level of
sentence. In the case of transliteration, we use
words as sentences and characters as words. So,
for example, parallel sentences to train a translit-
eration system in English–Hindi is shown in Table
1.

Table 1: Example of English-Hindi Parallel Sen-
tences.

Next experimental section describes the prepro-
cessing of the data and the final corpus statis-
tics for the 14 tasks in the evaluation. We report
the parameters used to train the phrase-based sys-
tem. And finally, we explain the results obtained
in terms of several automatic measures. After the
experimental section, we include a section of con-
clusions.

2 Experimental framework

This section describes the corpus statistics that
we have used, the parameters of the phrase-based
system and the results obtained for each one of
the 14 tasks: Arabic-to-English (ArEn), Chinese–
English (ChEn, EnCh), English—Thai (EnTh,
ThEn), English-to-Persian (EnPe), English-to-
Hindi (EnHi), English-to-Tamil (EnTa), English-
to-Kannada (EnKa), English-to-Bangla (EnBa),
English-to-Korean (EnKo), English-to-Hebrew
(EnHe), English-to-Japanese (katakana) (EnJa),
and English to Japanese (Kanji) (EnJk).

and V for vocabulary.

2.1 Data

Table 2 details the corpus statistics for all 14 tasks
including training, development and test sets. Pre-
processing has been limited to separate characters
by a blank space.

2.2 System Description

The phrase-based system was built using Moses
(Koehn et al., 2007), version 15th April 2016
from github, with standard parameters, includ-
ing: grow-final-diag for alignment; Good-Turing
smoothing of the relative frequencies; 3-gram lan-
guage modeling using Kneser-Ney discounting
and training with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002); and lex-
icalized reordering, which includes 6 feature func-
tions. Optimization was done using the MERT al-
gorithm and MBR option for decoding. It is im-
portant to note that the same system was used for
the 14 tasks without any change or modification.

2.3 Results

Official results are reported in Table 3. In most
tasks, results were in the middle of the ranking.
Best ranking results were obtained in English-
to-Japanese (Kanji) and Arabic-to-English (no
merit this one, because the baseline was the
only participant). Worst ranking results were
for English–Thai, English-to-Tamil, English-to-
Hebrew, English-to-Korean, English-to-Japanese
(Katakana).

3 Conclusions

This phrase-based system based on standard
Moses has been offered to the NEWS organizers to
provide a reasonable baseline system for the com-
petition. Also, it helps the participants to know the
quality level of their systems compared to state-of-
the-art transliteration when faced as a translation
challenge.

In the next edition, we hope to provide an en-
