Abstract 

This paper concentrates on Punjabi language 

noun and proper name stemming. The purpose 

of stemming is to obtain the stem or radix of 

those words which are not found in dictionary. 

If stemmed word is present in dictionary, then 

that is a genuine word, otherwise it may be 

proper name or some invalid word.  In Punjabi 

language stemming for nouns and proper 

names, an attempt is made to obtain stem or 

radix of a Punjabi word and then stem or radix 

is checked against Punjabi noun and proper 

name dictionary. An in depth analysis of Pun-

jabi news corpus was made and various possi-

ble noun suffixes were identified like ੀ ਆਂ 
īāṃ, ਿੀਆਂ iāṃ, ੀ ਆਂ ūāṃ, ੀ ੀ ਂāṃ, ੀ ਏ īē etc. 
and the various rules for noun and proper 

name stemming have been generated. Punjabi 

language stemmer for nouns and proper names 

is applied for Punjabi Text Summarization. 

The efficiency of Punjabi language noun and 

Proper name stemmer is 87.37%. 

1 Introduction 

stemming is the process for reducing inflected or 

sometimes derived words to their stem, base or 

root form, generally a written word form. The 

stem need not be identical to the morphological 

root of the word, it is usually sufficient that relat-

ed words map to the same stem, even if this stem 

is not in itself a valid root. A stemmer for Eng-

lish, for example, should identify the string cats 

and possibly catlike, catty etc. as based on the 

root cat, and stemmer, stemming, stemmed as 

based on stem. A stemming algorithm reduces 

the words fishing, fished, fish, and fisher to the 

root word, fish. Stemming is an operation that 

conflates morphologically similar terms into a 

single term without doing complete morphologi-

cal analysis. Stemming (Haidar et al., 2006) is 

used in information retrieval systems to improve 

performance. Additionally, this operation reduc-

es the number of terms in the information re-

trieval system, thus decreasing the size of the 

index files. 

   In Punjabi language stemming (Mandeep et 

al.,2009) for nouns and proper names, an attempt 

is made to obtain stem or radix of a Punjabi word 

and then stem or radix is checked against Punjabi 

noun morph and proper names list. An in depth 

analysis of Punjabi news corpus was made and 

various possible noun suffixes were identified 

like ੀ ਆ ਂīāṃ, ਿੀਆ ਂiāṃ, ੀ ਆ ਂūāṃ, ੀ ੀ ਂāṃ, ੀ ਏ 
īē etc. and the various rules for noun and proper 

name stemming have been generated. Punjabi 

language stemmer for nouns and proper names is 

applied for Punjabi Text Summarization. Text 

Summarization is the process of condensing the 

source text into shorter version. Those sentences 

containing Punjabi language nouns or proper 

names are important. 

2    Background and Related Work 

The earliest English stemmer was developed by 

Julie Beth Lovins in 1968. The Porter stemming 

algorithm (Martin Porter, 1980), which was pub-

lished later, is perhaps the most widely used al-

gorithm for English stemming. Both of these 

stemmers are rule based and are best suited for 

less inflectional languages like English. (Gold-

smith, 2001) proposed an algorithm for the mor-

phology of a language based on the minimum 

description length (MDL) framework which fo-

cuses on representing the data in as compact 

manner as possible. (Creutz, 2005) uses probabil-

istic maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation 

for morpheme segmentation.  

    Not much work has been reported for stem-

ming for Indian languages compared to English 

and other European languages. The earliest work 

reported by (Ramanathan and Rao, 2003) used a 

hand crafted suffix list and performed longest 

match stripping for building a Hindi stemmer. 

(Majumder et al., 2007) developed statistical ap-

proach YASS: Yet Another Suffix Stripper 

which uses a clustering based approach based on 

string distance measures and requires no linguis-

35



tic knowledge. They concluded that stemming 

improves recall of IR systems for Indian lan-

guages like Bengali. (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007) 

worked on morphological parsing for Bengali. 

(Pandey and Siddiqui, 2008) proposed an unsu-

pervised stemming algorithm for Hindi based on 

(Goldsmith, 2001) approach. 

3 Punjabi Language stemmer for Nouns 
and Proper names 

In Punjabi language stemming (Md. et al., 2007) 

for nouns and proper names, an attempt is made 

to obtain stem or radix of a Punjabi word and 

then stem or radix is checked against Punjabi 

noun morph and Proper names list. An in depth 

analysis of corpus was made and the possible 

noun and proper name suffixes (Praveen et 

al.,2003) were identified (Table1) and the vari-

ous rules for Punjabi word noun stemming have 

been generated.

   Proper names are the names of person, place 

and concept etc. not occurring in Punjabi Dic-

tionary. Proper Names play an important role in 

deciding a sentence’s importance. From the Pun-

jabi corpus, 17598 words have been identified as 

proper names. The percentage of these proper 

names words in the Punjabi corpus is about    

13.84 %. Some of Punjabi language proper 

names are given in Table2.

   Algorithm of Punjabi language stemmer for 

nouns and proper names is given below: 

Stemming Algorithm 

   The algorithm of Punjabi language stemmer for 

nouns and proper names proceeds by segmenting 

the source Punjabi text into sentences and words. 

For each word of every sentence follow follow-

ing steps:  

 Step 1 : If current Punjabi word ends with 

ੀ ਆ ਂīāṃ then remove ਆ ਂāṃ from end. 
 Step 2 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਿੀਆ ਂiāṃ then remove ਆ ਂāṃ from end. 
 Step 3 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ਆ ਂūāṃ then remove ਆ ਂāṃ from end.  
 Step 4 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ਏ īē then remove ਏ ē from end. 
 Step 5 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਈ ī then remove ਈ ī from end. 
 Step 6 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ  ē then remove ੀ  ē from end and add 
kunna at the end 

 Step 7 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ਓ Īō then remove ਓ ō from end. 
 Step 8 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਿੀਓ iō then remove ਿੀਓ iō from end 
and add kunna at the end 

 Step 9 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਵਾਂ vāṃ then remove ਵਾਂ vāṃ from end. 
 Step 10 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ੀ ਂāṃ then remove ੀ ੀਂ āṃ from end. 
 Step 11 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ੀ ਂōṃ then remove ੀ ੀਂ ōṃ from end. 
 Step 12 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ  ō then remove ੀ  ō from end and add 
kunna at the end 

 Step 13 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ੀਂ īṃ then remove ੀ ੀਂ īṃ from end. 
 Step 14 : Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਿੀਉਂ iuṃ then remove ਿੀਉਂ iuṃ from 
end and add kunna at the end.

 Step 15: Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ੀ ਆ ā then remove ਆ ā from end. 
 Step 16: Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਿੀਆ ā then remove ਿੀਆ ā from end 
and add kunna at the end. 

 Step 17: Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਈਆ īā then remove ਆ ā from end. 
 Step 18: Else If current Punjabi word ends 

with ਜ/ਜ਼/ਸ ja/z/s then remove ਜ/ਜ਼/ਸ 
ja/z/s from end. 

 Step 19: Current Punjabi Stemmed word is 
checked against Punjabi noun morph or 

Proper names list. If found, It is Punjabi 

noun or Punjabi Proper name.

4     Results and Discussions  

An In depth analysis of output of Punjabi lan-

guage stemmer for nouns and proper names has 

been done over 50 Punjabi documents of Punjabi 

news corpus of 11.29 million words. The effi-

ciency of Punjabi language noun and Proper 

name stemmer is 87.37%, which is tested over 50 

Punjabi news documents of corpus and is ratio of 

actual correct results to total produced results by 

stemmer. Table4 gives accuracy percentage of 

various rules of stemmer which is ratio of correct 

results to total results produced under that rule, 

tested over 50 news documents. Table5 gives the 

error percentage analysis of various rules of Pun-

jabi language stemmer. Errors are due to rules 

violation or dictionary errors or due to syntax 

mistakes. Dictionary errors are those errors in 

which, after stemming, stem word is not present 

in noun morph or Proper names list, but actually 

it is noun. Syntax errors are those errors, in 

which input Punjabi word is having some syntax 

mistake, but actually that word falls under any of 

stemming rules. Overall error percentage, due to 

rules violation is 9.78%, due to dictionary mis-

takes is 2.4%  and due to spelling mistakes is 

37



0.45%. Some of rules have not been taken in the-

se table as we have not detected any accurate or 

in accurate words for those rules in the input 

Punjabi text.

Graph1 depicts the percentage usage of the 

stemming rules. As can be seen, Rule 4 and Rule 

5 are the most frequently used stemming rules. 

Unfortunately Rule 5 has a low accuracy with 

42.57% of words being wrongly stemmed by this 

rule. Actually some of Punjabi words like ਹੱਸ  
hassē (laugh), ਹਲਕ  halkē (area), ਮੌਕ  moukē 
(oppurtinity) and ਬਦਲ  badlē (revenge) are not 
nouns and are not present in noun morph, but 

they fall under Rule5 of stemmer which makes 

them noun after stemming, which is not true.If 

after stemming, root word is still not present in 

dictionary then, that word may be a proper name 

or may be syntactically wrong word which can 

be ignored.

4 Conclusions 

In this paper, we have discussed the Punjabi lan-

guage stemmer for nouns and proper names. 

Most of the lexical resources used  such as Pun-

jabi proper names list, Punjabi noun morph etc. 

had to be developed from scratch as no work had 

been done in that direction. For developing these 

resources an in depth analysis of Punjabi corpus, 

Punjabi dictionary (Gurmukh et al.,1999) and Pun-

jabi morph had to be carried out using manual 

and automatic tools. This the first time some of 

these resources have been developed for Punjabi 

and they can be beneficial for developing other 

Natural Language Processing applications in 

Punjabi. Punjabi language stemmer for nouns 

and proper names is successfully used in Punjabi 

language Text Summarization.
