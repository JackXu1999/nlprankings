Abstract

Frame semantics is a theory of linguistic meanings, and is considered to be a useful framework
for shallow semantic analysis of natural language. FrameNet, which is based on frame semantics,
is a popular lexical semantic resource. In addition to providing a set of core semantic frames and
their frame elements, FrameNet also provides relations between those frames (hence providing
a network of frames i.e. FrameNet). We address here the limited coverage of the network of
conceptual relations between frames in FrameNet, which has previously been pointed out by
others. We present a supervised model using rich features from three different sources: structural
features from the existing FrameNet network, information from the WordNet relations between
synsets projected into semantic frames, and corpus-collected lexical associations. We show large
improvements over baselines consisting of each of the three groups of features in isolation. We
then use this model to select frame pairs as candidate relations, and perform evaluation on a
sample with good precision.

1 Introduction

In the area of formal linguistics, frame semantics is a theory of meanings, which was introduced by
Charles J. Fillmore and his colleagues back in the early 1980’s. Frame semantic analysis (Das et al.,
2014), which is based on frame semantics, itself is a type of shallow semantic analysis in which the focus
is on predicates and their arguments. Frame semantic analysis is abstracting away from single verbal
predicates, used in other semantic analysis approaches such as Propbank-based work (Kingsbury and
Palmer, 2012), to ”semantic frames” (Fillmore, 1982). The idea in frame semantics is to group predicates
referring to similar events, processes, and/or object types under the umbrella term ’a semantic frame’,
which can be expressed with different parts of speech and with arguments that can have various syntactic
realizations. For instance, the sentence in example (1-a) could be seen as introducing a commerce frame,
indicated by the lexical unit buy. This frame has a set of necessary arguments, a buyer, some goods, and
a seller, which are realized by role fillers Lester, a car and Jimmy in the example. Frames can be realized
with different lexical units and syntactic constructions, so that sentences (1-b)-(1-c) would have a similar
meaning with respect to the frame in question.

(1) a. [Lester]buyer [bought]commerce [a car]goods [from Jimmy]seller.
b. [Jimmy]seller [sold]commerce [a car]goods [to Lester]buyer.
c. [Lester]buyer’s [purchase]commerce of [Jimmy]seller’s [car]goods (...)

Most recent NLP work on such semantic frames are based on FrameNet (henceforth FN) (Baker et al.,
1998), a resource listing frames, how they can be evoked, and their argument types. FrameNet also
lists how the frames are organized with respect to each other, with a set of frame-to-frame relations. If
FrameNet based analysis has proven useful for certain tasks such as information extraction (Surdeanu et
al., 2003), question-answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007), or coreference resolution (Ponzetto and Strube,
2006), its frame structure is assumed to be useful on its own for semantic analysis (Burchardt et al.,

2005), or paraphrase extraction (Hasegawa et al., 2011). It also provides additional information for se-
mantic analysis in contextual role linking, as demonstrated in (Li et al., 2015), or to improve prediction
of roles, as in the work of Kshirsagar et al. (2015). The relations are also useful to build thesauri and to
retrieve semantically related words (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006). However, one big issue with FrameNet
is its partial coverage of the lexicon and the intended set of frames, which translates also into a partial
coverage of frame relations. Numerous studies address FrameNet’s lack of lexical coverage (Pennac-
chiotti et al., 2008; Das and Smith, 2012; Pavlick et al., 2015). In contrast, little work has been done on
extending frame relations except by Ovchinnikova et al. (2010), in which cluster of frames are proposed
based on collocation information, along with principles to be respected when adding new relations, or
Pennacchiotti and Wirth (2009), which defines a generic notion of “relatedness” between frames, with no
semantics to compare this to FrameNet relations. Both approaches are unsupervised, and provide little
evaluation of the relevance to the intended FN structure.

We present a supervised approach to enrich FrameNet’s relational structure by training a model on the
existing set of frame relations and a rich set of features combining linguistic and structural information.
Further, we also leverage external resources such as WordNet. The resulting model is used to predict new
frame-to-frame relations whose validity is then manually evaluated. The rest of the paper is organized as
follows: Section 2 presents in more detail FN frame relations, Section 3 presents our methodology and
the three group of features we use for training a supervised model. Section 4 presents our experimental
results based (1) on a separate test set taken from already existing FrameNet relations, and (2) a human
evaluation of newly proposed relations.

2 FrameNet Relations

FrameNet is a lexical semantic resource which is based on the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore,
1982). A set of script-like descriptions, known as semantic frames, of real world situations is collected
and maintained along with the participants of those situations. Each of the semantic frames has a set of
associated words (known as frame evoking elements, FEE) which can evoke a particular predicate. The
participants of a situation (called frame elements, FE instead of the more classical term ’semantic role’)
are also identified for each frame. In addition, each semantic frame is coupled with example sentences
taken from naturally occurring natural language text. FrameNet-1.5 has 1230 semantic frames, 11829
lexical units, and 173018 example sentences.

As mentioned previously, FrameNet has defined a set of frame-to-frame relations, and has proposed
connections of certain frames to certain other frames, thus providing a network. The backbone of this
network is built on a hierarchy of predicate types, and typical sub-events of specific situations. Event
participants, also called frame elements, of the connected frames may also have one-to-one connections.
Some of these frames are introduced purely for the coherence of the structure and may not have associated
lexical items (“unlexicalized frames”). The following is a list of relations defined between two frames X
and Y:

• Subframe(X,Y): a complex scenario X, e.g. CRIMINAL PROCESS, is composed of typical sub-
events (e.g. Y can be TRIAL, SENTENCING...).

• Precedes(X,Y): X is before Y in a typical scenario, e.g. TRIAL precedes SENTENCING.
• Inheritance(X,Y): A relation between frames where one frame is a more specific version of another

frame e.g. ANIMALS inherits from BIOLOGICAL ENTITY.

• Causative of(X,Y): X is a potential cause of Y, e.g AIMING is causative of HIT OR MISS.
• Inchoative of(X,Y): X is an inchoative of Y, e.g. ROTTING is inchoative of BEING ROTTEN.
• Perspectivized in(X,Y): X represents a specific perspective of Y, e.g. COMMERCE BUY and COM-

MERCE SELL are two different perspectives of COMMERCE TRANSFER GOODS.

• Using(X,Y): X somehow involves Y, e.g. PEOPLE BY AGE uses the AGE frame.

• See also(X,Y): Frames that have some similarities, but need to be differentiated carefully (e.g.
MEASURABLE ATTRIBUTE and DIMENSION).

Figure (1) gives an example of a subset of relations around the CRIMINAL PROCESS Frame, that will
be used for illustration in the rest of the paper.

3 Experimental Design and Features

Our goal is to provide a method to enrich FrameNet structures with new relations where supervision is
given by the existing frame relations. Our experimental methodology is thus two-fold: 1) we trained
a discriminative model to predict frame-to-frame relations in a supervised setting using the existing re-
lations listed in the original FrameNet and selected counter-examples; and 2) we applied this model to
predict likely frame-to-frame relations that are not already listed. We used rich features from three differ-
ent sources, taking inspiration from the unsupervised relatedness measures of (Pennacchiotti and Wirth,
2009), which are based on lexical collocations, but adding more features: structural features from the ex-
isting FrameNet network, information from WordNet relations between synsets projected into semantic
frames, and different additional corpus-collected lexical associations. Since we want to focus on event-
denoting predicates, which have arguably richer and potentially more interesting argument structures,
and are more likely to be related in common scenarios, we restricted ourselves to frames with at least
one verb trigger. This restricts the existing relations to 824 frame pairs. Next we describe the different
set of features used in our experiments.

3.1 WordNet Based Features

WordNet provides useful lexical and semantic relations between synonym sets. The most important
among those relations are hypernymy/hyponymy and meronymy/honolymy. Hypernym and hyponym
(and troponymy for verbs) are super-subordinate relations and link more general synsets to specific ones
and could be relevant for Frame inheritance, and thus make the first source of information for predicting
frame relations. As we are interested in relationships between pairs of frames, instead of pair of synsets,
we need to transfer knowledge about relations between synsets to useful features between frames whose
verbs appear in WordNet synsets. There have been attempts at matching WordNet sense inventory to
FrameNet frames (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Tonelli and Pighin, 2009) but since both resources are in-
complete, we decided to compute frame relatedness using an existing WordNet relation between synsets
which include verbs from the given frames, irrespective of their senses. This certainly introduces some
noise, that we hope to control with redundancies in frame-to-frame associations. For our purposes, we
have divided WN-based features into two groups: (1) occurrence-based features (2) similarity-based fea-
tures. Occurrence-based features are simple counts of existence of a particular relation between a pair

3544



from all possible pairs of all senses of all lexical units of the two candidate frames. By taking the ex-
istence of a particular relation between senses and summing them up, we are projecting the knowledge
about WordNet’s synset relations to FrameNet’s frames.

For a given pair of frames (Fi, Fj), and a given WordNet relation R (i.e. hypernym, hyponym, all
meronym relations, all holonyms relations, attributes, entailments, causes, also sees) the number of
occurrence-based feature values were computed using the following formula:

number rel(Fi, Fj , R) =
∑

(lui,luj)∈LUFi×LUFj

[ ∑
(slui ,sluj )∈Slui×Sluj

R(slui , sluj ) = True
]

LUFi and LUFj are sets of lexical units of frames Fi and Fj respectively, while Slui and Sluj are sets
of various senses of the corresponding lexical units in WordNet. The values of the semantic similarity
based features were computed using a similar formula (but averaged) for a given similarity function f
and two frames F1 and F2:

similarity(Fi, Fj , f) =
1

|LUFi × LUFj |
×

∑
(lui,luj)∈LUFi×LUFj

[∑
(slui ,sluj )∈Slui×Sluj f(slui , sluj )

|Slui × Sluj |
]

The semantic similarity measures are classical wordnet similarity measures: Path, Wu-Palmer (Wu and
Palmer, 1994) and Leacock-Chodorow (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), computed using NLTK’s (Bird,
2006) Python interface. They all take into consideration the path between synsets in WordNet’s hierarchy
with different normalization factors. For instance Wu-Palmer is based on the depths of two synsets
in the WordNet hierarchy along with the depth of the least common subsumer. The path similarity
measure is a semantic association measure which is based on the shortest path that connects two synsets
in the taxonomy in which the senses occurred. LCH similarity takes into consideration the depth of the
taxonomy in addition to the shortest path, and is computed as −log(p/2d), where p denotes the shortest
path and d is the depth. For the purpose of projecting WordNet’s synset knowledge to FrameNet’s
frames, we are summing up and averaging the corresponding semantic similarity values of all possible
combinations of various senses of all lexical units of the two candidate frames.

3.2 FrameNet Based Features
FrameNet network structure can also be a useful resource to compute frame-relatedness between non
explicitely related frames. (Pennacchiotti and Wirth, 2009) proposed to apply equivalents of Wu-Palmer
similarity and Hirst-St.Onge’s (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998) measure to FrameNet’s hierarchy. They also
suggested to take into account frame element overlap (the proportion of predicate roles having the same
name). Here, the frame element overlap similarly is based on the number of frame-elements (role names)
shared by the two candidate frames. Hirst-St.Onge measure is a semantic similarity measure which is
based on the path connecting two WordNet synsets and how often one needs to change direction to reach
one from the other in the network. A ”change of direction” would be for instance a path along an hy-
pernym relation then an hyponym relation (which yields a likely co-hyponym). The intuition is that two
synsets are semantically closer if they are connected through a ”not too long path which does not change
direction too often”. This can be applied similarly over FrameNet’s relations, even though some of these
are vaguer than WordNet relations. An example path in figure 1 would be the path (SubFrame−1+Using)
between SENTENCE and APPEAL.

In addition to the hierarchy-based features, frame verbal definitions can potentially provide useful
information for frame relatedness, and we decided to also use a definition overlap as a feature, with a
Jaccard between the sets of open-class words of each definition (open(F) being the set of open-class
words in F definition):

def overlap(F1, F2) =
‖open(F1)‖ ∪ ‖open(F2)‖
‖open(F1)‖ ∩ ‖open(F2)‖

3.3 Corpus-Based Features
In addition to the previous sets of features, which make use of existing resources or of the existing
structure we want to expand, we derived clues from large corpora where frame lexical units can be ob-
served in the same contexts, indicating a potentially regular relation between their corresponding frames.
We collected both general ococcurences, in the spirit of (Pennacchiotti and Wirth, 2009), and targetted
associations of verbs in explicit discursive contexts, inspired by (Conrath et al., 2014).

Frame Coocurrences We used statistics of frame co-occurrences from a large-scale corpus to predict
frame relatedness, relying on the intuition that related frames tend to co-occur more often in the same
context within a given corpus. The context could be either a document, a sentence, or a specific number
of sentences. We computed the co-occurrence of frames as point-wise mutual information (PMI) within
the GigaWord corpus (Graff et al., 2003). Similar information has already been used in (Pennacchiotti
and Wirth, 2009), but we deal with the frame ambiguity problem differently.

Ideally, one would like to compute frame co-occurrences statistics from a frame annotated corpus
which is big enough for machine learning tasks. FrameNet does provide a frame annotated corpus, but
it is too small to be truly useful for making generalizations. A workaround is to use an unannotated cor-
pus together with FN’s frame-evoking lexicon to decide which frame is being triggered by a particular
lexical unit. The problem is now to resolve the ambiguity in cases where a lexical unit can potentially
trigger more than one frame. (Pennacchiotti and Wirth, 2009) suggested a weighted co-occurrence mea-
sure, which gave lower weights to the co-occurrence of ambiguous words. The probabilities of sense
occurrences of lexical units were learned from the WordNet sense tagged corpus SemCor. Our approach
is slightly different in the sense that instead of learning word-sense probabilities first and then map-
ping it to frames, we directly learn the probabilities of lexical units triggering particular frames from
FrameNet’s annotated corpus using the ratio of the number of frames triggered by a lexical unit lu in the
FrameNet corpus and of the total number of occurrences of lu in the corpus. This is arguably more direct
and only use FrameNet information, although both approaches need annotated data. The probabilities
are then used to compute a weighted PMI between frames (the weighting function simply sums up the
probabilities of a lexical unit triggering a particular frame F over the entire GigaWord).

Lexical Coocurrences We also used as features measures of semantic similarity derived from corpus-
based specific associations between lexical items. If we can find valid lexical associations to match
the targeted frame relations, we can obtain relevant association measures. We adapted the method of
(Conrath et al., 2014), in which semantic associations between verbs are derived from cooccurrences
between two verbs and certain classes of discourse markers, using mutual information measures. This
shallow discourse analysis can be seen as extraction of typical semantic relations between verbs. Using
the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008) list of markers, grouped into semantic classes, we
computed six types of associations between verbs: (1) causal, (2) temporal, (3) continuation, (4) contrast,
(5) disjunction, (6) elaboration. Each corresponds to a coherent set of markers and can provide clues to
corresponding FrameNet relations: causative-of for (1), precede for (2) and (3), subframe for (6), and
(4) and (5) for some form of looser relatedness that is sometimes encoded as ”see-also” or ”using”
in FrameNet. For each class we implemented the three best measures according to (Conrath et al.,
2014), which correspond to different normalizations or combinations of the verbs and discourse relation
cooccurrences : normalized PMI (Evert, 2005), a specificity measure taken from (Mirroshandel et al.,
2013), and a combined association measure they call w combined. They are supposed to capture different
aspects of the targeted lexical associations. Let P(V1,V2,R) be the probability of the association of the
two verbs V1,V2 with the given semantic relation R:

NPMI(V1, V2, R) = PMI(V1, V2, R)/(−2 log(P (V1, V2, R)))

We computed the corresponding association values for frame-pairs using the same averaging scheme
as for the previous features over groups of lexical units, see 3.1

4 Experiments and Results

The previous features were computed for two sets of frame-pairs: (1) All those frames-pairs which have
any of the frame-relations mentioned in section 2. As mentioned previously, we restricted ourselves
to frames denoting events, i.e. which have at least one verb trigger. There are 824 such instances.
(2) The set of all unrelated frame-pairs. From these two sets, a balanced set of 1648 frame-pairs (824
positive, and 824 negative) was collected, 10% of which was set aside for testing the chosen model. The
remaining 90% of the balanced set was used to train and evaluate different models with different feature
combinations. The best combination, evaluated by cross-validation, was evaluated on the test set, and
then used to train a new model on the full balanced set, which we applied to all ”unrelated” frame pairs
(i.e. to predict likely frame relations between frame pairs that are not already listed in the FrameNet),
with a fixed a priori confidence threshold in order to focus first on precision of the candidate pairs1.

4.1 Training a Supervised Model

For the first part of our method, we trained a binary classifier to decide whether a given pair of frames is
related or not. To provide negative examples, we randomly sampled the set of unrelated frame pairs. Of
course we don’t know the real proportion of frames that should be (ideally) related, but we suspect that
such a relational structure is likely to be sparse, and thus taking random pairs should yield mostly truly
unrelated pairs.

Assuming the actual relational structure is sparse, we probably face an imbalanced classification prob-
lem, in which we want to identify primarily the minority class. That is why we chose to balance the
number of positive and negative instances during training, since it means we are doing majority class un-
dersampling, a classic simple way of addressing class imbalance, and it is also a simple way to evaluate
the relevance of our features. This is likely to generate too many candidate pairs on the test, degrad-
ing precision while helping recall of the positive class, something we can control a posteriori on new
instances by imposing a confidence threshold on the classifier output (see below).

We used a Random Forest classifier with 1000 estimators and a minimum of 10 instances for splitting,
and the implementation provided in the scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Random Forest is
a robust classifier used in a variety of tasks and perform best among the classifiers evaluated on cross-
validation on the training set. As baselines, we tested each separate group of features: WordNet transfer,
corpus cooccurences, and FrameNet features. Note that a majority/random baseline would give a score
of 50% with the balanced setting we chose. We observed that the combination of features proves very
useful, as cross-validation accuracies for the three groups are much lower than the full model. Interest-
ingly, all groups of features seem necessary, as even removing the group which performs worse by itself
lowers the training accuracy by 5% (ablations of each group of features were tried by cross-validation
on the train only). Final results are presented in Table 1. Not surprisingly, the most informative features
come from FrameNet itself, since positively related frames are more likely to be in “denser” parts of the
network, at least those parts that have been the focus of the lexicographic work, and this can be seen as
a bias of the model. Note however that (1) these denser areas of the network might still be incomplete
and (2) the other sources of information definitely contribute to the overall result, adding 10 points over

FrameNet based features. We provide confidence intervals on the scores (which are proportion estima-
tions), and we can see the different models’ intervals don’t overlap much, even on the small test sample.

4.2 Finding New Relations
We used the previous supervised model on the set of all possible pairs of frames to predict potential
new relations. Since the model has been trained on a balanced set, we probably over-generate positive
labels, so as a first basic step to improve the precision of the extraction, we set an arbitrary cutoff for the
confidence level according to the model, at the value 0.8. This yielded over 1500 pairs, out of which we
randomly selected 100 pairs for validation. We mixed the pairs with an equal number of 100 ”distractors”
(random pairs absent from FrameNet), to prevent annotation bias. Note that, again, we have no a priori
way of ensuring these distractors are not actual unknown relations, but we expect true relations to be
rare in this set. Two of the authors then judged if one of the FN relations could hold, based on the
summary of the relations from the FrameNet book, and a description of the frames as defined in FN,
i.e. a short definition, sometimes a few example sentences, a list of frame element names (arguments of
the frame), and a list of lexical units that can evoke the frame. They had to label each pair as Yes/No,
and were asked to indicate a tentative label from the set of FrameNet relations (there could be 0, 1,
or 2 relations according to their level of confidence in their decision). We did the same procedure on
the top 100 frame pairs according to the classifier, also mixed with 100 random pairs. We computed
inter-annotator agreement with Cohen’s Kappa which was 0.65, generally considered as an acceptable
agreement above 0.6, at least for semantic tasks. Raw agreement was 0.83. To estimate agreement on the
labels, we consider judgments for common Yes decisions, and we considered the intersection of proposed
labels (if two labels were proposed and one was common we counted that as a positive). Keeping only
pairs for which each annotator gave an answer (only half of the pairs), the Kappa was at 0.5, mainly
because of agreement on inheritance pairs. Given that a Kappa of 0.5 indicates moderate agreement, even
with the lenient setting we provided, the relation types need some clarification. We can still tentatively
conclude that the inheritance relation can be annotated, but in the remaining, we only discuss relatedness.

Table 3: Top ten false positive new relations predicted, according to the probability given by the model.

Both authors adjudicated the differences in the relatedness question, and only pairs with both positive
judgments were finally considered positive. Out of the top 100 positive candidates, 63 were labeled
as positive by human annotators giving a 63% precision, and 52 out of the 100 selected above the 0.8
threshold, with respectively ±9.3 and ±9.8% confidence interval. This means a large proportion of
proposed frame pairs could be considered for addition, and that proportion does not decrease too quickly
when the confidence of the classifier decreases. We cannot estimate recall, as we don’t know how many
relations there should be overall, but we observed that only 4 pairs out of the distractors were judged
positive, which seems to indicate relations are indeed rare with respect to all possible pairs. Note that
estimating recall among a subsample of n frames would require a number of judgments equal to n2× the
number of relation types. Table 2 and 3 shows a list of top 10 true and false positive relations predicted
by our model.

We did an error analysis on the 37 false positive in the top 100 test set, and came to the conclusion
that most frame pairs were picked up as related because they involve related lexical units (and often with
different senses), rather obviously, and that they involve either (1) co-hyponyms at different levels of
granularity; or (2) frame describing opposite events, such as Removing and Filling, which do not corre-
spond to any FrameNet relation. Case (2) is arguably a FrameNet problem, since a lot of frames involve
antonyms, and could indicate here missing frames at a higher level up the hierarchy of inheritance, an
inconsistency noted in previous work (Hasegawa et al., 2011). As an example the two adjectives easy
and difficult are part of the same Frame DIFFICULTY, while the verbs empty and fill are in separate frames
EMPTYING and FILLING. Case (1) is an interesting perspective for improvement: relations should not
be considered between frame pairs in isolation, but with respect to all existing or predicted relations, in
a global way. If a frame F1 is already related to a frame F2, there should not be a relation between F1
and, e.g., subframes of F2. Note also that most Frames that are siblings in a subframe relation also have
explicit relations, usually a “Precede” relation (see figure 1), but also vaguer links such as “Using”.

5 Conclusion and Future Directions

Our main contribution is to present the first supervised method to provide candidate relations between
FrameNet frames, using a rich set of structural and linguistic features inspired by previous unsupervised
work which did not provide evaluation with respect to FrameNet’s set of relations. A secondary con-
tribution is in showing that Frame relation annotation is possible with good agreement, based only on
Frame descriptions, although labeling proves to be more difficult. This also raised the question of the
completeness of relation types in FrameNet, or at least the consistency of certain decisions that are made
in grouping lexical predicates. As a perspective, we plan to evaluate our model predictions at various
levels of confidence, to determine the best compromise between precision and recall when providing
relation instance candidates for human validation. It would also be interesting to combine this approach
with work on lexical expansion of FN, such as (Pavlick et al., 2015), or use an unsupervised method to

3549



pre-filter candidate pairs, using looser lexical association resources, such as the Moby thesaurus (Ward,
1996).

An interesting perspective given the conclusions of the error analysis would be to try to predict new re-
lations in a global way, using principles on the well-formedness of such ontological/lexical relationships,
following the ontological principles given in (Ovchinnikova et al., 2010), or work on lexical taxonomy
induction, see e.g. (Navigli et al., 2011).

As mentioned previously, FrameNet does provide a list of FE-to-FE relations for each of the connected
frame pairs. In this paper, we have proposed ways to predict new frame-to-frame relations, and we plan to
explore the possibilities of automatically linking frame-elements of the newly proposed frame-to-frame
relations.
