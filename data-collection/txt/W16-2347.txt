Abstract

This paper presents the results of the
WMT16 Bilingual Document Alignment
Shared Task. Given crawls of web sites,
we asked participants to align documents
that are translations of each other. 11 re-
search groups submitted 19 systems, with
a top performance of 95.0%.

1 Introduction

Parallel corpora are especially important for train-
ing statistical machine translation systems, but so
far the collection of such data within the academic
research community has been ad hoc and limited
in scale. To promote this research problem we or-
ganized a shared task on one of the core process-
ing steps in acquiring parallel corpora from the
web: aligning bilingual documents from crawled
web sites.

The task is to identify pairs of English and
French documents from a given collection of doc-
uments such that one document is the translation
of the other. As possible pairs we consider all pairs
of documents from the same webdomain for which
the source side has been identified as (mostly) En-
glish and the target side as (mostly) French.

Lack of data in some cases has held back re-
search. To give an example, there are significant
research efforts on various Indic languages (Post
et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2013; Singh, 2013), but
this work has been severely hampered, since it
uses very small amounts of data. But even for
the language pairs tackled in high profile evalua-
tion campaigns, such as the ones organized around
WMT, IWSLT, and even NIST, we use magnitudes
of data less than what has been reported to be used
in the large-scale efforts of Google or Microsoft.
This diminishes the value of research findings: re-
ported improvements for methods may not hold up

once more data is used. Work in reduced data set-
tings may also distract from efforts to tackle prob-
lems that do not go away with more data, but are
inherent limitations of current models.

2 Related Work

Although the idea of crawling the web indiscrimi-
nately for parallel data goes back to the 20th cen-
tury (Resnik, 1999), work in the academic com-
munity on extraction of parallel corpora from the
web has so far mostly focused on large stashes
of multilingual content in homogeneous form,
such as the Canadian Hansards, Europarl (Koehn,
2005), the United Nations (Rafalovitch and Dale,
2009; Ziemski et al., 2015), or European Patents
(Täger, 2011). A nice collection of the products of
these efforts is the OPUS web site1 (Skadiņš et al.,
2014).

These efforts focused on individual web sites
allow for writing specific rules for aligning doc-
uments as well as extracting and aligning content.
Scaling these manual efforts to thousands or mil-
lions of web sites is not practical.

A typical processing pipeline breaks up parallel
corpus extraction into five steps:

• Identifying web sites with bilingual content
• Crawling web sites
• Document alignment
• Sentence alignment
• Sentence pair filtering

For each of these steps, there has been varying
amount of prior work and for some tools are read-
ily available. Since there has been comparatively
little work on document alignment, we picked this
problem as the subject for the shared task this
year, but other steps are valid candidates for future
tasks.

2.1 Web Crawling

Web crawling is a topic that has not received much
attention from a specific natural language process-
ing perspective. There are a number of challenges,
such as identification of web sites with multilin-
gual content, avoiding to crawl web pages with
identical textual content, learning how often to re-
crawl web sites based on frequency of newly ap-
pearing content, avoiding crawling of large sites
that have content in different languages that is not
parallel, and so on.

We used for the preparation of this shared task
the tool Httrack2 which is a general web crawler
that can be configured in various ways. Papavas-
siliou et al. (2013) present the focused crawler
ILSP-FC3 that integrates crawling more closely
with subsequent processing steps like text normal-
ization and deduplication.

2.2 Document Alignment

Document alignment can be defined as a matching
task that takes a pair of documents and computes
a score that reflects the likelihood that they are
translations of each others. Common choices in-
clude edit-distance between linearized documents
(Resnik and Smith, 2003), cosine distance of idf-
weighted bigram vectors (Uszkoreit et al., 2010),
and probability of a probabilistic DOM-tree align-
ment model (Shi et al., 2006).

2.3 Sentence Alignment

The topic of sentence alignment has received a lot
of attention, dating back to the early 1990s with
the influential Church and Gale algorithm that is
language-independent and easy to implement. It
relies on relative sentence lengths for alignment
decisions and hence is not tolerant to noisy input.

Popular tools are Hunalign4 (Varga et al., 2005),
Gargantua5 (Braune and Fraser, 2010), Bilingual
Sentence Aligner (Moore, 2002) Bleualign6 (Sen-
nrich and Volk, 2010), and Champollion7 (Ma,
2006). Shi and Zhou (2008) make use of the
HTML structure to guide alignment. All of these
use bilingual lexicons which may have to be pro-
vided upfront or are learned unsupervised.

5https://sourceforge.net/projects/gargantua/
6https://github.com/rsennrich/Bleualign
7https://sourceforge.net/projects/champollion/

It is not clear, which of these tools fares best
with noisy parallel text that we can expect from
web crawls, which may have spurious content and
misleading boilerplate.

2.4 Filtering

A final stage of the processing pipeline filters out
bad sentence pairs. These exist either because the
original web site did not have any actual parallel
data (garbage in, garbage out), or due to failures
of earlier processing steps.

As Rarrick et al. (2011) point out, a key prob-
lem for parallel corpora extracted from the web
is filtering out translations that have been created
by machine translation. Venugopal et al. (2011)
propose a method to watermark the output of ma-
chine translation systems to aid this distinction.
Antonova and Misyurev (2011) report that rule-
based machine translation output can be detected
due to certain word choices, and machine transla-
tion output due to lack of reordering.

This year, a shared task on sentence pair filter-
ing8 was organized, albeit in the context of clean-
ing translation memories which tend to be cleaner
that the data at the end of a pipeline that starts with
web crawls.

2.5 Comprehensive Tools

For a few language pairs, there have been indi-
vidual efforts to cast a wider net, such as the
billion word French–English corpus collected by
Callison-Burch et al. (2009), or a 200 million word
Czech–English corpus collected by Bojar et al.
(2010). Smith et al. (2013) present a set of fairly
basic tools to extract parallel data from the pub-
licly available web crawl CommonCrawl9.

In all these cases, the corpus collection effort re-
invented the wheel and wrote dedicated scripts to
download web pages, extract text, and align sen-
tences, with hardly any description of the methods
used.

Our data preparation for the shared task builds
partly on Bitextor10, which is a comprehensive
pipeline from corpus crawling to sentence pair
cleaning (Esplà-Gomis, 2009).

3 Training and Test Data

We made available crawls of web sites (defined as
pages under the same webdomain) that have trans-
lated content. We also annotated some document
pairs to provide supervised training data to the par-
ticipants of the shared task.

3.1 Terminology
A quick note on terminology: Unfortunately, the
notion of domain is ambiguous in NLP applica-
tions, and we use an unusual meaning of the word
in this report. To avoid confusion we will in-
stead use the term webdomain to refer to content
from a specific website, e.g,“This page is from
the statmt.org webdomain.” We distinguish be-
tween webdomains using their Fully Qualified Do-
main Name (FQDN). Thus, www.example.com
and example.com are considered to be different
webdomains.

We will use source to denote English pages and
target for French ones. This does not imply that
translation was performed in that direction. In fact
we cannot know if translation from one side to the
other was performed at all, both sides could possi-
bly be translations of a third language document.

The task was organized as part of the First Con-
ference on Machine Translation (WMT), and all
data can be downloaded from its web page11.

3.2 Data Preparation
We crawled full web sites with the web site copyer
HTTrack, from the homepage down, restricted to
HTML content. Web sites differed significantly
in their size, from a few hundred pages to almost
100,000.

In the test data we removed all duplicates from
the crawl12. Duplicates are defined as web pages,
whose text content is identical. Duplicates may
differ in markup and URL. To extract the text
we used a Python implementation of the HTML5
parser to extract text as a browser would see it. As
the text is free of formatting, determining whites-
pace is important. While generally following the
standard, e.g. inserting line breaks after block level
elements13, we found that inserting spaces around
<span> tags helps tokenization as these are often
visually separated using CSS.
11http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/bilingual-task.html
12Because we provide the extracted texts of the training pages

participants were able to do the same
13https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/
Web/HTML/Block-level_elements

We restricted the task to the alignment of French
and English documents, so we filtered out all web
pages that are not in these two languages. How-
ever, we did not expect that participants would
develop language-specific approaches. To detect
the language of a document we feed the extracted
text into an automatic language detector 14. We
note that language detection is a noisy process and
many pages contain mixed language context, for
example English boilerplate but French content.
We take the overall majority language per page as
the document language.

We decided to have a large collection of web
sites, to encourage methods that can cope with
various types of web sites, such as differing in
size, balance in the number of French and English
pages, and so on.

Given the large number of correct document
pairs, we did not even attempt to annotate all
of them, but instead randomly selected a subset
of pages and identified their corresponding trans-
lated page. We augmented this effort with aligned
document pairs that are indicated at the web site
Linguee16, a searchable collection of parallel cor-
pora, in which each retrieved sentence is annotated
with its source web page.

The task then is to find these document pairs.
Since this is essentially a recall measure, which
can be gamed by returning all possible document
pairs, we enforce a 1-1 rule, so that participants
may align each web page only once.

3.3 Training Data

As training data we provide a set of 1,624 EN-FR
pairs from 49 webdomains. The number of an-
notated document pairs per webdomain varies be-
tween 4 and over 200. All pairs are from within
a single webdomain, possible matches between
two different webdomains, e.g. siemens.de and
siemens.com, are not considered in this task.

The full list of webdomains in the training
data is listed in Table 1. Webdomains range in
size from 33×29 pages (schackportalen.nu) to
24,325×43,045 pages (www.nauticnews.com).

3.4 Test Data

For testing, we provide 203 additional crawls of
new webdomains, distinct from the ones in the
training data in the same format. No aligned pairs

are provided for the any of these domains. We re-
moved exact duplicates of pages, keeping only one
instance. Otherwise, we processed the data in the
same way as the training data.

3.5 Data Format

The training document pairs are specified as one
pair per line:
Source URL<TAB>Target URL

For the crawled data we provide one file per
webdomain in .lett format adapted from Bitex-
tor. This is a plain text format with one line per
page. Each line consists of 6 tab-separated values:

• Language ID (e.g. en)
• Mime type (always text/html)
• Encoding (always charset=utf-8)
• URL
• HTML in Base64 encoding
• Text in Base64 encoding

To facilitate use of the .lett files we provide a
simple reader class in Python. We make sure that
the language id is reliable, at least for the docu-
ments in the train and test pairs.

Text extraction was performed using an
HTML5 parser. As the original HTML pages are
available, participants are welcome to implement
their own text extraction, for example to remove
boilerplate.

Additionally, we have identified spans of
French text in French documents for which we
produced English translations using MT. We use
a basic Moses statistical machine translation en-
gine (Koehn et al., 2007) trained on Europarl and
News Commentary with decoding settings geared
towards speed (no lexicalized reordering model,
no additional language model, cube pruning with
pop limit 500).

These translations are not part of the lett files
but provided separately. The format for the source
segments and target segments is
URL<TAB>Text

where the same URL might occur multiple
times if several lines/spans of French text were
found. The URLs can be used to identify the cor-
responding documents in the .lett files.

3.6 Baseline Method

We provide a baseline systems that relies on the
URL matching heuristic used by Smith et al.
(2013). Here two URLs are considered a pair

if both can be transformed into the same string
through stripping of language identifiers. Strings
indicating languages are found by splitting a large
number of randomly sampled URLs into compo-
nents and manually picking substrings that corre-
late with the detected language.

We further improve the approach by allow-
ing matches where only one URL contains a
strip-able language identifier, e.g. we match
x.com/index.htm and x.com/fr index.htm.
If a URL has several matching candidates we pick
the one that requires the fewest rewrites, i.e. we
prefer the pair above over x.com/en/index.htm
x.com/fr index.htm.

The baseline achieves roughly 60% recall, com-
pared to 95.0% of the best submission.

4 Evaluation

Our main evaluation metric is recall of the known
pairs, i.e. what percentage of the aligned pages in
the test set are found. We strictly enforce the rule
that every page may only be aligned once, so that
participants cannot just align everything. After a
URL has been seen as part of a submitted pair, all
later occurrences are ignored.

After we released the gold standard alignments,
a number of participants pointed out that some
predicted document pairs were unfairly counted as
wrong, even if their content differed only insignif-
icantly from the gold standard.

To give an example, the web pages
www.taize.fr/fr article10921.html?chooselang=1

and
www.taize.fr/fr article10921.html

are almost identical, but the first offers a check-
box to select a language, while the second does
not. Since the text on the pages differs slightly,
these were not detected as (exact) duplicates.

To address this problem, we also included a soft
scoring metric which counts such near-matches
as correct. We chose that to be a close duplicate,
the edit distance between the text of two pages,
normalized by the maximum of their lengths (in
characters) must not exceed 5%.

If we observe a predicted pair (s, t) that is not
in the gold set, but (s, t′) is and dist(t, t′) ≤ 5%,
then this pair is still counted as correct. The same
applies for a close duplicate s′ of s but not both as
we still follow the 1-1 rule.

Table 2: List of participants

5 Results

11 research groups participated in the shared task,
some with multiple submissions. The list of par-
ticipants is shown in Table 2, with a citation of
their system descriptions, which are included in
these conference proceedings.

Each participant submitted one or more collec-
tions of document pairs. We enforced the 1-1 rule
on the collections, and scored them against the
gold standard. Results are summarized in Table 3.
Almost all systems outperformed the baseline by
a wide margin. The best system is NOVALINCS-
URL-COVERAGE with 2,281 correct pairs, 95.0%
of the total.

Note that the submissions varied in the num-
ber of document pairs, but after enforcing the 1-1
rule, most submissions comprise about 200,000-
300,000 document pairs.

Table 4 displays the results with soft scoring.
Essentially, every system improved, mostly by
around 3%. The top two performers swapped
places, with YODA now having the best showing
with 96.0%. We also experimented with a tighter
threshold of 1% which gave almost identical re-
sults.

6 System Descriptions

NOVALINCS (Gomes and Pereira Lopes, 2016)
submitted 3 systems that use a phrase table from
a phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-
tem to compute coverage scores, based on the ra-
tio of phrase pairs covered by a document pair.
In addition to the purely coverage-based system,

NOVALINCS-COVERAGE (88.6%), they also sub-
mit a system that uses coverage-based matching
as a preference over URL matching NOVALINCS-
COVERAGE-URL (85.8%) and the converse system
that prefers URL matching over coverage-based
matching NOVALINCS-URL-COVERAGE (95.0%).

YODA (Dara and Lin, 2016) submitted one
system (93.9%) that uses the machine translation
of the French document, and finds the English cor-
responding document based on bigram and 5-gram
matches, assisted by a heuristics based on docu-
ment length ratio.

UEDIN1 (Buck and Koehn, 2016) submitted
one system (89.1%) that uses cosine similarity be-
tween tf/idf weighted vectors, extracted by collect-
ing n-grams from the English and machine trans-
lated French text. They compare many hyper-
parameters such as weighting schemes and two
pair selection algorithms.

DOCAL (Azpeitia and Etchegoyhen, 2016)
submitted one system (88.6%) that used word
translation lexicons to compute document similar-
ity scores based on bag-of-word representations.
They expand a basic translation lexicon by adding
all capitalized tokens, numbers, and longest com-
mon prefixes of known vocabulary items.

UEDIN2 (Germann, 2016) submitted 2 sys-
tems based on word vector space representations
of documents using latent semantic indexing and
URL matching, UEDIN LSI (85.8%) and UEDIN
LSI (87.6%). In addition to a global cosine sim-
ilarity score, a local similarity score is computed
by re-centering the vector around the mean vector
for a webdomain.

ILSP/ARC (Papavassiliou et al., 2016) sub-
mitted one system (84.9%), which uses boiler-
plate removal, and carries out document alignment
based on features such as links to documents in the
same webdomain, URLs, digits, image filenames
and HTML structure. Their paper also describes
in detail the open source ILSP Focused Crawler.

YSDA (Shchukin et al., 2016) submitted one
system (84.1%) that uses n-gram matches between
the machine translation of the French document
and the English document. They cluster French
and English words into bilingual clusters of up
to 90 words, starting with word pairs with high
translation probability in both directions, and then
adding words that translated well into existing
words in a cluster.

UA PROMPSIT (Esplà-Gomis et al., 2016)
submitted 2 systems based on Bitextor and de-
scribe improvements to the Bitextor toolkit. Their
submissions contrast the old version of the tool,
UA PROMPSIT BITEXTOR 4.1 (31.1%), with
the recent release, UA PROMPSIT BITEXTOR
5.0 (83.3%). Improved document alignment qual-
ity is based on various new features: ratio of
shared links, similarity of link URLs, ratio of
shared images, binary feature indicating if the doc-
uments are linked, and similarity of URLs, in ad-
dition to the old features bag of words similarity
using a translation dictionary and DOM structure
similarity.

UFAL (Le et al., 2016) submitted 4 systems,
each using a different method. UFAL-1 (81.3%)
uses identical word matches by also consider-
ing their position in the text. UFAL-2 (79.1%)
matches translations of French documents with
English documents based on word occurrence
probabilities. UFAL-3 (80.7%) adds Levenshtein
distance on URLs to this method. UFAL-4
(84.2%) combines UFAL-1 and UFAL-3.

MEDVED (Medved et al., 2016) submitted one
system (79.4%), which determines the top 100
keywords based on tf/idf scores for each document
and uses word translation dictionaries to match
them.

BADLUC (Jakubina and Langlais, 2016) sub-
mitted one system (79.3%) that uses the informa-
tion retrieval tool Apache Lucene to create two in-
dexes, on URLs and text content, and retrieves the
most similar documents based on variants of td/idf
scores. Both monolingual queries and bilingual
queries based on a word translation dictionary are

performed.
ADAPT (Lohar et al., 2016) submitted one sys-

tem (and a revision) that combines similarity met-
rics computed on ratio of number of sentences in
documents, ratio of number of words in the docu-
ments, and matched named entities.

JIS (Mahata et al., 2016) submitted one system
(2.0%), which uses text matching based on sen-
tence alignment and word dictionaries. Their pa-
per also described improvements over the original
submission.
