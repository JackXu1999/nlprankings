Abstract

This paper presents a cross-linguistic data
elicitation study on fully realised referring ex-
pressions (REs) in a dialogue context. A web-
based experiment was set up in which partici-
pants were asked to choose REs to be uttered
by one of two agents for identifying five tar-
gets in a scripted dialogue. Participants were
told that the agent would point at the referents
while uttering their chosen linguistic descrip-
tions. The study was conducted in English,
Japanese, Portuguese and Dutch and yielded
a total of 1190 referring expressions. Our
hypotheses concern sets of objects that need
to be considered for identification depending
on the effect of the pointing gesture. Re-
sults show interesting and significant differ-
ences between the language groups.

1 Introduction

Generation of referring expressions (GRE) has been
a central task in Natural Language Generation for
many years, and numerous algorithms which auto-
matically produce referring expressions (REs) have
been developed (Gardent, 2002; Krahmer et al.,
2003; Jordan and Walker, 2005; Van Deemter,
2006). Existing GRE algorithms generally assume
that both speaker and addressee have access to the
same information. In most cases this information is
represented by a knowledge base that contains the
objects and their properties present in the domain of
conversation in terms of attribute-value pairs. A typ-
ical algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) takes as input
an object or a set of objects (Van Deemter, 2002), the

target referent of the description, and a set of distrac-
tors from which the target needs to be distinguished.
The task of a GRE algorithm is to determine which
set of properties is required to single out the target
from the distractors.

Much of the work on GRE focusses on the use
of REs in the English language. However, in recent
years, other languages have attracted increased in-
terest (Funakoshi et al., 2006; Pareira and Paraboni,
2008; Spanger et al., 2009; Theune et al., 2010).
In this paper we present a cross-linguistic study
on human production of REs in English, Japanese,
Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The study orig-
inated from a project in which the perception of
multimodal REs was studied in a virtual world in
a Japanese and an English-speaking setting (Van der
Sluis and Luz, 2011; Van der Sluis et al., to appear).
In the present paper, the materials from a produc-
tion study initially conducted for Japanese to vali-
date our Japanese translation of a dialogue written
in English, have been translated and further adapted
to Dutch and Portuguese. We draw on the results of
this study to analyse how well different languages
match a typical GRE algorithm that uses a list of
preferred properties, such as the algorithm proposed
by Dale and Reiter (1995).

The REs considered in this study are part of a
scripted dialogue between two agents in a furniture
sales setting. The study focusses on ‘first-mention’
REs that identify objects that have not been talked
about earlier in the discourse. In the dialogue the
furniture seller agent refers to objects in the domain
by uttering each scripted RE combined with a point-
ing gesture directed to the target. Since human com-

53



munication includes gestures as well as language
various algorithms for the generation of such mul-
timodal REs have been proposed (André and Rist,
1996; Kranstedt et al., 2006; Van der Sluis and Krah-
mer, 2007). Interestingly, we know from other stud-
ies (Piwek, 2009; Van der Sluis and Krahmer, 2007)
that the use of pointing gestures can have a particular
influence on the REs in that they reduce the distrac-
tor set such that often less properties are needed to
uniquely distinguish the target. In this paper we test
two hypotheses about the composition of the distrac-
tor set.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the materials and setting of the study, Sec-
tion 3 presents our hypotheses and our evaluation
method, Section 4 details the results, Section 5 dis-
cusses the findings and Section 6 concludes the pa-
per.

2 Production Study

2.1 Setting: Dialogue and REs

A dialogue script was written by hand for two agents
in a furniture store. Figure 1 presents a schematic
layout of the furniture shop marking the positions of
the agents and the furniture items. The shop con-
tains 26 objects of which 14 were used as target ref-
erents, the others were used as distractors. The di-
alogue consists of 19 utterances and features a con-
versation between a female agent purchasing furni-
ture for her office, and a male shop owner describing
some furniture items that she could consider for her
purposes. Results from a pilot study used for val-
idation of the dialogue and the setting showed that
the dialogue was acceptable to an English speaking
audience (Breitfuss et al., 2009).

The dialogue was used as a template in which
five first-mention REs could be varied. The REs
used to fill out these slots were chosen carefully to
cover various aspects of REs currently studied in the
GRE literature. These aspects include: (1) cardi-
nality, the REs targeted three singular objects and
two larger sets of items; (2) locative expressions,
the REs included three absolute locative expressions
and two relative locative expressions; and (3) the po-
sition of the referent. The targets were distributed in
the domain of conversation such that one referent
was located near to the stationary agents, two refer-

ents were located far away from the agents, and two
sets of referents were located somewhere in between
those two extremes.

Figure 1 shows 14 furniture items that are used
for assessing multimodal GRE output: (1) a large
red chair (bottom left); (2) a large blue desk (top
left), (3) a small blue desk (next to the large one);
(4) a set of five large red chairs (in the middle), and
(5) a set of six small green chairs (next to the set of
reds), as well as a number of distractors (greyed-out
items). We stipulated that the agents would stay sta-
tionary at the position indicated in Figure 1 and point
in the direction where the targets can be found. The
targets can be described with the attributes usually
considered in GRE research (i.e. type, colour, size,
location) and were realised as follows:

• RE1: large red chair in the front of the shop
• RE2: large blue desk in the back of the shop
• RE3: small blue desk next to it (where ‘it’ refers to

the target of RE2)
• RE4: large red chairs in the middle of the shop
• RE5: small green chairs next to the red ones

The dialogue was translated to Japanese, Brazil-
ian Portuguese and Dutch such that the dialogue
was adapted to the normative, communicative and
inferential rules of the respective cultures but the
REs were as close to the English originals as pos-
sible. The translations and localisations for Por-
tuguese and Dutch followed a similar pattern as the
process for Japanese described in (Van der Sluis and
Luz, 2011). Validation of the translated dialogues
was conducted by three native speakers in the re-
spective languages and revisions were made accord-
ingly.

the DE-boxes marked (d) and (e), and RE-boxes marked
(4) and (5).

2.2 Materials

The study was conducted over the Web and con-
sisted of three pages. The first page presented a tu-
torial in which the participants were told about the
goals of the study, what they were going to see on
the next page, and what they would be asked to do.
The second page is shown in Figure 2. At the top
of the screen a picture of the domain was presented.
The bottom part of the screen contained the dialogue
through which the participants could scroll and se-
lect the REs they preferred from a set of options, all
of which were simultaneously available to the par-
ticipant while reading the sentence. The picture of
the domain was always visible on the top part of the
screen. The five REs of interest were each presented
with two boxes as illustrated by, for instance, the
items marked (e) and (5) in Figure 2: the DE-box,
in which participants could select a determiner or
demonstrative and the RE-box, in which combina-
tions of properties could be chosen.

The RE-box contained seven possible REs in
which the inclusion of colour, size and location were
varied; all REs contained the relevant value for type

as a noun. For instance, in the case of RE2 the op-
tions would be ‘large desk’, ‘blue desk’, ‘desk in the
back’, ‘large blue desk’, ‘large desk in the back’,
‘blue desk in the back’ and ‘large blue desk in the
back’. After each RE-box, it was indicated that the
agent’s utterance of the RE would be combined with
a pointing gesture in the direction of the target. The
DE-box offered a number of options to compose de-
ictic expressions in line with the determiners avail-
able in the respective languages. We refer to (Luz
and van der Sluis, 2011) for our analysis of the de-
terminers that were collected with this study. The
third page of our study consisted of a “thank you”
note and information about a prize draw, as a reward
for participating in the study. All materials used in
this study were fully translated into the languages
considered.

3 Hypotheses

Because we study the perception of REs by present-
ing them to potential users in their own language and
localised contexts (i.e. a context adapted to the nor-
mative, communicative and inferential rules of their
cultural background) we used null hypothesis signif-
icance testing. In other words, our null hypotheses
are that participants do not differ in their preferences
dependent on their cultural background. If signifi-
cant differences are observed, we can regard these
differences as evidence towards alternative hypothe-
ses.

The hypotheses for the REs to be selected by the
participants are based on findings from cognitive lin-
guistics (Pechmann, 1989; Arts et al., 2010) that
show that absolute properties (e.g. colour) are pre-
ferred over relative properties (e.g. size). Follow-
ing Krahmer and Theune (2002) we expect locative
expressions to be even less preferred than relative
properties. In our set up we presented the discourse
domain including the agents that featured in the di-
alogue in a two-dimensional fashion. However, we
asked the participants to imagine that the furniture
seller agent included a pointing gesture to accom-
pany the linguistic descriptions to refer to the targets.
Hence we asked participants to imagine the distin-
guishing effect that this pointing gesture would have
in a three-dimensional environment. As we cannot
be sure about the scope of these pointing gestures in

55



the minds of the participants and their effect on the
distractor set on which the participants based their
choice of RE, we decided to test two hypotheses,
which are summarised in Table 1.

Table 1: Expected REs for referents RE1 to RE5 for two
hypotheses H1 and H2 on the content of the REs.

Target H1: Whole domain H2: Gesture scope
RE1 colour, location colour
RE2 colour, size colour, size
RE3 colour, size colour, size
RE4 colour, location colour
RE5 colour, location colour

Our first hypothesis, H1, is that participants in our
study will consider all distractors in the domain as
depicted in Figure 2 for each RE (i.e., the pointing
gesture has no effect, it does not rule out any distrac-
tors). Accordingly, for RE1 we expect that partici-
pants will first include colour to rule out all objects
in the domain that are not red. For RE1, size will not
remove any distractors, but we expect that location
will be included to rule out the group of red chairs
in the middle of the shop. For RE2, we expect that
colour will be selected to rule out all objects that are
not blue. Secondly, size will be added to remove the
remaining smaller blue desk and thereby empty the
set of distractors. For RE3, we expect participants to
include colour to rule out all distractors that are not
blue and add size to rule out the large blue desk and
thereby uniquely distinguish the target of RE3. RE4
will be distinguishing by first adding colour to rule
out all objects that are not red. Then location will
be added to remove the only remaining distractor,
that is the singular red chair in the front of the shop.
RE5 is expected to include colour, which leaves only
green distractors, and location to remove the singu-
lar green chair on the left-hand side of the domain.

Our second hypothesis, H2, is that participants
only consider the set of distractors located in the
scope of the pointing gesture performed by the agent
to distinguish the target. For all five targets we ten-
tatively defined the scope of the pointing gestures as
depicted in Figure 3, where the areas covered by the
pointing gestures are of the same size, but differ in
terms of the covered areas that include the target in
the centre of the gesture’s scope. Note, however, that
the participants in our study were not provided with

these gesture scopes, they had to imagine the effect
of the gesture themselves. Accordingly, their repre-
sentation might have been different from the scopes
presented in Figure 3. For the sake of illustration, we
define the set of distractors as including all objects
that are located fully or partly within the projected
lines that indicate the scope of the gesture. For all
five REs we assume that the algorithm first adds a
pointing gesture to the RE which results in a de-
crease of the number of distractors. For all five REs,
however, inclusion of the pointing gestures does not
result in distinguishing REs and participants are still
expected to add linguistic properties to identify the
targets uniquely. For RE1, colour should be added
to empty the distractor set (i.e. the pointing gesture
had already ruled out the group of red chairs in the
middle of the shop). For RE2, colour and size are ex-
pected to be included; the pointing gesture’s scope
has decreased the target set but still includes some
objects with a different colour as well as the smaller
blue desk. RE3 also requires colour and size to re-
spectively rule out the objects in the gesture’s scope
that are not blue as well as the large blue desk. Both
RE4 and RE5 require colour to remove the remain-
ing distractors located in the scope of the respective
pointing gestures.

the scope of the pointing gestures produced by the Seller
agent to accompany the REs R1 to R5.

3.1 Evaluation Metric

To test our hypotheses, H1 to H2, we compared the
participants’ choices with the realised output of a
typical GRE algorithm that uses a preferred attribute

56



list alike the algorithm proposed by (Dale and Reiter,
1995) that mimics human preferences (i.e. [colour,
size, location]). We chose the Dice coefficient as our
evaluation metric, which accounts for a degree of
overlap between two descriptions. Dice computes
the degree of similarity between two sets by scal-
ing the number of attributes that the two descriptions
have in common, by the overall size of the two sets:

dice(Ha, R) =
2× |Ha ∩R|
|Ha|+ |R|

(1)

where Ha is the set of attributes in the description
produced by a human author, and R the set of at-
tributes in the reference description generated by the
algorithm. Dice yields a value between 0 (no agree-
ment) and 1 (perfect agreement). The attributes are
chosen from a set A = {c, s, l}, denoting colour,
size and location, respectively, so that possible Ha
will be elements of A = 2A \ ∅. We summarise the
Dice scores by their expected values for a particular
object. That is, we report the mean scores weighted
according to the probability pa that a combination of
attributes a ∈ A is chosen, as set out in equation (2).

E[dice(H,R)] =
∑

a∈A
pa × dice(Ha, R) (2)

For comparison, we computed a baseline score (B)
where pa is a uniform distribution (i.e. all feature
combination choices are equally likely) as a special
case of (2) that is: B = 1/7

∑
a∈A dice(Ha, R)

The ‘perfect recall percentage’, (PRP), that is the
proportion of times the hypotheses match the partic-
ipants’ choices exactly, is also reported.

4 Results

4.1 Participants

The address (URL) for the study was distributed
through sending invitations for participation by
email. Participants included 54 native speakers
of Japanese (female: 26%(14), male: 74%(40)),
91 native speakers of English (female: 60%(55),
male: 40%(36)), 42 native speakers of Brazilian Por-
tuguese (female: 60%(25), male: 40% (17)) and 51
native speakers of Dutch (female: 55%(28), male:
45%(23)). Table 2 summarises the characteristics of
the participants that took part in our study.

4.2 Referring Expressions

Table 3 presents the REs that were selected by the
participants in our study per language group. As
regards which RE was chosen by the majority of
each language group we find that for RE1, ‘large
red chair in the front’, speakers of Portuguese and
Dutch agree in their selection of colour and loca-
tion. In contrast, Japanese participants largely pre-
ferred the RE including only colour and English par-
ticipants preferred to include all available proper-
ties in the description. For RE2, ‘large blue desk
in the back’, a majority in all four language groups
chooses to include all available properties. For RE3,
‘small blue desk next to it’, the majorities of the four
language groups also agree and select a description
that includes size and location (note that this is not
a possible algorithmic output when we assume the
proposed preference order in the current domain).
However, for RE3, the Japanese data presents a tie,
indicating that an equally large group of participants
selected all available properties to distinguish the
target. For RE4, ‘large red chairs in the middle’,
Japanese and Portuguese speaking participants team
up with a majority vote for inclusion of only colour,
while both English and Dutch participants prefer
colour and location. Finally, for RE5, ‘small green
chairs next to the red ones’, the Japanese and Por-
tuguese speakers again agree with a majority vote
for colour, while Dutch participants select colour
and size and English speakers prefer to include all
available properties to refer to the target.

Per language group we find that the majority of
the Japanese participants chose an RE that only in-
clude colour for RE1, RE4 and RE5 (all between
40 and 50%). For RE2 and RE3 the Japanese
majority chose to include all available properties.
The English participants show different preferences,
namely including all available properties in RE1,
RE2 and RE5, size and location for RE3, and for
RE4 colour and location. Speakers of Portuguese
and Dutch present more variability. Portuguese
speakers select only colour for RE4 and RE5, while
the majority prefers different descriptions for RE1,
RE2 and RE3. The majority of Dutch speakers
chooses colour and location for RE1 and RE4 and
prefers various descriptions for RE2, RE3 and RE4.

4.3 Distractor Sets

Table 4 displays the Dice scores for the collected
data and our baseline per hypotheses per language
group computed for the REs for which the hypothe-

ses rendered different output (i.e. RE1, RE4 and
RE5). Recall that H1 predicts that participants
would take all objects in the domain into account
as distractors when selecting their preferred descrip-

58



tion, while H2 predicts that participants would only
consider the objects located in the scope of the
pointing gesture that would accompany the linguis-
tic description. Except for the Japanese data for
RE1 and RE5 on H1, all Dice scores seem well
above the baseline. This reinforces that for all three
REs the figures show that the choice of the speak-
ers of Japanese matches H2 best, while the other
three languages match better with H1. T-tests at the
p < .05 level comparing the Dice scores per RE per
language show significant differences for the col-
lected English REs for the targets of all three REs
(RE1 t=8.786, RE4 t=8.805 and RE5 t=3.574). For
Japanese REs significant differences were found for
the targets of RE1 and RE5 (RE1 t=3.046 and RE5
t=5.177). The Dutch data displayed significant dif-
ferences for RE1 and RE4 (RE1 t=6.137 and RE4
t=8.058). Differences between the Dice scores for
the Portuguese data are not significant.

gesture), per RE (RE1, RE4 and RE5) that were
found through a multivariate ANOVA with posthoc
Tukey’s HSD tests. For RE1, ‘large red chair in
the front’ the REs from the Japanese speakers sig-
nificantly differed from all three other languages,
indicating that the collected Brazilian Portuguese,
English and Dutch REs better match H1 than the
Japanese REs. For RE5 we also found a significant
difference between the Japanese and the Portuguese
group for H1. Results further show that for all REs
the choices of the Japanese group differed signifi-
cantly from the choices of the English group when
comparing the Dice scores for hypothesis H2, indi-
cating that H2 was a significantly better match for
the REs selected by the participants in the Japanese
group than the REs selected by the English group.
For RE4, the Japanese REs also differed from the
Dutch ones for H2.

Overall, we found significant effects between lan-
guages. RE1, large red chair in the front, showed
such an effect for H1 (F(3,234)=11.903, MSE=.554
p <.001) and H2 (F(3,234)=3.482, MSE=.280
p <.05). RE4, ‘large red chairs in the middle’, only
for H2 (F(3,234)=7.563, MSE=.280 p <.05), and
RE5,‘small green chairs next to the red ones’, for
H1 (F(3,234)=2.954, MSE=.143 p <.001) and H2
(F(3,234)=4.867, MSE=.438 p <.01).

5 Summary and Discussion

The REs collected with our web experiment display
many differences between the four language groups

59



included in our study. Most notably is the fact
that the majority of Japanese participants preferred
shorter descriptions than the majorities of the partic-
ipants in the other language groups. Especially, the
Japanese majority chose only to include the property
colour in the object descriptions RE1, RE4 and RE5,
while the majorities of the English and Dutch partic-
ipants also chose location and sometimes size. Inter-
estingly, the Portuguese speakers, like the Japanese,
chose only colour for RE4 and RE5.

For RE2, ‘large blue desk in the back’, the ma-
jorities of all four language groups agreed in select-
ing all available properties for the RE. This might be
explained by the fact that the focus in the dialogue
shifted from a furniture item in the front of the shop
(i.e. the large red chair in the front located near to
the agents) to the back of the shop (i.e. far away
from the agents). Note that the target of RE3, ‘small
blue desk next to it’ was equally far away from the
agents as the target of RE2. However, when the tar-
get of RE3 is discussed in the script, the focus of
attention was already in the back area of the shop.

As regards our hypotheses, we found that the REs
selected by the Japanese participants best matched
H2, indicating that they considered a reduced dis-
tractor set in composing their REs due to the scope
of the accompanying pointing gesture. In contrast,
the REs selected by the participants in the other lan-
guage groups better matched H1, stating that people
would consider all objects in the conversation do-
main as distractors when identifying targets.

We also found various significant differences be-
tween the Dice means of the four language groups
per RE, indicating that Japanese speakers employ
different strategies in composing REs than partici-
pants in the English, Dutch and Portuguese groups.

The fact that the Japanese participants in our study
are predominantly male (74%) may have been a po-
tential confounding factor in our results. As men are
known to be less verbal than women, the reported ef-
fect could be a gender rather than a language effect.
We ran a separate statistical analysis on gender ef-
fects on our Japanese data. It turned out that gender
affected the use of the location attribute with t=3.05
at the p < .05 level indicating that Japanese fe-
males used location more often than Japanese males
(in 57% and 36% of REs, respectively). Comparing
the hypotheses H1 and H2 per object with respect

to gender, Japanese males had a significant prefer-
ence for H2 over H1 for RE1 (mean Dice scores 75%
vs. 60%, t=2.38, p < .05) while Japanese females
exhibited no clear preference (57% vs 58%, non-
signif). Both genders preferred H2 for RE5 (56%
vs 73% for males and 68% vs 82% for females,
p < .05. There was no gender effect with respect
to RE4. Further studies are required to investigate
gender across different languages.

Another reason for the effects we observed in our
study may be related to differences in the use of
pointing gestures in the languages we considered.
For instance, (Kita and Özürek, 2003) showed dif-
ferences in gesturing between English and Japanese
speakers (not about pointing though), and it is con-
ceivable that the observed language differences are
caused by gesture differences. In future work it
would be interesting to add a condition to the exper-
iment in which pointing gestures are not included.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper has presented a cross-linguistic study of
the production of REs by native speakers of English,
Japanese, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese, which
displayed many significant differences between the
language groups. These differences were related to
the set of distractors that was taken into account,
which was hypothesised to be influenced by the ef-
fect of pointing gestures that accompanied the REs.
One limitation of this study is clearly that the point-
ing gestures to accompany the linguistic descriptions
were scripted and the effect of those gestures in the
minds of the participants could only be assumed.
Instead of linguistically described pointing gestures,
animations of pointing gestures may be more effec-
tive for deriving the effect of pointing on a linguistic
description. We refer to (Van der Sluis et al., to ap-
pear) for an attempt in this direction.

Another limitation is that only five predefined re-
alisations of REs were used to elicit object descrip-
tions from the participants. The REs, however, were
carefully chosen as to reflect on issues currently be-
ing studied in GRE. The situated and life-like dia-
logue that was used in the study, specially in terms
of focus shifts, might also have influenced the par-
ticipants’ choice of REs. In addition, perhaps over-
hearer effects to do with attention and engagement

60



may have played a role. However, with our with
‘static’ study we have not attempted to mimic an in-
teractive, real-time situation.

Upon completing their choices participants were
offered the opportunity to enter free-form comments
in a text box. From the participants’ comments we
know that people were positively engaged in the
study. Some participants, however, indeed criticised
the limited choice of descriptive attributes and their
suitability for the sales domain. While the criticism
is valid, our choice of REs was based on previous
work on RE generation where the furniture domain
is used very often (i.e., through the COCONUT cor-
pus (Di Eugenio et al., 2000) and the TUNA corpus
(Van Deemter et al., To Appear)).

In summary, although limited in terms of expres-
siveness, the range of attributes available allowed
us to identify general differences in RE production
styles between the languages. With inspecting al-
most 1200 REs, we can conclude that a typical GRE
algorithm that uses a well established preference or-
der does not match the human production of multi-
modal REs for all languages and further studies are
necessary to inform the design of GRE algorithms
that can be employed in multilingual, multimodal
and interactive environments.
