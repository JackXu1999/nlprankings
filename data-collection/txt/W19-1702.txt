Abstract

Prosodic cues in conversational speech aid lis-
teners in discerning a message. We investi-
gate whether acoustic cues in spoken dialogue
can be used to identify the importance of in-
dividual words to the meaning of a conversa-
tion turn. Individuals who are Deaf and Hard
of Hearing often rely on real-time captions in
live meetings. Word error rate, a traditional
metric for evaluating automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR), fails to capture that some words
are more important for a system to transcribe
correctly than others. We present and evaluate
neural architectures that use acoustic features
for 3-class word importance prediction. Our
model performs competitively against state-of-
the-art text-based word-importance prediction
models, and it demonstrates particular benefits
when operating on imperfect ASR output.

1 Introduction

Not all words are equally important to the meaning
of a spoken message. Identifying the importance
of words is useful for a variety of tasks includ-
ing text classification and summarization (Hong
and Nenkova, 2014; Yih et al., 2007). Consider-
ing the relative importance of words can also be
valuable when evaluating the quality of output of
an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for
specific tasks, such as caption generation for Deaf
and Hard of Hearing (DHH) participants in spoken
meetings (Kafle and Huenerfauth, 2017).

As described by Berke et al. (2018), inter-
locutors may submit audio of individual utterances
through a mobile device to a remote ASR sys-
tem, with the text output appearing on an app for
DHH users. With ASR being applied to new tasks
such as this, it is increasingly important to eval-
uate ASR output effectively. Traditional Word
Error Rate (WER)-based evaluation assumes that
all word transcription errors equally impact the

biguate without prosody. The intended sentence struc-
ture was: Right! Where you move from?

quality of the ASR output for a user. However,
this is less helpful for various applications (Mc-
Cowan et al., 2004; Morris et al., 2004). In par-
ticular, Kafle and Huenerfauth (2017) found that
metrics with differential weighting of errors based
on word importance correlate better with human
judgment than WER does for the automatic cap-
tioning task. However, prior models based on text
features for word importance identification (Kafle
and Huenerfauth, 2018; Sheikh et al., 2016) face
challenges when applied to conversational speech:

• Difference from Formal Texts: Unlike for-
mal texts, conversational transcripts may lack
capitalization or punctuation, use informal
grammatical structures, or contain disfluen-
cies (e.g. incomplete words or edits, hes-
itations, repetitions), filler words, or more
frequent out-of-vocabulary (and invented)
words (McKeown et al., 2005).

• Availability and Reliability: Text transcripts
of spoken conversations require a human
transcriptionist or an ASR system, but ASR
transcription is not always reliable or even
feasible, especially for noisy environments,
nonstandard language use, or low-resource
languages, etc.

While spoken messages include prosodic cues
that focus a listener’s attention on the most im-
portant parts of the message (Frazier et al., 2006),



10

such information may be omitted from a text tran-
script, as in Figure 1, in which the speaker pauses
after “right” (suggesting a boundary) and uses
rising intonation on “from” (suggesting a ques-
tion). Moreover, there are application scenarios
where transcripts of spoken messages are not al-
ways available or fully reliable. In such cases,
models based on a speech signal (without a text
transcript) might be preferred.

With this motivation, we investigate modeling
acoustic-prosodic cues for predicting the impor-
tance of words to the meaning of a spoken dia-
logue. Our goal is to explore the versatility of
speech-based (text-independent) features for word
importance modeling. In this work, we frame the
task of word importance prediction as sequence
labeling and utilize a bi-directional Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural architecture
for context modeling on speech.

2 Related Work

Many researchers have considered how to iden-
tify the importance of a word and have pro-
posed methods for this task. Popular meth-
ods include frequency-based unsupervised mea-
sures of importance, such as Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and word
co-occurrence measures (HaCohen-Kerner et al.,
2005; Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004), which are pri-
marily used for extracting relevant keywords from
text documents. Other supervised measures of
word importance have been proposed (Liu et al.,
2011, 2004; Hulth, 2003; Sheeba and Vivekanan-
dan, 2012; Kafle and Huenerfauth, 2018) for var-
ious applications. Closest to our current work,
researchers in (Kafle and Huenerfauth, 2018) de-
scribed a neural network-based model for cap-
turing the importance of a word at the sentence
level. Their setup differed from traditional im-
portance estimation strategies for document-level
keyword-extraction, which had treated each word
as a term in a document such that all words iden-
tified by a term received a uniform importance
score, without regard to context. Similar to our
application use-case, the model proposed by Kafle
and Huenerfauth (2018) identified word impor-
tance at a more granular level, i.e. sentence- or
utterance-level. However, their model operated on
human-generated transcripts of text. Since we fo-
cus on real-time captioning applications, we pre-
fer a model that can operate without such human-

produced transcripts, as discussed in Section 1.
Previous researchers have modeled prosodic

cues in speech for various applications (Tran et al.,
2017; Brenier et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2009). For
instance, in automatic prominence detection, re-
searchers predict regions of speech with relatively
more spoken stress (Wang and Narayanan, 2007;
Brenier et al., 2005; Tamburini, 2003). Identifi-
cation of prominence aids automatically identify-
ing content words (Wang and Narayanan, 2007),
a crucial sub-task of spoken language understand-
ing (Beckman and Venditti, 2000; Mishra et al.,
2012). Moreover, researchers have investigated
modeling prosodic patterns in spoken messages
to identify syntactic relationships among words
(Price et al., 1991; Tran et al., 2017). In partic-
ular, Tran et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of
speech-based features in improving the constituent
parsing of conversational speech texts. In other
work, researchers investigated prosodic events to
identify important segments in speech, useful for
producing a generic summary of the recordings of
meetings (Xie et al., 2009; Murray et al., 2005).
At the same time, prosodic cues are also challeng-
ing in that they serve a range of linguistic func-
tions and convey affect. We investigate models ap-
plied to spoken messages at a dialogue-turn level,
for predicting the importance of words for under-
standing an utterance.

3 Word Importance Prediction

For the task of word importance prediction, we
formulate a sequence labeling architecture that
takes as input a spoken dialogue turn utterance
with word-level timestamps1, and assigns an im-
portance label to every spoken word in the turn
using a bi-directional LSTM architecture (Huang
et al., 2015; Lample et al., 2016).

ht = LSTM(st,

−−→
ht−1) (1)

←−
ht = LSTM(st,

←−−
ht−1) (2)

The word-level timestamp information is used
to generate an acoustic-prosodic representation for
each word (st) from the speech signal. Two LSTM
units, moving in opposite directions through these

speech-based feature for word importance, we currently make
use of high-quality human-annotated word-level timestamp
information in our train/evaluation corpus; in the future,
speech tokenization could be automated.

Figure 2: Architecture for feature representation of spoken words using time series speech data. For each spoken
word (w) identified by a word-level timestamp, a fixed-length interval window (τ ) slides through to get n =
time(w)/τ sub-word interval segments. Using an RNN network, a word-level feature (s), represented by a fixed-
length vector, is extracted using the features from a variable-length sub-word sequence.

word units (st) in an utterance, are then used
for constructing a context-aware representation for
every word. Each LSTM unit takes as input the
representation of the word (st), along with the hid-
den state from the previous time step, and each
outputs a new hidden state. At each time step,
the hidden representations from both LSTMs are
concatenated ht = [

−→
ht ;
←−
ht ], in order to obtain a

contextualized representation for each word. This
representation is next passed through a projection
layer (details below) to the final prediction for a
word.

3.1 Importance as Ordinal Classification

We define word importance prediction as the task
of classifying the words into one of the many
importance classes, e.g., high importance (HI),
medium importance (MID) and low importance
(LOW) (details on Section 5). These importance
class labels have a natural ordering such that
the cost of misclassification is not uniform e.g.,
incorrect classification of HI class for LI class
(or vice-versa) will have higher error cost than
classification of HI class for MI. Considering this
ordinal nature of the importance class labels, we
investigate three different projection layers for
output prediction: a softmax layer for making
local importance prediction (SOFTMAX), a relaxed
softmax tailored for ordinal classification (ORD),
and a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF)
for making a conditioned decision on the whole
sequence.

Softmax Layer. For the SOFTMAX-layer, the
model predicts a normalized distribution over all

possible labels (L) for every word conditioned on
the hidden vector (ht).

Relaxed Softmax Layer. In contrast, the ORD-
layer uses a standard sigmoid projection for ev-
ery output label candidate, without subjecting it
to normalization. The intuition is that rather than
learning to predict one label per word, the model
predicts multiple labels. For a word with label
l ∈ L, all other labels ordinally less than l are
also predicted. Both the softmax and the relaxed-
softmax models are trained to minimize the cate-
gorical cross-entropy, which is equivalent to min-
imizing the negative log-probability of the correct
labels. However, they differ in how they make the
final prediction: Unlike the SOFTMAX layer which
considers the most probable label for prediction,
the ORD-layer uses a special “scanning” strategy
(Cheng et al., 2008) – where for each word, the
candidate labels are scanned from low to high (or-
dinal rank), until the score from a label is smaller
than a threshold (usually 0.5) or no labels remain.
The last scanned label with score greater than the
threshold is selected as the output.

CRF Layer. The CRF-layer explores the possible
dependence between the subsequent importance
label of words. With this architecture, the network
looks for the most optimal path through all possi-
ble label sequences to make the prediction. The
model is then optimized by maximizing the score
of the correct sequence of labels, while minimiz-
ing the possibility of all other possible sequences.
Considering each of these different projection lay-
ers, we investigate different models for the word
importance prediction task. Section 4 describes



12

our architecture for acoustic-prosodic feature rep-
resentation at the word level, and Sections 5 and
6 describe our experimental setup and subsequent
evaluations.

4 Acoustic-Prosodic Feature
Representation

Similar to familiar feature-vector representations
of words in a text e.g., word2vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), various
researchers have investigated vector representa-
tions of words based on speech. In addition to cap-
turing acoustic-phonetic properties of speech (He
et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2016), some recent work
on acoustic embeddings has investigated encoding
semantic properties of a word directly from speech
(Chung and Glass, 2018). In a similar way, our
work investigates a speech-based feature represen-
tation strategy that considers prosodic features of
speech at a sub-word level, to learn a word-level
representation for the task of importance predic-
tion in spoken dialogue.

4.1 Sub-word Feature Extraction

We examined four categories of features that have
been previously considered in computational mod-
els of prosody, including: pitch-related features
(10), energy features (11), voicing features (3) and
spoken-lexical features (6):

• Pitch (FREQ) and Energy (ENG) Features:
Pitch and energy features have been found effec-
tive for modeling intonation and detecting em-
phasized regions of speech (Brenier et al., 2005).
From the pitch and energy contours of the speech,
we extracted: minimum, time of minimum, max-
imum, time of maximum, mean, median, range,
slope, standard deviation and skewness. We
also extracted RMS energy from a mid-range
frequency band (500-2000 Hz), which has been
shown to be useful for detecting prominence of
syllables in speech (Tamburini, 2003).

• Spoken-lexical Features (LEX): We examined
spoken-lexical features, including word-level spo-
ken language features such as duration of the spo-
ken word, the position of the word in the utter-
ance, and duration of silence before the word. We
also estimated the number of syllables spoken in
a word, using the methodology of De Jong and
Wempe (2009). Further, we considered the per-
word average syllable duration and the per-word

articulation rate of the speaker (number of sylla-
bles per second).

• Voicing Features (VOC): As a measure of voice
quality, we investigated spectral-tilt, which is rep-
resented as (H1 - H2), i.e. the difference between
the amplitudes of the first harmonic (H1) and the
second harmonic (H2) in the Fourier Spectrum.
The spectral-tilt measure has been shown to be ef-
fective in characterizing glottal constriction (Keat-
ing and Esposito, 2006), which is important in dis-
tinguishing voicing characteristics, e.g. whisper
(Ito et al., 2002). We also exmined other voic-
ing measures, e.g. Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio and
Voiced Unvoiced Ratio.

In total, we extracted 30 features using Praat
(Boersma, 2006), as listed above. Further, we
included speaker-normalized (ZNORM) version of
the features. Thereby, we had a total of 60 speech-
based features extracted from sub-word units.

4.2 Sub-word to Word-level Representation

The acoustic features listed above were extracted
from a 50-ms sliding window over each word re-
gion with a 10-ms overlap. In our model, each
word was represented as a sequence of these sub-
word features with varying lengths, as shown in
Figure 2. To get a feature representation for a
word, we utilized a bi-directional Recurrent Neu-
ral Network (RNN) layer on top of the sub-word
features. The spoken-lexical features were then
concatenated to this word-level feature representa-
tion to get our final feature vectors. For this task,
we utilized Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho
et al., 2014) as our RNN cell, rather than LSTM
units, due to better performance observed during
our initial analysis.

5 Experimental Setup

We utilized a portion of the Switchboard corpus
(Godfrey et al., 1992) that had been manually an-
notated with word importance scores, as a part
of the Word Importance Annotation project (Kafle
and Huenerfauth, 2018). That annotation covers
25,048 utterances spoken by 44 different English
speakers, containing word-level timestamp infor-
mation along with a numeric score (in the range of
[0, 1]) assigned to each word from the speakers.
These numeric importance scores have three natu-
ral ordinal ranges [0 - 0.3), [0.3, 0.6), [0.6, 1] that
the annotators had used during the annotation to



13

indicate the importance of a word in understanding
an utterance. The ordinal range represents low im-
portance (LI), medium importance (MI) and high
importance (HI) of words, respectively.

Our models were trained and evaluated using
this data, treating the problem as a ordinal classifi-
cation problem with the labels ordered as (LI < MI
< HI). We created a 80%, 10% and 10% split of
our data for training, validation, and testing. The
prediction performance of our model was primar-
ily evaluated using the Root Mean Square (RMS)
measure, to account for the ordinal nature of la-
bels. Additionally, our evaluation includes F-score
and accuracy results to measure classification per-
formance. As our baseline, we used various text-
based importance prediction models trained and
evaluated on the same data split, as described in
Section 6.3.

For training, we explored various architectural
parameters to find the best-working setup for our
models: Our input layer of GRU-cells, used as
word-based speech representation, had a dimen-
sion of 64. The LSTM units, used for generating
contextualized representation of a spoken word,
had a dimension of 128. We used the Adam op-
timizer with an initialized learning rate of 0.001
for training. Each training batch had a maximum
of 20 dialogue-turn utterances, and the model was
trained until no improvement was observed in 7
consecutive iterations.

6 Experiments

Tables 1, 2 and 3 summarize the performance of
our models on the word importance prediction
task. The performance scores reported in the ta-
bles are the average performance across 5 different
trials, to account for possible bias due to random
initialization of the model.

6.1 Comparison of the Projection Layers

We compared the efficacy of the learning archi-
tecture’s three projection layers (Section 3.1) by
training them separately and comparing their per-
formance on the test corpus. Table 1 summarizes
the results of this evaluation.

Results and Analysis: The LSTM-SOFTMAX-
based and LSTM-CRF-based projection layers had
nearly identical performance; however, in com-
parison, the LSTM-ORD model had better perfor-
mance with significantly lower RMS score than

Model ACC F1 RMS
LSTM-CRF 64.22 56.31 75.21
LSTM-SOFTMAX 65.66 57.34 74.08

forming scores highlighted in bold.

the other two models. This suggests the utility
of the ordinal constraint present in the ORD-based
model for word importance classification.

6.2 Ablation Study on Speech Features
To compare the effect of different categories of
speech features on the performance of our model,
we evaluated variations of the model by removing
one feature group at a time from the model during
training. Table 2 summarizes the results of the
experiment.

Model ACC F1 RMS

– ENG 62.24† 55.67† 71.14
– FREQ 63.25 57.30 69.0
– VOC 62.90 56.84 70.5
– LEX 63.37 57.34 71.49†

– ZNORM 62.04? 53.86? 72.0?

Table 2: Speech feature ablation study. The minus sign
indicates the feature group removed from the model
during training. Markers (? and †) indicate the biggest
and the second-biggest change in model performance
for each metric, respectively.

Results and Analysis: Omitting speaker-based
normalization (ZNORM) features and omitting
spoken-lexical features (LEX) resulted in the great-
est increase in the overall RMS error (+5.5% and
+4.8% relative increase in RMS respectively) –
suggesting the discriminative importance of these
features for word importance prediction. Further,
our results indicated the importance of energy-
based (ENG) features, which resulted in a substan-
tial drop (-2.4% relative decrease) in accuracy of
the model.

6.3 Comparison with the Text-based Models
In this analysis, we compare our best-performing
speech-based model with a state-of-the-art word-
prediction model based on text features; this prior
text-based model did not utilize any acoustic or
prosodic information about the speech signal. The



14

baseline text-based word importance prediction
model used in our analysis is described in Kafle
and Huenerfauth (2018), and it uses pre-trained
word embeddings and bi-direction LSTM units,
with a CRF layer on top, to make a prediction for
each word.

As discussed in Section 1, human transcriptions
are difficult to obtain in some applications, e.g.
real-time conversational settings. Realistically,
text-based models need to rely on ASR systems
for transcription, which will contain some errors.
Thus, we compare our speech-based model and
this prior text-based model on two different types
of transcripts: manually generated or ASR gen-
erated. We processed the original speech record-
ing for each segment of the corpus with an ASR
system to produce an automatic transcription. To
simulate different word error rate (WER) levels in
the transcript, we also artificially injected the orig-
inal speech recording with white-noise and then
processed it again with our ASR system. Specif-
ically, we utilized Google Cloud Speech2 ASR
with WER≈ 25% on our test data (without the
addition of noise) and WER≈ 30% after noise
was inserted. Given our interest in generating au-
tomatic captions for DHH users in a live meet-
ing on a turn-by-turn basis (Section 1), we pro-
vided the ASR system with the recording for each
dialogue-turn individually, which may partially
explain these somewhat high WER scores.

The automatically generated transcripts were
then aligned with the reference transcript to com-
pare the importance scores. Insertion errors auto-
matically received a label of low importance (LI).
The WER for each ASR system was computed by
performing a word-to-word comparison, without
any pre-processing (e.g., removal of filler words).

Model ACC F1 RMS
speech-based 63.72 57.58 68.21
text-based 77.81 73.6 54.0

+ WER: 0.25 72.30 69.04 65.15
+ WER: 0.30 71.84 67.71 68.55

Table 3: Comparison of our speech-based model with a
prior text-based model, under different word error rate
conditions.

Result and Analysis: Given the significant lexical
information available for the text-based model, it
would be natural to expect that it would achieve

2https://cloud.google.com/Speech_API

higher scores than would a model based only
on acoustic-prosodic features. As expected, Ta-
ble 3 reveals that when operating on perfect
human-generated transcripts (with zero recogni-
tion errors), the text-based model outperformed
our speech-based model. However, when oper-
ating on ASR transcripts (including recognition
errors), the speech-based models were competi-
tive in performance with the text-based models.
In particular, prior work has found that WER
of ≈ 30% is typical for modern ASR in many
real-world settings or without good-quality micro-
phones (Lasecki et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2017).
When operating on such ASR output, the RMS er-
ror of the speech-based model and the text-based
model were comparable.

7 Conclusion

Motivated by recent work on evaluating the accu-
racy of automatic speech recognition systems for
real-time captioning for Deaf and Hard of Hear-
ing (DHH) users (Kafle and Huenerfauth, 2018),
we investigated how to predict the importance of a
word to the overall meaning of a spoken conversa-
tion turn. In contrast to prior work, which had de-
pended on text-based features, we have proposed
a neural architecture for modeling prosodic cues
in spoken messages, for predicting word impor-
tance. Our text-independent speech model had an
F-score of 56 in a 3-class word importance classi-
fication task. Although a text-based model utiliz-
ing pre-trained word representation had better per-
formance, acquisition of accurate speech conver-
sation text-transcripts is impractical for some ap-
plications. When utilizing popular ASR systems
to automatically generate speech transcripts as in-
put for text-based models, we found that model
performance decreased significantly. Given this
potential we observed for acoustic-prosodic fea-
tures to predict word importance continued work
involves combining both text- and speech-based
features for the task of word importance predic-
tion.
