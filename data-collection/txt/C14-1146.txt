Invited Speaker Abstract

Adaptation technologies are always useful in NLP when there is discrepancy between the training sce-
nario and use scenario. They are also effective in alleviating the data scarcity problem. Domain adapta-
tion is the most popular kind of adaptation technologies and is intensively researched. In this talk we will
introduce two other kinds of adaptation technologies: annotation adaptation and language adaptation.
Annotation adaptation is used to improve the performance of an automatic annotation task by leveraging
corpora with different annotation schemas, while language adaptation is used to solve an NLP problem
in one language by utilizing the linguistic knowledge which is learnt from solving the same problem
in another language. We investigate these technologies mainly for the tasks of word segmentation and
parsing, however similar technologies may be developed for other NLP tasks also.
