Abstract 

This article proposes a Universal Dependency Annotation Scheme for Mandarin Chinese, including POS 
tags and dependency analysis. We identify cases of idiosyncrasy of Mandarin Chinese that are difficult 
to fit into the current schema which has mainly been based on the descriptions of various Indo-European 
languages. We discuss differences between our scheme and those of the Stanford Chinese Dependencies 
and the Chinese Dependency Treebank. 

1 Introduction 

At a time when dependency syntax is quasi-hegemonic in natural language processing (NLP), 
dependency treebank construction was until recently solely based on translating existing phrase-
structure-based resources into dependencies (e.g., the Penn Treebank and the Stanford Dependency 
Parser; de Marneffe, MacCartney, & Manning, 2006), performed in the computer science departments, 
often in very applied perspectives. Only recently, the re-emergence of dependency-based linguistics put 
into question the syntactic principles underlying treebank construction. Although dependency 
annotation seems to be more consensual than based on phrase-structure analyses (possibly due to the 
lighter annotation without non-terminals or traces), different schools foster different annotation 
standards. For example the Prague Dependency Treebank (Böhmová, Hajič, Hajičová, & Hladká, 2003) 
is based on theoretical works of the Prague team (Sgall, Hajicová, & Panevová, 1986) and the Spanish 
MTT treebank (Mille, Vidal, Barga, & Wanner, 2009) is based on Mel’čuk’s Meaning-Text Theory 
(1988). The annotation schemes differ mainly in the placement and number of different layers of 
annotation (semantics vs. deep-syntax vs. surface-syntax).  

The Universal Dependencies (UD) project (de Marneffe et al., 2014; Nivre et al., 2016a) constitutes 
an important homogenization effort to synthesize ideas and experiences from different dependency 
treebanks in different languages, with the aim of facilitating multilingual research on syntax and parsing 
by proposing a unified annotation scheme for all languages. Up to the current version of UD (1.3)—
which has released annotated data in 40 languages (Nivre et al., 2016b)—the proposed structure has 
been unique (no separate semantic or surface-syntactic annotation1). The scheme has triggered some 
debate on the syntactic foundation of some choices that have been made (Osborne, 2015), in particular 
because UD does not rely on one theoretical framework and some of the proposed goals are necessarily 
contradictory: syntactic correctness, applicability of the schemes for NLP tools and purposes, and above 
all universality (similarity of structures across languages) cannot all be fulfilled at the same time (Gerdes 
& Kahane, 2016). Although no separate explicit annotation scheme exists for most UD treebanks, 
universality seems to outweigh other considerations. 

This paper describes similar choices in our adoption of UD for Mandarin Chinese, but we will try to 
be explicit about the advantages and disadvantages of the choices we made. The gaps and problems we 
describe show more generally that syntactic category and function sets that were originally created for 
Indo-European languages need important changes and careful balancing of criteria to foster 
typologically different languages, so that the distinctions become truly universal as intended. Some of

these problems can be solved by a greater universality of the vocabulary to describe the syntactic 
distinctions. Some idiosyncrasies simply do not have a satisfying and universal description. 

The article starts out with a brief overview of existing dependency annotation schemes for Mandarin 
Chinese and how they compare overall to the UD scheme. We describe a few of the Mandarin POS tag 
choices of our scheme in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the important features of our dependency 
annotation scheme and the sub-types of dependency relations we introduce. 

2 Dependency schemes for Mandarin Chinese 

Two widely used dependency schemes for Mandarin Chinese are Stanford Dependencies (SD) for 
Chinese (hereafter Stanford Chinese), developed by Huihsen Tseng and Pi-Chuan Chang (see Chang, 
2009; Chang, Tseng, Jurafsky, & Manning, 2009), and the Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT) 
developed by the Harbin Institute of Technology Research Center for Social Computing and Information 
Retrieval (see Che, Li, & Liu, 2012; HIT-SCIR, 2010; Zhang, Zhang, Che, & Liu, 2012). Stanford 
Chinese adopts its part-of-speech (POS) tagset directly from the Chinese Treebank (CTB) currently 
maintained at Brandeis University (Xue et al., 2013), also previously known as the Penn Chinese 
Treebank (hereafter Penn Chinese). 

We have adapted the first version of Universal Dependencies (UD) for Mandarin Chinese (hereafter 
Mandarin UD) with reference to these two dependency schemes as well as the POS system of Penn 
Chinese. While we have taken many elements primarily from Stanford Chinese and CTB/Penn Chinese, 
due to their closer relation and structure to UD as well as existing SD-to-UD transformation tools, we 
have also made some choices that differ from some traditional Chinese linguistics analyses which 
Stanford Chinese and CDT follow. We will discuss these differences in detail in subsequent sections. 

At the macroscopic level, our implementation of Mandarin UD differs from the other two dependency 
schemes in the division of labor between POS tags and relations, summarized in Table 1. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

Table 1: Summary comparison of dependency schemes 
 
The much smaller set of POS tags in Mandarin UD, albeit due to UD restriction, is compensated by a 
greater number of dependency relations, under the tenant of avoiding redundancy in annotating 
grammatical structures in both layers of labels. While Stanford Chinese has the highest amount of such 
redundancy among the three schemes, CDT takes the opposite approach of simplifying both the POS 
tags and dependency relations. Collapsing CDT’s 8 noun POS categories into just two (nouns and proper 
nouns), CDT would have only three more POS tags than Mandarin UD. However, CDT differs from SD 
and UD in its goal of being compatible with logical semantic representation (Zhang et al., 2014). On the 
other hand, UD was created as a successor to SD, which was initially created to represent English syntax 
only (de Marneffe et al., 2014). UD was crucially created for multilingual research on syntax and parsing 
(Nivre et al., 2016a), hence its emphasis on cross-linguistic compatibility and rules regarding how each 
language should adopt it. 

In the next two sections, we discuss some of the more salient examples that illustrate the issues we 
encountered in developing Mandarin UD. 

3 Parts-of-speech annotation 

Mandarin UD uses all of UD’s 17 parts-of-speech (UDPOS) tags (Nivre et al., 2016a). We adopt heavily 
from the Penn Chinese Treebank POS system (Xia, 2000b) but differ from it in a few places, since UD’s 
tagset is smaller and does not correspond neatly to all of Penn Chinese’s tags. Since UD does not allow 
sub-typing of POS tags or language-specific tags, we adhere to this restriction. Below we discuss issues 
in adapting UDPOS for Mandarin with regard to predicate adjectives, localizers, and classifiers.

3.1 Predicate adjectives 

In Chinese grammar what can be considered adjectives include two word classes, the non-predicate 
adjectives also known as區別詞 qūbiécí, and the predicate adjectives also known as形容詞 xíngróngcí. 
The non-predicate adjectives can only occur as prenominal modifiers. However, the predicate adjectives, 
despite its name, can occur both as a prenominal modifier (1a-b) and as a predicate (1c). When acting 
as a predicate, they are essentially intransitive stative verbs. When multisyllabic predicate adjectives act 
as prenominal modifiers, the particle的 de is required (1b). 
 

(1a)   好 花 
      hǎo huā  
      good flower 
      ‘good flower’ 

(1b)  美麗 的 花 
     měilì de huā  
     beautiful DE flower 
     ‘beautiful flower’ 

(1c)  那 花 很 好  
     nà huā hěn hǎo  
     that flower very good 
     ‘that flower is good’  

 
While Penn Chinese treats predicate adjectives as a type of verb (‘VA’) separate from the nominal 
modifier (‘JJ’), we group them together as CDT does with the non-predicate adjectives as ‘ADJ’, and 
treat the particle的 de as an adjectival marker in this case (such as in (1b)). The advantage of shuffling 
this subclass of verbs is that we are able to separate the intransitive stative uses of the predicate verbs 
from other verbs, since UD does not allow one to create subcategorical POS tags. Additionally, the 
modifier and predicate uses of predicate verbs are easily differentiated from each other simply by 
looking at their head in the dependency representation. Since the decision to tag predicate adjectives as 
ADJ is also supported in other languages such as in the Japanese implementation of UD (Tanaka et al., 
2016), we consider our categorization to be more advantageous for cross-linguistic comparison. 

3.2 Localizers 

This class of words is known in Chinese linguistic literature as方位詞 fāngwèicí. They come after a 
noun and primarily indicate spatial information in relation to the noun (with grammaticized uses for 
temporal and other abstract concepts of location), and are often additionally paired with the preposition
在 zài. Examples include 上 shàng ‘above’, 中 zhōng ‘middle’, 外 wài ‘outside’, 前 qián ‘front’, 旁
páng ‘side’, among others. Both Penn Chinese and CDT give localizers a unique tag—‘LC’ for 
‘localizer’ (2a) and ‘nd’ for ‘direction noun’ (2b), respectively.  
 
 (2a)  Stanford Chinese   (2b)  CDT   (2c)  Mandarin UD 

 

  zài  shānyāo               jiān         
 at  mountain.waist  between 
 ‘on the mountainside’ 
 
Although localizers historically derive from nouns, they no longer have the same syntactic distribution 
of regular nouns and are rather limited in their usage in providing spatial information to another noun.  
While CDT categorizes them as nouns and Penn Chinese appears semi-agnostic in giving them a unique 
tag, we treat them as postpositions after early research (Peyraube, 1980; Ernst, 1988) as well as recent 
research (Djamouri, Waltraud, & Whitman, 2013; Waltraud, 2015), the latter of which take into account 
historical Chinese data as well as cross-linguistic observations, notably German which also has both 
prepositions and postpositions. Therefore we tag them as ADP, as adpositions (2c). 

3.3 Classifiers 

Classifiers are an indispensable lexical category in Mandarin as well as many East Asian and Southeast 
Asian languages. In Mandarin, they are often obligatorily present with a numeral modifying a  

22



noun (3)2. Often they are also the head of a nominal phrase when a regular noun is not present (4). They 
differ from nouns in that classifiers can be preceded by numerals in all syntactic contexts, but nouns can 
only be preceded by numerals without an intervening classifier in exceptional cases. Additionally, 
attributive adjectives can never immediately precede or modify a classifier, but they do so with nouns, 
so that a noun phrase involving all three must have the order classifier-adjective-noun (5). It is likely 
due to the unique syntactic distribution of classifiers that both Penn Chinese and CDT give them unique 
POS tags―‘M’ for ‘measure word’ and ‘q’ for ‘quantity’, respectively. 
 
 (3)   (4)      (5) 

 ‘a ball of fire’   ‘which one’ (room, store, etc.)   ‘two black cats’ 
 
Nonetheless, due to the classifiers’ partially similar syntactic distribution (when acting as the head of a 
noun phrase) as well as close relation to nouns―with analogy to measure words in languages such as 
English (e.g., a head of cattle) and Danish (e.g., en kop kaffe ‘a cup of coffee’)―we decided to place 
them under the tag NOUN, since UDPOS prohibits language-specific tags. We also considered PART 
(‘particle’), but this would conflate classifiers with function words that cannot function as heads.  

The distinction between regular nouns and classifiers is currently preserved with the dependency 
relation nmod:clf, which is used to label a classifier when it precedes a noun (3, 5). However, the 
distinction is lost when the classifier is the head of a noun phrase (4). We are not currently implementing 
features in our Mandarin UD, but a NounType feature may be a future consideration. We are also in 
discussion with the UD community in order to include this widely neglected category in the upcoming 
UD 2.0 specifications. 

4 Syntax annotation 

Our adoption of UD for Mandarin Chinese has presented a number of syntactic challenges, some of 
which are due to particular constructions whose analyses are controversial or under-researched, and 
some are due to what might be insufficiencies in the UD design itself. We discuss some of these issues 
in the subsections below.  

We use 39 of the 40 dependency relations available in UD as laid out in Nivre et al. (2016), leaving 
out expl since expletives do not exist in Mandarin, and additionally propose 18 language-specific 
dependency relations as permitted by UD, shown in Table 2.  
 

Label Description 
acl:irrealis ‘irrealis descriptive clause’ 
acl:realis ‘realis descriptive clause’ 
advcl:purpose ‘adverbial purpose clause’ 
advmod:df ‘duration & frequency adverbial 

modifiers’ 
aux:aspect ‘aspect marker’ 
case:loc ‘localizer’ 
compound:dir ‘directional verb compound’ 
compound:der ‘descriptive/extent DE 

compound’ 
compound:ov ‘other verb compound’ 

 

Label Description 
discourse:sp ‘sentence particle’ 
dobj:light ‘direct object of light verb’ 
mark:dec ‘adjectival/complementizer/ 

nominalizer DE’ 
mark:dev ‘manner adverbializer DE’ 
nmod:agent ‘agent in long BEI phrase’ 
nmod:clf ‘classifier modifier’ 
nmod:dobj ‘direct object in BA phrase’ 
nmod:poss ‘possessive nominal modifier’ 
nmod:tmod ‘temporal nominal modifier’

4.1 Adpositional phrases 

One major systematic difference between UD and the previous SD (Stanford Dependencies) as well as 
CDT is in the treatment of adpositional phrases. Conforming to the SD system, Stanford Chinese treats 
all prepositions as well as postpositions as the head of adpositional phrases, with the nouns they 
introduce as their dependents. CDT employs the same treatment, as seen earlier in (2a-c) under the 
discussion of localizers in section 3.2. Since many of these adpositions also have grammaticized 
functions which introduce clauses instead of noun phrases, some clauses are also treated as dependents 
of these functions words in these schemes, illustrated in (6a-b) with a temporal adverbial clause marked 
by the clause-final後 hòu ‘after’ (grammaticized from the postposition後 hòu ‘behind’).  
 
  (6a)  Stanford Chinese        (6b)  CDT         (6c)  Mandarin UD 
  

   wǒmén chī    wán   fàn    hòu 
  we    eat  finish meal after 
  ‘After we finish eating...’ 
 
This approach of treating these function words as heads is abandoned in UD in favor of assigning heads 
to content words instead of function words (Nivre et al., 2016a). This not only means that the direction 
of the dependency relations for the above-mentioned function words are reversed in our implementation 
of Mandarin UD, as illustrated in (6a-c), but some of the head-child relations are also shifted, as 
illustrated in the earlier examples of localizers in (2a-c). 

In the case of (2a-c), our implementation unfortunately loses hierarchical information between the 
preposition and postposition because we treat them both as direct dependents of the noun (2c), in 
contrast to Stanford Chinese (2a) and CDT’s (2b) approaches that indicate the postpositional/localizer 
phrase is embedded in the prepositional phrase. However, our approach is necessary to meet the 
demands of the UD rubric in treating content words as governors of function words. 

4.2 Aspect particles 

There are three basic aspect particles in Mandarin: perfective了 le, durative着 zhe, and experiential過
guo. Although they are written as individual characters, they can be considered suffixes since they attach 
immediately after verbs and have lost their original tones, making them prosodically (as well as 
morphosyntactically) dependent. Etymologically they likely grammaticized from verbs but no longer 
retain any verbal characteristics (aside from conveying aspect). We propose the language-specific 
aux:aspect to link these particles to the verb (7).  
 
  (7) 

  ‘You’ve said it once before.’ 
 
These aspect markers fit well as a subcategory of the aux relation because that is the only relation 
whose associated tag AUX has a definitional mention of verbal marking including aspect (besides tense, 
mood, as well as person and number marking). However, UD specifies that the aux relation as well as 
the AUX tag are used only for auxiliary verbs, which seems to be problematic because verbal markers 

24



are not all verbs or verbal in origin cross-linguistically. Mandarin aspect particles/suffixes are neither 
auxiliary verbs nor verbs, but unlike inflectional elements in morphologically rich languages, we treat 
them as separate tokens. Nonetheless, not all verbal markers in all languages are affixes (for example, 
see Bickel and Nichols, 2013), so in those languages the unbound verbal markers should be treated as 
individual tokens and should not be marked as part of the word token. We therefore believe there is a 
gap in the UD schema and that the UD definition for aux (and AUX) may benefit from revision in order 
to take non-affixal, non-verb verbal markers into account.  

We have also considered using compound to link the aspect markers to the verb, but since this 
relation is used only for derivational or compositional structures rather than inflectional markers, it is 
not ideal, either. We tentatively annotate the aspect markers with aux:aspect, despite violation of 
the current UD definitions. 

4.3 Sentence-final particles 

Similar to classifiers, sentence-final particles are an areal feature across many East and Southeast Asian 
languages. They occur at the end of a sentence or utterance (8), and may have a wide variety of non-
referential meanings and functions that modify the entire sentence, including modality, speech register, 
“speaker/hearer orientation”, and other discourse and pragmatic uses. In Mandarin, these particles 
include 嗎 ma (interrogative), 了 le (new situation), 吧 ba (command/suggestion), 的 de (certainty), 
among others. They are integrated into the sentence they attach to as part of its prosodic contour with 
no pause in between. 

 
 (8)      

 ‘Then just let them steal.’ 
 
Although not all sentence-final particles have discourse functions, and more importantly they are very 
different from interjections, they seem to fit best as a sub-relation of discourse despite the fact that 
this relation is currently classified as a nominal dependent (of the main governor of a clause). We have 
also considered advmod, but the function and especially syntactic distribution of these particles are 
quite different from adverbs given that adverbs in Mandarin are usually preverbal and do not have a 
fixed syntactic position. We believe the lack of an obvious and natural space for these particles may be 
another possible gap in the UD schema. We tentatively propose discourse:sp for “sentence particle” 
to keep the name applicable cross-linguistically (for example, see Dryer, 2008, for varying positions of 
question particles across languages). 

4.4 Light verb constructions 

A number of verbs in Mandarin have semantically weakened and are used in combination with nouns 
to express new verbal concepts. A salient example is the verb打 dǎ, which as a main verb by itself has 
the meaning “to hit” or “to strike.” However, this meaning is no longer present, or only a vestige of it is 
retained, when the verb combines with nouns like 針 zhēn ‘needle’, 球 qiú ‘ball’, 電話 diànhuà 
‘telephone’: 打針 dǎzhēn ‘to get/give an injection’, 打球 dǎqiú ‘to play (a) ball (game)’, 打電話
dǎdiànhuà ‘to make a phone call’. 

Ordinarily, UD includes light verb constructions under compound, listing Persian and Japanese as 
examples of languages with these constructions. However, in Mandarin the verb-noun “compound” is 
not a tight unit. The aspect markers still attach directly after the verb before the noun, as do duration 
and frequency adverbial phrases (9). The verb can further compound itself (10). For this reason we 

25



propose dobj:light to link the noun to the verb since the noun still behaves like a direct object, and 
the dependency relation will enable a distinction between the light and full verb usages of the same 
Chinese character. 
 
 (9)      (10) 

 ‘Have gotten/given an injection a few times’ ‘After you finish playing ball’ 
 

4.5 Descriptive clauses   

Among the most difficult structures we encountered in implementing UD for Mandarin are descriptive 
clauses. Li & Thompson (1981) describe two related constructions of the sequence [NP1] + V1 + [NP2] 
+ V2 in which the second verb V2 (or the clause it heads) describes or comments on the second noun 
phrase NP2, and NP2 also serves as an object of the first verb V1. They refer to them as “realis” and 
“irrealis descriptive clauses” (pp. 611-620). For the realis kind, the clause headed by V2 describes 
something that is “in the here and now of the ‘real world’ ” (p. 612)―such as我很喜歡吃 wǒ hén xǐhuān 
chī ‘I very much enjoyed eating’ in (11). For the irrealis kind, the V2 clause describes “an unrealized 
event” which is “hypothetical or projected information” (p. 612), as shown by吃 chī ‘eat’ in (12). 
 
 (11) [他] 炒 了  [一  個  菜] (我 很  喜歡  吃)     (cf. Li & Thompson, 1981: 612) 
  tā   chǎo le     yí    gè    cài  wǒ hén xǐhuān chī 
  he fry PERF one CLF dish  I very like   eat   
  ‘He cooked a dish (that I very much enjoyed eating).’ realis descriptive clause 
 
 (12) [我] 找  [東西]  (吃) 
  wǒ  zhǎo dōngxǐ  chī 
  I   seek  thing  eat      
  ‘I’m looking for stuff (to eat).’    irrealis descriptive clause 
 
The fact that the clause headed by V2 is entirely optional in (11-12) (shown in parentheses), and that 
NP2 is not necessarily the subject of V2 (but an object of V2 in (12) and of a verb in an embedded 
clausal argument of V2 in (11)), sets these descriptive clauses apart from “pivotal constructions” (as 
described in Chao, 1968, and Li & Thompson, 1981). Pivotal constructions, as a type of control structure 
(specifically, object control), obligatorily requires the V2 clause as a clausal complement of V1, and the 
“pivot” NP2 must also be the subject of V2. For this reason, xcomp, the relation appropriate for pivotal 
constructions, is a bad fit for descriptive clauses. 

One possible analysis of these descriptive clauses is that they are clausal modifiers of NP2, given that 
they are descriptive of NP2, always involve a predicate, and are optional. This fits the definition of the 
relation acl (‘clausal modifier of noun’), in which case V2 would be an acl dependent of NP2 (13). 
However, this analysis goes against the fact that Chinese is typologically regarded as a language that is 
strictly head-final with regards to nouns. That is, in noun phrases the noun is always last and any 
modifiers of that noun must precede it. 

Li & Thompson suggests that the realis descriptive construction such as in (11) is biclausal, where 
V2 heads a separate clause that has a dropped argument (an object coreferential with NP2 in these cases 
of (11-12)). However, this structure has received very little attention in the literature (Peng, 2016), and 
no study known to us to date has proposed a detailed syntactic analysis which refutes or agrees with Li 
& Thompson’s hypothesis. Nonetheless, another option for us is to follow Li & Thompson in treating 

26



them as coordinated clauses with the conj relation linking V1 and V2 (14). Simplified diagrams in 
(13-14) illustrate the annotation differences between our two choices of acl and conj for realis 
descriptive clauses. 

 
  (13)   clausal modifier of noun (acl)  (14)   coordinated clauses (conj) 

 
While Peng’s (2016) comprehensive corpus study has brought realis descriptive clauses to the fore 

in recent years, much less research has been done on the irrealis ones. Li & Thompson themselves offer 
only several descriptive sentences on this structure, and the biclausal analysis for the realis constructions 
doesn’t fit the irrealis ones. Sentence (15) illustrates that the subject of V2 is not coreferential with any 
of the noun phrases within the sentence: 
 
  (15) [我] 有 [衣服] 要 洗    irrealis descriptive clause 
   wǒ  yǒu  yīfǔ   yào xǐ    
   I  have clothes need wash   
   ‘I have clothes that need to be washed.’   
 
In (15), the subject of the second verb is necessarily unspecified; whether the person who would 
hypothetically wash the clothes is intended to be the speaker herself or the addressee or some third party 
is completely arbitrary. Since subjects are only dropped in Mandarin if it can be understood 
pragmatically from previous context (Chao, 1968), the hypothesis that the second verb is part of an 
independent clause with a dropped subject is unlikely, and thus the conj relation would be 
inappropriate. 

The two similar constructions above, realis and irrealis descriptive clauses, occur very frequently in 
Chinese, as illustrated in Peng’s (2016) study of the realis descriptive constructions in particular, yet 
we have found no explicit mention in either Stanford Chinese or CDT on how to treat these structures.  

Since these two types of clauses share the function of providing additional descriptive information on 
NP2, we propose to keep them under the same category of relations and use acl:realis and 
acl:irrealis, which is preferable to splitting them apart between conj and acl. Creating the two 
language-specific relations for these structures will also allow for easier automatic conversion in the 
future for either only one of the clause types or both, should new research reveal that they should be 
analyzed differently. 

5 Conclusion and future work 

We have presented our attempt to adopt Universal Dependencies (UD) to Mandarin Chinese with 
consideration and reference to two other dependency schemes previously created for this language, 
illustrating some of the challenges and solutions we have encountered and made with regard to the 
morphosyntactic properties of Mandarin. Through these discussions we identified possible gaps in the 
current UD design, especially with regards to verbal markers and sentence particles that lie beyond the 
purview of adverbial modifiers and discourse markers. We also identified two common structures in 
Mandarin, the realis and irrealis descriptive clauses, that may have eluded analysis and explicit treatment 
in other Chinese treebank schemes.  

We are in the process of applying our proposed annotation scheme to the Mandarin Chinese text in a 
Cantonese-Mandarin Parallel Corpus (Lee, 2011) of over 8000 lines of text. We plan to develop 
Universal Dependencies for Cantonese as well, to enable comparative studies on the grammars of the 
two Chinese languages. Once the treebanks for Mandarin and Cantonese are finalized, we hope to 
release them as part of the UD project, to be made publicly available through its website 
(http://universaldependencies.org).
