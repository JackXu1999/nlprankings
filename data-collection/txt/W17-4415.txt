Abstract

Geolocation is the task of identifying a
social media user’s primary location, and
in natural language processing, there is a
growing literature on to what extent auto-
mated analysis of social media posts can
help. However, not all content features
are equally revealing of a user’s location.
In this paper, we evaluate nine name en-
tity (NE) types. Using various metrics,
we find that GEO-LOC, FACILITY and
SPORT-TEAM are more informative for
geolocation than other NE types. Using
these types, we improve geolocation accu-
racy and reduce distance error over various
famous text-based methods.

1 Introduction
Because social media such as Twitter are used in
both research and industry to monitor trends and
identify sudden changes in society, it is critical
to be able to locate social media users. In Twit-
ter, however, only about 1% of all tweets are geo-
tagged, and the location specified by users in their
profile is often noisy and unreliable (Cheng et al.,
2010).

Geolocation is the task of identifying users’
general or primary location, when this is not read-
ily available. Accurate geolocation can improve
scientific studies, as well as technologies such as
event detection, recommender systems, sentiment
analysis, and knowledge base population.

Since tweets contain at most 140 characters, ge-
olocation of individual tweets is rarely feasible.
Instead, most studies focus on predicting the pri-
mary location of a user by concatenating their en-
tire tweet history. While this provides more con-
text, it is still a noisy source with features of vary-
ing informativeness.

In this paper, we focus on named entities
(NEs), a particular rich source of information,
and investigate how much they can reveal about
a user’s primary location. Wing and Baldridge
(2014) showed lists of predictive features for
multiple cities, where we observe NEs among
the top 20 features. This is due to the in-
herent localization of many NEs. E.g., top
features for Los Angeles contain NEs such as
names (Irvine, disneyland), parts of names
(diego , angeles), and abbreviations (UCLA,
SoCal (Southern California)). This observation
motivates us to examine nine common NE types
in social media, and their location predictiveness.
Additionally, we find that using only the top three
most informative types for geolocation improves
accuracy and reduces the median distance error.

Contributions We study (1) the geographical
informativeness of nine named entity types, and
(2) explore their effect in a logistic regression
model of text-based geolocation. Among the pre-
vious top text-based models, we obtain the best
performance using the hidden location informa-
tion of the top three NE types. This suggests that
users who would like to maintain privacy should
avoid using such names.

2 Related Work
Most previous studies use textual features as in-
put. Some use KL divergence between the dis-
tribution of a users words and the words used in
each region (Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Roller
et al., 2012), regional topic distributions (Eisen-
stein et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2013; Hong
et al., 2012), or feature selection/weighting to find
words indicative of location (Priedhorsky et al.,
2014; Han et al., 2012, 2014; Wing and Baldridge,
2014).

All these studies require relatively large training
sets to fit the models, and can be heavily biased by

major events during the time of collection, such as
an election or a disaster. In contrast to our work,
most do not consider multi-word NEs.

Only few text-based studies consider NEs, and
if so, focus on location names using gazetteers
like GeoNames, limiting the methods to the com-
pleteness of these gazetteers. Since they usu-
ally also use other text-based models, it is hard
to determine how much location names con-
tribute. These approaches depend on a name-
disambiguation phase, using Wikipedia, DBPedia,
or OpenStreetMap, since location names can refer
to multiple locations (Brunsting et al., 2016).

Chi et al. (2016) explicitly study the contribu-
tions of city and country names, hashtags, and
user mentionings, to geolocation. Their results
suggested that a combination of city and country
names, as well as hashtags, are good location pre-
dictors. Pavalanathan and Eisenstein (2015) sug-
gest that non-standard words are more location-
specific, and also, more likely to occur in geo-
tagged tweets. In contrast to this paper, none of the
previous works study how much various NE types
reveal about the user location. Similarly, Salehi
and Søgaard (2017) evaluate common hypotheses
about language and location. However, they do not
explicitly study named entities.

3 Resources
Data We use the WORLD dataset (Han et al.,
2012), which covers 3,709 cities worldwide and
consists of tweets from 1.4M users. Han et al.
(2012) hold out 10,000 users as development and
10,000 as test set. For each user with at least 10
geotagged tweets, the user’s location is set to be
the city in which the majority of their tweets are
from. We also use Han et al. (2012)’s method
to extract the nearest city to a given latitude-
longitude coordinate.

NER We use TwitterNLP (Ritter et al., 2011) to
extract the nine most common NE types in Twitter.
Table 1 shows the percentage of users in our train-
ing data who use at least one NE in their tweets.
Overall, 55% of the users use at least one NE, with
PERSON, GEO-LOC and FACILITY as the most
popular types.

Twitter corpus In order to measure the geo-
graphical diversity of NEs, we construct a cor-
pus from tweets posted one week before the
WORLD dataset was collected (14 Sep, 2011 to
20 Sep, 2011). We remove all non-English and
non-geo-tagged tweets from this corpus. This
leaves us with 0.5M tweets. This corpus cov-
ers 167 countries and 2263 cities/regions around
the world.1 The most frequent countries are
USA, Great Britain, Indonesia, Canada, Malaysia,
Philippine and Australia, and the most frequent
cities are London, Los Angeles, Chicago, Man-
hattan, Atlanta, Jakarta and Singapore. Using this
corpus, we obtain the distribution of NEs over the
cities of the world.

4 NE types and Geolocation
In Table 1, we have seen the general distribu-
tion of NE types, with PERSON, GEO-LOC and
FACILITY as top three. In this section, we fo-
cus on the predictiveness of NEs (as features) for
geolocation. Later, in Section 5, we will propose
a method to improve geolocation by putting more
emphasis on the top NEs and their hidden location
information.

We conduct three experiments to quantify pre-
dictiveness of NEs. In the first, we measure the
geographic distribution of each NE type, and mea-
sure their entropy. In the second experiment, we
conduct feature selection via randomized logistic
regression, and, in the third experiment, we es-
tablish a baseline by using majority classes for all
types.

Geographic diversity We first measure the ge-
ographic distribution of each type. We extract all
NEs in the WORLD training set and use the Tweet
corpus to measure entropy and mean pairwise dis-
tance (in kilometers) between tweets that contain
the same NEs. We compute unpredictability as en-
tropy:

H(x) = −

cities/regions based on Han et al. (2012).

where the entropy of NE x is measured by com-
puting P (xi), which is the probability that x is re-
ferring to the ith city/country, based on the fre-
quency. We measure the entropy in both city and
country level, shown in Table 2.

For example, suppose CMU is found in four
tweets from Pittsburgh and one from San Fran-
cisco, and IBM is found in one tweet each from
Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Melbourne, and New
York. In this case, the entropy for CMU will be
lower than for IBM. This would indicate that IBM
is less predictive than CMU for geolocation. To
compute the entropy of an NE type, we average
over the entropies of all NEs of that type.

The first three columns of Table 2 show that
GEO-LOC and FACILITY are the least diverse
location-wise. NEs of type PERSON are the most
frequent NEs (see Table 1), and occur in more di-
verse locations. On the other hand, NEs of type
SPORT-TEAM, the least frequent NEs, have low
location diversity. PRODUCT and COMPANY are
the least predictive types.

Feature evaluation In our second experiment,
we use L1 randomized logistic regression (Ng,
2004) on the training set to get the most predictive
features. It measures how often a feature is pre-
dictive under varying conditions, by fitting hun-
dreds of L1-regularized models on subsets of the
data. Each feature is assigned a weight between
0 and 1 based on their predictiveness. For exam-
ple, the weights for countries and city names are
high (on average 0.831) showing that they are very
predictive. Yet, some examples of features with
zero weight are web, today and t.v. showing that
these features are not predictive at all. Table 2 (un-
der LR column) shows the resulting prevalence for
each type. These are compatible with the previous
two metrics, showing GEO-LOC, FACILITY and

Majority Vote Accuracy In the third experi-
ment, we measure accuracy and distance error
(in kilometers) using majority voting for each
NE on the Tweet corpus. E.g., if we see CMU
in four tweets from Pittsburgh and one tweet
from San Francisco, we label the user’s location
as Pittsburgh. Figure 1 shows the percent-
age of the test set with a distance error from
the true location less than K kilometers (also
known as ACC@K). The three top types are
again GEO-LOC, FACILITY and SPORT-TEAM,
showing their higher impact on revealing the loca-
tion of users.

5 NE Impact on Geolocation
Having established the informativeness of the var-
ious NE types, in this section, we examine the im-
pact of NEs and their hidden location information
for geolocation. To extract the hidden location
information of each NE, we collect the locations
of all tweets in our tweet corpus that contain that

NE. To divide the world into regions with roughly
the same number of users, we use a k-d tree ap-
proach proposed by Roller et al. (2012). As a re-
sult, we will cover larger regions when the popu-
lation density is low and vice versa. Each region
is then considered as a label to train the classi-
fiers. The approach of using k-d tree is also used in
Rahimi et al. (2015); Han et al. (2012) and Wing
and Baldridge (2014).

See Table 3 for an example of the following
methods. All use logistic regression as classifier,
following Rahimi et al. (2015).

Baseline We use (Rahimi et al., 2015)’s bag-of-
words model over tweets as baseline, which is also
the state-of-the-art text-based method on the pub-
licly available WORLD dataset.

Baseline without NE Here, we remove all NEs,
to observe the influence of NEs in the bag-of-
words model.

Only NEs In this approach, we consider only
NEs and discard all other words in the tweets.

Our method We consider NEs and their inher-
ent location information in addition to the bag-of-
words model. The inherent location information
for each NE is extracted from our Twitter corpus.2

Suppose, for example, that Eiffel tower is found in
four tweets from Paris and two tweets from Las
Vegas. In this case, we add Paris (four times)
and Las Vegas (twice) to the input text. The

lection of tweets posted one week before the WORLD dataset

repetition is used to put more emphasis/weight
based on frequency.3 In order to measure the ef-
fectiveness of the three top NE types discovered in
Section 4, we experiment with (1) considering all
NE types (shown as Our MethodallNEs in Table
4), and (2) the three most useful types (shown as
Our Methodtop3).

Evaluation metrics We use the same evalua-
tion metrics as previous studies: accuracy depend-
ing on location granularity (city and country), ac-
curacy within the distance of 100 miles/161km
(ACC@161)4, and median and mean error (in
kilometers).

6 Results and Discussion

The results of applying each of the methods in-
troduced in Section 5 are shown in Table 4. The
baseline follows Rahimi et al. (2015), but does not
use network information, to isolate the effect of
NEs. They also add additional data, whereas we
only consider the WORLD training set to be com-
parable with Wing and Baldridge (2014) and Han
et al. (2012). Our baseline results are therefore
lower than what Rahimi et al. (2015) report. Using
only NEs results in a large performance drop with
respect to the baseline. However, ignoring NEs
(baseline-NE) also decreases the geolocation pre-
dictability by 15% (city level), indicating the im-
portance of NEs in revealing the location of users.

Our proposed method, using all NE types

to their entropy, but we found repetition to perform better.

according to their hidden location information,
comes close, but does not improve over the
baseline. However, when we consider only the
top three NE types (GEO-LOC,FACILITY and
SPORT-TEAM) from Section 4, performance in-
creases, indicating that other NE types add noisy
information.

Our error analysis shows that PERSON is
very frequent, yet diverse, including politi-
cians, athletes, and more general names. Since
SPORT-TEAM is one of the most indicative types,
we assume that athlete names can be useful as
well. We leave this aspect for future work.

7 Conclusion
We compare the predictiveness of various named
entity types for geolocation. We consider en-
tropy, pairwise distance, feature selection weights,
and the effect of the NEs on accuracy and er-
ror distance, and find that GEO-LOC, FACILITY
and SPORT-TEAM are more predictive of location
than other NE types.

Our results show that using the inherent local-
ized information of NEs can improve geolocation
accuracy. The results also suggest that users could
obfuscate geolocation by avoiding these types.
