Abstract 

According to the Menzerath-Altmann law, 

there is a relation between the size of the 

whole and the mean size of its parts. The va-

lidity of the law was demonstrated on rela-

tions between several language units, e.g., 

the longer a word, the shorter the syllables 

the word consists of. In this paper it is shown 

that the law is valid also in syntactic depend-

ency structure in Czech. In particular, longer 

clauses tend to be composed of shorter 

phrases (the size of a phrase is measured by 

the number of words it consists of). 

1 Introduction 

Some language properties can be considered a 

result of general mechanisms influencing hu-

man language behaviour. The mechanisms can 

be expressed by language laws which can have, 

in the ideal case, a form of a mathematic for-

mula. The mathematical formalization allows to 

test the validity of a law statistically, and, in ad-

dition, it opens a door towards building a the-

ory, i.e., a system of interconnected valid laws 

(see, e.g., Bunge, 1967; Altmann, 1978, 1993). 

In this paper, a particular instance of language 

laws, namely, the Menzerath-Altmann law 

(MAL hereafter) in syntactic dependency struc-

ture is scrutinized. The MAL (Cramer, 2005a) 

is, in general, a law expressing a mechanism 

which controls mutual relations between sizes 

of language units belonging to “neighbouring” 

language levels (e.g., between lengths of words 

and syllables, clauses and words, etc.), see Sec-

tion 2 for details. Our aim is to test the validity 

of the MAL in syntactic dependency structure; 

namely, we hypothesize that the relation be-

tween the size of the clause and the mean size 

of its parts (i.e., phrases; for details, see Section 

3) follows the MAL. If the hypothesis is corrob-

orated, syntactic dependency structure can be 

included among other linguistic “domains” 

which are substantially influenced by the very 

general mechanism expressed by the MAL. 

Consequently, in such a case the general status 

of the MAL in language is confirmed (and 

strengthened), and some fundamental proper-

ties of syntactic dependency structure can be 

seen (and possibly explained) from a new point 

of view. 

The article is organized as follows. The MAL 

is introduced in Section 2 (with some basic ex-

amples). Section 3 describes the methodology 

applied in this study. The language material 

from which data are extracted is presented in 

Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the results

achieved. Finally, the paper is concluded by 

Section 6, where also perspectives for future re-

search are pointed to. 

2 Menzerath-Altmann law 

The MAL speaks, in general, about the relation 

between sizes of a construct and its constituents. 

It is named after two linguists: Paul Menzerath, 

who observed length of German words and 

length of syllables which the words consist of, 

and Gabriel Altmann, who contributed to a sub-

stantial generalization of the law. 

The verbal formulation of the law changed 

over time. Its first version (the longer the word, 

the shorter syllables in the word, see Menzerath, 

1954) was a description of the relation between 

length of words and syllables. The current ver-

sion of the MAL (Altmann, 1980) is more gen-

eral, expressing a relation between sizes of two 

language units which are “neighbours” in the 

language unit hierarchy, such as syllables and 

words, sentences and clauses, etc. (the greater 

the whole the smaller its parts). We note that the 

hierarchy of the units is a nested structure1 (e.g., 

a sentence consists of clauses, which consist of 

words, which consist of syllables, which consist 

of phonemes2). Thus, one usually speaks about 

constructs and constituents (e.g., words and syl-

lables). Furthermore, the formulation of the 

MAL from Altmann (1980) is not so strict with 

respect to the monotonicity of the relations be-

tween lengths of a construct and its constituents. 

In some cases, constituent’s length does not 

achieve its maximum in constructs with length 

one, but its peak is shifted to the right. Hence, 

the MAL can be presented in its most general 

form as “the mean size of constituents is a func-

tion of the size of the construct”. 

The mathematical formula corresponding to 

the abovementioned general verbal expression 

of the MAL is 

(1)  𝑦(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥𝑏𝑒−𝑐𝑥,

1 In fact, there are several parallel nested structures. If 
word is taken as a construct, both syllables and morphemes 

can serve as its constituents; depending on whether one 

works directly with a written text or with its phonological 

or phonetic transcription, the size of a syllable can be 

measured in the number of graphemes, phonemes or 

sounds, etc. The choice of language units is conditioned by 

the technical tools available (e.g., a program for an auto-

matic syllabification), by the researcher’s aim, by the pos-

sibility to compare results with previous works, etc. 

with 𝑦(𝑥) being the mean size of constituents if 
the size of the construct is x; a, b, c are parame-

ters3. However, in many cases its special case of 

(1) for 𝑐 = 0, i.e., 
(2)  𝑦(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥𝑏,

fits data sufficiently well4. This special case de-

scribes a strictly decreasing trend of the constit-

uent size. The goodness of fit is usually evalu-

ated in terms of the determination coefficient R2 

(the higher 𝑅2, the better fit). It is defined as

𝑅2 = 1 −
∑ (𝑆𝑖−𝑦(𝑖))

2𝑛
𝑖=1

∑ (𝑆𝑖−�̅�)
2𝑛

𝑖=1

, 

where 𝑆𝑖 is the observed mean size of constitu-
ents for constructs of size i, 𝑆̅ is the mean of val-
ues 𝑆𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛, and 𝑦(𝑖) are theoretical
values from a model (which is given by (1) or 

(2) in this paper). A model is usually considered 

good enough if it achieves 𝑅2 ≥ 0.9, see Maču-
tek and Wimmer (2013). 

The validity of the MAL was corroborated on 

relations between pairs of several language 

units in many languages (language material 

from both dictionaries and texts was used, i.e., 

the MAL seems to be valid for both types and 

tokens). We mention several examples which 

cover relations among some traditional lan-

guage units5. Kelih (2010) investigated the rela-

tion between word length in syllables and sylla-

ble length in graphemes in Serbian. Gerlach 

(1982) chose word (in German) as the construct 

as well, but he measured word length in the 

number of morphemes (with morpheme length 

determined in the number of phonemes). Teu-

penhayn and Altmann (1984) showed that the 

MAL can be used also to describe the relation 

between sentence length (in clauses) and clause 

length (in words). An example of this relation, 

data from a German text together with a curve 

corresponding to the theoretical model of the 

MAL, can be seen in Figure 1. The data and the 

curve displayed in the figure can be considered 

typical for the MAL. 

2 One cannot a priori exclude the existence of some 
intermediate (maybe not so apparent) levels between 

the “traditional” ones, see the discussion in Section 5. 
3 Milička (2014) suggested an alternative mathemati-
cal model. 
4 Obviously, this special case of the MAL can be ap-
plied only under condition of a monotonous relation. 
5 See Altmann (2014) for a bibliography on the MAL.

clause lengths (y-axis) in a German text (Teu-

The data can be modelled by the simpler version 

of the MAL, i.e., by function (2). One obtains 

parameter values a = 11.571, b = -0.229. The 

determination coefficient for the model is 

R2= 0.9659, indicating thus a very good fit6. 

In general, the interpretation of the parame-

ters of the MAL remains an open question. 

While Köhler (1984) suggested a very general 

interpretation, and parameter values resulting 

from relations between different language units 

were presented by Cramer (2005b), a connec-

tion between the numerical values of the param-

eters, language levels from which the values 

arise, and the general theoretical framework 

(such as a supposed processing capacity, struc-

tural information, and similar considerations, 

see Köhler 1984) is still an unsolved problem7. 

3 Methodology 

The MAL predicts that there should be a sys-

tematic relation between the size of the clause 

and the size of its parts. As for the determination 

                                                           
6 The models in Sections 2 and 5 were fitted to the data by 
NLREG program. 
7 Another attempt to interpret the MAL – a modification 
of the ideas from the general approach suggested by Köh-

ler (1984) – can be found in Milička (2014).

documentation.html# clause 
9 We are aware that Tesnière (2015) used the term node 

(nœud in French); however, as the translators of his fa-

mous book notice, “[H]he first defines the node to be what 

modern theories of syntax take to be a phrase/constituent”, 

of the clause, one can find a (more or less) gen-

eral agreement among linguists about the char-

acter of this unit; e.g., Crystal (2008, p. 78) de-

fines the clause as “a unit of grammatical organ-

ization smaller than the sentence, but larger than 

phrases, words or morphemes”. According to 

the Prague Dependency Treebank annotation8, 

which is used for the analysis in this study (see 

Section 4 for a very brief description, and 

Lopatková et al., 2009, for more details), 

clauses “are grammatical units out of which 

complex sentences are built. A clause typically 

corresponds to a single proposition expressed 

by a finite verb and all its arguments and modi-

fiers (unless they constitute clauses of their 

own).”. Regarding the MAL, the clause repre-

sents the construct. 

It is less obvious how to determine parts of 

the clause which, in accordance to the theoreti-

cal background of the MAL (see Section 2), 

must be defined as its constituents. Following 

both the verb-centric character of dependency 

syntax traditionally used for Czech and the an-

notation of the Prague Dependency Treebank, 

we start with the assumption that the predicate 

represents the central element of the clause. 

Thus, the predicate is the highest unit of a hier-

archical structure of the clause (see, e.g., Figure 

2). Next, all phrases9 directly dependent on the 

predicate, i.e. all its arguments and modifiers, 

are considered constituents of the clause (in the 

sense of the MAL); see Figure 2 where directly 

dependent phrases are bounded by dashed 

boxes. Finally, the size of the constituent (i.e., 

the size of a phrase which is directly dependent 

on the predicate) is measured by the number of 

words which the phrase consists of10. 

For an illustration, let us take the clause 

My friend saw your sister from Pisa yesterday 

depicted in Figure 2. 

and “[H]his inconsistent use of the term is a source of con-

fusion” (Tesnière, 2015, Translators’ Introduction, p. xlv). 

We prefer the term phrase in the sense as it is used also by 

Meľčuk (1988) and Crystal (2008)  
10 We do not claim that this choice of the constituent is the 
only one possible, or the “right one” for clauses. In our 

opinion, it is quite probable that there are several “parallel” 

possibilities, analogous to the chains word – syllable – 

phoneme and word – morpheme – phoneme. Our approach 

is the first attempt to investigate the MAL in syntactic de-

pendency structure, and it can be hoped it will be followed 

by other studies which will open other views.

Figure 2. The hierarchical structure of the 

clause My friend saw your sister from Pisa yes-

terday. The dashed boxes represent phrases 

which are considered constructs of the clause. 

There are three phrases directly dependent on 

the predicate saw (see Figure 2):  

 

(Ph1) My friend;  

(Ph2) your sister from Pisa; 

(Ph3) yesterday. 

 

Thus, the size of the clause is three. Next, the 

mean constituent size in the clause is deter-

mined as an average of sizes of particular 

phrases. Specifically, phrase (Ph1) consists of 

two words, (Ph2) of four words, and (Ph3) of 

one word. The mean size of the phrase in the 

clause considered is  

(2 + 4 + 1) / 3 = 2.33. 

This procedure is applied to each clause in the 

corpus (with mean phrase length computed 

from all clauses with a particular length in the 

corpus, e.g., we took all phrases which occur in 

clauses with length one and evaluated their 

mean length, then all phrases occurring in 

clauses with length two, etc.). 

To sum up,  

a) the clause represents the construct;  
b) the size of the construct is determined by 

the number of phrases which are directly 

dependent on the predicate of the clause; 

each phrase represents a constituent of 

the clause; 

c) the size of the constituent (i.e., of the 
phrase) is determined by the number of 

its words. 

This approach satisfies the theoretical assump-

tion of the MAL – language units which are in 

the relation of a construct and a constituent 

(clause – phrase – word) are used for the analy-

sis. 

                                                           
11 In subordinate clauses, the predicate is not assigned by 
the analytical function “Predicate” but by a corresponding 

function of the subordinate clause (e.g., Attribute, Object, 

Subject). 

4 Language material 

In this study, dependency trees from the Prague 

Dependency Treebank 3.0 (Bejček et al., 2013; 

PDT 3.0 hereafter) were used; specifically, the 

data annotated on analytical lever (the treebank 

contains approximately 1.5 million words). Par-

ticular clauses from the corpus were determined 

in accordance with the annotation. Only main 

clauses were used for modelling because the an-

alytical function “Predicate” is assigned only to 

the predicate of the main clause in the PDT 

3.011. We used tokenized sentences (see Section 

3, Figure 2, for an example), with the tokeniza-

tion from the PDT 3.0 taken without any adap-

tation. Punctuation is not considered.  

Non-projective dependency trees were not 

filtered out. First, the (non-)projectivity of a de-

pendency tree is irrelevant with respect to the 

validity of the MAL for the data from a treebank 

as whole12. Clauses consist of phrases regard-

less of properties of their tree representations. 

Second, non-projective trees do not present 

technical problems, as the determination of the 

predicate and phrases which are directly de-

pendent on the predicate is not affected by the 

tree (non-)projectivity. Finally, crossings may 

be not so scarce as it is believed – it seems that 

they correlate with dependency length (the 

longer dependency length, the more crossings 

can be expected, see Ferrer-i-Cancho and 

Gómez-Rodríguez, 2016). A rejection of non-

projective trees could thus lead to an un-

derrepresentation of sentences with longer de-

pendency lengths. 

Because of the existence of technical nodes 

as well as specificities of the annotation in the 

PDT 3.0, we were forced to rearranged the orig-

inal annotation to some extent; the whole pro-

cedure of the adjustment of the original annota-

tion is described in detail in a technical report 

which is available online13. 

5 Results 

The results – mean lengths of phrases which oc-

cur in clauses of particular lengths – are pre-

sented in Table 1. Only those clause lengths 

which occur in the corpus at least ten times, i.e., 

12 The validity of the MAL in a subcorpus consisting ex-

clusively of non-projective trees is a different (albeit inter-

esting) question, see a short discussion in Section 6.

up to nine in our case, were analyzed (frequen-

cies of clause lengths measured in the number 

of phrases in the corpus used can be found in 

Table 1 as well). Remarks on an irregular be-

haviour of constituents of long constructs14 with 

low frequencies of occurrence can be found, 

e.g., in Kelih (2010), and in Mačutek and 

Rovenchak, (2011). The loss of data caused by 

neglecting longer clauses is minimal. We ana-

lyzed 56530 clauses from the corpus (see Sec-

tion 4), only 18 of them (i.e., approximately 

0.03%) consisted of more than nine phrases.

The relation can be modelled by the simpler 

form of the MAL (see Section 2), i.e., by func-

tion (2). The parameter values optimized with 

respect to the goodness of fit (expressed in 

terms of the determination coefficient) are 𝑎 =
8.96, 𝑏 = −0.62, with 𝑅2 = 0.9424. The 
model fits the data sufficiently well15 (see Sec-

tion 2). 

The tendency of the mean phrase length to 

decrease with the increasing clause length can 

clearly be seen in Figure 3, which depicts also 

the abovementioned function as the mathemati-

cal model for the MAL. We emphasize that the 

MAL – and all laws in linguistics, and all laws 

in empirical science in general – is of a stochas-

tic rather than deterministic character, hence 

some minor local disturbances in the overall de-

creasing trend are admissible. 

                                                           
14 It remains unclear whether the irregular behavior is 
caused only by low frequencies of long constructs, in 

which the mean length of constituents then has than a 

higher variance, or whether there are also other factors at 

play, which have only a negligible influence on short con-

structs. Admittedly, if one includes rarely occurring longer 

constructs, the fit usually becomes worse (which is true 

also for data considered in this paper).

mean phrase length (see Table 1), with function 

(2) fitted to the data. 

 

The result achieved is the first corroboration 

of the MAL in syntactic dependency structure 

(some hints towards the validity of the MAL in 

syntax in general can be found in Köhler, 2012, 

however, without specifying a wider frame-

work, such as, e.g., dependency grammar in this 

paper). 

6 Conclusion and perspectives 

Our paper broadens the scope of the MAL. 

Based on the analysis of the Czech dependency 

treebank, it can be said, tentatively at least, that 

the law is valid also in syntactic dependency 

structure, with clauses being constructs and 

phrases (see Section 2, Figure 2) being constit-

uents. 

Naturally, further analyses must be post-

poned until results from several other languages 

are available. From a theoretical point of view, 

problems needed to be answered include, e.g., 

an interpretation of parameters of the mathe-

matical model and relations with other language 

laws (Köhler, 2005). Another issue waiting to 

be studied more deeply is the question of non-

projective dependency trees. Is the MAL valid 

for them as well? If yes, do the parameter values 

15 The “full version” of the MAL, i.e., function (1) from 
Section 2, achieves a slightly better fit (𝑅2 = 0.9970, with 
𝑎 = 8.11, 𝑏 = −1.06, 𝑐 = 0.15), but it has one parameter 
more, making thus attempts to interpret the parameters 

more difficult.

differ from the ones typical for corpora in which 

projective trees prevail? 

In more applied fields, parameters of the 

MAL parameters in dependency structure could 

perhaps strengthen the arsenal of tools used in 

authorship attribution, automatic text classifica-

tion, and similar areas. 

The parameters of the MAL in syntactic de-

pendency structure offer themselves to be used 

in a syntactic language typology (see, e.g., 

Song, 2001; Whaley, 2010). It would be inter-

esting to take some established typology and to 

check whether there are some typical parameter 

values for typologically similar languages. We 

remind that several attempts to build a language 

typology based on dependency grammar and on 

some characteristics of dependency relations 

appeared in recent years (Liu, 2010, Liu and Li, 

2010; Liu and Xu, 2012; Jing and Liu, 2017). 

In addition to bringing some results, the pa-

per also opens several questions of theoretical 

and/or methodological character, some of 

which can be interesting not only within de-

pendency grammar but also in mathematical 

modelling of language phenomena in general. 

We mention some of them in the following par-

agraphs. 

The MAL is usually modelled across neigh-

bouring levels in the language unit hierarchy. It 

seems that clauses and phrases (as defined in 

Section 2) are “neighbours” in this sense. The 

question is which is the next unit when one 

looks “downwards”. We chose word as the con-

stituent of a phrase, but the possibility that we 

skipped some level(s) cannot be a priori ex-

cluded. Will the MAL be valid also for the rela-

tion between phrases and “subphrases”, i.e., 

units directly dependent on phrases? If yes, how 

many levels are there? 

Up to our knowledge, there are no published 

results on the relation between sizes of clauses 

and words16. The paper by Buk and Rovenchak 

(2008), focusing mainly on the relation between 

sentence length and clause length (relation be-

tween clause length in words and word length 

in syllables can be reconstructed from the data 

for a narrow interval of clause size), does not 

bring any convincing results, it ends with a call 

for a clarification of the notion of clause. Can 

the reason be that clauses and words are not 

                                                           
16 Similar discussions were opened by Chen and Liu 
(2016) on the relation between sizes of word and its con-

stituents (i.e., one level lower than in this paper) in Chi-

nese, and by Sanada (2016) on the relation between sizes 

neighbours in this sense17, and that one should 

consider an intermediate level, such as phrase in 

this paper?  

Nonetheless, the MAL is a good model (in 

terms of goodness of fit) for the relation be-

tween lengths of sentence (in clauses) and 

clause (in words). The validity of the law was 

corroborated in eight languages (Czech, Eng-

lish, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, 

Slovak, Swedish), see Köhler (1982), Heups 

(1983), and Teupenhayn and Altmann (1984). 

But, as it was mentioned above, clauses and 

words do not seem to be direct neighbours in the 

language unit hierarchy. These two facts – the 

assumed existence of some level(s) between 

clause and word on the one hand, and the valid-

ity of the MAL for the relation between lengths 

of sentences in clauses and of clauses in words 

– can be reconciled, e.g., if not one, but two lev-

els (phrases and “subphrases”) were omitted. 

Still another possible explanation is that we an-

alyze parallel nested structures analogous to, 

e.g., the two chains of units mention in Sec-

tion 2, one of which consists of words, syllables 

and phonemes, and the other of words, mor-

phemes and graphemes. Dependency grammar, 

with its (relatively) clearly defined relations 

among words in a clause, can be a useful tool 

for determining “reasonable” (i.e., linguistically 

interpretable) language units “between” clause 

and word (if there are any) and for investigating 

relations among them. 

It is our hope that our paper may serve as a 

stimulus towards future research in the areas of 

syntactic dependency structure and of relations 

among language units in general (especially 

with respect to their sizes and mutual influ-

ences).
