The Future Directions of Dialogue-Based Intelligent Personal Assistants 
 
Abstract : Today is the era of intelligent personal assistants. All the major tech giants have 
introduced personal assistants as the front end of their services, including Apple’s Siri, 
Microsoft’s Cortana, Facebook’s M, and Amazon’s Alexa. Several of these companies have also 
released bot toolkits so that other smaller companies can join the fray. However, while the 
quality of conversational interactions with intelligent personal assistants is crucial for their 
success in both business and personal applications, fundamental problems, such as discourse 
processing, computational pragmatics, user modeling, and collecting and annotating adequate 
real data, remain unsolved. Furthermore, the intelligent personal assistants of tomorrow raise a 
whole set of new technical problems.  
The special SIGDIAL session "The Future of Dialogue-Based Intelligent Personal Assistants" 
holds a panel discussion with notable academic and industry players, leading to insights on 
future directions.
