Abstract

We work on translation from rich-resource lan-
guages to low-resource languages. The main
challenges we identify are the lack of low-
resource language data, effective methods for
cross-lingual transfer, and the variable-binding
problem that is common in neural systems.
We build a translation system that addresses
these challenges using eight European lan-
guage families as our test ground. Firstly, we
add the source and the target family labels
and study intra-family and inter-family influ-
ences for effective cross-lingual transfer. We
achieve an improvement of +9.9 in BLEU
score for English-Swedish translation using
eight families compared to the single-family
multi-source multi-target baseline. Moreover,
we find that training on two neighboring fam-
ilies closest to the low-resource language is
often enough. Secondly, we construct an ab-
lation study and find that reasonably good
results can be achieved even with consid-
erably less target data. Thirdly, we address
the variable-binding problem by building
an order-preserving named entity translation
model. We obtain 60.6% accuracy in qualita-
tive evaluation where our translations are akin
to human translations in a preliminary study.

1 Introduction

We work on translation from a rich-resource lan-
guage to a low-resource language. There is usu-
ally little low-resource language data, much less
parallel data available (Duong et al., 2016; Anas-
tasopoulos et al., 2017); Despite of the challenges
of little data and few human experts, it has many
useful applications. Applications include translat-
ing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) guide-
lines to protect Indian tribal children against water-
borne diseases, introducing earthquake prepared-
ness techniques to Indonesian tribal groups liv-
ing near volcanoes and delivering information to

the disabled or the elderly in low-resource lan-
guage communities (Reddy et al., 2017; Barrett,
2005; Anastasiou and Schäler, 2010; Perry and
Bird, 2017). These are useful examples of trans-
lating a closed text known in advance to the low-
resource language.

There are three main challenges. Firstly, most of
previous works research on individual languages
instead of collective families. Cross-lingual im-
pacts and similarities are very helpful when there
is little data in low-resource language (Shoemark
et al., 2016; Sapir, 1921; Odlin, 1989; Cenoz,
2001; Toral and Way, 2018; De Raad et al., 1997;
Hermans, 2003; Specia et al., 2016). Secondly,
most of the multilingual Neural Machine Trans-
lation (NMT) works assume the same amount of
training data for all languages. In the low-resource
case, it is important to exploit low or partial data
in low-resource language to produce high quality
translation. The third issue is the variable-binding
problem that is common in neural systems, where
“John calls Mary” is treated the same way as
“Mary calls John” (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988;
Graves et al., 2014). It is more challenging when
both “Mary” and “John” are rare words. Solving
the binding problem is crucial because the mis-
takes in named entities change the meaning of the
translation. It is especially challenging in the low-
resource case because many words are rare words.

Our contribution in addressing these issues
is three-fold, extending from multi-source multi-
target attentional NMT. Firstly, to examine intra-
family and inter-family influences, we add source
and target language family labels in training.
Training on multiple families improves BLEU
score significantly; moreover, we find training
on two neighboring families closest to the low-
resource language gives reasonably good BLEU
scores, and we define neighboring families closely
in Section 3.2. Secondly, we conduct an ablation

study to explore how generalization changes with
different amounts of data and find that we only
need a small amount of low-resource language
data to produce reasonably good BLEU scores.
We use full data except for the ablation study. Fi-
nally, to address the variable-binding problem, we
build a parallel lexicon table across twenty-three
European languages and devise a novel method of
order-preserving named entity translation method.
Our method works in translation of any text with
a fixed set of named entities known in advance.
Our goal is to minimize manual labor, but not to
fully automate to ensure the correct translation of
named entities and their ordering.

In this paper, we begin with introduction and re-
lated work in Section 1 and 2. We introduce our
methods in addressing three issues that are impor-
tant for translation into low-resource language in
Section 3.2, as proposed extensions to our base-
line in Section 3.1. Finally, we present our results
in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.

2 Related Work

2.1 Multilingual Attentional NMT

Attentional NMT is trained directly in an end-to-
end system and has flourished recently (Wu et al.,
2016; Sennrich et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2015). Ma-
chine polyglotism, training machines to be pro-
ficient in many languages, is a new paradigm of
multilingual NMT (Johnson et al., 2017; Ha et al.,
2016; Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016;
Dong et al., 2015; Gillick et al., 2016; Al-Rfou
et al., 2013; Tsvetkov et al., 2016). Many multilin-
gual NMT systems involve multiple encoders and
decoders, and it is hard to combine attention for
quadratic language pairs bypassing quadratic at-
tention mechanisms (Firat et al., 2016). In multi-
source scenarios, multiple encoders share a com-
bined attention mechanism (Zoph and Knight,
2016). In multi-target scenarios, every decoder
handles its own attention with parameter shar-
ing (Dong et al., 2015). Attention combination
schemes include simple combination and hierar-
chical combination (Libovickỳ and Helcl, 2017).

The state-of-the-art of multilingual NMT is
adding source and target language labels in train-
ing a universal model with a single attention
scheme, and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is used at
preprocessing stage (Ha et al., 2016). This method
is elegant in its simplicity and its advancement
in low-resource language translation as well as

zero-shot translation using pivot-based translation
scheme (Johnson et al., 2017). However, these
works have training data that increases quadrati-
cally with the number of languages (Dong et al.,
2015; Gillick et al., 2016), rendering training on
massively parallel corpora difficult.

2.2 Sub-word Level NMT
Many NMT systems lack robustness with out-
of-vocabulary words (OOVs) (Wu et al., 2016).
Most OOVs are treated as unknowns ($UNKs)
uniformly, even though they are semantically im-
portant and different (Ling et al., 2015; Sennrich
et al., 2016). To tackle the OOV problem, re-
searchers work on byte-level (Gillick et al., 2016)
and character-level models (Ling et al., 2015;
Chung et al., 2016). Many character-level mod-
els do not work as well as word-level models, and
do not produce optimal alignments (Tiedemann,
2012). As a result, many researchers shift to sub-
word level modeling between character-level and
word-level. One prominent direction is BPE which
iteratively learns subword units and balances se-
quence length and expressiveness with robustness
(Sennrich et al., 2016).

2.3 Lexiconized NMT
Much research is done in translating lexicons and
named entities in NMT (Nguyen and Chiang,
2017; Wang et al., 2017; Arthur et al., 2016).
Some researchers create a separate character-level
named entity model and mark all named entities as
$TERMs to train (Wang et al., 2017). This method
learns people’s names well but does not improve
BLEU scores (Wang et al., 2017). It is time-
consuming and adds to the system complexity.
Other researchers attempt to build lexicon trans-
lation seamlessly with attentional NMT by us-
ing an affine transformation of attentional weights
(Nguyen and Chiang, 2017; Arthur et al., 2016).
Some also attempt to embed cross-lingual lexicons
into the same vector space for transfer of informa-
tion (Duong et al., 2017).

3 Translation System

3.1 Baseline Translation System
Our baseline is multi-source multi-target atten-
tional NMT within one language family through
adding source and target language labels with a
single unified attentional scheme, with BPE used
at the preprocessing stage. The source and target
vocabulary are not shared.

3.2 Proposed Extensions

We present our methods in solving three issues rel-
evant to translation into low-resource language as
our proposed extensions.

3.2.1 Language Families and Cross-lingual
Learning

Cross-lingual and cross-cultural influences and
similarities are important in linguistics (Shoe-
mark et al., 2016; Levin et al., 1998; Sapir, 1921;
Odlin, 1989; Cenoz, 2001; Toral and Way, 2018;
De Raad et al., 1997; Hermans, 2003; Specia
et al., 2016). The English word, “Beleaguer” orig-
inates from the Dutch word “belegeren”; “fidget”
originates from the Nordic word “fikja”. English
and Dutch belong to the same family and their
proximity has effect on each other (Harding and
Sokal, 1988; Ross et al., 2006). Furthermore, lan-
guages that do not belong to the same family affect
each other too (Sapir, 1921; Ammon, 2001; Toral
and Way, 2018). “Somatic” stems from the Greek
word “soma”; “広告” (Japanese), “광고”(Korean),
“Quảng cáo”(Vietnamese) are closely related to
the Traditional Chinese word “廣告”. Indeed,
many cross-lingual similarities are present.

In this paper, we use the language phylogenetic
tree as the measure of closeness of languages and
language families (Petroni and Serva, 2008). The
distance measure of language families is the col-
lective of all of the component languages. Lan-
guage families that are next to each other in the
language phylogenetic tree are treated as neigh-
boring families in our paper, like Germanic family
and Romance family. In our discussion in this pa-
per, we will often refer to closely related families
in the language phylogenetic tree as neighboring
families.

We prepend the source and target family labels,
in addition to the source and target language labels
to the source sentence to improve convergence
rate and increase translation performance. For ex-

ample, all French-to-English translation pairs are
prepended with four labels, the source and target
family labels and the source and target languages
labels, i.e., __opt_family_src_romance
__opt_family_tgt_germanic
__opt_src_fr __opt_tgt_en. In Sec-
tion 4, we examine intra-family and inter-family
effects more closely.

3.2.2 Ablation Study on Target Training data
To achieve high information transfer from rich-
resource language to low-resource target language,
we would like to find out how much target training
data is needed to produce reasonably good per-
formance. We vary the amount of low-resource
training data to examine how to achieve reason-
ably good BLEU score using limited low-resource
data. In the era of Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT), researchers have worked on data sampling
and sorting measures (Eck et al., 2005; Axelrod
et al., 2011).

To rigorously determine how much low-
resource target language is needed for reasonably
good results, we do a range of control experiments
by drawing samples from the low-resource lan-
guage data randomly with replacement and dupli-
cate them if necessary to ensure all experiments
carry the same number of training sentences. We
keep the amount of training data in rich-resource
languages the same, and vary the amount of train-
ing data in low-resource language to conduct rig-
orous control experiments. Our data selection pro-
cess is different from prior research in that only
the low-resource training data is reduced, simulat-
ing the real world scenario of having little data in
low-resource language. By comparing results from
control experiments, we determine how much low-
resource data is needed.

3.2.3 Order-preserving Lexiconized NMT
The variable-binding problem is an inherent is-
sue in connectionist architectures (Fodor and
Pylyshyn, 1988; Graves et al., 2014). “John calls
Mary” is not equivalent to “Mary calls John”, but
neural networks cannot distinguish the two easily
(Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988; Graves et al., 2014).
The failure of traditional NMT to distinguish the
subject and the object of a sentence is detrimental.
For example, in the narration “John told his son
Ryan to help David, the brother of Mary”, it is a se-
rious mistake if we reverse John and Ryan’s father-
son relationships or confuse Ryan’s and David’s

relationships with Mary.
In our research on translation, we focus mainly

on text with a fixed set of named entities known
in advance. We assume that experts help to trans-
late a given list of named entities into low-resource
language first before attempting to translate any
text. Under this assumption, we propose an order-
preserving named entity translation mechanism.
Our solution is to first create a parallel lexicon
table for all twenty-three European languages us-
ing a seed English lexicon table and fast-aligning
it with the rest (Dyer et al., 2013). Instead of using
$UNKs to replace the named entities, we use $NEs
to distinguish them from the other unknowns. We
also sequentially tag named entities in a sentence
as $NE1, $NE2, . . . , to preserve their ordering. For
every sentence pair in the multilingual training, we
build a target named entity decoding dictionary
by using all target lexicons from our lexicon ta-
ble that matches with those appeared in the source
sentence. During the evaluation stage, we replace
all the numbered $NEs using the target named en-
tity decoding dictionary to present our final trans-
lation. This method improves translation accuracy
greatly and preserves the order.

As a result of our contribution, the experts only
need to translate a few lexicons and a small amount
of low-resource text before passing the task to our
system to obtain good results. Post-editing and mi-
nor changes may be required to achieve 100% ac-
curacy before the releasing the translation to the
low-resource language communities.

4 Experiments and Results

We choose the Bible corpus as a test ground for
our proposed extensions because the Bible is the
most translated text that exists and is freely acces-
sible. Though it has limitations, it does not have
copyright issues like most of literary works that
are translated into many languages do. There are
many research works done using the Bible (Naai-
jer and Roorda, 1993; Mayer and Cysouw, 2014;
Scannell, 2006; Dufter and Schütze, 2018; Resnik

et al., 1999; Chan and Pollard, 2001; Banchs
and Costa-Jussà, 2011; Christodouloupoulos and
Steedman, 2015; Beale et al., 2005). Unlike many
past research works where only New Testament is
used (Dufter and Schütze, 2018), we use both Old
Testament and New Testament in our Bible cor-
pus. We align all Bible verses across different lan-
guages.

We train our proposed model on twenty-three
European languages across eight families on a
parallel Bible corpus. For our purpose, we treat
Swedish as our hypothetical low-resource target
language, English as our rich-resource language
in the single-source single-target case and all
other Germanic languages as our rich-resource
languages in the multi-source multi-target case.

Firstly, we present our data and training pa-
rameters. Secondly, we add family tags in differ-
ent configurations of language families showing
intra-family and inter-family effects. Thirdly, we
conduct an ablation study and plot the general-
ization curves by varying the amount of training
data in Swedish, and we show that training on
one fifth of the data give reasonably good BLEU
scores. Lastly, we devise an order-preserving lexi-
con translation method by building a parallel lexi-
con table across twenty-three European languages
and tagging named entities in order.

4.1 Data and Training Parameters
We clean and align the Bible in twenty-three Eu-
ropean languages in Table 1. We randomly sam-
ple the training, validation and test sets according
to the 0.75, 0.15, 0.10 ratio. Our training set con-
tains 23K verses, but is massively parallel. In our
control experiments, we also use the experiment
training on the WMT’14 French-English dataset
together with French and English Bibles to com-
pare with our results. Note that our WMT baseline
contains French and English Bibles in addition to
the WMT’14 data, and is used to contrast our re-
sults with the effect of increasing data.

In all our experiments, we use a minibatch size
of 64, dropout rate of 0.3, 4 RNN layers of size
1000, a word vector size of 600, learning rate of
0.8 across all LSTM-based multilingual experi-
ments. For single-source single-target translation,
we use 2 RNN layers of size 500, a word vector
size of 500, and learning rate of 1.0. All learning
rates are decaying at the rate of 0.7 if the valida-
tion score is not improving or it is past epoch 9. We
use SGD as our learning algorithm. We build our

code based on OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017). For
the ablation study, we train on BLEU scores di-
rectly until the Generalization Loss (GL) exceeds a
threshold of α = 0.1 (Prechelt, 1998). GL at epoch
t is defined as GL(t) = 100(1 − E

fied by us to suit our objective using BLEU scores
(Prechelt, 1998). Etval is the validation score at
epoch t andEtopt is the optimal score up to epoch t.
We evaluate our models using both BLEU scores
(Papineni et al., 2002) and qualitative evaluation.

4.2 Family labels and Intra-family &
Inter-family Effects

We first investigate intra-family and inter-family
influences and the effects of adding family labels.
We use full training data in this subsection. Adding
family labels not only improves convergence rate,
but also increases BLEU scores.

Languages have varying closeness to each
other: Single-source single-target translations of
different languages in Germanic family to Swedish
show huge differences in BLEU scores as shown
in Table 3. These differences are well aligned with
the multi-source multi-target results. Norwegian-
Swedish and Danish-Swedish translations have
much higher BLEU scores than the rest. This hints
that Norwegian and Danish are closer to Swedish
than the rest in the neural representation.

proves greatly from single-source single-tar-
get translation: English-Swedish single-source
single-target translation gives a low BLEU score
of 6.9 as shown in Table 3, which is understand-
able as our dataset is very small. BLEU score for
English-Swedish translation improves greatly to
34.0 in multi-source multi-target NMT training on
Germanic family as shown in Table 2. In this pa-
per, we treat Germanic multi-source multi-target
NMT as our baseline model. Complete tables of
multi-source and multi-target experiments are in
the appendices. We present only relevant columns
important for cross-lingual learning and transla-
tion into low-resource language here.

Adding languages from other families into
training improves translation quality within
each family greatly: English-Swedish transla-
tion’s BLEU score improves significantly from
34.0 to 40.3 training on Germanic and Slavic fam-
ilies, and 40.2 training on Germanic and Romance
families as shown in Table 3. After we add all
three families in training, BLEU score for English-
Swedish translation increases further to 41.8 in
Table 3. Finally, after we add all eight families,
BLEU score for English-Swedish translation in-
creases to 42.1 in Table 3.

A Plateau is observed after adding more than
one neighboring family: A plateau is observed
when we plot Table 3 in Figure 1. The increase
in BLEU scores after adding two families is much
milder than that of the first addition of a neighbor-

ily unit

ing family. This hints that using unlimited number
of languages to train may not be necessary.

Adding family labels not only improves con-
vergence rate, but also increases BLEU scores:
We observe in Table 4 that BLEU scores for most
language pairs improve with the addition of fam-
ily labels. Training on eight language families, we
achieve a BLEU score of 43.9 for English-Swedish
translation, +9.9 above the Germanic baseline. In-
deed, the more families we have, the more helpful
it is to distinguish them.

Training on two neighboring families near-
est to the low-resource language gives better re-
sult than training on languages that are further
apart: Our observation of the plateau hints that
training on two neighboring families nearest to the
low-resource language is good enough as shown in
Table 3. Before jumping to conclusion, we com-
pare results of adding languages by family with
that of adding languages by random samples that
span all eight families, defined as the following.

Definition 4.1 (Language Spanning). A set of lan-
guages spans a set of families when it contains at
least one language from each family.

In Figure 3, we conduct a few experiments on
French-English translation using different ways of
adding training data. Let family addition describe
the addition of training data through adding close-
by language families based on the unit of family;
let sparse addition describe the addition of train-
ing data through adding language sets that spans
eight language families. In sparse addition, lan-
guages are further apart as each may represent a
different family. We find that family addition gives
better generalization than that of sparse addition. It
strengthens our earlier results that training on two
families closest to our low-resource language is a
reliable way to reach good generalization.

Figure 4: Single-source single-target English-Swedish
BLEU plots against increasing amount of Swedish data.

Figure 5: Multi-source multi-target Germanic-family-trained
BLEU plots against increasing amount of Swedish data.

Generalization is not merely an effect of in-
creasing amount of data: In Figure 3, we com-
pare all methods of adding languages against a
WMT’14 curve by using equivalent amount of
WMT’14 French-English data in each experiment.
The WMT’14 curve serve as our benchmark of
observing the effect of increasing data, we ob-
serve that our addition of other languages improve
BLEU score much sharply than the increase in the
benchmark, showing that our generalization is not
merely an effect of increasing data. We also ob-
serve that though increase WMT’14 data initially
increases BLEU score, it reaches a plateau and
adding more WMT’14 data does not increase per-
formance from very early point.

4.3 Ablation Study on Target Training Data

We use full training data from all rich-resource
languages, and we vary the amount of training data
in Swedish, our low-resource language, spanning
from one tenth to full length uniformly. We dupli-
cate the subset to ensure all training sets, though
having a different number of unique sentences,
have the same number of total sentences.

Power-law relationship is observed between
the performance and the amount of training
data in low-resource language: Figure 5 shows
how BLEU scores vary logarithmically with the
number of unique sentences in the low-resource
training data. It follows a linear pattern for single-
source single-target translation from English to

Swedish as shown in Figure 4. We also observe
a linear pattern for the multi-source multi-target
case, though more uneven in Figure 5. The linear
pattern with BLEU scores against the logarithmic
data shows the power-law relationship between the
performance in translation and the amount of low-
resource training data. Similar power-law relation-
ships are also found in past research and con-
temporary literature (Turchi et al., 2008; Hestness
et al., 2017).

We achieve reasonably good BLEU scores us-
ing one fifth of random samples: For the multi-
source multi-target case, we find that using one
fifth of the low-resource training data gives rea-
sonably good BLEU scores as shown in Figure 5.
This is helpful when we have little low-resource
data. For translation into low-resource language,
the experts only need to translate a small amount
of seed data before passing it to our system 1.

4.4 Order-preserving Lexiconized NMT

We devise a mechanism to build a parallel lexi-
con table across twenty-three European languages

1Note that using nine tenth of random samples yields
higher performance than using full data, but it may not be
generalized to other datasets.

using very little data and zero manual work. A
few lexicon examples are shown in Table 6. We
first extract named entities from the English Bible
(Manning et al., 2014) and combine them with
English biblically named entities from multiple
sources (Easton, 1897; Nave, 1903; Smith et al.,
1967; Hitchcock, 1874; Rice, 2015). Secondly,
we carefully automate the filtering process to ob-
tain a clean English lexicon list. Using this list as
the seed, we build a parallel lexicon table across
all twenty-three languages through fast-aligning
(Dyer et al., 2013). The final parallel lexicon ta-
ble has 2916 named entities. In the translation
task into low-resource language, we assume that
the experts first translate these lexicon entries, and
then translate approximately one fifth random sen-
tences before we train our NMT. If necessary, the
experts evaluate and correct translations before re-
leasing the final translations to the low-resource
language community. We aim to reduce human ef-
fort in post-editing and increase machine accuracy.
After labeling named entities in each sentence pair
in order, we train and obtain good translation re-
sults.

We observe 60.6% accuracy in human evalu-
ation where our translations are parallel to hu-
man translations: In Table 8, we show some ex-
amples of machine translated text, we also show
the expected correct translations for comparison.
Not only the named entities are correctly mapped,
but also the ordering of the subject and the object
is preserved. In a subset of our test set, we conduct
human evaluation on 320 English-Swedish results
to rate the translations into three categories: accu-
rate (parallel to human translation), almost accu-
rate (needing minor corrections) and inaccurate.
More precisely, each sentence is evaluated using
three criteria: correct set of named entities, correct
positioning of named entities, and accurate mean-
ing of overall translation. If a sentence achieves all
three, then it is termed as accurate; if either a name
entity is missing or its position is wrong, then it
is termed as almost accurate (needing minor cor-

rection); if the meaning of the sentence is entirely
wrong, then it is inaccurate. Our results are 60.6%
accurate, 33.8% needing minor corrections, and
5.6% inaccurate. Though human evaluation car-
ries bias and the sample is small, it does give us
perspective on the performance of our model.

Order-preservation performs well especially
when the named entities are rare words: In
Table 8, NMT without order-preservation lexi-
conized treatment performs well when named en-
tities are common words, but fails to predict the
correct set of named entities and their ordering
when named entities are rare words. The last col-
umn shows the number of occurrences of each
named entity. For the last example, there are many
named entities that only occur in data once, which
means that they never appear in training and only
appear in the test set. The normal NMT without
order-preservation lexiconized treatment predicts
the wrong set of named entities with the wrong
ordering. Our lexiconized order-preserving NMT,
on the contrary, performs well at both the head
and tail of the distribution, predicts the right set
of named entities with the right ordering.

Prediction with longer sentences and many
named entities are handled well: In Table 8, we
see that normal NMT without order-preservation
lexiconized treatment performs well with short
sentences and few named entities in a sentence.
But as the number of the name entities per sen-
tence increases, especially when the name enti-
ties are rare unknowns as discussed before, nor-
mal NMT cannot make correct prediction of the
right set of name entities with the correct ordering

8. Our lexiconized order-preserving NMT, on the
contrary, gives very high accuracy when there are
many named entities in the sentence and maintains
their correct ordering.

Trimming the lexicon list that keeps the tail
helps to increase BLEU scores: Different from
most of the previous lexiconized NMT works
where BLEU scores never increase (Wang et al.,
2017), our BLEU scores show minor improve-
ments. BLEU score for German-Swedish transla-
tion increases from 35.8 to 36.6 in Table 7. As an
attempt to increase our BLEU scores even further,
we conduct two more experiments. In one setting,
we keep only the tail of the lexicon table that occur
in the Bible once. In another setting, we keep only
a manual selection of lexicons. Note that this is
the only place where manual work is involved and
is not essential. There are minor improvements in
BLEU scores in both cases.

33.8% of the translations require minor cor-
rections: The sentence length for these transla-
tions that require minor corrections is often longer.
We notice that some have repetitions that do not
affect meaning, but need to be trimmed. Some
have the under-prediction problem where certain
named entities in the source sentence never ap-
pear; in this case, missing named entities need to
be added. Some have minor issues with plurality
and tense. We show a few examples of the transla-
tions that need minor corrections in the appendices
for reference. Typically, sentences with longer sen-
tence length and more complicated named entity
relationships require minor corrections to achieve
high translation quality.

5 Conclusion and Future Directions

We present our order-preserving translation sys-
tem for cross-lingual learning in European lan-
guages. We examine three issues that are impor-
tant to translation into low-resource language: the
lack of low-resource data, effective cross-lingual
transfer, and the variable-binding problem.

Firstly, we add the source and the target family
labels in training and examined intra-family and
inter-family effects. We find that training on mul-
tiple families, more specifically, training on two
neighboring families nearest to the low-resource
language improves BLEU scores to a reasonably
good level. Secondly, we devise a rigorous abla-
tion study and show that we only need a small por-
tion of the low-resource target data to produce rea-
sonably good BLEU scores. Thirdly, to address the
variable-binding problem, we build a parallel lexi-
con table across twenty-three European languages
and design a novel order-preserving named en-
tity translation method by tagging named entities
in each sentence in order. We achieve reasonably
good quantitative and qualitative improvements in
a preliminary study.

The order-preserving named entity translation
labels named entities in order. Since there are
relatively less number of long sentences with
many named entities than short sentences with few
named entities, underprediction of named entities
in long sentences may occur. To seek solution to
the underprediction problem, we are looking at
randomized labeling of the named entities. More-
over, our order-preserving named entity translation
method works well with a fixed pool of named en-
tities in any static document known in advance.
This is due to our unique use cases for applica-
tions like translating water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) guidelines written in the introduction.
We devise our method to ensure high accuracy
targeting translating named entities in static doc-
ument known in advance. However, researchers
may need to translate dynamic document to low-
resource language in real-time. We are actively re-
searching into the dynamic timely named entity
discovery with high accuracy.

We are actively extending our work to cover
more world languages, more diverse domains, and
more varied sets of datasets to show our methods
are generalizable. Since our experiments shown
in this paper are using European languages, we
are also interested on non-European languages

like Arabic, Indian, Chinese, Indonesian and many
others to show that our model is widely general-
izable. We also expect to discover interesting re-
search ideas exploring a wider universe of linguis-
tically dissimilar languages.

Our work is helpful for translation into low-
resource language, where human translators only
need to translate a few lexicons and a partial set of
data before passing it to our system. Human trans-
lators may also be needed during post-editing be-
fore a fully accurate translation is released. Our fu-
ture goal is to minimize the human correction ef-
forts and to present high quality translation timely.

We would also like to work on real world low-
resource tribal languages where there is no or
little training data. Translation using limited re-
sources and data in these tribal groups that fits
with the culture-specific rules will be very impor-
tant (Levin et al., 1998). Real world low-resource
languages call for cultural-aware translation.
