Abstract

In an online community, new words come and
go: today’s haha may be replaced by tomor-
row’s lol. Changes in online writing are usu-
ally studied as a social process, with innova-
tions diffusing through a network of individ-
uals in a speech community. But unlike other
types of innovation, language change is shaped
and constrained by the grammatical system in
which it takes part. To investigate the role
of social and structural factors in language
change, we undertake a large-scale analysis of
the frequencies of nonstandard words in Red-
dit. Dissemination across many linguistic con-
texts is a predictor of success: words that ap-
pear in more linguistic contexts grow faster
and survive longer. Furthermore, social dis-
semination plays a less important role in ex-
plaining word growth and decline than previ-
ously hypothesized.

1 Introduction

Stop trying to make “fetch” happen! It’s not going
to happen! – Regina George (Mean Girls, 2005)

With the fast-paced and ephemeral nature of on-
line discourse, language change in online writing
is both prevalent (Androutsopoulos, 2011) and no-
ticeable (Squires, 2010). In social media, new
words emerge constantly to replace even basic ex-
pressions such as laughter: today’s haha is tomor-
row’s lol (Tagliamonte and Denis, 2008). Why
do some nonstandard words, like lol, succeed and
spread to new contexts, while others, like fetch,
fail to catch on? Can a word’s growth be predicted
from patterns of usage during its early days?

Language change can be treated like other so-
cial innovations, such as the spread of hyper-
links (Bakshy et al., 2011) or hashtags (Romero
et al., 2011; Tsur and Rappoport, 2015). A key

aspect of the adoption of a new practice is its dis-
semination: is it used by many people, and in
many social contexts? High dissemination enables
words to achieve greater exposure among social
groups (Altmann et al., 2011), and may signal that
the innovation is positively evaluated.

In addition to social constraints, language
change is also shaped by grammatical con-
straints (D’Arcy and Tagliamonte, 2015). New
words and phrases rarely change the rules of the
game but must instead find their place in a compet-
itive ecosystem with finely-differentiated linguis-
tic roles, or “niches” (MacWhinney, 1989). Some
words become valid in a broad range of linguis-
tic contexts, while others remain bound to a small
number of fixed expressions. We therefore posit a
structural analogue to social dissemination, which
we call linguistic dissemination.

We compare the fates of such words to deter-
mine how linguistic and social dissemination each
relate to word growth, focusing on the adoption of
nonstandard words in the popular online commu-
nity Reddit. The following hypotheses are evalu-
ated:

• H1: Nonstandard words with higher ini-
tial social dissemination are more likely to
grow. Following the intuition that words re-
quire a large social base to succeed, we hy-
pothesize a positive correlation between so-
cial dissemination and word growth.
• H2-weak: Nonstandard words with higher

linguistic dissemination in the early phase
of their history are more likely to grow.
This follows from work in corpus linguis-
tics showing that words and grammatical pat-
terns with a higher diversity of collocations
are more likely to be adopted (Ito and Taglia-
monte, 2003; Partington, 1993).

• H2-strong: Nonstandard words with
higher linguistic dissemination are more
likely to grow, even after controlling for so-
cial dissemination. This follows from the in-
tuition that linguistic context and social con-
text contribute differently to word growth.

To address H2, we develop a novel metric for
characterizing linguistic dissemination, by com-
paring the observed number of n-gram contexts
to the number of contexts that would be predicted
based on frequency alone. Our analysis of word
growth and decline includes: (1) prediction of fre-
quency change in growth words (as in prior work);
(2) causal inference of the influence of dissemi-
nation on probability of word growth; (3) binary
prediction of future growth versus decline; and
(4) survival analysis, to determine the factors that
predict when a word’s popularity begins to de-
cline. All tests indicate that linguistic dissemi-
nation plays an important role in explaining the
growth and decline of nonstandard words.

2 Related Work

Lexical change online Language changes con-
stantly, and one of the most notable forms of
change is the adoption of new words (Metcalf,
2004), sometimes referred to as lexical entrench-
ment (Chesley and Baayen, 2010). New nonstan-
dard words may arise through the mutation of ex-
isting forms by processes such as truncation (e.g,
favorite to fave; Grieve et al., 2016) and blend-
ing (e.g., web+log to weblog to blog; Cook and
Stevenson, 2010). The fast pace and intercon-
nected nature of online communication is partic-
ularly conducive to innovation, and social me-
dia provides a “birds-eye view” on the process
of change (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013;
Kershaw et al., 2016; Tsur and Rappoport, 2015).

The most closely related work is a contempo-
raneous study that explored the role of weak so-
cial ties in the dissemination of linguistic innova-
tions on Reddit, which also proposed the task of
quantitatively predicting the success or failure of
lexical innovations (Tredici and Fernández, 2018).
One distinguishing feature of our work is the em-
phasis on linguistic (rather than social) context in
explaining these successes and failures. In addi-
tion to predicting the binary distinction between
success and failure, we also take on the more fine-
grained task of predicting the length of time that
each nonstandard word will survive.

Social dissemination Language changes as a re-
sult of transmission across generations (Labov,
2007) as well as diffusion across individuals and
social groups (Bucholtz, 1999). Such diffusion
can be quantified with social dissemination, which
Altmann et al. (2011) define as the count of social
units (e.g., users) who have adopted a word, nor-
malized by the expected count under a null model
in which the word is used with equal frequency
across the entire population. Altmann et al. (2011)
use dissemination of words across forum users and
threads to predict the words’ change in frequency
in Usenet, finding a positive correlation between
frequency change and both kinds of social dis-
semination. In contrast, Garley and Hockenmaier
(2012) use the same metric to predict the growth
of English loanwords on German hip-hop forums,
and find that social dissemination has less predic-
tive power than expected. We seek to replicate
these prior findings, and to extend them to the
broader context of Reddit.

Linguistic dissemination In historical linguis-
tics, the distribution of a new word or con-
struction across lexical contexts can signal future
growth (Partington, 1993). Furthermore, gram-
matical and lexical factors can explain a speaker’s
choice of linguistic variant (Ito and Tagliamonte,
2003; Cacoullos and Walker, 2009) and can pro-
vide more insight than social factors alone. Our
study proposes a generalizable method of measur-
ing the dissemination of a word across lexical con-
texts with linguistic dissemination and compares
social and linguistic dissemination as predictors of
language change.

3 Data

Our study examines the adoption of words on so-
cial media, and we focus on Reddit as a source of
language change. Reddit is a social content shar-
ing site separated into distinct sub-communities
or “subreddits” that center around particular top-
ics (Gilbert, 2013). Reddit is a socially diverse and
dynamic online platform, making it an ideal en-
vironment for research on language change (Ker-
shaw et al., 2016). Furthermore, because Reddit
data is publicly available we expect that this study
can be more readily replicated than a similar study
on other platforms such as Facebook or Twitter,
whose data is less easily obtained.

2016, totalling T = 36 months of data. This
dataset has been analyzed in prior work (Hessel
et al., 2016; Tan and Lee, 2015) and has been
noted to have some missing data (Gaffney and
Matias, 2018), although this issue should not af-
fect our analysis. To reduce noise in the data,
we filter all comments generated by known bots
and spam users2 and filter all comments created
in well-known non-English subreddits.3 The final
data collected is summarized in Table 1.

We replace all references to subreddits and
users (marked by the convention r/subreddit and
u/user) with r/SUB and u/USER tokens, and all hy-
perlinks with a URL token. We also reduce all re-
peated character sequences to a maximum length
of three (e.g., loooool to loool). The final vo-
cabulary includes the top 100,000 words by fre-
quency.4 We replace all OOV words with UNK
tokens, which comprise 3.95% of the total tokens.

3.1 Finding growth words

Our work seeks to study the growth of nonstan-
dard words, which we identify manually instead
of relying on pre-determined lists (Tredici and
Fernández, 2018).To detect such words, we first
compute the Spearman correlation coefficient be-
tween the time steps {1...T} and each word w’s
frequency time series f (w)(1:T ) (frequency normal-
ized and log-transformed). The Spearman cor-
relation coefficient captures monotonic, gradual
growth that characterizes the adoption of nonstan-

2The same list used in Tan and Lee (2015): https:
//chenhaot.com/data/multi-community/
README.txt (Accessed 1 October 2016).

3We randomly sampled 100 posts from the top 500 sub-
reddits and labelled a subreddit as non-English if fewer than
90% of its posts were identified by langid.py (Lui and
Baldwin, 2012) as English.

analysis required to identify nonstandard words.

dard words (Grieve et al., 2016; Kershaw et al.,
2016).

The first set of words is filtered by a Spear-
man correlation coefficient above the 85th per-
centile (N = 15, 017). From this set of words,
one of the authors manually identified 1,120 words
in set G (“growth”) that are neither proper nouns
(berniebot, killary, drumpf ) nor standard words
(election, voting).5 These words were removed
because their growth may be due to exogenous in-
fluence. A “standard” word is one that can plau-
sibly be found in a newspaper article, which fol-
lows from the common understanding of news-
paper text as a more formal and standard regis-
ter. Therefore, a “nonstandard” word is one that
cannot plausibly be found in a newspaper arti-
cle, a judgment often used by linguists to deter-
mine what counts as slang (Dumas and Lighter,
1978). In ambiguous cases, one of the authors in-
spected a sample of comments that included the
word. We validate this process by having both au-
thors annotate the top 200 growth candidates for
standard/proper versus nonstandard (binary), ob-
taining inter-annotator agreement of κ=0.79.

3.2 Finding decline words

To determine what makes the growth words suc-
cessful, we need a control group of “decline”
words, which are briefly adopted and later aban-
doned. Although these words may have been suc-
cessful before the time period investigated, their
decline phase makes them a useful comparison for
the growth words. We find such words by fitting
two parametric models to the frequency series.

Piecewise linear fit We fit a two-phase piece-
wise linear regression on each word’s frequency
time series f(1:T ), which splits the time series into
f(1:t̂) and f(t̂+1:T ). The goal is to select a split
point t̂ to minimize the sum of the squared error
between observed frequency f and predicted fre-
quency f̂ :

f̂(m1,m2, b, t) =

{
b+m1t t ≤ t̂
b+m1t̂+m2(t− t̂) t > t̂,

(1)
where b is the intercept, m1 is the slope of the first
phase, and m2 is the slope of the second phase.

growth in the first phase (m1 > 0), decline in
the second phase (m2 < 0), and a strong fit be-
tween observed and predicted data, indicated by
R2(f, f̂) above the 85th percentile (36.1%); this
filtering yields 14,995 candidates.

Logistic fit To account for smoother growth-
decline trajectories, we also fit the growth curve
to a logistic distribution, which is a continuous
unimodal distribution with support over the non-
negative reals. We identify the set of candidates
Dl (“logistic decline”) as words with a strong fit to
this distribution, as indicated byR2 above the 99th

percentile (82.4%), yielding 998 candidates. The
logistic word set partially overlaps with the piece-
wise set, because some words’ frequency time se-
ries show a strong fit to both the piecewise func-
tion and the logistic distribution.

Combined set We combine the sets Dp and Dl
to produce a set of decline word candidates (N =
15, 665). Next, we filter this combined set to ex-
clude standard words and proper nouns, yielding
a total of 530 decline words in set D. Each word
is assigned a split point t̂ based on the estimated
time of switch between the growth phase and the
decline phase, which is the split point t̂ for piece-
wise decline words and the center of the logistic
distribution µ̂ for the logistic decline words.

Examples of both growth and decline words
are shown in Table 2. The growth words in-
clude several acronyms (tbh, “to be honest”; lmao,
“laughing my ass off”), while the decline words
include clippings (atty, “atomizer”), respellings
(rekd, “wrecked”; wot, “what”) and compounds
(nparent, “narcissistic parent”).

We also provide a distribution of the words
across word generation categories in Table 3, in-
cluding compounds and clippings in similar pro-
portions to prior work (Kulkarni and Wang, 2018).
Because the growth and decline words exhibit sim-
ilar proportions of category counts, we do not ex-

pect that this will be a significant confound in dif-
ferentiating growth from decline.

4 Predictors

We now outline the predictors used to measure the
degree of social and linguistic dissemination in
the growth and decline words.

4.1 Social dissemination

We rely on the dissemination metric proposed
by Altmann et al. (2011) to measure the degree to
which a word occupies a specific social niche (e.g.,
low dissemination implies limited niche). To com-
pute user dissemination DU for word w at time t,
we first compute the number of individual users
who used word w at time t, written U (w)t . We then
compare this with the expectation Ũ (w)t under a
model in which word frequency is identical across
all users. The user dissemination is the log ratio,

log
U

(w)
t

Ũ
(w)
t

= logU
(w)
t − log Ũ

(w)
t . (2)

Following Altmann et al. (2011), the expected
count Ũ (w)t is computed as,

Ũ
(w)
t =

∑
u∈Ut

(1− e−f
(w)
t m

(u)
t ), (3)

where m(u)t equals the total number of words con-
tributed by user u in month t, and Ut is the set
of all users active in month t. This corresponds
to a model in which each token from a user has
identical likelihood f (w)t of being word w. In this
way, we compute dissemination for all users (DU ),
subreddits (DS) and threads (DT ) for each month
t ∈ {1...T}.

4.2 Linguistic dissemination

Linguistic dissemination captures the diversity of
linguistic contexts in which a word appears, as
measured by unique n-gram counts. We compute

the log count of unique trigram6 contexts for all
words (C3) using all possible trigram positions: in
the sentence “that’s cool af haha”, the term af ap-
pears in three unique trigrams, that’s cool af, cool
af haha, af haha <END>.

The unique log number of trigram contexts
is strongly correlated with log word frequency
(ρ(C3, f) = 0.904), as implied by Heaps’
law (Egghe, 2007). We therefore adjust this statis-
tic by comparing with its expected value C̃3. At
each timestep t, we fit a linear regression between
log-frequency and log-unique n-gram counts, and
then compute the residual between the observed
log count of unique trigrams and its expectation,
DL = C3t − C̃3t . The residual DL, or linguis-
tic dissemination, identifies words with a higher
or lower number of lexical contexts than expected.

Linguistic dissemination can separate words by
grammatical category, as shown in Figure 1 where
the mean DL values are computed for words
across common part-of-speech categories. Part-
of-speech tags were computed over the entire cor-
pus using a Twitter-based tagger (Gimpel et al.,
2011), and each word type was assigned the most
likely POS tag to provide an approximate distribu-
tion of tags over the vocabulary. Interjections have
a lower medianDL than other word categories due
to the tendency of interjections to occur in limited
lexical contexts. Conversely, verbs have a higher
median DL due to the flexibility of verbs’ argu-
ments (e.g., subject and object may both be open-
class nouns).

5 Results

The hypotheses about social and linguistic dissem-
ination are tested under four analyses: correlation
against frequency change in growth words; causal
inference on probability of word growth; binary

prediction of word growth; and survival analysis
of decline words.

5.1 Correlational analysis
To test the relative importance of the linguistic
and social context on word growth, we corre-
late these metrics with frequency change (∆ft =
ft − ft−k) across all growth words. This repli-
cates the methodology in prior work by Altmann
et al. (2011) and Garley and Hockenmaier (2012),
who analyzed different internet forums. Focus-
ing on long-term change with k = 12 (one year)
and k = 24 (two years), we compute the propor-
tion of variance in frequency change explained by
the covariates using a relative importance regres-
sion (Kruskal, 1987).7

The results of the regression are shown in
Table 4. All predictors have relative impor-
tance greater than zero, according to a bootstrap
method to produce confidence intervals (Tonidan-
del et al., 2009). Frequency is the strongest predic-
tor (ft−12, ft−24), because words with low initial
frequency often show the most frequency change.
In both short- and long-term prediction, linguis-
tic dissemination (DLt−12, D

L
t−24) has a higher rel-

ative importance than each of the social dissem-
ination metrics. The social dissemination met-
rics have less explanatory power, in comparison
with the other predictors and in comparison to the
prior results of Garley and Hockenmaier (2012),
who found 1.5% of variance explained by DU and
1.9% for DT at k = 24. Our results were robust
to the exclusion of the predictor DL, meaning that

a model with only the social dissemination met-
rics as predictors resulted in a similar proportion
of variance explained. The weakness of social dis-
semination could be due to the fragmented nature
of Reddit, compared to more intra-connected fo-
rums. Since users and threads are spread across
many different subreddits, and users may not visit
multiple subreddits, a higher social dissemination
for a particular word may not lead to immediate
growth.

5.2 Causal analysis

While correlation can help explain the relationship
between dissemination and frequency change, it
only addresses the weak version of H2: it does not
distinguish the causal impact of linguistic and so-
cial dissemination. To test the strong version of
H2, we turn to a causal analysis, in which the out-
come is whether a nonstandard word grows or de-
clines, the treatment is a single dissemination met-
ric such as linguistic dissemination, and the co-
variates are the remaining dissemination metrics.
The goal of this analysis is to test the impact of
each dissemination metric, while holding the oth-
ers constant.

Causal inference typically uses a binary treat-
ment/control distinction (Angrist et al., 1996), but
in this case the treatment is continuous. We there-
fore turn to an adapted model known as the aver-
age dose response function to measure the causal
impact of dissemination (Imbens, 2000). To ex-
plain the procedure for estimating the average
dose response, we adopt the following terminol-
ogy: Z for treatment variable, X for covariates, Y
for outcome.8

1. A linear model is fit to estimate the treatment
from the covariates,

Zi | Xi ∼ N (β>Xi, σ2). (4)

The output of this estimation procedure is a
vector of weights β̂ and a variance σ̂2.

2. The generalized propensity score (GPS) R
is the likelihood of observing the treatment
given the covariates, P (Zi | Xi). It is com-
puted from the parameters estimated in the

previous step:

R̂i =
1√

2πσ̂2

(
−(Zi − β̂

)
.

(5)

3. A logistic model is fit to predict the outcome
Yi using the treatment Zi and the GPS R̂i:

Ŷi = Logistic(α̂0 + α̂1Zi + α̂2R̂i). (6)

This involves estimating the parameters
{α̂0, α̂1, α̂2.} By incorporating the general-
ized propensity score R̂i into this predictive
model over the outcome, it is possible to iso-
late the causal effect of the treatment from the
other covariates (Hirano and Imbens, 2004).

4. The range of treatments is divided into levels
(quantiles). The average dose response for
a given treatment level sz is the mean esti-
mated outcome for all instances at that treat-
ment level,

µ̂(sz) =
1

|sz|
∑
zi∈sz

Ŷi. (7)

The average dose response function is then
plotted for all treatment levels.

Each dissemination metric is considered sepa-
rately as a treatment. We consider all other dis-
semination metrics and frequency as covariates:
e.g., for treatment variable DL, the covariates are
set to [f,DU , DS , DT ]. We bootstrap the above
process 100 times with different samples to pro-
duce confidence intervals. To balance the outcome
classes, we sample an equal number of growth and
decline words for each bootstrap iteration.

The average dose response function curves in
Figure 2 show that linguistic dissemination (DL)
produces the most dramatic increase in word
growth probability. For linguistic dissemination,
the lowest treatment quantile (0%-10%) yields a
growth probability below 40% (significantly less
than chance), as compared to the highest treatment
quantile (90-100%), which yields a growth prob-
ability nearly at 70% (significantly greater than
chance). This supports the strong form of H2,
which states that linguistic dissemination is pre-
dictive of growth, even after controlling for the fre-
quency and the other dissemination metrics. Sub-
reddit dissemination also shows a mild causal ef-
fect on word growth, up to 60% in the highest
treatment quantile. The other social dissemination
metrics prove to have less effect on word growth.

5.3 Predictive analysis

We now turn to prediction to determine the utility
of linguistic and social dissemination: using the
first k months of data, can we predict whether a
word will grow or decline in popularity? This is
similar to previous work in predicting the success
of lexical innovations (Kooti et al., 2012), but our
goal is to compare the relative predictive power of
various dissemination metrics, rather than to max-
imize accuracy.

We use logistic regression with 10-fold
cross-validation over four different feature sets:
frequency-only (f), frequency plus linguistic
dissemination (f+L), frequency plus social
dissemination (f+S) and all features (f+L+S).
Each fold is balanced for classes so that the
baseline accuracy is 50%. Figure 3 shows that
linguistic dissemination provides more predictive
power than social dissemination: the accuracy is
consistently higher for the models with linguistic
dissemination than for the frequency-only and
social dissemination models. The accuracies

converge as the training data size increases, which
suggests that frequency is a useful predictor if
provided sufficient historical trajectory.

Part-of-speech robustness check Considering
the uneven distribution of linguistic dissemination
across part-of-speech groups (Figure 1), the pre-
diction results may be explained by an imbalance
of word categories between the growth and decline
words. This issue is addressed through two robust-
ness checks: within-group comparison and predic-
tion.

First, we compare the distribution of linguistic
dissemination values between growth and decline
words, grouped by the most common POS tags
(computed in § 4.2). Each decline word is matched
with a growth word based on similar mean fre-
quency in the first k = 12 months, and their
mean linguistic dissemination values during that
time period are compared, grouped within POS
tag groups. The differences in Figure 4 show that
across all POS tags, the growth words show a ten-
dency toward higher linguistic dissemination with
significant (p < 0.05) differences in the interjec-
tions, adjectives and verbs.



4367

Next, we add POS tags as additional features
to the frequency-only model in the binary predic-
tion task. The accuracy of a predictive model with
access to frequency and POS features at k = 1 is
54.8%, which is substantially lower than the ac-
curacy of the model with frequency and linguistic
dissemination (cf. Figure 3).9 Thus, linguistic dis-
semination thus contributes predictive power be-
yond what is contributed by part-of-speech alone.

5.4 Survival analysis
Having investigated what separates growth from
decline, we now focus on the factors that precede
a decline word’s “death” phase (Drouin and Dury,
2009).

Predicting the time until a word’s decline
can be framed as survival analysis (Klein and
Moeschberger, 2005), in which a word is said to
“survive” until the beginning of its decline phase
at split point t̂. In the Cox proportional hazards
model (Cox, 1972), the hazard of death λ at each
time t is modeled as a linear function of a vector
of predictors,

λi(t) = λ0(t) exp(β · xi), (8)

where xi is the vector of predictors for word i, and
β is the vector of coefficients. Each cell xi,j is set
to the mean value of predictor j for word i over
the training period t = {1...k} where k = 3.

For words which begin to decline in popular-
ity in our dataset, we treat the point of decline
as the “death” date. The remaining words are
viewed as censored instances: they may begin to
decline in popularity at some point in the future,
but this time is outside our frame of observation.
We use frequency, social dissemination and lin-
guistic dissemination as predictors in a Cox re-
gression model.10

The estimated coefficients from the regres-
sion are shown in Table 5. We find a nega-
tive coefficient for linguistic dissemination (β =
−0.330, p < 0.001), which mirrors the results
from § 5.2: higher DL indicates a lower haz-
ard of word death, and therefore a higher likeli-
hood of survival. We also find that higher sub-
reddit dissemination has a weak but insignificant
correlation with a lower likelihood of word death
(β = −0.156, p > 0.05). Both of these results

9Higher k values yield similar results.

lend additional support to the strong form of the
hypothesis H2.

The predictive accuracy of survival analysis can
be quantified by a concordance score. A score of
1.0 on heldout data indicates that the model per-
fectly predicts the order of death times; a score
of 0.5 indicates that the predictions are no bet-
ter than a chance ordering. We perform 10-fold
cross-validation of the survival analysis model,
and plot the results in Figure 5. The model with
access to linguistic dissemination (f+L) consis-
tently achieves higher concordance than the base-
line frequency-only model (f), (t = 4.29, p <
0.001), and the model with all predictors f+L+S
significantly outperforms the model with access
only to frequency and social dissemination f+S
(t = 4.64, p < 0.001). The result is reinforced
by testing the goodness-of-fit for each model with
model deviance, or difference from the null model.
The f+L model has lower deviance, i.e. better fit,
than the null model (χ2 = 93.3, p < 0.01), and
the f+L+S does not have a significantly lower de-
viance than the f+L model (χ2 = 4.6, p = 0.80),

suggesting that adding social dissemination does
not significantly improve model fit.

6 Discussion

All four analyses support H2: linguistic dissemi-
nation was the strongest predictor of monthly fre-
quency changes in growth words, the best differ-
entiator of growth and decline words in causal and
predictive tasks, and the most effective warning
sign that a word is about to decline. Linguistic
dissemination can be related to theories such as
the FUDGE factors (Chesley and Baayen, 2010;
Cook, 2010; Metcalf, 2004), in which a word’s
growth depends on frequency (F), unobtrusiveness
(U), diversity of users and situations (D), gener-
ation of other forms and meanings (G), and en-
durance (E). Linguistic dissemination provides an
example of “diversity of situation.”

The effectiveness of linguistic dissemination
is exemplified in pairs of semantically similar
growth and decline words. In the first k = 3
months of growth, the growth word kinda has
a relatively high ratio of linguistic to frequency
(D

L

f = 0.270) as compared with the semanti-
cally similar decline word sorta (0.055). This pat-
tern holds for other pairs of semantically similar
growth/decline words: fuckwit and fuckboy; lolno
and lmao; yup and yas. While not exhaustive, such
a trend suggests that the growth words were able to
reach a wider range of lexical contexts and there-
fore succeed where the decline words failed.

Regarding H1, we generally found a positive
role for social dissemination as well, although
these results were not consistent across all metrics
and tests, particularly in the survival analysis. This
matches the conclusion from Garley and Hocken-
maier (2012), who argued that social dissemina-
tion is less predictive of word adoption than Alt-
mann et al. (2011) originally suggested. One pos-
sible explanation is the inclusion of word cate-
gories such as proper nouns in the analysis of Alt-
mann et al. (2011); the adoption of such terms may
rely on social dynamics more than the adoption
of nonstandard terms. The lower predictive power
of thread and user dissemination is also interest-
ing and suggests that subreddits are more socially
salient in terms of exposing nonstandard words to
potential adopters.

Limitations One limitation in the study was the
exclusion of orthographic and morphological fea-
tures such as affixation, which has been noted

as a predictor of word growth (Kershaw et al.,
2016). Future work should incorporate these fea-
tures as additional predictors. Our study also omit-
ted borrowings, unlike prior work in word adop-
tion that has focused on borrowings (Chesley and
Baayen, 2010; Garley and Hockenmaier, 2012).
Our early language-filtering steps eliminated most
non-English words from the vocabulary, although
it would have been interesting to examine loan-
word use in English-language posts. Finally, our
study was limited by the focus on nonstandard
words rather than memetic phrases (e.g., like a
boss) which may show a similar correlation be-
tween dissemination, growth and decline (Bybee,
2006).

Future work We approximate linguistic dis-
semination using trigram counts, because they
are easy to compute and they generalize across
word categories. In future work, a more sophis-
ticated approach might estimate linguistic dissem-
ination with syntactic features such as appearance
across different phrase heads (Kroch, 1989; Ito
and Tagliamonte, 2003) or across nouns of dif-
ferent semantic classes (D’Arcy and Tagliamonte,
2015). Future work should also investigate more
semantically-aware definitions of linguistic dis-
semination. The existence of semantic “neigh-
bors” occurring in similar contexts (e.g., the in-
fluence of standard intensifier very on nonstan-
dard intensifier af ) may prevent a new word from
reaching widespread popularity (Grieve, 2018).
