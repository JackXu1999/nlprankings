Preface

This slender volume contains the accepted long and short papers that were submitted to the
9th Joint ISO-ACL/SIGSEM Workshop on Interoperable Semantic Annotation, isa-9, which
was organized in at the University of Potsdam, in the historical city of Potsdam, Germany,
March 19-20, 2013.

isa-9 is the ninth edition of joint workshops on the International Organization for Standards ISO
and the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Semantics, Working Group ”The Rep-
resentation of Multimodal Semantic Information (http://sigsem.uvt.nl). The main
focus of these workshops is on the presentation and discussion of approaches, experiments, ex-
periences, and proposals concerning the construction or application of interoperable linguistic
resources with semantic annotations. The isa workshops are often organized on the occasion
of meetings of ISO projects concerned with the establishment of international standards for se-
mantic annotation and representation, or as a workshop of a larger conference that is dedicated
to related issues. For ISA-9 the occasion is the 10th International Conference on Computational
Semantics IWCS 2013, and as such the workshop traces the footsteps of ISA workshops that
were held in Tilburg in 2005, 2007, and 2009, and in Oxford in 2011, on the occasion of the
IWCS 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011 conferences.

The isa-9 workshop co-includes meetings of several subprojects of the ISO project 24617, ”Se-
mantic annotation framework (SemAF)”, in particular of those concerned with the annotation
of spatial information, the annotation of semantic roles, the annotation of discourse relations,
and basic issues in semantic annotation.

I would like to thank the members of the isa-9 Programme Committee for their careful and
quick reviewing, and the organizers of the the IWCS 2013 conference for supporting the orga-
nization of isa-9 as an IWCS 2013 workshop.
