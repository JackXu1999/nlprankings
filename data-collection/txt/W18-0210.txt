Abstract
This article describes the first steps towards a open-source dependency tree-

bank for Erzya based on universal dependency (UD) annotation standards. The
treebank contains 610 sentences with 6661 tokens and is based on texts from a
range of open-source and public domain original Erzya sources. This ensures its
free availability and extensibility. Texts in the treebank are first morphologically
analyzed and disambiguated after which they are annotated manually for depen-
dency structure. In the article we present some issues in dependency syntax for
Erzya and how they are analyzed in the universal-dependency framework. Pre-
liminary statistics are given for dependency parsing of Erzya, along with points
of interest for future research.

Tiivistelmä
Tässä artikkelissa kerrotaan ersän kielen avoimen puupankin ensimmäisistä

askeleista, joissa sovelletaan universaaliriippuvuus-annotaatiota (UD). Puupank-
ki sisältää 610 virkettä joissa on yhteensä 6661 tokenia ja se perustuu avoimeen
ersänkieliseen originaalikirjoituksiin. Tällä tavalla varmistetaan puupankin saa-
tavuutta ja laajennettavuutta. Puupankin tekstit on ensin analysoitu morfologi-
sella jäsentimellä ja disambiguoitu, minkä jälkeen suoritetaan loppuyksiselitteis-
täminen käsin ja lisätään riippuvuussuhteet. Artikkelissa esitetään joitakin ky-
symyksiä, jotka esiintyvät ersän lauseoppia sovellettaessa universaaliriippuvuus-
kehyksiin. Annetaan alkutilastoja ersän jäsennyksestä sekä ajatuksia tulevan tut-
kimuksen näkemyksistä.

1 Introduction
This article describes work towards the development of a Universal Dependencies-
based dependency treebank for Erzya, a Uralic language traditionally spoken in the
Volga Region. Little if any computational-linguistic research has been published on
syntactic parsing for Erzya. A valuable resource in the study and development of
syntactic parsing is a treebank—a corpus of parsed texts containing gold-standard
syntactic annotation.

Freely available treebanks exist for many languages, one particularly interesting
set is the group of over 60 languages represented in Universal Dependencies (UD),
where Erzya is now one of the smaller “upcoming languages”¹. This mutual presen-
tation makes it possible to understand and utilize language-independent dependency
tagging with direct analogy from other Uralic languages, such as Finnish, Estonian,
North Sami and Hungarian, as well as languages sharing other morphosyntactic char-
acteristics with Erzya. The UD environment also makes direct reference to terminol-
ogy definition resources, such as those offered by SIL², and research in theWorld Atlas
of Language Structures (WALS)³.

To our knowledge, however, no previous treebank exists for either of the Mord-
vinic languages, although there are closed annotated corpora, such as MORMULA at
the University of Turku⁴, quantlang-uhlcs⁵ in Helsinki, and the semi-limited ERME⁶.

In building our treebank we take advantage of previous work done by Rueter in
Helsinki Finite-State Transducer Technology (HFST) morphological analysis and part-
of-speech tagging for Erzya on the Giellatekno infrastructure, as well as ongoing dis-
ambiguation work with Constraint Grammar (VISLCG).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some back-
ground linguistic information on Erzya, and outlines some special challenges in pars-
ing Erzya. In Section 3we describe the corpus that we annotated and themethodology
used in annotating it. Section 4 gives a sketch of some decisions we have made with
respect to annotation guidelines, referring back to the discussion in Section 2. For
reasons of space and time, these guidelines are by no means complete, but they do
present a subset of guidelines which are of particular interest.

2 Background

beginning of the 20th century and down to approximately half a million in the 2010
census⁷. For some, however, Erzya is only a part of the conglomerate Mordvin index,
a population with the status of most numerous among the Uralic languages in Russia.
Since there is no Mordvin language, as it were, but rather the closely related (adjacent
yet not contiguous) Erzya and Moksha languages with their literary representation,
research in syntax has often attempted to encompass the two.

Erzya, like many Uralic languages, is agglutinative with extensive morphology,
agreement and constituent ordering phenomena that present a challenge to any syn-
tactic description of the language. The most prominent of these challenges apparent
from the start are case marking, definiteness, ellipsis, numerals, and copula varia-
tion between dependent and independent morphology. An open-source finite-state
morphological analyzer constructed for Erzya⁸ provides ample tagging for the anno-
tation, but there is still plenty of work to be done with disambiguation. Erzya, much
like other Ural-Altaic languages (Tyers and Washington, 2015), assigns more than
one function to its cases. It also attests to intricate constituent ordering and minimal
conjunction/subjunction marking, which will be one topic future research.

As indicated in Table 1, the definite nominative singular might be attested with
the dependency relation, nsubj, root (in certain equative predications⁹, example (1)),
and to indicate a postposed topic (see example (5.b)).

3 Methodology

3.1 Corpus

To form a corpus, we were able to utilize materials by Erzya authors previously se-
cured for language research purposes while in the Republic of Mordovia. The number
of sources utilized is extremely limited, due to the elementary state of the developing
treebank.

Table 2: Statistics on the composition of the corpus

The initial materials are representitive of original Erzya-language materials from
the late 1920s to the turn of the new millennium. The Separate Individual phrases file
will serve for documenting cited materials from scientific publications, such as the
most recent Erzya syntax Агафонова et al. (2011).

The figures in Table 3 are incomplete, but do provide an initial ball park figure.
It was noted that subsequent work will need to be done with extended dependency
relations, as a small number of the cases returned included the values appos and conj.
Also, the high number of genitive occurrences with the obl relation would indicate
the presence of adpositions. Although the inessive had been indicated earlier as an
object case, there was not a single instance where it occurred as a dependent case.
The distinction of the dependency relations nmod versus nmod:poss in the statistics
has been taken in following with usage in the Finnish UD projects; in subsequent con-
templation, this may, in fact, be unnecessary since the genitive case already indicates
a possessive relation in contrast to the inessive case with a spatial meaning as a noun
modifier.

4 Annotation guidelines
When entering a group, such as UD, it is nearly imperative that all tagging conform
with practices attested in the group. As such, it has been easy to compromise and

relabel/learn values for various features in order to arrive at the group norm, on the
one hand, and present new features, on the other. Work centered around indication
for features (number, person), relations (aux, compound) as well as the handling of
ellipsis and numerals. Certain phenomena clearly require additional time for thought
and development. Work has been facilitated by the use of UD Annotatrix (Tyers
et al., 2018), a tool for annotating treebanks in UD.

4.1 Number

The Erzya language like its closely related sibling Moksha has what is often called the
object or definite conjugation. Unlike Hungarian, Nenets, Khanty and Mansi, how-
ever, the object conjugation of theMordvinic languages morphologically indicates 1st,
2nd and 3rd person as well as singular and plural for some of the object and subject
referents (Keresztes (1999); Trosterud (2006) 246–303). This means that a separates set
of number and person features must be present to distinguish them from the already
existent Number, Person, Number[psor] and Person[psor] features. Fortunately there
were already Number[obj] and Person[obj], so only Number[subj] and Person[subj]
were required as new features.

see-Ind.Prt1.ScSg3.OcSg3
‘he/she/it saw him/her/it’

In examples (2) and (3) there is an actual non-ambiguousmorphological distinction
for third person singular subject in combination with third person singular object in
(2) and third person plural object in (3).

Example (4) is also unambiguous, as both arguments are singular in value. Neither
argument need be present, but both are allowed.

‘you[sg] saw me’

Although it is possible to use personal pronouns in subject and direct object po-
sition, their presence is not the normal situation. Context awareness is required that
transcends conventional sentence boundaries, hence there is person and number dis-
ambiguation present that is not discernible from the morphology but rather the larger
context.

4.2 Copula and polarity

Erzya attests to varied non-verbal predication Turunen (2010) and negation Hamari
(2007) strategies. The copula is divided into locative and non-locative usage, and this
dichotomy can readily be observed in the morphology of the negative copulas, i.e.,
where the negative locative copula is represented by /araś-/ (which is conjugated with
the help of amorphologically dependent copula), whereas the presentation of equative
or class membership negation is shown with the non-flective word form /avoĺ /. Fur-
ther negation is manifest in the converbal negation element /apak/ (which can also be
conjugated), first preterite /eź-/, conjunctional /avoĺ-/, optative and prohibitive /iĺa-/,
and the negative particle /a/. All of these can trigger the dependency relation aux:neg,
which in the case of the polarity markers /a/ and /avoĺ / to all parts of speech.

Proh/Opt Ind.Prt1 Cnd Prc.Neg Part.Neg Part.Neg.Emp
/iĺa-/ /eź-/ /avoĺ-/ /apak/ /a/ /avoĺ/

Table 4: Negation

The six polarity markers in Table 4. can be divided into two categories. The pro-
hibitive/optative, indicative first preterite and conditional stems along with the polar-
ity marker for participles and converb (elsewhere gerund) constructions are all limited
to use with verbal forms.

Whereas the negative particle /a/ can occur with many parts of speech, it is the
non-flective word form /avoĺ / or emphatic negative that is used in clausal negation.
Clausal negation in combination with the imperative mood evokes a contrast in the
prohibitive strategy in /iĺa-/. The clausal negation particle /avoĺ / in combination with
the second person imperative produces a contrastive negative imperative, whereas
the prohibitive /iĺa-/ (Mood=Proh) is combined in the modern literary norm with a
connegative form. This has not been attested in WALS van der Auwera et al. (2013).

4.3 Dependent copula morphology

Copula morphology is dependent and independent in Erzya. While many grammari-
ans of the past century have referred to dependent copula morphology as noun conju-
gation, earlier presentations, such as Wiedemann (1864) (§77), refer to it as a suffixed
copula. Judging from the fact that the dependent morphology can be attached to
nouns in various declensional forms, as well as adjectives, numerals, adverbs, adpos-
tions and non-finite verb forms, the phenomenon might more readily be referred to
as a clitic.

Prt2 /mon odoľiń/ /ton odoľiť/ /son odoľ/ /miń odoľińek/ /tɨń odoľiďe/ /sɨń odoľť/

Table 5: Dependent copula morphology (‘young or new’)

Thus we have independent copula in /uĺń-/ (prt1) and /uĺ-/ (prs), on the one hand,
and dependent copula morphology in -/Oĺ /-, etc.), on the other. Both the nonpast and
prt2 conjugation are virtually identical to their verbal subject conjugation counter-
parts; essentially the prt2 in verbs is a combination of the short nomen agentis + the
prt2 used for copula function beyond the scope of finite verbs.

The dependent and independent morphologies present a challenging problem for
dependency analysis in Erzya, whereas both can be in equative, class member, as-
sertive, locative vs existential, and possessive vs belong-to predication. A dichotomy,
however, is introduced where the Universal Dependency guidelines stating that the
copula should be the dependent of the lexical predicate are applied only to indepen-
dent copula.

The copula as dependent morphology attaches to what some scholars have consid-
ered the subject, but some scholars working with Moksha have approached this from
a discourse point of view Kholodilova (2016). Instead of splitting the copula off as a
separate leaf node, we have annotated the instances with dependent morphology as
the head of the structure. Here constituent ordering might be an underlying factor to
be considered in future work with the Erzya UD treebank.

‘Who are you?’

In both sentences with and without the second person singular personal pronoun,
it is obvious that the word /lomań-eś/ can only be interpreted as an extra element;
more than likely a topic marker. The interrogative pronoun /ki-jat/ in the predica-
tive takes the subject second person singular, whereas the third person singular topic
marker would not have triggered second person singular agreement.

4.4 Further auxiliaries

In addition to the copula and negation, the definition of additional auxiliaries in Erzya
take us to necessitives. Necessitives in Erzya have parallels in Finnish, Komi-Zyrian
and partially in Skolt Sami, in that a non-nominative case is used to indicate the actor,
which might be construed as a subject when aligned with other European, accusative
languages. In Erzya, it is the Dative that is used as in mońeń in example (3).

‘I had to write a letter.’

Discussion with Erzya and Komi native scholars has also introduced the idea of
adding verbs indicating future to the list of auxiliaries, this, however, would be prob-
lematic, due to the second meaning involved, namely, inchoative/inceptive albeit an
aspect marker. In this initial Erzya treebank, auxiliaries have been limited to copulas,
negation and necessitives.

4.5 Compound nouns

The most recent orthographic word list of the Erzya language Бузакова et al. (2012)
prescribes a mathematical strategy to compounding, i.e. if the first element is a nomi-
native singular indefinite form (also called absolute form) with no evident derivation
(sometimes a rather gray definition) two nouns are written as a single unit. This so-
lution is not entirely related to the writing practices of the last century, and there do
prove to be certain problems. The most evident problems are ensemble nouns con-
taining mensural classifiers (for definition see Lyons (1977): p.463; cf. Rueter (2013):
p.108).

In both instance we are talking about a measurement of water, whereas the idea
of a bucket especially intended for water would be constructed in the telic noun /veď
vedra/.

4.6 Noun head ellipsis

An analogy of symmetric negation as described in Miestamo (2013) can be applied to
the description of the Erzya nominal phrase declension. In symmetric negation the
structure of the negative is identical to the structure of the affirmative, except for the
presence of the negative marker(s).

In a similar way, it is the final word of the Erzya noun phrase that is symmetrically
declined while modifiers (with the exception of some determinatives) appear in what
is termed the absolute form. Determinatives such as /iśťamo/ ’like this/that’ can agree
in number with the head noun. (NB. some descriptions Bartens (1999) maintain that
regular adjectivesmight agree for number aswell, but this type of apparent agreement,
seems to be limited to parts of the northwestern dialect)

In an elliptical construction, where the noun head is recoverable or inferable from
the context¹⁰, the case ending is merely joined to the final modifier of the noun phrase.
In practice, the final modifier can be an adjective (such as color, size, shape, etc.), a
participle or converb, a determinatives (ordinal, demonstratives, collective numerals),
non-core case-form nouns (including: Ine, Abe, Cmpr, Tra, Prl, etc.). If the modifiers
are genitive in form, however, they generally require an additional /śe/ element, i.e. a
demonstrative type element. Finally, it should be noted that this kind of construction
usually takes either definite or possessive access marking, see Rueter (2010).

Less frequent, perhaps due to contextual presuppositions, comes the vowel-final

poses a contrastive context.

In elliptical constructions of the nominal phrase, the part-of-speech has been re-
tained in column 4, whereas column 6 bares witness to a deluge of ordered zero-
derivation, and column eight indicates the actual dependency relation of the noun
phrase head.

4.7 Numerals

The Erzya language has several types of regular counting, cardinal, collective, dis-
tributive, multiplicative. There is no problem with counting nouns, such as singular
concrete items, pairs or sets (such as socks, batches, broods); these numerals can be
readily connected with the nummod dependency relation to the noun they modify.
Problematic are the missing dependency relations which might better be character-
ized as iterative numerals; they also count entities, i.e. iterations of a predication
(similar to once, twice, but not twofold, double or the second time).

Associative collectives have also been an initial problem, but by following ongoing
discussions involving the use of French tout the relevant dependency relations would
be, perhaps, advcl and acl, even det. Associative collectives, such as ’both of you’ are
regular for numerals far beyond ten.

5 Future work
Since treebank work with Erzya is barely off the ground, there is still plenty of work
to do with guidelines for further and consistent annotation. In the time since this
paper was originally submitted much experience has been obtained with regard to
consistent annotation. One primary undertaking in the guidelines, however, is to ren-
der them workable for the closely related Moksha language. When more treebanks
have been added, there should be more opportunity to apply the Erzya model since
the morphological analyzers for both languages have been designed using parallel
tagging strategies where ever possible. The automation of dependency relation as-
signment will require further work in constituency ordering documentation, as Erzya
is a so called pro-drop language attesting to low frequency for conjunctions and other
syntactic structural markers.



118

6 In conclusion
This has been a description of the first steps to building Erzya treebanks in accordance
with Universal Dependencies. Much space has been dedicated to extensive morpho-
logical contemplation, where the matters requiring in-depth consideration are actu-
ally the minimalized set of dependency relations in tandem with morphological in-
formation, i.e., minimal use of language-dependent subfeatures. Hopefully, this work
will provide a means for pivoting and sharing in what has been achieved for larger
languages.
