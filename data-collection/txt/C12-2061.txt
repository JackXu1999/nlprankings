ABSTRACT 

While our knowledge about ancient civilizations comes mostly from studies in archaeology and 
history books, much can also be learned or confirmed from literary texts.  Using natural language 
processing techniques, we present aspects of ancient China as revealed by statistical textual 
analysis on the Complete Tang Poems, a 2.6-million-character corpus of all surviving poems 
from the Tang Dynasty (AD 618—907).  Using an automatically created treebank of this corpus, 
we outline the semantic profiles of various poets, and discuss the role of seasons, geography, 
history, architecture, and colours, as observed through word selection and dependencies. 

  
KEYWORDS : Classical Chinese, poetry, dependency parsing, word selection, semantics.

1 Introduction 

In Classical Chinese literature, the prestige and popularity of poetry can hardly be overstated.  
Scholars aspired to master poem composition, not only for career advancement but also as the 
vehicle for personal expression and social commentary.  Common people also liked to memorize, 
chanted, or even composed poems.  The Tang Dynasty (AD 618—907) is widely viewed as the 
zenith of the art of poetry.   

All surviving Tang poems have been preserved in an anthology called the Complete Tang 
Poems1. The whole corpus consists of around 2.6 million Chinese characters, drawn from more 
than 40,000 poems, composed by 2510 authors, as well as some anonymous ones.  The ten most 
prolific poets, by number of characters, are shown in Table 1. 

The sheer size of this corpus means that it would be difficult for any single scholar to analyse all 
poems by reading.  Using a recently compiled digital treebank, we present the first study that 
exploits the entire corpus to answer questions about semantic content and word usage in the 
Complete Tang Poems.  After outlining previous research (Section 2), we describe our data 
(Section 3), and then present our textual analysis (Section 4).

2 Previous Research 

2.1 Text Corpora of Classical Chinese 

There has been increasing interest in corpus-based research on historical languages (Crane & 
Lüdeling, 2012).  Large-scale corpora for Classical Chinese include the Academia Sinica Ancient 
Chinese Corpus (Wei et al., 1997), the corpus at the Centre for Chinese Linguistics Corpus at 
Peking University, the Chinese Ancient Text Database at the Chinese University of Hong Kong 
(Ho, 2002), and the Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (Hu et al., 2005). Linguistic annotations, if 
available in these corpora, are limited to part-of-speech (POS) tags.  With this constraint, most 
previous corpus-based studies focused on character frequency distribution (Zhū, 2004; Zh ng, 
2004; Qín, 2005), including a concordance for the Complete Tang Poems (Shǐ, 1990). 

In terms of syntactic annotations, only two treebanks are currently available: a constituent 
treebank on 1000 sentences from the pre-Qin period (Huang et al., 2002), and a dependency 
treebank on a small subset of the Complete Tang Poems (Lee & Kong, 2012).  This latter 
treebank will be used as training data to automatically produce dependency trees for the entire 
Complete Tang Poems, on which our word analysis will be based. 

                                                           
1 In Chinese, 全唐詩 Quántángshī, (or Ch “an T ang Shi).  The anthology was compiled by a team of scholars in 
1705. Our digital version is downloaded from http://www.xysa.com/quantangshi/t-index.htm

2.2 Studies on the Complete Tang Poems 

Research on syntactic and semantic issues in the Complete Tang Poems is a venerable subfield in 
Classical Chinese philology, with a vast literature.  We seek to demonstrate a new route of 
investigation that can be complementary to traditional scholarship: by interrogating the treebank, 
one can quickly and objectively see broad trends on the entire corpus, which can help validate 
previous studies based on smaller sample, or point to interesting patterns for further in-depth 
analysis by hand. 

A case in point is the semantic classification scheme of Wáng Lì, listed in Table 2. Wáng 
proposed 22 semantic categories (Wáng, 1989, p. 184−203), mostly for nouns but also some 
function words.  As part of our analysis, we will apply these categories on the Complete Tang 
Poems to create semantic profiles of various poets (Section 4.1).

TABLE 2 – Semantic categories for nouns in the Complete Tang Poems (Wáng, 1989). 
3 Data 

A dependency treebank covering a subset of the Complete Tang Poems has been built (Lee & 
Kong, 2012).  It consists of about 32,000 words, annotated with part-of-speech (POS) tags and 
dependency labels, derived from the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) and Stanford 
dependencies for Modern Chinese (Chang et al., 2009). 

Using this treebank as training data, we performed POS tagging2 on the whole Complete Tang 
Poems with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), and dependency parsing with the Minimum-Spanning 
Tree (MST) Parser (McDonald et al., 2006).  On ten-fold cross-validation on the treebank itself, 
the average UAS and LAS of dependency parsing are 84.3% and 75.6% respectively3.  

                                                           
2 Although word segmentation is provided in the treebank, in general the syllable, written with a single character, and the word correspond in Classical Chinese  (Pulleyblank, 1995, p. 8); most words to be analysed in this paper 
(Section 4) are indeed single characters. 
3 Similar experiments with MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2009) yielded similar accuracy rates.

4 Analysis 

We first analyze the semantic content of the Complete Tang Poems both globally and by author 
(section 4.1), then use dependency information to glean aspects of the seasons, geography, 
architecture, history and use of colours in Ancient China (section 4.2).  

4.1 Semantic Profile 

To identify the main themes of the poems, we compute the distribution of the semantic categories 
listed in Table 2; the result is shown in Table 3.  The five most frequent categories are 
‘Geographic’, ‘Adverbs’, ‘Celestial’, ‘Human emotions’, and ‘Seasonal’.  For the most prolific 
poets, at least four of these five categories also rank among their individual top five, indicating 
that the topics of interest are rather uniform among Tang poets.  Overall, aspects of nature 
(‘Geographic’, ‘Celestial’, ‘Seasonal’, etc.) dominate the attention of the poets, compared to 
aspects of humans (‘Human emotions’, ‘Human relationships’, ‘Body parts’, etc.). 

Category Freq. Category Freq. Category Freq. 
Geographic 11.79% Flora 4.94% Conj. and prep. 2.54% 
Adverbs 9.49% Pronouns 4.87% Clothing 1.19% 
Celestial 9.48% Body parts 4.84% Instruments 1.08% 
Human emotions 6.59% Colours 4.46% Food 0.78% 
Seasonal 6.58% Architectural 3.76% Calendar 0.70% 
Numbers 6.19% Products 3.40% Particles 0.59% 
Locations 5.52% Fauna 3.38%   
Human relationships 5.15% Literary 2.66%   

TABLE 3 – Distribution of Wáng Lì’s semantic categories in the Complete Tang Poems, based on 
the 864 example characters provided by Wáng.  They cover 49% of the tokens in the corpus. 

The absolute counts, however, mask some interesting underlying tendencies.  To see the extent to 
which individuals deviate from the average distribution in Table 3, we calculate the z-score for 
each poet’s own distribution.  Further, we compute the TF-IDF of words, considering the 
complete works of each poet as a “document”. 

As shown in Table 4(a), Bái Jūyì wrote more than the average poet on human themes (e.g., ‘Body 
parts’, ‘Food’), and less on ‘Celestial’ and ‘Geographic’, two of the most common categories 
related to nature (Table 3).  This tendency is confirmed by his words with the highest TF-IDF, 
listed in Table 5(a), such as 病 bìng ‘sick’, 衰 shuāi ‘decline’ and 憂 yōu ‘worry’, describing the 
harshness of life.  Another set of high-TF-IDF words involve drinking, such as 杯 bēi ‘glass’, 飲 
yǐn ‘drink’, and 酒 jiǔ ‘wine’.  These statistics concur with the general observation that Bái uses 
the theme of drinking to illustrate his loneliness and miserableness (Zuǒ, 2011). 

Being disrupted by the n Lùsh n Rebellion, Dù Fǔ was known for his anti-war stance, concern 
about his country’s decline, and sympathy for the common people (Lú, 2009).  These themes are 
confirmed by his set of words about warfare and turmoil, listed in Table 5(b), and his relative 
disinterest, like Bái Jūyì, in the common themes in nature – in his case, ‘Seasonal’ and ‘Celestial’.

In contrast, under the pen of the poet Lǐ Bái, ‘Celestial’, already a popular category (Table 3), is 
employed even more frequently. This likely reflects his extensive use of the moon as imagery.  
His poems are also well recognized for vivid colours and the drinking theme (‘Colours’ and 
‘Food’ in Table 4(c)), with the characters 杯 bēi ‘glass’ and 飲 yǐn ‘drink’ achieving some of the 
highest TF-IDF scores. 

Lastly, as shown in Table 4(d), the top category for Wáng Wéi is ‘Particles’, no doubt a result of 
his frequent use of 兮 xī , a particle mainly used in archaic poems.  This is a style of which Wáng 
is known to be fond. 

4.2 Word selection 

We now exploit dependency information to investigate word selections, centering on three 
common areas: the seasons, the cardinal directions, and the colours. 

4.2.1 Seasons 

Among the four seasons, mentions of 春 chūn ‘spring’ and 秋 qiū ‘autumn’ overwhelmingly 
outnumber those of 夏 xià  ‘summer’ and 冬 dōng ‘winter’, by a factor of more than ten to one.  
As seen from the written record in Shang dynasty (circa  BC 17c. − 1046), only “spring” and 
“autumn” were attested in oracle bone inscriptions but “summer” and “winter” were not (Chén, 
1988, p. 226 − 227).  Thus, the discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the concepts of 
‘spring’ and ‘autumn’ are much older, and also that these two seasons were bound up with many 
activities in ancient China.  Given this discrepancy, it is more appropriate to use mutual 
information (MI) than absolute counts to detect significant word selections. 

Notable word co-occurrences with the highest MI are shown in Table 6.  Reflecting the natural 
order, both ‘summer’ and ‘autumn’ are predominately associated with plant words; ‘spring’ is 
associated with significantly fewer ones, and ‘winter’, hardly any.  By the same reasoning, one 
might expect the word 暉 huī ‘sunshine’ to relate most strongly with ‘summer’.  Its relation with 
‘spring’ is in fact stronger since, when poets pay tribute to spring as mother nature, as it were, 
they often depict the spring sun which is gentle, comforting, and caring for the sprouting of the 
plants after a severe winter.  This tribute also explains the high MI of the direction ‘east’ for the 
word 風 fēng ‘wind’ (section 4.2.2), as wind usually blows from the east during spring.  In 
contrast, summer is more frequently described with words such as 酷 kù ‘extreme’ and 暑 shǔ 
‘heat’, rather than ‘sunshine’. 

Since peasants formed the majority of the population (Murphey, 1996, p. 5), agriculture was a 
common way of life.  Agricultural activities were highly regulated by the seasons, and naturally 
the word 耨 nòu ‘raking’ is significantly related with ‘spring’, and 稼 jià  ‘harvest’ with ‘autumn’.  
Another major means of subsistence was hunting, especially in the winter, when cooked meat 
was especially coveted.  It is no coincidence that 狩 shòu ‘hunting’ has the highest MI with 
‘winter’. 

There are two words that both mean ‘sleep’, namely 睡 shuì and 蟄 zhé.  A glance at Table 6, 
however, shows that the former is highly correlated with ‘spring’, whereas the latter with ‘winter’.  
The reason is that shuì in general refers to humans, while zhé refers to animals, which tend to go 
into hibernation during winter. 

626



Scholars were not immune from seasonal cycles, either.  National examinations were held 
annually at the capital city, and passing these exams was critical in climbing the career ladder.  
Since the examinations were held in spring, the words 闈 wéi ‘examination’ and 榜 bǎng ‘result’ 
only collocate with that season.  Candidates who failed the examination sometimes stayed in the 
capital to take remedial lessons, therefore 課 kè ‘lesson’ is often modified by ‘summer’.

TABLE 6 – Characters with the highest mutual information (MI) with each of the four seasons.  
Two characters are considered to co-occur when they are connected by a dependency relation.  

Characters occurring less than 10 times are excluded. 

4.2.2 Cardinal directions 

Like the seasons, the four cardinal directions – 東 dōng ‘east’, 南 nán ‘south’,西 xī ‘west’, and 
北 běi ‘north’ – appear frequently in poems, contributing the bulk of the counts towards the 
category ‘Locations’.  Table 7 lists several sets of words with similar meaning but drastically 
different co-occurrences with the directions.  They reveal facets of culture, history and geography 
of Ancient China. 

Geography.  The verbs 流 liú ‘flow’ and 逝 shì ‘pass’ both like to head eastward.  In China, most 
rivers flow from mountains in the west towards the Pacific Ocean in the east.  Since liú and shì 
tend to be associated with rivers, ‘east’ is the natural direction for them.  Now, given that the 
ocean is located in the east, one might wonder why 海 hǎi ‘sea’ has such high MI with ‘north’. In 
fact, in most contexts, the term refers to the remote area in the north far away from the central 

627



plain. Likewise, 南國 nánguó ‘south country’ refers to the remote area in the south, and so 南省 
nánshěng ‘south province’. 

History. The words 都 dū and 京 jīng both mean ‘capital’, yet they have diametrically opposing 
directions, namely ‘east’ and ‘west’.  In many dynasties, China had a main capital in the west and 
also a secondary capital in the east; for example, in the Tang dynasty, they were Cháng’ n and 
Luòyáng, respectively.  The word jīng usually refers to the main capital, while dū refers to the 
secondary. Since the Tang capital was located in the west, when an emperor went out on a 巡 xún 
‘patrol’ to tour his domain, he was likely to go ‘east’ or ‘south’.  Also, seen from the capital, 
barbarians on the fringes of the empire were labelled with the name of the tribe that dwelled in 
that direction during the archaic period.  These were 狄 dí in the north, 蠻 mán in the south, 戎 
rúng in the west, and 夷 yí in the east or south. 

Architecture. The distributions of the cardinal directions also tell us about architectural design.  
While ‘east’ and ‘west’ are the dominant directions of 廂 xiāng ‘side-room’, ‘north’ has the 
highest MI with 堂 táng ‘hall’.  The reason lies with the design of quadrangle courtyards, a 
common type of residence in ancient China.  In a typical courtyard, the main house, or hall, faced 
the north, while the side-rooms were located along the east-west axes. Furthermore, a small 
building is often built in the west for moon-viewing.  Hence, the word 樓 lóu ‘building’ is most 
likely to be modified by ‘west’.

information. Two characters are considered to co-occur when they are connected by a 

dependency relation.  Characters occurring less than 10 times are excluded. 

628



4.2.3 Colours 

Two common words in Classical Chinese both refer to the black colour, namely, 黑 hēi and 玄 
xuán. The former tends to be used in negative contexts, and the latter one in positive ones, 
sometimes indicating an auspicious sign (Yìng, 2004, p.13). 

To verify this hypothesis, we compute the mutual information (MI) of characters co-occurring 
with hēi or xuán. Table 8 lists those characters with the highest MI.  Most co-occurrences with 
xuán involve an exalted or noble entity, such as 玄圃  xuánpǔ ‘palace of the gods’, 玄貺 
xuánkuàng ‘present from emperor’, 玄豹 xuánbào ‘leopard’ (a rare and thus valuable animal), 玄
宗 xuánzōng ‘idea on Buddhism’, and 玄晏 xuányàn ‘ritual’. In contrast, those involving hēi are 
mostly everyday objects (e.g., ‘rice’) including some with negative sentiment such as 黑紗 
hēishā ‘funeral cloth’ and 黑蛺 hēijiá  ‘bug’.  These observations lend evidence to the usage of 
these two characters described in (Yìng, 2004).

Conclusion and Perspectives 

This paper presents textual analysis on the entire Complete Tang Poems.  We described the 
overall semantic range of the corpus, as well as the semantic profiles of various poets, via a 
semantic classification scheme and TF-IDF scores.  We then used dependency relations and 
mutual information to investigate word selections involving the four seasons, the four cardinal 
directions and the black colour.  Our observations lend statistical evidence to previous scholarly 
assertions, but also reveal aspects of Chinese geography, history, and architecture. 

Our analyses represent a new avenue of scholarly enquiry over this treasure trove of Classical 
Chinese, but they have touched only the tip of an iceberg.  It is hoped that the automatically 
produced treebank will provide useful syntactic features for other research topics, such as the 
readability of poems (Zh ng et al., 2009) and authorship questions (Matsuoka, 2003).
