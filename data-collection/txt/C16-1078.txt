Abstract

Finding authentic examples of grammatical constructions is central in constructionist approaches
to linguistics, language processing, and second language learning. In this paper, we address
this problem as an information retrieval (IR) task. To facilitate research in this area, we built a
benchmark collection by annotating the occurrences of six constructions in a Swedish corpus.
Furthermore, we implemented a simple and flexible retrieval system for finding construction
occurrences, in which the user specifies a ranking function using lexical-semantic similarities
(lexicon-based or distributional). The system was evaluated using standard IR metrics on the
new benchmark, and we saw that lexical-semantical rerankers improve significantly over a purely
surface-oriented system, but must be carefully tailored for each individual construction.

1 Introduction

Linguistic theories based on the notion of constructions are a recent development in linguistics, which
has revitalized the discussion in fields such as syntax, lexicography, and argument structure theory. In
particular, it is useful for describing partially schematic constructions: templatic patterns that exhibit
lexical as well as syntactic properties, which are too specific to be referred to general grammar rules,
but too general to be attributed to specific lexical units, which is a reason why they historically have
been overlooked (Fillmore et al., 1988). These constructions are very frequent, and they are not only
theoretically interesting but also important in language teaching (De Knoop and Gilquin, 2016), since
they are challenging for second language learners (Prentice and Sköldberg, 2011).

So far, despite the importance of construction-based theory in linguistics and language pedagogy, it has
seen limited adoption in natural language processing. A major impediment to their acceptance is proba-
bly the lack of resources of a nontrivial size. Efforts to build inventories of this kind – constructicons –
are now underway for a number of languages. The emerging practice of constructicon development, or
constructicography, can be seen as a combination of construction grammar and lexicography (Fillmore
et al., 2012). A crucial requirement for constructicon building is access to corpus search tools allowing
constructicographers to search for occurrences of constructions: either for finding prototypical examples
(Gries, 2003), or for computing statistics such as word–construction cooccurrence (Stefanowitsch and
Gries, 2003). Also, for the reasons mentioned above, finding authentic examples of uses of a particular
construction is also useful in language teaching situations.

In this paper, we cast the task of searching for construction occurrences as an information retrieval
(IR) problem. This is fruitful in construction-based research and constructicography for a number of
reasons. First, while a partially schematic construction can have a surface form that is easy to describe
as a structural pattern, its exact semantic properties and restrictions can be hard to capture as a clear-
cut binary decision, or may not even be known a priori. This makes it natural to re-rank corpus hits
according to a semantics-based scoring function. Such an approach allows a researcher to explore the
spectrum of search hits, from the most prototypical – which a good retrieval system should place near
the top – to the more unusual cases. Also, the IR perspective is natural in terms of interaction: a user

can pose queries, rank and re-rank repeatedly according to different functions defined on the fly, to get a
comprehensive overview of the various uses of a construction in a corpus.

To open up new opportunities for research in construction retrieval, we built a benchmark collection
by annotating the occurrences of six different partially schematic constructions defined in the Swedish
Constructicon (Sköldberg et al., 2013). This allows us to explore different retrieval systems and evaluate
them according to standard IR evaluation protocols, and we developed a construction retrieval system that
finds occurrences of partially schematic constructions in Swedish corpora, based on flexible user-defined
ranking functions using lexicon-based and distributional similarities to describe the construction’s slot
fillers. These ranking functions are learned from a small number of seed examples. Our results show that
ranking functions based on lexical-semantic properties are effective, outperforming a purely surface-
based baseline for all six constructions. However, because the constructions are so structurally and
semantically diverse, we cannot expect a single ranking function to be the best in all cases, and in practice
we observed considerable difference among constructions as to which similarities are most useful. This
shows that it is crucial for the ranking functions to be flexible and user-defined, which also makes most
sense from a usability perspective.

2 Construction Grammar and the Swedish Constructicon

In terms of linguistic theory, the approach is couched in Construction Grammar, for which the afore-
mentioned abundance of semi-general and partially schematic patterns is a key motivation, and where
intermingling of linguistic levels is seen as the norm, not the exception. Rejecting the sharp distinc-
tion between lexicon and grammar, constructionists regard grammatical rules, lexical idiosyncrasies and
“mixed” patterns alike as constructions: “conventional, learned form–function pairings at varying levels
of complexity and abstraction” (Goldberg 2013, p17). A methodological benefit of assuming the same
kind of unit across the board is that the machinery required to account for patterns with both grammatical
and lexical properties can also handle those that are purely grammatical or purely lexical, another that
the absence of distinct levels eliminates the problem of borderline cases (Fillmore et al., 1988).

Applying this view to descriptive practice, a constructicon is a collection of construction descriptions,
a “dictionary of constructions.” First introduced for English (Fillmore et al., 2012), there are now con-
structicon resources under development for a number of languages, including Swedish (Sköldberg et al.,
2013; Lyngfelt et al., forthcoming), Brazilian Portuguese (Torrent et al., 2014), and Japanese (Ohara,
2013). The Swedish Constructicon currently covers around 400 constructions, many of which are par-
tially schematic patterns of the kind that is hard to account for from a grammatical or lexical perspective
alone. Hence, offering a wide and relevant selection of constructions, it provides a suitable testing ground
for the study at hand.

To exemplify the organization of the Swedish Constructicon, Figure 1 shows the most important parts
of its entry for V REFL.RÖRELSE (REFLEXIVE MOTION), a frequent construction in which motion is
expressed using a verb with a reflexive pronoun. The entry contains a definition of the construction,
that presents its structure and semantics textually, a structure sketch describing its surface structure in a
semi-formal way, and a small number of annotated examples from corpora that show typical uses of the
construction.

Name V REFL.RÖRELSE
Definition [An actor]ACTOR , expressed with a [reflexive]REFL, [moves]V [in a direction, traverses a path,

from a place or to a place]LOCATIVE . The verb usually describes the manner of the motion. The
construction also encompasses actions that indicate intended motion and non-motion.

3 Related work

While we are aware of no previous work approaching the general problem of searching for construction
occurrences from a retrieval perspective, quantitative and corpus-based methods have been a crucial
part of the construction-linguistic toolbox from its early days (Gries, 2003; Stefanowitsch and Gries,
2003; Hilpert, 2013). In particular, a number of automatic methods have been presented that mine
corpora for frequent patterns. For instance, Wible and Tsao (2010) collected generalized n-grams (that
is, combinations of words, PoS tags and phrase labels) and applied standard measures of collocational
strength to select n-grams that seem to be recurrent patterns. The Swedish constructicon project used
similar methods (Forsberg et al., 2014), but also extended the approach by Wible and Tsao (2010) by
considering patterns containing phrase labels (e.g. NP-and-NP, as-Adj-as-NP).

The only related work we found that treats the construction detection as a ranking task is by Dubremetz
and Nivre (2015), who used a ranking approach to retrieve occurrences of the rare rhetorical chiasmus
construction. They preferred ranking over classification since the complexity of this construction and
the number of borderline cases made a hard classification infeasible, and similarly to our position, they
argued that the existence of borderline cases should be embraced instead of ignored. However, since
their work is limited to searching for just chiasmi, their system was completely tailored for this case.

4 A benchmark collection for evaluating construction retrieval systems

We built a new benchmark for evaluating construction retrieval systems based on six different construc-
tions defined in the Swedish Constructicon. The selected constructions are nontrivial in the sense that
their formal description cannot be translated into a standard corpus search query (based on surface fea-
tures such as words or part-of-speech tags) that captures exactly their true instances – for instance, oc-
currences of the well-studied let alone construction (Fillmore et al., 1988) are easy to spot in corpora.

The initial pass of creating the benchmark was to extract a collection of potential instances for each of
the six constructions. We extracted these instances by querying the Korp corpus search engine, hosted
by the Swedish Language Bank (Borin et al., 2012). Korp stores a large collection of corpora, currently
around 10 billion tokens, and allows structural queries based on surface strings but also several types
of linguistic annotation; for this experiment, we used a corpus of contemporary fiction. The web ser-
vice of Korp allows users to pose queries using the CQP language (Christ, 1994), and we selected the
instances by translating the structure sketch (as in the example in Figure 1) of each construction into
a corresponding CQP query. The corpus search engine then returns a (possibly very large) number of
hits, and depending on the formal properties of the construction, fixed lexical content, variable tokens,
or syntactic restrictions of particular slots, this list is ‘contaminated’ to some extent by unrelated hits.

Each collection of hits was then annotated manually as true or false instances of the construction in
question. Table 1 shows the number of hits for each query, and the number of true hits among them.

Construction Total hits True hits
V av NP 501 169
PROPORTION i/om 1703 205
REFLEXIVE MOTION 1300 338
QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME 945 97
QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE 945 166
BOUNDED EVENT på 2000 43

Table 1: Statistics for the benchmark.

In the following, we detail the six constructions used to create the benchmark.1

4.1 V av NP
V av NP is a causal VP construction where the event or state expressed by the verb is caused by the
bare noun following the preposition av ‘of’. It includes both literal and metaphorical causative relations
such as stinka av mögel ‘stink of mold’ and dö av skam ‘die of shame’ but the formal surface description

1For clarity, we refer to the constructions by translating their Swedish names into English in the rest of this paper, except
for construction-evoking keywords included in the names.

817



V av NPBARE also catches phrasal verbs such as dra av moms ‘subtract sales tax’ and passive voice
constructions like läses av flickor ‘is read by girls’. The variable construction slots are not restricted to
any obvious semantic classes, although emotions and physical states are clearly salient at first glance.

4.2 PROPORTION i/om

PROPORTION i/om is a rate construction that combines two entities, a numerator and a denominator,
joined by the preposition i ‘in’ or om ‘about’, and is restricted to temporal relations such as frequency
and speed, and salary rates also fit into this scheme. Its structure sketch NPINDEF [i | om] NDEF catches
true instances such as två gånger om dagen ’two times a day’ and åttio pesos i månaden ‘eighty pesos a
month’, as well as false positives such as tio dagar i fängelset ‘ten days in jail’.

4.3 REFLEXIVE MOTION

As mentioned in Section 2, REFLEXIVE MOTION is a self-motion construction where an actor expressed
with a reflexive traverses a path in a direction from a place or towards a goal. The verb typically describes
the means or manner of the motion, while the prepositional/adverbial phrase contributes the direction.
The formal description V PNREFL [PP | ADVP] captures prototypical occurrences like sätta sig ned
‘sit down’ and ta sig fram ‘make one’s way’ as well as instances with verbs that do not usually indicate
motion, like svetta sig igenom ‘sweat one’s way through’ and läsa sig bakåt ‘read one’s way backwards’.
False hits in the search result include common reflexive verbs that do not express motion, like känna sig
glad ‘feel happy’ and anförtro sig åt ‘confide in’ as well as certain lexicalized multiword expressions
like tränga sig på ‘intrude’ and sätta sig på tvären ‘be obstinate’.

4.4 QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME

The QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction is defined as a genitive modifier that specifies the
duration of an activity. The formal description DET NGEN NINDEF captures true instances of the con-
struction such as en stunds tystnad ‘a moment’s silence’, but also the related scale construction fem
meters djup ‘five meter’s depth’ (described below), as well as other genitives like en människas skugga
‘the shadow of a human’.

4.5 QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE

The scale construction QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE is the sibling of the time construction described
above. Here, the genitive modifier specifies the value on a scale expressed by the noun phrase. It shares
the formal description DET NGEN NINDEF with QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME but is semantically
restricted to scalable measures like height, depth, age, size and other things that can be quantified. Con-
sequently, the query captures true instances of the scale construction like tusen meters höjd ‘a thousand
meter’s height’ and elva månaders hyra ‘eleven month’s rent’, but also instances of the aforementioned
time construction tre timmars seglats ‘three hour’s sailing trip’. Again, other genitive phrases like en
kvinnas fot ‘the foot of a woman’ also end up in the search batch.

4.6 BOUNDED EVENT på

The BOUNDED EVENT på construction is a time expression that modifies the duration in time of a com-
pleted action, expressed using the preposition på, corresponding to the similar English construction using
in. It is a specific and rather restricted instance of a more general pattern for prepositional time adver-
bials. The construction can only be used with events of bounded aspect, and thereby specifies the time
required to complete the event. A related but separate construction is used for negated events, where time
adverbials with på can be used to describe the duration that has passed since an event took place; this
construction is called SPECIFIED TIME:POLARITY. The structure sketch på NP naturally translates to a
search query that captures all prepositional phrases with the preposition på, and even though the noun
slot is strictly restricted to time expressions it is impossible to delimit it from related time constructions
without taking the wider context into account. The search hits include true instances of the construction
such as rummet tömdes på några sekunder ‘the room was emptied in a few seconds’ as well as false

818



instances like the negative construction ingen hade samlat ved på ett år ‘nobody had been collecting
firewood for a year’. However, most of the answer set consists of typical PPs like på en stol ‘on a chair’.

5 Construction retrieval with lexical-semantic reranking

The new benchmark allows us to investigate and compare different systems for retrieving occurrences
of constructions in corpora. We now describe the implementation of a retrieval system for finding oc-
currences of constructions: in particular, we discuss how the ranking function is defined, including the
various lexical-semantic similarities the user can choose from, and how the ranking function is trained
from a few user-selected seed examples.

The system is built on top of the corpus search service Korp, described in Section 4. This is the most
comprehensive service of this kind for Swedish, but any similar search tool could be used if building a
similar retrieval system for other languages. As when creating the benchmark, the first step of searching
for occurrences is to call the underlying corpus search system with a query that describes the surface form
of the construction (corresponding to the structure sketch in Figure 1). For instance, if we are looking for
occurrences of the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction (e.g. an hour’s rest), we use a query
corresponding to its structure sketch DET NGEN NINDEF. A number of hits are then returned, out of
which some are instances of the construction we are looking for, while others are unrelated. For instance,
the structural pattern mentioned above will match any genitive, such as a dog’s life.

To address this problem, we apply a reranking function. The user is asked to provide the system with
two additional types of information: (1) a number of positive seed examples of sentences containing true
instances of the construction she is looking for and (2) what linguistic properties to consider for particular
slots in the search string. For instance, a user could say that the ranking function should consider the
distributional similarity function based on the second word in the hit, e.g. the time word in the example
above, and then select a number of occurrences such as an hour’s rest, three years’ study. With a
carefully designed ranking function and representative seed examples, the system can rank time/activity
expressions above other expressions matching that surface pattern.

5.1 Training the reranking function
The reranker is a scoring function R(x) applied to each hit x returned by the corpus search. Learning
rankers is widely studied in IR (Liu, 2009); in this work, we assume that each hit x can be analyzed using
m different similarity functions σj , selected by the user on the fly. Assuming there are labeled examples
x1, . . . , xn, we write the ranker as

R(x) =
n∑

i=1

m∑
j=1

αijσj(x, xi)

where αij is a weight representing the contribution of similarity σj applied to the labeled example xi. If
the σj are valid kernels, this is the dual form of a linear scoring function, and the αij can be determined
by training a kernelized learner such as the ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002). We prefer to use a simpler
learning method that is efficient and that works with just a few examples. For these reasons, we set the
weights by computing the centroid of the positively labeled instances: that is, by setting all αij to 1/n.
This method has trivial computation time and allows the use of any similarity function, not just kernels.
More complex learners for this scenario, e.g. the one-class SVM (Manevitz and Yousef, 2001), may be
considered in future work, and we could also imagine the weights being set manually by the users.

5.2 Similarity functions used in the reranker
The corpus search system takes care of basic surface-oriented features (word forms, morphology, gram-
matical functions and categories), so the central task of the reranker is to use representations of word
meaning to go beyond the simple structural information. We investigate different measures: similarities
based on hand-crafted lexicons, and distributional similarity computed from corpora.

5.2.1 Network-based similarity
SALDO (Borin et al., 2013) is a large lexical resource that connects senses of Swedish words into a
hierarchical semantic network. To measure similarity between two SALDO entries, we use the measure

819



by Wu and Palmer (1994), based on proximity in the tree and the depth of the lowest common ancestor.
This measure is a number between 1 and 0, where 1 is the score for two identical entries. A complication
is that our corpora lacks sense annotation; however, since the first sense dominates overwhelmingly in
corpora for most lemmas (Johansson et al., 2016), we use the first sense to compute the similarities.

5.2.2 Frame-based similarity
An alternative lexicon-based similarity function is based on the Swedish FrameNet (Friberg Heppin and
Toporowska Gronostaj, 2012). This resource, similar to its English counterpart (Fillmore and Baker,
2009), maps lemmas to one or more frames, which for the current purposes can be seen as semantic
classes. Intuitively, two words have a similar meaning if they belong to the same frame; for instance,
timme ‘hour’ and minut ‘minute’ are related because they both belong to the frame CALENDRIC UNIT.
Again, we have to deal with the lack of word sense annotation in the corpora, so we define the similarity
to be 1 if the two words share at least one frame, and 0 otherwise.

5.2.3 Distributional similarity
In a distributional model (Turney and Pantel, 2010), the meaning representation of a word is computed
by observing the contexts in which it appears in a corpus. This is represented as a vector, which makes
it possible to apply geometric operations – most importantly, to compute a word similarity by using a
function such as the cosine. We trained word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on a 1-billion mixed corpus,
preprocessed by lemmatization and compound splitting. We used the default settings, except the dimen-
sionality which was set to 512. To compute the similarity between two words, we applied the cosine to
their lemma vectors.2 Again, this similarity is at most 1, which happens if the vectors are identical.

6 Experiments

We first investigated the effect of the choice of lexical similarity. Table 2 shows the average precision
scores for three different similarities: Wu–Palmer in SALDO, frame-based, and distributional. As a base-
line we include a lemma-based similarity corresponding to a simple search with a number of specified
lemmas in the variable construction slots (that is, we get exactly what we asked for and nothing else). As
seed examples, the rerankers were trained on the first 15 positively labeled instances in the collection.

Construction lemma SALDO frame distributional
V av NP 0.69 0.73 0.63 0.86
PROPORTION i/om 0.64 0.68 0.95 0.74
REFLEXIVE MOTION 0.59 0.53 0.61 0.56
QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME 0.40 0.48 0.60 0.49
QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE 0.64 0.63 0.52 0.68
BOUNDED EVENT på 0.43 0.51 0.36 0.60

Table 2: Effect of the choice of lexical similarity function.

The result clearly shows that reranking based on a lexical-semantic model can give very strong im-
provement over the lemma-based baseline. However, it should be noted that there is considerable varia-
tion in the result. For instance, for PROPORTION i/om and QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME, the frame-
based reranker outperforms the others significantly. As we will see in the detailed analysis, a likely expla-
nation is that the slot fillers in these constructions have well-defined semantic restrictions that correspond
cleanly to FrameNet frames, in particular time-related words (frames such as Calendric unit and Mea-
sure duration). In the case of V av NP, QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE and BOUNDED EVENT på
it is instead the distributional model that works best. The distributional model seems to work best when
the slot fillers are not restricted to a narrowly defined semantic class (corresponding to a FrameNet
frame), but instead belong to a broader semantic domain, like emotional states for V av NP.

The network-based lexicon similarity does better than the baseline in most cases, but never outper-
forms the other similarities. It is difficult to speculate about why, but we can at least conclude that
FrameNet frames are better at capturing narrowly defined semantic classes and distributional models do
better at generalizing beyond taxonomic similarity scores.

2We pick the first lemma if lemmatization is ambiguous.

6.1 Qualitative evaluation

We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the system by analyzing each construction search separately.
The reranked instances were inspected with a particular focus on false positives, which are telling indi-
cators of the shortcomings of our approach. We will also inspect the lower regions of the reranked list
and say something about false negatives – true occurrences that end up near the bottom of the reranked
search list. This qualitative evaluation is telling, since it may also exemplify how a constructicographer
would describe delimiting characteristics of specific constructions.

6.1.1 V av NP
We expected the V av NP construction (e.g. rodna av ilska ‘blush with anger’) to be a hard nut to crack
because of its great productivity and high lexical variation, but the distributional similarity performs
beyond expectations. In particular, this model succeeds in generalizing beyond seen instances and gives
high ranking scores to a wide array of new and creative occurrences of the V av NP construction.

Although there are no distinct semantic restrictions on the variable slots of the V av NP constructions,
the state or event caused by the noun is typically physical or emotional. Representative verbs include
darra ’shiver’, lida ’suffer’, dö ’die’, gråta ’cry’, rodna ’blush’, skälva ’quiver’, kvida ’whimper’, flåsa
’pant’ and skaka ’shake’. The noun slot is typically occupied by event nouns such as raseri ’rage’,
smärta ’pain’, ansträngning ’exertion’, ängslan ’anxiety’, migrän ’migraine’, förälskelse ’infatuation’
and upphetsning ’excitement’. The distributional model excels in finding commonalities between these
words, while the frame-based similarity is too restricted. The slot fillers display so much lexical variation
that the frame-semantic lexicon manages to capture just a fraction of them.

6.1.2 PROPORTION i/om
As mentioned above, it is hardly surprising that the search system is good at detecting the PROPOR-
TION i/om construction or that the best performing similarity feature in this case is frame-based. The
rate construction (e.g. tre gånger om dagen ‘three times a day’) is strictly restricted to temporal relations,
so the denominator will always be a time-related word belonging to a few well-defined frames.

6.1.3 REFLEXIVE MOTION
The evaluation results for REFLEXIVE MOTION (e.g. pressa sig ut ‘press oneself out’) are unimpressive.
None of the rankers are particularly good at detecting this construction: the frame-based reranker just
barely beats the baseline. When inspecting the results, it seems that there is too much diversity in this
set, with creative metaphors frequently used, for the lexical models to be very effective.

On a lighter note, while this construction is diverse, we observed that some subsets of the occurrences
can be handled nicely: if we are particularly interested in occurrences of the REFLEXIVE MOTION con-
struction where the verb has a more specific manner meaning, we can handpick seed examples of that
kind. By doing so, sentences like (1) rise to the top of the answer set. This means that even if the overall
score is low, the user can still use the search system productively to find a certain important subclass.

6.1.4 QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME
For the time construction QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME (e.g. två timmars vila ‘two hours’ rest’), the
frame-based reranker clearly outperforms the other similarity functions in this case since the construction
is restricted to time expressions, which we have already seen fit neatly into a few particular frames. Since
time expressions are such a strong feature for detecting this construction, it comes as no surprise that false
positives near the top of the ranked list contain time words as well. Example (2) is a false hit that is in
fact an instance of the superficially similar QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE construction.

6.1.5 QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE
The lexical similarities give a smaller improvement for the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:SCALE than for
the related time construction. In particular, while the frame-based feature worked best for the time
construction, it receives the lowest average precision in this case. The scalable measures that turn up
here are diverse and do not seem to correspond neatly with FrameNet frames.

The distributional similarity does best at generalizing beyond seen examples, and quite impressively
hands out high ranking scores to instances as diverse as 50 procents chans ‘50 percent chance’, två veck-
ors skäggstubb ‘two weeks’ stubble’ and tre spalters bredd ‘three columns’ width’. The precision starts
to drop when false hits from the QUANTIFYING GENITIVE:TIME construction and other constructions
start to appear.

6.1.6 BOUNDED EVENT på
Even though this construction (e.g. på två timmar ‘for two hours’) is strictly restricted to time related
words, the frame-based reranker performs worst in the evaluation. The explanation is quite straightfor-
ward; just spotting the time word is not enough to disambiguate BOUNDED EVENT på from related time
constructions: most of the information that could be used to discriminate can be found outside of the hit.
Recall that BOUNDED EVENT på only occurs with events of bounded lexical aspect.

Since we had little hope that the reranker would be effective for such a contextually dependent con-
struction as BOUNDED EVENT på, it is a pleasant surprise to see that the distributional model is doing
significantly better than the baseline. A possible explanation is that there are lexical preferences at play,
beyond the more general time restriction. Short time spans like på ett ögonblick ‘in an instant’ seem
more likely to be instances of this construction than cases such as på en söndag ’on a Sunday’. Among
the top-ranked false positives, we find quite a few hits with the lexicalized phrase på en gång ’at once’.

Introducing more contextual information seems necessary for dealing successfully with a construction
like this one. However, in this particular case it is not entirely clear how to determine the lexical aspect
of the event in an automated fashion. A more straightforward feature to introduce would be negations
that can be relatively easily spotted by using a list of negative polarity items.

7 Discussion

We considered the problem of searching for occurrences of a grammatical construction as a retrieval
problem, and we created a new benchmark collection with annotated examples for six different construc-
tions defined by the Swedish constructicon. This new resource allows us to investigate the effectiveness
of different retrieval models. As a proof of concept, we presented a simple interactive architecture for
searching for constructions, where a user provides a number of positive examples (occurrences of the
construction) and tailors a ranking function based on a user-defined combination of features, and our
benchmark enabled us to carry out detailed quantitative and qualitative investigations of the effect of dif-
ferent models of lexical representation on the retrieval performance of this system. All our experiments
were carried out using Swedish, because of the availability of the Swedish Constructicon used to select
the constructions in the benchmark, but our approach is general and could be ported to other languages,
including English: similar corpus search tools and lexical resources are readily available.

As expected, grammatical constructions are diverse and the ranking function must be tailored for
each construction. The most consistent result is that lexical-semantic models based on a constructions’
slot fillers improve the reranker, but exactly which of them – lexicon-based or distributional – is most
effective depends on the construction. It is important to note that the accuracy of the reranker depends on
the construction definition and to which extent such semantic restrictions are in fact at play. The system
should therefore be useful in the work of characterizing and defining constructions.

As we have already pointed out in the text, there are several ways to extend this work: more complex
learning algorithms for the rankers could be considered, or we could make use of information beyond
the slot fillers of the construction. Also, we have now studied the retrieval problem in isolation, but since
our main motivation is that the system should be used in the practical work of linguists working with
construction grammar, it would be interesting to investigate the usability and interaction aspect as well.
