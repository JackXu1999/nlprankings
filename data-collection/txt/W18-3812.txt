Abstract* 

In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian Languages: Am-

haric, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Ge’ez. To check the usability of all the corpora we 

conducted baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation (SMT) experiments for seven 

language pairs. The performance of the bi-directional SMT systems shows that all the corpora 

can be used for further investigations. We have also shown that the morphological complexity 

of the Ethio-Semitic languages has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially 

when they are target languages. Based on the results we obtained, we are currently working 

towards handling the morphological complexities to improve the performance of statistical ma-

chine translation among the Ethiopian languages.

1 Introduction 

The advancement of technology and the rise of the internet as a means of communication led to an ever-

increasing demand for Natural Language Processing (NLP) Applications. NLP applications are useful 

in facilitating human-human communication via computing systems. One of the NLP applications which 

facilitate human-human communication is Machine Translation. Machine Translation (MT) refers to a 

process by which computer software is used to translate a text from one language to another (Koehn, 

2009). In the presence of high volume digital text, the ideal aim of machine translation systems is to 

produce the best possible translation with minimal human intervention (Hutchins, 2005). 

The translation of natural language by machine becomes a reality, for technologically favored 

languages, in the late 20th century although it is dreamt since the seventieth century (Hutchins, 

1995). Various approaches to MT have been and are being used in the research community. These 

approaches are broadly classified into rule based and corpus-based MT (Koehn, 2009). The rule-

based machine translation demands various kinds of linguistic re- sources such as morphological 

analyzer and synthesizer, syntactic parsers, semantic analyzers and so on. On the other hand, corpus-

based approaches (as the name implies) require parallel and monolingual corpora. Since corpus-based ap-

proaches do not require deep linguistic analysis of the source and target languages, it is the preferred 

approach for under-resourced languages of the world, including Ethiopian languages. 

1.1 Machine Translation for Ethiopian Languages 

Research in the development of MT has been conducted for technologically favored and economically 

as well as politically important languages of the world since the 17th century. As a result, notable pro-

gress towards the development and use of MT systems has been made for these languages. However, 

research in the area of MT for Ethiopian languages, which are under-resourced as well as economically 

and technologically disadvantaged, has started very recently. Most of the researches on MT for Ethiopian 

languages are conducted by graduate students (Tariku, 2004; Sisay, 2009; Eleni, 2013; Jabesa, 2013; 

Akubazgi, 2017), including two PhD works: one that tried to integrate Amharic into a unification-based 

machine translation system (Sisay, 2004) and the other that investigated English-Amharic Statistical 

Machine translation (Mulu, 2017). Beside this, Michael and Million (Michael and Million, 2017) exper-

imented a bi-directional Amharic-Tigrigna SMT system using word and morpheme as a unit. 

Due to unavailability of linguistic resources and since the most widely used MT approach is 

statistical, most of these researches have been conducted using statistical machine translation 

(SMT), which requires large bilingual and monolingual corpora. However, as there were no such 

corpora for SMT experiments for Ethiopian languages, the researchers had to prepare their own 

small size corpora for their experiment. This in turn, affects the results that they obtain. 

In addition, since there are no standard corpora for conducting replicable and consistent experi-

ments for performance evaluation, it is difficult to know the progress made in the area for local 

languages. Moreover, since the researchers had to spend their time on corpora preparation, they 

usually have limited time for experimentation, exploration and development of MT systems. 

1.2 Motivation of this Paper  

African languages, which contribute around 30% (2139) of the world language highly suffer from the 

lack of sufficient language resources (Simons and Fennig, 2017). This is true for Ethiopian languages. 

On the other hand, Ethiopia being a multilingual and multi-ethnic country, its constitution decrees that 

each citizen has the right to speak, write and develop in his/her own language. However, there is still a 

need to share information among citizens who speak different languages. For example, Amharic is the 

regional language of the Amhara and Southern Nations and Nationalities regions, Afan-Oromo is that 

of the Oromia region while the Tigray region uses Tigrigna. All these regions produce a lot of infor-

mation that need to be shared among the other regions of the nation. There is, therefore, a lot of transla-

tion demands among the different language communities of the federal government of Ethiopia. 

In order to enable the citizens of the country to use the documents and the information produced 

in other Ethiopian languages, the documents need to be translated to the languages they understand 

most. Since manual translation is expensive, a promising alternative is the use of machine trans-

lation, particularly SMT as Ethiopian languages suffer from lack of basic linguistic resources such 

as morphological analyser, syntactic analyser, morphological synthesizer, etc. The major and basic 



85

resource required for SMT is parallel corpora, which are not available for Ethiopian languages. 

The collection and preparation of parallel corpora for Ethiopian languages is, therefore, an im-

portant endeavour to facilitate future MT research and development. 

We have, therefore, collected and prepared parallel corpora for seven Ethiopian Language pairs 

taking representatives from the Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic language families. We have consid-

ered Amharic, Tigrigna and Ge’ez from the Semitic, Afan-Oromo from the Cushitic and Wolaytta 

from Omotic language families. This paper, therefore, describes the parallel corpora we collected 

and prepared for these Ethiopian languages and the SMT experiments conducted using the corpora 

as a way of verifying their usability. 

2 Nature of the Language Pairs 

The language pairs in the corpora belong to Semitic (Ge’ez, Amharic and Tigrigna), Cushitic (Afan-

Oromo) and Omotic (Wolaytta) language families. Except Ge’ez, these languages have native speakers. 

Ge’ez serves as a liturgical language of Ethiopian Orthodox Church. It is thought as a second language 

in the traditional schools of the church and given as a course in different Universities. There is a rich 

body of literature in Ge’ez, including philosophical, medical and astrological writings. Because of 

this, there is a big initiative in translating the documents written in Ge’ez to other widely used 

languages. On the other hand, Amharic is spoken by more than 27 million people which makes it 

the second most spoken Semitic language in the world. Tigrigna is spoken by 9 million people. 

Afan-Oromo and Wolaytta are spoken by more than 34 million and 2 million speakers, respectively 

(Simons and Fennig, 2017). 

The writing systems of these language pairs are Ge’ez or Ethiopic script and Latin alphabet. 

Ge’ez, Amharic and Tigrigna are written in Ge’ez script whereas both Afan-Oromo and Wolaytta 

are written in Latin alphabet. It is believed that the earliest known writing in the Ge’ez script date 

back to the 5th century BC. The Ge’ez script is syllabary in which each character represents a 

consonant and a vowel. Each character gets its basic shape from the consonant of the syllable, and 

the vowel is represented through systematic modifications of the basic shape. The script is also 

used to write other languages like Argobba, Harari, Gurage, etc. 

The language pairs have got different functions in the country. Amharic for instance is the work-

ing language of the Federal Government of Ethiopia. It also serves as regional working language 

of some other regional states. It facilitates inter-regional communication. Tigrigna and Afan-

Oromo are working languages in Tigray and Oromia regional administrations, respectively. Apart 

from this, they serve as medium of instructions in primary and secondary schools. These languages 

are also used widely in the electronic media like news, blogs and social media. Some of the gov-

ernmental websites are available in Amharic, Tigrigna and Afan-Oromo. Currently, Google offers 

a searching capability using these Ethiopian languages. Further, Google also included Amharic in 

its translation service recently. 

2.1 Morphological Features 

Like other Semitic languages, Ge’ez (Dillmann and Bezold, 1907), Amharic (Leslau, 2000; 

Anbessa and Hudson, 2007) and Tigrigna (Mason, 1996; Yohannes, 2002), make use of the root 

and pattern system. In these languages, a root (which is called a radical) is a set of consonants 

which bears the basic meaning of the lexical item whereas a pattern is composed of a set of vowels 

inserted between the consonants of the root. These vowel patterns together with affixes results in 

derived words. Such derivational process makes these languages morphologically complex. 

In addition to the morphological information, some syntactic information are also expressed at 

word level. Furthermore, an orthographic word may attach some syntactic words like prepositions, 

conjunctions, negation, etc. which create various word forms (Gasser, 2010; Gasser, 2011). In 

these languages, nominals are inflected for number, gender, definiteness and case whereas verbs 

are inflected for person, number, gender, tense, aspect, and mood (Griefenow-Mewis, 2001). 

Essentially, unlike the Semitic languages which allow prefixing, Afan-Oromo allows suffixing. 

Most functional words like postpositions are also suffixed. However, there are some prepositions 

written as a separate word. 



86

Wolaytta like Afan-Oromo is a suffixing language in which words can be generated from root 

words recursively by adding suffixes only. Wolaytta nouns are inflected for number, gender and 

case whereas verbs are inflected for person, number, gender, aspect and mood (Wakasa, 2008). 

2.2 Syntactic Features 

Ethiopian languages that are under our consideration follow Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word- 

order except Ge’ez which allows the verb to come first. In Ge’ez, the basic word-order is Verb- 

Subject-Object (VSO). 

3 Challenges of SMT 

Statistical Machine Translation is greatly impacted by the linguistic features of the target languages. 

The challenges range from the writing system to that of word ordering and morphological complex-

ity.  

3.1 Writing System 

The Ge’ez writing system, which is used by Amharic, Tigrigna and Ge’ez languages, uses different 

characters in words that convey the same meaning, especially in Amharic. For example, peace can 

be written as: ሰላም or ሠላም. Such character variations affect probability values that have direct 

impact on the performance of SMTs. 

3.2 Word Ordering 

Most of the languages under consideration have same word order. With this respect, Amharic, Afan-

Oromo, Tigrigna and Wolaytta have SOV, while only Ge’ez has VSO. This might challenge machine 

translation system where Ge’ez is in the pair. Another challenge is the existence of flexibility in word 

order. For instance, even though Afan-Oromo follows SOV word order, nouns can be changed based 

on their role in a sentence which makes the word order to be flexible. Such flexibility will pose a 

challenge for translation from a source to Afan-Oromo. 

3.3 Morphological Complexity 

While word alignment could be done automatically or with supervision, morphological agreement 

between words in the source and target are crucial. For instance, Amharic and Geez have subject 

agreement, object agreement and genitive (possessive) agreement. Each of which is expressed as 

bound morphemes. In Amharic, for the word ገድልክ /you killed/ the subject “you” is represented by 

the suffix “+ክ” while the same subject is represented as “+” in the Geez ቀተልከ/you killed/). Most 

of the morphemes in the considered Ethiopian languages are bound ones. 

4 Parallel Corpora Preparation 

The development of machine translation more often uses statistical approach because it requires 

very limited computational linguistic resources compared to the rule based approach. Nevertheless, 

the statistical approach relies to a great extent on parallel corpora of the source and target 

languages. 

The research team has applied different techniques to collect parallel corpora for the selected 

Ethiopian language pairs. The domain of the collected data is only religious for which we have data 

for all the considered language pairs. It includes Holy Bible and different documents written in 

spiritual theme and collected from Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW1), Ethiopicbible2, Ebible3 and Geez 

experience4 which are freely accessible websites. 

A simple web crawler was used to extract parallel text from the websites. Python libraries such 

as requests, and BeautifulSoup were used to analyse the structure of the websites, extract texts

and combine into a single text file. To collect the bible data, we have generated the structure of the 

URL so that it shows the book names, chapters and verses of the Bible in each language. 

For the “daily text” which is published at JW.org, we tried to use the date information to generate 

URL for each language. Finally, we extracted the data based on the generated URL information and 

merged to a single UTF-8 text file for each language. 

4.1 Pre-processing 

Data preprocessing is an important and basic step in preparing bilingual and multilingual parallel 

corpora. Since the collected parallel data have different formats and characteristics, it is very difficult 

and time-consuming to prepare usable parallel corpora manually because it needs to analyse the struc-

ture of the collected raw data by applying different linguistic methods. We have, therefore, applied 

different automatic methods of text pre-processing that requires minimalhuman interference. As 

part of the pre-processing unnecessary links numbers, symbols and foreign texts in each language 

have been removed. During pre-processing the following tasks have been performed: character nor-

malization, sentence tokenization and sentence level alignment. 

4.1.1 Character Normalization 

As it is indicated in Section 3.1, there are characters in Amharic that have similar roles and are 

redundant. For example the character (ሀ) can be written as (ሐ, ሓ, ኃ, ኅ and ሃ). Though they used to 

possess semantic differences in the traditional writings, currently these characters are mostly used 

interchangeably. To avoid words with same meaning from being taken as different words due to 

these variations we have replaced a set of characters with similar function into a single most 

frequently used character. 

4.1.2 Sentence Tokenization and Alignment 

Lines that contain multiple sentences in both source and target languages are tokenized. The team 

has set two criteria to check whether the aligned sentences are correct or not. The first criterion is 

counting and matching the number of sentences in the source language and the target language. In 

the parallel corpora of the language pairs in which Ge’ez is the target, the source language contains 

multiple verses in a single line. While on the Ge’ez side, each line contains a single verse. In such 

cases, we merged different verses of Ge’ez to produce the line that is aligned with that of the 

source language. 

4.2 Corpus Size and Distribution of Words 

The corpora have been analysed to see the relationship between languages in the language pairs. 

As it has been revealed in different literature, the Ethio-Semitic languages have more complex 

morphology than the other Ethiopian languages. Due to this difference, the same number of sentences 

in these language pairs is tokenized into significantly different number of tokens and word types. 

Table 1 clearly shows that the vocabulary of the languages in the Ethio-Semitic language family is 

much more than the vocabulary of the other two language families.

Amharic 521,035 98,841 15

2,504 
Tigrigna 34,780 9,864 13 

Wolaytta 29,458 7,989 11 

Table 1: Sentence and Word Distribution of the Parallel Corpora  

On the contrary the token of the non-Semitic languages is significantly higher than the tokens of the 

Ethio-Semitic languages. This is because syntactic words like preposition, conjunction, negation, etc are 

bound in the Ethio-Semitic language group. It is clear, therefore, that such differences between the lan-

guages in a language pair makes SMT difficult because it aggravates data sparsity and results into a 

weakly trained translation model. Although the size of the data we have is much less to draw conclu-

sions, we could also see that the Ethio-Cushitic and Ethio-Omotic languages are morphologically more 

similar with each other than their similarity with the Ethio-Semitic languages. 

We have also observed morphological differences among the Ethio-Semitic languages that is 

revealed by the difference in the number of token and word type in the same corpus we have for 

Amharic-Tigrigna and Amharic-Ge’ez language pairs. The data revealed that Amharic is the most 

morphologically complex language of the family. 

5 SMT Experiments and Results 

To check the usability of the collected parallel corpora for seven Ethiopian language pairs, we have 

conducted bi-directional SMT experiments. 

5.1 Experimental Setup 

To conduct SMT experiments, each parallel corpus has been divided into three sets: 80% for the 

training, 10% for tuning and 10% for test sets. Moses (Koehn, 2009) has been used along with 

Giza++ alignment tool (Och and Ney, 2003) for aligning words and phrases. SRILM toolkit 

(Stolcke, 2002) has been used to develop the language models using target language sentences 

from the training and tuning sets of parallel corpora. Bilingual Evaluation Under Study (BLEU) is 

used for automatic scoring. 

5.2 Experimental Results 

Table 2 presents the experimental results of bi-directional SMT systems developed for the seven 

Ethiopian language pairs. The Table shows the difference in the performance of the systems devel-

oped for the same language pair in different directions.

Table 2: Experimental Results

The performance of SMT systems decreases when Ethio-Semitic languages are on the target 

side. This confirms that Ethio-Semitic languages (when they are targets) are more challenging to 

SMT than the other language families. The only exception being Tigrigna and Wolaytta language 

pair, where the performance is high when Tigrigna is a target. This could be attributed to the 

small data we have for this language pair. 

The results in the Table 2 also show the effect of data size on the performance of SMT systems. 

That means as the data increases, the performance also increases. In this view again we have an 

exceptionally lower BLUE score for the Amharic-Ge’ez language pair than the score we achieved for 

Amharic-Afan Oromo language pair although the data size used is almost equal. The performances 

of the Amharic-Wolaytta-Amharic translation systems are better than Amharic- Ge’ez-Amharic 

systems although the data size used in the former is less than the data size used in the latter. The 

results confirm that the morphological complexity of the languages severely affect SMT performance 

than the amount of data. From the difference in results achieved for the Amharic-Ge’ez (6.29) and 

Ge’ez-Amharic (7.31) language pairs, it is possible to understand that syntactic differences affect 

the performance of SMT more than the difference in their morphological features. We have seen from 

their number of word types that Amharic has more complex morphology than Ge’ez which, however, 

has flexible syntactic structure. 

Despite the size of the data, the performance registered in translation towards the Ethio- Semitic 

languages has less BLEU score than the translations from them. This is because of the fact that, 

when the Ethio-Semitic languages, specially Amharic, are used as a target language, the transla-

tion from other languages with less morphological complexity as a source languages is challenged 

by one-to-many alignment. On the other hand, better performance is registered the other direction 

since the alignment is many-to-one. Beside this, the word-based language model favours the non-

Semitic languages than Semitic ones due to the complexity of the morphology of the latter language 

family. 

6 Conclusions and Future Work 

This paper presents the attempt made in the preparation of usable parallel corpora for Ethiopian 

languages. The corpora have been collected from the web in the religious domain. Then, they are 

further pre-processed and normalized. We have now usable parallel corpora for seven Ethiopian 

language pairs. Using the corpora, bi-directional statistical machine translation experiments have 

been conducted. The results show that translation systems from Ethio-Semitic languages to either 

Omotic or Cushitic language families achieve better BLEU score than those in the other directions. 

That leads us to conclude that the Ethio-Semitic language family has the most complex morphol-

ogy which greatly affects the performance of SMT. 

Finding solutions that minimize the negative effect of morphological complexity of the Ethio- 

Semitic languages on the performance of SMT is therefore a future endeavour. We considered a 

previous work by (Mulu, 2017) who gained a significant improvement by the application of mor-

phological segmentations to guide us in utilizing the use of morphemes instead of words as units 

for both the translation and the statistical language models. The most attractive solution to the 

problems of machine translation that is the trend of the time is the use of ANN modelling, which 

however, requires more data than what we have. So we will use our experience of corpus preparation 

and work towards the application of the state of the art technologies to develop usable machine 

translation systems for the Ethiopian languages. 

As it is well known, domain is the most important factor on the performance of SMT. Thus, 

we are also working on the development and organization of parallel corpora for the Ethiopian 

languages in different domains.
