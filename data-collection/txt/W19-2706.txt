Abstract 

The relational status of ATTRIBUTION in 
Rhetorical Structure Theory has been a 
matter of ongoing debate.  Although 
several researchers have weighed in on the 
topic, and although numerous studies have 
relied upon attributional structures for their 
analyses, nothing approaching consensus 
has emerged.  This paper identifies three 
basic issues that must be resolved to 
determine the relational status of 
attributions.  These are identified as the 
Discourse Units Issue, the Nuclearity Issue, 
and the Relation Identification Issue.  
These three issues are analyzed from the 
perspective of classical RST.  A finding of 
this analysis is that the nuclearity and the 
relational identification of attribution 
structures are shown to depend on the 
writer’s intended effect, such that 
attributional relations cannot be considered 
as a single relation, but rather as 
attributional instances of other RST 
relations. 

1 Introduction 

In the classical formulation of Rhetorical Structure 
Theory, Mann and Thompson (1987) considered, 
but decided against, QUOTE as one of the baselined 
relations.  But this rejection of an attribution 
relation was by no means the final word on the 
subject, with debate continuing into the most recent 
formulation of the theory (Stede, Taboada, & Das, 
2017).  Even so, some basic ideas can be generally 
agreed upon.  It would be generally agreed that if 
there were an attribution relation, it would likely 
consist of two parts, consisting of an attribution 
predicate and its respective attributed material 
(although terminology for these parts varies from 
one researcher to the next).  It is also generally 
agreed that if there were, or is to be, an attribution 
relation, one of these parts would be an RST 

satellite and the other the nucleus.  There is not, 
however, general agreement as to which one is 
which (e.g., Carlson & Marcu, 2001; Redeker & 
Egg, 2006).   

Among those accepting that there is an 
attribution relation, as well as among some of those 
who reject it, the parts comprising the relation are 
often identified in terms of syntactical or 
grammatical features (e.g., Carlson & Marcu, 
2001; Redeker & Egg, 2006; Wolf & Gibson, 
2005).  For example, the part of the putative 
relation that would provide the attributed material 
is sometimes delimited, for reasons not entirely 
forthcoming, to clausal complements, and thereby 
ruling out other possibilities, such as infinitival 
complements, except when including them would 
serve the analyst’s purposes.  

Alternatively among those who reject the 
relational status of attribution, the reasoning may 
be more closely aligned with the fundamentals of 
classical RST, based on the view that the 
constituents of attributions, whatever they might be 
from a syntactical or grammatical view, fail to meet 
the basic standards for discourse units  (e.g., Mann 
& Thompson, 1987; Stede et al., 2017; Tofiloski, 
Brooke, & Taboada, 2009).  However, given that 
the standards for what constitutes a discourse unit 
are somewhat unstable in their own right, this too 
leaves one on uncertain ground (Degand & Simon, 
2009). 

So there are three core issues here, and these will 
be the subject of this paper.  The first of these issues 
may be called the Discourse Units Issue, and 
concerns whether the constituents of attributions 
can be plausibly construed as discourse units, 
elementary or otherwise.  The second issue is the 
Nuclearity Issue.  That is, if attributions are 
relations, which part is the satellite and which the 
nucleus?  The third issue is the Relation 
Identification Issue.  If we accept the finding that 
attributions are relational, with one part consisting

of a nucleus and the other a satellite, then how do 
we characterize whatever relations may be found 
between these parts?  What are the constraints, and 
what are the intended effects?  Is there only one 
ATTRIBUTION relation, or are there other 
possibilities?  Addressing these issues is the 
objective of this study.   

The analytical approach used here is based on 
classical RST analysis.  A key determinant in 
addressing the issues requires analysis of the 
writer’s intended effect, as understood by the 
analyst.  Identifying the writer’s intended effect is 
an essential means for determining relational 
structure.  Because RST is a functional account of 
text organization, intended effect overrides 
grammatical analysis, and it is the tie-breaker for 
resolving otherwise simultaneous analyses.  As 
described by Mann and Thompson (1987), RST 
provides an account for how intended effects are 
realized through relational propositions, and thus 
serves as a general theory of writers' goals, and this 
is fundamental to understanding the organization 
of a text.   

And yet the primacy of intended effect is 
scarcely mentioned in discussions of attribution.  It 
is not explicit among the reasons Mann and 
Thompson (1987) identified for rejecting it.  
Neither Carlson and Marcu (2001) nor Redeker 
and Egg (2006) mention it.  Wolf and Gibson 
(2005) do not mention it.  Nor do Sanders, 
Spooren, and Noordman (1992) nor Das, Taboada, 
and Stede (2017).  In an earlier rejection of 
relational status for attributions, Stede (2008) calls 
attention to the lack of nuclear constraints and 
inattention to the intentions of the writer, an 
assessment shared by da Cunha and Iruskieta 
(2010), but for the most part intended effect, so 
fundamental to RST, has been ignored.  

In this study, I propose to explore attributional 
relations from the perspective of intended effect.  
The claim to be developed is that attributions can 
be segmented into reporting and reported parts, but 
that the relation between these two parts will not 
necessarily be ATTRIBUTION per se, but will occur 
as one among several possible relations, including 
JUSTIFY, ELABORATION, EVIDENCE, EVALUATION, 
INTERPRETATION, and CAUSE.   

To support this claim, I will revisit a selection of 
existing RST analyses containing attributions from 
Carlson and Marcu (2001), Redeker and Egg 
(2006), Taboada and Hay (2008), and Das and 
Taboada (2013).  In addition, I have provided 

several original analyses.  These analyses will be 
used to support a discussion of each of the core 
issues outlined above, i.e., the Discourse Units 
Issue, the Nuclearity Issue, and the  Relation 
Identification Issue.  This investigation is followed 
by discussion of the consequences of these findings 
along with some suggestions for further research. 

2 Background 

Quite a few researchers have voiced opposition to 
relational status for attribution.  As noted in above, 
a frequent objection is that it fails to meet the inter-
clausal criterion for coherence relations (e.g., Das 
et al., 2017; Mann & Thompson, 1987; Sanders et 
al., 1992; Stede, 2008).  Despite these objections, 
numerous research projects have adopted 
ATTRIBUTION as a relation.  The primary 
proponents are Carlson and Marcu (2001), whose 
Discourse Tagging Reference Manual and their 
RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson, Marcu, & 
Okurowski, 2002) have been influential among 
RST analysts.  Redeker and Egg (2006) have also 
recognized the ATTRIBUTION relation, although 
their definition differs significantly from those of 
Carlson and Marcu (2001).    Dahlgren, McDowell, 
and Stabler (1989) used ATTRIBUTION in their 
knowledge representation system for tracking 
knowledge provenance.  Radev (2000) used 
ATTRIBUTION in his adaptation of RST for a theory 
of cross-document information fusion.  Wolf and 
Gibson (2005), for their annotation of news 
articles, used ATTRIBUTION to distinguish between 
multiple and possibly conflicting reports about 
identical news events.  Heerschop et al. (2011) 
used ATTRIBUTION for performing sentiment 
analysis.  In their study of sentiment-based ranking 
of blog posts, Chenlo, Hogenboom, and Losada 
(2013) used the ATTRIBUTION relation and found 
that it, along with ELABORATION, occurred 
frequently in the postings studied.  Similar results 
were obtained by Zhang and Liu (2016) in their 
study of RST relations across multiple levels of 
discourse unit granularity.  Galitsky, Ilvovsky, and 
Kuznetsov (2018) used ATTRIBUTION in their text 
classification framework for detecting logical 
argumentation.  The ATTRIBUTION relation has 
been widely included among the relations detected 
by RST discourse parsing systems (e.g., Heilman 
& Sagae, 2015; Hernault, Prendinger, duVerle, & 
Ishizuka, 2010; Ketui, Theeramunkong, & 
Onsuwan, 2012; Pardo, Nunes, & Rino, 2004; 
Soricut & Marcu, 2003).  Abdalla, Rudzicz, and 



40

 
	

Hirst (2018) found both ATTRIBUTION and 
ELABORATION to be significant indicators of 
Alzheimer’s disease in speech.  This widespread 
acceptance of the relation indicates an extensive 
reliance on it.  For this reason, if for no other, it is 
important that concerns about its status should be 
investigated and perhaps even resolved.   

3 The Discourse Units Issue 

The reason given by Mann and Thompson (1987) 
for rejecting attribution as a relation is that it does 
not constitute a distinct entity but has only a 
support role, such that no relational proposition 
arises.  Therefore it would suffice to show that 
relational propositions, i.e., RST relations, do 
under these circumstances arise, hence requiring 
segmentation of attribution predicates from their 
attributed material.  Showing how these relations 
arise is an objective of the analyses presented 
below, in Section 4. 

Stede et al. (2017) reject attribution for 
syntactical reasons.  They argue that the attributed 
material, i.e., the reported unit is not a discourse 
unit because it is a clausal complement of the 
attribution verb.  If RST were a theory of grammar, 
this might seem adequate.  But since RST is a 
functional theory of text organization, this 
argument seems questionable.  And if relational 
propositions are discoverable between attributions 
and the attributed material, then the constituents of 
that relation must be discourse units or text spans, 
and syntactical concerns are insufficient grounds 
for rejection.  Showing how these relations arise is 
an objective of the analyses presented below. 

4 The Nuclearity Issue 

In their definition of ATTRIBUTION, Carlson and 
Marcu (2001) mark the attribution predicate as the 
satellite and the attributed material, or reported 
message, as the nucleus.  Thus in the passage, 

1) Senator Chris Coons, the Delaware 
Democrat, told me  
2) that his longtime colleague [Senator 
Lindsey Graham] is “hysterically funny” 
and “personally engaging.”  

the first unit would be the satellite and the second 
would be the nucleus. Redeker and Egg (2006) 
argue that relegating the attribution predicate to 
satellite status can lead to misrepresentative or 
impossible RST analyses, particularly when the 

attribution predicate is a cognitive predication that 
is more salient than the attribution material.  They 
therefore mark the attribution predicate as the 
nucleus and the clausal complement as the satellite.  
And yet this too will lead to analyses that are 
misrepresentative or impossible.  Under this 
regimen, in the above example, the attribution 
predicate, Senator Chris Coons, the Delaware 
Democrat, told me would be marked as the 
nucleus, but it is the assessment of Lindsey 
Graham that is the more salient in this passage. 

This conflict is the result of a false dilemma.  
While attributions are clearly asymmetric, 
meaning that one constituent will be the nucleus 
and the other the satellite, there is no single pattern 
of asymmetry.  Sometimes the attribution predicate 
is the more salient, and sometimes the attributed 
material is more salient.  However, the inference to 
be made is not that ATTRIBUTION is not a discourse 
relation, nor is it that nuclearity must be decided on 
a case by case basis.  The inference to be made is 
that, although attribution is relational, the relation 
is not necessarily ATTRIBUTION per se.  Indeed, 
ATTRIBUTION is but one among several relations 
that are used in attributional constructs. 

5 The Relation Identification Issue 

Identification of attributions in discourse appears 
to be fairly straightforward, based on the presence 
of attribution verbs or cognitive predicates.  
However, this is not to say that recognition of 
attribution phenomena, even as relational 
structures, provides any assurance that an 
attribution is ATTRIBUTION rather than some other 
relation.  Identification of intended effect is 
essential in determining the specific relation.  
Without identification of intended effect, it cannot 
be presumed that there is any relation whatsoever.  
In the case of attribution, the situation is 
complicated by the necessity for distinguishing 
between the writer’s intended effect and the 
source’s intended effect.  Is the writer merely 
reporting the attribution phenomena, or is the 
writer leveraging the attribution source or the 
attribution material to achieve some change in 
positive regard?  Attributions may be to the first 
person, second person, or third person.  
Attributions occur within the context of a 
discourse, and context must be considered when 
ascertaining the writer’s intended effect.  As 
detailed in the following, attributions are used to 



41

 
	

achieve a range of effects, with each of these 
having a corresponding relational function. 

5.1 Attribution as JUSTIFY  
Attribution is often used to justify a claim.  In 
Carlson and Marcu’s example of ATTRIBUTION, 
Analysts estimated that sales at U.S. stores 
declined in the quarter, too, it is significant that the 
analysts who have provided the estimation are 
presumably financial analysts, not psychoanalysts, 
software analysts, politicians, or human resource 
managers.  The intended effect of JUSTIFY is to 
increase the reader’s readiness to accept the 
writer’s right to present the situation in the nucleus.  
Misconstruing the type of analyst would 
undermine the claim that sales in U.S. stores 
declined. 

In the example shown in Figure 1, a writer for 
Science Magazine uses JUSTIFY to present an 
argument in which the attributed material is 
interwoven with other elements of the argument.  
The topic is an open access agreement between 
Project Deal (a consortium of libraries, 
universities, and research institutes in Germany) 
and the Wiley publishing company.  Credibility for 
the claim that the price per paper fee is too high is 
provided by the qualifications of the attribution 
source.  Further on in the same article, the writer 
presents a counter-argument and again uses 
JUSTIFY, this time supporting the position with an 
attribution to the physicist Gerard Meijer, one of 
the negotiators for Project Deal.  The function of 
these attributions is not just to give credit to the 
sources, but to provide authority for claims for 
which the writer lacks sufficient expertise.  That is, 
the writer is relying on borrowed authority.  To 
assert the two opposing perspectives without 
attribution would be to risk diminished credibility.  

The use of attribution as a form of borrowed 
authority is standard practice not only in 
journalism but in other disciplines as well, such as 
rhetorical studies (Connors, 1999), scientific and 
technical writing (Cronin & Shaw, 2002), 
professional health communication (Schryer, Bell, 
Mian, Spafford, & Lingard, 2011), information 
science (Halevi & Moed, 2013), anthropology 
(Goodman, Tomlinson, & Richland, 2014), student 
writing assignments (Swales, 2014), religious texts 
(O’Keefe, 2015), and, of course, discourse analysis 
(Swales, 1986; White, 2004).  As observed by 
Connors (1998), although the use of citation tends 
to be highly formalized, it is essentially rhetorical 
in nature. 

 Attribution as JUSTIFY can also occur in 
expressions of cognitive acts.  For example, when 
the US politician Kirsten Gillibrand declared that 
one of the reasons why I'm running for president is 
because I truly believe I can bring this country 
together, among the intended effects is that the 
audience should also believe that she can achieve 
that lofty goal.  Designating the relation as JUSTIFY 
is consistent with the writer’s intended effect.  To 
designate the relation as ATTRIBUTION would 
obscure the identification of intended effect. 

5.2  Attribution as EVALUATION and 
INTERPRETATION 

With the EVALUATION relation, the reader 
recognizes that the satellite assesses the nucleus 
and recognizes the value it assigns.  In the 
following example, the writer uses a cognitive 
predicate.  The intended effect is that the reader 
will recognize the pleasure the writer takes in 
having a new client: 

S: We are pleased  
N: that you have chosen Young Physical 
Therapy, Inc. Specialty Center for your 
physical therapy needs. 

Like EVALUATION, INTERPRETATION involves 
an assessment of the situation presented in the 
nucleus, but without concern for the writer’s 
positive regard.  In the example shown in Figure 2, 
there are two attributions, one the cause of the 
other.  The first is an example of attribution used 
for ELABORATION, which will be discussed in 
Section 5.4.  In the second attribution relation, the 
writer assesses the reaction of a surgical team upon 
learning of the long term survival of their patient.  
Although the surgeons’ positive regard was likely 

 

Figure 1: Attribution as JUSTIFY 

 



42

 
	

enhanced by the surprise, there is no indication that 
the reported event is concerned with writer’s 
positive regard. 

 

5.3 Attribution as CAUSE 
Sometimes a situation presented in the attributed 
material is the CAUSE of a cognitive state.  These 
constructs are similar to EVALUATION, except the 
rhetorical salience is on the attribution predicate.  
In the example shown in Figure 3, the low ranking 
assigned to a football team caused outrage among 
college football experts.  Although their outraged 
response is an evaluation of the ranking, it is their 
outrage that is the topic of the discourse. 

5.4 Attribution as ELABORATION  
Sometimes the attributed material simply provides 
more information about the activity identified in 
the attribution predicate. In the attribution, Bush 
indicated there might be “room for flexibility” in a 
bill, the significance of context in establishing 
intended effect becomes apparent.  The attribution 
source is President George H. W. Bush, and the bill 
he was referring to would have allowed federal 
funding of abortions for poor women who are 
victims of rape and incest.  The context includes 

the observation that he reiterated his opposition to 
such funding, but expressed hope of a compromise.  
Because the source of the attribution is a US 
president, who through his political stature and his 
veto power wields some authority as to whether 
there is “room for flexibility” in any pending 
legislation, the attribution might seem to be 
JUSTIFY.  But Bush is not the writer here, and the 
writer is merely reporting what Bush said during a 
press conference. There is no indication that the 
writer’s intent was to increase the reader’s 
readiness to accept his or her right to present.  
Indeed, the press release immediately passes on to 
other matters.  The RST relation in use here is 
ELABORATION.  

Attributions as elaborations also include 
cognitive states, such as thinking and believing.  As 
shown above in segments 1-2 of Figure 2, the 
satellite identifies a particular belief attributed to 
the subject of the nucleus.  Presumably this belief 
or thought is one among many that could be 
attributed to the surgeons.  As a subject matter 
relation, ELABORATION specifies that the reader 
will recognize that the satellite provides additional 
detail for the nucleus.  It is not necessary that the 
reader agree with the additional detail, it is only 
necessary that the reader agree that, true or false, it 
is one of the subject’s beliefs.   

5.5 Attribution as EVIDENCE 
In an EVIDENCE relation, the satellite is intended to 
increase the reader's belief in the nucleus.  It is not 
unusual for an EVIDENCE relation to also meet the 
criteria for an ELABORATION relation.  The 
difference is one of intended effect.  The following 
example is from Redeker and Egg (2006), who 
recycled it from Wolf and Gibson (2005), who cite 
it as example of a text containing cross 
dependencies, and as such cannot be represented 
using an RST tree structure: 

“Sure I’ll be polite," promised one BMW 
driver who gave his name only as Rudolph, 
"as long as the trucks and the timid stay out 
of the left lane.” 

Redeker and Egg note that, if analyzed in the 
style of Marcu, the ATTRIBUTION satellite 
(promised one BMW driver…) would interrupt the 
reported text, so that what should be the nucleus of 
the ATTRIBUTION is split into separate segments, 
only one of which can be accessed by the satellite.  
To address this difficulty, Redeker and Egg reverse 

 

Figure 2: Attribution as ELABORATION and 
EVALUATION 

 

Figure 3: Attribution as CAUSE 



43

 
	

the nuclearity of the ATTRIBUTION relation and 
avoid the split segments by moving the embedded 
segments outside of the enclosing text.  This 
practice can be given greater clarity by, in addition 
to moving the text, relocating them immediately 
following, and inserting a placeholder at the 
removal point: 

1) “Sure I’ll be polite" [3-4],  
2) "as long as the trucks and the timid stay 
out of the left lane.” 
3) promised one BMW driver  
4) who gave his name only as Rudolph.  

However, assigning nuclearity to the attribution 
predicate is at odds with the rhetorical function of 
the text.  The point of the text is the promise itself.  
The speaker’s politeness is contingent upon slower 
drivers staying out of the way.  That Rudolph 
drives a BMW and refuses to disclose his full name 
makes the reported warning more believable, so as 
shown in Figure 4, the EVIDENCE relation is used, 
with nuclearity assigned to the reported speech.  
Lest there be any doubt that ‘BMW’ contributes to 
the believability of the promise, consider 
substituting ‘Ford Pinto’ for it instead.  The 
strength of this evidence is sufficient to assure that 
the CONDITION relation between segments 1-2 is 
one of equivalence, not just implication: failure to 
stay out of the left lane will assuredly result in 
something other than politeness. The text is an 
argument, for which the claim is that Rudolph will 
be polite only to drivers who stay out of his way, 
and the ground is that not only does he promise as 
much, but he is also the driver of a fast car and he 
refuses to be identified.  

5.6 Attribution as ATTRIBUTION 
As an example of a text problematic for the 
relational status of ATTRIBUTION,  Stede et al. 
(2017) offer the following: 

Katsumoto says to Nathan on the dawn of 
battle, “You think a man can change his 
destiny?” to which Cruise replies, “I 

believe a man does what he can, until his 
destiny is revealed.” 

The text comes from a review of the movie The 
Last Samurai, and can be found in the Simon 
Fraser University Review Corpus.  Tom Cruise 
plays the part of Nathan Algren.   

Following the view that attributions should not 
be treated as distinct discourse entities, Taboada 
and Hay (2008) analyze this text as shown in 
Figure 5.  Stede et al. (2017) support this view, 
observing that the reporting verbs are in a 
relationship to each other, but that also, there is a 
relation between the content clauses and the 
reporting verbs.  Moreover, it is difficult to say 
what these relations are, other than that they are 
attributive.  The passage seems to be structurally 
ambiguous, and the relationships between the 
attributed material and the attribution predicates 
seem to be nothing more than attributive.  If 
annotated as attributive, the text would be 
segmented into four units: 

1) Katsumoto says to Nathan on the dawn of 
battle,  
2) “You think a man can change his 
destiny?”  
3) to which Cruise replies,  
4) “I believe a man does what he can, until 
his destiny is revealed.” 

The structural ambiguity arises with segment 3, to 
which Cruise replies, because it refers both 
backward (to which) and forward (Cruise replies).  
But the SOLUTIONHOOD relation overrides the 
ambiguity because the question posed by 
Katsumoto is satisfied not by segment 3, but by the 
text span 3-4.  This sense of the text is captured by 
the Taboada and Hay (2008) annotation shown 
above.   

As for the possibility of the reporting verbs 
being nothing more than attributive, if that were so, 
it might provide support for an ATTRIBUTION 
relation as defined by Carlson and Marcu, as being 
reported speech, without regard for intended effect.  

 

Figure 4: Attribution as EVIDENCE 

 
Figure 5. Non-Attributive Analysis 



44

 
	

But the intended effect here goes beyond reporting 
who-said-what.  As shown in Figure 6, each of the 
satellites support the exchange between Katsumoto 
and Nathan (Cruise) by engaging the reader in the 
drama (on the dawn of battle), making the reader 
more interested in reading the nuclei.  This is akin 
to the definition of the PREPARATION relation, as 
defined by Mann and Thompson (1987).  However, 
this relation should not be marked as 
PREPARATION.  It does not conform with the way 
PREPARATION is usually used, and although, as 
with PREPARATION, the satellite precedes the 
nucleus in the text, conformance to that schema is 
not a reliable expectation.  Therefore I suggest that 
the relation is ATTRIBUTION, but that its definition 
is not merely attributive.  

In this sense the ATTRIBUTION relation could be 
categorized as a textual relation.  Textual relations, 
as defined by Stede et al. (2017), are relations used 

to organize the text and make its understanding 
easier by providing orienting information.  In 
Stede’s classification, textual relations include 
PREPARATION, RESTATEMENT, and SUMMARY.  
With that stipulation, we can accept that sometimes 
an attribution is just an ATTRIBUTION.   

5.7 Cognitive States as (Faux) CONCESSION 
Expressions of cognitive states are sometimes used 
to moderate a claim with an indication of 
uncertainty.  This involves an apparent delimitation 
of the claim as merely a matter of opinion.  But the 
intended effect is not to concede uncertainty upon 
the claim, but to appear to concede uncertainty in 
order to moderate the claim’s delivery, with the 
intended effect of assuring acceptance. In the 
following example from TripAdvisor, the writer 
tenders some advice to a prospective traveler to the 
Yucatán Peninsula: 

Have you been to Cancun before - if not I 
think you might want to reconsider using it 

as a base.  It is heavy traffic, and positively 
the worst resort I ever went [to] in my life - 
overdeveloped and literally raping you for 
every dollar to be had. 

This text uses I think to soften the advice, 
ostensibly allowing that I could be wrong, but, but 
the stridency of the evidence used in support of this 
advice leaves little doubt as to the intended effect.  
This equivocal use of an expression of cognitive 
state allows the writer to have it both ways.   
Similarly, in the movie Field of Dreams, when the 
ghost of baseball legend Shoeless Joe Jackson says 
to Ray Kinsella, 

I think you'd better stay here, Ray 

in denying Ray the chance to join the baseball team 
in the clubhouse, Jackson is not merely expressing 
an opinion, he is not merely floating an idea for 
Ray’s consideration.  He is directing Ray to stay 
put.  That this is a correct interpretation is 
supported not only by Ray’s angry response, but 
also by the necessity of physically restraining him 
from going forward: The cognitive predicate has 
the effect of downtoning the directive while the 
intent of the directive remains intact. 

This use of expressions of cognitive state is 
particularly valuable for writers of sufficient 
stature to be recognized as experts in their field.  
The writer may blend this faux CONCESSION with 
JUSTIFY.  Assured of their authority, the writer can 
moderate a claim through the rhetorical leavening 
arising from the disingenuous indication of 
uncertainty and its resulting informality, while at 
the same time putting the weight of their authority 
behind the claim.  Thus, in his 1925 presidential 
address to the Mathematical Association, when 
mathematician G.H. Hardy wrote that 

I think that it is time that teachers of 
geometry became a little more ambitious 

he could easily afford to assume a posture of less 
than full certainty, knowing that his words would 
be accorded a respect consistent with his stature.  
Similarly, in Michael Asimow’s letter to the 
California Common Cause organization, as Vice-
Chair and UCLA Law Professor, he could employ 
the same technique to avoid officiousness when 
urging the membership to vote against a CCC 
endorsement of a nuclear freeze initiative: 

… I think we will be stronger and more 
effective if we stick to those issues of 
governmental structure and process, 

 

Figure 6: Attribution as ATTRIBUTION 



45

 
	

broadly defined, that have formed the core 
of our agenda for years. 

And 

… I don't think endorsing a specific nuclear 
freeze proposal is appropriate for CCC. 

Analyses of the letter from which these examples 
are drawn have appeared in numerous 
publications.  It was analyzed as part of a study in 
relational propositions by Mann and Thompson 
(1983), and an RST analyses of the text is in several 
papers by Mann (1984), Mann and Thompson 
(1985), and Thompson and Mann (1987).  It was 
analyzed from an argumentative perspective by 
Fries (1987).  Seligman (1994) used it to 
substantiate development of arguments arranged as 
lattices.  It was revisited by Matthiessen (2002a), 
Matthiessen (2002b), and Halliday and 
Matthiessen (2004) with lexicogrammatical 
realizations superimposed on the RST analysis.  In 
none of these studies has this engagingly 
ambiguous use of language attracted attention.  
And yet this use of attributions as faux 
CONCESSION is significant to realization of an 
intended effect, in this case, buy-in from the 
membership.  And this suggests that not only are 
attributions relational, but they are central in 
determining the writer’s intended effect. 

6 Conclusion  

Writers construct attributions with diverse 
intentions, and this diversity is reflected in the 
range of RST relations discernible within these 
constructions.  Showing that there are such 
relations has been an objective of this study.  The 
means for doing so has involved determining 
whether the constituents of attribution 
constructions can be plausibly treated as discourse 
units (the Discourse Units Issue), and given that, 
whether these units can be said to hold satellite-
nucleus relations (the Nuclearity Issue), and if so, 
what these relations are (the Relation Identification 
Issue).  While this ordering of the research 
questions may seem like a reasonable way to 
present them, it is perhaps not the best order in 
which to answer them.  This is because there is an 
interdependency among the three issues.  The 
units, consisting of the attribution predicates and 
attributed material, are discourse units by virtue of 
their participation in discourse relations.  That 
there are attributional discourse relations is 

established by the ability to identify applicable 
relations.  The relations identified in this study do 
not necessarily comprise an exhaustive list.  Others 
may be discovered through further analysis.  But 
such relations as have been discovered are 
sufficient to satisfy the objectives of the study.   

Moreover, I believe the analysis presented here 
resolves the discrepancy in nuclearity between the 
approaches presented by Carlson and Marcu 
(2001) and Redeker and Egg (2006).  For most 
attributions, the nucleus is in the attributed material 
(ATTRIBUTION, EVIDENCE, EVALUATION, 
INTERPRETATION, and CONCESSION), but for the 
ELABORATION and CAUSE relations the nucleus is 
the attribution predicate.  Further, to the extent that 
the analysis presented here is plausible, some of the 
criteria employed by Carlson and Marcu for 
excluding certain constructs as relations may need 
to be revisited.  In particular, their exclusion of 
infinitival complements from attribution relations 
seems rhetorically arbitrary.  Similarly, the 
exclusion of attribution predicates that do not 
identify a source seems unnecessarily restrictive.  
And passive constructions like It is hoped that 
other Japanese would then follow the leader need 
not be excluded.  Although the apparent anonymity 
of the expressed hope suggests there could be 
difficulties in determining whether the writer is 
among those who hold the attributed material in 
positive regard, it is clear that someone does.  So 
the relation would be either EVALUATION or 
INTERPRETATION – that there may be difficulty in 
choosing between these two is not sufficient to rule 
that it is neither.  And in general for such 
constructions it would be reasonable to expect that 
context would be helpful in reaching a 
determination.  In this particular case, the context 
identifies the parties doing the hoping as unnamed 
Mexican officials. 

The confirmation that attributions are RST 
relations may seem to be a setup for a long slide 
down a slippery slope into intraclausal relations.  
Perhaps, but this descent is already well underway 
(e.g., de Souza, Scott, & Volpe Nunes, 1989; 
Garson, 1981; Grabski & Stede, 2006; Hobbs, 
2010; Hovy, 1990; Krifka-Dobes & Novak, 1993; 
Nicholas, 1994; Roch, 2013; Rosner & Stede, 
1992; Schauer & Hahn, 2000; van der Vliet, 2010; 
van der Vliet, Berzlánovich, Bouma, Egg, & 
Redeker, 2011; Vander Linden, Cumming, & 
Martin, 1992).  Some of this work has been aimed 
at addressing requirements specific to a particular 



46

 
	

application.  Other work has been undertaken with 
the objective of refining or extending general 
theory.  

That RST analyses based on intended effect 
would yield different results from methods relying 
on syntactical and algorithmic criteria is 
unsurprising.  Analysis using intended effect 
involves the use of judgments that, while not 
arbitrary, if allowed to pass unexplicated, may 
seem ad hoc.  And as Carlson and Marcu (2001) 
observe, applying such methods to a large corpus 
is impractical.  Even so, for the study of text 
organization, analyses using intended effect 
continues to be useful for text and analysis theory 
development.  From such studies emerge new 
desiderata for development of scalable methods, 
and thus they are essential to continued progress.
