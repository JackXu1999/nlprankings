Abstract 

Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an active research 

area nowadays due to the tremendous interest 

in aggregating and evaluating opinions being 

disseminated by users on the Web. SA of 

English has been thoroughly researched; 

however research on SA of Arabic has just 

flourished. Twitter is considered a powerful 

tool for disseminating information and a rich 

resource for opinionated text containing 

views on many different topics. In this paper 

we attempt to bridge a gap in Arabic SA of 

Twitter which is the lack of sentiment lexi-

cons that are tailored for the informal lan-

guage of Twitter. We generate two lexicons 

extracted from a large dataset of tweets using 

two approaches and evaluate their use in a 

simple lexicon based method. The evaluation 

is performed on internal and external da-

tasets. The performance of these automatical-

ly generated lexicons was very promising, al-

beit the simple method used for classification. 

The best F-score obtained was 89.58% on the 

internal dataset and 63.1-64.7% on the exter-

nal datasets. 

1 Introduction 

The past decade has witnessed the proliferation 

of social media websites which has led to the 

production of vast amounts of unstructured text 

on the Web. This text can be characterized as 

objective, i.e. containing facts, or subjective i.e. 

containing opinions and sentiments about enti-

ties. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the research 

field that is concerned with identifying opinions 

in text and classifying them as positive, negative 

or neutral. SA of English has been thoroughly 

researched; however research on SA of Arabic 

has just flourished.  

Arabic is ranked fourth among languages on 

the web although it is the fastest growing lan-

guage on the web among other languages (Inter-

net World Stats, 2015). Arabic is a morphologi-

cally rich language where one lemma can have 

hundreds of surface forms; this complicates the 

tasks of SA. Moreover, the Arabic language has 

many variants. The formal language is called 

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the spoken 

language differs in different Arabic countries 

producing numerous Arabic dialects sometimes 

called informal Arabic or colloquial Arabic. The 

language used in social media is known to be 

highly dialectal (Darwish and Magdy, 2014). 

Dialects differ from MSA phonologically, mor-

phologically and syntactically and they do not 

have standard orthographies (Habash, 2010). 

Consequently, resources built for MSA cannot be 

adapted to dialects very well. 

The informal language used in social media 

and in Twitter in particular makes the SA of 

tweets a challenging task. The language on social 

media is known to contain slang, nonstandard 

spellings and evolves by time. As such sentiment 

lexicons that are built from standard dictionaries 

cannot adequately capture the informal language 

in social media text. Therefore, in this paper we 

propose to generate Arabic sentiment lexicons 

that are tweet-specific i.e. generated from tweets. 

We present two approaches to generating Arabic 

sentiment lexicons from a large dataset of 2.2 

million tweets. The lexicons are evaluated on 

three datasets, one internal dataset extracted from 

the larger dataset of tweets and two external da-

tasets from the literature on Arabic SA. Moreo-

ver, the lexicons are compared to an external Ar-

abic lexicon generated also from tweets. A sim-

ple lexicon-based method is used to evaluate the 

lexicons.  

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 

reviews the related work on sentiment lexicon 

generation. Section 3 describes the details of the 

datasets used to generate the lexicons and how 

they were collected. Section 4 presents the ap-

proaches used to generate the lexicons. Section 5 

details the experimental setup while Section 6 

presents and analyzes the results. Finally, we

conclude the paper and present potential future 

work in Section 7. 

2 Related Work 

Words that convey positive or negative sentiment 

are fundamental for sentiment analysis. Compil-

ing a list of these words is what is referred to as 

sentiment lexicon generation. There are three 

approaches to generate a sentiment lexicon (Liu, 

2012): manual approach, dictionary-based ap-

proach, and corpus-based approach. The manu-

al approach is usually not done alone since it is 

time consuming and labor intensive. It is used 

however, in conjunction with automated ap-

proaches to check the correction of the resulting 

lexicons from these approaches. In this section 

we review popular English and Arabic sentiment 

lexicons in the literature. 

2.1 English Sentiment Lexicons 

In the dictionary based approach as the 

name implies a dictionary is used by utilizing the 

synonym and antonym lists that are associated 

with dictionary words. The technique starts with 

a small set of sentiment words as seeds with 

known positive or negative orientations. The 

seed words are looked up in the dictionary then 

their synonyms and antonyms are added to the 

seed set and a new iteration starts. The process 

ends when no new words are found. A manual 

inspection is usually done after the process ends 

to correct errors. A majority of studies under this 

approach used the WordNet with different ap-

proaches for expanding the list such as distance-

based measures (Kamps, 2004; Williams and 

Anand, 2009) and graph-based methods (Blair-

Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 

2009). Pioneering work in this approach is the 

construction of SentiWordNet by (Esuli and Se-

bastiani, 2005). Initially, they started with a set 

of positive seeds and a set of negative seeds then 

expanded the sets using the synonym and anto-

nym relations in WordNet. This formed a train-

ing set which they used in a supervised learning 

classifier and applied it to all the glosses in 

WordNet, the process is run iteratively. Then in a 

following attempt (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), a 

committee of classifiers based on the previous 

method were used to build SentiWordNet which 

contains terms that are associated with three 

scores for objectivity, positivity and negativity, 

where the sum of the scores is 1.  The latest ver-

sion is SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et al., 

2010).  

As for corpus-based approaches, the words 

of the lexicon are extracted from the corpus us-

ing a seed list of known sentiment words and 

different approaches to find words of similar or 

opposite polarity. One of the earliest work in this 

approach was that of (Hatzivassiloglou and 

McKeown, 1997), where they utilized connec-

tives e.g. and, but, etc. between adjectives in a 

corpus to learn new sentiment words not in the 

seed list. Turney, (2002); Turney and Littman, 

(2002) used the once popular AltaVista search 

engine to find the sentiment of a certain word 

through calculating the association strength be-

tween the word and a set of positive words minus 

the association strength between the word and a 

set of negative words. The association strength 

was measured using Pointwise-Mutual Infor-

mation (PMI). The result is the sentiment score 

of the word, if it is positive this means the word 

is strongly associated with positive polarity and 

as such its polarity will be positive and if it is 

negative the word’s polarity will be negative. 

The magnitude indicates the sentiment intensity 

of the word. We used PMI to generate one of the 

lexicons in this paper. 

After the emergence of sentiment analysis as 

an evolving research field, several lexicons were 

constructed according to the approaches men-

tioned above. In the Bing Liu’s lexicon (Hu and 

Liu, 2004), which falls under the dictionary-

based method, the WordNet was exploited to 

infer the semantic orientation of adjectives ex-

tracted from customer reviews. The lexicon only 

provides the prior polarity of words: positive or 

negative, the sentiment intensity of the words 

was not calculated. Another popular sentiment 

lexicon is the MPQA subjectivity lexicon (Wil-

son et al., 2005) which was constructed by man-

ually annotating the subjective expressions in the 

MPQA corpus. The words were annotated with 

four tags: positive, negative, both and neutral 

then further classified as strong or weak to de-

note intensity. We use these two lexicons in the 

generation of the other lexicon in this paper. 

With the proliferation of social media web-

sites, the need for lexicons that can capture the 

peculiarities of social medial language emerges. 

As such, many solutions for sentiment analysis 

of social media and Twitter in particular initiate 

by developing sentiment lexicons that are ex-

tracted from Twitter (Tang et al., 2014; Ki-

ritchenko et al., 2014).

Generating sentiment lexicons for Arabic has 

gained the interest of the research community 

lately. Consequently, we found several efforts for 

generating these lexicons. A recent effort to build 

a large scale multi-genre multi dialect Arabic 

sentiment lexicon was proposed by (Abdul-

Mageed and Diab, 2014). However, it covers 

only two dialects: Egyptian and Levantine and is 

not yet fully applied to SSA tasks. Badaro et al., 

(2014) constructed ArSenL, a large scale Arabic 

sentiment lexicon. They relied on four resources 

to create ArSenL: English WordNet (EWN), Ar-

abic WordNet (AWN), English SentiWordNet 

(ESWN), and SAMA (Standard Arabic Morpho-

logical Analyzer). Two approaches were fol-

lowed producing two different lexicons: the first 

approach used AWN, by mapping AWN entries 

into ESWN using existing offsets thus producing 

ArSenL-AWN. The second approach utilizes 

SAMA’s English glosses by finding the highest 

overlapping synsets between these glosses and 

ESWN thus producing ArSenL-Eng. Hence Ar-

SenL is the union of these two lexicons. Alt-

hough this lexicon can be considered as the larg-

est Arabic sentiment lexicon developed to date, it 

is unfortunate that it only has MSA entries and 

no dialect words and is not developed from a 

social media context which could affect the accu-

racy when applied on social media text.  

Following the example of ArSenL, the lexicon 

SLSA (Sentiment Lexicon for Standard Arabic) 

(Eskander and Rambow, 2015) was constructed 

by linking the lexicon of an Arabic morphologi-

cal analyzer Aramorph with SentiWordNet.  Alt-

hough the approach is very similar to ArSenL, 

since both use SentiWordNet to obtain the scores 

of words, the linking algorithm used to link the 

glosses in Aramorph with those in SentiWordNet 

is different. SLSA starts by linking every entry in 

Aramorph with SentiWordNet if the one-gloss 

word and POS match. Intrinsic and extrinsic 

evaluations were performed by comparing SLSA 

and ArSenL which demonstrated the superiority 

of SLSA. Nevertheless, SLSA like ArSenL does 

not include dialect words and cannot accurately 

analyze social media text. 

Mohammad et al., (2015), generated three Ar-

abic lexicons from Twitter. Three datasets were 

collected from Twitter: the first was tweets that 

contained the emoticons:”:)” and “:(“, the second 

was tweets that contained a seed list of positive 

and negative Arabic words as hashtags and the 

third was also from tweets that contained Arabic 

positive and negative words as hashtags but these 

were dialectal words. Then using PMI three lexi-

cons were generated from these datasets: Arabic 

Emoticon Lexicon, Arabic Hashtag Lexicon and 

Dialectal Arabic Hashtag Lexicon. Our approach 

in generating one of the lexicons is very similar 

and thus we use one of their lexicons in the ex-

periments to compare with our lexicons. The best 

performing lexicon was the Dialectal Arabic 

Hashtag Lexicon therefore we use it in this paper 

to compare and evaluate our lexicons. 

3 Dataset Collection 

We followed the approaches in previous work on 

SA of English Twitter to collect the datasets. As 

in (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010) we 

utilized emoticons as noisy labels to construct 

the first dataset EMO-TWEET. Tweets contain-

ing the emoticons: “:)” and “:(“ and the rule 

“lang:ar” (to retrieve Arabic tweets only) were 

collected during November and December 2015. 

The total number of Tweets collected is shown in 

Table 1.  

Davidov et al., (2010) and Kiritchenko et al., 

(2014) used hashtags of sentiment words such as 

#good and #bad to create corpora of positive and 

negative tweets, we adopted a similar method to 

theirs. Initially, we tried collecting tweets that 

contain Arabic sentiment words with hashtags 

but the search results were too low. We designat-

ed this result to a cultural difference in using 

hashtags between the western and eastern socie-

ties. Arabs do not use hashtags in this way. Ac-

cordingly we opted to use the sentiment words as 

keywords without the hashtag sign and the num-

ber of search results was substantial. Tweets con-

taining 10 Arabic words having positive polarity 

and 10 Arabic words having negative polarity 

were collected during January 2016. The key-

words are in Table 2 and the number of tweets 

collected in Table1. These results constitute our 

second dataset KEY-TWEET.  

Retweets, tweets containing URLs or media 

and tweets containing non-Arabic words were all 

excluded from the dataset. The reason for ex-

cluding tweets with URLs and media is that we 

found that most of the tweets that contain URLS 

and media were spam. We also noticed that alt-

hough we had specified in the search query that 

the fetched tweets should be in Arabic “lang:ar” 

some of the tweets were in English and other 

languages. So we had to add a filter to eliminate 

tweets with non-Arabic characters. 

In total, the number of collected tweets was 

around 6.3 million Arabic tweets in a time span 

of three months. After filtration and cleaning of 

699



the tweets, the remaining were 2.2 million 

tweets.

4 Lexicon Generation 

Two sentiment lexicons were extracted from the 

datasets of tweets using two different approach-

es. We call the first AraSenTi-Trans and the 

second AraSenTi-PMI. The approaches are pre-

sented in the following subsections. 

4.1 AraSenTi-Trans 

The datasets of tweets were processed using the 

MADAMIRA tool (Pasha et al., 2014). MAD-

AMIRA is a recent effort by Pasha et al. (2014) 

that combines some of the best aspects of two 

previous systems used for Arabic NLP: MADA-

Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation of 

Arabic (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Roth et al., 

2008; Habash et al., 2009; Habash et al., 2013)  

and AMIRA (Diab et al., 2007). MADAMIRA, 

on the other hand, improves on these two sys-

tems with a solution that is more robust, portable, 

extensible, and faster. 

The MADAMIRA tool identifies words into 

three types: ARABIC, NO_ANALYSIS and 

NON_ARABIC. This feature was used to elimi-

nate tweets containing non-Arabic words and to 

distinguish MSA words from dialect words as 

NO_ANALYSIS words can be identified as dia-

lect words or misspelled words or new words 

made up by tweepers (twitter users). According 

to the POS tags provided by MADAMIRA, we 

extracted only nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs 

and negation particles in an effort to eliminate 

unwanted stop words. 

Then we utilized two popular English senti-

ment lexicons that were used in previous work 

on English and Arabic sentiment analysis: the 

Liu lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004) and the MPQA 

lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005). 

Most previous papers on Arabic SA that used 

these lexicons just translated them into Arabic, 

yet we tried a different approach. MADAMIRA 

provides an English gloss for each word identi-

fied as ARABIC, the gloss could be one, two or 

three words. We used this gloss to compare with 

the Liu lexicon and MPQA lexicon using the 

following heuristics: 

 If all the word’s glosses are positive in 
both lexicons or found in one lexicon as 

positive and do not exist in the other lex-

icon: classify as positive. 

 If all the word’s glosses are negative in 
both lexicons or found in one lexicon as 

negative and do not exist in the other: 

classify as negative. 

 If the word’s glosses have different po-
larities in the lexicons or are (both) in 

MPQA: add to both list. 

 Else: all remaining words are classified 
as neutral. 

Although this approach could contain some er-

rors, a manual check can be performed to clean 

up. The manual cleanup is time consuming but it 

is a one-time effort that requires only a few days 

(Liu, 2012). Accordingly we gave the automati-

700



cally generated lists of positive, negative, both, 

and neutral words to two Arabic native speakers 

to review and correct the errors. We found that 

5% of the neutral words were incorrectly mis-

classified as neutral while they were sentiment 

bearing words. Also 10% of the positive words 

were misclassified as negative, and 15% of the 

negative words were misclassified as positive. 

The lists were corrected accordingly. We can 

conclude that using translated English lexicons 

does not always give us accurate classification of 

polarity. This result could be due to mistransla-

tions or cultural differences in classifying senti-

ment as demonstrated by  (Mohammad et al., 

2015; Mobarz et al., 2014; Duwairi, 2015). Ac-

cordingly, we propose a different approach to 

generating another lexicon in the following sec-

tion. 

4.2 AraSenti-PMI 

The second lexicon was also generated from the 

dataset of tweets but through calculating the 

pointwise mutual information (PMI) measure for 

all words in the positive and negative datasets of 

tweets. The PMI is a measure of the strength of 

association between two words in a corpus, i.e. 

the probability of the two words to co-occur in 

the corpus (Church and Hanks, 1990). It has been 

adapted in sentiment analysis as a measure of the 

frequency of a word occurring in positive text to 

the frequency of the same word occurring in 

negative text.  Turney, (2002); Turney and 

Littman, (2002) was the first work that proposed 

to use this measure in sentiment analysis. They 

used the once popular AltaVista search engine to 

find the sentiment of a certain word through cal-

culating the PMI between the word and a set of 

positive words minus the PMI between the word 

and a set of negative words. Other works that 

used PMI to generate sentiment lexicons can be 

found in (Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Mohammad et 

al., 2015).   

The frequencies of the words in the positive 

and negative datasets of tweets were calculated 

respectively then the PMI was calculated for 

each as follows: 

𝑃𝑀𝐼(𝑤, 𝑝𝑜𝑠) = log2
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑤,𝑝𝑜𝑠)∗𝑁

𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑤)∗𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑝𝑜𝑠)
 (1) 

 

where freq(w,pos) is the frequency of the word w 

in the positive tweets, freq(w) is the frequency of 

the word w in the dataset, freq(pos) is the total 

number of tokens in the positive tweets and N is 

the total number of tokens in the dataset.  The 

PMI of the word associated with negative tweets 

is calculated in the same way PMI(w,neg). The 

sentiment score for word w will be: 

 

Sentiment Score(w)=PMI(w,pos)-PMI(w,neg) (2) 

 

This was calculated for all words that occurred 

in the dataset five times or more, the reason for 

this is that the PMI is a poor estimator of low-

frequency words (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), so 

words occurring less than 5 times were excluded. 

Also for words that are found in the set of posi-

tive tweets but not in the set of negative tweets or 

vice versa, Equation 2 would give us a sentiment 

score of ∞, which would highly affect the calcu-

lation of the sentiment of the whole tweet. Since 

the absence of a word from the negative dataset 

does not require that the word’s sentiment is pos-

itive or vice versa; as such we calculated the sen-

timent score of such words as in Equation 1, 

PMI(w,pos) for words occurring only in the posi-

tive tweets and PMI(w,neg) for words occurring 

only in the negative tweets.  

4.3 Lexicons Coverage 

The number of positive and negative entries in 

each of the lexicons is shown in Table 3. The 

details of the lexicon of (Mohammad et al., 

2015) are also shown since this lexicon will be 

used in the experiments in the following section 

for evaluation and comparison purposes. Mo-

hammad et al., (2015) generated three lexicons, 

however they demonstrated that the Dialectal 

Arabic Hashtag Lexicon (DAHL) gave the best 

results and accordingly we use this lexicon in the 

experiments in this paper. From Table 3, we can 

see the high coverage of the generated lexicons 

AraSenti-Trans and AraSenti-PMI when com-

pared to DAHL. In addition we manually exam-

ined the three lexicons of (Mohammad et al., 

2015) and found that they were not cleaned. 

They contained non-Arabic words and hashtags 

that do not convey sentiment. This put a question 

mark on the validity of the lexicons and the 

number of entries reported. Our datasets were 

cleaned from non-Arabic words and punctuation, 

so the generated lexicons all contain valid Arabic 

words.

5 Evaluation 

To evaluate the performance of the tweet-

specific lexicons, we performed a set of experi-

ments using a simple lexicon-based approach, 

hence no training and/or tuning is required. We 

performed a two-way classification on the da-

tasets (positive or negative). We leave the prob-

lem of three and four way classification (posi-

tive, negative, neutral, mixed) for future work. 

We evaluated the generated lexicons on a dataset 

of 10,133 tweets extracted from the larger da-

tasets of tweets EMO-TWEET and KEY-

TWEET. The tweets were manually annotated by 

three annotators that are Arabic native speakers. 

The conflict between annotators was resolved by 

majority voting. We will call this dataset 

AraSenTi-Tweet. We also evaluated the generat-

ed lexicons on two external datasets of tweets: 

ASTD by (Nabil et al., 2015) and RR by (Refaee 

and Rieser, 2014). We extracted only the tweets 

that were labeled as positive or negative from 

these datasets. The details of all the datasets used 

in the experiments are illustrated in Table 4. We 

plan to release the dataset and the generated lexi-

cons for the public.

Table 4: Datasets used in the evaluation of the 

generated lexicons. 

Negation significantly affects the sentiment of 

its scope and consequently affects the evaluation 

of the lexicons. Accordingly, we propose to 

evaluate the generated lexicons in two settings: 

with and without negation handling. We also 

compare the performance of the generated lexi-

cons with a lexicon that was generated in a very 

similar approach to one of the lexicons. 

Since the datasets are unbalanced, we will re-

port the performance measures of the macro-

averaged F-score (Favg), precision (P) and recall 

(R) of the positive and negative classes as fol-

lows: 

 

P= TP/(TP+FP)    (3) 

R=TP/(TP+FN)    (4) 

F=2*PR/P+R    (5) 

 

where in the case of the positive class: TP is the 

number of positive tweets classified correctly as 

positive (true positive), FP is the number of neg-

ative tweets falsely classified as positive (false 

positive), and FN is the number of positive 

tweets falsely classified as negative (false nega-

tives).  The same holds for the negative class. 

Then the F-score is calculated as: 

 

𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑔 =
𝐹𝑝𝑜𝑠+𝐹𝑛𝑒𝑔

5.1 Setup A: No Negation Handling 

For the AraSenTi-Trans lexicon, we use the 

simple method of counting the number of posi-

tive and negative words in the tweet and which-

ever is the greatest denotes the sentiment of the 

tweet. The results of applying this method on the 

different datasets are illustrated in Table 5. 

As for the AraSenTi-PMI lexicon, the senti-

ment score of all words in the tweet were 

summed up. The natural threshold to classify the 

data into positive or negative would be zero, 

since positive scores denote positive sentiment 

and negative scores denote negative sentiment. 

However, according to (Kiritchenko et al., 2014) 

other thresholds could give better results. Conse-

quently, we experimented with the value of this 

threshold. We set it to 0, 0.5,and 1 and found that 

the best results were obtained when setting the 

threshold to 1. As such if the sum of the senti-

ment scores of the words in a tweet is greater 

than one, then the tweet is classified as positive, 

otherwise the tweet is classified as negative. 

5.2 Setup B:Negation Handling 

We also experimented with handling negation in 

the tweet, by compiling a list of negation parti-

cles found in the tweets and checking if the tweet 

contains a negation particle or not.  

For the AraSenTi-Trans lexicon, if the tweet 

contains a negation particle and a positive word, 

we do not increment the positive word counter. 

However, for tweets containing negative words 

and negation particles we found that not incre-

menting the negative word counter degraded the 

accuracy, so we opted to increment the negative 

word counter even if a negation particle is found 

in the tweet.  

Moreover, we experimented with adjusting the 

score of negation particles in the AraSenTi-PMI 

lexicon. After several experiments, we found that 

adjusting the score of the negation particles to -1 

was the setting that gave the best performance.

6 Discussion and Results 

The results of the first experimental setup for the 

two generated lexicons AraSenti-Trans and 

AraSenti-PMI are presented in Table 5. For the 

RR dataset and AraSenti-Tweet dataset, the su-

periority of the AraSenti-PMI lexicon is evident. 

The Favg of applying the AraSenti-PMI lexicon 

on the RR dataset is 63.6% while the Favg of ap-

plying the AraSenti-PMI lexicon on the AraSen-

ti-Tweet dataset is 88.92%. As for the ASTD 

dataset, applying the AraSenti-Trans lexicon 

gave better results with an Favg of 59.8%.  

In Table 6, the results of the lexicon-based meth-

od with negation handling are presented. The 

results of using the DAHL lexicon on the same 

datasets are also reported for comparison. 

First of all, the effect of negation handling on 

performance is significant, with increases of (1-

4%) on all datasets. Although the two lexicons 

AraSenti-Trans and AraSenti-PMI handled nega-

tion differently but the increase for every dataset 

was almost the same: the ASTD dataset +4%, the 

RR dataset +1% and the AraSenti-Tweet dataset 

+2% and +1% respectively.  

When comparing the performance of the gen-

erated lexicons AraSenti-Trans and AraSenti-

PMI with the DAHL lexicon, we find that our 

lexicons presented better classification results on 

all datasets.  

Finally, although the two lexicons were ex-

tracted from the same dataset, we find that their 

performance varied on the different datasets. The 

best performance for the ASTD dataset was 

when the AraSenti-Trans lexicon was used. 

However, the best performance for the RR and 

AraSenti-Tweet datasets was when the AraSenti-

PMI lexicon was used. Moreover, albeit the sim-

ple lexicon-based method used in the evaluation, 

we find that the performance is encouraging. 

Several enhancements could be made such as 

incorporating Arabic valence shifters and certain 

linguistic rules to handle them.

7 Conclusion 

In this paper, two large-scale Arabic sentiment 

lexicons were generated from a large dataset of 

Arabic tweets. The significance of these lexicons 

lies in their ability to capture the idiosyncratic 

nature of social media text. Moreover, their high 

coverage suggests the possibility of using them 

in different genres such as product reviews. This 

is a possible future research direction. 

The performance of the lexicons on external 

datasets also suggests their ability to be used in 

classifying new datasets. However, there is much 

room for improvement given the simple method 

703



used in evaluation. This simple lexicon-based 

method could be further enhanced by incorporat-

ing Arabic valence shifters and certain linguistic 

rules to handle them. We also plan to make the 

classification multi-way: positive, negative, neu-

tral and mixed.
