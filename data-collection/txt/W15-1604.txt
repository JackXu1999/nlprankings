Abstract

In this paper, we present design and construc-
tion of the first Italian corpus for automatic
and semi–automatic text simplification. In
line with current approaches, we propose a
new annotation scheme specifically conceived
to identify the typology of changes an original
sentence undergoes when it is manually sim-
plified. Such a scheme has been applied to
two aligned Italian corpora, containing orig-
inal texts with corresponding simplified ver-
sions, selected as representative of two dif-
ferent manual simplification strategies and ad-
dressing different target reader populations.
Each corpus was annotated with the opera-
tions foreseen in the annotation scheme, cov-
ering different levels of linguistic description.
Annotation results were analysed with the fi-
nal aim of capturing peculiarities and differ-
ences of the different simplification strategies
pursued in the two corpora.

1 Introduction and Background

Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) is receiving
growing attention over the last few years due to the
implications it has for both machine– and human–
oriented tasks. ATS has been employed as a prepro-
cessing step to improve the efficiency of e.g. parsing,
machine translation and information extraction. Re-
cently, ATS has been used in educational scenarios
and assistive technologies; e.g. for the adaptation of
texts to particular readers, like children (De Belder
et al., 2010), L2 learners (Petersen and Ostendorf,
2007), people with low literacy skills (Aluı́sio et
al., 2008), cognitive disabilities (Bott and Saggion,

2014) or language impairments, e.g. aphasia (Car-
roll et al., 1998) or deafness (Inui et al., 2003).

The purpose of ATS, within both perspectives, is
to reduce lexical and syntactic complexity while pre-
serving the original meaning of the text. To this
aim, three main approaches have been followed. The
more traditional one relies on the use of hand-crafted
rules (Chandrasekar et al., 1996; Siddharthan, 2002;
Siddharthan, 2010; Siddharthan, 2011), which typ-
ically cover specific phenomena that are symptoms
of linguistic complexity, especially at the syntactic
level (e.g. passives, relative clauses, appositions).
Recently, the availability of larger parallel corpora,
i.e. sentence-aligned corpora consisting of both the
original and the simplified version of the same text
(e.g. English and Simple English Wikipedia, in short
EW and SEW), has allowed a consistent use of ma-
chine learning techniques for automatically acquir-
ing simplification rules. This is the approach fol-
lowed by e.g. Woodsend and Lapata (2011), who
based their ATS system on a quasi-synchronous
grammar, Zhu et al. (2010), who adapted a Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) algorithm to imple-
ment simplification operations on the parse tree, and
Narayan and Gardent (2014), who similarly adopted
SMT techniques but also combined a deep semantic
representation of the sentence. Both hand-written
and automatically acquired rules have advantages
and shortcomings. While the former can poten-
tially account for the maximum linguistic informa-
tion, they are extremely costly to develop and tend
to cover only a few lexical and syntactic constructs;
on the other side, data-driven approaches require the
least linguistic knowledge but they are not feasible

31



without a large quantity of aligned data. Hybrid ap-
proaches seem to offer a good alternative; as shown
by Siddharthan and Angrosh (2014), a system that
combines automatically harvested lexical rules with
hand-crafted syntactic rules outperformed the state
of the art. Besides, all these systems exploit the
EW/SEW dataset as a training corpus. Such re-
sources are lacking for languages other than English,
making it rather impossible to approach ATS as
pure machine learning task. For some of these lan-
guages, parallel monolingual corpora are annotated
with simplification rules corresponding to transfor-
mations to perform on a complex sentence. This is
the approach followed by Brouwers et al. (2014) for
French; Bott and Saggion (2014) for Spanish; Caseli
et al. (2009) for Brazilian Portuguese. A different
approach is advanced by Specia (2010) for Brazil-
ian Portuguese, who adopted phrase-based machine
learning from a parallel corpus. For Basque, Aran-
zabe et al. (2013) used the output of a readability
assessment system for detecting complex sentences,
which are simplified by a large set of hand-crafted
rules.

Typically, ATS approaches rely on the output of
a syntactic parser although the main cause of errors
for an ATS system is due to erroneous parses also
when state–of–the–art parsers are used (De Belder
et al., 2010; Siddharthan, 2011; Drndarević et al.,
2013; Brouwers et al., 2014; Siddharthan and An-
grosh, 2014). In particular, this concerns relative
clause attachments and clause boundary identifica-
tion (Siddharthan and Angrosh, 2014). According
to Drndarević et al. (2013), one third of ATS errors
depends on previous parsing errors and Brouwers et
al. (2014) revealed that 89% of text simplification
(TS) errors are due to preprocessing errors.

ATS is largely underinvestigated for what con-
cerns Italian. The only exception is (Barlacchi and
Tonelli, 2013), who devised a rule–based architec-
ture focusing on a limited set of linguistic structures,
but no previous study has addressed ATS by using
parallel corpora.

2 Our Contribution

We present the first Italian resource for automatic
and semi-automatic text simplification. We col-
lected and hand–aligned two monolingual corpora

representative of two different strategies of manual
simplification and addressing different target read-
ers. The corpora were annotated with a set of rules
designed to capture simplification operations at di-
verse levels of linguistic description. There are sev-
eral motivations underlying the proposed approach.
As a universal native simplified–language speaker
does not exist (Siddharthan, 2014), it follows that
ATS systems are typically specialized with respect
to a specific target user. Hence, we introduce a new
annotation scheme able to handle different simpli-
fication strategies, at the level of both method and
target users.

This is the starting point to develop a flexible au-
tomatic or semi–automatic TS system.The proposed
resource can be used to train a supervised classifier
aimed at carrying out a semi–automatic TS task. In
the semi–automatic scenario, the system will be able
to identify the areas of linguistic complexity within a
sentence and suggest the authors the most appropri-
ate simplification rule for the intended audience and
domain. This classifier, using the information ex-
tracted from the syntactic tree as one of the features
exploited to predict the rules to be applied, is ex-
pected to be more robust to syntactic parsing errors
than TS systems based on hand–crafted or automat-
ically acquired rules heavily relying on parses trans-
formations. To give an idea of how wrong parses
can affect a TS system, let’s consider that the ac-
curacy of the state-of-the-art dependency parser for
Italian is 87.89% in terms of Labeled Attachment
Score corresponding to 293 erroneously parsed sen-
tences out of the total of 376, i.e. 78% of the test
sentences contain at least one parsing error.1. More-
over, it should be noted that in a TS scenario the
parsers are typically tested on domains outside of
the data from which they were trained or developed
on (i.e. out–domain scenario) and it is widely ac-
knowledged that state–of–the–art statistical parsers
have a dramatic drop of accuracy when tested in a
out–domain scenario (Gildea, 2001).

In this paper, we also carried out a comparative
analysis between different TS strategies addressing
different target users: this was possible thanks to

1These data are reported in the Evalita evaluation campaign
and were obtained by combining four state–of–the–art parsers
using a test set with gold (i.e. manually revised) part–of–speech
tags (Bosco et al., 2014)

the internal composition of the developed resource,
which allowed us to investigate the effects of sim-
plification rules on the linguistic peculiarities of
abridged texts with respect to their original versions.

3 Corpora

The annotated resource2 presented here is made up
of two sub–corpora that can be considered represen-
tative of two different TS strategies: the “structural”
and the “intuitive” strategy, following Allen (2009)’s
definition, who addressed TS in the context of L2
learning. The former uses predefined graded lists
(covering both word and structural levels) or tra-
ditional readability formulas. The latter is depen-
dent on the author’s teaching experience and per-
sonal judgments about the comprehension ability of
learners. Although with main distinctions, this clas-
sification can be applied for our purpose.

The first sub–corpus (Terence) contains 32 short
novels for children and their manually simplified
version.3 The simplification was carried out in a
cumulative fashion with the aim of improving the
comprehension of the original text at three differ-
ent levels: global coherence, local cohesion and lex-
icon/syntax. To align the corpus, we selected the
last two levels of simplification (i.e. local cohesion
and lexicon/syntax) which were considered respec-
tively as the original and the simplified version. This
was motivated by the need of tackling only those
textual simplification aspects with a counterpart at
the morpho–syntactic and syntactic level. We hand-
aligned the resulting 1036 original sentences to the
1060 simplified ones. The results (Table 1) provide
some insights into the typology of human editing
operations. In 90% of the cases a 1:1 alignment is
reported; 39 original sentences (3.75%) have a cor-
respondence 1:2, thus suggesting an occurred split;
2 original sentences underwent a three–fold split
(0.19%), i.e. they correspond to three sentences in
the simplified version; 15 pairs of original sentences
were merged into a single one (2.88%). Finally, the
percentage of unaligned sentences is 1%.

The second sub–corpus (Teacher) is composed by
24 pairs of original/simplified texts, which were col-

lected by surfing specialized educational websites
providing free resources for teachers. They cover
different textual genres, such as literature (e.g. ex-
tracts from famous Italian novels) and handbooks for
high school on diverse subjects (e.g. history, geogra-
phy), and they are addressed to different targets. Un-
like Terence, the simplification was performed inde-
pendently by a teacher, with the aim of adapting the
text to the need of audience, typically L2 students
with at least a B2 level in Italian. Thus, Teacher can
be considered as an instance of “intuitive” simplifi-
cation: while the target is usually the same (i.e. L2
learners), each text was produced by a different au-
thor and the interventions made on the text span over
different linguistic levels without any predefined dis-
tinction or hierarchy. On the contrary, Terence ex-
emplifies a “structural” simplification, since: i) it
was produced by a pool of experts; ii) it addressed a
well–defined target; iii) it was consistent with a pre-
defined guideline tackling the simplification at three
separate textual dimensions. This can also explain
the higher percentage of texts which were perfectly
aligned at sentence level (92.1% see Table 1) with
respect to Teacher (68.32%).

To compare the two different simplification strate-
gies with respect to the effect of the simplification
process, we evaluated the two corpora with the read-
ability index existing for the Italian language, i.e.
READ–IT (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011). For both the
corpora, we calculated the Spearman’s correlation
between the scores obtained by different READ–IT
models (i.e. using different types of linguistic fea-
tures) on the original and the simplified version. As
reported in Table 2, the two simplified corpora are
significantly correlated with all READ–IT models.
In particular, Teacher is especially correlated with
the model using a combination of raw text and lex-
ical features (READ–IT lexical model in Table 2).
This possibly follows from the “intuitive” simplifi-
cation process of Teacher that mostly concerns lexi-
cal substitution operations.

are also marked with ∗.

The two corpora were annotated by two under-
graduate students in computational linguistics, who
received preliminary training lessons on the simpli-
fication rules covered by the annotation tagset. Each
student annotated a different corpus and all their an-
notations were verified by a trained linguist.

4 Simplification Annotation Scheme

We defined an annotation scheme covering six
macro–categories: split, merge, reordering, insert,
delete and transformation. Following Bott and Sag-
gion (2014), we used a two–level structure, i.e. for
some categories more specific subclassed have been
introduced. In Table 3, we show the tagset of the
annotation scheme. In the following examples ex-
tracted from the annotated corpus, we bolded the
text span marked in the original sentence by each
rule-tag and we highlighted in italics the correspond-
ing text span in the simplified version.4

Split: it is the most investigated operation in
ATS, for both human– and machine–oriented ap-
plications. Typically, a split affects coordinate
clauses (introduced by coordinate conjunctions,
colons or semicolons), subordinate clauses (e.g.
non–restrictive relative clauses), appositive and ad-
verbial phrases. Nevertheless, we do not expect that
each of these sentences undergoes a split, as the hu-
man expert may prefer not to detach two clauses,
for instance when a subordinate clause provides the
necessary background information to understand the
matrix clause.

O: Mamma Gorilla sembrava completamente distrutta
per le cure che dava al suo vivace cuccioletto Tito,
che stava giocando vicino alle grosse sbarre di ac-

4In all the examples of aligned sentences, O stands for orig-
inal and S for simplified.

ciaio che circondavano il recinto. [Mummy Go-
rilla looked completely worn out from looking after
her lively baby, Tod, who was playing by the thick
steel bars that surrounded the enclosure.]

S: Mamma Gorilla sembrava proprio distrutta per le
cure che dava al suo vivace cuccioletto Tito. Tito
stava giocando vicino alle grosse sbarre di acciaio
che erano intorno alla loro area. [Mummy Gorilla
looked completely worn out from looking after her
lively baby Tod. Tod was playing by the thick steel
bars that surrounded the enclosure.]

Merge: it is to be taken as the reverse of split, i.e.
the operation by which two (or more) original sen-
tences are joined into a unique simplified sentence.
This transformation is less likely to be adopted, as it
creates semantically denser sentences, more difficult
to process (Kintsh and Keenan, 1973). Yet, to some
extent (see the alignment results), this is a choice
the expert can make and it can be interesting to ver-
ify whether the sentences susceptible to be merged
display any regular pattern of linguistic features that
can be automatically captured.

O: Clara pensò che fosse uno dei cigni. Ma poi si
rese conto che stava urlando! [Clara thought it
was one of the swans. But then she realised it was
shouting!]

S: In un primo momento, Clara pensò che fosse uno
dei cigni, ma poi sentı̀ urlare! [At first, Clara
thought it was one of the swans, but then she heard
it shouting.]

Reordering: this tag marks word order changes be-
tween the original sentence and its simplified coun-
terpart. Clearly, altering the position of the elements
in a sentence depends, in turn, upon modifications
at lexicon or syntax; e.g. replacing an object clitic
pronoun (which is preverbal with finite verbs in Ital-
ian) with its full lexical antecedent yields the un-
marked order SVO, associated with easier compre-
hension and earlier acquisition (Slobin and Bever,
1982). Conversely, the author of the simplified text
may sometimes prefer a non–canonical order, when
she believes e.g. that it allows the reader to keep the
focus stable over two or more sentences.

O: Il passante gli spiegò che, per arrivare al
bidone,doveva contare ben 5 bidoni a partire dal
semaforo. [The passer-by explained him that, to get
to the dustbin, he had to count exactly 5 dustbins
starting from the traffic light.]

S: Il signore spiegò a Ugolino che doveva contare 5
bidoni a partire dal semaforo, per arrivare al bidone
della carta. [The man explained Little Hugh that he
had to count 5 dustbins starting from the traffic light
to get to the wastepaper dustbin.]

Insert: the process of simplification may even re-
sult in a longer sentence, because of the insertion of
words or phrases that provide supportive informa-
tion to the original sentence. Despite the cognitive
literature suggests reducing the inference load of a
text, especially with less skilled or low–knowledge
readers (Ozuru et al., 2009), it is difficult to predict
what an author will actually add to the original sen-
tence to make it clearer. It can happen that the sen-
tence is elliptical, i.e. syntactically compressed, and
the difficulty depends on the ability to retrieve the
missing arguments, which are then made explicit as
a result of the simplification. Our annotation scheme
has introduced two more specific tags to mark inser-
tions: one for verbs and one for subject. The latter
signals the transformation of a covert subject into a
lexical noun phrase5.

O: Essendo da poco andata in pensione dal suo lavoro,
disse che le mancavano i suoi studenti [...] [Having
just retired from her job, she said that she missed
her students]

5The covert/overt subject realization is an option available
in null–subject languages like Italian.

S: Essendo da poco andata in pensione dal suo lavoro
come insegnante, disse che le mancavano i suoi stu-
denti [...] [Having just retired from her job as a
school teacher, she said that she missed her stu-
dents]

Delete: dropping redundant information is also a
strategy for simplifying a text. As for the insert
tag, also deletion is largely unpredictable, although
we can imagine that simplified sentences would con-
tain less adjunct phrases (e.g. adverbs or adjectives).
Such occurrences have been marked with the un-
derspecified delete rule; two more restricted tags,
delete verb and delete subj, have been introduced
to signal, respectively, the deletion of a verb and
of an overt subject (made implicit and recoverable
through verb agreement morphology).

O: Sembrò veramente che il fiume stesse per strari-
pare. [It really seemed that the river was going to
burst.]

S: Il fiume stava per straripare. [The river was going
to burst.]

Transformation: this label covers six typologies of
transformations that a sentence may undergo to be-
come more comprehensible for the intended reader.
Such modifications can affect the sentence at the lex-
ical, morpho–syntactic and syntactic level, also giv-
ing rise to overlapping phenomena. Our annotation

35



scheme has intended to cover the following phenom-
ena.
– Lexical substitution (word level): when a single
word is replaced by another word (or more than
one), which is usually a more common synonym or
a less specific term.

O: Il passante gli spiegò che, per arrivare al bidone,
doveva contare ben 5 bidoni a partire dal semaforo.
[The passer-by explained him that, to get to the
dustbin, he had to count exactly 5 dustbins starting
from the traffic light.]

S: Il signore spiegò a Ugolino che doveva contare 5
bidoni a partire dal semaforo, per arrivare al bidone
della carta. [The man explained to Little Hug that
he had to count 5 dustbins starting from the traffic
light, to get to the dustbin.]

Given the relevance of lexical changes in TS,
which is also confirmed by our results, previous
works have proposed feasible ways to automatize
lexical simplification, e.g. by relying on electronic
resources, such as WordNet (De Belder et al., 2010)
or word frequency lists (Drndarevic et al., 2012).
However, synonyms or hypernyms replacements do
not cover all the editing options, since we observed
that an author might also restate the meaning of the
complex word with a multi-word pharaphrase.

O: Tutti si precipitarono verso il tendone. [Everyone
rashed outside the tent.]

S: Tutti si misero a correre verso la tenda. [Everyone
came running outside the tent.]

– Lexical substitution (phrase level): it differs from
the previous rule with respect to the “size” of the
original unit involved in the substitution, which in
this case consists of a phrase. But, similarly to the
previous one, the simplified unit can be either a sin-
gle word or a phrase itself.

O: Persino il tempo era di buon umore. [Even the
weather was in a party mood.]

S: Persino il tempo era buono. [Even the weather was
good.]

– Anaphoric replacement: the substitution of a ref-
erent pronoun with its full lexical antecedent (a def-
inite noun phrase or a proper noun).

O: Il passante gli spiegò che, per arrivare al bidone,
doveva contare ben 5 bidoni [...] [The passer-by ex-
plained him that, to get to the dustbin, he had to
count exactly 5 dustbins]

S: Il signore spiegò a Ugolino che doveva contare 5
bidoni a partire dal semaforo [...] [The man ex-
plained to Little Hug that he had to count 5 dustbins
starting from the traffic light]

– Noun to Verb: when a nominalization or a sup-
port verb construction is replaced by a simple verb.
In this case, the correspondence between the noun
and the verb involved in the transformation had to
be suggested by the presence of a similar morpho-
logical root.

O: Il giorno della partenza, i bambini salutarono i loro
genitori durante la colazione. [On the day of their
parents’ departure, the children said their good-
byes to their parents over breakfast.]

S: Il giorno in cui i genitori partirono, i bambini li
salutarono durante la colazione. [The day that their
parents left, the children said them goodbye over
breakfast.]

– Verb to Noun: to mark the presence of a nominal-
ization or of a support verb construction instead of
an original simple verb.

O: Benedetto era molto arrabbiato e voleva vendicare
sua sorella. [Ben was very angry and he wanted to
avenge his sister.]

S: Benedetto era molto arrabbiato e voleva ottenere
vendetta per sua sorella. [Ben was very angry and
he wanted to get revenge for his sister.]

– Verbal voice: to signal the transformation of a pas-
sive sentence into an active or vice versa. Within
both the corpora very few examples of the latter
were found; this result was expected since passive
sentences represent an instance of non-canonical or-
der: they are acquired later by typically developing
children (Maratsos, 1974; Bever, 1970) (for Italian,
(Cipriani et al., 1993; Ciccarelli, 1998)) and have
been reported as problematic for atypical popula-
tions, e.g. deaf children (Volpato, 2010). Yet, the
“passivization” rule may still be productive in other
textual typologies, where it can happen that the au-
thor of the simplification prefers not only to keep,
but even to insert, a passive, in order to avoid more
unusual syntactic constructs in Italian (such as im-
personal sentences). This is also in line with what
Bott and Saggion (2014) observed for passives.

O: Solo il papà di Luisa, “Crispino mangia cracker”
era dispiaciuto, perché era stato battuto da To-
nio Battaglia. [Only Louise’s Dad, “Cream

36



Cracker Craig”, was disappointed, because he’d
been beaten by Tod Baxter.]

S: Solo il papà di Luisa era triste, perché Tonio
Battaglia lo aveva battuto. [Only Louise’s Dad was
sad, because Tod Baxter had beaten him.]

– Verbal features: Italian is a language with a
rich inflectional paradigm and changes affecting ver-
bal features (mood, tense) have proven useful in
discriminating between easy– and difficult–to–read
texts in readability assessment task (Dell’Orletta et
al., 2011). Poor comprehenders also find it difficult
to properly master verb inflectional morphology; the
same holds for other categories of atypical readers,
e.g. dyslexics (Fiorin, 2009), but also for L2 learners
(Sorace, 1993); thus, the simplification, according to
the intended target, will probably alter the distribu-
tion of verbal features.

O: Non capisco e non potrei parlare con nessuno. [I
can’t understand and I could not talk to anybody.]

S: Non capisco e non posso parlare di queste cose con
nessuno. [I can’t understand and I can not speak of
such things to anybody.]

5 Simplification Rules and Linguistic
Features

The analysis of the frequency distribution of each
rule within the two annotated corpora (Table 3) al-
lows us capturing similarities and variations across
corpora representing two different TS strategies and
addressed to diverse categories of readers. The ma-
jority of rules are similarly distributed across the
two corpora showing that a number of simplifica-
tion choices are shared by a team of experts and in-
dependent teachers. This is an interesting finding
as it might suggest the existence of an “indepen-
dent” simplification process shared by approaches
targeting different audience and based on differ-
ent simplification methods. Exceptions are repre-
sented by some rules involving verbs (i.e. trans-
formation of verbal features and insert verb) and
anaphoric replacements. For what concerns the lat-
ter, it should be noted that the Terence original ver-
sion here adopted inherits previous sentence trans-
formations covering, among others, anaphoric re-
placements. The different distribution of rules in-
volving verbs might reflect both the different sim-
plification choices related to the structural and in-

tuitive simplification strategies and the different tex-
tual genres included in Teacher and Terence.

For a more in-depth analysis of the impact and
the significance of each simplification rule, we fo-
cused on the most frequently applied rules and we
chose a set of features which are typically involved
in automatic readability assessment and also express
language–specific peculiarities. For each linguis-
tic feature, we calculated the Spearman’s correlation
between the feature values extracted from the origi-
nal text and from the simplified version with respect
to the selected rules.

5.1 Linguistic Features
The set of linguistic features spans across different
levels of linguistic analysis and are broadly clas-
sifiable into four main classes: raw text, lexical,
morpho–syntactic and syntactic features, shortly de-
scribed below. They were extracted from the corpora
automatically tagged by the part–of–speech tagger
described in Dell’Orletta (2009) and dependency–
parsed by the DeSR parser (Attardi, 2006).

Raw text features (Features [1–2] in Table 4)
are typically used within traditional readability met-
rics and include sentence length (average number of
words per sentence), and word length (average num-
ber of characters per words).

Feature [3] refers to the percentage of all unique
words (types) on the Basic Italian Vocabulary (BIV)
by De Mauro (2000) in the sentence. The BIV in-
cludes a list of 7,000 words highly familiar to Italian
native speakers.

The set of morpho–syntactic features [4–19]
ranges from the probability distribution of part–of–
speech types, to the lexical density of the text, cal-
culated as the ratio of content words (verbs, nouns,
adjectives and adverbs) to the total number of lex-
ical tokens in a text. It also includes verbal mood
and tense distributions, a language–specific feature
related to Italian rich verbal morphology.

The set of syntactic features [20–35] captures dif-
ferent aspects of the syntactic structure, such as:
– parse tree depth features, going from the depth
of the whole parse tree [26], calculated in terms of
the longest path from the root of the dependency tree
to some leaf, to a more specific feature referring to
the average depth of embedded complement ‘chains’
[23] governed by a nominal head and including ei-

37



ther prepositional complements or nominal and ad-
jectival modifiers;
– verbal predicate features, going from the arity of
verbs [27], meant as the number of instantiated de-
pendency links sharing the same verbal head (cov-
ering both arguments and modifiers), to the distri-
bution of verbal roots with explicit subject [28] with
respect to all sentence roots occurring in a text and
the relative ordering of subject and object with re-
spect to the verbal head [29–32].
– subordination features include the distribution of
subordinate vs. main clauses [20–21]; for subordi-
nates, their relative ordering with respect to the main
clause [33–34] and the average depth of ‘chains’ of
embedded subordinate clauses [22];
– the length of dependency links is calculated in
terms of the words occurring between the syntac-
tic head and the dependent: the feature includes the
length of all dependency links [24] and the maximum
dependency links [25];
– clause length [35] is measured as the number of
tokens occurring within a clause.

5.2 Correlation
Table 4 illustrates the correlations between the lin-
guistic features and the most frequently applied sim-
plification rules. It can be noted that all the rules
are strongly correlated with the linguistic features.
This reveals that these rules have a great impact
on the linguistic structure of the simplified text. It
also shows the effectiveness of such features to cap-
ture simplification operations at varying degrees of
linguistic description. Interestingly, if we examine
more in-depth the significance value, we can ob-
serve a distinction between the two corpora. Ter-
ence reports a higher number of stronger correla-
tions (i.e. p < 0.001) with respect to Teacher.
These results seem to provide an evidence to the ex-
istence of different simplification strategies, which
vary according to the person (i.e. expert vs. non-
expert), textual genres and intended target. Specifi-
cally, the teachers prefer a more vocabulary-oriented
simplification approach, as testified by a) the highest
significant correlations reported by the rules deal-
ing with lexical replacements (i.e. LexSub word and
LexSub phrase) and b) the fact that the majority of
significant correlations at > 0.5 affects linguistic
features from [1] to [19], i.e. features not dealing

with the syntactic structure. This might suggest that,
independently from the simplification rule adopted,
the resulting sentence has not undergone a strong
modification in its grammatical structure. This is
not the case of the “structural” simplification, in
which all the rules significantly correlate with both
lexical/morpho–syntactic features (set [1-19]) and
syntactic features (set [20-35]). On the other side,
the correlation results reported by the Delete, Lex-
Sub word and LexSub phrase rules reveal the exis-
tence of a common approach to simplification. In the
two corpora these rules are correlated with mainly
the same linguistic features.

For what concerns the evaluation of the over-
all significance of each rule, we observe that a
wide number of correlations at ≥ 0.6 occurs es-
pecially when Split and LexSub word were applied.
Both these simplification operations are expected to
greatly redefine the structure of the sentence; a split
e.g. not only correlates with sentence length, but it
also reduces prepositional chains [23]. Split might
be triggered by long noun phrases with a deverbal
noun; to simplify them the author could have chosen
to turn them into an autonomous sentence, by also
adding a verb (see the high correlation between [23]
and InsertVerb).

6 Conclusion

We have presented the first Italian corpus for text
simplification. This annotated resource is composed
by two monolingual parallel corpora, representing
two different strategies of simplification: “struc-
tural” and “intuitive”. We have defined an annota-
tion scheme able to capture manual simplifications
at different levels of linguistic structure as well as
to handle the different strategies of simplification.
We have carried out an in-depth analysis of the im-
pact of each simplification rule with respect to a
set of linguistic features related to text complexity.
This study has highlighted the existence of an “in-
dependent” simplification process shared by the two
considered simplification approaches targeting dif-
ferent audience. We are currently using this finding
in the development of a semi–automatic supervised
TS system trained on the two corpora able to han-
dle these shared simplification phenomena. Current
developments are also devoted to refining the anno-
