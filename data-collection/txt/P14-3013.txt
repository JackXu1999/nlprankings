Abstract

Recently, we reported on our efforts to
build the first prototype of KurdNet. In
this proposal, we highlight the shortcom-
ings of the current prototype and put for-
ward a detailed plan to transform this pro-
totype to a full-fledged lexical database for
the Kurdish language.

1 Introduction

WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) has been used in nu-
merous natural language processing tasks such as
word sense disambiguation and information ex-
traction with considerable success. Motivated by
this success, many projects have been undertaken
to build similar lexical databases for other lan-
guages. Among the large-scale projects are Eu-
roWordNet (Vossen, 1998) and BalkaNet (Tufis et
al., 2004) for European languages and IndoWord-
Net (Bhattacharyya, 2010) for Indian languages.

Kurdish belongs to the Indo-European family of
languages and is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geo-
graphical region spanning the intersections of Iran,
Iraq, Turkey, and Syria (as showed in Figure 1).
Kurdish is a less-resourced language for which,
among other resources, no wordnet has been built
yet.

Despite having a large number (20 to 30 mil-
lions) of native speakers (Hassanpour et al., 2012;
Haig and Matras, 2002), Kurdish is among the
less-resourced languages for which the only lin-
guistic resource available on the Web is raw
text (Walther and Sagot, 2010). In order to ad-
dress this resource-scarceness problem, the Kur-
dish language processing project (KLPP1) has
been recently launched at University of Kurdis-
tan. Among the the major linguistic resources that
KLPP has been trying to develop is KurdNet, a

WordNet-like lexical database for the Kurdish lan-
guage. Earlier this year, we reported (Aliabadi
et al., 2014) on our effort to build the first pro-
totype of KurdNet. In this paper, we propose a
plan to transform this preliminary version into a
full-fledged and functional lexical database.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We first (in Section 2) give a brief overview of the
current state of KurdNet. Then after highlighting
the main shortcomings of the current prototype in
Section 3, we present our plan to transform this
prototype to a full-blown lexical database for the
Kurdish language in Section 4. We conclude the
paper in Section 5.

2 KurdNet: State-of-the-Art

In our previous work (Aliabadi et al., 2014), we
described the steps that we have taken to build the
first prototype of KurdNet. There, we

1. highlighted the main challenges in building
a wordnet for the Kurdish language (includ-
ing its inherent diversity and morphological
complexity),

2. built the first prototype of KurdNet, the Kur-
dish WordNet (see a summary below), and

94



3. conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the
impact of KurdNet on Kurdish information
retrieval.

In the following, we first define the scope of our
first prototype, then after justifying our choice of
construction model, we describe KurdNet’s indi-
vidual elements.

2.1 Scope
Kurdish has two main dialects (Esmaili and
Salavati, 2013): Sorani and Kurmanji. In the first
prototype of KurdNet we focus only on the So-
rani dialect. This is mainly due to lack of an avail-
able and reliable Kurmanji-to-English dictionary.
Moreover, processing Sorani is in general more
challenging than Kurmanji (Esmaili et al., 2013a).

2.2 Methodology
There are two well-known models for building
wordnets for a language (Vossen, 1998):

• Expand: in this model, the synsets are built
in correspondence with the WordNet synsets
and the semantic relations are directly im-
ported. It has been used for Italian in Mul-
tiWordNet and for Spanish in EuroWordNet.

• Merge: in this model, the synsets and rela-
tions are first built independently and then
they are aligned with WordNet’s. It has been
the dominant model in building BalkaNet and
EuroWordNet.

The expand model seems less complex and
guarantees the highest degree of compatibility
across different wordnets. But it also has potential
drawbacks. The most serious risk is that of forcing
an excessive dependency on the lexical and con-
ceptual structure of one of the languages involved,
as pointed out in (Vossen, 1996).

In our project, we follow the Expand model,
since it can be partly automated and therefore
would be faster. More precisely, we aim at cre-
ating a Kurdish translation/alignment for the Base
Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) which is a set of
5,000 essential concepts (i.e. synsets) that play
a major role in the wordnets. Base Concepts
(BC) is available on the Global WordNet Associa-
tion (GWA)’s Web page2. The Entity-Relationship
(ER) model for the data represented in Base Con-
cept is shown in Figure 2. A sample synset is de-
picted in Figure 3.

2.3 Elements

Since KurdNet follows the Expand model, it
inherits most of Base Concepts’ structural prop-
erties, including: synsets and the lexical relations
among them, POS, Domain, BCS, and SUMO.
KurdNet’s language-specific aspects, on the other
hand, have been built using a semi-automatic
approach. Below, we elaborate on the details of
construction the remaining three elements.

Synset Alignments: for each synset in
BC, its counterpart in KurdNet is defined
semi-automatically. We first use Dictio (a Sorani-
English dictionary, see Section 4.2) to translate its
literals (words). Having compiled the translation
lists, we combine them in two different ways:
(i) a maximal alignment (abbr. max) which is a
superset of all lists, and (ii) a minimal alignment
(abbr. min) which is a subset of non-empty
lists. Figure 4 shows an illustration of these two
combination variants. In future, we plan to apply

more advanced techniques, similar to the graph
algorithms described in (Flati and Navigli, 2012).

Usage Examples: we have taken a corpus-
assisted approach to speed-up the process of
providing usage examples for each aligned synset.
To this end, we: (i) extract all sentences (820,203)
of the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati, 2013),
(ii) lemmatize the corpus to extract all the lemmas
(278,873), and (iii) construct a lemma-to-sentence
inverted index. In the current version of KurdNet,
for each synset we build a pool of sentences
by fetching the first 5 sentences of each of its
literals from the inverted list. These pools will
later be assessed by lexicographers to filter out
non-relevant instances. In future, more sophisti-
cated approaches can be applied (e.g., exploiting
contextual information).

Definitions: due to lack of proper translation
tools, this element was aligned manually. We
built a graphical user interface to facilitate the
lexicographers’ task.

Table 1 shows a summary of KurdNet’s statisti-
cal properties along with those of Base Concepts.

freely accessible and can be obtained from (KLPP,

3 KurdNet: Shortcomings

The current version of KurdNet is quite basic and
therefore its applicability is very limited. In order
to expand the usability of KurdNet, the following
shortcomings must be overcome:

3.1 Incomplete Coverage of Kurdish
Vocabulary

KurdNet has been built as an alignment for Base
Concepts and since Base Concepts contains only
a small subset of English vocabulary, KurdNet’s
coverage is inevitably small. Furthermore, as it
can be seen in Table 1, due to the limitations of
the dictionaries used, not all English words in the
Base Concepts (Vossen et al., 1998) have an equiv-
alent in KurdNet. Hence the current mapping be-
tween WordNet and KurdNet is only partial. Fi-
nally, the lexical idiosyncrasies between Kurdish
and English should be identified and included in
KurdNet.

3.2 Refinement of Automatically-Generated
Content

Each synset must contain a comprehensive defini-
tion and a practical example. While KurdNet def-
initions are provided manually and therefore en-
joy high quality, the actual words in each synset
as well as the usage examples have been produced
manually. In order to increase the reliability and
correctness of KurdNets, there need to be mech-
anisms to refine the existing machine-generated
components.

3.3 Limited Support for Semantic Relation
Types

As shown in Table 2, there are several WordNet
semantic relations for each syntactic categories.
Each syntactic categories are organized to compo-
nent files (Miller et al., 1993). The most impor-
tant semantic relation in WordNet is Hyponymy
and this relation is the only one support in Kurd-
Net (Aliabadi et al., 2014).

96



3.4 Absence of Kurmanji Synsets

Kurdish is considered a bi-standard3 lan-
guage (Gautier, 1998; Hassanpour et al., 2012):
the Sorani dialect written in an Arabic-based
alphabet and the Kurmanji dialect written in a
Latin-based alphabet. The linguistics features
distinguishing these two dialects are phonolog-
ical, lexical, and morphological. The important
morphological differences that concern the con-
struction of KurdNet are (MacKenzie, 1961;
Haig and Matras, 2002): (i) in contrast to Sorani,
Kurmanji has retained both gender (feminine
v. masculine) and case opposition (absolute v.
oblique) for nouns and pronouns, and (ii) while
is Kurmanji passive voice is constructed using
the helper verb “hatin”, in Sorani it is created via
verb morphology. As explained in Section 2, the
current KurdNet prototype only covers the Sorani
dialect and therefore it should be extended to
include the Kurmanji dialect as well. This would
require not only using similar resources to those
reported in this paper, but also building a mapping
system between the Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.

3.5 Dictionary Imperfections

Dictio, the dictionary that was used for building
KurdNet, is relatively small. We have recently
discovered new linguistics resources that can im-
prove the quality of automatic translation of En-
glish words and sentences into Kurdish and vice
versa (see Section 4.2).

4 KurdNet: Extension Plan

4.1 Goals and Envisioned Outcomes

The main objectives and expected artefacts for this
proposals are the following:

• to refine the current prototype, through use
of intelligent algorithms and/or manual assis-
tance.

• to winden the scope (i.e., including Kurmanji
synsets), the coverage (i.e., going beyond
Base Concepts) , and richness (supporting
additional semantic relations) of the current
version.

3Within KLPP, our focus has been on Sorani and Kur-
manji which are the two most widely-spoken and closely-
related dialects (Haig and Matras, 2002; Walther and Sagot,
2010).

• to produce tool kits for users (e.g. graphical
interfaces), developers (e.g., drivers and pro-
gramming interfaces), and contributors (e.g.,
navigation/edition tools).

• to design and conduct experiments in order to
assess the effectiveness of KurdNet in NLP
and IR applications.

• to publish the innovative aspects as research
papers.

4.2 Available Resources
Below are the Kurdish language resources that can
be potentially used throughout this project:

• KLPP Resources
− the Pewan corpus (Esmaili and Salavati,
2013): for both Sorani and Kurmanji dialects.
Its basic statistics are shown in Table 3
− the Renoos lemmatizer (Salavati et al.,
2013): it is the result of a major revision of
Jedar, a Kurdish stemmer whose outputs are
stems.
− the Pewan test collection (Esmaili et al.,
2013b): is a test collection for both Sorani
and Kurmanji.

• Online Dictionaries:
− Dictio: an English-to-Sorani dictionary
with more than 13,000 headwords. It em-
ploys a collaborative mechanism for enrich-
ment.
− Ferheng: a collection of dictionaries for
the Kurmanji dialect with sizes ranging from
medium (around 25,000 entries, for German
and Turkish) to small (around 4,500, for En-
glish).
− Inkurdish4: a new and high-quality trans-
lation between Sorani Kurdish and English.
− English Kurdish Translation5: especially
can translate words in Kurmanji and English
together.
− Freelang6:supports 4000 words in kur-
manji.
− Glosbe7: is a multilingual dictionary, that
includes Soranii, Kurmanj, and English .
− Globalglossary8 is a Kurdish-English dic-
tionary.

Table 3: The Pewan Corpus’ Basic Statistics (Es-
maili and Salavati, 2013)

• Wikipedia
It currently has more than 12,000 Sorani9 and
20,000 Kurmanji10 articles. One useful ap-
plication of these entries is to build a parallel
collection of named entities across both di-
alects.

4.3 Methodology
As mentioned in Section 2, we have adopted
the Expand model to build KurdNet. According
to (Vossen, 1996), the MultiWordNet (MWN11)
model (Expand model) seems less complex and
guarantees the highest degree of compatibility
across different wordnets. The MWN model also
has potential drawbacks. The most serious risk
is that of forcing an excessive dependency on the
lexical and conceptual structure of one of the lan-
guages involved, as (Vossen, 1996) points out.
This risk can be considerably reduced by allow-
ing the new wordnet to diverge, when necessary,
from the PWN.

Another important advantage of the MWN
model is that automatic procedures can be devised
to speed up both the construction of correspond-
ing synsets and the detection of divergences be-
tween PWN and the wordnet being built. Accord-
ing to the Expand model, the aim is to build, when-
ever possible, Kurdish synsets which are synony-
mous (semantically correspondent) with the PWN
synsets. The second strategy is based on Kurdish-
to-English translations. For each sense of a Kur-
dish word K, we look for a PWN synset S in-
cluding at least one English translation of K and
a link between K and S is established (Pianta et
al., 2002).

For the correct alignment of Sorani and Kur-
manji synsets, we propose to use three comple-
mentary approaches:

• use of English (here, Base Concepts) synsets
as reference points between both dictionary-
translated synsets of Sorani and Kurmanji.

The results would be structured as shown in
Table 4.

• development of a transliteration/translation
engine between Sorani and Kurmanji, that
is capable of matching closely-related words
and synstes.

• For the cases in which, more than one or no
mapping has been found, manual filtering or
insertion will be used.

4.4 Timing and Logistics

Based on our estimates, we plan to carry out the
research highlighted in this paper in the course of
one-and-an-half to two years. To this end, a time-
line has been prepared (see Figure 5). We believe
that since the preliminary work on KurdNet (e.g.,
literature review, development of the first proto-
type) has already been completed, most of our re-
sources will be dedicated to designing new algo-
rithms and system building.

Moreover, in terms of technical logistics, we
are hopeful to receive full IT and library systems
support from the Science and Research Branch Is-
lamic Azad University(SRBIAU12) and University
of Kurdistan(UoK13).

5 Summary

In this paper, we underlined the major shortcom-
ings in the current KurdNet prototype and pro-
posed a concrete plan to enrich the current pro-
totype, so that it can be used in development of
Kurdish language processing systems.
