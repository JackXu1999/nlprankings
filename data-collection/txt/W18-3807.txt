Abstract 

This paper relies on the work developed by the research team IES_UNR (Argentina) and pre-
sents a pedagogical application of NooJ for the teaching and learning of Spanish as a foreign 
language. However, as this proposal specifically addresses learners of Spanish whose mother 
tongue is Italian, it also entailed vital collaboration with Mario Monteleone from the University 
of Salerno, Italy. The adjective was chosen on account of its lower frequency of occurrence in 
texts written in Spanish, and particularly in the Argentine Rioplatense variety, and with the aim 
of developing strategies to increase its use. The features that the adjective shares with other 
grammatical categories render it extremely productive and provide elements that enrich the 
learner’s proficiency. The reference corpus contains the front pages of the Argentinian newspa-
per Clarín related to an emblematic historical moment, whose starting point is March 24, 1976, 
when a military coup began, and covers a thirty year period until March 24, 2006. The use of 
the linguistic resources created in NooJ for the automatic processing of texts written in Spanish 
accounts for the adjective in a relevant historical context for Argentina.  

1 Introduction* 

1.1 Research Subject 

Our subject matter deals with the pedagogical application of NooJ in the teaching and learning of Span-
ish as a foreign language, which relies on the research project carried out by the IES_UNR group since 
2015 (Rodrigo et al. 2018). An antecedent of this work can be observed in Frigière and Fuentes (2015), 
which examines the pedagogical application of NooJ for learners of French as a foreign language. In 
this paper, we focus on a specific group: native speakers of Italian learning Spanish as a foreign lan-
guage. Our interest lies in a main grammatical category: the adjective. And our work entails the follow-
ing steps: (1) selection of a reference corpus in Spanish; (2) presentation of the adjective in relation to 
other categories and inserted in real texts; (3) use of NooJ for automatic text processing (Silberztein 
2015); and (4) presentation of a pedagogical proposal specifically directed to learners of Spanish whose 
mother tongue is Italian (see Appendix B). 

1.2 Reference corpus 

Our approach to Spanish takes the Argentine Rioplatense variety1 and centres on journalistic texts pro-
duced during thirty years in Argentina. These written texts represent an important historical moment 
since they are concerned with the last dictatorship and the democratic period immediately following it.

Our reference corpus, the Clarín_corpus,2 spans the years 1976 to 2006, and includes the same date each 
year, March 24, which was the day the Armed Forces took power by force in 1976 and overthrew the 
democratic Argentine government in charge of President María Estela Martínez de Perón. This repres-
sive de facto regime known as la Junta Militar “the Military Junta” seized power and ruled until De-
cember 1983, when a democratic government was again elected by the Argentinian people. The first 
front page that was published by Clarín when the coup d’état began is displayed in Figure 1. 

 

 

Figure 1. Front page published on March 24, 1976. 

The phrase Nuevo Gobierno “New Government” is a distant and neutral expression, whereas at the 
bottom right corner of the last front page of the corpus, which corresponds to March 24, 2006 (see 
Appendix A), the word noche “night,” in the expression A 30 años de la noche más larga “30 years after 
the longest night,” overtly condemns the beginning of the military regime. 

The corpus comprises 2,898 words and always deals with the front pages of the daily newspaper 
Clarín, assuming the front page to be a focus of journalistic and ideological attention. 

1.3 The adjective 

At a first stage, the adjective is presented in relation to the noun, the verb and the adverb; then, the 
frequency of adjectives in the Clarín_corpus is detected, in contrast to other categories. At a second 
stage, our intention is to observe what types of adjectives appear there. For instance, if the term de-
saparecido “disappeared” − which from a historical viewpoint has so many connotations in Argentina − 
is used, we observe what prefixes and suffixes are allowed with derivations, and in what types of con-
structions it is included. It is important to recall that the word desaparecido is also listed in English 
dictionaries. The Oxford Dictionary of English3 defines it as, “(especially in South America) a person 
who has disappeared, presumed killed by members of the armed services or the police.” And the Mer-
riam-Webster’s Dictionary4 offers the following definition: “an Argentine citizen who has been abducted 
and usually murdered by right-wing terrorists.”

1.4 Use of NooJ 

We have been working with the linguistic resources created for the Spanish Module Argentina,5 specif-
ically built by the IES_UNR research team to be used with NooJ,6 a computational tool designed by 
Max Silberztein. Our linguistic resources include dictionaries and grammars that are now in full devel-
opment. In this paper we will particularly deal with the dictionary of adjectives and some specific gram-
mars, leaving aside the dictionaries of other grammatical categories, which we use to recognise different 
types of entries such as nouns, verbs and adverbs.  

Similarly, the linguistic resources created for the Italian Module7 provide an anchor to the Italian 
learners of Spanish as a foreign language. Notice however that the Italian Module is not our main pur-
pose, for it is only tangentially addressed as a starting point for those learners.  

The choice of NooJ entails, above all, a methodological decision, which assumes that it is possible to 
create language teaching and learning situations by taking into account natural language processing. 
Then, it is understood that in a given environment and with a given input, learners formulate linguistic 
hypotheses that may be checked with a computational tool. The NooJ platform provides a favourable 
means to create this type of situations since: (1) it articulates different levels of analysis (orthography, 
morphology, syntax, etc.); (2) its connected dictionaries and grammars involve an integral knowledge 
of language; and (3) a single platform allows a comparison of Italian and Spanish using a common 
language. 

We will try to formulate possible language teaching and learning strategies for learners of Spanish as 
a foreign language, whose mother tongue is Italian. 

2 Development 

2.1 Comparison between the adjective and other categories in Spanish 

From a morphological viewpoint, Spanish nouns and adjectives share the same diminutive suffix -ito 
(e.g., mesa “table” - mesita “little table” and claro “clear”- clarito “very clear”). Many adjectives derive 
from nouns as in: cultura “culture” - cultural “cultural” and trabajo “work” - trabajador “worker”. 
From a syntactic viewpoint, an adjective may become the head of a noun phrase, as in the sentence el 
militar abrió fuego “the military (man) opened fire,” where the adjective militar “military” functions as 
a noun. 

From a morphological viewpoint, it is possible to create adjectives out of certain verbs (e.g., tonificar 
“to tone” - tonificante “toning” and desear “to desire” - deseable “desirable”). From a syntactic view-
point, past participles and adjectives occur in common environments, as in: un traje combinado “a com-
bined suit” and un traje azul “a blue suit.” 

From a morphological viewpoint, adjectives and adverbs admit the same diminutive and superlative 
suffixes -ito and -ísimo respectively (e.g., buenito “very good” - tempranito “very early” and buenísimo 
“great” - tempranísimo “very early”). Moreover, adverbs in -mente derive from adjectives as in: lento 
“slow” - lentamente “slowly.” From a syntactic and semantic viewpoint, adjectival adverbs constitute 
an intersection of adjectives and adverbs, as in the sentence llovió fuerte “it rained hard,” where fuerte  
“hard” functions as an adjectival adverb modifying the verb llovió; whereas in the phrase un fuerte viento 
“a strong wind,” fuerte “strong” is simply an adjective modifying a noun. 

2.2 Comparison between the adjective and other categories in Italian 

In Italian, adjectives have a high percentage of categorical ambiguity with two other grammatical cate-
gories, specifically those of the noun and the past participle (Monteleone 2016). A typical example of 
this ambiguity is the word anguished. In the sentence Giovanni è angosciato “Giovanni is anguished,” 
angosciato is an adjective. And in the sentence Paolo è un angosciato “Paul is an anguished man,” 
angosciato functions as a noun. However, in the sentence Paolo è angosciato da Giovanna “Paolo is 
anguished because of Giovanna,” angosciato is a past participle.

However, through specific automatic parsing tools (grammars, automata and finite-state transducers 
in NooJ), it is possible to solve this ambiguity and automatically tag syntactic sequences containing only 
adjectives. For reasons of space, those tools will not be discussed here, but developed in a future paper. 

3 Analysis of the Clarín_corpus 

3.1 Category frequency 

Within NooJ, we apply the command “Linguistic Analysis” in order to obtain the frequency of the cat-
egories contained in the corpus: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Then, by applying Locate for each 
category in turn: <N>, <V>, <ADJ> and <ADV>, the following piece of information is obtained:  
Nouns: 1,200; Verbs: 658; Adjectives: 353; Adverbs: 137; Other categories: 550 (conjunctions, prepo-
sitions, pronouns). 

The graph in Figure 2 shows that adjectives and adverbs are the least frequent out of the five catego-
ries. This data provides a first conclusion. The low frequency of adjectives points out that, due to its low 
proportion in the text input, this category is susceptible to be reinforced by the foreign language teacher’s 
intervention. 

 

 

Figure 2. Frequency of grammatical categories in the Clarín_corpus. 

3.2 Adjectives 

As frequency is our working criterion, those adjectives recording more frequency in the corpus represent 
the starting point. It is then specified which categories precede these adjectives, which morphological 
suffixes and prefixes they admit, and which adjectival structures are more recurrent. 

In Figure 3, after applying the commands “Locate” and “Statistical Analysis,” it is possible to recog-
nise the twenty most frequent adjectives in the corpus:  militar “military,” político “political,” política 
“political,” desaparecidos “disappeared,” general “general,” muertos “dead,” derechos “right,” Militar 
“Military,” Argentina “Argentinian, listas “ready,” heridos “injured,” humanos “human,” Armadas 
“Armed, solo “alone,” fuerte “strong,” primer “first,” exclusivo “exclusive,” argentino “Argentine,” 
central “central” and especial “special.” 

Some of the adjectives of the above list are selected in order to specify their inflectional and deriva-
tional paradigms, their context of occurrence and their syntactic structure. 
 



51

3.3 Morphological Inflection and Derivation 

Next, the inflectional paradigms of some of the most frequent adjectives are shown, as they are recorded 
in the inflectional grammars (Rodrigo et al. 2018) and in the dictionary of adjectives created in NooJ for 
the Spanish Module Argentina.  

The adjective militar “military” inflects like ÁGIL: militar, militares. The following words are part 
of its derivational paradigm as recorded in the dictionary of adjectives: antimilitar “anti-military,” anti-
militarista “anti-militarist,” paramilitar “paramilitary,” desmilitarizado “demilitarised,” militarizado 
“militarised.” 

The adjective político “political”  belongs to the paradigm FLACO: político, política, políticos, polí-
ticas. The words apolítico “apolitical,” geopolítico “geopolitical” and impolítico “non-political” are part 
of its derivational paradigm in the dictionary of adjectives. 

The adjective desaparecido “disappeared” also follows the paradigm FLACO: desaparecido, desa-
parecida, desaparecidos, desaparecidas. It is important to note that there are no words derived from 
desaparecido. 

The adjective general “general” inflects like ÁGIL: general, generales. The words generalista “gen-
eralist,” generalizable “generalisable” and generalizado “generalised” are part of its derivational para-
digm as it is recorded in the dictionary of adjectives. 

3.4 Context of occurrence 

The context of occurrence allows us to know which categories can accompany the adjective. The adjec-
tive militar “military” is preceded by nouns, as in the phrases reacción militar “military reaction,” au-
tocrítica militar “military self-criticism,” caudillo militar “military leader,” uniforme militar “military 
uniform,” golpe militar “military coup,” colegio militar “military college.” 

The adjectives  político, política “political” are preceded by nouns, as in: sector político “political 
sector,” Reforma política “political Reform,” favoritismo político “political favouritism,” enemigo pol-
ítico” political enemy” and terror político “political terror.” However, they may also be preceded by 
determiners: su política “his/her/their/your politics,” la política  “(the) politics.”  

The adjective desaparecidos “disappeared” is preceded by verbs (e.g., son desaparecidos “(they) are 
disappeared”), by the construction adjective+preposition (e.g., miles de desaparecidos “thousands of 
disappeared”), by numeral adjectives (e.g., catorce desaparecidos “fourteen disappeared”), and by 
nouns (e.g., alumnos desaparecidos “disappeared students”). 

3.5 Syntactic structure 

The analysis of two expressions containing adjectives and selected from the Clarín_corpus, Hubo miles 
de desaparecidos “There were thousands of disappeared” and último golpe militar “last military coup” 
will be shown. The first example is an impersonal sentence and the second one is a noun phrase.  



52

The basis of our analysis are the concepts developed by Bès (1999) and our approach is related to 
context-sensitive grammars. Our NooJ grammars take into account two types of constructions: nucleus 
phrases, such as a nucleus verb phrase (SVN), a nucleus adjective phrase (SADJN), a nucleus preposi-
tion phrase (SPN), a nucleus noun phrase (SNN), and larger phrases, such as the noun phrase 
(SINNOM), which contain nucleus phrases. These expressions will be analysed with the different syn-
tactic grammars available in the Spanish Module Argentina.   

In Spanish, the expression Hubo miles de desaparecidos “There were thousands of disappeared” is 
an impersonal sentence, i.e., without a subject. In the above example, we distinguish a nucleus adjective 
phrase (SADJN), miles “thousands” and a nucleus preposition phrase (SPN), de desaparecidos “of dis-
appeared,” both inside the noun phrase (SINNOM). On the other hand, the verb hubo “were,” which is 
the past indicative of haber “to be,” constitutes a nucleus verb phrase (SVN). These two structures make 
up the impersonal sentence, as it can be seen in Figure 4. 

 

 

Figure 4. Analysis of Hubo miles de desaparecidos. 

The corresponding main grammar for impersonal sentences is displayed in Figure 5. 
 

 

Figure 5. Grammar for impersonal sentences. 

As regards the second expression, the noun phrase último golpe militar “last military coup”, instead 
of analysing it with the “Linguistic Analysis” command, we use the NooJ “Show Debug” feature instead. 
By using “Show Debug,” it is possible to analyse whether the phrase entered can be considered accepta-
ble, when the noun phrase grammar is applied.  As can be seen in Figure 6, the result is a Perfect Match. 

 



53

 

Figure 6. Noun Phrase Grammar. 

“Show Debug” checks to see if the grammar designed for the noun phrase identifies that último “last” 
and militar “military” are two nucleus adjective phrases (SADJN), inside a larger unit, the noun phrase 
(SINNOM). The intermediate unit is the nucleus noun phrase (SNN), último golpe “last coup.” 

The analyses of both expressions, Hubo miles de desaparecidos “There were thousands of disap-
peared” and último golpe militar “last military coup,” show the adjective in two different syntactic con-
structions. In the first example, the adjective miles “thousands” is the nucleus of the noun phrase 
(SINNOM) miles de desaparecidos “thousands of disappeared” and is part of an impersonal sentence; 
in the second example, two adjectives occur in different positions: último “last” is a nucleus adjective 
phrase (SADJN) inside the nucleus noun phrase (SNN) último golpe “last coup,” and, at the same time, 
último “last” is part of the noun phrase (SINNOM) último golpe militar  “last military coup,” and militar 
“military” is a nucleus adjective phrase (SADJN) inside a noun phrase (SINNOM), peripheral to the 
nucleus noun phrase (SNN). 

The syntactic structure shows how the adjective can integrate noun phrases and even become the 
nucleus of a noun phrase. 

4 Conclusions 

In this paper, we have proposed a pedagogical application of the NooJ approach to a specific situation 
by choosing a significant corpus (the Clarín_corpus), which can provide an idea of the use of the Spanish 
language in a particular historical and cultural context. Our intention has been to identify adjectives and 
to do a global reading of them within the corpus. Our focus was mainly placed on the adjective de-
saparecido “disappeared,” because of its ideological importance. As we have already stated in the In-
troduction, our subject matter deals with the pedagogical application of NooJ in the teaching-learning 
of Spanish as a foreign language. And we have concentrated on a specific group: native speakers of 
Italian learning Spanish as a foreign language. Our strategy has been to make explicit some contact 
points between Spanish and Italian by using NooJ as a common platform. Our purpose was not to com-
pare the Italian and Spanish resources, but to highlight that both languages can be formalised using a 
common platform, since the structure of dictionaries and grammars is the same. This provides unity and 
coherence to our pedagogical proposal, which is the goal of the research project carried out by the 
IES_UNR team, since both languages can be analysed with NooJ (Appendix B).

B. A pedagogical proposal. 

Our work will be carried out in parallel to the NooJ Italian module, since the starting point is the same 
platform and our proposal includes the activities detailed below. 

• Open the text in the Italian Module: Ringraziamenti (Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code, 2003)8. 

• Apply Locate <A> in order to extract all adjectes, as stated in the properties_definiton file (Figure 
8):  

 

Figure 8. Locate <A> in the Italian text. 

• Apply Locate and search a string of characters for the adjective buon “good.” Note how concord-
ance is done.  Figure 9 presents a sample of some of the sequences.

• Identify the inflectional features of some of the nouns following the previous adjective: e.g., il 
buon nome “the good name,” un buon amico “a good friend,” etc. 

• Return to the Spanish Module Argentina, and perform Linguistic Analysis on the following se-
quence: un hombre bueno “a good man” (Figure 10). 

 

Figure 10. Linguistic Analysis of an adjectival sequence 

• Detect concordance features in the sequence: masculine (masc) and singular (sg). 

• State which variations this adjective may adopt, since according to the corresponding lexical 
grammar, bueno “good” inflects like FLACO (FLACO = <E>/masc+sg | s/masc+pl | <B> 
a/fem+sg | <B> as/fem+pl;). 

• Look up, in the dictionary of adjectives, another adjective inflecting like desaparecido and com-
plete the following expressions: 

Un  hombre… .. “A man…” 

Unos  hombres… .. “Some men…” 

Mi libro… ..”My book…” 

La  señora… .. “The lady…” 

• Check through Linguistic Analysis how it is possible, by virtue of concordance, to build noun 
phrases. 

• Do an online search to complete the analysis with its historical implications of the term desapare-
cido in expressions such desaparecidos Argentina and disappeared Argentina9.
