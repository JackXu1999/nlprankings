Abstract

One challenge for dialogue agents is recog-
nizing feelings in the conversation partner and
replying accordingly, a key communicative
skill. While it is straightforward for humans
to recognize and acknowledge others‚Äô feelings
in a conversation, this is a significant chal-
lenge for AI systems due to the paucity of
suitable publicly-available datasets for train-
ing and evaluation. This work proposes a new
benchmark for empathetic dialogue genera-
tion and EMPATHETICDIALOGUES, a novel
dataset of 25k conversations grounded in emo-
tional situations. Our experiments indicate
that dialogue models that use our dataset
are perceived to be more empathetic by hu-
man evaluators, compared to models merely
trained on large-scale Internet conversation
data. We also present empirical compar-
isons of dialogue model adaptations for em-
pathetic responding, leveraging existing mod-
els or datasets without requiring lengthy re-
training of the full model.

1 Introduction

A desirable trait in a human-facing dialogue
agent is to appropriately respond to a conversa-
tion partner that is describing personal experi-
ences, by understanding and acknowledging any
implied feelings ‚Äî a skill we refer to as em-
pathetic responding. For instance, while the
crossed-out response in Figure 1 is topically rel-
evant, ‚ÄúCongrats! That‚Äôs great!‚Äù may be more
satisfying because it acknowledges the underly-
ing feelings of accomplishment in an empathetic
way. In this work, we investigate empathetic
response generation from current dialogue sys-
tems, and propose experiments using a new re-
source, EMPATHETICDIALOGUES, as a bench-
mark to evaluate this skill set.

Empathetic responding is clearly relevant to
dialogue systems that are geared towards gen-
eral conversation or chit-chat. Indeed, ordinary
communication is frequently prompted by peo-
ple sharing their feelings or circumstances. But
researchers analyzing goal-directed conversations
have also observed the frequent intrusion of or-
dinary conversation in those interactions as well,
either as a ‚Äúwarm-up‚Äù introduction or as a de-
tour (Levinson et al., 2000; Heritage, 2005). En-
gaging in social talk, reacting to emotional cues
and displaying a caring attitude have, in fact,
been associated with better task outcomes in many
domains (Wentzel, 1997; Levinson et al., 2000;
Bickmore and Cassell, 2001; Kim et al., 2004;
Fraser et al., 2018). While many of those stud-
ies deal with human-human interactions, humans
have been shown to often interact with machines
in a natural and social way (Reeves and Nass,
1996; Lee et al., 2010), so it is reasonable to ex-
pect that dialogue agents would also benefit from
empathetic responding.

Most recent powerful language architectures are
trained on vast amounts of barely curated text
scrapes, social media conversations, or indepen-
dent books (Ritter et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018;
Mazare et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al.,
2019; Radford et al., 2019). It might be the case

their story in a conversation with a second worker (the listener).

that models trained on this type of data could ex-
hibit some of the aggressive and callous responses
that have been observed in spontaneous internet
conversations (Anderson, 2015). Unfortunately,
while chitchat dialogue benchmarks have been
proposed (e.g., Dinan et al., 2019), to the best
of our knowledge there are currently no bench-
marks gauging whether dialogue agents can con-
verse with empathy.

This work aims to facilitate evaluating models‚Äô
ability to produce empathetic responses. We intro-
duce a new task for dialogue systems to respond
to people discussing situations that cover a wide
range of emotions, and EMPATHETICDIALOGUES
(ED), a novel dataset with about 25k personal di-
alogues. Each dialogue is grounded in a specific
situation where a speaker was feeling a given emo-
tion, with a listener responding (Figure 2). The
new resource consists of crowdsourced one-on-
one conversations, and covers a large set of emo-
tions in a balanced way. This dataset is larger and
contains a more extensive set of emotions than
many similar emotion prediction datasets from
other text domains such as Scherer and Wallbott
(1994), Strapparava and Mihalcea (2007), Mo-
hammad et al. (2018), and Gupta et al. (2017).

Our experiments show that large-capacity con-
versation models trained on spontaneous internet
conversation data are not rated as very empathetic.
We propose two simple ways to leverage our
dataset to improve those models: use utterances
from our training data as candidate responses in a
retrieval model at inference time, and fine-tune the
model on our task. Finally, we explore whether
different ways of combining information from re-
lated tasks can lead to more empathetic responses.
The contributions of this work are thus: 1) we
release a novel empathetic dialogue dataset as a

new benchmark; 2) we show that training over this
dataset can improve the performance of an end-to-
end dialogue system on empathetic dialogue.

Emotion data Crafting our dataset requires de-
ciding what set of emotions the models should be
capable of reacting to. Multiple schemas have
attempted to organize the spectrum of emotions,
from a handful of basic emotions derived from bi-
ological responses (Ekman, 1992; Plutchik, 1984)
to larger sets of subtle emotions inferred from
contextual situations (Skerry and Saxe, 2015).
We incorporate emotions from multiple annota-
tion schemas, noting that emotions merely in-
ferred from a situation are important in dialogue
scenarios. There is a wide breadth of research in
distributional representation approaches for many
emotion classification tasks (Duppada et al., 2018;
Park et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Mohammad
et al., 2018) that build on deep networks pretrained
on large-scale weakly-labelled data such as emo-
jis (Felbo et al., 2017) or hashtags (Mohammad,
2012), gathered from public social media content
published on Twitter. The SEMEVAL2019 Emo-
Context challenge also uses conversation data for
detection of three basic emotions (‚Äòhappy‚Äô, ‚Äòsad‚Äô,
and ‚Äòangry‚Äô) over two turns of context from Twit-
ter exchanges (Gupta et al., 2017). We focus
on personal conversations rather than using social
media data to be closer to a context of a one-on-
one conversation. Public social media content oc-
curs in front of large ‚Äúperipheral audiences‚Äù (Goff-
man, 1981) where uncertainty as to how wide
that audience is and the need for curated self-
presentation (Goffman, 1959) have been shown to
lead to different choices of subject matters com-
pared to private messaging, with people sharing

more intense and negative emotions through pri-
vate channels (Bazarova et al., 2015; Litt et al.,
2014). In this work, we generate a more balanced
coverage of emotions than would appear in public
social media content, using a domain that is closer
to our ultimate goal of training a model for con-
versation that can respond to any emotion.

Controllable language generation Several
other works have focused on controlling the emo-
tional content of a text response either through
a manually specified target (Zhou and Wang,
2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Wang and Wan, 2018;
Hu et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018) or through a
general term to encourage higher levels of affect
(Asghar et al., 2018), with evaluations focused
on matching a predetermined desired emotion
rather than empathetic responding. Niu and
Bansal (2018) generate responses conditioned
on a specified politeness setting (polite, rude or
neutral). Huber et al. (2018) investigate how to
respond to emotions detected from an image. Our
work focuses on empathetic responses that are
appropriate to signals inferred purely from text
rather than conveying a pre-specified emotion.

Related chit-chat data Several works have at-
tempted to make chit-chat dialogue models more
engaging by grounding them in personal contexts
(Li et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2018; Mazare et al.,
2018), focusing on personal facts (‚ÄúI am from New
York‚Äù). Another interesting resource is the DAI-
LYDIALOG (DD) dataset (Li et al., 2017), which
comprises about 13k dialogues obtained by crawl-
ing educational websites intended for learners of
English and also has emotion label annotations.
Many of the dialogues are focused on topics for
ESL learners (ordering from a restaurant, asking
for directions, introductions, etc), but only ‚âà 5%
of the utterances have a label other than ‚Äúnone‚Äù or
‚Äúhappy‚Äù. Our task focuses explicitly on conversa-
tions about emotionally grounded personal situa-
tions, and considers a richer, evenly distributed set
of emotions. We also introduce an explicit single
listener in the conversation who is reacting to the
situation being described in an empathetic way, to
make the setting as close as possible to our desired
goal of a one-on-one empathetic conversation.

situation that happened to one of them, related to
a given feeling. We collect around 25k conversa-
tions using the following format.

Emotional situation grounding Each conversa-
tion is grounded in a situation, which one par-
ticipant writes about in association with a given
emotion label. We consider 32 emotion labels,
listed in Figure 3, which we chose by aggregat-
ing labels from several emotion prediction datasets
(Scherer and Wallbott, 1994; Strapparava and Mi-
halcea, 2007; Skerry and Saxe, 2015; Li et al.,
2017; Mohammad, 2012). These emotion labels
cover a broad range of positive and negative emo-
tions. Our goal in providing a single emotion la-
bel is to have a situation strongly related to (at
least) one particular emotional experience, though
we note that some emotions may be very closely
related1 and additional related emotions may be
invoked in a given conversation.

Speaker and listener The person who wrote the
situation description (Speaker) initiates a conver-

and ‚Äùterrified‚Äù, to get coarser labels, if desired.

sation to talk about it. The other conversation par-
ticipant (Listener) becomes aware of the underly-
ing situation through what the Speaker says and
responds. Speaker and Listener then exchange up
to 6 more turns. We include two example con-
versations from the training data in Figure 2 and
ten more in Table 5 in the Appendix. The models
discussed below are tested in the role of Listener
responding to the Speaker. Neither the situation
description written by the Speaker nor the emotion
label is given to the models (just as they were not
given to the Listener during dialogue collection).
Our data could also be used to generate conversa-
tions for the Speaker conditioned on the situation
description though we leave this for future work.

Collection details We collected crowdsourced
dialogues using the ParlAI platform (Miller et al.,
2017) to interact with Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk), hiring 810 US workers. A pair of work-
ers are asked to (i) select an emotion word each
and describe a situation when they felt that way,
and to (ii) have a conversation about each of the
situations, as outlined below. Each worker had
to contribute at least one situation description and
one pair of conversations: one as Speaker about
the situation they contributed, and one as Listener
about the situation contributed by another worker.
They were allowed to participate in as many hits as
they wanted for the first ‚àº10k conversations, then
we limited the more ‚Äúfrequently active‚Äù workers
to a maximum of 100 conversations. The median
number of conversations per worker was 8, while
the average was 61 (some workers were more ac-
tive contributors than others). To ensure quality,
we manually checked random subsets of conver-
sations by our most-frequent workers.

Task set-up In the first stage of the task, work-
ers are asked to describe in a few sentences a situ-
ation based on a feeling label. We ask the workers
to try to keep these descriptions between 1-3 sen-
tences. The average response is 19.8 words. In the
second stage, two workers are paired and asked
to have two short chats with each other. In each
chat, one worker (speaker) starts a conversation
about the situation they previously described, and
the other worker (listener) responds. Neither can
see what the other worker was given as emotion
label or the situation description they submitted,
so they must respond to each others‚Äô stories based
solely on cues within the conversation. Each con-

versation is allowed to be 4-8 utterances long (the
average is 4.31 utterances per conversation). The
average utterance length was 15.2 words long.

Ensuring balanced emotion coverage After
the first few initial rounds of data collection, we
forced workers to select an emotion that among
three emotion labels that had been the least cho-
sen overall so far if it was their first time work-
ing on the task. If they had already performed the
task, the offered emotion labels were among those
that they had chosen the least often before. Given
that a conversation model trained for empathetic
responding needs to be able to handle emotions
even if they are less frequent, we opted for this
balancing procedure to make training for these cat-
egories easier, while still allowing for some mea-
sure of choice for workers. As shown in Figure 3,
the distribution of emotion label prompts is close
to evenly distributed, with a few that are selected
slightly more/less often.

EMPATHETICDIALOGUES dataset statistics
The resulting dataset comprises 24,850 conversa-
tions about a situation description, gathered from
810 different participants, which are publicly
available through the ParlAI framework2. We
split the conversations into approximately 80%
train, 10% validation, and 10% test partitions. To
prevent overlap of discussed situations between
partitions, we split the data so that all sets of
conversations with the same speaker providing
the initial situation description would be in the
same partition. The final train/val/test split was
19533 / 2770 / 2547 conversations, respectively.
We include ten examples from our training set in
Appendix Section A.

4 Empathetic Response Generation

This section shows how ED can be used as a
benchmark to gauge the ability of a model to re-
spond in an empathetic way, and as a training re-
source to make generic chitchat models more em-
pathetic. We also examine different ways existing
models can be combined to produce more empa-
thetic responses. We use ED dialogues to train
and evaluate models in the task of generating con-
versation responses in the Listener role. To emu-
late a normal conversation, the model has access
to previous utterances in the dialogue, but not to
the emotion word prompt (e.g., ‚Äúproud‚Äù), nor to

Given a dialogue context x of n previous con-
versation utterances concatenated and tokenized
as x1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , xm, followed by a target response yÃÑ,
our models are trained to maximize the likelihood
p(yÃÑ|x) of producing the target response. We inves-
tigate both generative and retrieval-based settings
(Lowe et al., 2016) as described in Figure 4.

4.1 Base Architecture
We base our models on Transformer networks
(Vaswani et al., 2017), which have proven success-
ful in machine translation and dialogue generation
tasks (Zhang et al., 2018; Mazare et al., 2018).

Retrieval-based In the retrieval-based set-up,
the model is given a large set Y of candidate re-
sponses and picks the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one, y‚àó. We first
experiment with the retrieval Transformer-based
architecture from Yang et al. (2018): two Trans-
former encoders separately embedding the con-
text, x, and candidates, y ‚àà Y , as hx and hy,
respectively. We also experiment with BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2018) as base architecture to encode
candidates and contexts, using the final hidden
vector from BERT as the hx or hy encodings. The
model chooses a candidate utterance according to
a softmax on the dot product: hx¬∑hy. We minimize
the negative log-likelihood of selecting the correct
candidate. At training time, we use all of the ut-
terances from the batch as candidates, with a large

batch size of 512 to give the model more negative
examples (except for BERT for which a batch size
of 256 was used). At inference time, we exper-
iment with three sets of candidate utterances for
the model to choose from: all of the response ut-
terances in the ED training set (Y ED), all the utter-
ances in the DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017) training
set (Y DD), and a million utterances from a dump
of 1.7 billion Reddit (R) conversations (Y R).

Generative In the generative set-up, we use
the full Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al.,
2017), consisting of an encoder and a decoder.
The Transformer decoder uses the encoder output
to predict a sequence of words y, and is trained
to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the tar-
get sequence yÃÑ. At inference time, we use diverse
beam search from Vijayakumar et al. (2016).

Training details Models are pretrained on pre-
dicting replies from a dump of 1.7 billion Reddit
conversations, starting either from scratch for the
Transformer architectures, or from the BERTbase
model released by Devlin et al. (2018) for the
BERT-based architectures.3 Pretrained models
without any fine-tuning on ED will be referred
to as ‚ÄúPretrained‚Äù hereafter. We limit the maxi-
mum number of word tokens in the context and re-
sponse to be 100 each. The Transformer networks
used in most experiments have the same base ar-
chitecture (four layers and six transformer heads)
and are trained the same way as in Mazare et al.
(2018). We also experiment with a larger architec-
ture of five layers (denoted as ‚ÄùLarge‚Äù), and BERT
retrieval models, that are allowed to train for much
longer (see training times in Table 3).4 For all
models, we keep the version that has the lowest
loss on the validation set. We use 300-d word em-
beddings pretrained on common-crawl data using
fastText (Grave et al., 2018). More training details
are provided in Appendix D.1.

4.2 Leveraging the Training Data from ED

A retrieval-based model relies on candidates. ED
data was explicitly collected with instructions to
be empathetic, in a one-on-one setting, which is

3We experimented with directly fine-tuning BERT on ED
without first training on Reddit conversations, but this did not
perform as well.

4While the models had not fully converged when we
stopped training, we trained the Pretrained models for a few
iterations more than the corresponding Fine-Tuned models,
to ensure that any observed improvement was due to the data
used for fine-tuning and not the extra training time.

not the case of the Reddit conversation data used
for pretraining, and these domain candidates may
be better suited to empathetic responding than
generic conversation utterances. Thus, we exper-
iment with incorporating ED training candidates
into the pool used at inference time by pretrained
retrieval-based models, with no fine-tuning on ED.
For retrieval-based and generative models, we also
experiment with fine-tuning pretrained models to
predict the next utterance over ED with a con-
text window of four previous utterances, which
is the average length of a conversation in our
dataset. These models are referred to as ‚ÄúFine-
Tuned‚Äù models. This fine-tuning is conducted un-
til convergence for all architectures except those
referred to as ‚ÄúPretrained‚Äù.

4.3 Adding Information from External
Predictors

Many existing models have been pretrained on su-
pervised tasks that may be relevant to empathetic
responding. Combining these models with the rep-
resentations from our base architecture may reap
benefits from previous training time and external
training data without having to redo the work or
requiring access to that data, which may matter to
practitioners. Note that this may considerably aug-
ment the effective capacity of the resulting mod-
els, as well as the total amount of training data
used overall, but our goal here is to get an empiri-
cal sense of how robust performance improvement
is to variations in architecture set-up or supervi-
sion domain. We experiment with adding super-

vised information from two prediction tasks: emo-
tion detection, which is more closely relevant to
our task, and topic detection, which may also be
useful in crafting relevant replies.5

Prepending Top-k Predicted Labels This set-
up (Fig. 5), PREPEND-1, is a very simple way
to add supervised information to data, requires no
architecture modification, and can be used with
black-box classifiers. The top predicted label6

from the supervised classifier is merely prepended
to the beginning of the token sequence as encoder
input, as below:

Original:‚ÄúI finally got promoted!‚Äù
Prepend-1:‚Äúproud I finally got promoted!‚Äù

Similar methods have been used for controlling
the style of generated text (e.g. Niu and Bansal,
2018). Here, we use a fastText model (Joulin et al.,
2017) as prediction architecture. Both the context
and the candidates are run through the classifier
and receive prepended labels. Fine-tuning is con-
ducted similarly as before, but using these modi-
fied inputs. We use two external sources of infor-
mation. To provide emotion signal, we train a clas-
sifier to predict the emotion label from the descrip-
tion of the situation written by the Speaker before
the dialogue for the training set dialogues of ED
(EMOPREPEND-1).7 To gauge whether supervi-
sion from a more distant task would still be help-
ful, we also experiment with a classifier trained on
the 20-Newsgroup dataset (Joachims, 1996), for
topic classification (TOPICPREPEND-1).

5 Experimental Evaluation

We evaluate the models on their ability to repro-
duce the Listener‚Äôs portion of the conversation (i.e.
the ability to react to someone else‚Äôs story). We
use both automated metrics and human evaluation
to score each model‚Äôs retrievals/generations. Hu-
man evaluation is important, as automated metrics
don‚Äôt always correlate with human judgments of
dialogue quality (Liu et al., 2016), but we provide
automated metrics to give a sense of how well they
align with human judgment on this task.

5We considered multitask or feature concatenation set-
ups, but they did not provide consistent improvements. These
experiments are included in Appendix D.2.

6We only discuss prepending the top predicted label here,
but also experimented with top-3 and top-5 models, with sim-
ilar result patterns, shown in Appendix D.3.

7We also experimented with training the classifier on the
utterances themselves, with similar results.

Table 1: Automatic evaluation metrics on the test set. Pretrained: model pretrained on a dump of 1.7 billion RED-
DIT conversations (4-layer Transformer architecture, except when specified BERT). Fine-Tuned: model fine-tuned
over the EMPATHETICDIALOGUES training data (Sec. 4.2). EmoPrepend-1, Topic-Prepend1: model incorporating
supervised information from an external classifiers, as described in Sec. 4.3. Candidates come from REDDIT (R),
EMPATHETICDIALOGUES (ED), or DAILYDIALOG (DD). P@1,100: precision retrieving the correct test candi-
date out of 100 test candidates. AVG BLEU: average of BLEU-1,-2,-3,-4. PPL: perplexity. All automatic metrics
clearly improve with in-domain training on utterances (Fine-Tuned vs. Pretrained), other metrics are inconsistent.
Bold: best performance for that architecture.

Automated metrics (Table 1) For both retrieval
and generative systems, we compute BLEU scores
(Papineni et al., 2002) for the model response,
comparing against the gold label (the actual re-
sponse), following the practice of earlier work in
dialogue generation (Wen et al., 2015; Li et al.,
2016a,b). For the generative systems, we addition-
ally report perplexity of the actual gold response.
For the retrieval-based systems, we further com-
pute p@1,100, the accuracy of the model at
choosing the correct response out of a hundred
randomly selected examples in the test set. When
we compute p@1,100, the actual response is in-
cluded in the candidates, unlike inference from the
retrieval systems for all other metrics, which only
uses training utterances as candidates.

Human ratings (Table 2) We ran crowd-
sourcing tasks on MTurk (further details in
Appendix B). Participants were given a model‚Äôs
output for a randomly selected test set example
and asked to score different aspects of the model.
The rating task provides a means of comparing as-
pects of responses, and we ask raters specifically
about whether the response is acknowledging the
conversation partner‚Äôs feelings. We collected at
least 100 ratings per model and asked about three
aspects of performance, all rated on a Likert scale
(1: not at all, 3: somewhat, 5: very much):

Empathy/Sympathy: did the responses show
understanding of the feelings of the person talking

about their experience?
Relevance: did the responses seem appropriate

to the conversation? Were they on-topic?
Fluency: could you understand the responses?

Did the language seem accurate?

5.1 Results

Pretrained models baseline Pretrained conver-
sation models are rated poorly by humans for em-
pathy when the candidates are retrieved from Red-
dit utterances or when a generative model is used
(Table 2). Higher ratings with models based on
BERT or larger Transformer models show that in-
creasing the capacity makes the models seem more
empathetic, but still remain far from human per-
formance, while being considerably more onerous
to train (Table 3).8

Using EMPATHETICDIALOGUES for candidate
selection Table 1 shows that merely using the
pool of candidates from the training set of ED im-
proves the BLEU scores of retrieval models. Us-
ing candidates from our dataset also substantially
improves the performance of pre-trained retrieval
models on all human metrics, particularly the Em-
pathy subscore of most interest to us (Table 2).

8Results on larger retrieval-based Transformer models in
Table 9 of the Appendix show the same pattern.

Table 2: Human ratings. Fine-tuning on ED and using ED candidates generally improves scores, especially on Em-
pathy, with minimal retraining. Additional external supervision (Prepend) improves the Empathy and Relevance
scores for BERT-based models. Bold: best score for that group. Italics: reference model for the group.

Using EMPATHETICDIALOGUES for fine-
tuning Additionally, fine-tuning to predict
conversation responses on our data improves all
automated metrics (Table 1). While fine-tuning on
ED data improves performance on predicting the
next ED utterance, this may come at the expense
of performance when predicting next utterance in
other corpora. To measure this, we compared au-
tomated metrics on next utterance prediction with
pre-trained models and models fine-tuned using
ED data (for our base and larger retrieval-based
Transformer models) when predicting on DAILY-
DIALOG and REDDIT (drawing both context and
candidates from the same corpus). Compared to
the 12-14% P@1,100 increase measured with ED
(see Tables 1 and 7), fine-tuning on ED leads to
a 5-7% increase on DD, and a 2-3% decrease on
R.9 For all three datasets, fine-tuning increases
AVG BLEU by 0.2 to 0.5. The slight decrease
of performance on R is not surprising because
the pre-trained model was trained directly on
Reddit predictions. But, the improvement on
DD is an encouraging sign that improvements
from fine-tuning on ED may generalize to other
conversation datasets. Fine-tuning on the ED data

9Numbers for these datasets are included in Table 6 of the
appendix.

also generally improves human metrics on the
ED task, in both retrieval and generative set-ups
(Table 2).

Augmenting conversation models with exter-
nal pretrained classifiers Automated and hu-
man evaluations suggest that prepending emo-
tion or topic predictions may boost perfomance
of high-capacity models based on BERT (but not
the smaller models), with Empathy ratings close
to approaching human performance. More exten-
sive experiments with large models would be re-
quired to confirm that larger capacity makes addi-
tional external supervision effective for this task.

Resources and capacity Table 3 quantifies re-
source and parameter usage for several models
and set-ups, including a larger Transformer gen-
erative model (5 layers instead of 4) and BERT-
based architectures with substantially more pa-
rameters that require longer training. Using ED
candidates in pretrained retrieval models, or fine-
tuning pretrained conversation models on ED data
makes smaller models perform better than larger
ones with minimal increase in resource usage.

6 Conclusion

We introduce a new dataset of 25k dialogues
grounded in situations prompted by specific emo-
tion labels. Our experiments show that using this
dataset to provide retrieval candidates or fine-tune
conversation models leads to responses that are
evaluated as more empathetic. Future work will
investigate how to integrate empathetic respond-
ing into more general dialogue when, for exam-
ple, the needs for empathy have to be balanced
with staying on topic or providing information.
We hope that our results and dataset will stimulate
more research in the important direction of mak-
ing dialog systems more empathetic.
