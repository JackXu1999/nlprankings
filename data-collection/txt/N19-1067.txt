Abstract

The development of a fictional plot is cen-
tered around characters who closely interact
with each other forming dynamic social net-
works. In literature analysis, such networks
have mostly been analyzed without particular
relation types or focusing on roles which the
characters take with respect to each other. We
argue that an important aspect for the analysis
of stories and their development is the emo-
tion between characters. In this paper, we
combine these aspects into a unified frame-
work to classify emotional relationships of fic-
tional characters. We formalize it as a new task
and describe the annotation of a corpus, based
on fan-fiction short stories. The extraction
pipeline which we propose consists of char-
acter identification (which we treat as given
by an oracle here) and the relation classifica-
tion. For the latter, we provide results using
several approaches previously proposed for re-
lation identification with neural methods. The
best result of 0.45 F1 is achieved with a GRU
with character position indicators on the task
of predicting undirected emotion relations in
the associated social network graph.

1 Introduction

Every fictional story is centered around charac-
ters in conflict (Ingermanson and Economy, 2009)
which interact, grow closer or apart, as each of
them has ambitions and concrete goals (Acker-
man and Puglisi, 2012, p. 9). Previous work
on computational literary studies includes two
tasks, namely social network analysis and sen-
timent/emotion analysis, both contributing to a
computational understanding of narrative struc-
tures. We argue that joining these two tasks lever-
ages simplifications that each approach makes
when considered independently. We are not aware
of any such attempt and therefore propose the task
of emotional character network extraction from

fictional texts, in which, given a text, a network is
to be generated, whose nodes correspond to char-
acters and edges to emotions between characters.
One of the characters is part of a trigger/cause for
the emotion experienced by the other. Figure 1 de-
picts two examples for emotional character inter-
actions at the text level. Such relation extraction
is the basis for generating social networks of emo-
tional interactions.

Dynamic social networks of characters are ana-
lyzed in previous work with different goals, e.g., to
test the differences in interactions between various
adaptations of a book (Agarwal et al., 2013); to
understand the correlation between dialogue and
setting (Elson et al., 2010); to test whether social
networks derived from Shakespeare’s plays can be
explained by a general sociological model (Nal-
isnick and Baird, 2013); in the task of narrative
generation (Sack, 2013); to better understand the
nature of character interactions (Piper et al., 2017).
Further, previous work analyses personality traits
of characters (mostly) independently of each other
(Massey et al., 2015; Barth et al., 2018; Bamman
et al., 2014).

Emotion analysis in literature has focused on
the development of emotions over time, abstract-
ing away who experiences an emotion (Reagan
et al., 2016; Elsner, 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Piper
and Jean So, 2015, i.a.). Fewer works have ad-

dressed the annotation of emotion causes, e.g.,
Neviarouskaya and Aono (2013), Ghazi et al.
(2015), Saurı́ and Pustejovsky (2009), and Kim
and Klinger (2018). To the best of our knowl-
edge, there is no previous research that deals with
emotional relationships of literary characters. The
works that are conceptually the closest to our pa-
per are Chaturvedi et al. (2017) and Massey et al.
(2015), who use a more general set of relationship
categories.

Most approaches to emotion classification from
text build on the classes proposed by Plutchik
(2001) and Ekman (1992). Here, we use a dis-
crete emotion categorization scheme based on fun-
damental emotions as proposed by Plutchik. This
model has previously been used in computational
analysis of literature (Mohammad, 2012, i.a.). We
refer the reader to social psychology literature
for more details on the emotional relationship be-
tween people (Burkitt, 1997; Gaelick et al., 1985).

The main contributions of this paper are (1) to
propose the new task of emotional relationship
classification of fictional characters, (2) to pro-
vide a fan-fiction short story corpus annotated with
characters and their emotional relationships, and
(3) to provide results for relation extraction mod-
els for the task. We evaluate our models on the tex-
tual and the social network graph level and show
that a neural model with positional indicators for
character roles performs the best. An additional
analysis shows that the task of character relation-
ship detection leads to higher performance scores
for polarity detection than for more fine-grained
emotion classes. Differences between models are
minimal when the task is cast as a polarity classi-
fication but are striking for emotion classification.

This work has potential to support a literary
scholar in analyzing differences and commonali-
ties across texts. As an example, one may consider
Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther (Goethe,
1774), a book that gave rise to a plethora of im-
itations by other writers, who attempted to de-
pict a similar love triangle between main charac-
ters found in the original book. The results of
our study can potentially be used to compare the
derivative works with the original (see also Barth
et al., 2018).

2 Corpus

Data Collection and Annotation. Each
emotion relation is characterized by a triple

(Cexp, e, Ccause), in which the character Cexp
feels the emotion e (mentioned in text explicitly
or implicitly). The character Ccause is part
of an event which triggers the emotion e. We
consider the eight fundamental emotions defined
by Plutchik (2001) (anger, fear, joy, anticipation,
trust, surprise, disgust, sadness). Each character
corresponds to a token sequence for the relation
extraction task and to a normalized entity in the
graph depiction.

Using WebAnno (Yimam et al., 2013), we an-
notate a sample of 19 complete English fan-fiction
short stories, retrieved from the Archive of Our
Own project1 (due to availability, the legal possi-
bility to process the texts and a modern language),
and a single short story by Joyce (1914) (Counter-
parts) being an exception from this genre in our
corpus. All fan-fiction stories were marked by
the respective author as complete, are shorter than
1500 words, and depict at least four different char-
acters. They are tagged with the keywords “emo-
tion” and “relationships”.

The annotators were instructed to mark every
character mention with a canonical name and to
decide if there is an emotional relationship be-
tween the character and another character. If so,
they marked the corresponding emotion phrase
with the emotion labels (as well as indicating if
the emotion is amplified, downtoned or negated).
Based on this phrase annotation, they marked two
relations: from the emotion phrase to the experi-
encing character and from the emotion phrase to
the causing character (if available, i.e., Ccause can
be empty). One character may be described as ex-
periencing multiple emotions.

We generate a “consensus” annotation by keep-
ing all emotion labels by all annotators. This is
motivated by the finding by Schuff et al. (2017)
that such high-recall aggregation is better mod-
elled in an emotion prediction task. The data is
available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/
relationalemotions.

Inter-Annotator Agreement We calculate the
agreement along two dimensions, namely unla-
belled vs. labeled and instance vs. graph-level. Ta-
ble 1 reports the pairwise results for three annota-
tors. In the Inst. labelled setting, we accept an in-
stance being labeled as true positive if both anno-
tators marked the same characters as experiencer
and cause of an emotion and classified their in-

teraction with the same emotion. In the Inst. un-
labelled case, the emotion label is allowed to be
different. On the graph level (Graph labelled and
Graph unlabelled), the evaluation is performed on
an aggregated graph of interacting characters, i.e.,
a relation is accepted by one annotator if the other
annotator marked the same interaction somewhere
in the text. We use the F1 score to be able to mea-
sure the agreement between two annotators on the
span levels. For that, we treat the annotations from
one annotator in the pair as correct and the anno-
tations from the other as predicted.

As Table 1 shows, agreement on the textual
level is the lowest with values between 19 and
33 % (depending on the annotator pair), which
also motivated our aggregation strategy mentioned
before. The values for graph-labelled agreement
are more relevant for our use-case of network gen-
eration. The values are higher (66–93 %), show-
ing that annotators agree when it comes to detect-
ing relationships regardless of where exactly in the
text they appear.

Statistics. Table 2 summarizes the aggregated
results of the annotation. The column “All” lists
the number of experiencer annotations (with an
emotion), the column “Rel.” refers to the counts
of emotion annotations with both experiencer and
cause.

Joy has the highest number of annotated in-
stances and the highest number of relationship in-
stances (413 and 308 respectively). In contrast,
sadness has the lowest number of annotations with
a total count of instances and relations being 97
and 64 respectively. Overall, we obtain 1335 an-
notated instances, which we use to build and test
our models.

undirected relation prediction. In the directed sce-
nario, we classify which character is the experi-
encer and which character is the cause, as well as
what is the emotion between two characters. For
the undirected scenario, we only classify the emo-
tion relation between two characters. We do not
tackle character name recognition here: our mod-
els build on top of gold character annotations.

The baseline model predicts the emotion for a
character pair based on the NRC dictionary (Mo-
hammad and Turney, 2013). It accepts the emo-
tion associated with the words occurring in a win-
dow of n tokens around the two characters, with
n being a parameter set based on results on a de-
velopment set for each model (see supplementary
material for more details).

Further we cast the relation detection as a ma-
chine learning-based classification task, in which
each classification instance consists of two char-
acter mentions with up to n tokens context to the

left and to the right of the character mentions. We
compare an extremely randomized tree classifier
with bag-of-words features (Geurts et al., 2006)
(BOW-RF) with a two-layer GRU neural network
(Chung et al., 2014) with max and averaged pool-
ing. In the latter, we use different variations of en-
coding the character positions with indicators (in-
spired by Zhou et al. (2016), who propose the use
of positional indicators for relation detection). Our
variations are exemplified in Table 3. Note that
the case of predicting directed relations is simpli-
fied in the “Role” and “MRole” cases in contrast
to “Entity” and “MEntity”, as the model has access
to gold information about the relation direction.

We obtain word vectors for the embedding layer
from GloVe (pre-trained on Common Crawl, d =
300, Pennington et al., 2014) and initialize out-
of-vocabulary terms with zeros (including the po-
sition indicators).

4 Experiments

Experimental Setting. In the classification ex-
periments, we compare the performance of our
models on different label sets. Namely, we com-
pare the complete emotion set with 8 classes to a
5 class scenario where we join anger and disgust,
trust and joy, as well as anticipation and surprise
(based on preliminary experiments and inspection
of confusion matrices). The 2-class scenario con-
sists of positive (anticipation, joy, trust, surprise)
and negative relations (anger, fear, sadness, dis-
gust). For each set of classes, we consider a setting
where directed relations are predicted with one
where the direction is ignored. Therefore, in the
directed prediction scenario, each emotion consti-
tutes two classes to be predicted for both possible
directions (therefore, 16, 10, and 4 labels exist).

The evaluation is performed with precision, re-
call and F1 in a cross-story validation setting,
in which each story is used as one separate
test/validation source. For model selection and
meta-parameter optimization, we use 50 % ran-
domly sampled annotations from this respective

test/validation instance as a validation set and the
remainder as test data.

Further, we evaluate on three different levels of
granularity: Given two character mentions, in the
instance-level evaluation, we only accept the pre-
diction to be correct if exactly the same mention
has the according emotion annotation. We then
aggregate the different true positive, false positive
and false negative values across all stories before
averaging to an aggregated score (similar to micro-
averaging). On the story-level, we also accept a
prediction to be a true positive the same way, but
first calculate the result P/R/F1 for the whole story
before averaging (similar to macro-averaging). On
the graph-level, we accept a prediction for a char-
acter pair to be correct without considering the ex-
act position.

Results. Table 4 shows the results (precision and
recall shown in supplementary material) on de-
velopment data and independent test data for the
best models. The GRU+MRole model achieves
the highest performance with improvement over
BOW-RF on the instance and story levels, and
shows a clear improvement over the GRU+NoInd.
model in the directed 8-class setting. GRU+Role
achieves the highest performance on the graph
level in the directed 8-class setting. In the undi-
rected prediction setting, all models perform bet-
ter in the 5-class experiment and 2-class experi-
ment than in 8-class experiment. This is not al-
ways the case for the directed prediction, where
some models perform better in 8-class experiment
(GRU+NoInd., GRU+Entity, BOW-RF).

We observe that the difference in F1 score be-
tween the baseline, bag-of-words model and our
GRU models in a 2-class experiment is marginal.
This may be an indicator that the binary represen-
tation harms the classification of emotional rela-
tions between characters, as they can be nuanced
and do not always perfectly map to either positive
and negative classes. On the other side, a more so-
phisticated classification approach is necessary to
capture these nuanced differences.

As expected, we observe a better performance
on a graph level for all models, with the highest
performance of 47 % F1 (GRU+MEntity), 63 %
F1 (GRU+MEntity), and 73 % F1 (GRU+MRole,
GRU+MEntity, GRU+NoInd.) in undirected 8-, 5-
, and 2-class experiments, respectively, on the de-
velopment set. In the directed scenario, the highest
performances are 41 % F1 (GRU+Role), 48 % F1
(GRU+MRole), and 65 % F1 (GRU+MRole).

The results show that the sequential and embed-
ding information captured by a GRU as well as
additional positional information are all relevant
for a substantial performance, at least on the fine-
grained emotion prediction task.

5 Conclusion & Future Work

In this paper, we formulated the new task of emo-
tional character network extraction from fictional
texts. We argued that joining social network analy-
sis of fiction with emotion analysis leverages sim-
plifications that each approach makes when con-
sidered independently. We presented a publicly
available corpus of fan-fiction short stories anno-
tated with character relations and proposed sev-
eral relation classification models. We showed that
a recurrent neural architecture with positional in-
dicators leads to the best results of relation clas-
sification. We also showed that differences be-
tween different machine learning models with bi-
nary mapping of emotion relation is almost lev-
eled. This may suggest that emotion relation clas-
sification is best modeled in a multi-class setting,
as emotional interactions of fictional characters
are nuanced and do not simply map to either a pos-
itive or a negative class.

For future work we propose to develop a real-
world application pipeline in which character pairs
are not given by an oracle, but rather extracted
from text automatically using named entity recog-
nition. To better understand the relation between
instance and graph levels, we propose to explore
the best strategy for edge labeling either by a ma-
jority vote or accepting the edges with the highest
confidence scores. Further, modeling the task in
an end-to-end learning setting from text to directly
predict the graph, in the spirit of multi-instance
learning, is one of the next steps. To that end,
we suggest obtaining more gold data with charac-
ter relations and optimize the pipeline towards the
best performance on additional data.
