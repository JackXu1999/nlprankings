Abstract

Modern statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems usually use a linear com-
bination of features to model the quality
of each translation hypothesis. The linear
combination assumes that all the features
are in a linear relationship and constrains
that each feature interacts with the rest fea-
tures in an linear manner, which might
limit the expressive power of the model
and lead to a under-fit model on the cur-
rent data. In this paper, we propose a non-
linear modeling for the quality of transla-
tion hypotheses based on neural networks,
which allows more complex interaction
between features. A learning framework is
presented for training the non-linear mod-
els. We also discuss possible heuristics
in designing the network structure which
may improve the non-linear learning per-
formance. Experimental results show that
with the basic features of a hierarchical
phrase-based machine translation system,
our method produce translations that are
better than a linear model.

1 Introduction

One of the core problems in the research of statis-
tical machine translation is the modeling of trans-
lation hypotheses. Each modeling method defines
a score of a target sentence e = e1e2...ei...eI ,
given a source sentence f = f1f2...fj ...fJ , where
each ei is the ith target word and fj is the jth
source word. The well-known modeling method
starts from the Source-Channel model (Brown et
al., 1993)(Equation 1). The scoring of e decom-
poses to the calculation of a translation model and
a language model.

Pr(e|f) = Pr(e)Pr(f |e)/Pr(f) (1)

The modeling method is extended to log-linear
models by Och and Ney (2002), as shown in Equa-
tion 2, where hm(e|f) is the mth feature function
and λm is the corresponding weight.

Pr(e|f) = pλM1 (e|f)

=
exp[

∑M
m=1 λmhm(e|f)]∑

e′ exp[
∑M

m=1 λmhm(e′|f)]
(2)

Because the normalization term in Equation 2 is
the same for all translation hypotheses of the same
source sentence, the score of each hypothesis, de-
noted by sL, is actually a linear combination of all
features, as shown in Equation 3.

sL(e) =
M∑

m=1

λmhm(e|f) (3)

The log-linear models are flexible to incorpo-
rate new features and show significant advantage
over the traditional source-channel models, thus
become the state-of-the-art modeling method and
are applied in various translation settings (Yamada
and Knight, 2001; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang,
2005; Liu et al., 2006).

It is worth noticing that log-linear models try to
separate good and bad translation hypotheses us-
ing a linear hyper-plane. However, complex inter-
actions between features make it difficult to lin-
early separate good translation hypotheses from
bad ones (Clark et al., 2014).

Taking common features in a typical phrase-
based (Koehn et al., 2003) or hierarchical phrase-
based (Chiang, 2005) machine translation system
as an example, the language model feature favors
shorter hypotheses; the word penalty feature en-
courages longer hypotheses. The phrase trans-
lation probability feature selects phrases that oc-
curs more frequently in the training corpus, which
sometimes is long with a lower translation proba-
bility, as in translating named entities or idioms;

825



sometimes is short but with a high translation
probability, as in translating verbs or pronouns.
These three features jointly decide the choice of
translations. Simply use the weighted sum of their
values may not be the best choice for modeling
translations. As a result, log-linear models may
under-fit the data. This under-fitting may prevents
the further improvement of translation quality.

In this paper, we propose a non-linear model-
ing of translation hypotheses based on neural net-
works. The traditional features of a machine trans-
lation system are used as the input to the net-
work. By feeding input features to nodes in a hid-
den layer, complex interactions among features are
modeled, resulting in much stronger expressive
power than traditional log-linear models. (Sec-
tion 3)

Employing a neural network for SMT model-
ing has two issues to be tackled. The first is-
sue is the parameter learning. Log-linear models
rely on minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och,
2003) to achieve best performance. When the
scoring function become non-linear, the intersec-
tion points of these non-linear functions could not
be effectively calculated and enumerated. Thus
MERT is no longer suitable for learning the pa-
rameters. To solve the problem, we present a
framework for effective training including several
criteria to transform the training problem into a bi-
nary classification task, a unified objective func-
tion and an iterative training algorithm. (Sec-
tion 4)

The second issue is the structure of neural net-
work. Single layer neural networks are equivalent
to linear models; two-layer networks with suffi-
cient nodes are capable of learning any continuous
function (Bishop, 1995). Adding more layers into
the network could model complex functions with
less nodes, but also brings the problem of van-
ishing gradient (Erhan et al., 2009). We adapt a
two-layer feed-forward neural network to keep the
training process efficient. We notice that one ma-
jor problem that prevents a neural network training
reaching a good solution is that there are too many
local minimums in the parameter space. Thus we
discuss how to constrain the learning of neural net-
works with our intuitions and observations of the
features. (Section 5)

Experiments are conducted to compare vari-
ous settings and verify the effectiveness of our
proposed learning framework. Experimental re-

sults show that our framework could achieve better
translation quality even with the same traditional
features as previous linear models. (Section 6)

2 Related work

Many research has been attempting to bring non-
linearity into the training of SMT. These efforts
could be roughly divided into the following three
categories.

The first line of research attempted to re-
interpret original features via feature transforma-
tion or additional learning. For example, Maskey
and Zhou (2012) use a deep belief network to
learn representations of the phrase translation and
lexical translation probability features. Clark et
al. (2014) used discretization to transform real-
valued dense features into a set of binary indica-
tor features. Lu et al. (2014) learned new fea-
tures using a semi-supervised deep auto encoder.
These work focus on the explicit representation
of the features and usually employ extra learning
procedure. Our proposed method only takes the
original features, with no transformation, as the
input. Feature transformation or combination are
performed implicitly during the training of the net-
work and integrated with the optimization of trans-
lation quality.

The second line of research attempted to use
non-linear models instead of log-linear models,
which is most similar in spirit with our work. Duh
and Kirchhoff (2008) used the boosting method
to combine several results of MERT and achieved
improvement in a re-ranking setting. Liu et
al. (2013) proposed an additive neural network
which employed a two-layer neural network for
embedding-based features. To avoid local min-
imum, they still rely on a pre-training and post-
training from MERT or PRO. Comparing to these
efforts, our proposed method takes a further step
that it is integrated with iterative training, instead
of re-ranking, and works without the help of any
pre-trained linear models.

The third line of research attempted to add
non-linear features/components into the log-linear
learning framework. Neural network based mod-
els are trained as language models (Vaswani et
al., 2013; Auli and Gao, 2014), translation mod-
els (Gao et al., 2014) or joint language and transla-
tion models (Auli et al., 2013; Devlin et al., 2014).
Liu et al. (2013) also introduced word embed-
ding for source and target sides of the translation

rules as local features. In this paper, we focus on
enhancing the expressive power of the modeling,
which is independent of the research of enhanc-
ing translation systems with new designed fea-
tures. We believe additional improvement could
be achieved by incorporating more features into
our framework.

3 Non-linear Translation

The non-linear modeling of translation hypothe-
ses could be used in both phrase-based system and
syntax-based systems. In this paper, we take the
hierarchical phrase based machine translation sys-
tem (Chiang, 2005) as an example and introduce
how we fit the non-linearity into the system.

3.1 Two-layer Neural Networks

We employ a two-layer neural network as the non-
linear model for scoring translation hypotheses.
The structure of a typical two-layer feed-forward
neural network includes an input layer, a hidden
layer, and a output layer (as shown in Figure 1).

We use the input layer to accept input features,
the hidden layer to combine different input fea-
tures, the output layer with only one node to out-
put the model score for each translation hypothesis
based on the value of hidden nodes. More specifi-
cally, the score of hypothesis e, denoted as sN , is
defined as:

sN (e) = σo(Mo·σh(Mh·hm1 (e|f)+bh)+bo) (4)

where M , b is the weight matrix, bias vector of
the neural nodes, respectively; σ is the activation
function, which is often set to non-linear functions
such as the tanh function or sigmoid function; sub-
script h and o indicates the parameters of hidden
layer and output layer, respectively.

3.2 Features
We use the standard features of a typical hier-
archical phrase based translation system(Chiang,
2005). Adding new features into the framework is
left as a future direction. The features as listed as
following:

• p(α|γ) and p(γ|α): conditional probability
of translating α as γ and translating α as γ,
where α and γ is the left and right hand side
of a initial phrase or hierarchical translation
rule, respectively;

• pw(α|γ) and pw(γ|α): lexical probability of
translating words in α as words in γ and
translating words in γ as words in α;

• plm: language model probability;
• wc: accumulated count of individual words

generated during translation;

• pc: accumulated count of initial phrases used;
• rc: accumulated count of hierarchical rule

phrases used;

• gc: accumulated count of glue rule used in
this hypothesis;

• uc: accumulated count of unknown source
word. which has no entry in the translation
table;

• nc: accumulated count of source phrases that
translate into null;

3.3 Decoding
The basic decoding algorithm could be kept al-
most the same as traditional phrase-based or
syntax-based translation systems (Yamada and
Knight, 2001; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005;
Liu et al., 2006). For example, in the experiments
of this paper, we use a CKY style decoding algo-
rithm following Chiang (2005).

Our non-linear translation system is different
from traditional systems in the way to calculate
the score for each hypothesis. Instead of calculat-
ing the score as a linear combination, we use neu-
ral networks (Section 3.1) to perform a non-linear
combination of feature values.

We also use the cube-pruning algorithm (Chi-
ang, 2005) to keep the decoding efficient. Al-
though the non-linearity in model scores may
cause more search errors (Huang and Chiang,

827



2007) finding the highest scoring hypothesis, in
practice it still achieves reasonable results.

4 Non-linear Learning Framework

Traditional machine translation systems rely on
MERT to tune the weights of different features.
MERT performs efficient search by enumerating
the score function of all the hypotheses and us-
ing intersections of these linear functions to form
the ”upper-envelope” of the model score func-
tion (Och, 2003). When the scoring function is
non-linear, it is not feasible to find the intersec-
tions of these functions. In this section, we discuss
alternatives to train the parameters for non-linear
models.

4.1 Training Criteria
The task of machine translation is a complex prob-
lem with structural output space. Decoding algo-
rithms search for the translation hypothesis with
the highest score, according to a given scoring
function, from an exponentially large set of candi-
date hypotheses. The purpose of training is to se-
lect the scoring function, so that the function score
the hypotheses ”correctly”. The correctness is of-
ten introduced by some extrinsic metrics, such as
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

We denote the scoring function as s(f , e; θ⃗), or
simply s, which is parameterized by θ⃗; denote the
set of all translation hypotheses as C; denote the
extrinsic metric as eval(·) 1. Note that, in linear
cases, s is a linear function as in Equation 3, while
in the non-linear case described in this paper, s is
the scoring function in Equation 4.

Ideally, the training objective is to select a scor-
ing function ŝ, from all functions S , that scores the
correct translation (or references) ê, higher than
any other hypotheses (Equation 5).

ŝ = {s ∈ S|s(ê) > s(e)∀e ∈ C} (5)

In practice, the candidate set C is exponentially
large and hard to enumerate; the correct translation
ê may not even exist in the current search space for
various reasons, e.g. unknown source word. As a
result, we use the n-best set Cnbest to approximate
C, use the extrinsic metric eval(·) to evaluate the
quality of hypotheses in Cnbest and use the fol-
lowing three alternatives as approximations to the
ideal objective.

1In our experiments, we use sentence level BLEU with +1
smoothing as the evaluation metric.

Best v.s. Rest (BR) To score the best hypothesis
in the n-best set ẽ higher than the rest hy-
potheses. This objective is very similar to
MERT in that it tries to optimize the score
of ẽ and doesn’t concern about the ranking of
rest hypotheses. In this case, ẽ is an approxi-
mation of ê.

Best v.s. Worst (BW) To score the best hypoth-
esis higher than the worst hypothesis in the
n-best set. This objective is motivated by the
practice of separating the ”hope” and ”fear”
translation hypotheses (Chiang, 2012). We
take a simpler strategy which uses the best
and worst hypothesis in Cnbest as the ”hope”
and ”fear” hypothesis, respectively, in order
to avoid multi-pass decoding.

Pairwise (PW) To score the better hypothesis in
sampled hypothesis pairs higher than the
worse one in the same pair. This objective
is adapted from the Pairwise Ranking Opti-
mization (PRO) (Hopkins and May, 2011),
which tries to ranking all the hypotheses in-
stead of selecting the best one. We use the
same sampling strategy as their original pa-
per.

Note that each of the above criteria transforms
the original problem of selecting best hypothe-
ses from an exponential space to a certain pair-
wise comparison problem, which could be easily
trained using binary classifiers.

4.2 Training Objective
For the binary classification task, we use a hinge
loss following Watanabe (2012). Because the net-
work has a lot of parameters compared with the
linear model, we use a L1 norm instead of L2
norm as the regularization term, to favor sparse so-
lutions. We define our training objective function
in Equation 6.

higher eval(·) score; N is the total number of
hypothesis-pairs in D; T (f), or simply T , is the
set of hypothesis-pairs for each source sentence f .

The set T is decided by the criterion used for
training. For the BR setting, the best hypothesis is
paired with every other hypothesis in the n-best list
(Equation 7); while for the BW setting, it is only
paired with the worst hypothesis (Equation 8). The
generation of T in PW setting is the same with
PRO sampling, we refer the readers to the original
paper of Hopkins and May (2011).

4.3 Training Procedure

In standard training algorithm for classification,
the training instances stays the same in each itera-
tion. In machine translation, decoding algorithms
usually return a very different n-best set with dif-
ferent parameters. This is due to the exponentially
large size of search space. MERT and PRO extend
the current n-best set by merging the n-best set
of all previous iterations into a pool (Och, 2003;
Hopkins and May, 2011). In this way, the enlarged
n-best set may give a better approximation of the
true hypothesis set C and may lead to better and
more stable training results.

We argue that the training should still focus on
hypotheses obtained in current round, because in
each iteration the searching for the n-best set is in-
dependent of previous iterations. To compromise
the above two goals, in our practice, training hy-
pothesis pairs are first generated from the current
n-best set, then merged with the pairs generated
from all previous iterations. In order to make the
model focus more on pairs from current iteration,
we assign pairs in previous iterations a small con-
stant weight and assign pairs in current iteration a
relatively large constant weight 2. This is inspired
by the AdaBoost algorithm (Schapire, 1999) in
weighting instances.

Following the spirit of MERT, we propose a
iterative training procedure (Algorithm 1). The

2In our experiments, we empirically set the constants to
be 0.1 and 0.9, respectively.

7: Ti ← Ti ∪ T
8: end for
9: Tall ←WeightedCombine(∪i−1k=0Tk, Ti)

10: θi+1 ← Optimize(Tall, θi)
11: end for

training starts by randomly initialized model pa-
rameters θ0 (line 1). In ith iteration, the decod-
ing algorithm decodes each sentence f to get the
n-best set Cnbest (line 5). Training hypothesis
pairs T are extracted from Cnbest according to the
training criterion described in Section 4.2 (line 6).
Newly collected pairs Ti are combined with pairs
from previous iterations before used for training
(line 9). θi+1 is obtained by solving Equation 6
using the Conjugate Sub-Gradient method (Le et
al., 2011) (line 10).

5 Structure of the Network

Although neural networks bring strong expressive
power to the modeling of translation hypothesis,
training a neural network is prone to resulting in
local minimum which may affect the training re-
sults. We speculate that one reason for these local
minimums is that the structure of a well-connected
network has too many parameters. Take a neu-
ral network with k nodes in the input layer and m
nodes in the hidden layer as an example. Every
node in the hidden layer is connected to each of
the k input nodes. This simple structure resulting
in at least k ×m parameters.

In Section 4.2, we use L1 norm in the objec-
tive function in order to get sparser solutions. In
this section, we propose some constrained network
structures according to our prior knowledge of the
features. These structures have much less param-
eters or simpler structures comparing to original
neural networks, thus reduce the possibility of get-
ting stuck in local minimums.

829



5.1 Network with two-degree Hidden Layer

We find the first pitfall of the standard two-layer
neural network is that each node in the hidden
layer receives input from every input layer node.
Features used in SMT are usually manually de-
signed, which has their concrete meanings. For a
network of several hidden nodes, combining every
features into every hidden node may be redundant
and not necessary to represent the quality of a hy-
pothesis.

As a result, we take a harsh step and constrain
the nodes in hidden layer to have a in-degree of
two, which means each hidden node only accepts
inputs from two input nodes. We do not use any
other prior knowledge about features in this set-
ting. So for a network with k nodes in the in-
put layer, the hidden layer should contain C2k =
k(k− 1)/2 nodes to accept all combinations from
the input layer. We name this network structure as
Two-Degree Hidden Layer Network (TDN).

It is easy to see that a TDN has C2k × 2 =
k(k − 1) parameters for the hidden layer because
of the constrained degree. This is one order of
magnitude less than a standard two-layer network
with the same number of hidden nodes, which has
C2k × k = k2(k − 1)/2 parameters.

Note that we perform a 2-degree combination
that looks similar in spirit with those combina-
tion of atomic features in large scale discrimina-
tive learning for other NLP tasks, such as POS tag-
ging and parsing. However, unlike the practice in
these tasks that directly combines values of differ-
ent features to generate a new feature type, we first
linearly combine the value of these features and
perform non-linear transformation on these values
via an activation function.

5.2 Network with Grouped Features

It might be a too strong constraint to require the
hidden node have in-degree of 2. In order to re-
lax this constraint, we need more prior knowledge
from the features.

Our first observation is that there are different
types of features. These types are different from
each other in terms of value ranges, sources, im-
portance, etc. For example, language model fea-
tures usually take a very small value of probability,
and word count feature takes a integer value and
usually has a much higher weight in linear case
than other count features.

The second observation is that features of the

same type may not have complex interaction with
each other. For example, it is reasonable to com-
bine language model features with word count fea-
tures in a hidden node. But it may not be neces-
sary to combine the count of initial phrases and the
count of unknown words into a hidden node.

Based on the above two intuitions, we design
a new structure of network that has the following
constraints: given a disjoint partition of features:
G1, G2,..., Gk, every hidden node takes input from
a set of input nodes, where any two nodes in this
set come from two different feature groups. Un-
der this constraint, the in-degree of a hidden node
is at most k. We name this network structure as
Grouped Network (GN).

In practice, we divide the basic features in Sec-
tion 3.2 into five groups: language model features,
translation probability features, lexical probability
features, the word count feature, and the rest of
count features. This division considers not only
the value ranges, but also types of features and the
possibility of them interact with each other.

6 Experiments and Results

6.1 General Settings

We conduct experiments on a large scale machine
translation tasks. The parallel data comes from
LDC, including LDC2002E18, LDC2003E14,
LDC2004E12, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T10,
LDC2007T09, which consists of 8.2 million
of sentence pairs. Monolingual data includes
Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus. We use
multi-references data MT03 as training data,
MT02 as development data, and MT04, MT05
as test data. These data are mainly in the same
genre, avoiding the extra consideration of domain
adaptation.

tem is an in-house implementation of the hier-
archical phrase-based translation system(Chiang,
2005). We set the beam size to 20. We train a
5-gram language model on the monolingual data
with MKN smoothing(Chen and Goodman, 1998).
For each parameter tuning experiments, we ran the
same training procedure 3 times and present the
average results. The translation quality is evalu-
ated use 4-gram case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002). Significant test is performed using
bootstrap re-sampling implemented by Clark et
al. (2011). We employ a two-layer neural network
with 11 input layer nodes, corresponding to fea-
tures listed in Section 3.2 and 1 output layer node.
The number of nodes in the hidden layer varies in
different settings. The sigmoid function is used as
the activation function for each node in the hidden
layer. For the output layer we use a linear activa-
tion function. We try different λ for the L1 norm
from 0.01 to 0.00001 and use the one with best
performance on the development set. We solve the
optimization problem with ALGLIB package4.

6.2 Experiments of Training Criteria

This set experiments evaluates different training
criteria discussed in Section 4.1. We generate
hypothesis-pair according to BW, BR and PW cri-
teria, respectively, and perform training with these
pairs. In the PW criterion, we use the sampling
method of PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) and get
the 50 hypothesis pairs for each sentence. We use
20 hidden nodes for all three settings to make a
fair comparison.

The results are presented in Table 2. The
first two rows compare training with and with-
out the weighted combination of hypothesis pairs
we discussed in Section 4.3. As the result sug-
gested, with the weighted combination of hypothe-
sis pairs from previous iterations, the performance
improves significantly on both test sets.

Although the system performance on the dev
set varies, the performance on test sets are al-
most comparable. This suggest that although the
three training criteria are based on different as-
sumptions, their are basically equivalent for train-
ing translation systems.

Criteria Pairs/iteration Accuracy(%)
BR 19 70.7
BW 1 79.5
PW 100 67.3

Table 3: Comparison of different training criteria
in number of new instances per iteration and train-
ing accuracy.

We also compares the three training criteria in
their number of new instances per iteration and
final training accuracy (Table 3). Compared to
BR which tries to separate the best hypothesis
from the rest hypotheses in the n-best set, and PW
which tries to obtain a correct ranking of all hy-
potheses, BW only aims at separating the best and
worst hypothesis of each iteration, which is a eas-
ier task for learning a classifiers. It requires the
least training instances and achieves the best per-
formance in training. Note that, the accuracy for
each system in Table 3 are the accuracy each sys-
tem achieves after training stops. They are not cal-
culated on the same set of instances, thus not di-
rectly comparable. We use the differences in accu-
racy as an indicator for the difficulties of the cor-
responding learning task.

For the rest of this paper, we use the BW crite-
rion because it is much simpler compared to sam-
pling method of PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011).

6.3 Experiments of Network Structures

We make several comparisons of the network
structures and compare them with a baseline hi-
erarchical phrase-based translation system (HPB).

different systems5. All 5 two-layer feed forward
neural networks models could achieve compara-
ble or better performance comparing to the base-
line system. We can see that training a larger net-
work may lead to better translation quality (from
TLayer20 and TLayer30 to TLayer50). However,
increasing the number of hidden node to 100 and
200 does not bring further improvement. One pos-
sible reason is that training a larger network with
arbitrary connections brings in too many param-
eters which may be difficult to train with limited
training data.

TDN and GN are the two network structures
proposed in Section 5. With the constraint that
all input to the hidden node should be of degree
2, TDN performs comparable to the baseline sys-
tem. With the grouped feature, we could design
networks such as GN, which shows significant im-
provement over the baseline systems (+0.57) and
achieves the best performance among all neural
systems.

5TLayer20 is the same system as BW in Table 2

Table 4 shows statistics related to the efficiency
issue of different systems. The baseline system
(HPB) uses MERT for training. HPB has a very
small number of parameters and searches for the
best parameters exhaustively in each iteration. The
non-linear systems with few nodes (TLayer20 and
TLayer30) train faster than HPB in each iteration
because they perform back-propagation instead of
exhaustive search. We iterate 15 iterations for each
non-linear system, while MERT takes about 10
rounds to reach its best performance.

When the number of nodes in the hidden layer
increases (from 20 to 200), the number of param-
eters in the system also increases, which requires
longer time to compute the score for each hypoth-
esis and to update the parameters through back-
propagation. The network with 200 hidden nodes
takes about twice the time to train for each itera-
tion, compared to the linear system6.

TDN and GN have larger numbers of hidden

nodes. However, because of our intuitions in de-
signing the structure of the networks, the degree
of the hidden node is constrained. So these two
networks are sparser in parameters and take sig-
nificant less training time than standard neural net-
works. For example, GN has a comparable num-
ber of hidden nodes with TLayer200, but only has
half of its parameters and takes about 70% time to
train in each iteration. In other words, our pro-
posed network structure provides more efficient
training in these cases and achieve better results.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we discuss a non-linear framework
for modeling translation hypothesis for statisti-
cal machine translation system. We also present
a learning framework including training criterion
and algorithms to integrate our modeling into a
state of the art hierarchical phrase based machine
translation system. Compared to previous effort
in bringing in non-linearity into machine transla-
tion, our method uses a single two-layer neural
networks and performs training independent with
any previous linear training methods (e.g. MERT).
Our method also trains its parameters without any
pre-training or post-training procedure. Experi-
ment shows that our method could improve the
baseline system even with the same feature as
input, in a large scale Chinese-English machine
translation task.

In training neural networks with hidden nodes,
we use heuristics to reduce the complexity of net-
work structures and obtain extra advantages over
standard networks. It shows that heuristics and in-
tuitions of the data and features are still important
to a machine translation system.

Neural networks are able to perform feature
learning by using hidden nodes to model the in-
teraction among a large vector of raw features,
as in image and speech processing (Krizhevsky et
al., 2012; Hinton et al., 2012). We are trying to
model the interaction between hand-crafted fea-
tures, which is indeed similar in spirit with learn-
ing features from raw features. Although our fea-
tures already have concrete meaning, e.g. the
probability of translation, the fluency of target sen-
tence, etc. Combining these features may have ex-
tra advantage in modeling the translation process.

As future work, it is necessary to integrate more
features into our learning framework. It is also in-
teresting to see how the non-linear modeling fits

in to more complex learning tasks which involves
domain specific learning techniques.
