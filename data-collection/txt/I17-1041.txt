Abstract

This article presents a contrastive anal-
ysis between reading time and syn-
tactic/semantic categories in Japanese.
We overlaid the reading time annota-
tion of BCCWJ-EyeTrack and a syntac-
tic/semantic category information anno-
tation on the ‘Balanced Corpus of Con-
temporary Written Japanese’. Statistical
analysis based on a mixed linear model
showed that verbal phrases tend to have
shorter reading times than adjectives, ad-
verbial phrases, or nominal phrases. The
results suggest that the preceding phrases
associated with the presenting phrases
promote the reading process to shorten the
gazing time.

1 Introduction

Most of the studies on sentence processing by
humans are based on confirmatory data analy-
sis. The methodology involves developing a hy-
pothesis, constructing sample sentences, includ-
ing the target language phenomena, and perform-
ing a psycholinguistic experiment, such as record-
ing reading time or event-related potentials. In
recent times, the ‘Balanced Corpus of Contem-
porary Written Japanese’ (hereafter ‘BCCWJ’)
(Maekawa et al., 2014) was compiled and pub-
lished. The reading time annotation on BCCWJ:
BCCWJ-EyeTrack (Asahara et al., 2016) is avail-
able for the linguistic research community. The
data in the BCCWJ enable us to perform ex-
ploratory data analysis in fair and reproducible en-
vironments.

We measured the readability of humans. More
concretely, we performed a contrast comparison
between reading time and syntactic/semantic cat-
egories of words. We prepared the annotation

of word senses on BCCWJ based on ‘Word List
by Semantic Principles’ (国立国語研究所, 1964,
2004). The original WLSP label annotation is on
both short unit words and long unit words in the
BCCWJ. We then mapped these annotations into
Bunsetsu(base phrase)-units.

The statistical analysis using a mixed linear
model shows that verbal phrases tend to have
shorter reading times than adjective/adverbial
phrases or nominal phrases.

Section 2 presents the related research. Section
3 shows the data and methods. Section 4 presents
the results, and Section 5 is the discussion. Sec-
tion 6 concludes this article and presents the im-
plications of our current work and the future work
we plan to conduct.

2 Related Work

First, we present related work on eye tracking. The
Dundee Eyetracking Corpus (Kennedy and Pynte,
2005) contains reading times for English and
French newspaper editorials from 10 native speak-
ers of each language that were recorded us-
ing eye-tracking equipment. The corpus does
not target a specific set of linguistic phenom-
ena but instead provides naturally occurring
texts for testing diverse hypotheses. For exam-
ple, (Demberg and Keller, 2008) used the cor-
pus to test Gibson’s dependency locality the-
ory (DLT) (Gibson, 2008) and Hale’s surprisal
theory (Hale, 2001). The corpus also allows
for replications to be conducted; for example,
(Roland et al., 2012) concluded that previous anal-
yses (Demberg and Keller, 2007) had been dis-
torted by the presence of a few outlier data points.

Second, we present language analyses or mod-
els with reading time or eye tracking gaze infor-
mation. (Barrett et al., 2016) presented a POS
tagging model with gaze patterns. (Klerke et al.,

for machine-processed sentences. (Iida et al.,

for the annotation of predicate–argument rela-
tions.

Our paper is slightly different from these pre-
ceding papers. We present a corpus-based psy-
cholinguistic research on the relationship between
reading time and syntactic/semantic categories.

3 Data and Method

We used the overlaid data of BCCWJ-EyeTrack
and syntactic/semantic categories, as given in Ta-
ble 1. We present the data below in detail.

3.1 BCCWJ and its annotation

We used BCCWJ (Maekawa et al., 2014) and its
annotation data. BCCWJ is a balanced corpus of
Japanese. We used newspaper articles from the
core data. The data were sampled by their produc-
tion. The sentences were segmented into word unit
boundaries of short unit words, long unit words,
and bunsetsu. The morphological information for
the short unit words and long unit words was an-
notated by human annotators.

We also used bunsetsu-based syntactic depen-

dency annotation(Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016)
for the data to investigate the correlation be-
tween syntactic dependency attachments and read-
ing time.

3.2 Reading Time Data: BCCWJ-EyeTrack

We now explain the two methods used for measur-
ing the reading time: eye tracking and self-paced
reading. The order of tasks was fixed with eye
tracking in the first session and self-paced read-
ing in the second session. Each participant saw
each text once with the task and segmentation of
the texts counterbalanced across participants.

Eye tracking was recorded with a tower-
mounted EyeLink 1000 (SR Research Ltd). The
view was binocular, but data were collected from
each participant’s right eye at a resolution of 1000
Hz. Participants looked at the display using a half-
mirror; their heads were fixed with their chins on
a chin rest. Unlike self-paced reading, during eye
tracking all segments were shown simultaneously.
This allowed more natural reading because each
participant could freely return and reread earlier
parts of the text on the same screen. However,
participants were not allowed to return to previous
screens. Stimulus texts were shown in a fixed full-
width font (MS Mincho 24 point) and displayed
horizontally as is customary with computer dis-
plays for Japanese; there were five lines per screen
on a 21.5-in display.1 Under the segmented con-
dition, a half-width space was used to indicate the
boundary between segments. In order to improve
vertical tracking accuracy, three empty lines were
placed between the lines of text. A line break
was inserted at the end of a sentence or when the
maximum 53 full-width characters per line was at-
tained. Moreover, line breaks were inserted at the
same points in the segmented and unsegmented
conditions to guarantee that the same number of
non-space characters was shown under both con-
ditions.

The same procedure was adopted for the self-
paced reading presentation except that the chin
rest was not used, and participants could move
their heads freely while looking directly at the
display. Doug Rohde’s Linger program Version
2.942 was used to record keyboard-press laten-
cies while sentences were shown using a non-
cumulative self-paced moving-window presenta-

els) set at 50 cm from the chin rest.

tion. This had the best correlation with eye-
tracking data when different styles of presenta-
tion were compared for English (Just et al., 1982).
Sentence segments were initially shown masked
with dashes. Participants pressed the space key of
the keyboard to reveal each subsequent segment of
the sentence, while all other segments reverted to
dashes. Participants were not allowed to go back
and reread earlier segments.

Twenty-four native Japanese speakers, who
were 18 years or older at the time, participated in
the experiment with due financial compensation.
The experiments were conducted from Septem-
ber to December 2015. The collected profile
data included the age (in 5-year brackets), gen-
der, educational background, eyesight (all par-
ticipants had uncorrected vision or vision cor-
rected with soft contact lenses or prescription
glasses), geographical linguistic background (i.e.,
the prefecture within Japan where they lived un-
til the age of 15), and parents’ place of birth.
The vocabulary size of the participants was mea-
sured using a Japanese language vocabulary eval-
uation test (Amano and Kondo, 1998). Partici-
pants indicated words they knew from a list of
50 words, and scores were calculated by taking
word-familiarity estimates into consideration. As
a measure of the working memory capacity, the
Japanese version of a reading span test was con-
ducted (Osaka and Osaka, 1994). Each partici-
pant read sentences aloud, each of which con-
tained an underlined content word. After each set
of sentences, the participants recalled the under-
lined words. If they successfully recalled all the
words, the set size was increased by one sentence
(sets of two to five sentences were used). The final
score was the largest set for which all words were
correctly recalled; a half point was added if half
the number of words were recalled in the last trial.

Reading times were collected for a subset of the
core data of the BCCWJ (Maekawa et al., 2014),
which consisted of newspaper article (PN: pub-
lished newspaper) samples. Articles were chosen
if they were annotated with information such as
syntactic dependencies, predicative clausal struc-
tures, co-references, focus of negation, and similar
details following the list of articles that were given
annotation priority in the BCCWJ.

The 21 newspaper articles3 chosen were divided

3The original BCCWJ-EyeTrack paper (Asahara et al.,
2016) presented 20 articles. However, there were two con-

into four data sets containing five articles each:
A, B, C, and D. Table 2 presents the numbers of
words, sentences, and screens (i.e., pages) for each
data set. Each article was presented starting on a
new screen.

Table 2: Data set sizes

Data set Segments Sentences Screens
A 470 66 19
B 455 67 21
C 355 44 16
D 363 41 15

Articles were shown segmented or unsegmented
(i.e., with or without a half-width space to mark
the boundary between segments). Segments con-
formed to the definition for bunsetsu units (a
content word followed by functional morphology,
e.g., a noun with a case marker) in the BCCWJ as
prescribed by the National Institute for Japanese
Language and Linguistics. Each participant was
assigned to one of eight groups of three partici-
pants each. Each group was subjected to one of the
eight experimental conditions with varying com-
binations of measurement methods, and boundary
marking for different data sets was presented in
different orders.

During the self-paced reading session, each seg-
ment was displayed separately, and participants
could not return to reread earlier parts of the text.
Therefore, the latencies for the button presses are
straightforward measures of the time spent on each
segment.

With regard to data from eye tracking, five types
of measurements were used: first fixation time
(FFT), first pass time (FPT), regression path time
(RPT), second pass time (SPT), and total time
(TOTAL). These are explained in Figure 1.

The FFT is the duration of fixation measured
when the gaze first enters the area of interest. In
the figure, the FFT for “the first fiscal year settling
of accounts also” (hereafter “the area of interest”)
is the duration of fixation 5.

The FPT is the total duration of fixation from
the moment the gaze first stops within the area of
interest until it leaves the focus area by moving to
the right or left of this area. In the figure, the FPT

secutive articles in data set C. These two articles were pre-
sented on separate screens. Thus, we split them into two for
statistical analysis.

is the sum of the durations of fixations 5 and 6.
The RPT is the total span of time from the mo-

ment the gaze enters the area of interest until it
crosses the right boundary of this area for the first
time. In the figure, the RPT is the sum of the dura-
tions for fixations 5–9. The RPT can include fixa-
tions to the left of the left boundary (e.g., 7 and 8)
and the durations of fixations when the gaze re-
turns to the area of interest (e.g., 9).

The SPT is the total span of time the gaze rests
in the area of interest excluding the FPT. In the
figure, the SPT is the sum of the durations of fixa-
tions 9 and 11.

The TOTAL is the total duration the gaze rests
within the area of interest. In other words, it is the
sum of SPT and FPT. In the figure, TOTAL is the
sum of the durations of fixations 5, 6, 9, and 11.

3.3 WLSP and annotation

‘Word List by Semantic Principles’ (Bunrui Goi-
hyo) (国立国語研究所, 1964) is ‘a A collection of
words classified and arranged by their meanings’.
The first published version of WLSP in 1964 in-
cludes around 33,000 words. The revised and en-
larged version of WLSP (国立国語研究所, 2004)
was published in 2004. The data include around
79,000 word tokens with 100,000 word sense to-
kens.

Table 3 shows an example entry ‘この (kono:
this)’ in WLSP. The article number ‘3.1010’ iden-
tifies a word belonging to the syntactic/semantic
category. The first digit of the article number
refers to ‘class’, which is a syntactic category of
the entry: class ‘1’ represents a ‘体’ nominal en-
try; class ‘2’ represents a ‘用’ verbal entry; class
‘3’ is an ‘相’ adjective entry; and class ‘4’ is a ‘他’
other entry including conjunctive and interjection.
This category classification is originally from the
‘Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana’ (大乘起信
論;大乗起信論) in Mahayana Buddhism.

The digits to the right of a period identify the se-
mantic category. The first decimal digit represents
a ‘division’, which is a major semantic category:
division ‘.1’ is a ‘抽象的関係 (関係)’ relation en-
try; division ‘.2’ is a ‘人間活動の主体 (主体)’ sub-
ject entry; division ‘.3’ is a ‘精神および行為 (活
動)’ action entry; division ‘.4’ is a ‘生産物および
用具 (生産物)’ product entry; and division ‘.5’ is a
‘自然物および自然現象 (自然)’ nature entry. The

first two decimal digits refer to the ‘section’. Four
decimal digits refer to the ‘article’, which is article
number 895, of the finest semantic categories.

We annotated the words from these WLSP arti-
cle numbers based on the BCCWJ core samples.
The annotation was carried out for content words
for short unit words and long unit words of BC-
CWJ. Functional words were not annotated in the
WLSP category. Now, the samples of BCCWJ-
EyeTrack have already been annotated. We de-
fined the set of right-most long unit words as the
category of the bunsetsu. The semantic category
(class) and syntactic category (division) were reas-
signed on segments. We called them WLSPLUWA
and WLSPLUWB, respectively. We note that, there
are still unassigned entries for the segment even if
all the words have been manually checked. We as-
signed the boolean value of WLSPLUWFALSE for
the unassigned words.

3.4 Statistical Analysis

We investigated the reading time (logtime) of
NPs that were annotated with the WLSP labels.
Whereas Asahara et al.’s paper was based on
time, ours was based on logtime to reduce the
outliers in the model. During the preprocessing,
we excluded data {authorsData, caption,
listItem, profile, titleBlock} of
metadata. We also excluded zero-millisecond
data points from the eye tracking data. The
number of data points were 17,628 for SELF
(100.0%); 13,232 for FFT, FPT, RPT, and TOTAL
(75.0%); and 4,769 for SPT (27.0%). After
model-based trimming was used to eliminate
points beyond 3.0 standard deviations, the model
was rebuilt (Baayen, 2008). subj and article
were considered as random effects, as expressed
in the formula in Figure 2. We used the lme4
package on R.

4 Results

Table 4 shows the results. Each number shows
the coefficient with the standard error in brack-
ets. A negative value of the coefficient indi-
cates that the factor shortens the reading time.

A positive value of the coefficient indicates that
the factor lengthens the reading time. The base
fixed effect of the syntactic category is the nom-
inal phrase(WLSPLUWA1), and the base fixed
effect of the semantic category is the relation
(WLSPLUWB1). Note that the time is based on log-
arithm.

First, we confirm the results of the non-WLSP
related terms. The presentation with spaces
between segments makes the reading time of
FPT, RPT, SPT, and TOTAL faster than the one
without spaces for eye tracking methods. To
improve the readability of texts, one should
simply introduce spaces at Bunsetsu boundaries.
The longer length of the segment makes
reading times long except for FFT, because
the gazing area in this case is correlated to the
probability of the fixation. More dependency
arcs make shorter reading times for the segment.
This fact supports Anti-locality (Konieczny,
2000). The layout information (is first,
is last, is second last) is for the eye
movement at the text wrap. All reading times
other than SPT is longer at the left most seg-
ment (is first). The reading time of FPT,
RPT, and Total is longer at the right most and
the second right most segments (is last,
is second last). With regard to the pre-
sentation order (sessionN, articleN,
screenN, lineN, segmentN), As the
experiment progressed, the reading time became
shorter. This means that the subject participants
become more familiar with the experiment.

Next, we confirm the results related to the
WLSP syntactic categories. For all types of read-
ing times, the verbal segments (WLSPLUWA2)
had significantly shorter reading times than the
nominal segments (WLSPLUWA1). For read-
ing time types other than FFT, the adjec-
tive/adverbial segments (WLSPLUWA3) had sig-
nificantly shorter reading times than the nominal
segments (WLSPLUWA1). For reading time types
other than SPT, the adjective/adverbial segments
(WLSPLUWA3) had significantly longer reading
times than the verbal segments (WLSPLUWA1).

Finally, we confirm the result related to
WLSP semantic categories. The abstract rela-
tion (WLSPLUWB.1) shows significantly longer
reading times of FFT and TOTAL than of

others such as subject (WLSPLUWB.2), action
(WLSPLUWB.3), and product (WLSPLUWB.4).

5 Discussions

In this section, we discuss why reading time varies
in syntactic and semantic categories.

Anti-locality is the term used to describe the
phenomenon in which segments with more de-
pendents in their preceding context have shorter
reading times (Konieczny, 2000). This phe-
nomenon was reported for German double objects
(Konieczny and Döring, 2003). It was then inves-
tigated for Japanese double objects (Uchida et al.,
2014). These shortened reading times cannot be
explained by the predictions of the working mem-
ory models, in which segments with more depen-
dents load for the reading (Gibson, 2008), or in
which the number of dependents do not affect the
reading time of the succeeding segments.

This phenomenon is compatible with surprisal
theory (Hale, 2001; Levy and Gibson, 2013). It
explains how double objects of head final lan-
guages, in which the predicate has both a di-
rect and an indirect object tend to have shorter
reading times than one that has only a direct ob-
ject. Asahara et al. (2016) investigated the anti-
locality phenomenon in more general settings
with the dependency from BCCWJ-DepPara
(Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016). The results
show that the segment with higher dependency has
a shorter reading time than a segment with a lower
dependency.

In this research, the reading time tends to be
shorter in the order of Noun (体, WLSPLUWA1)
> Adjective/Adverb (相, WLSPLUWA3) > Verb
(用, WLSPLUWA2) in the syntactic categories. The
noun (WLSPLUWA1) tends to indicate the object
and to become the argument of a predicate such
as a verb or an adjective. Although the noun can
also become a predicate with a copula verb, the
modifier or argument for the noun is limited. The
category (WLSPLUWA3) includes a predicative ad-
jective with arguments. The verb (WLSPLUWA2)
tends to be a predicate with arguments at the
clause end. The tendency is reliable because the
standard errors of the coefficients are very small.
Though we included dependency as a fixed fac-
tor, we observed these tendencies for the reading
time, in which the syntactic category with more ar-
gument tends to have a shorter reading time than
the others. It indicates that arguments of a predi-
cate in Japanese tend not to be overtly Appearing
in the context. The omitted arguments may help
predict the upcoming predicate, although the ar-

guments tend to be omitted in the context. There-
fore, the results do not support the working mem-
ory model, in which the load to memorize the pre-
ceding contexts interferes with the reading. The
prediction model is a more plausible hypothesis
than the working memory model.

In the semantic category, the abstract relation
has a shorter reading time than others. The relation
has at least two arguments. The existence of the
arguments helps to promote the reading time.

6 Conclusions

This article explores the correlation between read-
ing time and the syntactic/semantic category of
the text. The reading time tends to be shorter in
the order of Noun (1) > Adjective/Adverb (3) >
Verb (2) in the syntactic categories. The relation
(WLSPLUWB.1) tends to be the shortest in the se-
mantic categories. The results show that the bun-
setsu with arguments tend to have shorter reading
times than the ones without arguments. This fact
supports the anti-locality (Konieczny and Döring,
2003) and Hale’s surprisal theory (Hale, 2001).

Our current work comprises two analyses. The
first one is a contrastive analysis between read-
ing time and information structure annotation. We
overlaid the annotation of information structures
(Miyauchi et al., 2017) on the reading time data.
The result showed that reading time can reveal the
difference in whether the target nominal phrase is
hearer-new or bridging (Asahara, 2017). The sec-
ond one is contrastive analysis between reading
time and the clause boundary category annotation.
The result shows that the clause end segments tend
to have shorter reading times. Furthermore, the
reading time of clause boundaries vary according
to the classification of the clauses.

In our future work, we plan to introduce
Bayesian linear mixed model (Sorensen et al.,
2016) for the statistical modelling. We also
hope to investigate the correlation between read-
ing time and word familiarity rate. Word fa-
miliarity rate is the fundamental data to esti-
mate Japanese language vocabulary evaluation
test (Amano and Kondo, 1998). However, word-
familiarity-rate data were constructed around 20
years ago. We now plan to reconstruct word-
familiarity-rate data on WLSP entries by crowd
sourcing using a Bayesian linear mixed model.
