Abstract

We present a data-driven approach to detect periods of linguistic change and the lexical and
grammatical features contributing to change. We focus on the development of scientific English
in the late modern period. Our approach is based on relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler Diver-
gence) comparing temporally adjacent periods and sliding over the time line from past to present.
Using a diachronic corpus of scientific publications of the Royal Society of London, we show
how periods of change reflect the interplay between lexis and grammar, where periods of lexical
expansion are typically followed by periods of grammatical consolidation resulting in a balance
between expressivity and communicative efficiency. Our method is generic and can be applied
to other data sets, languages and time ranges.

1 Introduction

The awareness of the necessity and possibilities of large scale analysis of the temporal dynamics of cul-
tural phenomena has risen considerably in the last two decades or so in a number of scientific disciplines,
including literary studies, musicology, biology and marketing research. One common challenge is to de-
termine the periods of change. For example, to detect periods of stylistic change in popular music Mauch
et al. (2015) use data-driven methods from bioinformatics based on a set of predefined audio features; or
for periodization of prose texts van Hulle and Kestemont (2016) use stylometric methods with selected
function words.

Here, we come from the perspective of language and linguistics. Specifically, we are interested in the
formation of discourse types and registers. Focusing on scientific writing in the period of late Modern
English (1700-1900) — the period in which scientific writing evolved as a distinctive discourse type
(Atkinson, 1999; Bazerman, 1988) — we want to test the hypothesis that scientific writing became in-
creasingly specialized, expert-oriented and geared towards communicative efficiency (Halliday, 1988).
Linguistic reflexes are expected in vocabulary expansion, notably in the area of terminology, and consol-
idation in grammatical usage. Therefore, we consider both the lexical and the grammatical level as well
as their interplay.

While there is a long tradition in diachronic, corpus-based analysis (see Nevalainen (2006) for an
overview), time periods and linguistic features considered are typically predefined, thus introducing pos-
sible biases. To avoid this, we have designed a data-driven approach based on the information-theoretic
measure of relative entropy by which we can both detect features involved in diachronic linguistic change
and discern the time periods change(s) occur(s). Our approach is generic and can be applied to any di-
achronic data set with any type of linguistic feature.

Following a more detailed presentation of related work (Section 2), we describe our approach in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 4, we report our results capturing important aspects of change in language use in the
scientific domain. Section 5 provides a brief summary of our main results and an outlook on follow-up
studies.

2 Related work

The traditional linguistic method of describing temporal change in language use is to start with a set of
preselected linguistic features and inspect their frequency distributions across predefined time spans (cf.
Nevalainen (2006) for an overview in the area of corpus linguistics). While clearly providing interest-
ing and relevant descriptive insights on changing language use, this kind of approach is biased in two
regards. First, features are selected on the basis of the human analyst’s educated guesses about which
linguistic features are subject to change with a view to high-frequency features (e.g. Atkinson (1999),
Banks (2008), Biber and Finegan (1989), Biber and Gray (2016), Degaetano-Ortlieb et al. (2014), Fanego
(1996), Michel et al. (2011), Moskowich and Crespo (2012), Rissanen et al. (1997), Teich et al. (2016)).
Other frequency bands, while potentially relevant, are not considered. Second, the time spans are typ-
ically predefined, too. For example, for a period of two to three hundred years under consideration,
typically 20 or 50-year periods are selected. This approach may obscure trends present in the data and
prevent the exact periodization of a given change or set of changes.

To remedy these drawbacks, more exploratory, data-driven approaches have been argued for. In
corpus-linguistics, Gries and Hilpert (2008) propose a specific clustering approach which they apply
to the historical development of English. In van Hulle and Kestemont (2016) stylometry methods are
applied to the periodization of literary works of Samuel Beckett. Popescu and Strapparava (2013) use
a statistical approach for the characterization of epochs. Within the field of computational sociolinguis-
tics, various techniques (such as topic modeling, correlations, regression) are tested for applicability to
sociological questions and interpretability of the features involved in variation (see e.g., McFarland et
al. (2013), O’Connor et al. (2011), Eisenstein (2018)). A recent strand of data-driven approaches for
the analysis of diachronic change applies information-theoretic divergence measures. In particular, the
use of relative entropy, implemented as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) or its symmetrical vari-
ant Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), as a measure of changes in the
probability distribution over linguistic features has proven effective. For example, Hughes et al. (2012)
measure stylistic influence in the evolution of literature and Klingenstein et al. (2014) analyze to what
extent the ways of talking in criminal trials differed between violent and nonviolent offenses over time.
Or Bochkarev et al. (2014) use KLD to compare change in the frequency distribution of words within one
language and a symmetric version to compare changes across languages in the Google Books Corpus.
Also working on the Google Books data set, Pechenick et al. (2015) use JSD to assess the corpus’ valid-
ity for analysis of cultural and linguistic evolution. Furthermore, Fankhauser et al. (2014) demonstrate
the applicability of KLD for corpus comparison at large, showing KLD on various corpora (including
the Brown corpora), and provide an interactive visualization for exploratory inspection of (degrees of)
divergence between corpora as well as the items (here: words) contributing to the divergence. In our
own previous work, besides other applications such as intra-textual variation across sections of research
articles from biology (Degaetano-Ortlieb and Teich, 2017), we have used KLD to analyze the linguistic
development of scientific writing over time considering pre-defined time periods (50 years) and com-
parison to general English to discern change specific to scientific writing (Degaetano-Ortlieb and Teich,
2016; Degaetano-Ortlieb et al., 2018; Degaetano-Ortlieb and Strötgen, 2018). In particular, we found
major changes going on around the period of 1750-1800.

We build on this work and extend the existing approaches by capturing periods of change, i.e. deter-
mining when a change occurs rather than a priori setting specific periods. Most similar to our approach
is the recent study of Barron et al. (2018) on debates held in the French Revolution’s first parliament
using KLD between sequential speeches considering the notions of novelty (abrupt change), transience
(novelty of the past), and resonance (novelty minus transience). While they only employ the aggregated
KL divergence, we consider the contribution of individual linguistic features to KL divergence. On this
basis, we are able to determine which features are involved in change at different linguistic levels and to
inspect how different linguistic levels interact to allow for a balanced information density in (scientific)
communication. Thus, our approach addresses the above mentioned drawbacks — predefined periods
and preselected features — and provides a generic, exploratory method for periodization combining
feature detection and period determination on the basis of one mechanism.

3 Method

3.1 Royal Society Corpus

The data set we use is the Royal Society Corpus (RSC) (Kermes et al., 2016), consisting of the journal
publications of the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of London – the first and longest-
running English periodical of scientific writing. The RSC has approx. 32 million running tokens and
around 10.000 documents, spanning from 1665 (first publication) to 1869. It is encoded for text type
(article, abstract), author, title, date of publication, and time periods (decades, fifty years). Linguistic
annotation is provided at the levels of tokens (with normalized and original forms), lemmas, and parts
of speech using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), achieving 95.1% on normalized word forms (normalization
is based on VARD; see Baron and Rayson (2008)). The corpus is hosted by a CLARIN-D repository1,
which provides a free download as a vertical text format (vrt). The RSC provides a well-suited test bed
for periodization, as it spans approx. two centuries and there are a number of linguistic studies on some
parts of this material (e.g. Biber and Finegan (1997), Atkinson (1999), Banks (2008)). As we detected
major changes around the period of 1750-1800 in previous studies (Degaetano-Ortlieb and Teich, 2016;
Degaetano-Ortlieb et al., 2018), we select texts from 1700 to 1850 for periodization with a cut off of
five occurrences per document to exclude (especially for the older documents) OCR errors and other
possible biases. Table 1 lists by decade the number of lemmas and part-of-speech (POS) trigrams used
to approximate the lexical and grammatical level, respectively, as well as the number of types of lemmas
and POS trigrams.

3.2 Method of periodization at different linguistic levels

We exemplify our proposed method for periodization with Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) consid-
ering two linguistic levels – lexical and grammatical – without preselecting single linguistic features. For
the lexical level we use all lemmas (unigrams) occurring at least five times in a document. The grammat-
ical level is captured by sequences of three parts of speech (POS trigrams, e.g. noun-preposition-noun)
again with a minimum of five occurrences per document. Trigrams were chosen as shorter sequences
tend to not reflect grammatical structures, longer sequences lead to quite sparse data. To further avoid
possible POS tagging errors, in the extraction procedure nouns were restricted to a size of >2 charac-
ters. Furthermore, we exclude POS trigrams consisting of characters constituting sentence markers (e.g.
fullstops, colons), brackets, symbols (e.g. equal signs), and words tagged as foreign words. By looking
at lemmas, we capture vocabulary changes and by looking at POS trigrams we capture changes in gram-
matical use. Note however that any kind of linguistic unit could be used (phoneme, morpheme, word,
etc).

Relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD; Kullback and Leibler (1951)) is a method of
comparing probability distributions measuring the number of additional bits needed to encode a given
data set A when a (non-optimal) model based on a data set B is used (cf. Equation (1)).

D(A||B) =
∑
i

p(featurei|A)log2
p(featurei|A)
p(featurei|B)

(1)

Applied to the comparison of language corpora, KLD gives us an indication of the degree of difference
between corpora measured in bits as well as the features that are primarily associated with a difference,
i.e. those features that need (relatively) high amounts of additional bits for encoding2. In the models we
employ, difference in vocabulary size is controlled for by representing the data sets by ngram language
models smoothed with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and lambda 0.05 (cf. Zhai and Lafferty (2004) and
Fankhauser et al. (2014)).

To detect periods of change using KLD, we slide over the time line of the corpus to find relative peaks
or troughs in relative entropy which are taken to indicate a change. For this we select a starting year
(e.g. 1720) and a sliding window (e.g. 2 years). We then use KLD to compare preceding (pre period)
and subsequent years (post period) from the sliding window. Defining the size of the sliding window
depends on the data set used. In our case, as publications do not appear yearly in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society, we use a minimum of a 2-year sliding window. For other text types, such as news texts,
for example, the sliding window could be based on months or even days. The bigger the sliding window
based on a particular data set the less fine-grained the observed changes will be. A further parameter
to be set is the time range of comparison for pre and post periods, which again has to be set according
to the data set used and the aimed periodization. In our case, we use a period range of 20 and 10 years
in which we assume changes to occur. Note that KLD is asymmetric and we are only interested in the
direction from post to pre as we aim to determine periodization from past to present in the development
of scientific writing. Thus, we measure divergence only between post (after sliding window) and pre
(before sliding window) as shown in Equation (2).

D(post||pre) =
∑
i

p(uniti|post)log2
p(uniti|post)
p(uniti|pre)

(2)

Based on this, we build KLD models for lemmas and POS trigrams to observe divergences at lexical and
grammatical levels, respectively. For both linguistic levels, we use all lemmas/POS trigrams for modeling
that occur at least five times in a document. For each window, KLD models are created comparing post
with pre periods. For the analysis we use 2-, 5-, and 10-year windows inspecting 10- and 20-year ranges.

Moreover, the individual contribution (discriminative power) of a feature to relative entropy allows us
to observe which features are involved in change. The higher the KLD value of a feature (here: lemma
or POS trigram), the more discriminative the feature is for the post period (see Equation (3)).

Dfeature(post||pre) = p(feature|post)log2
p(feature|post)
p(feature|pre)

(3)

We then also test if there is a significant difference between the relative frequencies of a feature in the
pre and post periods by an unpaired Welch’s t-test (see equation (3) with var denoting the variance and
n the number of documents in a corpus).

t =
meanpre −meanpost√

(
varpre
npre

+
varpost
npost

)
(4)

Thus, for each post with pre period comparison, we obtain a list of those features that contribute most
to the distinction of a post period (high KLD value) and which pass the significance test (p-value<0.05).

2Note that KLD is an asymmetric measure, i.e. there may be a significant difference between a data set A and B when B is
used as a basis for encoding but not necessarily when A is used as a basis. Also, the features responsible for a difference may
be different ones.

In addition, at the lexical level to select from these lists those lemmas that show the greatest variation
in terms of their contribution over time, we calculate the standard deviation of the KLD value of each
lemma across all comparisons. At the grammatical level, as the set of possible options is more confined,
we consider all discriminative and significant POS trigrams but still rank them by the standard deviation
over time.

Given a data set of the features’ occurrences across time (e.g. by years, months, days), the periodization
procedure is operationalized with the software environment R (R Development Core Team, 2010) with
a script allowing to select the window and period range and run the process automatically. The R code
will be released upon publication through Github via a link on https://stefaniadegaetano.com/.

4 Change of language use in scientific writing (18th and 19th century)

We present the results of application of the described method on the time period of 1700-1850 of the
Royal Society Corpus at the lexical and grammatical levels. The focus is on comparison of post periods
with pre periods, tracing the development of scientific writing over time. For this, we inspect different
parameters as described in Section 3.2. For both analyses, we consider (1) overall diachronic trends, (2)
when possible changes occur, and (3) which features contribute to changes.

4.1 Overall diachronic trends at the lexical and grammatical level

First, we want to investigate which diachronic trends we can observe over time in scientific writing across
different linguistic levels.

At the lexical level, Figure 1 shows KLD values plotted on the time line based on lemmas (with a 2-
year window and 20-year slices of pre and post periods). The general tendency shows peaks and troughs
in KLD, i.e. periods of lexical expansion (where a post period shows higher KL divergence from a pre
period) are followed by periods of lexical consolidation (where a post period shows lower KL divergence
from a pre period). We can observe that there are smaller peaks around the 1740s, 1750s, and a major
peak around the end of the 18th century followed by a trough in KLD and again an increase in the early
19th century. For example, considering the year 1795 (here: 2-year window (1795-1796)), KL divergence
between the 20 years following (post) and the 20 years preceding (pre) the window is 0.39 bits, while
considering 1805 it drops to 0.27 bits. Thus, around 1795 we have a period of lexical expansion, while
around 1805 we have a period of consolidation.

Let us now consider the grammatical level approximated by POS trigrams. In Figure 2, we clearly see
a declining tendency of KLD at the grammatical level, i.e. over time grammatical usage consolidates in
comparison to a more varied usage in the past. Comparing Figure 1 with 2, while at the lexical level
we have waves of expansion and consolidation, at the grammatical level there is a strong tendency of
consolidation. This tendency becomes even more pronounced from the mid 18th century onwards. The
formation of the scientific register and processes of professionalization (Ure, 1982; Biber and Gray,
2011; Halliday, 1988) are presumably reflected here. In fact, from 1751 onwards the Proceedings of the



27

Royal Society started to have a reviewing process.
In summary, we can deduce that the lexical and grammatical levels play different roles in the develop-

ment of scientific writing in the RSC. The consolidation of the grammatical level might be a counterbal-
ance to the phases of expansion at the lexical level. In the next sections, we present a detailed account
on which lemmas and grammatical structures contribute to periods of change occurring at both levels.

4.2 Lexical contributions to periods of change

In a second step, we investigate which lemmas contribute most to the observed differences by selecting
lemmas based on their discriminative power as described in Section 3.2. To consider how different time
windows and ranges might impact the results, we will consider windows of 2, 5, and 10 years with 20
and 10 years of pre and post periods.

Figure 3 shows lemmas contributing to periods of change over time across window sizes (years be-
tween a pre and post period) and ranges (of pre and post periods compared by KLD)3. Across the window
sizes, the general trend remains relatively stable, with specific lemmas contributing to periods of change.
From around 1725 to 1745 lemmas related to the field of electricity are distinct (light blue: electricity,
electrify, wire). From the mid 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century a whole field arises
that marks the discovery of oxygen (orange) with air, nitrious, dephlogisticated, gas marking the begin-
ning of this research field driven by experiments and oxide, oxygen, hydrogen marking the terminology
building process around the new field. In fact, a landmark paper on the discovery of oxygen by Joseph
Priestley in 1774 entitled Observations on different kinds of air brought about a series of publications in
the Royal Society dedicated to this new strand of research. Towards the mid 19th century biology terms
arise (cell, corpuscule).

Tuning the period range allows us to inspect the data further (compare Figure 3 (c) and (d), 20-year
range vs. 10-year range, respectively). For example, a period of change related to the solar system
(purple: sun, venus, limb, parallax) is better captured with a smaller range (10 years, Figure 3 (d)). Thus,
while some periods of change are more persistent (e.g. the discovery of oxygen) and can thus be captured
by using wider ranges (e.g. 20 years), others (such as new observations on the solar system) are more
transient and therefore can be better detected by more narrow comparisons of ranges (e.g. 10 years).
Also detectable at the 10-year window (see Figure 3 (d)) are variants of use: oxygen vs. oxygene, where
the latter was distinctively used but only for a small period of time (from 1790-1820), while oxygen was
increasingly used over time and became the standard variant. Thus, this allows us to observe competing
forms or lexemes.

A further major change takes place around the end of the 18th century, where besides words related
to terminology as discussed so far, the function words the and of, reflecting the use of nominal phrases,
drastically increase their discriminative power for the post period as well as the verb be, which might
reflect here a relational use (such as e.g. X is Y).

These diachronic tendencies across the inspected time frame show how at the lexical level, specific
terms become typical of a time period marking strands of terminological evolution which can be at-
tributed to groundbreaking events in the world (such as the discovery of oxygen). The rise and fall in
discriminative power of function words seems to indicate changes in the use of grammatical structures.
To observe whether this is really the case and which grammatical structures are involved in change, we
inspect changes at the grammatical level by approximating grammatical structures with POS trigrams.

4.3 Grammatical structures contributing to periods of change

To inspect which POS trigrams have significantly contributed to changes over time, we again plot the
individual KLD value of each discriminative POS trigram on the time line (see Figure 4 showing the 5-
year window). A major change in the use of discriminative POS trigrams takes place between the 1740s
and 1760s. Here, nominal phrase patterns with prepositions (DT NN IN, NN TO DT), coordinating con-
junctions (NN CC NN) and possessives (IN NP POS) are discriminative. Both nominal phrase patterns
reflect a conventionalized usage of general nouns combined with the prepositions of and to (e.g. the end

Figure 3: Lemmas contributing to periods of change for different window sizes and period ranges.
The higher the KLD value the higher the pattern’s contribution to the overall KL divergence. The KLD values are based

on comparison between a post vs. pre period (D(post||pre)) to inspect change from past to present. Positive values reflect
distinctness for post, negative values distinctness for pre. Selection of 100 distinctive lemmas ranked by standard deviation

across time are displayed.

of, a letter from, the time of for the DT NN IN pattern; with regard/respect to for the IN NN TO pattern).
The possessive pattern reflects the peaks shown at the lexical level where the ’s and the lemmas related
to the solar system mark a period of change.

After this major period of change, from the 1750s onwards individual patterns become typical that
can be related to specific grammatical structures. First, a nominal compound pattern followed by a
preposition (NN NN IN) becomes typical around the 1750s (e.g. zenith distance of, logarithm sine of ),
which appears again as distinct after 1810 (e.g. knife edge of the pendulum) with a greater variation of
use (around 10 vs. 30 instances of at least 5 occurrences). Around the 1760s a comparative pattern arises
(VBZ JJR IN; with realizations such as is greater than, is less than, is more than).

At the same time a particularly interesting pattern reflecting relational or passive clauses (JJ NN VBZ)
is discriminative, used to define specific types of materials such as air, acid, fluid etc. (e.g. inflammable
air is pure phlogiston, dephlogisticated air is only water deprived of phlogiston) or to explain what these
materials are used for (e.g. nitrous air is mixed with, alkaline air is saturated by). This pattern is closely
related to the beginnings of early modern chemistry marked by the discovery of oxygen as shown at
the lexical level. A constant increase of KLD value of this relational pattern might also indicate an
increasing need for specification in this new research field (i.e. defining what it is exactly that has been
discovered). As the field around oxygen became established, one may think that also the need for this
specification pattern may no longer exist. However, in terms of frequency (see Figure 5) it rises steeply
from 1760 to 1780, has a period of stagnation between 1780 and 1830, rising again afterwards. Thus,
it rises considerably in frequency due to the need to elaborate on the findings of this new research field
around chemistry (rising period). This pattern then becomes established in scientific writing (stagnation
period). The decline in KLD confirms this tendency: the pattern is no longer discriminative for a post
vs. pre by 1790s, as it is similarly used in both pre and post slices.

The higher the KLD value the higher the pattern’s contribution to the overall KL divergence. The KLD values are based

on comparison between a post vs. pre period (D(post||pre)) to inspect change from past to present. Positive values reflect
distinctness for post, negative values distinctness for pre. Selection of 100 distinctive lemmas ranked by standard deviation

across time are displayed.

Starting around the 1780s longer noun phrases with a plural head (DT NNS IN) become discriminative
(such as the effects/observations/results of ) pointing to scientific outcomes. Around the 1790s and 1800s
the terminological pattern ‘noun of noun’ (NN IN NN) is typical (with realizations such as centre of
gravity, carbonate of lime, phosphate of lime, oxide of iron, sulphate of iron). If we compare this again
with the lexical level (see Figure 3), we can see how after specific terms were established, grammatical
structures arise around these terms. This terminological pattern is also reflected in the discriminative
power of the preposition of at the lexical level (see Figure 3). By considering the level of grammar
(approximated here with POS trigrams), we have a clearer picture of the changes that have occurred in
terms of grammatical structures.

Starting from the late 1780s, the discriminative power of the nominal pattern DT NN IN rises again,
this time not only marking conventionalized usage by particular expressions (such as the quantity of or
the number of ) but also terminological usage by terms establishing themselves in that period (such as the
center of gravity, the bulb of the thermometer, the temperature of the air).

At the beginning of the 19th century, there is again a rise of specific nominal patterns with prepositions
(NN IN DT, NN NN IN, IN DT JJ). The first two patterns (NN IN DT and NN NN IN) both reflect longer
nominal phrases related to terminology (e.g. length of the second pendulum, part of the nervous system,
knife edge of the pendulum). The IN DT JJ pattern instead marks a rise of functional expressions pointing
to contrast/comparison (e.g. at the same time, on the other hand) and elaboration (e.g. in the same way,
in the same manner).

Comparing our findings to previous accounts on the Proceedings and Transactions of the Royal Society
(PTRS), we are clearly in line a.o. with Halliday (1988) and Atkinson (1999), who showed a shift from
an involved to an informational style of writing between the 17th and 19th century based on a manual
and a multi-dimensional analysis, respectively, reflected in higher nominal style in the later productions.
In Degaetano-Ortlieb et al. (2018) we confirm this finding using a data-driven approach. In this paper, we
were able to show when particular nominal patterns reflecting informational style become distinctive in
comparison to earlier periods and how their use is intertwined with changes occurring at the lexical level.
In summary, the diachronic tendencies at the grammatical level, first, show a major period of change
around the 1750s marked by a strong contribution of patterns related to conventionalized style of writing

Figure 5: Frequency distribution of the JJ NN VBZ trigram

(of and to prepositional phrases, conjunctive and possessive phrases). Second, this period is followed by
rise of individual lexico-grammatical patterns over time due to needs driven by expansions at the lexical
level, on the one hand, and further lexical conventionalization of the patterns, on the other hand. Thus,
in comparison to previous work, we are able to detect when and possibly why particular patterns become
distinctive showing not only reflections of specialization in the formation of terminology but also of
conventionalization in particular lexically confined grammatical patterns.

5 Summary and outlook

We have presented a generic, data-driven approach based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for
detecting features involved in diachronic linguistic change and discerning periods of change without
pre-selection of features and periods. Our method is illustrated on the Royal Society Corpus, showing
which features are involved in change and observing periods of change in scientific writing. The features
detected indicate two types of change, lexical expansion and grammatical consolidation. Note here that
while the first type of change relates to low-frequency instances, it is a highly distinctive feature over
time — a fact that a traditional frequency-based approach would have missed.

What we can also see from our sample analysis is that changes proceed in waves — a wave of lexical
expansion is typically followed or partially paralleled by reduction in grammatical variation, thus indi-
cating the continuous effort to balance expressivity and communicative efficiency. In this way, rational
language users make sure that, while language use changes, communication remains successful. Lexis
and grammar thus show a nice symbiosis in enhancing expressivity and maintaining communicative
efficiency.

In a wider perspective, our research is a contribution to information-theoretic accounts of language
use with rational communication as an explanatory framework, adding to it a diachronic perspective (cf.
Hume and Mailhot (2013) for related work in phonology). In future work, we plan to look at register-
mixed language as a reflection of ‘general’ language and longer time ranges using the proposed method,
going over attested periods of evolution of the English language, starting from Early Modern English to
Late Modern English and contemporary English, in order to observe long-term, more persistent gram-
matical changes. For lexical development, we are currently exploring measures of vocabulary expansion
from a paradigmatic perspective on the basis of word embeddings, both for scientific as well as ‘gen-
eral’ language (cf. Hamilton et al. (2016), Fankhauser and Kupietz (2017a), and Fankhauser and Kupietz
(2017b) for related work).
