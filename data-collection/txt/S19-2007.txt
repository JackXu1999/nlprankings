Abstract

The paper describes the organization of the
SemEval 2019 Task 5 about the detection of
hate speech against immigrants and women in
Spanish and English messages extracted from
Twitter. The task is organized in two related
classification subtasks: a main binary subtask
for detecting the presence of hate speech, and
a finer-grained one devoted to identifying fur-
ther features in hateful contents such as the ag-
gressive attitude and the target harassed, to dis-
tinguish if the incitement is against an individ-
ual rather than a group. HatEval has been one
of the most popular tasks in SemEval-2019
with a total of 108 submitted runs for Subtask
A and 70 runs for Subtask B, from a total of 74
different teams. Data provided for the task are
described by showing how they have been col-
lected and annotated. Moreover, the paper pro-
vides an analysis and discussion about the par-
ticipant systems and the results they achieved
in both subtasks.

1 Introduction

Hate Speech (HS) is commonly defined as any
communication that disparages a person or a group
on the basis of some characteristic such as race,
color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nation-
ality, religion, or other characteristics (Nockleby,
2000). Given the huge amount of user-generated
contents on the Web, and in particular on social
media, the problem of detecting, and therefore
possibly contrasting the HS diffusion, is becom-
ing fundamental, for instance for fighting against
misogyny and xenophobia.
Some key aspects feature online HS, such as vi-
rality, or presumed anonymity, which distinguish
it from offline communication and make it po-
tentially also more dangerous and hurtful. Often

hate speech fosters discrimination against partic-
ular categories and undermines equality, an ever-
lasting issue for each civil society. Among the
mainly targeted categories there are immigrants
and women. For the first target, especially raised
by refugee crisis and political changes occurred in
the last few years, several governments and pol-
icy makers are currently trying to address it, mak-
ing especially interesting the development of tools
for the identification and monitoring such kind of
hate (Bosco et al., 2017). For the second one in-
stead, hate against the female gender is a long-time
and well-known form of discrimination (Manne,
2017). Both these forms of hate content impact
on the development of society and may be con-
fronted by developing tools that automatically de-
tect them.

A large number of academic events and shared
tasks for different languages (i.e. English, Span-
ish, Italian, German, Mexican-Spanish, Hindi)
took place in the very recent past which are cen-
tered on HS and related topics, thus reflecting the
interest by the NLP community. Let us men-
tion the first and second edition of the Workshop
on Abusive Language1 (Waseem et al., 2017), the
First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cy-
berbullying (Kumar et al., 2018), that also in-
cluded a shared task on aggression identification,
the tracks on Automatic Misogyny Identification
(AMI) (Fersini et al., 2018b) and on Authorship
and Aggressiveness Analysis (MEX-A3T) (Car-
mona et al., 2018) proposed at the 2018 edition of
IberEval2, the GermEval Shared Task on the Iden-
tification of Offensive Language (Wiegand et al.,

2018), and finally the Automatic Misogyny Identi-
fication task (AMI) (Fersini et al., 2018a) and the
Hate Speech Detection task (HaSpeeDe) (Bosco
et al., 2018) at EVALITA 20183 for investigating
respectively misogyny and HS in Italian.

HatEval consists in detecting hateful contents
in social media texts, specifically in Twitter’s
posts, against two targets: immigrants and women.
Moreover, the task implements a multilingual per-
spective where data for two widespread languages,
English and Spanish, are provided for training and
testing participant systems.
The motivations for organizing HatEval go beyond
the advancement of the state of the art for HS de-
tection for each of the involved languages and tar-
gets. The variety of targets of hate and languages
provides a unique comparative setting, both with
respect to the amount of data collected and an-
notated applying the same scheme, and with re-
spect to the results achieved by participants train-
ing their systems on those data. Such compara-
tive setting may help in shedding new light on the
linguistic and communication behaviour against
these targets, paving the way for the integration of
HS detection tools in several application contexts.
Moreover, the participation of a very large amount
of research groups in this task (see Section 4) has
improved the possibility of in-depth investigation
of the involved phenomena.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, the datasets released to the participants
for training and testing the systems are described.
Section 3 presents the two subtasks and the mea-
sures we exploited in the evaluation. Section 4 re-
ports on approaches and results of the participant
systems. In Section 5, a preliminary analysis of
common errors in top-ranked systems is proposed.
Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Data

The data have been collected using different gath-
ering strategies. For what concerns the time frame,
tweets have been mainly collected in the time
span from July to September 2018, with the ex-
ception of data with target women. Indeed, the
most part of the training set of tweets against
women has been derived from an earlier collection
carried out in the context of two previous chal-
lenges on misogyny identification (Fersini et al.,
2018a,b). Different approaches were employed

to collect tweets: (1) monitoring potential vic-
tims of hate accounts, (2) downloading the his-
tory of identified haters and (3) filtering Twitter
streams with keywords, i.e. words, hashtags and
stems. Regarding the keyword-driven approach,
we employed both neutral keywords (in line with
the collection strategy applied in Sanguinetti et al.
(2018)), derogatory words against the targets, and
highly polarized hashtags, in order to collect a cor-
pus for reflecting also on the subtle but important
differences between HS, offensiveness (Wiegand
et al., 2018) and stance (Taulé et al., 2017). The
keywords that occur more frequently in the col-
lected tweets are: migrant, refugee, #buildthat-
wall, bitch, hoe, women for English, and inmigra-,
arabe, sudaca, puta, callate, perra for Spanish4.

The entire HatEval dataset is composed of
19,600 tweets, 13,000 for English and 6,600 for
Spanish. They are distributed across the targets as
follows: 9,091 about immigrants and 10,509 about
women (see also Tables 1 for English and 2 for
Spanish). Figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of
the labels in the training and development set data
according to the different targets of hate (woman
and immigrants, respectively).

2.1 Annotation
The data are released after the annotation pro-
cess, which involved non-trained contributors on
the crowdsourcing platform Figure Eight (F8)5.
The annotation scheme applied to the HatEval data
is a simplified merge of schemes already applied
in the development of corpora for HS detection
and misogyny by the organizers (Fersini et al.,
2018a,b; Bosco et al., 2018), also in the context
of funded projects with focus on the tasks topics6

(Sanguinetti et al., 2018; Poletto et al., 2017). It
includes the following categories:

• HS - a binary value indicating if HS is occur-
ring against one of the given targets (women
or immigrants): 1 if occurs, 0 if not.

• Target Range - if HS occurs (i.e. the value
for the feature HS is 1), a binary value indi-
cating if the target is a generic group of peo-
ple (0) or a specific individual (1).

• Aggressiveness - if HS occurs (i.e. the value
for the feature HS is 1), a binary value in-
dicating if the tweeter is aggressive (1) or
not (0).

We gave the annotators a series of guidelines
in English and Spanish, including the definition
for hate speech against the two targets considered,
the aggressiveness’s definition and a list of ex-
amples7. As requested by the platform, we pro-
vided a restricted set of “correct” answers to test
the reliability of the annotators. We required to
collect at least three independent judgments for
each tweet. We adopted the default F8 settings
for assigning the majority label (relative major-
ity). The F8 reported average confidence (i.e., a
measure combining inter-rater agreement and re-
liability of the contributor) on the English dataset
for the fields HS, TR, AG is 0.83, 0.70 and 0.73
respectively, while for the Spanish dataset is 0.89,
0.47 and 0.47. The use of crowdsourcing has been
successfully already experimented in several tasks
and in HS detection too, both for English (David-
son et al., 2017) and other languages (Sanguinetti
et al., 2018). However, stimulated by the discus-
sion in (Basile et al., 2018), we decided to apply

ihateprejudice.html.
7Annotation guidelines provided are accessible here:

a similar methodology by adding two more expert
annotations to all the crowd-annotated data, pro-
vided by native or near-native speakers of British
English and Castilian Spanish, having a long ex-
perience in annotating data for the specific task’s
subject. We assigned the final label for this data
based on majority voting from crowd, expert1, and
expert2. This does not erase the contribution of the
crowd, but hopefully maximises consistency with
the guidelines in order to provide a solid evalua-
tion benchmark for this task.

For data release and distribution each post has
been identified by a newly generated index which
substitutes the original Twitter’s IDs.

2.2 Training, Development and Test Data

Data for training and development were released
according to the distribution described in Figures 1
and 2 across languages (Spanish and English) and
targets (women and immigrants). For what con-
cerns Spanish, the training and development set
includes 5,000 tweets, (3,209 for the target women
and 1,991 for immigrants), while for English it in-

cludes 10,000 tweets (5,000 for each target). For
a cross-language perspective see Figures 1 and 2.
It can be also observed that the distribution across
categories is pivoting around the main task cate-
gory, HS, while the other ones more freely vary.
Indeed, in order to provide a more balanced dis-
tribution of the HS and non-HS categories in the
dataset released for Subtask A, we altered the nat-
ural distribution: both in the training and test set,
hateful tweets are over-represented with respect to
the distribution observed in the data we collected
from Twitter8. Instead, the distribution of the other
categories which are relevant for Subtask B is not
constrained, and naturally follows from the selec-
tion of tweets for representing the classes relevant
for the main Subtask A.

As far as the test set is concerned, 3,000 tweets
have been annotated for English, half with target
women and half immigrants, and 1,600 for Span-
ish distributed with the same proportion across the
targets of hate: 1,260 hateful tweets and 1,740
non-hateful tweets for English, 660 hateful tweets
and 940 non-hateful tweets for Spanish.

According to the schema described above, the
format of an annotated tweet in the training and
development set has the following pattern:

ID, Tweet-text, HS, TR, AG

where ID is a progressive number denoting the
tweet within the dataset, Tweet-text is the given
text of the tweet, while the other parts of the pat-
tern, given in the training data and to be predicted
in the test set, are: Hate Speech [HS] (1 or 0), Tar-
get Range [TR] (0 for group or 1 for individual),
and Aggressiveness [AG] (0 or 1). Data included
in the test instead only include ID and Tweet-text,
the annotation of HS, TR and AG to be provided
by participants according to the subtask.
An example of annotation is the following:

7, lol, chop her head off and rape the bitch
https://t.co/ZB8CosmSD8, 1, 1, 1

which has been considered by the annotators as
hateful, against an individual target, and aggres-
sive. The latter category is not necessarily asso-
ciated to HS, as shown in the following exam-
ple, where a hateful content is expressed against
a generic group of people in terms of disrespect
and misogynistic stereotypes rather than using an
aggressive language:

8The whole original annotated dataset was very skewed
towards the non-HS class (only about 10% of the annotated
data contained hate speech).

11, WOW can’t believe all these women riding the
subway today? Shouldn’t these bitches be making

sandwiches LOL #ihatefemales.., 1, 0, 0

3 Task Description

The task is articulated around two related sub-
tasks. The first consists of a basic detection of
HS, where participants are asked to mark the pres-
ence of hateful content. In the second subtask in-
stead fine-grained features of hateful contents are
investigated in order to understand how existing
approaches may deal with the identification of es-
pecially dangerous forms of hate, i.e., those where
the incitement is against an individual rather than
against a group of people, and where an aggres-
sive behaviour of the author can be identified as a
prominent feature of the expression of hate. The
participants will be asked in this latter subtask to
identify if the target of hate is a single human or
a group of persons, and if the message author in-
tends to be aggressive, harmful, or even to incite,
in various forms, to violent acts against the target
(see e.g. (Sanguinetti et al., 2018)).

3.1 Subtask A - Hate Speech Detection
against immigrants and women

Subtask A is a two-class (or binary) classification
task where the system has to predict whether a
tweet in English or in Spanish with a given target
(women or immigrants) contains HS or not. The
following sentences present examples of a hate-
ful and non-hateful tweet where the targets are
women.

[hateful]

[id: 32411] Cállate @ vikidonda y la
gran puta madre que te repario. Que le
diste a la poltica...nada. Basura.
Shut up @ vikidonda you motherfucker. What

did you do for politics... nothing. Trash.9

[non-hateful]

[id: 33033] @ RyanAbe This is

inhumane Karma is a bitch she ll get
around these brainless heartless assholes!

9The target of the misogynistic hate here is Victoria
Donda Prez, an Argentinian woman, human rights activist
and member of the Argentine National Congress (mentioned
in the at-mention of the original tweet).

3.2 Subtask B - Aggressive behaviour and
Target Classification

Next, in Subtask B systems are asked to classify
hateful tweets (e.g., tweets where HS against our
targets has been identified) regarding both aggres-
sive attitude and the target harassed. On one hand,
the kind of target must be classified, and the task
is binary:

• Individual: the text includes hateful mes-
sages purposely sent to a specific target.

• Generic: it refers to hateful messages posted
to many potential receivers.

[Individual]:

[id: 4723] @ saima55016154 Come on
box I show you my cock darling

[Generic]:

[id: 5823] Women are equal and deserve
respect. Just kidding, they should suck my
dick.

On the other hand, the aggressive behaviour has
to be identified, then we propose a two-class clas-
sification task also for this feature. A tweet must
be classified as aggressive or not:

[Aggressive]

[id:1890] Sick barstewards! This is what
happens when we put up the refugees
welcome signs! They not only rape our
wives or girlfriends, our daughters but our
ruddy mothers too!! https://t.co/XAYLr6FjNk

[Non-Aggressive]

[id: 945] @EmmanuelMacron Hello??
Stop groping my nation.Schneider: current
migrant crisis represents a plan
orchestrated and prepared for a long time
by international powers to radically alter
Christian and national identity of European
peoples.http

3.3 Evaluation Measures and Baseline
The evaluation of the results considers different
strategies and metrics for Subtasks A and B in or-
der to allow more fine-grained scores.

Subtask A. Systems will be evaluated using
standard evaluation metrics, including Accuracy,
Precision, Recall and macro-averaged F1-score.

In order to provide a measure that is indepen-
dent on the class size, the submissions will be
ranked by macro-averaged F1-score, computed as
described in (Özgür et al., 2005). The metrics will
be computed as follows:

Accuracy =
number of correctly predicted instances

total number of instances
(1)

Precision =
number of correctly predicted instances

number of predicted labels
(2)

Recall =
number of correctly predicted labels
number labels in the gold standard

(3)

F1-score =
2× Precision×Recall
Precision+Recall

(4)

Subtask B. The evaluation of systems partici-
pating to Subtask B will be based on two crite-
ria: (1) partial match and (2) exact match. Re-
garding the partial match, each dimension to be
predicted (HS , TR and AG) will be evaluated in-
dependently from the others using standard evalu-
ation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall
and macro-averaged F1-score. We will report to
the participants all the measures and a summary of
the performance in terms of macro-averaged F1-
score, computed as follows:

F1-score =
F1(HS) + F1(AG) + F1(TR)

3
(5)

Concerning the exact match, all the dimen-
sions to be predicted will be jointly considered
computing the Exact Match Ratio (Kazawa et al.,
2005). Given the multi-label dataset consisting of
n multi-label samples (xi, Yi), where xi denotes
the i-th instance and Yi represents the correspond-
ing set of labels to be predicted (HS ∈ {0, 1},
TR ∈ {0, 1} and AG ∈ {0, 1}), the Exact Match
Ratio (EMR) will be computed as follows:

EMR =
1

n

n∑
i=1

I(Yi, Zi) (6)

where Zi denotes the set of labels predicted for
the i-th instance and I is the indicator function.
The submissions will be ranked by EMR. This
choice is motivated by the willingness to capture
the difficulty of modeling the entire phenomenon,
and therefore to identify the most dangerous
behaviours against the targets.

Baselines. In order to provide a benchmark
for the comparison of the submitted systems, we



59

considered two different baselines. The first one
(MFC baseline) is a trivial model that assigns the
most frequent label, estimated on the training set,
to all the instances in the test set. The second one
(SVC baseline) is a linear Support Vector Machine
(SVM) based on a TF-IDF representation, where
the hyper-parameters are the default values set by
the scikit-learn Python library (Pedregosa et al.,
2011).

4 Participant Systems and Results

HatEval has been one of the most popular tasks
in SemEval-2019 with a total of 108 submitted
runs for Subtask A and 70 runs for Subtask B. We
received submission from 74 different teams, of
which 22 teams participated to all the subtasks for
the two languages10.

Besides traditional Machine Learning ap-
proaches, it has been observed that more than
half of the participants investigated Deep Learning
models. In particular, most of the systems adopted
models known to be particularly suitable for deal-
ing with texts, from Recurrent Neural Networks to
recently proposed language models (Sabour et al.,
2017; Cer et al., 2018). Consequently, external
resources such as pre-trained Word Embeddings
on tweets have been widely adopted as input fea-
tures. Only a few works deepen the linguistic fea-
tures analysis, probably due to the high expec-
tations on the ability of Deep Learning models
to extract high-level features. Most of the sub-
mitted systems adopted traditional preprocessing
techniques, such as tokenization, lowercase, stop-
words, URLs and punctuation removal. Some par-
ticipants investigated Twitter-driven preprocessing
procedures such as hashtag segmentation, slang
conversion in correct English and emoji transla-
tion into words. It is worth mentioning that the
construction of customized hate lexicons derived
by the detection of language patterns in the train-
ing set has been preferred to the use of external
hate lexicons expressing a more universal knowl-
edge about the hate speech phenomenon, addition-
ally demonstrating the need of developing more
advanced approaches for detecting hate speech to-
wards women and immigrants.

4.1 Subtask A - Hate Speech Detection
against immigrants and women

We received 69 submissions to the English Sub-
task A, of which 49% and 96% outperformed the
SVC and MFC baseline respectively, in terms of
macro-averaged F1-score. Among the five best
performing teams, only the team of Panaetius,
which obtained the second position (0.571), has
not provided a description of their system. The
higher macro-averaged F1-score (0.651) has been
obtained by the Fermi team. They trained a
SVM model with RBF kernel only on the pro-
vided data, exploiting sentence embeddings from
Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al.,
2018) as features. Both the third, fourth and fifth
ranked teams employ Neural Network models and,
more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory networks
(LSTMs). In particular, the third position has been
obtained by the YNU DYX team, which system
achieved 0.535 macro-averaged F1-score by train-
ing a stacked Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units
(BiGRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) exploiting fastText
word embeddings (Joulin et al., 2017). Then, the
output of BiGRU is fed as input to the capsule
network (Sabour et al., 2017). The textual pre-
processing has been conducted with standard pro-
cedures, e.g. punctuation removal, tokenization,
contraction normalization, use of tags for hyper-
links, numbers and mentions. The fourth place
has been achieved by the team of alonzorz (0.535),
which used a novel type of CNN called Multi-
ple Choice CNN on the top of contextual embed-
dings. These embeddings have been created with
a model similar to Bidirectional Encoder Rep-
resentations from Transformers (BERT) (Devlin
et al., 2018) trained using 50 million unique tweets
from the Twitter Firehose dataset. The SINAI-
DL team ranked fifth with a F1-score of 0.519.
They employ a LSTM model based on the pre-
trained GloVe Word Embeddings from Stanford-
NLP group (Pennington et al., 2014). Since Deep
Learning models require a large amount of data for
training, they perform data augmentation through
the use of paraphrasing tools. For preprocessing
the texts in the specific Twitter domain, they con-
vert all the mentions to a common tag and they
tokenized hashtags according to the Camel Case
procedure, i.e. the practice of writing phrases such
that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the
phrase begins with a capital letter, with no inter-

vening spaces or punctuation.

For Subtask A in Spanish, we received 39 sub-
missions of which 51% and 100% outperformed
the SVC and MFC baseline respectively, in terms
of macro-averaged F1-score. The Atalaya and
MineriaUNAM teams obtained the best macro-
averaged F1-score of 0.73, both taking advan-
tage of Support Vector Machines. The Atalaya
team studied several sophisticated systems, how-
ever the best performances have been obtained by
a linear-kernel SVM trained on a text representa-
tion composed of bag-of-words, bag-of-characters
and tweet embeddings, computed from fastText
sentiment-oriented word vectors. The system pro-
posed by the MineriaUNAM team is based on a
linear-kernel SVM. The study has focused on a
combinatorial framework used to search for the
best feature configuration among a combination
of linguistic patterns features, a lexicon of aggres-
sive words and different types of n-grams (char-
acters, words, POS tags, aggressive words, word
jumps, function words and punctuation symbols).
The MITRE team has achieved the performance of
0.729, presenting a novel method for adapting pre-
trained BERT models to Twitter data using a cor-
pus of tweets collected during the same time pe-
riod of the HatEval training dataset. The CIC-2
team achieved 0.727 with a word-based represen-
tation by combining Logistic Regression, Multi-
nomial Naı̈ve Bayes, Classifiers Chain and Major-
ity Voting. They used TF and TF/IDF after remov-
ing HTML tags, punctuation marks and special
characters, converting slang and short forms into
correct English words and stemming. The partic-
ipants did not use external resources and trained
their systems only with the provided data. Finally,
the GSI-UPM team obtained the macro-averaged
F1-score of 0.725 with a system where the linear-
kernel SVM has been trained on an automated se-
lection of linguistic and semantic features, senti-
ment indicators, word embeddings, topic model-
ing features, and word and character TF-IDF n-
grams.

for Subtasks A and B, with respect to the rela-
tive performance measures. The statistics com-
prise mean, standard deviation (StdDev), mini-
mum, maximum, median and the first and third
quartiles (Q1 and Q3). Concerning Subtask A,
we notice that the maximum value in Spanish
(0.7300) is higher than the English one (0.6510),

while the difference is even higher (23 points)
when considering the mean value, from 0.6821
to 0.4484. On the other hand, the variability is
very similar between English (0.0569) and Span-
ish (0.0521).

4.2 Subtask B - Aggressive behaviour and
Target Classification

For Subtask B in English, we received 39 submis-
sions, of which no system has been able to out-
perform the MFC baseline, which achieved 0.580
of EMR, while 61% outperformed the SVC base-
line. Among the five best performing teams, only
the team of scmhl5, which obtained the third posi-
tion (0.483), has not provided us with a description
of the system. The higher EMR result has been
obtained by the LT3 team with a value of 0.570.
They considered a supervised classification-based
approach with SVM models which combines a va-
riety of standard lexical and syntactic features with
specific features for capturing offensive language
exploiting external lexicons. The second position
has been obtained by the CIC-1 team. The team
achieved 0.568 in EMR with Logistic Regression
and Classifier Chains. They trained their model
only with the provided data, with a word-based
representation and without external resources. The
only preprocessing action was stemming and stop
words removal. The fourth position was obtained
by the team named The Titans. They achieved
0.471 of EMR with LSTM and TF/IDF-based
Multilayer Perceptron. To represent the docu-
ments, they used the tweet words after removing
links, mentions and spaces. They also tokenized
hashtags into word tokens. The MITRE team ex-
ploits the same approach used for participating in
Subtask A, obtaining 0.399 EMR. It is worth men-



61

tioning that, despite the fact that the baseline could
not be overcome in terms of EMR, the five first
performing systems obtained higher F-values. For
example, while the baseline obtained 0.421, the
scmhl5 (0.632) and the MITRE team (0.614) sys-
tems obtained about 20 points over it.

For Subtask B in Spanish, we received 23 sub-
missions of which 52% and 70% outperformed the
SVC and MFC baseline respectively, in terms of
EMR. The first position has been achieved by the
CIC-2 team with 0.705 in terms of EMR, propos-
ing the same approach for Subtask A in Span-
ish. The CIC-1 and MITRE teams, described pre-
viously, achieved the second and third positions
with 0.675 and 0.675 in EMR respectively. The
fourth position was obtained by the Atalaya team
that achieved 0.657 EMR by extending the pre-
viously presented approach for Subtask A to a
5-way classification problem for all the possible
label combinations. Finally, the team of Oscar-
Garibo achieved the fifth position (0.6444) with
Support Vector Machines and statistical embed-
dings to represent the texts. The proposed method,
a variation of LDSE (Rangel et al., 2016), consists
of finding thresholds on the frequencies of use of
the different terms in the corpora depending on the
class they belong to. In this subtask, the correla-
tion between EMR and macro-averaged F1-score
is more homogeneous than in English. However,
it is worth mentioning the case of the CIC-1 team
since its macro-averaged F1-score decreases with
respect to the EMR and is 10 points lower than the
rest of the best five performing teams.

The comparative results between all the per-
forming teams in the two languages show inter-
esting insights (see Table 3). Firstly, the best re-
sult is much higher in the case of Spanish (0.7050)
than in English (0.5700) in more than 13 points.
In the case of the fifth best results, the differ-
ence is much higher (0.2454), from 0.3990 in En-
glish to 0.6440 in Spanish. The average value
changes from 0.3223 in English to 0.6013 in Span-
ish, with a difference of 28 points. The variability
is also higher in English (0.0890) with respect to
the value in Spanish (0.0662).

We can also derive further conclusions by com-
paring the statistics of the two Subtasks. Looking
at the median, it is possible to notice that in both
languages, the performances obtained on Subtask
B are lower than the performances of Subtask A,
with a difference between Subtask A and B of 14

and 8 points for English and Spanish respectively.
This suggests that participant systems found much
harder to predict the aggressiveness and targets
than just the presence of hate speech. The quartile
Q1 has highlighted that for the English language
75% of the systems obtained a score higher than
0.41 and 0.28 for Subtasks A and B, in particular
50 out of 69 for Subtask A and 31 out of 41 for
Subtask B. While Q3 shows that 25% of the sys-
tems achieved a score value higher than 0.49 and
0.36 for Subtasks A and B, in particular 18 out of
69 for Subtask A and 11 out of 41 for Subtask B.
For the Spanish language, the value of Q1 indi-
cates that 75% of the systems have a score higher
than 0.67 and 0.58 for Subtasks A and B, in par-
ticular 30 out of 39 for Subtask A and 17 out of 23
for Subtask B. Observing the quartile Q3, it is pos-
sible to observe that 25% of the systems achieved
a value higher than 0.72 and 0.64 for Subtasks A
and B, in particular 10 out of 39 for Subtask A and
6 out of 23 for Subtask B. Moreover, it is worth
mentioning that the smaller the standard deviation
the closer are the data to the mean value, highlight-
ing that the Subtask B has shown high variability
in terms of results than Subtask A. This statistics
remarks again the difficulties of addressing Sub-
task B compared to Subtask A.

5 Error Analysis

In order to gain deeper insight into the results of
the HatEval evaluation, we conducted a first error
analysis experiment. For both languages, we se-
lected the three top-ranked systems and checked
the instances in the test set that were wrongly la-
beled by all three of them.

In the English Subtask A, the three top systems
(Fermi, Panaetius, and YNU DYX) predicted the
same wrong labels 569 times out of 2,971 (19.1%).
In the Spanish Subtask A, the three top systems
(Atalaya, mineriaUNAM, and MITRE) predicted
the same wrong labels 234 times out of 1,600
(14.6%). The results showing the percentages by
wrongly assigned labels are summarized in Ta-
ble 4.

Subtask Errors Predicted 1 Predicted 0
EN A 569 507 (89.1%) 62 (10.9%)
ES A 234 178 (76.1%) 56 (23.9%)

Table 4: Number of instances mislabeled by all the
three top-ranked systems, broken down by wrongly as-
signed label.



62

The common errors are highly skewed towards
the false positives. However, the unbalance is
stronger for English (89.1% false positives) than
for Spanish (76% false positives).

Two English examples, respectively a false pos-
itive and a false negative, are:

[id: 30249] My mom FaceTimed me to
show off new shoes she got and was like “no
cabe duda que soy una Bitch” i love her

[id: 30542] @ JohnnyMalc

@ OMGTheMess There are NO IN-
NOCENT people in detention centres
#SendThemBack

The false positive contains a swear word (“Bitch”)
used in a humorous, not offensive context, which
is a potential source of confusion for a classifier.
The false negative is a hateful message towards
migrants, but phrased in a slightly convoluted way,
in particular due to the use of negation (“no inno-
cent people”).

Similarly, a false positive and a false negative in
Spanish:

[id: 33119] Soy un sudaca haciendo su-
dokus https://t.co/vA7nQsfm85
I am a sudaca doing sudokus

[id: 34455] Estoy escuchando una puta
canción y la pelotuda de Demi Lovato se
pone a hablar en el medio. CANTÁ Y
CALLATE LA BOCA.
I am listening to a fucking song and that asshole

Demi Lovato starts talking in the middle of it.

SING AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

Like in the English example, in this false positive
a negative word (“sudaca”) is used humorously,
for the purpose of a wordplay. In the false neg-
ative, there a misogynistic message is expressed,
although covertly, implying that the target should
“shut up and sing”.

6 Conclusion

The very high number of participating teams at
HatEval 2019 confirms the growing interest of the
community around abusive language in social me-
dia and hate speech detection in particular. The
presence of this task at SemEval 2019 was in-
deed very timely and the multilingual perspec-
tive we applied by developing data in two dif-
ferent widespread languages, English and Span-
ish, contributed to include and raise interest in

a wider community of scholars. 38 teams sent
their system reports to describe the approaches and
the details of their participation to the task, con-
tributing in shedding light on this difficult task.
Some of the HatEval participants also participated
to the OffensEval11, another task related to abu-
sive language identification, but with an accent on
the different notion of offensiveness, an orthogo-
nal notion that can characterize also expressions
that cannot be featured as hate speech12. Overall,
results confirm that hate speech detection against
women and immigrants in micro-blogging texts is
challenging, with a large room for improvement.
We hope that the dataset made available as part of
the shared task will foster further research on this
topic, including its multilingual perspective.
