1 Abstract of invited talk

Many events have a positive or negative impact on
our lives (e.g., “I bought a house” is typically good
news, but ”My house burned down” is bad news).
Recognizing events that have affective polarity is
essential for narrative text understanding, conver-
sational dialogue, and applications such as sum-
marization and sarcasm detection. We will discuss
our recent work on identifying affective events and
categorizing them based on the underlying reasons
for their affective polarity. First, we will describe
a weakly supervised learning method to induce
a large set of affective events from a text corpus
by optimizing for semantic consistency. Second,
we will present models to classify affective events
based on Human Need Categories, which often ex-
plain people’s motivations and desires. Our best
results use a co-training model that consists of
event expression and event context classifiers and
exploits both labeled and unlabeled texts. We will
conclude with a discussion of interesting direc-
tions for future work in this area.
