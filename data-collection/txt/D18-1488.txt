Abstract

Causal understanding is essential for many
kinds of decision-making, but causal inference
from observational data has typically only
been applied to structured, low-dimensional
datasets. While text classifiers produce
low-dimensional outputs, their use in causal
inference has not previously been studied.
To facilitate causal analyses based on
language data, we consider the role that text
classifiers can play in causal inference through
established modeling mechanisms from the
causality literature on missing data and
measurement error. We demonstrate how to
conduct causal analyses using text classifiers
on simulated and Yelp data, and discuss the
opportunities and challenges of future work
that uses text data in causal inference.

1 Introduction

Most scientific analyses, in domains from
economics to medicine, focus on low-dimensional
structured data. Many such domains also
have unstructured text data; advances in natural
language processing (NLP) have led to an
increased interest in incorporating language data
into scientific analyses. While language is
inherently unstructured and high dimensional,
NLP systems can be used to process raw text
to produce structured variables. For example,
work on identifying undiagnosed side effects
from electronic health records (EHR) uses text
classifiers to produce clinical variables from the
raw text (Hazlehurst et al., 2009).

NLP tools may also benefit the study of
causal inference, which seeks to identify causal
relations from observational data. Causal
analyses traditionally use low-dimensional
structured variables, such as clinical markers and
binary health outcomes. Such analyses require
assumptions about the data-generating process,

which are often simpler with low-dimensional
data. Unlike prediction tasks which are validated
by held-out test sets, causal inference involves
modeling counterfactual random variables
(Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1976) that represent
the outcome of some hypothetical intervention.
To rigorously reason about hypotheticals, we
use causal models to link our counterfactuals to
observed data (Pearl, 2009).

NLP provides a natural way to incorporate text
data into causal inference models. We can produce
low-dimensional variables using, for example,
text classifiers, and then run our causal analysis.
However, this straightforward integration belies
several potential issues. Text classification is not
perfect, and errors in a NLP algorithm may bias
subsequent analyses. Causal inference requires
understanding how variables influence one another
and how correlations are confounded by common
causes. Classic methods such as stratification
provide a means for handling confounding of
categorical or continuous variables, but it is not
immediately obvious how such work can be
extended to high-dimensional data.

Recent work has approached high-dimensional
domains by using random forests (Wager and
Athey, 2017) and other methods borrowed from
machine learning (Chernozhukov et al., 2016).
But even compared to an analysis that requires
hundreds of confounders (Belloni et al., 2014),
NLP models with millions of variables are
very high-dimensional. While physiological
symptoms reflect complex biological realities,
many symptoms such as blood pressure are
one-dimensional variables. While doctors can
easily quantify the effect of high blood pressure
on some outcome, can we use the “positivity” of a
restaurant review to estimate a causal effect? More
broadly, is it possible to employ text classification
methods in a causal analysis?



4587

We explore methods for the integration of
text classifiers into causal inference analyses that
consider confounds introduced by imperfect NLP.
We show what assumptions are necessary for
causal analyses using text, and discuss when
those assumptions may or may not be reasonable.
We draw on the causal inference literature to
consider two modeling aspects: missing data
and measurement error. In the missing data
formulation, a variable of interest is sometimes
unobserved, and text data gives us a means
to model the missingness process. In the
measurement error formulation, we use a text
classifier to generate a noisy proxy of the
underlying variable.

We highlight practical considerations of a
causal analysis with text data by conducting
analyses with simulated and Yelp data. We
examine the results of both formulations and show
how a causal analysis which properly accounts for
possible sources of bias produces better estimates
than naı̈ve methods which make unjustified
assumptions. We conclude by examining how our
approach may enable new research avenues for
inferring causality with text data.

2 Causal Inference, Briefly

While randomized control trials (RCT) are the
gold standard of determining causal effects of
treatments on outcomes, they can be expensive or
impossible in many settings. In contrast, the world
is filled with observational data collected without
randomization. While most studies simply report
correlations from observational data, the field of
causal inference examines what assumptions and
analyses make it possible to identify causal effects.

We formalize a causal statement like “smoking
causes cancer” as “if we were to conduct a RCT
and assign smoking as a treatment, we would
see a higher incidence of cancer among those
assigned smoking than among the control group.”
In the framework of Pearl (1995), we consider
a counterfactual variable of interest: what would
have been the cancer incidence among smokers
if smoking had been randomized? Specifically,
we consider a causal effect as the counterfactual
outcome of a hypothetical intervention on some
treatment variable. If we denote smoking as
our treatment variable A and cancer as our
outcome variable Y , then we are interested in the
counterfactual distribution, denoted p(Y (a)) or

p(Y | do(a)). We interpret this as “the distribution
over Y had A been set, possibly contrary to fact,
to value a.” For a binary treatment A, the causal
effect of A on Y is denoted τ = E[Y (1)] −
E[Y (0)]; the average difference between if you
had received the treatment and if you had not.
Throughout, we use causal directed acyclic graphs
(DAG), which assumes that an intervention on
A is well-defined and results in a counterfactual
variable Y (a) (Pearl, 1995; Dawid, 2010).

Figure 1a shows an example of simple
confounding. This is the simplest DAG in
which counterfactual distribution p(Y (a)) is not
simply p(Y | A), as C influences both
the treatment A and the outcome Y . To
recover the counterfactual distribution p(Y (a))
that would follow an intervention uponA, we must
“adjust” for C, applying the so-called “back-door
criterion” (Pearl, 1995). We can then derive the
counterfactual distribution p(Y (a)) and desired
causal effect, τS as a function of the observed
data, (Fig. 4 Eq. 1.) This derivation is shown
in Appendix A.

Note that p(Y (a)) and τS require data on
C, and if C is not in fact observed, it is
impossible to recover the causal effect. Formally,
we say that p(Y (a)) is not identified in the
model, meaning there is no function f such that
p(Y (a))=f(p(A, Y )). Identifiability is a primary
concern of causal inference (Shpitser and Pearl,
2008).

Throughout, we assume for simplicity that A,
C, and Y are binary variables. While text
classifiers can convert high-dimensional data into
binary variables for such analyses, we need to
make further assumptions about how classification
errors affect causal inferences. We cannot assume
that the output of a text classifier can be treated as
if it were ground truth. To conceptualize the ways
in which a text classifier may be biased, we will
consider them as a way to recover from missing
data or measurement error.

3 Causal Models

Real-world observational data is messy and often
imperfectly collected. Work in causal inference
has studied how analyses can be made robust
to missing data or data recorded with systematic
measurement errors.

3.1 Missing Data

Our dataset has “missing data” if it contains
individuals (instances) for which some variables
are unobserved, even though these variables are
typically available. This may occur if some
survey respondents choose not to answer certain
questions, or if certain variables are difficult to
collect and thus infrequently recorded. Missing
data is closely related to causal inference – both
are interested in hypothetical distributions that
we cannot directly observe (Robins et al., 2000;
Shpitser et al., 2015).

Consider a causal model where A is sometimes
missing (Figure 1b). The variable RA is a binary
indicator for whether A is observed (RA = 1)
or missing. The variable A(RA = 1), written
as A(1), represents the counterfactual value of A
were it never missing. Finally, A is the observed
proxy for A(1): it has the same value as A(1) if
RA = 1, and the special value “?” if RA = 0.

Solving missingness can seen as intervening to
set RA to 1. Given p(A,RA, C, Y ), we want to
recover p(A(1), C, Y ). We may need to make a
“Missing at Random” (MAR) assumption, which
says that the missingness process is independent of
the true missing values, conditional on observed
values. Figure 1b reflects the MAR assumption;
RA is independent of A(1) given fully-observed
C and Y . If an edge existed from A(1) to RA,
we have “Missing Not at Random” (MNAR) and
would not be identified except in special cases
(Shpitser et al., 2015).

3.2 Measurement Error

Sometimes a necessary variable is never observed,
but is instead proxied by a variable which differs
from the truth by some error. Consider the
example of body mass index (BMI) as a proxy for
obesity in a clinical study. Obesity is a known
risk factor for many health outcomes, but has a
complex clinical definition and is nontrivial to
measure. BMI is a simple deterministic function
of height and weight. To conduct a causal analysis
of obesity on cancer when only BMI and cancer
are measured, we can proceed as if we had
measured obesity and then correct our analysis
for the known error that comes from using BMI
as a proxy for obesity (Hernán and Cole, 2009;
Michels et al., 1998).

To generalize this concept, we can replace
obesity with our ground truth variable A
and replace BMI with a noisy proxy A∗.
Figure 1c gives the DAG for this model.
Unlike missing data problems, there is no
hypothetical intervention which recovers the
true data distribution p(A,C, Y ). Instead, we
manipulate the observed distribution p(A∗, C, Y )
with the known relationship p(A∗, A) to recover
the desired p(A,C, Y ).

Unlike missing data, measurement error
conceptualization can be used even when we
never observe A (e.g. the table in Figure 2c)
as long as we have knowledge about the error
mechanism p(A∗, A). Using this knowledge,
we can correct for the error using ‘matrix

adjustment’ (Pearl, 2010). In practice we might
learn p(A∗, A) from data such as that found in
Figure 2d. Recent work has also considered
how multiple independent proxies of A could
allow identification without any data on p(A∗, A)
(Kuroki and Pearl, 2014).

4 Causal Models for Text Data

We can use conceptualizations for missing data
and measurement error to support causal analyses
with text data. The choice of model depends on the
assumptions we make about the data-generation
process.

We add new variables to our models (Figure
1a) to represent text, which produces the
data-generating distribution shown in Figure 3a.
This model assumes that the underlying A, C, and
Y variables are generated before the text variables;
we use text to recover the true relationship
between A and Y .

We represent text as an arbitrary set of V
variables, which are independent of one another

given the non-text variables. In our implemented
analyses we will represent text as a bag-of-words,
wherein each Ti is simply the binary indicator of
the presence of the i-th word in our vocabulary of
V words, and T = ∪iTi. The restriction to simple
text models allows us to explore connections to
causal inference applications, though future work
could relax assumptions of the text models to be
inclusive of more sophisticated text models (e.g.
neural sequence models (Lai et al., 2015; Zhang
et al., 2015)), or consider causal relationships
between two text variables.

To motivate our explanations, consider the task
of predicting an individuals’ smoking status from
free-text hospital discharge notes (Uzuner et al.,
2008; Wicentowski and Sydes, 2008). Some
hospitals do not explicitly record patient smoking
status as structured data, making it difficult to use
such data in a study on the outcomes of smoking.
We will suppose that we are given a dataset with
patient data on lung cancer outcome (Y ) and age
(C), that our data on smoking status (A) is affected



4590

by either missing data or measurement error, but
that we have text data (T) from discharge records
that will allow us to infer smoking status with
reasonable accuracy.

4.1 Missing Data

To show how we might use text data to recover
from missing data, we introduce missingness for
A from Figure 3a to get the model in Figure 3b.
The missing arrow from A(1) to RA encodes the
MAR assumption, which is sufficient to make it
possible to identify the full data distribution from
the observed data.

Suppose our motivation is to estimate the causal
effect of smoking status (A) on lung cancer (Y )
adjusting for age (C). Imagine that missing
data arises because hospitals sometimes – but not
always – delete explicit data on smoking status
from patient records. If we have access to patients’
discharge notes (T) and know whether a given
patient had smoking status recorded (RA), then the
DAG in Figure 3b may be a reasonable model for
our setting. Note that we must again assume that
A does not directly affect RA.

The causal effect of A on Y in Figure 3b is
identified as τMD, given in Eq. 2 in Figure 4. The
derivation is given in Appendix B.

4.2 Measurement Error

We model text data with measurement error by
introducing a proxy A∗ to the model in Figure
3c. We assume that the proxied value of A∗ can
depend upon all other variables, and that we will
be able to estimate p(A∗, A) given an external
dataset, e.g. text classifier accuracy on held-out
data.

Suppose we again want to estimate the causal
effect from §4.1, but this time none of our hospital
records contain explicit data on smoking status.
However, imagine that we have a separate training
dataset of medical discharge records annotated
by expert pulmonologists for patients’ smoking
status. We could then train a classifier to predict
smoking status using discharge record text1.

Working from the derivation for matrix
adjustment in binary models given by Pearl
(2010), we identify the causal effect of A on
Y (Figure 3c) as τME (Eq 3 in Figure 4.) The
derivation is in Appendix C.

1This is the precise setting of Uzuner et al. (2008).

5 Experiments

We now empirically evaluate the effectiveness
of our two conceptualizations (missing data and
measurement error) for including text data in
causal analyses. We induce missingness or
mismeasurement of the treatment variable and use
text data to recover the true causal relationship
of that treatment on the outcome. We begin
with a simulation study with synthetic text data,
and then conduct an analysis using reviews from
yelp.com.

5.1 Synthetic Data

We select synthetic data so that we can control
the entire data-generation process. For each
data row, we first sample data on three binary
variables (A, C, Y ) and then sample V different
binary variables Ti representing a V -vocabulary
bag-of-words. A graphical model for this
distribution appears in Figure 3a. We augment
this distribution to introduce either missing
data (Figure 3b) or measurement error (Figure
3c.) For measurement error, we sample two
datasets. A small training set which gives data on
p(A,C, Y,T) and a large test set which gives data
on p(C, Y,T).

The full data generating process appears in
Appendix D, and the implementation (along with
all our code) is provided online2.

5.2 Yelp Data

We utilize the 2015 Yelp Dataset Challenge3

which provides 4.7M reviews of local businesses.
Each review contains a one- to five-star rating, up
to 5,000 characters of text. Yelp users can flag
reviews as “Useful” as a mark of quality.

We extract treatment, outcome, and confounder
variables from the structured data. The treatment
is a binarized user rating that takes value 1 if
the review has four or five stars and value 0
if the review has one or two stars. Three-star
reviews are discarded from our analysis. The
outcome is whether the review received at least
one “Useful” flag. The confounder is whether
the review’s author has received at least two
“Useful” flags across all reviews, according to
their user object. In our data, 74.2% of reviews
were positive, 42.6% of reviews were flagged as
“Useful,” and 56.7% users had received at least

2github.com/zachwooddoughty/emnlp2018-causal
3yelp.com/dataset/challenge



4591

two such flags. We preprocess the text of each
review by lowercasing, stemming, and removing
stopwords, before converting to a bag-of-words
representation with the 4,334 word vocabulary of
all words which appeared at least 1000 times in a
sample of 1M reviews.

Based on this p(A,C, Y,T) distribution,
we assume the data-generating process that
matches Figure 3a and introduce missingness
and mismeasurement as before, giving us
data-generating processes matching Figures 3b
and 3c.

Our intention is not to argue about a true
real-world causal effect of Yelp reviews on peer
behavior: we do not believe that our confounder
is the only common cause of the author’s rating
and the platform’s response. We leave for future
work a case study that jointly addresses questions
of identifiability and estimation of a real-world
causal effect. In this work, our experiments
focus on a simpler task: can a correctly-specified
model that uses text data effectively estimate a
causal effect in the presence of missing data or
measurement error.

5.3 Models

We now introduce several baseline methods
which, unlike our correctly specified models τMD
and τME , are not consistent estimators of our
desired causal effect. We would expect that the
theoretical bias in these estimators would result in
poor performance in our experiments.

5.3.1 Baseline: Naı̈ve Model
In both the missing data and measurement error
settings, our models use some rows that are full
observed. In missing data, these are rows where
RA = 1; in measurement error, the training set is
sampled from the true distribution. The simplest
approach to handling imperfect data is to throw
away all rows without full data, and calculate Eq
1 from that data. In Figure 5, these are labeled as
*.naive.

5.3.2 Baseline: Textless Model
In Figure 3b, if we do not condition on Ti to
d-separate A(1) from its missingness indicator,
that influence may bias our estimate. While we
know that ignoring text may introduce asymptotic
bias into our estimates of the causal effect, we
empirically evaluate how much bias is produced
by this “Textless” model compared to a correct

model. This is labeled as *.no text in Figure
5 (a).

In principle, we could conduct a measurement
error analysis using a model that does not include
text. In practice, we found we could not imputeA∗

from C and Y alone. The non-textual classifier
had such high error that the adjustment matrix
was singular and we could not compute the
effect. Thus, we have no such baseline in our
measurement error results.

5.3.3 Baseline: no y and unadjusted
Models

In Figure 3b, we must also condition on C and Y
to d-separate A(1) from its missingness indicator.
In our misspecified model for missing data, we do
not condition on Y , leaving open a path for A(1)
to influence its missingness. In Figure 5 (a), this
model is labeled as *.no y.

When correcting for measurement error, a
crucial piece of the estimation is the matrix
adjustment using the known error between
the proxy and the truth. A straightforward
misspecified model for measurement error is to
impute a proxy for each row in our dataset and
then calculate the causal effect assuming no error
between the proxy and truth. This approach,
while simplistic, can be thought of as using a text
classifier as a proxy without regard for the text
classifier’s biases. In Figure 5 (b), this approach
is labeled as *.unadjusted.

5.3.4 Correct Models
Finally, we consider the estimation approaches
presented in §4.1 and §4.2. For the missing data
causal effect (τMD from Eq 2) we use a multiple
imputation estimator which calculates the average
effect across 20 samples from p(A|T, C, Y ) for
each row where RA = 0. For the measurement
error causal effect (τME from Eq 3), we use the
training set of p(A,C, Y,T) data to estimate �c,y
and δc, y and the larger set of p(C, Y,T) data to
estimate qc,y and p(C).

These models are displayed in Figure 5 (a) as
*.full and in Figure 5 (b) *.adjusted.

5.4 Evaluation

Each model takes in a data sample with
missingness or mismeasurement, and outputs an
estimate of the causal effect of A on Y in the
underlying data. Rather than comparing models’
estimates against a population-level estimate,



4592

we compare against an estimate of the effect
computed on the same data sample, but without
any missing data or measurement error. This
‘perfect data estimator’ may still make errors
given the finite data sample. We compare against
this estimator to avoid a small-sample case where
an estimator gets lucky. In Figure 5, we plot data
sample size against the squared distance of each
model’s estimate from a perfect data estimator’s
estimate, averaged over ten runs. Figure 6 in
Appendix E contains a second set of experiments
using a larger vocabulary.

6 Results

Given that our correctly-specified models are
proven to be asymptotically consistent, we would
expect them to outperform misspecified models.
However, for any given dataset, asymptotic
consistency provides no guarantees.

6.1 Missing Data

The missing data (MD) experiments suggest that
the correct full model does perform best. The
no ymodel performs approximately as well as the
correct model on the synthetic data, but not on the
Yelp data. The difference between the no y and
full missing data models is simply a function
of the effect of Y on RA. We could tweak our
synthetic data distribution to increase the influence
of Y to make the no y model perform worse.

When we initially considered other
data-generating distributions for missing data,
we found that when we reduced the influence
of the text variables on RA, the no text and
naive models approached the performance of
the correctly-specified model. While intuitive,
this reinforces that the underlying distribution
matters a great deal in how modeling choices may
introduce biases if incorrectly specified.

6.2 Measurement error

The measurement error results tell a more
interesting story. We see enormous fluctuations
of the adjusted model, and in the synthetic
data, the unadjusted model appears to be quite
superior.

In the synthetic dataset, this is likely because
our text classifier had near-perfect accuracy, and
so simple approach of assuming its predictions
were ground-truth introduced less bias. A broader
issue with the adjusted model is that the

matrix adjustment approach requires dividing
by (potentially very small) probabilities, this
sometimes resulted in huge over-corrections. In
addition, since those probabilities are estimated
from a relatively small training dataset, small
changes to the error-estimate can propagate to
huge changes in the final casual estimate.

This instability of the matrix adjustment
approach may be a bigger problem for text and
other high-dimensional data: unlike in our earlier
example of BMI and obesity, there are likely
no simple relationships between text and clinical
variables. However, instead of using matrix
adjustment as a way to recover the true effect, we
may instead use it to bound the error our proxy
may introduce. As mentioned by Pearl (2010),
when p(A | A∗) is not known exactly, we can
use a Bayesian analysis to bound estimates of a
causal effect. In a downstream task, this would let
us explore the stability of our adjusted results.

7 Related Work

A few recent papers have considered the
possibilities for combining text data with
approaches from the causal inference literature.
Landeiro and Culotta (2016) and Landeiro and
Culotta (2017) explored text classification when
the relationship between text data and class labels
are confounded. Other work has used propensity
scores as a way to extract features from text
data (Paul, 2017) or to match social media users
based on what words they write (De Choudhury
et al., 2016). The only work we know of which
seeks to estimate causal effects using text data
focuses on effects of text or effects on text (Egami
et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2018). In our work,
our causal effects do not include text variables:
we use text variables to recover an underlying
distribution and then estimate a causal effect
within that distribution.

There is a conceptually related line of work
in the NLP community on inferring causal
relationships expressed in text (Girju, 2003;
Kaplan and Berry-Rogghe, 1991). However, our
work is fundamentally different. Rather than
identify casual relations expressed via language,
we are using text data in a causal model to identify
the strength of an underlying causal effect.

8 Future Directions

While this paper addresses some initial issues
arising from using text classifiers in causal
analyses, many challenges remain. We highlight
some of these issues as directions for future
research.

We provided several proof-of-concept models
for estimating effects, but our approach is
flexible to more sophisticated models. For
example, a semi-parametric estimator would
make no assumptions about the text data
distribution by wrapping the text classifier into
an infinite-dimensional nuisance model (Tsiatis,
2007). This would enable estimators robust to
partial model misspecification (Bang and Robins,
2005).

Choices in the design of statistical models of
text consider issues like accuracy and tractability.
Yet if these models are to be used in a causal
framework, we need to understand how modeling
assumptions introduce biases and other issues that
can interfere with a downstream causal analysis.
To take an example from the medical domain, we

know that doctors write clinical notes throughout
the healthcare process, but it is not obvious how
to model this data-generating process. We could
assume that the doctor’s notes passively record
a patient’s progression, but in reality it may be
that the content of the notes themselves actively
change the patient’s care; causality could work in
either direction.

New lines of work in causality may be
especially helpful for NLP. In this work, we used
simple logistic regression on a bag-of-words
representation of text; using state-of-the-art
text models will likely require more causal
assumptions. Nabi and Shpitser (2017) develops
causality-preserving dimensionality reduction,
which could help develop text representations that
preserve causality.

Finally, we are interested in case studies on
incorporating text classifiers into real-world causal
analyses. Many health studies have used text
classifiers to extract clinical variables from EHR
data (Meystre et al., 2008). These works could
be extended to study causal effects involving



4594

those extracted variables, but such extensions
would require an understanding of the underlying
assumptions. In any given study, the necessity
and appropriateness of assumptions will hinge
on domain expertise. The conceptualizations
outlined in this paper, while far from solving all
issues of causality and text, will help those using
text classifiers to more easily consider research
questions of cause and effect.

A Simple Confounding

p(Y (a)) =
∑
C

p(Y (a) | C)p(C) (4)

=
∑
C

p(Y (a) | A,C)p(C) (5)

=
∑
C

p(Y | A,C)p(C) (6)

Eq 5 holds because Y (a) ⊥ A | C, as seen in
Figure 1a. Plugging this distribution into τS =
E[Y (1)] − E[Y (0)] gives us the causal effect
presented in Figure 4, Eq 1.

This assumes that an intervention on A is
well-defined; if we did conduct a randomized
control trial, we could assign A = a and break
A’s dependence on C.

In general, this step requires that we condition
on all “back-door” paths between the treatment
and the outcome. In Figure 1(a), if we did not have
data on C, we could not block the back-door path
between A and Y .

Eq 6 holds due to consistency. We assume that,
given we intervened to setA = a, if that individual
would have been assigned A = a in nature, then
the distribution over Y is the same.

B Missing Data

Denote p(Y (A(1) = a)) = p(Y (a)).
First, we identify the causal effect in terms of

the true A(1).

p(Y (a))

=
∑
C

p(Y (a) | C)p(C) (7)

=
∑
C

p(Y (a) | A(1), C)p(C) (8)

=
∑
C

p(Y | A(1), C)p(C) (9)

Where 7 holds by chain rule, 8 holds byA(1) ⊥
Y (a) | C, and 9 by consistency.

Now, we identify A(1) in terms of observed
data.

p(A(1), C, Y )

= p(A(1) | C, Y )p(C, Y ) (10)
= p(A(1) | C, Y,RA = 1)p(C, Y ) (11)
= p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(C, Y ) (12)

Where 10 holds by chain rule, 11 by A(1) ⊥
RA | C, Y , and 12 by consistency.

Now, use Eq 12 to identify p(Y | A(1), C) from
Eq 9 in terms of observed data.

p(Y | A(1), C)

=
p(Y,A(1), C)

p(A(1), C)
(13)

=
p(Y,A(1), C)∑
Y p(Y,A(1), C)

(14)

=
p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(C, Y )∑
Y p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(C, Y )

(15)

=
p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(Y | C)∑
Y p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(Y | C)

(16)

Where 13 holds by definition, 14 holds by
marginalization, 15 holds by an application of 12
twice, and 16 holds by canceling out p(C).

If we include text in this derivation, we simply
replace p(A | C, Y,RA = 1) with p(A |
T, C, Y,RA = 1), where T is all our text
variables.

Finally, combine Eq 9 and Eq 16 to get:

p(Y (A(1) = a))

=
∑
C

p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(Y | C)∑
Y p(A | C, Y,RA = 1)p(Y | C)

p(C) (17)

Plugging this distribution into τMD =
E[Y (1)] − E[Y (0)] gives us the causal effect
presented in Figure 4, Eq 2.

C Measurement Error

Define the following terms for convenience:

�c,y = p(A = 0 | A∗ = 1, C = c, Y = y) (18)
δc, y = p(A = 1 | A∗ = 0, C = c, Y = y) (19)

qc,y(0) = p(C = c, Y = y,A
∗ = 0) (20)

qc,y(1) = p(C = c, Y = y,A
∗ = 1) (21)

Eq (5) and (7) from Pearl 2010 gives us:

p(A = 1, C = c, Y = y)

=
−δc,yqc,y(0) + (1− δc,y)qc,y(1)

(1− �c,y − δc,y)
(22)

p(A = 0, C = c, Y = y)

=
(1− �c,y)qc,y(0)− �c,yqc,y(1)

(1− �c,y − δc,y)
(23)



4597

Now,

p(Y | A = 1, C)

=
p(Y,A = 1, C)

p(A = 1, C)
(24)

=
p(Y,A = 1, C)∑
Y p(Y,A = 1, C)

(25)

=

−δc,yqc,y(0) + (1− δc,y)qc,y(1)
(1− �c,y − δc,y)∑

y′
−δc,y′qc,y′(0) + (1− δc,y′)qc,y′(1)

(1− �c,y′ − δc,y′)
(26)

and then,

p(Y | A = 0, C)

=
p(Y,A = 0, C)

p(A = 0, C)
(27)

=
p(Y,A = 0, C)∑
Y p(Y,A = 0, C)

(28)

=

(1− �c,y)qc,y(0)− �c,yqc,y(1)
(1− �c,y − δc,y)∑

y′
(1− �c,y′)qc,y′(0)− �c,y′qc,y′(1)

(1− �c,y′ − δc,y′)
(29)

Plugging this distribution into τME =
E[Y (1)] − E[Y (0)] gives us the causal effect
presented in Figure 4, Eq 3.

D Synthetic Data Distribution

In the distributions below, Ber(p) is used as
the abbreviation a Bernoulli distribution with
probability p.

Below, si, ui and vi are the effect of C, A,
and Y on the probability of word Ti; each is
drawn from N (0, ζ), a parameter which controls
how correlated words are with the underlying
variables. When ζ is close to 0, the words
are essentially random. When ζ is large, the
words are essentially deterministic functions of
the underlying variables. Similarly wi is the effect
of word Ti on RA, and is drawn from N (0, η).

For both settings, we set vocabulary size to
4,334 (to match Yelp experiments) and ζ = 0.5.
For the missing data setting, we set η = 0.1. We
picked these constants by empirically finding a
reasonable middle ground between the text data
providing only noise and being a deterministic
function of their parents. We picked all other
constants such that the naı̈ve correlation p(Y | A)
was a poor estimate of the counterfactual p(Y (a))
in the full-data setting.

Figure 6: Experimental results with a vocabulary of size 53,197. Squared distance (y-axis, lower is better)
of the estimated causal effect from τSC calculated from the full data with no missing data or measurement
error. Error bars (negligible for larger datasets) are 1.96 times standard error across 10 experiments.

E Additional Experiments

Figure 6 shows the results of a second set
of experiments, which are identical to those
described in §5 except the vocabulary size is now
53,197 instead of 4,334. For the Yelp data, the
larger vocabulary consists of all words which
appear at least ten times in a sample of 1M
reviews. As the larger vocabulary introduced
greater memory requirements, we did not run
these experiments with as large of datasets.

The results of these experiments show roughly
the same patterns as those seen in Figure 5.
The adjusted measurement error models again
appear erratic, generally performing worse than
the unadjusted models though better than the
naive models.

The full missing data model appeared to
slightly outperform the no y model on Yelp
data but only perform as well on the synthetic
data. Both these models appeared better than the
naive and no text models on both datasets.
