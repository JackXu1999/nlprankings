Abstract

We explore the use of segments learnt us-
ing Byte Pair Encoding (referred to as
BPE units) as basic units for statistical
machine translation between related lan-
guages and compare it with orthographic
syllables, which are currently the best
performing basic units for this transla-
tion task. BPE identifies the most fre-
quent character sequences as basic units,
while orthographic syllables are linguis-
tically motivated pseudo-syllables. We
show that BPE units modestly outperform
orthographic syllables as units of transla-
tion, showing up to 11% increase in BLEU
score. While orthographic syllables can
be used only for languages whose writing
systems use vowel representations, BPE is
writing system independent and we show
that BPE outperforms other units for non-
vowel writing systems too. Our results
are supported by extensive experimenta-
tion spanning multiple language families
and writing systems.

1 Introduction

The term, related languages, refers to languages
that exhibit lexical and structural similarities on
account of sharing a common ancestry or being in
contact for a long period of time (Bhattacharyya
et al., 2016). Examples of languages related by
common ancestry are Slavic and Indo-Aryan lan-
guages. Prolonged contact leads to convergence of
linguistic properties even if the languages are not
related by ancestry and could lead to the formation
of linguistic areas (Thomason, 2000). Examples
of such linguistic areas are the Indian subcontinent
(Emeneau, 1956), Balkan (Trubetzkoy, 1928) and
Standard Average European (Haspelmath, 2001)

linguistic areas. Genetic as well as contact rela-
tionship lead to related languages sharing vocabu-
lary and structural features.

There is substantial government, commercial
and cultural communication among people speak-
ing related languages (Europe, India and South-
East Asia being prominent examples and linguis-
tic regions in Africa possibly in the future). As
these regions integrate more closely and move to
a digital society, translation between related lan-
guages is becoming an important requirement. In
addition, translation to/from related languages to
a lingua franca like English is also very impor-
tant. However, despite significant communica-
tion between people speaking related languages,
most of these languages have few parallel corpora
resources. It is therefore important to leverage
the relatedness of these languages to build good-
quality statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tems given the lack of parallel corpora.

Modelling lexical similarity among related lan-
guages is the key to building good-quality SMT
systems with limited parallel corpora. Lexical
similarity implies related languages share many
words with similar form (spelling/pronunciation)
and meaning e.g. blindness is andhapana
in Hindi, aandhaLepaNaa in Marathi. These
words could be cognates, lateral borrowings or
loan words from other languages.

Subword level transformations are an effective
way for translation of such shared words. In
this work, we propose use of Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) (Gage, 1994; Sennrich et al., 2016), a en-
coding method inspired from text compression lit-
erature, to learn basic translation units for transla-
tion between related languages. In previous work,
the basic units of translation are either linguisti-
cally motivated (word, morpheme, syllable, etc.)
or ad-hoc choices (character n-gram). In contrast,
BPE is motivated by statistical properties of text.

The major contributions of our work are:

• We show that BPE units modestly out-
perform orthographic syllable units
(Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016b),
the best performing basic unit for translation
between related languages, resulting in up to
11% improvement in BLEU score.
• Unlike orthographic syllables, BPE units are

writing system independent. Orthographic
syllables can only be applied to alphabetic
and abugida writing systems. We show BPE
units improve translation over word and mor-
pheme level models for languages using ab-
jad and logographic writing systems. Aver-
age BLEU score improvements of 18% and
6% over a baseline word-level model for lan-
guage pairs involving abjad and logographic
writing systems respectively were observed.
• Like orthographic syllables, BPE units out-

perform character, morph and word units
when the language pairs show relatively less
lexical similarity or belong to different lan-
guage families (but have sufficient contact re-
lation).
• While orthographic syllables approximate

true syllables, we observe that BPE units
learnt from the corpus span various linguis-
tic entities (syllables, suffixes, morphemes,
words, etc. ). This may enable BPE level
models to learn translation mappings at vari-
ous levels simultaneously.
• We have reported results over a large number

of languages (16 language pairs and 17 lan-
guages) which span 4 major language fami-
lies and 10 writing systems of various types.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the
largest experiment for translation over related
languages and the broad coverage strongly
supports our results.
• We also show BPE units outperform other

translation units in a cross-domain transla-
tion task.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses related work. Section 3 discusses why
BPE is a promising method for learning subword
units and describes how we train BPE unit level
translation models. Section 4 describes our exper-
imental set-up. Section 5 reports the results of our
experiments and analyses the results. Based on ex-
perimental results, we analyse why BPE units out-

perform other units in Section 6. Section 7 con-
cludes the paper by summarizing our work and
discussing further research directions.

2 Related Work

There are two broad set of approaches that have
been explored in the literature for translation be-
tween related languages that leverage lexical sim-
ilarity between source and target languages.

The first approach involves transliteration of
source words into the target languages. This
can done by transliterating the untranslated words
in a post-processing step (Nakov and Tiedemann,
2012; Kunchukuttan et al., 2014), a technique
generally used for handling named entities in
SMT. However, transliteration candidates cannot
be scored and tuned along with other features used
in the SMT system. This limitation can be over-
come by integrating the transliteration module into
the decoder (Durrani et al., 2010), so both trans-
lation and transliteration candidates can be evalu-
ated and scored simultaneously. This also allows
transliteration vs. translation choices to be made.

Since a high degree of similarity exists at the
subword level between related languages, the sec-
ond approach looks at translation with sub-
word level basic units. Character-level SMT
has been explored for very closely related lan-
guages like Bulgarian-Macedonian, Indonesian-
Malay, Spanish-Catalan with modest success (Vi-
lar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009a; Tiedemann and
Nakov, 2013). Unigram-level learning provides
very little context for learning translation models
(Tiedemann, 2012). The use of character n-gram
units to address this limitation leads to data spar-
sity for higher order n-grams and provides little
benefit (Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013). These re-
sults were demonstrated primarily for very close
European languages. Kunchukuttan and Bhat-
tacharyya (2016b) proposed orthographic syl-
lables, a linguistically-motivated variable-length
unit, which approximates a syllable. This unit
has outperformed character n-gram, word and
morpheme level models as well as transliteration
post-editing approaches mentioned earlier. They
also showed orthographic syllables can outper-
form other units even when: (i) the lexical distance
between related languages is reasonably large, (ii)
the languages do not have a genetic relation, but
only a contact relation.

Recently, subword level models have also gen-

15



erated interest for neural machine translation
(NMT) systems. The motivation is the need to
limit the vocabulary of neural MT systems in
encoder-decoder architectures (Sutskever et al.,
2014). It is in this context that Byte Pair En-
coding, a data compression method (Gage, 1994),
was adapted to learn subword units for NMT (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016). Other subword units for NMT
have also been proposed: character (Chung et al.,
2016), Huffman encoding based units (Chitnis and
DeNero, 2015), wordpieces (Schuster and Naka-
jima, 2012; Wu et al., 2016). Our hypothesis is
that such subword units learnt from corpora are
particularly suited for translation between related
languages. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by
using BPE to learn subword units.

3 BPE for related languages

We discuss why BPE is a promising method for
learning subword units (subsections 3.1 and 3.2)
and describe how we trained our BPE unit level
translation models (subsections 3.3 and 3.4).

3.1 Motivation

Byte Pair Encoding is a data compression algo-
rithm which was first adapted for Neural Machine
Translation by Sennrich et al. (2016). For a given
language, it is used to build a vocabulary rel-
evant to translation by discovering the most fre-
quent character sequences in the language.

For NMT, BPE enables efficient, high quality,
open vocabulary translation by (i) limiting core
vocabulary size, (ii) representing the most fre-
quent words as atomic BPE units and rare words
as compositions of the atomic BPE units. These
benefits of BPE are not particular to NMT, and ap-
ply to SMT between related languages too. Given
the lexical similarity between related languages,
we would like to identify a small, core vocabulary
of subwords from which words in the language can
be composed. These subwords represent stable,
frequent patterns (possibly linguistic units like syl-
lables, morphemes, affixes) for which mappings
exist in other related languages. This alleviates the
need for word level translation.

3.2 Comparison with orthographic syllables

We primarily compare BPE units with ortho-
graphic syllables (OS) (Kunchukuttan and Bhat-
tacharyya, 2016b), which are good translation
units for related languages. The orthographic syl-

lable is a sequence of one or more consonants fol-
lowed by a vowel, i.e. a C+V unit, which approxi-
mates a linguistic syllable (e.g. spacious would be
segmented as spa ciou s). Orthographic syllabifi-
cation is rule based and applies to writing systems
which represent vowels (alphabets and abugidas).

Both OS and BPE units are variable length units
which provide longer and more relevant context
for translation compared to character n-grams. In
contrast to orthographic syllables, the BPE units
are highly frequent character sequences reflect-
ing the underlying statistical properties of the text.
Some of the character sequences discovered by the
BPE algorithm may be different linguistic units
like syllables, morphemes and affixes. Moreover,
BPE can be applied to text in any writing system.

3.3 The BPE Algorithm
We briefly summarize the BPE algorithm (de-
scribed at length in Sennrich et al. (2016)). The
input is a monolingual corpus for a language (one
side of the parallel training data, in our case). We
start with an initial vocabulary viz. the characters
in the text corpus. The vocabulary is updated using
an iterative greedy algorithm. In every iteration,
the most frequent bigram (based on current vocab-
ulary) in the corpus is added to the vocabulary (the
merge operation). The corpus is again encoded us-
ing the updated vocabulary and this process is re-
peated for a pre-determined number of merge op-
erations. The number of merge operations is the
only hyperparameter to the system which needs to
be tuned. A new word can be segmented by look-
ing up the learnt vocabulary. For instance, a new
word scion may be segmented as sc ion after
looking up the learnt vocabulary, assuming sc and
ion as BPE units learnt during training.

3.4 Training subword level translation model
We train subword level phrase-based SMT models
between related languages. Along with BPE level,
we also train PBSMT models at morpheme and
OS levels for comparison.

For BPE, we learn the vocabulary separately for
the source and target languages using the respec-
tive part of the training corpus. We segment the
data into subwords during pre-processing and in-
dicate word boundaries by a boundary marker ( )
as shown in the example below. The boundary
marker helps keep track of word boundaries, so
the word level representation can be reconstructed
after decoding.

subword: Chi ldhoo d mea ns si mpli ci ty .

While building phrase-based SMT models at
the subword level, we use (a) monotonic decod-
ing since related languages have similar word or-
der, (b) higher order languages models (10-gram)
since data sparsity is a lesser concern owing to
small vocabulary size (Vilar et al., 2007), and (c)
word level tuning (by post-processing the decoder
output during tuning) to optimize the correct trans-
lation metric (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012). Fol-
lowing decoding, we used a simple method to re-
generate words from subwords (desegmentation):
concatenate subwords between consecutive occur-
rences of boundary marker characters.

4 Experimental Setup

We trained translation systems over the follow-
ing basic units: character, morpheme, word, or-
thographic syllable and BPE unit. In this section,
we summarize the languages and writing systems
chosen for our experiments, the datasets used and
the experimental configuration of our translation
systems, and the evaluation methodology.

4.1 Languages and writing systems

Our experiments spanned a diverse set of lan-
guages: 16 language pairs, 17 languages and 10
writing systems. Table 1 summarizes the key as-
pects of the languages involved in the experiments.

The chosen languages span 4 major language
families (6 major sub-groups: Indo-Aryan, Slavic
and Germanic belong to the larger Indo-European
language family). The languages exhibit diversity
in word order and morphological complexity. Of
course, between related languages, word order and
morphological properties are similar. The clas-
sification of Japanese and Korean into the Altaic
family is debated, but various lexical and gram-
matical similarities are indisputable, either due to
genetic or cognate relationship (Robbeets, 2005;
Vovin, 2010). However, the source of lexical sim-
ilarity is immaterial to the current work. For want
of a better classification, we use the name Altaic
to indicate relatedness between Japanese and Ko-
rean.

The chosen language pairs also exhibit vary-
ing levels of lexical similarity. Table 3 shows an
indication of the lexical similarity between them
in terms of the Longest Common Subsequence
Ratio (LCSR) (Melamed, 1995). The LCSR has
been computed over the parallel training sentences
at character level (shown only for language pairs
where the writing systems are the same or can be
easily mapped in order to do the LCSR compu-
tation). At one end of the spectrum, Malayalam-
India, Urdu-Hindi, Macedonian-Bulgarian are di-
alects/registers of the same language and exhibit
high lexical similarity. At the other end, pairs
like Hindi-Malayalam belong to different lan-
guage families, but show many lexical and gram-
matical similarities due to contact for a long time
(Subbarao, 2012).

The chosen languages cover 5 types of writing
systems. Of these, alphabetic and abugida writ-
ing systems represent vowels, logographic writing
systems do not have vowels. The use of vowels
is optional in abjad writing systems and depends
on various factors and conventions. For instance,
Urdu word segmentation can be very inconsistent
(Durrani and Hussain, 2010) and generally short
vowels are not denoted. The Korean Hangul writ-
ing system is syllabic, so the vowels are implicitly
represented in the characters.

4.2 Datasets

Table 2a shows train, test and tune splits of the
parallel corpora used. The Indo-Aryan and Dra-
vidian language parallel corpora are obtained from
the multilingual Indian Language Corpora Initia-
tive (ILCI) corpus (Jha, 2012). Parallel corpora

for other pairs were obtained from the OpenSub-
titles2016 section of the OPUS corpus collection
(Tiedemann, 2009b). Language models for word-
level systems were trained on the target side of
training corpora plus additional monolingual cor-
pora from various sources (See Table 2b for de-
tails). We used just the target language side of the
parallel corpora for character, morpheme, OS and
BPE-unit level LMs.

4.3 System details

We trained phrase-based SMT systems using the
Moses system (Koehn et al., 2007), with the grow-
diag-final-and heuristic for extracting phrases, and
Batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) for tuning
(default parameters). We trained 5-gram LMs with
Kneser-Ney smoothing for word and morpheme
level models and 10-gram LMs for character, OS
and BPE-unit level models. Subword level rep-
resentation of sentences is long, hence we speed
up decoding by using cube pruning with a smaller
beam size (pop-limit=1000). This setting has been
shown to have minimal impact on translation qual-
ity (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016a).

We used unsupervised morphological-
segmenters for generating morpheme repre-
sentations (trained using Morfessor (Smit et al.,
2014)). For Indian languages, we used the
models distributed as part of the Indic NLP

Library1 (Kunchukuttan et al., 2014). We used
orthographic syllabification rules from the Indic
NLP Library for Indian languages, and custom
rules for Latin and Slavic scripts. For training
BPE models, we used the subword-nmt2 library.
We used Juman3 and Mecab4 for Japanese and
Korean tokenization respectively.

For mapping characters across Indic scripts, we
used the method described by Kunchukuttan et al.
(2015) and implemented in the Indic NLP Library.

4.4 Evaluation

The primary evaluation metric is word-level
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). We also report
LeBLEU (Virpioja and Grönroos, 2015) scores as
an alternative evaluation metric. LeBLEU is a
variant of BLEU that does an edit-distance based,
soft-matching of words and has been shown to
be better for morphologically rich languages. We
used bootstrap resampling for testing statistical
significance (Koehn, 2004).

5 Results and Analysis

This section describes the results of various exper-
iments and analyses them. A comparison of BPE
with other units across languages and writing sys-
tems, choice of number of merge operations and
effect of domain change and training data size are
studied. We also report initial results with a joint
bilingual BPE model.

5.1 Comparison of BPE with other units

Table 3 shows translation accuracies of all the
language pairs under experimentation for differ-
ent translation units, in terms of BLEU as well as
LeBLEU scores. The number of BPE merge op-
erations was chosen such that the resultant vocab-
ulary size would be equivalent to the vocabulary
size of the orthographic syllable encoded corpus.
Since we could not do orthographic syllabification
for Urdu, Korean and Japanese, we selected the
merge operations as follows: For Urdu, number of
merge operations were selected based on Hindi OS
vocabulary since Hindi and Urdu are registers of
the same language. For Korean and Japanese, the
number of BPE merge operations was set to 3000,
discovered by tuning on a separate validation set.

reported scores are:- W: word-level, M: morpheme, O: orthographic syllable, Bmatch: BPE units with
number of merge operations selected to match vocabulary size of OS encoding. See discussion related to
exceptions for pairs involving Urdu, Korean and Japanese. (a) The values marked in bold indicate best
score for a language pair (b) LCSR indicates lexical similarity (c) NA: Not Applicable. (d) † indicates
that difference in BLEU scoresbetween Bmatch and O are statistically significant (p < 0.05)

Our major observations are described below
(based on BLEU scores):

• BPE units are clearly better than the traditional
word and morpheme representations. The aver-
age BLEU score improvement is 15% over word-
based results and 11% over morpheme-based re-
sults. The only exception is Malay-Indonesian,
which are registers of the same language.

• BPE units also show modest improvement
over the recently proposed orthographic sylla-
bles over most language pairs (average improve-
ment of 2.6% and maximum improvement of up
to 11%). The improvements are not statistically
significant for most language pairs. The only
exceptions are Bengali-Hindi, Punjabi-Hindi and
Malay-Indonesian - all these languages pairs have
relatively less morphological affixing (Bengali-
Hindi, Punjabi-Hindi) or are registers of the same
language (Malay-Indonesian). For Bengali-Hindi
and Punjabi-Hindi, the BPE unit translation accu-
racies are quite close to OS level accuracies. Since
OS level models have been shown to be better than
character level models (Kunchukuttan and Bhat-
tacharyya, 2016b), BPE units are better than char-
acter level models by transitivity.

• BPE units also outperform other units for trans-
lation between language pairs belonging to dif-

ferent language pairs, but having a long con-
tact relationship viz. Malayalam-Hindi and Hindi-
Malayalam.
• It is worth mentioning that BPE units provide
a substantial benefit over OS units when trans-
lation involves a morphologically rich language.
In translations involving Malayalam, Tamil and
Telugu, average accuracy improvement of 6.25%
were observed.

The LeBLEU scores also show the same trends
as the BLEU scores.

5.2 Applicability to different writing systems
The utility of orthographic syllables as transla-
tion units is limited to languages that use writ-
ing systems which represent vowels. Alphabetic
and abugida writing systems fall into this category.
On the other hand, logographic writing systems
(Japanese Kanji, Chinese) and abjad writing sys-
tems (Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc.) do not rep-
resent vowels. To be more precise, abjad writing
systems may represent some/all vowels depending
on language, pragmatics and conventions. Syl-
labic writing systems like Korean Hangul do not
explicitly represent vowels, since the basic unit
(the syllable) implicitly represents the vowels. The
major advantage of Byte Pair Encoding is its writ-
ing system independence and our results show

that BPE encoded units are useful for translation
involving abjad (Urdu uses an extended Arabic
writing system), logographic (Japanese Kanji) and
syllabic (Korean Hangul) writing systems. For
language pairs involving Urdu, there is an 18% av-
erage improvement over word-level and 12% aver-
age improvement over morpheme-level translation
accuracy. For Japanese-Korean language pairs, an
average improvement of 6% in translation accu-
racy over a word-level baseline is observed.

5.3 Choosing number of BPE merges

The above mentioned results for BPE units do not
explore optimal values of the number of merge
operations. This is the only hyper-parameter that
has to be selected for BPE. We experimented with
number of merge operations ranging from 1000
to 4000 and the translation results for these are
shown in Table 4. Selecting the optimal value
of merge operations lead to a modest, average in-
crease of 1.6% and maximum increase of 3.5% in
the translation accuracy over Bmatch across differ-
ent language pairs .

We also experimented with higher number of
merge operations for some language pairs, but
there seemed to be no benefit with a higher num-
ber of merge operations. Compared to the number
of merge operations reported by Sennrich et al.
(2016) in a more general setting for NMT (60k),
the number of merge operations is far less for

translation between related languages with limited
parallel corpora. We must bear in mind that their
goal was different: available parallel corpus was
not an issue, but they wanted to handle as large a
vocabulary as possible for open-vocabulary NMT.
Yet, the low number of merge operations suggest
that BPE encoding captures the core vocabulary
required for translation between related tasks.

5.4 Robustness to Domain Change

Since we are concerned with low resource sce-
narios, a desirable property of subword units is
robustness of the translation models to change
of translation domain. Kunchukuttan and Bhat-
tacharyya (2016b) have shown that OS level mod-
els are robust to domain change. Since BPE
units are learnt from a specific corpus, it is not
guaranteed that they would also be robust to do-
main changes. To study the behaviour of BPE
unit trained models, we also tested the transla-
tion models trained on tourism & health domains
on an agriculture domain test set of 1000 sen-
tences (see Table 5 for results). In this cross-
domain translation scenario, the BPE level model
outperforms the OS-level and word-level models

Figure 1: Effect of training data size on translation
accuracy for different basic units

for most language pairs. The Konkani-Marathi
pair alone shows a degradation using the OS level
model. The BPE model is almost on par with the
OS level model for Telugu-Malayalam and Hindi-
Malayalam.

5.5 Effect of training data size

For different training set sizes, we trained SMT
systems with various representation units (Fig-
ure 1 shows the learning curves for two language
pairs). BPE level models are better than OS, mor-
pheme and word level across a range of dataset
sizes. Especially when the training data is very
small, the OS and BPE level models perform sig-
nificantly better than the word and morpheme level
models. For Malayalam-Hindi, the BPE level
model is better than the OS level model at utilizing
more training data.

5.6 Joint bilingual learning of BPE units

In the experiments discussed so far, we learnt the
BPE vocabulary separately for the source and tar-
get languages. In this section, we describe our
experiments with jointly learning BPE vocabulary
over source and target language corpora as sug-
gested by Sennrich et al. (2016). The idea is to

learn an encoding that is consistent across source
and target languages and therefore helps align-
ment. We expect a significant number of common
BPE units between related languages. If source
and target languages use the same writing sys-
tem, then a joint model is created by learning BPE
over concatenated source and target language cor-
pus. If the writing systems are different, then
we transliterate one corpus to another by one-one
character mappings. This is possible between In-
dic scripts. But this scheme cannot be applied be-
tween Urdu and Indic scripts as well as between
Korean Hangul and Japanese Kanji scripts.

Table 6 shows the results of the joint BPE model
for language pairs where such a model is built. We
do not see any major improvement over the mono-
lingual BPE model due to the joint BPE model.

6 Why are BPE units better than others?

The improved performance of BPE units com-
pared to word-level and morpheme-level represen-
tations is easy to explain: with a limited vocab-
ulary they address the problem of data spar-
sity. But character level models also have a lim-
ited vocabulary, yet they do not improve transla-
tion performance except for very close languages.
Character level models learn character mappings
effectively, which is sufficient for translating re-
lated languages which are very close to each
other (translation is akin to transliteration in these
cases). But they are not sufficient for translat-
ing related languages that are more divergent. In
this case, translating cognates, morphological af-
fixes, non-cognates etc. require a larger context.
So, BPE and OS units — which provide more

context — outperform character units.
A study of the correlation between lexical sim-

ilarity and translation quality makes this evident
(See Table 7). We see that character models work
best when the source and target sentences are lex-
ically very similar. The additional context de-
couples OS and BPE units from lexical similarity.
Words and morphemes show the least correlation
since they do not depend on lexical similarity.

Why does BPE performs better than OS which
also provides a larger contextual window for trans-
lation? While orthographic syllables represent just
approximate syllables, we observe that BPE units
also represent higher level semantic units like
frequent morphemes, suffixes and entire words.
Table 8 shows a few examples for some Indian
languages. So, BPE level models can learn se-
mantically similar translation mappings in addi-
tion to lexically similar mappings. In this way,
BPE units enable the translation models to bal-
ance the use of lexical similarity with semantic
similarity. This further decouples the translation
quality from lexical similarity as seen from the ta-
ble. BPE units also have an additional degree
of freedom (choice of vocabulary size), which al-
lows tuning for best translation performance. This
could be important when larger parallel corpora

are available, allowing larger vocabulary sizes.

7 Conclusion & Future Work

We show that translation units learnt using BPE
can outperform all previously proposed transla-
tion units, including the best-performing ortho-
graphic syllables, for SMT between related lan-
guages when limited parallel corpus is available.
Moreover, BPE encoding is writing system inde-
pendent, hence it can be applied to any language.
Experimentation on a large number of language
pairs spanning diverse language families and writ-
ing systems lend strong support to our results.
We also show that BPE units are more robust to
change in translation domain. They perform better
for morphologically rich languages and extremely
data scarce scenarios.

BPE seems to be beneficial because it enables
discovery of translation mappings at various levels
simultaneously (syllables, suffixes, morphemes,
words, etc. ). We would like to further pursue
this line of work and investigate better translation
units. This is also a question relevant to translation
with subwords in NMT. NMT between related lan-
guages using BPE and similar encodings is also an
obvious direction to explore.

Given the improved performance of the BPE-
unit, tasks involving related languages viz. pivot
based MT, domain adaptation (Tiedemann, 2012)
and translation between a lingua franca and re-
lated languages (Wang et al., 2012) can be revis-
ited with BPE units.
