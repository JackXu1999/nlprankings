Abstract

Image captioning models are typically
trained on data that is collected from peo-
ple who are asked to describe an image,
without being given any further task con-
text. As we argue here, this context inde-
pendence is likely to cause problems for
transferring to task settings in which im-
age description is bound by task demands.
We demonstrate that careful design of data
collection is required to obtain image de-
scriptions which are contextually bounded
to a particular meta-level task. As a task,
we use MeetUp!, a text-based communica-
tion game where two players have the goal
of finding each other in a visual environ-
ment. To reach this goal, the players need
to describe images representing their cur-
rent location. We analyse a dataset from
this domain and show that the nature of
image descriptions found in MeetUp! is
diverse, dynamic and rich with phenom-
ena that are not present in descriptions ob-
tained through a simple image captioning
task, which we ran for comparison.

1 Introduction

Automatic description generation from real-world
images has emerged as a key task in vision &
language in recent years (Fang et al., 2015; De-
vlin et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Bernardi
et al., 2016), and datasets like Flickr8k (Hodosh
et al., 2013), Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) or Mi-
crosoft CoCo (Lin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015)
are typically considered to be general benchmarks
for visual and linguistic image understanding. By
exploiting these sizeable data collections and re-
cent advances in computer vision (e.g. ConvNets,
attention, etc.), image description models have

achieved impressive performance, at least for in-
domain training and testing on existing bench-
marks.

Nevertheless, the actual linguistic definition and
foundation of image description as a task remains
unclear and is a matter of ongoing debate, e.g. see
(van Miltenburg et al., 2017) for a conceptual dis-
cussion of the task from a cross-lingual perspec-
tive. According to (Bernardi et al., 2016), image
description generation involves generating a tex-
tual description (typically a sentence) that verbal-
izes the most salient aspects of the image. In prac-
tice, however, researchers have observed that elic-
iting descriptions from naive subjects (i.e. mostly
crowd-workers) at a consistent level of quality is a
non-trivial task (Rashtchian et al., 2010), as work-
ers seem to interpret the task in different ways.
Thus, previous works have developed relatively
elaborate instructions and quality checking con-
ventions for being able to systematically collect
image descriptions.

In this paper, we argue that problems result from
the fact that the task is typically put to the work-
ers without providing any further context. This
entirely monological setting essentially suggests
that determining the salient aspects of an image
(like highly important objects, object properties,
scene properties) can be solved in a general, “neu-
tral” way, by humans and systems. We present
ongoing work on collecting image descriptions
in task-oriented dialogue where descriptions are
generated collaboratively by two players. Impor-
tantly, in our setting (which we call the MeetUp!
environment), image descriptions serve the pur-
pose of solving a higher-level task (meeting in a
room, which in the game translates to determin-
ing whether an image that is seen is the same as
the one that the partner sees). Hence, our partici-
pants need not be instructed explicitly to produce
image descriptions. In this collaborative setting,



398

we observe that the notion of saliency is non-static
throughout a dialogue. Depending on the history
of the interaction, and the current state, speakers
seem to flexibly adjust their descriptions (ranging
from short scene descriptions to specific object de-
scriptions) to achieve their common goal. More-
over, the descriptions are more factual than those
collected in a monological setting. We believe that
this opens up new perspectives for image caption-
ing models, which can be trained on data that is
bounded to its contextual use.

2 Related Work

As described above, the fact that the seemingly
simple task of image captioning can be interpreted
differently by crowd-workers has already been
recognised in the original publications describing
the datasets (Hodosh et al., 2013; Young et al.,
2014; Chen et al., 2015). However, it has been
treated as a problem that can be addressed through
the design of instructions (e.g., “do not give peo-
ple names”, “do not describe unimportant details”,
(Chen et al., 2015)). (van Miltenburg et al., 2016;
van Miltenburg, 2017) later investigated the range
of pragmatic phenomena to be found in such cap-
tion corpora, with the conclusion that the instruc-
tions do not sufficiently control for them and leave
it to the labellers to make their own decisions. It
is one contribution of the present paper to show
that providing a task context results in more con-
strained descriptions.

Schlangen et al. (2016) similarly noted that re-
ferring expressions in a corpus that was collected
in a (pseudo-)interactive setting (Kazemzadeh
et al., 2014), where the describers were provided
with immediate feedback about whether their ex-
pression was understood, were more concise than
those collected in a monological setting (Mao
et al., 2016).

Similar to MeetUp, the use of various dialogue
game set-ups has lately been established for dia-
logue data collection. Das et al. (2017) designed
the “Visual Dialog” task where a human asks an
agent about the content of an image. De Vries
et al. (2017) similarly collected the GuessWhat?
corpus of dialogues in which one player has to
ask polar questions in order to identify the cor-
rect referent in the pool of images. de Vries et al.
(2018) also develop a new navigation task, where
a “tourist” has to reach a target location via com-
munication with a “guide” given 2D images of

various map locations. While similar in some re-
spects, MeetUp is distinguished by being a sym-
metrical task (no instruction giver/follower) and
broader concerning language data (more phenom-
ena such as repairs, strategy negotiation).

3 Data collection

3.1 MeetUp image descriptions
The MeetUp game is a two-player text-based com-
munication game set in a visual 2D environment.1

The game starts with two players being placed in
different ‘rooms’. Rooms are represented to the
players through images.2 Each player only sees
their own location. The objective of the game
is to find each other; that is, to be in the same
room. To solve this task, players can communi-
cate via text messages and move freely (but un-
noticed by the other player) to adjacent rooms.
In the process of the game, the players naturally
produce descriptions of what they currently see—
and, interestingly, sometimes of what they have
previously seen—to determine whether they have
reached their goal or not. When they think that
they have indeed achieved their goal, they indicate
this via a particular command, and the dialogue
ends.

The corpus we use here consists of 25 MeetUp
(MU) games, collected via crowd-sourcing with
Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers were required
to be native speakers of English. The dialogues all
end with a matching phase where the players try
to establish whether they are in the same room, by
exchanging descriptions and come to the conclu-
sion that they are (correctly in fact, in all but one
dialogue). In some games, the players earlier al-
ready suspected to be in the same room and had
such a “matching phase”, but concluded that they
weren’t.

The complexity of the game board is likely to
have an influence on the shape of the dialogue. For
this data collection, we handcrafted a set of game
boards to contain a certain degree of room type re-
dundancy (e.g., more than one bed room per game
board) and varying levels of overall complexity, as
indicated in Table 2.

For our investigations here, we take these
“matching phase” sub-dialogues and the images

et al., 2016), which is a collection of images of indoor and
outdoor scenes.

that they are about (note that for the non-matching
situations, there are two images for one sub-
dialogue), to give us a set of 33 images together
with corresponding utterances. We will call these
utterances dialogical image descriptions (DDs),
in contrast to the monological image descriptions
(MDs) described in the next subsection.

An example of such a description is shown in
Table 1. From left to right columns represent
line number in a dialogue, timestamp of a mes-
sage, messages private to player A, messages seen
by both, private messages of player B. Lines 60-
72 in the transcript contain part of the dialogue
where players act on suspicion that they might be
in the same location and start describing images
presented to them individually. In earlier stages
of the dialogue (lines 31 and 59), this room had
already been referenced to. It indicates that the
player keeps a memory of what has already been
mentioned and can refer back to that.

3.2 Monological image descriptions

In order to compare dialogical descriptions with
data produced in a typical non-context caption en-
vironment, we also collected MDs on Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT). We presented workers
with the 33 images and instructed them to pro-
duce captions for them. We adopted the instruc-
tions from the MS COCO collection (Chen et al.,
2015), which ask workers to “describe the impor-
tant parts” of the image, and, importantly, to pro-
vide at least eight (8) words per image description.
We collected four captions per image; and thus
132 captions overall. An example of four mono-
logical image descriptions for one image is shown
in Figure 1.

4 Analysis

An important task is to determine what types of
referring expressions are present in the datasets.
In order to identify and analyse referring expres-
sions, we used the brat annotation tool (Stenetorp
et al., 2012) to tokenise and annotate both DDs
and MDs. The first author of the paper anno-
tated whether an utterance contains descriptions
of scene with objects (a kitchen with wood floors),
or objects only (a white marble dining table), ex-
presses players’ actions (moving north now) or is

Table 3: Analysis of image descriptions

related to players’ beliefs about their current state
(I think we are in the same room). For our analysis
we define referring expressions (REXs) as nomi-
nal phrases that refer to the objects in the scene
(four chairs) or to the scene itself (a kitchen).

Additionally, we identified parts of speech in
both DDs and MDs using Stanford Log-linear
Part-Of-Speech Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
Examples of REXs according to this definition are
displayed in bold in Figure 1 for MDs and in Ta-
ble 1 for DDs.

Table 3 gives some basic statistics about the two
data sets. The goal is to look at the task depen-
dence of image descriptions. Each MU dialogue
can be divided into phases, two of which are ex-
emplified in Table 1. The roaming phase (part of
it are lines 31, 59) is typically filled with move-
ments and players informing each other about their
location. The matching phase (lines 60-72) ends
the dialogue with the determination that the two
players are present in the same place. In order to
demonstrate dynamics of interactions in MeetUp,
we look at all DDs as well as at their statisti-
cal characteristics in two phases. There were al-
most two times more DDs than MDs overall, with
matching phase requiring a high number of de-
scriptions as well. At the same time, MDs tend
to be longer than all DDs, though both sets have
nearly identical type/token ratio.

4.1 Referring expressions in MDs and DDs

When looking at the number of REXs in Table
3, in the MeetUp set-up players produced almost
four times more overall referring expressions than
the workers that produced the MD set. The ma-
jority of these occurred in the matching phases,
which indicates that the different subgoals be-
tween phases have an influence. There were also
nearly two times as many REXs per individual de-
scription in the MeetUp setting than in the mono-
logical descriptions. Additionally, given the fact

that MeetUp descriptions are generally more con-
densed than the MDs (8.64 vs. 12.5), it appears
that MDs contain much material not directly rel-
evant for reference to the scene or its objects. In
particular we observed that there are on average
11 words in MDs (88%) which are not REXs and
thus not related to an image, while there are nearly
only 6 (70%) non-REX words in DDs. MeetUp
players also produce longer REXs and this param-
eter is stable for all MeetUp phases. These ob-
servations show that the MeetUp descriptions are
more focused on the task, less broad, contain much
more referring expressions, which are longer then
the ones in the non-task-driven set-up.

4.2 Adjectives in MD and DD
Table 4 displays the most frequent adjectives in
both datasets in the spirit of (Baltaretu and Fer-
reira, 2016), who compared type and frequency of
adjectives in a similar task design. It clearly shows
a trend that seems to be present in the overall data:
MDs cover a broader range of object properties or
image attributes than the DDs.

small 11
large 9

beautiful 8

nice 7

right 3

Table 4: First 10 most frequent adjectives in both
MDs (left) and DDs (right)

For example, evaluative adjectives (beautiful,
nice) appear very often in MDs, while none of
them is observed for the DDs. The latter ones
seem to concentrate on attributes like colour, size,
position, qualities of objects, while monological
captions additionally have adjectives which refer



401

to age, feelings, a number of objects in the scene.
Furthermore, 78 adjectives occur only once among
all words in MDs, while this number is almost half
that for the DDs (38). It additionally supports the
idea that absence of the task makes humans to pro-
duce broad image descriptions, which are not nec-
essarily grounded in scene objects.

5 Conclusion

The task of collecting appropriate training data for
image caption generation systems, and language
& vision in general, is not a trivial one. We found
that in a standard crowdsourcing-based collection
procedure, annotators tend to produce interpreta-
tive, non-factual descriptions, leading to poten-
tially unsystematic or noisy data. We have pre-
sented a task-oriented interactive set-up for data
collection where image descriptions are naturally
used by speakers to solve a higher level task. Our
data collected in a small-scale pilot study indi-
cates that dialogical image descriptions consis-
tently lead to factual descriptions containing many
more reasonable referring expressions than mono-
logical descriptions. The analysis presented here
will be used to further control MeetUp! data col-
lection in order to avoid data that is similar to non-
task-drive monological captions.
