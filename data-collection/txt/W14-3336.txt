Abstract

This paper presents the results of the
WMT14 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the
outputs of the MT systems involved in
WMT14 Shared Translation Task. We col-
lected scores of 23 metrics from 12 re-
search groups. In addition to that we com-
puted scores of 6 standard metrics (BLEU,
NIST, WER, PER, TER and CDER) as
baselines. The collected scores were eval-
uated in terms of system level correlation
(how well each metric’s scores correlate
with WMT14 official manual ranking of
systems) and in terms of segment level
correlation (how often a metric agrees with
humans in comparing two translations of a
particular sentence).

1 Introduction

Automatic machine translation metrics play a very
important role in the development of MT systems
and their evaluation. There are many different
metrics of diverse nature and one would like to
assess their quality. For this reason, the Met-
rics Shared Task is held annually at the Workshop
of Statistical Machine Translation1, starting with
Koehn and Monz (2006) and following up to Bo-
jar et al. (2014).

In this task, we asked metrics developers to
score the outputs of WMT14 Shared Translation
Task (Bojar et al., 2014). We have collected the
computed metrics’ scores and use them to evalu-
ate quality of the metrics.

The systems’ outputs, human judgements and
evaluated metrics are described in Section 2. The
quality of the metrics in terms of system level cor-
relation is reported in Section 3. Segment level
correlation with a detailed discussion and a slight

change in the calculation compared to the previous
year is reported in Section 4.

2 Data

We used the translations of MT systems involved
in WMT14 Shared Translation Task together with
reference translations as the test set for the Met-
rics Task. This dataset consists of 110 systems’
outputs and 10 reference translations in 10 trans-
lation directions (English from and into Czech,
French, German, Hindi and Russian). For most of
the translation directions each system’s output and
the reference translation contain 3003 sentences.
For more details please see the WMT14 overview
paper (Bojar et al., 2014).

2.1 Manual MT Quality Judgements

During the WMT14 Translation Task, a large scale
manual annotation was conducted to compare the
systems. We used these collected human judge-
ments for the evalution of the automatic metrics.

The participants in the manual annotation were
asked to evaluate system outputs by ranking trans-
lated sentences relative to each other. For each
source segment that was included in the procedure,
the annotator was shown the outputs of five sys-
tems to which he or she was supposed to assign
ranks. Ties were allowed.

These collected rank labels for each five-tuple
of systems were then interpreted as 10 pairwise
comparisons of systems and used to assign each
system a score that reflects how high that system
was usually ranked by the annotators. Please see
the WMT14 overview paper for details on how this
score is computed. You can also find inter- and
intra-annotator agreement estimates there.

Table 1: Participants of WMT14 Metrics Shared Task

collected 23 metrics from a total of 12 research
groups.

In addition to that we have computed the fol-
lowing two groups of standard metrics as base-
lines:

• Mteval. The metrics BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002) and NIST (Dodding-
ton, 2002) were computed using the
script mteval-v13a.pl2 which is
used in the OpenMT Evaluation Cam-
paign and includes its own tokeniza-
tion. We run mteval with the flag
--international-tokenization
since it performs slightly better (Macháček
and Bojar, 2013).

• Moses Scorer. The metrics TER (Snover
et al., 2006), WER, PER and CDER (Leusch
et al., 2006) were computed using the Moses
scorer which is used in Moses model opti-
mization. To tokenize the sentences we used
the standard tokenizer script as available in
Moses toolkit.

We have normalized all metrics’ scores such
that better translations get higher scores.

3 System-Level Metric Analysis

While the Spearman’s ρ correlation coefficient
was used as the main measure of system-level met-
rics’ quality in the past, we have decided to use
Pearson correlation coefficient as the main mea-
sure this year. At the end of this section we give
reasons for this change.

We use the following formula to compute the
Pearson’s r for each metric and translation direc-
tion:

2http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/
/tools/

r =
∑n

i=1(Hi − H̄)(Mi − M̄)√∑n
i=1(Hi − H̄)2

√∑n
i=1(Mi − M̄)2

(1)
where H is the vector of human scores of all sys-
tems translating in the given direction, M is the
vector of the corresponding scores as predicted by
the given metric. H̄ and M̄ are their means re-
spectively.

Since we have normalized all metrics such that
better translations get higher score, we consider
metrics with values of Pearson’s r closer to 1 as
better.

You can find the system-level correlations for
translations into English in Table 2 and for trans-
lations out of English in Table 3. Each row in the
tables contains correlations of a metric in each of
the examined translation directions. The metrics
are sorted by average Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient across translation directions. The best results
in each direction are in bold.

The reported empirical confidence intervals of
system level correlations were obtained through
bootstrap resampling of 1000 samples (confidence
level of 95 %).

As in previous years, a lot of metrics outper-
formed BLEU in system level correlation. In
into-English directions, metric DISCOTK-PARTY-
TUNED has the highest correlation in two lan-
guage directions and it is also the best correlated
metric on average according to both Pearson and
Spearman’s coefficients. The second best corre-
lated metric on average (according to Pearson) is
LAYERED which is also the single best metric
in Hindi-to-English direction. Metrics REDSYS
and REDSYSSENT are quite unstable, they win
in French-to-English and Czech-to-English direc-
tions respectively but they perform very poorly in

294



other directions.
Except METEOR, none of the participants took

part in the last year metrics task. We can there-
fore compare current and last year results only
for METEOR and baseline metrics. METEOR, the
last year winner, performs generally well in some
directions but it horribly suffers when evaluating
translations from non-Latin script (Russian and es-
pecially Hindi). For the baseline metrics the re-
sults are quite similar across the years. In both
years BLEU performs best among baseline met-
rics, closely followed by CDER. NIST is in the
middle of the list in both years. The remaining
baseline metrics TER, WER and PER perform
much worse.

The results into German are markedly lower
and have broader confidence intervals than the re-
sults in other directions. This could be explained
by a very high number (18) of participating sys-
tems of similar quality. Both human judgements
and automatic metrics are negatively affected by
these circumstances. To preserve the reliability of
overall metrics’ performance across languages, we
decided to exclude English-to-German direction
from the average Pearson and Spearman’s corre-
lation coefficients.

In other out-of-English directions, the best cor-
related metric on average according to Pearson co-
efficient is NIST, even though it does not win in
any single direction. CDER is the second best ac-
cording to Pearson and the best metric according
to Spearman’s. Again it does not win in any single
direction. The metrics PER and WER are quite
unstable. Each of them wins in two directions but
performs very badly in others.

Compared to the last year results, the order of
metrics participating in both years is quite simi-
lar: NIST and CDER performed very well both
years, followed by BLEU. The metrics TER and
WER are again at the end of the list. An interest-
ing change is that PER perform much better this
year.

3.1 Reasons for Pearson correlation
coefficient

In the translation task, there are often similar sys-
tems with human scores very close to each other. It
can therefore easily happen that even a good met-
ric compares two similar systems differently from
humans. We believe that the penalty incurred by
the metric for such a swap should somehow reflect

that the systems were hard to separate.
Since the Spearman’s ρ converts both human

and metric scores to ranks and therefore disregards
the absolute differences in the scores, it does ex-
actly what we feel is not fair. The Pearson corre-
lation coefficient does not suffer from this prob-
lem. We are aware of the fact that Pearson cor-
relation coefficient also reflects whether the rela-
tion between manual and automatic scores is lin-
ear (as opposed to e.g. quadratic). We don’t think
this would be negatively affecting any of the met-
rics since overall, the systems are of a comparable
quality and the metrics are likely to behave lin-
early in this small range of scores.

Moreover, the general agreement to adopt Pear-
son instead of Spearman’s correlation coefficient
was already apparent during the WMT12 work-
shop. This change just did not get through for
WMT13.

4 Segment-Level Metric Analysis

We measure the quality of metrics’ segment-level
scores using Kendall’s τ rank correlation coeffi-
cient. In this type of evaluation, a metric is ex-
pected to predict the result of the manual pairwise
comparison of two systems. Note that the golden
truth is obtained from a compact annotation of five
systems at once, while an experiment with text-to-
speech evaluation techniques by Vazquez-Alvarez
and Huckvale (2002) suggests that a genuine pair-
wise comparison is likely to lead to more stable
results.

In the past, slightly different variations of
Kendall’s τ computation were used in the Metrics
Tasks. Also some of the participants have noticed
a problem with ties in the WMT13 method. There-
fore, we discuss several possible variants in detail
in this paper.

4.1 Notation for Kendall’s τ computation
The basic formula for Kendall’s τ is:

τ =
|Concordant| − |Discordant|
|Concordant|+ |Discordant| (2)

where Concordant is the set of all human com-
parisons for which a given metric suggests the
same order andDiscordant is the set of all human
comparisons for which a given metric disagrees.
In the original Kendall’s τ , comparisons with hu-
man or metric ties are considered neither concor-
dant nor discordant. However in the past, Metrics

Tasks (Callison-Burch et al. (2012) and earlier),
comparisons with human ties were considered as
discordant.

To easily see which pairs are counted as concor-
dant and which as discordant, we have developed
the following tabular notation. This is for example
the WMT12 method:

Metric
WMT12 < = >

H
um

an < 1 -1 -1
= X X X
> -1 -1 1

Given such a matrix Ch,m where h,m ∈ {<,=
, >}3 and a metric we compute the Kendall’s τ the
following way:

We insert each extracted human pairwise com-
parison into exactly one of the nine sets Sh,m ac-
cording to human and metric ranks. For example
the set S<,> contains all comparisons where the
left-hand system was ranked better than right-hand
system by humans and it was ranked the other way
round by the metric in question.

To compute the numerator of Kendall’s τ , we
take the coefficients from the matrix Ch,m, use
them to multiply the sizes of the corresponding
sets Sh,m and then sum them up. We do not in-
clude sets for which the value of Ch,m is X. To
compute the denominator of Kendall’s τ , we sim-
ply sum the sizes of all the sets Sh,m except those
where Ch,m = X. To define it formally:

τ =

∑
h,m∈{<,=,>}

Ch,m 6=X

Ch,m|Sh,m|

∑
h,m∈{<,=,>}

Ch,m 6=X

|Sh,m| (3)

4.2 Discussion on Kendall’s τ computation
In 2013, we thought that metric ties should not be
penalized and we decided to excluded them like
the human ties. We will denote this method as
WMT13:

Metric
WMT13 < = >

H
um

an < 1 X -1
= X X X
> -1 X 1

It turned out, however, that it was not a good idea:
metrics could game the scoring by avoiding hard

3Here the relation < always means “is better than” even
for metrics where the better system receives a higher score.

cases and assigning lots of ties. A natural solution
is to count the metrics ties also in denominator to
avoid the problem. We will denote this variant as
WMT14:

Metric
WMT14 < = >

H
um

an < 1 0 -1
= X X X
> -1 0 1

The WMT14 variant does not allow for gaming
the scoring like the WMT13 variant does. Com-
pared to WMT12 method, WMT14 does not pe-
nalize ties.

We were also considering to get human ties in-
volved. The most natural variant would be the fol-
lowing variant denoted as HTIES:

Metric
HTIES < = >

H
um

an < 1 0 -1
= 0 1 0
> -1 0 1

Unfortunately this method allows for gaming the
scoring as well. The least risky choice for metrics
in hard cases would be to assign a tie because it
cannot worsen the Kendall’s τ and there is quite a
high chance that the human rank is also a tie. Met-
rics could be therefore tuned to predict ties often
but such metrics are not very useful. For example,
the simplistic metric which assigns the same score
to all candidates (and therefore all pairs would be
tied by the metric) would get the score equal to
the proportion of ties in all human comparisons. It
would become one of the best performing metrics
in WMT13 even though it is not informative at all.

We have decided to use WMT14 variant as the
main evaluation measure this year, however, we
are also reporting average scores computed by
other variants.

4.3 Kendall’s τ results
The final Kendall’s τ results are shown in Table 4
for directions into English and in Table 5 for di-
rections out of English. Each row in the tables
contains correlations of a metric in given direc-
tions. The metrics are sorted by average corre-
lation across translation directions. The highest
correlation in each column is in bold. The ta-
bles also contain average Kendall’s τ computed by
other variants including the variant WMT13 used
last year. Metrics which did not compute scores in
all directions are at the bottom of the tables. The

possible values of τ range between -1 (a metric al-
ways predicted a different order than humans did)
and 1 (a metric always predicted the same order as
humans). Metrics with a higher τ are better.

We also computed empirical confidence inter-
vals of Kendall’s τ using bootstrap resampling.
We varied the “golden truth” by sampling from
human judgments. We have generated 1000 new
sets and report the average of the upper and lower
2.5 % empirical bound, which corresponds to the
95 % confidence interval.

In directions into English (Table 4), the
strongest correlated segment-level metric on av-
erage is DISCOTK-PARTY-TUNED followed by
BEER. Unlike the system level correlation, the
results are much more stable here. DISCOTK-
PARTY-TUNED has the highest correlation in 4 of
5 language directions. Generally, the ranking of
metrics is almost the same in each direction.

The only two metrics which also participated
in last year metrics task are METEOR and SENT-
BLEU. In both years, METEOR performed quite
well unlike SENTBLEU which was outperformed
by most of the metrics.

The metric DISCOTK-LIGHT-KOOL is worth
mentioning. It is deliberately designed to assign
the same score for all systems for most of the
segments. It obtained scores very close to zero
(i.e. totally uninformative) in WMT14 variant. In
WMT13 thought it reached the highest score.

In directions out of English (Table 5), the met-
ric with highest correlation on average across all
directions is BEER, followed by METEOR.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we summarized the results of the
WMT14 Metrics Shared Task, which assesses the
quality of various automatic machine translation
metrics. As in previous years, human judgements
collected in WMT14 serve as the golden truth and
we check how well the metrics predict the judge-
ments at the level of individual sentences as well
as at the level of the whole test set (system-level).

This year, neither the system-level nor the
segment-level scores are directly comparable to
the previous years. The system-level scores are af-
fected by the change of the underlying interpreta-
tion of the collected judgements in the main trans-
lation task evaluation as well as our choice of Pear-
son coefficient instead of Spearman’s rank corre-
lation. The segment-level scores are affected by

the different handling of ties this year. Despite
somewhat sacrificing the year-to-year comparabil-
ity, we believe all changes are towards a fairer
evaluation and thus better in the long term.

As in previous years, segment-level correlations
are much lower than system-level ones, reaching
at most Kendall’s τ of 0.45 for the best performing
metric in its best language pair. So there is quite
some research work to be done. We are happy
to see that many new metrics emerged this year,
which also underlines the importance of the Met-
rics Shared Task.
