Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a morphologically-
aware electronic dictionary for St. Lawrence
Island Yupik, an endangered language of the
Bering Strait region. Implemented using
HTML, Javascript, and CSS, the dictionary
is set in an uncluttered interface and permits
users to search in Yupik or in English for Yupik
root words and Yupik derivational suffixes.
For each matching result, our electronic dic-
tionary presents the user with the correspond-
ing entry from the Badten et al. (2008) Yupik-
English paper dictionary. Because Yupik is
a polysynthetic language, handling of multi-
morphemic word forms is critical. If a user
searches for an inflected Yupik word form, we
perform a morphological analysis and return
entries for the root word and for any deriva-
tional suffixes present in the word. This elec-
tronic dictionary should serve not only as a
valuable resource for all students and speak-
ers of Yupik, but also for field linguists work-
ing towards documentation and conservation
of the language.

1 Introduction

St. Lawrence Island Yupik (hereafter Yupik) is an
endangered, polysynthetic language of the Bering
Strait region, spoken primarily on St. Lawrence
Island, Alaska, and the Chukotka Peninsula of
Russia.1 It has undergone a radical language
shift in the past few decades, with the youngest
generation largely abandoning Yupik in favor of
English (Koonooka, 2005) and Russian (Mor-
gounova, 2007), respectively.

1Special thanks to the Native Village of Gambell and the
St. Lawrence Island Yupik speakers who have graciously
shared their language and culture with us, the Gambell
Schools, and the Alaska Native Language Center. This work
was supported by NSF Awards 1761680 and 1760977, by a
GMU Presidential Scholarship, and by a University of Illinois
Graduate College Illinois Distinguished Fellowship.

There is overt community interest on
St. Lawrence Island in Yupik language revi-
talization, specifically in developing modern
technologies to facilitate language-learning.
We present one such technology resource: a
morphologically-aware web-based version of the
Badten et al. (2008) Yupik-English dictionary.2

2 Motivation & Prior Work

The electronic dictionary is part of a larger effort
to digitize and develop resources for Yupik. A ma-
jor goal of ours is to build an integrated (mobile-
friendly) Yupik language portal to eventually pro-
vide St. Lawrence Island community members
with an easy mechanism to access digitized Yupik
print resources that are integrated with dictionary,
morphological analysis, and concordance features.

Over the past two years, we have scanned,
cleaned, and OCR’d several volumes of existing
Yupik resources, including four anthologies of
legends and folk tales (Apassingok et al., 1985,
1987, 1989; Koonooka, 2003) and three elemen-
tary readers (Apassingok et al., 1993, 1994, 1995),
as well as the Yupik reference grammar of Jacob-
son (2001). We have also scanned (but not yet
cleaned and OCR’d) nearly all of the Yupik lan-
guage pre-primers, primers, and pedagogical ma-
terials present in the school library and Materials
Development Center archive in Gambell, Alaska.

In addition to initiating this digital corpus for
Yupik, we have also begun to implement a suite of
computational systems with a wide range of utili-
ties. To date, we have implemented a Yupik finite-
state morphological analyzer (Chen and Schwartz,
2018) and a web utility (Schwartz and Chen, 2017)
capable of performing orthotactic spell-checking,
transliteration between Yupik’s Latin and Cyrillic
orthographies and IPA, syllabification, and stress-
marking. A morphologically-aware web-based

porting community language revitalization efforts.

3 Morphologically-aware searchable
electronic Yupik dictionary

Yupik is a polysynthetic language with a rela-
tively high average number of morphemes per
word (Schwartz et al., 2019). Figure 1 shows ex-
amples where a single Yupik word containing mul-
tiple morphemes constitutes an entire sentence.
Any Yupik electronic dictionary must be sensitive
to both derivational and inflectional morphology.

Entries for the electronic dictionary were ex-
ported from the original FileMaker Pro database
files used by the Alaska Native Language Cen-
ter to create the Badten et al. (2008) print dictio-
nary. Each entry in the print dictionary includes
a Yupik morpheme (either a root or a derivational
suffix) in both Latin and Cyrillic orthographies, an
English definition, and (for many entries) exam-
ple sentence(s) in which the morpheme appears
and/or other notes about word origin or usage. We
augment these entries by specifying the part of
speech: each Yupik root is marked as noun, verb,
particle, or demonstrative, and each Yupik deriva-
tional morpheme is marked for its derivation pat-
tern (that is, as attaching to either a noun root or

to a verb root, and as yielding either a noun or a
verb). The pronunciation of a Yupik word is pre-
dictable from its spelling; we therefore also aug-
ment each dictionary entry with its predicted pro-
nunciation in IPA to provide additional utility to
linguists working with the language.

Our searchable Yupik electronic dictionary is
implemented as a static HTML page and basic
CSS style sheet, with dictionary search and mor-
phology functions implemented in Javascript (see
Figure 2 above). This provides the user access
to all entries from the Badten et al. (2008) print
dictionary, including roots and derivational mor-
phemes. Internet access and mobile data coverage
on St. Lawrence Island and Chukotka is relatively
poor and sometimes unreliable; to support use in
these environments the electronic dictionary does
not require an internet connection to function.

Users can browse all dictionary entries that be-
gin with a particular letter by selecting that let-
ter from the Yupik alphabet displayed above the
search box (Figure 3a), or search for Yupik sub-
strings (Figure 3b), uninflected morphemes (Fig-
ure 3d), or fully inflected Yupik words (Figure 3e)
including those with multiple morphemes (Fig-
ure 3f). The search results present all Yupik dic-
tionary entries (both roots and derivational mor-

(a) After the user selects letter S from the search interface, all words beginning with that letter are
displayed. The first three results are shown here.

(b) The user can enter a search term either in Yupik or in English. Here, partial results are shown
for the incomplete Yupik search term aghna. Yupik words containing that substring are displayed.

(c) The user may alternatively search in English. Here, partial results are shown for the search
term family. Note that derivational suffixes containing the English search term are returned in
addition to roots.

(d) Yupik searches may also return entries corresponding to Yupik derivational suffixes. Here,
partial results are shown for the search term nkut.

(e) The user may search for fully inflected Yupik words. Here, results are shown for the search
term nagatunga ‘I listened.’

(f) Preliminary support is included for multi-morphemic Yupik word searches. Here, partial re-
sults for the Yupik word mangteghaghrugllangllaghyunghitunga ‘I didn’t want to make a huge house’
are shown.

(g) Preliminary support is included for Yupik searches using the Cyrillic orthography. Here, par-
tial results for the Yupik word qikmiq are shown. The search was performed in Cyrillic.

phemes) that completely or partially match the
Yupik search string. Users may also search in En-
glish. In that case, search results return any dic-
tionary entries that contain the search term as a
substring in the English definition (Figure 3c).

In order to facilitate use by Yupik speakers in
Chukotka as well as Alaska, preliminary support
is included for searches where the Yupik search
term is input in the Yupik Cyrillic orthography.
Figure 3g depicts results where the search term
was written in Cyrillic. Currently, searches per-
formed in Cyrillic return English entries only,
as entries pull from the English-language Badten
et al. (2008) dictionary. This may be useful for
a user who does not speak Russian but who has
come across a Yupik word written in Cyrillic and
wishes to find out its meaning. However, it does
not address the needs of Yupik speakers who also
speak Russian, but not English. We intend fu-
ture iterations to integrate entries from Russian-
language dictionaries of Yupik, such that a search
performed in Cyrillic will return Yupik or Russian
entries, depending on the search term, just as a
search performed in the Latin orthography returns
Yupik or English entries.

4 Community & Research Impacts

The electronic dictionary with its existing func-
tionalities has the ability to make a significant im-
pact on the Yupik language community as well
as researchers working on the language. The
current version of the electronic dictionary in-
cludes preliminary support for multi-morphemic
searches using the integrated morphological an-
alyzer, and preliminary support for searches per-
formed in Cyrillic. More robust implementations
of these features are ongoing.

We anticipate that the electronic dictionary will
greatly facilitate access to knowledge that was
otherwise difficult to obtain, and make it read-
ily available to all community members. Ver-
sions of the print dictionary have been available
through the University of Alaska Press in vari-
ous editions since 1983, with revisions in 1987
and 2008. However, the print edition is bulky and
relatively expensive; while the school libraries in
Gambell and Savoonga have copies, most com-
munity members (including some members of the
Yupik Bible translation project) do not.

While the dictionary should impact all commu-
nity members, regardless of age, we expect it to

most positively shape the language experience of
the younger generations, promoting language use
among youth who may be unlikely (for social rea-
sons) to ask elders about word-forms. Moreover,
one of the most promising features of the dictio-
nary with respect to language learning is the inte-
gration of the foma finite-state analyzer, which al-
lows fully inflected word forms with multiple mor-
phemes to be searched in order to either define
parts of the word or to reconstruct its full mean-
ing. This should be especially valuable for stu-
dents who have not yet mastered the polysynthetic
aspects of the Yupik language. For example, stu-
dents could be allowed to use the dictionary in the
classroom to help them read through Yupik texts
that contain vocabulary that is at a higher level
than they might otherwise be able to handle. Stu-
dents would not need to be able to parse an unfa-
miliar word to be able to look up the meaning of
the root.

The electronic dictionary is practical in much
the same ways for linguists and researchers, al-
lowing them to swiftly search for word forms and
definitions via a resource that is significantly more
portable than a two-volume paper dictionary. The
integration of the foma finite-state analyzer is of
particular note, however, since it can be used in the
construction of morphological interlinear glosses
(see Figure 1), which are critical for the processing
and sharing of linguistic data. The electronic dic-
tionary supplemented with the morphological an-
alyzer greatly expedites this process, which must
otherwise be done by hand.

We plan to conduct live user field testing of the
electronic dictionary in the Gambell School dur-
ing spring and summer 2019. User feedback will
inform user-interface redesign decisions and will
provide valuable feedback regarding which fea-
tures are most valued by Yupik community mem-
bers. We also plan to embed the dictionary in na-
tive mobile apps for Android and iOS, and to con-
duct field testing of those user interfaces as well.

While this electronic dictionary provides direct
support for the language revitalization efforts of
the Yupik community specifically, we hope that
it might serve as a blueprint for similar tools for
other endangered languages, particularly those of
a polysynthetic nature. Such an analyzer-linked
dictionary may be of use both to the language
communities themselves, and to researchers work-
ing with the communities to reinforce their efforts.
